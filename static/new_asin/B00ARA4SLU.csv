5482829,4,B00ARA4SLU,"""Hitchcock"" (2012 release; 98 min.) is based on Stephen Rebello's non-fiction book 'Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho'. As the movie opens we see that Hitchcock is enjoying the success of 1959's North by Northwest movie, and is now pondering his next project. Paramount Pictures would like for him to do another North By Northwest-like movie, but Hitchcock is itching for something different and challenging. He stumbles upon the book Psycho, and decides that will be his next project. Paramount resists of course, and Hitchcock in the end finances the movie pretty much by himself. But the REAL story of ""Hitchcock"" is not Psycho, or not even Alfred Hitchcock himself, but instead Alma Reville (a/k/a Mrs. Hitchcock) and her relationship with Alfred and other people in her life. In that sense, the movie is really mistitled, and a more appropriate title would be ""Mr. & Mrs. Hitchcock"". I don't know to what extent the movie is a correct reflection of historical facts, but I was quite surprised to learn of the active role that Alma played in (i) rewriting the script for Psycho when rewrites where needed and the original writer was unavailable, (ii) stepping in as a director when Hitchcock fell ill for a few days, and (iii) re-editing (along with Hitchcock) the film after the initial cool reception (it was her Alma's insistence that the now infamous musical score for the shower scene was added).

Several comments: the acting in the movie is superb throughout. I felt a bit sorry for Anthony Hopkins as he has the impossible task of bringing an iconic character like Hitchcock to life, but Hopkins did pretty well. However, the scene-stealer par excellence is Helen Mirren as Mrs. Hitchcock: she truly brings the film to life. At one point, when Hitchcock suspects her of having an affair with another writer, Alma dresses down Hitchcock (figuratively), and it is one devastating scene and the highlight of the film.

Kudos as well to Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Biel, in the choice supporting roles of Janet Leigh and Vera Miles, respectively. Johansson is just ravishing. I don't know why but I had very little expectations going into this movie. I shouldn't have worried, as the movie simply flew by in no time and I enjoyed this a lot more than I ever expected.",1357430400,64,2286,4.889175257731959
5482830,3,B00ARA4SLU,"The planning and completion of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film ""Psycho"" is the subject of the new movie ""Hitchcock"", directed by Sacha Gervasi and starring Anthony Hopkins as the legendary director with Helen Mirren as his long-suffering wife Alma Reville. How much of the picture is authentic and how much fantasy can only be guessed, John McLaughlin's script cleverly imagining Hitchcock haunted by the legend of Ed Gein, author Robert Bloch's protoype for Norman Bates; but Hopkins really bears no resemblance to Hitchcock (the sly charm isn't there) and Scarlett Johansson looks nothing like his specially-billed star Janet Leigh. Because Alma was always a background presence (and her lack of recognition becomes an important plot element here), Helen Mirren's lack of resemblance is not really that essential. According to Janet Leigh in the book she wrote recalling her experience of the filming, the set of ""Psycho"" was light-hearted and friendly, but you would never guess that from ""Hitchcock"", because the mood appears to be consistently unhappy. For instance in one scene Hopkins in the role of Hitchcock mocks the talent of John Gavin, a surprising revelation considering that Gavin is still alive. Hitchcock's dismissive attitude towards Vera Miles is explained to a curious Janet Leigh: he had slated Miles to play the lead in ""Vertigo"" but shortly before shooting was to commence Miles got pregnant (by her then-husband, a baby-faced Tarzan), leaving Hitchcock Madeleine-less, Judy-less, and furious. Writer Joseph Stefano, designer Saul Bass, even star Anthony Perkins only appear briefly, the latter significantly naming ""Rope"" and ""Strangers on a Train"" as his two favorite Hitchcocks. And judging from this screenplay, you would never know that the Hitchcocks had a grown daughter, one who was given a small role in ""Psycho"": Patricia Hitchcock is never mentioned. Fans hoping for an inside look at the technical aspects of ""Psycho"" will probably be disappointed. The shower bath scene is handled rather perfunctorily, and it's not clear that it took up so much of the shooting schedule; there is only a brief scene of Marion Crane ""driving"" in front of a rear-projection screen, Hitchcock yelling insults at the character from behind camera; and the melon contest, with casaba the winner, would have been interesting but is ignored. The fact is ""Hitchcock"" never gets deeply involved in the production so that basically this is just a brisk, somewhat gossipy story of a classic filming.",1357171200,,2504,5.293969849246231
5482831,4,B00ARA4SLU,"I'm not quite sure why 2 similar movies about director Alfred Hitchcock come out at the same time.  The other being ""The Girl"" (HBO) which I haven't seen, but Hitchcock was certainly an interesting character.  This film, set during the development of ""Psycho,"" focuses primarily on his relationship with his wife Alma Reville (Helen Mirren).  Hitchcock (an appropriately corpulent Anthony Hopkins) loves making movies and after the success of ""North by Northwest"" is anxious to start his next project.

After reading about the serial killer Ted Gein, Hitchcock decides to make a movie with a similar theme.  This horrifies the studio (Paramount) and the censors.  Eventually Hitch (he liked to be called Hitch as he tells his newest star Janet Leigh, ""drop the cock"") has to finance the picture on his own.  The most interesting thing about this movie is Alma who was an excellent filmmaker herself, but had subjugated herself to work with her husband.  Ms. Mirren steals the scenes she's in as the no nonsense professional.

I remember Janet Leigh being interviewed several times and memory suggests Scarlett Johansson hits the perfect note as Hitchcock latest blond beauty.  Directed by Sacha Gervasi, the film seems to get off track at times.  This is particularly noticeable when Hitchcock's subconscious images of Gein (Michael Wincott) starts talking to him.

Although the movie only runs 98 minutes, it feels a bit bloated.  Still the movie includes a good impersonation by Hopkins that includes Hitchcock's famous wit.  This is best shown at the opening of ""Psycho"" as he playfully ""conducts"" the orchestra and screams coming from the theater while standing with a shocked usher in the lobby.",1356998400,3,1700,5.134545454545455
5482832,3,B00ARA4SLU,"As fine an actor as he is and despite his acumen in vocal mimicry, Anthony Hopkins somehow misses the mark in impersonating the legendary director in this 2012 biopic. Perhaps it's his overly deliberate line readings or the artificiality of the latex prosthetics or the vivid memory I have of the real filmmaker, but some combination of those factors prevented me from fully accepting Hopkins as Hitchcock. That's a shame since Helen Mirren, who plays Hitchcock's wife Alma Reville, which if this story is to be believed, was the master filmmaker's muse and confidant, is quite effective in conveying the stringent manner of her influential character while revealing Alma's aching vulnerability in having to live in her husband's considerable shadow. Loosely based on Stephen Rebello's meticulously researched 1990 book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alfred-Hitchcock-and-the-Making-of-Psycho/dp/1593765118/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho</a>, the screenplay has been adapted by John J. Laughlin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Swan/dp/B004U8VWLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Swan</a>) to focus more on the relationship between Hitchcock and Alma rather than the production of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Psycho/dp/B000ICXQXI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Psycho</a>&nbsp;itself.

Director Sacha Gervasi takes the same granular approach that Simon Curtis did with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Week-With-Marilyn/dp/B0076NKLRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Week With Marilyn</a>&nbsp;and Steven Spielberg did with ""Lincoln"", i.e., focus on a specific time period in the subject's life and let those events speak to what motivated the character throughout his or her life. However, unlike those films, Gervasi doesn't adequately reveal what made the rule-breaking filmmaker a genius in his field. The challenging production of ""Psycho"" is handled superficially, even the shower scene is given a cursory glance with lackadaisical intercutting of other characters showing how anger manifested itself in Hitchcock. There are also imaginary interludes that show him receiving advice from convicted serial killer Ed Gein, the real-life inspiration for Norman Bates, on how to stage the more gruesome scenes. What does receive a lot of attention is Hitchcock's relationship with Alma and how instrumental her sharp editing skills were in distilling the more memorable moments of the film.

Her sense of self-worth is shaken enough by Hitchcock's self-absorption that she is easily seduced by the unbridled attention of smarmy screenwriter Whitfield Cook who wants to collaborate with her on his next big-screen project. Meanwhile, casting Janet Leigh in the film unexpectedly brings out the director's tender side as castmate Vera Miles reflects a barely concealed bitterness for having been a Grace Kelly-like Hitchcock protg now reduced to a supporting role to complete her contract. Neither Gervasi nor Laughlin can seem to make all these intertwining storylines resonate beyond a reasonable evocation of the period. Beyond Hopkins and Mirren, there are good albeit underdeveloped performances from Scarlett Johansson as Leigh and Jessica Biel as Miles, neither of whom bears much resemblance to their real-life counterparts. James D'Arcy, however, manages to capture Anthony Perkins' callow nervousness in just a few brief minutes of screen time. All in all, it's an interesting piece of film trivia that falls short of its goal of being something more.",1356912000,4,3671,6.459349593495935

5482844,5,B00ARA4SLU,"Must see for Hitchcock fans.
It's not just the story but there are impressions of Hitchcok style throughout the film.
I knew he was ingrained in my psyche but for example, one scene is reminiscent of a classic Hitckcock car scene & it gave me a chill.

Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as always. Got sucked into Westworld bc of him.
Helen Mirren is fantastic as his wife and, she doesn't just play a supporting role, she has her own storyline.
There is plenty going on to keep your attention yet the picture doesn't lose its focus, the history of Psycho.

Two new things I learned. It was based on actual true story.
Hitchcock sought it out & funded on his own bc at age 60 his relevance, to continue after a successful career, was questioned.
Psycho was his Swan Song to prove he would always have a voice.

There is one other fantastic twist that runs parallel to the main story line but, I don't want to ruin it for you.

5482846,3,B00ARA4SLU,"Alfred Hitchcock is said to have quipped to Miss Bergman when she was struggling with a scene: ""Ingrid, it's only a movie."" The same may be said of ""Hitchcock.""

Hollywood's biopics notoriously play fast and loose with their subjects, be they Cole Porter (""Night and Day,"" 1946) or Johnny Cash (""Walk the Line,"" 2005). Sacha Gervasi's ""Hitchcock"" (2012) is no exception. Based on Stephen Rebello's ""Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho"" (1998)an excellent, thoroughly researched, well-balanced book""Hitchcock"" gives its titular character the same treatment. By that I mean it often oversimplifies human complexity in order to entertain an audience. For instance: There's no evidence whatevercertainly not from Janet Leigh, who ought to have knownthat Hitch uncorked his repressed fury by terrifying her while filming ""Psycho""'s shower scene. That does injustice both to the director's craft and the actress's ability. Exactly how far the relationship went between Hitch's wife Alma Reville and writer Whitfield Cook, who worked on the scripts for ""Stage Fright"" and ""Strangers on a Train,"" seems a matter of disputebut in this film it serves a weak domestic, melodramatic purpose. Ed Gein's wandering in and out of Hitchcock's fantasies is pure chozzeray. For those who care to separate fact from fiction in ""Hitchcock,"" NPR's interview with Patrick McGilligan, a reputable Hitchcock biographer""Fact-Checking ""Hitchcock"": The Man, the Movie, and the Myth"" (24 December 2012)does a good job in short space.

That said, ""Hitchcock"" is graced by some splendid performances. Anthony Hopkins, wearing a fat suit that makes the director even more obese than he actually was in 1959-60, disappears into the character he is playing, even though he's been directed to present a more tortured, less witty characterization.. Scarlett Johansson conveys Janet Leigh's cheerful professionalism. In fleeting minutes onscreen James D'Arcy offers an uncanny portrayal of Anthony Perkins. But this movie belongs to the incomparable Helen Mirren, who captures in Alma Reville the qualities that those who knew her remember most fondly: her intelligence, wit, formidable strength, and unerring judgment. The consensus among those who knew them and have gone on record is that Hitchcock released none of his films unless they had satisfied Alma. When he paid attention to no one else, he always listened to her. If ""Hitchcock"" draws Alma Reville out of the shadows behind the great director and allows her a proper place in the limelight, it is movie worth having been made.

When, in 1979, the American Film Institute honored Hitchcock with a Life Achievement Award, he said to his audience: ""I beg to mention by name only four people who have given me the most affection, appreciation, encouragement and constant collaboration. The first of the four is a film editor, the second is a scriptwriter, the third is the mother of my daughter, Pat, and the fourth is as fine a cook as ever performed miracles in a domestic kitchen. And their names are Alma Reville.""",1505433600,6,3046,5.289256198347108

5482848,4,B00ARA4SLU,"I ordered and read the book because I saw the film ""Hitchcock"" which was supposedly based on the book. The film got the name of the director right, but just about everything else was untrue. In the film, Alma (Hitchcock's wife) plays a crucial role in the making of the film and there is a long, unnecessary, semi-flirtation with a Hollywood scumbag, which in itself detracted from the film. The beginning was also factually wrong, the man that Norman Bates is modeled after did not kill his brother, as was shown in the film. And so on and so on. Too bad, because until I found out it was full of factual errors, I had enjoyed the movie, no doubt because I am a Hitchcock fan.

The book itself is a detailed history of putting the movie together, and all elements are looked at in the book, which is good if you like film making, Hitchcock, or Psycho. Which you are, otherwise you wouldn't be reading this. It's a very pleasant read and you don't have to know the technical aspects in detail.",1504224000,,993,4.426229508196721

I would suggest that people who are thinking that this is isn't particularly fact based, should consider the framing device.

5482871,2,B00ARA4SLU,"Absolutely unnecessary film about the great rotund film director (everyone's favorite visual artist of classic-style British and British-American suspense pictures) and his long-suffering spouse Alma (portrayed here by the once radiant Helen Mirren) as they come upon many marital road-blocks and speed bumps as Hitch decides to pursue his dream project--the filming of an un-filmable ""trashploitation"" novel by Robert Bloch entitled ""Psycho"", a story about a ""queer who dresses up like his mother."" This is all well and good, but soon enough the studio doesn't want to make the movie, and they aren't sure about Hitch's choice for a screenwriter (played nervously here by Ralph ""The Karate Kid"" Macchio, doing a none-too-kosher lampoon of the set-upon Joseph Stefano, whose best film work most likely occurred on TV).
Allegedly ""primped"" for an A+E television miniseries presentation, Hollywood executives--in some unknown fit of anxiety--decided to purchase the rights to Stephen Rebello's source nonfiction story and gave it the ol' greenlight for a studio feature film instead. Big mistake. I mean seriously, I'm left scratching my head more than anything these days. What are these Hollywood types thinking?! I mean, it's all good for Rebello that he was able to get something produced, but sheesh! How about something, I don't know, different perhaps? With all due respect to Anthony Hopkins, I just don't get what he was trying to do in this performance. He carries a stomach sack on him throughout the picture and attempts to act as if he could muscle down a whole steak and two bottles of sweet wine for lunch every day, but I just didn't buy it. His performance made me wish for the total and complete demise of the Academy Awards (just in general). Helen Mirren, the once luscious star of 1969's ""Age of Consent"", here has turned into a still fine actress but a none too commanding one, given the role. For years, this nice lady's talent has been misused (or simply ignored) on film, and now Hollywood is throwing paycheck after paycheck at her and making her degrade herself in junk-food fiascos like the movie RED. It's sickening, if you ask me. Finally, Scarlett Johansson is NOT Janet Leigh. 'Nuff said.
I guess my intention with all of this carping is to alert you to the fact that I just don't think we (as a species) need any more of these movies in which Hollywood is looking back at its old perverted past all the time. It is simply unnecessary. Apparently Rebello himself has done time in the Egyptian House of the Dead (I'm speaking of the Disney offices) in which he's worked on some fresh story material over there--needless to say, these projects probably won't be seeing the light of day, but HITCHCOCK, well, they greenlighted this sucker in a hellfire hurry! And why not? It's got the stench of Oscar bait all over it, and the hovering aroma of freshly caught bass to boot. Apparently it was Rebello's rewrites of this picture that made the story more about a tangled, simple-minded love tiff (""The Romance of Alfie and Alma"") rather than a more thorough (and interesting) examination of Hitchcock's interest in the mind and crimes of Ed Gein. Such a picture based upon this story angle might have been interesting and compelling indeed. But we don't really learn why Hitchcock was so fascinated by Gein's horrendous behavior, nor do we get a better understanding of why he wanted to buy Robert Bloch's source novel for an adaptation (other than the understandable fact that he couldn't put the book down). And without such understanding being brought to the material, the script is merely a pointless combination of love story and movie set political diatribe, often trying to get us to sympathize with Hitch's whims while being kept in the background as to what this business of movie directing is all about in the first place.
Fox Searchlight's higher end DVD/Blu-Ray combo package does go the distance in terms of extra content (although I confess that I have not yet listened to the Gervasi/Rebello audio commentary track), but when the picture is as disappointing as this one I find it difficult to care about the extra material offered. The picture and sound quality are quite good--and you can read up on the details at bluray.com if you're interested--but to me, again, the picture was sort of a depressing experience. The movie wants to be entertaining in an old-fashioned and glitzy Hollywood kind of way, but you may as well wait until they run it on AMC before you shell out the hard-earned dollars to bring this one home.

5482903,3,B00ARA4SLU,"A bit contrived and often flat in the scenes between Hitch and Alma (what Hitch himself would have done with placid English domesticity curdled with perverse impulses!). But Tony Hopkins' Hitchcock is a nice piece of impersonation. And Scarlett Johansson's Janet Leigh is crisp, a sharp little miniature of tone and likeness. Some specific complaints: the first act seems rushed. Some histories have ""Psycho"" coming as a result of Hitchcock's shrewd reading of the emerging market for cheap, dark little exploitation/drive-in movies. ""Hitchcock"" instead casts the movie as a make-or-break moment for Hitchcock's commercial viabilitywhich it may have been, but those beats are thinly established. Instead the movie pursues a melodramatic subplot in which Hitchcock suspects Alma is cheating on him. He's tormented by his suspicions and his fears, which are voiced by Ed Gein himself as a kind of spectral conscience. A bizarre and distracting choice (maybe Bosley Crowther would have made more sense). Getting any movie made is enough of a tale of farce and treachery; why the creative team added this layer of misdirection is hard to figure. For my own taste, it would have been much more illuminating to have the film plumb Hitch's creative and commercial response to the ""Psycho""-like cheapies that were crowding out his own brand of filmmaking. The point is that ""Psycho"" was a turning point for Hitch; his sexual obsessions became starker and less playful after ""Psycho."" The film is more like a shrieky coda to ""Vertigo"" than this film lets on. This movie depicts him stumbling and unsure of himself during the filming of what is rightly considered a masterpiece. There's some dramatic value to that, but it  doesn't account for the masterly confidence of virtually every shot in ""Psycho."" If Hitch was an artist on the downslope of his powers, where did such a movie come from, given he was working with a rookie screenwriter and the production crew from his TV series? What I missed most in the movie was some of Hitchcock's own wit in teasing out the perversity of quiet middle-class people who dabble in murder firsthand or once-removed.",1463961600,7,2146,5.079320113314448

5482984,4,B00ARA4SLU,"I didn't realize who was playing Hitchcock until watching the Extra on the bluray.  I thought it was some unknown British actor who bear near but no resemblance to Mr H.  When thinking of Mr H, I see bulging eye balls, big lips, with thick double chin and a look of disdain.  This actor was none of that.  The actor's voice was very good, and the acting was exceptional - the way Hithcock carried himself.

The actress playing Mr. H's wife was exceptional.  She stealed the show.  Since we know very little of Hitchcock's wife, this character comes alive.  I was not convinced of the Janet Leigh with that fake wig which didn't look real.  But all negative aside about costumes and make ups, the movie did well in portrayal of the characters - and the audience resorts to use his/her imagination to follow the story.

And it's a great behind the scene story about the making of ""Psycho"" the original 1960 version.  The hurdles the film crew went through to make it all possible, and this part of the private life of Mr. Hitch.  Having seen ""Psycho"" both the original and the sequel, I felt spellbound by this movie.
More than a documentary tale but a great one.  If Alfred Hitchcock were to watch this movie, will he turn over in his grave?  Or will he give a solemn wink and a look of disdain before walking away with ""Gooood Evahning""",1426377600,,1336,4.466942148760331

This movie doesn't focus on Hitchcock's intense stalking and harassing of Tippy Hedron, but more on the general studio restrictions and technical problems encountered while filming, ""The Birds"". I thought there would be at least a small reference to the odd relationship between Hitchcock and his leading lady. In this film, I felt that Hitchcock was depicted as a concerned ""fatherly"" figure, and not as an obsessed masher that ultimately forever damaged the actresses life and career.

5482992,3,B00ARA4SLU,"3 1/2 stars -- The movie focuses on the period in Hitchcock's life, around 1959-60, between the success of ""North by Northwest"" and the first showing of ""Psycho,"" so it's a matter of a creative genius of a certain kind trying to turn his attention to a new project that will surprise or shock people -- and, as we all know, he succeeded.  Anthony Hopkins, carefully bulked up, is Hitchcock, and the human interest derives from Hitchcock's awareness of his age and declining health (although he would in fact live for another two decades), and his continuing fascination with blonde stars that he casts in his movies (Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh, here)  that is coming to seem a bit pathetic to his wife of thirty years, Alma (Helen Mirren), who is also his closest creative collaborator.  Admired by the struggling screenwriter Whitfield Cook (Danny Huston), Alma decides to bring Hitchcock to his senses, and does so without compromising her integrity and also re-igniting their creative partnership in getting ""Psycho"" out of the editing room and on to the screen.  Side plots involve Hitchcock's struggles to get the film financed and distributed (Richard Portnow is Barney Balaban, the head of Paramount) and to get it past the censors in a shape that will include the effects he wants (Kurtwood Smith is Geoffrey Shurlock, the head censor).

The film is basically a comedy of a woman 's success in recalling her husband's attention to their marriage and their working lives, which are deeply connected in this case.  Hitchcock's distractions with his female stars, which includes a bit of locker-room-type voyeurism, are not presented as psyche-shaking.  Rather, they're comical.  And Hitchcock's interest in violence is likewise played quite lightly, through the device of imaginary conversations between Hitchcock and Ed Gein (Michael Wincott), a serial killer on whose exploits the novel ""Psycho"" was based.  Hopkins has caught Hitchcock's plummy voice very well, and it's a pleasure to hear him and Mirren go at it.  The script is sharply written, and the scenes between Mirren and Hopkins are charming -- two old pros who could do this kind of thing in their sleep, but who seem to enjoy working with one another as much as Hitchcock and Alma apparently did.  Scarlett Johansson makes Janet Leigh a sympathetic and attractive character, and Jessica Biel does good work as Vera Miles, an actress whose priorities are not Hitchcock's but are perfectly defensible as life choices.  Toni Collette is Hitchcock's secretary Peggy Robertson -- a role that doesn't call on all her powers.  The personal and professional stories are efficiently combined, and the movie doesn't drag -- it's pleasant light entertainment and enjoyable as such.",1424476800,,2748,5.107142857142857

What did I think?

Hitch had a lot of fears, and thankfully his greatest was self-doubt. It spurred him to create Psycho, which is the setting for this charming dual-focus biopic.

Full of wit, insights and fascinating anecdotes about the creation of Psycho, and the fiendish psyches of the masterful storyteller and his ingenious wife Alma as they battle the fears of Hollywood and each other  like a good Hitchock film, great fun, and not what you expect.

The acting is superb, and lets just save time and give the Best Actress Oscar to Helen Mirren. She deserves it purely for her mesmerising blonde speech.",1423699200,2,837,4.763888888888889

There IS one thing I would have liked to see worked into this movie was Pat Hitchcock. But she's still living so I guess that could be a problem.

If you feel the need to see a more ""accurate"" representation of a Hitchcock episode get HBO's ""The Girl"" starring Toby Jones as Hitch and as Alma, lmelda Staunton. Toby and Imelda are TINY replicas of Hitch and Alma. Toby also played Truman Capote in Infamous (more fun than Philip Seymour Hoffman, sorry, yeah).

5483042,4,B00ARA4SLU,"Alfred Hitchcock is rightly regarded as one of the greatest movie directors of all time, and ""Psycho"" is rightly regarded as one of his greatest films.

So how better to tell the story than with a light, tongue-in-cheek tale about Hitchcock's marital woes and battles with the studio? ""Hitchcock"" is a fun movie with some genuinely brilliant acting, particularly by Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren, and it does show us how even the greatest have to fight for their art. But it also shies away from any kind of depth.

In 1959, Alfred Hitchcock (Hopkins) had another runaway success with ""North by Northwest,"" but is bothered by a reporter's implication that his best work is behind him. While the studios offer him their best (such as adapting ""Casino Royale""), Hitchcock wants to reclaim the raw artistic thrill of his younger days. So he decides to adapt a bestselling horror novel, ""Psycho.""

His wife Alma (Mirren) quickly warms to the idea, despite wanting to do her own writing projects with her friend Whitfield Cook (Danny Huston). But the studio balks, forcing Hitchcock to finance the movie with his own money.

But Alma is soon annoyed by studio meddling and Hitchcock's constant ogling of the beautiful blonde Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johansson). Hitchcock begins to suspect that Alma is having an affair with Whit, and the stress takes a toll on both his health and the movie shoot. At the same time, he is plagued with insecurities about the movie's future, and whether it will sink his career.

Hitchcock is a man who is still something of an enigma today, but ""Hitchcock"" doesn't really try to explore him in any depth. Instead, it dances between the Hitchcocks' marital problems and the trials of making a movie that no studio wants anything to do with -- and it does it with a wry, witty touch that borders on comedy without ever quite crossing the line.

The writing tends to be airy and clever, especially when the writers dabble in Hitchcock's notorious macabre streak (""By the way try the finger sandwiches... they're real fingers,"" he remarks when showing people pictures of a serial killer's work). In fact, he's at his most charming when he's lighthearted, such as the little stabby dance he does outside the theater on opening night.

However, I felt that ""Hitchcock"" avoided handling its story with any depth. The marital spat is cleared up too quickly and cleanly, and his controlling nature towards the ""Hitchcock blondes"" is briefly touched on but never really explored. And Hitchcock's conversations with an imaginary Ed Gein seemed strangely out of sync with the tone of the overall movie.

But Hopkins plays Hitchcock as a genial, witty man with some darker sides, and he mimics Hitchcock's speech and body language nicely. On the flipside, Mirren plays Alma as a fiery, intelligent woman who is content to remain in her husband's shadow, but also wants to be appreciated for it. And James D'Arcy and Scarlett Johansson do fine smaller roles as Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh.

""Hitchcock"" is not a bad movie, just a lightweight one -- excellent acting, a somewhat flimsy story, and plenty of behind-the-scenes woes for a now-beloved movie. See it for the performances and the banter.",1410393600,,3216,4.918819188191882

5483057,4,B00ARA4SLU,"Sir Anthony Hopkins does a bang-up job as Alfred Hitchcock.  Helen Mirren is also superb as Alma Reville.  I've seen lots of Hitchcock movies and TV shows, and his work always freaked me out.  I couldn't take a shower after watching Psycho 3 (I started with that movie first).  I couldn't stand being around birds after watching The Birds.  When you're young, you're impressionable.

The biography was fascinating.  The hoops Hitchcock had to jump through to get funding and to make Psycho was interesting, as well as the censorship process.  It's funny that you couldn't show a toilet on TV/the big screen in the 60s, or even some forms of violence - things that we take for granted today.  Hitchcock was a master of perception.  You really thought Marion Crane was getting stabbed to death, but you didn't see the knife actually penetrate.  Sound was all you needed.  I hate that music to this day!  And you can ""hear"" the stabbing of the knife as it ""penetrates"" bone and flesh.  The music is all you need to be in a state of heightened awareness, but the fake blood also supports the realism of his horrific thrillers.  Hitchcock paved the way for a lot of horror movies today.  He was truly a visionary, and like a lot of visionaries, he had to believe in his vision when no one else would.  Although, Ms. Reville always stood by her man.

5483108,4,B00ARA4SLU,"Alfred Hitchcock earned the title, The Master of the Macabre, by making over  50 movies involving murderous death and mayhem, and his signature techniques are still powerful today. I often give talks illustrated with clips from Hitchs films, and it doesnt matter if the audience is made up of high school students, teachers, writers, psychotherapists, or film buffs, they all react to classic suspenseful scenes like the out-of-control carousel from Strangers on a Train, the discovery of the farmers body in The Birds, the chase across the faces of Mt. Rushmore in North By Northwest, or the voyeuristic scenes from Psycho. The Psycho film is the centerpiece of the new biopic Hitchcock which not only showcases the directors fears and foibles, but also his manipulation of women, collaborators, the press, and Alma Reville, his wife, co-writer, editor, script girl, and mother of his daughter, Patricia. This film places a little too much emphasis on the McGuffin of having Paramount Studios be unwilling to bankroll a black and white movie, when the truer story is how Hitch wanted to make more money off his films, and by being his own banker/producer, he reaped a huge profit. But you don't have to be a film buff to delight in all the great work by the actors personifying Hitch, Alma, Janet Leigh, Tony Perkins, Vera Miles, composer Bernard Hermann and screenwriter Josef Stefano.

You will not be disappointed by the performances.  In fact, you might just enjoy the film simply because you get to observe how well these actors perform.

That said, the story hints at a deeper series of life issues than it reveals.  It is often slow and ponderous.  Nothing that exciting actually happens.  Nothing terribly interesting is revealed.  I think they could have presented Hitchcock and his loved ones/associates in greater depth.  It always felt like we the viewers were not privy to a series of dirty little secrets lying just below the surface of the story given us.

That's fine for building suspense, tension, etc.  But there comes a time for a reveal, people.  Otherwise it is not that satisfying.

Out of all the Anthony Hopkins films I've seen, I think this is one of his weakest performances. I do not, however, blame his acting, I blame the script? This story seemed to focus on Alma Reville, Hitchcocks wife, more than Alfred Hitchcock himself which is probably why Helen Mirren was the one honored/nominated during awards season + not Hopkins.

One thing I did love about the film was how they intertwined Ed Geins story with Hitchcocks mental status during the filming of Psycho but this effect was underutilized? I mean, its Hollywood  they could have been more dramatic, which would have made for a better movie, IMO.

Scarlett Johansson is also solid as Janet Leigh. On the other hand Anthony Hopkins is fine as Hitch but the choice of having these dream sequences where he talks to the murderer Ed Gein (upon whom the Tony Perkins character in Psycho) is based on was just plain awkward. Jessica Biel's talents are completely wasted in such an insignificant part as the put-upon Vera Miles. That added almost nothing to the story despite some attempt to link Hitch's weird behavior towards her somewhat to his odd obsession with icy blondes.

The look and feel of the Hollywood movie sets, backlot as well as the Southern California coast at that time was pretty cool. The wheeling and dealing to get the funding and also to avoid the censors was most likely pretty eyeopening to people born today and not yesterday.

5483149,5,B00ARA4SLU,"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this movie...

Hitchcock (2012) is a story that centers around the period of time that Alfred Hitchcock and his wife Alma were working on the horror mega classic Psycho (1960) and the concern and negativity surrounding the whole idea and ultimately its making.  The cast is high caliber.  Anthony Hopkins plays Alfred Hitchcock.  He does an excellent job playing Hitchcock.  Helen Mirren plays Hitch's wife Alma.  She too does an excellent job.  Other cast members include Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh, Jessica Biel as Vera Miles, James D'Arcy as Anthony Perkins, and Ralph Macchio as Joseph Stefano.  Scarlett Johansson is pretty much a carbon copy of Janet Leigh in this movie.  A dead ringer.  Jessica Biel is a dead ringer for Vera Miles, as is James D'Arcy as Anthony Perkins.  The acting by all involved is excellent.

The Blu Ray's picture and sound quality are top notch.

This movie is excellent, better than I expected.  It's great to see a movie made that centers around the greatest director of all time (in my opinion), Alfred Hitchcock.  Psycho was a huge hit, controversial, and groundbreaking for its time.  This movie delves into the behind the scenes drama that took place while getting this movie made.  For those of you not familiar with his work, check out some of his movies.  Start with Psycho, then maybe Vertigo (1958), The Birds (1963), North By Northwest (1959), Rear Window (1954), Strangers On A Train (1951), Rebecca (1940), Shadow Of A Doubt (1943), and Notorious (1946).

I highly recommend Hitchcock.",1382918400,,1623,4.940740740740741
5483150,4,B00ARA4SLU,"This movie was very interesting because of all that Hitchcock went through to make the movie ""Pycho"", since no movie production wanted to handle it back in 1960 because it was too horrifying, he had to mortgage his estate to make the movie.

With scarlet johansen doing a fine job of playing the underrated Janet Leigh. Janet was a fine actress and did a great job in every movie she ever did , she even added class to the silly 'night of the lepus' in 1972!.  It would be interesting to see a biography of Hitchcock but this is still worth watching in hd. Or on blu ray.  You get a slice of his life here and of his wife's life. I liked this one better than ""the girl' which made hitch a little more lecherous. I am sure he was domineering over his starlets , which is touched on in this film. His relationship with Vera Miles is featured in this film as well. She was a starlet that stopped working to take care of her kids for a while.  It's a balanced feature film , in that regard.

She was IN Psycho and where is Saul Bass?; What were the changes in the Alma and Hitch re-cut Psycho? It had to be more than the Herrmann score; This film never quite gets the period as believably as say Hollywoodland. Hopkins had an insurmountable task in portraying Hitchcock. While some scenes and angles produced mildly convincing potrayals the vast majority of scenes had Hitch looking lifeless, stiff and hopelessly over-applied.

Anthony Hopkins, literally transforms himself and Helen Mirren gives the movie the depth as Alma Reville,the neglected but supportive partner of the often jealous Hitchcock. Alma was not just his wife but his creative partner as she gave creative inputs that the classic shower scene with Janet Leigh be scored with piercing violins by Bernard Herrmann.
Hitchcock was a famous director but decides to gamble his reputation and talent by placing his bets on a movie that no one wanted to finance, so he ended financing it himself.
We get some details that went into its making but I wish there were many more, the voyeurism of Hitchcock and his eventual acceptance of his wifes creative talent were good scenes. I felt that it would have been great had there been more details about the man or the making of the movie. Three stars. 9/12/2013",1380412800,,916,4.767295597484277

""Hitchcock"" tries to gin up all kinds of phony drama about the production of ""Psycho,"" actually going so far as to have the spirit of Ed Gein -- the cannibalistic serial killer who inspired Robert Bloch's novel -- turn up in the director's bathroom.

5483172,4,B00ARA4SLU,"'Hitchcock', the film, was a great surprise. It did not seem like a film, I would enjoy, but the actors, Anthony Hopkns ( who by the way, bears a remarkablee likeness in speech, walk, actions and looks ) and Helen Mirren as his wife, Alma.

What we have in this film, is the personal side of life of Hitchcock and his wife. At one point Alma tells someone that Hitch worked for her, she was the boss. She is, in fact, the unheralded writer and fixer of his scripts. She was beautiful and sexy, and, even though it appears their marriage had grown sexless, they were devoted to each other.

The film is also about the making of films in the 'old' days of the studio systems of x-rating and looking at every aspect of the film. Hitchcock was having a dry period in filming, and found a script he liked about a serial killer, which turned into 'Pyscho'. The studio hated the idea, Alma found the subject gross, but Hitchcok was adamant. He had to mortgage their belived home and pool. It says a great deal that Alma agreed to this. Her home was truly her castle. The making of the film and the underlying pinnings of Hitchcock's attractions to his lady stars, is a large part of this film. We are also left to wonder if Alma went astray from time to time.

Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren turn in extraordinary performances. I liked this film a great deal

5483181,5,B00ARA4SLU,"Alfred Hitchcock certainly had a stellar career as a movie director becoming quite possibly the greatest director of all time. If not the greatest then with no question one of the greatest. His body of work is an endless list of outstanding films that are far too many to mention. His film career spanned around 50 years from the mid 1920's to 1976 when he made his last movie. Out of all the great films that were made by Hitchcock there is one in particular that will always stand out among those he made.

The movie ""Hitchcock"" is all about that one film that would become the highpoint in Hitchcock's career. ""Psycho"". It was something radically different from what Hitchcock had directed in the past and there were many who were sure Hitchcock had lost his mind in wanting to make such a gristly story into a movie. As the movie tells however Hitchcock was at a point in his career where he thought people were losing interest in the kind of movies he was making. That of course is not to say he was making bad movies. Far from it. Before ""Psycho"" Hitch had made ""North By Northwest"", certainly one of his better classic films starring Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. Sensing however that the public was starting to look for something different in movies Hitchcock wanted to change direction in the kind of movies he was making.

Hitch had read a book about the real story of Ed Gein, a murderer of at least 2 known women and who also robbed graves for body parts. In addition to Norman Bates from ""Psycho"" Ed Gein would become the inspiration for the character Leatherface from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and Jame Gumb from ""Silence Of The Lambs"". Hitchcock anyway had the inspiration for his next movie. The trick now was getting others to go along with his next project which would not only include Paramount Pictures but his own wife Alma as well. It would not be easy to do and that is what ""Hitchcock"" is about, what Hitchcock had to do in order to make what would become one of the most popular movies ever made. Of course while ""Hitchcock"" is about making the film ""Psycho"" it is at the same time a look behind the scenes in Hollywood at how the movie industry works and how deals are made to casting the right actors for the parts to getting script approval which includes dealing with the censors (my favorite scene in ""Hitchcock"" is when Hitch is talking with a person who is questioning about the shower scene and if the young lady will be naked in the shower. Hitchcock reply with ""No she will be wearing a shower cap"". Certainly a classic Hitchcock comeback.) to dealing with nervous studio heads wanting to see daily shots of what is being filmed. Indeed Hitchcock had to put up with a lot in trying to make ""Psycho"" but of course in the end the film is a total triumph for Hitch revitalizing his career and changing how movies would be made in the future as well.

Of course there is another Hitchcock that this movie is about. Alma. This is as much about her as it is about Alfred. Alma had to put up with a lot with the filming of ""Psycho"". Alma always knew she was an important part in Alfred life, even when he would have an infatuation with whichever leading lady he was working with at the time. ""Psycho"" with its leading lady Janet Leigh would prove different though. Of course in the beginning Alma thought making ""Psycho"" was a big mistake for Alfred to make. In time though she would come around to the project and become the biggest supporter in its making, including going along with coming up with the funds themselves to make ""Psycho"" which would put both of them in a financial hardship without knowing if it would all pay off. In the meantime the pressure is mounting and Alfred's latest infatuation with Janet Leigh becomes to much for Alma and puts a strain on their marriage. A strain to the point her attention turns to a male friend of hers who is a writer and asks her for help with his latest project. When Alfred finds out about this it is his turn to become jealous of what is going on. Of course all works out well in the end for the Hitchcocks. Even though you know how the story will end and the success that ""Psycho"" will become it is still a compelling movie to watch as you see what went on behind the scenes as one of the greatest horror films was being made.

There two reasons why this movie is so interesting to watch. One is Anthony Hopkins in the lead role as Hitchcock. While not I feel a spot on impersonation of Alfred Hitchcock, Hopkins still gives one of his best performances since ""Silence Of The Lambs"" and it doesn't take long as you watch the film to forget it is Hopkins playing Hitchcock and start believing it is Hitchcock himself up there on the screen. The other reason the film is so good is Helen Mirren as Alma. In some ways this is more her movie then Alfred's and certainly rates among one of Helen's greatest acting roles.

I give this movie high recommendation for anyone to watch whether you are a fan of Hitchcock, horror movies or like films about the workings of Hollywood itself. This is a movie anyone can get into and get lost in the story about one of the most important movies that almost wasn't made but in the end was.",1377475200,,5208,4.432150313152401

On the whole, it is HITCHCOCK's fine, distinguished cast that elevates this above your average biopic. Good performances all round, and shoutouts and kudos to Sir Anthony and James D'Arcy! Other pros include great, retro cinematography, a good score and a light, airy, entertaining pace and tone.

Let's talk cons.

So very little of what ""happens"" in this movie ABOUT the shooting of Psycho in 1960 is true. The infamous and utterly brilliant Shower Scene takes the brunt of the blows. Lies and myths abound, from Hitch's usage of cold water to make Leigh scream, to Saul Bass's direction of the scene, to Hitch himself wielding the knife, to even worse; tales of voyeurism, cruelty, obsession, and various odious behaviours. This is simply untrue, and pictures such as HITCHCOCK and THE GIRL paint an inaccurate portrayal of Alfred Hitchcock, arguably the greatest director that cinema has ever seen, or indeed, ever will see.

The screenplay isn't even as ""revealing"" or ""eye-opening"" or ""deep"" as it should be, or thinks it should be, but the result is a light-hearted biopic rather than a heavy one. Another point that I did not like was the inclusion of the scenes with horrific serial killer Ed Gein (basis for Leatherface, Hannibal Lecter, Buffalo Bill, and worse). They didn't really fit the tone of the story, and all the ""demons"" they tried to give Hitchcock came off as cheesy.

But that's not to say I didn't enjoy the film. I did immensely! We need more biopics of classic film directors, and the light-hearted, breezy approach that Sacha Gervasi takes should be applauded, even if the inaccuracies shouldn't. Anthony Hopkins and his distinguished supporting cast give superb performances, and the result is a film, that if not up to Hitch's usual standards, should still be an enjoyable night at the movies.

5483196,3,B00ARA4SLU,"This is the 2-disc release of Hitchcock (2012). It looks at the relationship between Hitchcock and his wife Alma when Psycho was filmed. The picture and audio quality are excellent. There is also a book attached to this film written by Stephen Rebello. Both the film and book suffer from the same problem in that most of the content is public knowledge now. They are both interesting but not particularly groundbreaking anymore since the book was first published in 1990 and other sources cover the events in more detail. Hitchcock is iconic but much more info about him has since come to light. The film tends to show Hitchcock bumbling around while Alma was the real genius. Alma was influential but Hitchcock was in a class of his own. Key players like Bernard Herrmann, Hilton Green, Rita Riggs, John Gavin, Universal, Revue Studios, and even the Bates Motel seem like background figures in this 2012 biographical drama. The film grossed $6 million US domestically. You also get a DVD and a Digital Copy that includes both a downloadable version (for iTunes) as well as an Ultraviolet streaming option.

5483200,4,B00ARA4SLU,"Although I know some things may have been stretched because this is a movie and not a documentary exactly, I really enjoyed this movie. I didn't think it was fake or corny for even 1 moment. The actors chosen were perfect (Anthony Hopkins being the best choice- a perfect Hitchocock). The scenes we see in this movie show Hitchcock's personal life and issues that were haunting him around the time when he decided to direct his arguably most famous movie, Psycho. We got to see the way Hitchcock fell in love with his leading ladies, and how that affected his relationship with his wife.

One of my favorite scenes came at the end where I felt the scriptwriting was perfect. The movie ends with Hitchcock doing his famous ""talking to the audience"" bit. He was speaking as if closing out a short film he had shown. He spoke about how Psycho was his greatest achievement and he was now looking for something even better. Just then, a big, black crow landed on his shoulder as he paused, foreshadowing that The Birds would be his next big movie.

I also was able to see how deep Hitchcock got into his films during the scene where he is directing his leading lady in the shower scene of Psycho. He felt as if she wasn't acting scared enough so he took over the knife from the extra and started making the movements himself towards her. In his head he saw all the things that he was mad about, and he saw himself stabbing them out of anger. All the while, the leading lady was screaming from real fear at Hitchcock's sudden reaction.",1376265600,,1529,4.476702508960574
5483201,4,B00ARA4SLU,"--Before I begin I would like to warn you that this review may contain spoilers.--

 First, I really enjoyed this film. The first time I watched it I wanted to learn more about the great, one and only Alfred Hitchcock. I wanted to re-watch 'Psycho'; that film being the subject the story revolves around. Now, 'Hitchcock' is about more than Hitchcock's search for his next film or the filming of 'Psycho'.  'Hitchcock' explores the relationship between Hitchcock and his films, his worries, his actresses, and (most importantly) his wife, Alma.
 In terms of casting, Anthony Hopkins is the perfect Alfred Hitchcock. From the opening scene when we are first introduced to Hopkins' character and greeted with Hitchcock's signature line, ""Good Evening,"" from his television series, `Hitchcock Presents', the essence of Hitchcock is captured. Helen Mirren plays Alma Hitchcock. Mirren is a phenomenal actress in every part she plays. This is especially true of her portrayal of Alma. She flawlessly captures the love, doubts, insecurities, and longings of her character.
 The story of 'Hitchcock' focuses on the search for the next Hitchcock film and the filming of 'Psycho'. Hitch has just had a successful premiere of 'North by Northwest' and is asked by a reporter, ""...but you're sixty years old. Shouldn't you just quit while you're ahead?"" This leaves Hitch with doubts and a desire to find his next film that will prove his ability to continue to be a part of the industry he influenced so much. That is how Hitchcock came across the novel ""Psycho"" and decided it was just the thing he was looking for.
 One of the things I enjoyed most about the 'Psycho' aspect of this film is how scenes and interactions between Hitch and Ed Gein are added. The opening scene depicts Gein and his brother working on their farm and Gein's murder of his brother. Hitch appears in the scene informing the audience of some of Gein's history and how that influenced and was directly responsible for 'Psycho'. In another scene, Hitchcock is dreaming, confessing all his worries and insecurities; Gein is the person Hitch is speaking to. In this film, Gein represents the darker side of Hitchcock; the side Hitchcock suppresses and expresses only through his work.
 The relationship between Hitch and Alma is another aspect of the film. The devotion and gratitude that Hitchcock felt toward Alma are a big part of the relationship between Alma and Hitchcock in this film. The insecurities of both characters are shown through Alma's struggle to accept Hitch's obsessions with his leading ladies and Hitchcock's jealousy over Alma's friendship and association with Whitfield Cook. When Hitchcock is bedridden and Alma takes over directing a scene in his place so that they may get back on schedule, the film is paying homage to Alma and the genius that Hitchcock believed her to be. They worked together on Hitchcock's film and most of Alma's contribution was not acknowledged.
 Overall, 'Hitchcock' is a film that is about more than Hitchcock's struggle to make 'Psycho' and in the way he intended. It is more of an acknowledgement of Hitch and Alma and their contribution and mastery of the film industry. All parts of Hitchcock are explored in this film, from his obsession with his mother and his actresses to his humor and his love and appreciation of Alma. While many things have been exaggerated for the sake for entertainment and to depict Hitchcock in the way the director viewed him, the film stays true to the important parts of Hitchcock and his history. I think that all the different sides of Hitchcock were portrayed in this film in a way that honors Hitchcock as a man and director. I would recommend this film, because as I mentioned, it made me curious to know more about Hitchcock and re-visit the films created by the master of Suspense.",1376265600,,3838,4.930340557275541
5483222,3,B00ARA4SLU,"Sir Anthony Hopkins portrays Hitchcock's mannerisms of sophisticated eccentricity in a believable manner, creating a likable character I am happy to follow along with through his struggles. The main conflict in the film starts immediately, Hitchcock trying to relive the artistic freedom from his early days before the stifling bureaucracy of the studio became suffocating. Hitchcock wants to create the provocative film ""Psycho"", which really symbolizes his need for freedom and refreshment in that stage of his life and career. I enjoyed how slowly other conflicts began to weave themselves into the main plot, such as Hitchcock's relationship with his wife and infatuation with his blondes. Hitchcock feels betrayed by Vera Miles as she passed him up on a movie offer, choosing family over stardom. The scene where Vera throws up her hands as she is ignored by Hitch shows his feelings of hurt and betrayal about her. Hitchcock's fascination now becomes focused on Janet Leigh. This focus intertwines with the growing conflict in his relationship with his wife, as seen by her insecure expressions while at dinner as Hitchcock glows over Janet. His wife's insecurity becomes amplified and she seeks emotional comfort elsewhere. In the end, Hitchcock and Alma's wife relationship prevails, and their team work is what completes the film and allows it to become the iconic movie it has become. I was pleasantly surprised by the captivating nature all of these little sub conflicts represented and their interdependence in the grander architecture of the plot. I enjoyed the film and recommend it to anyone who enjoys wants to take a glimpse into the artistic character of Hitchcock.",1376265600,2,1683,5.237037037037037
5483223,5,B00ARA4SLU,"This is ultimately about a wife who has good reasons to no longer feel as valued, desired, and appreciated by her husband as she deserves to be.  The temptation to be another man's muse is understandable.  It's brilliant how all the deep seated jealousies, obsessions, and fears of old Hitch himself are imagined in specific scenes of ""Psycho"" and it has a happy ending that never feels forced.",1376265600,2,394,4.779411764705882
5483224,3,B00ARA4SLU,"Hitchcock is an intriguing piece that is worth taking a look at. Since the film took place during the time period of the making of Psycho a story inspired by the famous serial killer Ed Gein, it was quite fitting and an inventive subplot to have Hitchcock gain his own inspiration from the man himself throughout the film. It was also a good way to delve into the psyche of the genius filmmaker who was somewhat disturbed in his own right. Hopkins and Mirren give a stellar performance with their portrayal of Hitchcock and his wife Alma.  The film seems to do a good job showing both the working and personal dynamic between Hitchcock and his wife. It's debatable of how much of that is accurate and how much of it is contrived.

Two great scenes that stand out in the movie; is the one where the shower scene is being filmed and Hitch shows his eccentric style by getting the actors to put on the performance he envisions. The second is where he finds grains of sand on his bathroom floor, evidence that his wife Alma had been spending too much time with her friend at the beach.

As many good qualities this film has it seems to fall short on others. Perhaps this film would have been stronger if it went more in depth into the filming process of Psycho which is essentially what the story is about.  The subplot between Hitch and his wife is interesting however it might have taken away from actually showing the making of his finest masterpiece.  Overall Hitchcock is entertaining with a few surprises but for a true purest this film might be disappointing.",1376179200,,1562,4.524822695035461
5483225,4,B00ARA4SLU,"I really enjoyed this film and it picks up at the most important part of Hitchcock's career, the planning and production of Psycho. It is interesting that the story adds in the actual inspiration of Psycho with the true story of Ed Gein. Adding more of Ed into the film gave a symbolic relationship between Hitchcock and his work. At first, Anthony Hopkins felt like an odd choice for the part of Hitchcock but the more I watched it the more natural he appeared. I thought it was interesting when they are unsuccessfully shooting the shower scene and finally a fed up Hitchcock steps in and has flashes of people he really wants to kill. This is as equally violent and horrifying as the actual film they are trying to create. Another scene that I thought was pure genius is the ending. Hitchcock is explaining that he is not done making films and that he is going to search for inspiration for his next project. Just as he is finishing his sentence a crow lands on his shoulder. This draws an immediate connection to Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds which is now another very popular film created by him.

5483226,3,B00ARA4SLU,"I'm not sure if the fact that I had different expectations going into watching this film whether that unfairly influenced my overall opinion of this film.  I realized this was a story about Hitchcock himself, but I still subconsciously expected more suspense.
Anthony Hopkins really was very good, and some of the story of Hitchcock was really interesting.

But overall the film progressed rather slowly for me.",1376092800,,411,5.119402985074627
5483227,5,B00ARA4SLU,"I enjoyed this narrative expository of Hitchcock's story. I felt it appropriated a tenderness towards Hitchcock's human nature, instead of positioning him in any sort of wholly negative or positive light. His seemingly cold solidarity separated him from most of Hollywood through his career, but this film illuminates the humanism of his character.

Hitchcock clearly struggles with self-understanding. He exudes a need for power, a trait widely recognized by those who worked with him. He struggled with narcissism, and expected 100% from everybody always. One of the most moving scenes of the story is when Alma challenges the basis of his accusation that she is having an affair and not supporting him. Though a strongly passive character until that point, she unleashes her perspective on how deeply she supports Hitchcock through all his trials. The audience is allowed to see a vulnerability in Hitchcock as he goes through the realization that his accusation has truly offended the one person who he values above all else, and that it was based out of an insecurity from his own tendency to have wandering eyes.

The same sort of raw humanism is seen in the scene where he takes over the stabbing scene from Psycho. Though I'm not positive that it stays perfectly true to history, Hitchcock's insipid imagination placed Alma in the shower and he stabs relentlessly out of a seething detest in her potential to betray him.

Lastly, as an artist, Hitchcock placed a lot of weight in the power of music. As he explored the horror medium, he found it brought him great joy.  The scene of Psycho's premiere, where Hitchcock waits from the climactic shower scene, he moves melodically to the sound of the audience screaming. He does not move to the tempo of the musical soundtrack of the piece, but instead to the rhythm of reaction. This is a powerful expression of Hitchcock's connection to his work, on many artistic and spiritual levels.",1376092800,2,1942,4.966153846153846

5483229,4,B00ARA4SLU,"I just took a class about Hitchcock so I was excited to see this movie. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, but I'm not sure how historically accurate it is. Anthony Hopkins did a great job with his impersonation of Hitch, but he talked a little too fast. The story was interesting. I can understand why the movie covers Psycho so intensely, since that's really the film we think of first when we think of Hitchcock, but I was hoping the movie would be more of a biography about his life, and it wasn't.  His wife Alma (Helen Mirren) did an excellent job, and really stole the movie for me both with her fabulous acting, as well as her excellent portrayal of one of Hitch's biggest influences. The crowning scene of the movie (big props to Hopkins) for me was when Hitch tries to show Norman Bates, during filming, how to express more emotion whilst stabbing the lovely Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johannson). It really showed of Hopkin's acting skill, as well as reminding the audience of Hitchcock's control issues. I also liked how, throughout the movie, Hitch maintained a dialogue with the original murderer from the book Psycho is based on. I think that all brilliant minds have a little bit of crazy in them, and although the history books now seem to omit this part of Hitch's personality, it was probably evident at the time. The score is well done for the film (Danny Elfman strikes again, and you can totally tell it's him from the first note you hear), but March of the Marionettes (Hitch's ""signature"" theme) is played just a little too fast. After hearing it over and over again, the altered tempo really bothered me. But enough nitpicking - read a book about Hitchcock, see some of his films, and then watch this movie and judge for yourself.",1376006400,,1752,4.615384615384615

5483231,4,B00ARA4SLU,"I congratulate who had the idea of making this movie. Witnessing Hitchcock at work is a privilege, even if it is pretend. Anthony Hopkins was so good that I almost didn't notice him. Only once in a while, on a very rare occasions, Hopkins displayed a gesture or said something in a tone of voice that reminded me that Hopkins was behind that mask. It was very subtle, almost unnoticeable.

My only criticism is the scenes with the dialog between Hitchcock and his super-ego. It's just that it became commonplace on biographical pictures.",1375747200,2,537,4.774193548387097

5483251,4,B00ARA4SLU,"'Hitchcock' is a fascinating little feature film. Not much use to those not interested in the movies. For me I was enchanted by the mosaic of making a motion picture.

Not just any motion picture but a movie which has so much spin attached to it has a life of its own. The complexity of the book called 'Psycho' is intensified by the personal tensions of Mr and Mrs Hitchcock. Loved the petty politics of the actors of the time. And having the serial killer psychoanalyse the director is a twist I think even the master would appreciate. Whilst dead.

Much better than many of the reviews I've come across. Certainly not just about the making of Psycho. It's deeper than deep should go. All the way to blondes in towers.",1374364800,2,720,4.488549618320611

There has never been another like him and never will, as he molds the top stars into characters, I don't believe they thought they could play.  The Master is just that a never ending wonder to the American audience and to every generation after us will come the thrill of seeing the Best of the Best Suspense and Thriller Movies ever shown to any audience, as Alfred Hitchcock will live on forever through his work on films and the audiences that so enjoy his Movies.

Sir Anthony Hopkins surely became Hitch, and Helen Miren was his wife Alma.  The only one missing was his devoted daughter and that would of even made the movie more believable for us all to enjoy.  Bravo for the Movie ""Hitchcock"".............

5483255,4,B00ARA4SLU,"Hitchcock is an entertaining film based upon his time around the making of Psycho. It stars Helen Mirren as AlmaReville(Hitchcock's wife) and Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock. Hitch has the desire to make a new more shocking movie as he feels the need to change his approach to win a larger audience. In Psycho the famous scene is the shower scene where Marion Crane(Scarlett Johansson/Janet Leigh) is killed off in the first half hour. We also see Vera Miles(Jessica Biel)playing Marion's sister. She remains in contract to Hitch although he feels she let him down by becoming pregnant 2 weeks before the making of Vertigo. Anthony Hopkins plays Hitch as a grumpy soul but not unlikeable,liking his chocolate cakes and shots of whiskey,to the annoyance of Alma. He also is shown to get `visits' from Ed Gein,the psychopath killer,upon whom Robert Bloch's Psycho is based. He seems to have imaginary conversations with him.

Not an impersonation more an impression,Hopkins bulks large,stands imperious he seems like a cross between Churchill and Tommy Cooper(""Hitch to you. Hold onto the cock""to Janet Leigh).Alma played with intelligence and humour by Mirren is shown to be Hitch's main creative partner(lifelong) and support. She also has a writer friend, Whit(Danny Huston)she is doing a script with,which causes Hitch to have sleepless nights as he fears she'll leave him. To compound problems the film is 2 days behind schedule and is $60,000 over budget,and Hitch is having trouble with the MPAA censor about nudity and stabbing,who threatens to deny it a certificate. He also becomes ill with stress and collapses and Alma stands in for his director's role for a day or two. Only Hitchcock believed in this project,nobody else did. He can't get finance for the film and has to mortgage his house and swimming pool to pay for it. Alma asks him ""why this film?"".She also helps the stillborn film gain shape in the cutting room.

We remember the version of The Girl on TV which showed Hitch making The Birds where he comes across as goulish and predatory. This is not like that. It's kinder without the rough edges. It plays upon some of the gossip where he gets too close to his leading ladies(spying on Vera Miles) and Alma allows these flirtations, which are a fantasy. I liked that pairing of two superb actors,Mirren and Hopkins,who have never worked together. Johansson is excellent as the malleable Leigh. I didn't think the Ed Gein `visits' worked. So,there's no character development,but Hitch is shown as a master shaman who depended a lot on his wife's input to each film. No images from the actual film Psycho are shown. James Darcy's Anthony Perkins is the best but most underused impersonation. Worth a look,with some good music. So no shocks,but good fun.",1374105600,,2770,4.967672413793103
5483256,4,B00ARA4SLU,"Recently, on one of the ""Premium"" channels, I saw a another movie about Hitchcock set during the filming of ""Birds.""  I can't remember what it was called, but it seemed to portray the Great Alfred as having a quite different personality that I just don't remember seeing during the TV series.

This movie with Anthony Hopkins, seems more to be a truer characterization of the man I remember.  I loved ""Lifeboat"", and thought that film was his masterpiece, though I have watched ""Birds"" numerous times through the years.  This new video is set during the time of the filming of ""Psycho"", which of course is a horror masterpiece, so unlike what passes for ""horror"" at theatres today.

Anthony Hopkins plays the role, and he is an actor that can completely remove ""himself"" from a role to the point that you don't know who is playing the part without reading the credits!  A truly great actor.  The girl from ""Iron Man"" plays Janet Leigh, (Can't remember her name right now), along with a lady that played his wife entirely differently from the film on the Premium channel show I recently saw.

5483279,3,B00ARA4SLU,"The title suggests a career-spanning biography, but Hitchcock covers the life of the famous movie director (Alfred) only during the conception and production of Psycho. In that sense, it's a movie about the making of a movie; one that happens to be considered one of the best, or at-least most groundbreaking, in cinema history. America was full of prudes back in 1959, so the famous shower scene, which is quite tame compared to the movie murders of today, shocks the theater audience to screams, as intended. Psycho went on to become Alfred Hitchcock's most successful film. This behind-the-scenes retrospective, which spends too much time away from the on-set action to focus on his troubled marriage, is comparatively pointless.

5483298,5,B00ARA4SLU,"I love Hitchcock movies. They are much like an Edgar Allan Poe poem or story-- well-crafted, captivating, stylistic. With som much schlock out there, it's nice to pop a Hitchcock film into the DVD player and spend an afternoon with the master of suspense. That's why I wanted to see this movie.

Hitchcock, the man, was complicated and flawed, a man obsessed with a certain image of womanhood that he used again and again in his movies. And he was a bear of a director. Anthony Hopkins brings Hitchcock to life and does a marvelous job of capturing his essence. Helen Mirren as the wife shows the other side of Hitchcock that few of us were privy to-- a woman who understood the man she was married to, awoman who probably would have had her own successful career in Hollywood in another time, and a woman who was partnered with a man of genius who gave strength to that genius.

This is the tale of Psycho-- how it came about, how it came to be made. Hopkins captures the man obsessed with his falling star and his need to save himself financially by re-inventing himself and the movies in the process. Constrained by the movie censors, he crafts one of the most suspenseful horror tales captured on film and he does it masterfully. But that mastery doesn't come easily and that's what this movie reveals-- the man behind the movie and the woman behind the man.

Watching his movies and then listening to the behind-the-scenes commentary by associates and his daughter, it's easy to get a feel for the man. But this movie does a better job of revealing the real man-- flawed and driven by ego, reined-in by a wife who may be more partner now than wife, Hitchcock does a great job of showing us that genius is sometimes born of desperation and that fear of failure touches even the great.",1372204800,2,1788,4.529411764705882

And Helen Miren did such a wonderful job of being the ""supporting role"" while at the same time having her own spotlight - I never knew anything before about Mrs. Hitchcock (or even that there was one!), but she had me loving her as much as her husband and appreciating the role Mrs. Hitchcock played in the success of her husband.

Interestingly enough there was a lot of resistance to said picture and the film focuses on those elements. A very good depiction by Anthony Hopkins of the master director even if not brilliant nor superb. Intriguing interplay between Hopkins and Helen Mirren, who plays the wife of Hitchcock. Big urban legend question: did he really make Janet Leigh scream with a real knife? Also starring Jessica Biel, Scarlett Johansson, Kurtwood Smith and others.

I found his performance uneven and a few times his voice sounded more like Hannibal Lector than Hitchcock.  Having seen most of Hopkins' films, this is the first time in decades I wasn't wowed by his performance.  Helen Mirren steals the show as Alma Hitchcock, the woman behind the man who never got the credit she rightfully deserved.  Mirren is strong and subtle, while Hopkins overacts and turns Hitch into somewhat of a caricature. The movie tells you very little about Hitchcock the man, and more about the evolution of his film Psycho.  It's entertaining to be sure and alludes to the rumors about his love for his leading ladies, which has been in the press for years.  Hitch was one of the most famous directors of all time, and so it was surprising that he was held hostage by the studio to make changes to Psycho.

Both Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren do an excellent job in their roles. The makeup on Hopkins makes you almost believe it is Hitchcock himself in the movie.

How does jealousy play out in a marriage like his? And guess what, his wife was a very important player in his art, doing a lot of the editing. Performances are top-notch, with Anthony Hopkins, Helen Mirren, and Scarlett Johannsen as Janet Leigh (really spectacular--I had not really appreciated her beauty until this film.)

5483381,4,B00ARA4SLU,"""Sacha Gervasi's Hitchcock is one example of an potential Oscar-nominated film that really should have got more attention than how the critics provided a mixed reaction to it. The film, as a whole, focuses on Alfred Hitchcock and his often unheard-of wife Alma, working on the kerfuffle that was the 1960 classic Psycho.

Much in the vein and constraints of a TV drama, the film is surprisingly effective as a film being extremely yet darkly hilarious and convincing with Anthony Hopkins' excellent (yet facially uneven resemblance) take on Hitchcock's witty, sardonic banter. A fine piece of filmmaking his work is and this underrated biopic that is which, in a strange way, kind of embodies a Simpsons Treehouse of Horror madness and disturbing attitude about murder, voyeurism, obsession, and mendacity. While the film was not intended as a comedy, the film is intentionally bizarre and melodramatic to a point where how Hitchcock decided to deal with the MPA (Motion Picture Association, the pioneers of American film censorship).

Hopkins tackles Hitchcock's unflappable confidence, his weakness of wandering eyes with his blonde starlets and his love for wife Alma.  Mirren deftly displays Alma's determined support and insecurity.  Supporting players add some nice moments:  Scarlett Johansson, Jessica Biel, James D'Arcy (an uncanny Double for Anthony Perkins) and Toni Collette.
Look for a quick cameo from Ralph Macchio as screenwriter Joseph Stefano.
Hitchcock's difficulty in getting PSYCHO on screen is intriguing and wish there had been more attention to this storyline.

5483426,2,B00ARA4SLU,"That was my first thought after viewing this film. A large part of 'Hitchcock's' troubles lie in the fact that the team behind it could not find a singular voice. Is this a docu-drama on the making of Psycho? A commentary on Hitchcock's strange mental state? A torrid romance picture about he and his wife, Alma, and their marriage difficulties? Or was it just another episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents? No, 'Hitchcock' decided it wanted to be all of these things. The trouble with this lack of focus is the movie couldn't go very deep in any regard. I gleamed little detail from the production around Psycho or even about Hitchcock himself. The script was soft from beginning to end, and albeit easily watchable, my final take was of disappointment. The acting is fine, however. Helen Mirren could be called the British Meryl Streep because she is absolutely thrilling in any project she partakes in. Jessica Biel was particularly interesting to watch as Vera Miles; I would almost be willing to tag her as the scene-stealer in 'Hitchcock.' Scarlett Johansson was bland and forgettable and Anthony Hopkins take on the formidable Hitchcock was overbearing at times, playing to almost comedic effect, which certainly did not help the loose focus of the movie.

5483454,5,B00ARA4SLU,"The opening scene of Hitchcock met with erupting laughter from the theater audience. Ed Gein--the inspiration for the novel Psycho--killed his brother with a shovel to the head in a most comedic way; after which the camera panned to Alfred Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins) who speaks directly to the audience and prepares them to go behind the scenes of the making of the Psycho movie. The film captures a slice of Hitch's (a nickname) life, limiting itself to his efforts to bring Psycho to the big screen--from casting and screenplay-drafting to its debut.

Hitch's strained relationship with his wife Alma Reville (Helen Mirren), also an accomplished director, takes central stage, relegating the actual filming of Psycho to a supporting role.

At first, we do not realize there is any problem between Hitch and Alma, other than the fact that they sleep in separate beds yet in the same room. (I'm not sure whether this is a nod to historical idiosyncrasy or a throwback to the I Love Lucy days of censorship where even insinuations of the marriage bed was forbidden.) But Alma decides to help a man named Whit Cook with his screenplay and is increasingly enthralled by him, driven away by Hitch's obsession with finding the perfect blond to fantasize over. Alma and Hitch eventually discover that their fantasies are illusions and Alma invests all of herself back into the Psycho production.
Alma had a fantasy of romance that involved the a melding of two creative minds as they typed away on the back porch of an idyllic beach house while sipping wine. This fantasy is crushed when she finds him with a young woman in their hideaway. Hitch's fantasy fails when he can't catch the perfect blond who has beauty and mystery that can last indefinitely. Janet Leigh (the lead female of Psycho played here by Scarlett Johansson) is a Hitchcock admirer, but keeps her distance and remains professional in their work relationship. We also learn that Vera Miles (another actress in Psycho played by Jessica Biel) was originally a ""Hitchcock girl,"" but decided to get married and have a child.

In both these cases, Hitchcock as a love story, drama, and romantic comedy offers a stunningly realistic portrayal of love in marriage. Hitch and Alma are old and unattractive, looking for something fresh and novel, but end up discovering that such a wild goose chase results in only the bitter taste of disappointment. This is refreshing and presents a perspective on romance that runs counter to the common Hollywood line.

But Hitchcock goes beyond a mere love story--though it would have been a good enough movie had it stuck to just that. The film is also a study of Hitchcock's philosophy of film, or at least an inquiry into why thrillers and horror movies have such a wide appeal (the very appeal Hitchcock played on so often in his movies). The answer may lie less in the ability of the filmmaker as it does in our innate human resonance with murder.

In the opening scene described above, Hitch observes that brother has been killing brother since Cain and Abel. This biblical allusion acts as an anchor for the rest of Hitchcock. Hitch describes this human fascination with gruesome death a number of times throughout the film. More chillingly, Ed Gein makes an appearance in the film on several occasions; first as Hitch's psychiatrist, then offering advice and insights much like an alter ego.

On one hand, this may be a tribute to Hitchcock's artistry of enmeshing himself into the twisted psyche of his characters; yet there is a literal parallel between Hitch and Gein. This reaches a climax in the infamous shower scene of blood-curling-screams-and-flashing-knife fame. Janet Leigh is failing to impress and Hitch decides to take the knife into his own hands, which gets the response from Janet that he desires: terror. As Hitch slashes the air with the knife, a variety of characters take Janet's place in rapid succession: the Paramount Pictures representative that has been giving him a hard time; Whit Cook, the scoundrel wooing his wife.

Hitchcock was refreshing in its originality, depth, appropriate exploration of mature themes, and a surprisingly biblical worldview. I highly recommend it.

5483470,4,B00ARA4SLU,"I don't know much about Alfred Hitchcock, other than the movies he left us with. That's why I was so interested in seeing this biographical drama. When I found out that Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren were involved, I was tempted to see ""Hitchcock"" the week it opened in theaters. I missed that opportunity, and the remainder of its run had one evening showing per day, so I eventually decided to wait for the Blu-ray. Reviews have been disappointing, but, as always, I trusted my instincts and decided to make up my own mind.

Hopkins doesn't try to mimic Hitchcock's voice exactly, but he does employ the deliberate mode of speech that most of us are familiar with. The makeup isn't entirely convincing either, but it's good enough to get the job done. Hopkins plays the director quite seriously, and I felt that Hitchcock's playful nature was a little underused.

What the movie attempts to do is take us back to the making of Psycho, which was released in 1960. Paramount's bosses were seeking something similar to North by Northwest, which had been released in 1959, but Hitchcock wanted to try something new. We learn how the project was chosen, and the sacrifices that Hitchcock and wife Alma made to make it happen. It's an interesting look at a brief time in a career which spanned more than half a century.

The movie gets a lot of things right; It looks and feels like 1960, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Biel manage to resemble film stars of that era, and the casting in general is excellent.

I've been thinking about why reviews were so negative, and I've come to the conclusion that it is a movie which will appeal to a very specific audience. It's not a gripping drama, and there isn't much excitement. This is a story intended for movie buffs or fans of Hitchcock. If you want to know more about his character, and how movies are made, this has something for you. Character studies are hard to get right, and the movie is far from perfect. But I was engrossed for 90 minutes, and enjoyed learning how some of the events came to pass. The marketing for Psycho was inventive, and contributed to its early success. Some of that story is shown here.

The biggest source of conflict in the movie is Hitchcock's relationship with Alma. We learn something about their home life, and ultimately how important she was to his success. There's an explosive scene, just over an hour into the movie, in which Mirren's performance is elevated from good to great. It reminded me somewhat of the scene in Doubt, where Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman finally confront each other.

Seeing ""Hitchcock"" makes me want to watch Psycho again, and I will do so in the near future. I've also been watching the excellent Bates Motel, starring Vera Farmiga and Freddie Highmore, and would recommend that as a good companion piece to Psycho if you're a fan.

""Hitchcock"" works for its intended audience, but many people will find it lacking. It's a quiet movie, focusing on characters and details, rather than intensely dramatic scenes. I'm not sure what moviegoers were expecting. Perhaps they were hoping for a detailed look at Hitchcock's entire career? Lincoln fell flat for some viewers for similar reasons. If you enjoy seeing good acting, and have any interest in the man, ""Hitchcock"" is worth your time.

5483484,2,B00ARA4SLU,"I'm a huge fan of Alfred Hitchcock.  I think most people are, or even if they aren't they can certainly appreciate the impact he's had on film in general.  Fewer names are as known as Hitchcock's, and fewer films are as associated with that name as `Psycho'.  So, when you have a film devoted to exposing what went on behind the scenes of the filming of that monumental film, you have my attention.

Sadly, this doesn't all work out like I had expected.

The film shuffles a few angles to try and compose a well-rounded look at Hitch and his process, but it doesn't all come together like it thinks it does.  Opening with a shot of Ed Gein killing his brother and then having Hitchcock infamously narrate the proceedings, `Hitchcock' opens with promise.  Moving from there to the aftermath of success from Hitchcock's `North by Northwest' and the struggle to find something new and exciting, we see him set his sights on `Psycho', a novel inspired by Gein's killings and something far too violent and grisly for Paramount to accept.  So, Hitchcock decides to fund it himself, and he goes to work.  We see his relationship with his wife, Alma, and her need to more recognition and purpose and the fact that her friend Whitfield Cook continually tries to woo her.  We see his onset antics, his paternal relationship with Leigh and his vile contempt for Vera Miles.  We see him fight with his inner demons as well as the studio, and yet it all feels so thankless.

That is really the only word that comes to mind when I think of this film.  It's thankless.  Nothing really stands out as noteworthy, other than those sets and costumes.  The performances are uniformly decent, but no one really stands out other than maybe Mirren, who shades Alma in a way that feels lived in.  Johansson, Biel, Collette and D'Arcy are barely there at all, Huston is certainly a stereotype with little meat to hold him together and Hopkins looks too much like DeVito's Penguin to make much of a real impact.  The interwoven storylines, particularly those involving Gein, serve as an interesting concept and yet don't really add much to the overall film itself.  I felt like Hitch was never really explored.  All of the horror stories revolving around his domineering, egotistical and sexist ways was never presented as anything more than a fleeting possibility.

It is always inspiring when an artist puts everything on the line and it works. Psycho paved the way for the enitre genre of serial killer films. It seems like Anthony Hopkins playing Hitchcock comes full circle from the role that made him the most famous in Silence of the Lambs. Anthony Hopkins did a great job playing Hitchcock. Helen Mirren has a type cast. She played Hitchcock's wife in that same spunky old lady type cast she always plays. Hmmm, whatever. It fit in the role. But it was not Hitchcock's wife and we do not know anything more about her than before the movie started. We only saw Helen Mirren on the screen. Ok, it is called acting.

5483501,4,B00ARA4SLU,"Although he doesn't look like him Anthony Hopkins really captured the personality, mannerisms, and presence of Alfred Hitchcock in this movie.  I didn't know very much about Alma, his wife, but Helen Mirren as always does a good job of playing the  ""woman behind a successful man.""  I had no idea that she was a film maker in her own right and she certainly brought that talent to light in the scenes where she takes over on the set when Hitchcock becomes ill.  The other stars I didn't like so much. Scarlet Johannsen as Janet Leigh--well there's no comparison as far as I'm concerned. However she was portrayed as  the girl next door type in the movie like the scene when Janet hands over a bag of candy corn ""for Mr. Hitchcock"" and Alma says, ""Thank you for being professional, Janet.""  I guess Alma thought that Ms. Leigh was unlike the other blond leading ladies that ""Hitch"" adored!  The man who played Anthony Perkins aka Norman Bates was kind of insipid in his role.  But it was interesting to hear him during the interview with Hitchcock as he poured out his inner thoughts of who he was and how he related to the role of Bates.  I wasn't familiar with Whitfield Cook, either, and there really doesn't seem to be much out there about his career as a screen writer.  In the film, that is made evident as Hitchcock didn't think much of him either as well as being jealous of him.  That's another aspect of this film that I liked.  In all the scenes with Hitchcock present one sees how his mind works and how he fantasizes his thoughts about people and situations.  I was reminded of other Hitchcock movies as I watched this unfold.  He definitely was an amazing man but it must've  been totally difficult to live with him!",1366329600,,1729,4.496794871794871

5483506,3,B00ARA4SLU,"""Hitchcock"" is a semi-fictional account of how the Master of Suspense created ""Psycho,"" one of the most suspenseful and influential films ever made, under the increasingly difficult circumstances. Filmed with a quirky sense of humor, as seen in the film's opening ""murder"" scene, ""Hitchcock"" remains entertaining throughout, even though Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Alfred Hitchcock is often (and intentionally perhaps) overshadowed by that of his wife Alma Reville played by Helen Mirren.

With period details and effective acting from the stars, Sacha Gervasi's bio-pic keeps the story afloat, but rarely delves into the darker side of the genius filmmaker who chose a Robert Bloch novel about a psychopathic murderer as a follow-up to ""North by Northwest."" Hitchcock's interaction with the character of Ed Gein, inspiration for Norman Bates, borders on pretentiousness or even boredom.

""Hitchcock"" attempt to pay overdue respect to Alma, Alfred's collaborator behind the creation of ""Psycho."" It is good to know their unsung collaboration, and the relationship between Alma and Alfred is convincing and often fun with low-key humor, but I don't think the soap opera-ish subplot is the right way to explore their relationship that I believe was more complicated than shown here.

Director Sacha Gervasi, best known for his critically acclaimed documentary ""Anvil! The Story of Anvil,"" did a decent job in making a semi-bio pic of one of the most famous cultural icons of the last century, but perhaps you shouldn't expect something insightful.",1366156800,,1547,5.4375

5483531,3,B00ARA4SLU,"With the success of the EVIL DEAD remake I wonder if young movie goers will understand the shock and outrage that came about with the initial release of Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO. In 1960 this film stunned audiences around the world with what was then extreme footage. Compared to today's films it was nothing but that's the thing about classic films. To watch them and to get out of them what the film maker intended you have to place yourself back at that time rather than view it from today's standards.

But apparently there was plenty going on behind the scenes with the creation of PSYCHO as well and that is the story behind the new DVD release HITCHCOCK. Not only that the film is also a love story of a great director and the woman that helped him reach the pinnacle of his career. The two themes work side by side to tell an interesting story that holds your interest from start to finish.

The film opens with Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins) looking for a new project having just finished with the release of NORTH BY NORTHWEST to rather tame reviews. His wife Alma (Helen Mirren) is trying to get him to work with an old friend, Whitfield Cook (Danny Huston), who has a new book in the making. But Hitchcock is searching for something no one expects, no one has seen. Eventually he comes across something other studios are bypassing, a popular book called PSYCHO.

Based on the true life story of Ed Gein, a small town man who seemed rather easygoing but who was cannibalizing corpses and using body parts to decorate his home, Hitchcock sees something unique here. The problem is no studio will back the picture with the funds necessary to make it. Discussing this at home Hitchcock and Alma decide to make the picture using their own funds. If the film is a success they can thumb their noses at the studio heads. If it fails, they lose all.

The production story told here revolves around Hitchcock's obsession with the blonde haired beauties that always took center stage in his films. While he never touched, he often found himself entranced by their beauty to the extent that he often times ignored the one woman who supported him from the start of his career to its end.

On the love story side we are witness to Alma's seemingly friendly interest in Whitfield. Working together in his secret beach house their efforts are truly platonic. Problems arise when Hitchcock finds Alma spending more time working there than on his project. His suspicions increase the more she's away to the point he actually becomes jealous, much the same feelings Alma has as he ogles the blondes in his films. Beneath the anger both have about their particular situations there is a deep love that lasted until their deaths.

The film is an interesting look behind the scenes of what became the biggest hit that Hitchcock had in his long career, a success he never exceeded. The main thing that makes it work is the performances by both lead actors here. Mirren offers a woman who loves her husband deeply yet feels ignored both by him and those who don't realize just how much she contributed to his success and she does it in both subtle and non-subtle ways. Hopkins turns in another outstanding performance as well. Where he could have simply done a caricature of Hitchcock he instead gives us the nuances that the man was known for but also displays the complexity and insecurity behind the genius that was there.

The movie was released but sparingly so to theaters and has received little push on the DVD market as well. That's sad because my guess is there are few young people today who know exactly who Hitchcock was and the amazing films he made. Ask and if you're lucky they may know PSYCHO but not the other films he is known for. This movie would make a great starting point to get them interested in the man and his films. It's entertaining and informative and leaves you wanting more.",1365897600,,3894,4.626628075253256

5483535,4,B00ARA4SLU,"All the actors in this movie were stellar, but Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hitchcock was amazing.  He looked the part, sounded the part . Hopkins was more Hitchcock than Hitchcock himself.

Another thing that was unique/interesting about the movie was Hitchcock's obsession with the real-life basis for the Psycho movie, Ed Gein.  This obsession was shown in dream sequences where Hitchcock interacted with Gein.  These scenes were both gruesome and funny.  Hitchcock's marital problems with his wife Alma (played by Helen Mirren who also gave a stellar performance), were also a highlight of the movie.  These scenes were touching, heart-breaking and at time hilarious.

5483536,1,B00ARA4SLU,"We only have the word of the credits to believe John J. McLaughlin  based his screenplay on Stephen Rebello's superb book ""Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho""

""Hitchcock"" plays so fast and loose with the facts that throughout a screening, viewers with some knowledge of the backstory of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece are tempted to periodically  shout out 'what the hell are they talking about?""

Rebello's book, published in the early 90's has enough factual anecdotes in it for five decent screenplays...this amalgam of nonsense and fantasy does justice to none of them.

Giving Anthony Hopkins jowls and putting him a fat suit doesn't make him convincing (though he certainly tries)...maybe the producers were so enamored of the fact they signed Helen Mirren to play Alma, they felt they had to rewrite history just to strengthen her role and give the film some kind of bizarre balance.

Yes Hitchock valued Alma's opinion, yes he relied her on judgment, but she did not have a hand in rewriting Joseph Stefano's screenplay...she didn't rush to the set to oversee the Martin Balsam murder scene when Hitchcock fell ill, and to anyone's knowledge she didn't participate in the reediting of the original cut to make it 'showable'...

The innacuracies are endless.....

Alma suggesting they use Bernie Herrmann's screaming strings during the shower scene....(Hitchcock's decision once he heard Hermann's score)
Alma revealing Janet Leigh 'blinks' on the bathroom floor (what she DID say was ""Hitch..you can't ship it...Janet Leigh gulps"")
Alma suggesting they kill off the leading lady in the first half hour (Hitch's idea)
Alma suggested Tony Perkins for Norman Bates (again Hitch suggested the idea to Joe Stefano)

Yes movies based on historical fact are always granted poetic license, but in the case of ""Hitchcock"" the poetic license destroys what could have been a great movie.

By ignoring the actual shooting of 'Pyscho' and concentrating on some kind of soap opera version of ""Al and Alma,"" the filmmakers suck the blood (so to speak) right out of the story.

A really good film could be centered around Hitchcock and the making of his groundbreaking film.....""Hitchcock"" misses by a few country miles.

On the good side, it is a nice recreation of 1960.  On the bad side, there's everything else:  Hopkins' makeup was so distracting and so confining that he was severely limited in showing emotion;  he looked like a mannequin.  Even his usually expressive eyes were squeezed and lifeless under the makeup as was the man's sly, dry sense of humor.  Neither Alfred nor Alma were particularly likable and I found their story dull.  The ""Psycho"" cast don't get a chance to shine; they're just paraded in and out with little to say or do and they didn't look like their famous counterparts.

There certainly is some of that but the true treasure in this film is the look inside his relationships and his passions. This film is supremely interesting and moving. Watch it. Go. Now.

5483587,4,B00ARA4SLU,"This was a pleasant surprise, but seeing these two stars together is a guarantee of quality. The script gives them lots to play with, and play they do; their relationship is quite believable and touching as well. Gervasi directs very well, top notch in fact and unexpectedly coming from the guy who did the Anvil movie. It was great, but who knew he could direct a straight feature so tightly? A name to watch.

I found the story entertaining and informative, and loving Hitch but not knowing this whole tale gave me plenty to think about. Hopkins gives a great performance, but Mirren is even finer as Alma. Their connection is real and carries the film easily, and the nice turns by Johanssen and Biel add to the fun.

As for the blu-ray, it looks good, decent transfer, and over an hour of extras, a few docs, etc. But one scary thing Fox did here, which likely heralds a new era of scamosity, is package the BD and dvd together. You can't just buy either, which sucks for dvd viewers, and frankly the whole dvd/BD combo is a rip and is now standard; how many blu-ray viewers still want a dvd? Very few is my guess, but they print one up for ten cents and then charge an extra five or ten clams for it. Oh well, their loss, because it keeps me from buying most BDs. I rented this, as with most, and if they get rid of rentals, which they are trying to do with the whole cloud deal, I'll just stick with netflux.

I'm guessing Hitch would agree. He didn't like getting ripped off by the studios either.

But that aside, fine movie and well worth seeing for fans of Hitch or either of the two leads, who are among the best still working in film today.",1364860800,,1652,4.319354838709677

5483591,4,B00ARA4SLU,"An unusual film ""Hitchcock"" is a bit of biography, a bit of a ""making of"" and quite a bit of fiction surrounding the Hitchcock's classic 1960 film ""Psycho"". If taken with a grain of salt, ""Hitchcock"" is an enjoyable mixture of fact and fiction that hinges on the performances of Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock, Helen Mirren as his wife (and uncredited collaborator) Alma and Danny Huston as Whitfield Cook a writer who worked with the Hitch's during the 1940's. All three give great performances and Hopkins focuses less on imitating Hitchcock and more on developing his character as he begins to see serial killer Ed Gein while preparing and shooting ""Psycho"".

The introduction of an affair that Alma may or may not have had with Cook (those events supposedly occurred in the late early 50's nearly a decade before ""Psycho"" as Cook was working on ""Strage Fright"" and ""Strangers on a Train""). According to Hitchcock biographer Patrick McGillian Cook may have been gay (based on information obtained from his journals--Cook reportedly was involved with Sumner Elliot much later in life).

Even if ""Hitchcock"" is far from factual, it manages to be an enjoyable romp.

The Blu-ray looks marvelous with a top notch transfer from Fox. Colors pop and detail is extremely sharp.

The audio is quite good as well and is provided in English, Spanish, French with subtitles in English and Spanish

Fans who pick this up for the DVD should be aware that none of the special features are included on the DVD included in the Blu-ray combo pack.

The Blu-ray has some nice special features including: a deleted Scene, a variety of featurettes focusing on ""Hitch and Alma"", Danny Elfman (who provides a very good score that compliments the Herrmann bits and pieces included from ""Psyho"")as well as featurettes that focus on the cast and director Sacha Gervasi's decision to make the film.

The most informative extra is the commentary by director Gervasi with author Stephen Rebello who's book on the making of ""Psycho"" provided the basis for this fictionalized account on the making of the film.

While not exactly 100% factual, ""Hitchcock"" isn't unlike other Hollywood biographies in how it takes liberties with the facts to create a good drama. As long as you keep in mind that this isn't like a documentary on Hitch and the making of ""Psycho"" you can enjoy the film.",1364774400,,2354,4.896984924623116
5483592,4,B00ARA4SLU,"""Hitchcock"" is a fun movie. It is well shot, has a tight story and fantastic performances delivered with an utter joy that is impossible to miss. It is not perfect, being that it is based upon a real person and real events, but so much of the spirit and wit of Alfred Hitchcock is found here that the liberties taken are easy to excuse. I have not enjoyed watching a ""bio pic"" of this kind in years and Anthony Hopkins has finally come alive again in his role as good ol' ""Hitch"". I cannot remember how long ago it was that I was able to watch Anthony Hopkins and forget that I was watching Anthony Hopkins. Here he exudes sheer glee and an intuitiveness about his character in every scene that pays off in spades. Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh, Jessica Biel as Vera Miles, and James D'Arcy as Anthony Perkins are used sparingly but very effectively and Helen Mirren is spectacular as Hitchcock's faithful yet long suffering wife Alma Reville.

The story centers on the period in Hitchcock's life when he was making his horror masterwork ""Psycho"". The book, based on the demented murders committed by Ed Gein, was making a slowly rising stir at the time and Hitchcock was looking for something truly new. He was a legend in his own time, but he was tired of television and even more tired of listening to the studios demanding he make more of the same types of films that he had already directed for them. Finding absolutely no support from studio executives who feared the brutal murder and transvestitism in ""Psycho"" would cause an uproar in the movie going public, Hitch funded the movie himself and delivered, with many setbacks, what is now known as his most popular film ever.

It takes a few moments to get onboard with the way the movie is presented. It delves into the mindset of Hitchcock in visually disturbing ways and does not follow the typical ""Based On True Events"" style we are used to. This, however, works in the movie's favor. The presentation forces the audience to think and participate in the story instead of letting it roll over them. Hitchcock was especially good at getting the audience involved and a movie about his methods and life should feel the same way. The director, Sacha Gervasi, layers the story, plot, and character elements in a way that brings us into the film and makes us more than viewers. We are, instead, Hitchcock's co-conspirators and confidantes.

I went into this film with reservations about what was to come only to have my concerns carefully removed and tossed away as one discards a gum wrapper. They became unimportant and not at all relevant to the wonderful movie I was about to watch. If you haven't seen it yet, make the effort to see ""Hitchcock"" soon and as Hitch would say, you'll have a ""Good Evening"".",1364774400,,2768,4.633401221995927
5483593,4,B00ARA4SLU,"HITCHCOCK has been inspired by the true-life story of how the film PSYCHO was created.  It affords another opportunity for Anthony Hopkins to give one of his bravura performances in the central role.  In truth, he does not look much like Hitch, but he captures the voice inflections very well.  As Alma Reville, Helen Mirren does not have too much to do, other than to demonstrate her loyalty to her husband, despite his unhealthy obsessions with his leading ladies.  In this film, it is Janet Leigh (played with calm authority by Scarlett Johansson).  The film suggests that much of the violence in PSYCHO stemmed from Hitchcock's own sexual frustrations; there is one sequence in particular, showing the director scaring the understudy to death as he performs the stabbing in the now-legendary shower scene.  Another interesting aspect of the film is the link drawn between the protagonist of Bloch's novel - that provided the source for PSYCHO - and Hitchcock's stage of mind at the time of filming it.  On this view, PSYCHO is one of his most personal films.  The film begins and ends with the music from ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS, in a move designed to appeal to nostalgia buffs.  All in all, an entertaining piece.",1364688000,,1220,4.883495145631068

Although it isn't referenced in the story, it's clear that to market ""Psycho,"" Hitchcock, the Master of Suspense, employed techniques used by William Castle, the Master of Schlock Horror, around the same time period.  While ""Psycho"" has since become a classic and recovered from its initial mixed reviews, it was the clever advance publicity and marketing that got audiences into the theater en masse causing critics to take a second look.",1364601600,,758,5.146341463414634

5483613,3,B00ARA4SLU,"""Hitchcock"", The Movie, is about a small part of the famous director's life, between the successful release of ""North By Northwest"" and the release of ""Psycho""; detailing how he came to make the latter, and what happened along the way.  The movie opens and closes with Anthony Hopkins in his eponymous role, but taken from the TV show Alfred Hitchcock hosted, introducing both the movie ""Hitchcock"" and it's focus on ""Psycho"" and tying up loose ends at the finish.  In this aspect of Alfred Hitchcock, Hopkins is breaking the fourth wall, but only to a point.  Along the way, the ""actual"" serial killer (who inspired the book and then the movie, ""Psycho"") appears as a hallucinated muse who guides Hitchcock along in the filming, although the movie is so sloppy in drawing boundaries, very often it appears that Hitchcock was harboring a mass killer.

This is no more of a biography of Alfred Hitchcock than ""The Master"" was a biography of L. Ron Hubbard, or Scientology.  But the latter was a much more polished work, and far better done.  As a piece of cinematography, alone, this film is an insult to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, but at least it gives some long overdue public credit to Hitchcock's apparently long suffering wife, Alma.  And it's entertaining, if nothing else.

When it comes to portraying famous people some of us remember remember seeing alive,  Anthony Hopkins is far less convincing as Hitchcock than Meryl Streep was as Julia Child.  His fat suit isn't proportioned correctly, so Hopkins holds his arms out to his sides; tilts his head back, and half-purses his lips to impose an effect that isn't quite successful.  The camera looking up from waist level helps, somewhat, but how many people are filmed from the waist, looking up?  Any quick watch of Julia Child's PBS cooking show illustrates there's a big gap between her reality and Meryl Streep's portrayal, but Streep captured her essence with far less effort than Hopkins, thus Hopkins' antics end up deflating rather than inflating his character.

As far as the other characters go, Jessica Biel was even less successful at portraying Vera Miles than Hopkins was in playing Hitchcock, but James D'Arcy pretty much nails Anthony Perkins.

So, like a lot of films these days, you just have to go in expecting entertainment, in this case a Hitchcock themed entertainment, and not put too much into it, or try to get too much out of it.  It's fairly decent fresh popcorn, not fine dining.  I'll probably watch it again, but renting it to stream, not buying it.",1364601600,,2540,4.831408775981524

For me, it was a lot of fun watching Anthony Hopkins and Helen Miren in their roles.  It also was great seeing Michael Wincott back as the killer, Ed Glein.  I knew a good bit about Psycho the novel, and a little on the making of the movie.  This film just filled in the pieces for me.

My complaint isn't with the film, but rather with how the DVDs were packaged.  If you own a regular DVD player, the only way to see the film is to buy the Blue Ray Edition with the regular DVD included.  You therefore pay a higher cost for the movie.  Then, when you search for extras on the DVD, the only thing you find are trailers for other movies.  All the extras are on the Blue Ray Edition, and you can't watch a Blue Ray disc in a regular DVD player, so you're screwed.

I won't fall for this type of marketing again.  I'll simply wait a year or two for the price to come down and then purchase it.  Of course, the movie will probably be out on television by then.",1364428800,3,1079,4.080952380952381

5483634,4,B00ARA4SLU,"I saw Psycho in the movies when I was 10 years old.  I considered it then and I still consider it now to be the scariest movie ever made.  I read the book that this was based on and greatly enjoyed it.  So I rushed to see this film when it was playing in the movies last December (which wasn't all that easy since it was playing in very few theaters.)  I considered the film to be enjoyable, but not great.
The main problem is that the film slows to a crawl when it gets into an (imaginery?) affair between Hitchcock's wife Alma and an author that she is collaborating on a book with.  We are then asked to believe that when Norman Bates is stabbing Marion Crane in the shower, it is really Hitchcok stabbing Alma for her alleged infidelity.  I have read many book on Hitchcock and I have never read anything about Alma and another man, so I assume it to be made up for artistic purposes.  However, it really slows down the film.  While watching the film, I started to wonder about what Hitchcock's daughter Pat and her children thought of this film.  I imagine not very much. (Hitchcock's affinity with serial killer Ed Gein, the basis for Norman Bates, probably also could not have sat well with them.)
The acting is fine.  Anthony Hopkins really became Hitchcock for me.  Helen Mirren is also excellent, although I believe he to be a little too glamorous for Alma.  Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Biel were also fine as Janet Leigh and Vera Miles.  The actor who played Anthony Perkins was truly impressive catcing Perkins twitchy mannerisms both as Norman Bates and Perkins himself.  I also liked much of the dialogue that many of us who lived in that period could appreciate.  I especially enjoyed Alma telling Hitchcock to perhaps make Psycho as a musical and to send the script to Doris Day.  (I'm not sure how many of today's younger audiences would know who Doris Day was.  Perhaps they also don't know who Hitchcock was, considering the film's low grosses.)
Anyway, this is a well-acted and enjoyable film.  However, the unnecessary subplot prevents it from being a great one.  Too bad.",1364083200,,2096,4.571045576407506

5483663,3,B00ARA4SLU,"Alfred Hitchcock is rightly regarded as one of the greatest movie directors of all time, and ""Psycho"" is rightly regarded as one of his greatest films.

So how better to tell the story than with a light, tongue-in-cheek tale about Hitchcock's marital woes and battles with the studio? ""Hitchcock"" is a fun movie with some genuinely brilliant acting, particularly by Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren, and it does show us how even the greatest have to fight for their art. But it also shies away from any kind of depth.

In 1959, Alfred Hitchcock (Hopkins) had another runaway success with ""North by Northwest,"" but is bothered by a reporter's implication that his best work is behind him. While the studios offer him their best (such as adapting ""Casino Royale""), Hitchcock wants to reclaim the raw artistic thrill of his younger days. So he decides to adapt a bestselling horror novel, ""Psycho.""

His wife Alma (Mirren) quickly warms to the idea, despite wanting to do her own writing projects with her friend Whitfield Cook (Danny Huston). But the studio balks, forcing Hitchcock to finance the movie with his own money.

But Alma is soon annoyed by studio meddling and Hitchcock's constant ogling of the beautiful blonde Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johansson). Hitchcock begins to suspect that Alma is having an affair with Whit, and the stress takes a toll on both his health and the movie shoot. At the same time, he is plagued with insecurities about the movie's future, and whether it will sink his career.

Hitchcock is a man who is still something of an enigma today, but ""Hitchcock"" doesn't really try to explore him in any depth. Instead, it dances between the Hitchcocks' marital problems and the trials of making a movie that no studio wants anything to do with -- and it does it with a wry, witty touch that borders on comedy without ever quite crossing the line.

The writing tends to be airy and clever, especially when the writers dabble in Hitchcock's notorious macabre streak (""By the way try the finger sandwiches... they're real fingers,"" he remarks when showing people pictures of a serial killer's work). In fact, he's at his most charming when he's lighthearted, such as the little stabby dance he does outside the theater on opening night.

However, I felt that ""Hitchcock"" avoided handling its story with any depth. The marital spat is cleared up too quickly and cleanly, and his controlling nature towards the ""Hitchcock blondes"" is briefly touched on but never really explored. And Hitchcock's conversations with an imaginary Ed Gein seemed strangely out of sync with the tone of the overall movie.

But Hopkins plays Hitchcock as a genial, witty man with some darker sides, and he mimics Hitchcock's speech and body language nicely. On the flipside, Mirren plays Alma as a fiery, intelligent woman who is content to remain in her husband's shadow, but also wants to be appreciated for it. And James D'Arcy and Scarlett Johansson do fine smaller roles as Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh.

""Hitchcock"" is not a bad movie, just a lightweight one -- excellent acting, a somewhat flimsy story, and plenty of behind-the-scenes woes for a now-beloved movie. See it for the performances and the banter.",1363564800,,3216,4.918819188191882

5483683,3,B00ARA4SLU,"You hear the name ""Hitchcock"" and it is a film you just have to check out. Like Hitchcock himself the movie is odd but entertaining. Peering into old Hollywood and the stars of yesteryear always delights with its  speculative nature. ""Hitchcock"" starts off with the director already inhabiting his celebrity, so you will not be watching a bio of the man. Anthony Hopkins who plays the title role never sold Hitchcock to me. And, being that I could not even find a hint of facial connection to the famed director, the loss was even greater. Of course Hopkins is a great actor, but the performance was contrived to the point where I felt it was a ""I will now do my Hitchcock imitation"", which isn't all bad, it just is what it is. Hitch's wife Emma played by the talented Helen Mirren was in counter a charming, possibly unrealistic, encapsulating portrayal of a lesser known figure.

Watching the origins of the Psycho film play out before you is like putting puzzle pieces together. What shape goes where? Unfortunately there's a little too much TV movie style assembly which detracted from any theatrical magic happenings. There is a bulls-eye Anthony Perkins portrayal, a cardboard Vera Miles incarnation (intentional?) and a Janet Leigh physical upgrade (Scarlett Johanson) topped with a dead on hairdo. A standout is Hitch's secretary who has just the right glossy eye rolls and bewildered demeanor. Finally the (Paramount) picture head antagonist role safely keeps the caricature alive and well. If you want it all to fit, it will. If your missing pieces just push anything together to get this flexible bit of fun working.

Psycho (the book) apparently derived some weird ideas from Hitch's dream mentor in the film, serial killer Ed Gein, which trickles in through the film in an attempt at creativity that falls flat on it's face. One of those ""just not necessary"" moves the slows the cinematic movement to a near kill.

If you can get past it's scripty deliveries and hindering insertions, ""Hitchcock"" is an effective period piece that quickly whips figures into shape while holding just as fast to it's rather purposely morose intentions. Its a capable showing of entertainment and the endeavor is commendable, enabling me to toss out my, ""for The Birds"" title in favor of a more ""review-esque"" film title from one of Hitch's less notables.",1363392000,2,2350,4.91183879093199

I didn't think Hopkins looked the part, I'm afraid. His makeup was overdone, and came across as such, rather than convincing, especially the mouth; Hitchcock had a distinctly saggy little mouth, but it did not look like that! I loved that they kept his big, round belly, though! His acting was beautiful, as always. I thought Scarlett Johanssen did a reasonable job as Janet Leigh; she had excellent 1950's-like mannerisms, but Scarlett is famous for her gigantic, puffy lips, and Janet Leigh has very thin lips, and that threw me off. The story was fun and interesting, but it seemed a bit plot-less. The whole story centers around the creation of ""Psycho"", but it's got so many side-plots (the strains on Hitchcock's marriage, etc) that it seems to wander and drag at times, and you're not sure if you're supposed to be focused on the filming of ""Psycho"" or the marriage or what.

5483686,4,B00ARA4SLU,"It seems the biopic character du jour is Alfred Hitchcock: almost simultaneously released as this film was another real dud called THE GIRL dealing with the making of THE BIRDS which came and went quickly. Now we explore the great suspense maker through the machinations of the making of PSYCHO as the reason for exploring the strange body and mental habitus of Hitchcock. While not all of the data gathered for this film written by John J. McLaughlin based on Stephen Rebello's book `Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho' which in turn was based on the derring-do of filming Joseph Stefano's screenplay adapted from the Robert Bloch book PSYCHO which happened to be `inspired' by the serial killer Ed Gein, there certainly is a potpourri of ideas on which to let a cast a sterling actors dabble.

The setting is 1959 and Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins, flab enhanced) and his wife, Alma (Helen Mirren) are at the top of their creative game as filmmakers despite the fact that the various studios are suggesting that Hitchcock should retire. But Hitchcock has another film in his head - PSYCHO - and despite the fact that everyone including Alma believes the film cannot be made with the current censorship and because the story is tasteless Hitchcock decides to bankroll his own film and proceed. All of Hitchcock's characteristics surface - his propensity for blond actresses (he even spies on them while they are dressing), his involvement with the lurid story of Psycho to the point of visualizing Ed Gein (Michael Wincott) to bolster his rabid love of the story, his misplaced mistrust of Alma's friendship with writer Whitfield Cook (Danny Huston), and his demand that the entire cast and crew of the closed set film are sworn to silence about the movie's content. Hitchcock engages blond curvaceous Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johansson) and Anthony Perkins (James D'Arcy) for the leads, includes Vera Miles (Jessica Biel) for a bit part, and constantly fights for the film to be completed and released - which as we know, happened - due in large part to Hitchcock's own shenanigans about marketing.

Though the real theme of the film is a love story between Hitchcock and Alma, the entire crew at Paramount Pictures becomes involved: Hitchcock's secretary Peggy Robertson (Toni Collette), Lew Wasserman (Michael Stuhlberg), Barney Balaban (Richard Portnow), Saul Bass (Wallace Langham), composer Bernard Hermann (Paul Schackman), writer Joseph Stefano (Ralph Macchio), among others. Hopkins gives us a fascinating portrait of Hitchcock and the rest of the cast fill their parts well. But in the end we are left wondering which film will be the basis of the next probable biopic of Alfred Hitchcock. Sacha Gervasi directs with some very generous asides to Hitchcock's mannerisms we all know well. Grady Harp, March 13",1363305600,,2819,5.060215053763441
5483687,4,B00ARA4SLU,"I know this movie was royally panned when it came out. In fact, it came out in general release and disappeared shortly thereafter. Fortunately, I got to see it before it disappeared from theaters.
The focus if this story is the making of Hitchcock's Psycho. Even for the Master of Macabre this film was viewed as a horrific mistake from inception. No one thought it would make much of a movie and that sentiment was shared by Hitchcock's biggest supporter former film editor Alma Reville/Mrs. Hitchcock. Eventually, his wife did come around to share his vision.
As a lover of film and a one-time seven year old whose Grandma took her to see Psycho first run, I thought this was a wonderful premise for a movie. While I had already read the book on which this movie was based, I thought this movie might have better explained the challenges Hitchcock faced while attempting to make Psycho. However, what impressed me was Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hitchcock. While that might have evolved into a parody of the original, Hopkins really stood up to the task of being Hitchcock. The subtle nuances and the gait were there. Hopkins did a remarkable job of transforming himself into the character. Helen Mirren, based on all reports re: Alma, was excellent as the skeptical spouse who bought into her husband's vision which became his obsession.

You can tell that Hopkins immersed himself in the character that he was portraying (as he does for most of his roles that I have seen him in in the past).

On top of the great acting though I was also impressed with the overall writing of the movie itself. As a Psycho fan, I did not know the back story to the movie itself and as a viewer you completely get drawn in by the drama of the investment that Hitchcock makes to directing this film and ultimately as we all know, this movie becomes one of his biggest accomplishments!

I also loved how this movie was set up as a typical Hitchcock television show with Hitchcock introducing and concluding the film. This was a nice touch and seemed appropriate, especially with the overall movie tone.

I have to say that I would highly recommend all to see this, especially if you are a Hitchcock fan, as this is one that you will not soon forget!

Hopkins is fair.  Mirren in better.  There are moments of pleasure (i.e. the marketing and screening of PSYCHO itself...a truly fascinating and revolutionary moment in Hollywood ballyhoo...it gets about 8 minutes of screen time).

5483716,5,B00ARA4SLU,"This film has several dimensions/storylines, great acting, and wonderful chemistry between the actors. It starts out seemingly as a classic ""woman behind the man"" story with Hitchcock now turning 60 and being encouraged by the film industry to retire and go out on a high. Instead he is determined to create his greatest and most innovative film ever, and to everyone's disbelief decides to stray from suspense squarely into the horror genre. There is a creepy sub-plot about his night-time and daydreams about the real killer on which Psycho the film he decides to make was loosely based.

Though his wife Alma has her doubts as well she is ""all in"" on this very risky adventure. One of the best parts of this films is Alma as the un-sung writer, director, creative and editorial direction, as well as his rock, in this film and spanning his career.

5483719,3,B00ARA4SLU,"Alfred Hitchcock is rightly regarded as one of the greatest movie directors of all time, and ""Psycho"" is rightly regarded as one of his greatest films.

So how better to tell the story than with a light, tongue-in-cheek tale about Hitchcock's marital woes and battles with the studio? ""Hitchcock"" is a fun movie with some genuinely brilliant acting, particularly by Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren, and it does show us how even the greatest have to fight for their art. But it also shies away from any kind of depth.

In 1959, Alfred Hitchcock (Hopkins) had another runaway success with ""North by Northwest,"" but is bothered by a reporter's implication that his best work is behind him. While the studios offer him their best (such as adapting ""Casino Royale""), Hitchcock wants to reclaim the raw artistic thrill of his younger days. So he decides to adapt a bestselling horror novel, ""Psycho.""

His wife Alma (Mirren) quickly warms to the idea, despite wanting to do her own writing projects with her friend Whitfield Cook (Danny Huston). But the studio balks, forcing Hitchcock to finance the movie with his own money.

But Alma is soon annoyed by studio meddling and Hitchcock's constant ogling of the beautiful blonde Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johansson). Hitchcock begins to suspect that Alma is having an affair with Whit, and the stress takes a toll on both his health and the movie shoot. At the same time, he is plagued with insecurities about the movie's future, and whether it will sink his career.

Hitchcock is a man who is still something of an enigma today, but ""Hitchcock"" doesn't really try to explore him in any depth. Instead, it dances between the Hitchcocks' marital problems and the trials of making a movie that no studio wants anything to do with -- and it does it with a wry, witty touch that borders on comedy without ever quite crossing the line.

The writing tends to be airy and clever, especially when the writers dabble in Hitchcock's notorious macabre streak (""By the way try the finger sandwiches... they're real fingers,"" he remarks when showing people pictures of a serial killer's work). In fact, he's at his most charming when he's lighthearted, such as the little stabby dance he does outside the theater on opening night.

However, I felt that ""Hitchcock"" avoided handling its story with any depth. The marital spat is cleared up too quickly and cleanly, and his controlling nature towards the ""Hitchcock blondes"" is briefly touched on but never really explored. And Hitchcock's conversations with an imaginary Ed Gein seemed strangely out of sync with the tone of the overall movie.

But Hopkins plays Hitchcock as a genial, witty man with some darker sides, and he mimics Hitchcock's speech and body language nicely. On the flipside, Mirren plays Alma as a fiery, intelligent woman who is content to remain in her husband's shadow, but also wants to be appreciated for it. And James D'Arcy and Scarlett Johansson do fine smaller roles as Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh.

""Hitchcock"" is not a bad movie, just a lightweight one -- excellent acting, a somewhat flimsy story, and plenty of behind-the-scenes woes for a now-beloved movie. See it for the performances and the banter.",1362960000,9,3216,4.918819188191882

As portrayed by Helen Mirren, the wife was portrayed as someone who responed to what her husband did by cheating on her, she found someone to keep her company and her mind mentally active. He was jealous, but they stayed together for convience sake.
Janet Leigh was portrayed with someone who had more scruples than Ms. Hedren and her career survived as did Vera Miles, who had a brief dailliance with Mr. Hitchcock. As portrayed by Mr. Hopkins, Alfred Hitchcock, he found something missing in his martial relationship that caused him to look for something from Ms. Hedren, Ms. Leigh, Ms. Miles and the late Suzanne Pleshette. But the one thing you can't take away from Alfred Hitchcock is that he made good movies and his television shows, The Alfred Hitchcock Hour and Alfred Hitchcock Presents.",1362873600,,1093,4.850267379679145

Story revolves around Hitchcock fighting Paramount and everyone else to make Psycho, which he thinks will be his breakthrough film. Helen Mirren is absolutely suburb as Alma (Mrs. Hitchcock) who at first resists and then supports the picture, and Scarlett Johansson is surprisingly good as a very sweet, naively trusting Janet Leigh. Anthony Hopkins blusters through with admirable fury and bravado, but he is not Hitchcock. Which is unfortunate, but seems a deliberate choice on someone's part. Just enough to suggest, but never enough to convince. Still, the strength of the story itself and quality of performance throughout this movie make it 100% worthwhile.

We all know Alfred Hitchcock was heavy but he wasn't a blob. Hopkins make up looked like he stood there while someone lobbed play-doh at him, it was uneven and distracting.

5483741,2,B00ARA4SLU,"The scriptwriters must be running out of ideas and subjects in Hollywood. I wonder how many of today's audience members have even heard of Alfred Hitchcock and his wife Alma.

The story is all really conjecture with no one to support or deny it. This is basically a the story of a man and a woman for whom the passion has gone out of their marriage. Well, nothing lasts forever. He thinks she's cheating on him and he is jealous. She dislikes the fact that he is sexually attracted to his leading ladies. Well, the women tend to be young, glamourous actresses. This is an elderly couple. Wouldn't it be natural?

Anthony Hopkins, complete with rubber nose and padding, neither looks nor sounds anything like Alfred Hitchcock. Helen Mirren looks nothing like Alma. Imelda Staunton in THE GIRL is a much closer match and Imelda's restrained performance strikes me as much closer to the real woman than Mirren's histrionics.

The Movie if full of innacuracies and spends very little time discussing the making of the movie. Most of the movie is speculation about the Hitchcock's marriage.

Here's an example: When they are photographing Marion's flight in the car, the vehicle shown is a light blue 1955 Ford Tudor (2 doors) sedan. Did anybody bother to screen PSYCHO before they set up this shot? Marion left town in a 1955 Ford, but it was a FORDOR (4 doors) sedan in BLACK.

The famous ""gray"" dress in the original B&W movie was really light blue, according to Rita Riggs who was the wardrobe director. In this recreation, the dress has gone back to dark grey.

I didn't get all the references to Ed Gein. I don't believe Hitch was obsessed with Gein. He knew he was ""only making a movie"".

I liked Scarlett Johanson as Janet Leigh. Scarlett doesn't have Janet's classical beauty, but she has a earthy sexiness, and Janet is shown as a sweet girl, which she was in real life. Jessica Biel, who plays the elegant Vera Miles is strikingly gorgeous and a good choice for the part, but has little to do. The actor who plays Anthony Perkins will make you do a double take, but he only has about two lines of dialogue.

I find it telling that the credits name all the people standing around the set as to who plays what participant in PSYCHO, even when they have no dialogue, yet never once do you hear or see the name PATRICIA HITCHCOCK! Ms. Hitchcock, if you will remember, had the supporting part of Caroline, Marion's co-worker at the real estate office. I'd love to know what Pat thinks of this movie. It can't be anything good.

Meanwhile, read the book: ALFRED HITCHCOCK AND THE MAKING OF PSYCHO.

If you purchase PSYCHO, THE COLLECTOR'S EDITION, you will find an excellent documentary about the making of PSYCHO containing interviews with Janet Leigh, Assistant Director Hilton Greene and Screenwriter Joseph Stefano, among others. This documentary contains all you need to know about the making of PSYCHO from inception to completion.

It's much better than this silly self-indulgent picture.

Oh, by the way, Toby Jones and Imelda Staunton are head and shoulders better than Hopkins and Mirren as the Hitchcocks in THE GIRL, even if the story is not.",1362528000,4,3154,4.714545454545455

5483801,2,B00ARA4SLU,"""Hitchcock"" is about 100 minutes long and about 70 minutes of the running time is concerned with two subplots: Hitchcock's relationship with his wife, Alma Reville, and Hitchcock's hallucinations of Ed Gein, the serial killer who was the original inspiration for the book, and then the movie.  Of those 70 minutes, practically a full hour involves Hitchcock's relationship with his wife.  This is totally unnecessary.

I was hoping for a kind of ""inside baseball"" on the creation and the production of the film.  There was about a half hour of that. A far better film that grapples with the issues of creation and production is ""Topsy Turvy"" concerning Gilbert and Sullivan's ""Mikado""  (and even that film had irrelevant subplots.)

It's hard not to feel that this film was meant as an hommage to Hitchcock and then got derailed into a relationship film between a man and a woman; woman feels unappreciated, but at the end, her guy tells her he loves her.  There's a place for that kind of film. But it's disappointing here.",1362182400,2,1024,4.850574712643678

5483807,5,B00ARA4SLU,"When I was about ten years old some 45 years ago I remember my grandparents giving me a hardcover book of ghost stories each with an introduction by Alfred Hitchcock. In fact if I remember correctly the series was called ""Alfred Hitchcocks Bed Time Stories:.

Well, between the books and the television show my fascination with Alfred Hitchcock began early on.

Brilliant, one of a kind, a maverick and a deeply flawed human being. However he was in every way a true master of movie making and an editor beyond reproach. The latter something I especially liked seeing included in ""Hitchcock"" because it's really there - in the editing room where movies are made.

Hundreds and often thousands of hours of film are whittled down to a seamless ninety  minutes of magic.

Anthony Hopkins is marvelous as ""Hitch' his movements, voice syntax are spot on. The makeup spectacular and the transformation is brilliant. Oddly there were many times I could hear Hannibal Lechter in the voice and see Him in ""Hitches"" slow turning gaze and the even slower closing eyes.

Perhaps because the real Hitchcock carried and expressed himself much like the fictional Lechter I don't know. However,  I do know Hopkins is a national treasure and that there is no trace of Lecter in any of his post ""Silence"" films. Regardless, the performance is stunning and a kick to watch.

The entire cast is smashing. Helen Mirran is sheer perfection as Alma, Hitchcock's wife, muse, editor, writer, co director, protector and touch stone. And it's here inside their relationship that the story unfolds. They were certainly  a unique and formidable team and the film pays tribute to a relationship as uncanny and unique as the movies they created.

The entire cast is sensational  a few standouts being Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh, Toni Collette as Hitchcocks long time assistant Peggy Robertson - and a remarkable performance by James D'Arcy as Anthony Perkins, every movement, his voice, his appearance is a bulls eye it's absolutely uncanny.

At it's heart ""Hitchcock "" is a love story, those looking for an in depth look at how Psycho was made may be disappointed, those hoping to find a bit of what made one of the most prolific directors in the history of the world tick will adore every moment of this film.

It's an endearing and brilliant homage to one the greatest directors of all time.",1362096000,,2370,4.851116625310174
5483808,5,B00ARA4SLU,"Finally a film worth watching. It never sagged nor missed a beat, the viewer is engaged from the opening shot to the last take and its a wonderful snippet of the life of Hitchcock that seems to span his whole world. The casting was perfect (Hopkins) except for that of Johansson who never quite convinced me she could exude even a smidgen of Janet Leigh. All I can think to ask is why wasn't this film nominated and a winner of an Oscar? But that's life. Hitchcock would appreciate the irony.",1362096000,,492,4.417582417582418
5483809,3,B00ARA4SLU,"The story was very good but i have to admit, coming from the error of Hitchcock, Anthony Hopkins make up was lacking.  I feel like he captured the escence of the man to a tee.

Helen Mirren was fabulous as always
Scarlet Johansson was...eh ok

It not a biography, but only a snap shot of a pivotal chapter in his career.  While Anthony Hopkins is a wonderful actor, his portrayal just wasn't enough for me.  I found myself hearing Hopkins and not Hitchcock.  There wasn't much magic or stylish attributes that are typical of the actual Hitchcock movies.  Nothing was really revealed about Hitchcock's life other than this short time period of the late '50's, early '60's.  We didn't get to see him as a family man or his rise to exceptional director.  I wanted to know more about him, not just the battle to get Psycho to the screen.  What was nice was learning more about his wife, Alma, portrayed wonderfully by Helen Mirren.  The other lead actors, Scarlett Johansson  and Jessica Biel were spot on and deftly cast. In particular, Scarlett Johansson as Jamie Lee Curtis' mother was outstanding and captured the spirit of Janet Lee.  Its a good movie but disappoints regarding learning much about Hitchcock other than this one battle in his film career that, admittedly, changed our perceptions of his legacy but hardly touches on the total HITCHCOCK.

He makes you believe he's Alfred Hitchcock. You can't tell where Hitchcock begins and Hopkins ends, LOL! A Helen Mirren is great as Hitchcock's wife Alma. She is also a great actor. If you're like me and like Hitchcock films and his TV shows, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and the Alfred Hitchcock Hour, not to mention all of his great movies such as Rebecca, Psycho and The Birds, you're going to love this movie. To give you some background without giving too much about the film away, it is based on the challenges Alfred Hitchcock and his wife Alma faced while filming Psycho. Psycho, by the way, turned out to be his greatest film to date and that's why this is such a great movie. He overcame every obstacle sent his way to get Psycho filmed, directed and ultimately in movie theaters across the country. By the way, the girl who plays Janet Leigh (leading lady in Psycho), is adorable. She is so cute and she looks and act just like Janet Leigh. The guy who plays Tony Perkins is cute as well. The costumes and makeup are remarkable and absolutely beautiful, in this movie. They take you back to the era in time when Psycho was made, so you feel like you're in the early 1960s.

It was also very interesting to me how big of role his wife played in all of his films. You know the old saying. Behind every great man there is a woman. In this case it is true. I think it's very hard for somebody to play Hitchcock but Anthony Hopkins did a good job and got Hitchcock's mannerisms down and Helen Mirren was brilliant as usual.

5483836,4,B00ARA4SLU,"I screened the film ""The Girl"" about a month or two ago, a film that I really liked.  Perhaps even liked more than ""Hitchcock,"" although it is closer than I thought it would be.

Toby Jones gave an amazing performance as Afred Hitchcock in ""The Girl,"" which wasn't completely surprising after I watched the movie ""Infamous,"" a film that I recommend over both of these by a bit.  In ""Infamous,"" Mr. Jones outdid Philip Seymour Hoffman in ""Capote"" and as Capote, which was a surprise to me.  At any rate, I wanted to compare Anthony Hopkins interpretation of Mr. Hitchcock to Mr. Jones', and surely neither disappoints.  While I have an opinion on who ""won,"" it was so close really that it doesn't matter.

This film though is a more sympathetic take on Hitchcock than ""The Girl.""  In that film, Mr. Hitchcock's legacy takes quite a beating, although Mr. Jones played him so well that it was still really good.  Here, Mr. Hitchcock is surely treated with more respect, although he is still shown as a flawed character.  Which film did I like better?  Well, once again, I have an opinion but it is so close it doesn't matter.

One minor compaint:  the character listing seems to bury Toni Collette, although it prominently features Scarlett Johansson.  In my opinion, Ms. Collette is a better actress -- she really doesn't get the kudos that she so often deserves -- and this bothered me a bit.  However, Ms. Johansson, whom I've been a little hit-and-miss on over her career (I still like her the best in ""The Horse Whisperer"" and ""Lost in Translation""), was actually an excellent casting choice here.

I highly recommend both of these films about Mr. Hitchcock.  And if you like ""The Girl"" then I really recommend ""Infamous.""  You'll probably like that film about another flawed character-- Mr. Capote -- the most of the three.",1361664000,2,1826,4.727848101265823

5483840,4,B00ARA4SLU,The making of psycho is the basis of this film and is better than the source material. The titular character is played masterfully by Anthony Hopkins. The actor looks and sounds like Hitchcock by his mannerisms and voice inflections. The actor deftly portrays the man as controlling and self-absorbed yet somehow a film making genius. Helen Mirren as his wife shows she was emotionally involved with another man but took her husband to task for being too obsessive with his lead actresses. The couple worked best together as she was an editor of her husbands films and the music of the shower scene was shown to be her idea. Scarlett Johannson as janet leigh was well cast but she should have been seen more involved in the movie. She was what drove the original film. Hardly any time was spent on the acting of Bates and the addition of Hitchcock talking to a ghost of Bein was odd. The film was in limited release so many people did not get to see this. It is worth watching and the scene with Scarlett with hitchcock as he directs the shower scene shows a little of film legendry. The premiere scene is also well done as hitch feels vindicated.,1361491200,11,1147,4.545893719806763

5483852,3,B00ARA4SLU,"There's plenty of meat to roast here - the character of Alfred Hitchcock alone could carry most screenplays - but the plot constantly finds itself caught up in dry, semi-interesting wrinkles at the expense of the main attraction. In its best moments, when Hitchcock is allowed to be his sarcastic, dismissive self, it's loads of fun, if a bit indulgent. As the second act stretches on, though, those occasions become fewer and further between. Anthony Hopkins can be quite convincing in the lead role, but he's also inconsistent - in certain scenes you'd swear Hitch is alive and well, while in others it's just Hannibal Lecter in makeup with a blubbery accent. Helen Mirren, who plays his wife Alma, fares much better but is often held captive by stuffy, unwanted elaborative scenes. While Hitchcock remains focused on the task at hand (that is, the conception and production of Psycho) it's a guilty pleasure, perhaps crowded with too many nods and winks. The problem is, it provides just enough of that to tease what could've been, then redirects us to the misplaced, seen-this-before relationship drama it actually is.",1361491200,,1122,5.005347593582887

After reading a book he finds what he is looking for. The studio is against it but Hitchcock decided to finance the movie himself, breaking all the rules as he goes. The story is real, the horror is real, this is the story of the making of Psycho. I'm not sure why but I am a big fan of movies about movies. I was very interested in seeing this not only for that but also because I am a big Anthony Hopkins fan and thought he would be a good choice for this role. The movie itself is really good with some pretty creepy aspects to it but the job that Hopkins does is pretty amazing and sometimes you actually see Hitchcock himself. I'm not sure how accurate this is but Hopkins played a man on the edge of sanity and knowing what I know about Hitchcock it seems to fit. If you are looking for a complete bio-pic of Hitchcock this is not it, but if you are a fan of his then this is a movie not to be missed. I recommend this.

5483856,3,B00ARA4SLU,"2012 was a big year for Alfred Hitchcock; all of the projects and plans were exciting, two movies, DVD box sets, more.. As a major fan of the iconic director - my website, thornhillatthemovies.com gets its name from the character played by Cary Grant in ""North by Northwest"" - anytime my idol is recognized is cause to rejoice. The first project, ""The Girl"" is an HBO Film based on actress Tippi Hedren's experiences making ""The Birds"". The more I heard about this film, the less I wanted to see it. During a press conference promoting the project, which apparently takes a very critical look at Hitchcock's strangeness and proclivities, she talked about his mental and physical abuse, his harassment, and the terrible experience making the film. About a month later, an interview by Robert Osborne with the actress was featured before a special one-night screening of ""The Birds"" in movie theaters. In both instances, she is getting paid to talk about what a terrible experience she had. The thought of this just turns me off, much like so much reality television. Why perpetuate bad memories and experiences and put them in the public eye? What good does it do after so much time has passed? The only reason is to make money and put you in the spotlight. Anyone who knows anything about Hitchcock knows he was a strange man with some darkness and we know the broad strokes about the filming of ""The Birds"".

""Hitchcock"" directed by Sacha Gervasi (writer of ""The Terminal"") and starring Anthony Hopkins as the Master of Suspense, Helen Mirren as his longtime wife and collaborator, Alma Reville, Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh, James D'Arcy as Anthony Perkins, Jessica Biel as Vera Miles and Toni Collette as Peggy Robertson, Hitchcock's longtime assistant, is another story entirely.

From the moment the trailers first started playing in the multiplex, two things were clear; ""Hitchcock"" would concentrate on the filmmaker's life while making ""Psycho"", a turning point and very important time in the filmmaker's life and it would have a certain `tongue-in-cheek' quality the filmmaker himself would appreciate and embrace.

These are the best aspects of the film.

For a filmmaker who worked fifty plus years and created some of the most memorable films ever, a feature length film could and should never cover his entire life or career. It's smart for ""Hitchcock"" to concentrate on a relatively short period of time, giving us as much insight and detail as possible.

""Psycho"" represented a turning point in the director's career. Still reeling from the critical and box office failure of ""Vertigo"", a very personal film, the director turned to subject matter he knew well and made ""North by Northwest"", which was a huge hit. And the studios wanted more of the same. But Hitchcock was bored with the formula and wanted to make something that would provide a challenge. When he found the inspiration, a true-crime book called ""Psycho"", no studio wanted to make the film with him, so he made it ""on the cheap"", shooting the film in black and white, with many crew members from his television show and paid for it himself. When the film was completed, he made a deal with Paramount, a deal which would ultimately make him even wealthier and, in a way, ensure his legacy. ""Psycho"" represents a turning point in his cinematic style and his attitude toward the business of filmmaking.

If you go to YouTube and search `Hitchcock' and `Psycho', one of the options you will be able to see is Hitchcock's original trailer for ""Psycho"". They didn't call him the Master of Suspense for nothing. He decided that no one should be admitted to the theater after the film started. Why? To build curiosity and suspense for the shocking twist about thirty minutes in. For the trailer, he wanted to do something different and decided to stay away from clips. Hitchcock was easily the most famous and recognizable director of the time, he was a star, a selling point, so he takes us on a tour of the set, visiting the Bates' house on the hill, the motel's office and room #1. Inside the room, he  points at the shower ""Oh, you don't want to even think about what happens in there."" That type of thing. It is very clever and very tongue-in-cheek. One of the trailers for ""Hitchcock"" features Hopkins in character, sitting in a recording studio, presumably doing a radio ad. Instead he begins talking about how cell-phones and texting during the film can make you go ""Psycho"". It's a very clever nod to the filmmaker's own promotions and a memorable way to get the word out about this new biopic.

There are some good and some bad things about ""Hitchcock"". Basically, the bad things are that the film doesn't really go into enough detail or go far enough.

The cast is good and they seem to relish the opportunity to play these famous people. Hopkins does a very good job as Hitch. Wearing a body suit and the suit and ties the director made famous, he adopts the man's mannerisms and speech patterns. Anyone who makes films like ""Vertigo"", ""Frenzy"", ""Psycho"", ""Rear Window"", ""The Trouble with Harry"", ""The Birds"", etc. and makes them as well as Hitchcock did, has to have some darkness, some weirdness. And Hitchcock certainly had both, which has been well documented. Hopkins and Gervasi portray some of these points, hint at some and avoid others entirely giving the portrayal an interesting depth you only wish went a little further. He stares out of his bungalow window at a blonde woman who walks across the lot at the same time every day. Both Peggy and Alma know about his desire for blondes, so they seem to accept his longing stares. He casts Vera Miles (Biel) as Marion's sister, a brunette, to use up her contract and provide a slap on the hand for some of her personal choices. But they could have gone further, explored and explained more making the performance great.

This is the first time in a while Hopkins has actually portrayed a character. In so many recent films, he seems to be simply reading his lines or doing another riff on Hannibal Lecter. This is sad because Hopkins is such a great actor and it is difficult to watch him do less than great work. In this film, he dons a body suit and make-up to help transform into the director. But he also adopts the distinctive speech patterns and mannerisms of the famous icon. The portrayal is more real and interesting than a lot of his recent work. It is also a little irreverent, and something you think Hitchcock might have given his stamp of approval..

The relationship between Hitch and his wife, Alma (Mirren) is also nicely illustrated. The film gives us a glimpse at Alma's lifelong role as a silent creative partner - they first worked together on silent films in the `20s - .providing input into every aspect of the creative process from choice of material to editing. Mirren does a nice job of illustrating her fatigue and weariness of her involvement.

Mirren also has the opportunity to portray different aspects of her role as a wife to one of the most celebrated, famous men in the world. She modestly enjoys what the fame and money brings them, but also tries to keep centered and grounded. At times, she even seems to wish she could live a simpler life. But when the film's budget spirals out of control, and her lifestyle is threatened, she becomes aggravated and testy. Mirren is a great actress and this is good work. But there is a layer missing that would make it great work.

Scarlett Johansson plays Janet Leigh and James D'Arcy (""Cloud Atlas"") plays Anthony Perkins, the stars of the film within the film. Both were rising, if unspectacular, actors when cast by Hitchcock. Remember, he was footing the bill, so he wanted people who were cheap. And each portrays their `greenness' to the whole idea of Hollywood. Johansson has more screen time and more opportunity to paint shades of the naivet Leigh might have had. There is a nice scene depicting Leigh and Perkins on the set, walking towards the camera. Perkins comments how this film will be a nice change of pace for them both, from all of the romantic fluff the studios usually cast them in. It will make them sit up and notice. This is a telling moment because Perkins would become typecast and his most memorable and successful roles would always be as madmen, crazy people and really intense and driven characters.

Toni Collette is good as Peggy Robertson, Hitch's longtime secretary and collaborator. There is a hint of the influence she had on the director's career - if Alma was the final word, Peggy was the first - but again, it just doesn't seem to go far enough. One reason is that she simply doesn't have enough screen time.

I wish Gervasi had dug a little deeper. There are a few moments when we watch Hitchcock observing Ed Gein (Michael Wincott), the man who would become the inspiration for Norman Bates, as he performs some of the terrible acts that would provide inspiration for ""Psycho"". Hitchcock stands nearby, watching, commenting to us about the action, as though he is reading the book and picturing these scenes in his mind. But we don't get an idea of why this material was so inspirational to the director. Unless it was purely for the shock value.

The tongue-in-cheek nature of the film is good, and fitting, and the details the filmmakers provide about Hitch's life and filmmaking method are interesting. But balance between the two is never achieved and results in an uneven, marred portrait of the Master of Suspense.",1359331200,11,9486,4.757446808510639
5483857,4,B00ARA4SLU,"Movies about the movies are generally fascinating, and this genre has really never gone out of style. 2012's best picture Oscar went to The Artist, a film about the emergence of sound in film. Robert Altman's excellent film The Player satirizes the studio system as a backdrop to a murder mystery. The list of films like this dates back to the origin of the motion picture itself. While a common genre to make, these films often find a smaller niche audience and Sacha Gervasi's Hitchcock will be no exception.

Hitchcock opens with a charming homage to Alfred Hitchcock's television program, Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Anthony Hopkins plays the iconic director, and his bravura for capturing Hitchcock's eccentricities without appearing overly melodramatic keeps the film afloat through its sprawling middle section (which is curiously similar to the sprawling middle section of the man himself). It can be a double-edged sword to be a director who takes on a film project about a brilliant director. Gervasi's film is rather unimpressive in its form. It is constructed rather typically and while telling a story about some brilliant editing, it fails to really practice what it preaches. This film is also not a career spanning project; instead, it commences in medias res as the aging director searches for a project that will validate his position as a master of suspense who is not outgrowing his art form. That aforementioned project is 1960's Psycho.

The battle to get Psycho made is an interesting story and one worthy of the legacy of films about films. Hopkins dispels some of the tainted oddity that surrounds the reputation of Hitchcock by revealing the passion that lies underneath. Additionally, the film showcases his symbiotic relationship with his wife, Alma (Helen Mirran), a previously unsung heroine who put up with a lot and always stood by the flawed auteur. However, the film does tend to be a bit too ""inside"" for the casual filmgoer. It is almost imperative to have a working knowledge of Psycho to truly enjoy the film. Moreover, there are multiple winks at the audience for those who come in to the theater already knowing some of the behind the scenes stories like Hitchcock's battle with Bernard Herrmann about the score or what images were truly spliced into the famous shower montage.

Nonetheless, Hitchcock does sail on in a relatively entertaining way. There is a bit of a lull as the film shifts focuses from Hitchcock to Alma's friendship with Whitfield Cook (Danny Houston). This side-story is pivotal, but it is dwelled on and overly represented. Hitchcock's infamous curiosity with his leading ladies is explored as Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johansson) and Vera Miles (Jessica Biel) arrive on the set. This story of the director at work is much more compelling and deserves to be showcased a bit more than it is. This obsession that Hitchcock had with his lead actresses on set was also examined in HBO's The Girl, which debuted on the network earlier this year. In that film, Toby Jones plays Hitchcock with a malevolent and sinister air. Hopkins provides a slightly softer, warmer (yet still faintly obtuse) view of his behavior. Hitchcock is far from the comprehensive, authoritative source on the life of its subject. That film is yet to be made and perhaps never will be. However, it is not without its charm and is sure to please fans, although it may fail to create new ones. B

Though this film was apparently far gentler on Hitchcock's character than the HBO one, it certainly didn't leave you feeling that Hitch was a grand guy.  I was very intrigued by a Jesuit priest's recent article on his personal encounters with Hitchcock in 1980:

* ""After we chatted for a while, we all crossed from the living room through a breezeway to his study, and there, with his wife, Alma, we celebrated a quiet Mass....the most remarkable sight was that after receiving communion, he silently cried, tears rolling down his huge cheeks....

* ""Weighing one's life with its share of wounds suffered and inflicted..., and seeking reconciliation with an experienced and forgiving God, strikes me as profoundly human. Hitchcock's extraordinary reaction to receiving communion was the face of real humanity and religion, far away from headlines . . . or today's filmmakers and biographers"" (Alfred Hitchcock's Surprise Ending, Wall Street Journal, 12/6/12)",1358640000,4,2114,8.457399103139014

4 1/2 stars- a great film

Having read many of the more famous movie critics pick this film apart, I still had a great desire to see this film. The subject matter and actors made this a must see for the 2012 film season in my book. The first problem was the limited amount of theaters showing the film. I actually had to wait for it to show up at a discount theater, which is where I viewed the film today. The long wait and the negative reviews were all brushed aside as I saw Alfred Hitchcock before my eyes- courtesy of Anthony Hopkins.

Hopkins no doubt, spent endless hours learning how to speak and act like Mr. Hitchcock. It wasn't just his voice that comes across as authentic, its also some of his poses and glances. I had even heard some rumblings about the choice of Hopkins to play the famous director. There is no doubt that this selection was the right one. Its easy to try and find problems with someone who is portraying an icon. But make no mistake Hopkin's delivers in his best role in recent memory.

Many of us grew up watching Hitch on his tv program reruns. As a nice touch in the film it starts and ends like one of his television shows- with Hitchcock's classic comments about what we are going to see and what we have just witnessed. The film shows us the behind the scenes making of Psycho and all that went right and wrong in the process. What to do when Paramount doesn't want to finance your new film? A disgruntled actress at the end of her contract has to co-exist with Mr. Hitchock. There are problems with the Hitchcock marriage. Many things are going on and yet, Hitchcock with the help of Alma (Hellen Mirren)pull things together their way.

Hellen Mirren  is incredible as Mrs. Hitchock- Alma. She should be up for an oscar and would deserve the victory if it comes here way. Having to deal with the demands of being married to the most famous director in the world and having her own dreams weighs on her mind. She strives to find a balance between the two. And its her help that was the extra push for many of Hitchcock's films. One of the best scenes in the film is when Mirren tells Hitchock how it is in a frustrated outburst. It lasts for several moments as Alfred stands and stares without a word to say. One of those signature scenes that you will always remember an actor/actress for. And this was Mirren's moment.

Not to be forgotten are some of the supporting actors/actresses. Scarlet Johannson plays Janet Leigh very effectively. And she delivers on another great moment and one of films great scenes- the shower scene of Psycho. I don't know if it was rehearsed many times or on one take, but it was really well done. Vera Miles was played by Jessica Beil. Although she didn't have a lot of scenes, she was good as the actress who disappointed Hitchcock for having a family, when Hitch wanted to make her a star.

So I would suggest watching the film with an open mind. Especially if you have read some of the reviews that I did.  If you are a Hitchcock fan this is a no-brainer. You will love the behind the scenes take on Mr. Hitchcock and his wife. And just how many drinks did he have during the film? The best scene in the film for me is almost at the very end. When the crowd is watching his finished masterpiece. He listens outside the door and conducts the screams like the maestro that he was. Enjoy",1357862400,26,3390,4.393939393939394
5483860,4,B00ARA4SLU,"note: Helen Mirren was nominated for an Oscar shortly after I wrote this review.

Helen Mirren utterly engaged me as Alma Hitchcock, pretty much the unsung heroine behind the camera in all of his movies. Today she would be credited as a writer on the movie, at the very least. But Alma was content with her life.  She did exactly as she pleased and was an admired and talented woman.  Only the insiders knew about her but they valued her.  Mirren convinced me she was this character.

Anthony Hopkins successfully recreates Hitchcock.  He both looks and sounds like him.  But there aren't any big surprises with his role. He is pretty much everything you already knew about Hitchcock. However, he does it very well but the movie wouldn't have been very interesting had it been just he playing Hitchcock.

There is a great deal of humor in the movie too but it is that low key British humor so you have to be attuned to it.  For example, when the screenwriter interviews with Hitch, he is late as he just left his daily appointment with his shrink.  Hitch doesn't think much of this info UNTIL the young man mentions the things he is talking about in it, especially about his mother. Hitch hires him on the spot and the next thing we know, he is seeing the shrink too! (The mother, Mrs. Bates, is key to the film PSYCHO, which is when the movie is set.) Hitch also interviews Anthony Perkins for the role of Norman Bates and that has its humorous moments as well. He tells Hitch he'd like to do PSYCHO as he doesn't want to get typed by the romantic parts he currently is playing for the studio. (The joke here is that after PSYCHO no one could ever see Perkins again as anyone but Norman Bates.) As they talk about Perkins' inner psyche, it turns out he too has a lot of issues about his mother.  After this talk, Hitch correctly guesses Perkins is bisexual or gay (this was true. Although married and with children, Perkins also was attracted to men and contracted HIV-AIDS and died of it at the height of the AIDS crisis). Norman Bates is supposed to be gay even though that is never said straight out in the film.

Scarlett Johannssen and Jessica Biel nail Janet Leigh and Vera Miles respectively.  Everyone looks remarkably like their real life counterparts.

If this were not a year awash in fabulous films, I might think this would do well on the awards circuit.  Mirren may even so. However I can't see this film winning up against the field of competition it is facing.

5483861,3,B00ARA4SLU,"Hitchcock is the second film of 2012 to depict the great director following the HBO film The Girl, which set its sights on the making of The Birds and Hitch's obsession with Tippi Hendren. Hitchcock primarily focuses on his relationship with his wife Alma Reville and uses the making of Psycho as background noise. Both films attempt to explore Alfred Hitchcock's dark side, but Hitchcock is much lighter on its feet and doesn't seem like a hit piece the way The Girl did. Oddly enough though, this film's subject matter and structure more closely resemble a television film that wouldn't have been out of place on HBO. I attribute the theatrical release of Hitchcock to the stars involved and Oscar hopes. I'm not saying Hitchcock isn't a good film, but it has neither the depth that makes for a great biopic nor the trashy exploitation that made The Girl so provocative.

Hitchcock opens somewhat comically at the farmhouse of Ed Gein (Michael Wincott) as he murders his brother with a shovel before the tumescent Alfred Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins) himself directly addresses the camera. From there, a reporter at the premiere of his latest film North by Northwest asks Hitchcock if he thinks he's past his prime, which sets him obsessively looking for his next project. After Hitch reads Robert Bloch's novel Psycho he decides to film it, despite receiving little support from those around him. His wife Alma (Helen Mirren), portrayed as his closest confidant and creative partner, eventually warms to the idea but Hitch is still unable to convince the studio and decides to finance the film himself. He then begins assembling the cast, which the film suggests was based entirely on Alma's suggestions. The all-star cast is chock-full of familiar faces, not all of whom are obvious choices for their roles, particularly when it comes to Scarlett Johansson, Jessica Biel, and James D'Arcy playing Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, and Anthony Perkins respectively. Toni Collette (as Hitchcock's trusted assistant) and Danny Huston (as a writer friend of Alma's, who provokes insecurity in Hitch) also co-star.

While it appears to be a behind-the-scenes biopic of the making of Psycho, the film's main focus is the relationship between Hitch and Alma. This is fine except, with a running time of less than 100 minutes, it fails to dedicate enough time or substance to either topic. The behind-the-scenes stuff offers up no new (or, at least, obscure) information and the relationship is portrayed very superficially. It treads lightly across Hitchcock's perverse obsession with his leading ladies and makes half-hearted attempts to explore the jealousies and insecurities that made the man tick (often showing Ed Gein as a recurring figure within Hitch's psyche as he takes on the film and his own inner demons), unfortunately the writing is persiflage that burrows to the core of the man about as thoroughly as his Wikipedia page. In one scene Hitchcock tells Alma ""all men are potential murderers...and for good reason."" It's a good line; but it doesn't have the impact it seems to expect it will.

Hopkins effectively disappears behind the prosthetics to portray Hitchcock, with his own voice emerging sporadically through the accent. He does a fine job but the screenplay renders his performance into little more than an impersonation that fails to convey any humanity in the character. He seems to be enjoying the role and he's fun to watch, but it won't win him any awards. A scene of Hitchcock standing outside the theater door as Psycho premieres, acting as a macabre conductor of his audiences emotions is one of the most revealing scenes. It's terrific, but it's too little too late. The supporting players do a fine job but their characters are so two-dimensional they're unable to do anything truly dynamic. Johansson doesn't greatly resemble Janet Leigh but is appropriately elegant, charming, and spunky. D'Arcy meanwhile is under-utilized as he instantly nails the timid, fidgety nature of Anthony Perkins. Appearing in only a few scenes, he remarkably resembles the man and, from the moment he appears onscreen, captures his essence. Because Helen Mirren plays a real person that existed more behind the scenes than others, it allows her more room for interpretation and, as such, she gives arguably the film's strongest performance. There are times when her performance alone keeps the film from crumbling under the weight of its own ambition. She gives the relationship between Hitch and Alma a sense of reality that didn't appear on the page.

While not a very memorable film, Hitchcock does offer a good bit of behind the scenes fodder. Some of the most enjoyable scenes come from Hitchcock fighting with the censors over trivial issues such as showing a toilet flushing onscreen. The filming of the infamous shower scene is treated with insouciance and ends much too quickly, but is amusing in the way it becomes unintentionally sexy because of Johansson. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, as evidenced by some amusing tongue-in-cheek references to Psycho (during editing, an issue arises over Leigh allegedly blinking), this film itself (the comment about Leigh's breasts), and a final shot that almost suggests an attempted continuity with The Girl.

Hitchcock is a well-made film with performances that hold your attention, but I wish it had been able to offer a little something more. If screenwriter John J. McLaughlin had redirected the focus of his script to either the making of Psycho or Hitch and Alma's marriage and kept the focus there, a more effective film could have come from it.  Ultimately Hitchcock attempts a balancing act and suffers for it. While it builds a foundation on an intriguing subject and portrays it an entertaining way; it just doesn't do its subject justice. For a film about such a remarkable man, Hitchcock is almost remarkably unremarkable.",1357603200,4,5902,5.085655314757482

It begins at the Gein Farmhouse in 1944 Wisconsin, there is a brushfire and a conflict between two men. Next its 1959 in Chicago where North by Northwest is playing in a movie theater. Hitchcock is the most famous movie director of all time [thanks to his successful television series]. Hitchcock wants something different. He reads a book based on a mass murderer in

Wisconsin. His wife recommends a book Psycho by Robert Bloch. Is it a low-budget horror claptrap? [Alma Reville is his wife, collaborator, and script writer.] Hitchcock shows pictures taken from police files. Audiences want to be shocked, but when Hitchcock does something different it loses money.

Hitchcock quotes a price for this movie, but Paramount refuses to finance it. Can they finance it themselves? Yes. They just need a distributor. The writer sees a psychiatrist daily. Hitchcock visits the censor to discuss the story and get permission (the Hollywood Production Code). Who will play the male lead? They discuss the female lead. How sill he shoot the shower scene? The Hitchcocks must cut their budget to save money. Hitch asks people to keep the secrets of this movie. They discuss the scenes. Marion Crane is photographed against a filmed background. Should she discuss her personal life? Hitch has the right for the final cut of the movie. The Hitchcocks dine at home. They film the shower scene of Psycho as Hitch commands.

But Hitch collapses and has to stay in bed. They are behind in schedule. Alma explains her collaboration. Dont be absurd. Alma learns more about that writer. Do people like the finished product? Alma says the movie must be recut to improve it. Hitchcock converses with the censor and makes him an offer to get approval. The movie will open in only two theaters, they will depend on word of mouth for advertising. They have tricks to boost interest. Hitchcock watches the audience reactions! Its another success, one of his greatest achievements. [His next project was The Birds.] His other films were not as successful. Hitchcock never won an Oscar, but got a Life Achievement award.

This is based on a book about The Making of Psycho, Hitchcocks most successful movie. I didn't think it was that great. The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes, Foreign Correspondent, The Man Who Knew Too Much and North by Northwest were better than this story of a psycho killer.

Despite a top-flight cast, director Sacha Gervasi (who has many rock-&-roll connections and qualificationsapparently including a child by one of the Spice Girls), is a bitter disappointment, wanting to make the great director a nice, corpulent gentleman, who exchanges sweet smiles with his wife in the midst of domestic tranquility.  What is missing is what 'Tippi' Hedren recently said of Hitchcock, i.e., that he was an evil man.  As portrayed here, Hitch is as evil as Uncle Joe in Petticoat Junction, who would have made mundane films like the one under review rather than The Birds.
Two of the greatest living actors lead the cast: Sir Anthony Hopkins is only acceptable in the name part, and is saddled with prosthetics and padding to make him resemble the director; instead they make him resemble a corpse.  Why not simply engage a heavy actor for the part? (I am certain they exist, at least outside of Hollywood.)  Dame Helen Mirren is better as Mrs Hitchcock. With even a competent director, they surely would have been stirring.
James DArcy plays the late Anthony Perkins, and his portrayal is uncanny.  One utterly felt one was watching Perkins himself, with all the dimensions we now know comprised his unhappy soul.  His are the only scenes where one could see what this movie might have been.  In the cameo rle of the screenwriter of Psycho, is the underrated Ralph Macchio, managing to emit pathos in his minute or so of screen time.
One sees a bit of what it was like filming Psycho, but these scenes are not enough to redeem this failure, which has the feel of a television movie from the nineteen-seventies, very far removed from the chilling, stylized, even monstrous ethos of the films towering subject.  Happily, we do have the masters oeuvre, which will survive this biographical ordeal.  (December 11, 2012)",1512950400,,2063,4.956521739130435
