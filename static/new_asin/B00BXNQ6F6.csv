5680781,5,B00BXNQ6F6,"This film was done in a simple, almost stage-like style - a TRUE independent film. Really important messaging, good for families with older children (12+, as the topics can be intense). Although the movie deals with faith, it does not come off as a ""Christian Movie.""",1363824000,8,267,4.826086956521739
5680782,5,B00BXNQ6F6,"I had the opportunity to see this at its screening and was struck by the beautiful and truthful message it shares about taking a stand for something that you believe in. This story is a strong one and it's filmed in such a way that allows the viewer to really focus on the message that it tells.  There were moments where I completely forgot myself and just openly cried. :) The beauty of this story is the questions it raises about my own willingness to take a stand and resist ""evil"" in all its forms.  Even if my actions accomplish nothing in my limited perspective, do I still take a stand? Man, good stuff!!  I am excited to get this so I can share it with my family and friends.  I highly recommend it!",1363824000,10,708,4.2611940298507465

5680784,2,B00BXNQ6F6,"This ""movie"" is not a movie at all. It is a stage play, and poorly acted. My cat was ill and laying on my chest or else I would have gotten up  to turn it off. It's something like a high school propaganda film on how they should have acted (but didn't).",1512259200,,253,3.8653846153846154
5680785,2,B00BXNQ6F6,"This really is Christian propaganda nonsense wrapped around a true story: ""I am all alone"" followed by ""No; Jesus is with you---always"" stuff.
Well, I am sure that was good news to Nazi prisoners, but their jailors still killed millions of praying people. A better movie would have been showing the great success all the Nazi People's Court judges had before, during, AND AFTER THE WAR. Look it up; read some history. They got pensions, too---their time on the Nazi bench counted. They probably went to church every week, too.
These Religious movies should come with warnings attached.",1511136000,4,585,4.979591836734694

5680787,5,B00BXNQ6F6,"Excellent minimalist production that is very much like watching a live stage play.  One is never distracted by superfluous scenery or manipulative music.  The acting was very good and genuinely captured the idealism of resistance youth through to the agony of the bitter, tragic end.  This movie is very timely, considering the state of politics worldwide.  It presents both the necessity for and the dangers of resisting destructive forces in societies.  I plan to read more about these three, brave, young men.",1510531200,,512,5.195121951219512

5680789,5,B00BXNQ6F6,"I wish every American, seeker of truth, and teenager to adult could see this movie.
Incredible dramatization that gets you face to face with the incredible historical events, how it relates to modern day events, and ""who would you be if this was happening to you?""

This, along with the movie Julia, have opened my eyes to the way this kind of slow loss of freedom that took place leading to one of the most atrocious events in modern history--WWII.

But more importantly, to know that these elements are present in all of us if we do not learn and resists them.

As a side note, the way this movie was done is so great.  Great cinema quality of something that feels like a cross between a play and a movie, with very compelling characters and lines/scenes that really tell the story.

I hope more people find and watch it, along with Julia.",1509840000,7,841,4.470588235294118

5680792,1,B00BXNQ6F6,"While some laud the almost non-existant sets, props and lighting as being bold or innovative, I found it very distracting and amateurish. The acting was downright painful to watch as well. I've seen better Jr. High productions. I really wanted to like this film, as I'd grown up hearing my parents tell their story. It was so bad, I couldn't even finish watching it. Such a disappointment.",1419033600,8,389,4.82089552238806
5680793,4,B00BXNQ6F6,"Although it sounds something from a scifi/fantasy novel, this really happened. Three teens, Helmuth Hubener, Rudi Wobbe, and Karl-Heinz Schnibbe took a major stand against Hitler, as the three banded together and created and distributed anti-Nazi illegal pamphlets. The three made a pact that the first one caught would take the blame on himself. Later, Helmuth decides he wants to translate the pamphlets into French, and unfortunately gets caught doing it, dooming the little group. Helmuth was primarily the one caught and unlike his two companions, he was sentenced to death. When I first heard Helmuths story a few years ago from the fictional biography The Boy Who Dared, Helmuth instantly made my Top Heroes list, and Helmuth is one of my biggest inspirations in life. He was so brave and incredibly handsome. I would hope if I were ever in that situation I would do the same thing he did.

A strong underlining message of faith is present; characters go to church and pray. Courage was a major theme. Winston Churchill (and many others, paraphrased) have said, Without courage all other virtues lose their meaning. With their courage came love, ambition, faith, loyalty. The film was pretty clean and family friendly. (Some minor violence towards the end of the film. Its pretty hard to watch, mostly because I respect those three guys so much.) This is a screenplay, not a Hollywood film, and I am easily able to forgive amateur acting for the heart of the film. I quite admired seeing this story on screen, as Haley Joel Osment was going to star in a (different) Helmuth Hubener movie but backed out of the project. :( So seeing my hero on screen is something Ive been waiting for for quite a time.

Being told from Rudi, not Helmuth, brought a unique perspective. Ill admit, I sometimes forget other teens were involved, so hearing from Rudi is nice. It also wanted me to bump up Rudis memoir, Three Against Hitler, on my to-read list! (Karl also has a memoir, The Price) Helmuth being so extraordinarily brave made me want to slap some sense into Rudi a few times, and I do wish the film would have featured Helmuth more, obviously my favorite character. :) (But, fortunately it doesnt show Helmuths execution, the way Sophie Scholls movie does.)

All in all, this is definitely a film that should be shown, particularly to teenagers who don't think they can make a difference. Brava to director Kathryn Moss for bringing this incredible story to light.

Disclaimer: I was given a free copy of the film in exchange for an honest review.",1410566400,,2548,4.810502283105023
5680794,1,B00BXNQ6F6,"Not a good production at all.  Shallow story line, but hard to watch the movie as very cheaply done, and I usually love movies from this time period.",1389398400,3,149,4.321428571428571
5680795,2,B00BXNQ6F6,"As promised, the film's story is inspiring. However, the film itself is fairly awful; the acting, cinematography, and editing are all very amateur. It felt like I was watching a high school stage-play rather than a movie.",1382140800,4,221,5.0
5680796,4,B00BXNQ6F6,"This film was brilliantly written and directed with a lot of heart. I don't often get to the end of a movie feeling as though I can change the world for the better, but that's the message of this one. I loved it!

I can't wait to see the next project from the team of creatives behind Resistance Movement.",1378684800,,305,4.169491525423729
5680797,5,B00BXNQ6F6,"Resistance Movement is a great film. I watched it with my four children (ages ranging from 14-6)and we were able to have a great family discussion about it afterwards. My kids ask to watch it more frequently than the popular movies we own. Even my 6 year old was able to understand a lot of the movie and loved it. It was well written and filmed. I love the idea of a movie/play format mixed together. Definitely a perfect family movie.

One of the best features is the making of the film. I was touched when I watched how it came about and the feelings and experiences of those who were involved in the production. If you don't know much about the true events, I would  recommend watching this first before the movie. You will quickly feel a sense of love for the real life heros as you watch the movie.

After watching the first time, I immediately wanted to watch it again. It's rare to find a movie that you can sit and watch all of the commentary on, but for Resistance Movement it was nice to watch with the directors commentating. It became more real and they did a great job of explaining important and key elements, as well as gave a sense of how wonderful the experience was to make the film.

You will not regret buying and watching this movie. It will be a good experience for you and your famly!",1378512000,4,1308,4.326530612244898
5680798,5,B00BXNQ6F6,"I really don't know what to say. I first read about this brave resistance group some years ago when my younger sister borrowed Rudi Wobbe's account on these events from someone. I read it and became interested and wanted to learn more.

Just so you know that the sets were little more then dark open areas or concrete rooms. Only a few times was there a room setting.

Honestly I think this was a little over priced for everything to be on sets with no real touch ups. I paid 19.99 for this and I think it should be closer to 9.99 or maybe a little higher.",1375747200,,556,4.186915887850467
5680799,5,B00BXNQ6F6,Great story of german youth telling other germans about the truth of Hitler.  Very well done. This is based on actual events.,1373587200,7,125,4.681818181818182
5680800,5,B00BXNQ6F6,"The most compelling aspects of this film lie in the truth of the story and its stark presentation. Once upon a time, young teens actually took the brave, idealistic risks we see dramatized in the film, even as they were living under the thumb of Nazi Germany. My expectation was that ""Resistence Movement"" would be a 21st-Century epic war spectacle shot in far-flung locations, presenting the boys' stories amid explosions, jack-booted SS goons and graphic atrocities -- a thrilling ""guy"" action flick. Instead, writer-director Kathryn Lee Moss chose to film the story much as it appeared in its original incarnation -- as a stage play. This gives us a more personal human drama as it plays out in small rooms on dark stages. Your focus is on the boys, their convictions and the grave danger that their choices engender. Removing the distractions of Speilberg-like bombs and zinging bullets brings the tension and humanity to the forefront.",1369008000,6,940,5.032051282051282
5680801,5,B00BXNQ6F6,"This movie is a wonderful reenactment of World War II history.  It is well written, acted and directed as well as being a movie that your whole family can view without any of the ""R"" rated input that so many movies have these days.  I loved it!",1368576000,5,244,4.170212765957447
5680802,5,B00BXNQ6F6,"Artistically filmed, so you focus solely on the story. Incredible ensemble cast.  Award winning score. Emotional, heatwarming, hopeful. I highly recommend!",1368403200,3,155,6.380952380952381
5680803,5,B00BXNQ6F6,"Helmuth Hubener led a three-teen Resistance movement in Hamburg, Nazi Germany, using the church typewriter and mimeograph machine to write and distribute leaflets exposing the lies of the propaganda machines of the Third Reich. Captured by the Gestapo, he was tortured brutally before he and his friends were put on trial in Berlin.
Told through the viewpoint of Rudi, one of the young Latter-Day Saint boys Hubener enlisted in his crusade, and depicted in a visual style that does away with walls and outdoor shots, using skeletal sets and darkness to pare down the story to its essentials, ""Resistance Movement"" is tense, engrossing, and thought-provoking theatre brought to the screen and DVD.
The story asks--When is breaking the law the right thing to do? Why doesn't Heavenly Father answer my prayer right now? How can one person make a difference? How can I stand up for truth when I'm surrounded by lies? There is a strength in the script and the actors. Some of the treatment the boys suffer can be hard to watch, but this film of acting on your faith is a must-see for audiences 12 and up.",1367798400,4,1099,4.7894736842105265
5680804,5,B00BXNQ6F6,I was very caught up in this movie.  It broke my heart to see the anquish that these young men experienced. Wow great acting and very well written.,1367539200,3,147,4.25
5680805,5,B00BXNQ6F6,"Great movie!  Tells a wonderful, true story of 3 young boys in Germany during WWII.  Makes you think about their sacrifices and what is happening it the world today.",1366588800,3,165,4.655172413793103
5680806,5,B00BXNQ6F6,"I was amazed, moved, inspired, and motivated watching this true story. This movie brilliantly illustrates true courage from 3 young men who stood up for something that they believed in despite the dangers that could happen to them or to their families.  It is easy to go along with what is popular or what is easy and it shows the persons true character when they follow their heart and do what is right.  The movie will help inspire anyone who watches it to be the better person and to make the better decision.  This is a must watch for all ages!  The actors all do a great job to help you understand what it must have been like to go through this experience. I plan on watching this movie again and sharing it with my friends and family.  Well done!",1365292800,5,752,4.3428571428571425
5680807,5,B00BXNQ6F6,"At first I wasn't sure I even wanted to watch this movie, but a few of my friends who had seen it recommended it to me, so I watched it. From the beginning scenes I was glad I did! I didn't know the story of Rudy and his friends, but wow what a story. This is an inspiring movie that makes me want to stand up and fight for what I believe in! To stand up against all odds. Helmuth reminded me of Paul in front of King Agrippa, testifying of the truth! GREAT MOVIE!!",1365206400,5,465,3.905263157894737
5680808,5,B00BXNQ6F6,"The first thing that strikes you in watching this film is the absence of sets and backdrops.  All backgrounds are simply blacked out.  It is a little like you are seeing a film of a stage play.  What first impresses is the outstanding acting.  Then the beautiful intermittent music and score.  The film is very well filmed in spite of the fact that just the few props are used.  After a short time, the blacking-out of all backgrounds has an effect that perhaps was actually planned by the filmmakers  that is, the gloom and blackness of life manufactured by a satanic governmental regime.  With that in mind, the ambiance makes sense.  Nevertheless, a viewer may still yearn for a full-on film production that incorporates the use of sets.  Perhaps funding was a problem.  But whatever the reason, this film nevertheless shines and succeeds marvelouslyin fact, stunningly.  It is so worth the purchase.

Small theater, it is said, is the purest form of acting.  I was raised in a theater environment and developed a taste for quality acting.  This film is an example of that, and those watching will be delighted by it, not to mention the compelling true story it depicts.  One feels like they've been treated to a great stage play and a movie at the same time; what more could you dream of!  The film is driven by its performances, and by the end the viewer is completely captured by them.  The movie is simply a gem; it is a treasure.",1365033600,11,1437,4.612648221343873
5680809,5,B00BXNQ6F6,"I don't know what to say other than this movie was amazing. I came away inspired and empowered. In a day and age when technology and special effects overwhelm story, and when sex and foul language are forced into scripts to secure certain ratings, Resistance Movement gets back to the basics where story and character are king. There is no sexual content or swearing. More than anything, this is a movie about the ability within us all and responsibility we all have to make a difference. What a comfort it is to know we are never alone in our struggles. We can resist evil, in all its many forms. We can and will make a difference. Thank you for that timely reminder!",1364947200,9,668,4.483606557377049
5680810,5,B00BXNQ6F6,"Fantastically written and acted.  Very moving, very raw emotion.  Stripping away the exterior helped bring out the power of the story.  I really admired the style of this film.  It was also paired with an amazing score, very high quality.",1364428800,5,238,4.875
5680811,5,B00BXNQ6F6,"Resistance Movement is superbly written and directed!  With a message of conviction and steadfast courage, this true story is both haunting and inspiring.  The viewer is drawn in by the unique filming style, and three very believable main characters. Overall, an esoteric independent film that left me stunned and crying.  I had to ask myself, ""What would I be willing to do, for the good of all, in the face of tremendous turmoil and personal sacrifice?""  For anyone who wants to believe that one person can truly make a difference, this film is a must!

8575124,3,B00BXNQ6F6,"Caught off guard we did not expect this to be more of a play than a movie.  The acting as well as the format was akin to a play, and we almost quit the show at the beginning because a play wasn't what we were in the mood for.  But as the plot developed and we realized it was a very accurate portrayal of actual events, we opted to stay with it for 90 minutes.  Due to its onstage-type acting and the actors youthful acting experience, the oral presentation somewhat forced and is not as realistic as you might find in a movie with famous actors.  This and the lack of adequate forewarning in the Amazon description led to 3 stars rather than more.",1529107200,,648,4.201612903225806

8575127,4,B00BXNQ6F6,"It's ok. Great story and inspiration for us all. But quite amateurish filming... a lot of it done in front of a black screen. And they came across as definitely looking back, very into anti-Hitler sentiments from the start, whereas Germans very actually quite slow and reluctant to condemn Hitler and the Nazis, even when they disagreed with them. I have German relatives who lived in German during the war and some even fought in the German army. They were not Nazis, never joined the party, but even if they disagreed... it just seems like the actors present the young men as too sure of themselves in a way I am not sure the real boys were, even if they were brave to resist to the end.",1521676800,,689,4.433070866141732
