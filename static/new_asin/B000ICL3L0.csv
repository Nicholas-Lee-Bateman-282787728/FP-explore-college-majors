2654334,3,B000ICL3L0,"We all know and love Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) from the Clerks movies.  I saw this movie a couple of years ago at Vulgarthon, which is basically a Kevin Smith film festival.  In fact, I can see myself in the crowd during the Q&A on this dvd which is pretty neat!  :-)

I will be honest and say that I did not have high hopes for this movie.  I did not expect it to be bad, but I was certainly pleasantly surprised at how good it was and as one person stated during the Q&A, I now think of Jeff Anderson as Jeff Anderson, not as Randal.  He has definitely come into his own and should be recognized for having talents all his own and beyond his quick-talking role in Kevin Smith's movies.

Now You Know is about a couple who are engaged and on the eve of their wedding the bride-to-be (Rashida Jones) calls off the wedding with (seemingly) no explanation, leaving the groom (Jeremy Sisto) confused and at a loss as to what he should do next.

One of the high points of the film is definitely the casting.  For the most part the cast is impeccable and the acting is great.  Jeremy Sisto is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors consistently surprising me in the unique and independant films he chooses to be in.  His performance here is no exception, he is excellent as the sweet and baffled Jeremy.  One hilarious fun fact is that according to Jeff Anderson his first choice for the role of Jeremy was Joey Lawrence!  He said that Lawrence auditioned and was absolutely perfect but he couldn't bring himself to cast him simply because ""come on, it's Joey Lawrence.""  Anyhow, Sisto fills the part just fine, although it would have been interesting to see Lawrence in the part as well.

I was happy to see Jones in the role of Kerri--the only other thing I have seen her in is one episode of the much beloved show Freaks and Geeks.  She does just fine as the dissatisfied and confused Kerri.

In supporting roles we have Anderson as Gil, one of Jeremy's old friends, who does great as always.  We also have a wonderful performance by Heather Paige Kent whom I used to watch in an underrated and short-lived tv show called That's Life.  She turns in a remarkable performance here as the supportive friend of Kerri with a big problem of her own.  I hope to see her in more movies in the future.  In my opinion the only weak point in the casting is Trevor Fehrman as Bisquit, Jeremy and Gil's buddy.  His performance is forgettable, poor and he brings almost none of himself to the part.  Most of his rants are pretty typical of rants in almost every Kevin Smith movie and it's pretty obvious that these are some of the same, his inflection is even the same as so many other secondary characters in Clerks and it was actually a little distracting and it's also part of the reason I gave the movie three stars instead of four.

Another reason for the three-star rating is due to the fact that the movie suffers from a little predictability (not too bad though) and some dialogue in certain scenes that is too run-of-the-mill or typical.  I also feel that certain parts of the movie are a bit too reminiscent of Clerks, which is not entirely a bad thing but it would have been nice to see Anderson break away from that and come up with something completely separate from his work with Smith.

All in all Anderson really put himself out there and we can see a lot of his personal story in Now You Know.  This is a great first-time effort and I think we will see something even better with his next film Marry Me To Death.  He stated that he wanted to make a movie that appealed to both men and women and this movie has crude humor and a somewhat Bachelor Party-esque feel to it and also has a softer side with some romantic elements which will appeal to the ladies (not me so much because romance in movies makes me sick, haha).  Anyway, he most certainly accomplishes this goal with Now You Know.  I recommend checking this flick out, it is well worth the time.",1166227200,5,3962,4.387671232876713
2654335,5,B000ICL3L0,"Jeff Anderson has been known to say that he doesn't consider himself an actor - at least he didn't both before and after Clerks (1994).  I have said and still say he was at the time of Clerks a diamond in the somewhat slightly rough - someone I have looked forward to doing more both in front of and behind the camera.  And he's really had a great mentor of sorts in Kevin Smith.  Now You Know could fit into the style of a Kevin Smith movie - sure it's indie - and it has some sick jokes (who doesn't love them), but it really has a mark that must only be from Jeff Anderson.  He really writes well for both his male and female characters.  They are enjoyable to watch and are worthy of our attention.  It's in his subtleties that he really shines, the words and actions not expressed outwardly, but understood by the audience.  All characters are well rounded, and even though the three fellas, Jeremy, Biscuit and Gil have some twisted logic among them, they all have redeeming qualities that make you love them all the more.  Jeremy learns, if not too late, what it is that he wants and how to go about getting it, Gil steps up to the plate with great care and intensity, and Biscuit finds a great use for a bowling ball and some extra chains.

Jeff Anderson also offers a brilliant performance in the latest installment of the Jersey ""trilogy"" (Clerks II), how many is it now: Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy (the original trilogy), Dogma (it heads to Jersey), Jay & Silent Bob (it starts in Jersey, Jersey Girl, Clerks II ... I count 7 !  Returning as Randal Graves, he's sharpened his sarcastic and crude wit to a fine point, but this time we see so much more from Randal - in his conversations with Elias, a 19 year old employee at Mooby's and soon to be the latest partner in crime of 32 year old Randal, we see a brotherly relationship, one of noogies, spit balls, and hysterical wordplay.  Pay close attention to his scene with Elias and the Pillow Pants reference, when Randal calls Elias his new best friend - there is a sincerity and sadness that Anderson really taps into and expresses with an understated beauty.  Also his final scenes with Dante (from the donkey lovin' onward) really rip out my heart.

But I digress, back to Now You Know ... I must say I am waiting with great anticipation for the next outing from Mr. Anderson - what can I say, I LOVE my Jersey Boys ...",1166054400,3,2388,4.375565610859729
2654336,5,B000ICL3L0,"If you like indie comedies, this is totally up your alley.  Great, off-the-wall characters and killer performances.  I laughed out loud a lot, but the heart the movie has is what surprised me (and not in a bad way.)  The kind of movie I wish I could find more often.",1165104000,9,266,4.28
2654337,5,B000ICL3L0,"I had the pleasure of seeing this film at Kevin Smith's Vulgarthon years ago when they debited JSBSB and have been waiting for it to be released.  Jeff Anderson steps away from his Randal role and shows another side, writing and staring in this movie.  It is not Clerks, but fans of the genre shouldn't be disappointed.  Essentially a comedic love story that can be appreciated by everyone.  Too bad it was never released in theaters.",1158451200,9,434,4.671052631578948

2654342,2,B000ICL3L0,I must have missed something others saw. I am sorry with such a talented cast and I'm sure talented writers....it dragged all over the place. I don't believe I laughed at all. It is a shame that I had such high expectations. Big let down.,1413590400,,238,4.311111111111111
2654343,3,B000ICL3L0,"Jeff Andersons (Randal Graves) first attempt at directing, a good light hearted comedy, but laughs are few but when they appear are fun, not up to standard with clerks 1 or 2 but that would be a hard act to follow.",1411516800,,214,4.2439024390243905

2654349,4,B000ICL3L0,"As a diehard Kevin Smith fan, I had fairly high expectations to Jeff Anderson's first film. I was impressed. Although not outstanding, ""Now You Know"" has a certain je ne se quoi about it that will make you watch it again and again.

Acting: 4 1/2 star (Anderson and Fehrman are fantastic, Rashida Jones is good and everyone else is still able to keep up)
Plot: 3 1/2 star (a bit hard to understand at first, but definetly becomes more intersting as the movie progresses)
Production: 4 star (very good for the budget they had)
Overall: 4 star (if you are a Kevin Smith fan, it is absolutely worth watching)",1359244800,,605,4.5
2654350,5,B000ICL3L0,"Anderson's directorial debut is great this flick rocks! But just like in Clerks 2 Trevor Fuhrman steals the show, he is so funny in this movie u will be rolling on the ground, god wish he did more movies.",1356307200,,204,4.256410256410256

2654353,5,B000ICL3L0,"To start, I am a big fan of Jeff Anderson in Clerks / Clerks II. So I wanted to like this movie going into it.  I was not let down.  It's creative and funny but packed full of crude and rude humor (I love that stuff).  If you are a fan of Kevin Smith's works (specifically Clerks II) then you will most likely enjoy this movie.  This movie got very little notice.  I probably would not have ever heard of it if it wasn't for Jeff Anderson being in Kevin Smith's movies and this being a ""Kevin Smith Presents"" type thing.  It's one of those rare finds where you can pop an unknown comedy in and really enjoy it since you had no previous expectations (until you just read this... sorry about that!)

The special features on the disc are not that great.  There is commentary and a Q + A with Kevin Smith and Jeff Anderson.  That's it.  Nothing else.  That aside, this movie is a great buy.  Highly recomended.",1328572800,,906,4.233918128654971
2654354,1,B000ICL3L0,I guess if your idea of funny is a drunken loser mowing over a dog then this is a Five Star Gem. I almost never quit a movie...but hey this one did that for me. Now my high hopes for Red State are tempered.,1306800000,,206,3.7045454545454546

I enjoyed the flick and always look forward to the witty dialogue found in these movies.  Great job and a must for your collection.",1237766400,,250,4.081632653061225
2654359,5,B000ICL3L0,"I had never heard of this movie, despite loving all of the movies by Kevin Smith other than this. The moment I heard of it, I had to give it a chance, seeing as it was a good cast that had worked together before and had some potential to be good.

Needless to say, I loved this movie as well, and Jeff Anderson did a fantastic job of not getting in over his head and trying to be too ""big""

He wrote a solid movie that is a good play on relationships and how they work given evolving personal situations, as well as how friends play into the equation.

There were some funny moments with Biscuit that, at first, seem ridiculous, but upon watching this for the second time, I realized were absolutely hilarious given the context and the ridiculousness of what he says.

The movie was also perfectly casted, with each character giving off the right vibe for their respective roles.

If you're looking for a funny, witty, thought-provoking movie about relationships, look no further than Now You Know.",1219104000,,998,4.522222222222222
2654360,5,B000ICL3L0,"If you love Kevin Smith, this movie is right up your alley.  It's kind of a cross between Clerks 2 and Chasing Amy.  Very well written with great acting plus great bonus features featuring Kevin Smith.  Highly recommended.",1200009600,,222,4.7894736842105265

2654362,4,B000ICL3L0,"Very well written and cast! Great chemistry between all the actors and awsome dialog! Plot is good and transitions between subplots and storylines are grade A, absolutely terrific!

Scene in the bar w/ the alcoholic chick was one of the funniest scenes I've seen in a long time! Not to mention the entire B&E plot...kinda makes me want to go break into some houses and do the same thing!

Only thing wrong with this film is all technical things. Blocking, sound, not enough footage to edit properly, camera focus, etc. However, considering that this IS an indie budget film w/ limited funds and time, all the technical things are forgivable and will be overlooked.

This film is excellent! A MUST OWN!",1185235200,,701,4.776859504132231
2654363,3,B000ICL3L0,"It's nice to see Jeff Anderson directing and acting again.  Although this was apparently shot in between J&SB and Clerks 2, this low-budget (about $560,000 to shoot) romantic comedy has enough funny bits without getting too boring.  A little forced, perhaps a little lacking in the performances, the script is enough to rise above normal...Anderson seems to have a handle on writing women characters, which is refreshing.",1178496000,,421,5.268656716417911
2654364,4,B000ICL3L0,"Having never seen Jeff Anderson in a film away from the Clerks franchise, I was very curious to see how he did writing, directing AND having a major starring role in a film.  To be honest, he shocked the hell out of me with how well he did.  With a low budget, an inexperienced director, and a limited shooting time, Jeff Anderson made the best of the situation he had.  The film lacked the smoothness of progression that some experienced directors get, but it definitely had a lot of humorous moments and that was coupled with a genuinely heart felt story.  This is a movie I'll enjoy watching again.",1169078400,3,601,4.486238532110092
2654365,4,B000ICL3L0,"In the View Askewniverse, you start to wonder if any of the actors in Kevin Smith's movies manage to break out from the characters they are associated with (with the exception, of course of Jason Lee and Ben Affleck).  Will any of the Jersey locals who act in these films have a bankable career?  Jay Mewes has started to shed his ""Jay"" character, but he's going to have to do something better than ""Bottoms Up.""  I'd love to see Brian O'Halloran do something big as well Marilyn Ghigliotti.

Jeff Anderson, however, turns in a surprise with not only another acting gig, but a writing AND directoral one as well.  And it's really good for a first-time outing from a guy who you feel got ""railroaded"" into the acting world with ""Clerks.""  I almost hate to compare this to a Kevin Smith flick, but Anderson manages to turn out a romantic comedy on par with ""Chasing Amy"" but without the world of monologues that Kevin Smith characters seem to inhabit.  Don't get me wrong, Kevin does brilliant dialogue, but I can imagine for some viewers, they get lost with all the talking, the witticisms, and the inside jokes.  So flame me that I dare blaspheme and say that Anderson churned out something on par with (or maybe slightly better than) ""Chasing Amy.""

Do I need to review the movie?  Read the other reviews if you need a synopsis.",1167523200,3,1329,4.569620253164557
2654366,3,B000ICL3L0,"This is one of those films you watch once and never again or at least not for awhile. The movie kind of drags on and you'll say, ""Get to the point, already!""

This film is funny, but not over-the-top, so don't expect it to be anything Kevin Smith-like.

It's amazing how Anderson was able to write from a man's point of view as well as a womans. The DVD bonus features has a Q&A with the director and someone asked Anderson how he was able to do that. (I believe he said he watches a lot of Oprah.)

For a first time writer/director,Jeff Anderson did an okay job.",1167264000,2,563,4.194444444444445
