There are two different films called 'A Man Betrayed'.  If you're looking for the one with John Wayne, you want the 1941 version.  This one - starring Edward J. Nugent and directed by John H. Auer was released in 1936.  I have not watched this movie personally but wanted to make sure that you knew the difference.",1329264000,4,439,4.45
8599724,1,B000EOTVH0,"I ordered this book because I wanted to get some old John Wayne movies for someone. It comes up under John Wayne movies, however, now that I got it I see no John Wayne referral or info at all. There is a John Wray and it is directed by John Auer, but no John Wayne.  Unless he has such a small part he's not even mentioned on the cover?",1323043200,,336,3.869565217391304
