8758014,2,B01E7ZFPF8,"Detestable story, even by the standards of the ""Old Testament!"" Ugly, incoherent, wordy libretto, even by the standards of 18th C stilted rhetoric! Whole arias of Handel's least inspired, most perfunctory ""big bow-wow"" -- that term borrowed from George Orwell -- with all the best bits merely recycled from his much earlier Italian cantatas, here setting unspeakble English doggerel! News, news! Not everything Handel composed is equally great.

Yes, I am reviewing the music -- ah, how presumptuous of me! -- but I have a few words for the production also. It's lavish, vivid, and a bit disgusting. The libretto is herky-jerky, so inevitably the production is likewise. And loooong! And certainly not congruent with any explicit intentions or sensibilities of 18th C England. Why do we have to swaddle ""historically informed"" musicality in Regietheater decadence? What, by the way, an 18th C Englishman would have heard and felt, hearing this sung as an oratorio, I fear we can no longer hear or feel. We are on a different grid of perceptions, as Foucault might have said; The ""wholeness"" of the 18th C world-view is irretrievable. ""Saul"" is worth performing only if the music is splendid enough to communicate something to us. ""Early Music"" is my passion and my career, but this performance doesn't communicate much to me. Musically, the weakest element is Iestyn Davies -- the pride of British countertenors -- in the role of David. Davies has less stage presence than a plate of chips! A staged opera on DVD is a VISUAL art form and Davies just doesn't look like any kind of hero, not even a scarcely-fledged boy.

And you want to know the worst? I'll be seeing the revival of this production live at Glynedebourne this August, having paid over 600 pounds for the privilege of giving it a second chance.",1530144000,2,1808,4.905228758169935
8758015,5,B01E7ZFPF8,"Very much old fashioned as they might be as a form of music, Handel's oratorios have proven to still have tremendous vitality in modern performances. More informed use of specialised period instruments in the hands of skilled musicians helps and some fine singers can bring the wonder of the music to life, but the works benefit just as much from efforts to make them visually appealing as stage works. The nature of the Biblical origins of those stories and the format Handel developed in the oratorio present some difficulties on that front, but Glyndebourne's acclaimed 2015 production of Saul is a perfect example of what can be done with an imaginative director on board.

As far as the musical performance of the work goes, there's little cause for concern. The composer's first English oratorio Saul has a tremendous character of its own, Handel by-passing the limitations that the opera format had placed on him by keeping arias short and free from repetition or da capo, using a larger scale orchestration than previously and introducing new instrumental colour, punctuating the work with short instrumental ""Symphony"" passages and high-impact choruses. Even if it wasn't written to be performed like an opera, there's a lot of dramatic colour in Saul and Ivor Bolton conducts the Orchestra of the Age of the Enlightenment with all the necessary dynamic, capturing the sheer exuberance of the heightened passions while at the same time retaining the beauty and subtlety of more noble qualities expressed in the work.

Director Barrie Kosky's approach to the staging is a little less straightforward. The Australian director, who is also the Intendant at the Komische Oper in Berlin, operates in a style that is very much his own. A distinct, individual approach however works well in translating and putting across all the colour of Baroque opera for a modern audience who might otherwise find its structure and conventions dry, unappealing and unapproachable. Coming from the Biblical story of the Book of Samuel, the story of David and Saul is a familiar one, but not one that you would immediately consider lending itself to great music theatre, much less a high concept reinterpretation of it. Handel, with his librettist Charles Jennens however give the story a colourful setting, with a particularly explosive opening and a magnificent finale. Barrie Kosky's approach seems to be simply to put those musical flourishes into visual terms, but not entirely in abstraction, retaining as much as possible of the essence of the emotional sentiments and the dramatic situation that provokes them in order for it all to remain meaningful.

You might think never think of the opening of Saul in the context of a huge feast on a banquet table before a colourfully dressed group of Israelites in 18th century costume, but there's no question that Kosky's vision for this setting entirely gets across the essence of Handel's music.  He uses a wide range of effects, employing extravagant, surprising and grotesque ways of putting the dynamic across, using dance, movement, shouted interjections and shock imagery.  All of this is justified by the exuberance and extravagance that is found in Handel's composition itself - or if not justified, it at least abiding by the spirit of work. It might not appear to follow the stage directions of the libretto to the letter (although strictly there are no real stage directions to be followed in an oratorio), it still manages to adhere to the essential themes and intent of the work. Joyous celebration at the start of Saul is followed by anger, jealousy and love complications and ends in tragedy, mourning and reflection, but Handel no longer has to compartmentalise these sentiments according to old opera seria rules in the musical construction he develops for his oratorio.

That richness is reflected in the musical interpretation at Glyndebourne under Ivor Bolton, and it certainly finds an equivalent visual representation under Kosky's direction, but it's also matched on a performance level by the singing. Handel's music is a driving force in itself, but the dramatic emphasis that it requires often comes from the strength of individual performances. Unquestionably, it's Saul who is the centre of all the dramatic conflict in this oratorio, and it could hardly have a more driven Saul than the interpretation given here by Christopher Purves. Under Kosky's direction he's given full rein here to delve deep into his character's torment, and Purves expresses that fully in the beauty and nuance of the voice as well as in the very physical performance.  Contrasted with this is a more reflective compassionate treatment of David and Jonathan, which find perfect expression in the performances of Iestyn Davies's lyrical countertenor David and Paul Appleby's noble Jonathan. The roles of Saul's daughters Michal and Merab are less well established, but the more sympathetic Michal comes across better in Sophie Bevan's performance, her undisguised glee at Saul's change of heart over her love for David adding another level of tone and amusement that fits in well with the intentions of the production. The gorgeous chorus writing that also plays such an important part in the overall tone of the work is superbly handed by The Glyndebourne Chorus.",1478390400,5,5307,5.14252607184241
8758016,3,B01E7ZFPF8,"Well conducted, fine chorus, but the acting was often either stiff or sophomoric.",1472774400,2,81,5.3076923076923075
8758017,4,B01E7ZFPF8,"Unlike his operas, Handels oratorios were explicitly intended not to be staged, as they were frequently performed during Lent, when secular entertainments were forbidden.  Nonetheless, many of the oratorios recount dramatic stories and take well to the theater.

Twenty years ago Peter Sellars brought Theodora to the stage at Glyndebourne.  Since then, we have seen staged versions of Acis and Galatea, Belshazzar, Hercules, Semele, and even Messiah.  Now Glyndebourne brings us Saul in a production directed by Barrie Kosky.

The staging of Saul is more elaborate than in most of these other productions.  The first part appears to take place at a banquet celebrating the Israelites victory over the Philistines.  (This performance is divided into two parts rather than the original three acts.)  The chorus wears extravagant 18th-century-style costumes, and the tables are decorated with equally extravagant floral arrangements.  The high priest  for some peculiar reason  appears to be attired as a court jester, in white-face and wearing a ruff.  Theres a lot of dancing and some shouting and other vocalizing thats not in the score.  Its all quite enjoyable, although Handels music could carry the drama of Sauls developing madness without all this help.

In the second part (the second half of Act II and Act III), a field of candles initially fills the stage, and as Sauls madness deepens, the chorus extinguishes the candles.  The depiction of Sauls visit to the Witch of Endor is strange: The witch has pendulous breasts, from which Saul drinks; at the end, she kisses Saul. The witch brings up the spirit of Samuel, who predicts that Saul will be defeated by the Philistines and lose his kingdom.  During the ensuing Dead March, the stage is covered with bodies of dead Israelites, including Saul and Jonathan.  Saul appears to have been beheaded, parallel to Davids disposition of Goliath at the beginning of the story, but non-Biblical.  At the end, the chorus lauds David, while dancers add some extraneous screams.

Whatever one thinks of the staging, the musical performance is superb.  Ivor Bolton directs the vocalists and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.  Without exception, the soloists are excellent.  The booklet contains a fine essay on Saul by Ruth Smith.

Handelians will want to see this performance.  How it will wear remains to be seen.

Update (Juiy 2017): Answer, not well. I traded this in. Couldn't bear to watch it again.",1468022400,15,2464,5.130653266331659
