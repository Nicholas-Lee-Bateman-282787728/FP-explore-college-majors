3101243,5,B00132D7TA,I saw this movie at the Fort Lauderdale Film Festival.  I started laughing from the first scene and didn't stop until the end. (Watch the credits).  Thought the writing was terrific and Larry Miller was the funniest yet. All the characters are great.  Can't wait to see it again.,1209513600,,279,4.653061224489796
3101244,5,B00132D7TA,I saw this film in Ft. Lauderdale at the Film Festival.  The writer Evan Wasserstrom is a genius!!  It reminded me of Ferris Bueller meets Fast times at Ridgemont High!  Hysterical and blew away movies like American Pie!! Highly recommended!!!,1209168000,4,243,5.025
3101245,4,B00132D7TA,"I saw the debut of this film at the Ft. Lauderdale Film Fest and was impressed with the lead actor and the director.  This somewhat raunchy comedy is not the genre that I usually seek out but this film had some truly funny moments, and the comic timing was excellent.  The lead actor reminds me of a young John Cusack.  The director Nick Weiss spoke at the Q&A afterwards, and I was shocked to learn that the film was shot in 3 weeks!  It looks great!  I'm glad to see it was picked up for release. Check it out - I do think we'll be seeing more from these folks in the future.",1208908800,2,577,4.070796460176991

3101248,2,B00132D7TA,"The premise of this movie is pretty straightforward: every year, according to a tradition, the senior class takes a day off. The Principal of the school is determined to wreck the plans of the senior class. A geeky dude is caught in the middle of it all.

One of the ""innovations"" of this film is to feature 2 alumni of party movies & teen flicks - this time as the adult figures. Lea Thompson (Some Kind of Wonderful (Special Collector's Edition), All the Right Moves and Casual Sex?) stars as the mother of the geek. As she's about my age, this film made me feel kind of old!

Meanwhile, Tara Reid (American Pie - Unrated (Widescreen Collector's Edition) and National Lampoon's Van Wilder - Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)) is the geek's older sister. Obviously, the inside joke is that Thompson & Reid used to be in these very sorts of films starring as the teens-running-amock.

Ultimately, while the nostalgia of Thompson & Reid was nice, I found this film on the lame side. There are a comical parts, but nothing that made me have a guffaw of a laugh. The funeral that supposedly lasts the whole day is well beyond the realm of believablity. Also, for a film that advertises itself as ""unrated and uncut,"" it's on the tame side. It's a far cry from crazy flicks such as National Lampoon's Animal House and Old School (Widescreen Unrated Edition).

So, if you're in the market for a party movie, I would pass this one over as there are plenty of other PM flicks that are much more worthwhile. This one isn't terrible (perhaps just a shade shy of 3 stars), but isn't noteworthy, either. Perhaps the one thing that might draw the curious to this film is Lea Thompson playing the mother in a party flick. Of course, that's pretty much just out of nostalgia alone.",1244678400,7,1768,4.5854430379746836
3101249,1,B00132D7TA,"What are these other reviewers thinking??!!  I bought this because so many of them said it was funny, yet there was not one laugh to be had in the whole movie.  The acting is just awful, and Tara, Lea, and Norm had glorified 2 minutes each and were just along for a paycheck.  A truly bad movie.  One of the worst and unfunniest movies I have ever seen.  If I could give 0 stars, I would have.  They just do not make good teen comedies anymore.  Any of the American Pie movies were 10,000 times funnier and better written and acted.",1242691200,6,532,4.207920792079208
3101250,2,B00132D7TA,"""Skip Day"" is about a student who screws up the 'skip day' party by letting the principal know where it was to be held. He redeems himself by having the party at his place.

The plot, if you can call it one, is the principal trying to find where it is to bust it but is sent on a wild goose chase instead, all while the dork having the party wants to win over a girl, but the girl is taken by a guy who is the typical moron that is only after one thing and is typically cheating on her and doesn't deserve her and ...euhh... blah blah blah blah... you know what comes next.

Nothing original, and nothing that stood out well enough to call it memorable. See it if you can't get enough of the party movies, but don't expect anything to have you rolling on the floor with laughter.

Edit: well, it's now 2011, and I have no recollection of ever seeing this movie. Guess that proves what I said about it being memorable!",1215302400,4,917,4.140449438202247
3101251,2,B00132D7TA,"I watched this movie with an open mind, considering the reviews of how great the movie was. I just watched and yeah it has it's funny moments, i'll give it that. But they are few and far between.

It is a clever movie, and it could have been a fun watch, if there had not been so much focus on a sexy girl dancing just about every 5 minutes and swearing happening just about every 30 seconds. I am a fan of American pie it is a guilty pleasure. But this is a fraction of what a american pie was. The stars Norm MacDonald, Lea Thompson, and Tara Reid
get enough screen time to mentioned as cameos.

I am not trying to ruin anyones parade I just would like to let people know what they are in for. Yes, it was good if you like the cheesy national lampoons they release now, which I will say was probably a little  better than that, but not by much. So if you like those cheesy national lampoons movies and can handle swearing every 30 seconds then you could like this movie.

so my over all opinion is this movie is for those who like cheesy comedies without much substance. Which is a lot of people. However it you are looking for the same experience that american pie or animal house gave you could be disappointed.

now as for the positive outlook for which is few, there is some humor that is funny. The principal Larry Miller mainly carries the humor through movie along with the funeral rap song which is mildly amusing.
This also is a start for two up and coming new stars, Gary Lundy and Kayla Ewell who were both pretty good.

It is a shame this movie could have been saved for columbia or warner bros instead of firstlook, if they just tweaked the script a little bit.
You can have a funny movie without constant swearing and sexy girls.
example...animal house, porky's, and american pie.

I give this movie two stars, it could have been three and a half with
a better script. It's funny but, this will probably be the only bad review this movie will get.",1214870400,2,1963,4.289189189189189
