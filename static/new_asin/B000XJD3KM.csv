8228581,2,B000XJD3KM,"I am not that impressed with this DVD. The production seems a bit second rate.  An ok workout if you can get pasted the amateurish
production level",1276300800,,147,4.444444444444445
8228582,4,B000XJD3KM,"Camera angles are not helpful, you can't see what's happening and it seems too close/high. I like the instructor - she does yell (in a kickboxing style), but seems real. Keeps my heart rate up and good alternative to bubbly instructors like The Firm and Cathe Friedrich.",1235347200,,270,4.76595744680851
8228583,5,B000XJD3KM,"I bought this just recently at the local Borders.  At first, I waited for a week only to find it gone.  Fortunately for me, it was there again the next week.  When I tried this DVD, I really loved it.  I'm the type who goes to boot camp classes, so I expect to be pushed beyond my limits.  So far, I've found Billy Blanks to be one of those who really push you in his DVD (like keeping you in those squats for a long time, making you go lower and stay in a squat while delivering a side kick).  When I tried Thrive, however, I found it similar and just enjoyed the whole workout!

The only bad part I found in the workout was that it was too short.  I wish she did longer cardios, made the stomach routines longer (the type that will really leave you very sore.  Instead of repeating eight counts three times, make them do one hundred continuous repetitions [no break!]).  I'd like to see this raised to the level of a very difficult boot camp class because it's a really great workout.  I hope to see more DVDs from Thrive.",1228694400,2,1024,4.173469387755102
8228584,3,B000XJD3KM,"I can honestly say that over the years I have at least TRIED every kickbox video/DVD that has been made.  This is the first one that actually bored me before completion the very first time I tried it.

I gave it 3 stars because it IS an intermediate level kickbox DVD.  The reason I am so down on it is because I didn't feel any charisma or energy from the young instructor.  While her form was good, her idea of encouragement to her class was yelling, ""LET'S GO; LET'S GO!""  She came off a lot more as angry drill sargent than kickbox instructor (I'm not fond of the bootcamp genre of DVD).  Her class did appear to be just regular gals from the neighborhood, including one she kept insisting had NEVER done this before (gee, not even to prep for the cameras?), and they didn't look too thrilled either.

I've already sold this one to the local half-price bookstore.",1205107200,3,867,4.415094339622642
8228585,4,B000XJD3KM,"The problem with most kickboxing workouts is the transition from one move to the next as the instructor explains the move, does it slow and then up to tempo.  This workout is no exception.  This workout is taebo flavored complete with counting.  The crew is all female and too many for the limited space.  The set is a boxing ring and the group looks crowded in the space.  The participants are varied in shape and skill.  She seems to bring a fresh feel to it though with her no-nonsense instruction.  She does not mirror cue (her right is your left) which is a minor annoyance.  She gives instruction to a move and then walks through the group correcting form and giving pointers.  The form of some of the moves is not great, but it is still a good workout.  Better if you know how to execute standard moves properly.  There is a fair amount of yelling which will either encourage or annoy you.  The camera crew have a little trouble keeping up with her when she moves through the crowd and returns to the front.  She is a fresh face and you can tell that she is passionate about her craft.  I hope she comes out with more workouts that are move polished.  All in all I do not regret this purchase.",1203984000,3,1200,4.342342342342342
8228586,4,B000XJD3KM,This is a great workout. It is very easy to follow and you will sweat. Helen is very motivating. It reminds me very much of the same moves as the old TAEBO workouts. The only negative part is that it says the cardio portion is 40 minutes when it is in fact 30 minutes. The DVD in the back says it is 60 minutes long when in fact the workout is 45 minutes total from warm up to cool down. That is why I gave it four stars. I do recommend it. I will use it on the days where I want to take it easy on my cardio>,1201132800,9,509,3.6788990825688073
