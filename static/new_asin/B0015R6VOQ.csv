the other good reviews must have some association with the producers. There is nothing in this video you can't learn by spending 5 min in the local tackle store or online",1317513600,,280,4.30188679245283
8259525,5,B0015R6VOQ,This is a teaching video yet entertaining. I now know more about fishing for walleye than I ever did. Mike is someone you automatically feel comfortable with and would like to be along fishing with him. I would recommend it to anyone looking for advice on walleye fishing.,1243987200,,272,4.6875
8259526,5,B0015R6VOQ,"Great video! If you are a Walleye fisherman and you want to try Planer Boards and other trolling techniques, I really think you'll like this DVD. Trolling crank baits, worm harnesses, and bottom bouncers with Planer boards are what this DVD is all about. It's not the when and where, but how to set-up and use different trolling techniques.",1225670400,,340,4.779661016949152
8259527,1,B0015R6VOQ,"This must have taken all of 2 hours to produce...a few ""tips"" on crankbaits and gadgets...nada on where, when, temp, or bottom rigs....save your money for beer and bait.....or try a different DVD...",1207526400,,198,5.03030303030303
