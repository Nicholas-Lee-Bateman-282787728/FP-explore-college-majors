2163671,3,B0006354CA,"The main actor is the Christopher Lambert (""Highlander"") of Brazil. He plays the role in an almost totally deadpan manner. It is very hard to put yourself into his shoes, because he appears to be a morose sociopath. Brazil is depicted as corrupt and violent. A very, very dark and depressing film.",1246492800,,297,4.730769230769231
2163672,4,B0006354CA,"This film follows the downward spiral of Maiquel, a man who wants to be ""normal"".  A man who kills the first time in passion, but becomes a local neighborhood hero when he is hired by several rich men, one of whom is his dentist, for revenge killings.  The vigilante quickly rises to an empire of ""neighborhood protection"" that is fronted by a ""security company"".
His desire to remain a good man and a few bad-luck events lead to a marriage to the woman who is pregnant with his daughter.  The marriage goes bad for several reasons, but what becomes evident from the point of his marriage is the fact that Maiquel is really being moved by those around him.
We see Maiquel's conscience unwind as he takes up the mantle of local security.  He is moved, like a pawn, from killing to killing, and sees his life, his friends and those he thought he loved alienated by his inability to control his crumbling life.
The movie is fast-paced, very intense (if not somewhat unbelievable), and builds quickly to what should be a confrontation with Maiquel's own understanding of how he has been used.  Ultimately, Maiquel faces his own demons; this is where the movie really could have flared and the ending is why I offer only 4 and not 5 stars.  Unfortunately, the ending is a bit of a let-down after the taut build-up.
Still, it is a very good movie with excellent acting (a few stragglers aside), exceptional direction and cinematography work and a very good script that carried conversations that were real, believable.  I highly recommend this film; it won't be something that those who don't like this type of film will enjoy but it is top-tier in the genre.

Based upon a novel by Patricia Melo Matador, I am hoping that the book will be translated to English as I am sure that it would be an exceptional read.

The film was made in Brazil and because of the fast pace of the film, the subtitles for the Portuguese dialogue move fast, so you need a quick eye or a rewind button sometimes in order to keep up.

Enjoy!",1224806400,3,2012,4.533149171270718
2163673,3,B0006354CA,"At the beginning of this film Maiquel could never imagine killing a person; by the end of the film he could not not kill. The film consists largely of Maiquel's grotesque transformation. He first killed an acquaintance in a fit of rage after being taunted for dying his hair blond. Wracked with guilt and fear, he was shocked to find that the Rio locals thanked him for his vigilante justice and for ""keeping trash off the street."" A dentist then employs him to take revenge for raping his daughter. Before it's over Maiquel murders his own girl friend, has an album full of newspaper clippings about the people he killed, a thriving ""protection"" agency, a massive mansion, and more money than he could spend. Along the way he refuses every exit ramp that might have led him down a better path: marriage, the birth of his daughter, the prick of conscience, the Christian conversion of his second girl friend, and a close brush with the otherwise corrupt police. At one point he even vowed, ""I want to change and become a normal person."" But it was not to be. Clearly, violence begat more violence.",1170201600,2,1097,4.65979381443299

Maybe, because of language differences the only most bankable and acclaimed non-W. European masterpieces reach a broad English-speaking auditorium, viewer's amusement for actors performing and a sex-drugs-murdering scenes balance is hardly of any wondering already.

Professional killer's pet piglet in a movie is a touching nuance might be comprehended as a hidden hint on a way of the leaving where a human life in exchange for teeth fixing initiates less emotions than a birthday meal.

I think it is a good film.",1158105600,,1031,7.102362204724409
2163675,5,B0006354CA,"Murilo Benicio has again demonstrated an amazing range of acting ability in this most outstanding film. He plays a young man named Miqual Jorge who has no apparent direction in life, no visible means of support, and who lives in a lower class neighborhood in Rio De Janeiro. However, with one unusual change in his appearance, having dyed his hair blonde, he achieved a change in his personality, one which created a destiny he never imagined for himself ... which sealed his fate. This one event helped him act on a dare and find a new bravado that became his persona. He engaged in behavior which under most circumstances is criminal but which for him won a new life, respect and fame. It also complicated his future in ways he never imagined ... Although the subject of the film is somewhat shocking, the viewer becomes sympathetic to Miqual as one understands how his rather simple life turns into a nightmare from which he can not escape. He becomes powerless to change direction once forces are set into motion. He becomes a victim of the circumstances he created just by one or two decisions.

After his hair color changed, he got into a physical relationship with the attractive hairdresser, Cledir. He took her to his Uncle's corner bar, where a neighborhood thief and bully mocked his dyed hair and made innuendoes about being gay and looking like a gringo. On a spur of the moment decision, Miqual Jorge challenged the young man to settle the score that night. Miqual obtained a gun, waited a long time for his opponent and dared him to fight. His opponent kept walking with his girlfriend and even mocked, what are you going to do, shoot me ... which Miqual did. Word got out, that Miqual eliminated the scumbag who stole from hard working shopkeepers and from innocent pedestrians. When Miqual went to the local dentist, Dr. Caravallo, the dentist suggested Miqual do a contract killing of another low life, one who had raped his daughter. Several wealthy businessmen helped create a business, complete with an office and telephone answering machine, where Miqual's skills were for hire. All this met with the implicit approval of the local police whose hands were often tied by laws which protected the rights of criminals.

Cledir became pregnant as Miqual found a new direction for his life. Initially, he was reluctant to marry but then after meeting her mother, he committed to settling down, having a normal job and raising a family, even going to church. Miqual had inherited the responsiblity to provide a home, food, and clothing to Erica, the 15 year old girlfriend of the man he had killed. She lived in his former bachelor's apartment, after Cledir and he had married. Unfortunately, Miqual succombed to temptation and had an affair with her. She was young and demanding, wanted him to get rid of his wife. Sadly, an unexpected accident caused Cledir to die - they had to cover up her death, to make it look like a disappearance. This worked fine until her body was discovered buried in the backyard of one of Miqual's assistant's who worked with him in his contract murder job. Erica and he lived an upper middle class lifestyle until this event unraveled their cosy existence. She confessed to knowing about neighborhood murders to an Evangelical minister, her guilty conscience was washed free as she found solace in religion, but at the same time, this information threatened to destroy Miqual and his newly created lifestyle. Miqual was forced to act - again digging himself deeper into the quagmire from which there is no return ... This film is a fascinating study of how a few decisions can lock a directionless young man into a life of crime from which there is no escape. Murilo Benicio never ceases to amaze with his wide-range of acting ability. Erika Borsos (pepper flower)",1154563200,6,3811,4.807926829268292
2163676,4,B0006354CA,"Murilo Benecio is a young Brazilian actor who just keeps turning out fine, solid and very different character roles.  As the leading character is this well made film by director Jose Henrique Fonseca from a script written by his father Rubem Fonseca in turn based on the novel 'O Matador' by Patricia Melo, Benecio molds a memorable portrait of a man of low self esteem who is strangely and inadvertently raised to the level of hero in the most bizarre of circumstances.

The setting is Rio de Janiero and Maiquel is a loner looking for an identity. On a bet he decides to have his dark hair bleached by the beautiful beautician Cledir (Claudia Abreu) and finds that as he steps back into his world he is the object of notice.  After a cruel teasing by thug Suel (Wagner Moura) he buys a gun and almost unwittingly kills Suel who dies in the arms of his girlfriend Erica (Natalia Lage).  Despite Maiquel's fears of his arrest he finds that the neighborhood rewards  him for ridding them of a criminal and Maiquel becomes a hero.  Not only is he rewarded with gifts (including a pet pig he names Bill after watching Bill Clinton's visit to Brazil on TV!), he is also given free dental work by Dr. Carvalho (Jorge Doria) in exchange for agreeing to kill an enemy of the dentist.  More and more people ask Maiquel to whack bad people making Maiguel's new blond persona a hit man and man of the year.  How he ultimately begins to spiral downward when his life is complicated by a marriage and family and holding a regular job forces him to initiate his own choices of violence and  return to his original hair color to alter his destiny!

If the story sounds odd, it is really a depiction of life in the city of Rio where the police are impotent to control the violence that prevails.  Maiquel becomes the Robin Hood/Batman type who brings a degree of safety to his community.  Wisely Benecio holds our attention and our compassion as he performs his many murders, creating a man in whom we can believe and applaud despite the grim things he does.

The cast is uniformly fine and the cinematography by  Breno Silveira  and the musical score by Dado Villa-Lobos  (an important guitar player, relation to composer Heitor Villa-Lobos unknown!) is classy.  This is yet another fine film from Brazil, in Portuguese, and one that deserves wide attention - especially for Murilo Benecio's superb performance.  Recommended.

2163677,4,B0006354CA,"This film never made it into american theaters (besides a few festivals where it won awards) but it is an outstandingly brash film, and gorgeous to look at.  My only criticism might be the ending being a little disappointing, but the lead up is well worth it.",1121644800,10,259,4.51063829787234
8037775,5,B0006354CA,"Maiquel (Murilo Bencio) is a simple man living in Rio de Janeiro and after he loses a football bet he has to dye his hair blond. When he looks in the mirror he sees a different him and he likes what he sees.

Then on entering his local bar, a local crim and trouble maker, Suel (a very young Wagner Moura), insults him. Maiquel broods on it and then decides to do something about it. This leads to his life changing beyond recognition as his actions catapult him from the scared ordinary man he was to something he had never dreamt of.

Now to say anymore would spoil the plot and, more importantly, the fun, as this is a crime story, a comedy, a love story and a great watch all combined. Everyone plays their parts beautifully and the pacing is perfect. This is one of those films where if you blink you are going to miss something. The humour isn't forced either as it seems to play perfectly with the actual situations. There is some violence too so this is not a parody or anything and when it need to get serious it does not really pull its punches either.

This is a film I completely loved and it is in Portuguese with some good sub titles, but not the best, and is one of those films where if you were not a fan of World cinema before you watched it, then you most certainly will be by the end.",1476748800,,1303,4.183266932270916

8037782,4,B0006354CA,"Cast, performance and camera work is quite good- the scene at 51:24 (roasted pig) sums it up.

The story line does not dwell much into character development, as people come in and out of the picture around a man who, seemingly without his own volition, becomes a serial killer.  Plot has all the ingredients of gang violence, murder for hire, protection racket, crooked law enforcement and rich elites who make their own laws.  Everyone pays in the end except principal character who gives himself a second chance in life...although he does not struck as a long term planner or deep thinker.

What makes this movie worth seeing is in the title.  The man of the year is not just a portrayal of the psychopath serial killer but also of society/government that condones  violence as ""acceptable"" or even ""beneficial"".",1330128000,,814,4.86231884057971
8037783,5,B0006354CA,"Hands down one of my favorite movies. This ranks up there with my other international-brazilian favorite...City of God!!! The story of a man who becomes a hero too many, while making a few enemies along the way!! If you have not seen this movie...please take the plunge!!! If you don't mind the subtitles (Spanish is the spoken language here!!) then its ok, the subtitles are great...if you know Spanish, then its a definite for you!!! The movie doesn't have a dull moment..no rambling...the action just keeps on going!!! I definitely recommend this movie for your collection...it was a little pricey...only because it was banned in most countries just like City of God, and these movies are the types that you have to do a little searching for...unless you go straight to Amazon...then its all good!!!",1321142400,,802,4.948148148148148
