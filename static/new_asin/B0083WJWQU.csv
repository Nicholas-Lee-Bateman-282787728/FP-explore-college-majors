You won't feel like it wasn't vigorous enough!",1418169600,,128,4.608695652173913

Great, challenging workout for advanced.",1395014400,4,128,4.608695652173913
8524865,5,B0083WJWQU,"I'm fairly new to Mike Donavanik and his workouts. He is wonderful, calm and encouraging. AND he kicks my butt! I bought all of his because they are so great and will definitely be on the lookout for new ones on the horizon. All are very effective and challenging! I also really enjoy doing these which is imperative to my workout experience. No dread factor here. Just good hard work and Mike's motivation to push hard. I love all of his workouts and highly recommend!",1390348800,3,469,4.529411764705882
8524866,5,B0083WJWQU,"Fabulous four-limb workout! Needed: two sets of weights, mat. The workouts do not use a lot of space, so it's easy to do at home. The workout uses timed intervals, either 1 minute or 30 seconds per exercise. The four-limb movements, which use heavy weights for the first toning interval and lighter weights for the second interval, are innovative and effective. The DVD comes with a workout chart that organizes the 2 workouts and escalates intensity and duration. If you stick with this, you *will* see results. I like Donavanik's winning persona and style; he's tough, buff, and encouraging. His previews of the moves show good form. He does not show a low version; modeled are normal and supertough. Those new to four-limb workouts and contralateral movements may want to try this without weights the first time or so to get the form down before adding weight.",1387065600,6,863,4.877551020408164
8524867,5,B0083WJWQU,"I am a workout dvd junkie and have tried nearly every intermediate/advanced dvd there is on the market but this surpasses them all in terms of efficiency and results. I have been blown away by how effective these metabolic workouts are ! I used to think that in order to get fantastic results one had to workout for at least an hour , but this has proved me wrong. Having reached a plateau I needed something new to inspire me and this fit the bill perfectly . I cannot praise Mike and his workouts highly enough and recommend them to anyone looking for a time-efficient workout with guaranteed results. Thank you Mike !!!!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mike-Donavanik-s-Extreme-Burn-Metabolic-Conditioning/dp/B0083WJWQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mike Donavanik's Extreme Burn: Metabolic Conditioning</a>",1375056000,4,844,5.983471074380165
