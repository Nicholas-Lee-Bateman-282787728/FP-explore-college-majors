557541,5,6303063705,"This is a classic of romance with Charles Boyer. The main hero gently court a young woman on a transatlantic ship on its way to New York. The trip ends with a rendez-vous at the top of the Empire State Building in three months for an instant wedding. But the lady has an accident on her way to the rendez-vous, at the very foot of the Empire State Building, and remains a cripple. She does not have her lover know about it. So he waits in vain, he goes back to France and then comes back to New York and he finally discovers the truth. So he visits her on Christmas day and this last scene is the sweet and sour French touch. He accuses himself to have missed the rendez-vous. She plays the game. He offers her a present that represents their first transtlantic journey and the broken promise, broken by him he says. Till the very last minute we do not know which one of the sweet or the sour will take over, love reconquered or a final departure. The ending of course is happy, but the art of the film is in all the nuances and subtleties of the dialogue and of the situations. Charles Boyer obviously brought a French touch to very common romance films in the thirties.

557542,1,6303063705,"This is an abominably engineered DVD of a great movie.  It isn't worth one cent of its bargain-basement price.  Don't buy it -- get this title on VHS instead.  Overall, both picture and sound are worse than the VHS version.  It appears to have been produced by simply copying a tape version onto a disc.  The picture is frequently blurred, and the soundtrack contains what appear to be fragments of conversations and music in the studio where it was recorded.  The soundtrack also is done in a ""pseudo-surround"" format, consisting of distributing the entire track (voices and music) equally over all five speakers.  The dialogue is also frequently hard to make out.  I would be doubtful about any DVD from this distributor,  MADACY entertainment.",1014249600,17,746,4.951612903225806

557544,5,6303063705,"'Love Affair' is rightly remembered as one of Hollywood's greatest romances - Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne make such a wonderful, witty, loving couple; and the central sequence at the grandmother's, where the 'real world' is replaced by a timeless, fairy-tale, transformative one, is literally magical.  But 'Love Affair' proves how sophisticated Hollywood used to be - look at the way the film moves from public to private, from cynical public marriages and affairs to true private love; and the way its themes are expressed through art - Dunne is a singer, Boyer a painter - which similarly moves from public exploitation to private truth-telling and reconciliation.  What makes this such a moving masterpiece, however, is its tacit elegy for a world plunging into totalitarian barbarism, with the dying grandmother and refugee Boyer as the fragile keepers of a terrifyingly vulnerable European culture.",988329600,21,906,5.328671328671328
557545,3,6303063705,"Although this original 1939 version of the thrice-told story is usually hailed as the best of the lot, today it seems slow and more melodramatic than romantic. In the first hashing of this story, Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer play the star-crossed pair on a transatlantic cruiser and fall in love. They plan to meet at the Empire State Building in several months, but an accident prevents Dunne from showing up. The end is perhaps the best scene, in which Boyer discovers what happened to Dunne- it's one of the few believable scenes in the picture.
Unfortunately, casting is not as believable. Irene Dunne chirps and quips her way through the picture, and does not seem to be acting up to her caliber until the last emotional scene (Why was this, of all of Dunne's finest performances, nominated for an Oscar?). Charles Boyer fares somewhat better, when that heavy French accent doesn't get in the way. Marie Ouspenskaya is indeed very good as Boyer's wise grandmother.
The cinematography is very good, and costumes are very good. Unfortunately, both fail completely saving the picture. For a better version, see ""An Affair to Remember"" the REAL best of the lot: Chemistry between Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr is much deeper and more enchanting, and glowing Technicolor adds a real nice touch to the story. Even in the role of the grandmother, Cathleen Nesbitt fares better than Marie Ouspenskaya. Although ""Affair"" is pretty much a shot-for-shot remake of this film, it's worth it to see Cary and Deborah look into each other's eyes.",976233600,12,1534,4.903846153846154
557546,2,6303063705,"I bought this dvd because of some of the reviews and I was sorry. The acting, especially the actress', was shallow and unbelievable. How did they fall so deeply in love from just a few conversations? Anyway, my wife chastised me for crying at the end (maybe I was crying over the waste of money?). Now how am I going to get rid of it. The actress made it sound like she would be able to WALK again, so what's the big detail, more time in rehab? I thought that Matrix had a more star-crossed relationship between Trinity and Neo.",970531200,3,528,4.29

557548,5,6303063705,"Another gem from that sterling year of 1939. Noted for the fact that the script was constantly changing almost daily with additions/improvements; the result is a remarkably seamless and engaging love story. A multi-kleenex weepie inspired countless romantic dreams of true love atop the Empire State Building. An excellent example of a subtle blend of comedy/drama, it's witty at first then becomes more subdued with plenty of romance and drama during the second half; yet it never cloys. The song ""Wishing"", (which is heard in the children's ward scene) was nominated for best song of 1939 (""Over the Rainbow"" won) Leo McCarey remade this as ""An Affair to Remember"" which is better known--but it's essentially the more artificial and glossier version--any film buff will tell you that this is a much better movie!",944697600,14,814,5.12781954887218

557700,5,6303063705,"I will forever consider this 1939 classic to be one of the greatest love stories of all time. Yes, right up there with the classic tales such as Romeo & Juliet. I have viewed this film before via Turner Classic movies and was unfortunately, disappointed by the quality of the film, with both sound and visual issues that detracted from the poignant love story. You can imagine then, how completely thrilled I was with this remade, digitally restored version in which my sole focus could be on, love! Watching this classic in it's re-mastered brilliance allowed me to focus on the subtle nuances of the characters and watch the careful restraint with which both leading actors delivered their characters to us, yes, mind blowing! It continues to amaze me that ""Love Affair"" is an almost forgotten film, that so many film lovers have not yet viewed this romantic masterpiece is beyond me. Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne are absolutely stellar  in their performances about a transatlantic romance, their onscreen chemistry is absolutely palpable. The two meet on a cruise ship and are engaged to others, yet, they fall in-love with one another despite these variables. By the end of their voyage, they agree to meet one another in six months, atop the Empire State Building. When fate and reality step in, your heart will literally be wrenched from your chest as you find yourself rooting for this loving couple to find one another again. I know this film was remade, but there is just something so magical about these two actors, the spell that they are able to cast on this story and how effortlessly they deliver their performances. ""Love Affair"" is completely and utterly one of the greatest love stories that has ever been told.",1433376000,2,1729,4.841216216216216

557733,5,6303063705,"I love this version of the ""Love Affair"" play adaptation.  Irene Dunne is a wonderful leading lady, with a mixture of gumption, humor, and a graceful quality that you don't find much anymore.  Charles Boyer is a very dashing and brooding leading man, and although I think it would be fun to see Cary Grant with Irene Dunne in this picture, I think Charles Boyer's performance is a bit more sincere.
As a smaller note RKO pictures in general seem to be a delight, from the beautiful Art Deco sets and costuming to the actors that they had under contract.  They are gems!
Here's a fun note, notice when Dunne and Boyer are out chatting on the deck of the ship, that you can see their shadows on the screen projecting the seascape behind them...whooooops!! Lol",1428278400,,757,4.551470588235294
557734,5,6303063705,"Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer, need I say more?? This is a classic movie that for some reason people don't seem to know about.  Mainly due the fact that it was redone as An Affair to Remember with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr in the lead roles in 1957 and then again in 1994 as Love Affair, starring Warren Beatty and Annette Bening.  However, having seen these other versions, in my opinion, this original version is the best. The innocent meeting between Charles and Irene on the ocean liner and then the slow build up of sparks between them is done with a style that is messing in today's movies.  The movie was nominated at the academy awards that year for:
  Outstanding Production: RKO Radio
  Best Actress: Irene Dunne
  Best Supporting Actress: Maria Ouspenskaya
  Best Writing (Original Story): Mildred Cram, Leo McCarey
  Best Art Direction: Van Nest Polglase, Al Herman
  Best Original Song: ""Wishing,"" Music and Lyrics by Buddy de Sylva

""Love Affair"" touched the hearts of viewers because the story was plausible, and they empathized with the main characters. Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne make the characters live  in a way that is rarely duplicated today. They do not merely deliver their lines expertly, they internalize every emotion, every nuance of joy or sadness. They speak and act  like real people, not actors schooled in dramatic technique. Some will say that the plot is sentimental and improbable. Perhaps, but many of us have either lived such improbable events ourselves or witnessed them in others. This film works because the human heart is what it is. If we no longer can feel for these characters or rejoice for their love, perhaps it is because something within ourselves has changed. Those who still believe in the power of love will understand. Others will scoff. ""Love Affair"": The emphasis should be on the word ""love,"" not ""affair.""

When I learned it was actually a remake of the 1939 classic with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne I just had to see it. Initially, I thought it would be a little cheesy; but, it was simply delightful.

Charles Boyer was most handsome but a bit tooo smarmy for my tastes esp for 1939, like OOPS I have too many girlfriends vs Cary really trying to love someone wholeheartedly in his interpretration....  absolutely love this story but the 2nd version is my all time favorite, guess the iteration of a classic improves over time, recommend for those who seek the origins of the other two versions.",1360713600,,741,4.648854961832061

Dunne is much too gay all the time (the role is best played when Terry is apprehensive and decision torn). Boyer is diminutive (particularly his head) next to her.  The most important nuance of the entire film is completely blown when Michel/Boyer speaks in such a way as not to admit that he was waiting for Terry/Dunne (Empire State Building)and her reaction instead of poignant (as Kerr's) was sought of an odd knowing smile when it should have been the look of a question mark... as Michel had not as yet disclosed that he was actually there.

557891,5,6303063705,"Watching an old film can present a burden.  Sometimes the sound is not so great.  Sometimes it is hard to get used to the black and white.  ""Love Affair"" has aged well, and prompts its audience to overcome all these barriers.  Irene Dunne is such a special movie star.  Her sparkling smile sets the screen aglow.  It's hard to see how her character Terry can remain so positive throughout all that happens to her. But Dunne brings an inner faith to life in the chapel scene, which makes it all believable.  Her costumes literally sparkle and glow, even through the black & white film.  She was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar that went to Vivian Lee for ""Gone With the Wind.""  Charles Boyer as the playboy and painter brings an international intrigue to his role.  We meet the character at a time when he begins to tire of endless romantic flings and allows the lovely Terry to capture his heart.  Maria Ouspenskaya received a supporting actress Oscar nomination for the film.  This was the year that Hattie McDaniel became the first black actress to win an Oscar for ""Gone With the Wind.""  As Boyer's grandmother, she has a lovely sparkle and zest that captures the audience's heart.  A classical stage actress who studied with Stanislavsky in Russia, she fully embodies the heart of the film.  When Boyer presents her lace shawl to Terry, it is such a bittersweet moment.  ""Love Affair"" is a classic romantic film.  It was nominated for Best Picture of 1939.  ""Gone With the Wind"" took home the honor against an amazingly strong field of nominees: ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""Ninotchka,"" ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" ""Goodbye Mr. Chips,"" Stagecoach,"" ""Wuthering Heights"" & ""Of Mice & Men.""

557893,5,6303063705,"To fully experience the romantic magic of the film, buy all three versions and watch them in order of publication.  Pick a rainy Saturday or a cold-inspired sick day, sit back, and immerse yourself in romance.  Even better, do it with someone you love.

The trinity of romance is 1939's Love Affair, 1957's An Affair to Remember, and 1994's Love Affair.  Each film has its moments of magic and dullness.  Each actor their moments of brillance and failure.  Each scene their nuances of perfection or disaster.  You become so familiar with the story you start paying attention to details you normally miss as the seconds of a film sweep by your eyes on first viewing.  Your appreciation or criticism of the director, actors, sets, and adaptations grows as you watch all three versions. By the time you finish absorbing the movies you'll assemble in your mind the perfect version of the film for you.  My wife's final puzzle of the film is very different than mine, and the hours following our romance-a-thon are filled with discussions, comparisons, likes and dislikes.

1939's version is by far the least expensive.  Yes, it is in desperate need of a remaster, but it is watchable. 1957's version is readily available, looks great, and is only a few dollar more than the original.  1994's version is absolutely the most pricey, whether buying new or used.  It is the most expensive movie in our collection, but to justify the cost I bought all three and assembled them into a gift for my wife. She loved it!  When it comes to romance price should never sully the experience.  Trust me, after watching all three versions in the comfort of your home, romance will fill every room in the house.",1333065600,4,1690,4.739726027397261

557920,5,6303063705,"It is only recently that I learned that `An Affair to Remember` was a remake of a film made in 1939.  `Love Affair` starring Charls Boyer and Irene Dunne.  I found that I was able to watch it on Internet Archive but have now bought my own copy.

What a truely lovely film.  Very sad, especially the sequence with Janou the grandmother and of course, at the end.  What a great combination Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne were.  Before my time, they were really just names to me but now that I have found them I am gradually building up a collection of their films both as a couple and as individuals.

Irene Dunne deserved her Oscar nomination.  What a charming and intelligent actress she was.  I have also just watched her in a comedy.  She seems to have been able to turn her skills to anything.  Charles Boyer wasn`t nominated but I think he should have been, if just for the scene at the end as he finally realises what has happened.  It is some of the most moving acting I have ever seen.  In a minute or so, he manages to convey shock, horror, dismay, sorrow and finally relief that at last he has the answer.  All of this without a word being spoken.  He was an amazing actor.  The more of his work I manage to get, the more I am astonished at his versatility.

I can`t recommend this film highly enough.  It is a joy to watch and is far superior to the remake.",1315008000,9,1366,4.228682170542636
557921,5,6303063705,"I love this film for many reasons: the actors do a splendid job; the idyllic scene at Marnet's home with his mother; the scene in the chapel is incomparable (the Grant/Kerr colorful version takes away the mystical mood that we can see in this original take); the presence of the Empire State Building on the glass window (it reveals its magnificence and splendor during the late thirties); the scene where Irene Dunne sings at a restaurant so full of life; the painting in this story also helps establish the mood for this story; and the final encounter by the protagonists. This is a great romance.

Although this is a great romance, this film is not what you may call a restored version. However, the images were pretty clear and I could understand all the dialogue. And the images described above are quite powerful, in spite of this minor flaw. I think if you love films, you will be able to enjoy this even without restoration.",1302825600,5,932,4.648484848484848
557922,5,6303063705,"Having seen and fallen completely smitten with `An Affair to Remember', I was really excited to dive right into `Love Affair'.  Couple that with the fact that it stars Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer and you have more than a few reasons to see this movie (especially since I think I prefer both of these actors to the two in `An Affair to Remember').

One thing that I was a little disappointed in (actually, the ONLY thing) was that this film, or should I say `An Affair to Remember', is a carbon copy of the other.  They are identical in nearly every way, and that for me is a tad underwhelming.  I shouldn't fault this film AT ALL, since it came first, but I already saw and reviewed `An Affair to Remember' and so I can't call it out.  The fact that it was written and directed by the same director is a tad, well, confusing.  Not to bring up Haneke again, but I had a similar complaint with his English version of `Funny Games' (but that was more on principle than anything else).  I don't see the need to remake a film unless you are going to give it a twist, making it fresh.  Making the SAME EXACT film twenty years after you made the first isn't really making it fresh.

THAT SAID, both versions are pure and delightful and heartfelt and should be seen and adored.  I feel like I'm breaking my own rule by saying this, but I can't help it.

I `heart' both of these movies.

The film tells of playboy Michel who just so happens to be settling down. On a cruise he happens to meet Terry, a charming woman who also happens to be settling down. The two are instantly attracted to one another, but fear that exposure of time spent could bring harmful consequences has them attempting to avoid suspicion. Michel's charm is too much and before long they are spending a lot of time together, innocently at first, but it doesn't take long for genuine feelings to creep up within both parties. They try and separate themselves in order to remain true to their significant others, but their desire runs too deep and before the cruise has ended they have fallen in love. Wanting to be sure that this is the real thing, they decide to separate for six months (giving Michel the opportunity to actually work for his catch in more ways than one) only to reunite on the Empire State Building.

But will they ever meet again?

Irene Dunne is beautifully charismatic as Terry, showing true flirtatious bravado as she strings her man along, and Charles Boyer is her perfect match, layering Michel with a distilled charm that is alluring.  I loved Kerr and Grant and I love Dunne and Boyer.  Specifying who was better is hard (although I will say that Grant delivers the performance of his career in `An Affair to Remember' and may be the best of the four as well) and a task I don't think I want to attempt.  Despite their undeniable similarities, both films do feel fresh and engaging in their own right.

I could have the title mistaken, but the big-band melody is sweet.  Mom said she thinks Irene Dunn wasn't the actual vocal track, but a lip-synch.  So I really don't even know who is singing this song.  However, this old movie is charming to watch.

Without giving away the plot, I'll volunteer that the crisis in this movie is such a tear-jerker it even had me a little misty-eyed before it was over.

In case anyone's wondering, that's really her carolling out ""Sing My Heart"", effortlessly hitting a gooseflesh-inducing high note towards the end , then doubling the stakes with an even higher final one.

This was obviously a class ""A"" effort by RKO when it was made in 1939, with the best of everything that studio had to offer brought to bear on the production.  Unfortunately, something has happened to put ""Love Affair"" into the public-domain category, with the result that we have the film only in badly-duped prints full of splices, jumps, hiss and blur.  ""Love Affair"" deserves the best treatment that Warner Bros., present owners of its surviving elements, could give it if they chose.

Hopefully, ""Love Affair's"" plight will soon rouse the sympathies of George Feltenstein, the Warner's exec who is in charge of restoring the studio's classic catalogue.  While those public-domain dupes will always have a price advantage, seeing ""Love Affair"" restored to Warner Home Video's impeccable standards would be well worth the necessarily higher price.

558062,4,6303063705,"I regard An Affair to Remember (Cary Grant, Deborah Kerr) a very romantic film noted for its well-thought dialogue, wholesome plot and excellent performances by its leading characters. Love Affair was actually a much earlier 1939 production which I watched only now. To my pleasant surprise, despite the nearly identical dialogues and storyline, Love Affair has its own edge and would not be eclipsed by its highly successful successor.

Charles Boyer (Gaslight), with his signature French accent, effortlessly played Michel Marnet - a painter who never had a job and never worried about money. I think Cary Grant a great actor. Yet Charles Boyer was superb in portrayiing a ""playboy"" who enjoys life and does not conform to society and mundane needs. Irene Dunne (Life with Father) was as elegant and beautiful as Greta Garbo. Together the two epitomized the blue-blooded upper class - not just in their look and living style - with an air of royalty around them.

Here lies the first difference between the two films - In Love Affair, Boyer-Dunne looked like blue-blooded European royalties but had no money. In An Affair to Remember, Grant-Kerr looked ordinary folk who had acquired good taste. That said, there were great chemistry in both couples. The second difference lied in the fact that Love Affair was B&W and not digitally remastered, which might not be a bad thing afterall. It gave an authentic feel of a classic love story retold. And the magnificent Boyer-Dunne more than made up for this technicality defect. They didn't so much as act, they just graced the screen with their presence.

It should be noted that there aren't currently ANY good prints of this movie available for purchase. It desperately needs to be cleaned up, remastered and reissued, but until that happens, expect somewhat blurry pictures and slightly crackly sound. Iy's a credit to the movie that its enjoyability isn't affected by the bad copies.

""Love Affair"" is one of those really magical love stories, with its simple story and amazing acting. Romantic, beautiful and sweet, this is definitely a must-see.",1152921600,4,2643,4.899328859060403
558065,5,6303063705,"The depth and charm of Leo McCarey's 1939 film, Love Affair, places it far above most love stories and miles ahead of his own remake in later years. Irene Dunne would certainly have taken home the Oscar in any other year as she had many fine performances which were deserving. A fine script by Delmer Daves and Donald Ogden Stewart takes us from sparkling wit to bittersweet love with ease, thanks to McCarey's fine direction and the performances of Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer.

Terry McKay (Dunne) and Michel Marnet (Boyer) are aboard the S.S. Napoli on an ocean cruise contemplating their impending marriages; she to a decent fellow who is more a friend than anything, and he to a very wealthy industrial heiress who doesn't excite him much but can afford his playboy lifestyle. They meet by chance when she reads his cablegram to a girl other than his fiance by mistake and teases him about it. They must avoid prying eyes aboard ship when a charming romance takes shape, as his engagement is in all the society papers.

Dunne is a witty hoot as the American girl from New York, Terry McKay, and Boyer gives a very charming performance as Michel Marnet, a man with talents who spends most of his time living it up rather than doing something with his life. Terry gets a glimpse of what he might be when she meets his charming elderly grandmother on a stop in Porto Santo, Madeira.

A beautiful rose covered villa with a chapel which makes Terry want to whisper is Janou's home. She and Janou make a connection when the old woman sees that she may be the good woman who could make Michel's life right. She fears a bill may be coming for all Michel's living which he can not pay. There is a beautiful scene in the chapel Michel will paint from memory when the two part.

But they promise to meet in six months on top of the Empire State building at 5:00 to see if Michel can earn a living through his painting and be worthy to ask her hand in marriage. But he waits until midnight in the pouring rain and Terry does not come. What he doesn't know is the sirens he heard below at 5:00 were for Terry, who had been struck down crossing the street and crippled, perhaps for life.

Terry doesn't want Michel to know her fate and he returns to his former life in a half-hearted attempt to drown thoughts of what might have been. Terry, who was a singer, falls into a job as music teacher for the orphanage next to the ward where she was treated and tries to make a life for herself. Michel sees her in a theatre not knowing a wheel chair outside the theatre doors is the reason she did not meet him.

When his grandmother passes on, he uses the gift she wanted Terry to have as an excuse to track her down and discover why she abandoned their chance at love. Terry keeps a shawl over her legs but a painting he had only recently decided to sell because the buyer was poor and crippled will bring things all into focus.

A love story of rare beauty, this is a neglected treasure in American cinema. Most prints of this film are decent but it would be wonderful to see it restored to the original luster it must have had when released to theatres in 1939. Dunne sings ""Spring in My Heart"" and the Oscar nominated ""Wishing"" is sung by her group of orphans. A nice score by Roy Webb enhances the mood of another RKO classic. A memorable romance with charm that is perfect for a rainy day.",1114905600,70,3383,4.377388535031847

Both actors are splendid in their roles.",1040342400,6,315,5.5625
558068,4,6303063705,"LOVE AFFAIR is one of many films whose theme is that love does not adhere to imposed schedule.  What distinguishes this movie from other and similar ones is what the actors do and say after they realize this. Terry McKay (Irene Dunne) and Michel Marnet (Charles Boyer) are each romantically involved with other people when they meet and fall in love on a sea voyage to New York.  This sort of thing happens often enough in real life but their reaction to their new emotions reveals their basic decency and depth of feeling.  They agree to meet months later on the top floor of the Empire State Building to cement their relation.  Thus far, the tone is one of light, romantic comedy.  However, LOVE AFFAIR takes an unexpected tragic detour as Terry is crippled in a car accident.  Other movies have often dealt with issues in which one lover grows ill or crippled, but in this film, one of the lovers (Terry) makes things worse by hiding her condition by running away from Michel.  For most of the second half, Terry and Michel are apart physically but connected emotionally.  Each copes with the separation as best as they can.  Michel's grief is probably the easier to cope with since he feels that he was unjustly jilted so what can he do about that except heal.  Terry's grief is more multi-faceted since she has to live with a series of complicating factors, only one of which (her being confined to a wheelchair) is beyond her control.  She must reconcile her present unhappiness with the unpleasant realization that she could have tossed away a life of bliss with a man who might not have been scared off by the prospect of a wheelchair bound wife.  Miss Dunne was a deserved nominee for Best Actress as she manages to hide her misgivings about her decision to break off the relation beneath smile and song.  Charles Boyer is convincing as a man who loses his love, does not know why, and then must face the consequences of factors totally beyond his control.  LOVE AFFAIR is not your three hanky sobber.  Rather it is an intelligent exploration of love gone astray, a condition exacerbated when one of them discovers that this love sometimes needs a healthy dose of honesty and confidence to keep it on track.",1030492800,30,2216,4.631713554987212
558069,5,6303063705,"Irene Dunne glows in this movie. She delivers the jokes and poignant lines in an effortless, natural way way Kerr never could. Dunne is just funnier and Charles Boyer is much more expressive than Grant.
Normally I'm a die hard Cary Grant fan but ""Love Affair"" is the best version of this wonderful story. It inspires both laughs and tears. Five stars isn't enough. I keep a copy of this close at hand for those rainy days...",1019779200,17,424,4.51948051948052
