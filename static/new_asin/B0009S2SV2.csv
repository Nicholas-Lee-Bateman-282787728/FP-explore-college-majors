3704710,4,B0009S2SV2,"*REVIEW OF 2018 BLU RAY RELEASE

There's not much in the way of extras on this Blu Ray which is a shame because the movie is presented the best its ever been. The picture is very nice while retaining a film grain look and sounds pretty good as well with rear surround channels getting plenty of use. It is definitely an improvement over the last Blu Ray that was released stateside. Not much else to say other than if you have yet to see Ichi the Killer, make sure it's the kind of film you are. It's super violent, insane and just flat out f'ed up. Definitely not for all tastes and not a first date film by any means. Probably not a fifth date film either.",1522540800,,658,4.181102362204724
3704711,5,B0009S2SV2,"Director Takashi Miike is a director who breaks the mold and creates movies that don't hold back. Having already made a name for himself in his home country of Japan it wouldnt be until 2001 that he was noticed by a larger audience here in the US. One could say that happened 2 years earlier with the release of his film AUDITION which stunned audiences with its depiction of torture. But it was ICHI that drew more attention and got him noticed around the world.

Let me start by saying that the modern day Yakuza films that were popular in Japan were being made before ICHI was released and Miike had his hand in a number of them. His BLACK TRIAD SOCIETY films are sought after now as well as well as DEAD OR ALIVE. But it was ICHI that cemented his name among fans of the unusual and cinema lovers worldwide.

Based on the Manga of the same name, ICHI is the story of a yakuza gang in turmoil. When sadistic mob boss Anjo is brutally killed after beating a prostitute nearly to death by Ichi, a cleanup crew is sneaks in to take care of the scene. The gore strewn room is covered in blood and viscera but the team led by Jijii handles it with ease. When they leave the room is spotless and Anjos crew has no idea what has happened.

With Anjo gone his mob believes he has been kidnapped. The hunt is on for the killer and is led by underboss Kakihara. Kakihara is an unforgettable character, a man seemingly obsessed with sadism and masochism at the same time. It is the image of Kakihara that is most associated with the film, his smile increased by 2-3 inch slits on either side of where it should stop and held together with pins.

Finding that Jijii and his crew are in town, Kakihara approached the older man and tells him if he learns of anything to contact him. Jijii passes along information to Kakihara that it might be possible rival boss Suzuki was behind it all. Capturing and torturing Suzuki it isn't until after that this lead proves to be false. To pay penance Kakihara cuts off the end of his tongue and presents it to Suzukis boss.

Realizing the lead was false, Kakihara and his men begin searching for Jijii and his crew. As they begin to follow leads, capturing each man, their standing with their boss comes into jeopardy and the Anjo crew is banished. This leaves Kakihara and his men open to trying to take over the mob they once worked for.

As all of this is transpiring Jijii continues to use Ichi to stir things up, killing various people along the way. Ichi is tormented by memories of the past when he was bullied as a child. Now he seeks to right the wrongs of his past by killing these men that Jijii points out are the same as those bullies of the past. It is Jijii who is controlling what is going on. Before the film ends just who is responsible for what as well as who will remain standing is revealed.

The movie is visually arresting with a huge color palette used by Miike. The garish clothing worn by Kakihara makes him stand out from the rest of his crew, was if the facial scarification weren't enough. The bright lights of the city explode on screen and the dark alleys offer hidden shadows. It is a city most would not associate with Japan but it puts on display the fact that they too have their locations that run rampant with crime.

The two central characters of the film are polar opposites. Kakihara in his bright clothing delights in his sadomasochistic tendencies. Ichi on the other hand is dressed in black and fears the outburst of anger that push him into a psychotic stage. Kakihara is playing a game in his attempt to increase his power, Ichi is just subdued and quiet, sitting alone until instructed to do otherwise by Jijii. Kakihara controls people while Ichi is controlled. A final confrontation between the two is only natural and does happen near the end of the film, saved for the final moments.

The film is bold in its depiction of brutality among the different gang members. If AUDITION showed that Miike was unafraid to turn an eye towards torture in his films ICHI shows he would embrace it. He embraces the violence on display and forces the viewer to look as well, depicting it as something that happens, that takes place, even if we aren't aware. While showing someone hanging from hooks located throughout their bodies, the cutting of Kakiharas tongue and the murder of Anjo are brutal for me they didn't compare to the beatings on prostitutes that left them bloodied, black eyed and with swollen faces. Those scenes felt more real and thus more gut wrenching.

But for all of that there is a certain beauty to the film. The story telling aspects make it one that you don't want to turn away from, that you want to watch until the end credits roll. On top of that as the film moves forward you begin to realize that the character of Ichi is perhaps one of the saddest characters to ever appear onscreen. I won't say why as it would be too large of a spoiler but trust me, among a vast number of characters who are either gangsters or killers it is Ichi, a killer himself, you feel for by the end of the film.

The first time I saw this movie I was only able to see if on a bootleg edition picked up at some convention. Since then it has been released over the years in this country but never like the current format that Well Go is offering now.

To begin with the film was originally released in the US at only 117 minutes long to get an R rating from the MPAA. This is the full-length, original 128 minutes cut of the film. A full digital restoration of the film which was done by Emperor Motion Pictures in 2017. The new transfer was done in 4k resolution from a 35mm inter-negative found at LImmagine Ritrovata in Bologna, Italy. Since then it has been digitally restored and colour graded in 4k resolution. What this means is that this will be the most definitive version of the film with the entire film in the most brilliant picture its ever been offered in.

Extras are sparse but that shouldnt matter. It is the film that is important. With Miike just releasing his 100th film (BLADE OF THE IMMORTAL reviewed her a few weeks ago) and with a number of his films finding their way here via Arrow Video, those who appreciate the films he has to offer will want to make certain that this one ends up in their collection. If youve purchased the film in the past, sell off that old copy and invest in this one. Its the only way to have the complete film in the best format possible. Congratulations to the folks at Well Go for insuring that this film finds a renewed life.",1522281600,,6551,4.3996696944673825
3704712,5,B0009S2SV2,"Takeshi Miike's legendary and controversial 2001 film adaptation of the manga ""Ichi the Killer"" will always be a rough looking film. It was filmed in 16 millimeter, telecined to HD video for post production, and then filmed out on 35mm inter-negative for the making of release prints.

Previous DVD and blu-rays of the film have looked terrible. A lot of people blamed that on the process that the film was made. I called shenanigans on those assertions stating that these prior releases were simply botched transfers and that someone needed to at some point do a full blown HD restoration of this classic and notorious film.

Enter Emperor Motion Pictures who in 2017 oversaw a full 4K restoration of the film from the 35mm internegative. After a brief film festival circuit run which received rave reviews, Well Go USA would get the rights to release what is intended to be the definitive blu-ray release of ""Ichi the Killer"" in early 2018.

I can say with resounding praise that they succeeded! This new remastered blu-ray is truly like seeing the film again for the first time. There have been some people grumbling as to why they didn't go back to the original 16mm film stock. That simply was not possible with how this film was made.

Presented in 1.85:1 in its uncensored director's cut form, colors are much improved. Most importantly contrast and film grain is much better resolved. Now people expecting this disc to resemble a modern film need to keep their expectations in check. While this transfer is definitive, the film itself will always be rough around the edges visually which is what was intended when it was originally made. Detail is considerably better than before and this is most noticeable in the blood and gore shots of which fans know there are many. My only small quibble is why Well Go USA chose to go with a single layer disc rather than dual layer to increase the bit rate a bit more. Now don't don't get me wrong, the bit rate gets into the mid 20's during busy sections so no compression artifacts are to be found. But with a dual layer disc, this could have been increased even more. On the audio side, it is presented in 5.1 master audio and sounds great. I should mention that Well Go USA chose to drop the English dubbed track from past releases in favor of only the original Japanese track with English subtitles which I am perfectly fine with.

Sadly no new extras are included though they did port the commentary track, still gallery and trailer from prior releases. I would like to have seen them include new extras highlighting the film's still influential legacy but the new transfer is fine by me as is.

While ""Ichi the Killer"" most certainly will not be for everyone (the various instances of brutal violence towards women throughout the film do still make me wince), as a piece of groundbreaking transgressive cinema, it is one of the best. Fans of the film can finally breathe a sigh of relief now that someone has given this film the care and attention that it rightfully deserved!",1521936000,,3031,4.68796992481203
3704713,1,B0009S2SV2,"I was really looking forward to this remastered blu ray release and I was bitterly disappointed. The quality is DVD at best. No extra features except a trailer and the commentary from the old release. This is a barebones release that absolutely looks terrible.. Grainy and the blotchy blocks. I'm surprised they are calling this a blu ray release. In the opening of the movie, they have screen explaining that this has been remastered in 4k overseen by the Director and then the movie starts and yikes! I don't know why they even bothered. The picture quality is just unbelievably bad. Seems like a complete money grab.",1521763200,,619,4.794392523364486
3704714,5,B0009S2SV2,"Not a review of the movie itself, but of the new ""Remastered"" blu-ray. This blu-ray played on my PC blu-ray player without an issue (hooray!). The quality of this transfer compared to the previous release is significantly improved -- just don't expect modern blu-ray quality. After all, it is a movie from 2001. This is probably the best we can get. The audio sounds quite good, comes in options of 5.1 or stereo, and the blu-ray includes commentary from Miike (director) and Yamamoto (manga writer/artist). I haven't listened to the commentary yet, but I really look forward to it and I'm sure any big fans of the movie will really enjoy this feature. If you like this movie and don't own it yet -- or hell, if you own an older copy and aren't happy with the quality -- definitely pick this up. This is the definitive edition of Ichi the Killer!",1521504000,,846,4.572368421052632

He has the guts to do anything that is the most violent, messed up, sickest things, that will make you squirm like a worm. As for me, I do not find it disturbing at all. I love watching movies like this and I live for this stuff, cause we all know : it's only a movie. The reason I love watching extreme stuff is because it's something new that you don't usually see in an ordinary movie and if you look at it in the positive way like I do, it's actually kind of amazing that all of these visions are brought into a film.

My favorite character in this movie, who I believe is one of the most talked-about characters in the extreme genre world till this very day, is Kakihara, played by the Incredible Tadanobu Asano, who is simply perfect and powerful in his performance. He plays a sadistic, cruel, yakuza gangster with a sick twisted slit-mouthed smile, searching for his missing boss. If you are an extreme movie lover and you have never seen this remarkable feature, get ready to be blown away by this ultra violent masterpiece from one of my favorite controversial directors of all time!!!",1517961600,,1156,4.427230046948357

Nothing in the description of ""Ichi the Killer"" led me to expect anything different.

But it is different. It's lowbrow comedy combined with incoherent and unrealistic violence, on the level of a Bugs Bunny cartoon with human actors. Although I'm not familiar with manga, my impression was that it is a serious art form, dealing with serious topics in a mature fashion. Apparently, this assessment is incorrect. Characters in this film react to what looks like horrific pain and mutilation with no more evidence of distress than the Three Stooges getting poked in the eye. Blood and organs squirt as if from fire hoses in sequences reminiscent of the Black Knight scene in ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail."" A man hangs from meat hooks with about the same level of discomfort as someone lying on an uncomfortable mattress. A man is sliced in half from skull to crotch, bloodlessly, as clean as a piece of cheese. A character with a sliced mouth like the Joker in ""Batman,"" someone's hand with the skin removed like a glove, a face sliding down a bloody wall, a guy imprisoned in a television set with his face where the screen should be - I kept waiting for someone to ski through a chain-link fence and turn into a pile of ice cubes, or have a grand piano dropped on their head. Then afterwards, with the piano smashed on the ground, all you see is a hand poking out from underneath with the fingers drumming impatiently.

The only scene where a character has anything even close to a normal human reaction is when a young boy kicks a severely injured man who has just killed his father. Otherwise, everyone comes across as sado-masochists who've just swallowed a bottle of Ativan. If you're looking for ""the goriest movie ever made,"" this isn't even it - [[ASIN:B00699G622 The Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence</a>&nbsp;is much gorier, and has more emotional significance.

Maybe fans of the original manga will get something out of this, by seeing a comic strip brought to life. For the rest of us, ""Ichi the Killer"" is a colossal waste of time, and only recommended to those who have committed to seeing every movie ever made.",1402790400,,4210,9.707379134860052

3704754,5,B0009S2SV2,"Now I am a huge fan of of asian cinema especially the works of Korean director Park Chan Wook(OLDBOY)and my favorite being Takashi Miike. No other director can cover as many genres as this man and this is his most known of film besides the psychological masterpiece Audition. Now unfortunate for my gore hound self I bought a copy of the R rated version which does cut out a fair amount of the gore but also some of the stuff in this movie I always felt I could do with out(white puddles)other then that it's still a gore-fest and not many directors can combine horror and action with an art-house style but Miike is a true film God. Thats why renowned directors such as Tarantino,Eli Roth,and Guilermo Del Toro rrave about this man. He pushes the envelope and then some just watch the unrated cut of this film,hell R rated version is no easy watch. The title character Ichi is one of the most disturbed and depraved anti-hero's ever created and Kakhuira(the show stealer and the man on the front cover)is the best bad guy ever he's an eccentric yakuza enforcer who begins a rampage of violent killings,torture,e.t.c to find out who killed his boss. He and his boss had a special relationship seing as his sadistic appetite for self inflicted pain and causing pain to others is insatiable. Very easy to follow story unlike some Miike films(IZO,GOZU)and the violence while over the top and is like a combination of Kill Bill and Hostel lots of torture and spraying is not just weird and gross(Dead or Alive)a highly over-rated Miike film it was like he was trying to capture John Woo like action with gross out shock like a guy being shot and noodles flying out of his stomach,thats just dumb and I cant take it serious. Ichi The Killer is very serious and at times disturbing but the R rated version is watchable even to those who don't fancy lots of gore. All in all it might be my favorite Miike film next to Sukiyaki(Western Django)or Imprint so check it out.keep it sick..",1384214400,,1976,4.584745762711864

3704756,4,B0009S2SV2,"Director Takashi Miike knows how to set a scene.  ""Ichi the Killer"" is nothing but scene after scene delving into explorations of violence, revenge, bullying, manipulation, rape, sadistic sex, masochistic killers, organized crime, drug addiction and the divine comedy found in all of it.  Those with weak stomachs will do best to stick with the reaction they had after reading the film's description and stay away.  Those whose constitutions are considerably stronger will find themselves mesmerized by an artistic view of all the aforementioned things in a way that seems like it should be offensive, but only if you are offended by Tom and Jerry cartoons.

Don't be mistaken.  There is plenty of cruelty here.  Taken in the greater context, however, it makes sense and is actually essential to the story.  This is not violence for exploitation's sake.  This is violence for violence's sake.  Ichi is conflicted.  Bullied, rape fantasies, manipulated ... he is the viewer.  His viewpoint is our viewpoint.  His narrative is our story.  His quick, violent acts, done because he believes some people want them, horrifies viewers as much as it does him.  Yet we, like him, want more.  And more is what we get.

The end of the journey is important here.  While the film glorifies violence, it also shows that all violence (mental and physical) has real implications.  The only question is: Can viewers be objective enough to see that, or will they be either turned off or turned on so far that they become blind to what Miike is putting forth?

Any film that can do that and do it as well as it is done here, deserves some praise.  ""Ichi the Killer"" is worthy of all that you've read about it ... and more.",1375660800,,1703,4.786941580756014

that it will ever be.

 DO NOT WATCH THE ENGLISH VOICE-OVER~!
You must watch this movie in its intended format the japanese Language with the subtitles.
i know there are some people who refuse to watch forign movies because of this
but trust me, this movie is worth it, and the English dub is so horrible i would only suggest
watching it if you want to laugh after already seeing the movie a couple times.

 Sorry had to say that, people need to be warned. back to the review.

 This movie is about an incident that compels two mofia style gangs (japanese Yakuza)
to enter into a brutal gang war. Although the set up is typical everything that follows is anything but.
The hero/anti-hero is  ICHI the killer who is not a martial artist, but more of a mentally limited,
timid man who gets provoked into murderous fits(tantrums) of rage. These acts of violence are usually long
coming when the man is repeatedly harassed and abused by those around him. These murders
that occur through-out the film are so extreme and brutal it leads the gangs to further inquiery as to
who ICHI is and why is he such a (seemingly) merciless killer with no moral conviction or inhibition.

 The movie sets the benchmark in that all of the characters are not 2-dimensional, but each has
their own dark-side and are extremely perverted and outright messed up people you'd never hope
to know. this movie would be a psychology major's dream movie.

 Also the level of depraved violence is so RAW, you think that when the movie suggests that its
going to "" go there "" that nah its not gonna go there... but IT DOES and its REALLY IN YOUR FACE
not backing off... its absolutely impossible to watch the 1st time with out a hand in front of your face.

 and the Final benchmark is what i call the ""wth"" factor... watch the movie many times and you will
continue to unravel pieces of the story... its not that its hard to follow, its just a lot of messed up
stuff that happens.

 this release of ICHI is loaded with extras, despite it claiming to be uncut/unedited,
  the offical japanese version could not be released here,
and you would need to import it to get those missing scenes...",1358208000,,2237,4.48395061728395

Getting this on Blu-ray was a no-brainer, as one of the most-watched movies we owned. Sharing this with friends is always a delight. Many have now become Miike and Tadanobu fans, and that's how I like it.",1357689600,,563,5.546511627906977

3704767,5,B0009S2SV2,"Ichi the Killer is not the sort of movie I expected it to be. It was extremely bloody and graphic. I was extremely, well, extreme. But as far as the story goes I was surprised how deep it was and how important the psychological aspects became. At the core of this film it is a study of sadism and masochism to the farthest levels of the scale. Ichi the sadist and Kakihara the masochist are the two main characters of the film. Whether or not you label them as the pro or antagonists is up to you, as I can't personal begin to decide if they qualify as these story telling archtypes. There are levels of intensity in Ichi the Killer which go unmatched by almost any other films. The most basic and prevolent level is the graphic and brutal violence which occurs non stop throughout the film. It is described on the box using the term ""arterial gush"" and when they use gush, they mean it. Frankly its more like arterial geyser with blood flowing throughout the film on a biblical plague level. Then you have the even more shocking intellectual and emotional intensity. This is where the film gets truly distrubing. Ichi the Killer plans you in the minds of those you are deeply emotionally disturbed. Being plummeted into a world that few can truly stomach Ichi the Killer makes you take in all the ideas of pain and its effects; both pleasurable and unendurable. In the end this is a film which will sit with you for a very long time and make you think for days after you watch it. If you think you can handle the insanity of Ichi the Killer then you definately should view it, as it is a film which shows how great films can really be.",1335225600,,1636,4.367213114754098

The latter half of the movie had lots of neat shots and images, and the outfits of the main characters was a large ""cool factor"". But it was extremely gory and graphic. Lots of torture, blood, internal organs, and deformed bodies. That turned me off. I'm not into gore.

Another problem, and what kept me from enjoying it in the beginning, was the plot was difficult to follow at first. It jumped to different scenes and characters without much explanation why, so I was lost in the plot many times. Also, I have to admit I had some trouble telling some of the Japanese actors apart. It took half the movie to pick up on features that helped me tell them apart. I don't feel too bad, since my Asian best friend also had trouble.

The second one has been discussed here before but I will reiterate.  Both discs are crammed into the pockets in the cheap vinyl blood pack.  So removing them is tedious and it's nearly impossible to remove them without marring them.  So with that being said, I do recommend this amazing film to fans of foreign cinema but I would go with the single disc, unrated version.

  It is definately an interesting movie but for me there are certain things that could be left out to make it great.
  It seems that Takashi Miike has some great ideas, storytelling and symbolic moments in his movies but always sees the need to add sex related stuff in his movies.

  Anyway this movie is about a gang leader who is on the look for a killer who seems to be responsible for the dissappearance of his boss.

  When watching this movie you will no doubt like Kakihara as he is definately an interesting character as where you will dislike Ichi because he is kinda sick in the mind and does some gross things.(plus hes a crybaby.)

I've come to the conclusion that experiencing Miike, Roth, Rob Zombie and a few others' idea of a movie production is rather like watching an untreated psychotic playing with his own vomitus - tragic and disgusting at the same time. Oh, and about as artistic as shooting the family cat with a nail gun. The thematic backbone of Ichi the Killer is: two characters building to a fateful final conflict between each other!!!!  I know you're thinking that this is one totally original plot, and of course you're right.  But wait! There's more!  Aiding and abetting the hopelessly banal story is the sartorial wherewithal of the antagonists - one has stolen a rubber suit from that Vin Diesel space movie, and the other one looks like Japan's answer to Buck Owens.  Sprinkled in is more psychosexual stupidity than you could shake an organ at, and more garden variety stupidity than you could shake a decent director at.  Examples? A clone of Bolo Yeung gives a he-man posing routine for no reason at all. Also, during a hideous torture scene the victim makes sounds like that of someone suffering a  moderate bout of constipation, and a woman whose leg is severed at mid-shinbone goes all hip-hop on us, if you get my meaning.

3704781,5,B0009S2SV2,"After reading most of the reviews posted here on Amazon, I just had to post my own.

I cannot believe how many people just don't ""get"" what this movie is about!  This movie is not about the Yakuza in Japanese society, an exercise in pointless violence to sell tickets or dvds, or any other such nonsense.  The director just uses these as backdrops for his own purposes.  Takashi Miike is playing and having a hell of a lot of fun.  This movie invites the viewer to go along for the ride.  It's totally over the top and that's where it belongs.  Is the latest thrill-ride roller coaster from theme-park hell a ""statement""?  Of course not.  It's just a thrill-ride.  Every character is a joke and every scene in the movie is just one hilarious joke after another.  Granted, it's very black humor but that doesn't make it any less hilarious.  Why can't people just accept that and laugh along with him?

If you want to see (good) bleak Yakuza movies with social themes, check out any of the titles in his earlier Black Society Trilogy (aka Black Triad Trilogy):  Shinjuku Triad Society, Rainy Dog, and Ley Lines.  These are gripping statements of alienation, corruption and emotional disintegration in Japanese society.

Too many people want to limit this director.  It must really annoy him that his audience wants the same kind of movie every time he makes one.  He's not interested in making the film Audition (or fill in the blank with another title) another fifty times. I for one don't want him to either.

Folks, it's just a wonderful joke. Laugh!",1269907200,,1551,4.656826568265683
3704782,4,B0009S2SV2,"The Yakuza, the Japanese crime syndicate, control crime on virtually every level of Japanese society. They bully the press and filmmakers to portray them as society's ""noble outlaws, when in reality they'll torture and/ or kill anyone who gets in their way. Japanese filmmaker Juzo Itami had a price on his head after he portrayed the Yakuza as money grubbing, ill mannered miscreants in the movie Minbo no oona. He was attacked by five members of the Yakuza in a parking lot outside his house and sustained serious injuries. (He allegedly committed suicide years later by jumping off a tall building.) With Koroshiya 1 (Ichi the Killer) Takashi Miike takes on the Yakuza in his own unique way.

After the kidnapping, and possible brutal murder, of syndicate boss Anjo and the theft of 300 million yen Kakihara, Anjo's protege and chief of his syndicate, seeks to find the party responsible. A masochist who will stop at nothing to prove a point, not even stopping short of cutting off part of his own tongue, Kakihara gets word that Suzuki, another crime boss, was involved due to Kakihara cutting him out of Anjo's porn video business. Anjo's syndicate is kicked out of the Yakuza, though, after Kakihara brutally tortures and disfigures Suzuki without proper proof that Suzuki was behind Anjo's disappearance. With Kakihara as their new leader, the clan finds out from a former member that Anjo is dead, murdered by a mysterious man known as Ichi who brutally hacks his victims to pieces. Missing the sadist to his masochist, Kakihara seeks Ichi out, the one person who may be able to give him the pain that he needs.

Based on the manga of the same name by Hideo Yamamoto, Ichi the Killer is possibly one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen, and I mean that in a good way. Miike shoots this very brutal movie with unmatched style using jump cuts, slick camera moves, and interesting angles to tell a story that otherwise would have just been near torture porn. The characters are also colorful, if also severely disturbing, especially Kakihara who sports a harlequin smile and purple jacket similar to Batman's Joker, but is scarier and far more unpredictable.

Miike decides not to delve into the rights or wrongs of the Yakuza, and probably for the best after hearing the story of Juzo Itami, but instead takes a look at the brutality of the sadist/ masochist's relationship. But within this study of sadomasochism we still see the brutality of the Yakuza, even if its just amongst themselves and the different clans.

The one problem I have with this is that at times the gore and ""action"" is a tad bit over the top. Of course, this could also be because the film was adapted from a manga, meaning that it's closer to the film form of anime than a live action feature. At times the over the top action, takes you out of the film, and causes the film to loose some sense of reality. These times pass by shortly after as you see the aftermath of what just happened which once again drops you back you into the devastating reality of the flick.

All in all a great film, if gory and disturbing. If you have a weak stomach, or are adverse to gore I highly recommend that you stay away, and definitely don't allow the kids to watch. But this is a movie that will highly appeal to gore hounds, fans of torture porn, Asian film enthusiasts, and most people who enjoy a good organized crime movie. If you fall into those categories I highly recommend this flick.

I thought that Ichi would have a similar effect, but I found in Ichi a profoundly different approach to torture and the visual experience of it.

Although many reviewers have labeled Ichi as gorey and over the top, it fails to enable the viewer to fully partake in its numerous but brief torture scenes. The film never or almost never shows the entirety of a character's torture act and frequently cuts before the actual death of the character. Rather than being a no limits gorefest like a lot of contemporary American horror films (I'm talking about you Saw series. the poorest victim of your torture is the dead horse you're beating), Ichi struggles to, well, get off. None of the characters derive satisfaction from the practice of their sado-masochistic desires. Yet oftentimes when this is the case in a film, at least the viewer can indulge in the visual smorgasbord of blood and guts without guilt or inner conflict. And though there are moments when we finally get to see what we've been waiting for, they are too fleeting or disjunctive to make a lasting impact. Ichi's characters and viewers alike are deprived - and god, don't you have to be to pick up this movie and actually want to watch it?

Ichi the Killer begs many questions about the portrayal of sado-masochistic themes on screen. Is death the achievement of climax or torture's disappointing finale? For the viewer who expects agony, is the concealment of it even more agonizing? Is Ichi a better film because of its total embodiment of psychological torture, or worse? You decide, I'm still unsure.",1256256000,,1810,4.761146496815287
3704786,5,B0009S2SV2,"The film Ichi the Killer intends to be just about Ichi , and about the Yakuza , and about Kakihara , a sadistic serial killer who enjoys torturing and being tortured to liberate himself from his inner pain which he cannot get rid of somehow.
The director's intention is to bring an innocent and a guilty presentation of the abuse of construction corporations that use futurism as propaganda in their insatiable efforts to remove all things green. Ichi and Kakihara think that their unhappiness is focused on themselves and deny the fact that when they were children there was such a thing as a different Asia in their childhood. With this film , Japan  comes to the realization of randomly sucessful anti - NWO movies for the first time that are likely to become enormously sucessful as cult films.
Ichi the Killer becomes more sucessful than any Asian movie about killers and their initiation into the reason for why each one of them kills and why he kills the way he does and why he prefers this victim beyound that victim. Ichi picks up his subjects at the command of a telephone voice which turns to be his older brother. But he is finally faced with making a choise on whether he should keep or take his older brother's life. Kakihara realizes that Ichi is being initiated into becoming a killing machine which is so emotional , compassive and full of empathy that it shatters his mind and destroys the branch of Yakuza that opposed his birth town.
Ichi realizes that the China and Japan of his childhood had been ravaged and that there is still time but that the people are so ignorant of it that they have been hypnotized en masse to follow the party line - such as that of the Yakuza and other Japanese mafia organizations. The still - Japanese and other Asian friends of his began to wake up by the passing of each sucessful kill and Kakihara tries hopelessly to cure Ichi from his ineviteable , final collapse.
As he collapses the viewer realizes that they have not done anything to aid Japan in recovering it's lost natural reservoirs and that China is being inaccurately portrayed as a vast metropolis occupied by billions of brain - dead zombies who can barely speak a few nouns by the passing of each sentence.
Ichi realizes that Kakihara has become a demon and can heal incredibly fast from any attack , frontal and behind that's done against him , including any attempt to put your fist into Kakihara's demonic face.
The demon Kakihara learns too late alongside Ichi that the ravaging of Japan has cut serious wounds inside the Japanese soul. Kakihara must also make a choise - to continue to pursue Ichi , or forget about it , leave the Yakuza and spend the rest of his life in his human body.
Kakihara knows how to heal his body but cannot control his appetite for torture , and Ichi's contempt for Kakihira is really his contempt for the construction companies and how they had raped Japan's nature under lobbyist control.
I have no intention to be hostile against Japan or China by this criticism but the NWO concept .
Ichi the Killer attempted to be a horror , slasher comedy but ended up becoming such a serious criticism of antihuman construction plans in Japan's cities and urban neighbourhoods that the humour got forgotten and sort of blended into the movie almost undetected by the viewer.
There is no word to the NWO to my knowledge in Chinese or Japanese or other Asian language - you just feel it and know that it's being removed in a healing manner by the film's director who intends to keep his movie as apolitical as he possibly can but fails honorably rather than miserably to keep 'safe'distance from overtly harsh criticism of Asian construction politics.
By the climax of this movie , an entire period in art history known as futurism comes to an end , and all the insane construction ideas alongside it such as river dams fused with needless energy power plants , etc.
This film sends in other words such a powerful message of healing and love and the joy & importance of being alive to the world that the whole of Asia wakes up to the serious realization that the age of futurism has ended , and that the current situation with construction requires a return to the uniqueness and spontaneity that once characterized early Asia , where technology is still a major important part of Asia's civilizations but in a Japan or China or Korea or some other Asian country where nature is honoured instead of abused , and where the legacy of the now world famous Ichi the Killer DVD looms around the horizion almost a century from now and beyound.

Even if they removed every drop of blood from this movie you would still be left with an interesting study of fully developed characters that you could study for days...except for Ichi..who luckily isn't in most of the flick.

3704796,5,B0009S2SV2,"""Ichi The Killer"" is a movie that involves gang member Kakihara and his target Ichi, who is, yes, a killer, but also enjoys weekend sitting under a blanket in his bedroom playing his PlayStation. Go figure!
Now, I will say that ""Ichi The Killer"" is one of the GORIEST movies that has come across my TV screen. I won't give away any of the details, but if you want them, personalize a request in the comment section below and I'll give you the what's-what, and believe me, there's a lotta WHAT in this movie! HOWEVER...
""Ichi The Killer"" is NOT a ""horror"" movie. It's a very ironic movie with odd humor, unexpected laughs, and even some dark drama as only the Japanese can do. A personal favorite comedic moment is when Kakihara's squad is walking down the street, but Kakihara stuck a board of wood to one dude's shoe, so it sticks out like a sore thumb! Ironic, indeed!
So this movie is a cross between a gang-exploitation, drama, comedy and nonstop bloody, gory, violent action!
I love that the movie doesn't have to take itself seriously to be a great movie. ""Ichi The Killer"" as bloody and violent as it is, can be a very fun movie and an interesting twist on your Friday night featurette.
Basically, imagine the deranged, messed-up humor of the opening, train station scene in ""Suicide Circle"", set it to a gang members movie and there you go! Japanese gangsploitation done right! Enjoy, and don't be surprised if you find yourself laughing at least once! Thanks for the time, and peace.",1216944000,,1492,4.612781954887218

3704800,5,B0009S2SV2,"Takashi Miike has single handedly revitalized my interest in film. From start to finish this movie will keep your eyes glued to the screen.

there are multiple Yakuza factions sharing territoy throughout the city. when the leader of the Anjo gang(along with all their money) disappears things are bound to get crazy, and believe me, they do.

most of the characters are far from believable, the line between pleasure and pain is severely blurred for many characters. everything and everyone about this universe is just so extreme and depraved you cant help but watch, dying to see what happens next.

Ichi isn't fully revealed until about 40 minutes into the movie. the first half is spent watching Kakihara(cover art) trying to discover the cause of his bosses disappearance. not that its any less entertaining. i actually prefer the first half of the movie over the second.

Kakihara is one interesting character. maybe the most extreme sado masochist ever put on film. he is ruthless, and seemingly crazy, but he has greater understanding of himself and what he does than anyone else in the movie.

Ichi is simply insane. he is very quiet and shy normally, but when he gets angy enough, he cant resist the urge to kill. he quickly becomes an unstoppable killing machine when he dawns his costume with the number 1 on his back. (ichi is japanese for 1)

This movie is filled with things that will probably offend most movie-goers. Torture, rape, and self-mutilation just to name a few. not to mention gallons and gallons of blood and severed limbs/organs.

from the very interesting characters all around(esp. Kakihara, he's just too cool) to the interesting cinematography with enough effects to satisfy any gorehound this movie simply must be seen (5/5)",1208476800,,1757,4.95578231292517

I'm a huge Miike Takashi fan ever since I saw ""Audition"" in the theater and I have seen a lot of his other films including the ""Dead or Alive"" trilogy, ""Fudoh"", ""Gozu"", ""Visitor Q"", but ""Ichi the Killer"" is my favorite. The violence in ""Ichi"" might be too over-the-top for most to handle, but it is so over-the-top that it is comedic to watch. Clearly,  Kakihara, is the star of this film with his blonde hair, bright shiny suits and severed mouth that he holds together with metal clips. I've yet to see a character in film as sadistic as he was. I like the scene where he smokes a cigarette and you can see the smoke exhale through the severed sides of his mouth. This is the best U.S. version DVD set of Ichi to get with oodles of bonus features to browse. The double disc set includes interviews with the Japanese cast and American directors/actors in the horror film industry reactions to the film as well as commentary tracks with Takashi (with commentary subtitles). There are also many trailers to other Miike Takashi films. ""Hostel"" director, Eli Roth, is prominently present in the featurettes and he even shows clips about how he wanted to look like Kakihara, complete with the scars and severed mouth make-up. The behind-the-scenes features are very interesting because the film-makers reveal how some of the films' special effects are executed including the scene of Kakihara's cutting of his own tongue and the woman's nipple, cutting scene (ouch!).

Now for the blood packaging that many reviewers have complained about. I tend to agree with the majority. Great packaging idea, but poor execution. If you manage to sucessfully extract the DVD's from that sticky, blood bag, don't put them back in the bag. Instead, get a ultra-slim, double disc holder for the two discs and slide it behind the blood bag in the original clear box. It's a little tight mainly because of the flexible blood bag, but I managed to get it all to fit snugly while maintaining the original look of the original packaging. Everytime that you want to watch the movie again, just slide the slim disc holder out. I used a black color, slim-double disc holder, but I think a clear or white color holder would work better so the transparent writing from the original packaging would be more legible. Just a suggestion!",1205366400,,2500,5.063106796116505

3704805,3,B0009S2SV2,"Let me preface this to say that I DID NOT cut the blood pouch.  Just to clear the air.

When I recieved my set, the side of the flimsy plastic box had shattered (not broken, SHATTERED) and the seal on the bottem had already been broken.  When I pulled the blood pouch out, the back had leaked slightly and there were sticky little drips and streaks of ""blood"" all over the second disk, which caused it to get a bit scratched up in transit.  In the end, I sent it back for an exchange, hoping it was a one-time only problem.

The packaging looks fantastic, the problem just lies with the fact that it's really not practical at all.  The disks get semi-suctioned to the plastic pouch which takes someone with Kakihara-like precision to get them out without scraping them at all.

If you're a die-hard Ichi or Miike fan, then this is still a great package-loads of bonus features.  If you're a casual viewer, then I'd suggest just getting the regular-old unrated (the R rated version really does cut out too much) edition instead, simply because when your set arrives it may be just as much of a mess as Ichi's victims.",1197590400,,1116,4.463054187192118
3704806,5,B0009S2SV2,"Well...  I've finally seen my first Miike film.  After accidentally stumbling upon ""Ichi The Killer,"" I decided to look more into it.  I was intrigued by the charismatic director, and even more so by the movie's content.  After drumming up enough enthusiasm, I went all out and bought the ""Blood Pack.""  I must say, I was NOT disappointed in the least.

As far as Miike himself, many others have said far more eloquent things about him than I could ever hope to.  Love him or hate him, I can guarantee there is at least one film in his vast catalog that will appeal to each and every movie buff.  There are action films (Dead or Alive), films devoted to black humor (Visitor Q), creepy/horror films (Audition), a musical, and even a family movie (Zebraman).  The man is a true innovator and I am certainly going to investigate his vast works more thoroughly.

""Ichi The Killer"" is far and away one of the coolest movies I have ever seen.  It is drawn from a manga, so many aspects of this movie are over the top.  This does not make it seem silly or take away from the action in the least though.  I would point out that the ""graphic"" violence that is in this film is really nothing to get excited about.  There are only two scenes that are done with purposeful realism, and I will admit them a little difficult to view.  But the blood-spraying, eviscerating carnage brought on by Ichi is about as believable as a cartoon.  It is humanly impossible to bring the type of carnage that is wrought on-screen, and although I can only speak for myself, this made the violence a non-issue.  If you can only keep an open mind and tell yourself that what you are seeing is not physically possible, then you should have no qualms about seeing this movie.  (I even got my girlfriend to watch it with no problem, and Lord Of The Rings was the most violent movie she'd ever seen beforehand).

The plot is a bit convoluted, but the story is very simple.  Miike made this film thinking that his viewers were capable of thinking for themselves and could follow along.  I personally had no problems keeping up, but the story does take a while to explain everything.  There is also little to no character development.  While this could potentially be a problem, thinking about the movie as a single episode in the life of the Anjo Gang, a chapter in a book if you will, explains it.  True, we don't know why the characters act the way they do, but the lack of background is really not missed.  At best, it would have added some psychological reasons for the demented behavior witnessed here, but in order to properly explore it for just one character would have taken FOREVER.  In the end, it would have simply lengthened the movie's runtime and muddied the already twisted plot.

Check out IMDB.com for a plot synopsis if you wish, I will not give one here.

THE BAD:  *Blood pack is potentially off-putting.  It took me a while to get my disks out when I first got it.  Once they're out though it's a piece of cake to put them back.  *There is a lot of violence in this film, don't take your kids to see it.  *Some subject matter may not sit well with some viewers, due to its confrontational nature.

THE GOOD:  *Extremely unique film, from the characters, to the way it was shot, to the thought-provoking subject matter (namely the exploration of Sadism and Masochism and how they manifest themselves in otherwise ""normal"" people).  *Acting is amazing.  I challenge you to watch this and not like Kakihara (whose face is on the front.  That's not Ichi).  *The Blood Pack is totally sweet.  I've never seen a movie packaged like this, and it elicited extreme admiration from everyone who saw it.  *The bonus DVD is very cool as well.  The interviews are interesting, the actors very candid, and the other material fits right in.  *There is a lot of violence in this film, get your kids a baby-sitter and go see it.  *The over-the-top action and style of film-making is perfect.  It takes the edge off of what could be very uncomfortable material.  *There are patented black humor moments in this film.  I laughed out loud more than once.

3704809,4,B0009S2SV2,"What can you say about Ichi the Killer? It's actually fits more into the genre of a comedy than anything else. Don't let all the hype about the gore and the blood-letting scare you, since it's more in the league of ""Kill Bill,"" or some of the earlier Peter Jackson horror flicks; in another word, it's over exaggerated violence, which makes it look very artificial. In fact, the entire movie has a bit of a cartoonish feel to it; well, it was based on a manga after all.

The basic premise is that there's this guy name Ichi, who was tramatized by an event he witnessed when he was in high school. So, he is left with all this guilt, and now he is trying to make up for his past sins by playing this superhero, who ""protects"" the innocent. There is only one problem to this... Ichi is actually a psycho. Due to Ichi's psychological handicap, a man by the name of JiJii was able to manipulate him to his will, thus the blood-bath begins.

There are plenty of scenes that can be described as disturbing, but usually the more gruesome scenes are done off screen; but as I mentioned previously, even when you see them, they are exaggerated to the point where you thought you might be watching an episode of Itchy and Scratchy. With this in mind, along with quite a large amount of scenes that can be considered to be funny, this is indeed a bona fide comedy (no sarcasm implied)!",1183939200,,1375,4.3882352941176475

A mob boss named Anjo disappears along with 3 million yen, and his devoted lackey Masa Kakihara, a scar-faced blond-haired yakuza with piercings sporting a flashy purple trenchcoat, with two slits on either side of his cheek, takes it upon himself to find out who kidnapped him.

Kakihara is quite the sadist, but just as equally a masochist, as he even cuts off his own tongue to apologize to a syndicate boss.  Given a tip by Jijii, one of a group of Chinese immigrants eking out livings doing dirty jobs in Shinjuku, he kidnaps Suzuki, a yakuza boss, strips him naked, hangs him from the ceiling with hooks, and pours boiling hot oil over the guy's back!  Yakuza tempura, hmmm....He also has his trademark long pins, which he uses to deadly affect, resulting in human pincushions.

The mastermind is Jijii.  His killer is Ichi (Japanese for one), a mentally fragile guy who dresses up in a black rubber suit with a day-glo ""1"" on the back.  His goal is to wipe out the yakuza in Shinjuku.  And he persuades the easily swayed Ichi that they are like the people who bullied him in high school, and that it's his role to rid the world of bullies.  ""They beat upon the weak and pretend to own the world.  Vengeance is yours.  If you don't kill the bad guys, who will?""  However, Jijii doesn't hesitate to use Ichi to get rid of his helpers, who are just tools for his crusade against the yakuza.

Ichi is so extreme in his killings that the people who witness what he has done see a mass of blood, entrails, splattered walls and ceilings, and at one point a human face that has been sliced off.  ""As gross as ever,"" says one of his cleaners, who has slipped on the scarlet mess on the floor.  In fact in one scene, Ichi kicks down a door, jumps inside a room filled with yakuza.  We then hear screams, then yakuza blood and guts flying out the door.  A repeated motif is his slicing the carotid artery, and then fwoooshhhh, out comes, as Alex from A Clockwork Orange would say, the red red kroovy.

This movie is very very sadistic, meaning those with a weak stomach watching this during dinner will find themselves emptying breakfast stuff!  Although given the comic-book like depictions of mutilation, it will also garner some laughs for the really twisted--the drug-addicted Kano in the TV set for example.  But the scene of a pimp savagely beating one of his prostitutes and then violating her ranks high on the cruelty list.  Don't worry-he gets his from Ichi and how!  And a prostitute is not only beaten but has her nipples sliced off by Kakihara!  Ouch!

After being expelled from the syndicate, Kakihara continues the search for Anjo.  With him are tough guy Takayama and a disgraced ex-cop Kaneko, who looks a bit like Barack Obama.  Kaneko's probably one of the more decent characters, he's just had rotten luck.  In fact, he is one of the few genuinely nice to Ichi, as he's reminded how Anjo took him in after he was expelled from the police force for losing his gun, something that even Jijii recognizes.  Then there's Karen, a Chinese call-girl who speaks heavily accented Japanese and English.  Her anecdote of her wishing someone's dog dead is funny.  Note:  in that story, she mentions a nawatobi rope which is merely Japanese for a jumprope.

This is kind of a departure from Asano Tadanobu's usual roles.  This actor, the Johnny Depp of Japan, normally has a soft-spoken undertone, but the blond hair, scarred face, wicked smile, and slits that cause his mouth to open extra wide, make this one of his more memorable roles.

With a soundtrack veers from weird gibberish techno to a slow synth score, and a kind of retro-70's style cinematography, liking Ichi the Killer depends upon your stomach, and an open mind to extreme violence.

""Listen, when you're hurting someone, don't think of the pain that he feels.  Only concentrate on the pleasure of causing him pain.  That's the only way to show compassion to your partner.""---Kakihara to Karen.",1181779200,,4156,4.634746922024624

3704815,5,B0009S2SV2,"This movie is the true definition of a car wreck. From the opening credits to the ambiguous ending, you cannot turn away from the shock and horror director Takashi Miike serves up.

Sadism is the true star of this flick as we travel a road filled with unrepentant pain and suffering. Unless you have seen the movie, then you have no idea how confrontational a film can be to your very senses. Rape, torture, murder, gore and general brutality are relentless traits of this movie. Sometimes cartoonish (its Manga roots showing), sometimes jet black in its humor, the savage pace of Ichi never slows even with a 2+ hour run time.

This is not a film for the squeamish. It makes no apologies for what it is and dares you to eject it from your DVD player. But, you simply can't. This movie can only be described as beautiful revulsion.

Just a quick comment about the packaging (which is the only downside to this release). The ""Blood Pack Edition"" contains 2 discs of excellent material including a commentary with Takashi Miike and Ichi's Manga artist/writer Hideo Yamamoto and an intensive ""making of"" documentary. However, the plastic blood bag housing the discs is a sadistic joke. The suction cup like plastic sleeve makes it incredibly difficult to actually get the damn discs out of the bag to watch them! Great gimmick, poor execution.

The film's plot is secondary so I won't dwell on it here, but if you have never seen Miike's films, get ready for a ride through the imagination of a complete mad man. The best part about the film is that Miike and his team are actually outstanding technically, and his sense of humor is both original and in my opinion hilarious.

Ichi the Killer is as glossed over and stylized as it is sadistic and violent, and believe me when I say that this film is violent. It's sexually violent content is out of whack as well and alone might earn Ichi an NC-17 stamp but it's violence is so fantastic it almost seems cartoon-like.

3704818,4,B0009S2SV2,"**** warning; spoilers ****

Surely the blackest comedy of all time, Ichi the Killer is a hugely entertaining adaptation of ultra-violent manga Koroshiya ichi (killer no. 1). The main plot is a simple one - the Anjo gang's boss disappears and all attempts by the hideously disfigured and unremittingly brutal Kakahari to find the leader he holds in such esteem leaves a trail of screaming agony, dismembered limbs and entrails! A seemingly meek little man - Jiiji drops hints as to who kidnapped Anjo, but this leads Kakihara to skewer and then deep-fat fry the wrong man. In an act of perverted remorse, Kakihara cuts half of his tongue off, the solemnity of this act of contrition interrupted by his mobile phone going off. He then has a garbled phone conversation whilst spitting mouthfuls of blood! This typifies the movie; moments of the most gross and explicit horror are tempered by moments of laugh-out-loud black humour. Gang members are despatched in great number and in inventively gory manner, as revelation follows revelation about the bizarre nature of the truly psychotic Ichi. Not having read the manga, I'm not convinced I fully appreciated all nuances of the sub-plot about the implanted memories of bullying and rape that allowed Jiiji to manipulate Ichi, but this didn't really detract from my enjoyment. I'll give it a second viewing in a month or so and see if it all clicks into place.

Much of the violence is ultra-realistic (the commentary option lets you in on some of the CGI and body-prosthetics secrets), whereas some scenes - bodies cleaved neatly in two and victims hopping around having had a leg severed, is very surreal with more than a hint of Monty Python about it!

With the inevitability of the Titanic meeting the iceberg, Kakihara finally has his long anticipated showdown with Ichi - and very strange it is too! Sure I spotted a glaring continuity error at the end but, with a movie as delirious as this, who knows if it was intended or not? See what you think...

Despite criticism by some reviewers of the censor having wielded his knife to a significant degree, the commentary by Alien Sun suggests that this 2-hour version already contains the more extreme scenes that had been cut in previous releases (the extended torture of boss Suzuki and the infamous tongue-cutting scene). I certainly had no problem following the main plot and found that the two hours really flew past, with me wincing and laughing in equal measure. Whilst not easy to categorise a movie such as this, it should appeal to those of you who enjoyed Sin City, the Evil Dead series or Peter Jackson's Braindead. Keep it well away from your maiden aunt though!",1170633600,,2676,4.836244541484716
3704819,1,B0009S2SV2,"I am a big fan of Miike's work. ""Happiness of the Katakuris"" is an irresistible, charming work of art. Similarly, ""Audition"" is a chilling cautionary-tale. But ""Ichi the Killer"" is not as engaging as Miike's other films . . . many people will try to convince you otherwise though:)

Foremost, it must be noted that much of the gore is laughable (intentionally) . . . the face sliding down the wall, the tongue being severed, the pimp being ""split"" . . . funny stuff, I admit!! Moreover, it does not appear that Miike was overly concerned about these moments appearing ""realistic"" (most of his films have a ""dreamlike"" quality). Granted, the suspension scene and subsequent scalding solicited a fairly visceral response . . . which was pretty impressive! One other aspect of the film is ALL TOO REAL . . . check IMDB for a horrific bit of trivia on the opening sequence!! (I cannot mention it here!!)

I noticed that some people are complaining about the over-dubbing. Leave it to Americans to select the over-dubbing option!! When you select over-dubbing, you obscure artist-intent . . . you destroy the tone of the film . . . if you are watching a film in a language with which you are unfamiliar, it is your obligation to READ the subtitles. So, stop embarrassing the rest of us and click that ""subtitle"" button.

The plot is pretty convoluted (which is not necessarily a failing point), so it may require more than one viewing . . . or, at the very least, pay close attention during the initial screening. SPOILER: Nonetheless, the plot is a bit of a Palahniuk rehash. So, the ending should not surprise the viewer (even though it was intended to).

This is a tough call. While many claim this piece is ""one of the most violent films in existence,"" they fail to acknowledge that Miike's work is amusing (again, intentionally!!) So, it is not that this is a TENSE film that has you on ""the edge of your seat.""  Personally, I thought it was a little tedious (I actually fast-forwarded through segments).

I gave this film one star . . . simply because I feel it would be dishonest to inflate the rating. It is not a ""good"" film by any set of standards (even unconventional ones!!) STILL, if you love Miike's other films, watch this one . . . just so you can see this man's tremendous RANGE!! And so you can engage in this debate!!",1170028800,,2331,4.564593301435407

3704822,2,B0009S2SV2,"I agree with one of the spotlight reviewers that violence is a genre and an art form in many Japanese films; but that is not an exclusively Japanese cinematic domain. I have watched this film three times now, and probably will never watch it again. The film has been described at length by many viewers, and both of the spotlight reviewers give very good descriptions of the film. [In fact they are both very good reviewers: especially Zack Davisson, of Osaka, Japan, whose opinions I value highly]. However, for me, a film has to capture my interest and hold it. Unfortunately, this film did not endear me to it, or hold my interest. I really did not think it was that good a film. And I DO understand Japanese cinema: I grew up with Japanese films; and they are amongst my favorite, if not entirely favorite films period!

There are so many truly fantastic Japanese films out there, that to give this film 4 or 5 stars would do those other great cinematic masterpieces an injustice. I do not rate horror, action, sci-fi, drama or any other genres the same when reviewing. For example, I would not compare a 5 star film such as ""Ikiru"" or ""Harakiri"" the same as I would a 5 star film in the horror genre such as ""Sleepy Hollow,"" [which is a 5 star film to me]. ""Ikiru"" and ""Harakiri are in a league of their own. Yet, I also like ""Sleepy Hollow."" Each genre is good in its own domain. As for ""Ichi the Killer,"" many people that I know only know Japanese films through Takashi Miike. Mainly due to his film ""Audition."" Therefore, I would recommend that viewers seek out others whose films are very good, and that you may be interested in. And just so you know, I think Miike is one of the greatest directors out there. However, many of his films are hit and miss. But there are other great Japanese directors out there too.

One in particular would be Takeshi Kitano, in terms of contemporary Japanese directors, or Kiyoshi Kurosawa to name just two great modern directors. Their films are accessible, and truly fabulous. Also, you might want to check out another Takashi Miike film, ""The Bird People In China,"" which is a delightfully wonderful film. Miike really captured me as a fan with that particular film. And for those of you who are not really sure which Japanese films may or may not be good, you might want to check out MidnightEye.com, which gives several Japanese film highlights. This might help. My main reason for writing a review of this film is because many people today have only seen a small number of films from Japan, and think that this [violent themed films] is all the Japanese mass-market to America. And this is unfortunate, because there are many great delightful gems in Japanese cinema. However, this is not one of them.

Moreover, this film seemed to me to be an attempt at being shocking, and far from it, it was more an exercise in banality. Although not to the degree I have seen in many American films, the film still left me with something less than desired. That is not to say that other reviewers do not have a valid opinion, or maybe saw something in the film itself that they themselves like. If these are the type of films you like, then you will find that there are many others like this on the market today. However, if you are seeking truly great Japanese films, I would advise you to look around, you might just find yourself amazed at what awaits you in those video stores.",1168300800,,3419,4.520193861066236

I have never been one for films which just show gore (like recent ""homages"" to Japanese horror like Hostel).  I've always preferred my films to have some intelligence factor.  Miike's films do just this.  This is one of his best films.  Miike is very good with actors, and this film has some excellent performances.  There is a sadness and wearyness that permeates this film, along with other Miike films.  The film's pacing is a bit leisurely at times, but most of Miike's films are like that and they really help the film.  Of course, there is massive amounts of gore, some of it truly insane.

3704833,4,B0009S2SV2,"Pellington wrote, ""Also, near the end when a certain character takes one of Ichi's foot blades in his forehead, the wound disappears when he hits the ground..."" He writes that this is an oversight on the part of the director.

Just a clarification. Kakihara's wound from the foot blade not appearing is intentional, not an oversight. Kakihara only imagined the last fight with Ichi.

Kakihara, the film's ultimate sadomasochist, had worked up the idea of Ichi being the ultimate sadist. When he finally meets Ichi, he is dissapointed to find that the real Ichi is a cowering wimp. He had hoped to be killed by a true killer, like the Ichi in his mind, not the crying Ichi before him.  So as Ichi lies crying on the ground, Kakihara fantasizes that Ichi gets up from the ground and fights him like a the killer he imagined. But the last fight is just in his head. And the wound that Ichi inflicts is not real. That's why when Kakihara appears dead on the ground the scar is missing. He died by committing suicide, a proper attending for the world's biggest sado-masochist.

The film is made up of these psychological points of intersection: the masochist meeting the sado-masochist and they occur throughout the movie. Sometimes the points are subtle (like the scar on the forehead). Sometimes they are not (Miss Tachibana getting sliced up by Ichi).

3704837,4,B0009S2SV2,"Ichi the Killer is a movie I've wanted to see for quite a while, due to its notoriety alone. After seeing it, I can safely say the reputation its gorier scenes garnered exceeds the horror of the subject matter. Regardless, this movie stands as a brutal exploration-- Or perhaps exploitation of the human mind's darker elements, each scene unapologetically soaked with bile and reproductive fluid. Not to say Ichi the Killer doesn't hold its severed tongue in its cheek from time to time, but this isn't for the weak-stomached, obviously. The story in short, revolves around a yakuza gang led by a cryptic masochist named Kakihara. After being let go by his higher-ups, Kakihara seeks the elusive murderer Ichi the Killer to avenge his boss, Anjo, who is M.I.A. Why? Because Kakihara misses the beatings administered by Anjo. The viewer is given a short glimpse of Ichi's carnage from the start; a room splattered with entrails, the ceilings streaked with blood. This denotes the work of an inhuman killer, but in reality, Ichi is a mentally unstable and childlike figure brainwashed by Jiji, a man who has a vendetta against the former Anjo gang. Intricate character relations form like spiderwebs, driving through the gore-ridden scenes to reach a strangely subversive, yet satisfying climax.

Despite the overtly flamboyant characters, Ichi the Killer maintains an impressively bleak atmosphere, heavily pronouncing the brutality of the extreme comic violence. If you can't stand scenes of torture, stay away from this one. Despite his goofy appearance, Kakihara is one of the most psychotic movie antiheros I've seen in some time, emphasized by the suave and collected delivery of Tadanobu Asano. His S & M scene half-way through the film, in which he utters ""there is no love in your violence,"" is rather disturbing on many levels. I don't think I'll ever forget the scene where Kakihara removes the pins that keep his mouth normal-sized, (due to the slits in his cheeks) and some fool gets the idea to punch him. Back to the subject of ridiculous imagery, Ichi is adorned with some sort of seinen/superhero attire, equiped with only small razors on his heels. Nao Omori's performance is impeccable, capturing the boyish innocence in Ichi's sick acts of depravity with ease. The violence and gore is highly exaggerated, with necks spurting like water fountains and entrails flying across rooms. What may be more uncomfortable for viewers however, are various brutal rape scenes. They aren't too graphic in comparison to some other controversial movies I've seen, but the sexual violence seems very realistic and unsettling.

The movie's not without its flaws, though. Ichi the Killer is often excessively indulgent, and I guess it's arguable as to whether or not that's a problem. It portrays extreme violence, a physical perversion of the body, as the norm; often getting lost in its own idea. As for stupid goofs, there is a scene where you can actually see the tube that pumps fake blood out of a guy's throat. Also, near the end when a certain character takes one of Ichi's foot blades in his forehead, the wound disappears when he hits the ground. Small oversights like that don't really add up to much in the end, though.

3704838,5,B0009S2SV2,"Takashi Miike films are usually disturbing films.  So if people are  weak of stomach, they best not apply when watching Ichi the Killer.  After watching another Miike film, Audition,  I thought that was as disturbing as it got.  However, Ichi the Killer proved me wrong, way wrong by hundreds of miles.  I have not seen a gorier film in my life.  And not only is it gory, but it will get to you and make you cringe at least a couple of times, even for the most hardcore gore or horror fanatic.

While the movie is called ""Ichi the Killer"" it hardly centers on the character of Ichi at all.  Instead, the movie focuses heavily on Kakihara, played wonderfully by Tadanobu Asano.  Kakihara is a sadomasochistic gangster, and quite the cool one to boot.  His style, his panache, his cockiness and his utterly mundane ways of torturing people all add to his overall personality and somehow give him a likeable persona that make his sadistic personality somehow amazingly cool.  The other characters also do a great job, especially Karen, played by Paulyn Sun, was enjoyable to watch for her flirty antics mixed with her inner bizareness was quite the complement to the overly bizarre Kakihara and the overly discreet Ichi. The only real problem with Karen was her strange mixing of english and Japanese, for it didn't make much sense and always seemed to be more random than anything.

One of the amazing aspects of this movie is the gore, and all of it is pretty much done with computer graphics.  Now, being not a big fan of cgi technology in movies (usually it makes the movie look more corny than realistic in my opinion), Miike does a splendid job in making some parts seem real in order to display the brutalness of the violence, and extremely corny in order to display the humor of the violence.  Knowing that a lot of Miike's violence in this movie is to have a humorous effect, it made me condone the use of cgi and also allowed me to enjoy this movie even more.  After all, i busted up laughing amazingly when Ichi cut this one guy in half.  It looked absolutely hilarious, which was Miike's purpose.

This movie, despite all its disturbing images and violence, is a black humor movie.  And if one has an open mind to this kind of thing, it can be rather enjoyable.  However, people will dismiss this as nothing more than just a gorefest, and its understandable because the plot is rather thin, even if there is some subtle subplots mixed in the whole scheme of things.  However, this movie is not a serious gangster movie.  It's a black comedy, one that rivals the best Quentin Tarantino films.  Yet viewers must be warned.  In order to get the full experience from Ichi the Killer, one needs to watch the uncut version.  The rated R version cuts so much stuff, that it takes away what Miike is trying to portray.  So suck it up and spend a little bit more on this masterpiece of gore and humor, because if one has an open mind, it is guarenteed they'll be satisfied and will have grown a little more tolerance to blood and gore in movies.",1143158400,,3045,4.531135531135531

Especially the scene where Ichi cuts someones face off and it slides down the wall. That was so cartoony looking you couldn't miss it. And what was with the chick who spoke English half the time but it was still subtitled? Wrongly subtitled no less.

There really is no excuse for this lacklustre effort, it seems to be pure shoddiness and a let's get it in the shops ASAP approach instead of the care and dedication to get a quality product on the market for the fans of the market.

3704844,2,B0009S2SV2,"Based on the reviews here, I was really expecting something shocking and amazing. Let me just say, this does *not* deliver. I'll grant that there is some gore here- characters walk into rooms literally drenched in blood- but most of the real violence takes place off-camera. Given that the movie description talks about rival gangs, and fighting and such, I was expecting to see some great, over-the-top action fighting. Unfortunately, there isn't really any fighting. Most of the violence is either Kakihara torturing someone, or Ichi killing or maiming them in a single hit. Boooring. Also, Ichi is *so* annoying and whiney. It's all a big, over-hyped mess, and the ending is ridiculous and nonsensical.

There are some really funny moments, to be sure, and it's a definitely a movie that knows not to take itself too seriously, but after seeing what the director is capable of with Audition, Ichi was a huge letdown. There's nothing here that you can't find done elsewhere, and done better. If you want to see gore and action, you can get both done better in Riki-Oh. If you want to see what Takashi Miike is capable of, check out ""Audition"" or ""Dead or Alive.""

If you keep your expectations lower than the hype, Ichi probably isn't so bad, but it doesn't even come close to the hype.",1136764800,,1288,4.771300448430493

Still compared to mainstream Hollywood, this is more like it, the opening sequence with the credits is something that has to be seen to be believed - I won't describe it here.

I don't particularily like the CGI used, I thought it was way too cartoonish (but maybe that was the point - since its based on a cartoon!).

It has some very funny parts and ludicrous over the top twist near the end which tops off all the craziness.

Mad flick, lots of tomatoe sauce, slicings, blood spurts and beatings etc and all that fantasy stuff.

WHat I got in the mail looked like the same movie. However, I've literally just finished weatching it..or most of it. I actually stopped to write this review and a letter to the merchant. EVERY SINGLE SCENE HAS BEEN CUT OR EDITED. There is no violence, only the suggestion of violence. There is no shocking bloodshed (as in the scene where a man gets split in half with a blade and literally peels apart while still living...). What remains is shocking only in the realization that all I got is a PG13 Japanese gang movie with poorly dubbed british accents. I can't friggin believe they actually sell this without the violence. I mean, what's the point? Isn't that what the whole genre is about? It would be like watching porno because you like the acting. NOT.

  I was initially alittle dissapointed at the fact that some of the violence was made using CGI and so kinda gave it a 'computer game' feel. However much was done using brilliant makeup and techniques. Everything is way over-the-top!

  I read a review somewhere here that there is too much focus on violence towards women and rape. Ok, it's put across that way however there is little that you get to see. Usually a flashack of a rape, or quick images of women beaten up. I can't say I found it all that offencive as many of he women in the film freely give themselves away for sex and abuse, even murder.

  The story is fairly well constructed, and I really liked the script. The film tends to use many interesting camera angles too, giving the end produt a comic-book feeling. However hat's what it is. No one can really disagree against all the gore because it's nearly all done with humour and comic book style.

Eh.

That sure didn't happen. There's some unhappy stuff, but nothing shocking to me. It's not disturbing.

There is gore. I like that. I don't like that it's CGI. That about ruined it.

Then there's the story. Whatever. I didn't find it all that interesting, to be honest. WOOHOO SADOMASOCHISM. Yeah, ok. They got the point across fairly early on, and then the movie last another two hours. Really, this film kinda dragged near the end.

At least(MINOR SPOILER ALERT AHEAD) we got to see a little kid die. And in the end, that's what really matters.

If Kakihara got his own spin-off TV show, that would be truly rocking. I would certainly give that five stars.

But yeah, if you want a film that will really make you squirm, watch Unspeakable(the one from 2000, not the 2003 movie with Pavan Grover). That was a really unsettling film.",1131235200,,1037,4.633879781420765

And this movie, though a little confusing at times, has a decent story and excellent characters. The case shows the best character in the movie.

Still, this movie will not appeal to everyone. In fact, I'd even say that few would find anything even close to likable in this movie. There are few scenes without blood, even fewer without the characters screaming in pain, and the majority of the characters are masochistic.

This film is NOTHING like that.  However, that's as close of a basic foundational structure I can give you to help explain this amazing psychological look into a world defined by violence and masochism.

The storyline is much too deep to give a proper synopsis without either making it sound cliched or giving away too much information, but basically it's a story about an ex-cop who brainwashes a tender, sensitive young man to kill all the ""bullies"" of the world in order to ignite gang violence.  It involves a lot of gore and a crazy sadomasochist with a torn-up face who delights in feeling hunted by Ichi.  Various characters all struggle to define their loyalties to violence which leads up to this absolutely stunning ending which frankly could never have originated in American cinema.

It's also quite visually appealing, both artistically and with gore.  It's an amazing film that anyone with a strong stomach should take the time to hunt down and see.

3704853,5,B0009S2SV2,"Ichi the Killer (aka Koroshiya 1 in Japan) is a tour-de-force of excessive violence that outdoes even the gialli masters like Argento, Fulci, Lenzi and Bava. Ichi the Killer's violence puts it in the realm of nightmare surrealism that's still to be surpassed and only matched in artistry by another auteur of film violence: Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch.

Storytelling has never been Miike's strong suit. Only in Audition has his penchant for stylistic scene arrangement and directions been subdued enough to allow for a straightforward story. Miike shares alot in common with Dario Argento in creating dream-like (some would say nightmarish) sequences of images to propel a story from one violent encounter to the next. Throughout Ichi the Killer whatever semblance of a plot --- one of revenge and depravity --- gets heavy doses of moments where the story takes on the surreal. The ending in of itself really adds to the surrealistic tone of the film.

The violence comes quick and lingers. This film is definitely not for everyone, but just like a carwreck many will be tempted to check it out just to see what everyone has been talking about. To call the violence in this film excessive is an understatement. Blood flows in this film in almost the same amount as those in Peter Jackson's Dead-Alive. And just like in Jackson's ode to Romero, Miike's use of violence is cartoonish to the point that I expected Itchy and Scratchy and Tom and Jerry to make an apperance. The term arterial spray takes on a new meaning with Ichi the Killer and people who have seen Tarantino's Kill Bill can see where his inspiration for the Tea House sequence came from.

The characters in the film are very developed despite the over-the-top nature of the film. Every character in the film seem to have an inherent predilection to cause violence and pain on everyone else or have it inflicted on them. From the prostitutes to the children, violence and pain are the common denominator that everyone shares. Of particular note is the character of Kakihara, the sadistic Yakuza killer who goes on a spree of torture and killing to find the person or persons who killed his mob boss. Where the character of Ichi takes on an almost superheroish role, Kakihara is a character study in the nature of sadomasochism at its most extreme. By film's end Kakihara seems to be more of the hero of the film than Ichi. Kakihara's emjoyment at inflicting pain and receiving it is made compelling by the performance of Tadanobu Asano. He gives a chilling and intriguing performance that's infused with the rockstar-worpship mentality that some Japanese action-stars are known for. Before Capt. Jack Sparrow, Asano's Kakihara took the rockstar persona to new genre heights.

To say more about the film is really irrelevent since it'll just be to point out that Miike's film is ultra-violent. I must say that Ichi the Killer continues Miike's visual commentary on the nature of violence and how despite its distasteful nature people will try to experience it to sate their personal curiosity. Ichi the Killer doesn't so much as desensitize the audience to violence but shows them that we all have the capacity for infliciting and having it inflicted on us. Just watching the film could count as being both. The film is really not for a majority of the filmwatching community, but rest assured more people will have seen this film not because they're fans of this type of film, but because they were curious.",1129334400,,3474,4.863175675675675

I read reviews of ""Ichi the Killer"" and was intrigued to watch it. I must say hands down it's 2 hours and roughly 15 minutes of non-stop downward spiral violence, sadisim, gore, torture and twists.

Brief Spoiler: Movie starts out with a syndicate (japanese mobster) boss getting killed by Ichi, who is a brainwashed youth. He had been brainwashed for what seems like a long time by a former member of the syndicate. This ex-syndicate member leads Ichi to believe that each member he's setting him up to hit bullied him (Ichi) as a child. Ichi snaps and the blood bath soon begins.

Meanwhile Kakihara a very wild syndicate member starts painting the town red (excuse the pun) looking for the killer(s) of his boss. Though during the film he keeps saying his boss is still alive. You find out eventually that Kakihara loved this syndicate boss because he was the only person who could beat him the way he liked it. Kakihara loves pain and is a torture expert. He has both sides of his mouth cut all the way to the hinge in his jaw and held together with 2 rainbow metal hoops, which he can yank out and open his mouth up extremely wide. Very good special effects when Kawkihara smokes and blows it out both slits on the sides of his face. Also when he uses it to hold a punch from a person he's hunting down. Eventually biting all the skin off the top of his hand.

This movie is not for the meak and not a movie to watch right after eating an italian saucey dinner. This movie goes way beyond what you would ever see in the U.S. theater. I do believe the censors just looked at this film and let it go. If they edited it, all you would see is opening credits and ending credits. Enjoy!",1124582400,,1849,4.384839650145772

As for the gory effects; a crybaby killer leaves a trail of red paint and pig intestines wherever he goes. Honestly, the whole film is so overdone, it is laughable. By the way, notice that the killer has a three inch blade that pops out of the heel of his shoe. With that blade he slices people in half!

3704859,4,B0009S2SV2,"When I first saw ICHI THE KILLER I was totally sitting on needles as for the violence to expect. Would I be able stomach it, will my mind be the same afterwards? That drew a lot of attention away from the movie as a whole. Whenever a woman appeared I was praying for her to leave the scene as there's a lot raping and brutal treatment of women here. When the movie was over I felt that a lot had just been plain boring, until I watched it again weeks later. This time I knew that however hard the movie is, I can stomach it. All the fears of self-derrangement had gone, I was concentrating on character development, settings, actors, the story, and saw a totally different movie this time. Take away all the violence and this flick still is astonishing.

I'd descripe ICHI as some sort of cartoon hero such as Batman etc., only that things are very different here than in those other classics. There's a young guy playing beat'em'up video games all day long while at night he's out to slay baddies. Only that ICHI has no superhuman abilities, he's just a brilliant fighter with blades on the shoes and a mind that seems unable to tell reality from illusion. He's not exactly killing baddies because he wants to make the world a better place: he gets sexual satisfaction by comitting or watching violence in the most extreme way. But he's not alone, a group of ex-yakuzas is out to bring down one of the most dangerous yakuzas, Kakihara. It seems that a direct hit on this guy is impossible, so a plan is needed to pull some strings that should wipe (...) Kakihara off this planet, the plan begins when Kakiharas boss, Anjo, is secretly being killed and removed only to cause chaos within the yakuza gangs. The plan is ICHI. They show him photographs of a target, tell him lies about the guy being involved in a faked, brutal event in Ichi's past that actually never happened, and on Ichi goes, his mind shut down, reality becomes a blur, the shoe blades cut throught air and meat, body parts fly throught the air so that a special cleaning team is needed afterwards to get rid of anything that could lead anyone to Ichi. Which is going to happen sooner or later. But regarding the gore Ichi is leaving behind, Kakihara gets really interested in meeting this sick (...), not knowing that this ""ice cold killer"" in fact is a boyish milk face with some screws lose.

An interesting movie. Very brutal and bloody, sometimes it's more laughable as the victims of the torturer seem more like dulls as the pain they're going throught would surely knock them off immediatly. The reactions on the inflicted pain are not all too realistic, which I am thankful for, it turns out to be more cartoonish in those scenes. But then, on the other hand, the treatment on women is absolutly painful, almost pornographic and very real, one punch looks and feels like three and they're screaming and crying crazy while being raped... but that's better this way in my opinion, a raping shouldn't be boiled down to a funny experience to watch (if there has to be one at all). Interesting that in a way, this happens with the uncomfortable Kakihara scenes, however brutal they are, they're rather funny.

A sick movie indeed. Beautifully shot, brilliant acting, ominous treating of woman, interesting characters, an astonishing overall mixture as the main theme is ultra serious, the details are funny, painful, laughable, sick, sad and deadly dramatic the same time, the humour is pitch black, Ichi is plain sick and seriously pitiful...

I's the modern version of A Clockwerk Orange with a more beautiful visual flair towards the violence that can also look beautiful. It's just a lot more extreme if you're watching the unrated version. Believe me, people who found this movie wasn't that brutal must surely have seen the rated version.

what more can you ask more? it's yakuza, gangster, comedy (dark), gore, action, with a little message about the society: gay, rape, bullies, etc. some of it is a little too much, and the movie is definitely not for everyone.

the only thing about the movie that i didn't like was probably the character, ichi, i don't know, he's quite annoying. on the other hand, kakihara is definitely one of my favorite characters of all time, he 's just that cool.

to be honest, i didn't quite get the ending, did kakihara died? did ichi lives? who was the guy at the end? but then again, that's what movies are all about, like art and paintings, you may see it differently than the painter, is it a flower, is it a dog? you might see one thing today, tomorrow you'll might see it differently.

In true Miike fashion, ""Ichi"" moves from sentimental, to sexy, to complete madness over and over again, and you'll keep asking for more. I'm not really into all the gore (gore factor 10 on this one), but I guess Miike uses this to put his mark on the film. There's a lot to like about this, especially the special effects: deep fried yakuzas, the cutting off of tongue as apology, Ichi literally cutting people in half like a sheet of paper, and the super classic scene where the little guy emerges as a hulking mass of muscle and then proceeds to literally twist a guy into a pretzel.

There are better Miike films, and more thoughtful ones, but if you are having a house party or similar gather with some open mineded friends who want to have some fun, Ichi is a sure bet.

  Which is not to suggest that I have a problem with violence in motion pictures.  It is just that, the violence in ""Ichi"" is so horrific it often feels like violence for violence's sake.  Picture the infamous torture scene from Miike's own ""Audition"".  Now imagine that scene played out for a full two hours and six minutes.  That is a pretty good idea of what it feels like watching this film.
  However, the characters in the film are all intriguing and well-developed, even if the story (a revenge tale at its heart) may be a little weak.  There are no heroes in this film.  In fact, it could be argued, that there are two anti-heroes, Kakihara, a criminal with a ""torn"" face and Ichi himself.  Kakihara, despite the horrific acts he is shown committing, comes off as strangely likeable through his dialogue and background actions (he is shown in one scene watering two plants, right before biting off most of the skin on someone's hand.)
  Ichi, a very obviously psychologically disturbed young man, is being manipulated to kill, and as a viewer you often feel sorry for him, despite the often horrific acts he commits as well.  One restaurant scene in particular is difficult to watch because you simply feel so sorry for Ichi.
  No one under 18 should be watching this movie however.  It features excessive violence (cartoonish at times), violence towards women, and scenes of graphic torture and rape.  If you can stomach that, then this movie comes highly recommended.",1118793600,,1765,4.765676567656766

It doesn't seem to know which genre it wants to belong in: dark comedy, revenge-crime, martial arts, gangster, etc.  I suppose it has elements of all of these, and yet they just don't seem to gel all that well.  There are definitely some memorable scenes in this film, but the violence was just too over-the-top and cartoonish for my tastes.  I wouldn't recommend this film (except maybe to hard-core misogynysts) and yet I wouldn't try to talk someone out of seeing it either.

At one point, Kakihara, as an act of atonement, cuts off his pierced tongue only to take a cell phone call immediately afterwards. this is entertaining articulate film that everyone should see.",1117152000,,567,5.604651162790698

The main story is on a Yakuza boss who's gone missing.  One of his henchmen(Tadanobu Asano) is going as far as tourturing a man not responsible whatsoever(And this guy is freaky, he'd rather torture people for fun instead of information).  But he has yet to interrigate a pure deluded sadistical maniac, Ichi(Nao Omori).  I'm telling you, if this guy starts crying, take te next plane out of whatever country you're in, unless you want to see your own intestines and blood slattered all over a wall.

This movie just goes directly into some of the sickest of demented human sicknesses I've ever seen.(Possible spoilers)  I mean, a woman who loves being beat up, and raped, a man who wants his woman to hit him like she wants to kill him, and aw man not to mention the torutre tactics:  denipiling, hanging off your back from hooks, and man this movie is just sick.

The only thing that left be really baddazzaled was the ending.  I didn't understand it, and it leaves questions that will never be answered.  That's the only thing that kinda let me down.

This movie explores the way a human mind can effect the real world, if they don't get any kind of help, and man, it's pretty freaky.  Anyone who loves gore and stuff, should check this out.  Anyone who says the directer is over his head, and needs help should understand that this is a movie, it's entertainment.  I mean magic in a movie is more rediculas, where in the real world, there can be some people like this.

Kakihara has to be my favorite character, by far, I was almost disappointed when the ending came around, but what happened definitely completes the characters cycle, and I just...these sorts of endings never fail to excite and complete.

I'm always in awe of what seems to be the Asian ability to kill off anyone and everyone throughout one of their films, never get attached to anyone, please!

I was deeply enthralled by this movie and love the creative quirks it has given me.  If you're easily disturbed, don't watch this movie.  And if you like violence in your movies, you may want to think again.  This takes violence into a light that most american's don't see, ART.

I don't mind violence in films -- some of my favorite films are the Godfather series, Taxi Driver, GoodFellas, Total Recall, Pulp Fiction, Casino and Kill Bill. However, Ichi the Killer nauseated me. Takashi Miike seems determined to put every sexual fetish, every sick perversion and every violent act imaginable onto film. After seeing this film, I felt unclean and disturbed. And judging from what I've heard about his other work, including Audition, I don't think Miike varies his themes or tempers his bloodlust that much. Like I said, I can take lots of violence in movies, but this is just too much. I hope Takashi Miike gets some serious psychological help -- he desperately needs it.",1108944000,,937,4.974522292993631
3704871,5,B0009S2SV2,"I really had no idea what I was in for with this film (frankly I was deathly scared to watch it but a friend kept daring me to and calling me ""chicken"" (I was bullied, you might say, just like our poor film's protagonist antisuperhero - God love him, you really CAN'T help but feel sorry for this kid, even as TOTALLY messed up as he is), so that I finally capitulated to the experience), and I am a little squeamish (well honestly, MORE than a little) by nature so that cinematic violence, or any kind of violence for that matter, typically repulses me with the greatest intensity and I shy away from violence in art imitating life or life imitating art at every turn.  Yet ""Ichi"" cannot be judged because of its violence.  This film is PURE ART because of the way it ABSOLUTELY HAUNTS you, with its deep psychological questions (where DO we draw the line between pleasure (happiness!) and pain (misery, despair, depression)?  Answer - everybody draws the line a little bit (or a LOT, in the case of THIS movie) differently; spiritual quandaries (for example, Ichi's existential conundrum cum (no pun, or Ichicum, intended) epiphany:  ""she wants to die because she DOESN'T want to die!""  My God!  This film is what superior modern moviemaking at its highest fever pitch is ALL ABOUT!  Way to go Miike!!!

Despite ""Ichi's"" WAY-over-the-top breakneck (and often ""spray neck!"") graphic psychodramas, there is every range of human and even humane emotion and sentiment to be found in this amazing masterwork.  Unlike the PURELY exploitational horror flicks of Andy Warhol, for example (""Dracula,"" ""Frankenstein""), director Takashi clearly shows love and compassion, albeit in very modest quantities, towards almost ALL of his characters.  I cried almost every scene in which the poor beleaguered excop Kaneko struggles heroically to retain his integrity and honor in the face of near TOTAL ""loss of face"" (orientally speaking).  When Kaneko dies near the film's climactic denoument, I wept bitterly because HERE is a GOOD MAN - SO GOOD, he does not want to kill Ichi, but only shoots him in the foot to try and stop him from rampaging further.  Because Ichi is mentally insane he kills his ""brother,"" but not without concomitant and extreme followup torment afterwards.  When Ichi says ""I'm sorry"" endlessly, HE MEANS IT!!!  He's just so messed up inside, and nobody (except Kaneko) gives a care about him, but instead Ichi really IS constantly bullied, harassed and hideously manipulated (by the diabolical excop ""Jijii"").  Did Ichi REALLY kill his parents, or can we trust anything Jijii says at all?

Yet!  Even Jijii is a figure for compassion in the end, because he regrets the carnage he's unleashed and the damage he's wreaked upon the innocent and the not-so-innocent alike, that - Judas-like - he hangs himself in the closing scene - because he realizes finally he's BETRAYED the goodness within his own soul, caused the deaths of COUNTLESS people, and violating his own ethics as a police officer to ""protect and to serve.""  We see him pitying the death of Kakiharo, stroking the young man's bleached-blonde hair, almost lovingly.  Yes, there IS a homoerotic element in this moment, but much more importantly, the failed yearning for a compassionate resolution to the incendiary Japanese gang crisis.  All Dead!  All Dead!  That's how the final caption reads psychologically here, and what is left for Jijii?  It's clear he actually LOVES Kakiharo, and thus commits suicide when his beloved is gone.  Amazing!

This movie has more twists and turns than a python roller coaster, and if you can get past (or close your eyes) during the really HEAVY (gruesome) scenes, you will see some top-flight acting and some even GREATER attempts at exploring the inner workings of the human mind, heart and soul.

Now I never thought I would be so HIGH on a whacked-out horror film like this, but like I said, it's HAUNTING.  It's addicitng and it brings you back to watch it again, and again, to find out the subtleties you missed in viewings n-1, n-2, and so on.

Do see ""Ichi"" if you can.  It satisfies a kind of ""itch"" in all of us, more or less.  It certainly satisfied me, and I am the biggest coward of them all when it comes to stomaching horror lore.  But I fell in love with ""Ichi,"" for reasons not altogether clear to me even now, except that in every character I encountered, I felt deep compassion towards him or her.  I tried to understand exactly WHERE he or she was coming from (psychologically/spiritually/emotionally/mentally), and just tried to suspend all judgment as best as possible.

You will too, if you give ""Ichi"" a scratch, and a fighting chance to capture your heart, without tearing it completely out of your chest.  If you treat the film as cathartic psychodrama rather than ""cinema verite,"" you will go a LONG LONG WAY towards understand what Miike is trying to get across to all of us.

He's definitely NOT advocating violence for violence's sake.  But instead, love.  It's just that, a lot of these poor souls in the story don't know HOW to love properly, because they themselves have never BEEN loved properly.  Miike is offering us a ""morality play"" and a hope for more humane treatment of our fellow passengers and soulmates on the one ship we all share, Spaceship Earth.  Again, WAY TO GO MIIKE!!!",1108684800,,5328,4.825991189427313
3704872,3,B0009S2SV2,"I heard that Takashi Miike was an extreme director and I read the reviews of his movies on Amazon.  It appeared to me that Ichi the Killer and Visitor Q were the most extreme and the ones to see.

I really didn't know what to expect from Visitor Q, it didn't sound violent but perverse.  It sounded like a serious drama (I like serious dramas too but I am talking about my interest in finding good extreme movies) so I was not sure I would like it that much.

To me Ichi sounded like a total bloodbath and the one I was most interested in.  I planned on checking out Ichi and decide if I wanted to try Visitor Q after that.  So when I was at the cult movie rental store, I requested to rent Ichi.  I am very glad it was already rented out, because if I saw Ichi first, I might have lost interest in seeing Visitor Q, which is a movie I loved and immediately added to my collection.

Ichi the Killer was good but it has some elements that I really hate.

It has a lot of CGI.  Not only do I hate CGI to begin with, this had some of the worst CGI I have ever seen.  In one scene, Ichi cuts a guy in half the long way with his stupid blade shoes.  The guy splits and the 2 halves fall.  These effects were extremely poor.  Apparently the guys body was a solid red all the way through with no brains or organs.

Another scene shows blood flying out of a door as Ichi is mutilating the people inside the room.  The flying blood is CGI.  The blood moves totally unnaturally without momentum and speed to carry it as it is shown.

In other scenes blood is CGIed on walls that looks entirely fake as well.

To tell about myself, I hate horror slashers like Friday the 13th, Halloween, or Nightmare on Elmstreet.  What I do like is outrageous comedy gore such as Dead Alive and Troma extremes like Citizen Toxie and Terror Firmer.

Ichi had only one good ""Troma"" style scene and that is where the guy featured on the cover (Kakihara) cuts off his own tongue as an apology to a rival gang leader. (This was his own idea not the idea of the other guy)

Another good scene was when they cut the nipples off the woman.  This scene was more in the style of ""Emmanuelle in America"" and not ""Troma"".  I thought ""Emmanuelle in America"" did it better though.

I didn't like the scene with the guy hanging from hooks and having the tempura oil thrown on him, which appears to be most other reviewers' favorite and most extreme scene.  To me, it was rather boring and obviously touched up with plastic looking CGI.

Also Ichi's character was poorly developed in the story.  It was well explained why he was killing and that he was being manipulated by someone else but the movie has no explanation as to why he is so good at killing.  It doesn't make sense to manipulate Ichi this way unless you first know he has the incredible talent it takes to kill like this.

Overall the story and characters were interesting but it was a good movie rather than a great movie.  I will continue checking out more of Miike's other films but with lower expectations than after I finished Visitor Q.",1103846400,,3064,4.249134948096886
3704873,3,B0009S2SV2,"Overall after watching this overhyped hyper violent film I must say it's pretty overrated.  Ichi the Killer isn't that great of a film.  It has average actors, average, plot and the film felt average in a cool yet very refreshing way.  Some people say that this film is the Citizen Kane of Arterial Spray which is so untrue.  This wasn't Takashi Miike best I will say.  Sorry if I ticked some people off but this film is highly overrated.  It's just popular for it's extreame Violent Content.  The film is just plain average if you ask me.  I had an enjoyable time watching this film but overall this wasn't a great film as many people have claimed it to be.

Now once again it's my time to review on something I like to call ""A small review on overhyped violence"".  This film is not as graphic as many people have claimed it to be, sure there is one particular scene which involves hooks and hot oil but that's it, the film is pretty violent but it's too overhyped if you ask me.  There are worse films then this trust me!  By Violence standard I mean....Overall...a few violent parts and that's it.  It's just plain average(and yes It was the Uncut Unrated version I saw)....Not as graphic as people say it is...

I also found the character ""Ichi"" to be very stupid and annoying at some points of the film.  I though he was really wierd and annoying and some of the stuff that comes out of his mind is just funny like one part were he saves a girl from being raped...God that part was hilarious...

Overall Ichi the Killer was a pretty average Yakuza flick...A popcorn flick so to speak, The actors were just average actors, The plot was ok I guess it was pretty much the violence that got alot of fans attention but hey that's just one mans opinion so don't start getting all mad about one mans opinion...Overall Ichi the Killer is pretty average flick with some ""violent NOT extreamly violent"" content which is the selling point of this film and Overall I give it a

3704875,5,B0009S2SV2,"""Ichi the Killer"" is a cinematic tone-poem to ultraviolence, a sleek red-hot super-sized serving of cinematic slaughter and winking nihilism that, in a supreme credit to its creator Takashi Miike, persuasively advances the argument that bloodletting can indeed be a thing of sublime beauty.

Whatever you think about Japanese uber-director and cinestylist Takashi Miike---cinematic God-Emperor, criminal mastermind, visionary, genius, madman, pornographer, sadist, lunatic---you have to admit four truths about him hold: 1) he's fearless; 2) he's prolific; 3) he doesn't skimp on the special sauce; and 4) within about 2 minutes you can figure out if one of his masterworks is going to exceed your personal puke threshold. It's all about setting realistic expectations.

Take ""Ichi the Killer"" then: 'Koroshiya 1' is its Japanese title, 'Ichi' being Japanese for ""Number 1"" and 'koroshiya' meaning ""killer"", the title reading effectively ""Number One Killer"" and the correspondent Japanese ideograms rising up in bas-relief constructed from the eponymous idiot-savant [...] own seminal juices that form the film's opening credits (NOTE: you must watch ""Ichi"" in the original Japanese with English subtitles, or you're just wasting your time).

Within the first iconic five minutes of this thing, you'll know whether ""Ichi"" is for you, and---coincidentally---you'll also have pretty much all the plot the movie has to offer. Things are already wrong in the techno-neon glittering sprawl of Tokyo's crime-infested Shinjuku district, where a Yakuza clean-up team has been dispatched to scrub the site of the [...] Ichi's latest killing.

Ichi, evidently, is not a believer in the ""Clean Hit"". The team has to wear bio-hazard gear, industrial booties, and goggles to enter the once sleek apartment of top Tokyo crime boss Anjo, which the still unseen Ichi has turned into an abbatoir festooned with the crime-lord's body parts: the walls still run slick and wet with blood, and intestines are tossed about on the expensive furniture like plump red sausages.

Soon enough Anjo's loyal thugs show up, lorded over by his deputy, lover, top [...] and all-around hipster Kakihara (played to the acid-envenomed hilt by Tadanobu Asano, who owns this movie), whose battle-scarred face looks like a Tokyo streetmap. One of his opponents has thoughtfully expanded Kakihara's mouth by about three inches; he holds it together with two little hoop earrings, and when he takes a philosophic drag on a cigarette, smoke vapor trails out through his flayed cheeks. But the clean-up crew has been thorough: not a trace of Anjo is left, the Yakuza decide the Big Boss is missing along with 100 million Yen, and Kakihara is determined to find him.

Seconds later---and mind you, this all occurs in the film's first few minutes---we catch a glimpse of Ichi, avidly watching a brutal rape through apartment blinds and enjoying himself.

Squeamish? Then you've probably already checked out. Otherwise, turn off any moral faculties you possess and enjoy a visually kinetic, insane, brutal little travelogue through Hell.

This is what ""Ichi the Killer"" is about: brutality, butchery, rape, massive atrocity, torture, murder, degredation, and high good humor and insane dollops of style. Oh, and something about a gang war. Kakihara is all kinds of cool, the film's Crawling King Snake: he struts about in his platinum punk hair and leather trenchcoat exuding malice, serenely and maliciously presiding over his doomed victims like one of Hell's more stylish demons.

On the other side we have the character of Ichi (Nao Omori).  I found Ichi annoying at first: when he's not flying through the air and slicing his victims into sushi with his razor-blade track shoes, he's writhing on the ground in angst-ridden torment and crying like a little girl. Hell, sometimes he flies through the air, blades a-twitching for fresh meat, crying all the time.

And that, precisely, is what makes him fascinating and terrible: Ichi is a monster. He's an automaton, once taunted at school, now working a wretched job as a short-order cook and snivelling pathetically for time off (to go slaughter Yakuza, which he's ordered to do by the mysterious JiJi, who issues his Manchurian Candidate-esque orders over the telephone): Ichi is what would happen if you spliced the genes of Bob Cratchit and ""Taxi Driver""'s Travis Bickle. Brrr.

Miike is not a simple director, and thus, delightfully, ""Ichi the Killer"" is not a straightforward revenge flick. Kakihara is professionally and personally dedicated to destroying Ichi, but he is perversely fascinated by and attracted to him as well. Ichi, when not traumatized and crying or razoring to pieces some unfortunate Yakuza, is likewise drawn to Kakihara: indeed, the two orbit each other, like tiny ferociosly violent little planets, spiralling closer and closer to some orgasmically apocalyptic collision.

And apocalyptic is what you get. That's really what ""Ichi the Killer"" is all about: there is no sub-text, no ur-message, no wry social commentary here; I truly believe Miike has painted a compelling picture of highly stylized nihilism on his blood-spattered canvas, something the happy Droogies from ""A Clockwork Orange"" would instantly recognize as a little of the old ultraviolence.

People are not simply 'killed' in ""Ichi"": they are galactically ripped apart; raped and squished; stomped on and exploded; suspended from the ceiling from fish-hooks, from which position they can be flayed, boiled alive, or treated to tiny little needles being shoved through their tongues and eyeballs. Faces are ripped off, sliced in half, and slither/slide down the walls of countless rooms turned, by Ichi and Kakihara's magic, into charnel houses. It's all movingly beautiful, surprisingly repulsive, and highly addictive. Even the theme is simple and stark and beautiful, a little riff that calls to mind the old spaghetti western anthems of Ennio Morricone (fittingly, Kakihara's cell phone ring tone is the movie's theme).

I have written before about the viral quality of much of the best Asian horror, and ""Ichi the Killer"" is no exception. If there is such a thing, ""Ichi the Killer"" itself is a pure chunk of evil, highly toxic and contagious. You don't want to look but you have to watch, and the price of watching is having to replay the scenes on your closed eyelids long after the final credits have rolled---and being happy to do it. You are arrested, halted, infected, probably fatally compromised. ""Ichi the Killer"" is genius masquerading as virus.",1099872000,,6564,5.261950286806884

3704877,4,B0009S2SV2,"When I was 10 years old a friend of mine told me that ""The Lord of the Flies"" was such a great book because it was about a group of lost schoolboys who went crazy and started eating eachother. I was so horrified that I went straight to the library and read the book cover to cover in about three days (I found out by the end that my friend had lied to me, but it turned out to be a good book anyway). The point of the story is that I have always been fascinated by things that shock/horrify me. I call it the car crash syndrome; the inability to turn away or lose interest in something that is universally seen as shocking or grotesque.

In order to sit through Ichi the Killer you need to have at least a little bit of that syndrome lurking inside you. Ichi the Killer is quite possibly the most disgusting film ever made (ever seen Braindead? say no more); a human embodiment of Itchy and Scratchy if you will.

The film situates us in the underbelly of the Japanese underground, where the Yakuza rule the streets and every taboo imaginable roams free and unapologetically. Our protagonist, a Yakuza cappo known as Kakigahara, is a sadist who is sexually aroused by pain. He might actually be one of the greatest characters ever put on screen, with his bleach-blonde hair, flamboyant clothing and piercings that are so cringe-worthy that you have to see the film in order to truly get the picture (let's just say that his mouth has exceedingly more potential than most mouths do). His boss is (or was) a masochist who essentially fulfilled all of Kakigahara's sadistic needs until one day he dissapears. Kakigahara spends the rest of the movie searching for his boss with only one lead: Ichi. Ichi is another great character - he is a super human slicing and dicing machine whose power derives from his costume. He is bent on mutilating all that stand in his way; he leaves a disgusting trail of clues for our protagonist to track him down with, i.e. corpses cut in half, disemboweled, decapitated etc... not to mention the glob of semen that he leaves behind as well because of how aroused he gets whenver he inflicts pain.

Takashi Miike directed this film so you cannot really expect anything less than shocking, but this really takes the cake even for Miike's standards. Underneath the blood and gore there is, actually, a very good story that deals with interesting themes (considering the circumstances) such as love, loss; there is even an interesting existential sensibility to this film. The film leaves little space for characters to develop but there are very interesting characters nonetheless.

As a fan of Japanese film I really enjoyed this, although even as a car crash syndromee I found it really tough to sit through. If you have a sensitive gab reflex, or a weak stomach, I advise you to ween yourself onto this film by checking out some of Miike's less-gruesome works, such as Dead or Alive. I don't think there is anything in the history of film quite like Ichi the Killer, so I assure you that it is worth a look, but don't come crying to me if the man who cuts his own tongue out scares you.",1096502400,,3116,4.549019607843137
3704878,4,B0009S2SV2,"I've owned a copy if 'Ichi the Killer' for quite some time now.  When I first bought it I actually had to build upto it for a couple of days because I made the mistake of watching the trailer first.  The trailer (which it seems is what led many of the reviewers here to see the film) does its best to point out that the film is extremely gory, violent, unrelenting and down-right extreme.  The film is extreme but not as unrelenting as it would seem.

It represents a hap-hazard study of base human emotions and how they may be triggered in anyone of us.  Other reviewers mention 'unnecessary characters', specifically the cop's son.  Watch the film again and you'll see that he is one of much more important supporting roles for the reasons mentioned above.

I agree that many characters are simply not as fleshed-out as they should be and the film is over-long because of the confusion caused by this.  On the other hand though the acting is generally of a high standard and the film has a surreal comedy aspect that is filled with energy.

Many reviewers mention the violence of the film in a negative manner yet confess to watching the film because it is supposed to be violent.  They seem to believe that pain/sadism and violence are two different things.

This movie is brilliant, with the wonderful acting of Tadanobu Asano taking the front and the Directing skill of Takashi Miike, you can expect this movie to be great. This movie shouldn't be classified as Yakuza, or Gore, because there are other movies that focus more on Yakuza and other movies that have more gore. This movie does get your fix though for Yakuzas, Gore and though you may think I'm crazy for saying it, humor. I feel Takashi Miike's style of incorperating humor into this movie was brilliant. There are certain parts of the movie that you may feel make no sense the first time watching it but if you really think hard about it and maybe watch it another time, you'll realize that it's not all that hard to follow. There's also the factor of Sun Alien's constant language swtiching, which still annoys me to this day, however Sun Alien is a Chinese actress if I remeber correctly, and most people in Japan understand english so that could be the reason. Only 1 thing to be warned about is that there is an ""R"" version of the movie which is horribly edited, and the dub track is horrible. Theres only 1 way to watch a Japanese movie, and thats with subtitles.",1095465600,,1236,4.4734513274336285

3704881,5,B0009S2SV2,"Takashi miike is probably my favorite director. what amazes me about him is that he offten does as many as six or more moveis a year, wit h a low budget yet manages to come up with very well done movies. The story of this movie, which was adapted from the comic 'Ichi the Killer' by Hideo Yamamoto, could be described as a bizare, sadomastichistic homosexual love story. Kakihara's (tadonabu asano) boss, Anjo, is discovered missing, and begins an endless persuit to find him, or find those responsible for his death or dissapearence. This means the torchering a man by hanging him from meat hooks, sticking needles into his face, and then pouring boiling water over his skin. Although Kakihara sounds to be a sadist, his real pleasure is masochism. Kakiharas search for his boss is not to keep his yakuza gang together, but for selfihs reasons. They were lovers, Anjo gave kakihara the best pleasure he knew, that of course was pain. eventualy Kakihara comes to face the fact that Anjo was killed by a crybaby killer named Ichi, and is warned that he himself is the next target. Ichi is a brainwashed young guy, who cries constantly ,and has many sexual problems. He is brainwashed by the scheming Jiji, into killing of the entire Anjo group.

as the story continues, kakihara hunts for Ichi, not out of fear for his life, but in search of a mate that will give him the pain he so desires.

While this movie is incredibly graphic (scenes of women being mutilated, heads cut off, throats cut open, peircings etc..) its not really an exploitation film, although at times it is exploitive. while i myself find humour in seeing a mans cheeks being pulled off, i know others dont, and for this reason, if seeing blood makes you cry, don't watch this movie. Asides from all the blood, this movie is also very nicely shot, with inventive angels, flashy editing, and pretty good Special effects considering the budget it was made with. The acting is also good, both Ichi and Kakihara are greatly casted, also noteworthy is the beutiful alien sun who plays the role of karen .",1093737600,,2068,4.663013698630137
3704882,5,B0009S2SV2,"""Ichi the Killer"" (""Koroshiya 1"") is a stylistic, well-made film representing a Japanese idea that seems strange to most non-Japanese, the idea that violence, even extreme violence, can be beautiful.  As seen in films such as Kenka Ereji's ""Elegy to Fighting,"" violence is an art form and a genre of Japanese movies.

This film is about killing for the sake of killing, by those who love doing it with a sexual passion.  Kakihara, the masochistic Yakuza killer featured on the box cover, complains while receiving a beating that ""There's no love in your violence.""  To commit violence without love is like having sex without emotion, and empty physical act.  Director Miike Takashi has put love in his violence, and style and art.

Kakihara is the star of the film, being both brash and beautiful, but it is Ichi the Killer who is the true protagonist.  Mentally unstable and boyish to the extreme, Ichi is a deranged assassin who wears a superhero costume with a bold Number 1 (""Ichi"" means ""Number 1"" in Japanese) emblazoned on the back.  Ichi is an almost-controllable tool of Jijii, who plays the gangs against each other for a mysterious motive.  Jijii aims Ichi like a gun, then pulls the trigger.  Kakihara deepest fantasy is to be slain by Ichi, the ultimate killer, but not before the time is right.

As you can see from this description, ""Ichi the Killer"" is a trip into a dark underworld of sado-masochism, lustful violence and other avenues of human nature that most people would not willfully venture into.  It is without a doubt the finest film in the genre.",1093478400,,1572,4.781481481481482

3704887,5,B0009S2SV2,"Having only seen one Takashi Miike film (FUDOH - THE NEW GENERATION) before this, I was a little apprehensive when reading the back of this DVD. Though I enjoyed FUDOH, it wasn't what I would call a great movie. After reading the synopsis, I expected ICHI to be little more than a PULP FICTION-style thriller. Never a fan of John Woo or filmmakers of that type, I settled in to watch ICHI with slightly lower expectations than FUDOH (which, again, I enjoyed, but did not find great). Boy, was I ever in for a shock. The violence of FUDOH does not even begin to compare with that of ICHI... and FUDOH was one hell of a violent movie! More importantly than that, however, was the fact that beyond its often astounding violence was a great story filled with fascinating characters. Filmed in a super-fast-paced style, ICHI tells the story of ruthless yakuza assassin Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano is absolutely terrifying!), a maniac with a sadistic streak a mile wide and a masochistic streak just as wide, who goes on a rampage to find his boss, who has disappeared with a large sum of money. In his search for the missing ganglord, he quite literally leaves a trail of blood and guts behind him. His outrageously violent methods anger the other members of Japan's organized crime world, to a point that they enlist the help of the mysterious titular character in disposing of the maniac. Ichi remains unseen (or so we think) till well into the film (and his appearance is one of the biggest shocks of all), with only his gruesome handiwork on display till then. It all sounds very ordinary (or at least it did to me), but the beauty of this film (as well, I am led to believe, as Miike's others) is the director's ability to completely pervert the conventions of the crime thriller in order to deliver something that more closely resembles David Cronenberg than John Woo or Quentin Tarantino: this is no hip, tongue-in-cheek gangster comedy. Miike plays for keeps, as evidenced by the frequently disturbing imagery and subject matter. The acting in the film is worthy of mention as well. As stated before, Asano is very effective in the principal role; Shinya Tsukamoto (director of the wonderful TETSUO films) appears as a seemingly cowardly retired yakuza boss with a few schemes of his own; and almost everyone else leaves a very distinct impression (there is one actor in particular, who sounds as though he has some kind of breathing problem, who I will never forget, and I can't remember the character's name). Though often painful to watch (and I mean that in the most literal sense), there is a real and palpable beauty to the proceedings, which is due no doubt in part to the cinematography as well as the great editing. I read a review of this movie somewhere that said it was like one of the ultraviolent movies that Malcolm McDowell is forced to watch in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE as part of his brainwashing. I find that an amusing comparison, and it should let the viewer know what he or she is in for. I agree with the other Amazon reviewer who says that calling this a ""splatter"" movie is almost an insult; I think this is probably one of the best movies of the past decade, and deserves recognition as more than just a gorefest or crime thriller. Plus I love the ending. I think I could get to be a huge Takashi Miike fan: I've since seen AUDITION, HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS, and VISITOR Q, and I have no complaints so far about any of this man's films.

Lots of violence that goes nowhere, girls get raped and die in some brutal and sick ways, random scenes that add nothing to the film or plot. Just a whole lot of nothing from a director that has made a few of THE BEST films I have ever seen. The acting is actually done very well from the lead guy Tadanobu Asano and some even better acting from Ichi's right hand man in the film played by Shinya Tsukamoto (who made the excellent films Tetsuo the iron man and Tokyo Fist).

It totally lacks the emotion and suspense that ""Audition"", his best film, had.

3704893,3,B0009S2SV2,"I loved 'Audition' and I've been trying to get my hands on Visitor Q, in the meanwhile I stumbled across Ichi.  Considering it's by the same director, Takeshi Miike (a sort of Japanese Tarantino), and after reading up on the film's overall hype and reputation, I thought I'd give it a try.  I loved the cold, sterile style of cinematography and the narrative in Audition.  I was hoping this would be similar.  An intelligent yet warped storyline, submersed with dry wit, cynicism and surrealism.  I think there's definite elements from the 'Audition' side of things in there (particularly the torture scenes - which I was sorta hoping would be a tiny bit more graphic), but I didn't find it half as intriguing.
I guess the film mainly appealed to me because of my occasional bloodlust.  I don't even mind if the gore is senseless and irrelevant sometimes, as long as it's depicted realistically and fits somehow, even symbolically, into the context of the plot.  In the end, I found this film was really about pain which fills the empty void in life, illustrated in a sort of twisted s&m/fetish, murder and rape way.  I find that the director sorta likes to experiment on the viewers, and his films are the idyllic sort of stimulus medium in which to 'freak us out' and then make us think about why we watched his film and probably why we enjoyed it and want to see another.  I found that's the effect both Audition and Ichi had on me.
The only thing that kinda bothered me about the violence was how fake it was, like when Ichi slices through the first guy with his shoe-blade (which is the stupidest weapon, why not just use a knife for f**k sake) and he splits down the middle (although I'm pretty sure that was intended to be comedic as it is so obviously computer animated), or when Kakihara is punched in the mouth and his face wounds spread open.  I can see how it was supposed to be satirical in a way.  I think the biggest let-down was the ending, it seemed far too unplanned and incoherent.  Kakihara's demise was sort of romanticised which held the greatest relevance to the theme.  The fight scene was ridiculous though, and at that stage Ichi's nervousness becomes incredibly irritating.
Overall, generally it's an ok film, suitable for trippy late-night loneliness.  Some really good parts and an interesting concept, but it tends to drag on and a lot of the latter scenes and violence don't really have any point.  The films doesn't offer much in the way of exposition or explanation.  If you're looking for a more profound and substantial film which relates to pain and loneliness, Audition is much better.",1082505600,,2622,4.667391304347826
3704894,4,B0009S2SV2,"I would go on and on about Ichi the Killer's purported title of ""one of the most disgusting movies ever"" but it wouldn't get anyone anywhere.
Ichi the Killer is the tale of two very disturbed, homicidal maniacs. The first, the titular character of the story, is a man who literally gets off by killing others. The other is Kakihara, a pain-loving Yakuza whose threshold for the sensation is seemingly nonexistent.
One ""100% sadist"" and one crazed masochist balance out this twisted story of revenge and unbalanced chemicals.
When Kakihara's boss is killed by Ichi, the man goes on an obsessive search for him, whom he believes still lives. Leaving many broken and tortured along the way, Ichi is meanwhile being manipulated by Jijii, a shady and unscrupulous character who with his unwitting help is trying to force the Japanese underground to wipe itself out. As the two get closer to each other's tail, the story spirals to a rapid and bloody conclusion and leaves an indelible mark on the viewer, if even only by its shocking nature.
Based on the manga ""Koroshiya 1 (Killer #1),"" Ichi the Killer is a compelling piece of cinema by the prolific director, Takashi Miike. Like most of his other works, this is not a film that lulls you into a serene state; it slaps you in the face, tells you to sit up, and holds your eyes open to witness it in all its gut-covered glory. The violence is graphic and intense but so graphic that it's hard to forget that this is based on a manga.
The acting is well-done, but the obvious standout is Tadanobu Asano with his brilliant turn as Kakihara. Bringing humor and calm ferocity to a role that could have easily been mere slapstick violence, Asano even manages to give Kakihara humanity, regardless of the size of the scrap it is and the extent at which it appears.
The DVD isn't bad at all; not much in the way of special features. There is commentary by Miike and the original manga's creator. You'll need to catch your breath a long while after the movie's over anyway.
Ichi the Killer is definitely not for everyone. But if you take your cup of tea with a dash of blood and a side of entrails, perhaps you'll be just as entertained as I was by the movie.",1081728000,,2197,4.55050505050505

I'm not sure if I feel worse that I saw ""Ichi the Killer"" or that I actually enjoyed it! Probably neither actually. I saw ""Suicide circle"" a week before, and I feel I may have been somewhat hasty when I said in my review it was the weirdest movie I've ever seen - I think that ""Ichi"" might just have it beat...
Anyone who saw the humor in the ""American Psycho"" novel, or enjoyed ""Very Bad Things"" will definitely want to see this.  The plot is fairly ludicrous and poorly explained.  Some guys want to bust up some gang so they set a couple of gangs against each other.  I think that's it - although there were plenty of mistakes in the subtitles and my Japanese isn't so hot, but I think I got most of it.
Anyway, the real attraction isn't the plot, it's the characters, Ichi and Kakihara.  Ichi is a reluctant mass-murderer, while the Kakihara is a willing masochist.  Should be fun when they meet, right?  The premises and backstories are waaay out there and there's a subtle twist to the denouement and all in all it is a fantastically entertaining ride.

The violence in the movie is nothing unique or special. If you're considering this movie because you think it's violent, then understand that it is essentially an attempt at being pyschologically disconcerting more so than graphic.
The point of the plot is to psychologically jar you with the ideology of sado-masochism more so than the conventional exploration of Yakuza myth and lore. Except the plot is so thin and contrived that it'll bore psych-fans.
Much of the story-line is based off of your typical Yakuza film structure. There are the undistiguishable men who are to remain unremembered as simply backdrop supporting the story, only paying attention to a few characters seriously. Of course there is the comparison to childhood events that validate the actions of the characters. There's the blurred line between antagonist and protagonist. All violence in the movie is treated equally with the visible reaction of non-violent characters.
If you liked Kill-Bill, and haven't seen anything else of this genre, you'll like this film. If you're a veteran Yakuza film fan, you'll want it for your collection but will probably see 3 or 4 times again. If you're not into any of that, you'll be bored.
P.S. - One of the more interesting notes about this movie is that the main character, Kekehara, is played by a J-Pop star.",1080518400,,1534,4.881226053639847

Sadist: ""No!""
This is for those that think the violence is pointless or that the movie has no plot. If you haven't seen the movie you might not want to read this.
Jiji (the old man) is after Kakihara, why I have no idea. He wants to inflict as much pain as possible on Kakihara and his gang, which is difficult seeing how Kakihara is a masochist. Jiji is actually Ichi's old karate instructor (the muscular dude is the real Jiji the old man is his disguise). He knew Ichi when he killed his parents and used that to brainwash him. What he didn't know is that Ichi is a monster sadist who doesn't fully realize it. Jiji can't just go after Kakihara for no reason so he fixes it where he gets hired to do it, which is why he sets up Suzuki.
The violence in the movie comes in two forms, the comic book stylized violence which is almost comical and the ultra -realistic stuff, usually perpetrated against a female. The movie is not misogynistic, women are used because they are seen as being delicate and therefore the violence resonates more than it does violence against men. By contrasting these two kinds of violence Miike allows the viewer to set their own limitations for their consumption of violence; in fact, the whole sadism masochism thing could be seen as a reflection of this. (Miike could be saying that the person that perpetrates violence, the sadist (filmmaker), is no better or worse than the person who enjoys receiving it, the masochist, or viewer. (Miike makes the viewer identify with Kakihara by tricking us at the beginning.) The way in which Jiji (and Miike) get their revenge is through dissapointment. Instead of a huge violent showdown, ala DoA, we get a bawling Ichi laying on the ground a wreck. The part when Ichi kills the kid and goes after Kakihara is Kakihara's fantasy. Because no one inflicts pain on him he has to do it himself, just like when he cut out his tongue. This dissapointment is reinforced by flashing to him in his dungeon after Karen dissapointed him. And because the viewer was sitting their in anticipation of a big ol' violent confrontation we are revealed as sado-masochists ourselves.
A few cool things about this movie:
Miike spent two extra months on the CG (and extra money) on the part where Ichi splits the pimp in half. He could have made it more realistic looking in less time and for less money.
The customer in the hostess bar with Karen at the beginning was in Kill Bill. So were the guys that played Funaki and Takayama.
The guy that played Jiji is Shinya Tsukamoto the director of Tetsuo. The guy that played Kaneko is director Sabu.
At the beginning when they are in the hostess bar when Kakihara looks at Jiji's group if you look at him closely he looks exactly like Ichi. (Or is it just me?)
Well, those are just a few thoughts on this work of genius, I could probably go on all day. And if you can pick up Tom Mes's book ""Agitator"" about Takashi Miike.",1080432000,,2943,4.51310861423221

Another reason to watch this movie is because Tadanobu Asano's Kakihara(pictured on the cover) is one of the best performances I can remember.

However, like I said, I dig ""violence."" I don't really dig pain all that much. And that's exactly what I got from this.
Yeah, it was pretty cartoony most of the time, but there were occasions that were downright unforgiveable. What kind of sadist enjoys seeing a women raped, beaten, de-nippled (yes, it's a madeup word), and battered to death. Sadistic is indeed the word. This includes the film's first of many torture scenes involving hooks, needles, and hot oil. It's slow, drawn out, and simply not pleasant to watch. (And by ""not pleasant,"" I'm not talking about the kind of violence you saw in Schindler's List.)
Now that I've discussed the hot topic, there's another matter to be discussed. This film is plagued with unnecessary characters. The biggest examples are the ex-cop (who got fired for losing his gun) and his son. As for the other unnecessary characters, I guess it was just more people to torture to death, or murder in some other gruesome way, kind of like B horror movies from the 1980's, which no one ever claimed was art.
And if you try to say that they were imperative to a complex story, I say p-lease. Good movies, like Snatch or Gosford Park, that have large lists of characters usually employ them cleverly into the overall plot. They each mean something important, and have a substantial impact. You get the feeling that this story wouldn't have been nearly the same had that character been negated. In the case of Ichi, these characters were all just characters who knew other characters; simply more blank faces for the camera.
I'll give some credit to cinematography, and rushed filmmaking (I'm a huge Robert Rodriguez fan), but aside from that, this film is only worth seeing out of curiosity.",1078876800,,1903,4.700598802395209

3704902,4,B0009S2SV2,"Ichi the Killer (Takashi Miike, 2001)
Takashi Miike is a very, very strange man.
The director who had runaway (okay, relatively) success in America with 2000's Audition has resurfaced with this much-loved cult film from 2001. Instead of treading the same ground, Takashi did what many Japanese directors do; bent another genre, in this case the Yakuza film (Americans, think spaghetti western, or maybe spaghetti western as directed by Sam Peckinpah).
As usual, the gangs are at war in Shinjuku. Boss Anjo, who heads the Anjo gang, disappears without a trace one night, despite guards being right outside the door. His right-hand man, Kakihara (Tadanobu Asano), is bent on finding his kidnapper. It's probably not a spoiler, given the film's title, to mention that that would be the mysterious Ichi the Killer. Kakihara's search takes him through the nastiest parts of the Shinjuku underworld, but he keeps getting closer. Or so he thinks.
Despite Ichi being named in the film's title (and, when it comes right down to it, being the single most interesting hit man to find his way to celluloid in decades), Kakihara is the film's star. Kakihara is a sadomasochist without parallel, or so he thinks until he starts hearing about Ichi. His obsession grows with the idea that Ichi may be able to give Kakihara the kind of death he craves (a violent, painful one, naturally). As seems to happen in even the most mediocre Japanese films, American audiences are likely to be surprised by the depth of storyline to be found here and the honesty of the emotions involved. Assuming, of course, they can get beyond the violence. Those who have seen Audition probably have a basic idea of what to expect. But the violence in Audition was confined to the last fifteen minutes, whereas it permeates every bloody second of Ichi's two-hours-plus. It has the same grimly comedic feel as does the violence in, say, Kei Fujiwara's film Organ, simply because it's so over the top that any nod to realism goes out the door early on. (Kakihara holding up a string of guts by a pen and making admiring comments as to Ichi's technique will probably have the reader snickering and squirming at the same time.)
All of which is well and good, and Ichi the Killer is a fine way to kill two hours. But it doesn't have the same ""wow"" factor as did Miike's earlier Audition, nor, say, the films of Hideo Nakata. So expect a lot of good, gory fun, but don't expect to think too much about it afterwards. *** ",1077753600,,2477,4.747099767981439
3704903,4,B0009S2SV2,"This is a story about Kakihara, a member of the Yakuza, searching for the boss he so dearly loves, and a pure masochist, in spite of what the film's initial scenes may lead you to believe. Kakihara posseses meaning, flamboyance, and confidence, not so much desiring to die in the suicidal sense, but to live greatly and experience the ultimate joy and ecstacy of death. Ichi is his complete polar opposite. He has been conditioned and trained to kill, and to kill without mercy. Ichi is sexually aroused by murder--the movie's title emerges from his semen after he watches a beating and rape, and thus, he is a pure sadist. He realizes, at the most crucial point, that people do want to be killed because they do not want to be killed--precisely Kakihara's mind. But Ichi is like a little boy, innocent and unable to act against his brain-washing. And it is Kakihara searching for his missing Yakuza boss through torture and mutilation, and Ichi despondently slaughtering Kakihara's followers that leads them to ultimately meet, but neither are in control of their selves. The movie can be seen in varying lights, from social commentary to psychoanalysis, but it never explains most of the questions it raises, the most important being why, both the plot and the film itself. The dialogue and humour are both incredible, but there needs to be some sort of justification for the level of violence and gore. A Quentin Tarantino film is enough blood to serve as social commentary, but Ichi the Killer seems excessive. Yet, I do have to say...I cannot describe the movie, you must see it. And after you see it, you will want to show everyone else.",1077667200,,1643,4.768421052631579
3704904,5,B0009S2SV2,"I have seen many extreme and violent films over the years and the problem with this, is that it's very easy to become somewhat jaded and too demanding of onscreen mayhem. Most American films these days just aren't that shocking, so it's being left to our Asian cousins to supply the goods. Even so and despite the film's and Director's reputation, I wasn't expecting too much from this one.
Boy, was I wrong! Firstly, let me say that to do the film justice you do need to see the full uncut version (the UK R2 is missing over 3mins and thus I had to import yet again). The film itself is both horrifically violent and beautifully made - it is simply a highly entertaining and disturbing movie.
The levels of violence achieved are frankly awesome and yet its mixed very cleverly with darkly black humour. There are several scenes which almost had me wincing, including the infamous torture sequence and 'nipple slicing' scene, which were honestly a breath of fresh air since the Director did not pull any punches at all - you go into this expecting to be taken to the edge and you are.
Oddly, the only thing I will give away about this movie is the fact that Ichi the Killer is NOT the blonde guy with the mouth clips that you see on all the posters. This was quite a suprise to me, but actually heightened the film's effect.
The effects are simply incredible and whilst some of the violence may be far beyond most tastes, for those feeling a little war weary having enjoyed the more transgressive Italian and Asian flicks of the past, you won't be disappointed.
Hats off to the Director for pulling off what could have been very easily a real mess, but instead is a work of vision, violence and knowing. If you can go beyond some of the more extreme visceral shocks in store, you will find a film that is compelling, cleverly written and well acted - you cannot imagine anyone else playing these characters (especially the two leads; Kakihara and Ichi are played with precise relish).
Not for all tastes but any regard, but for once a film both refreshingly violent and deserved of it's increasing reputation. It isn't a one-stop gory horror, it's far more.
I have seen the future of violence and it is 'Ichi the Killer'!",1077321600,,2221,4.541147132169576
3704905,5,B0009S2SV2,"WOW! Takashi Miike is a man that has interested me lately because he is such a HUGE topic of interest and discussion in movies and movie making in general. It's hard for me to find any of his films but when I seen a copy of Ichi The Killer I picked it up without any hesitation at all and I do not regret it. This movie will make you cringe, laugh, and just shock you out of your seat wondering what the heck is going on! Now I didn't take this movie seriously but if YOU are than I think it will give a less positive effect. I'm gonna go watch it again now!",1076803200,,558,3.9035087719298245
3704906,4,B0009S2SV2,"Ichi the killer is one of the latest offerings from acclaimed cult director Takashi Miike of ""Audition"" and ""Dead or Alive"" fame.  It is an exploration of the seedy underworld of Yakuza gangs and street violence in Tokyo.  More specifically, the film focuses on the torture devices and off-the-wall techniques the Yakuza famously employ to extract information that is of use to them. Jijii (played by Tetsuo director Shinya Tsukamato) is a former Yakuza gang member who seeks revenge against some of the Yakuza who he feels wronged him.  He doesn't kill the Yakuza by himself but uses his hypnotist powers to control the mind and make a killer out of ""Ichi"", a young tortured soul.  One of the people Ichi slays is a sadistic yakuza boss who has a reputation of beating up and mistreating prostitutes.  Kakishara (the man who's face is on the cover) wants revenge for the murder of his boss and will stop at nothing to get his hands on Ichi.
The Miike staples are all here; a high body count, scenes of torture and misoginy and lots of dark humor.  The biggest strength of this film is the characters.  Although all are an unlikeable bunch, they are fascinating nonetheless especially Kakishara who looks like he came straight out of a manga comic book.  His face is scarred with 4 deep cuts, 2 on each cheekbones, 1 on his forehead and 1 across his chin.  When he smokes cigarettes he is able to blow the smoke out of those cuts!  This guy is an extreme sadochist who's so hardcore that he will slash his own tongue in front of his gang members just to prove his mettle and then calmly answer his cell phone afterwards and who invites others to punch him in the face because he relishes the pain.  With Kakishara Miike truly has created a cult figure for the ages within Japanese cinema.
Being an off-kilter Japanese flick this scores quite high in the weirdness and odd humor departments.  In one scene a cop sniffs a dead woman's crotch in hopes that the scent will lead him to her killer (!).  We have a character named Karen whose speech keeps alternating between Japanese and English but no one seems to notice...  And then of course there's Ichi the feared killer a grown man who constantly breaks down crying like a baby after killing people.
Anyone seeking a high-octane Asian actioner might be disappointed.  Battle Royale this is certainly not.  The film tends to drag on in between scenes of action and torture.  I found the film to be quite hard to stomach at times with its constant scenes of woman-beating and rape and torture.  The fact that the movie seems to try to hide under the veil of extremity and cartoonish violence did not lessen my unease at seeing such things.  Although I generally dislike sadistic violence I do love gore but again I found myself disappointed in this department.  When Ichi slashes people in half with the knife under the sole of his boot it so looks to be a CGI that it is laughable.  There is also a scene where Ichi kills a dozen or so Yakuza members in a small room but it's somewhat concealed, all the viewer really sees are the guts flying out of the room but not the action itself.  I found this strange because this is a movie with a very violent nature but in some cases like these it seemed to avoid any opportunities to show off lots of gore.
Heaps of praise has been lavished on this film since its inaugural release and though I found Ichi the Killer to be worthwhile viewing I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's Miike's best work or that it's anywhere close to being the goriest or most violent film ever, as its reputation may lead some to believe.  When all is said and done it is however an entertaining and zany bloodbath, of which the japanese have been producing lots of in recent years.",1076630400,,3758,4.5022091310751104
3704907,5,B0009S2SV2,"Miike is a filmmaker capable of transfiguring your concept of what film can be.  See this film as soon as you get the chance, but only if you have a strong gut.  The DVD has a director's commentary and some trailers.",1076457600,,216,4.2439024390243905
3704908,5,B0009S2SV2,"Takashi Miike is, by far, the most original and visionary director to come along in years. Following in the footsteps of Cronenberg and Lynch, Miike takes regular, real-world situations and spins them on their head, churning out surreal, fantasmagorical films that transcend genres and affect every viewer in one way or another.
Ichi The Killer might be the best example of Miike's work so far. Here he combines sweeping, amusingly erratic camera angles and effects with a plot that involves gangs, yakuza killers, crooked cops, and Ichi, a timid man who may be the most violent killer to ever splatter the screen.
I could go on for pages, but in the end Ichi The Killer must be seen to be believed. If you're looking for a challenge to your distended outlook on modern cinema, Takashi Miike and Ichi The Killer are it.",1075766400,,819,4.774647887323944

and the story itself unfolds rather slowly. in short this is a gorey bore.",1074902400,,602,4.854368932038835
3704910,5,B0009S2SV2,"After watching Takashi Miike's powerful ""Audition,"" I thought following up with ""Ichi the Killer"" an excellent idea. I don't see much of a comparison between the two films unless you wish to look at the disturbing scenes of gory violence and the fact that ""Audition"" has more of a social message than this gore extravaganza. I have come away with the impression that Miike is a brilliant filmmaker capable of forcing extreme reactions from his viewers. Hollywood should take note of this guy and bring him over here for a project or two. But doing so probably wouldn't work out; Miike's warped visions would send American censors scrambling for a sedative, and most mainstream viewers would recoil from the graphic nature of this director's films. A word of warning for those thinking of indulging in ""Ichi the Killer"": the movie is loaded with sadism, gore, black comedy, and all around unpleasantness. It's as though this movie turns upside down everything we associate with cleanness and decency. It's a tough watch, even for a gore fan like me, so prepare thoroughly--how, I cannot really tell you because I do not know--before diving in. Good luck.
""Ichi the Killer"" is based on a ""manga,"" a Japanese comic strip of a type often embodying grotesque images and disturbing themes. The film follows several Yakuza gangs as they do what they do best: murder, torture, plot, and generally cause lots of unpleasantness. I am unfamiliar with the structure of the Yakuza, but I gathered from the film that there are numerous gangs (or families, as the mafia would say) each headed up by a boss. These bosses then report to a committee composed of other gang leaders and a sort of ""boss of bosses""--played here by a wheezy little runt who pops up to mediate disputes every now and again--designed to keep everything from getting out of hand. When an anonymous killer named Ichi takes down a yakuza leader, the boss's underlings, including a bleach blond thug by the name of Kakihara, seek revenge. At first, Kakihara thinks rival groups had something to do with the disappearance, so he kidnaps some thugs and tortures them in an effort to get information. These gruesome antics go so far beyond the pale that the yakuza overlords send Kakihara and his fellow gang members into exile. Instead of putting an end to the out of control violence, this judgment only encourages Kakihara to even more extreme acts of nastiness. It turns out that this blond goon worshipped his boss because the leader possessed the ability to fulfill Kakihara's S&M cravings. This is sick stuff, to be sure, but it only gets worse as the movie progresses.
Kakihara seeks out Ichi to avenge the boss but also to challenge the enigmatic assassin to a showdown. We soon learn Ichi is far from the icy killer we have come to expect. He's actually a meek sort who witnessed a brutal incident as a child and has since become a victim to his own guilt. A guy named Jiji expertly manipulates Ichi's psychological problems in order to carry out assassinations. All Jiji needs to do is tell his friend that certain people were involved in Ichi's childhood trauma and mayhem rapidly ensues. Clad in a black suit bristling with razor sharp blades, Ichi can turn a room full of people into sushi in about thirty seconds. After the murders take place, he often sinks into a weeping, cringing depression over what he has wrought. Jiji, completely indifferent to his friend's remorse, always has a few more targets lined up for the slaughter. Women, children, and men: all are fair game when Ichi goes on a rampage. As the movie progresses, and as Kakihara comes closer to his final showdown with the hyper violent Ichi, Miike throws in enough plot twists and turns to keep the viewer constantly guessing as to character motivations and the very nature of the reality these people move in.
I am guessing I missed out on a ton of inside jokes and cultural references, probably because I do not speak the language, am not Japanese, and do not live in that country. I have never even seen, let alone read, a manga comic strip. Fortunately, Miike's film boasts plenty of black humor and gory violence to the point that being non-Japanese makes little difference in understanding the picture. You don't have to be an expert on Japanese cinema to laugh at Jiji's ""muscular"" transformation or the scenes where Kakihara expresses his disappointment at Ichi's subservience when the two finally meet (Kakihara actually attempts to pick his foe up in order to get him to fight! Funny!). And you definitely don't need any inside knowledge to gape at the violence. This is an insanely sick film packed to the rafters with bloodshed and carnage. My mouth dropped open, and stayed that way, when Kakihara administered a hot oil ""bath"" to a particularly close-mouthed gangster.
Gorehounds the world over will flock to ""Ichi the Killer."" While you will need an iron stomach to get through this one, the film goes to great lengths to prove this is all cartoonish fantasy. I quit taking the whole thing seriously after the tongue scene, when Kakihara said, ""It will get better if I keep talking,"" and then spoke normally in the following scene. I took this as a wink-wink, nudge-nudge from Miike, a message to the viewer that one should not take the film to heart. As far as the DVD goes, I think it should go without saying that watching the unrated edition is the way to go. If you really want to watch a movie like this one, why waste time and money fiddling around with a cut version?",1074124800,,5526,4.757291666666666
3704911,4,B0009S2SV2,"After seeing the first Dead or Alive Movie, i knew i just had to see Ichi the Killer (or maybe because on the DoA DVD Interview, Miike Highly recommends it.) Being familiar with Miike, i knew what to expect, which was a bit of the old ultra violence, to quote a classic. this film is extremely violent, and what makes it more shocking is that most of it is pointless. but at the same time the violence is handled in an extremely over the top way that you just have to laugh(unlike Gaspar Noe's Irreversible, which is disturbingly realistic) The movie is filled with so many bizarre and (for me) beautiful images that it was hard not to enjoy it. Kakihara,the peroxide blonde on the DVD's cover is the most interesting character, and when he's not in the scene, i miss him (althogh he did make me flinch in the torture scene). to concentrate on the story or the plot would be churlish, if you view this just for the fun of it, you'll enjoy it. there are many problems with this film though. for one thing, after such a brilliant opening, Miike's pace flags with the midsection of the film. there are too many unnecessary scenes of the characters just talking, but i guess you need those type of scenes to relax after the violence. of course, many of the characters are underwritten(like many of Miike's films, it was shot very quickly) but the actors give good performances, nonetheless. Notable mentions are Asano(who plays Kakihara), Tsukamoto(my favorite Japanese director), Sabu and the gorgeous Alien Sun. The movie is perverse, immoral, whatever but i think that we should have realized by now that Miike has always been out to offend.
the DVD transfer is alright, but not as excellent as Kino's transfer of DoA. there are some blemishes here and there but not really noticeable on a normal TV but very evident on a Widescreen TV.The colors are really amazing in this movie, so it's a shame they couldn't do a better job of transfering. The sound, on the other hand, is excellent(make sure you go to the set up before you play this movie or you'll end up watching the English dubbed version! which actually make the movie feel more surreal.) the extras are scant, just a photo gallery and 4 trailers of other Japanese movies, the most interesting of which is Miike's Visitor Q. there is a slightly informative commentary by Miike and the Manga aritst Hideo Yamamoto, who compare their methods and tell some facts about the actors(a highlight is when it revealed whose semen it is used for the title sequence)  japanese filmmaking in general and of course, their (delight?) in violence.
Ichi is not a masterpiece, but definitely demands to be seen (if you can take the violence that is).
by the way, if you're wondering what the 1 in the movie stands for, it's not because Ichi will be having a part 2 or 3(well, who knows) but really, Ichi in Japanese actually means 1. so now you know.",1072137600,,2891,4.613592233009709
3704912,5,B0009S2SV2,"The other reviews posted here seem to sum up pretty well my feelings about Ichi.  For those of you who have NOT seen this yet,  don't read too much into the reviews that didn't rate it well.  Granted there are only a few people who rated Ichi with three stars or less - but based on those reviews it sounds like they didn't really 'get' the movie anyway.  First of all, the movie is based on a manga, so the cartoony effects are there for a reason.  Secondly, it IS a difficult movie to follow.  There are a lot of characters to keep track of and a lot of action - this is not a movie you want to watch if you can't dedicate your full attention to it.  I will admit that I didn't quite make total sense of the plot until after the movie had ended and I started mulling it over.  Then all of a sudden scenes that didn't make sense before started coming together - and I have to say it's really well done!  It's a movie that makes you think - Miike doesn't just hand you a cute little story all neatly outlined in chapters.  He presents you with a lot of information and how you choose to process it is up to you.  If you're open-minded and looking for something a little out of the ordinary, watch Ichi The Killer while keeping these things in mind.  You'll love it!!",1071792000,,1266,4.122448979591836
3704913,2,B0009S2SV2,"First, an apologies.  I don't own the DVD.  I just saw this with a friend, so I have nothing to say about it technically, special features wise, etc...  Second, my rating would be 2.5 stars, it just wasn't a selectable option.  Ok, here goes:
Ichi the Killer essentially follows two opposing, incredibly violent characters.  Jiji is pulling the puppet strings of one, but he's not nearly so important a character thematically.
The title character, Ichi, is tightly wound up in hazy memories of being bullied and likely feelings of sexual inadequacy, and can't cut through the fog.  Unable to control emotions himself, he is manipulated by Jiji to act as a (highly effective) slice'em dice'em style murderer.  The opposing character, Kakihara is overly cool, full of cynicism and torture of others and masochism are all that gets him engaged.  You get the feeling he's unsatisfied, though, and these just break the boredom.  He's looking for the next thrill... Ichi.
This could be a setup to a masterpiece, perhaps something on violence's emptiness and consuming power?  Well, it isn't anything like that, folks.  What's missing of course, is a character we can take a personal interest in.  I wrote the next two paragraphs a mental accounting of the way to change the characters to fit my ""allegory on violence"", but really any of the changes would have helped the movie, even if they did not go remotely so far as making this my movie.
Ichi is made too nice, and far too pathetic... the transformation into crazed killer doesn't work, it's too cartoonish.  He and the movie would be more interesting and disturbing if undercurrents of the violent temper came out at times other than when he starting killing, if at some level or some of the time, he wasn't really fooled, and you could watch him killing without laughing because of how fake and stupid it all looked.  If this movie took you from a plausible, somewhat sympathetic character to a bloody killer, it would be truly great.  Instead, it takes you from an implausibly pathetic character to a demented superhero.  At the very least, please loose the costume!
They give Kakihara more viscerally intense stuff, (a particular torture scene certainly comes to mind) but don't do enough with his character either, preferring to concentrate on how cool he is with his slit cheeks and killer wardrobe.  Exactly how and when did he get to be so messed up?  If asked, it might have given the film some depth.  It wasn't, at all.  That's a terrible shame.
Stripped of interesting, developed characters, the movie becomes largely a comedic splatter film with a few sideshows.  It's watchable with that as the expectectation, but then the genuinely disturbing violence (which IMHO isn't the slice-dice, but the torture, and beatings/rape) is out of place to me.
They had a great chance here to make the movie I was thinking of and they didn't even come close... argh!",1071532800,,2915,4.8603238866396765
3704914,3,B0009S2SV2,"First and foremost it should be noted that this isn't your average Yakuza flick (although than again, in modern japanese film what is?). At first I found the story/plot of this film somewhat hard to follow, and even up to the end I had several questions as to the motives of some of the characters, namely Jijii and why he is so hell bent on killing the yakuza (which is never explained). There are MANY scenes that are just down right strange and left me going ""WTF?!"" but they were nonetheless interesting and in most cases played in with the plot.
One of my main pet peeves with this film though, was the director's use of multiple languages. One of the characters (who was apparently Chinese), would occasionally speak in English and mandarin to the other Japanese characters and strangely, they would respond in Japanese as if it's nothing out of the norm (and they understood it perfectly). I found this to be very awkward, and quite frankly stupid. The director (Miike) is known for this and has used this style of communication in some of his other films (Dead or Alive 2-3). I'm not sure what this is supposed to symbolize, but it's very corny to say the least....
Aside from the above mentioned, the film has quite an interesting plot (albeit a strange one) about an S&M Yakuza who seeks revenge for the killing of his boss and on the way encounters some interesting/silly/corny characters. It's a good film, but I would only recommend it to people interested in Japan/Yakuza/Anime etc. People who are not particulary interested with Japan would probably find this movie to be to strange to watch.

While not everyone will like it, It is definitly one I reccomend for all.",1070668800,,355,4.014084507042254
3704916,5,B0009S2SV2,"I am not going to say anymore about Ichi the Killer other than you need to see it (if you find foreign cinema to be at least entertaining if not mentally engaging). I am in total agreement with the person who wrote the latest review (overview?) of Miikes work. It seems to me that if you cant find Miikes films to be the least bit fun than how could you possibly appreciate Francos, Rollins, or Arrabals (just to name a few directors) more personal filmmaking. You see (and NONE of you can disagree with me) Miike in general is not a personal filmmaker (there is one exception which I will mention later). He makes his films on the basis that the audience wants to be entertained and on that premise he delivers. So to me it seems to be a total and absolute paradox that some of you could literally watch ANY film and actually derive any entertainment from it what so ever if you cant through Miike. Esotericism,iconoclasm,political and all other forms of more philosophical and idealized filmmaking would be based far too much in psychology rather than in the viscerality of violence and images for you to comprehend let alone enjoy, so where is the middle ground for you? Basically, what im trying to say is that Miike makes his films  with the help of the rudimentary building block of all movies and does it the best of any director. And if you cant see that in his repertoire please don't try to see it in any films that deal with a subject matter that is even the least bit profound in its implications. If you can watch, lets say Fudoh, and see and respect it for what it is than there probably won't be any tribulations to you watching Viva la Muerte or a film of higher meaning. But as is very obvious to me most of you are either totally arrogant or backwards in the way you view not only Miikes films but really the essence of a single image of any movie flittering across the screen. Watch it for what it is, if theres symbolism interpret it to the best of your ability, if its a film that at its core is just trying to entertain like Miikes films, than just be entertained and if you cant than turn it off. I am so unbelievably tired of hearing how some of you watch his films to the end and then try to justify why hes  not a ""good"" filmmaker (hey man if you don't like it don't watch it, just save your breath). What is a good filmmaker to you? Is martin scorsese good, maybe. Was he really being anything but inept when he rehashed the exact same idea with three of his films(casino, goodfellas, and the godfather) without any attempt at visualisation. Absolutely not. Miike might use simplistic and similar plots for most of his yakuza films but, jesus, at least he doesnt use dead pan direction. Its adrenaline, its violence, its against formality and yes contary to some it IS entertaining. I would really like to hear what some of you visagal fans of Miike have to say about my little essay. Do you agree with me that Miike is an across-the-board director who really shouldnt have limits to who finds his films worth while or is he a filmmaker that only a select few can truly appreciate? Hopefully a realisation will occur among some of you that his work is the closest you're going to get to watching a movie that isn't concerned with a higher meaning or of something other than being just unforgettably entertaining. And when this does happen maybe you will be able to start viewing this and all films with less of a closed mind and be more susceptible to the power of what is, not what could have been. I might as well mention that Miikes film Audition does have a sociological comment behind it which seems to pertain to the male/female parallel in Japan. Whether this was intentional or not I can not say. But it is evidence that Miike is a very acclimatable filmmaker who can surely branch off into different genres and types of filmmaking if necessary. But I personally encourage him to keep at what hes doing. ""When you put the emphasis on the images of a movie there is no boundary to what can be expressed"", that came from the mans own mouth. I advise you to watch his films with that in mind or don't watch them at all. P.S. I would really like you guys who disagree with one or more aspects of my article to write a review and list what you think about my perception (hell I might be pretentious but you and I both know Im right). Give me your best shot turkeys! Oh yeah, just in case you haven't realised, this text that I wrote isn't so much of an introspective or informative view on miike (thats not what I intended) as it is a nice big neon lit F U in bold face letters to all you popos who think miike is either convuluted or contrived, what a joke. The goal of this text is  to get as many of you to disagree with me as possible. So start racking them up. Lets see how many of you NEED to approach Miike with trepidation.",1069891200,,4861,4.3454345434543455
3704917,5,B0009S2SV2,"Ichi The Killer is another example of the level of expertise at which Japanese film makers are creating at in the new millennium.  Ichi contains some of the most vivid scenes of violence ever put down on film, and frames them in such a stylized manner that you are completely pulled into their hardcore-ness.  Scenes are driven by fascinating characters that live in a world where splitting foes down the middle, accidentally opening jugulars, and disfiguring suspected murderers with boiling oil are all everyday occurrences.
 Takashi Miike has once again created a film whose method of style is totally and completely enveloping, leaving any viewer dumbfounded, frozen in her tracks.  If you ever seen any of Takashi-sama's films, and found yourself enjoying his unique visual stylings, you will love Ichi The Killer.  If you have enjoyed someone ""bleed-out"" through an opened jugular, whether it was animated or in a live action film, you will love Ichi the Killer.  If you breathe, you will love this movie.  I promise anyone out there who sees at least one Takashi Miike film, will fall in love with his style.",1069459200,,1115,4.962365591397849
3704918,5,B0009S2SV2,"So incredibly violent. The violence goes from insane, almost cartoon-like excesses, to slow, sadistic, ber-realistic torture. And if this isn't enough for you, the sexual undercurrents are strong, and the psychological traumas of the main characters ensures a good portion of mind-violence as well.
Yet it is so extremely well made. The direction is smart and tough, and the actors are hamming it up beautifully, even for Japanese actors.
Fabulous entertainment if you can take it. Not a date movie.",1069113600,,499,5.25
3704919,5,B0009S2SV2,As most fans know takashi miike is one of the most ground breakingly visual directors working today. few directors have his eye for camera placement and movement in order to convey subtlety and grace (audition) or a hyper kinetic rapidity (dead or alive). he is more of a visualist than anything else although his films do generally have an underlying social context to them which does show him to be an adept storyteller. it irritates me that there are those few who watch his films for the violence rather than for what his films are truly unique for which for anyone with half a brain cell knows is the aestheticism of the cinematography. i have yet to see ichi the killer but from what ive heard about it it sounds like it could quite possibly be miikes crowning achievement with some of the most stunning visual artistry of any of his previous films. hopefully with the upcoming region 1 release some of his supposed fans will be able to find a new appreciation for his work.always remember a picture is worth a thousand words.,1066953600,,1032,4.614130434782608
3704920,5,B0009S2SV2,"Obviously I haven't seen the U.S. release of this, but as an owner of a Region 3 DVD player I was able to see the version already out in Japan.
While the movie's plot isn't exactly strong, it makes up for it in gory goodness! Just go into this knowing what you're getting. You'll see a person's hand get nearly bitten off, someone slashed in half, a man cut out his own tongue, and that isn't even the half of it.
Enjoy!",1065225600,,420,4.134146341463414
3704921,5,B0009S2SV2,"This guy summed it up perfectly.
A strong contender for the sickest movie of all time, Ichi The Killer exhibits Miike Takashi's freewheeling visual imagination nonetheless. It's an ultraviolent revenge movie based on a Manga cartoon in which a sinister hypnotist manipulates the timid but unstable Ichi to dispatch various mobsters in horrifically violent fashion by invoking false memories of witnessing a rape. His ultimate target is a mutilated Yakuza played by the excellent Asano Tadanobu, sadistic and masochistic in equal measures, inciting boss and girlfriend to beat him savagely and exacting horribly inventive torture techniques on his enemies. At one stage, when he overdoes it and angers his bosses, he volunteers a ""sincere apology"" and cuts out his own tongue. He claims everyone is part sadist, part masochist and the director explores this theme with disturbing enthusiasm. This could do the job very nicely as the ""therapy"" film in A Clockwork Orange.

If they release the uncut version in r1 i'll be buying it in a heartbeat. Takashi miike is a visionary filmaker unafraid to push the boudaries in a dark tounge in cheek kind of way. He reminds me of an early paul verhoeven in this way. His cinematic style can also be quite beautiful to. Hell i love the guy,he's my new mentor and role model hehe. If you like your movies dark comic style ah la ""Man bites dog"" then you must have this movie in your collection. Also check out miike's other great movies ""Visitor q"" and ""Dead or alive"" are a couple you might want to look out for. Just don't watch them with grandma if you ever want her to talk to you again hehe.",1062806400,,838,4.147239263803681

8322857,5,B0009S2SV2,"For many people, this movie will be nothing more than an endurance test, but for a person who's not easily offended and appreciates insane cinema, ""Ichi the Killer"" is a lot of bloody fun. Takashi Miike's entire filmography is pretty much composed of ultra-violent, over the top films, and this one is one of his best known films for a reason. The scenes of gore will make anyone cringe. The violence is very imaginative, you have to give it that. There were scenes of violence and torture so shocking, even I was taken aback and couldn't resist cringing. Despite it being extremely graphic, it's done very well and makes sense in the context of it's already wacky story and tone.

8322860,1,B0009S2SV2,"I have watched a lot of strange films over the years. This is one that I kept hearing about time and time again. Finally I sat down to watch it and see what all the cult following was about. I really just don't get it. Below are pros and cons.

Pros
+Not afraid to be exploitation
+Interesting Character (guy with the scars)

Cons
-all over the place plot
-cheap CGI gore
-way too long of a film for what it is
-boring

Im not here to hate, I know a lot of people enjoy this film but I just must be missing the mark. Cant recommended this movie to anyone. I really don't know who the audience for something like this even would be.....The gore isn't good enough for Gore hounds. The plot isn't good enough for people into deep plots. And the exploitation isn't enough to keep anyone from getting bored to death. Watch Tokyo Gore Police instead.",1525132800,,844,4.29559748427673

8322862,5,B0009S2SV2,"One of the most intriguing and immersive films I've ever seen. There are so many facets to explore.
I originally bought this DvD from a Blockbuster back around 2003 (having never heard of it) and was turned off by what I saw. However, the second viewing caused me to later become a huge Takashi Miike fan. I've rewatched that DvD so many times that I wore it out; and, not to sound too cliche' but, every time I watched it I found another avenue to explore.

This surely is not your average film. I'd rank it a masterpiece.",1524182400,,523,4.336734693877551
8322863,4,B0009S2SV2,Definitely an experience. Kind of speechless in a good way. Try it on!,1524182400,,70,4.461538461538462
8322864,4,B0009S2SV2,"Kakihara, a notoriously sadistic yakuza enforcer, sets out to find out who killed his boss Anjo. His journey leads him to heading his gang, alienating the rest of the yakuza, and following just behind Ichi, an enigmatic killer who seems like Kakihara's worthy adversary. He has no idea that Ichi himself is a brainwashed, manipulated manchild and the people pulling his strings have plans for Kakihara.

Takashi Miike's more famous movies are known for being offputting, odd, and extreme. Ichi the Killer is no different, starting off with a brutal scene that lays out what's in store for the viewer and challenging them to continue. The non-sexual violence in this film has a cartoonish element that covers most of them with blood and gore and brings comedy with its over the top, campy nature. We see the aftermath of Ichi's encounter with members of Anjo's gang with viscera coating the entire room and even a face sliding down the wall.

These scenes contrast greatly with the sexual violence directed towards the sex workers of this world. The abuse and assaults they experience at the hands of powerful men is truly horrible to watch and realistically portrayed. They have no power or agency in this underground world with no hope to escape the abuse. One of the most harrowing scenes is when Sailor, with an already beaten face, is brutalized by her pimp and saved by Ichi. He offers to beat and rape her instead, causing her to laugh at the horror of it and attack him in desperation. Even Karen, the woman with the most agency, tries to manipulate Ichi and meets the same end as so many other women in this film. The seriousness of these scenes gives them much more gravity and shows the plight of these women.

The two main characters of this film also contrast in interesting ways. Kakihara is a sadomasochist who will do anything for Anjo, his boss. This role could have been very stereotypically acted, but Tadanobu Asano plays him with such a nonchalance. He has moments where he laughs at others pain like when poring whatever over a man suspended with hooks, but a lot of his moments are when he takes in crazy scenes without so much as a shrug. One scene in particular is made hilarious because of his reaction compared with everyone else's reaction. Kakihara tortures an innocent man and cuts off his tongue in penance, handing it to the yakuza bosses. They freak out and try to get away from it and then Kakihara mumbles that he's taking over Anjo's gang, answers a phonecall, and then leaves while they are still reeling as if they don't matter. These moments are as iconic as the characters colorful outfits and facial scars.

Ichi, on the other hand, is the most annoying character by far. He is aroused by violence towards women and violence in general. An old man Jijii has brainwashed him to believe he's related to people or had experiences to motivate him to kill Anjo and his gang one by one. However, Ichi is incredibly unstable. He could slice a crowd of people into ribbons in seconds or he could just stand and cry instead, allowing a child to kick him, because he's being hypnotized and manipulated by someone else. Kakihara sees the aftermath of his attacks and imagines an epic battle with a worthy adversary. He's been bored and nothing seems to challenge him anymore, so he chases after Ichi as if it's a game. To me, Ichi is the lowest of the low and I hate everything about him. However, his character challenges the viewer to see why they consume media like this film and if they are like Ichi themselves.

Ichi the Killer is a subversive film that is hard to watch at many moments. The off the wall weird or gory moments contrast with the more serious, harrowing scenes of sexual violence to make a unique cinematic experience. I watched this in 4k with the director's cut recently. One or two plot holes were filled, but it was much the same. Hearing a large crowd react to the film and seeing it on the big screen was fun. I would recommend this film if you already like films like it. I don't see it talked about as much as Audition and I find it a more watchable movie.",1524096000,,4114,4.599455040871935
8322865,5,B0009S2SV2,"This movie is very disturbing, but it is meant to be. It is a visceral criticism of violence and men and the cyclebetween the two and women and media. Don't watch it if you barf easily, and please watch it with comprehension of the subtleties. I almost think this movie is a critique of every Quentin Tarantino movie that has been made.",1523232000,,336,4.435483870967742
8322866,5,B0009S2SV2,"I don't really know how to sum up the life-changing moment that you have after watching this film for the first time all-the-way through. It's not for the easily offended, or honestly anyone that gets offended by fiction in general, but dear god is this film beyond twisted and intense. It somehow sits in a category of being a ""hipster"" film as much as it is a torture porn, but not in the horrendous way that say ""I Spit On Your Grave"" or ""Saw"" would be considered to be. It's immaculate in its insanity and unique beyond almost any other film before it. It's grotesque as it is beautiful, and intriguing and as it is shocking. It's a must see film for fans of horror, anime, eastern crime cinema, and just unsettling content in general. Do not watch this at a party or around family by any means, it's just too much for most to handle. I've seen people literally get into arguments while watching Ichi because of the taboo subject material and the judgments/assumptions that some will make if you present this film to them. It's an upsetting and intriguing experience unlike any other piece of art before it.

So let me just say this, the way I describe Ichi The Killer to people haven't seen it is as so....
""If you want to see a film with everything that is terrible or horrible in the world all rolled up into one giant ball then Ichi is a must watch."" It has torture, masturbation, extreme gore, extreme sexual assault, women being brutally beaten, hard-drug use, child death, gun violence, people being burnt, stabbed, beaten, abusive relationships...it just covers all the bases of everything that is horrible and I applaud it for being so abrasive and different than anything else out there.",1522800000,,1701,4.632450331125828
