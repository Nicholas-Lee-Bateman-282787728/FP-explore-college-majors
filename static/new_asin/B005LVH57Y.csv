8478620,3,B005LVH57Y,"the lawsuit(s) of TP,RN,RZ v Brad M Carlson!
Pete Comita was LIVE in this back in 1981 from the
Chicago waterfront w/ a lineup of;pc/rn/rz/bec. Not
sure what Pete was on, but he sure had plenty of
energy, the little fuzz ball! Just two questions; isn't
Peterson/Nielsen/Zander being sued by Bun E, Dave
Frey for releasing the 'I Want You For Christmas'
Special Olympics lp/video w/out Bun E when he was
supposed to be in the process?! Then why (1)
If this was filmed in '81 does it have TP on the cover?
When is Pete gonna join the lawsuit? And, (2) Since
this came out in 2012, isn't that more fuel for the fire
for Bun E's lawsuit?!",1385769600,,634,4.336134453781512
8478621,2,B005LVH57Y,"....and, yeah, I bought it. Mostly out of curiosity, as I have an extensive CT video collection (early years stuff), to the point where I'm very aware of what shows were filmed/recorded back then, and I was pretty certain what this would be.

I was right....it's a sub-par quality bootleg of the exact same show you can get an official release of on CT's ""BUDOKAN!"" box set (it comes with 3 CDs & 1 DVD).

The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is that in the footage on this DVD, the track order has been restored to it's original order (the legitimate release, for some idiotic reason, cuts 2 songs right out of the concert and adds them on, out of order, as ""bonus clips""; this bootleg has them reinstated in their proper set-list order). As for the overall quality of this bootleg....well, let's just say that I was quite surprised that it WASN'T a DVD-R/home-burned disc after seeing the poor quality. The video is like a second or third generation VHS tape that has been played waaaayyyyy too many times.

The only reason to buy this is if you are a mega-mega-mega-CT-completist with unlimited income to burn. Actually, scratch that advice. The (remastered) footage has been released by the band; why not buy the legit version? It looks and sounds miles better.

Don't get suckered in by this ""new"" release.",1326067200,11,1323,4.617021276595745
8478622,1,B005LVH57Y,"I have been a big Cheap Trick fan since their first single hit the airwaves and have seen them 5 times in concert over the last 30+ years. When their Budokan LP was released in Japan and not here I hunted for a long time to secure an import of the LP (no internet to shop worldwide back then). Naturally when I saw this DVD coming out that is supposed to be the Budokan concert, and at a great price, I preordered it. The only good thing I can say about this DVD is it's great to see the guys young again with all their raw energy. Now the bad: the video itself is terrible. It's grainy and shows no detail. For those of you who remember VHS tapes, this looks like a second generation copy of a VHS tape. Also, even by 1978 standards, whoever shot this was very amateurish. All you get are a bunch of close up head shots, weird angles, etc. Looks like it was shot with a handheld camera by an audience member. The audio choices are 2 channel stereo, Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1. I cycled through all three several times and there is very little difference but the DTS setting did seem to sound the best of the three. Also for some strange reason during track 2, ""Come On, Come On"", the video jumps like a big chunk of the middle was cut out. The song starts, then you get the jump and the song ends fairly quickly. There was also a big audio dropout in one of the tracks.

I can only recommend this DVD to die hard Cheap Trick fans who have to have everything. If you really want a Cheap Trick DVD, there are better choices out there.",1318896000,10,1530,4.134228187919463
8478623,2,B005LVH57Y,"As another reviewer correctly pointed out,
this is the Lack of Luxury tour concert from
Austalia in 1988, not a new concert from '08.
Plus the cover has an old photo from '80 be-
fore Mr. Dagmar left the band to put out his
solo monstrocity! Caveat Emptor, but it's still
a good concert for the dough. Look for Chaep
