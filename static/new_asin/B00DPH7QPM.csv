5841454,3,B00DPH7QPM,"The premise of this film is good, being in the same neighborhood of ideas as Inception. Unfortunately, the writing isn't up to par and it all adds up to a so so ending. If you are a fan of the genre, you'll probably enjoy it but wishing there was more to it.",1377043200,2,258,3.980769230769231

5841456,5,B00DPH7QPM,"Extracted is a rare gem that  only comes around every few years that signals the coming of a great director. Like any movie buff knows Robert Rodriguez is best know to make big movies for little monies and Nir seems to want to take that crown away from him. Extracted couldn't have being made for more then a few hundred grand and what Mister Paniry does with that money rivals any big budget movie. Extracted stars Sasha Roiz ( Warehouse 13,  Grimm , Caprica , It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) as Tom , a scientist that develops a machine that allows a person to watch other peoples memories from within them. As we all know nobody ever wants to fund a project for what it was created for and Tom soon learns that. A potential financier ask to see a test of the machine before its ready and Tom has to put his money were his mouth is. Thing's go bad and now Tom is stuck inside the guinea pig. Anthony , a heroin addict accused of murdering his girlfriend. Extracted works cause it  follows the main rule all great science fictions movies abide by. It understands that the point of the story is not about the technology . Back to the Future was not about a time machine, the car was the tool that helped the creators tell their story. Other examples that come to mind , Looper, Primer, Stephen King's Under the Dome and even his novel 11/22/63 ( soon to be a movie). Do your genre loving self a favor and rent this today.",1375747200,10,1424,4.325842696629214
5841457,5,B00DPH7QPM,"SO interesting and well developed...I can't believe I haven't heard more about this movie. You really don't want to miss this, reminds me a little of Inception but easier to follow. So good!!!",1374883200,5,192,4.848484848484849
5841458,5,B00DPH7QPM,"The movie description does absolutely zero justice for this film. Part thriller, part horror and part love story, Extracted will have you questioning yourself until the very end. I bounced back and forth between loving and hating the characters so much I felt like a paddle ball. Everybody has their motives and beliefs and every action based on those can be both justified and despicable at the same time. The heroes are villans and the villans are heroes. Fantastic movie.",1505433600,,474,4.9375
5841459,5,B00DPH7QPM,"WOW! if you did not like this you are simple minded.  I am sure most negative reviews were posted by those that had no clue what was going on.  Understandable as this is a fairly complex plot.  Acting was good to excellent but the plot really carried it to 5 stars.  I need to watch at least the last 1/4 again to get a grip on it.  Sort of leaves you to derive for yourself what the end really means but in a good way.  So put your thinking cap on and watch this movie.  If you want just a good dumb fun movie this is definitely not for you.
PS don't cut it short - watch to the end...",1502150400,2,586,3.8333333333333335

5841461,5,B00DPH7QPM,"If I were to be perfectly honest, this movie actually is maybe a 3.5. I overcompensated for those who probably uncompensated because they expected a whole other movie. That's not hard to do, in fact I don't believe this movie poster is for this particular movie. Look up Extracted movie in your search engine and you will see what I mean. This movie features a brilliant scientist and his sidekick creating a machine to enter another person's memory. This is not Inception. And, of course, somehow we've got a heroin addicted criminal for him to jump into because reasons. And of course because reasons, he can't get back out. He's in there for over 4 1/2 years before he realizes hey , sometimes this idiot can see me. And it goes from there. As I said the movie was pretty neat, it was nice that this was a sci-fi flick more than a horror flick , and the performances were earnest and believable. The science was crap. Having the guy realize (now remember he's a rocket scientist) that a five minute reprogramming of a computer algorithm would have prevented this was really really pitiful. And I'm not gonna go into what they have to do to get in and get out. Let's just say it low-key, low-tech, and low believable. But despite all the different irritations, this still turned out to be a pretty decent movie which is why I'm going to give it a five and don't pay any attention to this poster I am positive it is not for this movie.",1499558400,,1436,4.4638783269961975

5841464,5,B00DPH7QPM,"I thought this was a great movie. Kind of like ""Inception"". I gave it 5 stars but it was rounded up from 4.5 since there are a couple of things that make it hard to suspend disbelief such as a wealthy individual in charge of the department of corrections - or was it just a regular government employee allocating hundreds of thousands of dollars for experimental R&D? Either case is hard to believe at best and ludicrous at worst. They could have come up with a better way to get the prisoner into the experiment.",1498262400,,513,4.410526315789474

5841469,5,B00DPH7QPM,"I gave this movie 5 stars because all the reviewers who seemed to understand the film gave it 5 stars. That's a weird reason, but this is ONE WEIRD FILM! I have a sub-par ability to follow a plot, and this movie made my brain wish it could reboot through the whole thing. I got the main idea, but the edits left me unable to finish the race. The acting was STUNNINGLY BRILLIANT. The casting, OMG, someone needs an Oscar for casting in this one. And I understood (no spoilers) the ending and yay. But when the screen went black, I said out loud, ""Oh please don't end now. Don't do this to me. Do not end right now!"" And up came the credits, and I was pizzissed! I HATE when they do that! I worked my brain to its limits to follow this probably great movie (if I could have followed it), and all they do for me is end it when it's not finished? I even said to myself, ""I'm gonna be rating this, you know. I can give you bad # of stars!"" But still. There were the stinking credits. No ending. DAMMIT! So I'm really mad at whoever did that, but way better comprehensions than mine gave it 5 stars, and explained why, and since I was lost  most of the time, I just did what I thought was right, not what i really thought, and gave it 5 stars. But I sure do hope your IQ is higher than 152 when you try to follow this thing or, talk about drug addicts (as this movie did), you'll wish you WERE one.

2 people are caught up in some sort of temporal loop; is this Star Trek or Dr. Strange?.....due to a chip or programming malfunction.
too convenient a premise; also nobody bothers to explain how these people manage to stay alive for 4 years unless we're supposed to assume their physical bodies are in some kind of comatose state.

This might seem contradictory, but, given the subject matter, there was no way that it could not have these seemingly contradictory aspects. Given this, the character development and integrity of writing were flawless. I am surprised that it got produced. I must have been a hard sell. I am not surprised that I didn't ever hear about it, because it is a challenging watch and beyond the attention span of contemporary audiences. You must give yourself to this movie and invest in order to realize its value. It deals with the potentials and pitfalls of our technology while keeping coherently wrapped up in its very human story.

It's not a bad movie in terms of anything specific, I just feel like the main protagonist could've been better at something. I can't describe it, but there was something I didn't perfectly enjoy about the main character.
The plot was good, it was interesting enough to keep you watching, tiny moments kind of hinge on the movie that keep it fresh, it was intriguing.
There was a line or two that made me think the movie was a tad cheesy because of it, but I can't call the whole movie cringey because of a couple lines.
Other than that, I thought it was a movie worth watching.",1488067200,2,759,4.314685314685315

(If this gets back to producers, child's fingernails shouldn't have been dirty, and we don't feel as much tenderness. -that makes a difference especially since they specifically wanted a closeup, and shows poor production. Also the boyfriends fond-memory-meeting-place  should have been somewhere modest but still special and effective. -Pool didn't make sense in the movie and it probably should.)",1485993600,,501,5.835616438356165

Sometimes, it depends on yur mood, too.  Today it was a five. If I wasn't in ""that mood"", I would have given it a 4 because it was directed by Spielberg,, Eastwood, Tarantino, Redford, or the likes of Scorsese or Carpenter.

I thoroughly enjoyed the concept, the actors, (except the warden- he was cheesy). the pave, the filming, etc...  After 10 minutes it was fast paced and no unnecessary scenes were in it.  It was a cool flick.  Guys would definitely like it.  Girls who like romance and angst, may not be into it.  But some girls think like a man and will like this too. The ending did not leave things unfinished, either.  You get a peek into its resolution and a confrontation at the end that resolves questions you didn't even think about.

The client rushes him to finish before he can make sure that all the bugs are taken care of. Then, he finds out that his client is the United States penal system, and they want to use his invention to go inside of the memory of criminals to find out if they are guilty of crimes. Tom is very disappointed, at first, but, then he decides to go through with the sale. The criminal is brought in, and Tom is expected to go inside of his memory. He sees the crime happen, and the invention works. But, then he finds he cannot get out!

This movie is very well done. There are some clever aspects to the movie that make it more realistic. One example is that when some details of a memory are lacking, they are just covered in a red X. When the memory is made more vivid with related details used to trigger the memory, they pop up in the image. It was very well thought out.

5841540,1,B00DPH7QPM,"Alright, disclosure first.  I honestly cannot recall a single Phase 4 film that I have watched or tried to watch that hasn't left me... well, more than disappointed, and I have tried so many times.  It is as if Phase 4 purposefully seeks out all of the individuals and elements it can find to create some kind of anti-synergy to make the worst films they can inflict upon us; and they do so prodigiously, and sadly for the future, seemingly unendlessly.  So, this is, I believe, the first Phase 4 film I have ever reviewed.  I am doing so out of resentment for all the prior pains inflicted upon me by them, and out of confusion over the Amazon and IMDB ratings presented to all of us, which suggest this movie is at least average, which it most certainly is not.  ""Extracted"" is, all on it own, wholly representative of all of the 1 out of 5 stuff that comes out of Phase 4.  Save yourself some time and watch almost anything else more interesting, like the grass growing, or a pot of water heating up to boil.",1465689600,5,1011,4.351063829787234

It turns out to be nothing of the sort, fortunately, and it's actually a compelling watch with a character driven mystery story.

5841549,5,B00DPH7QPM,"I loved this movie so much, I bought it and that doesn't happen too often. The film mostly revolves around two main characters that have never met until ""Tom"", who has invented a machine  that can ""extract memories"" from people finds himself with an assorted mix of people who are involved in law enforcement, prisons, etc. who want him to use his machine to go into the mind of a heroin addict named ""Anthony"" who has been charged with the murder of his ex-girlfriend and keeps insisting that he did NOT kill her because he couldn't remember what happened, as he was ""stoned on heroin and still loved her"". This is revealed very early in the film, so it won't spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it. ""Tom"" never wanted his machine to be used in that capacity. He wanted to help people who had suffered trauma but he's had difficulty finding anyone to fund his invention and since these men are basically the only people who have expressed any real interest in ""putting up the money""for him to realize his vision, he reluctantly agrees.
From this point on, of course, everything does NOT go as anticipated and ""Tom"" gets ""stuck"" in ""Anthony's"" mind and can't find his way out. The plot is creative and interesting with lots of twists and turns, the actors are extremely talented and believable as are the supporting cast and it's NOT a predictable story at any level!
There are lots of layers to the story as the characters are skillfully developed. The viewer ""sees"" Anthony's memories while he's serving his time in prison, as does Tom, who has been ""stuck"" for years now, inside of Anthony's brain! I don't want to reveal anymore to the story, as it's so entertaining to see what happens!
Personally, I thought the writing was brilliant and creative and really explores memories and how they can impact our lives. Memories are what make our lives unique from one another, from the joyful experiences to the sorrowful ones. Memories are what we have that make up our very lives. They give us hope, they keep lost loved ones ""alive"" and they can bring us laughter one minute and tears in the next minute. For some of us, memories are all we have left of a time in our lives where we were happy and contented to others of us, who desperately try to forget what we remember, if our memories are cloaked in darkness, despair and sometimes, hopelessness. From our very first memory in life to our last one, they help make us who we are. I can't imagine a life without memories to keep me company when I'm sad or alone or sharing memories with others in my life that make me laugh or cry. To a greater degree, memories, to me, are what make up our souls...",1432944000,4,2659,4.528066528066528
5841550,5,B00DPH7QPM,"Wonderful movie!  I've never seen ideas like these depicted in a movie before.  Especially poignant is the ending, where we (SPOILER ALERT!) find out that supposed ""real"" memories are often completely made up.  I have seen this in real life.  My 2 brothers and I, because I had told them this story for decades, had taken on those memories to themselves.  It was only when we went to some other people involved, that they remembered me and not my brothers there.  Additionally and interestingly, their memories ended where my story usually ended.  They could not recall the other events of the day.",1430006400,2,598,4.803921568627451
5841551,3,B00DPH7QPM,"Movies like Extracted, have such potential, however mistakes in the story often become their downfall. Extracted is the story of a scientist who has developed a new technology, that allows him to temporary transfer his consciousness to another person. Once inside their head, he can see their memories and know their feelings. Of course the Government is interested in this technology for criminal justice purposes and pay the scientist to go into the mind of a murder suspect, to find out if he's guilty or not. Once inside, the scientist becomes trapped and must figure out a way to make the suspect aware of his presents, before he can figure a way out. The problem I had with this story is that the scientist becomes trapped the very first time he uses his invention. What scientist would ever use themselves as the guinea pig? Additionally, are we supposed to believe that the government would just drop a bundle of money on an untested technology? Once inside the mans head, we constantly see memories out of order and jump between scientist memories, suspect memories, and what's going on in the outside world, making for a very confusing film. Dominic Bogart stars as the suspect and really does a nice job, however the scientist, played by Sasha Roiz wasn't nearly as believable. Extracted had a great story to work with, but a mediocre star, with a confusing timeline, making it nearly impossible to follow. I loved the premise, the investigation was interesting, and Dominic Bogart was really good, but all those things weren't enough to save an otherwise confusing and uneven film.",1420502400,,1593,4.9037037037037035

5841554,5,B00DPH7QPM,"I believe this may be the best straight-to-DVD film ever made, and it's a serious contender for the most initially underrated film of all time. Given the lukewarm (at best) reviews it got after playing a handful of film festivals and failing to find a distributor, I had to watch it a second time in the span of four days to see whether I hadn't partially hallucinated my initial hugely positive reaction. And it got even better! The first time through, any viewer is going to be ""working"" (of course it's fun) to piece together the story. You do note that the characters and performances seem to be very good, especially given the complete obscurity of nearly all the actors (lead Sasha Roiz has a regular supporting role on Grimm). On a second viewing, the complex plot holds up, and since you're no longer working at it, you realize that the characters and performances are stunningly good for what is essentially a micro-budget  sf puzzle movie like Primer. I was moved nearly to tears several times during the re-watch.

The science involved is about the nature and reliability of memory. It's based on a genuinely original idea: what if you could take all the memories a person had of some key event in their lives, and construct from them a single virtual-reality environment that they could walk around in, scrutinizing every element, all with the help of an advanced AI which could tell you the reliability of each detail? Wouldn't that be a great therapy tool for trauma victims? (Of course, in the film, it is co-opted for other uses.) This might be doable 50 or 100 years in the future; like a lot of great low-budget sf movies, this one arbitrarily supposes it could happen now, and executes it with tech so low it borders on retro. That may bother the overly literal, but many will think it's a gas.

Indeed, it is not for all tastes. You need to like smart, challenging sci-fi movies like Donnie Darko, The Prestige, and the aforementioned Primer; while not in the same class as those masterpieces, it can stand proudly among (or at the head of) the next-best group. You especially have to be good at not losing your grip on a movie when it defies expectation and avoids not just cliche, but what 95% of good screenwriters would do as a matter of course. The storytelling is as fresh as well thought-through as the plot. 92/ 100.",1417910400,,2344,4.6298076923076925

5841559,2,B00DPH7QPM,"Some people KNOW EXACTLY what the young girl felt when she would hear Amon Goth's footstep overhead as the master she was forced to serve at the concentration camp.  Now the machine in this movie would protect her from Holocaust deniers who would claim she is deceitful and a good actress.

What kind of person would imitate someone else's trauma?

For many Europeans, Anne Frank is a potent symbol of the Holocaust and the dangers of racism. But the Japanese people tend to connect to her story for fundamentally different reasons, according to Alain Lewkowicz, a French Jewish journalist who wrote an elaborate iPad application,""Anne Frank in the Land of Manga,"" about his investigation of the Anne Frank phenomenon in Japan. In January, a version of the work was published by the Franco-German television channel Arte.

""She symbolizes the ultimate World War II victim,"" said Lewkowicz. ""And that's how most Japanese consider their own country because of the atomic bombs -- a victim, never a perpetrator.""

I bet it's a totally different part of the brain.  I bet there's  a TRACE of the years of tearing up and wearing away from injustice.

SPOILER

The ending - the TWIST - is absolute shenanigans.

Browbeating can't be undetectable as a falsified memory because the very nature of browbeating is that the victim is so terrified that they better not forget to lie and put out the right story or suffer the consequences.

This is not about passing a polygraph.  This is about MK Ultra mindreading and inception and Joss Whedon's Dollhouse - however none of those ever addressed the issue of the verifiability of false memories - however Browbeating is not a possible old school way of implanting false memories - that trauma and scar tissue that makes browbeating effective in commanding obedience is the opposite of subconscious acceptance of false memories as truth.",1407628800,,1874,4.971153846153846
5841560,4,B00DPH7QPM,"Don't be misled by the DVD cover pictures or descriptions, Nir Paniry's independent film Extracted  (known as Extraction outside the US) is a very good character-driven, memorable and entertaining film that is somewhat a mix between movies like ""Inception,"" ""Source Code,"" ""Limitless"" and ""Dreamscape."" But while reminiscent of other movies, this film stands on its own as a fascinating tour of the human psyche. The thought-provoking premise of this film is that a scientist inventor named Tom (Sasha Roiz) is determined to help people recover from mental trauma, has developed technology to enter into another person's memories. But of course, as in every good movie, problems arise. The action is excellent, the acting well done and the ending unpredictable. Particularly intriguing is the concept of loitering within the consciousness of another person's long and short term memories, and all the good and bad that such a respite would entail. While this movie is generally solid, there were a few areas where I believe the film would have profited from further exploration, and it could have been more fluid with a more seasoned screen writer. That's why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. I really wanted to give it 4 1/2 but that's not possible. As the movie itself illustrates, ""nobody's Perfect"" so the next best thing is 4. There is a lot to like about this movie that the few bumps are barely noticeable. Extracted will leave you wondering how allowing someone to have intimate exploration of your own memories might change their feelings about you, and indeed the accuracy of the memories themselves.

5841565,3,B00DPH7QPM,"Somewhere between ""Inception"" and ""Dreamscape"" Lies this film ""Extraction."" As good as some of it might be, the bad drags down the good.

Here's the scoop. Tom (Sasha Roiz) has invented a gadget that can help relieve troubled people such as war vets, abused children, etc by extracting the bad stuff from their brains. Tom's agent is having a hard time selling it because it's merely a 'do good' device. But when the Department of Corrections wants to know if they can reverse the machine's operation to go into a person's head to determine his guilt he might have a sale and get rich from it. The first test goes horribly wrong with bad news for Tom.

There is a lot to like about this movie. Much of the idea surrounding the machine and the subsequent tech-talk dialogue is spot on. It sounds amazingly authentic. Tom's reluctance, on moral grounds, for going into someone's head and digging around, is also good. It's a mix of how people's brains work, morality and philosophy. And When what happens to him happens, they come up with a cool, techy reason on how it happens. The story itself needed some punching up. I liked the things that happened, but they came off in a somewhat clunky fashion. This is a case where a seasoned Hollywood script writer would come in handy.

The acting is decent overall. The production level areas are good enough for the most part as is the directing. The directing in the climax needed a bit more umph though. This is an indy film through and through. If you liked ""Primer"" or ""Upstream Color"" you'll probably want to check this out. It's well worth watching.
