The ghetto jokes of West Philly.  Lots of though provoking social topics positively addressed along the way with all the laughs.  Not to mention all the music, charm, and physical comedy of Will Smith.  These still hold up to watch again and again with the new generation.",1376092800,,441,4.723684210526316

2571476,5,B000FL7C8W,"In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground where I spent most of my days
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys, they were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighbor hood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said ""You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-air""",1373241600,,376,4.309859154929577

2571488,4,B000FL7C8W,"""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air - The Complete Fourth Season"" features a cast change - Daphne Maxwell-Reid joins the cast as Aunt Viv, a role previously played the previous three seasons by Janet Hubert-Whitten. The chemistry between Uncle Phil & the new Vivian isn't quite as strong, but Reid would acclimate herself to Aunt Viv in no time at all. Season Four opens with Will & Carlton moving out of the mansion & into their own apartment in ""Where There's A Will, There's A Way"" - a two-part episode. The boys find they have more freedom on their own, but soon run into trouble when they start fraternizing heavily by having a neighborhood party. The aftermath doesn't sit too well with their landlord, who evicts Will & Carlton, who goes home to Phil & Vivian, while Will toughs it out, first staying with Jazz before moving back into the mansion. While babysitting Nicky, Will encounters people at the Peacock who think Will's a father in the episode ""Father of the Year"". Will & Carlton pledge a fraternity on campus, but the head of the club wants only Will in the club in ""Blood Is Thicker Than Mud"". Things become serious on the homefront when Phil has a heart attack in ""Home Is Where The Heart Attack Is"", so Vivian puts her husband on a strict diet. Will sneaks in fast food to Philip. Will doesn't find college life exactly fun & games in the episode ""All Guts, No Glory"", where he must take a tough philosophy course to graduate this semester. Phil winds up taking the boys to court when Will & Carlton refuse to pay their rent in ""Will Goes A Courtin'"". Boyz II Men guest-stars when they attend & sing at Nicky's christening in ""'Twas the Night Before Christening"". Will has a difficult time studying for final exams due to a disturbance of a cricket in the house in the episode ""Sleepless In Bel-Air"", & Will has to take orders from boss Carlton at the Peacock in the episode ""Who's The Boss"". Will decides he'd rather sell cars than attend college in the episode ""You'd Better Shop Around"", featuring guest-star Robert Guillaume as Will's boss. In spite of a slight downturn in casting & quantity, ""Season Four"" is still a great season to stay tuned to the hilarity & chaos of the Banks family. One won't want to be without ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air - The Complete Fourth Season"" in their DVD collection, so make sure you pick up your copy ASAP!",1371340800,,2361,4.557647058823529
2571489,4,B000FL7C8W,This season took a turn down in the ratings. It struggled big time when they replaced vivian. I say only buy this dvd if you are truly a real fan of this show.,1370649600,,159,3.8484848484848486
2571490,5,B000FL7C8W,"Bring back shows like this. Please destroy all footage of reality shows, please?! I hate turning on tv and seeing sitcoms, dramas, etc.. cancelled but this talentless ho family the Kardashians continues to be played.",1365033600,,216,5.2
2571491,5,B000FL7C8W,"Will Smith is a genius! I absolutely love this show and it's comedy, everyone in the show is hilarious and I just can't get enough of it. Season 4 is a must have for any Fresh Prince fan.",1363478400,,187,3.9473684210526314
2571492,5,B000FL7C8W,Love when uncle phil pops carltons duck....howaaaaaaaard!!! One of the best episodes ever in my opinion!  I would definitely recommend,1362528000,,134,5.7

2571494,4,B000FL7C8W,"To the credit of the actors, producers, and writers of the show, this show continued for several more seasons and each one is still rather funny.  However, this was the start of the downfall for me, personally.  The family dynamic is interrupted when the original actress who played Vivian Banks is replaced.  The story seems to only rehash itself over and over and although it is still a tale of growing up, the tale has become faded with age.  However, despite this, the comedy is played out and played out well.  It tickles the funny bone and also touches the heart in many places, making the series one that has been treasured for years.",1358985600,,641,4.587719298245614
2571495,5,B000FL7C8W,"I love this series! I love how Will and his relatives learn a lot from each other, and the humor is fun but not overly dopey... and ooooh my goodness that episode with Will's Dad showing up... that always gets to me, especially now that I know that he expressed how he truly felt about his own father at the end so it got VERY real at that moment. :( So sad.",1356566400,,358,3.986111111111111
2571496,5,B000FL7C8W,"While Season 4 of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air will forever remain notorious for the Aunt Vivian Banks character role handover from Janet Hubert-Whitten to Daphne Maxwell-Reid, that surprise (to the prime-time audience of 1993-1994) reality fortunately did not damage the aura of the other characters on the show.  Will and Carlton maintain their love-hate relationship with one another; Hilary is ever the self-righteous snothead; Uncle Phil never loses sight of his household authority or irritation towards Will; Geoffrey [The] Butler maintains his genius dignity and hilarity; and on top of it all (despite being the baby of the family), Ashley expresses her more human side as she experiences life as a teenager going full steam ahead and astounds everybody in her family with her newfound womanhood on every level.
Recurring characters--Will's season-long girlfriend, Jackie (played by the youthful model/actress, Tyra Banks); as well as Jazz's ex-con of a wife--enter the scene in a fiery way, adding to the onscreen laughs and talent beautifully.  Even Will's mother makes two cameos--first in ""You Better Shop Around"", threatening the life of Will's supervisor at the car dealer for encouraging Will to drop out of school and become a full-time car salesman strictly for the sake of financial profit (her back-to-back-to-back pairs of cutthroat lines in that episode give her, and it, a million gold stars!: [to Will] ""Boy, where do you get off DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL?!"" ... ""Oh really?  [grab's Will by the ear] Does THIS FEEL GOOD?"" [to Will's boss, Mr. Fletcher] ""Who the hell are you?!"" ... ""Oh, so you're the SNAKE that LURED my boy out of that institution of HIGHER LEARNING!"" ... ""Oh really?  You ever been beat up by a woman?!""  [Mr. Fletcher] ""Not without having paid for it.  Will, I'll be in my office hiding under the desk if you need me.""  The second cameo of Will's mother (bearing a more straightforward character tone than in ""You Better Shop Around"") occurs in the season finale, ""The Philadelphia Story""--when Will and the Banks Family head east to his hometown and learn some startling facts about Will's reputation in the city of supposed brotherly love!
I second the opinions of many Amazon reviewers regarding the highlighted episodes from this season.  On the whole, I will say that certain characters' lines really gave Season 4's episodes the punch that made them memorable.  And since this was the second season of the Fresh Prince that I watched in full on DVD (the first was Season 1), I must say that the two years have quite a lot in common--particularly given the fact that they each began a new era in the series's history.  And if there is one chapter in television that will never end its value, it bears the title, ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air""!",1356220800,,2788,4.950749464668094

2571536,4,B000FL7C8W,"""The Fresh Prince"" was a great show during its first three seasons. The fourth season was good, and still pretty funny, but true Fresh Prince fans know that this was when the show started its swan song. First of all, the real Aunt Viv was gone, replaced by Daphne Maxwell Reid. The Vivian Banks character was useless from that point to the end of the series. Next was the addition of the new child, Nicky, which only brought the morale of the series down even more. Like ""Fresh Prince"" really needed another kid. The Nicky character was useless as well. Will and Carlton are pretty much the same, Ashley (she can sing!) finally shows some depth, and Uncle Phil shines, becoming, in a sense, the true heart and soul of the show. The fourth season really offers very few classic Fresh Prince episodes, but there is still some good entertainment here, and a few memorable moments: Carlton experiencing heartbreak from his first lover, Uncle Phil taking Will and Carlton to court, Will attempt to book Boyz II Men to perform at Nicky's christening, one of Uncle Phil's old flames honing in on Will, and the return of Will's father, who talks a big game but ends up leaving Will in heartbreak, leading to one of the most heartfelt scenes in the show's history (Will's teary testimony to Uncle Phil still gives me chills). So, this season is not without its moments, but the best days of ""The Fresh Prince"" are clearly behind it.

And by the way, the final two seasons of this show need to be released. It has been over a year since this DVD set was released and nothing new has come from ""The Fresh Prince"". It is stupid that this show has been put on ice while worse shows have seen full-series runs. Give the people what they want.",1196380800,6,1728,4.520766773162939

2571538,5,B000FL7C8W,"Season 4 is one of my favorite seasons.

I'm waiting for the last two. So far I haven't seen any news on the fifth season yet.  Below is the release schedule thus far:

Feb. 8, 2005

Feb. 14, 2006 (4 months)

Aug. 8, 2006 (6 months)

So far it is March and no news from tvshowsondvd yet about the next release. We at about the 7 month mark, and therefore I'm expecting to see the next season released this spring, and I desire to see the sixth season released before the end of the year. I hope they don't fall behind their reasonable release schedule, although it would be nice if studios put all seasons of shows on DVD much sooner than releasing them over a few year period.

One thing I will not accept is if they decide not to put out the last two seasons. That would be a great evil because you can't go this far and then stop.  That is what encourages piracy.",1173052800,6,892,4.1395348837209305

2571540,4,B000FL7C8W,"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air - The Complete Fourth Season

The fourth season of ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" isn't the best season but it still had a lot of funny episodes. The first two episodes are probably the funniest, especially the second one where Hilary's fianc Trevor hurts himself bungee-jumping on TV. Philip then says, ""Let's just hope Trevor's okay."" Cut to the next scene, everyone's in black and Philip says, ""Well, it was a lovely service.""

The problem with this season was the new Vivian. Daphne Maxwell-Reid is a good actress but it's hard to top Janet Hubert-Whitten's version. Janet made Vivian feisty and a take-no-mess type while Daphne's sterile version made it hard to watch (the writers must have known that too, maybe that's why Daphne wasn't in that many episodes). The good news with that is that the focus shifts from Vivian and onto the other characters, which in turn makes them stronger (see Will in ""Papa's Got a Brand New Excuse"" - my favorite episode).

The problem with the DVD set is that it looks rushed. Even the menu appears half-hearted compared to previous ""Fresh Prince"" sets. Also, there are no special features at all - but I guess that's not a big loss because all I usually watch are the episodes and the special features in previous sets weren't all that special, as someone mentioned earlier.

This season shows that the show wasn't on its death bed just yet. That would happen during the last season. -EJR",1169769600,9,1456,4.743083003952569

Expectations were definantly met with the first season, the episodes were great and so were the extras (cast interviews, bloopers etc.), however each season afterwards has got progressively worse in the 'extras' department, to the point where there are NO EXTRAS AT ALL in season 4. Unless you think subtitles are an extra you will be very disappointed with the lack of effort put into the dvd set of season 4.

The show is still great, but i personally believe its pathetic that no extras have been put into the show.

Being the series that launched Will Smith's career, you would think he would show some respect and at least give an interview about the series, but that hasn't happened in any of the four boxed sets so far.",1162512000,3,841,4.556291390728477
2571547,4,B000FL7C8W,"First, my two complaints about this DVD collection. 1) Daphne Maxwell Reid is not half the Vivian that her predecessor was. In fact, I find that the new Vivian gets on my nerves. She is not the same character as she was in the past. They may as well have written in a divorce and re-marriage or something! 2) This season has no special features. I guess this isn't the worst thing, since the first three seasons' ""special features"" were not so special in the first place!

Having gotten those two things out of the way, this season gives us as many laughs as previous seasons, and even has some extremely serious moments to boot. Will and Carlton face new challenges and adventures as college freshmen. Hilary mourns the tragic death of her fianc Trevor. Ashley continues to embrace young adulthood, even if the rest of the family is unwilling to allow her to grow up. There is wonderful on-screen chemistry/tension between Will and Jackie (played by Tyra Banks). Other special appearances are made by Robert Guillaume, Hugh Hefner, Donald Trump, and Boyz II Men.

Here are some of season 4's highlights:

All Guts, No Glory: Will faces the challenge of sticking with a class that forces him to try.

Father of the Year: Will receives extra attention from the ladies when they believe he is a single dad.

Blood is Thicker Than Mud: Will and Carlton attempt to work their way into a college fraternity. Unfortunately, Carlton is not seen as ""black enough.""

Home is Where the Heart Attack is: Philip promises to try to lose weight, but Will sneaks him burgers to satisfy his cravings. A heart attack results.

`Twas the Night Before Christening: Philip explains to little Nicky how he received 4 middle names at his christening. Special appearance: Boyz II Men

Who's the Boss?: Carlton becomes manager of the Peacock Stop, and Will learns what Geoffrey knew all along: life isn't easy when you work for a Banks.

I Know Why the Caged Bird Screams: Carlton, ULA's mascot (the pigeon) gets kidnapped by their rivals before the big game.

You'd Better Shop Around: Will decides to drop out of college to sell cars.

Papa's Got a Brand New Excuse: Will's father comes to pay him a visit, making many promises to spend more time with his son. (This episode is a real tear-jerker.)

The Philadelphia Story: The Banks family takes a trip to Philly, only to find out that Will has become a joke in his hometown.

As in my previous reviews, I have only highlighted my personal favorite episodes - they're all good! A warning to those who might watch this as a family: the content in this season is racier than in all others! A lot more innuendo and sexual content! Still, compared with what's on TV these days, it is reasonably mild. This is yet another wonderful season of a great TV show!",1161302400,10,2782,4.653061224489796

When Daphne Maxwell Reid came into the scene as Vivian, the show started going downhill. It was still a good show for it's last 3 seasons but the reason why it started going downhill is because of Daphne Maxwell Reid. When DMR took over as Vivian, Vivian became a whole new charcter. Vivian was dull. Vivian never got up in the kids faces and told them off when they did wrong. Vivian focused way too much on baby Nicky. She hardly gave Phillip the attention she used to. The other characters held the show together for the last 3 seasons. Plus, DMR's acting on the show can't compare to JHW's. I don't know if DMR acted that way on purpose or if the writers made Vivian that way intentionally but JHW was the best Vivian.

And I don't wish to see Daphne Maxwell-Reid play (Aunt Vivian). Will Smith as the main character of the whole show is a good actor, but I don't feel that I would enjoy seeing Daphne Maxwell-Reid playing (Aunt Vivian), because I like Janet Hubert-Whitten as the original (Aunt Vivian) alot better, and the first three seasons has her. I read something on the internet saying that Janet Hubert-Whitten was fired from the show, because her and Will Smith had difficulties working together, which means they didn't get along on the show.
