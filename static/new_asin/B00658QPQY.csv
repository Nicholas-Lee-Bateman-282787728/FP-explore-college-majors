8493341,5,B00658QPQY,I saw this performance on a TV special and had a hard time finding a DVD of this when first searching.  I wasn't sure what to expect of the quality  and playback after some of the reviews. This turned out to be a high quality DVD version of the Fox Theater performance and plays perfect on my computer DVD player and Sony blu ray player. The audio is also fantastic through my connected home theater audio system.,1397088000,2,413,4.35064935064935
