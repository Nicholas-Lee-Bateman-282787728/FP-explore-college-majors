5170973,5,B008NQO10I,"I watched this movie last night.  Don't let the subtitles scare you off.  This movie is actually really good, well worth the extra effort of reading the dialogue.  The actors do a great job, the script is tight, and the characters are very real.  And even though one of the ladies in the story starts out engaged to a man and then becomes involved with a woman (an old lesbian theme) it doesn't make the film cliche.  I would definitely recommend this film.",1348617600,27,457,4.457831325301205

5170975,5,B008NQO10I,"Wow, so good. I just saw it and realized it was made who knows when (2010!)  - fantastic acting and the whole look and feel, the soundtrack, the script, every bit of the movie - a quiet masterpiece. It appeals to ...um...straight people too, you know, why does it have to be labeled as a lesbian movie, it's just a movie...about two people falling in love. Very very strong, I like the part of standing up for yourself and not shying away about who you really are. But most importantly it's the subtle and dreamy quality of the film that appeals to me.",1502323200,,552,4.359223300970874
5170976,5,B008NQO10I,"I just had the experience of watching ""Kiss Me"" back-to-back with ""In the Mood for Love"" and the contrast was remarkable. For those who don't know, ""In the Mood for Love"" is a classic tale of frustrated love, a slow-building pressure cooker of agonizing missed opportunities and grief. The overwhelming message in that story is that love is a matter of chance, and if fate is not on your side, you're out of luck.

Similarly, ""Kiss Me"" has more than its share of realistic obstacles to love, but unlike the other movie, this film doggedly fights and fights against those obstacles. Along the way, ""Kiss Me"" digs deeply into the moment-by-moment uncertainties of love, the sheer terror of making yourself 100% vulnerable to a person you have no control over, trusting that your (basically insane) feelings will miraculously be reciprocated by the other person.

The course of true love never did run smooth.

But as I say, the really inspiring part of ""Kiss Me"" is the way it does not succumb to very real obstacles, the way it actually sacralizes the ultimacy of love's claim upon us. Love is up against it in our world: money, moralism, and sacrifice (Latin: production of the sacred) defeat love every day. ""Kiss Me"" holds out hope that love has enough allies to at least sometimes prevail.

Now, what can we do for the rest of us, for whom love seems forever a dream?",1501977600,2,1370,4.695833333333334

5170979,5,B008NQO10I,"This is one of my favourites. Its beautifully done, the filming, acting, emotion and very well written. Many 'lesbian' films fall into certain categories ... you have the flicks that are just hey look two girls are kissing to sell tickets, you have what's basically pornography with a vague story... typically more independent but mostly sexual, you have those buddy films where theres lots of talking and humor and maybe some drinking and then two people get together or dont. You have the coming out movies where someone is 'not gay' or 'unsure' and it all sort of evolves from there into a story where peoples reactions and a potential lover exist, you have the girl is depressed and self destructing movies..... this one falls into the smallest category... well filmed, good acting, minimal and tasteful realistic sex scenes, the story is good, the story is realistic and it doesn't fall into any above category... this is a story of two people meeting at a not so perfect time and making choices and its a beautiful little love story that you will care about. It doesn't matter in this film that they are both women and I don't see it as a 'lesbian' film, I see it just as a love story and that's a lovely rare thing when it comes to film including lesbians... if the blond girl was a man this would be basically the exact same movie accept it would reach a wider audience so I believe it is perfectly cast. The family is believable and their reactions are appropriate and I like almost all the characters if not all the characters... very watchable and there aren't really any cringe or unmatchable moments, now for spoilers so stop reading if you don't want to know vaguely what happens.
There is a woman and her fiance, her father is engaged to a woman and they travel to congratulate him and his fiance and announce their own good news. Her brother is there and the fiance has a lovely daughter. Our main character seems a bit troubled, sad even. As time progresses she is sort of trapped at a cottage with her soon to be step mother and soon to be step sister... they gradually form a friendship and things progress quickly from this point... Bigger spoiler, don't read past here if you don't want to know the entire movie...: neither girl is single, and neither girl is or was straight, the relationship progresses in a way that feels sad but also when they're together good, they are a good match and it is a healthy relationship, but they hurt people because they don't want to hurt people. This film has a happy ending and you leave it feeling like everything will be alright.",1493769600,4,2590,4.572043010752688

Just the right amount of sex scenes too. Highly relatable content with some pretty realistic romantic progression. Gotta say though, the people who are comparing this flick to Imagine Me & You need to pinch themselves. I would easily watch Imagine Me & You with my parents. Kiss Me?

5170986,5,B008NQO10I,"Some spoilers.....This is such a great film!  I could watch it over and over.  The acting is sweet and authentic.  I'm a lesbian and can spot the phony girl on girl stuff from a mile away.  Those films are usually directed by men.  The advantage of seeing a lesbian story from the perspective of the female gaze is you get very drawn into the intimacy and never feel exploited or icky.  Their world view is just so relatable.

 And let me tell you the sex scenes are VERY authentic and also absolutely important to the story.  The first big sex scene is so hot and happens at only 30 minutes into the film so you're not asking endlessly ""will she, or won't she?""  Then for about 6 minutes you get the the rare treat of seeing them make naughty, I-am-so-in-trouble-but-I-can't-stop love and wake up together and they never say one word during the entire scene.  Trust me, talking wouldn't have been appropriate!  Nor was there an overbearing music soundtrack in that love scene just some thunder in the background indicating the storm about to come and then a build up to some serious heavy breathing.

Later in the film lots more of kissing, sex and floods of emotions come up, so buckle up for the ride.  There's also plenty of humor and drama with multi-faceted characters.  Another review mentioned that all the characters are really dealing with how to play nice and how to be honest people in their relationships.  I think that was a very insightful observation.  Sometimes we have to fight a little to be with the one we love.
Some may feel that it's unrealistic for 2 people to fall in love so completely so quickly, but Frida has a line that basically says ""sometimes you can't understand everything all the time"".

 Don't let the subtitles turn you off.  Many of the most intimate and meaningful scenes don't have any dialogue. You'll find yourself wanting to get the Rosetta Stone program for Swedish!  This is a chick flick and might also appeal to sensitive guys, so if you're expecting something from the traditional male gaze of objectification (...think about that ridiculous sex scene from Blue is the Warmest Color) then it might not be for you.  But if you like your eye candy to be smart, sensitive and sexy then don't hesitate to rent or buy this one.

Lesbian subtext translation ...""I had a vebab"". equals  ""I just had sexy times with your girlfriend""",1484006400,9,2373,4.635491606714628

5170993,4,B008NQO10I,"The industry, in general, needs to do some work with upping their game on film titles in this genre. One imagines a silly little romantic farce with a title like ""Kiss Me."" This is a much more intelligent movie than the title suggests. Hang in there past the first act of this movie that opens, somewhat uncomfortably, with an incongruous sex scene. While slow on the take-off, what follows is a nuanced love story that features strong performances, expert cinematography and high end production values. The plot unfolds with some predictability because it's a story we know all too well: women's lives in and out of the closet, and the pain that women inevitably (cause and) experience when they understand they can no longer straddle both sides of the identity fence. Despite it's title, ""Kiss Me ""moves the bar higher in the evolution of the genre of lesbian film-making. That aspect makes it particularly noteworthy.",1479081600,,920,4.941935483870968

5171012,5,B008NQO10I,"I used to stream this movie a lot on Netflix, but then they took it off, so I bought it.

Typical plot for a ""lesbian"" film, straight woman, engaged, becomes entangled with a not-so-straight woman.

But, with proper resources, that cliche can be executed just right. Great acting, not a mediocre or awkward actor in the house. Fantastic writing, the characters had depth, nothing was empty.

Often in films like this one, I find that it is completely centered around the relationship between the two women, and the supporting characters and the way they are linked to the main characters are often empty storylines, and empty characters, as if the writer just needs to fill space in the movie but can't write anything aside from awkward dialogue around meaningless sex scenes. This film is not that.

This film has weight to it, it is full and it is warm. It's funny, painful, and sweet. Beautiful chemistry between the leads. One of my favorite movies ever, I always recommend it to my friends and will recommend to anyone looking in the genre.",1470355200,2,1045,4.7569060773480665

The two actresses were very good and perhaps because the chemistry between the two seemed believable. I can't really thing of a bad thing to say. Maybe some of you won't like reading English subtitles but I really don't think this is too distracting because of the outstanding acting by these two women.

5171106,5,B008NQO10I,"Very sweet movie. One of the best lesbian themed movies I've ever watched and I've watched dozens of them. What makes this one stand out is it's very authentic to life, how it really is between 2 women. It shows the intensity of it, it shows the chemistry and sparks. It really just seemed like this was filming a real life situation. The 2 leads are just amazing and perfect in their roles. I can't even tell they're acting: the eyes, the smiling, the poignant pauses and hesitations Hard to explain but maybe you know.

This isn't The L Word or a movie based on sex so if that's what you're looking for, you may be disappointed. It doesn't seem forced together by uncaring hands. The camera work and shots are great. The lighting is great.

It seems like every movie about lesbians involves one of the leads being a woman who is with a man and then meets a girl who she either experiments with or realizes she's a lesbian with. It doesn't always happen like that! It doesn't always involve cheating! There are single lesbians out there who meet and then couple with another single lesbian! But as I thought about it for this review, I realize that real life happens, and often it does happen like that. No one is really looking to hurt anyone else but sometimes you just meet another person who you have such chemistry with,  you just have to move to the next level with them even at the wrong time. So I'm not deducting stars but I do wish there were some more romantic movies where 2 single lesbians meet and get together. It happens, I promise!

I think this would be a great movie for someone to watch who maybe wants to understand what being gay really is. It's not all about sex. It's about not being able to take your eyes off someone else, and being drawn to them in a way no one else can draw you. This movie could teach some understanding and compassion.

Also, the lead role, the brunette, has an interesting transformation and growth. She goes from this cold, unhappy woman who is doing what everyone expects from her to a smiling, laughing, very happy person when she comes out. She slowly blooms. It's hard to catch, but if you pay close attention to the first love scene, the brunette sheds a tear. A tear for her engagement that is ending? Or a tear for the happiness of realizing who she really is and what she wants?

So overall, I love this movie and I'll keep it in mind from now on for date nights. It's not exciting or action packed or wild sex scenes. It's really more of an intimate character study of 2 women falling in love. Kudos!

Oh, and I barely realize I'm reading subtitles at all and how often does that happen?",1440028800,14,2646,4.387755102040816

5171239,5,B008NQO10I,"I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie. This is a tale as old as time that is NOT specific to lesbian movies and though I can see why some people would roll their eyes about how it's been done before, there are some important differences, they just aren't laid out in a linear fashion, and you have to have an appreciation for coming to understand events by the things that happen later. For example: after the affair between these women begins is when we learn that Mia's relationship with Tim isn't perfect and that she maybe already wasn't so happy with the apparent predetermination of the entire rest of her life checking off heteronormative benchmarks and making family and friends happy. This was perhaps unconscious, as when it is revealed that she has been with a woman before (also a surprise revealed later and a twist on this common plot), she says ""I just never thought I'd feel this way again."" From there we can believe that perhaps before she was quite resigned to something other than exactly what she wanted for herself. Frida is also different from the typical lesbian-chasing-betrothed-woman. Rather than her being a hopeless loner who must pry straight women away from men, she is already in a relationship, also revealed after the affair has begun. This is when we put it all together that this story makes a lot of sense, actually--we know that both women are adamantly against cheating, as many people would say they are. Before they, you know, cheat. For all sorts of reasons. It doesn't mean it doesn't make sense, it's just that attraction, sex, and love are really powerful forces on our lives, which is why stories of passionate affairs are so common. As common as infidelity itself. And this story doesn't glorify it. We aren't spared the pain of the jilted lovers. It is just matter-of-fact and honest. It's a story about overwhelming magnetism. And uniquely, Mia's crisis is not all about ""Oh no, I'm gay, what does it mean?!!"" but rather honoring her own desires vs. remaining on a familiar path that would please others. Of course, we still live in a day and age where you can't ignore the specific social consequences of Mia choosing to be with another woman, so that has to be addressed, but it is refreshingly for once not the ONLY thing. You watch her character go from palpably anxious and rigid to warm, vulnerable, and passionate.

All the other characters gave spot on performances of stories that stand on their own but that also support the main plot without being cheesy. Amazing cinematography. Rather than telling the love story through dialogue and explaining everything in great detail, it is mainly shown to us in body language, lingering stares and, logically, no shortage of intense, very unambiguous and honestly hot sex scenes, and that makes sense given that it's a story of being totally blindsided by unexpected love and lust. If you love smoldering tension, you will really appreciate this.",1414195200,2,2957,4.832347140039448

They did well with the scenery of Sweden and Denmark, (Fyn is in Denmark).  Acting was superb.  Krister Henriksson, Lasse, Mia's father did a great job.  I liked his reaction when Elizabeth, Lena Endre, told him that Mia, Ruth Vega Fernandez, had feeling for Frieda, Liv Mjones.  ""String beans?""

Ruth Vega Frenandez and Liv Mjones were both very believable and very pretty.  You could feel the Chemistry between them, and Mia's struggle with herself.  It was Mia that initiated the first kiss, it was she who had the most difficult time accepting her feelings.

This is a love story that needs to watched more than one time to catch all the nuances.  The facial expressions themselves show who the story develops.  It seems that Mia and Freda are attracted to each other almost at once.  At the party they keep watching each other, and then again on the ferry they way they look at each other.

You know, as a date night, where we have a nice dinner, light a fire, and then cuddle up on the couch and watch a sexy movie about two hot babes who take one look at each other and then cheat on their partners with each other.... DOH!!!

So, a romantic couple movie, this is not.  I mean, the actors are good looking, and there's lots of nudity, and the sex is sexy.  But so freaking what?  I'm sexy.  My wife is sexy.  What makes these women special?  Something about them blatantly cheating on their partners just makes them less attractive.

So halfway into the movie my wife and I had that talk again, where she calmly explains to me that if I ever cheat on her with a hot blond she'll go all Fatal Attraction on my ass.  I tried to tell her that it was the interloping chick, not the wife, who got all crazy in Fatal Attraction, but she wasn't interested in petty details.  I don't believe her anyway, because I don't think she could ever kill a bunny, but there ya have it.

I noticed a lot of subtleties I missed the first time around in actions, expressions, etc. that changed what I thought about and gave me a whole new appreciation of it.  I get some of the criticism about not enough initial development of the relationship, but I think it's probably due to time.  It's a movie, we have to suspend some disbelief right?  Anyway, I don't want to talk about what happens -- you don't need me to tell you, watching it would be far more enjoyable.
There are so many atrocious lesbian-themed movies out there, and I know you know what I'm talking about.  Typically the writing and/or acting is embarrassing to watch.  This is well-written, has an amazing cast, and I think the story itself is worthy of 2 hours of your time.  I know -- it's been done before -- but I don't think I've seen it done this well before.  There are so few high quality lesbian movies out there, that when one comes along, I like to purchase it in the silly hope that I'm doing my part to keep them being made.",1378598400,2,1176,4.3577981651376145
5171295,5,B008NQO10I,"Though the movie starts out a bit slow-paced, it is well-crafted, perfectly cast, brilliantly acted and shot. The chemistry between not just the main characters, but all the characters, is really genuine. It doesn't have a lot of fluff, not a lot of epic ""events"" that take place, or a overbearing soundtrack to distract from lack of content. Instead, the film depends on its own story and the talent of the actors to pull the story together.

Relating to this story a little more closely than I'd like to, this is how things happen. Not with huge explosions and insane situations that normally happen in movies. It's just life.",1378339200,4,628,4.761467889908257

With Kiss Me however, I noticed the praising reviews before renting and can admit I was not let down in the least. Every performance here is well done and the script is fantastic. The characters will captivate you and their story tugs at your heartstrings a bit. The love scene will take your breath away and their struggle in the after math feels real. I appreciate an ending where it is left to the viewer's interpretation.

5171313,5,B008NQO10I,"This is such a beautiful movie I don't even know where to begin.  I hate to use the term ""lesbian movie"" (I never hear the term ""heterosexual movie"", but since there are so few good romantic movies involving two women I will use the term so that people that are looking for that type of film will know that this is one.  However, this movie is so well acted that you forget it's about two women, it's just about love and how sometimes it comes at a bad time.  I found the story really plausible and realistic.  And it allows you to empathize with both women even though they are both cheating on their partners.  I read one review that said she didn't like the fact that they were cheating, but that's real life.  Love sneaks up on you when you least expect it.  Sometimes you don't even realize that you were unhappy until someone comes along and makes you truly happy.  This is the kind of film where you forget that you are watching a movie.  The acting is so realistic and flawless.  From the parents, to the women, to their significant others, I hope to see all these actors again.  I especially fell in love with Ruth Vega Fernandez..  So beautiful and real.  If it were up to me she would have won every award possible for this role.

I feel like I should mention that if you are looking for a cheesy, soft-core, lesbian sex movie... keep looking.  This movie wasn't made to titillate men (or women for that matter).  It's an honest-to-goodness romantic drama that just happens to feature two women.  I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this movie.  I wish I could show it to all the homophobes out there, so that they could see and understand that people fall in love because they are meant to, and gender has little to do with it.",1371686400,8,1739,4.38125
5171314,4,B008NQO10I,"For this Swedish film offering, we have Mia whose engaged to Tim and they go to the an engagement party for her father and Elizabeth the mother of a young woman named Frida. This upcoming marriage will of course make the two women stepsisters and things couldn't be happier for all involved. Oh I forgot to mention at this party a chance meeting between Mia and Frida leads to strong feelings developing between them and a fiery relationship begins.

This relationship obviously would throw every current relationship and the upcoming marriage into potential chaos, even if the feelings are strong and true. The story is a tad or rather very predictable but some strong performances help, especially Mia and Tim who plays the jilted lover quite well without going totally over the top. The rest of the cast plays their roles well even the smaller roles in the family seem fleshed out.

One thing to point out is the very visually striking locations, good color and great landscapes do lend to the overall cool feel of this movie. The European settings really are very pretty to see, even the shots of sunrises look crisp, the underwater part was nice too. The dialogue (in Swedish with English subtitles) also seems very natural and the story flows along at a good pace. While it's nothing epic it's certain a step or two above most dramas. *** out of 4 stars.",1369440000,7,1360,4.7100840336134455

It will run you through every emotion and get you all turned around.  It can be maddening at times because it is so easy to get caught up in the turbulence between the characters (and themselves).  It's FUNNY, SAD, EROTIC, LOVING, HEART WRENCHING, CUTE, AND INSPIRING AT THE SAME TIME!

If you let yourself, you will fall right into the movie and feel everything the characters would feel at that moment.  The character development is amazing.  The interpersonal dynamics and internal struggles are wonderful!  I don't know how the actresses, film writer(s) and director(s) did it!  Both lead actresses are delightful!

This is a powerful movie for more than one reason.  It's more than a coming out film!  It's about the awakening and the internal struggles.

If you are lesbian drama enthusiast, this movie may even surpass the quality of Elena Undone and Tipping The Velvet (I cannot believe that I'm saying this!)  I quite enjoyed and highly recommend other lesbian dramas such as Desert Hearts, Fingersmith, I Cannot Think Straight, A World Unseen, A Girl Thing, Imagine Me And You, A Perfect Ending, Kissing Jessica Stein, Better Than Chocolate.

5171326,3,B008NQO10I,"**** In Swedish with English subtitles ****

This didn't turn out to be as good as I thought it would be.  It's actually very watchable.  And you'll be happy to see some pretty decent filming and acting compared to some other lesbian-themed movies out there.  The blonde (Frida) was certainly pretty.  But the characterization of Mia (brunette) along with all the cheating these leads do kinda put me off.  Ultimately, I thought their chemistry was pretty weak until much later in the film.

So Mia is engaged to be married to her boyfriend of 7 years.  It's clear she loves him and is attracted to him.  We even get some heterosexual sex to back this up.  She's extremely anal and closed so you don't think she's anything more than a very uptight straight woman.  I found her only moderately appealing.

Some spoilers ahead....

Soon Mia meets Frida.  Both of their parents are to be married to each other so they will be step-sisters.  I didn't see any sparks fly when they met... the impression I got is Mia thought Frida might be hitting on her boyfriend.  So these two end up being stuck together and spending time together.  When they actually kissed, I almost wondered what brought that on.  I just wasn't feeling any valid attraction between these two.  For the most part, the opening is quite slow. Even boring.

As it turns out, Frida has a girlfriend and Mia has a bisexual past.  I was annoyed and surprised on both counts because Frida has no qualms whatsoever about cheating and Mia seems frightened to death at the prospect of being attracted to a woman like it was her first time.  Both of these leads totally screw over their partners and I kinda lost respect for them over this.  The way they disrespect their partners didn't make me too hopeful about their own future, even if they did get a happy ending.

The chemistry did improve once they got it on, to some degree.  It's the only time I feel Mia is actually attracted to Frida!  But this isn't something I'd watch again.  Mia is a little too uptight and I had a hard time buying her attraction to Frida.  Don't get me wrong, uptight can be very, very sexy because these kinds of women really let loose emotionally and sexually with the right partner.... but I don't think that was captured well here.  Mostly Frida was just plain weak on the seduction and Mia had a stick up her ass right up to the end.  Meh.",1365897600,8,2383,4.51288056206089

I like the secondary stories of Mia's relationship with her Dad and his Lasse's (Dad) relationship with his soon to be second wife; they keep the primary story from being too overpowering.  The movie also represents healthy lesbian characters, with no more than the 'typical' life baggage.  They are stable, not drug or drama addicted, and just like everyone else out there hoping to find their soul mate and being somewhat scared as hell when they do.

5171362,5,B008NQO10I,"It's always a long wait between professionally produced, lesbian themed movies. It's great that there are indie film makers doing their darndest to contribute to the lesbian movie scene, but it's such slim pickings finding a movie where you are not whincing at the acting or feeling like you are watching a uni student production. I just want to get involved in the story and not be distracted by detractions. Kyss Mig / Kiss Me carried me away.

What makes this movie great is so much more than this. Firstly, the story, the dialogue, and the characters are so engaging that you will be invested in what happens to Mia and Frida early into the movie. There are no cheesy lines, just compelling realism every minute.

Also (and critically), the two main actors, Liv and Ruth, are really fine performers, and well cast. There's a sweet chemistry between them which was tugging my heart strings as Mia and Frida's relationship oscillated between faultering and soaring. Frida (Liv Mj&ouml;nes) has an innocence and child like determinedness about her that I couldn't help endear to. I also warmed to Mia (Ruth Vega Fernandez) as her character arc took her from sullen and a little self involved, to awakening to the truth of her heart.

With lighting, settings, and a fabulous soundtrack (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kyss-Mig-With-Every-Heartbeat-Original-Soundtrack/dp/B005FWABW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kyss Mig - With Every Heartbeat (Original Soundtrack)</a>), director, Alexandra-Therese Keining, has created subtle moods and ambience which are always fitting for the moment. This is all part and parcel of the fact that this is a professional production, made by artists who really know how to make good cinema.

Kyss Mig / Kiss Me will leave you smiling.

5171399,5,B008NQO10I,"There is a lot of movies depicting Lesbian lifestyle as just about sex. This one shows the romance, the coming out to oneself, the emotional connections of women who are lesbians. I loved it. The actors were remarkable. The story plot has to do with acceptance of who one is and falling in love. while changing, here the parents are understanding which isn't always the case in real life. There wasn't a lot of preaching. It was just a simply lesbian romance of two women who fall in love. One who has acceptance of herself, and one who struggles between an engagement to a man and her new found love for a women. Finally, it doesn't end like many do with the man getting the woman in the end because she can't accept who she is, another tragic thing that tends to happen is movies with Lesbian Romance. If you are homophobic, don't watch this. If you are open to a very good love story regardless of gender, you will enjoy this. If you are just curious, but open to other lifestyles, you will get a more accurate account of how lesbians feel about love, the emotional connection between a romance, and a better realistic of the various lesbians in life since each is unique, beautiful and different.",1356739200,6,1200,4.509174311926605

It isn't really original though,  a love story between two woman and a coming out story, but it is really well done. The acting is really excellent and the quality of the production is first rate. A refreshing change when judged by some other poorly made independent gay and lesbian films.

The music is appropriate and infectious and overall this movie is a delight to watch with beautifully framed rural scenes juxaposed with the urbane fast paced life style of Mia the ambitious character.  Great to see really good movies being produced with alternative love themes.",1355270400,5,636,4.87037037037037
5171409,3,B008NQO10I,"There were a couple things I like about this movie. One, that the lesbian character is in a relationship. Way too many of these straight-woman-married/engaged/in-a-relationship stories have the lesbian hanging out in an isolated world where, of course, she MUST convert a straight woman to her ways in order to have a lover. By taking that factor out, we can more easily believe Frida and Mia like each other, because they like each other. It's not because they are the only two possible people for each other in a straight world or the lesbian must 'convert' someone or be alone. Which is my second winning thing about the movie, Mia's bisexuality as a factor. Once that ""comes out"", it adds a layer to things that again helps makes this less about 'the only two that could  must be"" and two people who chose each other because they want each other.

Only, in my opinion, this comes out WAY too late in the film. Life is complicated, but film's should unfold in a linear fashion where the viewer can justify character's actions along the way and if you show me a woman having sex (and seeming to enjoy it) with her man and then half way through the film have herself throw herself at a woman - then damn near run away from it. I'm still thinking she's a woman who's thought herself straight up to now and this 'new' emotion is causing conflict, fine, I'm on that journey with the character. In fact, the character even SAYS as much to Frida. Then to suddenly 'cheat' me and say 'hey, I've actually known I might be bisexual for awhile' feels like just that, a cheat. I shouldn't have to re-watch the movie with the intent of redefining that character journey. There are twist and there are cheats, this just felt like a cheat. My example of a lesbian movies that pulled off the questioning female well 'Loving Annabelle' - as much as that was about the build to a love scene it at least was a logical build to a a love scene. It set up a character reluctant to deal with conflicts in her perception of her own sexuality really early in the film with simple visual clues to a pre-existing relationship, so when this good-girl teacher finally breaks down and sleeps with her female student, I buy it.

The thing that really turned me off about this film and made me reluctant to root for the 'couple' was the lack of respect for existing relationships. To have the feelings and walk the fine line of what to do with them is one thing - and great dramatic tension. To throw other people under the bus because there's a jones in your crotch for someone else is another. Kill me, shoot me, but i think 'Imagine, Me, & You' did this particular bit about a thousand times better as did the movie 'When Night is Falling'. In 'Imagine', in addition to developing a relationship between the characters for me to root for, I freakin' loved Heck. I didn't want him hurt and I respected Luce, because she didn't want to hurt him either. In 'When Night is Falling' the out lesbian Petra is aggressive in putting her interest for the other woman out there, but respects whatever line she draws in the sand (to a point). But she also has NO relationship with the character's boyfriend. So while there is an affair present there, as in this film. Her mother isn't marrying the other character's father (as in Kyss Mig) or they haven't hung out and had dinner together (as in Imagine Me & You). She just met someone and she likes her. As for the Camille, who believes she's straight, she has enough of a layered conflict about her sexuality and her relationship that I give her some rope on eventually cheating on her boyfriend.

Frida not only had no issue with seducing her future Step-Father's daughter, she threw her girlfriend under the bus. And she'd had a longer relationship with the father than she had with Mia. Yet, she aggressively pursues Mia after that first kiss without reluctance despite having a woman at home and the stress it might put on her mother's relationship with Mia's father, who she allegedly likes. I never got over thinking Frida was a jerk for the way she treated those characters. So much so, I didn't feel a bit sorry for her when things went bad with Mia. And poor Tim. So he was picky about where they lived and had some grand opinions on there wedding. The dude wasn't a bad guy and it seemed like the movie wanted me to believe he was. Yeah, he gets aggressive once in bed, but he backs off when he realizes she's not into it. Because he's desperate and knows he's losing the woman he's invested years with (seven if I remember correctly), yeah he's pushing some angles. He's desperate - just like Frida's girlfriend - to save his relationship. Again, I now like both Elin and Tim MORE than Frida and Mia.

Also, if Frida and mom and new step-dad were all thrilled to have Tim around, why wasn't Elin hanging out with the fam? He obviously doesn't mind that Frida is gay as she isn't his daughter, again they blatantly say this in the film. So if lovers are being invited to the table and Frida and step-dad get along so well, Elin's absence seems weird once we know she exist. Another slap in the face viewer 'cheat' early in the film is not revealing this lover exist earlier in the film. And what was the point of not even speaking Elin's name? Hiding Frida's sexuality until later in the film? She's practically undressing Mia with her eyes in the first two seconds, attraction, I get it. She likes girls. There's no value in hiding the girlfriend from the viewer, even if you hide it from Mia so she can have her 'so you like girls moment'. Also once you find out Mia is aware of her own bisexuality, all these moments feel a little like lies targeted at the viewer. I bought sexual confusion in 'Loving Annabelle' (thin as plot was there) way more than I bought it here.

The two women the film wanted me to root for were such horrible unfeeling people to their lovers in this film, the people and relationship I found myself rooting for was the one between the parents. That stood the greatest test and showed far more character. Oskar was a total plot device that never was properly developed. We never learn how he feels about anything. Little pre-pubescent 'H' in Imagine Me & You was at least important to the plot and had thoughts, feelings, and reactions to everything. The father-daughter relationship in Kyss Mig also failed to have a satisfying conclusion, beyond 'okay, so my daughter's bisexual'. The complicated emotional layers and divorce issues get lost in the haze of 'will these two characters get together' which at the point, I don't care if they do, because they've both been such horrible people to their lovers and too extraordinarily selfish with little too redeem them.",1355270400,18,6721,4.536685902720528
5171410,5,B008NQO10I,So glad to finally see a romance between women that doesn't just throw it away at the end. Love this movie,1354579200,5,106,4.095238095238095
5171411,5,B008NQO10I,"At first I was a little put off because of the subtitles. However I had seen the trailer and it looked worth seeing so I watched it and I am SO GLAD I DID!!! The chemistry between the two STUNNING leading ladies was fantastic and although the story line (girl's with boy, girl meets girl, girl falls for girl) has been done in lesbian film before it was scripted, acted, directed, and shot so well that it wasn't a cliche. Watch and you will be VERY happy you did!!!",1354492800,4,466,4.247191011235955
5171412,5,B008NQO10I,Great movie! I loved the storyline even if it was in a different language the subtitles were just fine especially because of great picture quality.  I had not seen a good lesbian movie since Fingersmith which I also purchased on Amazon.,1353715200,4,236,4.7560975609756095
5171413,5,B008NQO10I,i really wasn't expecting much most lesbian movies are terrible. but it was a nice story with honest believable characters.  i'd definitely recommend it.,1352851200,4,153,5.375
5171414,3,B008NQO10I,"This movie strickly made for other lesbians. It is a lesbian love story and it has no bearing on society perspective or social aspects etc. It does not have any revealing sex scenes either( guys who wishes to watch to girl in the bed). it is a love story. One girl is about to marry a guy who she has been with 7 years and has future plans with him. Other girl is a known lesbian and she is in a relationship with other lesbian. Lesbian girl's mom and other girl's dad are getting married and these two girls meet. They fall in love, after brief moment of togetherness, they go back to their lives just to find out they cannot go back to anything but to eachother. I mean, lesbian romantic love story, feel good inside etc.",1352592000,8,723,4.246376811594203
5171415,5,B008NQO10I,"""Kiss Me"" is a critically acclaimed film about lesbian love, and, once you watch it, you'll understand why. It not only addresses the love between two women, but also the emotional impact that it leaves in all the involved parties. It is smart, sexy, authentic - perhaps the best lesbian movie that I have had the pleasure the watch, period.

Mia (Ruth Vega Fernandez) is happily engaged to Tim (Joakim Ntterqvist), and we meet them at the beginning of the film, making passionate love, and then rushing over to Mia's father, Lasse (Krister Henriksson), 60th birthday party. Once at the party, we are introduced to Lasse's fabulous wife Elisabeth (Lena Endre), and her precious daughter Frida (Liv Mjnes).  All is well until Mia and Frida later on go to visit Elisabeth at her country house, in a beautiful island. Lasse was supposed to go, but didn't make it.  Mia was not happy about it, because she wanted to talk to her father. This situation, of course, forces Mia and Frida to spend some time together. One thing leads to another, and Mia and Frida kiss each other, something that Mia regrets afterwards. She tells Frida, ""I'm marrying Tim in a few months. I can't feel this way, don't you see?""

Eventually, Mia returns to Tim, and keeps preparing her wedding. Unfortunately, the tension is there, as Mia is in love with Frida, and vice versa - Frida is already a declared lesbian. Lasse, on the other hand, is a distant father, who rather doesn't get involved and tries to ignore the problem, with Elisabeth telling him at one point, ""If you tended your family like your orchids, things would be different.""  All these situations will force Mia to make a hard decision.

""Kiss Me"" is well-acted, and is aided greatly by Fernandez' and Mjnes' great, beautiful, expressive faces. Hopefully, one day Hollywood will take notice. The underwater scenes, as well as the sexual ones are truly precious. Directed Alexandra-Therese Keining, this is a penetrating and sincere film that won the Audience Award of the Breakthrough Section of the American Film Institute. The DVD includes a music video and more.  (Sweden, 2011, color, 105 min).

5171416,5,B008NQO10I,"Mia (Ruth Vega Fernandez) announces her engagement to boyfriend Tim (Joakim Natterqvist) at her father's 60th Birthday Party. Her father Lasse (Krister Henriksson) has just asked his partner Elizabeth (Lena Endre) to marry him.  When Mia meets Elizabeth's fun-loving daughter Frida (Liv Mjones), she is initially wary. Reluctantly, she agrees to a weekend getaway on the island of Fyn with Frida and Elizabeth. Forced to share a bedroom with Frida, Mia finds herself fascinated by the other woman's free-spirited enjoyment of life. While out walking in the woods, Mia boldly kisses Frida leading to an amorous embrace.  Frida is ready and willing to reciprocate and the women soon feverishly make love for the first time.

The weekend over, Mia must return to Stockholm and her life with Tim and Frida to her partner Elin. Both women find it hard to put the intimacy they shared behind them. Escaping into the windswept Swedish countryside, the women shed their inhibitions once more and in the process fall deeply in love. Their lovemaking scenes show the playfulness and urgency of a new love affair. The intensity of their emotions however, soon overpowers both women and they question whether they really can return to their old lives.

Alexandra-Therese Keining's beautifully directed lovemaking scenes sizzle on screen, some with no music at all, just the delightful sounds of two women ardently making love. The beautiful Swedish coast and countryside makes a perfect backdrop for this sensitive portrayal of undeniable attraction and love as it collides with life and family expectations.
