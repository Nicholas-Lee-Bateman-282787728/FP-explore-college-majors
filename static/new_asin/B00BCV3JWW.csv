5580116,1,B00BCV3JWW,"The program is modestly named Women Who Make America. Webster would restate this as Women Who Bring into Being America. There is not much of a pretense that this is a balanced history of the women's movement. This is the women's movement speaking of their reinvented selves and revisionist history.  While Webster does not define reinvent one possible definition would be to make superficial changes to appear more likable while not making any changes to your core belief system or anything else of substance.  Letty Cottin Pogrebin co-founder of MS. Magazine talked in many segments projecting a caring, sincere and sweet persona, as did virtually all of the presenters. It is only later that her daughter expresses her feeling that Ms Pogrebin has anger issues that her daughter does not want in her own life. Quite conspicuous by it's absence is the strident anger, male hatred and advocacy research studies. What their advocacy research studies had in common is that none of them were published in scholarly journals for peer review, the results were not duplicated by third party researchers and did not stand up to investigative examination.

Of the many statements in ""Makers"" some of the statements concerning domestic violence are printed here. ""All of the women in the consciousness raising meetings had fathers who browbeat their mothers. That artsy ads showing women's legs in what appears to be women's magazines plays a huge role in encouraging violence against women. In the confines of a man's home, custom decreed, his wife's body belonged to him (alleged to be true in the 1950's). (1970's) There were no laws that defined violence against women. There was no word for battered women. There was no word because it's called ""life"". Domestic violence was not even whispered about - no one talked about it."" Taken together these statements would seem to imply that domestic violence is always the husband beating his wife, that domestic violence was quite common and there were no laws against domestic violence before 1970. The three separate studies on domestic violence funded by the US Justice Department demonstrated that both husbands and wives are roughly equal victims of domestic violence and that one or two households out of 100 have what could be called domestic violence. The first codification of English common law, used as basis of US law, by William Blackstone (1423-80) prohibited violence to wives by their husbands. By 1870 a full century before 1970 domestic violence was illegal in almost every state in the USA. Before then wife -beaters were charged with assault and battery.

My great-grandfather was was involved in a hunting accident that made it impossible for him support the family. So my grandfather dropped out of the 8th grade and became the `man' of the family. This was over 100 years ago and the only jobs available were dirty hard jobs that no one wanted to do. He did what had to be done to support his family and insured that all of his younger siblings were able to finish high school. Years later he needed to find a way to send his children to college. Other families in the extended family had the same problem. He organized the extended family to build a house close to the state college. This made it possible for these children to finish college, including my mother. He had honesty, truthfulness and ethics that went to the bone.
Question: How many times did my grandfather reinvent himself?",1373760000,3,3453,4.948275862068965

5580121,5,B00BCV3JWW,I was inspired by the woman that changed the way Americans see the role of women in [fill in the blank].  My favorite story was that of the first woman who ran the Boston Marathon.,1369872000,,180,4.142857142857143
5580122,5,B00BCV3JWW,"""Makers"" is a captivating production -  an outstanding collection of historical footage, stories, and commentary from the late 1950's to the present, featuring the contributions of both well known and relatively unknown women.  Women who, by virtue of their strength and committment to women's rights, have made major contributions to our lives.  ""Makers"" timeline parallels my lifetime.  I've often wondered if younger women have much of a sense of the struggles and persistence that has led to the myriad of opportunities for girls and women now often taken for granted.  ""Makers"" provides a lively, engaging opportunity for those who weren't there throughout the past fifty years to get a real sense of what transpired over that time and how we got to where we now are.  And, for those of us who lived the times, what a great opportunity to revisit a real revolution.",1361836800,14,870,5.006944444444445
5580123,5,B00BCV3JWW,"I just saw this on PBS this evening and couldn't tear myself away from it. I only had fringe knowledge of this history, as I was too young to be aware of it when it was beginning, and it wasn't being discussed as I became a teen in a very conservative Southern small town - maybe too controversial or too recent to be considered ""history"" for study. It's an invaluable history lesson and inspiration. All women today should consider themselves indebted to those who stood up for our rights, broke barriers, and championed change.  While we still have strides to make in the US, our lives are luxurious compared to women of many cultures, so it's fitting that the movement's emphasis has shifted to bettering their lives.
I'm buying this as soon as it comes out & maybe a copy for our library, too. Make sure you see this and get others to watch it too!",1361836800,17,852,4.461538461538462
5580124,5,B00BCV3JWW,"Just watched this on PBS....blown away by the thought and care that went into making it and sharing it with a world that seems to have forgotten exactly how hard many people worked so that I would EXPECT that I have the RIGHT to write this review and have it be read.

The production is well worth the time. Please share it with everyone you can think of.",1361836800,20,380,4.205479452054795

5580128,3,B00BCV3JWW,"This is a collection and brief presentation of many woman in different fields. Its OK but is does not go in depth on any of them. Rather, it features each of them in specific situations. I think a preferred approach, would be to follow the American Heritage concept of an in depth study on the most popular and important woman of their time.",1425254400,,341,4.428571428571429

5580138,5,B00BCV3JWW,"Very well-made documentary. Fascinating. But at 3 hours in length, it is way too long to play for my gender studies students.

This was an excellent theme movie for the special occasion and after organizing this event for 5 years, I was running out of  appropriate movies.  Of course, this one is 3 hours long -- way longer than our lunch break, but after showing the first part, everyone agreed, we all needed to get back together again for a brown bag lunch and finish watching every last minute.

This movie is an amazing way to look back and see all the changes that took place over the past 40 years.",1385769600,,557,4.378640776699029

It will surprise, astonish & shock, but mostly it'll leave you horrified at all of the unjust that women have had to face & overcome up to now... & to think how far we have yet to go. That feeling of horror quickly turns into motivation & a drive to do something, anything, which will secure our place in this world as equal w/ men - something that is already widely known, though not recognized or accepted.",1504396800,,453,4.27906976744186
