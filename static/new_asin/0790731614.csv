It was a meaningful rendition that didn't try to cater to the lust obsessed generation.  That being said, I found myself disappointed at the level of attractiveness of some of the main characters.  Kitty was casted well, but it was hard to take the passionate love/anti love story seriously with a skuzzy Vronsky and a beautiful, but rather plain looking Anna.  I kept looking for that enigmatic spark promised by Tolstoy, but was continually disappointed.",1439596800,,566,4.91578947368421

115206,4,0790731614,"ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS TO LOOK AT!  STAR STUDDED - Though acting a little uneven

1997 version with Sophie Marceau and Sean Bean
This adaptation is perhaps the most visually stunning of the serious adaptations.  I consider the recent version with Keira Knightly an art piece separate but listed below.  This version incorporates real scenery rather than set artwork.  The pastoral countryside, the palaces and country houses, the artistic cinematography, the imagery is just incredible.  From Kitty's red coat against the white snow, the white lily's against green grass of a country palace, or the kiss after Levin's second proposal framed in a staircase under a massive stone archway (huge urns on each side, the light coming from the background creating negative space up front).  As stunning as these scenes appear, they are seemingly natural to the flow rather than distractingly artistic.  I felt the imagery even paid a little homage to the famous paintings by James Tissot which illustrate famous editions of Anna Karenina.  Surely the art director had seen them.  I included a few screen shots below, but they don't do full justice.

Almost every single character in this movie is played by a recognizable star.  This is a strength and a weakness.  The accents are a little uneven as the all-star cast doesn't come together in a cohesive whole.  You will hear everything including British, American, Canadian, French and Russian accents.  Noticeably so.  Despite the stars, not all the acting is that strong as big names seem to be more important than proper casting for character.  Plot flow can be choppy as expected for such a long book squeezed into a short movie.  Picture quality was surprisingly good for an old DVD.  Someday this will make an amazing Blu Ray transfer and hopefully they can add footage to flesh it out better than the original cut.  Still highly recommended with caveats.

BRIEF COMPARISONS TO OTHER EDITIONS with links to the product  (this list is not comprehensive and I apologize if a favored version is not represented.  I already watched nearly 24 hrs of video not counting research and writing!)  This list is not in order of precedence and each version has merits.  You can see slightly more detailed versions of my reviews like the paragraph above by going to each product page.

The Gold Standard of adaptations even after so many years.  Despite the 70's BBC acting style, this version has aged well with tremendous faithfulness to the book and ideas behind it.  Performances are melodramatic to today's audience, but so good they are relevant.  It is still my favorite rendition.  You must be up for nearly 10 hrs worth of story though.

This version is the next longest I viewed and fairly faithful to the plot and spirit of the book.  The acting style is more natural (less stage play melodramatic) and the entire focus seems to be on a realistic portrayal.  Lead actors less compelling than I would have liked.  This version will still be some peoples' favorite.  It is not mine.

Classic black and white is a different style and shouldn't be compared too critically with modern adaptations.  It has the charm of a golden age of cinema.  Leigh is perhaps still the most elegant Anna and Kieron Moore the most dashing Vronsky after all this time.

Shortened or edited version is somewhat lifeless though the flow is less choppy than other adaptations.  Badly in need of a restoration in video/sound quality and return of the lost footage not found in any copies I know of.

This is not for Tolstoy traditionalists!  However, the stunning visuals and choreographed set pieces really are brilliant.  It is set like a stage play and tends to swirl around a lot.

115207,4,0790731614,"I simply love this version of Anna Karenina.  The only problem I had is that the director's cut was never released on DVD/Blu-ray, but it was what was played by television stations, which is where I had watched this movie for the first time.

115216,5,0790731614,"This is my absolute favorite version of ""Anna Karenina"". It is an achingly beautiful portrait of love, lust and personal destruction. It is worlds better than the lame version starring Keira Knightley and Jude Law. (Sean Bean could beat him in a ""sexy' contest, any day!)

115233,5,0790731614,"This version showcases the actual palaces in St. Petersburg, which helps put this classic in such a believable and wonderful thematic frame. Sophie Marcaeu's eyes  carry so many messages as the film progresses.  And rather than portray Count Vronsky as a woman-chasing cad, he is shown by actor Sean Bean to have been truly in love and so devastated by Anna's suicide  that he wishes to die in the upcoming Turkish War in 1877.  This is one of the few versions to show the whole affair as a true tragedy for all concerned, from Anna's husband, Karenin (James Fox), who is unable to show his emotion to her, to Vronsky, who is truly smitten.  Anna herself responds to the romantic call of her heart, only to be heart-broken in the end.  Meanwhile the counter balance of the tale of landowner Levin's struggle to nurture a delicate love for Kitty, a heart-broken victim of Vronsky.  One love will survive and one love will end in tragedy.  the areas  in and around St. Petersburg add to the film's beauty and sense of authenticity and romance.",1362700800,4,1041,4.644808743169399

Again the year and location of Levin's country estate is given on the screen when he is hunting with Stiva.  Other than those omissions, the movie is awesome!

I carried ""Anna Karenina"" around like a bible when I was a lass and its still my favorite novel so this abbreviated movie version was not satisfying for me. I spent most of the time while viewing this movie trying to sort in my mind everything that had been left out. Face it, its not possible to do justice to ""Anna Karenina"" in two hours. Betsy was barely a character and where was sweet Dolly??? I loved the Russian ""look"" of the female lead Sophie Marceau as Anna but handsome Sean Bean just didn't get it as Vronsky for me.

Anna's foreboding dreams of doom or opiate delusions, depending on how you interpret them, were never addressed well in this reviewed version either. Even the scenery looked much too warm and sunny to be in Russia, the costuming lacked authentic detail, and the ponies looked like spindly English thoroughbreds and not the punched-up, sturdy Russian stock you'd expect to see pulling sleds in the snow. Tolstoy's opulent tapestry of character's lives, loves, and deaths in aristocratic Russia never has the time or places to be properly woven into the masterpiece ""Anna Karenina"" is in this version.",1322006400,8,1638,5.2796934865900385

I particularly appreciate that it takes the time to let the watcher know of the role her ""sleeping medicine"" affected her decline.  And also  taking the time to let us share Levin's journey.

115267,5,0790731614,"Count Leo N. Tolstoy's classic novel has been transferred to the silver screen numerous times, most notably in 1935 with Greta Garbo & Frederic March and in 1948 with Vivien Leigh & Ralph Richardson. However, this opulent and magnificent version, filmed in Russia (which lends it greater authenticity than previous film and TV versions) is by far the best. Sophie Marceau (""Braveheart"") is undeniably beautiful and does a fantastique job as Anna, making her own mark on the tragically doomed title character. Sean Bean (""Goldeneye"") is dashing & impulsive as Count Vronsky.

115268,5,0790731614,"Anna Karenina is a very tragic story of unfulfilled love, and Sophie Marceau pulls off the roll fabulously.  She's the perfect age for a young and beautiful Anna, married to an aged Karenin.  Sean Penn is a great Vronsky, although I still think Chris Reeves was a more attractive Count Vronsky although I don't care for the movie version he starred in.  But this version of Anna Karenina is a must have for anyone in love with historical costume, particularly any fan of the cuirass bodice style of the mid to late 1870s version of the bustle dress era.  I don't recall who did the costuming, but they should have received an Oscar.  Everything that both Anna and Princess Kitty wore on screen is to die for, from Anna's black ball gown and Kitty's yellow one, to the black and white ""race day"" dress.  In fact, all the women's clothing in the movie looks impeccable from start to finish.  I want to make every dress in this movie.  My only question is why do we have to rely on the import market to get this on DVD??  My version is Chinese (Hong Kong) and while it's great quality, the subtitles that I know were in the VHS version are missing here, which undercuts your understanding of a crucial scene between Kitty and Levin in the second half of the movie.

115269,1,0790731614,"Any attempt to condense Tolstoy's epic into a 110 minute film would be a difficult task, if not impossible, and this proves the point.

Not only does this film fail to convey Tolstoy's plot, it's screenplay is positively laughable.  Every character is one dimensional, and consequently none of it makes any sense.  The result is the viewer doesn't care about any of the characters - the viewer is only wanting all of them to die and for the movie to end as soon as possible.  This is not a Merchant-Ivory production !

What is even more staggering is the casting.  The directors miscast actors with a melange of accents from British to French to broad American, while also managing to get some real actors - one can only imagine that the credible actors were paid most handsomely, or were given a different script to what ended up after editing was completed.  Either way, I don't think any of them would be putting this tripe on their resume.

Granted, the costumes were nice, but costumes without meaningful dialogue and multi-dimensional characters is not enough to sustain a film.

110 minutes of my life that could have been better spent.  My suggestion : read the book - much more satisfying.

Sophie Marceau is beautiful as Anna but lacks the acting ability to play such a complex character. Sean Bean as Vronsky and Sophie Marceau have great chemistry. The film has sparks of greatness but fails. Some scenes like the ball scence and Anna's death are beautifuly shot and succeed and most others just seem lukewarm. Levin story is cut to only to a few minutes they probably should have not included him and just focused on Anna's story in my opinion. It pains me to say this but the film is wort buying if only for the visuals. I watch my copy on mute most of the time listing to Air.",1213401600,2,791,4.462068965517242
115271,3,0790731614,"Before seeing this adaptation of ANNA KARENINA, I'd been fortunate to see the Greta Garbo version; the TV adaptation starring Nicola Pagett and the TV adaptation with Helen McCrory.  These all have good things about them.  For one, you can't really go wrong with the story:  a beautiful young woman, married to an older man for convenience, falls desperately in love for the first time with a young officer, and he with her.

And this version... The chemistry between Sean Bean and Sophie Marceau is there and they both give excellent performances.  James Fox also makes an excellent, not totally unsympathic Karenin (thankfully miles above Basil Rathbone's stone cold performance in the Greta Garbo version.)  And Alfred Molina is, hands down, the best Levin I can ever remember.  He looks great, too; very trim & handsome.

Also, the hair, makeup, costumes, and glorious St. Petersburg setting (with detours to Italy and the Russian countryside) are simply beautiful.  The soundtrack is my next purchase - perfectly chosen pieces of classical music which enhance this film immeasurably.

But...  I have to say the film left me a little cold.  For all the care and attention lavished on the settings and scenery, and for all the good performances, little missteps kept bothering me.  Why did the screenwriter choose to make Anna's daughter die at birth?  Doing this oversimplified the reason(s) for Anna's growing despair and eventual mental breakdown.  Also, without the little daughter, the important fact that Anna couldn't feel even a small particle of the affection for her baby daughter that she has for her son by Karenin is left out.  This lack of affection for her baby increases her feelings of isolation.

Why did the screenwriter bump up the time frame from 1875-77 to 1880-83?  This didn't make much sense to me at all, because a) there's no reason to do this, and, b) Alexei's departure for the Russo-Turkish war (1877-78) after after Anna's suicide, is left out.  Why didn't the screenwriter include the scene where Levin actually meets Anna, and yet have Levin narrate the film if he never meets her?  Odd choices.

I just felt a little distant from the story being told, somehow.  I loved certain individual scenes -- Levin in the fields with his peasants, marvelous; the ball where Anna and Vronsky realize they love each other (to Kitty's despair).  I thought Sean Bean struck exactly the right note as a man loving a woman through an impossible situation, but feeling the frustration caused by her jealousy of his freedom - justifiably so; Anna's jealous because he still has all the freedom to move about in society while she is barred from it.

Somehow, all of the good points in this film never quite came together into one compelling drama.  The elements for an emotionally moving film were there, but while this film is very much worth seeing, it did leave me a bit cold.",1213228800,3,2897,4.887295081967213
115272,1,0790731614,"Sorry, I just couldn't get into this version of the movie. I began watching it on TV this evening.  I've read the book, which is one of the most brilliant classics ever written in my opinion.  I also saw a TV series several years ago starring Nicola Paget. This series, I thought, made a pretty good attempt at being faithful to the book, and Nicola Paget portrayed the beautiful, troubled Anna in a most believable way.

Sophie Marceau, however, was too far removed from what I perceived Anna must have looked and acted like.  Marceau seemed more like an ordinary present day college girl caught in a time warp.  She didn't look particularly beautiful (and those straight bangs didn't help any!) and one couldn't help but wonder why Vronsky would give her a second glance.

Considering the lofty quality of the book, this movie was pretty ordinary.",1212019200,,849,4.741496598639456

Anyone who read the book knows that you cannot make a 2-hour movie from 969-page book without leaving many details out. It is not supposed to be a transcript of the book! I thought everything was done excellently, including the chosen cast and the acting. Perhaps being European I don't need melodramatic scenes of screaming, nudity, explicit love scenes and spilled blood - as Hollywood movies are so ""good"" at - to enjoy my movies. People who wrote the reviews here expected bloody ending, how sad. The movie was done with such a class, so tastefully, yet so powerfully! Sophie Marceau is one of my very favourite actresses and she, as well as others, have done a superb job! The change in languages gave the movie exotic touch and authenticity and a little taste of Russia.  The fact that they mixed French is only a reflection that high class, (educated people nowadays) spoke and used a lot of French in their languages. My language, which is not English, uses French expressions,  simply because it is so apropos.  So, a lot of people here sadly just missed the point. The ""stoic"" characters have to do with culture and time, all perfectly in place. People here wanted to see American drama, that's all.

115276,3,0790731614,"I just watched this movie on video, and was curious what others thought, so I checked out the reviews.  What really stands out to me is how much each individual brings of him or herself to an experience.

You can review several things about the film--how true it was to the book, or, conversely, how entertaining it was on its own; how well-cast you thought the main characters were, and whether or not they had sexual chemistry; and what you thought of the production values and directorial choices such as having the main characters speak Russian to the servants and peasants.  So, acknowledging that what appeals to me might be anathema to someone else, here's what I thought.

I think Sophie Marceau is quite beautiful, and I would have believed that she couldn't resist her attraction to Vronsky, but the script (or editing) jumped so quickly to the affaire that I couldn't quite do it. I was almost convinced, though, because I would have found Sean Bean impossible to resist.  He conveyed perfectly a rather superficial aristocrat, whose first taste of depth and intensity was his response to this beautiful woman, and who couldn't/wouldn't think beyond satisfying his need to experience that feeling.  He didn't seem too old or too cold to me--I thought his eyes expressed quite a bit of heat and passion, even if the script (or again, editing) kept him from expressing them verbally.

The issue of accents is also interesting--I guess, as an American, I can readily accept British and French accents performing a nineteenth century Russian story, but the American ones seem jarring to me--my disbelief is abruptly not suspended any more--it comes roaring back, saying, ""That's an actor, and not a very convincing one, at that.""

The costumes may not have been authentic, I didn't care, I just enjoyed looking at them.  The sets, likewise.  The story was poorly abridged, but I knew before I watched it that it would be, just from the length factor.  The script lacked continuity, but I still found it moderately entertaining on its own terms.  So, would I recommend this movie?  Yes, but with reservations.",1169424000,6,2115,4.890756302521009

Obviously, the director wanted to draw a line between the classes, but to do it so awkwardly... Yes, Russian high classes were used to mix their Russian speach with French, but there has never been such a total language barrier as the director tries to convince us.
I was also surprised to see some good actors giving such totally wooden performances!
I doubt the film gets any better towards the end, though I will never know that for I couldn't bring myself to watch it for long (even out of curiosity) as it pained me greatly to see one of the finest works of literature spoiled so heartlessly.",1154476800,5,881,4.617834394904459

The main supporting actors are also perfectly cast in the parts they play. Every bit of the film is crafted with particular care from start to finish.

The book by Tolstoy is so long, it is brilliant that this film deals with not all of the themes, but centers on the relationships of 3 main couples. A secondary theme is the contrast between false piety displayed by Anna's husband and his friend the self-righteous and self-serving countess, and true piety which grows in the character of Dimitri and his relationship with Kitty. In the end, the unfaithful lovers pay the price for their wilfulness, but even the tragic ending is beautifully played out in the acting and in the way the scene is staged.

Either she just did not 'get' Anna, or the director didn't; either way, the movie reduces to nothing more than a beautiful woman walking thru various scenes. [As was the version with Jaqueline Bisset].

The two great Annas are first, Garbo's (a straight take on the novel, less a romance and more a movie of social mores and the injustice of the divorce laws that was Tolstoy's focus). The second was with Vivian Leigh, done as a deeply romantic tragedy, and much the twin of her equally brilliant, equally tragic, and often overlooked 'Waterloo Bridge'.

I liked this better than any other version of Anna Karenina that I have seen, primarly because of the beautiful cinematography, the glorious music, the extravagantly beautiful interiors and the presence of Sean Bean, who has to be the sexiest Vronsky of all time.  Sophie Marceau was not a bad Anna and at least, unlike some versions I have seen, it wasn't hard to see why she would inspire Vronsky's obsession. And the ballroom scene was one of the most beautiful and sweepingly romantic I have ever seen.  There was a little too much of the Kitty/Levin relationship and Levin's voiceover ramblings were at points pretty boring but the movie overall is really a jewel in every way--very romantic, two beautiful protagonists, exotic settings and a score second to none.",1108944000,48,930,4.693251533742331

Sean Bean, a very talented actor, was put in a choke-hold by the script.  He is capable of far more passion than this screenplay allowed.  Fortunately, I had seen Sophie Marceau prior to this movie, so I know that she is far more capable as well.

115296,2,0790731614,"But first let me say: the production is breathtaking. The costumes are beautiful, the scenery and sets lavish, and the score (music from Tchaikowsky) fits the theme of the story perfectly.
That, however, is pretty much all that can be said. The major problem in transferring 'Anna Karenina' from book to film is that to do so properly requires a good deal more time than 2 hours. This screen adaptation's script is good enough, but it leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Anna's passion and vitality is sadly missing in this film, and a lot of the scenes seem stilted.
This may or may not have to do with the choice of the leading lady. Sophie Marceau is an admirable actress, and has done quite well in other films (notably Braveheart and several French productions), but here she misses the mark completely. The looks on her face, supposed to be deep passion and vivacity, are more reminiscent of how one would look in the dentist's chair. Her Anna is a complete narcissist; when she at last met her end, I almost breathed a sigh of relief.
That said, the men, overall, perform very well. Sean Bean cuts quite a dashing figure as Count Vronsky, the love of Anna's life (and her ultimate downfall). Alfred Molina is excellent as Levin, the everyman and Tolstoy's hero in the story. And James Fox is very, very good as the disregarded Karenin, the husband Anna deserts for Vronsky.
All in all, it may be worth watching (especially for the grand ball scene, which is breathtaking!) but it has the flaws that all adaptations before have had: it is too long to be interesting, but not long enough to cover the story adequately.",1030665600,16,1625,4.645833333333333

I would have preferred someone like Colin Firth or Ralph Fiennes (who played Pushkin's Onegin in a more recent film) as Vronsky and would have preferred to see a more noble looking and youger actor in his role.  I thought Kitty was the most downplayed character, in the book she has a far more important role.  Nonetheless, the love story is believable.  The scenery and the music - Bernard Rose is a master at picking the right music - are perfect.  I thought the choice of Rachmaninov's Elegie (op. 3 no4) was excellent as Vronsky's theme as was the Tchaikovsky waltz for the ballroom scene and the other choral music of the great Russian composers in the background throughout.

115315,1,0790731614,"Let me just say in advance that I am not a harsh critic. When people slammed Hannibal, I defended it, and when people moaned about how dreadful Waterworld was, I insisted it was not nearly as bad as it was painted to be; in summary, I am in general a pretty optimistic person who is willing to see the best in every film. That is, until my patience was tested by Anna Karenina.
I'd read the book and was blown away but it's brilliance, and, knowing full well that no film could ever live up to it, was willing to happily settle for a lot less. A few adequately acted scenes which would bring back memories of the book would have sufficed. But Oh.... My.... God.
The trailer was fairly promising enough: great music, fine cinemaphotography, and a few close-ups of the beautiful Sophie Marceau.... sure, Sean Bean seemed to look a little less dashing than I remembered him in other roles (Lady Chatterley's Lover, for example) but on the whole it was not a bad preview: fast-moving, filled with action and promises of drama and love.
After viewing the film I actually had to question whether I'd seen the right trailer. I logged onto the internet, checked the Anna Karenina site, and played the trailer. Yes, this was the trailer for the awful film I'd just seen; and, interestingly, at least one third of the trailer was edited from the film.
The result of this of course is the trailer being much more entertaining than the film. Save your money and watch that instead. For those who have seen the film already, go back and watch the trailer and look at the stuff they so stupidly edited out in the final cut. And THAT (amongst many other flaws) was the major failing of this film: bad editing. Little snippets which were necessary in maintaining any sort of continuity were eradicated, and I'm at a loss to know why this was done.
The storyline is basically as follows: Levin (given the name of Molina in the film, I think) falls for Kitty: though she is in love with the dashing Count Vronsky and therefore refuses Levin's marriage proposal. Vronsky  (who was never serious in his attentions towards Kitty anyway) meets on a train his friend's sister, Mrs Anna Karenina, and from this point onwards pursues their mutual attraction to the point where it can no longer be concealed by a harsh and judging society. Anna leaves her husband and the son she loves to live with Vronsky where they live happily in the country for some time before returning to Moscow where things slowly fall apart. At the same time, Kitty has made it up with Levin and married him, and at the end of the story we find the characters in a situation reverse to that of their opposing beginnings: Kitty and Levin now happy (despite Levin's personal issues with religion and life) and Vronsky and Anna miserable in their love that can never be quite free. The book was excellently written and the characters so brilliantly depicted you felt their anguish and joy as though it had happened to you.
With the film, however, vital points are left out, the acting is wooden, and the chemistry between the two leads is non-existant. One reviewer was right in saying Marceau's Anna did not seem in love because she simply was not. In fact, if I hadn't seen Sophie Marceau in other films such as Braveheart and D'Artagnan's Daughter, I would have believed her incapable of acting at all. Her performance is wooden, Bean's performance is shallow, and ..... what the hell was going on with the characters and their accents? We're supposed to believe they're all Russians, though we're thrown with such varied accents as French (Marcea), British (Bean), and strong American (the character of Oblonsky, Anna's brother)..... all to the tune of a brilliant snowy Moscow setting. Yeah.
It's so disjointed and the scenes so brief you never get the chance to care for anyone. Actually, during the scene where Anna supposedly succumbs to Vronsky's charms and they make love, it was so stilted and uncomfortable I actually felt bad for the actors. I actually winced. At other times I gasped at little things which were vital to the story that had been left out. For example, we see Kitty looking dismal and being visited by a doctor. And.... that's all we see. No explanation why, no reference to it later on. Just a little unnecessary snippet which makes you go ""Wah...? Bah...?"" like so many other unexplained brief scenes in this film. In fact, in the book you understand Kitty has fallen sick because of the love sickness caused by Vronsky, and as a result she changes into a different person altogether for the rest of the story. But none of this in the film, folks! All we get is a bare back, a doctor with a stethoscope, and Kitty's melancholy face. You assume she is physicallly sick, whereas there is actually nothing physically wrong with her.
I could go on and on about the faults in this film. But don't take my word for it - see it yourself, so you can view firsthand how easy it is to screw up a film on so many levels.",982972800,21,4988,4.598204264870931
115316,4,0790731614,"The initial scene with Molina caught between a pack of wolves and a bear in a pit, really horrors us.  At this anguish moment, his memory about the events of his live tells us his story.  He introduces in the upper class Tzar society of the initial 20th century Russia.  Molina marries a rich maiden, whose love for him was doubtful.  Anna is part of this opulent class, and takes part of the palace parties, whose splendor is the greatest part of the film.  Her love for the military man takes her away from her husband and son.  The final and tragic moment, in this version seems as a mannequin thrown in the rails.  This scene really is a disappointment. Back to Molina, the scene in the pit does not conclude in the film.  We suppose he has been eaten by the bear when he falls down, if we are negative, or if we are positive he had survive when someone shoot at the wolves and rescue him.",976147200,4,893,4.273809523809524

7791540,5,0790731614,"This is a classic story being acted on the screen at least five times. This version is beautifully done with a lot of classic music presented for the viewer. My wife found it depressing but that is what this story is about, life isn't all peaches & cream. Many of the most memorable stories are not all we would wish. ""Madam Butterfly"",  La Boheme"" "" Abelard & Heloise"" all beautiful but tragic. ""Anna Karenina"" is such a story. And if you can tolerate tragedy & appreciate the production of this version of Anna Karenina there is much to enjoy. The scenery is stunning as is the architecture & palatial interiors. Emotions are powerfully portrayed by Sean Bean, Sophie Marceau & James Fox as their internal emotional fights struggle with trying to do what is expected of respectable society. I believe this film is an excellent adaptation of a classic Leo Tolstoy classic & one that should be added to anyone's repertoire.",1515196800,2,923,4.732919254658385

7791547,5,0790731614,"I think I may have seen every version of Anna Karenina ever made for screen and television. It's one of those stories that stays with you. Hope, love, destruction, guilt, jealousy and resolution run through Tolstoy's novel exhibiting his capacity to express real human emotions and motivations on a level comparable to Shakespeare. Readers often say they learn about life from novels, and one of the greatest teachers is Tolstoy.

Five stars to this version.  The screenplay, hampered by time limits, does make some adjustments to the original tale, but remains true to the story. Sophie Marceau is a perfect choice emulating fragility, courage and grief with equal skill.  Sean Bean's Vronsky is a somewhat vain, selfish man, who is humbled and swept away by his own emotions and finds the courage to sacrifice ll for Anna. I especially loved Alfred Molina's Levin, hopeful, tender, thoughtful and forgiving.  A perfectly balanced cast. One pro film reviewer found Marceau's Anna unlikable and tiresome. But to be pragmatic, people who breakdown and become addicted to opium are difficult and tiresome. But they're no less tragic.

Highly recomended.",1483315200,2,1151,5.2
