7979007,2,B0000844L8,"The movie has a boiler plate plot of a hunted individual Huang Chih-yeh (Jacky Liu Hong-yi) whose family was killed by Tiger Kuo (Hau Chiu-sing whose wide cheeks and double chin make him appear much larger than he actually is) who forged Emperor edict and finds refuge in Shaolin temple where he vows revenge on his oppressor, shaves his head and improves his skill (certainly shades of The 36th Chamber of Shaolin and countless other Shaolin films before this).  He is taken into the temple by a drunken muscular monk (Chiang Cheng who is apparently in Bey Logans Snow Blade) who is adept at the staff (drunken and sober) and rope dart.  The monk is not particularly brilliant though as earlier after he literally stumbled over the unconscious body of Huang, he tried to give him alcohol to wake him up.

While our hero Huang becomes a monk and changes his name to Wu Yin, a samurai Lu Shing Yi-pu (Hyeon Kil-su: Shaolin Drunken Monk), who is the best swordsman in Japan according to several sources, is looking to honorably test his skill against any one he can.  Earlier Huang had saved the samurais life and I will bet that somehow it will mean something later in the film though not as much as you might think.

It has a couple of hilarious plot issues.  Miss Yeda (Guk Jeong-suk: Postman Strikes Back) is a sister of a samurai who has spent a considerable time in the woods (over a year at least) looking for her brother.  She has new clothes that never age and are immensely clean including the white portions; she has perfect makeup and hair.  The first time she is introduced to the story the other actors look to be stifling a laugh and trying to look incredulous at the absurdity of a Japanese outsider alone in the woods.  There is a tease of a relationship later with the main character and I do not think she ever finds her brother.  Also Tiger Kuo has to be one of the most forgiving antagonists in the ineptitude of his cohorts.  Kuo almost falling for the head monks line theres nobody here by that name (dealing with Huang whose name was change) was pretty funny as well. Of course, we do not always watch these films for their storyline.

Random thought: sometimes when I watch mass training sequences in these Shaolin films I see background characters who are much more skilled martial artists than the main actors.

While not a good film in its use of camera, acting, music, under-cranking, and coherent storyline though I like that the samurai and his sister were sympathetic Japanese characters, it does have several good martial artists.  There is not much worse in cinema than a low budget martial arts movie with non-martial artists.  The swordplay and hand-to-hand skirmishes early on are many but too short and are lacking in choreography and skill especially when you see a three-section staff that makes you yearn for Chris Farley in Beverly Hills Ninja. But it progressively gets better in the last half hour and the almost ten minute action finale comes off well with an unexpected finishing move. Expect the abrupt ending though. This movie is mainly for the dedicated martial arts fan that loves disappearing and reappearing ninjas as much as I do and does not have much else to watch. I have already seen it several times.

The Eastern Heroes copy is a shoddy full-screen release with English dubbing.  Dark scenes are quite dark.  It has an extra of Bonus Fights of other Eastern Heroes releases (7 Commandments of Kung Fu, Drunken Arts and Crippled Fist, The World of Drunken Master, Snake Deadly Act and Unbeaten 28).  I dislike that many of these Ground Zero DVDs do not have disc art or even the movie name.  You have to flip it over and check the center circle to see it named as Shaolin Drunken (yes it is missing the full name.) The cover also has an image that is not in the movie with Hau Chiu-sing having shurikens in his eyes (same headband and outfit as in the film.)",1377216000,,3915,4.605755395683453
7979008,1,B0000844L8,"the movie quality is horrible. the movie was just ok. obviously with this moviue being so cheap, its cheap for a reason. i would not recommend this product, or any of the eastern conder movies, i also would not recommed any of the 'wu tang' rap group hosted movies, they are really bad too.",1302220800,,290,4.388888888888889
7979009,4,B0000844L8,"This is a fine transfer, nice copy, dubbed.. I don't see anything to complain about plus it's a decent old school fu movie.

I can readily complain about several fu films ive ordered from various companies, but this simply isn't one of them..",1151884800,,242,4.627906976744186
7979010,3,B0000844L8,"The copy I have was released by Eastern Heros, and it's very clear, the dvd transfer is really good.  I have reservations when people come on Amazon to preview a flick, and score it simply on the picture, and or the dvd transfer,,,,,that is such a dis-service to the flcik itself.  IF YOU HAVE A PERSONAL BIAS TOWARDS A CERTAIN COMPANY, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR IT. This is about reviewing movies based on 4 elements: The story (PLot), the cororgraphy/ Cinematography, The Quality and the overall production of the flick.  Accordingly,,there are people out there who actually read these reviews before going out to buy a movie!

This is actually a decent flick, certainly would not have make my top 10,,,but the drunken fights and training literally sold the movie for me!!!",1149897600,,775,4.7611940298507465
