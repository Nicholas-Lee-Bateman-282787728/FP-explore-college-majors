7876768,3,6304731728,"Early in his film career, Daniel Bernhardt wasn't content with his simple ""karate man"" image and sought to become a more rounded action hero. This resulted in ""True Vengeance"", a movie which lifts many ideas from Arnold Schwarzenegger's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Commando/dp/B000RW3VCK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Commando</a>&nbsp;but is nevertheless one of the better Bernhardt-starring flicks out there - possibly the best for those who don't care for his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport/dp/B00006RCOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport</a>&nbsp;sequels. Released during the final days of the golden age of home video, it's an above-average little DTV action movie but not a great one. It has no major flaws which keep it from a higher rating but rather a bunch of little irritating ones that bog the film down and keep it from being as likeable as it should be.

The story: when the daughter of ex-Navy officer Allen Griffin (Bernhardt) is kidnapped by his father-in-law - a Yakuza lord (George Cheung,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rambo-First-Blood-Part-2/dp/B0004Z33EQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rambo: First Blood, Part 2</a>) - he's forced to assassinate a CEO as part of a deal with the mobster. Upon being double-crossed by the kidnappers, he needs to evade federal agents as he battles through underground forces en route to saving his daughter.

It sounds similar to that Schwarzenegger movie, doesn't it? Daniel even dresses like Arnold in this one, complete with a sleeveless black vest. But unlike Schwarzenegger, Bernhardt pads up his adventure with martial arts fisticuffs, motorcycle chases, and John Woo-inspired gunplay. Curb your excitement, though, since they're not all entirely satisfying thrills: of the 'round three or four hand-to-hand fights, none best Daniel's initial match with B-movie kicker Leo Lee (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Perfect-Weapon/dp/630213014X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Perfect Weapon</a>) for choreography and technical efficiency; the motorcycle chase is pretty decent, with the stuntmen engaging in some pretty reckless driving, but it's too drawn out for the effect to last; and the one real Woo-inspired shootout isn't choreographed well enough for suspension of disbelief to cover Griffin's level of invincibility. The co-finale featuring Bernhardt wielding a sword and trading kicks with fellow action hero Miles O'Keeffe (from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ator/dp/B0001YSGWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ator</a>&nbsp;movies) helps end the film on an explosive note, but the action content still feels a bit lacking. Compared to the regular offerings of someone like Jeff Wincott or Billy Blanks, Daniel Bernhardt's directors still had a lot to learn about finding a harmonious balance between action hero and martial artist.

The production is strong, despite the visibility of budgetary constraints. A lot of the locales (e.g. the tattoo parlor) don't look scouted but still fit; so it's easy to imagine a crewmember saying ""Hey, I know this cool-looking place in town; let's shoot there."" The in-film world doesn't seem as heavily populated due to the presence of only minimal extras, but this is forgivable. The supporting cast is mainly highlighted by the evil Asians (including Roger Yuan of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shanghai-Noon/dp/B00003CXJ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shanghai Noon</a>) but Beverly Johnson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crossworlds/dp/1573623865/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crossworlds</a>) also adds herself to the mix as a detective tracking Griffin; her role isn't really necessary and I got the feeling she's mainly there to counter Rae Dawn Chong's character from the Schwarzenegger movie, but she makes the most of it despite getting in on next to none of the action.

Truth be told, the movie doesn't have a lot of personality because Daniel Bernhardt doesn't have much of one in here: he plays the vengeful father/soldier role so well that he really doesn't need any time to expand his character, and thus the movie also remains very single-layered. Regardless, all shortcomings considered, this is still a good film for fans of the man to enjoy and one of the all-around better offerings from director David Worth's post-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kickboxer/dp/0783114885/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kickboxer</a>&nbsp;career.
