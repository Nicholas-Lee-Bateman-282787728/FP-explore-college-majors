1852808,5,B00008LDZW,"Like others who reviewed this DVD, I'm a long-time Firm user who is fast becoming a convert to the new Firm workouts.  This one is particularly unique in that it works only the core.  It's a quick 25-minute workout (including stretch and cool down) so you can squeeze it in easily throughout the day.  It's a great complement to the Fast and Firm workouts that don't include abs.",1099872000,7,379,4.544117647058823
1852809,5,B00008LDZW,and actually the first one i have enjoyed but felt my abs have been worked.,1099180800,,75,4.066666666666666
1852810,5,B00008LDZW,"I am an old fan of the VHS with the earlier instructors (susan, janet gretsky, etc.) and she's absolutely right.  These workouts are just as effective and a little easier to get through, than the older ones.  Those older one's were straight RIDICULOUS!  I thought I would have to join the Marines afterwards.  I have to admit though, the were more effective than everything that I've ever done before.  These are more fun and there's more variety.  I do have to say that the stretching exercises leave much to be desired.  As someone who used to run track, these stretching after these tough workouts aren't long enough to really loosen your muscles and really increase your flexibility, but that's a small criticism in light of all that you DO get from these videos.  I've tried almost every fad workout there is at least once, and none of them are as serious and effective as these.",1096329600,3,884,4.658064516129032
1852811,5,B00008LDZW,"I love the Firm workout tapes.  I used them before my wedding trying to get fit.  They really do work in 10 workouts or less!  Once I had my baby, I started using them again, and with no doubt, they worked!  This is the only workout that I really enjoy, I don't have to work out for 2 or 3 hours to get the effective results.  I think about this workout when I'm not doing it, and I really enjoy it!  I recommend this and any other tapes from the series to anyone.  Trust me, you just put in the work, and the workouts do the rest!  They're not easy, but they are effective!",1086220800,,574,3.973684210526316
1852812,5,B00008LDZW,"I added this tape to my ab rotation workout.  It definitely gives your abs a great, all around, workout.  I like this video because the people actually look like real people instead of Barbie dolls.  They also show you a modified version for beginners.  The moves are both challenging and very effective.  A great workout for your lower and upper abs and for your back.  Be sure to do the cool down stretch at the end so that you are not sore the next day or so.  A great buy.",1073520000,3,476,4.222222222222222
1852813,5,B00008LDZW,"I am a firm believer and this tape is one of my core tapes.  I try to tie this in with my total body workouts AT LEAST once a week, sometimes 2!
As a cronic back pain sufferer, this workout has really helped stretch my back and strenghen both my abs and back.  You can't go wrong with this tape!!!
It goes by quickly and other than Lisa's voice being a little annoying at times, the tape is close to PERFECT!  A must have for your rotation!",1070064000,2,440,4.0344827586206895
1852814,5,B00008LDZW,"Meow!  As a user of older Firm videos, I purrrrsonally think these new workouts are alot better. Why? Because they don't make you feel burned out like older FIRM videos did. They are just right. And in two shakes of a cat's tail, you can get a great ab workout with this program. There are some great moves that challenged this cat. I was a two twenty pound dumbell user on the heaviest with the older firm tapes, and the new tapes challenged me! It's just that they don't leave me ready for a cat nap, just ready for action! I feel energized to make it through my day. I found the core strengthening on this workout highly effective, and the music was awesome! definitely worth your money.

1852815,5,B00008LDZW,"I wouldn't go so far as to say that this video is easy.  But while most ab routines leave you sore afterward, this one does a good job of letting you feel that you're working while you're working and not for hours or days afterward - it's easy to pick it up again the next day.  The workout features a good mix of upper, lower and oblique work as well as some balancing.  The routine also features a person for beginners to follow so you don't overdo it.  The fanny lifter is not essential here as it is only used as something to rest your feet on - a chair or high stool works fine.  If you fast forward through the intro material and the breathing exercises, the routine only takes up 15-20 minutes of your time making it easier to fit it into your day or alongside of a regular workout.",1049760000,37,789,4.1644736842105265
1852826,5,B00008LDZW,I have used this series for twenty years. It is a wonderful workout that really gets results if you do it consistently. You can add your treadmill work or what ever your preference. It always gives you 3 levels to choose from based on age and physical condition.,1466812800,2,262,4.479166666666667
1852827,5,B00008LDZW,Lisa is a very good instructor & easy to follow.  Also a good workout to pair with another workout if need to do extra abs.,1453939200,,123,3.92

1852829,5,B00008LDZW,This is one of my favorite workouts.  My VHS version wore out and I was glad to find this DVD version.,1439510400,,102,3.857142857142857
1852830,5,B00008LDZW,Love it workout all the time with the firm videos,1438646400,,49,4.0
1852831,2,B00008LDZW,"I have almost every Firm video made for the past 20 years. I love The Firm!
But this one falls a little short for me as an ab workout.  It takes too long (30 minutes) and is not intense at all. The Firm 5-Day Abs DVD is much, much better.",1428969600,,238,3.76
1852832,5,B00008LDZW,Great AB workout if you're a beginner or advanced. You can always tailor the workout to suit your needs.,1424649600,,104,4.526315789473684

1852854,5,B00008LDZW,I have slowly begun to exchange all my VHS tapes for dvds of The Firm.  I have been working out with The Firm for many years.,1389052800,,125,3.8076923076923075
1852855,5,B00008LDZW,I had this system on VHS years ago. It's the only workout method I've used that gave me the abs I always wanted.,1385856000,,112,3.9130434782608696
1852856,5,B00008LDZW,This work out is easy to follow.  I've been using it for years.  I wore out the video tape and had to order the DVD.  The people leading the work out are pleasant to work out with and I  don't get tired of it.,1378857600,,209,3.6818181818181817
1852857,5,B00008LDZW,I purchased this to replace my VHS from many years ago. I really like this workout and in my opinion it works! Also you don't really need the fanny lifter to do it so you can take it when traveling.,1377302400,,198,3.975
1852858,4,B00008LDZW,"I did this workout yesterday and my abs are pretty sore today! The one bad thing I have to say about this workout is that the host has a pretty thick southern accent which I find a little distracting. And you don't need a ""fanny lifter"" a decent chair or stool works just fine.",1366329600,,277,4.148148148148148
1852859,5,B00008LDZW,I had this workout before on vhs and it really works. You get noticable results in a short amount of time. I was so glad I found this workout on dvd.,1347235200,,149,3.838709677419355
1852860,5,B00008LDZW,My VHS tape finally broke so I was very happy to get this on dvd. It's a great workout and I recommend it.,1338508800,,106,3.652173913043478
1852861,5,B00008LDZW,"Ive used this in 2003 & Im using it again now and it continues to be the only ab workout that is successful for me. When I used it in '03,I lost 35 pounds in less than 3 months with diet and other exercise. Since Ive started using it again,Ive already lost almost 15 pounds with diet and other exercise also and it remains the only ab workout for me that has just great results. PLus,Its only a 30 mins long for other busy moms out there. It arrived in great condition & packaging tho it did take about 2-3 weeks to get to me which was the longest Ive ever had to wait to get anything from Amazon but Id wait months for an awesome video like this one.",1320278400,2,651,4.015384615384615
1852872,5,B00008LDZW,"My mom had bought the entire Firm system years ago. The AB Sculpt video was my favorite. It has been a while since I used it and of course lost the video. So excited I found it on here and I can't wait until I get it! It really works and you can feel it, I recommend it to everyone!!",1309996800,,283,3.7333333333333334
1852873,5,B00008LDZW,This DVD is great I have been doing the excercise every other day for 30 minutes and i have lost my tummy fat and also i lost fat in my other part of the body. just a reminder that i also eat healthy food. give it a try if you want to lose ab fat.,1296086400,,247,3.5090909090909093
1852874,2,B00008LDZW,"I have tried many FIRM workouts and I consider myself to be a ""Firm Believer"". I got this workout in a box set of 3 (with Cardio Sculpt & Body Sculpt) and this one is my least favorite. I found it to be kind of boring and it didn't really challenge me. Afterwards I felt like I still needed to do another ab workout. I do not have abs of steel by any means. I have a LOOOONG ways to go before my abs are even near perfect, but I have other Firm videos that I feel give me a much better ab workout such as 5 Day Abs.",1293667200,2,515,3.7339449541284404
1852875,5,B00008LDZW,"Okay, this video is a real workout.  You start to feel your abs burning within the first few moves!  I'm really glad I bought this dvd.",1247788800,,135,4.153846153846154
1852876,5,B00008LDZW,I have used this product in VHS for years.  I literally wore the video tape out.  Now I have a new DVD player and searched for the DVD version as  I love this ab workout.  I began using the tape in my 50's.  I am now in my 60's and it has solved low back pain problems for me as well as giving me definition that I have never had in my life.  I highly recommend this product.,1229385600,,375,3.7435897435897436
1852877,3,B00008LDZW,"But it isn't as challenging as it could be. Don't get me wrong, I still do this tape, but it just leaves something to be desired. It could be tougher, and it's not like I'm in super-great shape or anything (and, yes, I use proper form).",1168214400,,236,4.1521739130434785
1852878,5,B00008LDZW,"We got this as part of the 3-pack Body Sculpting System and it's my favorite DVD of the three.  Unlike most of The Firm routines, it uses no weights and there is no impact cardio in it - just very mild warm-up.  An emphasis on breathing and a lot of stretching in between various sets of exercises makes it an ab routine that is easy on the body and prevents the neck strain you often feel with long sets of ab exercises.

I found the focus on proper breathing technique to enhance form to be very instructive and beneficial.  The instructor is Lisa Kay and her cueing is excellent and her manner so calming that I actually find the routine soothing to do.  I've done this routine on my rest day if I'm feeling muscle soreness in my back or shoulders that a little stretching might help.  Besides, I'm waging war on abs that were so far gone they were declared a disaster area by the President and it's gonna take a lot of work and maybe a miracle.

I use The Firm's 5 Day abs on my cardio days or after weight training tapes that don't have an Abs section - but only if I don't have time for Ab Sculpt, which is 25 minutes.  I think the routine is excellent, but it seems deceptively easy because of the way the exercises are broken up and because of the stretching in between the sets.  I've felt muscle soreness the day after the tape, which tells me it's effective.",1139097600,15,1369,4.254826254826255
1852879,1,B00008LDZW,"From the reviews of the other Firm videos, I thought this would be a five-star video, too.  However, for someone who needs any sort of a challenge, this will be a joke.  I kept waiting for a challenging exercise.  What I got was more stretching.  I couldn't figure out if I bought a yoga video by accident.  If you have never worked out before, this video is great start.  However, if you are even a beginner, the four exercises they do for abs will not give you any results.  At a beginner level, this will bore you.",1135123200,,517,4.268041237113402
1852880,5,B00008LDZW,All firm videos are great.. This Ab sculpt is no different. IF you have been working out for a while it may seem easy plus there are other ab workouts from the firm that you can go with for more of a challenge I am a Firm believer.,1115510400,2,231,3.8333333333333335
1852881,5,B00008LDZW,"I first time I did this video, I thought it was incredibly easy. The next time I did it, I paid particular attention to my form and it kicked my [...] Firm master instructor Lisa Kay starts off with some breathing exercises and then moves you into a core and abdominal workout. You will do some basic crunches mixed in with leg pulleys and other pilates-inspired moves.

They use the Firm Fanny Lifter for positioning on some of the exercises. You could do without it or use a regular step if you didn't have the Fanny Lifter.

This workout lasts for less than 30 minutes, which makes it the perfect addition to one of the Firm's 30 minute cardio workouts, such as Express Cardio or Fat Blasting Cardio. When I finish this, I feel relaxed and stretched out. That is a wonderful way to feel after a workout!",1101081600,9,806,4.4391891891891895
7985477,5,B00008LDZW,"I love this dvd. It isn't very long but it does what it says, sculpts the abs. I don't have one of their fanny lift stools but an ottoman or a stool works just as well. They give clear instruction between one move and another, some videos don't give you that, it's just a bunch of jumping from one thing to another with you just trying to keep up, get ticked off and let the dust collect on the dvd. So far there will be no dust collecting on this one.",1523577600,,452,3.978021978021978
7985478,1,B00008LDZW,This was not what I was looking for. Something that must of been taped back in the 80s. Very Cheesy/ditzy instructors. They even use a fanny stool of some sort. Hilarious!,1520553600,,171,4.548387096774194
7985479,5,B00008LDZW,"These videos will kick your butt, but you will feel so satisfied afterwards.  I used this video along with the Body Sculpt and Cardio Sculpt when I was preparing to go into the military.  These definitely helped me be physically prepared for bootcamp.  I bought these again because 1. I no longer have a VCR to play the old ones (I know, I'm old) and 2. after having 2 kids, I really want to get back in shape.  These will definitely help with that.

7985483,5,B00008LDZW,"This is the THIRD AND LAST of this ""BODY SCULPTING SYSTEM"". This entire program is done on the floor except for the ""WARM UP"" AND THE ""COOL DOWN"". This part of THE  Program is HOSTED AND LEAD BY INSTUCTOR LISA KAY. And as before, there's ALLY, JENNIFER, CHRISTA, AND LIBBY. LIBBY IS THE INSTRUCTOR WHO DEMONSTRATES THE EXERCISES IN A MODIFIED WAY. For this Program a FLOOR MAT, ALONG WITH THE FANNY LIFTER IS NEEDED. ANY ADJUSTABLE STEP FOR THIS PROGRAM WILL DO.

I found ""AB SCULPT"" to be very effective toward slimming and shaping ""THE ENTIRE TUMMY AREA"", though I hadn't used this program in years, and it's my THIRD COPY. The second one in ""DVD FORMAT. The exercises aren't to difficult and they're over fairly quickly. ""NO WEIGHTS ARE USED"" in this last installment. This is probably a relief to ""THE FIRM FANS"". It certainly is for me, since weights are used in both of the other programs. This is ""THE SHORTEST PROGRAM"" of the three. It can perhaps be teamed up with another half of an hour program, if time is permitted. Just not with one of the other two, because teamed with either of those will bring one's exercising time up to about an hour and fifteen minutes or more of ""EXERCISING TIME"". I wonder how come they are exercising in shoes, since no weights or aerobics are done! And this is an ""ON THE FLOOR EXERCISING PROGRAM"". The ""WARM UP"" is done sitting on the ""FANNY LIFTER"". The ""COOLING DOWN"", is done standing up. I suppose it would have looked silly putting shoes and socks back on, stretching out the finishing up of the program. But I don't use shoes for this program. I stand on the mat with my bare feet for ""THE COOL DOWN"". Just before I get down on the floor, I quickly take my shoes off.

In conclusion, though I've said it before: ""THE FIRM"" is among the best EXERCISE PROGRAMS AROUND. As I've used, use and have tried many other programs, ""THE FIRM"" is still among my all around ""FAVORITE EXERCISE PROGRAMS"". I WOULD SUGGEST ""THE FIRM"" TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO GET INTO SHAPE WITHOUT USING ALOT OF TIME.",1468886400,2,2032,4.486486486486487
