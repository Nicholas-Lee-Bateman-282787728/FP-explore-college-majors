4401104,1,B004LBA04U,"Do not waste your valuable time and money watching anything that features Jason Martell. I am a fan of Zecharia Sitchin. To quote a review written by ""Matthew"" for the Ancient Planet X DVD which also features Mr. Martell;

""Martell claims to be one of Sitchin's insiders. If anything I think Sitchin was too nice to flick this guy off like a bug if this was the case. Martell is neither a Sumerian scholar, nor is he really that well versed in the complexity that is the ancient alien theory. He's also got the conceit of a 12 year old pageant-goer. Anyway, my money got sucked in before I knew who he was or that he was just about doing a bad attempt at taking credit for Sitchin's work, but I'd recommend picking up ANY Sitchin DVD or Book and you'd learn much, much more than you would by picking up this crap"".

I couldn't say it any better. To bad Matthew hadn't reviewed this DVD before I bought it.",1315958400,5,905,4.317647058823529
4401105,1,B004LBA04U,"I bought this DVD in the hope that it would make Mr Renaissance Man review at least outdated.

But truth be said: he is right. This DVD is a very poor rendition of a very interesting discussion theme.

With that said, I am also very disappointed with Jason Martell's lectures presented in this DVD. It feels like Mr Martell in spite of his extensive (superficial at times) knowledge on Sumerian Culture is stuck with just one thing to say: that the Annunaki created human beings. This is just a minimal portion of what is told in The Earth Chronicles by the late Zecharia Sitchin, which include references to the colonization of Mars and (possibly) Venus by the Annunaki. Isn't it a very good venue for investigating the mysteries around these two neighbors of planet Earth?

I had read the entire Earth Chronicles when they were first published, way before all the fuss about the Annunaki/Nibiru/2012 etc (by the way, in one of the Earth Chronicles, Zecharia Sitchin mentions a Roman coin circa 80 AD that probably depicts the passing of Nibiru through our solar system, which means - assuming Nibiru's orbit is constant - it will only come back again around 3680 AD and just for coincidence sake is arguably about the time Nostradamus predicted the end of the world, i.e. 3700 AD). and I think there is a richness of exploration in there and we should not be only looking at the creation of human beings by the Annunaki to be their slaves.

In reading the Earth Chronicles, I came to believe that the Annunaki (except for Enki/EA, who deserves my respect) are not benign at all towards humanity and I truly hope the Igigi (the ""greys"", the Watchers, possibly another race enslaved by the Annunaki) had revolted and destroyed the Annunaki.

Sorry for the digression and back to this DVD: The most interesting part of the DVD is the lecture about Mars given by a scholar who the producers of this DVD didn't even care introducing him to the audience. He actually starts correcting Mr Martell on an Akkadian seal (which Martell presented as ""Sumerian"") and explaining that there is a possibility the seal depicts a solar system other than the one we live in. Then, he really catches the audience's breath with his views and opinions about Mars. Very convincing and awesome indeed. Unfortunately, the DVD cuts his lecture in the middle as if this portion of the DVD was just a *stuffing* to avoid having much free space in Disc 1 for surely the other Martell's lecture on Disc 2 would not fit on Disc 1. By the way, the second disc is just a repetition of disc 1's Martell's lecture, given some other place, some other day, but essentially the same.

This set does not deserve a single star.",1313712000,12,2689,4.662447257383966
4401106,1,B004LBA04U,"This is a very low budget, TOTALLY UNEDITED video of a synposium on Anceint Astronaut theory.  There were MANY MINUTES where the video camera recorded NOTHING BUT A PODIUM. The producers spent absolutely no effort in the production value of the product. They have no business charging for this video. If the producers had hired some talented middle scoolers to edit it it would have been much better.

If you want an exceptionally entertaining, mind blowing videos series on Ancient Astronaut Theory then I would reccomend the History Channel series, season 1 and 2.",1313280000,22,566,5.01063829787234
4401107,5,B004LBA04U,"Jason Martell is a distant, third cousin of mine; though we've never met, we share the same fascination with the Ancient Astronaut Theory.
This work is highly entertaining, informative and will cause you to doubt the history that you were taught in school!

If you enjoy thinking out-of-the-box, then, don't miss this chance to add this DVD to your collection.

I highly recommend it just for the thrill factor if nothing else!

4401108,4,B004LBA04U,I was amazed at how we can go back and find out so much information from artifacts found centuries ago. The stories that these clay pieces can tell about the original gods and civilizations that developed and how they communicated was very exhilarating. I was fascinated by the information provided in this DVD.,1307059200,12,311,4.886792452830188

of the world around us so if we see anything like it government has deniability",1399161600,,182,3.8157894736842106
8434175,4,B004LBA04U,I have watched the previous set of dvds in this series and had learned a lot. This turned out to be a great part 2 and companion piece to the first set. More in depth info on the gods living amongst the ancient Sumerians.,1368921600,,221,4.045454545454546
8434176,5,B004LBA04U,Having watched the first series of these dvds I ordered this with great anticipation. I was not disappointed. Like the first series it was packed with super information. The alien and ufos buffs should definitely pick up a copy of this,1368835200,,235,4.7560975609756095
8434177,5,B004LBA04U,"The product arrived before it was supposed to and it was in better condition than the advert said it would be. This is good stuff, our population needs to hear this information because there are quite few out there that are still in the dark.",1359244800,,242,4.4

8434179,1,B004LBA04U,"Nice introductory music, then the presentation goes downhill from there. I have never seen such a poorly organized and inapt presentation on any subject. The presenters do not try to take anything out of context because there is no context to take it out of. To give this presentation its length things are repeated and repeated and repeated. There is very little background as to where they get their obscure charts and graphs. I felt like I was watching the spam conspiracy; where they zero in on a monkey face on Mars and see a piece of span in its teeth.

The presenters include Roger Leir (Host), Jason Martell (UFO Researcher), and Tom Van Flandern (Astronomer). They specialize in this sort of presentation. You might remember Roger Leir from ""Penn & Teller: Bullshit!"" (TV series documentary.)

For those of you who want to know what you've just bypassed, the title says it all. It is sort of a play on words, planet X, X standing for 10 or the mysterious missing 10th planet. (A little spooky music here.)",1345852800,2,1014,4.691011235955056
8434180,1,B004LBA04U,"If you are thinking of buying this DVD, don't. As with ""Our extra terrestrial Legacy"" DVD.  It is a very amateur video of a stage speech, unedited for DVD.  The speakers seem unprepared, visuals are childlike overhead projections, sound quality is very bad, often fading.  Some of the information is interesting but nothing that someone who is truly interested in this subject does not already know. Very disappointing and a total waste of money !!!  There are many more worthy DVD's on offer - such as the Ancient Alien Series 1, 2 & 3",1331769600,,536,4.670212765957447
8434181,3,B004LBA04U,"This is 2 DVDs, 180 minutes in all.  The first one is Jason Martell and Dr. Tom Van Flandern at the Central Coast UFO-Symposium of 2008 and shows two lengthy lectures/slide shows.  Planet X is believed to be the place where the aliens are coming from, the ones who've been influencing human history perhaps?  Or maybe the aliens who are our ancestors?  The second DVD is a recording of Jason Martell again at the LA Conscious Life Expo of 2007.  Basically the theory is that there were visitors from other planets who were called gods, far back in history, and we can see evidence of this across cultures in history.  Some of this borders on science, but much of it is speculation.  Images of crosses, flying gods, angels disappearing into the heavens--all of these are fodder for this theory.  One possibility is that Planet X was once a part of our solar system, or perhaps Earth and Mars were once one, split apart by a cataclysmic event.  So far, despite all our probes to Mars, there's no evidence for this...or is there?  Is there a cover-up?  Why?  Are there structures on Mars that indicate our ancestors lived there?  Shared history?  If you don't mind getting your information from a simple filmed lecture-slide show, this is a great introduction to this fascinating idea.

But the real pleasure (and disappointment) of this collection is mentioned by Paulo H ""pyh"" in his review: the middle lecture, (cruelly cut off after a half-hour) by the late Dr. Tom Van Flandern, who is a real scientist and an excellent lecturer.  You do have to pay attention to the introduction to catch his name (and Jason Martell's for that matter.)  It's too bad we don't get the full lecture but what's there is terrific.  I'm going to try to see more and read more from Dr. Van Flandern--the real stuff, I think.",1321660800,2,1804,4.655063291139241
