The girl dressed In boys clothes and hanging out with the gang and everyone trying to be POLITE is must comical. ADDED fun is the only ""witness"" to the actual murder is a disabled wheel chair bound man......one of the VERY best by the GANG look for a man blinking Morse code as a big clue to help...in the murder plot. 4 STARS.....",1406419200,,691,4.3076923076923075
7988365,4,B00008Z48J,"Another early ""East Side Kids"" version of the Bowery Boys and/or the Dead End Kids....just look at that cast, you'll understand.

Good story (and script) about stricken grandfather (of the First Girl ever to be initiated into Muggs' gang) who helps solve a murder - up until that point being pinned on gang member Jordan - by communicating in a special way with returning home Soldier Noah Beery, Jr., well known as character actor on TV into the '70s, notably with James Garner in The Rockford Files, who manages to decipher the code.

""Scruto"" gets a lot of good lines here, minus the stereotyping in some features in this series. And watch for his amazing jitterbug with ""Glimpie""!

Also watch for a nice, albeit short, scene with the feisty ""Mrs. Glimpie"" (guess who's Mother?), Patsy Moran, who is known for work with Laurel and Hardy, with Lucille Ball, et. al.",1365379200,2,867,4.766666666666667
7988366,3,B00008Z48J,"There are two types of people- those that like the East Side/Dead End/Bowery Boys movies and those that don't.
If you fall into the former, then the question becomes - how bad is the print? These are not bad prints, not great, but until somebody ponies up the money to do a professional remaster, it is the best we can get.
If you are a fan, enjoy- if not- save your money",1362355200,3,372,4.180555555555555

From our 4 year-old flower girl to our 1 year-old nephew, this is a favorite among everyone we've bought a copy for.  We even kept one for ourselves.  This is the sweetest, most adorable gift for any young dog and cat lover.",1044748800,2,438,4.45
