8039042,5,B0002JW430,"This may seem dated, but only the equipment and video style is old-school. The material (content) and the idea of showing positions with just pawns is cutting edge - it was repeated in the recent Sokolov Middlegame video. Seirawan shows why he was the best US player in the world for so long and why he is still the best teacher.",1502150400,,329,4.409836065573771
8039043,5,B0002JW430,"Principles are throughly covered here! It lends itself well to learning how to think.
I give it a good rating based on those concepts alone.
Seirawan is an excellent teacher!",1494633600,,174,4.833333333333333
8039044,5,B0002JW430,Excellent dvd- but I agree with other reviewer it is best for beginner and intermediate level players who still need to learn rules to play better.  It actually consists of both volume 1 and volume 2.  So it is cost effective to get this one.  It fits well with his Winning Chess book series.  Has anyone looked at volume 3 yet--Kasparov vs deep blue match (so far no reviews on that DVD),1446854400,,388,4.347222222222222

8039046,5,B0002JW430,"My husband plays at the expert level, and this is the one video that he would recommend to anyone who wants to vastly improve their chess. My son's play improved after watching this just a couple times! He is 8 years old and it is clear and simple enough for him to follow & understand. It is worth it for the 4 elements alone.",1386460800,4,327,4.125
8039047,5,B0002JW430,"This video, for beginners and intermediates, is simply put the best how to play and improve at chess video out there - and that is out of the thousands available,It is a start to finish, no frills, all information,  chess video that teaches chess, and how to not only play chess,but how to practice chess and how NOT TO PRACTICE CHESS, how to STUDY chess and how NOT to study chess. If one knew the contents of this video by heart (not an impossible feat) and played a few games at regular time controls weekly, one could easily reach candidate if not master level play! I know many under 1000 rated players who own 200 or more chess ""books"" that teach little to nothing but the flash of a brilliant win and hang off of the oft mistaken idea that ""tactics are 99 percent of chess"" - a grave misnomer. There is a place these amatuers should go, where all amatuers should go -  This video, again, aged (look at Yaz' suit! NICE Yaz!) is still THE PRIMER FOR THOSE WHO WANT A WINNING GAME, not a losing or drawing game. There is just simply no better all round primer ANYWHERE at any price. Buy it, practice it, use a notebook to filter it, and you're on your road to Masters level, guaranteed!!!!!",1292457600,5,1194,4.349775784753363
8039048,3,B0002JW430,My problem with this DVD is simply that it is misrepresented. There is to much false advertising. The name prochess is a misnomer. Seriwan also claims that this product is also useful to masters. I honestly think thats stretching it a bit. Although I must admit there are some concepts that masters might not be aware of such the master pawn strecture that is neatly illustrated in his game Tal. Nevertheless his overall approach and chess content seems to be oriented towards beginner and intermediate level players. Therefore he should thusly title this video amature chess. This DVD is not for master level players. Seriwan naturally takes an anti-Watson and  anti-Nunn approach which he should in teaching beginners. Even Watson would admit that rule independence cannot be taught to beginners. They need rules to lean on. He provides them with established opening principles. Students are also provided with rules of when and how to attack and defend. This whole process of giving rules is how beginners are taught not masters. The teachings of Dvorestsky and Nunn and Watson are much less rule independent and variation driven which is how masters are taught. Even he in his own video says one cannot follow all the rules blindly. Therefore I would recommend his dvd to beginners and intermediate level players.,1104796800,28,1317,5.041284403669724
