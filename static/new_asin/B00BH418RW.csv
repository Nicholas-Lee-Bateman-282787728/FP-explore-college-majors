5621225,4,B00BH418RW,"This is a totally fun collection of complete episodes from the Yogi's Gang TV series. The humor is toned down considerably from that of the short cartoons of the late 50's and early 60's, and the situations are rather didactic in nature--teaching kids about the pitfalls of selfishness, gossip, greed, litter, and so forth. In fact, the series would be downright preachy except for the fact that Yogi and his friends make it all entertaining.  The great old characters are here--Yogi Bear, Boo Boo, Huckleberry Hound, Snagglepuss, Magilla Gorilla, and the rest. In each episode, one or more of the members of the crew of Yogi's Ark falls prey to the temptation brought by the show's ""guest villian"" such as the Greedy Genie, Lotta Litter, or the Prankster.  Naturally, right thinking and right acting prevail by the show's end, so every story ends happily for all but the villain, who usually runs away looking for more corruptible souls to influence. The real treat in these stories is the voice work by the original artists, such as Daws Butler, who voiced Yogi, Huck, Snagglepuss, Quick Draw, and many of the rest.  His vocal talent was still strong in the early 70's. Don Messick is also on hand as the voice of Boo Boo, and of Ranger Smith, who appears in a handful of episodes.  Julie Bennett, as in the original TV series and theatrical film, provides the voice of Cindy Bear. There also are guest artists voicing the villains, such as Tom Bosley and Rose Marie, who is evidently having loads of fun providing the voice for Lotta Litter. The stories are very light-weight but they do teach kids worthwhile lessons about being good citizens of Planet Earth. The collection even includes the TV movie that provided the inspiration for the series--""Yogi's Ark Lark.""  This is provided in the context of the Yogi's Gang series as a flashback story.  My only quibble about this presentation of ""Yogi's Ark Lark"" is that it leaves out the opening credits sequence in which the various characters make their entrances arriving at Jellystone Park--the original version should have been included, at least as a bonus; however, I am glad to have the introductory material that blends the earlier story into the rest of the series.  Except for about a minute of footage which has been lopped off of ""Yogi's Ark Lark,"" the series appears to be presented intact.  The color is rich and vibrant, and the sound comes through nice and clearly. So for any die-hard fans of Yogi Bear who will take our favorite Jellystone bruin in whatever format he is presented--this collection is a treasure to enjoy with your kids.  If you exclusively prefer the early Hanna-Barbera efforts, you will not enjoy this one as well.  While there is some subtle adult humor sprinkled in here and there, this collection is pretty squarely aimed at the younger set. But if one is a fan of Yogi Bear, there is much to enjoy.  It's great that this series is finally available!",1368576000,15,2943,4.785009861932939

5621229,1,B00BH418RW,"I used to watch reruns of this crummy series in the 1970's when I was about 10 years old. I had been a fan of the original ""Yogi Bear"" cartoons, and since those were seldom broadcast in my area during the late 1970's, I settled for ""Yogi's gang"" instead. (There was no home video or cable TV. If I wanted to see Yogi Bear on TV in the late 1970's, ""Yogi's Gang"" was it.)

""Yogi's Gang"" is nothing like the earlier ""Yogi Bear"" cartoons that were produced a decade earlier. The old Yogi was a rebel who set out to outwit the ranger and obtain picnic baskets. The Yogi Bear of 'Yogi's Gang"" looks and sounds the same, but his rebellious and fun-loving personality is gone!

Yogi is the captain of a ship filled with anthropomorphic animals from various Hanna-Barbera animated series (including Magilla Gorilla, Huckleberry Hound, Snagglepuss, and others too numerous too list). They all travel around in a large boat and encounter various villains who try to trick them into doing unkind or unwise things. For example, one episode has a villain named ""Mister Waste"" encourage the animals to throw away and replace everything they use.

If I remember correctly, some of the episodes had their plots filled out with bad musical numbers.

Yogi and his gang eventually learned their lessons, and made sure that the kids watching at home learned them too. The messages were positive, but delivered with no subtlety. Dr. Seuss sometimes injected messages into his children's books (such as ""The Sneetches"" and ""The Lorax"" among others); yet he understood subtlety. Seuss never decided to teach lessons INSTEAD OF entertaining.

The original ""Yogi Bear"" series and other early Hanna-Barbera TV cartoons always set out to put comedy first and foremost, while ""Yogi's Gang"" kept humor to a minimum.

The ""real"" Yogi Bear used to steal picnic baskets, and trick and con his way into anything else he set out to do. Who the helicopter is he to lecture others about morality? Yogi claimed to be ""smarter than the average bear"", yet he was not smart enough to pass up these terrible, preachy scripts.

The best thing about this series is that it made the original ""Yogi Bear"" cartoons seem like masterpieces by comparison.",1411257600,6,2206,4.8201058201058204

8568471,3,B00BH418RW,"YOGI'S GANG: The first of countless Hanna-Barbera ""reunion"" shows, this all-star cavalcade of anthropomorphic characters was a sequel to the Saturday Superstar Movie titled Yogi's Ark Lark, a marginally better outing. Jellystone's most famous bruin and sawed off sidekick Boo Boo were joined on a flying ark by Huck Hound, Snagglepuss, Wally Gator, Quick Draw McGraw, Magilla Gorilla, and others in their never ending quest to stamp out bland evil-doers like Lotta Litter, Mr. Hothead, and The Greedy Genie. If that sounds a long way from filching pic-a-nic baskets, blame the seventies' ""no-violence"" sanction on Saturday morning cartoons, which resulted in safe, preachy fare from HB's formerly rebellious icons. Although the Ark Lark special spotlighted a couple of dozen fuzzy faces from Lippy the Lion and Top Cat to Hokey Wolf and Secret Squirrel, the core cast of Yogi's Gang was whittled down to about ten characters (nearly all voiced by Daws Butler, bless his golden vocal chords). Future get togethers like All Star Laff-a-Lympics and Fender Bender 500 featured many of the same heroes, but at least the emphasis was on fun more than social issues.

8568478,5,B00BH418RW,"This cartoon series brings back memories for me as a kid on Saturday mornings as Yogi Bear and his buddy Boo Boo along with a who's who of Hanna-Barbera personalities as they ride across the sky in a flying ark powered by Magilla Gorilla on a treadmill reaching for a banana off a stack of bananas.
The series itself was a spin-off from a 1972 Saturday Morning Superstar Movie that aired on ABC[The best of three major networks that aired the greatest cartoon lineup on Saturday mornings at that time-IMHO]. I never actually saw the initial movie until after the series started when it concluded as a two-part flashback episode. Although for this set, however, the pilot movie is slightly restored. In other words, it omitted the opening credits with the members arriving in Jellystone Park prior to the meeting where the story reflected in its edited form but featured the original ""Ark Lark"" closing credits. Most of the personalities featured have their original voice-overs[Daws Butler, Don Messick, Allan Melvin, John Stephenson, amongst them]. Speaking of whom, the character of Jellystone Park's Ranger Smith[Messick] had a slight makeover of having blond hair instead of dark hair plus he is more welcoming to Yogi Bear than he was from the old Yogi series in the 3 appearances he makes.
Yogi and his crew go along with the times addressing ecological and social issues. Each episode[hence the Ark Lark movie pilot]is titled after a villain or a villainess, who tends to mar the good intentions and representations of Yogi and his gang then fall into his or her spell. Notice how in ""Mr. Bigot""(voiced by Henry Corden) and ""The Sheik Of Selfishness""(voiced by Paul Witchell) each villain has a pair of bickering assistants. The ""Envy Brothers"" themselves mostly qualify. How many have we heard the ""Greedy Genie""(voiced by Stephenson) use the word Kazotz!(?). The title character of ""Mr. Fibber""(voiced by Tom Bosley) whose long-nosed feature I'm surprised never got any longer by telling a fib[ala Pinocchio]. ""Lotta Litter""(voiced by Rose Marie) is one of two villainesses. The other is ""Gossipy Witch""(voiced by Virginia Gregg).
The main body of the crew is Yogi Bear, Boo Boo, Snagglepuss, Peter Potamus, Wally Gator, Magilla Gorilla, Quick Draw McGraw, Baba Looey, Augie Doggie, Doggie Daddy, Huckleberry Hound, Lippy The Lion. Hardy Har Har, Atom Ant, Hillbilly Bears, Squiddley Diddly, with the occasional appearance by Pixie and Dixie, Touche Turtle, Secret Squirrel, Moracco Mole, Yakky Doodle, Cindy Bear, Hokey Wolf and So-So.
Also worth noting is the odd animated goof like in previous Hanna-Barbera cartoons, meaning more or less color on a popular character or the wrong voice-over on one character even[No Snagglepuss dialogue intended]. Which is something one might recognize upon viewing it on the tube a few times.
This set is truly a treat for Hanna-Barbera lovers as well as Yogi Bear lovers. Highly recommended! Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey and you're on your way!",1422230400,3,2980,5.133744855967078
