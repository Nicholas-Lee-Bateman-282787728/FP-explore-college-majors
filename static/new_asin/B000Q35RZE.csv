8505631,4,B000Q35RZE,"Good ""Bang For Buck"".  It's the best Country 2-Step DVD I've purchased.  Excellent descriptions and examples.  Talks about the different quick-quick-slow-slow and the 1-2-3-prep counts.  Without a dance partner, I've taught myself enough country 2-step from this video to make the lady's happy. However, I did need some one to practice with to learn the more intricate moves.  Has lots of moves and easy-to-use main menu and sub-menu guides",1237161600,,440,5.318840579710145
