4257715,5,B0043URV1O,"Three year old grandson loves it, his 18 mo old sister says 'George'.  John Deere Action and Mighty Machines are still their favorites. But George ranks right up there.  I think they can really relate to George! The curious, busy, little monkey is always into something. Lessons are learned when his misguided good intentions cause problems. George is loveable and while his intention is good, it may require more thought. Eight full episodes in this DVD.  Guidance and supervision from the man in the yellow hat isn't usually available until after all the trouble!  A lesson he never seems to learn.... monkeys and children need attention and supervision. :-D",1428192000,,660,5.027522935779817

4257780,5,B0043URV1O,"I am so sick of the programming on Disney Channel teaching my boy that if you want to get down from a tree you need a giant piece of celery to slide down.  We try and give our child other things to do, but the reality is that sometimes it is just more appropriate to let him watch some TV...if you can stand the agenda of the people making the programs.

Then we ran across Curious George and were relieved.  No agendas, no politically correct subject matter, no illogical logic.  The first time we watched one it was like taking your shoes off after a long walk on a summer day...aaahhhh.

To top it off, each DVD only costs around $10. I ended up buying 10 different titles and have been happy with every one...thus I will copy and paste this review on each one of them.

4257788,5,B0043URV1O,Lovely good natured fun with some mild educational value. Good for 2+ with no violence; my daughter loves the kids in between demonstrating the lesson Curious George learned in the episode. The episodes are broken into roughly 10 minute blocks so easy to turn off when tv time is over.,1358035200,,285,4.72

Fun fo rthe family to watch too.",1354147200,,141,4.071428571428571
4257798,5,B0043URV1O,"We watch Curious George on tv every morning.  On road trips she would ask to watch him,but we didn't have any videos of him.  When I found the Curious George videos on Amazon, it was like striking gold.  These videos contain multiple episodes totally 90 minutes of enjoyment.  She loves them and it occupies her.",1354060800,,312,4.618181818181818
4257799,5,B0043URV1O,"I think I might enjoy watching the Curious George episodes as much as my 3 year old, it's on netflix instant play & we've watched them all more than once; My daughter never grows sick of them & I always enjoy a good laugh with the New England humor. I also love the fact that there's no negativity of any kind in the show. No bad guys, no scary parts, no negative words like ""stupid"" or ""idiot"" like so many of the other cartoons these days. They are also educational with real-life skills such as composting, recycling & gardening,ect. to name a few. We started buying them individually for long treks across county in the car & they prove to be a perfect entertainer for our daughter & also perfect length so I know she's not gonna spend too much time in front of the screen. I happened to stumble upon a few discs at Target one day; so I decided to get on Amazon & see if I could get a box set for cheaper but in fact it is more expensive through Amazon. Plus, the individual discs on Amazon are even more expensive than buying them through Target or Walmart. You can buy most disc's for $5 at Target & Walmart. There's a few that range from $6 to $10 for whatever reason, yet those prices for those specific discs are still more affordable than Amazon surprisingly enough.",1347235200,,1276,4.320833333333334

4257801,5,B0043URV1O,"The informative reviews helped me to choose this DVD, which is now my 3 year old's absolute favorite.  My toddler is autistic, so it isn't always easy to find quality, educational programming, which also holds his attention.  I had hoped this video would help with the bedtime routine but, if I let him, he would watch it around the clock!  He actually laughs hysterically at certain scenes, every time.  The cartoons are relaxing to watch, the soft colors and animation so closely resemble the classic book illustrations.  We enjoy the clips of the children, throughout the programs.  I remember Curious George from my own childhood, and we will definitely be adding more of the DVD's, very soon!",1338768000,,697,4.914529914529915
4257802,5,B0043URV1O,What can I say? Curious George is great for little ones. Keeps my daughter amused and interested. Sometimes I am afraid his curiosity/shenanigans might give a little one ideas but it is very charming and there is usually a lesson to be learned. Love the piano music that accompanies the scenes. Adds to its charm.,1335916800,,313,4.709090909090909
