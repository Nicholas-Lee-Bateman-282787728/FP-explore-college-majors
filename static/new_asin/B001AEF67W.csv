3447569,2,B001AEF67W,"I knew that the voice actors would be different from the voice actors from previous Tenchi Muyo offerings, so I expected that the characters voices would be different. What I found to be truly annoying is that so many of the characters names were mispronounced, including the name of Sasami, which being the title character is unforgivable.",1241136000,2,340,4.982456140350878
3447570,4,B001AEF67W,"It's billed as a spin-off of Tenchi Muyo and while this is not altogether incorrect, Sasami Magical Girls Club is more properly a spin off of Pretty Sammy/Magical Project S. Returning from Magical Project S are our spunky heroine Sasami, her dreadfully shy best friend Misao, Sasami's parents Hanoka and Ginji, Sasami's teacher Mihoshi, and one of my all-time favorite anime characters - the unforgettable Washu. However, the resemblance to the earlier Pretty Sammy material ends rather quickly. Indeed, even before you open the plastic wrap you will notice that the cover artwork and character designs are very different. So different, that I actually checked to see if AIC (Anime International Co.) even produced Sasami Magical Girls Club and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they did.

The basic premise to the story is similar in many ways to Harry Potter. In ages of the distant past, normal humans and witches (magic users) co-existed harmoniously, but over time this changed and non-magical people began to fear and oppressively persecute the witches. So great was their plight that the witches retreated into a hidden world where they could leave in peace. Eventually this was forgotten by normal humans over the course of history, that is until new groups of magic users began to emerge randomly in the human world. And so enters Sasami and her friends.

There is so much about Sasami Magical Girls Club that is different from anything previously associated with Tenchi Muyo, that attempting to use the older franchise as a yardstick to judge this new series would fail miserably. It really needs to stand on its own merits and in that regard it exceeds quite well. The story is told very evenly without revealing too much too early or dragging it out too much. Many themes such as friendship, social acceptance, and self esteem are very appropriate for the age group this show is intended for and provide some lovely drama for us older viewers as well. Like with Magical Project S, the shoujo and angst dimensions are much more pronounced than with the normally shounen Tenchi Muyo. The writing and intricate plotlines are superb, and I did find the anime artwork to be very cute and pleasing, even though it is so different from AIC's previous works like EL Hazard, and Ah! My Goddess. I should also mention that the soundtrack is wonderful and I found the harp music in the theme for Sasami and Amitav especially beautiful.

All in all, I enjoyed Sasami Magical Girls Club a great deal. If you're more of a Tenchi traditionalist and prefer the original works, you might not enjoy it so much. But if like me you love Tenchi Muyo in all forms, especially Pretty Sammy, then this series is not to be missed. AIC did a wonderful job in giving new life to an aged franchise, making it new and refreshing once again.",1234656000,10,2833,4.813141683778234
3447571,4,B001AEF67W,"I'd agree with the previous review: this is a series that's gotten some hostile reviews on sites like Anime News Network.  Nevertheless, it's well worth a watch. It is, to be sure, very definitely a series designed for elementary and early middle-school children, however, and so young adults will find its approach too ""kiddy"" in its emphasis on ""best friends"" and cuteness.

However, it is not without its darker moments: episodes explore early understanding of death and dying and the emotional damage of bullying and ostracism.  And this series, like all magical girl series, does deal with the mixed threat and promise of one's post-puberty sexual self.  This is nicely captured in a scene where the little girl Sasami dances with a magical being she meets in the Witch world and sees, in split-second glimpses here and there, her adult self in a reflecting pool of water.

The supporting cast is also quirky and memorable, notably the slightly scary Tsukasa, who is the most mature of the group, and also has the most multiply traumatized backstory.  The need for young girls to negotiate their incestuous desires for their fathers, as often in magical girl series, is often clearly marked in the plot.

As other reviewers have noted, not much happens: the girls hardly ever use their magic, and the grade-school social conflicts work out in mundane, common-sense ways.  But they do so in clever, unpredictable plots, thanks to scripts by Mari Okada (a veteran of the classic Goth series Rozen Maiden!).  Despite stereotypes, a child's life is not a simple one, and young watchers may well appreciate a series that does not ""dumb down"" difficult issues for them.",1226966400,,1668,4.971223021582734
3447572,4,B001AEF67W,"At first this series presented itself as a love it or hate it series but sticking with it, it becomes easy to find this series growing on you a bit. While younger audiences are going to get the most appreciation out of this series, adults who sit down and give it a chance may find themselves slowly charmed as well. It's not going to win any top ten lists this year but if you're looking for a cute way to spend an afternoon or two, this set may very well be worth your time. Recommended.",1223164800,,489,4.157894736842105
3447573,5,B001AEF67W,"Now, this is something I'm really looking forward in watching. The dvd was perfect and the shipping speed was good. I greatly enjoyed the product. Thanks! I'm glad I bought it from this seller!",1372636800,,193,4.705882352941177
3447574,3,B001AEF67W,"Pronunciation. Could we learn how to say Japanese names if we are going to do an anime voice over in English? Other than that, great little story for young anime viewers.",1371340800,,170,4.516129032258065
3447575,4,B001AEF67W,"No, there are no magical girl transformation sequences in this anime, but it's a more of beginners learning how to control their magic and deal with the ups and downs of friendship, romance, and life. It has the cuteness of something like Petite Princess Yucie, but has a bit more adult humor and themes.

For example, there are minor fan service scenes that I found to be inappropriate for the characters since the main cast are in elementary school. One of the characters apparently has a bit more of an idolization for another girl. Overall, it's not a huge turn off, but if you're not a fan of those things, be warned. If you can get past those, it's really just a cute story of friendship and romance.

Some fans complained about the English opening and the pronunciation of ""Sasami"", but I didn't really find anything to be fussed over concerning those complaints. The characters do sing a recurring song called ""The Song of the Earth"" which is sung best by the witches themselves and a character named Amitav.

In the second season, things are a little more serious since it involves a conspiracy concerning the witches who want to destroy the human world. The girls' friendship will be tested as they will have to deal with betrayal from one of their group.

All in all, this anime is a very cute story of tried and true friendship and romance.",1365811200,3,1352,4.620833333333334
3447576,4,B001AEF67W,If you like magical girl series you may want to pick this one up. Yes the english dub does take a few liberties to change proper pronunciations with some names (Sasami and Ryo-oki mostly) but if you can get past that it isn't that bad. If you can't there's always the original Japanese dub.,1362009600,,290,4.388888888888889
3447577,5,B001AEF67W,love the price came fast i give this a 10 out of 10 i will but more soon ;) i recommend to evey body to any body how loves anime and love saving money,1357862400,,150,3.4411764705882355
3447578,5,B001AEF67W,"I watch a lot of anime with my daughter, and she still enjoys some that are decidedly lighter fare. Season one is suited for all ages, not too heavy of topics covered. It's more based on developing friendships and teamwork. Definitely ""G"" rated. The opening theme music for this series is some of the best I've encountered, we usually watched/listened to the entire intro rather than fast forwarding through it like we so often do once it becomes familiar.",1356393600,,456,4.784810126582278
3447579,4,B001AEF67W,"I got this b/c I really like Tenchi Muyo. It's not Tenchi Muyo, but I really enjoyed it. It focuses on a group of friends and the strengthening of their relationships with each other. I think it's geared more toward younger viewers, but it teaches a lot of important life lessons. It's a lot of fun and for the price you can't go wrong.",1351209600,2,336,4.265625
3447580,2,B001AEF67W,"I've been a Sasami Fan since she was created, I LOVED Magical Project S, it was adorable! But this...Ugh...The storyline is cute at best, but neither Japanese of English voice acting are the same as the original Tenchi. The voices are TERRIBLE!!! Even in Japanese its still pretty bad...The storyline is about a 4 out of 10 and the voice acting is a 0 out of 10. Ryo-Oh-Ki looks WAY too different(obviously so do Sasami and Washu), but to make matters WORSE, in the English version they renounce her name as ""Sass-uh-me"", IT'S ""SAH-SAH-ME""!!!! Though cheap, it's still a waste and not really worth it, it would have been a 4 stared anime if they had the original voice actors, but, alas, IT DOESN'T.
I gave it 2 stars because the storyline is kinda of cute, and 2 stars is generous...Yes, it's that bad...why did they dub it so horribly? Funimation could have at least made DECENT voice acting choices, but that happens with about 1 of of every 10 anime they distribute...
Somewhere in Japan, Hiroki Hayashi is on the verge of suicide.",1292716800,,1035,4.630434782608695
3447581,4,B001AEF67W,"First, it's not sah-summy - it's Sah-sah-mi!! Very irritating mistake...

Upon first glance, this is a KIDS show that likely could be viewed on whatever channel keeps hacking up popular anime from Japan and changing everything around to make everything happy, mindless, and complete with lessons for kids...
But sure enough, there are humorous adult themes mixed in and thankfully, the company chose to keep them in rather than edit them out. Example in point? One of the girl characters is in love with another girl character and practices voodoo magic on her rivals...Other than that angle, the character was very similar to Grenda in Petite Princess Yucie...
Another example, probably the best, is a joke where one teacher tells another that she will have to get on her knees and beg the mothers of the kids for forgiveness -the other teacher says that she'll have to do that for the fathers. It these type of jokes that you almost could miss that spice up the show and make it more entertaining.
The cast is taken directly from the Tenchi universe with Sasami, Washu, Mihoshi, and of course Ryo Ohki the CABBIT. Although Ryo has a new mischievous personality instead of cuddly.
Sasami is the title character -once the little sister alien in Tenchi turned magical girl in Magical Project S: Pretty Sammy and she has magical powers she inherited from her father. Misao also appears, but not as the amazing Pixy Misa rival, but rather shy awkward Misao.
Each girl has powers that they are not in control of; Sasami can move things, and the others range from little demons snakes/shadows, size changing, wind, voodoo...that's how they meet and become friends although they have nothing else in common. A very strange teacher appears to recruit them, along with the Janitor, and poses as the school nurse. There are immature themes and mature themes, but overall it's very enjoyable.
In closing, the things that may annoy you are:
*The name mispronunciation (EVERY time!)
*Sasami's squeeky high-pitched English voice
*The lesson of the day in every episode theme
*Not much actual magical girl content
*The English version of the theme song",1284249600,7,2138,4.938888888888889
3447582,5,B001AEF67W,"I bought Sasami Season 1 & Season 2 for my daughter who is 12 and she enjoyed both Seasons.  She said it has a bit ot romance and funny drama that she finds entertaining.  She does not like the mushy romance or drama types they have to have comedy and keep them laughing in order to keep her interest, just like the other anime and manga's that she likes to watch and read.  So if your looking for a lighthearted anime for your tween or teen girl then this is a good series that they would probably enjoy especially since it also has magic.",1279152000,,540,4.173076923076923

8277212,3,B001AEF67W,"This show recast all of the familiar roles and Sasami and Misao were replaced by interns. The English dub might be the better choice on this one, although a couple of the voices grew on me as the show went on. The animation is cheap and they did quite a few things to keep costs low. They did the best they could with limited budget and story. Its about as kid friendly a show you will ever see out of AIC/Tenchi and they still made a couple of scenes that will make adults cringe if they show it to kids.",1430524800,,505,4.06

I try to remember what took place, but sometimes I have to watch over again to refresh my mind. I remember they were in cooking class but really it is a class where witches can practice how to use their magic.",1421798400,,292,3.9661016949152543
