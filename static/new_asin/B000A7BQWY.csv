8075437,5,B000A7BQWY,"Incredible black and white abstract image manipulation from NY Avant Garde film legend Ken Jacobs, accompanied by John Zorn and Ikue Mori on laptop sounds. Completely uncompromising (and at first near-unwatchable until the eye adjusts to the relentless throbbing effect of the Nervous Magic Lantern improvising system) this is beautiful and demanding stuff. Accompanied by eerie, relentlessly experimental 'music' that  works Zorn's  'Redbird' and 'Absinthe' pieces into the outpourings of Mori's sublime laptop genius (and also offers an intriguing suggestion of what the Zorn/Mori/Patton Hemophiliac project could have been) this is, at times like a surreal ghost film, at others like a malevolent vision from inner space, at others like a stunning documentary from unseen areas of the natural world.
Sometimes gruelling, always fascinating -and a draining experience even on the small screen - this is an essential piece of experimental art from three absolute masters of their genre.",1218758400,5,987,5.617449664429531
