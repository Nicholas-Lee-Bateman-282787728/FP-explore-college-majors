8720502,5,B00ZLNQY24,"the one year I spent at Theological College in Washington DC, 1969 to 1970,  was pretty much the way seminary life was portrayed here... Even the rector was a Fr. Fromenger type... and yes, after I left, things pretty much swung the other way.. to the right...Parts of this series were difficult, even painful to watch for their brutal honesty... but,  for those who can handle the truth that seminarians and priests are as human as anyone else and,
like all other Christians, not perfect, simply redeemed sinners, I think THE CHURCHMEN is a powerful story, beautifully told, with brutal honesty, worthy of the Master's words: ""The Truth Will Set You Free"".  I can't wait for Seasons 3 and 4 to be available for purchase.

8720505,4,B00ZLNQY24,"Very good series.  I watch episodes on MHZ1 in the MD VA area.  I am a orthodox Roman Catholic so I do have some critiques but none that would automatically make me stop viewing this series. Let us face it: Negative bias against Christians in general has become rampant so it is hardly possible to escape today's secular-biased view of the Catholic Church but I think this series takes a more balanced view of ""the Church"".  Though I am circumspect viewing the series I can still say it is excellent in production values and casting.  I do recommend it to others.",1469232000,2,563,4.544554455445544

8720508,5,B00ZLNQY24,An amazing show. Loved it. Really interesting setting inside the little-known world of seminaries. Great characters and a really gripping plot. I din't think I'd enjoy it so much but really worth a watch.,1459728000,4,204,5.029411764705882
8720509,4,B00ZLNQY24,"I had no idea I would enjoy this so much. It is in French with English subtitles and focuses on five men who have entered the Seminary to eventually become priests. It also focuses on a parish priest Father Fromenge.

The show while obviously religious based doesn't cram anything down your throat. The religion, church, saint statues, and masses all act as props to the scene, they are NOT the scene.  The show is well done, unlike anything on American TV right now. It is raw, well acted, well scripted, poorly lit but that adds to the story line as well.

There are so many likable main characters and secondary characters that the storyline movies quickly.

What I find most interesting is how much conflict there is after all these are just people, as a catholic we tend to forget that and see them sometimes as deities, they are men and feel, speak and think like men. Sometimes they don't agree, sometimes they have to defend themselves, sometimes they lie, sometimes they argue, then ask for forgiveness.",1442793600,8,1012,4.700564971751413
