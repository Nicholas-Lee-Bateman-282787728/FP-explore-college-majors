8297879,4,B001EDGKYC,"Beyond Elections was a tremendous depiction of diverse forms of participatory democracy in action. You start with Porto Alegre's ""Participatory Budgeting"" (PB) system. I have long been an advocate of what this great Brazilian city has achieved. However, the film failed to actually show the process in motion. You will see many interviews by those directly involved in the PB system and also get a glimpse of some of the complete projects but, I don't think the new comer will leave having achieved a basic grasp of the system itself. You see loud, high energy assemblies, spokespeople for the communities, and then a completed project. I understand time constraints would not allow for a grand over-view of the inner workings of the system but I wish the producers would have shown the process in a slightly more detailed manner.

Next you head Venezuela and take a look at the communal councils that have been booming since 2006. In the councils citizens of a given geographic region can collectively decide which projects in their region require funding. The councils have been wildly popular (tens of thousands now exist) but there is a hardship that exists in encouraging community participation. Venezuela effectively achieved democracy ten years ago. Jumping from tyranny to republicanism to direct democracy would be quite the challenge for any nation in a ten year period. The question of the executive branch's centralization of state power is never explored either. Many worry this centralization will effectively make the councils dependent on the state opposed to being true autonomous bodies.

A question regarding both the PB system in Brazil and the councils in Venezuela is where do they stop? Do the systems forever work independently of issues outside their community, or could such a system spread to the state and federal levels? We also have to ask if councils can take on issues outside the realm of community funding? The documentary leaves these questions up the viewer and I hope we can continue to contemplate and discuss these issues as democracy grows in demand.

You also see a number of worker coops and other forms of participatory democracy in action. The entire presentation will leave you with a feeling of great hope and inspiration. Even the US is beginning to get on board as Chicago becomes the first American city to set up participatory budgeting in it's 49th ward. I hope these examples are the roots of an international struggle for the ever elusive concept of true democracy.",1259884800,,2519,5.0359712230215825
8297880,4,B001EDGKYC,"Freedom is when we hand back governance to the governments which allows us to be free independant citizens to pursue life. Where is the freedom of a democratic society when we as citizens do the work of government.

Governments and public servants you have indulgent lives, earnt it. We elect governments we should elect the public servants as well. Citizens shouldn't create another beauracracy but be allowed to 'police' the existing ones.",1250985600,,441,5.125
8297881,5,B001EDGKYC,"""Beyond Elections"" is not an ""entertaining"" film, but it is very informative.  It examines the meaning of democracy beyond the occasional votes that take place, and look at how democracy can have a deeper meaning in the world.  The DVD goes beyond theories, and takes the viewer to places like Porto Alegre, Brasil where citizens are involved with participatory budgeting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Porto-Alegre-Experiment-Learning-Lessons-for-Better-Democracy/dp/1842774050/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Porto Alegre Experiment: Learning Lessons for Better Democracy</a>.

The film isn't flashy at all, it is mostly interviews with people involved in community meetings, worker assemblies, cooperatives and so forth; but in the wake of the Obama election, it's valuable to have a documentary that looks at the nuts and bolts of other forms of democratic participation.
""Beyond Elections"" also takes a look at the sort of response that elites have begun in places like Bolivia where indigenous people have been gaining power with the Evo Morales presidency&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cocalero/dp/B000WS6Y9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cocalero</a>.  Wealthy business people in the resource rich southern part of Bolivia have begun a secessionist movement that would cost Bolivia's government billions in lost royalties.

There is also discussion of how the U.S. is lagging behind in these deeper forms of democracy.  Although, the film includes an interview with radio host Amy Goodman of ""Democracy Now!"" and the effect that independent media in the U.S. is having on the country's consciousness&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Standing-Up-to-the-Madness-Ordinary-Heroes-in-Extraordinary-Times/dp/1401322883/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Standing Up to the Madness: Ordinary Heroes in Extraordinary Times</a>.
