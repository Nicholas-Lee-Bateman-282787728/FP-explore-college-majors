2659929,5,B000ION53C,"This opera recording is a pleasant surprise.  Tiefland is not played very often, but the Zurich recording shows that the opera is worth revisiting once in a while.  They assembled a high quality cast, which is I guess the way to do it if you want to make a strong case for a lesser known work.  Petra Maria Schnitzer and Peter Seiffert are excellent, but the real standout is Matthias Goerne playing the part of the ""evil baritone."" The plot is simple: the naive shepherd Pedro (Seiffert) is lured into moving from the mountains to the plains to marry Marta (Schnitzer), not knowing that the entire thing is a scheme by the landowner Sebastiano (Goerne).  Marta is Sebastiano's mistress, and he needs to get rid of her to marry another woman to get out of some financial trouble.  By marrying her to the simple Pedro, he hopes that he can keep Marta as his mistress on the side.  Pedro eventually realizes what is going on and kills Sebastino.  He then takes Marta (both have fallen in love in the meantime, don't ask) back to the mountains to escape from the plains, where people are just too evil.  So the story is a bit hard to swallow (though not any worse than, say, Cavalleria Rusticana), but the music really has its moments.

Some people might be put off by the (modern) production.  The director tries a bit too hard to distance himself from the simple plot, implying that the mountain world, where people are all good and pure, exists only in Pedro's head (he is programmed a la Matrix...).  It's a bit of a stretch, but once you reach the second scene, the production is more straightforward and one can concentrate on the beautiful music and enjoy some first rate singing.",1237248000,21,1684,4.58
2659930,3,B000ION53C,"Based on the 1896 Catalan play and the 1903 German opera, Leni Reifenstahl brings the story of love, lust and class warfare in Spain (actually Catalonia) to the silver screen. Although the film bears all the lush and romantic trademarks of Riefenstahl's directorial style, and I could never tire of_seeing_a Leni Riefenstahl film, the story of ""Tiefland"" just didn't reach me on the deeper emotional level that ""The Blue Light"" or even ""Triumph of the Will"" did. Although beautifully filmed, and impressive in its individual parts, for me the story did not cohere into a satisfying whole. Still, it's well worth watching.",1190937600,24,621,5.098039215686274
8146799,4,B000ION53C,"""Tiefland"" was reportedly Hitler's favorite opera, but this film is completely cinematic with no arias whatsoever.  Best known for her documentaries&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Triumph-of-the-Will/dp/B005NTK2EM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Triumph of the Will</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Olympia/dp/B000FQJA2S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Olympia</a>, ""TIefland"" was Leni Riefenstahl's first (and last) foray into fictional cinema.  She displays the tight storytelling (there's hardly a wasted moment) and innovative camerawork that were both evident in her earlier films.  No one does crowds of people like Riefenstahl, and in several scenes with groups of peasants, their movements are as gripping and surprising as the much larger groups in her other films.  ""Tiefland"" showed what Riefenstahl was capable of when she had complete control over the actors as well as the camera.  Watch for the scene where a group of supplicants bow as they ask the Mayoral for water, or the coordinated movements of the audience in the tavern scene, or the men outside the mill during a windstorm.

It's not clear why Hitler found this story so appealing.  It has a strong theme of the hardworking, honest peasants arrayed against the cruel and selfish marquis, who diverts the local water source for his prize bulls, preventing the peasants from growing their crops.  We also learn early on that the marquis' apparent wealth is a sham; he lives in a castle, but is deeply in debt and on the verge of foreclosure unless he can quickly arrange a marriage to a wealthy woman.  Riefenstahl herself plays Donna Martha, a traveling dancer who inadvertently finds herself enmeshed in this conflict.  In a scene in a tavern, we're treated to a remarkable display of her dancing ability (Riefenstal was originally a dancer before she got into filmmaking).  Riefenstahl played the role herself because she couldn't find anyone else she wanted to do it, but when she saw herself onscreen, she felt the role was miscast as she looked too old (Riefenstahl was 40 at the time; the character was supposed to be in her 20s).  As far as I'm concerned, she looks fine; Riefenstahl retained a youthful appearance her entire life, obtaining a SCUBA license at age 80 by plausibly claiming to be 60.

Derided as ""Hitler's filmmaker,"" Riefenstahl was never a Nazi party member, and claimed to have never heard of Hitler before she met him.  She said that her sole intentions were artistic and that if she had been Russian, she would have made films for Stalin, and if she'd been American, she would have made them for Roosevelt.  ""Triumph of the Will,"" while superficially a record of the 1935 Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg, is also a celebration of the spectacle of a large, unified group of people (that is, if you can put aside who these people were, and what they did only a few years later).  At the same time, the film doesn't exactly show everyone in a positive light - Hermann Gring looks like a fatuous clown, and Rudolf Hess is a terrifying figure, his eye sockets bottomless black pools.  ""Olympia"" is a record of the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, but the athletes of all nations, not just Germany, are celebrated, and in some ways, the black American Jesse Owens is one of the film's heroes.  The message is clearly that physical beauty and athletic prowess are completely independent of race or nationality.

So the argument could be made that Riefenstahl was a pure artist who only by chance of birth found herself in what was one of the worst regimes in human history.  But she crossed the line with ""Tiefland.""  Requiring Spanish-appearing actors for the crowd scenes, she recruited Roma and Sinti prisoners from the Maxglan-Leopoldskron ""Zigeunerlager"" near Salzburg, and the Marzahn camp near Berlin.  Despite Riefenstahl's insistence that she followed up on the actors after the war and confirmed that they all survived, nearly all Marzahn prisoners were eventually moved to Auschwitz, where they were gassed.  Despite the aforementioned artistic quality of the crowd scenes, they're difficult to watch knowing the actors' fate.  It's one thing to work independently within a system, quite another to deliberately take advantage of the benefits of that system's worst aspects.  In short, you can't enlist concentration camp victims on the way to their deaths as extras in your film if you expect anyone to ever want to work with you again.  In fact, Riefenstahl never obtained outside financing for any of her films after ""Tiefland;"" her subsequent work was all self-financed.  Her later films of the Nubians may have been an attempt to counter charges of racism while avoiding any association with the horrors of European history by working with people who had no connection to it.  Her final underwater films escape the human world altogether by focusing on fish.

Sometimes described as ""the greatest female director,"" Riefenstahl is certainly in the running for the title of best director, period.  ""Tiefland,"" however, despite her complete artistic control, falls short of what she showed she was capable of in her earlier documentaries.  This may be due to its smaller human scale, although the story does connect to larger concerns of power and oppression - a supreme irony considering what many of the actors were experiencing when they weren't on set.",1517702400,,5452,5.275462962962963
8146800,1,B000ION53C,"I should have read the reviews before I bought this DVD.  The production is one of those post-modern monstrosities which seem to be pushing out straight performances which at least nod to the composer's intentions.  Musically, all is well.  Just keep your eyes closed, and everything will be fine.  Better still, just get the CD version with Rudolf Schock while you can still find it.  Now THAT  is TIEFLAND.",1495584000,,408,4.840579710144928
8146801,5,B000ION53C,"Leni Riefenstahls allegory of mountain men, wolves, downtrodden peasants, callous aristocrats (especially an evil Marques), and gypsy musicians is a cinematic triumph. Highlights include the wolf attack, Lenis flamenco dance, and the knife fight. I leave to others to decipher Tiefland's political subtext, if indeed there is any.
Anyhow I was pretty impressed with the film. Not only was Ms. Riefenstahl a great visual stylist right up there with the best directors of her era  Welles, et al.  but also a darn good storyteller. And she does some fine acting as well. BTW she bears an uncanny resemblance to Greta Garbo. Im not qualified to comment on the technical quality of her dancing  I understand she was a dancer in her early years  but for me her performance captures the spirit and energy of the gypsy dance, and it's all rendered in most atmospheric fashion by the smoky, shadowy photography.
My only reservation: we have a very Spanish subject and setting, but the actors speak German, and my DVD was subtitled in English. All a bit confusing. But no matter. Tiefland is much recommended.
Aside: I just caught the directors The Blue Light, which, for all its visual panache and myth-invoking story line, I consider mildly inferior to Tiefland. My lukewarm response is perhaps due to Das blaue Lichts technical limitations (its more or less a silent movie) and thus its primitive look and feel. Still, Tiefland strikes me as a far more polished product and a stronger story told in a smoother narrative style. And perhaps Ms. Riefenstahl simply became a better director over time.",1439942400,4,1590,4.966165413533835
8146802,5,B000ION53C,A powerful film and worth watching. A film from Nazi Germany. Well done production.  A window to the past.,1436572800,,106,4.578947368421052
8146803,4,B000ION53C,"This is the last full feature film of Riefenstahl is based on ""Marta of the Lowlands (Terra Baixa); A Play in Three Acts by Owen Wallace Gillpatrick (1915).  The evil Don Sebastian, Marqu&egrave;s von Roccabruna wants it all including a Spanish Bettel dancer on the side.

It is not quite as popular as many of the other Riefenstahl films such as the ""The Blue Light"" (1932). But it can hold its own. You will get intrigued the story. Of course you may feel a little embarrassed for Leni playing an exotic dancer and the knife fight scene.

8146804,4,B000ION53C,"Born in Glasgow in 1864, Eugen D'Albert's musical education in Austria is however one that, based on what is evident in his opera Tiefland (1903), indicates that he is very much a disciple of the Wagnerian school, with even a bit of verismo in his choice of subject and its handling. Apparently Bizet's Carmen was also an influence on the composer, but although there are a few musical leitmotifs that bear the mark of the original Catalan/Pyrenean setting of Tiefland (based on the play Tierra Baixa - The Lowlands - by &Agrave;ngel Guimer&agrave;, also made into a controversial film by Leni Riefenstahl), the influence is more in the subject of romance, passion and jealousy in a bucolic setting leading to tragedy (a hint of Gounod's Mireille in there also) than in the actual musical arrangements.

The poor fool caught in the middle of a romantic entanglement here that eventually stirs killing passions is Pedro, a simple shepherd in the mountains who is offered the hand of the miller's daughter Marta and a place down in the lowland valley by the landlord Sebastiano. Pedro innocently accepts, unaware of the reality of the situation that is known to everyone else in the lord's household. Sebastiano is in debt and needs to marry a rich woman, but that won't happen as long as the knowledge of his affair with Marta is widely known and spoken about. His intention then is to safely marry her off to an innocent fool that she couldn't possibly love so as to keep up appearances of respectability while she remains his ""bit on the side"".

Musically, Tiefland follows the Wagnerian model, with long solo singing of emotional intensity that purposefully drives the drama forward, with little in the way of conventional arias, duets or choral arrangements, but the music has a strong musical presence and leitmotifs that support the singing and indicate the nature of the characters and their motivations. Matthias Goerne is strongest, both in voice and dramatically, making Pedro's wide-eyed naivety convincing while at the same time showing that he has inner depths and integrity that could indeed draw Marta to rather precipitously fall in love with him. Petra Maria Schnitzer perhaps doesn't look like she has natural gypsy dancer roots, but sings well as Marta. Peter Seiffert doesn't quite have the fullness of tone or the menacing build that you would associate with Sebastiano, but takes on the villain role with some relish and without overplaying.

The staging of this 2006 production at the Opernhaus in Zurich attempts to visually steer the drama away from its obvious models and references, and is thereby quite successful in allowing the piece to stand on its own. Some of the decisions however are quite bizarre - the opening prologue takes place in what looks like a science-fiction laboratory where the announcement of Pedro's engagement takes place in a virtual reality, cleverly assembled on projected screens - but thereafter, up until its reappearance in the final scene, the rest of the production is more naturalistic, taking place however in a lush stately house rather than in any period country exteriors.

The 140 minute opera is spread across two-discs on the EMI Classics DVD. The image is 16:9, the image fine, showing a well-lit stage. Audio tracks are LPCM Stereo, Dolby Digital 5.0 and DTS 5.0. The sound is a little thin without the low-end, and sometimes a little echoing, but the singing and orchestra can all be heard clearly. Subtitles are in English, German, French, Spanish and Italian.",1301011200,,3531,4.98981324278438
8146805,5,B000ION53C,"To many people's expectations, Leni Riefenstahl's honest answer to such a question would have to be ""spent it as Hitler's bitch."" According to Leni herself, however, nothing could be farther from the truth. Leni and Hitler admired each other, but strictly as intellectual friends and fellow artists, other than which the relationship was entirely platonic, by tacit mutual agreement. The reward of Hitler's admiration was that, whenever Leni challenged Hitler's views or said something he didn't like, especially toward the end, Hitler would merely pout, dismiss her from his circles and shun her for a time, rather than shipping her off to a concentration camp. Leni's haters, who are legion, dismiss all this, of course, and call her a liar. Her account, however, seems credible enough, at least to me. If Leni were a proper liar, after all, she would surely have said she secretly despised Hitler, kissed all the right ideological rings and tried to get herself on the side of the historical angels, right? Instead, it seems rather as if Leni's detractors don't really hate her for lying, they hate her for telling the truth.

For us, who live in a country whose last significant experience of home front warfare was in 1865, war tends to be a rather mythical, generally misunderstood business. In other countries, some relatively small percentage of the population marches off to war, another even smaller percentage stays home and runs the country and the war politically, and the great mass of the general population, at least until their national borders are broached, mainly just tries to get up every morning and go about their regular business as if war and all it portended wasn't really happening. What Leni did during the war, by all accounts, was go about her business, mainly spending it trying to make the movie she had always wanted to make in the middle of an avalanche of Allied bombs. That movie was ""Tiefland"" (Flatland.)

Viewing Tiefland today, we can easily imagine Leni's logistic difficulties. The parts of it she could control are, as usual, beautifully done; the scene selections, framing and camera work are consummate, occasionally breathtaking, works of art. As to what she couldn't completely control, well... such are the fortunes of war. Leni was lucky enough to find a German soldier, a handsome talented amateur, for the perfect male lead. For the female lead, an ingenue role, preferably calling for a gifted beautiful teenage dancer, no one could be found. Leni ended up forced to tackle the role herself... at age forty. No sooner was the footage wrapped, however, then Leni's country was invaded and overun, her worldly effects confiscated and herself bounced round endlessly from one prison camp to another, one collaboration/Denazification hearing and war trial to another, a process that took years before her name was finally cleared of all the accusations variously and inevitably leveled against a German of her international celebrity. It was 1950 before Leni ever got to see a viewing of the film she had spent so many years trying to shoot... and when she finally got to see it, she was horrified. Whatever the film's inevitable deficiencies, the thing about it that appalled Leni most painfully was her own performance. At forty years old, still beautiful despite war's and film work's hardships, and still a fine dancer, Leni was obviously anything but an ingenue, and totally miscast for the role.

Notwithstanding, it's still a great movie, and my friends and I who got together specially to view it enjoyed it enormously. One can only guess about all the great movies Leni Riefenstahl never got to make, and how things might have been, had a movie maker of her genius happened to be born in Hollywood, rather than WWII Germany.",1264809600,24,3781,5.007949125596184
8146806,4,B000ION53C,"Two reviewers quite correctly characterized this as a eurotrash production.  The setting of the prologue is a complete travesty as is the setting for the last minute of the opera.  The opera proper is set in a ""flour mill"" which has a patently absurd 21st century office look to it.  The costumes and acting of the three officious servants who serve as sort of a chorus to move things along are simply silly.  On top of that the story is also fairly silly--Sebastiano, an evil landowner has financial problems which he can solve by marrying a rich heiress.  But he has a mistress, Marta, and to make sure gossip about her doesn't derail the marriage he has Pedro, a simple very naive shepherd from the high Pyrenees, marry her--intending all along to keep Marta as a mistress.  Pedro doesn't know about the plan and Marta, initially, loathes Pedro.  Even so she bends to the will of Sebastiano and marries Pedro anyway.  The emotional consequences of the situation begin to be developed about half way through the first act and, despite the rather silly premise of the opera, some genuinely impressive emotions develop, aided by some gorgeous music.  Pedro sings a very long and moving aria ""Das Fest ist vorbei"" at the close of the first act and Marta's feelings toward him begin shifting to love.  This is developed further in the second act when Marta recounts to Tommaso (some sort of advisor to Sebastiano) her horrific upbringing and her eventual virtual enslavement by Sebastiano.  Tommaso, as a result, tells the heiress of Sebastiano's perfidy, thus foiling that marriage.  Eventually Pedro and Marta proclaim their love for one another.  When Sebastiano tries to interfere (to take Marta back as his mistress) Pedro fights and kills him.  Then Pedro and Marta flee from the flatlands (Tiefland) for the purity of the high meadows of the Pyrenees.

Matthias Goerne's portrayal of Sebastiano's brings out the essence of evilness.  Peter Seifert and Petra Schnitzer--husband and wife in real life--as Pedro and Marta are simply splendid in their roles, both in their singing and their acting.  Laszlo Polgar is excellent as Tommaso

Why four stars.  It is extremely well sung and for the critical parts the characters come ""alive"" in that their motivations and feelings are movingly expressed.  I almost turned it off after the prologue but kept watching because I have long loved the music.  About half way throgh the first act I began to appreciate the emotions of Pedro and Marta (and also Sebastiano and Tommaso--and Eva Liebau in the small part of Nuri was very appealing).  I would have been far, far happier if it had all taken place in a less bizarre set.  But I am happy that even this flawed product does exist and only hope that someday a more conventional production--but sung and acted as well as this one--will make it onto a DVD.

I don't know what the odds are for that--it is produced with some frequency in Germany (and I saw it once there with a ""proper"" set).  But it is rarely performed elsewhere so the market may not exist.  It also has the freight of being a favorite of Hitler (though I'm not sure why--possibly because d'Albert's music is influenced by Wagner--but nothing in the plot would seem to appeal to the Nazi psyche).  So, if one can ignore the absurd eurotrash scenery, I recommend this DVD.  If the eurotrash is too much, there are several recordings of it on CDs.",1247184000,8,3408,4.779487179487179

audio recordings and the b/w film with Rudolf Schock and Isabele Strauss

By shifting the framing scenes to a 21st-century mad scientist's laboratory, the passionate story of the three principals - all yearning for love whether naive, brutal or brutalized, loses much, if not all, of its power. The music is, of course, quite beautiful, the singing is adequate, but all the sets (not only the lab scenes) are so far removed from ""reality"" that it was difficult to get involved with the tormented characters.
