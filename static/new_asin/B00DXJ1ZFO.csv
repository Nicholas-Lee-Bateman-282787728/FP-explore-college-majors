5862057,4,B00DXJ1ZFO,"This double feature Blu-Ray special has 2 old World War II films.  Bridge Over the River Kway [1957] and Guns of Navarone [1961].  I had heard of but never seen either.  Let me give you the straight take on these 2 films.  Its curious how they paired a stinking floater like Guns of Navarone with a brilliantly done piece like Bridge Over the River Kwai.  Also curious how a film like the latter, absolutely hated by the actual combatants on both sides [British and Japanese] has been considered by many film critics to be one of the all-time great films.
As for Navarone: this doesnt even have the advantage of being a true story.  Yes its a truthy story, to borrow an invented word from Stephen Colbert.  It was nominated for 7 Academy Awards and only won a minor one: special effects.  I doubted it even deserved that but hey!  Special Effects in 1961 were not what they are today I guess.  Should have gotten a special award for over-acting.  F+.

Bridge Over Kwai: Hated by vets, because it didn't portray the Japanese labor camps, nor the British officers, the way they really were.  Loved by film critics becausewell, because like Fury and other war films, but even more-so, it depicts the ironies and contradictions of war [which are more or less universally true, I think].  This is not meant as a documentary but as a storya story which again, and perhaps unfortunately, derives from actual events used as a backdrop.  Also the visuals are way ahead of its timevery like Terrence Malik, whom Im currently considering as possibly the greatest American filmmaker, though he hasn't made all that many picturesbut this was decades before his Thin Red Line, and visually as impressive.  This is a great film; I give it an A.",1432512000,,1729,4.656765676567657
5862058,5,B00DXJ1ZFO,"THE GUNS OF NAVARONE and BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI are classic films from a classic era of film making. These are films of the like we never see again.

David Lean's BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is also another classic combining good stiff upper lip heroics and an overall cynicism of war and its futility as a means of expressing the humanity of all affected. This is a great film. It is interesting how William Holden's single handedness puts the entire essence of that statement to the test. William Holden and Alec Guinness are idealistically and diametrically opposed though not seen so visually in the same frame. Yet, Alec Guinness leaves an indelible image as the inimitable British Colonel Nicholson and Sessue Hayakawa as the powerfully weak Colonel Saito with William Holden, the American and cynic looking in on the entire madness. William Holden's character and predicament almost seem secondary to the central plot, but ultimately the American falls into the madness. The true substance of the story lies in the conflict and irony between Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa and the morality of British soldiers building a bridge for the enemy to the best of their abilities as Holden, the American sees the entire lot of them playing toy soldier with real men's lives. The bridge is central to the plot and it takes on symbolic meaning as both a monument to British ingenuity and the inept weakness of their Japanese captors.

THE GUNS OF NAVARONE have long been silent but the legend of this extraordinary and endearing film lingers on in our memory. They just don't make them like this any more. The script, the score (Dimitri Tiomkin), the cinematography, the actors and the characters they played are indelibly etched into the psyche. I often have fleeting thoughts of this film, happy ones, of the images, the words and the music from this WWII legend. The examination of camaraderie, the morality of killing and not killing, bravery, survival, betrayal, forgiveness and getting the job done are all integrated into a logical and emotional cohesive film that is both entertaining yet important in its representation of the extraordinary human qualities that can only be realized during war. THE GUNS OF NAVARONE is one of my favorite films and the less said the better. I love the opening credits. I just savor my memories of it and get a little warmth in my heart.",1426723200,,2378,4.869135802469136
