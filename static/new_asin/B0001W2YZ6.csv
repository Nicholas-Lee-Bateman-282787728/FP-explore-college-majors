It is a pleasure to view this comedy which creates humor from situations and events that arise from contrasting differences between two cultures which have varying social values and clearly proscribed behaviors between social classes. Best of all, it is amazing how the writers managed to convey respect for the Middle East or Arabic culture  without offending the values which they uphold. Interestingly, this was before it was ""politically correct"" to do so. Fortunately, this film does not resort to mockery, derision or vulgarity which is highly remarkable as the film originated in Hollywood where in modern times low class behavior substitutes for good clean comedy and writing talent.

 The plot revolves around a sheik who is staying at the posh Beverly Hills Hotel and when he enters the lobby and makes eye contact with an attractive blonde haired, blue eyed young American woman. It is clear they have an interest in each other and he would love to meet her but his royal position demands he maintain a serious demeanor.  He can not make any overtures to get her attention or socialize with her. Not only because of his social status but because he is accompanied by guards who watch his every move. Along come the parking lot attendants who see the chemistry and want to intervene to help him out. A few, empathize with his situation of desiring someone of the opposite sex who is unattainable. The contrasts between the two social classes makes for great humor and even more satisfying is how the parking lot attendants come to his rescue, create diversions which allow for the ""forbidden"" contact with the lovely woman.

I enjoyed seeing a young Robert Hegyes play Tico, one of the parking lot attendants who takes on the role of ""solving"" the sheik's problem with this beautiful young lady. Another charming role was played by a young Melanie Griffiths.  Especially enjoyable was seeing Frank Gorshin play Fred Kruger, head of security. He is confounded by the many antics and behavior of the parking lot attendants. It was particularly funny when he made arrangements to have a date in an unoccupied room with an attractive new female desk clerk. It just so happened, the parking lot attendants were using that room for their own purposes and had to clear the room out in a hurry to make it presentable and ready for Kruger and his date. I was most impressed by Kario Salem who played the sheik, he was very handsome and had such a close resemblance to Ben Affleck that it makes me wonder why he never made it into other more well known roles and films. Overall, this was a well made fun comedy which came to a satisfying conclusion. While some scenes were overdone as often happens with slapstick comedies it truly remains a good clean fun entertaining film. Erika Borsos [pepper flower]",1421107200,4,2822,4.806185567010309
2033168,5,B0001W2YZ6,In the spirit of PolIce Academy. You'll know the whole cast some before they were big names and some after. I wish there was a DVD or download option.,1418688000,,150,4.206896551724138
2033169,3,B0001W2YZ6,"""Underground Aces"" had some good moments but there were some scenes that went on too long and some of the acting in the movie was second rate, fortunately the good moments outweigh the scenes that dragged and there were some good performances by Dirk Benedict, Melanie Griffith (before she became a household name), Robert Hegyes, Jerry Orbach and Frank Gorshin, some of my favorite moments of this movie includes them driving erratically in the hotel parking lot, bowling balls falling out of the back of a car, them reassembling a car at a fast pace, the Blitz night scene and the finale scene (won't give that away), this movie is similar to the better known ""Car Wash"" but they have parking lot attendants instead of car washing attendants, overall I give this movie a 6/10",1418083200,,777,4.762962962962963

8016917,4,B0001W2YZ6,"Of course anything starring Dirk Benedict is a masterpiece! This doesn't rank with ""SSSSSSSSSSSSS"" but is nearly as good as ""Georgia Peaches.""

But whoever put together this version on Amazon's streaming service  is smoking something that keeps them from seeing straight. It looks like they tried to block a 4:3 picture for a widescreen effect (provided you use an aspect or zoom button on your remote), but didn't go all the way to the left.",1440633600,,442,4.88
8016918,3,B0001W2YZ6,"It's fine. Family friendly, nothing too inappropriate technically though a few suggestive moments - less than I think Nickelodeon shows at this point. Almost worth watching just to see how much ""appropriate"" has changed in 30 years. Wow.

It's cute enough. It holds it's own. It's not profound, but it's delightful.

For a free amazon prime movie, it works.",1435708800,,357,5.033898305084746
