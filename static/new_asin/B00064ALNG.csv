2166491,4,B00064ALNG,"FRAZETTA: PAINTING WITH FIRE (Razor Digital/Cinemachine) is a long overdue tribute to the greatest fantasy artist of our time, Frank Frazetta.

When I was a kid and first discovered Frazetta's incredible, lavish, frightening, exotic, erotic and fierce art, I have been in awe of not only his graphic skills but his singular imagination.  Warriors, maidens and mythic creatures live out their extreme lives in masterful strokes pen and ink or oil paint dobs and dabs.  Even reissues of old ""Conan"" paperbacks become instant best sellers when his striking art is on the covers.

For many in the film business, Frazetta is the single most influential artist of the last 50 years.

Lance Laspina's wonderful documentary looks at the personal and professional life of Frazetta who was born in Brooklyn in 1928.

This two disc set is an affectionate tribute to this amazing artist and family man.  The most moving extra is a 20 minute photo montage of his life from childhood to the present. Go to FrazettaArtGallery.com for sample of his work.

What is especially astonishing about Frazetta is that he did some of his best paintings totally from memory.  No props, reference photos and no models.  And he did them in a matter of hours.",1107475200,8,1230,4.927184466019417
2166492,5,B00064ALNG,"Stare into the eyes of the ""Barbarian""--if you dare--and behold graphically the embodiment of the power behind the man who created the image.  These are ""images"", after all, which fans from all over the world have admired for decades.  But, behind these images of the heroic lies a real hero, and it is this very real life aspect, amidst the fantasy that we have come to associate with everything ""Frazetta"", that truly makes this film transcendental and insight-full.

The artist as the hero behind the art is what this documentary represents to me.  Director Lance Laspina and his collaborators have done the world an invaluable service by bringing to the screen Frank Frazetta's incredible contribution to the art world, and particularly those artists whose lives he's so permanently touched with creative inspiration.

Still, the film does so much more, because those few artists that may know Frazetta's work but know little about the man who created it will gain much greater appreciation for the reason behind the legend, because of this film.  Even if you're not an artist yourself, or consider yourself as being ""art"" savvy, you will come to recognize in this artist the very human qualities that give tactile dimensionality to any legend.

Heroes stay the course, in good times and in bad.  Heroes are true to their vision and know that the true value of being a hero means overcoming obstacles.  Frazetta has done this very thing throughout his career-more recently corroborated by his determination to overcome the limits imposed on him through a series of strokes that left him unable to use his drawing hand.  This documentary will ""show"" you this resolve in the flesh!

In conclusion, this film has added value because it reveals much more than the genius of an artist, it brings to light the heart that it takes in order to transcend even the limits of creative genius and physicality.  Painting with Fire is a perfect metaphor for capturing the dual aspect of Frazetta's power, which is not only manifested in his artwork but also in his attitude towards life.",1105833600,7,2077,4.936781609195402
2166493,5,B00064ALNG,"They say 1 picture is worth a thousand words...Frank's are easily worth millions.  And I'm sure anything I'd say wouldn't do it justice, so I'll just recommend to get it!",1104105600,3,170,4.666666666666667
2166494,5,B00064ALNG,"I actually saw this on TV recently...can't remember the station, I think it may have been on A&E or Bravo or something, but I found it incredibly captivating.  I became a fan of Frazetta's art like many back in the early 1970's through his astonishing Conan paperback covers and magazine covers for such magazines as Creepy and Eerie.

But until this film I had never actually seen the man behind the art.  He seemed mysterious, enigmatic, which lent that much more aura to his art.  This film relates Frazetta's life from birth to present day.  Here is a guy who is a true man's man.  A sportsman in every sense of the word.  Hunter, camper, golfer, baseball, basketball...Frazetta's well chisled physique as a young man conjures images of the powerful figures he would put to canvas in years to come.

We see frazetta's start as a young cartoonist and learn of his formal art training.  We see him in the days of EC comics drawing fabulous sci-fi and fantasy comic books.  We then move to the era of his fantastic oil paintings for which he is so well known for.  The Conan covers, the movie posters.

Through it all well known artists like Mike Kaluta, Dave Stevens, Berni Wrightson, and many others comment on Frazetta's genius.  He is truly the man who all other artists in the fantasy and sci-fi genres bowed down to.  We see Frazetta surrounded by celebrity friends, many who are collectors of his art.

Through it we see that Frank was a family man, married to the same woman for over 30 years and raising a family.  We see the effects of a stroke which forced Frazetta to have to learn how to paint and draw with his left hand.  An increidible inspiration and testament to his strong will.

Whether your a Frazetta fan or not you're sure to be captivated by this man, formerly as mysterious as the mythic figures he painted.  Outstanding film!  Even though I've seen the film I think the DVD is a must have due to the fantastic extras including the commentary track, Frazetta Gallery, and more.",1103760000,40,2003,4.573033707865169
2166495,5,B00064ALNG,"I agree wholeheartedly with the first reviewer. As an artist, I have been acquainted with Frank's work for the past 30-35 years. I won't deny his influence on some of my work. Neither would most other contemporary artists who are honest with themselves. His body of work is well reprsented here and will include many paintings people who are not already aware of him will recognize.  That said, this film also embraces how the spirit of true genius can refuse to succumb to the limits that are sometimes imposed on we humans by the nature of our physical existence. Frank suffered several strokes (which would be enough to sideline most people) and one of them debilitated his primary painting hand so he switched to his left hand with little noticeable difference in his work. Frank was also a tremendous athlete and, more than likely, would have impacted the realm of professional sports to the same degree as his art, had he made that choice. This film illustrates how belief in one's self and never losing your zest for life can result in superior achievement.",1102464000,8,1064,4.782608695652174
2166496,5,B00064ALNG,"I knew nothing about Frazetta except that he had worked on a cartoon by one of my favorite animators, Ralph Bakshi, called Fire and Ice.

While strolling through the TV guide one night I caught the name Frazetta and immediately tuned to A&E to check out the show since the connection was there.  Boy, was I glad I did.

This documentary acts more like a mini movie or reality docudrama than normal documentary.  You can tell the maker has a genuine interest in the story he is telling.  Frank, although plagued with a speech impediment due to various illnesses,  comes across as a genuine artist with quite an interesting story to tell about his life and work.

It's a must watch to learn more about the most influential artist in the last 1/2 century.

2166497,4,B00064ALNG,"This documentary is very slick in production, and features almost all of Frazetta's living contemporaries.  How often are you going to see Al Williamson speak? Anyways, the creators of this doc could have done two things to help clarify the story:
1.)Hire a narrator.  Instead, they use the often unintenionally hilarious comments of this goofy academic fanboy (can't remember his name)as a sort of unofficial narration.  The often over-the-topness of his analysis of Frank's artwork only undermines anything else he has to say.  Due to Frazetta's slurred speech, it can be tough to follow what he's saying, and a strong narration would have helped to direct the viewer through the events.

2.)Congratulations on knowing how to use Final Cut.  Maybe they could have let off on the effects.  The headings for each segment, which were always blazing away with digital effects and a Frazetta painting in the background, tend to come off comical when the subject of that section is light-hearted.  There were a few points when I said to myself, ""Come on, don't sink under your own weight."" But at times, that's what they did.

But Frazetta's artwork is strong enough to overcome the errors of a couple of filmakers.  If you're not a fan of Frazetta, it's okay, because if you're a fan of classic comics and animation you'll still get to see comments from your heroes to more than make up for it.",1253923200,4,1391,4.8559322033898304
2166498,4,B00064ALNG,"A Must Have for Frazetta Aficionados', A warm glance at the things he cherishes, takes note of as well as a glimpse of the challenges and stuggles he has met. It means to be simple without affectation of questionable intellectualism. And does succeed I think. Yet it is clear that his gifts remain undimmed by the trials visited apoun his health and times' nagging insistence that passionate men ought surrender to the inevitable. ""It follows suit nicely"" That just being himself brings out the genius of the human spirit in defiant efforts and heart felt play. It owns a four star rating naturally, super-naturally. It will be for others to raise it higher if such is needed. You have my own words herein in my attempt to do justice to it. It what it is, something of Frazetta.",1225584000,,778,4.644927536231884

2166500,4,B00064ALNG,"This the anatomy of an artist's life. The effort was well done, though not perfect. It's hard to make retrospective documentaries of personalities that are popular. Too glowing and the work looks like it's catering to the subject. Too honest and the feature will not meet approval with those followers. The balancing act is well done in this feature because it lets the artist, his family and friends, and surprisingly his peers and colleagues, all, carve out the narrative that is the artist's life, past and present. My favorite parts are Frank visiting his old friends in Brooklyn.
What really makes this documentary stand out is the way it balances Frank Frazetta's life with his work, his art and it's impact on both the fans, family and even the illustration community. There's little doubt that Frank Frazetta and his work have had a lasting impact on the popular arts and publishing. His championing of artists' and illustrators' rights alone has made publishers recognize the affect art has on selling products from cars to books and the way art will always belong to the artist regardless of what it's used for.
I recommend this for anyone interested in the artistic process as well as the life of an artist.",1207785600,,1218,4.860576923076923

The DVD was very well done. Documented well with plenty of extras and pictures of Frank's life. The music was very cool, too. I wish it would have been made in a higher resolution, though. It had major grain issues and poor quality, but otherwise it's a great DVD with plenty of information about the life of Frank Frazetta.

2166503,4,B00064ALNG,"Frazetta has been overlooked as a genuine artist because of his fame in the 70's. As a great fan at that time, my own esteem of him has waned over the years only because the ""content"" of his artwork... babes, muscle bound heroes, battle, etc... is, simply put, juvenile and rather empty.
This biography shows what a natural, physical, phenomenal talent the man really is. So few artists can simply sit down, without preparation, and create stunning visual works as visceral and beautiful as this man. Nothing gets in the way of his intense physicality being channeled through his pen and brush. This movie shows him to be an unassuming, average joe on the surface, but with a harnessed, god-given power that frankly no one in the last century can lay claim to. His influence on other artists in the genre has been incredibly positive and widespread to an extent not seen since Maxfield Parrish.",1196899200,,894,4.774193548387097
2166504,4,B00064ALNG,"I enjoyed this insider's look into Frank Frazetta's museum, career, and friends.  He must have been a great guy to have attracted so many caring friends.

But I don't believe that he is the most influential artist of the last 50 years.  No way, even if after seeing this documentary I now believe he had enormous influence in the way bad movies look.

John Milius is here to say that, even though everyone in Hollywood wanted their movies to look like living Franzettas, only Conan pulled that off--sort of a slap in the face of Ralph Bakshi, who also swans around bragging that at least FIRE AND ICE had direct involvement from the man himself.  It's interesting watching the way the editor (and director) pits Bakshi against Milius, but in the unscripted portions of the show it seems that Franzetta really cares for Bakshi as a man, whereas Milius seems like just another crazed fan.

I wonder what the film would have been like if it had been released after Franzetta's death.  If I have one problem with it, it's too hagiographic.  It's crazy, and counterproductive, to imply that not only is Franzetta a great artist, but he is also a great ""sportsman,"" golfer, photographer, husband, etc.  The movie comes in chapters, with titles, titles perhaps half-humorously echoing ""Conan the Barbarian,"" but instead it's ""Franzetta the Sportsman,"" and so forth.  Sorry, it's just a little over the top for me!  I know purists will retort that Franzetta's essence is ""over the top"" and that's why he's the king of Sword and Sorcery, but those countless vanity shots of his John Rechy/Sly Stallone body when young, claim a status for him as matinee idol that just seems silly.  And since his tragic stroke, he looks exactly like my late comedy favorite Rodney Dangerfield, yet no one comments on this!  Maybe they're afraid to offend him.  I wish there was some deeper perspective on him than just this tale of genius unleashed, but that's all there is.  That's okay though, because what we have here is great and it is heartwarming--the triumphant yet melancholy underscore sees to that--not to mention aged Rodney Dangerfield style Frank Franzetta playing the Moonlight Sonata and Fur Elise in the twilight of his years.  And Bo Derek gives the movie some needed 70sism; it's always great to see her, especially in a non-acting role, so you don't have to eat your cake to have it too!",1191456000,,2381,4.784841075794621
2166505,4,B00064ALNG,"I got this more or less on a whim after seeing some of Frazetta's material online at his website.  I had been familiar with his work, but never knew much about the man himself.  Basically, Frazetta is just a guy from Brooklyn,NY with a huge imagination, and viewing this is a great way to see that imagination has no limit.  His artwork makes you want to go out and read every single piece of old time ""pulp book""  available.  In fact, this movie reveals that sales for ""Conan"" titles rose based on his cover drawings alone.

  It is kind of sad that he has a condition that prevents him from doing much work nowadays, but he still works nonetheless.  This movie is very inspirational in that regard, and I hope more people view it.",1178928000,,732,4.402985074626866
2166506,5,B00064ALNG,"Frazetta is not only an amazing, ground-breaking artist, but an amazing human being as well. I was somewhat familiar w/his artwork, mostly from the Molly Hatchet album covers of the '70's; However, I was totally unaware of this man's rich history, his upbringing, and his tireless dedication to family. This is a man to admire on many levels, and to hear others speak such praise of him on this disc will bring a tear to your eye. Talented, humble(I can't stress this enough!!!), and unrelenting, Frazetta has overcome obstacle after obstacle, never complaining, only adjusting and perfecting what is in many eyes already perfection. I am not an artist, but this documentary had me rivited; The human side to this man's story and the art he has so lovingly created is something that can be enjoyed by all, artist or not. One of the best things I have seen in the last six months. I came away from this with the utmost respect for this man and the legions of artists he has inspired. This documentary is also filled with alot of humor and insight(much more than I ever expected). What a brilliant, compassionate man. Simply remarkable on every level!!!!",1178841600,,1152,4.765
2166507,5,B00064ALNG,"Hands down, this is simply the best documentary to deal with the world of comics/fantasy/scifi and anything in those realms.  The artist himself gives fantastic insight into his history and creative process.  The people in the industry who were inspired by him and ended up being respected in their own rights are all entertaining and informative.  The use of CGI type manipulation of the original artwork is kept to a minimum, and for the most part the artwork is displayed to help punctuate the narration.  It is lots of artwork and all handled brilliantly.  If you are a fan, then this is a must have.  A MUST HAVE!!!!",1178409600,2,621,4.703703703703703

2166509,4,B00064ALNG,"Even though the documentary has a feeling of amateur filmmaking to it, it doesn't really matter with an artist like Frazetta.  In a documentary about a character such as Frazetta, you're really taken in by the ENERGY and ATTITUDE this guy gives off, and you realize that, through his will alone, he would have succeeded in whatever he chose as a profession.

  Frazetta's life harkens back to a time when the art world was close and intimate.  He tells stories of just sauntering into Mad Magazine's studio, and being thrown a few pages to draw while he was there.  It varies greatly from today's world of secretaries and appointments and other formalities.  The nostalgia is there, as well as the age.  You see Frazetta in a point where the tiger has a little less bite in him.

  But overall, as an artist, and an aficionado, you can't help but really admire all the accomplishments this man has forged over the decades.  I will, no doubt, always strive to be a fraction as amazing as he is, and hopefully watching his accomplishments on this DVD will continue to inspire artists for years to come.",1173398400,,1100,4.642487046632124

2166512,5,B00064ALNG,"Like just about everyone, I discovered Frazetta as a teenager.  I saw the magazine and book covers and recognized something special in his work -- the verve, the sensuality, the almost cavalier treatment of the subject matter.  Its all there.

I had hoped I could respect the man.  Too often my heroes have disappointed.  Too many were leechers and jerks -- but not Frank.  He was better than I had dared to hope.  He is a real man, with interests besides art and his reputation.  He is not a self-promoter and he is an excellent father and husband and friend and son from all accounts.

His work seems particularly suited to the subjects he illustrated.  The sensuality and power are perfect for Tarzan, John Carter of Mars, and Conan.  As a younger man I had wished he had done more Tolkien.  (You know, one master meets another.)  But now I am glad he did not.  The few works he did create seem out of sinc with Tolkien's work.  Tolkien has hints of holiness (completely missed by the Jackson films) that Frazetta is not equipped to express.  He can't even draw a root or leaf without exuding sensuality.

  However this documentary is still worth owning if you are a Frank Frazetta fan. I discovered Frank's art in the mid 60's.  I was a fan of Creepy and Eerie Comics and also the Conan series that came out in paperback.  I never really was able to finish the novels, but I bought them (at 45 cents a pop) because I dug those covers.  Frazetta painted them all.  As I got older my interest never went away.  I bought his art books and trading cards.  But I never knew much about the artist himself.  He seemed to be a mysterious human.  Well I found out by seeing this DVD that he is a warm and loving family man. His wife (and business manager) and he have been together since they met as teens.  He also is loyal to his friends, some of whom are shown today as old men, but they played ball together as young men. Frazetta has had his ups and downs with health issues, but his art always shines.  This is a wonderful tribute to a fine gentleman, good athlete, and a great artist, and it fascinated me. If you are a Frazetta fan, then I recommend that you purchase it as well. I will probably watch it from time to time even though I know how it ends.",1130544000,3,1397,4.258555133079848
2166515,5,B00064ALNG,"I recently received a present of the Ralph Bakshi animated film ""FIRE & ICE"" and was was shocked to see the documentary PAINTING WITH FIRE on Disc-2.

I quickly slipped the disc into the player and pressed ""play""...

Right, I'm a Frazetta nut and so I was thinking there's NO way they'll do a good documentary on the guy. Wrong! They did a good job indeed.

The feature-length documentary covers Frazetta's early life and fills in the missing blanks about what he did in the years when he had to fend for himself. For an artist who is extremely private and reclusive, this film peeled back the layers of mystery and revealed the man beneath. It's a very intimate portrait and one that throws light on many aspects of his life as a sportsman and a devoted family man.

The film opens with an absolutely stunning 3-D rendering of the Clayburn Moore ""Conan the Barbarian"" statue and the painting literally comes to life and moves. The facial bones twitch and the eyes of the Barbarian blaze with intense fire, the sword drips with blood and the slave girl grips onto his leg with unbridled lust conveyed in her luscious legs and flowing hair and across the sky huge vultures circle for the meat on the pile of corpses that the Barbarian stands knee deep in. Skulls lie crushed all around and the sun drips golden fire all over the landscape behind this might warrior.

What a truly inspirational opening to the film.

I adored the method used to illustrate and showcase the oil paintings. The colours were rich and the lighting was magnificent. It was like seeing the artworks for the first time. It's one thing seeing them in books and another thing to see them displayed on the screen in such vivid detail. And, what a lovely surprise it was to see rare sketches and variant versions of some of Frazetta's paintings in this film.

Laspina's method of using ""chapters"" to sketch though Frazetta's life reminded me of a book-style presentation and it worked splendidly. This was a very effective format and allowed the viewer to focus in on the different aspects of Frazetta's varied life.

It was great to see Frazetta talk and reminisce about the old days. And despite his ill-health this man is still a fighter! And did you notice that in MANY of the paintings it is Frazetta himself who is the central figure for the model? Just take a careful look at ""Conan the Adventurer"" (the Clayburn statue) and you'll realize it's none other than Frazetta himself! The lighting in the film really brought out subtle details that are missing in the books. The art had much greater shading and revealed acres of stuff that the books can never get close to due to their ""flat"" printing process and the quality of paper used.

It was interesting to note that because Frazetta had such a busy life as a sportsman, he sometimes ran out of time for his commissions and was thus reduced to painting the pieces in a matter of hours. If he had run out of paper he would simply tear out a plank of wood from the floorboard and use that as a canvas. He would make a pot of coffee, put on a classical record and finish the painting in six hours or so. He'd then spend a week recovering from this intense battle between his creative juices and his physical body. His hands would literally shake with the exertion after painting these pieces. The impulse and speed of the work actually lent his finished pieces a rawness and savagery that is sorely lacking in the works of other painters such as Boris Vallejo.

The film also discussed the influence that Frazetta has had on the world of film, literature and art. John Milius, Simon Bisley, Ralph Bakshi, Sylvester Stallone, George Lucas, Bernie Wrightson, Clint Eastwood, Michael Kaluta, Steven Spielberg, etc , etc, have all used Frazetta's famous style in some of their works.

And to compare Frazetta to Michelangelo and Da Vinci was valid. Frzaetta is sometimes ignored by the Fine Art community because he is regarded as an ""illustrator"". Well, in that case, so were all the past greats because they also illustrated books e.g. The Holy Bible. I think there is idle snobbery levelled at Frazetta because his subject matter usually depicts Fantasy scenes. Nevertheless, Frazetta does not need to prove himself to the Art critics because this man can paint with oils, water-colours, ink, he has produced prints and worked on canvas and also delivered stunning sculptures. A man of many talents then! Just like his fellow painters from the Renaissance period.

I would have preferred this film to have run for six hours but I can't complain too much since they did cover many of the bases. Even the end credits proved to be fun. Laspina left a little clip after the film closed for the fans - we see Ralph Bakshi walking away from the Frazetta museum with a huge stolen canvas stuck under his shirt!

All I now need to do is see the Special Edition of this documentary which contains a second disc of supplemental material where we see Frazetta drawing a panther and the picture gallery contained on the DVD is supposed to be brilliant.

Highly Recommended.",1125878400,11,5086,4.661830357142857
2166516,5,B00064ALNG,"I am pretty sure that the first time I saw a Frank Frazetta cover it would have been a copy of ""Eerie"" or ""Creepy"" at the PX.  The first covers I owned of paperbacks with Frazetta art would have been the Edgar Rice Burroughs paper backs put out by Ace, which is when I would have learned Frazetta's name and start to automatically associate it with his distinctive artwork of half-naked warriors and sensual women in exotic settings, along with his signature (the latter being as iconic a signature for representing an artist's style as you will ever come across).  Then, of course, there are all the Lancer paperback reprints of Conan the Barbarian, which certainly comprises his most famous body of work.  As for what was the first Frazetta poster I owned, that is easy: ""The Frost Giant's Daughter"" (a.k.a. the cover of ""Conan the Cimmerian"").

""Frazetta: Painting with Fire"" is a 2003 documentary put together by Lance Laspina that is clearly a labor of love.  Laspina combines conversations with the artist himself with home movies and an impressive collection of talking heads that include family members, others artists (from Neal Adams to Berni Wrightson), and fans (including John Milius and Bo Derek).  We also get to see the Frazetta Museum on his property in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania as Frank looks at his work and offers his remembrances.  The documentary on Disc 1 runs two-hours and has an audio commentary track by Laspina and producer Jeremy J. DiFiore.  Primarily what we have here is a combination biography and testimonial to the artist.  There are a few attempts to make an appropriate critical appreciate for this technique, but mostly ""Frazetta"" deals with anecdotes and declarations attesting to his importance in the realm of art depicting fantasy, science fiction, and adventure.

On Disc 2 we get to watch Frank draw a mirror image of the lion from his ""Egyptian Egypt"" painting left-handed (he has had to switch drawing hands because of a series of strokes), while talking periodically about his artistic process on August 24, 2000.  Then there is a lengthy montage of photographs from the life of the artist, which must include pretty much every photo of Frank the Frazetta family owns, set to music from the documentary (this makes for interesting contrasts between the overly dramatic music playing over shots of Frank with his kids at the beach, which then segues to Beethoven's ""Moonlight Sonata"" playing while Frank paints Conan, shoots golf, and poses with the likes of George Lucas, Clint Eastwood and Bo Derek).  We also have Home Movies of Frank, Elle, the family, and the Frazetta Children, accompanied by a radio interview with Frank conducted in 1994.  A section is devoted to Ralph Bakshi's ""Fire and Ice,"" which includes ""Evil Ice Lord Memoir,"" consisting of actor Sean Hannon's notes on the shooting of the production, and a gallery of German lobby cards for the animated film.  Then there are the deleted scenes, outtakes and stories from the documentary, but they come across as minor concerns compared to just watching Frazetta's artwork go by on your television screen.

These are multiple gallery tours of rare art on the bonus disc, which are not restricted to a simple series of shots of each work, but often include close ups of key details, for which I am appreciative.  Even though these tours of prelims, oils, sculptures, comics and the rest are done as slide shows you can use the chapter stops to move through them at your own pace, which is an unexpectedly nice touch.  Besides, seeing the rough sketches that Frazetta did for some of your favorite paintings or pages of some of his comic book art from long again is certainly a treat.  A gallery of artwork by Frazetta's peers allows you to judge who succeeds best in the imitations is the sincerest form of flattery department (my votes are for Alex Horley, Sam Wood, and Todd Lockwood).  Artist Bios are provided by Brom, Neal Adams, and the rest of the talking heads from the documentary as well.  This is a 2-DVD set where either DVD is probably enough to make a Frazetta fan deliriously happy.",1122595200,20,4114,4.86676217765043

Frazetta's art style always amazed me but this look at his life and who he was is one of the best things I own. The dude painted like a bad ass and acted like a bad ass, plain and simple.

Well worth the money, especially now that he's passed on.",1369958400,,385,4.1891891891891895

8038439,5,B00064ALNG,"You don't have to be an action hero fan to appreciate the art of Frazetta, his work is exceptional to any artist's eye.  I first saw this documentary on Sundance I think it was, quite a few years ago.  I watched it over and over and never forgot the brilliance of his talent.  I maintain a healthy artist's library so had to add this DVD to it .  Perfect!",1361145600,,355,4.101449275362318
8038440,5,B00064ALNG,"This DVD is about the artist Frank Frezetta. I had known him from the time I was 12 years old looking at books in the school library. I was a young artist at the time and a great fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs , ""Tarzan"" series, I reached for another book by that author and was blown away by the cover art. It was ""A Princess of Mars"". Later when stopping off at book stores as I road the bus home from art School, I would squander my lunch money with glee on any book with a Frezetta cover. That was in the seventies and now I have an opportunity to hear from his own words how he did it and who his contemporaries were. I bought this DVD in reaction to the news of his passing on may the 10, 2010 know there's another great artist in Heaven.",1293753600,,741,3.9798657718120807
8038441,5,B00064ALNG,"What an amazingly intimate portrait of one of the world's greatest illustrators. This documentary contains interviews, personal pictures and commentary by his peers and his family. Who would guess that the fantastical images he created came completely from his imagination. You get to see him actually sketch a feline creature in his signature style. Just him with a pencil and paper. BAM! There it is. This documentary portrays Frank as an unpretentious, hard working class guy with a tremendous amount of talent, and a bit of luck. I'm glad that I purchased this dvd and I think anyone who appreciates his art will like viewing this documentary.",1285113600,,647,5.05607476635514
8038442,4,B00064ALNG,"I saw this little gem of a documentary about a year ago, and it is my fault I have not written it up sooner.

I never knew what to make of Frazetta's art.  On the one hand, it would be so simple to dismiss it as pulp garbage not worth a second look.  But, if that is true, why do the eyes keep coming back and back to his work?  I think it is for the simple reason that Frazetta had that rarest of artistic gifts - the power to provoke emotional response through his work.  Frazetta is not only one of the great artists of the 20th century popular imagination, but one of the great shapers of that imagination.  And this wonderful little documentary tells his story very well.

This is not a slick production.  It is a simple narrative documentary with generous interviews with the artist and his contemporaries who are talking quite seriously about the merits of Frazetta's work and the man himself.  And I was shocked to see that Frazetta was really ""Joe Six-Pack,"" a normal, humorous guy from New York with a life anyone could recognize.  He is just one of those lucky few who had a galaxy of imagination in his mind and hands.  But, the ""humanization"" of Frazetta in no way diminishes the art of the fantastic that was his forte.  And, any complaints about how he protrays women in his art should be dispelled by his explanation of how he sees women - not as objects or ""fetish-bots,"" but beautiful and empowered.  His simple commentary allowed me to look at his work in a new way.  And I was very pleased by what I saw.

It's a warm but frank documentary, as where, for example, Frazetta discussed his illnesses and accompanying resentments with candor and frustrated grace.  Excellent.

A must for Frazetta fans, a must for both professional and amateur artists.

Recommended!",1259884800,,1782,4.515625
