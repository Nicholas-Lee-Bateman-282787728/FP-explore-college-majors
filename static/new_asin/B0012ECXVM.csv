3087331,5,B0012ECXVM,I loved when this show was on. I use to wait each week for a new one. Now I just pop in the dvds and watch. Whats going to be sad is when I get to the last show in season 3.,1236124800,5,173,3.142857142857143
3087332,5,B0012ECXVM,"I ordered this set because I enjoyed the show when it aired in the 80's and I already had the first season.  It was alot of fun watching again.  I watched the entire set in one weekend.  I had remembered the Christmas show when it first aired and was a little disappointed that they changed the final song on the DVD from what aired on TV. It was John Lennon's ""War is over"" on TV which made the ending so memorable.  Every time I hear that song since I think of that episode but the DVD had some terrible song but the episode was still good.  Glad I got it.",1231286400,3,558,4.036363636363636
3087333,5,B0012ECXVM,"I really enjoyed all three seasons! But for some reason, they killed off Lt. Quinlan, who survived first two seasons, then replaced him with sexy blonde cop who is a lot more cooperative with the 3 RipTide Detectives. You always wonder what went on behind the scenes when series replaces a main character.. did actor hold out for too much money? Sagging ratings? Who knows.. but it seemed kind of stilted, since he was hit by a DE-celerating car, and in many similar stunts in show, other characters were hit a lot harder, and always seemed to get up and walk away! It's regretable this was the last season, as I really enjoyed this show!",1225929600,,638,4.556521739130435

3087335,5,B0012ECXVM,"VEI proves once again that they care about the fans! All three seasons of Riptide, released QUICKLY! For comparison, Sony released only the first season of Riptide, and I'd be willing to bet that's the only release you'll see from them! Anyone purchasing Riptide on DVD should NOT PURCHASE the Sony release of season one. If a DVD releasing company does not support the fans, we should not support THEM!

Riptide season three;

The final season, featuring 22 episodes and such notable guest stars as; Richard Hatch (Battlestar Galactica), Jane Badler (V), Cesar Romero (Batman), Barbi Benton (Playboy), Steve Allen (The Steve Allen Show), and many more!

Now, I can't wait for ""Stingray"" to be released! Another great Stephen J, Cannell creation!

I would love to see VEI re-release all of the Stephen J. Cannell TV series that Anchor Bay ruined. Even if they could not restore all of the original music, I'm sure almost ANYONE could do a better job releasing ""Hunter"", ""21 Jump Street"", and ""the Greatest American Hero"". Anchor Bay basically RUINED each one of those series with HORRIBLE edits and pathetic music replacements! I realize that VEI has also changed SOME music on Riptide, but they have done a far better job than Anchor Bay ever did! VEI also QUICKLY released all three seasons of Hardcastle and McCormick, unedited!

Three cheers for VEI, I hope they're listening!

Nick and Cody are the muscles and Murray is a computer wizard of the trio and together they solve even the hardest cases.

This 1985-86 Season also takes me back to memory lane to when it was part of NBC's Tuesday night line-up when THE A-TEAM was at 8PM, followed by RIPTIDE at 9PM, and topped off by REMINGTON STEELE at 10PM when NBC's motto was ""Let's All Be There"".

8245521,4,B0012ECXVM,"The third season of Riptide was the best. It had new opening credits. Nick had a new style of dressing (which for better or worse I tried to copy in high school). Some of the stories are still pretty silly, but there are also some good moments where it gets a little deeper. Most of the music has been replaced. The Christmas episode lost ""Happy Christmas"" and it was replaced by some generic pop junk which wasn't even made when the show originally aired. The one song they did keep, and kudos to them for doing it, was ""The Famous Final Scene"" in the episode where Cody says Goodbye to his gorlfriend. Also there is a Robin Hood episode that originally used scenes from the Errol Flynn movie--they cut out those scenes in the DVD. But it's still a great season!  Highly recommended!",1470787200,,784,4.4825174825174825
