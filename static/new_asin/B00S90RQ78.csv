6965048,3,B00S90RQ78,I love this show but picture quality of the dvd is HORRIBLE. They clearly want you to pay the extra price for the blu ray because you know they can make a dvd that's not fuzzy and grainy like this.,1406419200,,197,3.95

6965077,5,B00S90RQ78,"This show is hilarious. The constant sexual innuendos are crazy funny! And you get 2 seasons together! My husband and I  watched the first season in almost one sitting. Funniest show I think I have ever seem. The acting is kinda cheesy but that totally make the show even better! Caroline is a rich girl who has everything taken from her because her father ripped everyone off and Max is a waitress at a Diner with a totally ""who cares?"" attitude. They move in together as roomies and away it goes. Laugh out loud entertainment!",1471392000,,528,4.557894736842106
