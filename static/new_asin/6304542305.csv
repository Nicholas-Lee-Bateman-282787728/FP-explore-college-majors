7875132,5,6304542305,"The title of Mario Del Monaco's VHS is no mistake, a singing volcano. I saw him live at The Metropolitan Opera about 40 times.  His voice was huge and his high notes had tremendous squillo.  His performances of Andrea Chenier, Canio, and Don Alvaro are the best I have seen. His Otello was especially memorable.  He did not sing with subtlety, so his Duke of Mantua, Cavaradossi, and Radames were not complete successes.  No tenor can match him today.",1361923200,,451,4.670886075949367
