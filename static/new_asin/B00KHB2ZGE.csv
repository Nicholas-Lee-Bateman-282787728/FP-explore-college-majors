8658901,5,B00KHB2ZGE,"A really excellent WWI series mixing documentary photos and footage with reenacted scenes.  Rather than being divided into the 14 stories of the title, there are 8 episodes that, while tending to have a heavy focus on one particular subject (the home front, romance/sex, technological advances, etc.), progress through the war more or less from beginning to end, containing within and/or across them, acted scenes from the lives of the fourteen chosen individuals whose writings recorded their wartime experiences (many other first person recollections are also quoted).

The fourteen featured individuals are: Marina Yurlova, Louis Barthas, Ernst Jnger, Charles Edward Montague, Charles Edward Montague, Kthe Kollwitz, Yves Congar, Karl Kasser, Vincenzo dAquila, Elfriede Kuhr, Gabrielle M. West, Ethel Cooper, Marie Pireaud, and Paul Pireaud.  (probably the most time is spent with Yurlova, Barthas, Jnger, and Kuhr.  I had previously read translations of Barthas and Jnger's books on their respective experiences and it was an interest in seeing if Louis Barthas' experiences had ever been depicted in film or television that actually lead me to this production in the first place.  This definitely didn't disappoint there, but I'd still love to see more!)  The decision to have all the different characters speak their own languages really added to the mood/real feeling of the acted scenes.

As someone whose interest in WWI (and history in general) tends toward the human stories/personal experiences side of things, it was, perhaps, inevitable that I found this both an interesting and touching program.  Highly recommended to those that like this sort of thing!",1490227200,,1669,5.466926070038911
8658902,5,B00KHB2ZGE,This program is a hidden gem for anyone interested in the First World War.  It is very well produced and follows the true stories and writings of multiple people who saw the war in very unique ways.  The reenactments are done with quality and attention to detail and go well with the original letters and writings which it follows.  Very cool how it follows people from all sides of the conflict.  Quality purchase glad to own it.,1447891200,,430,4.545454545454546
8658903,5,B00KHB2ZGE,"this is not only the best documentary I have ever viewed on any war, but a great history on the senselessness of war and how governments will lie to get your children to die for King and Country.  After watching this on Netflix, I must have this in my personal collection to show my grandsons someday.",1427155200,,301,4.375
8658904,5,B00KHB2ZGE,"Great Stories, interwoven in a real new way, much more than a mere ""docu-drama"". Something like a real first documentary SERIES, told with the knowledge and the instruments of the second ""Golden Age"" of television.",1424131200,,214,5.142857142857143
8658905,5,B00KHB2ZGE,"This is a view of the war from as many different perspectives as possible, and it does not disappoint. Coming from diaries, journals, and letters, this is accuracy and reality at its' best. In this time, the 100th Anniversary of World War I, we need more like this. I applaud BBC for being able to coordinate with so many production companies from so many different countries in order to come up with a masterpiece such as this. For anyone who studies the history of ""The War to End All Wars"", this DVD is a must.",1420243200,11,513,4.410526315789474

8658907,3,B00KHB2ZGE,"This is a review of the offering, NOT of the movie as I have NO idea of what the movie is about.  I say offering as the exact contents of the disk are described nowhere!  ""14 War Stories""?  Is this a collection of 14 war films, or perhaps 14 stories from  war veterans?  Who Knows!  No editorial review to describe the dvd.  TWO 5 star reviews NEITHER of which discuss the contents of the offering or the basis of justification for granting 5 stars.  (I entered 3 because I will certainly not give five nor one to a film that may or may not deserve the praise or condemnation, and I DID have to enter something.)  As a commercial dvd offering, this one rates a 0!  Come on Amazon!  You can do better than this.",1413936000,7,710,4.185185185185185

8658909,5,B00KHB2ZGE,"So well done, I don't think I could ever watch it a second time. Extremely personal approach to the insanity of war.",1408665600,14,116,4.318181818181818
