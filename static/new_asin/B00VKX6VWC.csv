7093326,5,B00VKX6VWC,"Darkly comic and quirky, this series is such great fun, you may want to dust off that metal detector and try your own luck at finding fortune underfoot. Of course it's tough to compete with Andy and Lance (MacKenzie Crook from Game of Thrones, Toby Jones from The Hunger Games). These lads are smart enough to know even junk can find a buyer on ebay, but they're looking for the bigger, better score--namely, the rumored existence of a Saxon-era windfall. All they need is time and patience, but life keeps getting in their way, not to mention all those matchbox cars! Sophie, (Aimee Fifion-Edwards) a newcomer to 'detecting' wants to help the pair, and adds her enthusiasm to their quest. I had no idea what to expect of this series, but between its sly pop cultural references, the bittersweet romantic tinges and the treasure hunting duo,  with LOL zingers out of nowhere, it's fresh and fun and sets viewers up to want more, more, more, because we need to know how it all turns out! Binge watch the entire half dozen episodes and check out the behind the scenes feature for more enlightenment. Truly a gem, and you don't need a metal detector to find it.",1439769600,13,1158,4.621359223300971
7093327,5,B00VKX6VWC,"Detectorists used metal detectors and spend hours treading fields in search of artifacts. Gold is the ultimate, and ""detectorists"" is a series about 2 middle age men who are zany serious about their hobby.  It is a fun character comedy series that includes members of the DMDC (Danebury Metal Detecting Club). Other unique and hilariously quirky characters like a mad farmer, & female companions round out the fun group. Beautiful to view--filmed in Suffolk.

Mackenzie Crook (Pirates of the Caribbean) plays Andy, & also is writer/director. Lance is played by Toby Jones (Harry Potter & Hunger Games). Others in all 6 episodes include Rachael Stirling (Bletchley Circle), Lucy Benjamin, Aimee-Ffion Edwards, Gerard Horan, Divian Ladwa, & Pearce Quigley. Sophie Thompson (Emma) and David Sterne both in 5. A good group that make the series funny and eccentrically believable, the reason for the BAFTA win.

7093328,5,B00VKX6VWC,"This is a quiet little gem of a show. Andy Stone and Lance Stater are best friends, united in their love of treasure-hunting with a metal detector. They are careful to make the distinction. The machine is called a detector. The man who handles the machine is called a detectorist.

Or woman, as the case may be. Into the fellows' hum-drum lives comes Sophie, a young university student studying ancient history. What better way to get face-to-face with history than to uncover an ancient artifact. This is just a hobby for Andy and Lance, but they dream of finding something big. As Andy tells his girlfriend, Becky, ""I need to find a new place to search. All we turn up these days is litter and ring pulls. This is the land of the Saxons. I want to discover where they buried their warriors and their kings.""

At the next meeting of the DMDC, or Danebury Metal Detecting Club, they decide to get permission to detect on Lawrence Bishop's farm. Terry, the club president, describes Bishop as ""mad as a frog"". Not only that, but, ""people have tried to get permission, but he always refuses. Doesn't want people digging around on his land.... His wife disappeared years back."" And Terry, now retired,  was one of the policemen who worked on the case, so he knows of what he speaks.

A good drama needs to have a bad guy, or bad guys, and ""Detectorists"" has the Antiquisearchers, a rival detectoring club. In a hobby where permissions are as valuable as gold, you can anticipate underhanded dealings.

Detectorists originally aired in October 2014. It has 6 episodes totaling 180 minutes of show. The DVD presents the show in 16:9 widescreen and stereo. I have the 1-disc DVD issue, and it has English subtitles available on the episodes and on the one DVD Bonus Extra.

A Series 2 has been commissioned, and will air in late 2015. I'm looking forward to it.

DVD Bonus Extra
""Behind-the-Scenes"" (24 minutes) Commentators include Adam Tandy (producer), Mackenzie Crook (writer, director, and plays Andy), Rachael Stirling (plays Becky), Toby Jones (plays Lance), Lucy Benjamin (plays Maggie, Toby's ex-wife), Adam Riches (plays Tony), Aim&eacute;e-Ffion Edwards (plays Sophie). The small village of Gorford, on the coast of Suffolk, stands in for the fictional town of Danebury. This behind-the-scene featurette was filmed on one day of shooting, the scene with the pub quiz. The actors talk about their characters and the show. Toby says, ""One of the things, I think, that's most charming about the whole show is it's humanity"" The detectorists may be compulsive about their hobby, but ""they're not freaks. but because these hobbies are marginal, they can sometimes be parodied as freaks.""

But not in this show. I found it bombast-free, almost gently flowing, realistic and uncynical. And funny! A lot of the humor is understated, but I had laugh-out-loud moments. Sheila's lemonade was one time, and then there's the explosion in the paddock.

If Mackenzie Crook looks familiar, it may be because he's the pirate whose eye pops out in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie series.

Trivia: The club searches for ""the final resting place of Sexred, King of the East Saxons."" Sexred was a real person who died in 626 in battle, after only a year as king. Also, Lance and Andy love quiz shows. They mention Jeremy Paxman, who is the face of the very real University Challenge TV series. As of April 2015, this British quiz show has been on the air for 1655 episodes and was created after its English producer saw the American show, ""College Bowl"".

Well-acted, excellently scripted and funny, but not in an overheated manic way.

EDITED to ADD:  Series 2 is now available. It is even funnier!

7093359,5,B00VKX6VWC,"Supposedly, series 3 took an extra year because Mackenzie Crook wasn't sure he had another season's worth of story to tell that he felt was good enough to stand with the first two, near-perfect seasons. Luckily for all of us, he did -- and it brings to conclusion all the parts of the earlier storylines that needed closure in the most satisfying way. This season is perhaps a shade heavier-handed in its humor than the first two, but everything is forgiven because it also provides indelible moments the show needed to have.",1530921600,3,525,4.717391304347826

7093363,5,B00VKX6VWC,"Id never heard of this series until season 3 came my way but Im glad it did. What I found was that the series is one of the driest and funniest shows to come from British TV.

The show revolves around two main characters. Andy Stone (Mackenzie Crook), an agency worker with a degree in archeology thats going to waste, is married with a child, forced due to his work situation to live with his mother-in-law (Dianna Rigg). Lance Stater (Toby Jones) is a forklift truck driver and amateur musician. The two are best friends and both part of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club (DMDC).

Living in Danebury near Essex the main plot of the show is what takes place in their lives and how it revolves around their hobby which is being detectorists. Now Im not saying detectives but detectorists, someone who uses a metal detector trying to find treasure or historical items. With season three I gathered that theyve were granted permission to go over the same piece of land for some time now, with little luck to date.

This season finds Lance no longer living alone as his daughter Kate (Alexa Davis) has moved back in with him. Shes inconsiderate of his home and life, leaving the place a mess not cleaning up after herself and uncaring of any time he wants to spend in his own home with his girlfriend Toni (Rebecca Callard). The pair could spend time together at her place except that she lives in a houseboat and the waves make Lace seasick, the focus of one episode.

Andy on the other hand has found his dream job, working on a crew checking excavation sites in the hopes of discovering ancient relics. That comes crashing down around him when he discovers one, a set of tiles that excites him. Until the foreman tells him to ignore them and the next day he shows to work to find them covered over. It turns out the company he works for is more inclined to satisfy the clients who employ them by ignoring things like this to sign off that construction can continue without fear of disturbing anything.

What brings the pair together is their scouting the farm in search of artifacts when time allows. Moving meticulously across the countryside they scan for anything and begin to find bits and pieces though nothing major. But that comes into question with this season as the farm has been sold and the detecting is opened with their fiercest competitor trying to home in on the farm.

Worse yet is that we the viewers are shown that the pair are nearing what could be a tremendous discovery, a set of ancient coins that would not only be a major discovery but worth something as well. If it weren't for the magpies.

The series was a hit and also an award winner. Why, in a world where hit shows from other countries are revamped for American audiences, this one hasn't been adapted yet is beyond me. Fortunately with the series on disc it gives those of us here a chance to watch and enjoy the adventures of this unlucky duo.

But its not just their search that offers the charm of the show. Its their entire lives from their love lives to their home situations to their odd friends in the DMDC. They each have a charm that makes you care about each of the characters here and want to know what happens next. I found myself in the throes of binge watching once I began here, unwilling to stop because I was having such a good time watching and waiting to see what would happen next. That the series only lasts 6 episodes was disturbing as I wanted to watch more.

So take the risk and give this series a look. The performances by both leads is so low key and wonderful that you won't be able not to cheer them on with each methodical step they take on the farm. And youll root for something to happen to change their fortunes. These two everymen are a welcome addition to the world of comedic television and are worthy of your time.",1529798400,5,3834,4.457917261055635
7093364,5,B00VKX6VWC,"Not for everyone, but for me it was wonderful.  Slow, gentle, and warm -- you must listen carefully to get some of the humor.  This (so they say) is the final season.  The ending is pure gold.",1529539200,3,192,4.135135135135135
7093365,1,B00VKX6VWC,Almost bought all three seasons but decided to try just the first. SO glad as it is terrible--not funny and juvenile. Not sure how it was rated as it was by others but maybe I missed something.,1529280000,,193,4.243243243243243
7093366,5,B00VKX6VWC,Our favorite series!,1529193600,,20,6.0
7093367,5,B00VKX6VWC,"Like some, I was a little put off by the f-bomb in the very first scene of the first show, but, as another reviewer has pointed out, it's a cultural thing.  Once I got past that, I can't think of enough superlatives to describe this show.  It's gentle, whimsical British humor (or should that be humour?) at its best.  The characters are well-drawn and lovable and the story lines are perfectly set up to showcase their quirkiness.  The most surprising thing for me was that this is the brainchild of Mackenzie Crook, the annoying, slightly creepy Gareth of The Office.  He has said there won't be a fourth series, but I sure hope he continues writing other series in this same vein.  I would definitely invite him to one of my dinner parties!  Another comedic series, Corner Gas with Brent Butt, has reigned as my favorite for years, but Detectorists has tied for first place now.",1529193600,,881,4.608974358974359

7093391,5,B00VKX6VWC,"All three series are quite good, but in this one everything that has made this show very special came together.

7093393,5,B00VKX6VWC,"I really enjoyed this series from the theme song to the finale. The characters are quirky but smart. The relationship between Lance and Andy is comfortable and brotherly in an understanding and affectionate manner based primarily on mutual interests with metal detecting as the backdrop. For some reason, it reminds me of the American television series, Northern Exposure. It is very good!",1528675200,,389,5.290322580645161
7093394,4,B00VKX6VWC,"This series is a bit of a hidden gem, but season 3 stands out as especially good.

7093397,5,B00VKX6VWC,"I received it yesterday and already watched the whole season, they are only 30 minutes each and there are 6 episodes.  The only thing disappointing about this season is what I stated above, I wish the season was longer.  Same beautiful theme song same wonderful relatable characters.  If you consider yourself a Detectorist, even just a little you will probably like this show.  Like other seasons there are definitely laugh out loud bits and some emotional bits.  Frickin magpies!

Watch it, love it, repeat, I know I will be.

Edited bit: As I ponder this season I keep going back to the last scene of the last episode, although it is sad that this series is over it makes me smile.  I can't wait to watch the whole series again.",1527984000,6,731,4.569230769230769

7093430,5,B00VKX6VWC,"This series grabbed me in a way no other comedy ever has. It's not a laugh-a-minute, but there are plenty of laughs (Toby Jones is a wonderful comic actor). The two characters have faults and foibles, but they are fundamentally decent (and real), and that decency is the heart of the show. Unlike a lot of modern comedies, it's not cruel or mocking -- it's quirky and sweet. My wife and I have now watched all the series three times over, and we'll watch them again.

At the end of each series, I felt as moved as if I'd finished a great book. Can't wait to see what Mackenzie Crook writes and directs next.",1522368000,2,607,4.324561403508772

The plot: Two detectorists trudge through the fields of life searching for treasures but not in the bottom paddock.  Yes there is adult language but it's not gratuitous.  Very few scripts are written this well and consistently so.  Not an in-your-face, spoon fed, slapstick comedy but brilliant, thoughtful, deadpan and very funny.

7093457,5,B00VKX6VWC,"Watching Detectorists is like schlepping along a grassy meadow on the seasons first warm spring day after a long and a dreary winter. The sky painted powdery blue, the air filled with the earthy smell of freshly plowed field, and your friends voice breaking the silence: What you got! Even the pesky villains Art and Paul are a peachy pair, suspected of canlooding in the grass.

Two cheers for Mackenzie Crook for his wonderful writing and perceptive directing: one, for showing that unremarkable lives can be beautiful and two, that digging out ring-pulls over the ages beats finding antique gold.

Ive decided to buy a spanking new CTX-3030 metal detector like Lances.  Could the gang at the Danebury Metal Detecting Club (DMDC) please put in a good word with Terry to take on this newbie?",1519603200,2,792,4.851851851851852

Toby Jones is impeccable as always; the entire cast is marvelous.  I was delighted to see Diana Rigg and her daughter Rachael Stirling, who bears a striking resemblance to her mother.

They redeem themselves because their characters have been written and portrayed as vulnerable, intelligent and, for the most part, content with their lives.  Rich in metaphor, the treasure seems always one step ahead of them, they have a close, caring significant relationships as their lives take various twists and turns through the course of the series.

7093559,4,B00VKX6VWC,"Similar to the protagonists in our series, the viewer bringing some patience to this series will be rewarded. This is a slow-moving and quirky comedy featuring odd characters and beautiful fields and meadows.  Our heroes, Andy and Lance, by some measure might be viewed as losers by day until they pick up their detectors and head out in search of history.  It is not the finding of relics but the quest for these things that keeps our heroes going, similar to their hero Indiana Jones.  As with Jones, there is a bad guy, usually a Nazi. In this case there are two bad guys who bear a striking resemblance to Simon and Garfunkel, and compete with Lance and Andy in the quest for relics and are assisted by a femme fatale of sorts who turns out to be one of the good guys by season 2.

Meanwhile, many things arise during the course of daily life (some ups and downs), but the quest for ancient artifacts goes on (yielding mostly Matchbox cars and pull tops from soda cans from another era).  Note--Lance, Andy and their companions while a bit quirky, are portrayed as very decent people who are full of humanity.

This is not laugh out loud type stuff, but subtle comedy that will make you smile and leave you wanting more.

But.. when they get it wrong....man it really stinks. The Detectorists is not stinky in the least.. it smells like a freshly made batch of crumpets. Served with KerryGold unsalted butter, Clotted cream, fresh strawberries, Wild BlueBerry preserves and a nice hot cup of Prince of wales tea.( personal fave :) .

7093587,5,B00VKX6VWC,After seeing Mackenzie Crook in Game of Thrones I wanted to see him in something else and settled on this show. It's not really the kind of show that makes you laugh but it grows on you so much that you can't wait to see the next episode. The characters are like real life people instead of the usual sitcom characters who go for a laugh every 15 seconds. What is impressive is that Crook wrote and directed every episode himself as well as play the main character.

I love this show - Series 1 and 2 - and hope there will be a Series 3.  It is quiet with low-key humor (including sometimes it helping to recognize things like the quotes from the discovery of King Tutankhamens tomb:  Lord Carnarvon: Can you see anything?  Howard Carter:  Yes, wonderful things.)  I love Johnny Flynns song, too.  Mackenzie Crook is brilliant (and everyone involved in this show, too) and I am now a big fan of his.

Dont watch this expecting hugely dramatic scenes; its not that kind of show.  It is especially nice as a brief reprieve from the news and tv shows with lots of violence and explicit sex.  (warning to anyone who is offended by any use of curse words:  yeah, there are some, but I think appropriate and I did not find them at all offensive)  And btw for fans of The Avengers from the 1960s, Diana Rigg has a few tiny scenes in Series 2 as the mother of her real-life daughter, Rachael Stirling - Becky, Andys girlfriend.",1469923200,2,1078,4.388888888888889

It's considered a comedy, but there's plenty of drama in the characters' lives. The characters are ordinary enough to be plausible yet quirky enough to be fascinating.

I have little use for TV, but this series is worth gathering up the family in front of a screen, sitting still for a spell, and savoring. Watching each episode feels like finding a small, delicious treasure honed by wisdom and wonder. I can only liken it to my all-time American favorite, Northern Exposure, although Detectorists charms with a quieter and even more earthy aesthetic. The ""plot"" unfolds deliberately, giving us the chance to know the characters and love their idiosyncrasies. Their relationships make sense, complete with the scuffs and dings of daily living, and we're spared all of the sorry shock tactics and simpering sop that pervade most of today's entertainment. By focusing the lens on the mundane, we are able to tune out the white noise of mainstream media and rekindle the spark of being present. Crook's deft direction shares intimate pleasures like birdsong, sun-haloed dandelions, bees, dirt under fingernails, and friendship. This is the stuff life is made of. Throw in the intriguing glint of long-hidden history and a gorgeous theme song by Johnny Flynn, and ""perfection"" is a description I'm happy to toss around with abandon.",1465430400,5,1241,5.088235294117647

I think the creator of this show is really influenced by comic strips, namely Calvin & Hobbs and Peanuts. Andy is Calvin, Lance is Hobbs, and Becky is Susy Derkins (You can't deny the love Calvin and Susy had for each other) Art Garfunkel is Joe. I admire how Becky shows her love for Andy even as she mocks him for being such a geek. Just like Charlie Brown never won a baseball game, Andy and Lance will never make that big find because Detectorists is about losers and misfits like us.

7093638,5,B00VKX6VWC,"One of the best situation comedies ever.  My only complaint is that is only 6 episodes.  This, for lovers of British programming will not be unusual.  It is the often lost wisdom of less is more.
Mackenzie Crook (""Pirates of the Caribbean"", ""Game of Thrones"", ""Almost Human"") writes, stars, and plants his directorial flag upon this  true work of art. Capturing the daily goings on of two detectorists (people who comb the countryside with metal detectors in search of artifacts and sometimes treasure). However that is simply the subplot for the consistently humorous and charming lives of the wonderful charters brought to life by a stellar ensemble cast. Mackenzie Crook's costars include BAFTA and Golden Globe nominee Toby Jones, Rachel Sterling (""Snow White and the Huntsman"" and  ""The Young Victoria""), Aimee-Ffion Edwards (""Skins""(UK), ""Luther"", and ""Peaky Blinders""), and an absolutely brilliantly hilarious supporting array of actors. Not to mention the breath taking cinematography capturing the English countryside and a beautiful title track by Johnny Flynn.  Like a perfect day out from beginning to end without ever leaving your living room.
I'd also like to mention that series two has just been broadcast in the UK and it has lived up to it's predecessor.

The story feels genuine and true to the small details of life - two men escaping the boredom of their jobs with an unusual hobby.  Unlike many recent shows, music is used sparingly, and to powerful effect. Not just for constant emoting. I watched the show in a single sitting and found myself nostalgic for its world as soon as it had ended.

7093653,5,B00VKX6VWC,"This quirky British comedy come complete in six 29-minute episodes that are best watched at least two or three at a time. There are really laugh out funny moments here but there is also (just like in real life) some serious issues re-relationships.

I often write much longer reviews but I see quite a few posted already. Luckily none have given away one of the major plot twists but, honestly, I wonder the need for reviewers to list the plot summaries for each episode. I should point out that when you press play for each episode, a short summary of what will happen will appear on your TV screen just before the episode starts. Personally, I suggest that you close your eyes and ignore it. Just let the story develop. I think youll enjoy it more.

All the characters have their own quirks. I found it easy to understand the dialogue but there are English subtitles if you need them and they are easy to read.

There is a bonus featurette on the making of thats fun to watch. And  this is really not a spoiler  the series was renews for a second season. Good news. The show won the British equivalent of an Emmy and, after watching it, I can see why.

This may not be the best or funniest show youll see all year but the 3 hours spent watching it are worthwhile.

I hope this review was helpful and informative (but not too much info to destroy the fun of discovering this cleverly written show)

7093656,5,B00VKX6VWC,"I found this gem while searching for UK metal detecting videos. I live here in the states and have longed to detect in the UK. This series has such a way about it. It's funny, at times it's heartwarming and tender and feels so genuine. It's perfectly cast. I wouldn't change a character. I'm very happy this evening because it has just been released here in the states and my copy arrives tomorrow! Hopefully, my wife will sit down and watch with me. Then, just maybe she will understand why I enjoy digging up ring pulls (and the occasional civil war relic)!",1440979200,18,559,4.490196078431373

8710481,5,B00VKX6VWC,"This show always leaves me in a good mood. I've seen every episode from all 3 seasons twice. Detertorists does it all perfectly: humor, wit, warmth. It touches a variety of topics about the human dilemma. It's great television. I wish there were more series like this one.

And I must mention that beautiful theme song by Johnny Flynn. His hopeful lyrics and wistful voice just sends me into a reverie. I find myself humming it and wanting to learn the chords so I can play it for my daughter. Just Lovely.",1533340800,2,506,4.5

Loved every single episode - I'm pleased I started watching just because I wanted to know what a ""dectectorist"" was ! So worth watching. Loved it and will probably watch again .",1533340800,,302,4.826923076923077

8710484,5,B00VKX6VWC,"This is not an American-style sitcom; it is so much better.  The humor is gentle with bursts of hilarity, and the characters are endearingly human.  You come to care about these characters and miss them when the series ends.  Writer, director and star Mackenzie Crook is a genius.",1533254400,,280,4.791666666666667
