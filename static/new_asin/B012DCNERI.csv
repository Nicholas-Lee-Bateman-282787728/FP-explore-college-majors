7346989,5,B012DCNERI,Been waiting for years and now we have it. I agree with much going on during the concert but you tell Jeff is almost overwhelmed by the crowd of 55.000 and how much they are into his music and performance. I for one thought his decision to add all the backup singers and instruments was as they say...spot on!!!  Rock on Jeff!!,1441843200,3,327,4.274193548387097
7346990,5,B012DCNERI,"Wow! Great Blu-Ray! The sound is terrific, and easy on the eyes. No quick editing that ruins other concert DVDs.

The show is on Palladia his week. Not all songs are shown, and I will not hesitate to purchase the Blu-Ray.",1441670400,9,221,4.390243902439025
7346991,5,B012DCNERI,"As I post this review there is one review posted already by Richardson based on an advance working copy of the disc. I was provided with a final copy of the Bluray by Eagle Rock for an objective review so, Ill try to clarify things that commenters were asking about.

First off, I have to say Im a general fan of ELOs hit records. I may only own one (back in the first vinyl days) but, I loved hearing the hits on the radio. Honestly, I didn't know THAT much about Jeff Lynne except that he wrote the songs and produced albums for Roy Orbison, Tom Petty and others. So take that into consideration as you read on.

If you are a big ELO fan you MUST have this BD. Eagle Rock has packed so much in at a fair price and Lynne, himself, - a perfectionist  was involved in the stereo sound mix. But even if you just love good pop/rock music youll want this for the Bonus material, which  IMHO, outshines the concert footage that forms the basis for this release.

The concert was staged last September (2014) in Hyde Park in London by the BBC Radio 2 so they could broadcast it. 55,000 fans gobbled up the tickets. Original members Lynne (guitar and vocals here) and Richard Tandy (Piano and keyboards  and one short vocal harmony) are on the stage. So are a half-dozen other musicians and three backup singers and a slew of string players. The concert runs just over an hour and includes 16 songs (all the big hits). You can tell Lynne is having a ball but  at least for me  I thought there was too much going on on the stage. Still I liked it.

The first bonus is a 14-minute interview with Lynne recorded just before the concert. Half of it has him making the same comments he makes in the other bonus, which Ill cover in a minute, and in the balance of time he presents comments and history on each of the hits.
So now comes  IMHO  the best part of this package. Its the 2012 documentary Mr. Blue Sky: The Story of Jeff Lynne and ELO, which  at 80 minutes  is longer than the concert. Filmed at Lynnes home estate, where his house is, literally, his studio, Lynne is interviewed about his complete career as composer, musician and producer. At that time he was re-recording all the ELO hits and songs he produced for Orbison and Petty and the Traveling Wilburys. On this album he plays all the parts. And so we get to hear some full numbers as well. All this is mixed with really extensive interviews with Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr (about Lynnes production of the restored version of Free as a Bird ), Petty, Olivia Harrison, Joe Walsh and others.

There a great moment at about the 67-minute mark when a cleverly produced video shows Lynne performing  the song Mercy Mercy playing two different guitars, a bass and the drums  (!) all at the same time. It implies that he can do it all. And, here he does!
The BD does have a 12-page color booklet enclosed which is nearly all photos of the concert  the first time he has played a concert in 30 years!

You may buy this for the concert portion but I think youll love the documentary even more. AND, Ill suggest that casual fans watch the documentary first and then the interview bonus and, finally, the concert itself. With the background you will get on Lynnes life youll appreciate the concert more.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7346992,5,B012DCNERI,"I've seen a demonstration copy of this release and if you are a fan this IS the one you've been waiting for.  When I was given this to view I had no idea that Mr Lynne had put together such a massive show , by that I mean, this doesn't look like a ""one off"" but a well thought out show that should be and what I understand now WILL go on the road.  For the most part the set list is very satisfying.  Of course there are songs I wish they'd done and every fan will feel the same way, but that is a minor gripe.
I'm assuming my copy is the final one, but they sometime make minor changes

and Mr Lynne is shown between many songs in interview mode discussing the song and his career.

The film is great, not the short headache inducing cuts of many of these recent concert DVDs and Blu Rays. The crowd is massive and very into the show. The bands' performance is terrific and they are augmented by an orchestra which takes it to another level.  There is a large screen behind the band with cool graphics... this is just a top notch show in all regards. It was filmed Sept 14th of 2014 so the release is just about a year later and I understand a new album is finishing which will be the tip off to an American tour!

My copy also contained the documentary Mr Blue Sky, which I feel alone is worth the price of this disc... I didn't include that in my review originally out of fear it may not show up but it is confirmed that it will indeed be a bonus feature! Also, Mr Lynne himself mastered this project and the sound is wonderful!

UPDATE:  Just viewed the finished product and they made an important change... instead if inserting the interview segments between songs they've separated it into it's own section.. I think this is a brilliant decision and so now we have a tight 70 minute concert, a smart interview section and then the 80 minute documentary... all told a solid value for money and very very well done!  ONE BAD NOTE... as I worried, they lost Roll Over Beethoven which closed my demo copy... I'm sure that the publishers of Mr Berry's music just wanted more for the synch rights than they were willing to pay ... shame that.  On other ELO videos in the US they often drop that tune but in the UK it is on the video (different synch rights for different countries) it is possible the UK or EU version will have it as it WAS the finale and a real winner.. the only false note on the finished BR in the US is it's sad deletion... I'm glad to have my demo with it in!

9/24/15 UK version arrived, plays fine in my player and the true finale Roll Over Beethoven is included as are the other songs and bonus features... go to the amazon site in the UK and get this superior version... (love the piano break in ROL where he plays a bit of Rock Aria!)",1438992000,60,3023,4.1931034482758625

I WAS A FAN IMMEDIATELY AND FOLLOWED ELO THROUGH THE MID 80S. THIS FABOULOUS SHOW IS A GOOD OVERSITE OF THOSE TIMES. THE NEVER AGING JEFF LYNNE SOUNDS GREAT AND BAND AND ORCHESTRA ARE PERFECT. HOPE TO SEE THE SHOW IN CHICAGO THIS SUMMER. THE BLU RAY  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. THANKS JEFF FOR 40 PLUS YEARS OF SOME THE BEST MUSIC EVER,1516147200,,613,4.239316239316239

7347026,4,B012DCNERI,"Despite what some of the more OCD audiophiles might say, the stereo mix (which was Lynne's choice and NOT Eagle Rock's) sounds very good. In fact, everything about this show is good except for the fact that ELO was band, not just Jeff Lynne. This is more like the best ELO cover band EVER, but still a cover band. Yes, they sound quite good, and yes, Jeff's voice has held up nicely, but this isn't ELO. I'm okay with all of the above but feel that it's important info for prospective buyers. In addition, the ""feature length"" documentary included, is all about Lynne with no mention of other ELO members except for Richard Tandy. Despite what Lynne may think, the other band members contributed to ELO's sound and they deserve recognition, especially those who are no longer here to defend themselves. There's a bit of revisionist history from Lynne and that just further fuels the disputes between him and and other surviving band members. Sad.",1500076800,,946,4.739393939393939
7347027,5,B012DCNERI,"I never get tired of watching Jeff Lynne's ELO concerts because the songs are classic and timeless!  Jeff Lynne always puts on a great show and the sound quality of this concert was just as good or better than the studio albums.  I dislike it when an artist or band sound terrible in concert due to lack of effort or laziness.  ELO doesn't disappoint here. In fact, Jeff and the band sounded excellent, as well as the picture quality on this Blu-ray. Highly reccommend this Blu-ray for ELO fans.",1499126400,,495,4.53932584269663

The concert is great, the live music captures almost every nuance of the recorded music.  My only quibble is that, as hard and often as I tried, I couldn't get the subtitles to come on.  I really enjoy reading along with the lyrics because sometimes I don't catch all the words.  Anyway, I still love this concert.  Jeff Lynne rocks!",1480032000,,500,4.43956043956044

Jeff's voice must really be off key these days because at times it sounded like an ELO tribute courtesy of the Black Eyed Peas.

7347132,5,B012DCNERI,"This show, while not at all identical to the concert tour for ELO's smash hit album, ""A New World Record"", is WONDERFUL in both audio and video, and brings back fantastic memories for me! If you're an ELO fan, this 2014 show will take you delightfully back as well.
My first week in college (1976). Wow! ELO had just come out with my favorite album, ""A New World Record"" in the same week that I met my first football cheerleader, (nudge, nudge, Linda!), I also paid a scalper $13.50 for a $7.50 ELO concert ticket. Worth it and THEN some.
Much like this concert Blu-Ray! The hits are here: ""Evil Woman"", ""Can't Get It Out Of My Head"", ""Telephone Line"", ""Rock and Roll Is King"", and so many more. Buy this DVD!",1462147200,,709,4.378787878787879

7347143,4,B012DCNERI,"After finding this by sheer coincidence one night on VH1 Classic when channel surfing, I was thrilled to discover that Jeff Lynne's performance was top notch as well as the full orchestra support.  The performances are incredible as everyone appears to be very dedicated on maintaining the integrity of the original music.  I especially liked that 'All Over The World' was included as it was only played on the radio at the time the movie ""Xanadu"" was released (horrible movie in my opinion) in the early 80's.

As many others have said, the sound on this DVD (I purchased the non Blu-Ray version) could be a bit better quality.  While I do not necessarily need surround 5.1 sound, even the normal 'stereo' is a bit muffled.  I guess that is what the bass and treble knobs or other settings are used for!

But finding an ELO 'greatest hits' collection on DVD performed all these years later is a win/win in my opinion.",1458864000,,918,4.635802469135802

7347146,5,B012DCNERI,I wish this was actually blue ray as the picture is terrible not nearly as clear as the music. It appears you can only get the Blue-Ray from Amazon UK and the price is outrageous not to mention they only take specific CC's. So I just checked and they now have a Blue-Ray version for the same price here. I am going to buy it and sell this one since it is past the return date another burn here by not staying right on top of itcause if you are on top of it Amazon will refund most purchases.,1457827200,,491,3.9696969696969697

7347164,5,B012DCNERI,"A very strong comeback concert for Jeff, who should be touring more often and sharing his great music with the fans.  Jeff's voice sounds a bit tentative on the first song, ""All Over the World"" (he was probably very nervous), but after that comes back as strong as ever.  Jeff's back-up band sounds amazing, but it is not ELO, even if Jeff likes to call it like that.  Jeff IS ELO, no question about it.  The included documentary ""Mr. Blue Sky"" is a great testament to Jeff Lynne's creative powers and at the same time, humble persona.

If you enjoyed ELO during the 70's and 80's, you will no doubt enjoy this one - buy it and watch it while we wait for Jeff Lynne's world tour!!",1456099200,,680,4.322834645669292

Jeff Lynne doesn't have the USA on his tour so this provides a great view and listening treat. It is so cool that this group still has sold out shows at this stage in their life. Incredible musicians and singers. What a treat this DVD is for me.

The Mr. Blue Sky: The Story of Jeff Lynne and the ELO has some fantastic people on it. Gotta buy this DVD just for that alone. Jeff Lynne has great respect from a lot of artists fabulous in their own right. Buy it.",1456012800,,552,4.257142857142857

7347180,5,B012DCNERI,I have always loved ELO. This concert is awesome. After watching this I have bought many more of Jeff Lynne's CD's.,1454112000,,115,4.523809523809524
7347181,4,B012DCNERI,"Just to be able to see 2 members of the orginal 1972 E.L.O. live, performing a good chunk of their many hits, would be worth 5 stars. Overall a good concert, especially with the BBC orchestra (well at least the strings) there for most songs. But I have to assume that the concert was part of a larger festival, as it is very short (70 minutes). I could list at least 10 more songs they could have played. But overall a very solid performance and you see the guys had a blast playing those songs.",1454112000,,495,4.221052631578948

7347183,5,B012DCNERI,I have been a fan The Electric Light Orchestra for thirty years. This is a fantastic disc!! The video and audio are outstanding!  The concert is one of the best I've seen. Jeff Lynne's voice is still remarkable and the new members of the band are great as well. This was well worth the money!,1453593600,,292,4.3090909090909095
7347184,5,B012DCNERI,"Most concert films are kind of lame in my opinion but this was different because the fans in Hyde Park were so excited to see Jeff Lynne making what he thought was a one time appearance. This show seems to have relaunched Jeff's career. As a huge fan of ELO from the earliest days, I loved every bit of this concert. I saw ELO at a local college in 1974 before they made it big in the states and I always loved their music.",1453593600,,423,4.0476190476190474

7347189,5,B012DCNERI,Can't beat Jeff Lynne. Sounds more like Traveling Wilburys than ELO but I love both of them. Buy it and enjoy it. I really hope if he makes a USA tour I can get tickets for myself and son. This genius has crossed generations.,1453334400,,225,4.136363636363637

7347191,5,B012DCNERI,The bonus documentary Mr. Blue Sky is worth the price of admission alone.  I could have watched it all day.  Great inside look to the life of a musical genius.  I can't say enough good things about this DVD.  If I lost it I'd buy it again for twice the price. I highly recommend this video for the ELO lover or songwriter in your family.,1452643200,,337,4.138461538461539
7347192,5,B012DCNERI,"Great to hear Jeff Lynne again playing all the hits! I really enjoyed this concert and highly recommend it.

7347196,5,B012DCNERI,"Great concert. Jeff Lynne assembled a group of rock musicians and singers and the BBC Orchestra and his old pal Richard Tandy and performed for a couple of hours at an outdoor concert in London's Hyde Park. From what I understand, they were not even considered the headliner of the show but man oh man did they nail it! All of the musicians and singers sounded great and Jeff Lynne's voice is still really strong and actually got stronger as the concert progressed. You could tell that they were all having a really good time performing and the audience, both old and young, both straight and probably somewhat high,  seemed to really love the show. Great sound and video on the DVD.",1451865600,,683,4.598360655737705

7347198,4,B012DCNERI,"I got this as a Christmas present and am enjoying it quite a bit. The song selection is great. The visuals are very good. The sound is a little muffled... Not great, but it's ELO live! Ok, it's Jeff Lynne, but I'm in the crowd that always felt Jeff Lynne IS ELO. The documentary included (Mr Blue Sky) confirms that and is very interesting. I think the sound from the Zoom Live Dvd is better, but I like the song selection better here. I hope he does a full on tour for the great new album Alone In The Universe!",1451347200,,512,4.13
7347199,5,B012DCNERI,This is the ELO concert I always wanted to see. The documentary was very good as well.,1451347200,,86,4.117647058823529
7347200,5,B012DCNERI,"OK, let's write this while the hairs are still standing up on the neck, shall we?  BUY THIS.  It's the finest performance by Jeff Lynne and what remains of the original ELO (okay, only Richard Tandy). The new musicians and accompanying arrangements of the songs are STELLAR. I read all the reviews here about this edition missing the ending with ""Roll Over Beethoven,"" etc etc.  I have two messages here - to the people complaining about it not being on the US edition and it's a rip off because the UK edition has it - GET OVER IT!  You are pissing all over a monumental achievement in this Blue Ray and poisoning a potential wonderful evening for ELO fans all over the world. My second message is to the ELO fans on the fence about buying this, get off the fence. This is a performance not to be missed. Jeff Lynne and the band sound incredible - a certain, traitorous drummer is not missed in the least. Get this and play it over and over again.  You're welcome!",1450828800,3,965,4.398876404494382

7347203,5,B012DCNERI,The best concert I have ever seen on film.  Jeffrey Lynne is the most under rated musician of our time in my opinion.  The fact that he is not in the R&R Hall of Fame is a crime (especially when you look at some of the names that made it).,1450483200,2,239,3.76

You've got to be kidding! I've bought DVDs from unknown artists playing in tiny venues that were in surround with better audio. I can't understand why after going to all the trouble to do this fabulous expensive concert and Blu-Ray disc that they wouldn't do it in surround. If they couldn't do it in Dolby True HD, I'd even settle for Dolby Digital. But nooooooooo! It has to be in 2 channel. This is unacceptable! I'm really disappointed and hope somebody will correct this with a future release. In the meantime, if you care about good audio, I'd pass.",1449964800,3,722,4.604651162790698

The concert is very good. The performances are great, the sound recording is well done and the video looks very good.

The sound quality, the editing, the actual direction of the cameras in concert, and above all the amazing performance of Jeff Lynne and his incredible ""ELO"" is well worth the cost of this fabulous Blu-Ray disc.
If you are a fan of ELO and concerts on disc then this is one that you have to have, as its awesome.
Not one ""filler"" song, not any needless chatter from the stage during the concert.....its just song after great ELO song, after song...Hit after Hit......>
Get it on Blu-Ray and turn up your home stereo system or listen on headphones and  you'll simply be amazed at how good this concert is, from start to finish.

7347231,4,B012DCNERI,Jeff Lynne and Richard Tandy sound amazing as they and the new Electric Light Orchestra line up belt out some of ELO's best known classics.  I'm at awe at how great these old fogies sound. My only complaint is that the full concert is not included (maybe they didn't want to pay the royalties to Chuck Berry for Roll Over Beethoven?) and there's no 5.1 audio option.,1447891200,,366,4.462686567164179

7347234,5,B012DCNERI,"This is a MUST for any Jeff Lynn fan... the documentary is great bonus, and you definitely understand Jeff's artistic process (basically a constant daily immersion) and level of genius. This alone is worth it - great interviews with the Paul, George, Ringo, Tom Petty, etc. The concert is fantastic, with practically a full orchestra - what really impressed me is the performance is very precise and accurate to the original recordings, with no additional or modernized elements... just very faithful reproductions, that very ""classic"" Jeff Lynn sound. You can see the layers of the songs very clearly, and just how much instrumentation these songs had. IMO, Jeff's up there with Brian Wilson, Beatles, etc., so to finally get a glimpse into how he works, and be reminded of the timeless power of these arrangements - just get it. The only thing that would made this better would have been a proper 5.1 mix, but I read somewhere Jeff wanted it in stereo, so there we are. It looks and sounds terrific. Pay the man.",1447632000,9,1014,4.8

7347241,5,B012DCNERI,This is a great Blu-ray. I love ELO! Hopefully this will become a full-blown tour. Jeff Lynn is a master musician.

7347277,5,B012DCNERI,"This review is for the UK version since, as others have pointed out, the US version leaves out Roll Over Beethoven. That small fact is treasonous for any diehard fan. Nevertheless, this Blue-ray belongs in your collection no matter whether you purchase the US or UK version (I did purchase the UK version through Amazon UK).

The Hyde Park concert in itself is quintessential ELO. Nevermind only the mastermind himself, Jeff Lynne, and Richard Tandy are the sole original members on stage. The performances are near flawless, every nuance, lush with strings, rich with harmonies and backing vocals, true to the originals in every way. It's a step back in time and yet thoroughly modern. Own this disc for these reasons alone.

Of course, we get some amazing bonuses. I'll start with the less impressive of the two. Hard to believe that's how I refer to an interview with Jeff Lynne, but it's like saying I have a Lamborghini and a Porsche, so I'll talk about the Porsche first. In the interview, Jeff recalls his inspiration behind many of our classic favorites, talks about his distaste for touring and other personal memories. I was impressed by how lucid these memories were, not because these things happened a long time ago, but because I've seen past interviews where he doesn't seem to recall much of anything. I have a feeling that, over the past few years, he has taken the time to revisit the old days and many of the old details are coming back to him.

The second bonus, and in my opinion, as good a reason as any to own this disc regardless of what else is on it (including the concert) is the feature length documentary, Mr Blue Sky - The Story Of Jeff Lynne and ELO. Here we enjoy photos and recollections at every stage of his career. Nightrider, The Idle Race, The Move, ELO, The Traveling Wilburys. We are immersed in the experience of working with Lynne as a producer, thanks to candid interviews with legends including Paul McCartney, Tom Petty and Joe Walsh among others. Hearing them place Jeff Lynne on a high pedestal -- juxtaposed with Lynne's own unabashed hero worship of the people he produced for -- is magical. It is the fans' validation that we know something most of the world doesn't. Jeff Lynne is both an incomparable artist and record producer. I'll give you one brilliant moment out of a hundred others: Tom Petty saying when the Beatles got back together, they asked Jeff Lynne to produce the album. When you're the Beatles, you can get anyone to be your producer. They chose Jeff Lynne -- what does that tell you?

We must thank the visionaries at the BBC who chose to pay serious, even fanatical attention to our rock idol. The sold-out concert. The incomparable interviews. The tour of Bungalow Palace -- Lynne's home and recording studio. Seeing Jeff and Richard plunk out some of the old tunes together. This collection was made for us. It pays genuine tribute to Lynne's legacy like nothing else before it. His contribution to the fabric of rock and roll is now part of the permanent record. That you can have the Blue-ray for the cost of a casual dinner is an unfathomable gift for fans.",1444348800,,3132,4.668478260869565

Amazing that after so many years watching and listening to these songs, this is actually better than when the original songs were released. Just a fantastic concert. Mr. Lynn has lost nothing in musicianship, vocal ability, or showmanship. All the while being humble as hell. Truly one of the greatest songwriters, composers, musicians of our time. Jeff Lynn and Electric Light Orchestra. Richard Tandy is beside him at the piano. The band and orchestral players are simply wonderful as well. This is a must have.

7347286,3,B012DCNERI,"Just watched recently released Blu Ray
  The performance was nice...especially with the BBC orchestra in the background. The performance seemed a bit short by 3 or 4 songs.
**Picture Quality 3.5 out of 5. Blu-Ray def picture seemed overall solid in detail throughout with a bit oversaturation in the color.
  Most objectionable was the camera jitter in the rail-mounted camera shots up front. I saw no effort to isolate the bass drum vibration - causing the CCD to vibrate with every bass drum strike. The brightness of the image suffered as badly with every bass drum strike. I can't believe this got by Quality Control!
**Sound quality 3.0 out of 5. (most definitely average and a little disappointing for such a recently recorded performance).. LCPM only codec that was quite average with typical muddiness. Had to down-shift to a lossy decoder to get decent sound on my amp. Simple Multi-Channel Stereo or 2-channel stereo seemed the only settings that could reproduce the Audio in any respectable way. Again...disappointing for what should have been a legacy performance for ELO. Keep in mind, though...this will probably be their best technical effort on video. Don't wait for another.",1443225600,,1191,5.092307692307692
7347287,4,B012DCNERI,"This is clearly a historic concert and Blu-ray, with superb production that captures the music of a generation, an homage to the Beatles in so many ways, as well as an inspiration to bands that followed like Queen and the Traveling Wilburys.

However, for those of us that value the highest resolution, its in 1080i instead of 1080p and lacks a multi-channel option, its stereo only.  It would have been better to leave that option up to the consumer, some will like the stereo version but for those of us with big investments in our audio systems, the lack of surround sound is a mistake that should be corrected before too many are sold this way.

Having said that, its still better than nothing at all. If these decisions are Jeff's, who are we to argue, its his art, he gets to choose.  In the booklet he proclaims proudly that its in stereo only, this was obviously his choice.",1443225600,6,882,4.528301886792453
7347288,5,B012DCNERI,"Play it in stereo surround please.
This is an astonishing effort and beautiful spectacle from one of the only musisican/producers and most prolific musical talents of our time. Jeff's talent for mastering sound is as  special as it gets. He's arranged a band behind him with typical producer precision and with the BBC orchestra, starts into a show that from start to finish is as fresh and note for note spot on as the original recordings from over 35 years ago. It's truly wild to hear him at 70 years old standing there in his beard and glasses just nailin' it with a voice that has not changed one bit. There is nobody left who can do what Jeff Lynne did at Hyde Park in September 2014. 30 years since his last festival show,he shows up and does this...All I can say is WOW dude.

7347290,3,B012DCNERI,"While getting to see an ELO concert is a joy, I do have some issues.

VIDEO: There's some pulsating in various camera shots that may be due to sonic vibrations, which on a bigger screen can be occasionally annoying.

AUDIO: Amazingly, in this day and age....no immersive 5.1? That being said, the much bigger issue is with the audio mix itself. The highs have been squashed. It's like everything has been crushed down into one big mushy/muffled mix. Vocals and just about everything else sound like they are coming through a pillowcase. Dynamics and separation are shot to hell. A review from a Movie/Blu-ray site basically noted the same thing.

PACKAGE: Missing ""Roll Over Beethoven"" for Non-UK people.

Considering ELO's extensive hit list, I would have liked to see more.....in particular...the other hit from the ""Discovery"" album called ""Shine A Little Love. But all things being said, it's not bad.....I just expected the audio to really, really shine and be more dynamic like the ""Eagles Farewell I Tour Blu-ray"". I mean, this is ELO and the audio should be absolutely mind-blowing and it's a disappointment. Still, an enjoyable concert......",1442793600,4,1150,5.068783068783069

2. The full concert is not included -- ""Roll Over Beethoven"" is not here. There's really no excuse for this on a Blu-Ray disc.

In the liner notes, Jeff Lynne states, "" It's important to me that the viewers experience the Hyde Park show exactly as it was performed on the night.....in stereo"".  A shame really, cause 5.1 surround would have been spectacular! That's why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. But that aside, it's a great concert.

Taking it for granted it was mixed in 5.1 surround sound I was shocked to discover the audio is stereo only.  I'm a big Jeff Lynne fan, saw the show live when it was streamed last year, and have always wanted a copy of the documentary.  To have both on one disc is a bargain well worthy of 5 stars.  But I am so disappointed in the audio I have to knock off at least one star.  Stereo was great in the 70's.  In 2015 I expected more.

7347300,2,B012DCNERI,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news. The concert itself was magical. And the UK edition shows precisely that. The US and Canadian editions, though, all come with a glitch, where Roll Over Beethoven (the final song) was cut off. Expect many returns. Eagle Rock has made similar mistakes in the past with other titles, such as Paul McCartney & Wings' Rockshow, and the Rolling Stones' Ladies & Gentlemen. Note this problem is NOT present in the UK edition of this concert, where the show comes in full.

I returned mine to Amazon and was refunded, but buyer beware, and do not get this title until they fix it. Alternatively, get it from Amazon UK, which is confirmed to be in pristine quality.

EDIT (2015/09/22): I received the Blu-ray from Amazon UK, and it is Region Free, fully compatible with US systems. More importantly, Roll Over Beethoven truly adds an entire climax to the proceedings, which is sadly absent from the non-UK edition. Amazon has finally fixed the description, omitting Roll Over Beethoven from the tracklist in the last few hours. Eagle determined it was cheaper to let Amazon deal with the costly returns than to pay the rights to allow Roll Over Beethoven to be included in this release outside of Europe. Simply a sad occurrence.",1442016000,245,1256,4.730593607305936

Sure, I would like it in 5'1 surround but I didn't have complaints about the sound that I received from this disc.
