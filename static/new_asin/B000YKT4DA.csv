3031524,2,B000YKT4DA,I decided to watch it because previews reviews mentioned that it is similar to My Big Fat Greek Wedding...nope not at all. Maybe I was disappointed because I was expecting better...Boring...,1376352000,,190,5.161290322580645
3031525,4,B000YKT4DA,This is a great movie to show after reading Romeo and Juliet. It looks at the story in a modern setting -- Brazil & soccer. Unfortunately it has not been dubbed into English.,1370908800,,174,4.303030303030303
3031526,5,B000YKT4DA,"It Is the real escence of the football. Fanatics life mixed with a real love that overcome differences. If you want to have a relax after a hard day, watch the movie.",1359676800,,166,4.21875
3031527,5,B000YKT4DA,"A romantic comedy from Brazil that is about a man who has to pretend he is a fan of his rival soccer team to win over a woman's family. Great movie with some hilarious parts. Even if you don't understand Portuguese, sometimes you forget you're reading subtitles. It's that good. I wish there were more Brazilian/Portuguese movies like this available in the US.",1289347200,,360,4.73015873015873
3031528,5,B000YKT4DA,"I'm not a fan of all comedies, but this is one of the best I've seen. A very clever and liberal take on the almost always repetitive theme of Romeo and Juliet. It has laughs, drama and intelligence. Plus, great characters. If you learn a little about Brazilian football fever and passion, you'll understand it and be pleased even more.",1242864000,,335,4.6
3031529,5,B000YKT4DA,"I think Gary Dretzka of Movie City News (moviecitynews.com) said it best.  ""Studio types rarely seek my opinions on anything, unless it involves finding the men's room after a screening. Having just finished watched this thoroughly charming Brazilian import, however, I know one thing for certain: someone who makes a lot of money, somewhere, blew it. With a bit of help from the marketing gods, Bruno Barreto's charming adaptation of the Bard's most accessible tragedy might have captured a healthy slice of the same audiences that embraced Bend It Like Beckham, Shakespeare in Love and My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Romeo and Juliet Get Married is just that irresistible. Here, the feuding families are rabid fans of rival teams in Brazil's club-soccer league. Juliet's father is a lawyer and chairman of Sao Paolo's real-life Palmeiras, and he named his daughter after two of the team's legendary players. A fine player, herself, the lanky brunette falls for the chief cheerleader of Palmeiras' arch-rivals, Corinthians. Despite not being able to maintain an erection in the vicinity of the Palmeiras banner in Juliet's bedroom, Romeo's infatuation demands that he convince her father he is a diehard fan. In his stubborn chauvinism and loud devotion to his team, Romeo's future father-in-law recalls restaurateur Gus Portokalos in Nia Vardalos' sleeper hit, My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Anyone who's read the Shakespeare tragedy even once could guess what happens next, minus the swordplay and vials of poison. (Juliet's dad and Romeo's grandmother do shed some tears, however.) Like so many other Brazilian comedies - Barreto also gave us Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands - Romeo and Juliet Get Married is sly, sexy and broad enough to appeal to those with only a passing interest in soccer. There's commentary, brief interviews, a music video and a making-of featurette.""",1203033600,2,1868,5.185430463576159
3031530,5,B000YKT4DA,"I really enjoyed this film.  It is directed by the renowned filmmaker, Bruno Barreto, who is best known for his classic ""Dona Flor And Her Two Husbands,"" as well as ""Four Days In September.""  R&J is much closer to the farcical tone of Dona Flor.  Using crazed sports loyalties as the source of conflict between the two rival families is a brilliant touch. Doing so keeps things light and fast paced with many laugh out loud moments. The acting is incredible, with Luana Piovani, as Juliet, the real knock out.  I recommend this film to anyone who wants to laugh at the foibles of love and the absurdity of sports obsessions.",1200009600,3,624,4.594594594594595
