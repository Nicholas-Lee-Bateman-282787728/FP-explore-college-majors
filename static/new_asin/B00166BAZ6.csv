8261045,4,B00166BAZ6,"This is a fun animation to watch.  It's from France in 1984 by the Hungarian director Jean Image.  I found it to be a thoroughly enjoyable movie combining Sci-fi (Trip to the Moon) and Fantasy (Baron von Munchausen).  If your expecting to see Disney, don't bother.  If you want something that is fun and imaginative for the whole family, this is it.",1346112000,,349,4.580645161290323
8261046,4,B00166BAZ6,"This is a hard to find animated film called Le secret des slnites (1983); aka The Secret of the Selenites (International: English title); aka Moon Madness (USA) by the Hungarian animator Jean Image (1910-1989).
The storyline is that astronomer Sirius sends the famous Baron Munchausen and his commerades up to the moon to discover the secret world of the Selenites, and they discover a bizarre, beautiful and dangerous world, and the Slelenites are being threatened by a mysterious race, and a comical battle ensues.
Very unique! Slight twist in storyline at the end. Offbeat and strange! Meant for children but will please adults who like the offbeat animated cinema.",1251676800,4,668,5.137614678899083
