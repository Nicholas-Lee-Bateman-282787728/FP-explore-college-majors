What's next?For me, I wanted more and more info because the more you know, the more beautiful and complicated things become. How do I choose my food? How about what color would be better to wear? Are my energies stuck somewhere? How can I change my mood quickly? How about the others- how they could be helped, fast and simple?
That's why I got this 5 day Basic Training. Well, I got it w/ $195 from another website, but even 295 it's not bad, compared to the cost of travel there, away from the family etc.

If you watched the 6-hour DVD first, there will be some repetition. But also LOTS of more info, so much so that I started to take notes, because there was no way I was going to just remember everything.

Wow- Tibetan eye chart to improve eyesight- I never knew about it. And some vowel exercises based on Rudolf Steiner's teaching. Also techniques for ADD (attention deficit discorder), fibromyalgia,osteoporosis,prostate disorders,improving memory etc. It's overwhelming. I should probably plan to watch it for the 3rd time...",1252368000,63,1121,4.743589743589744
