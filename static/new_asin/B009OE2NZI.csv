5358197,4,B009OE2NZI,"Season 1 was perfect!  Hopefully Season 3 is on the way.

For a perfectionist like me, however, Season 2 has some problems.
1) They are NOT in broadcast order (I haven't found a listing for order of production so maybe that's the problem).
2) The episodes listed on the box and the menu do not always match the episode that plays. (Although all episodes seem to be present)
3) Some of the titles are wrong...ex. while dead men DON'T pay taxes, the episode's title is ""Dead Men Don't Pay Debts"" which is, in fact one of Bat's quotes early in the show.
As I said, all episodes (so far) seem to be present AND they are crystal clear and apparently complete, so for viewing purposes the set is excellent!!",1361664000,3,701,4.426356589147287

5358226,5,B009OE2NZI,"I was in love with Bat Masterson as a small child when it first aired in 1958.  Today, I still find it thoroughly enjoyable.  The quality is so crisp I think it's probably better than when I saw it originally.  Filmed in the black and white of the day, this show has Bat Masterson of the Old West (a real person, who actually lived in the West during the late 1800's and died in NYC in 1921) as a charming hero of many different segments:  as a scout, a cattle driver, a buffalo hunter, a gambler, a law enforcer, and a ladies' man.  The killing is minimal for an old western, with Bat usually subduing ""bad guys"" by either using his cane (hence, 'Bat') or shooting the weapon out of his enemies' hands.  Often he solves problems using cunning rather than weapons.  Gene Barry does such an excellent job of portraying this old Western hero that it's nearly impossible to picture Bat any other way. This second season is very entertaining.",1406592000,,938,4.450292397660819

5358228,5,B009OE2NZI,After getting season 1 I waited until 2 and 3 were available. I liked 1 so much I knew I couldn't go wrong by getting the 2nd. volume I know that you won't be disappointed either.,1396656000,,179,4.0
5358229,5,B009OE2NZI,Great fun to watch and are fine for most all ages. We watch them in our travel trailer. We like to watch them at home as well.,1393977600,,126,3.7037037037037037
5358230,5,B009OE2NZI,I bought the 1st season awhile back and liked it so I bought the 2nd and so far  (about 1/3 way through)  its good too.  Good stories and good acting by Gene Barry.,1391299200,,164,3.909090909090909
5358231,5,B009OE2NZI,Love this series. Hard to compare this to other westerns of that era era because the are all in a class by themselves.,1383264000,,118,4.173913043478261

5358236,4,B009OE2NZI,"Again, as in season one the stories were quite well acted and produced.  Also as in season one i beleive that theatrical license was used in the production and the historical content was minimal.  Again, this was fun to watch.",1371772800,,226,4.625
5358237,5,B009OE2NZI,"I really enjoy this television series.  Gene Barry is great as a tough, but dandified, Western hero with a good sense of humor and a strong sense of justice.  The many notable guest stars are fun to see and the stories are solid and quite entertaining.  The picture and sound quality are also worthy, especially considering this is television from half-a-century ago!  Bat Masterson is a fine series for adults and children, and at $12 a season, it's a steal.",1369699200,5,459,4.7
5358238,5,B009OE2NZI,"Watching the old actors who could actually do the job is always a pleasure, and Gene Barry is a pleasure. Even though there are no special features to speak of or closed captioning, this still stomps any of the slop on TV today into the dirt.",1367452800,,242,4.282608695652174

5358241,5,B009OE2NZI,"This is the kind of box set you would expect to pay $34.95 retail and instead pay half the price. What a bargain! I noticed they are featured in production order but considering most of ZIV-TV's programs were syndicated, there are no official broadcast dates for episodes, just episode numbers. The picture quality is superb and having already watched every episode as it aired on the Westerns Channel a few years ago, these are truly uncut and unedited by comparison. Grab both seasons and hopefully the third and final season will be released on DVD this year!",1363910400,8,562,4.804123711340206
5358242,5,B009OE2NZI,"As for myself, I am a Very BIG Fan of these old Western Television Show, and like so many other Old Western Television Shows, this is just one { 1 } of Several Old Westerns that I really like and enjoy watching over and over again.  I also love the Theme to this show Bat Masterson; I have the first { 1st } two { 2 } Seasons of this show, and I'm looking forward to the remaining Season's to come out on to DVD.  In the show, Bat Masterson believes and stands for Law And Order, and he will do what ever he has to, just to keep the Peace in the Area to where he is @ that Particular Time.  I have found that in Many Case's, in a round and about way, he's something like Richard Dean Anderson { MacGyver }; with the exception that in some case's, Bat Masterson has to @ times go using his Gun, but in what I have found to the best of my recollection, Bat Masterson uses his Cane or what ever he can find to help him out of a jam, to the very best of my recollection that is.  Anywho, I Highly Recommend this Series to anyone that really likes the Old Westerns from Many Many Moons Ago.",1363651200,,1085,3.9406392694063928

5358244,5,B009OE2NZI,"This is a nice quality product.  It is well produced and professionally packaged.
