3958925,5,B002N8AQDS,"I first became a fan of Rhett and Link via the web. I loved their music and humor, so I ordered the movie. I was suprised. It is warm, witty - and deals with some powerful social issues. I really loved the intimacy captured in the interviews, and the sencerity of effection they have for those they come in contact with. You really see not only Rhett and Link's search for Ms. Locklear - their 1st grade teacher, but the unfolding of the cultural issues of a nation of people. A people that Ms. Locklear belongs to - so she is no longer just a teacher, but someone with influence and power to effect the lives of those around her. What starts as a search for a childhood teacher, becomes finding what influneces all of us, and helps us make the moral desicions of our lives, and for our nation.",1255478400,6,794,4.3
3958926,5,B002N8AQDS,"As a fan of Rhett & Link's online work, I was excited to see what they would do with a feature-length documentary.  I must admit that part of me was a little apprehensive, I mean, these two gentlemen can certainly ""internetain"" me in 3 minute YouTube videos, but could they pull off that same energy and hold my attention for 57 minutes?

Well, I watched it, and the answer to my previous query is ""yes, YES!  They certainly can!""  Although the movie is not technically perfect, it adds to the charm of the entire adventure.  (And it certainly doesn't hurt that they describe what technical difficulties they had in filming.)  In fact, it helps draw the viewer into the journey.  And what a journey it was!  Link and Rhett chose to not make use of ""modern technology"" in searching for their first grade teacher, which was an interesting choice for two guys who make their living entertaining people via the internet.  They opted to look for Ms. Locklear through talking to people, and it made for an interesting ride.

It seemed appropriate that the person-to-person method of ""Looking for Ms. Locklear"" led them into the folds of the Lumbee Indian culture.  It lent a certain depth to the documentary that stunned me.  I commend Rhett & Link for letting their search lead them, and I felt like they took me along every step of the way.  To sum it all up without giving too much away: I laughed, I cried, and then I watched it again.",1255046400,15,1433,4.55078125
3958927,5,B002N8AQDS,"I live in a small town called Napier in New Zealand,  and I am about as far from North Carolina as you can possibly get.  (its just a convenient 25 hr flight!)

Rhett and Link have been able to capture something that everyone, no matter where they live can relate to in some way.

A thoroughly enjoyable film beginning to end.",1254787200,21,326,4.295081967213115
3958928,5,B002N8AQDS,"As a fan of Rhett&Link, I know they became best friends when their first grade teacher, Ms. Locklear held them in from recess for writing profanity on their desks (they wrote ""beep,"" and ""blank."") I know their punishment was coloring unicorns, over which they bonded for life. I know they grew up to become international internetainment superforces with broad appeal across all demographics. I know they never defaced public property again. Based on that knowledge, I ordered my copy of ""Looking for Ms. Locklear"" expecting to find out a few more facts about their elementary school days and their life-long friendship. I did NOT expect to learn about the plight of North Carolina's Lumbee indians and their ongoing effort to gain federal recognition as an American Indian tribe. Now, I know the Lumbee are the largest unrecognized tribe in the USA. Now I know that the name ""Locklear,"" is revered and respected in the Lumbee bloodline (making me wonder if Heather is from North Carolina). Now I know that the Lumbee have a rich culture, a number of memorable characters among them, a great deal of pride in who they are, and a good helping of frustration and disappointment in their country's government for this lack of recognition. I know that puppies are easier to give away in Lumbee country than my own gentrified neighborhood. I know that men don't like to compete in ""pagents,"" but will participate in ""contests."" And, I know that Rhett & Link have hearts of gold for telling the story of the Lumbee when they could have just kept their focus on their goal to find their teacher. I thought I was just feeding my fan habit when I popped this DVD into my home theater for the first time. I didn't know I was going to discover a people and a cause worth supporting. Rhett & Link have a keen eye for good storytelling, good film making, and compelling character portraiture. You don't have to be a Rhett & Link fan to enjoy this film. You don't even have to be a documentary fan! It's just a lovely little hour of discovery. These fellas have proven many times over that they can make a 2-4 minute music video worth sharing with everyone you know. Now, they've demonstrated that they can capture and hold our rapt attention with a feature length film. I hope they do it again.",1253750400,10,2280,4.6600496277915635
3958929,5,B002N8AQDS,"Filmmakers Rhett and Link take a simple search for their first grade teacher and create a heartwarming documentary where the people that they meet along their journey become as interesting as the journey itself. The film is intelligent and thought-provoking as the search for Ms. Locklear leads them to an awareness of the plight of the Lumbee Indians, a people looking for recognition from the government. Their journey takes them all across North Carolina and to Washington, DC as they follow the leads they are given about their long-lost teacher.

Throughout the hour-long film, I experienced a range of emotions, because instead of focusing on their journey, the filmmakers graciously allow those they encounter a chance to tell their own stories. They beautifully capture the humor amidst sadness that is a part of daily life. There are several laugh out loud moments throughout the film (like a male ""pageant""), but those are coupled with the frustration and desperation of hitting several road blocks in their own search.

Clearly, those who know Rhett and Link as a comedy duo may be surprised by their depth and insight. The poignancy of this documentary itself is universal in its appeal, and the climax of the movie had me teary. This is a feel-good film that can be enjoyed by anyone who's ever entertained a curiosity about the fate of their favorite teacher, or maybe just anyone who enjoys a good story.",1253750400,20,1419,4.957983193277311
3958930,5,B002N8AQDS,"This movie is fantastic. I am a huge fan of Rhett and Link, but even if I weren't, I would still love this movie. Rhett and Link have created a wonderful piece of work. I laughed, I cried, I sat on the edge of my seat. If you want to watch a heartwarming story, watch this one.",1253577600,7,277,3.8771929824561404
3958971,5,B002N8AQDS,My daughter loves Rhett and Link's internet show Good Mythical Morning so when she took her first documentary filmmaking class we bought this movie to get inspiration. It is a beautiful story of these two friends trying to find their grade school teacher without using the internet. The two friends and filmmakers tell the story of how they became best friends on detention in Ms. Locklear's class and they go back as adults to find her the old school way by talking to people who might know where she is now. They have so many adventures and talk with so many interesting people it is really a great Hero's Journey film.,1476748800,,621,4.603603603603603
3958972,5,B002N8AQDS,"Wonderful film, I cry every time at the end. I have been a Rhett & Link/ Good mythical Morning fan for many years and watching this movie after the fact has been great. It gives you a lot of insight to the things they discussed on their podcasts and episodes of GMM. If your a true mythical beast its a great buy.",1471132800,,313,4.064516129032258

3958974,5,B002N8AQDS,"I am a Rhett and Link fan, so when I found out they had a documentary, I had to see it! Not many people have hard copies of movies nowadays, including myself, but this gave me a chance to purchase and support two of my favorite internetainers. The documentary itself seems low-budget, so do not expect HD video/audio. The story is quite touching and fun to watch; they meet some interesting people along the way. If you want to see Rhett and Link making an adventurous documentary, you came to the right place. I would recommend to anyone!",1447286400,,539,4.510204081632653

I definitely want to watch again and share with my family and friends so they can also follow Rhett and Link going back to look for that missing link (oops, no pun intended!) from their childhood who had unknowingly sparked the beginnings of their lifelong friendship and had left such an indelible mark on them.  Getting to meet REAL people along the way and to learn each of their stories just enhances the adventure.",1430438400,2,442,4.7272727272727275

3959001,5,B002N8AQDS,"I was first introduced to Link Neal and Rhett McLaughlin via their amusing and occasionally informative Internet production ""Good Mythical Morning."" As a confirmed Mythical Beast, I have grown fond of their quirky collective sense of humor, and greatly admire their shared vision to work together as partners for life. What many don't know is how the partnership started. They were required to stay indoors during recess together on their first day of first grade as punishment for writing profanities on their desks. Their teacher was Ms. Locklear. They always credited her with starting their partnership and two decades later they set off to find her to thank her for her impact on their lives.

They elected to forgo modern data gathering methods and find her via old-fashioned face-to-face investigation, and document the results is what turned out to be this film. It is a wonderful documentary and speaks to the power of positive influence especially in the lives of children. The characters they come across are legion, and the twists and turns are epic for what seems such a mundane undertaking. This documentary is funny, uplifting, and more entertaining than you would ever expect. I recommend it highly.",1421107200,4,1215,5.105527638190955
3959002,5,B002N8AQDS,"I thought this movie was very well done.  Rhett and Link did an excellent job of respecting the people they met and never turning to the far too common trope of condescension to get laughs.  This was a very sweet and feel good movie that was worth the money I spent to purchase it.

If you like movies that leave you with a warm feeling inside you will enjoy this movie and Rhett and Link are very funny throughout.",1402358400,,415,4.227848101265823

3959004,5,B002N8AQDS,"This documentary is wonderful! It had a professional look and was very well put together, but also had that comfortable, casual feeling you get from any Rhett and Link video. I loved that the whole premise is very sentimental but you learn a lot about some very serious issues. I loved this!",1382140800,,291,4.615384615384615
3959005,5,B002N8AQDS,"I started watching RhettandLink online @ YouTube.com and heard of this movie. I first watched it on YouTube but I wanted to own it so I can share it with my family.

Rhett and Link have a clear vision and welcome you along for the ride to find their teacher by old-fashioned word of mouth.  This story is fun, enlightening and touched my heart.  This is not derivative tasteless entertainment.  This is real life - with meaningful reasons to think, cry, and smile wide.  You'll meet distinctive personalities never before seen on screen.  You'll see a journey and hear some great music.  Watch this movie!",1370044800,,553,4.6875
3959007,5,B002N8AQDS,"I'm a Mythical Beast (fan of Rhett & Link), and have been wanting to watch this documentary for some time. Once I got a way to pay online, this was among my first purchases. It came sooner than Amazon predicted.
As for the content, I had no idea with what I would be presented. I was a little disappointed, after watching the documentary, that it didn't go for longer because I loved it so much. Having said that, Rhett and Link had cut half an hour off the original cut, but they included the deleted scenes anyway, so I was delighted to watch them. They also cleverly included some of their earlier songs with music videos, and I thought that was very smart and I appreciated it.
Overall, the documentary is honest, heart-felt and warming. Well worth ordering. I may even be able to use it for my HSC.",1366502400,,803,4.395973154362416

I was not disappointed in the slightest, the journey that these two nostalgic filmmakers embark upon is a modern day treasure hunt. With plenty of laughs and even a few tears R&L give you a truly enjoyable experience.",1340496000,,415,4.073170731707317
3959010,5,B002N8AQDS,"I saw this film on North Carolina Public TV several years ago and loved, loved, loved it!!  It was a quirky, but had a very familiar feeling to me since I live only a few miles from Pembroke, NC.  I enjoyed the two guys' quest for Ms. Locklear and all the characters(many Locklears) they meet on their journey.  Truly a lovely film!!",1336003200,,333,4.338709677419355

3959023,5,B002N8AQDS,"This is the most amazing documentary ever! If I made movies, and if I were good at it, I would want to do this style.

I really liked that they were objective, and didn't have an overly emotional cause, like so many documentaries. Rhett and Link are master storytellers, and they are great at getting regular people to tell a compelling story.

The subject material is really interesting, too. Rhett and Link decide to find their grade school teacher, Ms. Locklear by using just word of mouth, and decide to interview everyone along the way. Most of the interviews take place on a reservation where most people have the last name of Locklear, and who haven't heard of the titular teacher. I really loved this documentary.

Pros:
+Finally, an objective documentary!
+Great interviews with regular people
+A great slice of Americana
+Such a fun show
+Not too long. Just long enough that it left me wanting more

Cons:
-Doesn't have much of Rhett and Link singing, just one song",1310515200,2,975,4.7514792899408285
3959024,5,B002N8AQDS,"My husband is a Lumbee Indian and was given this movie as a gift by our daughter. What a treat! Funny, warm, insightful, it gives a very accurate and affectionate picture of the residents of Robeson County, as well as touching on their struggle for federal recognition (which still continues to this day). We had never heard of these 2 guys before, not being YouTube fans. We thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to everyone no matter their age, ethnic background or heritage. Great tribute to the human spirit shining through in a variety of settings",1310169600,2,553,4.770833333333333
3959025,5,B002N8AQDS,"The name of the film caught my attention and the preview hooked me. Not having been familiar with the Internet comedy team of Rhett McLaughlin and Link Neal, I didn't really know what to expect. As I followed their actual quest to find their first-grade teacher, I began to realize this was a work of art. Not only is it entertaining, but it is deeply insightful into human nature and justice. These bright young film-makers/writers/comedians/musicians are worth following. They just finished a March, 2011 road trip from Florida to Hollywood, CA, stopping to meet people and collect items from them to create a mystery product (another wonderful film, I hope). I sincerely recommend this movie to viewers of any age.",1301529600,,717,4.983333333333333
3959026,5,B002N8AQDS,"Guess I'm the lucky 13th review. This is a truly heartwarming story about Rhett & Links search for the 1st grade teacher that brought them together and inspired them. In their quest they meet many interesting people, and it is these interactions that make this movie so amazing.  R&L's genuine and unasssuming nature creates immediate bonds with everyone they meet, and inturn people are more than willing to help them in their quest. The movie is very different than the R&L's videos, but they did manage to mix in bits of their unique brand of humor to this wonderful story.  All in all a pleasure to watch.
My daughter and I recently became ""Mythical Beasts"" (fans of R&L) and had the pleasure to meet them in LA. We wish them continued success!",1300492800,,748,4.659090909090909

The pair's sense of humor and heart is at the center of this great, small-town tale of nostalgia and acceptance.  Several times, I got misty-eyed and several times, I fell over laughing.  It made me want to not only familiarize myself with the Native American tribes that surround me on the southern East Coast, but it also made me wonder, 'whatever happened to MY first grade teacher?'

Ms. Locklear touched their lives and, because of this little film, she and her community have touched mine too.",1284336000,,657,4.404958677685951

3959030,5,B002N8AQDS,"I'm not a huge fan of Rhett and Link's YouTube Channel, comedy songs aren't my thing unless the music itself can stand on its own, but I do enjoy when they go out and talk to real people. They did this brilliantly in this movie and I hope they do more documentaries on ordinary people with extraordinary lives. They say in the movie that it wasn't their intent to make a movie like this when they first came up with the idea to search for Ms. Locklear but I applaud them for seeing the gold mine that was right in front of them. There's lots of interesting people in this world that you will never meet or know about because they're hidden away in rural areas away from the mainstream. The people they met along their journey were delightful and when they finally find Ms. Locklear, it's the perfect bookend to a great story. What an awesome tribute to all teachers who take their job seriously and have a positive impact on the lives of their students. Ms. Locklear might not have those ""killer bangs"" any more but she's still got it going on and her students are still crazy about her.

If you like documentaries such as ""Brother's Keeper"", ""Crumb"", ""Dead River Rough Cut"", ""Holding On - A love story from the streets."", or even John O'Brien's Vermont Trilogy with ""Man with a Plan"", ""Vermont is for Lovers"", and ""Nosey Parker"", then this movie is for you.",1256342400,,1358,4.475806451612903
