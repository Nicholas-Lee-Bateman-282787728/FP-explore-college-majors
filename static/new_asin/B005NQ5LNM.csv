4849483,5,B005NQ5LNM,"This is only 5 episodes in length but that's about all I can say bad about it. Episodes 1-4 look like the standard martial arts (modern day) anime, with unwilling or unwitting participants battling for the prize. This is accompanied by martial arts attacks that somehow mysteriously always destroy the clothes of each opponent, so not a show for kids. Despite the title, it's not a romance either. (Just so you know if you expected otherwise). The fifth episode turns it in a new direction that I won't go into to keep the surprise intact. Suffice it to say all I could think was ""That's F'd UP!"" and be in shock at the sudden twist that made such an interesting ending.",1287360000,,670,4.545454545454546
4849484,5,B005NQ5LNM,"I bought this last night, and I fell in love with it right away! This is an awesome anime! Yes, it has the action scenes like you see on Pokemon where they do the colourful background and all of that stuff. I just wish that they had more episodes to this anime, or make a volume two of this series.",1287273600,,298,3.9833333333333334
4849485,5,B005NQ5LNM,"Movies or in this case mini series like this are hard to understand. One would look at this and say ""Oh yeah we see boobs that's why you like it."" But honestly the ratio of tittys to screen time is probably 10 to one.
The story is just compelling enough to make you care about the characters. I actually find myself rooting for our heroine and sympathizing with her plight to find a girl she only met just a day before. This shows us a three dimensional aspect of our heroine that is both subtle yet her driving force. This is much needed in the anime genre where too often characters behave spastically for cheap laughs or thrills. Most of the characters in this series are intellegently written and believable. Yet at the same time the conveniant exploding clothes add just the right flavor of exploitative shlock to keep it fun.
While it's deffenetly not for kids. I would recomend checking it out. It's not half bad.",1286841600,,920,4.514970059880239

This anime is high on action, but low on substance, its nothing more than shameless garbage that sucks at making sense, having cool characters or having anything cool other than action scenes. Stay far away from this waste of time as much as you, only watch it if you want to see eye candy boobs and ass shots. 1.5/10",1285372800,6,526,4.717391304347826
4849487,3,B005NQ5LNM,"I've seen it twice now and I still can't decide If It's great or terrible. The fights are ok, a little silly but fairly realistic. The story though is where the whole thing turns sour, or is just hilarious. Basically the first 4 episodes flow pretty normally and that's fine, but the last episode comes out of nowhere and essentially has nothing to do with the rest of the story at all. It's like ordering chicken at a restaurant and getting a leather jacket.",1285372800,20,459,4.476190476190476
4849488,2,B005NQ5LNM,"It only took a quick look at the box to see what I would be getting into with this title.  It's a women-only fighting competition.  Of course, it's all about how much clothing gets torn off in the process.  For all the promise of titilation this show presents (the picture you see is a sleeve around the actual DVD box; the actual box has the girls with peek-a-boo torn clothes and the flip side, the part you can see underneath the DVD inside the box, has them in just panties), it never treats the characters properly for that end.

The show only cares about the main character.  She spends every fight with her clothes shredded and even gets in an unnecessarily (even for this type of show) long shower scene.  The fights are silly.  If a close miss tears a fighter's clothes, it makes some sense.  An uppercut to the chin should not explode someone's shirt!  In every fight, the main character gets beaten within an inch of her life, before she makes an explosive comeback and beats her opponent in one attack.  It literally takes one attack.  Her opponents (the flight attendant; the teacher; the 3 sisters of the cop, the nurse, and the geisha; etc.) are all played up as more attractive, as more seductive fantasies, but the fights never drag out long enough to showcase them.

The plot feels shallow and just ridiculous, until you get to the final episode (of the 5 in the series).  That one episode is about the darkest thing I have ever seen, including Gantz.  It, actually, almost redeems the show.  The last episode shows you what happened behind the scenes and pulls together all the seemingly random events from the other episodes.  At about the 20 minute mark in that episode, you say, ""Wow, they actually had a decent plot going on, here.  I get it.""  Then, you get a Sopranos ending and... WTF?  Just as they show you how good the plot was, they let you decide how it ends.  No, no, no.  That is a pathetic copout.

If you want a show that did this idea the right way, go find Veriable Geo (not ""Neo""; Neo is the hentai version of the original); or try Queen's Blade for a more serious tone.  Both of these shows glorify their characters, making them worthy of admiration.  Martial Hearts got caught between a too-dark plot and a too-light handling of the characters.  Skip this one.",1284595200,13,2300,4.5108958837772395
4849489,1,B005NQ5LNM,"To put it simply, this show is horrible.

While I do admit that I don't mind sadistic shows every now and again, and the final episode of this show was definitely a surprise. Everything leading up to the end was just so incredibly bad that I had to laugh at how serious it was trying to be taken.

-The art is bad (so if you're buying this because of 'topless fighters' then you're going to be out of luck; not to mention it's taken completely out of context)
-The plot is bad
-The plot twists are predictable (except for how gimmicky and cheesy they are.)
-Most of the characters are annoying.
-The voice acting is sub-par (Even for the veteran voice actors on this show. It's obvious not much effort was put into the dubs in this show)
-The final episode is downright depressing if you don't know what you're in for. Seriously, you won't know how to interpret the ending of the show unless you're used to things like it.

Basically, the show is advertised as a lot of things. Here is what it is not:
-A boxing/wrestling sports competition.
-A triumphant story about an underdog overcoming the odds.
-An erotic peep-show.

What it is about (without naming any spoilers) is taking away literally every hope of redemption, twisting it around and spitting it back in your face all the while laughing at how completely and utterly helpless it makes you feel.

Save yourself the time, money and embarrassment and skip this anime. You'll thank me when you see it yourself for free via a friend or some other source.",1281916800,29,1510,4.557195571955719
4849490,3,B005NQ5LNM,"I liked this series. I prefer the clean version though (The type that they'd play in Japan on the T.V. where little boxing gloves cover all the woohoos that pop out. Don't get me wrong I think fan service is fine, but in this case it's all to random and happens so often I mean it's t**s GALOR! I mean they'll be fighting and all the sudden BAM! Clothes fly off! So my review has been pretty negative so far right? Well the reason I give this 3 Stars is because, well a lot of people do NOT like the twist at the very end...I however like it. It's very interesting to me...it reminds me that the people making this anime weren't only thinking about Breasts the whole time :) Anyways, If your not around your mama or girlfriend aren't around it's a decent 5 Episode series.",1281052800,2,772,4.258503401360544
4849491,3,B005NQ5LNM,"I saw this at an anime convention, so I cannot comment on the physical disk being sold. If you purchase this, it will probably be for the exploding clothes of all the fighters. That is the main reason why this should be considered ""R"" rated. The fights consume most of the episodes. There are three separate components to this story, and the first is the fan service during the fights.

The second component is the humor. Some of the humor is in your face, such as the energy food that the girls eat at a fast food restaurant. Some of the humor is more subtle, such as what is being said, or not said. See if you can pick out the real dialog from Aya's mother, when Aya comes home with her clothes knocked off. a.) ""Dear, why are you coming home from high school every day without any clothes on?"", b.) ""Dear, I can't make you a new school uniform every day."", or c.) ""Dear, where are you getting all this money to buy new uniforms every day?""

The third component is the basic plot line. The revelation of who is doing what, and why, is sort of dumped on you at the end of the last episode in a tangled mess. At the end you feel like Aya ought to take them all to the top of a building and blow them up. Although Aya is basically a fun, nice girl, I'm not sure anyone would want to get close to her after all this.",1280793600,4,1315,4.11284046692607

4849506,5,B005NQ5LNM,"A lot of people say its terrible and I was expecting it to be really bad but it wasn't. I actually liked it and this is not the worst I've seen since the only similar show that's like this one is ikkitousen which wasn't that good. For a 5 episode series this is better that other 13 episode series that barely even explain anything and for the last episode that people hated, it wasn't that much of a surprise to me since it had hints of what to expect during the beginning of the last episode, but it needs at least another episode to show what happens to Aya and her mom after the tournament and who now controls the martial hearts tournament since it ended like those horror movies with the last scene showing someone terrified after seeing a ""dead person"". For me its not worth buying at $25 for just 5 episodes, I got it cheaper at $11 also don't buy it if your getting it just because of the panty shots or partial nudity since it's focused more the story/action which is better than other shows that are all about panty shots with a really boring plot.",1355270400,,1059,4.3

4849509,3,B005NQ5LNM,"Alright, so just got finished watching this on Netflix.  Actually had wanted to buy it because it sounded like a light hearted entertaining watch with only five episodes of fan service fighting.  So I wasn't expecting much going into it, and through the first four episodes I basically got what I expected.  And actually enjoyed the first four episodes and the simple plot of women being sent to fight each other and whoever wins gets their wish granted.  The main character Aya gets drawn in by wanting to find this girl Miko who disappears after having literally just met her.  Thought that was shaky, but for a five episode show I let it slide.

Then we get to the end of episode three where it seems that the leader running the Martial Heart is the boy Aya has been crushing on forever.  We get through episode four which was fine though I felt it was choppy at the very end when they just kinda gloss over the time between the third to last and semi-final fight.  And then we get the WTF final episode.  Wont lie, I expected Aya to win and there would probably be some kinda surprise with the girl Miko about whether she was alive or not.  But it went SO far beyond that that the end just became a wtf nonsensical half hour(or well 24 minutes, whatever).

I'm all for dark stories and everything, as well as twists but this was just so messed up.  I mean the only hint of anything really was Aya's fighting where she seemed to almost become a different person.  She even brings it up once in episode 2 or 3 but otherwise doesn't bother with it, okay in kicking the crap outta the competition if it means finding this girl she apparently cares so much about despite having just met her.  Anyway the ending was so far out of left field that it came out of the left field of an entirely different field across town.

Anyway, Aya wins after the psychic semi-finalist harps on her about how pathetic she is and how she has evil inside her.  So then Aya starts glowing with a dark aura and totally takes her out.  Then Miko shows up acting totally fine, and leads her to some mysterious warehouse.  There Aya is shown that all the losers somehow become mindless sex slaves, which isn't explained how they lost their minds.  The best assumption is that somehow EVERY competitor, when they lose and know they won't get their wish granted, and their minds break.  Which would be fine...except it happened to every loser which is a stretch.

After that we're shown that Aya's crush, who seemed to be in control of the competition was just some guy who's never explained, who has a fetish for plastic surgery.  Of course the crush is behind it, but that's all part of some crazy crap anyway.  So then the plastic surgery copy is killed, and we're treated to a long explanation of how Aya's father was also Miko's father and abusive, and that her parents started the Martial Hearts tournament that got Miko's mother killed and Aya's best friend and crush's mother muted and sold into slavery.  On top of that we're treated to them constantly harping about how Aya of course is an evil spawn, and stupid to boot.  That they set this all up to force her into the Martial Heart to show her how evil she is as revenge against her mother(and departed father) for all the damage they did.

Which might've been okay if this wasn't a five episode series that hinted at basically none of this.  The whole thing about Aya having some dark evil inside her is pathetic and aside from her fighting, only used as a source of ridicule at the end.  Nothing about the parents or the past is touched upon until the end monologue where we have no real idea who's right because at the end Aya's mother comes in saying the girls were wrong and that both their mothers were sisters who killed Aya's father and all because it was all set into motion by their grandparents.  Then she proceeds to kill both the girls and patch Aya's gunshot wounds.  And then there's the fact that after Aya's mother talks about them leading their own lives and Aya is still laying on the ground it cuts to an explosion and then Aya's mother talks about how ""there goes the last heir"" or whatever, then finds out there is still apparently one more competitor left.  At this point it cuts to outside the building and Aya has apparently escaped, without anything shown of her leaving.  Had to rewind twice because I thought I missed something.  And then we cut to Aya's ""best friend's"" mother who's apparently crazy and stabbing pictures of Aya, as she answers a doorbell and we see her shocked face then it ends.

Honestly I don't even care it ended on a cliffhanger, because it seemed to imply either Aya or her mother killed her.  But it's the whole back story of the parents and who was right or wrong and all that nonsense that killed this for me.  I mean hell the plot of a girl fighting to win her wish was fine enough for a five episode show without suddenly throwing in this nonsense.  That and aside from when she's had the crap kicked out of her, Aya has been nothing but a good person so Miko and the other girl were totally demented in forcing Aya to fight just for some messed up plot of revenge against her mother and departed father.

It really honestly feels like this show should've been like 13 episodes where they could've built the mystery of the girls' parents and all that stuff along the way and then have it culminate in a good finale.  This feels almost like a preview of a series.  Like here, watch a couple episodes to wet your whistle and then be in store for the full series.  But of course this is the full series, so gotta say disappointed.  It was fine until the last episode where they tried to make it this dark, mysterious plot that was nonsensical and came out of nowhere.  Oh well I guess, I think I'm going to give it three stars mainly because the first four episodes were just fine, it was just the last episode that blew.  So it was okay I guess.",1341360000,2,5937,4.412304866850321

4849512,1,B005NQ5LNM,"I watched ""Master of Martial Hearts"" on Netflix, and the only thing that makes me happy about that is that I didn't actually waste money buying the DVD in addition to the time I wasted watching it.

The story starts out as a pretty generic girl vs girl fighting tournament, with a set of pretty stereotyped contestants. The ""heroine"" is a schoolgirl, and other contestants include a miko, a stewardess, a teacher, and an idol singer. They are fighting for a magic gem, the ""marital heart"" which will supposedly grant a wish to the winner.  Of course there is a lot of fan service, but it manages to seem silly and forced, even for something of this genre, where ""battle shredded"" clothing is pretty much the norm.  I think the only reason I actually made it to the end of the series is due to the fact that it is very short- only 5 episodes. I'm actually kind of wishing I had not finished the series off, because the ending is one of the biggest WTF moments I have ever seen in an anime ever- and not in a good way, either. While the rest of the series is pretty generic with only hints of a darker purpose, the finale turns suddenly and viciously dark, as if the creators suddenly decided ""Well, this generic fluff isn't working out! Let's pile in as much out-of-the-blue bad stuff at the end as we can, so we shock the audience so much that they might think it's good storytelling, and blow everything up. The End.""

Seriously, don't waste your time, and especially not your money.  There's better fighting anime out there, better ""wtf mess with the audience"" anime out there, and heck even anime with much better fan service than Martial Hearts.",1327363200,2,1649,4.501672240802676

4849514,1,B005NQ5LNM,"There is little good to say about this anime the animation is OK at best most of  the time the characters are standing and talking and when they do fight the animation is choppy and stiff all the fights end when the protagonist attacks all the fights run like this: *bad guy attack main character* *main character's clothes rip off* ( which makes no sense whatsoever someone gets punched in the face and their shirt rips off that doesn't even make any sense!) *main character gets pissed and delivers  two or three punches and the fights over*. That's basically the fights of the show not to mention the unnecessary nudity even if you like that ecchi stuff this does a pretty bad job at it. The plot is pretty unoriginal girls fight to get magical item that grants any wish, the main character finds a girl dressed as a priestess fighting a flight stewardess ( yea i know) she helps her beat her then befriends the priest then the priest girl (named Miko) disappears. So the main character fights to bring her back she does this for 4 more episodes but fighting all types of women dressed up in different garb one is a cop one's a magical maid etc. But the last episode is SO dumb it comes out of no where and not in a good way it was just a poorly used plot device that left me pissed and confused. Then after 20 minutes of the villians saying why the main character sucks this is where the writers que a deus ex machina that makes no sense at all then they make the unexpected twist even more confusing and end the series on a cliffhanger. No Closure at all not even worth watching for the nudity i didn't even buy this DVD i watched it on Netflix so please people don't waste money on this Anime in short it sucks eggs.",1322956800,3,1722,4.311728395061729

Then at the very last episode, I guess they wanted to throw in some big twist, but it really just kinda...Flopped. Overall, I only gave this 2 stars (which is being kind) because the dub is fairly good, the artwork isn't completely horrible, and it had the opportunity to be great (which it definitely didn't end up being).

4849526,4,B005NQ5LNM,"I'm sorry, but I absolutely love a mind-blowing ending, especially in this era of sequels and remakes run amuck.  This five-part series actually delivers its biggest punches after all of the intense fighting is over with.  It's unfortunate that it was presented in the guise of a fan service romp because the nudity and all the ""pervert cam"" shots take away from what I (if no one else) found to be a pretty good story.  It's just stupid for all these girls' clothes to disintegrate and fall off with each punch or kick.  The only impact it has on the story is the main character's need to fight with the handicap of trying to cover herself at the same time.  On top of that, all of the combatants represent some type of fetish - stewardess, nurse, cop, etc.  I also have to question all the criticism that there is hardly any plot to speak of here.  If you ask me, there's possibly too much packed into this storyline, most of it crammed into the final, reality-flipping episode.  You actually have to think about it a little bit in order to keep up, and that seems to be more than some people want to do.  Certainly, it's too much for those who watch this solely for all the frontal nudity.  It's really just as well that the ending is bound to go over the heads of twelve-year-old boys because parents really shouldn't be letting them watch this kind of program in the first place.

So here's the story.  Schoolgirl best friends Aya and Natsume are walking home one day when they suddenly come across a brutal fight between a stewardess and a young lady in a priestess outfit.  Said stewardess is pretty much kicking the girl's butt AND being a witch with a b in the process, thus provoking Aya to jump in and save the day with her hidden martial arts abilities.  Afterwards, the little priestess, Miko, explains how she is competing in the Martial Hearts tournament in order to fulfill her wish to have friends.  It's basically an underground fight club (despite the fact that all the fights take place in public places mysteriously devoid of other people) that promises the ultimate winner the granting of her greatest wish via the mysterious Platonic Heart.  The losers, unfortunately, are said to disappear into the dark realms.  That night, Aya learns that she has unwittingly become a contestant in the tournament, and she vows to continue fighting in order to find Miko, who has mysteriously disappeared by the next morning.  Each episode pits her against one or more female opponents in clothes-shedding combat.

It sounds like a pretty simplistic storyline that will eventually reveal the fates of Miko and the other missing fighters, but the fifth and final episode has more twists than a giant bag of pretzels wrapped in barbed wire.  Whatever you're expecting, you're all but certain to be surprised, quite possibly confused, and just maybe sent reeling.  Yes, it's far more than anyone could have predicted based on the first four episodes; on the other hand, we're not talking about the writers dropping bombshells on viewers several seasons into a beloved series.  It's just five episodes, people.  Frankly, the fact that Master of Martial Hearts refuses to bow down to anyone's expectations makes me love it all the more.",1320278400,,3240,4.736185383244207
4849527,2,B005NQ5LNM,"there is a martial arts tournament only for women.....and at the end the winner can have anything she wants, but the losers are never seen again.  at least that is the rumor about the Martial Hearts tournament that goes around the city.  but when a young lady runs into a tournament match between two fighters, she gets drawn into the fight.  when her new friend (one of the fighters) disappears she is given the chance to join.  can she fight to the end and save her friend, or is their something more sinister afoot.

the series is only 5 episodes long, very rushed character development, and the fight scenes are akin to Ikki Tousen where the fighters end up naked.  but the ending is a real mind twist when things get revealed.  overall not a great series, but had a couple of good points.  i would suggest hulu or renting over buying.....",1318032000,4,843,4.5

The show was obviously made to be longer, probably 12-24 episodes in length and starts off fairly well, but doesn't really explain anything and comes accross as rather disjointed.

Its the kind of show that advertises fanservice and there is some, it has the Ikkitousen clothes get shreded when you get hit effect, like the creators ripped off that idea from Ikkitousen, however even this can't save a terribly dull show.

It quite simply is boring, and really, really badly done, normally in a story you're meant to care about characters, or like them, but in this, there is simply nothing, nothing at all to like.

The ending is deus ex machina and makes little to no sense, and a certain event happens and the show just ends, no explainations, nothing, you get this vibe that the budget ran out, or that they were trying to be deep, but failing so ridiculusly bad its not even funny.

The bad thing is there is only 5 episodes. The first 4 episodes are pretty coherent but this echhi lost me on episode 5, I didn't quite understand what the characters were talking about.

This echhi doesn't show you ""down there"" if you know what I mean but if you like echhi or hentai then you will see that this echhi compensates for that by a good amount of T&A.

In fact, if you have Netflix I think it's still on the instant play, if it is you can check it out on Netflix if you have it.",1308182400,,761,4.170068027210885
4849530,5,B005NQ5LNM,"For the record this anime isn't for everyone. If you don't like women, women fighting, ikki tousen type of fan service, and a dark story than you really won't be able to get into this one. What appears to be just another quirky t&a anime completely flips on you. What you end up with is Baki the Grappler type of fights only with women instead. The ending is so dark and unexpected it really makes the anime. Watching it I felt just like the character being torn completely apart as everything collapsed around her.

  Just the fact that the main character is a girl with an uncanny fighting ability *spoiler here* that was unable to find friends because she scared them all away, and when she does she finds herself realizing that she never had a friend at all *spoiler end* is amazing. What appeared to be just a cheap intro story turned into something much deeper. For such a short anime it's pretty brilliant. Although with only 5 episodes don't expect everything to be in great detail over a lengthy episode.

 You really have to pay attention or you won't understand the ending at all. As I suspect a majority of the lower scoring reviewers didn't get. *spoiler* It would however been nice for them to explain just exactly how they turned the fighters that lost into sex slaves *spoiler end*. Although they tried I think it would take more than just having your dreams crushed to end up like that.

What made this anime for me was the ending. It's a serious mind blower. I can't see this brief series continuing as there really would be no point. It's more like a short story about revenge.

It may not be as deep as other animes out there but it really hit the spot.",1306713600,3,1673,4.465573770491804

The first four episodes play through decently enough as it paints a story about a girl trying to overcome hardship and rescue a friend.  The plot up to this point isn't amazing but it's not half bad either.  Only for the final episode, in what I can only IMAGINE is an attempt to be creative and surprising, to throw out the most insane twists out of nowhere that has NOTHING to do with ANYTHING in the story up until then.  A couple aspects you can see coming but other than that, the extreme lengths the developers went to in order to make the ending as shocking and morbid as possible are almost laughable if not such a weak and random disappointment.  It will leave you feeling depressed and baffled.

It does have a lot of fan service and it can be a bit ridiculous (shirt exploding uppercuts) but as silly as it may be, it's hardly different than similar fan service animes, so if you are ok with them you should be fine with it here.

Overall you can just simply do much better for your money.",1304035200,,1252,4.248945147679325

8480716,2,B005NQ5LNM,"That's how the ending was.

Okay, here's what I hoped for:

1. Extra-ecchi-feast with tons of constanty ecchi
2. Terrible ending because people said it had a bad ending

I didn't get number 1, but I got number 2 for sure...

What is sad is that it actually started to get pretty good after episode 1. The plot got better and better and then... it ended. Like that. Maybe they were just trolling us or something?

Would've been 1 star but like I said, the plot was starting to get good.",1393200000,,485,4.285714285714286

The fights are good,the best parts for men are the clothes coming off showing breasts & BUTT.The ending was not that good though. Also there is death with guns for those who like that stuff. The series maybe better if they had more fights.",1384646400,,370,4.3
8480718,1,B005NQ5LNM,"When I first watched MoMH, I went expecting something like Ikki Tousen, a clothes-exploding fan-service show. At first the show was what I expected. Lots of girls fighting and a lot of fan-service. It was around the 4th episode that something seemed different. The series begins to take a really disturbing turn plot-wise. The show at first seems like a typical light-hearted fan-service show, everything from the box to the first episodes seem to emphasize fan-serivce over everything else. The story is about a young girl fighting other random women with the help of two female friends and the boy the main character is interested in. It seems like a typical generic ecchi anime until the end. The last two episodes are where everything changes for the worse. The plot goes on a totally unexpected dark turn that is just baffling.

**SPOILERS HERE READ THE NEXT SECTION ONLY IF YOU WANT TO AND HAVE NO INTEREST IN THIS SHOW** The main villain is revealed to be a handicapped mute woman and all the women the main girl defeats are subjected to an absolutely disgusting form of punishment(not in the perverted sense, but in the just sickening sense). Then it reveals that the main girls' friends and the boy she loves is in on the whole thing to take revenge on the main girls mother. The girls mother then arrives and snaps everyone's neck except the main girl and then the mother chooses to die in a fire. The anime ends with the main girl showing up at the mute woman's home to presumably kill the mute woman. That's the ending, I'm dead serious. I couldn't make up such a stupid ending.

**END SPOILERS**
The ending is just baffling, it's literally out of nowhere. It's makes no sense, and the last episode spends most of the time trying to explain it, and the ending still makes no sense. Instead of being just dark, the ending is just disturbing. It literally made me feel sick,it's like watching a bad slasher movie. I have seen horror movies less disturbing then this. The best way I can describe it is the ending is like the ending from School Days but not interesting at all. The best way to describe this show is Ikki Tousen until the last 2 episodes then it turns into Elfen Lied, and it has the School Days ending. I'm really only talking about the ending here because that is the only thing worth talking about. The rest of the show is just generic fan-service and fighting. The animation is nothing special, and the sub/dub is forgettable at best.

In the end please avoid this anime at all costs. This the worst modern anime I have ever seen. I have seen some really bad anime and this is easily the worst modern anime I have seen. It's not the worst I have seen, but it's right under that because unlike this garbage show I actually destroyed that other DVD(which I will review in the future). Basically even if you are into fan-service, this is not worth it at all. If you watch this only watch the first 3 episodes, avoid the last 2 episodes as if you watch them, you'll never want to watch the show again.",1382400000,,3025,4.5366300366300365
