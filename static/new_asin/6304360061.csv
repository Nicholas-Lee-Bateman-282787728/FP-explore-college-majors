But during World War II anxious Americans had to wait for newsreel stories at their local theaters to see images of what our troops were doing in the European and Pacific Theaters.  ""V for Victory"" is a 10-volume set that tells the story of World War II through newsreel stories.  Hosted by veteran journalists Eric Sevareid and Edwin Newman, we learn about not only the campaigns and battles, but also the generals and politicians who defined the war.
This series consists of the following episodes: (I) Pearl Harbor to Midway; (II) Guadalcanal and the Pacific Counterattack; (III) North Africa and the Global War; (IV) Anzio and the Italian Campaign; (V) D-Day and the Battle for France; (VI) Tarawa and the Island War; (VII) Women at War--From the Home Front to the Front Lines; (VIII) The Battel of the Bulge and the Drive to the Rhine; (IX) Iwo Jima, Okinawa and the Push on Japan; and (X) The Eagle Triumphant.
I think the ""V for Victory"" series offers wonderful opportunities for history teachers to supplement their textbooks.  I am not advocating screening the entire series, but certainly within these 10-volumes you can easily find a dozen choice newsreels that will focus on what you want to emphasize.  These newsreel stories provide a sense of realism and vitality, of getting the news from the front that you really cannot get from a documentary or a Hollywood film.  From Pearl Harbor to the birth of Atomic Warfare, you will probably find a newsreel story that covers what you would like to highlight to your students.",1012003200,,1609,4.811594202898551
