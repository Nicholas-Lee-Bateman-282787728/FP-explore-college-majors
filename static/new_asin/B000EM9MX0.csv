2522333,4,B000EM9MX0,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  I'm shocked that more people don't know about it, and even more shocked that it never received a proper DVD release.  This movie is hilarious -- definitely a ""Spinal Tap"" for country music....but it's not a rip-off of Spinal Tap.  Even if you aren't a fan of Country music, you should see this movie...it's funny and has a cast of some great actors/actresses.  I hope that this film someday sees the light of day (i.e. major distribution).  It was originally only available as a rental (or as a purchase on VHS) from Blockbuster.  But it's so much better than that.  In Summary:  A great parody that I can watch again and again.",1242777600,,673,4.55
2522334,5,B000EM9MX0,"Just imagine if you combined the characters from 'This Is Spinal Tap!' with the legendary Billy Ray Cyrus. Then you'd have this delightful mockumentary 'Dill Scallion.' The film stars Billy Burke as the title character. Dill is down-and-out school bus driver who aspires to be a country music star. Through a series of lucky breaks, he gets the chance to travel to Nashville for his big opportunity. After cutting a radio spot for the Waffle Barn restaurant, Dill meets up with a group of local musicians. The rest, as they say, is history. This film is littered with interesting cameos, among them are Henry Winkler (who promises Dill a belt buckle as big as a cow turd if he makes it), Lauren Graham, Jason Priestley, LeAnn Rimes, Willie Nelson, Kathy Griffin and Peter Berg. The soundtrack is hilarious, thanks to some help from Sheryl Crow. This film unfortunately slipped through the cracks and never got the chance to find its audience. It's worth a rent, but you're going to have to pay attention closely to pick up on all the comedy. Definitely file this flick in ""cult classic"" category.",1113782400,6,1096,4.804232804232805
2522335,5,B000EM9MX0,"I bought this DVD purely for Billy Burke. It's very campy and full of humor. The cast is fantastic, Billy is amazing!",1357430400,,117,4.363636363636363
2522336,5,B000EM9MX0,Excellent documentary spoof.  I do not like country western music but I thought this was a hilarious movie.  I would recommend it.,1356480000,,130,4.863636363636363
2522337,3,B000EM9MX0,This movie was so funny when I first saw it but now it's a little dated.  The picture is fuzzy - but it's still funny.,1344816000,,118,3.72
2522338,5,B000EM9MX0,"Ifyou liked Spinal Tap, this is the country/western version. This movie is hillarious. The songs, the dance, Dill, and Minnie Pearl's nephew Bubba Pearl, they're all worth watching.",1281139200,,181,5.5
2522339,5,B000EM9MX0,"I'm so glad to have finally found Dill Scallion on DVD!  It's one of the funniest movies ever.  A great addition to my ""Mockumentaries.""",1271376000,3,136,4.625
2522340,5,B000EM9MX0,"I had not heard of Billy Burke before Twilight...I will admit.

I was interesed in all the actors and actresses who were in that
movie...So, researched some of their work old and in process.

I also read that Ms Hardwicke had seen Dill Scallion and that is
why she chose him for Twilight...

So, on a whim, I bought it...it wasn't easy to find to tell the
truth...

I was not in the least disappointed...What a wonderful little movie
and to see Mr Burke in a whole other genre of movie besides being ""Bellas
Dad in  Twilight was great.

I highly reccomend it. If you are not a ""country music"" fan, don't
worry, you'll enjoy the ""poking fun"" at country stars...that's just
pure humor not rude or mean.

If you are a ""country music"" fan (as I have been my whole life)
 you'll still enjoy the gentle pokes at the country music establishment.

Mr Burke has a fine voice, and would love to see him actually make a
CD one day...",1270944000,3,922,4.345029239766082
2522341,5,B000EM9MX0,"Dill Scallion is one of the most hilarious movies ever made.  I wore out 2 VHS tapes before they finally released the DVD.  And like other reviewers, I'm really surprised that it didn't earn a bigger release hullabaloo.  Particularly with the rise of 'claw-n-scratch-my-way-up-off-the-D-List' Ms. Kathy Griffin on board.  The Mockumentary genre has (at least in my opinion) grown up to be a bit too contrived and polished.  While still funny, it feels like everyone's figured out the recipe. Dill Scallion brings us back to all the deliciously awkward/painful stuff that made Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman so wonderful.  I'd love for it to get the attention it deserves, but I also like being the one to introduce Dill to unsuspecting friends. Yee-haw, loyal Scallionaires!",1262822400,,778,5.134920634920635
2522342,5,B000EM9MX0,"I am so happy to see this movie on DVD.  One of the best movies ever!  I have shown it to at least a dozen people and they all love it, too.  Every country music lover (or hater) should own a copy.  Well worth the money.",1255910400,,220,3.717391304347826
2522343,5,B000EM9MX0,i looked for this movie on DVD for years. i'm thrilled to finally own it~and have watched it a dozen times already :),1254268800,3,117,4.130434782608695
2522344,5,B000EM9MX0,"Just how does one wind up wearing a belt buckle big as a dinner plate (hint: it's a gradual build-up).
And maybe winning back with your music the gal who broke your heart - maybe that ain't really such a good thing.
And that dance, that gd dance they all love, well that just ain't natural.

A mockumentary a la Spinal Tap, with a country flavor and twang that just hurts so good - one of my top ten favorite, laugh-til-you-hurt movies.",1248048000,,436,4.317073170731708

My favorite scene is the one with Dill at the radio station K102 with DJ John Hines and his super handsome, awesome and charismatic K102 Morning Show co-host. (Can't remember his name, but his performance was Oscar-worthy!) Many fun cameos and hilarious supporting cast. I think the ""Spinal Tap"" comparison does a disservice to the unique charm of this film and its many lovable characters. Belly laughs from start to finish. Jordan Brady's outstanding hickumentary deserves a much larger audience. It has nationwide appeal even if you hate country music.",1519689600,,940,7.877358490566038
8111074,3,B000EM9MX0,"I saw maybe 30 minutes of this on cable a while back, and it looked pretty good so I thought I might like to have it on DVD. But no way am I paying $44 plus. What in the world would make an 17-year-old unknown movie with B-list stars so expensive!!? I don't get it.",1460160000,,265,3.8363636363636364
