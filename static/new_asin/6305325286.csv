7887587,1,6305325286,"I am a long time fan of Al Lewis and I have to say that this film left me feeling very sad and depressed. It starts out promising, with Al getting in the makeup chair to get ready for yet another appearance, and he is taped sort of reminiscing about his life. I thought it would have lots of stuff that I hadn't seen before, maybe some information that I hadn't know about, but no. What I got were clips of civil rights movements and protests that had nothing to do with Al Lewis personally. There was one clip that I had not seen which shows Al at what looked to me like a Bar Mitzvah and not a civil rights protest. It seems that it's almost an attempt at socialist propaganda instead of a tribute to Al Lewis.

If you're looking for something uplifting and ""Grandpa Munster-ish"" please, I beg you, look elsewhere. The biography ""Forever Grandpa"" that is included in The Munsters DVD set is total GOLD compared to this depressing turd.",1369008000,,937,4.385057471264368
7887588,3,6305325286,I thought the acting was decent for this film. I thought Josh Brolin played a good role in it; as well as beautiful scenery.,1339804800,,124,4.208333333333333
7887589,4,6305325286,"I bought this DVD as soon as it was released & have watched it like 10 times.  This main premise of this movie is the closing of/the US Navy pulling out of Subic Bay, Philippines.  With that, there are multiple interesting subplots that are impacted one way or another by this event.  Even though it was shot entirely on location in & around Subic Bay/Olonggapo, it is a 100% Hollywood production.  All of the main cast are American actors.  I liked that they employed locally famous Filipino actors to play all the supporting roles.  How can you go wrong with Michael York, James Brolin, Rae Dawn Chong, & Alexis Arquette (before he became a she)?  I'm not going to list all the mini story lines that make this a great enjoyable movie.  It's got action, drama, romance, history all in one film.  Some of you might find the ending slightly over the top, but it's good entertainment and the movie never drags.  You won't be bored, I promise.",1334016000,,940,4.541666666666667
7887590,5,6305325286,I enjoyed this movie. I have been to Subic so that made it even more enjoyable to watch.,1253404800,2,88,3.9444444444444446
7887591,5,6305325286,"A movie that touches on a historical moment in the Philippines. The Philippine Congress decided not to renew the pact that allowed the U.S. to operate and maintain the U.S. Subic Bay Naval Base and the U.S. Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines. This movie takes place on the Subic Naval Base and was filmed on location in the Philippines. A great collection of American Actors and Filipino Actors performed in this fictional, high energy, action packed film. A great movie.",1230422400,3,476,4.817073170731708
7887592,3,6305325286,"To my great surprise, this is actually one of the few Philippine based films I've seen where Americans aren't stereotyped as ridiculous-looking cowboys with broad-brimmed hats and cheesy western accents.  Many Filipino movies unfortunately include American characters and poke fun at them, in a pathetically inaccurate and deeply misleading way. But this film didn't, and so I took it seriously.  Based on the background of the plot regarding American soldiers stationed in Subic Naval Base, this is a fairly accurate portrayal of the characters and the real people whom they were loosely based on.
Nevertheless, the story and plot are entirely fictional. There's definitely some romantic drama involved in this movie, particularly concerning an interracial affair between an American soldier and a Filipina.  On the other hand, there's also some action and a strange twist of events as one of the US soldiers turn psycho and try to blow everything up. So in terms of plot summary, I wouldn't call this movie as ingenuous.  The story is rather predictable. So it is largely because of this that I gave the review 3 stars.
However, I do admire how Filipino filmmakers have done a wonderful collaboration to produce this piece which I may say could generate some serious pride in Philippine filmmaking.  The cinematography rivals that of the big-budget US films, and I know from a fact that much effort was made to produce a truly porfessional and epic scale movie like this one. So this DVD would be okay to have in your collection, if you are interested in learning more about the Philippines and its foreign policy towards the US.  It's not a historical documentary, but it's a good watch.  Plus, where else could you see a movie with beautiful Filipino actors and actresses as well as acclaimed actors from the US put together?",1039910400,13,1829,4.977049180327869
7887593,4,6305325286,"As a former Navy Vet who spent more than 6 years in the philippines this movie brought back a lot of memories. I left just a couple years before the base closure. While this movie was not 100% accurate some of it was right on. Especially the blackmail attempt, and the semi-accidental killing of the filipino. While I was station-dito there were more than several instances of Filipine Marine or locals and Navy or marine sentries shooting each other and worse. The women were very enticing its true many of my friends including myself brought home Filipina brides (16 years and counting). I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and will definately buy it on DVD. BTW if you are reading this and remember me for P.I... drop me an email.",978307200,8,728,4.651162790697675
