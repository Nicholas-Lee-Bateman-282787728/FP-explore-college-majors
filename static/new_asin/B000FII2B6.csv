2567517,5,B000FII2B6,"I have seen many full length classical ballets in a not short life.  I go to them because they are there and I like dance.  I must admit I found most tedious -- until I discovered the Paris Opera Ballet and the ballet restaging of Rudolf Nureyev.  I know that many complain about these re-stagings.  And about Nureyev's choreography.  But I find both infinitely interesting, fun and extra ordinarily beautiful.  The legato solo of the prince in the second act (which is long 7-8 min) is lovely and mesmerizing.  And the fact that the prince is given more of a role serves to bring him fully alive and into the storyline.  In most productions he is tacked on and only gets to dance in the third act pas de deux or when acting as a porteur.  Which was always my problem with the Petipa ballets.  It is my belief that Petipa drastically changed the role of men in dance.  You can see this most clearly by looking at the ballets.  Earlier works such as La Sylphide and Giselle have respectable roles for men.  Later ballets such as Swan Lake and Sleeping Beauty emphasize the women.  Its a pretty clear demarcation.  Actually I would advise investigating both types of dance -- you won't loose and whichever one you pick you will find enjoyment.  You will simply find greater enjoyment by choosing the Paris Opera Ballet <g>.",1397001600,,1321,4.5574468085106385

This version of the ballet was staged and choreographed by Rudolf Nureyev, and is excellent!",1383523200,,134,5.380952380952381

2567520,5,B000FII2B6,"This is one of the best, if not THE BEST presentation of The Sleeping Beauty performances available to purchase.  Words cannot describe how elegant and beautiful the dancers are.  Aurelie Dupont and Manuel Legris are a perfect couple as they attain grace and majesty unsurpassed by others.  Ms. Dupont's attention to detail, her precision, and her balance on pointe are all elegant and at some times unbelievable.  Her performance of The Rose Adagio is superb.  Mr. Legris' turns are so smoothly executed; the height he attains in his jumps and leaps is spectacular.  Watch the quickness and precision of his footwork. As a couple their timing with the music is perfect.  They move as one when executing the same steps.  Watch their arms, legs, feet, even heads and fingers move together.  It is amazing!

The music, of course, is glorious. The POB settings befit royalty, and the colorful costumes are lovely.  Do buy this ballet if you want the best dancing.  It is much better (in my opinion) than the Royal Ballet version, if you prefer more dancing and less standing around gesturing.

There is no Red Riding Hood & Wolf, but there is a selection of Precious Stones that is beautiful, and more than makes up for the loss of a character dance.  I really enjoyed this version of Puss in Boots & the White Cat as the dancers expressions and movements were so very ""cat-like"".  The dancers for the Bluebird Pas de Deux were excellent.

This has become my favorite ballet.",1379808000,,1472,4.758893280632411

Not to gush on too long but if you want a superb example of this seminal piece (fairy tale) this is a good one.
Naturally there are one or two hesitations (like the video overlays at the beginning) but who cares as the
sum of its parts is so good. Choosing between this and the Cojocaru Royal Ballet version (what a cast!) would be delightfully
excruciating so buy them both for different reasons- each is worth it.",1376524800,,517,4.51063829787234

Whether it is the outworldy character of the performers, or Mr. David Coleman who seems to be delicately and in a cautious mannner expressed possessing Humane characters where every other participants no more or no less seem to be the very feature they convey to the viewer, or supernatural characters, in every way, the shear contrast and highly diverse scenes, that seem to have the least relevance, brings out such a dissonance so strong and intense, that it is quite sufficient to cause a state of experience very similar to some kind of coma, for one cannot possibly notice, until one leaves that state. Anyhow, the practice that performers vie to be the character they portray, it is obvious that individually, interrelatedly and intrarelatedly, groupwise, and every participant that takes part in the work, such as stage setters, costume designers, chorigraphers, light managers, and everyone who makes that work a reality, plays and is that feature and that character itself. That is why there is no need to play, and the play is as real as consumes the entire attention of the viewer to the highest degree. Other than that, the colors are very lively vivid and pleasant from the outfits stage light and everything else.

2567536,5,B000FII2B6,"We have never seen another DVD version of this ballet, so comparisons are out of order. What can be said is that the Paris Opera Ballet let out all the stops, providing a gay evening for all onlookers. The scenic design and the costumes, with their brightly illuminated colors, gave the performers the plumage to look great, and they did look great. More significantly, of course, they danced with considerable skill and, apparent, enthusiasm. Certainly both Petipa, the original choreographer, and Nurayev, modifier for the Paris Opera version, would have been proud with what the latter's two former collaborators have given us. I should think watching this DVD would brighten an evening for other neophytes as it did for us.",1301788800,,727,5.066666666666666

Over all, this is a wonderful production; Dupont's Aurora is lovely and delicate without being too girly, and her technique is impressive without being garish.",1200009600,,367,4.983606557377049
2567542,3,B000FII2B6,"I've always loved Sleeping Beauty and my favorite part of the ballet has always been the variations in the last act (Just FYI, there is no Red riding Hood in this version and interesting enough ""Puss"" of Puss and Boots is not a cat??)  I don't want to say the Paris Opera version of this ballet was bad, but the choreography is not at all the same as any version I've ever seen, for the most part.  There are (and I couldn't believe it) 24 lilac fairy attendants!  Overall, there are just too many people in this version and it was far too busy, choreographically.  Rudolf certainly is to be commended for being ambitious enough to put this many people on stage at one time, but it was just too busy for me.  The dancing overall was good (there were 2 fairies that stood out and Aurora and the prince were phenomenal) but other than that, the dancers didn't really WOW me.  Overall a good production, but not great.  And I usually love the Paris Opera ballet.  Oh and I really didn't like Carabosse and really, REALLY disliked the fact that the Lilac Fairy was not one of the other fairies, but instead a 'character' role, very much like carabosse.  Just weird and not at all like the classic.

She dances with precision and delicacy with so much feminity. Manuel Legris is excellent too. He has much elegance. The corps de ballet is perfect, as usual.
The settings are breathtaking. It is royal. No other word would fit. It shines with gold and opulence, with a ""Versaillesque"" classicism and grandeur in the prologue and first act, and in the baroque style of the XVIII century in the third act.

2567557,5,B000FII2B6,"There are many fine and thorough reviews on this performance by Paris Opera Ballet. I'll keep mine brief - this is a most excellent interpretation of the greatest of all ballets. The costumes and sets are visually lavish. The primary etoiles - Aurelie DuPont and Manuel Legris are very well paired and both outstanding dancers. I agree with the reviewer that said to ""watch his pirouettes"". DuPont is both beautiful, serene, and the most perfect ""Aurora"". Her sense of balance is amazing - no wobbling. One can sense her tremendous athleticism and agility. I highly recommend this performance to anyone regardless of their knowledge or interest in ballet. It's very satisfying.",1170806400,,677,5.108108108108108
2567558,5,B000FII2B6,"Working within a given system an interpreter has the prerogative to insert, or omit, various sections so long as this does not interfere with the integrity of the work as a whole, rather further illuminate its underlying Intention and Potential. By this I mean that Nureyev, having meticulously adhered to the stylistic coherency of the work, allowed his imagination to run free and wild in this absolutely enchanting production of Petipa's master-work.

Long and fruitful has been the rapport between the French and Russian Traditions. The tale of the Sleeping Beauty, by the 17th century auther Charles Perrault was written at a time in history regarded by the French as ""Le Grand Siecle"". The style of the day is rightfully labeled -""Rigueur""- it may be summed up thus: Severity-of-Form aligned with Elegance. Louis XIV insisted that this aesthetic ideal be applied rigorously to all art forms.

Some two hundred years later the French-born Petipa, created a work of unparalleled stylistic purity of form and elegance of manner for the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre, St. Petersbourg, based on the same story. Eighty years later the Russian Nureyev took this notion even further to conceive for the Opera National de Paris a masterpiece of a production that even after 20 years of its creation manages to retain its freshness and relevance in today's swiftly changing world.

Needless to say all aspects of this production are superbly worked-out with meticulous attention to detail. Nureyev proved to be even more fastidious in his undertakings than even the French would have deemed necessary. The general splendor of the dcor and costumes is particularly commendable whilst being enhanced by the brilliant nuances of the Lumieres.

The prologue is of particular grandeur with all the good fairies in attendance bearing good wishes. They dance beautifully, with poise and goodness in their demeanor. Ms. Marie Agnes-Gillot dances with crystal-clear precision and luminance yet is still soft and gentle. Each fairy has her style and all perform with much ease and command. For the French the height of the leg extension is of lesser value than the style and bearing used to get it up there. The whole stage is magically lit up by the presence of the entire court wishing the newborn a happy life.

At this point the ceremony is interrupted by a somewhat overwhelming announcement that the vengeful Carabosse is about to appear. She is a beauty fallen from grace. The mime dialogue that will ensue between the two rival Powers - Carabosse and Fee des Lilas - is brief but spellbinding, so watch closely! Both Powers, Good and Evil, appear convincing and of equal depth. Bravo Nureyev!

...

Hush! Tchaikovsky's music is letting us know that the Divine and unassuming Ms. Aurelie Dupont is about to make her nonchalant entrance as Aurore. She hurries onto the stage with the energy and vivacity of a privileged 16 year old. At once, it is clear: She has lived a happy life; making us all wish that our lives were a fairytale. Needless to say that what I observed from this point on can be summed up with one single word - Beauty. She was the incarnation of it! From this All aspects of her interpretation are uniformly perfect.

""Beauty"" is first and foremost a masterpiece of academic stylistic discipline. It represents the pinnacle of the Style ""Noble"", defining a standard of Pure Form. Any infusion of emotion to the sheer choreographic structural ideal must confine itself to this paradigm. Second to that, the dancer must sparkle within the context of the libretto! (Note that the Great Mr. B, considered this ballet as petipa's masterpeice). Sadly enough many modern choreographers, and dancers, consider the role of Aurore saccharine and effervescent, entirely out of sync. Well, no doubt there are greater issues at hand, this is true, but none of them can be dealt with by performing on stage, even if it is the works of the famous Matz-Ek.

As opposed to other styles of dance, the classical world allows us to dream since it tends towards the Transcendental Ideal. For this, however, we must have great artists. For the performance of the entire Classical repertoire, the Principal is critical.

The vision scene in the second act is of poignant beauty. Petipa's choreography for the corps in this section is splendid with its diagonal symmetry and interweaving effect - it perfectly echoes the music. Plenty of ballottes (they fit perfectly, without seeming heavy), tombes and battements. And of-course the lovely Ms. dupont. Her powers are at their summit here. Gentle, Serene, Unattainable. She is the means through which iridescent visions materialize.

The final act is stupendous! Not only is the grand pas de deux majestically executed by the dazzling etoiles Ms. Dupont and Mr. Legris, but the closure of the production is of monumental proportions. The whole cast ecstatically showcasing the Majesty of the French Tradition. As seen through the eyes of this Uncanny Russian.

2567559,5,B000FII2B6,"Here we have Nureyev's wonderful concept of Sleeping Beauty utilizing the awesome intensity of classical ballet technique as it exists today, something Petipa did not have available to him.  This is quite a long, complete Sleeping Beauty with very few cuts and plenty of additions.  One of the most significant of these additions is the long adagio danced by the Prince in the second act.  The Prince shows us that he is sad by refusing to go hunting with his friends as well as declining to go riding with the women.  He tells the Lilac Fairy that he has been crying because he has no one to give his heart to.  When she informs him that she has just the Princess for him, he expresses his wonderment and excitement of what awaits him by dancing this fantastic adagio(notice the great similarity with similar emotions at the end af act one of Swan Lake with another adagio serving a similar purpose).  It is very appropriate to include this solo, since the Princess has many long solos and we need to see emotion expressed through dance since this is a ballet!  This is far better than the Petipa idea of having the Prince mostly walk around in the second act(in his day, male dancers could do little else!).  All the dancers, both principals and the corps, dance magnificently with razor sharp technique and expressiveness.  The acting and mime are also faultless.  the sets and costumes are very colorful and exciting, as you would expect from the POB.  This DVD is preceeded by another POB Sleeping Beauty documentary DVD(which I have also reviewed) with Platel as the Princess and Legris as the Prince, which is an excellent adjunct to this performance.

The quality of the DVD transfer is superb with wide screen video and Dolby 2.0 stereo sound.",1151712000,,1752,4.7081967213114755

I do wish the courting fellows had more moves, but that isn't the fault of this version it's the way the ballet was written - I just happen to have sons who want to dance, and I'd like more  role models for them.",1508198400,,513,3.970873786407767

8123008,5,B000FII2B6,"I am an untrained amateur who only knows what I enjoy, but I was very impressed with this Paris Opera/Nureyev ballet presentation.  I am a long time fan of classical music but in recent years I have discovered the joy of watching opera and ballet.  This is the second Sleeping Beauty DVD I have bought, and I watched it three times right off.  Of course the music and story are great, deservedly near the top of all time lists.  In this performance the dancing by the principals and corps looks quite crisp to me, the sets and costumes are impressive, and the camerawork and video quality is good.  The other Sleeping Beauty DVD I have is the 1989 Kirov version which is not bad, but for my taste looks less polished and rather drab compared to the Paris performance.

I read the review that said the stage was too full and too busy.  I could see where that was coming from but it did not bother me.  In fact I considered it a plus.  My only complaint is one that applies to almost all ballet performances I have watched, namely the number of times the audience applauds while a dancer takes a bow even after a fairly simple dance pass that only lasts a few seconds.  I would prefer the applause be reserved for the end of a series of variations or the conclusion of major numbers.",1439078400,,1281,4.367088607594937
