This series is educational and cute, and a great addition to any DVD library, loved by preschoolers as well as elementary school aged kids, and even fun and educational for adults!",1522800000,,352,4.693548387096774

8697870,5,B00S9O4JYM,"We love Cat in the Hat! Its silly enough to keep my toddler entertained while learning at the same time. I like getting the series instead of the random episode DVDs, you get a lot more for your money. I would definitely buy this again. We have all 4 of the sets from volume 1. Kids learn about how plants and flowers grow, the colors of the rainbow, microorganisms, etc without getting too in depth (or boring). If you like the DVDs check out the Cat in the Hat learning library series of books too. Episodes in this set include:
Show Me the Honey
Migration Vacation
I Love the Nightlife
Oh Give Me a Home!
Many Ants Make Light Work
Nest Best Thing
A Plan for Sand
Whale Music
Flower Power
Snowman's Land
Dress Up Day
Bath Time
Trees Company
Now You See Me
Rain Game
No SSSweater is Better
A Tale About Tails
Sticky Situation
Night Lights
Go Snails Go!",1484611200,12,853,4.304347826086956

8697872,5,B00S9O4JYM,"Great product with Spanish option available. I do not know why that is not mention in the Amazon description as for us, it is one of the main reasons to buy a movie/show for our children, as we are growing them trilingual in French, English and Spanish.

In addition, Dr. Seuss is always a great choice for entertaining and learning. My toddlers love it!!!",1439683200,,356,4.5625
