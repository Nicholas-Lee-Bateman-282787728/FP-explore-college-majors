8717674,5,B00Y7R9GVG,Another great performance from Warren William. The entire movie is wonderful but watching Mr. William in another of his great acting performances is the main treat.,1533254400,,164,5.346153846153846
8717675,5,B00Y7R9GVG,"This 1932 comedy runs an hour and 14 minutes and stars William Warren and Betty Davis. It is fun and light hearted. Warren is running for office and has to deal with other candidates, the press, and an ex wife. Davis plays his campaign manager and girlfriend. She is young and blond in this early sound picture.

No special features other than the trailer.",1529884800,,356,4.5625
8717676,4,B00Y7R9GVG,"I watched this movie for Bette Davis and, as a role for the actress, it's just okay. She plays the love interest of Warren William, who is hired to be the campaign manager of a dark horse candidate (Guy Kibbee). Complications arise from Williams' ex-wife as she and the rival party try to derail Kibbee's election.

Although Davis' role is minor, the film is funny and moves along at a good pace. It also pokes fun at American elections where the candidate can be incredibly dumb and be elected.",1522454400,,495,4.561797752808989
8717677,5,B00Y7R9GVG,Bette Davis is my favorite movie star of all time - and I want to see everything she left of her work.,1483401600,2,102,3.6818181818181817
8717678,5,B00Y7R9GVG,Hysterical political comedy which is uncannily relevant to this election.,1464048000,,73,6.4
8717679,4,B00Y7R9GVG,"...is the catchall answer that slick campaign manager Warren William suggests to dimwitted gubernatorial candidate Guy Kibbee in Warner Bros. snappy 1933 political comedy THE DARK HORSE. Kibbee is  Zachary Hicks (""Vote For Hicks From The Sticks!"") an unknown delegate that is nominated as a ringer to break a stalemate at the convention. Unfortunately for the Party he's a dim as a bulb, but firecracker secretary Bette Davis has a solution, hire the best campaign manager around, who just happens to be her boyfriend. Warren William is delightful as Hal Blake, a conniving double-talking whitewash artist, that is when he's not in jail for alimony, quoting the speeches of Abraham Lincoln, wooing hard-to-get Bette, dodging his gold-digging double-crossing ex-wife (Vivienne Osborne) or breaking the Mann Act! The always welcome Frank McHugh is also featured as William's sidekick Joe. Made just on the cusp of the Production Code, viewers will get a hoot out of Kibbee playing strip poker with Osborne. The 79-year old film is in amazing condition considering, with limited damage, it looked tremendous on my new 4K Ultra High-Definition set. The made-on-demand Warner Archive disc also contains the original trailer in poor but watchable condition. While they co-starred a few other times, fans need to check out the ultimate William/Kibbee pairing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GOLD-DIGGERS-OF-1933/dp/B001O7YKFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933</a>.....",1448236800,8,1518,5.931506849315069
8717680,1,B00Y7R9GVG,"It has nothing to do directly with this movie but the DVD doesn't play well. Maybe something happened to the master copy of this film which is kind of sad if that's the reason, there's not a mark on the disk, not even one scratch so i was thinking that if maybe i had received a bad copy (glitch) i would want a new one or is it just the movie footage got eroded by time and neglect? Can anybody explain what really happened here? I like to give products good reviews and don't enjoy writing negative ones. Thanks for taking time to read this!
