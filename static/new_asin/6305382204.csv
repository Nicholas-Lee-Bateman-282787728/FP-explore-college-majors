7888364,5,6305382204,"I saw the original movie when released.  I have never again seen that print, only butchered prints that don't care about the film or art, but only about how many commercials can be fit in.

One example.  Jack Warden is magnicifent as his therapist,  but then Jack always is magnicifent.  At one point in the therapy office Jack breaks out in song.  It is the one scene that the entire theater laughed loudest. But it's been cut.  As have other scenes.

Other than that the movie is a classic and  I happen to like the title. Barbara Harris was nominated for Best  Sup. Actress for her performance which was superb.  Hoffman also did a very good job in a multi-layered complex role. Reminds me of Lenny.

Someone said it reminded them of Scorsese's ""criminally-underrated King of Comedy"". Not to me.  It is more mindful of his ""After Hours"" another gem that is set during  the night {and then the day } when those 'night people' come out. Also when crediting someone note Shel Silverstein's brilliance.  It makes sense that this is a classic.

I don't think unintelligent people will understand,
contemplate, or even comprehend this movie or the screenplay.  Not trying to be snobbish but it takes a willing attitude about some abstract thoughts such as (those damn kids. they're marking my time as they age).

Get it?
 I do.",1364428800,,1324,4.678260869565217
7888365,4,6305382204,"This is a great film if you know what you're getting: an introspective study of a songwriter's life falling apart. Is he insane or just childish? Are people after him, or is he his own worst enemy? Those questions are answered by the movie's end. Conventional movie watchers who like action or intense drama will hate this.

""Who IS..."" is for fans of black humor, in movies like ""Harold & Maude"" & ""Slaughterhouse-5"". There is also a similarity to ""A Thousand Clowns."" It reminds me of Martin Scorsese's criminally-underrated ""King of Comedy"". Both main characters travel through reality, delusions & memories with little explanation to the viewer. Hoffman's songwriter seems like a mixture of Bob Dylan & Howard Hughes. Anyone who wants to know, or remembers what NYC looked like in the early '70's will treasure this. Jack Warden has some amazingly funny bits, showing up in various guises. The film is at its best when Dustin is engaged with other actors. It occasionally suffers from long scenes where he is alone, talking to himself. The slow free-fall beginning is classic.

I deduct one star because this is only available on a VHS cassette modified for old TV sets. A widescreen DVD should be released. Also the colors look faded & dull, as if the print was from an old film they used over & over to show on late night TV movies.
Just because this is Hoffman's least-known film, does not mean he phones it in. His acting is at its peak, right up there w/ ""Midnight Cowboy"", ""Lenny"", ""Little Big Man"" & ""Marathon Man"".
If you don't like movies of the mind, don't like Fellini or early '70's black humor... steer clear.",1357084800,2,1626,4.721830985915493
7888366,3,6305382204,"Typical product of the early 70s - talk, talk, talk and relatively little acting or showing.  By today's standards it makes for a cliched, dull and hard to understand film, yet for its time it wasn't too bad.  Hoffman plays Georgie Soloway, a rich and famous songwriter living a lonely, anxiety-ridden life in Manhattan.  He's clearly having a massive midlife crisis, reflecting on all his past failed relationships, watching his father get old, and fearing for his own sanity. On top of that, some guy named Harry Kellerman is calling all his friends and girlfriends and creating problems for him - although it takes quite some time for the viewer to figure out whether ""Harry"" is a real person, or just another figment of Georgie's very rich imagination.  Georgie repeatedly fantasizes about suicide, and between that and his other fantasies and his flashbacks (life passing before his eyes?) and his possible hallucinations from going days without sleep, the viewer is also never quite sure whether Georgie has actually succeeded in offing himself and his ""real life"" is the dream, or whether he's still alive and the suicide is the dream.  Like similar films of its era (""MASH"" and ""Harold and Maude""), suicide is somewhat romanticized - the film seems to be suggesting that we're all going to die in the end anyway so what does it matter when and how we check out? -  and made into a symbol for other types of ""death"", such as the death of one's dreams.

While I realized early on (like in the first couple minutes) that this was supposed to be a dark, fantastic comedy, I got a little tired of having to constantly try to figure out what actually happened in real life, and what was simply being dreamed, particularly during a sequence involving Georgie running into his ex-wife on a skyscraper window ledge that seems potentially symbolic of what might have happened in real life - or it could be just another wacky insomniac dream.  The only part of the film that seems definitely real is Georgie's meeting and date with an aging actress played by Barbara Harris, who (again true to the era) plays a supposedly 34-year-old woman who really looks, wears her hair and makeup, and acts like she is 45.  Even that bright spot doesn't quite work out the way you think or hope it will.

Hoffman's acting is the usual good quality job and he is suitably laid back for the role, but he really doesn't come off like a rich music star.  For one thing, a normal songwriter in that era who could not sleep and was alone all the time would almost certainly have used some drugs, or at least taken a drink, neither of which happens.  For another thing, most of the songs in the film, with the possible exception of the Dr. Hook theme song played at start and finish, are pretty terrible - not the sort that would land their creator on the cover of ""Time"".  We also see very little of Georgie's actual career, other than that he twangs a guitar a lot and has a couple of music-business-type pals.  I half expected to find that Georgie's stellar career was as much a figment as lots of other things, and that he was really back home slaving in his dad's restaurant.

Despite the fact that this is a fairly typical 70s film that some people will probably find brilliant and thoughtful and others will likely find to be the biggest, snooziest waste of film ever, I can see why no one has been rushing to put this out on DVD.  The beginning is disturbing; the scene with the ex-wife is disturbing; and the end is the most disturbing of all and nowadays would probably send a few modern viewers running to see their own shrinks.",1345161600,,3616,4.591614906832298
7888367,5,6305382204,"Who is Harry Kellerman is very very good Dustin Hoffman!  This is more evidence of Dustin Hoffman's performance range and it is entertaining.  Director Ulu Grosbard too deserves more credit.  No Dustin Hoffman movie collection is complete without Who is Harry Kellerman and why is he saying all those terrible things about me.  So, how soon can we have the DVD?  The Objective is Happiness, Tom",1325721600,,394,4.909090909090909
7888368,4,6305382204,"WHO IS HARRY KELLERMAN etc. is typical of its time: trippy, introspective, colorful, melancholy.

The tone is established in an opening shot of composer Georgie Soloway's free-fall from a Manhattan skyscraper. This slow-speed happy faced plummet to the concrete is only one of Georgie's many hallucinations. Schizophrenia may be more accurate.

The film has several themes: the brevity of life, loneliness, fear of failure, celebrity, insomnia, the efficacy of psychotherapy. Although Georgie is very self-involved and caught up in a mystery of who is calling his friends and badmouthing him, he is at times able to get beyond his own baggage and show kindness to others, including a gal he meets at an audition.

It's Allison Densmore's 34th birthday. Her attempt to land the role of a much younger woman ends with a perfunctory ""that's all for now"" from the play's director, but Georgie liked her song and is attracted to Allison. He invites her on a NYC flyover in his private plane and spends a romantic night at Allison's apartment. She confides of having suicidal thoughts upon waking up that morning, yet at the end of this same day is grateful to be alive and feels blessed by Georgie's special birthday present. A rare feel-good moment in a troubling story.

Another joyful sequence is an on-stage performance at the Fillmore East in front of a real concert audience by Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show, vocalist Shel Silverstein and Georgie, who's asked to duet on one of his many hit songs.

Georgie's therapy sessions with Dr. Moses haven't done much good. His marriage ended in divorce some years earlier and those hallucinations seem to be getting worse. In one sequence set at July 4th, the shrink appears as Santa. He's also in Georgie's final daydream, a peaceful mountainside ski scene that's totally unrelated to what is really about to happen.

In this story of partial revelations, at the end we learn just who Harry Kellerman is but not why he's saying those terrible things, how Georgie overcomes insomnia but not why he's afflicted with it, that he's afraid but not what of, and how a man retreats inside a shell of fantasy but not why he does so.

7888369,1,6305382204,"I'm a big Hoffman fan, but this one was a stinker.  A very generic script

with big stereotypes about rock stars, psychiatrists, squares, etc.  Very dated and very dull and boring.  A lot of scenes where they just let the camera roll on and on while nothing is happening and the dialog goes nowhere.  Hoffman's performance is pretty poor, but basically it's not his fault, because there was nothing to work with and I don't know what the point was.  I turned it off halfway thru b/c it was too pathetic to watch.",1178928000,,512,4.451612903225806
7888370,4,6305382204,"This movie captures the essence of the hippie era - a wandering through a vaguely hallucinatory landscape of soul-searching and finding oneself. It's a reflection on the disappointments of success. Although the title of the film and this unformed subject matter may put some people off, this is actually quite a trip, man.

In addition to being an engaging blast from the past, there are two things in this film that make it an unforgettable must-see. The first thing is Barbara Harris' performance. Her gentle, falling-leaf reconciliation with the fact that neither she nor any woman is likely to have the romance that was the stuff of all their dreams - is one of the best, most heart-wrenching scenes ever captured on film. Barbara Harris may not have won the Academy Award, but she wins silver-screen immortality with this portrayal.

The second reason to check out this movie is the music - especially the closing song sequence that's a collaborative effort between Shel Silverstein and Dr. Hook (the band). That trailing refrain, ""This is the Last Morning"" is all of us trailing off into the dying of all our dreams. It's a great and sad song. But it's all right, man. It's the journey that counts.",1145750400,4,1204,4.839805825242719
7888371,4,6305382204,"This is a rather bizarre film, unlike any other I've ever seen, but I love it. Dustin Hoffman shines as Georgie Solloway, a Paul Simon-esque songwriter who is finding his tremendous financial success increasingly unfulfilling. His lack of happiness, lack of sleep, and lack of real friends has him talking to himself and thinking he's crazy. And he may well be, since his conversations with his therapist (the always excellent Jack Warden) seem to be mostly hallucinatory. Hoffman appears in nearly every second of the film, and his performance is a tour de force. Some of the film's 'hip' dialogue has aged poorly, but the soundtrack is great, and by and large the movie is an undiscovered treat from director Ulu Grosbard, who didn't make another picture for six years (""Straight Time,"" also starring Hoffman). Look for Dom DeLuise in a small, early part as Hoffman's accountant, and especially for Barbara Harris' fantastic portrayal of a would-be singer who knows that she has probably aged past most of her schoolgirl dreams. She was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for this role, and deservedly so. She would lose out to Cloris Leachman (""The Last Picture Show""), but she gives one heck of a performance.",1137542400,7,1216,4.995073891625616
7888372,5,6305382204,"Barbara Harris gives her best performance in the audition scene. The veteran actor was never so vunerable, so delightful and so beautiful.  Hoffman played fantastically to her tenderness.  And Gabe Dell,so many years ago and the Dead End Kids and in this movie, a swinger. Doesn't the man ever age, whatever the guy is eating and drinking, let me know. It took me about 15 years before I found a tape and now it's #1 on my list.  I feel very fortunate to have it. Hell, I even liked Dom and that's going the whole nine yards.  Great show to watch on a dark and stormy night.",1006214400,7,574,4.336448598130841
