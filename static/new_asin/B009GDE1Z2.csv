8541183,5,B009GDE1Z2,"Ok;  when i bought this box, i hardly knew AKB48.  I knew 2 or 3 singles but they were in my opinion interesting enough to try a complete concert (in fact 3 concerts).  This one did not disappoint al all. These girls are so full of energy. Their performance is to say the least  fantastic.  Their songs are catching. Highlights: the first day is filled with their hitsingles so far. In the first half of the second day lots of performers get a chance to perform in small groups (2 to 5 persons) so they can present themself  and show their talents to the audience. Hightlight of the second half of the second day is the duet performed bij Atsuko Maeda and Minami Takahashi after which Minami gets  awarded a chance for het own carreer as a singer. Her tears of joy are plentifull and very real. Just as real as her tears of sorrow, the third day, at the end of the graduation song of Atsuka Maeda (Yume no kawa, which has become  one of my favourite songs). It is touching and moving to see 9 girls accompanying Atsuka Maeda  in her graduation performance, fighting against their tears, mostly without success. This is one of the things that makes  a performance of AKB48 kind of special. More than once one can witness  an ambundance of emotion on the stage, not acted but deeply felt,  all the way. Add to this the professional  camera work  and editing  and the result is an astounding  concert, and yes, i admit, with a considerable pricetag  but certainly worth it.",1490918400,,1470,4.466165413533835
