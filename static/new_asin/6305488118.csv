7890449,5,6305488118,"Very interesting documentary, though you'll have to dust down your old VHS player to watch it.

What I found particularly interesting is that Kennedy, in the years following his brothers assassination, undertook some deep, deep soul searching, particularly when deliberating about whether he should run for President.

A tragic loss.",1327363200,,333,5.64
7890450,5,6305488118,"Ostenibly based on Jack Newfield's book, this video is an exhaustive and wonderful look back at a man who had his life cut too, too short. As I write this, Robert Kennedy would've been 78 years old today, but he was cut down in his prime, just as he was on the cusp of greatness. No finer tribute to the man can be found than this almost two-hour long film. I heartily recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in the legacy of Bobby Kennedy and what he means to America. In this age of fairweather patriots and scoundrels in the highest corridors of power, Bobby Kennedy's place in history is more as a guide for the future, not a dusty rememberance of the past.",1069286400,3,673,4.307086614173229

7890452,5,6305488118,"This is a fantastic movie about RFK!!! BUY THIS MOVIE ABSOLUTELY!! After watching this, you will really understand Rfk. It's extremely complete and you can see him at all ages. There is a very rare part when he's young, but you see him during his hole life. They speak a little too much about civil rights or the cuban missiles crisis, but it's normal.",1055635200,2,352,4.515625
7890453,5,6305488118,"This is a wonderful documentary.  It allows us to get to know Robert Kennedy, the man.  He wasn't perfect, nor should he be thought of in that light.  However, he was a good man.  He contained the capacity to grow, to change his thoughts and perceptions.  It wasn't calculated or expedient, but true inner change.  The man he became after his brother was killed stands out as the man we should remember.  He was still a good man before JFK's assassination, but he became more thoughtful, caring and empathetic afterwards.  I just hated the fact that this documentary had to come to its inevitable conclusion.",974246400,9,608,4.723809523809524
7890454,5,6305488118,"Robert Kennedy was better than a great man.  He was a good man and a deeply serious and committed man.  He was also a very interesting man.
In  1963, Robert Kennedy was forced to come into his own.  Facing the tragic  aftermath of his brother's death, the then Attorney General had to  recognize his own identity, interests and needs.  During his tenure as  Attorney General and as tireless campaign worker for President Kennedy,  Robert Kennedy often sublimated his own needs and identity and pushed his  brother's agenda forward.
Once Robert Kennedy confronts himself, he  seriously undertakes the task of educating himself.  He becomes well versed  in classical literature and immersed in Civil Rights issues.  In following  his growth and development, one can almost see the changes taking place  within his thinking.  He becomes a much stronger voice, a much more visible  face and a man to be taken very seriously.  Robert Kennedy does indeed  present a sincere image and it is the opinion of this reviewer that he was  sincere and dedicated in his efforts towards Civil Rights goals.
In  listening to his speeches, one gets the feeling that the man really cares.  His emotions rise to the top of each word and his physical motions match  his expressions.  He is a symbol of hope to many.  He is a man who has met  and set personal goals and who is a voice of encouragement as well.  He is  the man who, in 1965 climed Mt. Kennedy in Canada out of love for his  deceased brother.  Robert Kennedy, the acrophobe, the man who many  described as being nervous on a balcony tabled his terror and climbed that  mountain.  This underscores his deep commitment and determination.  The man  who climbed that mountain faced other major challenges and rose to them  admirably.
Robert Kennedy was truly a good man. His death left a gaping  void in history.  One is always left with the question of what events would  have taken place had this man lived.  He left an indelible stamp on  history.
Once he came into his own, Robert Kennedy was a force to be  reckoned with.",967420800,8,2065,4.698591549295775
