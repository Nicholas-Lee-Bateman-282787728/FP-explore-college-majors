8316593,5,B001KZBK6C,Marsden Hartley is a fascinating subject for this beautifully executed film.  His artwork is stunning and this film shares it up-close like never before.,1495843200,,153,5.375
8316594,5,B001KZBK6C,"Visible Silence: Marsden Hartley Painter and Poet, a visually beautiful and passionately written and narrated essay by Michael Maglaras, honoring the mastery of American Modernist Marsden Hartley, is itself masterfully presented.
The beautiful music that accompanies the narrator in selected natural and urban settings offers the viewer an uplifting experience while listening, and while viewing some of Hartley's breathtaking paintings.
It is very obvious that Michael Maglaras loves Hartley's work, as he does writing and filmmaking,  and he naturally shares these loves with the audience.
I highly recommend this film.",1440374400,,621,5.9
8316595,5,B001KZBK6C,"This was a wonderful film.  It totally left me with a great understanding, and appreciation for this mans work. It is not often to be so moved with this kind of documentary.  I will have this film and its incredible storytelling with me for years to come.  Thank you. I will recommend this to others.",1363392000,,300,4.418181818181818
8316596,2,B001KZBK6C,"This film has some value with information about Marsden Hartley, the man and the artist. But unfortunately the huge ego of the filmmaker gets in the way. Somehow the film ends up being about him and not the artist. Since he directed the film, he has given himself ample camera time. The camera stays focused on the filmmaker as he lectures the audience (sometimes for several long minutes!). Instead, we could have seen more of Marsden Hartley's artwork (sadly very few of his work are shown in this film). The filmmaker should be commended for taking on the task but he ruined the film by turning it into a long lecture and making questionalbe and not very well researched pontifications. Case in point: Marsden Hartley was a Nazi Sympathizer!! If you must see this film, just rent it.",1293148800,,786,4.702898550724638
