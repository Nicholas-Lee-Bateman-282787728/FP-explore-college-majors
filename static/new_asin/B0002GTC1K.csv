8027935,5,B0002GTC1K,"Paradise Canyon isn't one of John Wayne's more memorable early westerns, but it is something of a hoot to watch. In this film, Wayne plays a lawman who goes to work undercover with a traveling medicine show in an effort to catch a gang of counterfeiters along the Mexican border. The good doctor, whose fabulous Indian elixir is 90% alcohol, served time for counterfeiting a few years earlier when his ""partner"" turned states' evidence and set him up for the fall, so Wayne's character starts his investigation there. Yakima Canutt plays the bad guy, and Marion Burns fills the role of Dr. Carter's daughter. There's not as much riding, shooting, and fisticuffs as you normally find in these old Lone Star Productions films, but Paradise Canyon does feature a vintage medicine show with singing, sharp-shooting, and ardent hawking of Dr. Carter's Indian Remedy, good for anything that ails you. There's plenty here for John Wayne fans to enjoy, but Paradise Canyon is by no means his best early picture.

Randy rides alone; heck, he's John Wayne, and John Wayne can take care of himself. In this Lone Star Pictures 1934 production, he does make a couple of mistakes early on, though. First, he wears a black hat - this has nothing to do with what happens, but it just doesn't seem like a good idea for a good guy to be wearing a black hat. Second, he decides to do a little investigating on his own when he walks into the Halfway House and finds everyone inside dead. This opening scene is really quite memorable. Nobody bled from gunshot wounds in the 1930s, of course, but there is a mysterious someone behind the wall using the old ""holes in the eyes of the picture"" ruse to watch Randy as he looks around, giving the scene a nice little creepy touch. Randy is arrested for the murders, of course, but it's really Marvin Black (""master of disguise"" Gabby Hayes) and his gang of desperadoes who are responsible. Spunky Sally Rogers (Alberta Vaughn) refuses to reveal the location of her uncle's stash in the Halfway House to the bad guys, and she also doesn't fall for the shenanigans of Matt the Mute when he tries to buy the joint from her, putting herself in great danger. Randy manages to get out of jail (secretly, of course), accidentally runs into Marvin Black's gang in their secret hideout, and puts his wily do-gooder mind to work in an effort to nail the bad guys, save the day, and get the girl. This is an early movie made five years prior to Stagecoach, but it definitely shows us flashes of The Duke as America and most of the rest of the world would come to know and love him.",1127520000,,2594,4.5905172413793105
