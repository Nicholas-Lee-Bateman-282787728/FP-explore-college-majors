1050156,5,6305535191,"It's a pleasure (and not a guilty one) to see this quirky rollicking 90s sleeper finally done right on DVD.  Co-written by director Dubin (himself a member of the wacky rock ensemble The Stoned) and Ric Menello (co-author of 2009's best American flick, Two Lovers), DDR treads the well-worn tracks of filmdom's teen 101 safety net plot:  the misadventures of an aspiring R `N R group, but does so as no previous entry has ever done.  Its sharp, satiric and even brutal comedic approach/attack on the music industry recalls the vitriolic quill of George Axelrod (Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?; Lord Love a Duck).  Imagine Bob Clampett, Tex Avery, Friz Freleng and Frank Tashlin forming a garage band, and you have an idea of what an animated version might be like.  Had it been made two decades earlier, and across the pond, it might have been Carry On Rocking - and I can think of no higher praise!",1259884800,2,900,4.670886075949367

Here's a short synopsis of Drop Dead Rock with some more information:

Drop Dead Rock stars '80's music icons Adam Ant and Deborah Harry. This film festival favorite played the art house circuit when it premiered in 1995. It was written by Ric Menello and Adam Dubin, the creators of the Beastie Boys classic music video Fight For Your Right To Party. Drop Dead Rock was directed by Adam Dubin who recently directed comedian Lewis Black's concert film Stark Raving Black.

""I wanted to make a 60's movie about an 80's rock star in the 90's,"" said Dubin.

Drop Dead Rock is a no holds barred, rock and roll comedy. A down and out, rock n' roll band, Hindenburg, kidnap their favorite British rock star, Spazz-O, and hold him hostage. The problem is, Spazz-O's ex-porn star wife Holly Everest (Playboy lingerie model Chelsey Parks) and his back-stabbing manager, Dave Donovan (Adam Ant), can't wait to get their hands on his fortune, and have hired a hitman to do him in. Thanks to a media feeding frenzy, Spazz-O's career is hotter than ever. Enter media mogul Thor Sturmundrang (Deborah Harry) with a big advance check. Now Spazz-O is worth more alive than dead. Dave must outwit the bumbling band, clumsy cops, ruthless record execs and terrifying terrorists to get his just reward. Drop Dead Rock explodes in a comic free for all.

""The film is good. I can't tell you how much it made me laugh doing it,"" said Ant. ""I still laugh now just thinking about it. It's kind of like a 90's Spinal Tap.""

Film Threat predicted, ""Drop Dead Rock is destined for late night cult status and instant success in the video market.""",1259798400,2,2183,4.625322997416021
1050158,3,6305535191,"I bought this movie becuase I love anything Adam Ant is in. I would only recommend this movie to someone in the same catagory as the acting in this one stinks. Debbie Harry is an excellent example of musicians who should not cross over into acting with her aweful portrayal of a music mogul trying to buy into the latest music craze. For anyone who just loves to watch Adam Ant act or see what a bad movie looks like, this is the one for you.",1023062400,,442,4.151162790697675
1050159,4,6305535191,"Admittedly, you'd have to be either a huge fan of either Debbie Harry (like me:) or Adam Ant to even contemplate renting this movie, let alone buying it, but if you ARE said biased fan, you're gonna love this! Drop Dead Rock is a bizarre tale of a downright awful band who can't get started in the music industry. So, they kidnap a British rock star (as you do!), who they can force to listen to their music and get them fixed up with a record contract. Of course the kidnapping all goes wrong and leads to all kinds of crazy chaos. Adam Ant is very amusing as a band-manager-type, and Deborah Harry is absolutely fabulous as the sharp, sexy, mean head of a record company who is also attending Alcoholics Anonymous sessions...DDR is very colourful, very loud and very camp. It's funny, stupid and a tad, er, gruesome in parts. Watch it for Adam Ant being evil, and Debbie Harry showing her stockings and suspenders. Just don't take it seriously!! :)",992044800,2,950,4.52906976744186
1050160,3,6305535191,"If you have any vague fondness for weird, British 80s bands, don't miss this. A major chance to letch at the Ant King himself! ;)
Besides that,  the movie has quite an interesting plot. A bunch of mildly stupid kids want  to show off their band to a now-faded British punk-rocker (wait and  see! :)) They kidnap him but nothing quite goes to plan... Oh, and see who  *else* you can spot in a cameo.
Almost Wayne's World-esque in it's  humour, it's worth a look at in anyone's money!:)",965865600,,484,4.393258426966292

7891893,4,6305535191,"This movie is pretty bad, but from what I understand I think it is supposed to be (like the crazy British 60's movies, like Lord Love a Duck).  The acting is close to horrendous, perhaps on purpose, but it has Adam Ant in it, so that makes it worth watching!  From what I've read, Adam wrote the songs for the movie, but he doesn't sing them.  They are instead reserved for the character Spazz-O, a washed up rock star, managed by  Ant's character.  There is a long, gratuitous silicone boob shot, if you are so inclined.  Not memorable, but it has some silly and slapstick moments for sure, especially with Spazzo-O gulping down drugs like candy (a satiric take on over indulgence in the rock world).  Debbie Harrry plays a small part, and there is a cameo by Joey Ramone, and others-so be on the lookout!",1379116800,,806,4.47945205479452

If you like John Waters pre Hollywood.  If you think Romero's Night of the Living Dead is the best damn horror movie ever... if you were the weird kid at school...  if modern culture makes you want to vomit... I present this for your attention.  It's neither as funny or clever as it thinks it is but it cheered me up no end.",1361059200,3,489,4.329670329670329

If your given a choice to either watch this piece of **** or brush your teeth with a chainsaw, get the toothpaste ready.",1290470400,,371,4.225352112676056
7891897,5,6305535191,"A lot of big laughs in this film, especially whenever Spazz-O is on screen. He's a riot and reminds me of Gordon Ramsey in ""Hell's Kitchen."" He's just brutal and mean and a real jerk - and hilarious. Overall, the whole film feels like a live-action cartoon with crazy action and sound effects - all of which is a good thing. Who would've imagined that a band named ""Hindenburg"" would go down in flames and have to resort to kidnapping?",1260057600,,435,4.45
