4496607,5,B004XQO8KA,"This was televised late one night a couple of years ago, and I enjoyed it immensely.  Not a great film, but fun for all sorts of reasons.  Myrna Loy is a doll as always and Baer was surprisingly good--very charming even when misbehaving, and giving some clue why so many people who knew Baer liked him and were offended by Ron Howard's hatchet job on Baer in his ""Cinderella Man"" film about Jimmy Braddock (who fought Baer).  Baer was not a great actor by any means, a bit mechanical the way you'd expect an amateur to be, but effective when necessary, and he does a great tap dance number with a chorus line that is just terrific!  The film ends with a lengthy ""bout"" against Primo Carnera, which is filmed before Baer and Carnera actually fought for the title in reality.  The filmed version is as wild as the real bout was, though the result is a bit different. (Primo was the champ then--they couldn't get him if he was going to get creamed in the script!)",1197244800,4,960,4.401129943502825
4496608,5,B004XQO8KA,"This is an excellent movie, I don't understand why the studio won't release it again. When they do release it again, buy it up, you won't be sorry. Myrna Loy is as beautiful as ever, just great to look at. I won't spoil it for you, but you will like it.",1149465600,12,253,3.980392156862745

8447313,5,B004XQO8KA,"I was not sure that I would like Myrna Loy without her best sidekick, William Powell but I confess that I did. This was a very good movie and I enjoyed it very much. Myrna Loy can certainly stand alone in the acting business. She was cute, beautiful and did an outstanding job and I enjoyed her and the movie thoroughly. I had never watched a 'fighting' movie before and found it most interesting. Max Baer was new to me but I thought he did a fine job. He was very appealing and cute, too. It was nice to see all of those fighters in the movie. I especially liked the gowns that Myrna Loy wore. It is a pleasure to watch these older movies that I previously missed. All in all, it was a fun evening with a very entertaining movie. I think Myrna Loy is one of the best even without my great favorite William Powell.",1439510400,2,815,4.1645569620253164
8447314,4,B004XQO8KA,"This is very early Myrna Loy, before her ""Thin Man"" role breakthrough, and an extra treat awaits as Heavyweight Champ, Max Baer takes on the role of a prizefighter.  Ms. Loy is, of course, the lady who is really a gangster's moll.  Also starring in this great film are Walter Huston, Primo Carnera and Jack Dempsey.  If the fight game is one of your favorite things, this film is a must!",1430092800,,387,4.422535211267606
8447315,5,B004XQO8KA,"This is a great film about prize fighters with actual fighters in it. Quality 'film' from Hollywoods ""Golden Age."" Predictable plot but it is SOMETHING that you and the grandkids can watch w/o embarrassment.",1424908800,,207,5.117647058823529

8447317,5,B004XQO8KA,"Although the plot is simple, true boxing fans with appreciate the clips with some of the great classic boxers speaking.  Max Baer's Dance Routine on stage with props and dancers is worth the price of the DVD.  The boxing footage, although staged, provides  a  realistic experience of what it was like during that time period.  - Very entertaining !",1407110400,2,348,4.830508474576271

8447319,4,B004XQO8KA,"Just got to say this is one of my favorite Myrna Loy movies. And I have seen her in a lot of movies! She really carries her weight with this early film. I have owned a copy of Prizefighter for many years on Laserdisc. I was VERY excited to see Warner released it on DVD (sorta). This one of those ""burned"" DVD-Rs that Warner puts little movies on. I have several from Warner and Columbia that look amazing! But Warner did not clean up the print they used for Prizefighter. There is slices, scratches, debris abundant on this version. It looks like a film print was used because you can see the spots in upper right corner before reel change. Warner has restored many older films from the '30s and there is no excuse for not cleaning up this movie. The detail is really good compared to the fuzzy Laserdisc, but it could look better. It is extremely sad that most of Myrna Loy's film from the Warner vault are on these DVD-Rs. The Thin Man collection and the Powell/Loy set are the pressed movies and they look great!!
These Warner Archive series discs should not be sold at such high prices when most of these are not restored or cleaned up.
Would love to see Warner put a set of Loy's DVD-Rs in a collection like they did Jean Harlow. If there was an actress deserving of a box set it would be Myrna Loy. Her 'little' films seem to be her best.
All in all, Prizefighter and the Lady is worthy to be in any film lover's DVD collection. It is a sure winner!",1341878400,4,1456,4.278985507246377
8447320,5,B004XQO8KA,"This movie is incredible.  For boxing fan its a must.  We see Max Baer act, dance, box and best of all, being himself.  We also see Primo Carnera, who at the time (1933) was the actual Champion of the World, figt Baer. There the fight ends in a draw, and everybody is happy. The uncanny event is that a year after the movie was filmed (1934)Baer and Carnera fought in real life for the Heavyweight Championship and Baer won by knocking out Carnera.
The film is supported by excellent acting by Mirna Loy and Walter Houston... and yes, Jack Dempsey is in it too.",1206230400,7,561,4.375
