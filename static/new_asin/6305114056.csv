Some of the music videos are pretty basic by todays standards. On the other hand some also have that mini movie feel that MTV spurned. Some fall somewhere in between, but one thing is constant, Fher and lots of pretty  women. Case in point is ""Como te Deseo"" with it's abundance of young women in skimpy bathing suits on the beach or in the hot tub..........es muy caliente! The use of exotic shooting locales gives many of the videos a musical travelogue feel. The videos that follow a ""story line"" are quite cool and visuall captivating. The sepia toned ""Te llore un rio"" is exquisite. Besides the usual fare there are a few different videos including a rare 1994 live performance from  Montreaux,Switzerland . Fher performs one of my favorite songs by the late great Mexican singer/composer Jose Alfredo Jimenez entitled ""El Rey."" It is awesome to see Fher doning the mariachi sombrero  abroad and interacting with the crowd . Fher does  his best Bob Marley call and response  ala ""Oh -yo-Oh-yo - Oh--yo yo."" The intimate conversations on ""Fool in the Rain "" reveal some insights into their influences in rock with their tribute to Led Zepplin. There are fifteen hits here including the more recent ""Clavado en un bar"" which utilizes a behind the scenes camera angle introduction to the video. Winding out this colection is  the ever popular ""En el  muelle de San Blas"" with it's simple, natural beauty. Did I mention all the lovely ladies in all the videos? Recommended for fans of Mana,  including non-Spanish speakers and those that appreciate the beauty of women.",1035244800,,1713,4.799319727891157
7884849,5,6305114056,This video is great and it really has a good view you could see each video clearly and I recomend it to all Mana lovers. Mana is my favorite spanish rock group and they rock. Ther songs are all cool and some are beautiful and have a very nice message. To me all Mana songs remind me about my boyfriend Antonio and that's one of the many reason I like Mana.,1026259200,,356,4.028169014084507
