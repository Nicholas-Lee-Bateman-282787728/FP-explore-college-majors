8755798,5,B01DEQ92PA,"Anyone know if the Percy Jackson movies are getting a 4K UHD w/HDR (e.g. Dolby Vision, HDR10, etc.) upgrade??  Love these movies and would love to have them upgraded to 4K with HDR supported.  Several scene's are dark and washed out, almost un-viewable of all its scene detail in the 1080p version -- but a good HDR version should correct that issue.  Like it did for the Harry Potter movies. :)",1532736000,,395,4.535211267605634

8755804,5,B01DEQ92PA,"This is a very good movie for middle schoolers.  The movie is very well done and will grab their interest and attention.  The ""Percy Jackson"" book series by Rick Riordan upon which the movie is based are even better.  My 6th grade grandson said the book(s) was the only way he has gotten to learn about Greek Gods.  As a retired English teacher, I loved that statement.  These are fun to read for all ages!",1485129600,,406,4.36
