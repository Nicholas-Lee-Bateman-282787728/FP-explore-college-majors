This is a good Dvd BUT the video quality isn't that great and the top left picture isn't in the Dvd though :( I will say if you're a fan of Czw and wanna see the old school days then pick this one up, it also features one of the scariest fire incident in deathmatch wrestling. Lobo was thrown through a flaming table covered in barbed wire, knocking him silly and the crew members pulled him out before he caught on fire! Very scary. If you love deathmatches and fire in wrestling, then this is for you :) as I said the only negative is the video quality everything else is awesome :)",1367971200,,643,4.193548387096774

8284040,2,B001BP14QM,"Disclaimer - This is not intended to be a review of CZW in general (it has put on several great shows over the years), but rather a review of this one particular DVD.

Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) is one of the (what seems like hundreds) independent wrestling organizations based along the east coast of the US.  Although they do have a fairly interesting history, basically it was one of the ""extreme"" wrestling organizations that rose from the ashes of ECW.  It is a bit unfair to characterize them as a total ""hardcore"" organization (since many of their matches feature basic wrestling), but, In the end, what CZW is best know for are its ""ultraviolent"" matches.  Ultraviolent wrestling, much like the name implies, are basically really violent wrestling matches (light tubes, staple guns, weed whackers, etc...).  The theme of this DVD is ""fire"" and features 3 ultraviolent matches that involve lighting things on fire.

The whole problem I have is that this turns out to be nothing more than a glorified stunt show.  Where as ECW (and other organizations) used extreme matches as a way of telling a story in the ring - CZW basically just uses them on this DVD to be violent.  The wrestling, by far and away secondary to throwing a guy (who has a dollar bill stapled on his forehead) through a lit on fire folding table, is about 2 shades beyond horrible.  There's no story being told here, nothing to suck me in other than seeing what can be done to a human body under the guise of ""wrestling"".

That being said, I will admit this DVD (and ultraviolent wrestling) is going to appeal to many people.  If you want to see ""extreme"", this is for you.  Plus, the wrestlers featured are, how should I say this, unique to say the least - Wifebeater (a guy who wears jeans and, normally - you guessed it, a wife beater t-shirt), Pondo (a pudgy dude with a mullet), Lobo (a garden gnome who moved on to wrestling), Zandig (the actual founder/owner of CZW), some effeminate guy named Lord Everett DeVore (complete with a French Revolution wig and powder).  Won't see many of those guys on your next ROH purchase or WWE PPV.  Overall, I would suggest you pass on this release and check out [...] and get a full CZW show if you want to see what this company has to offer.  Seeing nothing but ultraviolent matches left me feeling more depressed than anything else.",1227916800,2,2355,4.613908872901678
