6720481,5,B00O5A099S,"Emotionally and intellectually rewarding indie film.
Its pace is slow, contemplative and peaceful. No one dies, no graphic sex, no coming out teen angst, no bullying or dissention, just the focus of two boys who are in love.

The word gay is never said. We never even see a passionate kiss, but we don't need to.

The film is composed of long, lingering close-ups and mediums shots, and much of the emotion is conveyed through visual metaphor.

One wonderful shot we see only hands, gently touching, fingers caressing, no dialog, none is needed, and it would be redundant.

Dialog and background music are kept to a minimum, instead, natural surrounding sounds are used in combination with striking composition; very reminiscent of the great French auteur, Robert Bresson.

Much of what is felt is left to our imagination, and its much richer than anything that could be explicitly shown, because its a feeling unique and special only to us.

Last Summer is a true work of art, and if you are patient, it will move you deeply.

Highest possible recommendation.",1418083200,49,1060,4.888268156424581

6720505,4,B00O5A099S,"I'm giving this four rather than five stars only because this film is not for everyone. Perhaps because of its style, perhaps the fact it includes gay characters, or whatever. Please read on....

This is an art house piece. It is intentionally slow, contemplative, and deeply emotional. If you don't want to sit still and observe and feel, if don't want to absorb rather than just watch, if you don't want to deal with emotions that aren't spelled out in dialogue... then you will not like this film and should not waste your time on it.

This is literally the ""last summer"" these boys have after high school before they go their separate ways. It is the essence of a peaceful summer, but the emotional pain, and turmoil of relationships, are always under the surface. The film -is- the characters taking in a deep breath of these summer days and trying to hold it all in. They try to soak up every aspect of everything around them, because they know it will never be the same once this summer ends. They try to understand the life they currently have, and come to accept that everything about their relationships will change. This includes dealing with family relationships, what we want as individual people, and that our role in life is not always the way we personally want it to be. The characters are genuinely uncertain what steps to take in life or if the decisions they've made are the right ones. If you didn't experience that after high school, or at some other pivotal point in your life, don't watch this film.

Anyone giving this film a bad review didn't read the existing reviews before watching. Had they looked at reviews first, they wouldn't have watched it, and therefore would not have given it any review, let alone a poor one. They are objecting to the very elements that make this film what it is. They were never the intended audience.

To address a comment in other reviews, there is little dialogue. This film has the least possible dialogue to capture exactly what needs to be said. Nothing more, nothing less. Action, emotion, and meaning in film can be, and often are, completely independent from dialogue. (""The Artist"" has almost no true dialogue and it won five Oscars. 007 and mission-impossible-style action sequences have no dialogue. They're not supposed to.) The touch of a hand, a peaceful breath taken in unison, these things have meaning. If you need dialogue, go to a play or watch a filmed play. Do not watch this movie.

One review said the film had constant 'elevator' music, though I think they meant 'muzak'. Regardless, this film does -not- have -any- elevator music nor muzak, nor even any orchestral music. It has lots of nature sounds, ambient noise, and a lesser portion of single-piano music-- all of which are clearly intentional to the extent that they are almost a character themselves. They are essential to the mood of the film.

One review noted a lack of action. This is small town life, not a video game. Realistic action will be the things we do every day. Some may not believe it, but the vast majority of life doesn't involve an iPod, and doesn't involve overt interaction. Some would say a defining characteristic of great love is simply being together, without words or action required to express depth of emotion. And this, placed within the context of a story, can have limitless meaning and/or visual impact. The experience of life is about 'being.' If you don't know what I mean by this, don't watch this film.

Is the future worse because it's different? Do our future experiences have more value just because our current life is made of experiences that are over? Do people have objectively different value because they are not the same? Of course not, but did you never have these questions in your life or experience that doubt? Is this film bad because it's not like ""Bridesmaids"" or ""Schindler's List""? Of course not. People like ""Bridesmaids"" even though, or because, it is brain dead, simply entertainment that allows you to unplug your brain. There are lots of times that is exactly what we need; we don't expect the movie to be educational or thought provoking. People like ""Schindler's List"" specifically because it has drama, history, thought, and emotion; we aren't disappointed because there was no pie in the face nor celebrity cameos.

If this review describes a film you might like, then you will probably be thinking about the visuals, the words, the emotions, and the sounds for several days after watching it. If not, you'll probably be ready to turn it off after five minutes.

[Completely as a side note, the two primary characters are gay boyfriends, even though the movie has nothing to do with that fact. The movie is about growth, emotion, and change. There -are- shirtless scenes. But there is -no- sex shown nor even implied. The fact that the characters are gay is nearly irrelevant. The movie is not about being gay, not about personally coming to terms with it, not about coming out, and not about the challenges that two out gay teenagers could experience in a small town. The exact same roles, without any change to action, meaning, or dialogue, could be played by boyfriend/girlfriend instead. This aspect of the film is in fact the only obstacle for me. I find it extremely difficult to imagine a small town anywhere in the US, or even any part of the world that I have seen, where out gay teenagers would not experience at least some negative impact, or difficultly with family or community accepting them. This is the only part that required suspension of disbelief.]",1521244800,3,5573,4.760869565217392
6720506,1,B00O5A099S,"Director's first movie and it showed. It felt like a student film.  The director spent so much focus on making sure every scene was beautifully shot that he forgot to tell a story.  He also worked very hard at illustrating how boring it was in this town for these characters but the result was a boring film.  However, I can't fairly say if the movie was good or not because after 20 minutes I had to shut the film off.  I sense this director did well in film school in cinematography class but failed his story telling class.  Like one of his lead characters in the film, this director should go back to summer school and learn how to tell a story.",1517616000,,649,4.286885245901639
6720507,5,B00O5A099S,"This film has a lot of long quiet ""artistic"" shots that would normally bore me to tears but somehow work in this context. It is a perfect love story and by that, I mean a story about perfect love that is really well executed. There's no way you can't empathize with these two characters and it handles the radically changed perception of gays that has occurred in America in recent years, even in a small town very realistically. Great Movie!",1517270400,,442,4.5375

6720511,2,B00O5A099S,This is a slow moving film. Acting was fine. Directing was artistic. The problem is that there is hardly any story. The kids are spending their last loving summer together before one of them is going off to a school away from their small town. Not much more than that and we watch how they spend the summer with the thought that they will miss each other soon.,1508976000,,360,4.3088235294117645
6720512,1,B00O5A099S,"Good Lord, this was painful.  I agree with another viewer, a short film trying to make a movie.  Yes the opening should have gave me a clue, so long just showing colors and textures.  I like artistic movies once in a while but this was just utter crap.  The whole movie was a series of long scenes of nothing.  I'll give an example.  They showed the 2 boys feet as they lay in bed.  Several minutes with their feet moving occasionally.  That's either a director that is full of themselves or just clueless.  The scenes that did have dialogue was painful to watch.  I think the actors as bad as they were, were probably bad because they didn't believe the dialogue either.  I guess I have to write more review in the hopes that Amazon will stop sending me these recommended movies.  It's not that intuitive.  I've actually watched 5 minutes of movies and turned it off because it was so bad, yet I get emails from Amazon asking me how I liked it?  You can't tell by the fact I didn't watch it, lol.  Anyway, I stuck it out because of the reviews I read.  I should have read more of the reviews before watching this.  The 5 stars must be people wanting other people to suffer through this movie like they did.

I wish gay men would stop trying to artistic and just tell a good story. This might have been a good short film but all the extended scenes ( a minute of just holding hands - I got it, they're in love, move on ). This is one of those cases where less would have been more.

6720518,5,B00O5A099S,"Straight from the opening scenes we are set-up for a thoughtful, visual, and almost tactile treat  that's what we get.

I read some reviews to help focus my own thoughts and I can understand the one-star critics. Everything they say is true, in a way. The only analogy I can think of is to say that Last Summer is a lot like meditating. The very act is about focusing on breathing. suspending expectations, with the senses and the mind traveling wherever they will. If you can ease into the experience, which is rich, sweet and palpable, this movie is truly stunning. Anything else will feel like frustration and tedium. I'm sorry for the one-star's in a way. They just weren't ready for it. Their loss.

Mark Thiedeman (writer/director) and David Goodman (cinematographer) are a match. It looks like they have worked on other projects and after this, I want to see them. That's about the highest compliment I can pay.",1493424000,2,918,4.725

This could have been a much more enjoyable film under a different director.

I picked it up 8 months later and watched it again, and enjoyed it so much, that I watched it 3 nights in a row.  Why the 2 reactions?  The first time around, my reaction was that movie was slow, very laid back, and low keyed, and I was bored with it.  But watching it again, I realized that the producer was purposely taking you into another world, a dreamy world - the world of the south, in a lazy summer setting, where 2 young men were so into each other.  You can't help but get absorbed into their life.  Every little detail is exposed in this movie; the relationship, thoughts, and feelings of the 2 main characters (Luke and Jonah), as well as in depth details of their surroundings, which made you feel like you were really there.  When you pay attention to all the details in this movie, you begin to realize that this movie is a masterpiece, a real work of art!  Again, highly recommended.

Sadly, this movie was a real disappointment, I'd read several reviews lauding the moody, lilting and languid flow of this love story and I suppose I had high expectations of the film which unfortunately, resulted in my great displeasure with what amounted to an almost painfully slow, self-involved, faux artsy break up story.

I certainly have no problem with a romance story that slowly unfolds - for instance I really liked Hawaii by Marco Berger, but this movie was torturously slow and then it ended on a sad note to boot.  Other commenters pointed out that this movie seemed to lose itself in trying to be artsy for the sake of being artsy and I have to agree.  Yes, some of the scenes were very touching and much of the scenery was also very pretty, but way too much of what should have been the story of how and why these two young lovers (who mind you, were incredibly lucky to have even found each other in a small Southern US town of all unbelievable places) would choose to separate, was lost in long, pointless, close up filler shots of sometimes pretty, but otherwise insignificant inanimate objects which added nothing to the story.

Aside from some of the scenery, the two lead actors were good looking and while I can't say they made the movie watchable, at least they offset some of the immense boredom that comprised the major part of this otherwise very short 73 minute movie.  Also, they each turned in fairly decent performances as confused, moody teens.",1444780800,4,1506,4.6856060606060606

Far from anything, as long as my experience in watching films is concerned. Maybe Andy Warhol is something near. But yet so simple it may make us cry. Why is the American experience so harsh? Why there comes a moment when separation, for those lucky ones that enter college, comes as inevitable as the moment of coming of age? Two kids, happy together and boyfriends since they were four, are seen this moment approaches. One copes well with mathematics and college requirements. The other cant solve simple algebra problems. We know he could enter through the door of physical abilities, but he doesnt want. He can also easily understand musical notes,  as we see in his ability to play poignant, sad music. By the way, all is very sad in the movie. Dont you want me to go? Say it, and I won't go. But he won't say it. The experience of someone is a particular one, one shouldnt deny the person the chance to try. Or so does America thinks. All I can say is, had I had a love like this, I would have already entered Eden. I wouldnt leave it.

I understand all the negative reviews completely because I live in America and I know what a movie here has to do to qualify as a movie. This one rather chooses to do nothing. But my five years living in Europe, and having a similar relationship situation while I was there, make it easier to relate. The church bells sound surreal. The music snippets tell you more than the dialogues, if you know the music pieces and their messages intimately. And the minimalist dialogues do just fine.

The slow pace feels real to the locale and time of the film - a hot sweltering summer in the countryside.  What is amazing is that the two actors are able to build a relationship without sex and without even a kiss (if I recall), but with only intimacy.  In a sense, what is shown is pure love.

And I was powerfully reminded what of we had been fighting for all those years.  Not that the two teenage protagonists of this film face much adversity in this lovingly paced, hauntingly photographed film.  But the idea that their possibilities multiplied geometrically due to the recent court decision gave this film an added resonance.  This film is a moving meditation on love in which almost nothing happens, and much is revealed.  This debut work from filmmaker Mark Thiedeman is paced like the Arkansas summer against which it unrolls, and the characters are given us through a hundred masterful (and yet ambiguous) touches, like an achingly tender scene without words which is a protracted shot of two pairs of tennis shoe-clad feet  hanging off the end of a bed.  I recommend it highly and we can all expect great things from this filmmaker.",1436227200,2,981,5.018518518518518

Many scenes leave you to your own imagination and that's the sign of a well thought out direction. The characters are lovely, I mean inside, the words are beautifully crafted and thought provoking. Luke and Jonah are strikingly handsome and boyish as the same time. Their relationship spans some 14 years, yes, they have been together since they were 4--and somehow the tiny Southern town lives with it. I tell you, I watched one evening and then turned around and watched it again the next day. I really wanted to linger in the photography and really listen to the dialogue.

The music is just perfect as I have actually played them on a piano.  The two actors are in real life very close friends, which make their abilities a real feast for the camera!

6720599,4,B00O5A099S,"Hmmm... this one is a bit hard to review. It is beautiful in its own way. There is little dialogue and a very poetic approach to storytelling. If you are patient and not looking for a typical Hollywood narrative it is a bit like a melancholy but beautiful memory that is full of passing imagery that echoes the themes of the film. The film is visually rich- I think the constant macro closeups that at times get frustrating are intentionally capturing the sense of being in a situation where you just can't get back far enough to see objectively. There are constant visual metaphors like a floor full of spilled puzzle pieces, and a car that might not have a future, the constant rain... the film is a little bit of an art piece that you can muse on like you would with poetry. But the film is in no hurry. The film is not about narrative and resolution. It just captures a period of time and the internal process of letting go and muses the nature of folks who go and those who stay with the familiar. It is not a film about answers- it is just about moments. It took some patience to make it to the end. But I did like it.",1429833600,,1124,4.232558139534884

6720613,5,B00O5A099S,"I much enjoyed at the same time the simplicity and the depth of this movie. I think it has the effect of causing one to think of relationships with those we deeply care about as gifts that are to be cherished. Typically we are forced to encounter and deal with so much that is mundane on a daily basis without the time or the focus to really ponder on the things that enrich us and genuinely & deeply make us feel nurtured. Applause to the writer / director / producer / camerapersons / actors. This isn't one of those where you walk away whistling the theme, or where you feel the need to run out and tell all your friends about it. And that's mainly because it leaves you thinking about what and who you have in your life, who you miss, who you wish you'd not blown it with, and what you long for in your in-depth relationships -- and to strive for having more of them ... not just with a significant other, but with those you consider close & want to make even closer.

6720617,5,B00O5A099S,"Wonderfully atmospheric and amazingly breathtaking.  A slowly unwindly story of love. This film is everything the typical big budget Hollywood movie is not, but most all it is inviting.

The sparse dialog and ample silence invites the viewer to think and to interact with the story that is playing out.  A typical movie with cinstant action and an over abundance of meaningless chatter hold the view at a distance.  Most films do not want viewers to penetrate the surface because if that happens, the viewer realizes nothing is there.

Last Summer allows the viewer beneath the surface.  Last Summer gives the viewer some quiet time to think and inject their own thoughts and feelings into the story fo Luke and Jonah.  How the viewer would act and react in this story is of utmost importance.

The acting is excellent.  The cimemotography is incredible.  I especially love the opening sequence which seems to give the viewer a taste of things to come...time ti linger to explore the texture and atmosphere of life.",1428019200,,1015,4.883040935672515

If only the world were like this.  Like another commenter, if I didn't know such things were entirely impossible, I'd believe this could really happen.

This movie is a poignant character study that introduces us to two gentle souls lovingly growing apart. Dialogue is purposely spare as it should be, in keeping with the nature of this touching relationship. The long term lovers don't resort much to the spoken word as that is not their way, something we wouldnt understand if they were forced to explain unfolding events through speech. The nuances of character and emotion would be lost to us that way. One of the boys is a photographer and he reveals himself to us in part through his work. The other boy plays the piano and listening to him helps draw us into the gentle space he inhabits. The device of opening the two characters up to us, in part through their art is clever and masterfully accomplished! The cinematography and sound are exceptional and as such help earn the movie a solid five stars! Yes, its true Last Summer is nothing like most of todays big hits. There is none of the graphic nudity or sex, reverberating sound effects, strong language, and violence we become so inured to.

At the very start of the film I actually thought something was wrong with the movie itself as for several minutes you get nothing but piano music playing with what looks like close up shots of paintings and rocks. The rest of the movie plays out no better. The director or cinematographer literally has the camera focused for several long minutes of holding hands, feet, shoes, a photograph, and trees. So much so that your just tempted to fast forward past it. The storyline was very simple. A young cute couple who have been together since they were 4 years old where they must split and say goodbye as one is going away to college.

If you are expecting action, overt conflict, or explicit sex, you're not going to get them. Nor is this a tale about how awful it is to be gay in the South; no one in the story is particularly upset that the main players, Luke and Jonah, are together. Last Summer moves between long shots of textures and dappled light that ought to make any Southerner homesick, short conversations between conflicted, precocious Jonah and melancholic, more conventional Luke, and long shots of the boys just being together. The film is best enjoyed from inside your chest, feeling along with the nuances of the boys' loves, uncertainties, and shames. It is symbol laden, well shot, and occupies a lovely spot between poetry and painting. Samuel Pettit and Sean Rose give a very natural, comfortable performance together. Writer/Director/Producer Mark Thiedeman has assembled a subtle coming-of-age story where the sexuality of the characters is secondary to the much more difficult questions of how they will live now that the prescribed paths of growing-up have ended.",1424822400,11,1148,5.111702127659575

It is amazing to see 15 people who publicly were willing to declare themselves ignorant baboons without attempting to give this artful and brave film a kind thought. The movie, its characters and the authors deserve as much! If you have brains, heart and soul you'll relax, sit back and enjoy the unique vision of first love, tolerance and acceptance so often lacking in our society as witnessed by the aggressive boorish reactions to the movie on this site. My only complaint that the director was not brave enough to show at least a kiss - the ultimate expression of intimate connection. At this age love is not all about longing but eroticism as well and that part is peculiarly absent. The authors were seemingly more afraid than their characters about expressing themselves and their feelings. The slow pace may be for everyone but the patience will be rewarded a memorable haunting viewing experience.

The interplay between the two boys was so natural, the languorous look and feel of summer and first love so true, I was surprised to read this was Thiedeman's first film.  I look forward to his next.

I'm not bashing the style of the movie at all. I understand what the director is going for--the languid pace and visual storytelling--and when done well, I love those films. I'm talking about filmmakers like Terrence Malick and Marco Berger from Argentina. But this movie is only successful about half the time. The other half, it's derivative, pretentious, and heavy-handed. The final shot is so self-consciously ""arty"" it made me laugh. But there are other moments of real truth and beauty, like when Luke talks about asking his father how we know when we've met the right person. The father's answer is simple and stunning.

Hopefully this director will find his own voice and make a great film someday, but this is not it.",1420070400,4,907,4.84516129032258

But, oh, what a beautiful rendering, in images more than words, of past summers that aren't quite over. A story that could have happened fifty years ago, or last. No, these summers have certainly not ended, as there has to be more for Luke and Jonah just down the road from the movie's final imagine at the door. Whatever that is, it's left to your imagination as it is yet to happen, somewhere out of our view. Me, I see just a hint of the future story start to unfold through the pictures taken by Luke as he picks up a nearly antique camera and starts to record the world around him, the world he's unable to contemplate leaving.  You don't see his pictures, but imagine them through the films' images captured to perfection by the cinematographer (David Goodman).  I can't but think he'll find his path. But watch the movie.

6720701,5,B00O5A099S,"Last Summer is about two teenage boys, Luke and Jonah, during the summer after their last year of high school in a small town in Arkansas. They have been best friends since they were toddlers and lovers for an unspecified amount of time - presumably since puberty made it possible. Their families and everybody they know knows about and supports their relationship.

Jonah is a gifted student, artist and musician, while Luke isn't good at anything except sports, so they complement and help each other. They will be parting for the first time in their lives at the end of the summer, when Jonah goes north for college and Luke stays.

This is a blissful, idyllic fantasy that feels completely true. If I didn't know that boys like these would NEVER receive such support in such a town (they even sit together in church), I would believe it was a true story, even a documentary. Although rationally I know it's impossible, it's so real and true emotionally that what ends up being impossible is NOT believing in it.

Nothing much happens in this movie. There's some voice-over narration and some dialog, but it's primarily a sensual movie, a series of exquisitely beautiful visual and aural images that are impossible to describe adequately. Images of nature, of the boys in extreme closeup, many abstract images that are unidentifiable but powerfully evocative of the quiet, sensual, languid world in which the boys live. The score - when there is a score - is lyrical piano music by Beethoven and Schumann.

Last Summer is like a poem - about love, about beauty, about peace, about perfect harmony with the natural world. It's extraordinary and indescribable.

I never recommend that straight people watch gay movies, because if a gay movie is acceptable to straights it's by definition a failure. But this movie is so beautiful that I'm breaking that rule. Whoever you are, your life will be enriched if you see it.",1418169600,75,1918,4.835365853658536

(In particular, the long scene between Luke and his teacher is a sort of miracle, two people so lovingly seen and felt that it feels as if the human capacity for communion, however imperfect, is truly possible.)
