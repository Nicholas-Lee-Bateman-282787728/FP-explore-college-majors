5529106,5,B00AZFECT0,This set is fantastic if you don't already own the blu ray editions or have the Bond 50 set. I like the fact you can buy the Daniel Craig movies seperate from buying the whole package at this value price. The quality of the transfers is great. They basically put the Bond 50 editions in this package of two disc. This would have been nicer if it had Skyfall with it like the Overseas versions I have seen. I would also like to see them issue a set for each Bond individually like this instead there is only standard DVD sets available here in the US.,1362096000,6,550,4.19811320754717

5529137,2,B00AZFECT0,"When Daniel Craig's James Bond came out of the gate so strongly with director Martin Campbell's CASINO ROYALE, the franchise's first attempt at a reboot of the series when recasting one of the most famous fictional characters ever devised, it was an infuriating letdown to follow that up with director Marc Forster's QUANTUM OF SOLACE. Firstly, I know that the Bond franchise wanted to try and go in a different direction from what the previous films were (which was evident with CASINO ROYALE), and they did just that. But with QUANTUM, they tried something even riskier, and sadly it didn't pay off at all. First, they did their first direct sequel to a Bond film, as QOS picks up almost immediately after the final moments of CASINO ROYALE, with Bond looking to get vengeance on the group behind Le Chiffre and the blackmail and death of Vesper Lynd. Then, they went with not a tested action filmmaker but rather a indie film darling director like Forster, who has, in my opinion, done overrated film after overrated film, like MONSTER'S BALL and THE JACKET. While he could capably direct some of the action, it's actually the character moments that bring QOS to a screeching halt. The only thing that I was kind of impressed with about this film was Olga Kurleynko's character, who paralleled Bond's own obsessive quest for revenge. Although, to be honest, other than the opening car chase and some of the action sequences, I found QOS incredibly forgettable. I don't remember anything about the villain or any of the plot points. All I remember was how bereft of any real drama or suspense it was, and this empty feeling I had after viewing it. I find it so strange that Sony/MGM decided to keep going in the direction of getting a artsier director in hiring Sam Mendes, but boy, did he stick the landing on the breathlessly bravura and brilliant SKYFALL.

Seriously, if you're a Bond fan, and you really want both films for your complete collection, that would be the only sensible reason to buy this 2-disc set. But if you just want to own a really great Daniel Craig Bond film, buy the 2-disc special edition of CASINO ROYALE, and then buy SKYFALL. This is just a lame 2-disc set with bare-bones editions of both films and hence the 2-star rating. On a per-film basis, this would even out to 3.5 out of five since CASINO ROYALE is a 5-star film, and QUANTUM OF SOLACE is a 2-star film at best.",1397520000,,2401,4.649411764705882

5529164,5,B00AZFECT0,"My thoughts on the films...

CASINO ROYALE: A
I really love this movie. As a fan of 007 and a proud owner of the Bond 50 box set, I recently saw all the Bond movies (some again, others for the first time). ""Casino Royale"" is my favorite Bond film of them all. I think this film does everything right and finds the correct tone for what a Bond movie should be. The action sequences are very intense - the stunts in the opening chase are still impressive after dozens of viewings. I believe Daniel Craig is the perfect Bond, and this was a great way to introduce him into the franchise. I also liked Eva Green, who makes an excellent Bond girl (and one that Bond truly cares for); as well as Mads Mikkelsen, who plays the villain Le Chiffre. It's an added bonus that the film is set around a game of poker, a game that I personally love and appreciate.

QUANTUM OF SOLACE: B
""Quantum of Solace"" deals with the aftermath of the events in ""Casino Royale"" and picks up right where that film left off. This movie has some good performances and remarkable stunts. I enjoy it, although I do think it is the weaker of the two films in this collection. One thing I do not like is that the action scenes are cut in a very frantic manner - the editing is choppy and relies too often on close-ups; it is often difficult to tell what is going on and where characters are in relation to one another.

This set is simply a repackaging of the individual films. If you already own the movies, there's no reason to consider this purchase. But if you do not yet own these films, then this product is highly recommended - it's the first two Daniel Craig Bond films in one package at an affordable price.

There is one small flaw in this product: Casino Royale previously had a two-disc collectors edition - Disc 1 had the movie and Disc 2 had special features. Unfortunately, Disc 2 from that set is not included in this collection, so you will be missing out on the bonus material that was on that disc. I know this won't matter to everyone, but it will clearly be a factor for completists as well as people who like to watch the bonus features on the making of the movies.
