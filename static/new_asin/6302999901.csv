She gets her chance when Mister Conductor's Wishing Star is let loose by Schemer and starts granting everybody's wishes.  Schemer wishes Stacy would see things from his point of view for a change, and as a result, they switch personalities! (When Schemer answers the phone as Stacy it's hysterical!) Mayor Flopdinger winds up flying, Billy wishes he were back in bed (and ends up there!) and wishes busybody Midge Smoot would zip her lip shut -and she does! Quite literally!

Mister Conductor tells the Thomas story ""All at Sea"" where Duck wishes he could sail away to see what lies beyond the horizon.
