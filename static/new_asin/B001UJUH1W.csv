3802760,1,B001UJUH1W,"I bought this movie simply because I love Ian Somerhalder.  What a disappointment.  The plot was thin, acting horrible, character development poor and otherwise a movie I couldn't wait to end.  I love Ian, but I can't help thinking he must be embarrased by such a lousy movie.  Having said that he was great.  If you love Ian, I suggest you watch this movie with the sound muted and just enjoy watching him.  But really, don't buy it.  It's just not worth it.  You can find better clips of Ian on Youtube!",1279756800,9,505,4.413043478260869
3802761,4,B001UJUH1W,"So, i got the movie because i love Ian Somerhalder. Ian does a great job, as does the blonde waitress that i don't know her actual name. lol
The movie itself was a little lacking. you had to take a lot on faith when it came to the story line itself and its bit of WTF factors.
It was decent enough and worth a watch or two.
The music is really corny and the ending was a little, ""why?"" but still, if your an Ian fan or if you like someone else in the movie, i'd say its at least worth a rental.",1276646400,4,494,3.8058252427184467
3802762,3,B001UJUH1W,"Before I start I want to say that I LOVE Ian Somerhalder and he does a great job as the star of this film. But the story didn't seam fully developed to me. The story was alright but sometimes it felt as if the story jumped and left me slightly confused for a minute. The actors did goos jobs with what they had, and the action kept me interested thoughout the movie. And in the end I would have liked it to be longer so I could really see what the characters did but I believe this was a tv movie or something because that is what it felt like.
  In the end I enoyed seeing Ian in a staring role and would watch the movie again if I passed it channel surfing, but I would recomend that you rent before buying, I wish I would have.",1274140800,4,730,3.9591836734693877
8344090,3,B001UJUH1W,"Really weird movie... I'm not sure what I had expected. The acting,  minus that of Ian Somerhalder,  was terrible, most characters had accents that made it impossible to understand what they were saying.  The story line was all over the place and unbelievable.  The was also a completely up-played and unneeded romance.

If you're a fan of Ian Somerhalder, it is completely worth the watch.
If you are looking for a good action film... maybe try elsewhere.",1420588800,,456,4.87012987012987
8344091,4,B001UJUH1W,Good story line.  I never heard of this movie.  Glad I was able to watch it.  Kept my interest definitely.,1403913600,,106,4.2
8344092,5,B001UJUH1W,I went on Amazon and found every Ian Somerhalder film I could find and bought them for my daughter who's a big fan.  I did check them all out to make sure they played and they all did.  My daughter is happy with all of them. All were shipped in a timely manner.,1393286400,,261,3.9056603773584904
8344093,2,B001UJUH1W,"I bought this for Ian and while it's not the best it isn't the worst either. There are plot holes and the actors who play. the wife and her lover are awful, but overall it was good enough to keep me on the treadmill for the duration of the movie.",1379462400,,246,3.94
8344094,3,B001UJUH1W,"Ian Somerhalder is a better actor than this movie shows.  He does his best with what he has.
I don't think the hit men are supposed to be as funny as they are.  The plot is pretty predictable -
Worth it if you want to look at Ian but this is not a cinematic masterpiece",1368057600,,269,3.8727272727272726
8344095,4,B001UJUH1W,I watched this movie for one reason: Ian Somerhalder. I wanted to see his work apart from Vampire Diaries. He is an accountant who find out that his wife is having an affair with his boss who is embezzling money from the company and setting HIM up for the fall. (Ouch) Ian Somerhalder and Ruta Gedmintas have wonderful chemistry together. Lots of shoot 'em up action and a nice resolve ending makes for an enjoyable movie experience. The copy I viewed did not have subtitles so understanding the dialog in places was difficult. Worth watching.,1344211200,,543,4.726315789473684
8344096,4,B001UJUH1W,"I bought ""The Lost Samaritan"" because Ian Somerhalder is in it. This movie is not rated. I usually don't buy movies unless I know what kind of content will be in it. Nevertheless, I gave it a try. If it were up to me, I would rate the movie TV14. It has cussing (including the F word), a lot a brutal violence in it and two people are killed while having sex. You can hear them moaning loud for about ten seconds all together though-out the movie. There is NO nudity in this movie. I have got to admit this is not the best movie I have watched. There are holes in the story line. This movie leaves you with the question ""Why?"". I still don't understand why the two FBI agents were killing innocent people, and how the man that was saved, from the exploding car, knew the badge numbers of the two FBI agents. This movie also has a few pointless flashbacks in it. You don't even have time to forget what happened before they show you again. The actors did well with what they had to work with. In my opinion, if you like watching Ian Somerhalder or any of the other actors in this movie, you might want to buy it. Just don't plan on being able to understand all of it.",1330214400,,1166,4.163716814159292
8344097,4,B001UJUH1W,"Ian what's his nuts looks good & DVD works great - too bad it isn't a Great Movie.
Got it in great condition & quickly though!!",1313107200,,127,3.923076923076923
8344098,1,B001UJUH1W,"I really have to admit that I am a huge fan of Ian Somerhalder which brought me to buy that movie. But I deeply regret it. Not even a hardcore-fan like me is able to say something positive about that movie... It's a low-cost production, it seems they not even tried to hide that it was shoot in Germany and not the U.S.. The story was more than thin and the repetitions of scenes again and again were absolutely unnecessary, except for the reason to stretch the movie...

Well... like Ian wrote a few years ago (after ""The Lost Samaritan"") on a message board: ""It's been a crazy road but I'm back in the saddle and wanting to send a huge thank you and express to you that I'm truly sorry for bad movies, bad characters and most of all a bad disappearing act!""",1303257600,2,759,4.270833333333333
8344099,3,B001UJUH1W,"For fans of TV Vampire Ian Somerhaulder, this low budget action-suspense film will be an enjoyable time waster. Somerhaulder spends much of the movie in perile, and the plot has just enough suspense to string you a long for 90 minutes. One major flaw: Obviously filmed in Europe, this had a few too many ""American"" agents and cops with thick European accents. If you can get past that, and some flat dialog, check this one out.",1282262400,,427,4.631578947368421
