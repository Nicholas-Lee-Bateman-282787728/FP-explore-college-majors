5463642,5,B00AP2DDHU,"I liked this one. I really love the pictures on the front of the DVD boxes of the syfy movies, it's always fun to see my husband get excited and then afterwards he looks at the box and says 'that wasn't in there'. He's caught on so he's not as thrilled to watch them with me now. He just falls asleep :(. Love syfy movies.. Even if I have to watch them alone...",1461974400,5,361,3.958904109589041

5463644,5,B00AP2DDHU,"If you love bad movies, this is fantastic.  Sand Serpents alone is worth it in my opinion.  Wish there were more of these SyFy movie packs available.",1458345600,,149,4.481481481481482

5463647,5,B00AP2DDHU,"So good! If you love cheesy syfy flicks, these are for you. A little scary (is the writing amd the acting), but overall excellent. The quality of the DVDs is great, no scratches, and the packaging was pristine.",1453939200,7,210,4.552631578947368

5463650,4,B00AP2DDHU,"All in the minds of man. A collection of the eerie and the strange. You got to see these spooky movies at least once. Owning them, you can indulge when you get bored..",1447977600,3,167,4.090909090909091
5463651,4,B00AP2DDHU,The movies were fine once I got them to play. There was no sound when I tried to play each movie on my DVD player. I tried Myvern on the computer and there was sound. I found this annoying as I always watch my movie on the DVD player. The movies themselves were great. I have no problem with their quality. Just wish they worked on the DVD player. If you don't have a computer that plays movies you might want to consider passing on this set!,1447718400,9,442,4.091954022988506

5463655,5,B00AP2DDHU,"These are some of the better movies that run on the SyFy Channel. And a couple, like Wyvvern and Road Kill, are top-notch. To be sure, these movies aren't for everybody. But if you like cookin' up some popcorn and kicking back to watch some whup-ass monster fun, these movies will do the trick.",1441411200,7,294,4.462962962962963

5463659,5,B00AP2DDHU,"This is a great set of B-grade sci-fi movies for the price. I it is a three-disc set, so the set comes with two movies on each of disc. The quality is good. I'm an old man, and watching these movies is like watching the classic B-grade sci-fi flicks of the 1950s that I grew up on watching at the local Saturday afternoon monster movie double feature. Corny but great fun!",1429747200,35,372,4.253521126760563
