8600747,2,B00E3UR69G,"What disappointed me about this ""Director's Cut"" version of this film is that, for the most part (with the exception of a few very short, extended scenes, its exactly like the first version I purchased, which isn't a ""Director's Cut."" The reason I bought this version of the film on DVD, is because in the trailer for the film, there is a scene that does NOT appear in either versions of the film on DVD. Its the only reason I purchased this version, and it wasn't in the film! I was pretty PO'ed when I discovered this after watching the entire film. Even going back and searching for that particular scene when. Its the scene (on the trailer) where mom is speaking to her daughter in her bedroom, and they toss a glass of water onto Toby (the demon), who is standing behind mom, unbeknownst to her. What happens next is beyond me, cause I have never been able to find the version of the film that has that particular scene in it. So that is why I'm disappointed by this version on the film. Personally I don't think there is any major difference between the Director's Cut and the regular DVD release version of this film, with the exception of a few very short scenes that honestly make no difference whatsoever. All I want is to have the version of the movie with the scene I described above, and this version does not supply me with it, even though the official trailer for this film shows otherwise. Whats up with that?",1450656000,,1425,4.442748091603053
