8263880,5,B0016PNK5U,Item that arrived was exactly what I expected and in the condition that was promised.,1521590400,,85,4.733333333333333
8263881,4,B0016PNK5U,"Happy to find this rare film - we are a Texas A&M family, and this movie is required viewing for new students at A&M, so it will bring back memories of our graduates' years at A&M",1420070400,2,179,4.0
8263882,5,B0016PNK5U,"As a movie, it's really bad.  But as a wartime snapshot, it's priceless.  Robert Mitchum makes his move from stunt guy to speaking roles.  And it captures the spirit of A&M, heightened by wartime.

My father was a cadet there, class of '43.  He said that every time some war hero came back to inspire the cadets, a number would turn up missing the next day, determined to get into the fight as quickly as they could.

 The whole Cadet Corps became extras for the movie.  Dad loved getting out of class because of Hollywood.  He also played poker with Mitchum, who was very much a regular guy.  Then and afterwards.

So, Priceless for WWII buffs, Mitchum buffs, and Aggie fans.  Not so much for film buffs.",1382140800,,705,4.464566929133858
8263883,5,B0016PNK5U,The greatest movie ever made!  Beats the hell out of Rudy. Stars a young Robert Mitchum in his greatest role.,1379116800,2,109,4.45
8263884,5,B0016PNK5U,"I purchased this movie for my husband who is a graduate of Texas A&M--an Aggie.  His father was an Aggie and one of our daughters is an Aggie.  Just a great period movie about Texas A&M way back when.  The traditions and morals that were in place then are still in place today.
It is a bit ""corny"" by todays standards but really enjoyed it.",1377820800,4,340,4.2
8263885,4,B0016PNK5U,The film was released in 1943 and adapted to VHS tape format by the Class of 1960. The story is about an A&M student in the time prior to and during WWII. The film is entertaining as a story and is filled with Aggie tradtions. The film itself might get 2 1/2 stars and the Aggie value is five stars.,1325808000,5,299,4.0
8263886,5,B0016PNK5U,"This is a great movie for all Texas Aggies and Aggie fans. While it is most properly labeled as a war propaganda B-movie, it nevertheless shows a great deal of the Aggie spirit and life on the Texas A&M campus during World War II. When I was a student there (1963-1967), the film was shown each year at Guion Hall, the theater on campus, and I went every time to see it again.

I gave it a 5-star rating because I am heavily biased--I admit it and make no apologies for it.

For several years I had a VHS of this movie, but it is now available in DVD. Stores on the A&M campus have it available for purchase, so if you're interested, please check it out and see for yourself. Although the A&M of yesteryear as many people knew it has changed dramatically, its legacy lives on. A&M produced more military officers in World War II than did West Point, so that should give some idea of A&M's reputation and service.

If you aren't an Aggie fan, you just might become one if you see the movie. Gig 'em!",1245715200,23,998,4.242105263157895
