6979890,5,B00SCJ56HI,"Most challenging prenatal barre video. Great instruction, great challenging exercises, great explanations, great company! I am in my 3rd trimester and had been doing her Slim and Toned Barre video or other strength 2-3 times a week throughout my pregnancy. I would suggest starting with slim and toned then working up to this one. This is very challenging. But it feels great. Suzanne is a great instructor and very encouraging and offers great modifications and considerations for safety. FYI from my perspective the leg and seat work is harder then the core and arm work. My legs are strong from being a  competitive runner, so I was surprised to find the leg exercises to be harder then the arms and core work. but maybe it just addresses some of the small leg muscle groups of mine that are weak.",1426291200,14,800,4.755395683453237
6979891,5,B00SCJ56HI,"Easily five stars!  I have Suzanne's other prenatal workout Slim and Toned as well, which is also great.  It is fun to alternate with this one. They are both different, so it was worth the new purchase.  If you keep your form right, the work out is tough--but not in a way that makes you dread it.  Suzanne keeps it fun and fast paced, and her cues are right on.  Makes you feel fit and strong--so important while pregnant.  Thank you, Suzanne, for another fantastic and fun DVD!",1424131200,17,479,4.386363636363637
6979892,3,B00SCJ56HI,Didn't feel much of a workout but the stretching helped,1505174400,,55,4.6
6979893,5,B00SCJ56HI,"This prenatal workout is amazing. I love anything Suzanne does, and so once I became pregnant I was excited to finally try her prenatal DVD. Well, even after 2 years of following her barre workouts, I was fatigued, shaking, and sweating after this one. The thigh segment is especially challenging - oh the burn! I have to give myself a little pep talk before this segment, but afterwards I feel so alive and accomplished. I started this DVD in the beginning of my second trimester. I am now nearing the end of my third, and I think this workout has been very effective in keeping a toned and strong physique. Definitely recommended.",1500336000,,632,4.651785714285714
6979894,5,B00SCJ56HI,I absolutely love this workout! I felt more fit then I did before I got pregnant! I still do this workout!,1499299200,,106,4.095238095238095
6979895,5,B00SCJ56HI,"This is a great workout DVD! It seemed easy to me at first- but as my pregnancy has progressed it has been a great addition.  I'm currently 31 weeks pregnant and mixing this into my workouts.  It feels very safe.  The moves don't seem hard at first, but as you repeat them with slight variations the burn begins! My only complaint is I wish this got my heart rate up a bit more.  Overall, feels like a solid, safe for pregnancy workout that a lot of women could benefit from.",1497830400,2,475,4.2444444444444445
6979896,5,B00SCJ56HI,Love this! It really helped me in my pregnancy! I work out a lot and love that her workouts still challenged me. I will definitely do these workout again in my future pregnancies.,1494547200,,179,4.454545454545454
6979897,2,B00SCJ56HI,"I do not recommend this DVD for people that were already active before pregnancy, or if you have been to barre classes. This DVD is more geared toward people that are not used to working out/being active more then once a week. DVD should be names ""Barre for beginners"". I am in my third trimester and this DVD was not even a little challenging!",1493856000,,344,4.390625

6979899,2,B00SCJ56HI,I really couldn't get into this. I gave it two stars because it was possibly just the wrong workout for me. I was pretty fit going into pregnancy and did not have any trouble completing an Insanity or any other HIT workout. This was just incredibly slow and pointless for me. I do not like the exercises and did not find them challenging well into my third trimester. I did not find any pregnancy workouts to get the job done. I found it best to just modify my current workouts to death and walk.,1489276800,,496,4.287234042553192
6979900,5,B00SCJ56HI,"I'm really enjoying this prenatal workout.  I've been supplementing it with her Sim & Toned DVD and this one is definitely a little more challenging.  The segments are a tiny bit longer, and the relaxation stretch is a lot longer which is nice on those days when you have the extra time and need a deeper stretch from the intense muscle work in this video.  I was fit pre-pregnancy, mostly using Insanity, T25, 21 DFX, and I have to say the Barre workouts are a humbling experience for me!  They burn your legs and butt and I am a little sore the next day, which is a welcome feeling.",1486944000,,584,4.330275229357798
6979901,5,B00SCJ56HI,The video is great and easy to follow! She doesn't move to fast through each workout and I feel like I am getting a great workout while not over exerting myself during pregnancy.,1486339200,,178,4.424242424242424
6979902,1,B00SCJ56HI,Super annoying when the instructor is NOT pregnant,1483401600,,50,5.375
6979903,5,B00SCJ56HI,"I began using this workout a few months before I got pregnant, as a workout for my off days from Jillian Michaels. I was doing 30 Day Shred 4-5 days a week, and 2-3 of the workouts from this video on the other days. I continued with the 30 Day Shred/Sleek and Toned combination until around 14 weeks, when 30 Day Shred was getting to be too much ab work for my body.
I am now 29 weeks and still going strong with this workout DVD; I usually do 2-3 of the segments at a time. Seat work is the hardest and causes the most discomfort because of my pubic symphysis pain, but everything else feels good!
It's fun and gives me just the right amount of burn. I would highly recommend this workout video for pregnancy and beyond. I think if I had not been working out beforehand, it might've been too hard for a beginner, so keep it in mind that this might be a butt-whooping if you haven't been working out before pregnancy.",1483315200,2,917,4.215909090909091

These workouts, and I only did two a day are excellent.  You workout every part of your body.  The instructors form is impeccable.  As my pregnancy progressed I did what I could and left the rest.  I passed this on to a pregnant friend.  I may ask for it back and do it when I am not pregnant!",1480809600,,425,3.86046511627907

6979909,5,B00SCJ56HI,I started out with Suzanne Bowen's Slim&Toned Prenatal Barre workout DVD when I first found out I was pregnant and loved it. When I was about 20 weeks pregnant I decided to order this one to switch it up a little. I am glad I started out with the Slim&Toned as I find it is a better fit for Barre beginners but I LOVE this one!!! It is more challenging but also more rewarding. The stretching segment is amazing! I am now 30 weeks pregnant and have been doing at least one segment plus the stretching segment every day for the last 10 weeks and I feel fit and strong and have been able to keep my weight in check. I would strongly recommend this workout DVD for pregnancy and postpartum. Thank you Suzanne Bowen!!!,1479081600,,714,4.296296296296297

6979912,5,B00SCJ56HI,"I have a lot of Suzanne's BarreAmped workouts, I wasn't doing them very often because they're pretty challenging and I always felt I needed to complete the workout in its entirety whenever I did them. Being pregnant, I don't feel that way and I'm grateful for the 13-15 minute sections. It's lower intensity than her normal Barre workouts, but I don't think it's much easier. I would definitely recommend this workout.",1474934400,3,418,4.901408450704225

6979915,5,B00SCJ56HI,"This dvd is a my 2nd one of Suzanne Bowen.  I am very pleased with all the different exercises in this video.  She offers a wide range of working out different body parts while pregnant.  I can already see a difference in my arms since starting to use this,  Its nice that she had modifications for your growing belly, even though I still think this would be a great workout post pregnancy also.",1469491200,,395,4.36986301369863
6979916,5,B00SCJ56HI,This is by far the best pregnancy workout I've ever had! It is the right amount of challenging. I would say even if you didn't work out before pregnancy you could modify and still do this work out. It would give you something to build up to!,1469145600,2,241,4.148936170212766
6979917,5,B00SCJ56HI,"I tried a lot of the 90's-era videos from the library before getting serious about a more updated pregnancy workout. I really liked this barre workout and preferred it to Bowen's ""Slim and toned prenatal video"" for sure. Bowen works out with a 3rd trimester pregnant woman, so modifications are available although I didn't find many of them necessary. Prior to pregnancy, I was 145 lbs and in decent shape (could run 3 miles, do light lifting) and this barre video definitely works on muscles that hadn't gotten attention for awhile. I would like to continue with it post-partum. I like the length of the segments, you could do 4 of them or just 1-2 if pressed for time. Highly recommend!",1468713600,3,688,4.694214876033058
6979918,5,B00SCJ56HI,"Perfect for us pregnant ladies! I do as well plan on doing these workouts post pregnancy. I always feel the burn and see results and I've been using it for the past 2 months.

It's quite challenging, but I think anyone can enjoy it. She offers modifications to make it easier, but if you exercised regularly prior to your pregnancy you should be able to keep up with the more difficult modifications. This DVD is broken up into short segments for warmup, light weights, thighs, seat work, mat work, cardio and stretching. Great exercise routine for pregnancy and postnatal!",1467417600,,571,4.777777777777778

6979923,5,B00SCJ56HI,"I'm a huge Suzanne Bowen fan and this DVD does not disappoint. Honestly, I think it may be tougher than her workouts on her website but I love the challenge.

6979927,5,B00SCJ56HI,"LOVE this video. I workout to this or the Slim and Toned Barre video every morning. I did this throughout my pregnancy and only gained 14 pounds.

6979928,5,B00SCJ56HI,"Great work out for moms looking to tone up.  The cardio segment is quick (which I loved), about 20-30 min, and got my heart rate up.  There's also weight lifting and stretching segments, for about 5 or 6 total workout options on this DVD.  I ordered free weights and a yoga mat, too.  Love it.",1461628800,,293,4.2727272727272725

I love that I can pick and choose the exercises to complete, and I feel like I get a great toning workout in about 35 minutes, including warmup.  I keep my intensity down a bit since I just started this program, but I could totally see myself using this after I give birth as one of my regular routines, with extra weight and higher intensity.",1460160000,2,450,4.270588235294118

I'm actually energized (being in my first trimester, I'm NEVER energized lately, lol!) I feel the burn in my muscles and I love how much she focuses on the pelvic floor because I feel like I'm protecting my baby. I can definitely see how this will keep me fit and ready for birth and help me lose the weight after.

6979936,4,B00SCJ56HI,"I love this video! Currently I'm 26 weeks and have been doing it since I became pregnant. It is challenging yet gentle enough for me to continue toning through my pregnancy. I used this one along with her Slim and Toned Prenatal video while continuing to jog and I have gained weight only in my belly, no where else. Now that I'm coming up to the third trimester jogging is getting much harder as I grow and gain weight so I'm anticipating doing the two videos cardio section more this last stretch. I like how you can choose shorter sections if you don't have time for the whole 88 minute video at once. I anticipate to do this post partum in sections throughout the day/week while baby is sleeping. Pre pregnancy I did a little barre but am mainly a runner and I really like her method. I plan to sign up on her website and continue to do her streaming videos because you work all the right spots and I feel so great afterwards!",1455753600,2,930,4.32

6979939,5,B00SCJ56HI,"I really enjoy this video. I like that there are six sections, so I can mix and match and design a workout that fits my needs each day. I'm am shocked that such small movements can create such a burn in my muscles!  I plan on continuing to use this video long after baby arrives.

My only complaint is the stretching section of the routine. The voice over instructions are weird.  Also, the main woman who's demonstrating the poses isn't pregnant. She doesn't offer many alternatives to accommodate for a growing belly. I'm about halfway through my pregnancy and still have a relatively small belly, but already I'm missing some of the deep stretching because my belly is in the way.

Overall, however, I would recommend this video to any mama-to-be who wants to tone and tighten. This video is challenging but not impossible and definitely worth the cost.",1454976000,6,856,4.724832214765101

These workouts are about 13-15 minutes each so they are perfect for combining - you can do thigh work then seat work for example or cardio followed by weight work.  Whatever floats your boat. As for the reviewers that complained about the instructor not being pregnant, I think that's ridiculous.  She's done several prenatal DVDs and you can't possibly expect her to keep popping out babies just so she can be pregnant to film these videos.  She has a workout partner in the videos that is pregnant so you can see someone in their 3rd trimester doing these exercises.",1453852800,26,732,4.6

I love that I can pick a few to do every day in conjunction with my jogging and lifting.

This is perfect for beginners or advanced users.",1452211200,6,301,4.084745762711864
6979945,5,B00SCJ56HI,"I am so excited about this DVD!  It arrived last night and I just finish my first use this morning!

First things first, know that this DVD is very challenging--in a good way!!  Don't be scared, it's okay to slow down and take breaks, in fact she encourages you to do so if your body tells you to.  BUT this DVD is also totally doable!  She times everything great and just when you think you can't possible do one more little rep, she switches moves. Your never doing anything longer than 8 seconds without changing it up a bit or totally switching moves.

I'm in my second trimester now, and pre pregancy I would classify myself as about average fitness wise.  I would workout a few times a week (on good weeks), and take my pup for daily walks.  Now, first trimester nausea and fatigue hit me hard and I might have exercised a total of. . . twice?  In that time!  So I think my muscles and cardio level atrophied a bit.

That being said, this workout is CHALLENGING but totally DOABLE!!  If you're looking for something that can really, really make a difference while you're pregnant (and tired of thinking ""I'm pregnant--not dead!!"" with all of the super easy prenatal workouts out there), I really recommend this DVD!!

I was able to follow along at about 80% percent today with taking short breaks (partly because I was still learning the moves and partly because holy cow I thought I was gonna die!!) and I feel really great!!  I made it all the way to the end of mat work and then rested in child's pose while listening to the cardio portion :)  I'll work up to hopefully being able to keep up 100% and make it all the way to the end!!

All in all, I think this is a great DVD.  Suzanne is no nonsense, no mushy gushy baby talk throughout the workout which I know an annoy some!  She does every bit of the workout with you and admits to really having to try through some parts!  She has probably the best lower body ever--which is super encouraging when you feel like yours is literally on fire and shaking!

I'm in the beginning of my 3rd pregnancy and wanted something to get me toned and in shape this time around. I kinda worried this wouldn't be advanced enough but after having to take a break from the 3 minute workout I knew I was wrong! These exercises work muscles in my body that I forgot I even had! I truly believe that I will look better at the end of my pregnancy than I do right now, and I can't wait to see the transformation!!

I'm currently at 21 weeks and able to still do all the 'advanced' modifications but I definitely feel it the next day! If you do the entire DVD together, it's an especially challenging workout. I also have the Slim and Toned prenatal DVD and I like being able to switch it up between the two for variety. I prefer the upper body weight work in BarreAmped but find al the other segments challenging and fun. Highly recommend!",1448841600,,531,4.659574468085107
6979949,5,B00SCJ56HI,"Update: I have now been doing this video for 12 weeks. I'm 28+ weeks pregnant. I stopped getting sore after about 7 weeks. I've now combined this with Suzanne Bowen's Slim and Toned during the week and do 30 minutes a day. I have not hurt my back once since beginning even though I was often hurting it before starting (even when not pregnant). I have unexpectedly sneezed and had no pelvic floor issues thanks to all of the pelvic floor work in this video. I even twisted my ankle last week and nothing hurt the next day due to my body becoming overall stronger. I'm really looking forward to using the combination of these two videos through my third trimester and possibly postnatal period too! We are expecting our 8th baby and I have never felt stronger or healthier!

Original post: Really love this video! This is my first Suzanne Bowen video and it won't be my last! There's no jumping around and I don't feel winded or like I just want it to be over. I look forward to my workouts for the first time! If I'm sore it's really only for a day (and maybe a little the next) which is wonderful when you're pregnant! I feel stronger and my back is hurting me less! I anticipate that only getting better as I get stronger!

I'm currently 18 weeks and have been doing this for about 2 weeks. This combined with the book Trim Healthy Mama ( http://www.amazon.com/Trim-Healthy-Mama-Plan-Easy-Does-/dp/1101902639/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1454342303&sr=8-2&keywords=trim+healthy+mama ) for eating has really made a tremendous difference in this pregnancy.

I also love how tenderly she talks about pregnancy, makes me teary eyed each time she mentions how worth it your baby is! I love that she says ""God bless you"" at the end of one of the workouts. This was a great buy!",1448236800,4,1767,4.749185667752443
6979950,5,B00SCJ56HI,"I LOVE Suzanne Bowen and her workouts. I have been doing her Barre Amped workouts for over 2 years now. When I found out I was pregnant I wanted to make sure I knew the proper way to exercise that was good for my body and also beneficial to the baby. This DVD is amazing because Suzanne gives you trimester modifications, teaches you about proper form (as always), and how to exercise effectively and safely for baby. No crazy crunches here, just proper pregnancy ab work that challenges you while protecting your abdominal muscles in pregnancy.

This DVD is a must for every pregnant woman. It's challenging, encouraging and totally toning! I can't believe I've been able to maintain strength and tone my body well even through pregnancy.",1447891200,3,739,4.7734375

6979953,5,B00SCJ56HI,Excellent workout! I even used it post natal.,1447113600,,45,4.75
6979954,5,B00SCJ56HI,"My favorite prenatal DVD, have tried a ton. Like how there are several different workouts to choose from and best of all keep my back safe!",1445472000,,139,4.384615384615385
6979955,5,B00SCJ56HI,Love love love it! I have both Suzanne's prenatal barre dvds and they're both different and equally great.  I think this one is a little more intense but i highly recommend both!,1444953600,,178,4.5625
6979956,5,B00SCJ56HI,"I am a very fit person who loves high intenaity interval training. I obviously could no longer practice that so I started this program at about 8 weeks pregnant. I LOVE IT. It's just challenging enough and you can pick and choose which workout you want to do. II used this DVD interchangeably with another one (Slim and Toned) of hers and found that gave me everything I needed and more. I LOVED how my body looked through out my whole pregnancy. I worked out until week 40. ""Sleek and toned is the slightest bit more challenging. Oh, and Suzanne is not annoying. She talks you through without talking too much. She gives great direction, tips, adjustments and alternatives.",1444348800,,674,4.6722689075630255
6979957,5,B00SCJ56HI,"I must admit this is a special dvd, pregnant or not. Its great for toning up problem areas without putting strain on your joints. Your heartrate will stay below 40 and you can pick your workouts tailored to ur time restraints. I was sore after one workout and saw mild definition with only using 2lb weights. I plan on using this dvd in combinatiom with walking for the last 16 weeks of pregnancy and beyond...",1440201600,2,410,4.48
6979958,5,B00SCJ56HI,"I worked out regularly before I was pregnant with DVD programs like Insanity and PiYO. I was able to continue these into my pregnancy with a few modifications. When I hit the third trimester, I started experiencing more pelvic pain and abdominal cramping so I needed something lower impact. These workouts were exactly what I needed with high repetitions, low weights, and smaller range of motion. She offers modifications for third trimester as needed. The workouts are short (about 15 mins each), but you can do several in a row. While I'm not dripping in sweat at the end, my muscles feel like they've been working. Suzanne is encouraging and explains the exercises but is not overly peppy. I also got her Barre Slim and Toned DVD, which was a bit easier but still a good workout. I alternate these with Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga and go for walks everyday and feel really good about my third trimester fitness. While I began these in the third trimester, I think they're definitely challenging enough to do throughout the pregnancy, especially since she offers a few different levels of difficulty for most exercises.",1439769600,31,1120,4.869109947643979
6979959,5,B00SCJ56HI,"I'm three months postpartum, and this is still an awesome workout. I used to run regularly, but I stopped once I got pregnant. These workouts have kept me strong. I recently went running for the first time after almost a year, and I was able to do three miles off the bat without stopping. I've been doing this DVD, along with her Slim & Toned and Barre Amped Bootcamp series. I'm a huge fan of all of Suzanne Bowen's workouts. She gives clear directions and is good at giving options for easier or harder variations. If you go with the hardest variations, you'll get an awesome workout, pregnant or not. Highly recommend!",1439337600,5,622,4.5625
6979960,5,B00SCJ56HI,"I expected that since this was a prenatal workout it would be fairly ""easy"" - NOT the case!  A great workout that is challenging but not too difficult.  It is broken up into shorter intervals which is nice.",1439164800,2,206,4.394736842105263
6979961,5,B00SCJ56HI,"I really enjoyed this workout. I do barre in the studio, I feel like this is comparable and has great modifications for being pregnant. I felt like I got a good work out without straining. Can see how it could be challenging for others who have not done barre class prior!",1439164800,2,272,4.352941176470588
6979962,5,B00SCJ56HI,This is a great dvd that actually makes you feel like you are still working out when you're pregnant!,1439078400,,101,4.368421052631579
6979963,4,B00SCJ56HI,"Nice range of workouts and can put different segments together to make it more challenging. New to barreamp and have really been surprised by how challenging it can be.
Would have liked some more cardio elements in the dvd overall.",1437868800,,231,4.8
6979964,5,B00SCJ56HI,I wasn't sure about working out while pregnant but these routines were perfect!! I am 31 weeks pregnant. The routines are enough of a challenge but do not cause me strain or discomfort during my pregnancy. Suzanne does a great job at guiding you through the exercises to make sure you are careful to maintain good posture with your growing belly. My favorite part is the relaxation stretch chapter. My body is feeling sore as I enter the third trimester and the stretches are very helpful. I also have a two year old and I've found these exercises to be the perfect routines to do while he plays beside me. It is great that I can do it at home!,1437436800,6,644,4.375
6979965,5,B00SCJ56HI,"I've been working out A LOT throughout my pregnancy, and this is, by far, the best workout I've gotten! Highly recommend it!!",1435276800,,125,4.7272727272727275
6979966,5,B00SCJ56HI,"I started this DVD today and I simply looooved it! I'm on my first trimester and I can see myself doing this through my whole pregnancy. I felt I really worked out. She is amazing and her exercises are very well explained. I had never practice barre before but I can tell you I'm hooked from now on, it just feels right. I bought as well her other DVD called slim and toned, haven't tried it yet but can't wait. Totally recomend it. These are realistic exercises you can carry on through your pregnancy.",1434585600,2,503,4.361702127659575
6979967,5,B00SCJ56HI,Amazing! I am fit and couldn't find a challenging enough workout to satisfy me until i got barre amped for prenatal! I feel strong and get compliments on how fit i look at 6mos preg showen in pic attached. Love it!,1433721600,22,214,4.2439024390243905
6979968,5,B00SCJ56HI,"Love this work out! I am five months pregnant and get such a good work out from this video! It's challenging, gets your heart rate up, and makes you feel your muscles the next day without overdoing it while pregnant!",1433289600,2,216,4.425
6979969,5,B00SCJ56HI,I have been doing SBF Fitness streaming videos online for the past year and have absolutely fallen in love with all things Suzanne. She has incredible set up cues and the exercises are so effective. Not to mention her sweet down to earth personality. I was so excited to see her expand her pregnancy videos. I am pregnant with my third and excited to do Suzanne's workouts throughout. Definitely a great DVD for the fitness enthusiast who love barre work.,1432944000,4,455,4.7
6979970,5,B00SCJ56HI,"This barre workout is perfect for pregnancy! It is adequately challenging and makes great modifications for different stages of pregnancy. Even in my third trimester, I find this to be a great way to exercise and even prepare for the birth. My favorite portions of the DVD are the light weights, mat work and seat work. Suzanne provides more advanced options while a modification is also modeled. Sretching and cool-down is included which is very relaxing and helps to feel accomplished at the end.  I highly recommend this DVD and plan to use it until the end of pregnancy and afterwards!",1431302400,8,589,4.8316831683168315
6979971,5,B00SCJ56HI,"Love this DVD. It is challenging, but even if you are able to do 80% of the reps are getting a great workout. I usually do Barre workouts 3-4 times a week (alternating this DVD with Suzanne's Original Slim & Toned) and feel that it has kept me in excellent shape for 5 months of pregnancy. Hoping to keep it up for the next 4 months!",1430956800,,333,4.0606060606060606

6979974,5,B00SCJ56HI,"I love this workout! I have been taking BarreAmped classes for a few years, and I love the variations in this DVD. I have seen more change in my body from this method than any other form of exercise I have ever done! It has just the right amount of intense work and rest. I also love that it is broken into different segments, so if you are crunched on time, you can take 10 mins to focus on one part of the body. I also love that Suzanne added a cardio segment to this one as well. She gives great modifications, but also always has a more challenging option if you want it. This workout will target all the right areas to help get your body ready for baby! I will definitely be doing this for the rest of my pregnancy, and pregnancies to come. Thanks, Suzanne for another great workout!",1428969600,,788,4.190789473684211
6979975,5,B00SCJ56HI,The instruction in this video is great! I am in my first trimester and I love that it gives so many different modifications for later down the road. I take barre amped studio classes as well and this dvd really feels like you are in the class with all of the cues Suzanne gives. It's tough and gives a great workout for expecting moms without having to worry about the moves being too advanced or what to do the further along you get in your pregnancy. The modification are already built in. It really makes me feel good about my fitness level which is so encouraging during this part of pregnancy when your body is going through so many drastic changes. I would definitely recommend it!,1428969600,,687,4.4603174603174605
6979976,5,B00SCJ56HI,"LOVE this workout.  I have her other prenatal workout and felt challenged but not overwhelmed by both.  I'm 35 weeks pregnant and can still do all the exercises and feel ""worked out"" but not depleted.",1428451200,4,200,4.685714285714286
6979977,5,B00SCJ56HI,"Simple and challenging workout. Really enjoy it! Makes me feel energized and stronger. Like that each workout is only about 15 minutes, makes it easy to perform and fit it any day. Worth the time and money!",1428019200,,206,4.594594594594595
6979978,5,B00SCJ56HI,"This is my first pregnancy, and I have been looking for a good workout that is safe for me and the baby. I found this to be both.

6979979,5,B00SCJ56HI,Definitely my favourite prenatal workout dvd!  I love when I have the time to do all of the segments together.  It's challenging but as a former Bar Method client I love the shaking and the 15 minutes or less segments keep it interesting.  Well worth it!,1427328000,,254,4.478260869565218
6979980,5,B00SCJ56HI,this is my all time FAVORITE workout dvd ever! it is set up in the same order as a Barreamped class which i love! the segments are super challenging (even if you're not pregnant!) and safe for the expecting mama. I love this method and think it is amazing that Suzanne is passionate about filming & teaching pre/postnatal workouts as well as regular workouts! i would highly recommend this dvd to any mama. Even if you've never done barre or barreamped before this is so easy to follow and there are great setup instructions! :),1426636800,2,528,4.568421052631579
6979981,3,B00SCJ56HI,"I bought this Dvd as Well as her slim and fit, but I prefer her slim and fit. Her moves are quite similar so I found this dvd a little bit irrelevant. They are split into sections of light weight work, thigh work, seat work, mat work, and cardio tone. Personally, I found these individual sections too repetitive. I would much prefer a full body workout that touches upon a little of each section rather than concentrating on one for 15 minutes. For example the thigh work made me want to die and I got a bit bored. The cardio is the best because at least you're getting your heart rate up at the same time to give you an extra energy boost for all these small controlled exercises. Also she does a ton of body tilting that hurts my back trying to strain and watch what's she's doing on the screen at the same time.",1426291200,9,815,4.230769230769231
8698127,5,B00SCJ56HI,"The instructor in this dvd is so intelligent. I recommend it to any mama to be that is already into fitness, this will keep you healthy and strong while also keeping you informed about what you should do differently while pregnant. I am a yoga teacher and I would do this on alternating days with my own prenatal yoga practice and it seriously helped me bounce back after baby.",1534377600,,377,4.478260869565218
8698128,5,B00SCJ56HI,"I've had a difficult time exercising due to some very painful pelvic bone pressure. This issue only comes up during pregnancy but makes it very difficult to find the right exercises that I can actually do the whole way through. I decided to give this DVD a try and seriously couldn't be happier with my purchase! All of the segments are manageable yet challenging. And the best part is, no pain!! Happy to be able to finish out my final trimester using BarreAmped!",1521590400,,464,4.602409638554217

8698130,5,B00SCJ56HI,I wanted to be fit for my last pregnancy (3rd baby) and I was looking for a DVD that made me work but didn't kill me lol. This was perfect! I do it everyday and mix up the routines. I can definitely see results and I can tell that I am building strength by completing the workouts without having to take a break. I researched several pregnancy workout dvds and I am SO glad I chose this one!,1519257600,,391,4.0256410256410255
8698131,5,B00SCJ56HI,"I am 30 weeks pregnant and have always been in pretty good shape, running about ten miles per week pre-pregnancy.

I own five workout DVDs-Prenatal sculpt and Prenatal yoga sculpt, both by Knocked Up Fitness; Prenatal Physique with Leah Sarago; Glow Prenatal by Barre3; and this one. This is the only DVD that I can say is truly challenging, although I am glad to have all the DVDs that I mentioned-they are really great.

 This feels more like a real Barre workout and less like a prenatal workout DVD.
There is a 3 minute warm-up, light weight work (13 min), thigh work (14 min), seat work (13 min), mat work (14 min), cardio tone (13 min), and relaxation stretch (15 min).

The relaxation stretch was OK, and the cardio tone segment was the only segment that I found to be a little easier, although still enjoyable and helpful. During the other segments, I'd have to take mini breaks in the middle of sets!

Like any other Barre workout, I loved it, but it wasn't necessarily ""fun"", since it was so hard.

You'll need a yoga mat and light weights to participate fully in these workouts.

I like that Suzanne Bowen doesn't talk too much, and she stays focused on the reps, often counting down, which always helps me.

I'm very happy that I bought this DVD!",1517184000,4,1258,4.535398230088496

I've even done an Ironman and was really sad when I couldn't do long workouts when I was pregnant. I did this DVD almost every day and literally a week after I had the baby I don't even look like I was pregnant!  I'm still using the DVD and I'm not even pregnant. I guess I should use one of the other ones but I just love it so much:),1507939200,,435,3.865168539325843
8698136,5,B00SCJ56HI,"I'm now week 38 pregnant and still using this DVD (and her second one). It's the only workout that is challenging and painful enough in a healthy way and I tried them all! Most dvds feel to lazy burning this one. Working on your legs when with a support of a barre can creat really strong muscles without straining your abdomin or loosing form and balance.  By the third trimester my legs got so strong thanks to this workout, almost like working with weights but using your baby weight. It's awesome!

I like to mix both DVD's. The cardio segment on both are just the best thing you can do to yourself.",1506470400,4,603,4.375
