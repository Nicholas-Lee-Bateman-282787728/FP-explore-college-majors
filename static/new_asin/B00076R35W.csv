8393232,3,B00076R35W,"I purchased this DVD in order to gain some background information about yoga, its history and application.  I hoped it would help me find an appropriate yoga program, not one with a ""gimic"" like weight loss.  In that respect, the DVD delivered.  Unfortunately, it is homemade with a video camera and is quite amateurish.  In several places, the sound is either garbled or masked by distortions.  If you are looking for general, background information and can get past the techinical issues, this is a good DVD for you to try.",1204588800,,525,4.788888888888889
