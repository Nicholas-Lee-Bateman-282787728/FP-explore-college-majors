906042,3,6304652747,"Your enjoyment of this film will probably depend on how many traditional martial arts films you've seen before, as it attempts to poke fun (pretty successfully) at the cliches of such films.
Chan plays a young man lacking any Kung Fu skills, but possessing highly developed chaos skills. Everywhere he goes he inadvertantly causes people to die and as the film progresses he builds up quite a list of enemies. After a chance encounter with an old beggar (who is naturally also a Kung Fu master) Jackie gets the chance to learn some Kung Fu, but only if he does an errand first.
The errand turns out to be protecting a transport of treasure (by the beggar's nephew) from bandits. Chan's bumbling results in the nephew getting near fatally injured so the exasperated beggar gives him a book of Kung Fu to learn from. Within about a day Chan is an accomplished martial artist. This is fortunate as all the bandits decide to attack at once and the inevitable mass fight at the end occurs.
Very funny in places (like when Chan, in mid-battle, rips the fake moustache of one of the cheesy bad guys) but offering more to the veteran martial arts fan than a newcomer.",992217600,6,1159,4.603864734299517

This here movie reminded me of the time when my good friend Mr Pinkus killed a man known as ned  yeti(who was hairy like a beast), in order to avenge the death of his third  cousin(once removed) Mr Golden.

906045,4,6304652747,This was one of Jackie's first crazy films.  It is difficult to understand at times but man it can be funny.  Jackie plays a wanderer who wants to be a kung fu master and slowly learns the ropes from variouse teachers and  masters.  A good classic to have.  Arm the Homeless,916876800,,274,4.294117647058823

This dvd version has an english and cantonese track, but no subtitles unlike it says in the description. I requested a refund because even though the dub isn't bad, I want to see it in a chinese and subtitled version as well.",1516665600,,346,4.672131147540983

7875465,4,6304652747,"One of Jackie Chan's first movies where he was allowed to play a role that fit his persona, Half a Loaf of Kung Fu is a very amusing early kung fu parody, originally made in 1978. Jackie Chan plays a beggar with laughable kung fu abilities who progressively learns and practices with mentors such as a strange man who farts a lot, a creepy old man, and lots of pieces of paper. After pretending to be a skillful and respected kung fu hero, he receives a variety of different receptions from the various people he meets.

There is a dream sequence in which Chan eats some greens and then becomes powerful - a rather explicit Popeye reference; there is a great fight scene in which he is on top of a structure, and his pursuers are below. They tell him to come down, and he tells them to come up. In the end, they both move towards each other in mutual agreement.

The first half or so is a bit slow, but then it picks up speed and gains some direction. Overall, it is a fun early kung fu parody with great fight scenes and amusing (but not too frequent) dialogue. The sound effects and music are both fun and silly. Recommended for fans of kung fu movies, physical humor, parodies, and Jackie Chan in general. Here's to 100 years in the business.",1340323200,,1245,4.339055793991417
7875466,5,6304652747,"If you are a Jackie Chan fan this is a must. This spoof of kung fu films  displays Jackie's great sense of humor and love for comedic action. Unfortunately this movie sat on a shelf for many years until after Jackie became a big star. Its humor is quite crude at times and the plot is kind of goofy, but it will make you laugh out loud. It is great to see a young Jackie in action doing what he loves to do.",1230422400,,407,3.9036144578313254
7875467,5,6304652747,"Great action and comedy mixed together in this classic Jackie Chan movie!
5 star rating",1212969600,,87,4.866666666666666
7875468,4,6304652747,"Frustrated by the weak box office returns of New Fist of Fury and Shaolin Wooden Men, Lo Wei gave Jackie Chan creative control over the slapstick comedy Half a Loaf of Kung Fu. With Chan's friend Chen Chi-hwa as director (Snake and Crane Arts of Shaolin), Jackie wanted to make a film that was the antithesis of the current martial art dramas that were being shown. Jackie called this movie a ""ninety-minute-long practical joke,"" but Lo failed to find the humor and decided to vault this film and created his own comedy for Jackie the insipid Spiritual Kung Fu. Half a Loaf of Kung Fu would remain unwatched until 1980.

One of the most interesting segments of the film is the beginning which parodies the normal use (at that time) of the main actors showcasing their martial-art ability. He spoofs the Zatochi series, he tries to catch arrows but fails and there is a great scene that has him using a fighting dummy for practice only the have the camera pan away to reveal a mini dummy. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is not as inventive as the starting sequence, though there are many good scenes. The problem is that the plot is not that different from many other films that Lo Wei has done.

Jackie plays Gon Tou, a wandering hungry man in search of a job. He eventually gets a housekeeper position for Mr. Man who houses the witch Lady Mui. He spies on her while she was doing a poison experiment, inadvertently gets his new friend San killed and narrowly flees. After his escape he came across a fight between Se Tai Chung and Lao Yung Lung - the man with the whip. This battle resulted in the death of both and Gon assumed the identity of Master Lao to collect the bounty on Chung. Now Gon is mistaken for a man with fighting skills even though his combatant acumen is very small. He gets beat up quite a bit.

He stumbles across a flatulent beggar (Dean Shek) who teaches Jackie such moves as ""Lady Draws Arrow"" and the ever impressive ""One Finger Stops Mountain"" (guess which finger.) Dean is funny in this Cantonese comedic role. Gon is then helped by another beggar (Lee Man Tai) who prevents Lady Mui from killing him. At first the beggar does not want to help Gon anymore, but he acquiesces and will help him if he takes something to Fong Wan. He later meets him at Fung Yu's Stone House with his daughter (Doris Lung) and friend (James Tien.) Together they are protecting the ""Thousand Year Jake"", which cures any poison, and ""Potion of new Life"" which is the fountain of youth. Since these are so powerful and priceless many criminals such as Lady Mui, Iron Hand Lui and The Man of a Thousand Faces (Kam Kong) want these. Gon helps Fong while learning more and more Kung Fu.

The plot is a bit chaotic and it ultimately fails as a spoof because so many martial art films have had plots much more ridiculous then this movie. But, it is an important film in Jackie's career because it is a turn from the grim-faced stoic hero that Lo wanted him to be. It is also a funny film with many inventive, though sometimes broad, scenes such as a dream sequence with Jackie becoming Popeye or Jackie reading a manual while fighting. It is also hilarious when Jackie knows that the flatulent beggar is approaching before we even see him. There is also a great reference to Bruce Lee when Jackie uses a wig as nunchucks while making Bruce-like sounds.

The fighting of the film is much more traditional, with the exception of the nunchuck wig, than Jackie's later films. But there are some good shots, especially the ten-minute ending fight scene. There is also a nice teaming of Dean and Jackie towards the end that was fun to watch. Overall, I like the film. It was better than the early Jackie Chan movies, though not as good as his later films. If you are a Jackie Chan film and have not seen it, then there is a good chance you will like it -- as long as you like flatulent beggars and goofy plots.",1162944000,5,3910,4.462937062937063
7875469,1,6304652747,"If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting Jackie Chan's movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to ""Americanize"" and ""Control"". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way ENTIRE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to ""French version"" or ""Chinese Version"" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap ""American version"" then~! LOL",1139097600,3,924,4.8544303797468356
7875470,4,6304652747,"""Half a Loaf of Kung Fu"" is probably one of my favorites out of Jackie Chan's earlier movies.  There are several funny fight scenes, and the actual Kung Fu is pretty decent.  The movie is not at all serious as it is poking fun at movies in the genre that came out around the same time.  I would definitely recommend this movie to any fan of Jackie Chan.",994550400,4,353,4.161764705882353
