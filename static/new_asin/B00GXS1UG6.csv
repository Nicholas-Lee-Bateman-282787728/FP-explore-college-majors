8628511,5,B00GXS1UG6,"I have three children ages 6,3 and 1 and they all LOVE this video! When the kids are at the preschool they get up and dance or parade around the rug- my kids do the same thing at home.
The other amazing thing is I can't believe how much of the Chinese they have picked up.  My 3 and 6 year old can definitely count to 10 in Chinese and also they especially love the outdoor songs in the playground.  They have so much fun singing along.",1387324800,,436,4.0
8628512,5,B00GXS1UG6,"My favorite story is at one point in the video the kids are learning the names of vegetables and the teacher hands each of them a carrot.  My daughter ran to our refrigerator and managed to find and pull out her own carrot so she could join in the fun at home!  That's how engaging it is!!!  She also loves watching the other kids on the video -- she even knows them all by name and now refers to them as her ""Dumplings friends"".  I think the other reason my daughter really loves this video is that she is obsessed with music and this video is filled with songs that she already knows -- except they are in Chinese!  She finds that so intriguing and watches with such focus and attention!  When she heard ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" for the first time in this different language, she was immediately entranced.  The video also features ""Ten Little Indians"" and ""This Old Man"" (among many others!) which are songs she's known since she was a baby!  She loves it!!",1387324800,,965,4.4124293785310735
8628513,5,B00GXS1UG6,"You can totally tell this was conceived by a mom. They really ""get"" kids -- what they respond to, and how to hold their attention for learning. The toothbrushing song is particularly genius! Not only does my son love watching the song -- especially the kids in the video brushing their teeth -- he also now knows it and loves to sing it when he brushes his own teeth! Toothbrushing with him has always been a battle, now he does it HAPPILY while singing a song! That is worth WAY more than the cost of this video! It's only been 2 weeks of the singing and brushing so we'll see if it lasts, but I have to say, it's kind of been a life changer around our household!!",1387152000,,665,4.203125
8628514,5,B00GXS1UG6,"A great supplement even if you are already speaking Mandarin to your kids.
I have 3 year old twin girls.  I'm a native Mandarin speaker and am raising my kids bilingual.  I try to talk to them in Mandarin as much as possible so they are definitely exposed, but I think this video is a great supplement to that.  My daughters definitely love the songs and games, and also they really seem to enjoy watching the other kids in the program!  For me, I love that they can see there are other children learning and speaking Mandarin too -- so they can see it's something that lots of kids do!  Their favorite part of the video is the HELLO song.  The teacher sings hello to all the kids who reply with their names, and then she sings hello to the ""audience"".  My girls always shout out their names as loud as they can!",1387152000,,812,4.26797385620915
8628515,5,B00GXS1UG6,"As a native Mandarin speaker, I really appreciate the accuracy in pronunciation on the part of the teacher.  I have a number of these Mandarin videos for my kids, and sometimes the pronunciation is shockingly inaccurate!  The teacher here is totally adorable and her Chinese is perfect!  Another pet peeve of mine is a lot of times with language videos like this, the picture quality is really poor and can look shaky or the sound is bad or hollow/cheesy sounding.  This video is the opposite of that.  It's not cheesy at all.  It's clean and simple, but really well done.  It is a high quality product that I would definitely recommend!",1386979200,,637,4.684684684684685
8628516,5,B00GXS1UG6,"This video is adorable and so much fun! My 2 1/2 year old is obsessed with it and asks to watch it over and over. He especially loves to find what he calls the ""secret dumpling"" (a dumpling logo which flies by the screen throughout the program) and he squeals with delight every time he sees it! I have to say the first week he was watching it, he was glued to the program and I could tell he definitely liked it, but I wasn't sure if he was really taking in any of the Chinese. Then the 2nd week over lunch he turns to me and says he has ""san"" carrots on his plate. I was a little confused at first and said what are ""san carrots""? He tells me ""Mama, that's Chinese for three! Yi, er, san carrots!"" I couldn't believe it!!! Whatever they're doing, it works!",1386806400,2,758,4.093959731543624
8628517,5,B00GXS1UG6,"I am a parent who had my child enrolled in the Little Dumplings Nursery that this video is based on.  That program was so special and put together with such care -- sweet and nurturing and so much fun.  It was always my daughter's favorite place to go -- and she learned so much Mandarin!  The most amazing part is neither my husband or I speak Mandarin so I know everything they learned was really from this school.  I was so delighted to find that the specialness and spirit of the program is actually captured in this video.  The presentation seems very simple -- but it's the clarity with which the words are presented, and the amount of repetition that is used that really clicks with the children.  They almost have it down to a science.  My daughter has a little brother now (3 years old) and when I played the video for him, he was mesmerized just the way my daughter used to be in class.  After only 5 or 6 viewings he is already speaking many of the words and singing a few of the songs!  It's just a warm, loving, and very effective program that I'm so happy I can now play it for my child whenever I want it.  I can't wait til they come out with the next volume!",1386806400,3,1174,4.200892857142857
