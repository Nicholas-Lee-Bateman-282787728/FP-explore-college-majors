8095158,2,6304952279,"There is no spirituality in this whole video. He is just a magician nothing else. There are more consumers for miracles rather than spiritual thoughts or teaching that is why he is so popular. He he just preach nobody listen to him, in order to gain people trust you need to do some magic stuff and prove you are godly like person. Hinduism says if you do good thing then your re-birth cycle will be stopped but he himself says he is re-birth of Siridi Sai Baba, who himself was the greatest son of god. If he can not break the cycle of rebirth, or complete his desire to be in this world then how any common man like us can break this re-birth cycle.",1160092800,,651,4.216
8095159,2,6304952279,"Doesn't let one know much about this godman but it does well in showing the feats performed by him.
Now I know why people are attracted to him like houseflies.",1036972800,4,159,4.333333333333333
8095160,2,6304952279,This video lets me know about his amazing feats than other things about him.  I will look for other books/video to know more about this man.,989193600,7,140,4.384615384615385
8095161,2,6304952279,This video shows the miracles performed by Sai Baba and I am truly impressed.  But I am more looking to know his beliefs and teachings which are not covered in detail in this video.,988761600,5,181,4.323529411764706
8095162,2,6304952279,Looks like this video is more like trying to convince people that Sai Baba is no ordinary human and convert viewers to devotees... this is the impression I get and does not provide a lot of info on the man.  Very disappointing.,987897600,19,227,4.404761904761905
8095163,2,6304952279,"I would consider the title to be a serious mismatch to the contents of the video.  It should preferably by ""Miracles of Sai Baba"".  In order for it to be ""Man of Miracles -- Satya Sai Baba"", the video should have show some of the miracles but MORE about Sai Baba. Viewers who are keen to know about the teachings, beliefs and detailed life of Sai Baba would be disappointed.
What this video concentrates on is showing the so-called miracles of Sai Baba and I think its aim is more on convincing viewers that this is no ordinary man based on the miracles shown.  In a way, it is perhaps trying to make the viewer think that this is a godman or even god.  The video does not enable the curious viewer know about the background and detailed life history of Sai Baba.
So if you want to know more about Sai Baba, this video will be disappointing and there is more available on the WWW on him than in the video.",987465600,,905,4.244186046511628
