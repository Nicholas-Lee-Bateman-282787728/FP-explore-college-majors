4174193,5,B003R0MESG,And the saga of the Winslow's and Urkel comes to an end sadly without a real ending because there was supposed to be a tenth season....I didn't really like alot of the later seasons cause of Urkel becoming the main focus but there were some funny episodes during this season only with that it got a proper ending with Laura and Steve getting married though I would of liked that they stayed friends and they brought Judy back.......,1501718400,,432,4.551282051282051
4174194,5,B003R0MESG,"I  like  the  last  season.
Both  seasons  8  &  9.  The  funniest  seasons  in  the  entire  series.
Urkel  is  at  his  best  in  this  season.  Myra  &  Steve  break  up,  &  it  is  the  very  beginning  of  Steve  &  Laura  coming  together.
The  other  stuff  as  far  as  (Jo Maurie  Payton Noble)  leaving  the  show  is  a  hard  thing  to  accept.  &  being  replaced  by  (Judy Ann Elder).  Jo Maurie Payton  Noble  will  always  be  the  better  actor.
The  good  thing  I  can  say  about  this  last  season  is  we  do  get  to  see  (Thelma Hopkins)  Rachael  in  one  episode.
The  Christmas  episode.  &  Steve  Urkel,  it  seems  like  he's  at  his  very  best  in  some  episodes.  2  of  my  favorites  are  (They  shoot  Ducks  don't  they)  &  (Throw  Steve  from  the  train)  (A  mind  is  a  terrible  thing  to  read)..........  How  can  you  not  enjoy  this  season?  I  laugh  at  just  about  every  episode.
I  was  disappointed  that  family  matters  didn't  go  any  further.
Also  I  want  to  say  that  seasons  5-9  do  not  have  subtitles  or  closed  captioning  for  the  hearing  impaired.
They  should  though!",1499904000,,1157,4.278074866310161

4174269,5,B003R0MESG,"For me it's a fitting send off to a amazing series. Family Matters to me was the epitome of my childhood. A show that tackled the cheesiness of life and yet tackled the important things in life and what we grow through in the struggle we call life. Summing up this season it saw a major change in the character Steve Urkel that finally got the attention of someone very important to him. Also it showed Eddie finally choosing a career in his life and the Winslow family's trials and tribulations with the clumsy and yet likable nerd.  This show sadly saw the departure of Jo Marie Payton as Harriet Winslow in the latter half of the series and replaced by Judyann Elder to finish off the series. In the end this show ultimately taught us that threw anything that we go through in life we just have to remember that ""Family Matters"" most in the end.",1465862400,5,848,4.401273885350318
4174270,5,B003R0MESG,One of the best shows ever.,1463270400,2,27,3.6666666666666665
8402916,5,B003R0MESG,"I had previously purchased the first four seasons in a store. Later, when they became available, I purchased seasons 5-9 from Amazon to complete my set. They were absolutely flawless! I forgot how much I loved the show until I rewatched and experienced every hilarious, heartfelt, and even heartbreaking, moment all over again. I loved watching Family Matters as a child with my sister and parents.",1525564800,,398,5.045454545454546
8402917,4,B003R0MESG,"Family Matters is my all-time favorite show to watch, but this 9th season is the very last season I don't like for a simple reason, so I wouldn't buy or get this 9th season to watch on the DVD set. But I do have the first eight seasons though, and those are the seasons that I just like, so I would just stick with watching the first eight seasons of Family Matters that I just like and have on the DVD sets. I feel that the first eight seasons of Family Matters is good enough for me to watch anyway.

Now for the simple reason why I don't like this 9th season of Family Matters and wouldn't buy or get it to watch on the DVD set, it's because of actress Jo Marie Payton as the original (Harriette) no longer being on the show or in the last half set of episodes, and there's 22 episodes from this 9th season. And the last nine episodes from this 9th season then has new actress Judyann Elder playing (Harriette), and I don't want to see or know those last nine episodes with her playing (Harriette). I feel that it would make me sad and unhappy to see those last nine episodes with Judyann Elder playing (Harriette) from this 9th season, and I like Jo Marie Payton as (Harriette) alot better. And it would even be a waste of money for me to buy this whole 9th season of Family Matters on the DVD set with Judyann Elder playing (Harriette) in the last nine episodes, and I don't want to see her. I find that Jo Marie Payton was the better (Harriette) and had more character on the show, playing a mother and Carl's wife, but Judyann Elder from this 9th season was nothing like her, so Jo Marie Payton is who I would just want to know as (Harriette) on Family Matters. All the other stuff that goes on in this 9th season really doesn't matter to me, and I can do without watching the first half set of episodes. The first half set of episodes out of 22 from this 9th season does show Jo Marie Payton still being on the show before leaving, but I would still do without watching them, because the first eight seasons of Family Matters is good enough for me to watch, and Jo Marie Payton left the show in this 9th season for one fact. So that's why I say that I would just stick with watching the first eight seasons of Family Matters that I just like, and do without watching this 9th season.

From the 5th season of Family Matters, there is one episode that Judyann Elder played in as a nun and as (Sister Bernadette), and that episode is ""Nunsense"". Now I have to say that I don't mind seeing Judyann Elder play that whole character from that one episode and from the 5th season, because that episode ""Nunsense"" is still a good episode to watch with Jaleel White and all the other main characters, and the 5th season of Family Matters is still a good season for me to watch. But seeing Judyann Elder play Jo Marie Payton's character as (Harriette) in the last nine episodes from this 9th season is not something I want to see.

Jaleel White is the main character of the whole show playing (Steve Urkel) and I do like him, and he's a good actor. I even like when he plays (Stephan Urquelle) on the show. And not only do I Jaleel White on the show, but I also do like all the other main characters, including Jo Marie Payton who's my favorite. But this 9th season of Family Matters is just not a good season for me to watch. Family Matters is still my all-time favorite show to watch though, but just from the first eight seasons.

There is a 2006 movie with Jaleel White that I do have on a DVD, and it's called ""Who Made The Potatoe Salad?"". And that 2006 movie is something good to watch with Jaleel White. So instead of me having this 9th season of Family Matters that I don't like and wouldn't buy to watch, I would stick with having that 2006 movie to watch with Jaleel White, and I would watch it after watching him from the first eight seasons of Family Matters that I just like and have on the DVD sets. And I do have that 2006 movie ""Who Made The Potatoe Salad?"" with Jaleel White added with the seasons as well.

There is also a way TV shows and episodes can be watched on the internet, and I sure wouldn't even watch any episodes of Family Matters from this 9th season on the internet, even the first half set of episodes out of 22 with Jo Marie Payton, before leaving the show. And neither on the TV channel, I would watch any episodes of Family Matters from this 9th season. Now that Family Matters has been released on the DVD sets and that I just have the first eight seasons to watch, it wouldn't even make sense for me to watch the show on the TV channel anymore, and I used to always watch Family Matters whenever I saw it come on the TV channel. And I've seen all 22 episodes from this 9th season before.

Jo Marie Payton is one of my favorite characters on Family Matters, playing the original (Harriette). And I read something on the internet saying that she left the show halfway through this 9th season, because she wanted something else to do, which is what I can understand. But I can still watch just the first eight seasons of Family Matters that I have and just like to remember her as (Harriette). And I also read something saying that Jo Marie Payton recorded a jazz album that came out in 1999 called ""Southern Shadows"", and I think that's something else she wanted to do after she left the show halfway through this 9th season. And I do have that jazz album by Jo Marie Payton, and that's something I'd rather have to listen to with her singing, instead of having this 9th season of Family Matters that I don't like and wouldn't buy to watch. So there's two replacement items for me to have and for this 9th season of Family Matters that I don't like and wouldn't buy to watch, and it's the jazz album by Jo Marie Payton and the 2006 movie ""Who Made The Potatoe Salad?"" with Jaleel White, and those are two good replacement items for me to have and for this 9th season of Family Matters that I don't like and wouldn't buy to watch.

And with me just watching the first eight seasons of Family Matters with Jo Marie Payton playing (Harriette), it would be like she never left the show and never got a divorce with Reginald Veljohnson as (Carl), who she was married to on the show, because Jo Marie Payton was on Family Matters throughout the first eight seasons. And like I said, the first eight seasons of Family Matters is good enough for me to watch.",1521331200,3,6384,4.284175642087821
