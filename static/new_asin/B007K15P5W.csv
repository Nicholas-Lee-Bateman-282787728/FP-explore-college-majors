Diana Paul has produced an amazing collection of births that show how natural a process it is to birth at home, in a comfortable, quiet, controlled environment. This is an excellent resource for educating moms-to-be, whether they choose to birth at home, or whether they take (with the help of a partner or doula) these relaxation techniques and coping mechanisms into the hospital to make it a less fearful, more empowering experience. Diana has captured the natural, safe, and sacred age-old phenomenon of the birth experience in a remarkable way!",1379203200,,590,5.030612244897959
8518568,5,B007K15P5W,"Five Countries, Six Births, Seven Babies is a film with five short segments depicting birth in a beautiful, gentle, sacred light. With births from all over the world including France, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Bermuda and the USA, the film shows that cultures, laws and languages change but the sacred act of birth does not. Without words, the films speak for themselves through music and images. Diana Paul filmed all of the segments over a period of years from 1994 to 2010 and then put them all together to make Five Countries, Six Births, Seven Babies in 2012. Each segment tells a story and, I think, each has details that can be noted and learned from by all women.

I loved that the midwife in ""Barret"" was attentive to the emotional as well as physical needs of the mother while still guarding the mother's space and ensuring things were still normal and safe. ""Luna"" is one of my favorites as it shows the involvement of the mother's first child and the transition of welcoming this new baby. And who doesn't love a candle lit water birth? ""Children of the Maya"" only has people speaking in Spanish and is the sweet story of two families welcoming their babies with traditional midwives in Guatemala. I loved seeing the prenatal visit and how the father planned to support the mother. One birth was in an upright position but the other was supine and the midwife had gloves on. I wonder if this was from some sort of Western medical influence? ""Twins"" shows such wonderful support through out the birth from all who are present. That mama must have had some great nutrition prenatally to have twins born in the caul! What an amazing miracle to witness. Side note- I'm wondering why the cords were cut so quickly though? ""Birth Bermuda Style"" is a beautiful story of a doula, student midwife, advocate mother who is forging a community that supports home birth in Bermuda. Her water birth is as lovely as she is and you'll just have to watch it to get all the details!

""It really should be a woman's choice about where she has that very intimate experience [of birth]. It is an extension of her life, her intimate life and it should be honored and respect. And if that is honored and respected, then it will impact her emotional and physical life for the rest of her life. We need to take this seriously."" ~Sophia, mother in Birth Bermuda Style

The short segments in  Five Countries, Six Births, Sven Babies all put together show different kinds of women dealing with the intimate experience of birth in different ways and with different support for a truly unique and beautiful message. This would be a great addition to childbirth preparation classes, medical training, doula and midwifery schools and to every young woman's view of birth.",1358899200,2,2748,4.706860706860707
8518569,5,B007K15P5W,"This is a DVD not to miss! There is nothing better and safer and neater than homebirth. I am so glad to have ""5 countries, 6 births, 7 babies"" in my collection. It is another exquisite homebirth documentary produced and directed by the 5 star, amazing videographer, Diana Paul.

Birth is the most sacred miracle of life, and indeed as the Arab saying goes, ""Heaven is Under the Feet of Mothers"".

In this DVD, women, from different countries with different cultures and habits, deal naturally with birth in the comfort of their own homes. I am more and more convinced that giving birth is safer, happier and more empowering at home.",1338336000,2,632,4.684684684684685
