That there were a people there, who were terrorized, transferred, cleansed is not omitted....rather Gitai carefully INCLUDES the obliteration of a people and the scourge against them for the past 60 years and more. He views both peoples suffering with compassion while ensuring that the oppression of Palestinians is not mythologized/evaporated into yet another heroic myth of colonization. Gitai worked with Wim Wenders on ""Wings of Desire"" which is story of the yearning of the human heart for its beloved. KEDMA which comes a decade later in Gitai's career is more wholistic and fluid.",1113091200,,942,5.414965986394558
