8645716,5,B00IVLR9VI,"This series is EXCELLENT!  For those people that think this series might be a downer , it's not at all.  The realism and sincerity are genuine.  To see what effort it takes to ""fit "" back into the America they fought for shows the real hero that is in each and every one of them.
God bless them all.  We are so blessed to share this world with them.",1400544000,,349,4.0144927536231885
