8094850,2,B000BZITB6,"I learned that Stravinsky lived in many places.  He had an affair with Coco Chanel.  He didn't like others to hear him composing.

Still, this work was quite dull.  He lived in a time of moving images, yet all one sees here are photos of him.  They show moving images of the places where he lived, but that wasn't enough.  The narrator had a boring voice.  You can't show this to a high school music class because they'll sleep through it.

Further, the work never says what composition made him famous.  It seemed like out of nowhere, he was a celebrity.  I wish this had said more about ""The Rites of Spring"" and the Ballets Russes.",1200009600,4,634,4.387931034482759
