3731628,4,B001OQ9A1Y,Such a great location. Please do more and focus on scenery. Very enjoyable from my Shanghai living room with no crazy traffic!,1368748800,,126,4.7727272727272725

3731630,5,B001OQ9A1Y,"Big Island, Big Climb is like literally riding in Hawaii. You feel like you are right in on the action. The HD video makes the scenery and road riding that much more real, as does the on-the road mic instruction. All Global ride DVDs are of the highest quality. But they just keep getting better. The original Hawaii set a standard, but this series adds that much more to the original.

The climb in this DVD is not straight up, but while it is gradual, it is very difficult. It compares beautifully to the Italy series climb, but it's longer. Again, this is one amazing climb and the scenery could not be better. This DVD has it all. Be prepared to have the time of your life while indoors. This is another great Disk to add to anyone's collection.",1368748800,,749,4.388489208633094
3731631,5,B001OQ9A1Y,"Global Ride keeps churning them out, one by one. Exceptional rides, create variety, and amazing locations. What could beat riding in Hawaii? These videos prove that Hawaii is the place to ride. Rolling, but stead hills, out of this world scenery, and an atmosphere that has it all, there impossible to beat. And they just keep getting better.",1364515200,,342,4.913793103448276
3731632,5,B001OQ9A1Y,Awesome workout with great scenery and motivational music and coaching. You can really get into and get your heart rate up. The bonus Pilates workout is nice too. Like 2 workouts in one.,1353888000,,186,4.666666666666667
3731633,3,B001OQ9A1Y,"I was so excited to receive this DVD as I love getting on my spin bike and losing myself in a virtual world.  With a good video I actually feel myself following the road, leaning as I turn, working harder on hills and just having the time pass before I know it.  This video started out  promising with beautiful scenery, although it was a bit to slow at times as though it was for a tricycle rider instead of a bike rider.  I can deal with that.  But then, suddenly, I was no longer riding down a beautiful road in Hawaii, but was going backward while a lone bicyclist was coming toward me.  Since I keep the coaching off, I have no idea what his purpose could possibly be, but it threw me out of workout mode and for the rest of the video I keep waiting for what turned out to be his frequent reappearance.  I won't do this video again as being jerked out of the riding mode to watching this guy ride was disconcerting and very irritating.  My husband did like the workout afterwards, though.",1333411200,,993,4.24468085106383
3731634,4,B001OQ9A1Y,This makes riding my stationary bike a lot more fun in the winter when its pouring rain outside and I can't hit the streets!,1325203200,,124,4.208333333333333
3731635,5,B001OQ9A1Y,"I own the whole set of the Global Ride dvd's for Hawaii and like them all, but I have used this one the most. The goal is to maintain a consistent heart rate throughout the workout and I use a heart rate monitor. I could never keep up the pace and do this without the music and coaching to keep me going. I feel great after doing it and my blood pressure is lower after doing it consistently. I find that the coaching is especially motivating, much better than cycling/spinning dvd's that just have music and scenery. I never quit early and now I'm starting to think about doing it 2 times through. While I like to ride outside, I can't always devote the time, and can do this before work.",1310083200,3,689,4.267175572519084
3731636,5,B001OQ9A1Y,"The scenery is beautiful and the encouragement from the trainer was helpful. I was able to get through a tough workout made easier by pushing myself along with the rider on the DVD. I especially love the path chosen, just the kind of place I would enjoy in Hawaii. While these scenes were from Oahu and Maui I believe,  it reminded me very much of similar favorite places of mine that I visited in Kauai, which made it all the more delightful.",1307491200,,443,4.402439024390244
3731637,5,B001OQ9A1Y,Having this DVD is great way to feel like you are actually riding on the road. It certainly makes the time go by and you don't have to worry about a flat tire!,1232496000,5,159,3.8484848484848486
8331105,5,B001OQ9A1Y,"These are exceptionally well done videos. You feel like you are on the ride with them and the view takes up most of the screen. The coaching is well done. I like the music a lot. Very motivating ride with the joy of feeling like you are in Hawaii! If you spin at home, I recommend this DVD!",1488412800,,290,4.017241379310345
8331106,2,B001OQ9A1Y,"Big Island cycling video would be so much better with good picture quality, a lot of the actual  cycling part is just a blur.",1472428800,,125,4.208333333333333
8331107,2,B001OQ9A1Y,"This is a very odd/awkward ""virtual ride"".  It's not what you'd expect.  It's a rainy/cloudy day which I could overlook but the filming is just awkward.  One minute you're looking at the people in front of you, as expected, but then suddenly you're literally looking at the car driving behind you as if you were backward on the bike.  No real scenery that you'd expect in Hawaii.  No ocean view.  Just odd.",1457568000,,406,4.569444444444445
8331108,2,B001OQ9A1Y,"Boring landscape, didn't like music much.",1456099200,,41,6.0
8331109,5,B001OQ9A1Y,"I've been spinning for about 8 years and just love the outdoor atmosphere indoors during inclement weather. What a great way to see different areas of the world too.  Thank you global ride !!!! :)
PS - your customer service is awesome!!",1386028800,,236,4.619047619047619
8331110,3,B001OQ9A1Y,The scenery is ok but the price is a bit high for what you get on the DVD.  I would have expected the scenery to be a bit more inspiring since it was filmed in Hawaii.,1383868800,,167,3.638888888888889
8331111,1,B001OQ9A1Y,"I bought this dvd based on the reviews hoping to get a decent spinning workout. Honestly I do not know what they saw, it was very boring. The entire dvd was nothing more than a car with a camera following behind 4 bicyclists. Occasionally the car would pass them and then you would watch them from the front. The ""ride"" was backed up with a pretty lame  beat. That was it! That was the entire video! Save your money. You are better off watching the travel channel. At least there are interesting things to see.",1378857600,3,510,4.368421052631579
8331112,5,B001OQ9A1Y,It sure makes inside biking more fun.  Feels like your rolling down the road in Hawaii with a group of riders.,1375920000,,110,4.238095238095238
8331113,4,B001OQ9A1Y,"I have been spinning for a number of years and have often found Global Ride's DVDs to be the best product that is out there for a spinning bike. Although, the music selection in the Hawaii series at times is a little boring and there isn't as much on screen coaching as some of the other series (such as the Spain series), the fact that there are different options on each DVD allows you to get completely different rides makes up for the music. Each ride can be customized for ability and I always find that I am getting a great workout with the series.",1369699200,,554,4.285714285714286
8331114,4,B001OQ9A1Y,"I have been a spin instructor for 3 years. The class is twice a week and using videos from Global Ride has made putting together a class a lot easier. The class truly enjoyed the outside atmosphere in doors. Especially when temps are 19 degrees and 14"" of snow on the ground outside. Adding the Class Builder Profiles is a huge help which helps show the class progression and helping them know when the cadence and exertion rate changes. Thanks again Global Ride.",1369180800,,463,4.590361445783133
