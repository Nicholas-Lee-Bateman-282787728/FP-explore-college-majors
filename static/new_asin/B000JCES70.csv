8325247,5,B000JCES70,"This is one of the best baby DVDs on the market that is sure to put a smile on your child's face.  I highly recommend the DVD for any children through the age of 3.  The babies and children used in the DVD are all adorable.  The music will make your children ""bop"" all the way through the DVD.  My one year old and three year old love to move and dance to the music.  The peek-a-boo, bubble time and the puppy chase scenes are one of their favorites.  They try to pop the bubbles along with the children in the DVD and chase the puppy.  A very entertaining baby/ toddler DVD that will capture your child's attention from beginning to end and leave a smile on their face as well as yours!!",1209772800,,688,4.12781954887218

8325249,5,B000JCES70,Our 18-month old enjoyed it and laughed throughout.  A multi-cultural group of babies and tots were featured.  The music soundtrack was well-done and our son also bopped along while he watched.  Highly Recommended.,1160092800,,214,5.424242424242424
