You will never regret that decision. The Baji dvd is well done. Having been exposed to Pigua/Baji in my youth, this is very well done. It filled in a few gaps from my previous training. Multiple angles. The demonstrations are on par as a supplement to training as it should be. If you have Northern Shaolin experience, you can learn the basic from disk. You will still need a Sifu for tweeking and fine tuning. But you will have a very solid showing of the material",1438819200,,624,4.681818181818182

There's so many training methods including internal training, post training, etc., so it's very complete. I recommend this video to those of you who practices Baji Quan martial art.",1362355200,,271,5.181818181818182
