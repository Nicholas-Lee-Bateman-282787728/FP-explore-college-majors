Silly effects, bad acting all around and that includes Dirk Benedict and Edward Albert! Nothing to work with I guess. Cheesy demon? Satan? Soooooo Bad. You have been warned.",1499990400,,300,4.901960784313726
8020445,2,B000228SLO,"Guy (Edward Albert) accidentally releases a demon that was apparently the inspiration for South Park's Satan. People die, women get naked. Voice enhancers over used. Good MST value at 71 minutes. Better film: ""Evil Toons.""

No f-bombs. Nudity (Jennifer Steyn, Catherine Loveday, Lee Kennedy, Katrina Maltby, Annette Harper)

During the closing credits the word ""witch"" is misspelled as ""with in cave""",1410134400,,400,5.540983606557377
8020446,3,B000228SLO,"During a stormy night, the occupants of a mansion are knocked off by a demon who possesses and hypnotizes the guests to kill each other in this 90s horror flick. A film like this would've been much better if it delivered the gore; unfortunately, the films low gore content is disappointing. The most graphic scene in the film is just a part when you see some quick graphic close-ups of a dog gnawing on a women's neck. Other scenes are present, but they either show little or no blood; and none of the violence is impactful  The atmosphere is decent because of the storm outside, and the mansion was a decent place to make the movie. There's a good amount of nudity in the film, and there's a scene when a nude woman is on an alter near the demon. However, the film doesn't show any full frontal nudity. Directing is around mediocre, and there's some unnecessary filler that slows down the pace. The creature looks good, but it needs a faster pace with more gore because it's the type of flick that would play well as a gore film.

This DVD is mastered from a VHS master. There's a part later on in the film when the audio goes off for around 5 or 6 seconds or so. Aside from that defect, everything else looks pretty good. The movie still would've been much better if it was mastered from a film print. The version on YOUTUBE that I saw has that audio defect and is most likely this DVD.",1392422400,,1388,4.334615384615384

More like, in each movie there is some evil, but hope you don't find this one.
Todays movie, boys and ghoulies, is called DEMON KEEPER. And DO NOT watch this one alone, you might die of bordem!!!
Now I can just see in my mind as I watched this flick, Cheryl Latimer, Joe Tornatore, and Maurice Smith the film makers sitting around having a pre-production talk. One says, ""well we have a pretty typical lack-luster script, and such and such for a budget. What should we do to make it a sellable commodity?
""Well"", said another. ""Let's get a star. Dirk Benidict, was pretty cool in Battle Star Galactica, and he's outa work since the A-Team folded. Let's spend half the budget and get him.""
""Sounds good"", says the third, ""and lets spend three quaters of what's left on a really wicked looking Demon Costume.""
""But the demon is incorporal according to the script, it doesn't have a form."",someone interjects.
""So what?!? We'll put some hot looking girls in it and get them semi nude and besides it would make a good cover. But what do we do with the rest of the budget.""
""Well, we can hired the rest of the actors and use it for production and sets and stuff like that
And so they made a movie......
I bought this flick years ago from a video store going out of business for about [money]. I'm sure it must have been the cool looking cover.
I watched it once and it sat on my video shelf for years, I never had the urge to watch it again, until one day the girl friend was picking through my movies looking for something to watch. She says, ""What's this DEMON KEEPER thing?""
And so the forces of really bad demonic movies was released once again....
The movie is pretty forgetable, although Dirk Benedict fans will love his performance as an arrogant expert on the supernatural. The Demon Costume looks cool on the cover but comes off pretty laughable when animated",1018656000,4,1917,4.448863636363637
