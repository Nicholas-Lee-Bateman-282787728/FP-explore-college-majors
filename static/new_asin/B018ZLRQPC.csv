It doesn't frustratingly cut away to the face right when you're learning a new move like some videos (Tracy Anderson's for instance) so it is easy enough to pick up.. Because there is little slowing and repetition when  new moves are introduced, one gets a better cardio workout and it is not boring. Most dance moves are similar from one video to another, so this DVD is perfect for me who does many dance videos and can readily pick up choreography. There is no down time, the pace is quick and keeps your heart rate up the whole way through  Not for those new to dance workouts as it may frustrate them.
I only took one star away because the moves often don't  jibe with the beat of the music. It would be nice to have a nice clean beat with a strong baseline to dance to. Still a very enjoyable workout.",1511049600,,933,4.381502890173411
