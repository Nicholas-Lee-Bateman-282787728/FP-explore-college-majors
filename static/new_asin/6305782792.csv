7894629,1,6305782792,"This film took the name of an earlier film starring Tony Todd. This one is just silly. Theres hardly anything even about voodoo in the film, its a boring car chase kinda thing which has about 5 minutes of ""voodoo"" performance total,. I highly reccomend you avoid this one",1118707200,6,271,4.551020408163265
7894630,1,6305782792,"I am a huge fan of New Orleans, Louisiana, and voodoo in all its glory and gore; and I was anxious to view this film.  Eventually, after I finally got through the film, I was terribly disappointed.
Madsen is not his usual  intense self; and what happened to Rosanna Arquette?  This was certainly  not a quality film - quite the opposite, a true low-budget flick.",957139200,11,362,4.523076923076923
