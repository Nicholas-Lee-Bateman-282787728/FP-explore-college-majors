2344577,5,B000A0D1KQ,"Once in a great while you discover a movie that totally redeems your faith in independent low budget horror movies. Some examples from my personal past are the original TROMA classic The Toxic Avenger, Peter Jackson's Bad Taste, Trey Parker's Cannibal The Musical, and (a lesser known, underappreciated, but equally as entertaining) Gorman Bechard's Psychos in Love. I can remember the first time I saw each of them. All original ideas with real passion behind them, you could tell that every cent of the budget was right up there on the screen. You really knew you were seeing something special and you couldn't wait to have the one friend of yours who could REALLY appreciate your particular taste in movies over to show off your new discovery, then quoting the dialogue at inappropriate times for weeks, even months later. How about a pretzel? ""Mmm...salty!""

You blind buy a movie cause the box looks cool, or has a catchy title, or the plot synopsis on the back makes it sound like no self-respecting horror fan would be caught dead without this movie in their collection, only to put it up on amazon a day later in hopes of getting a fraction of what you paid for it back. I'd say a good 99 times out of 100 that's the case. There's a lot of garbage out there in the horror DVD market, it only makes sense that a film called The Janitor would rise above it.

All the usual marketing bait is there. The box cover sucks you right in, bloody red lettering, a maniacal Lionel (the title character) waving a torn off arm above his head, and scantily clad women aplenty. Janitors are typically creepy fellows who all look capable of mass homicide (show me one who isn't, I'll show you ten who are...hey, prove me wrong!). The story summary on the back satisfies, actually exceeds, every element of what makes for a great B movie. ""...brutally murder everyone in his path..."" ""...naked college women..."" ""...a bloodbath at the sorority house..."" Believe the hype!

The movie has the look and feel of a TROMA film (even TROMA founder and creator of the Toxic Avenger Lloyd Kaufman makes an appearance) (and when I say ""the look and feel of a TROMA film"" I mean the ones they actually MAKE, not some of the schlock that they pick up for distribution). The gore starts fast and continues throughout, the dialogue is hilarious, there's always something happening. Some scenes actually defy description (there's a gratuitous love scene at the sorority house that comes to mind that'll have you asking ""how is THAT even possible!?!""). And it's one of those Spinal Tap kinda movies that gets better with repeated viewings, you pick up things you missed the first time through. So what makes it so special? It just has ""it"". The quirky charm. A rare film that delivers the promised goods. Memorable characters in unforgetable situations. It's hard to describe what ""it"" is, but you know ""it"" when you see ""it"".

Bonus materials are plentiful and (amazingly) actually entertaining. I can't tell you how many deluxe edition DVDs I bought for the special features only to find that they weren't all that special. There's a thorough making of feature that covers the early casting calls (tackling the important issues like actress willingness to do nudity) straight through to the production. And as you're watching it you're thinking these guys making it are just average guys like me...only a lot better looking. So if you're an aspiring filmmaker, you can see that it CAN be done, it IS possible to make your own movie. An entertaining commentary track is included made even moreso with the addition of alcohol. The original short film is supposedly in there too and for the life of me, I don't know why I haven't watched that yet. I'm gonna do that right now.

Get this movie! Watch it often! Then when Andy Signore and TJ Nordaker hit it big, you can sit back and be all like ""Yeah, I knew about them a few years back, did you ever see The Janitor?""  Girls will think you're so hip and want to date you.",1135296000,10,3995,4.675675675675675
2344578,5,B000A0D1KQ,"THE JANITOR is what it is - a low budget Troma style Blood, Gore and Boobies Romp - that being said - it's a great one!

The characters are memorable, the gags are totally over the top, the laughs are all over the place, and the body-count is enormous!

It's obvious watching the extras (which ELITE did a fantastic job with), that these guys didn't have much money at all, yet went out and gave it their blood, sweat and tears... their excitement for the material shines brightly, and as long as you go in expecting what it is - a gory, goofy, independent midnight movie - you should have a blast...

I have a new found respect for Custodians and I can't want to see what these guys do next!",1134950400,5,692,4.267175572519084
2344579,5,B000A0D1KQ,this has gotta to be the BEST horror film ive seen in a long time. well worth the 13 bucks it cost me and well worth the 14 times ive seen it since i got it. you cant go wrong with this purchase.,1130112000,6,195,3.558139534883721
2344580,5,B000A0D1KQ,"I don't know how anyone couldn't like this movie.  That is, unless your idea of a good horror movie is ""Scream.""

I was in a unique position while watching this movie.  I am a huge gore fan, a filmmaker, and a former part-time janitor.  As a gore fan, I enjoyed seeing all the obviously fake blood and guts being sprayed everywhere.  As a filmmaker, I could appreciate how hard these guys had to work to put together this film on a shoestring budget.  And as a former janitor, I loved seeing a fellow custodian murdering all the jerkwads that ticked him off.

And on top of that, this movie is hilarious.  The script, the performances, the subject matter, and the guest appearance by Troma's Lloyd Kaufman...all hilarious.  Even if you don't appreciate the cinematic genius that is ""The Janitor,"" at least you'll find it funny.  I showed it to a group of mainstream movie fans, and they all loved it.

I rented this movie from NetFlix a few days ago, and immediately bought it after watching it.  I can't wait for their next movie to come out, and according to Andy Signore (I emailed him to tell him how great it was), it sounds like it's going to be another winner.

Give this movie a chance.  Help some really talented filmmakers continue making amazing movies.",1127779200,10,1264,4.56

2344582,4,B000A0D1KQ,"""THE JANITOR"" is by far the very best low-budget goooofy gore fest that i've seen since the likes of Peter Jackson's ""BAD TASTE"" or even Periceles lewnes ""REDNECK ZOMBIES"". This brandnew gem is most certainly destine for ultra cult status!  A NEW FAVORITE OF MINE,I LOVED IT!",1126915200,9,275,4.851063829787234
2344583,4,B000A0D1KQ,"The Janitor is an independent horror film produced and directed by Andy Signore and TJ Nordaker. The film is about a custodian named Lionel who works at the Generico Corperation building along with his friend and mentor Mr. Growbo. Lionel is treated like crap by his co-workers, and he gets them back by killing them in a brutal way. Lionel gets lucky when he meets a bunch of sorority girls at a bar, and offers him a job. But when Lionel thinks everything is going his way, something happens and now he must get his revenge.

Although this is a horror film, this is also a true comedy at heart. With loveable characters and great dialogue, not to mention fun the T&A! This movie was written very well, and the special make up fx are awesome. If you are a fan blood and gore, then you will definatly enjoy this movie because it is filled with tons and I mean TONS of blood and gore. I think the best word to call it is 'Gorefest!'. This film has decapitations and alot of bone crushing action, not to mention alot of ripped off body parts. The film starts and ends well. The film isn't slow paced, and the way everything runs seems perfect. Which is good news to all of you with short attention spans. The characters in this movie are awesome. I really didn't have much of a problem with the acting since most of the performances were good. In this situation the good definatly outweighs the bad.

Andy Signore plays the leading role as Lionel, the big killer in the movie. Although Lionel has a bad temper and tends to kill everyone who treats him badly, he is also a sympathetic character. Bruce Cronander co-stars as Mr. Growbo, the character in the film who is also a custodian. He is like a father figure to Lionel. Fiona MacIntyre plays Lionel's love interest in the film. Skip Pipo plays the role of Page, the FBI Agent who is in search of the ""killer"". Agent Page is my favorite character in the movie. Hes the kind of guy that doesn't get a clue, hes pretty much the idiotic character in the movie. Hes one of the big comic relief characters which had me laughing alot. Another great character in the film is Lionels boss, who happens to be a man obsessed with STD's (hahaha). I loved the dialogue in this film. Like I said before this film is very well written, and the dialogue is filled with smart jokes and alot of fun sexual humor.

This film is definatly a comedy at heart. The dialogue is funny, some of the characters are funny, but also some of the bloody situations are just pretty damn hilarious. I swear I clapped throughout the entire film. It gives you the same feeling when you watch one of Peter Jacksons old films. Over the top gore mixed with smart comedy. I also like the fact that this movie is different from all the other stuff we have been seeing lately. With big budget movie companies nowadays, its hard to come up with something new and original. Which is why we are seeing more and more remakes. This movie definatly shows that there still is room for new ideas. Maybe those big budget companies should pay more attention to the Independent film makers. I definatly appreciate the indpendent genre and I hope that in the near future more indie films turn out more like this one. So yeah when it comes to the comedy and gore, its all great. The gore and sexual humor should please any hardcore horror fan.

Oh man did I have a ball watching this movie. From beginning to end its very entertaining. The Janitor is smart, funny, grotesque and is something every horror fan should see. If you haven't seen it yet then I highly recommend that you pick it up. Gather with some friends and have a small party cuss this is a great, fun and very enjoyable independent film. If you like your horror mixed with humor, then you won't feel cheated with this movie.",1124582400,16,3788,4.438218390804598
2344584,5,B000A0D1KQ,"This movie is a must see!! For anyone that enjoys a healthy mix of humor, blood, guts, boobies, disembowelment and appendages being ripped off, buy it now! The filmmakers do an excellent job of hiding the fact that they were on a tight budget. The effects are on par, if not better than some of the best indy film has to offer. The filmmakers also do double duty by starring in the film. John as Willis is hilarious, Andy as Lionel is perfect, and TJ's cameo gets a really good laugh. Speaking of cameos, Lloyd Kaufman (you know, the TROMA guy!) has a great running joke in the film.

With a feature length documentary, deleted scenes, alternate ending, drunken commentary, and the original short film that inspired the movie, this disc is packing a ton of features for the price. Like I said before, Buy It Now!!!",1122940800,13,814,4.537414965986395

8071056,5,B000A0D1KQ,"The Janitor is a wonderful B-movie, with an emphasis on BLOOD and BOOBS.  Nothing says it shouldn't be.  If you are a fan of independent film made by filmmakers who love the very genre their freshman entry is a part of, then this deserves your support.  Is the production value on the low side?  Of course, but it is much higher than the budget probably was.  If you know what you are getting into and love that sort of thing, then you'll find this a gem in an otherwise over-saturated genre.",1378857600,2,492,4.362637362637362

8071058,3,B000A0D1KQ,"I pretty good dvd horror film, the film is about a janitor who kills his co-workers when they wrong him. It has humor,gore(LOTS of it) but not alot of T&A like another reveiwer said(almost none accually except for 2 scenes). This is a very bloodly film so if you are not into that then you may not like this. Watch for a cameo by Troma's Lloyd Kaufman as a drunk hobo. When the janitors dream job is taken from him by someone he trusted,he must go out and get bloodly revenge. Good humar, lots of gore and a pretty good story make this a movie any horror fan should own on dvd, especially if your a fan of any Troma film.",1289865600,3,621,4.140495867768595

But for a NO BUDGET movie... ah what am I saying, not even worth the price for the gore, and this is coming from someone who is very forgiving, save your money (I wish I had) and buy something like REPO! The Genetic Opera! You'll Have a much more fulfilling experience!!!",1233964800,,445,4.439024390243903

It's hilarious, gory, acting is good most of the time, and all time just sick! this movie is definatly worth buying for the cheap price it is at, and all the things included on the dvd. It's basically a comedy horror that shows how janitors or CUSTODIANS are treated like crap, and they want revenge, the main janitor kills so many people, it is soooo funny. definatly buy this, or at least watch it somehow, i loved it. it's the type of movie that i could watch over and over and still laugh and love.",1136073600,7,590,4.139130434782609
