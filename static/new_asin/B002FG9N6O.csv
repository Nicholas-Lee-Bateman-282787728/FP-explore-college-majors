8369053,5,B002FG9N6O,"Loved it!  What fun!  This groundhouse memory is a must for film buffs.  It recaptures the grind-in-the-house of the 1970s and 80s.  Just the fact that a group of movie-makers can recreate this genre is spectacular.  It is an art if done deliberately.  Thirty or forty years ago it was incidental.  This has all of the components of a grindhouse...sex, violence, bizarre subject matter, and the corniest script on the planet.  It's quite good...thoroughly entertaining.  Kudos to director Brian Skiba and to actress Laurie Love.  I want more!",1291075200,4,542,5.056818181818182
8369054,4,B002FG9N6O,"I don't think this was intended to be a 'good' film... and it isn't.  It is, however, entertaining thanks to glorious overacting, explosions, and lots of miscellaneous gore.  Fine highbrow cinema it ain't, but it will make you chuckle.  Plus, ya know, Ron Jeremy is in it.  Giggity.",1268784000,6,282,4.8125
8369055,5,B002FG9N6O,"Blood Moon Rising is an amazing independent film set somewhere in California. The year is 1969. An ancient curse has spilled over into the world of the ordinary living, with werewolves, vampires, and zombies shedding bucketloads of blood. In short, Tristan (our vampire) is not a bad guy despite his undead status, and he was in love with a girl named Lucy. Tristan's former wife, the daughter of the Devil, doesn't take the news of Tristan's love affair with Lucy very well, and she curses Lucy to become a ravenous werewolf roaming the Earth for all eternity...that is, unless a silver bullet pierces her heart and kills her. Lucy's death brings the daughter of the Devil back from Hell. She returns not just for revenge, but to find a talisman, which, together with a book bound in human flesh and inked in blood (yes, a bit like Evil Dead in that regard, I know) that, if finished by the hand of an unwilling virgin, will unleash Hell on Earth. So, it is up to a hippie chick, Sadie Hawkins, and a comic book-reading soda Jerk, Darrel Lee, to save the world, but not without a little help from a group of indie film rejects shooting a zombie flick in a town called Desolation. To see who wins, and how, you will simply have to get your hands on a copy. Besides, I don't want to ruin it for those of you who are stoked about this film.

Blood Moon Rising is shot in the old Grindhouse horror style. It's not just horror, though. All in all, it is a horror comedy and action adventure, with a feel not too dissimilar to Rodriguez's Planet Terror. The actors do a phenomenal job. The effects, though not top notch, are far from cheesy. And the ones that are cheesy are meant to be that way. In this movie everything is deliberate, even when the dialog stops and the actors mouths are still moving, or when you can't hear what is being said (which only happens in two or three brief parts), or when the screen flares out into that burning reel effect and catapults the watcher to another scene entirely.

If I had to rate Blood Moon Rising on any sort of horror scale, I would give it ten out of ten skulls. And I don't do that with too many films. In fact, I almost never do that. But this one definitely deserves its due credit as a modern Grindhouse masterpiece.

Enjoy!",1260230400,6,2273,4.4071428571428575
8369056,5,B002FG9N6O,"We saw this movie at the International Horror Film Festival. This is not a ""slasher"" type movie, but more the old Grindhouse style with an entertaining story which made it a lot of fun to watch. For those of you not familar, like the style of the Michael Jackson Video ""Thriller"". The main characters, Darrel and Sadie, were likable and Darrel was very funny. I am sure we will be seeing more from both of these actors in the future!",1256256000,,433,4.425

THE CHARACTERS IN THIS FILM ARE VERY LIKEABLE AND IT NEVER GETS BORING, FILMED IN THE TRADITION OF AN OLD GRINDHOUSE MOVIE, IT HAS THE SAME FEEL AS PLANET TERROR. THE PRODUCERS OF THIS FILM DID A GREAT JOB AND I LOOK FWD TO SEEING MORE FROM THEM. IF YOU LOVE HORROR AND A GOODTIME TOO, BUY THIS MOVIE ITS WORTH IT!!",1252800000,9,531,4.018867924528302
