2402831,5,B000B64TZA,"Seven Deaths in the Cat's Eye is one of my top giallos now. Set in a castle, the film drips with atmosphere. Production values are very good and this transfer does it justice. Blue Underground can always be relied upon to give us a quality transfer. Despite having seen as many giallos as I've been able to get my hands on, the reveal still surprised me. I appreciate that, as you tend to become good at predicting the killer after seeing enough giallos. The acting is great. A nod to the cat. LOL I love it when animals are inserted into the story (and not just to be killed- boo), and this cat really had some action. I hope he had salmon tartare written into his contract. Seriously, if you are a giallo fan, or if you are new to the genre, then you owe it to yourself to check out this one.  Thanks Anthony M. Dawson (and company) for directing this great film.",1365292800,5,865,4.274390243902439
2402832,4,B000B64TZA,"The early seventies had a minor Italian gothic resurgence after the success of Director Dario Argento's giallo hits 'THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMMAGE' aka 'L'UCCELLO DLLE PIUME DI CRISTALLO'-1969 and 'THE CAT O' NINE TAILS' aka 'IL GATTO A NOVE CODE'- 1971.  Master Mario Bava directed 'BARON BLOOD' aka 'GLI ORRORI DEL CASTELLO DI NUREMBERGA'-1972 and here we have Director Antonio Margheriti aka Anthony M. Dawson delivering the goods with 'SEVEN DEATHS IN THE CAT'S EYE' aka 'LA MORTE NEGLI OCCHI DEL GATTO'-1973, an atmospheric excursion involving inheritances and madness within the Macgrief family.  The film abounds with familiar Euro faces: Anton Differing, real-life French lovers Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg, Hiram Keller, Luciano Pigozzi and Franco Ressel to name but a few.  It emerges as a straight forward murder mystery trying to introduce supernatural overtones such as vampirism to throw off the viewer.  Margheriti fills the screen with beautiful castle gardens and lush sets as cameraman Carlo Carlini glides and soars his images throughout.  The music score by Riz Ortolani is a rehash of familiar themes from other Margheriti films such as 'CASTLE OF BLOOD' aka 'DANSA MACABRA'-1964 and 'HORROR CASTLE' aka 'LA VERGINE DI NUREMBERGA'-1965 and has his usual brassy tonalities.  Blue Underground releases it in their usually brilliant manner with a sharp 2.35 transfer in English mixed with some restored scenes in Italian with English subtitles.  The only extra is an 8 minute interview with co-writer Giovanni Simonelli and a 2 minute interview with Margheriti before his death in 2002. A must for Euro Horror lovers,  it's a great diversion from the real life Horrors being unleashed today on modern movie audiences.",1317427200,4,1745,5.297101449275362
2402833,4,B000B64TZA,"SEVEN DEATHS IN THE CAT'S EYE concerns a family curse, a beautiful woman's return to her ancestral castle, and a mysterious murderer lurking the halls and passageways. If you are a giallo, horror, or suspense fan, then SDITCE should definitely satisfy! It's filled w/ possible suspects, betrayals, and madness. The atmosphere is thick and foreboding, w/ plenty of gruesome twists and deadly turns. Of course, the title comes into play as a particular feline seems to be present at each homicide. I had fun watching this one...",1302393600,5,526,5.057471264367816
2402834,3,B000B64TZA,"Ms. Birkin never looked better.  Even though she plays the main, she does not have heavy duty acting job here ... and that's a good thing.  :)

Audio quality on English track is horrible.  Every now and then Italian version pops out and it's much clearer.  The video quality is not the best, but definitely good enough.  What we have here is a middling effort by the director and writer.  Technically, it's competent enough, but nothing really shines.  Not even the blades.",1293235200,,473,4.682926829268292
2402835,4,B000B64TZA,"Gothic horror and Italian gialli are my favorite sub-genres.  Naturally, I was excited to discover ""Seven Deaths in the Cat's Eye"" - an Italian giallo that is set at a crumbling, turn-of-the-century Scottish castle that is replete with secret passageways, dungeons, mausoleums, fog enshrouded landscapes, and night creatures such as bats and rats.  This film is directed by famous Antonio Margheriti who directed the giallo ""Naked You Die,"" which was co-written by Mario Bava.  A great musical score is provided by Riz Ortolani who also provided the score for Lucio Fulci's ""Perversion Story.""

  Beautiful Corringa (Jane Birken of ""Blow-Up"") is expelled from her convent school; she returns to her ancestral home, a crumbling castle owned by her Aunt Mary who is in financial straits.  One by one, Corringa's strange relatives and associates are murdered by means of suffocation, throat slashing, and bludgeoning.  Most everyone is a suspect until they are found dead.  The ending is shocking.  I never guessed who the killer was.  This is a very enjoyable whodunit from Margheriti. It is highly recommended for fans of Italian gialli and gothic horror.",1215043200,5,1154,5.251366120218579
2402836,4,B000B64TZA,"How could anyone call this a mess? How many giallo movies have you seen that weren't by Argento or Bava (I'm not bashing them, they're great!)  This film has a fantastically spooky atmosphere replete with rumours of vampirism, razorblade slashings, and an orang-u-tan *that's how he pronounces it, even though it's clearly a gorilla haw haw) If you enjoy old gothic horror (think Hammer, but without the extra serving of cheese), and above-average giallo's, then definitely give this one a try..you won't guess who the killer is! (unless you've seen Don't Torture a Duckling or Who Saw Her Die?...or a myriad of other giallos lol)  So kick back, turn on some colored lights, grab a glass of vino (and your cat, if he's around!), and enjoy!",1209859200,4,739,4.857142857142857
2402837,4,B000B64TZA,"Seven Deaths in a Cat's Eye is not your typical giallo. Though the title is reminicent of many other giallo's made in the 70's by incorporating an ""animal"" in the title, it is a little different. We do not have a gloved killer dressed in black going around and violent slashing people. It is instead a murder mystery that surrounds a group of family members in an old castle that start getting killed off one by one by a mysterious killer. Because it stray's from the formula a bit Seven Deaths in a Cat's Eye might disappoint people who live and breath by Dario Argento's films.

Just because it strays from the formula a bit and has little gore doesn't make it a giallo? Hell no! That's like saying Psycho isn't a horror film because it doesn't show gore or have a masked  undead killer. Giallo simply means ""murder mystery"" and that is exactly what this film is. Just because it doesn't copy Argento frame by frame does not make it a giallo. I actually commend Antonio Margheriti for trying something different. Along with his stylish directing, he also injected the film with a thick atmosphere VERY reminisent of old Hammer films. Very gothic in feeling. Like those films, the movie doesn't move at a 100 mph but lets the mystery and atmosphere take you along. Unless you are a young, small minded viewer whose attention can only be kept by today's modern fast adn flashy editing then you should have no problem with this film.

Is Seven Deaths in a Cat's Eye a terrific film? No. But it is a good film that really deserves to be viewed. The atmosphere is thick, the directing is great....just don't expect an Argento giallo and you will find Seven Deaths to your liking.",1154736000,20,1676,4.561461794019934
8082212,5,B000B64TZA,"Late 60s - early 70s Hammer Films style period horror. Perhaps not quite Hammer quality, but an enjoyable film nonetheless.",1522540800,,123,5.2

8082214,5,B000B64TZA,"Great giallo with Bava-esque gothic elements.  Will keep you guessing till the end, where suddenly everything makes sense.

If you're a giallo fan, you'll love this film.  If you don't love this film, you're not a true giallo fan.",1514851200,,230,4.846153846153846

8082216,2,B000B64TZA,"The only interesting character in this film is the fluffy, long-haired cat. It looked, however, that someone should have brushed his thick fur.
This Giallo film should have used subtitles, and not just for those scenes that were not dubbed into English because they were not included in the version for English-speaking viewers. The characters were very hard to understand, even when listening with a hearing aid and the sound cranked up. I.e, the dubbing is atrocious.

Seeing Anton Differing again is interesting, a British actor noted for playing villains or Nazi soldiers. Here you know that he is either going to portray the killer or a victim. At least in this film, he is able to make a sheet sandwich with a dark and lovely (and AC-DC) live-in French instructor. Live-in? To teach whom?

Jane Birkin has little to do except kiss her own cousin and to scream on occasion.

As with many of these films, the director loves to overdo and tracking shots or zoom shots.
Did I miss something, or is the woolly cat not shown at the end?",1488067200,,1036,4.681318681318682
8082217,4,B000B64TZA,"Strange and unique giallo set in a large gothic castle with lavish decor and hidden passageways. Seven Deaths concerns a group of family members, a mistress, a doctor, and a priest who become embroiled in a gruesome murder mystery. As another reviewer stated, this giallo is miles from typical. It's character centric and dialogue-driven, and has a subtle touch of dark humor that plays out brilliantly during the ""dinner table"" scene, one of the film's finest moments. Don't worry, though, Seven Deaths is loaded with all the classic elements; murder, a killer in the shadows, gorgeous women, dazzling colors, creepy tone, and a red herring or three. There's a nice nod to Bava and Argento with the inclusion of a variety of animals; a bat attack in a cave, a psychotic gorilla in a cage, and a cat who creeps around the castle grounds witnessing the killings go down.

On the character front, I must mention the two leads; super sexy Corringa, the archetypal female in peril, is played wonderfully by Jane Birkin. The standout performance however goes to Hiram Keller, who plays the charmingly devilish Lord MacGrieff, the castle's resident ""madman"" and black sheep of the family. Most of the movie's humor is dished out by Lord MacGrieff as he prances around arrogantly, spewing venomous diatribe toward everyone in his family. I really enjoyed his characterhe steals every scene he's in, especially the aforementioned dinner table scene.

So, what about sex? Seven Deaths places more emphasis on sensuality and eroticism than nudity or sleaze. Bottom line: I'm a big giallo fiend and this one, although a bit slow at times, is still superb. In my opinion, every giallo fan worth his or her salt needs to have this one in their collection.",1476662400,,1742,4.9419795221843
8082218,3,B000B64TZA,"Seven Deaths in the Cat's Eye was directed by Antonio Margheriti and written by Giovanni Simonelli and Antonio Margheriti although the original novel was written by Peter Bryan.  The film stars:  Jane Birkin, Hiram Keller, and  Franoise Christophe.  I don't want to give any spoilers, so I will just give a list of my opinion of the pros and cons of the film.  Pros:  Nice photography of the castle, gothic feel; mildly suspenseful as I actually did not suspect the actual killer; and important to film history as it was one of the early movies exploring the new immerging cultural acceptance of gay and bisexual exploration.  Cons:  Could have been edited better and made shorter; my DVD has parts of the movie dubbed and parts of the movie subtitled (I would prefer it all to be in the same format); and the acting is marginal.  Overall, I give it 2.5 stars, but rounded up to be nice, I do not plan to watch it a second time.",1465171200,,928,4.508982035928144

8082220,3,B000B64TZA,"A series of gruesome dispatches occur in an Italian castle. They are witnessed by the family cat. We cannot be too sure the cat is not in on the plot. Looks like anybody and everybody could be the culprit. Let us hope it is not someone that comes out of the closet at the last moment.

Right off I recognized the actress Jane Mallory Birkin who played Corringa; she was awarded an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2001. She was in Evil Under the Sun (1982.) So I was intrigued to find her in this movie.

There were other actors that I could not believe they could afford in this movie such as Anton Diffring whom played Dr. Franz. It took a second then I recognized him from Fahrenheit 451 (1966) where he played the Headmistress of a school.

This story has castles and tales of evil beings. What more could anyone want?

Turns out to be a cheap quickly written Italian who-dun-it. It looks like someone wanting to be the next ""Hammer.""

This would make a great school play but it is too unprofessional in dialog (Italian) and special effects, to hold ones attention for long.

I watched the DVD with the 8 minute interview with Co-Writer Giovanni Simpnelli where they were proud of making a movie on the cheap and had no idea how campy it could be.",1434758400,,1270,4.382978723404255
8082221,4,B000B64TZA,"There's a lot of style to be had in this uber gothic melodrama involving a monstrosity of a castle riddled with secret passages and bodies galore.  The inhabitants are nuttier than fruitcake and just as deadly.  The place is humongous, requiring a lot of upkeep.  Two sisters argue over the cost, one has the funds to help but won't, leaving a lot of ill will between them.  When the rich one is murdered in her bed, her sister convinces the resident doctor/sex fiend to alter the death certificate in her favor.  A quick burial follows with everyone in attendance.  Instead of ending the matter, it only complicated things.  There's still the rich woman's daughter (Jane Birkin as Corringa) to contend with and then there's the supposedly loony cousin, Lord James MacGrieff (Hiram Keller) running around acting weird.  A long dead baby sister helps to fuel the gossip.  And if that isn't grist enough, there's also a resident lesbian French tutor who doesn't teach French, two priests too many, a simian of some kind, missing bodies, and a cat that wanders around endlessly getting in the way.  The murders are rather prosaic, involving a straight razor.  And as for the story, it is a `mystery' that is unsolvable.  The murderer is hastily revealed in the final few seconds with the killer helpfully providing the irrational reason for the killings (which isn't supported by anything that precedes it).  They simply ran out of time, had to blame someone, and had to come up with a reason that almost makes sense.  Claiming it was an alien from outer space would have worked just as well.

Almost, but not quite lurid or sordid enough.  I found it sorely lacking in violence and rationale.  Still, it was sufficiently entertaining to keep for future viewings.",1433289600,3,1760,4.832775919732441
