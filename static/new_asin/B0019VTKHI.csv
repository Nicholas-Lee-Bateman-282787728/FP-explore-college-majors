8275420,5,B0019VTKHI,"This foodie video is like a marathon. I watched it all one Saturday.

It is just fascinating.  You'll want to cook & eat after watching, for sure.",1299110400,3,146,4.37037037037037

On a weekend I will load the dvd and go on my own foodie adventure.",1281916800,3,132,3.75
8275422,5,B0019VTKHI,"Make no mistake about it... a foodie isn't just someone who loves good food; a foodie is someone who finds eating an adventure and is always searching for entirely new food experiences (which is why The Food Network is the antithesis of everything foodie. They should just change their name to the Comfort Food Network - not that I have anything against comfort foods but there is a whole world of foods outside of the American diner experience!).  Outside of The Iron Chef, Tony Bourdain's 'No Reservations' and Mark Bittman's 'Best Recipes in the World', there's very little TV-wise to stimulate us foodies, so this AMAZING gem that just popped from heaven like a truffle on your pillow really is nirvana.  It's Gourmet Magazine 'live' with all the sights and sounds and yes, even the smells and tastes.  It also crams in a global experience that subtly underlines the fact that food is a language and an experience that all cultures can share together and bond with.  If you've been starving for a show that raises your intelligence and spirits and actually acknowledges the other 6 billion people that live on this planet, look no further.  It's FANTASTIC!!!",1225497600,22,1162,4.848484848484849
