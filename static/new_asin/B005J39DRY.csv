8475341,4,B005J39DRY,"This is not a great DVD. But not bad either. The interviews are old  and instead of a narrator guiding the story they use text which cheapens the quality of this documentary. I would love to have a booklet or extras that showed extended interviews and perhaps a few performances but no such luck. There were some interesting stories as well but I don't want spoil anything if you choose to view this film.

If there were more Bobby Blue Bland documentaries around I would drop one star from my rating but if you are a fan of the man, then you know how rare it is to find anything on him so you take what you can get.  Unfortunately, I bought the last one so it might not even matter.

PS, it plays fine.",1372204800,,703,4.185185185185185
8475342,5,B005J39DRY,"First of all, the DVD does play in the US, no problem. Secondly, this is a story about a performer who really was, and remains, one of the key figures in blues music. I saw Bobby perform many times with his great, unique voice, his professionalism, backup band, arrangements, etc. There are several of his best know tunes in the film, along with interviews which were very informative. There are also several clips of live performances which are quite good (and I wish they had gone on longer than they do!). Must viewing for anybody interested in popular music.",1360454400,2,562,4.686868686868687
8475343,5,B005J39DRY,Enjoyed this Doc very much. Only wish that some of the rare video footage had been longer. Then again the dvd would have to be 3 hours long. Great to see interviews with Bobby which one rarely sees.,1348531200,,198,4.2368421052631575
8475344,5,B005J39DRY,This DVD played fine for me though my machine is only a year old now. I love Bobby Bland and it's great finally to have a documentary so real and candid. Good clips and I'd certainly reccommend.,1334275200,,194,4.27027027027027
8475345,1,B005J39DRY,"This looks to be a great dvd but is in PAL format, (can't be played on dvd players in North America), therefore quite useless here. Amazon should have made this MUCH clearer. In fact their info is misleading as it says ""Region 1, US and Canada only.",1333324800,4,249,4.319148936170213
