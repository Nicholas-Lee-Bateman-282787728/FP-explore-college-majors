It was a once in a lifetime experience forever crystalized in this world class film. I wish I could have witnessed the event in person, but the quality of the film makes it almost possible! Bravo!!!",1400112000,,301,4.69811320754717
8615290,5,B00FFK9Q0A,"Its not everyday that I have the opportunity to write about something that has been awarded a place in The Guinness Book of World Records, but the musical event portrayed in this colorful DVD, is one of them. The person receiving this prestigious honor was Rupam Sarmah, the creator and nucleus of A Musical Journey For World Peace. Although he is quick to point out that it was a collective effort by many team members. While awards of this nature can be the achievement of a lifetime, for Rupam, it was all about the message of universal harmony. Watching the DVD of the concert, I was blown away by it's profound statement - and embodiment, of cooperation and unity. Five hundred performers filling the immense stage dressed in the traditional costumes of their many countries, was quite a sight to see. Watching the huge musical assemblage flawlessly performing the various movements of this nearly 40 minute symphony, was a living example of the beauty that can happen when people work (and in this case, play) towards a common goal. When I viewed the DVD, I could not get over how smoothly it moved from one section to another with variations in time signature, key signature, tempo, and style change, and no breaks in between.

I also wanted to comment about the camera work on the DVD. It's probably next to impossible to imagine the challenges of documenting an event of this enormity. But the numerous cameras that were used did a remarkable job of drawing you into the festivity with an up close look at the performers and their interactions. The event was shot from numerous angles, with panning, zooming, overhead views, etc. I was also impressed with how they were able to focus on which performers on that huge stage were soloing at any given time throughout the performance, as it was continually changing from moment to moment. The veritable rainbow of colors in the performer's native homeland costumes also added to the visual magic. This is truly an example of the whole being much greater than the sum of its parts. In fact, it is really the theme and reason for being of the concert. A brilliant and compelling presentation of unity and harmony! For 37 minutes, ""A Musical Journey for World Peace is the sound of many hearts beating as one.",1381449600,,2262,4.741116751269035
