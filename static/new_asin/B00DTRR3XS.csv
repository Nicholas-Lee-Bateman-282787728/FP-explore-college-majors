TMNT growing up didn't have or need this things are just different these days unfortunately. Call me a prude if you want, but if it does not add to show in a positive way, why use it frequently.",1388793600,2,295,4.103448275862069

5855496,4,B00DTRR3XS,"""Ultimate Showdown"" serves up the last 12 episodes of TMNT's first season.  It's a series that a lot of people  wanted to hate (including me, since I grew up watching the 1987 animated series)...but fortunately, it's a ton of fun and probably the best TMNT series to date, even after just a few dozen episodes. The terrific action, humor, new characters and cinematic feel are easy standouts, as well as the voice acting and nods to the 1987 series.  Unlike ""Rise of the Turtles"" and ""Enter Shredder"" (the first two Season One ""volume"" releases), this doubles the episode count on two discs for only about $5 more.  I'd have given it five stars for the fun factor, but Nickelodeon's continued practice of avoiding season sets  is just irritating.  With any luck, we'll get a complete Season One release---and hopefully on Blu-ray---in the near future.

Other than that mild annoyance, ""Ultimate Showdown"" is unquestionably worth buying.  These 12 episodes feel bigger in scope and execution than Season One's first half, answering plenty of questions without filling in all the blanks.  If you're new to this 2012 series, start with ""Rise of the Turtles"" first...but if you're like me, it won't take you long to get caught up.  The DVD itself looks and sounds good, presented in 16x9 widescreen with a terrific Dolby 5.1 audio track.  Bonus features are minimal, but the series itself is the real selling point here.

5855497,5,B00DTRR3XS,"There is nothing better than being able to catch up on episodes with OUT commercials, and since this is really all of the last half of Season 1, it is very nice to play all and enjoy the stories without interruption.  I would have regretted not having it, although in order to see the entire season you need the other 2 DVD's plus this one.  A box set would be nice, but for now this is nicely done and I love being able to see everything together.",1382400000,2,448,4.137931034482759

5855499,4,B00DTRR3XS,"The ending was epic to this season.  It is exactly what I would have hoped from with a battle between Splinter and Shredder.  It also had a few twists that any turtles fan will never see coming.  I can't wait for the second season on DVD!

This review lost a star because of the annoying previews in the beginning and the bright yellow between episodes.  I didn't pay this money to have my time wasted by previews",1381190400,,413,4.311688311688312
5855500,5,B00DTRR3XS,"This 2 Disc DVD set contains the final 12 episodes (really 13 24-Minute Episodes) from Season 1 of the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles TV series. This is DVD release 3 of 3 of the first season episodes. Amazon doesn't always do a good job on their DVD episode listings so here are the episodes that are included in this DVD set:

1. I, Monster
2. The Alien Agenda
3. The Pulverizer
4. TCRI
5. Cockroach Terminator
6. Baxter's Gambit
7. Enemy of My Enemy
8. Karai's Vendetta
9. The Pulverizer Returns!
10. Parasitica
11. Operation: Break Out
12. Showdown, Parts 1 and 2 (Season Finale)

Note:  The ""I, Monster"" episode that was excluded from the ""Enter Shredder"" DVD is included in this DVD set.  The 312 Minute running time indicates that the DVD Set contains 13 24-Minute Episodes so Showdown Parts 1 and 2 count as a single episode in the DVD episode count.

5855501,5,B00DTRR3XS,"Update:  The 2nd Season starts October 12th, 11 a.m.!!

The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles by Nick (2012) is an amazing show.  I never watched any of the other previous versions.  But, I can't believe how fantastic this show is.  Almost all of the story lines are very well written.  And the characters themselves are well developed and I love them all.  One of the angles that I think that makes this show fun and interesting is the angle with Donnie and April.  If anyone has watched this show, you can tell that Donnie has the cutest crush on April and I think he actually loves her.  I've calculated it, and Donnie (one of the turtles) has to come to April's rescue about 25% out of all of the episodes in season 1. And, just to let you know how much the fans love Donnie and April, checkout youtube - there are about 11,000 videos dedicated to Donnie and April.  I know that they are coming out with season 2.  I just hope that the writers DO NOT change this on-going theme with Donnie and April.  I know that they are coming out with a new character, Casey Jones, I just hope that he doesn't replace Donnie as the one who is always coming to April's rescue.  I feel that the fans wouldn't like that and I think that this would be a major shift in the show's original idea for season 1.  In conclusion, this is a really fun show to watch.  My 6 year old son absolutely loves this show and so do I.
Just FYI - did you notice that the running time on this DVD is 312 minutes? Each episode runs 24 minutes long.  This means that there are 13 episodes on this DVD!! Or, one could look at it this way: 12 episodes with one of the episodes being a double feature which would be the Ultimate Showdown.  Alright! They must be including the episode ""I Monster"" which I thought was one of the best episodes of the season.  I can hardly wait to get the DVD!",1376524800,12,1849,4.219373219373219

5855529,4,B00DTRR3XS,"My husband and I ran across this new (2012) version of the turtles and started watching them on a regular basis.  We absolutely love them (yes, we are adults, but who cares?!) I love the fact that the characters have distinct personalities and looks unlike the 1987 version where they all looked and acted the same.  The writing for the show is excellent - the perfect mix of humor, sincerity, and good life lessons all combined into one fantastic show.  The only complaint I have is that (as a parent) I feel it's a bit too violent/creepy for younger kids (it's up to each parent to decide how old their kids should be) and they insult Michelangelo a lot (in good fun, but still) which I wish didn't happen so much because I'm not sure how much little ones would pick up on that and think it was ""cool""  to do since the turtles do it.  They do have some moments where they clearly show that they care about Mikey, though, and each other.",1389225600,,938,4.367816091954023
