4397399,5,B004KO1NU8,An inspirational and informative video of a wonderful singer.  Phelps renditions of old gospel and new alike were crisp and well done.  It kept the attention of my wife and I for the entire time.,1333411200,,195,4.542857142857143
4397400,4,B004KO1NU8,This DVD delivered the quality and enjoyment that we all have come to expect from this amazing singer.  My only complaint is that it only plays the part of the song that included the high notes to show off David.  He is wonderful but I was disappointed that it was not the whole song on any of the playlist.  The interview and interaction with Bill Gaither was wonderful.,1325635200,5,371,4.426470588235294
4397401,5,B004KO1NU8,"Great DVD. Wow. David can seem a bit distant, but I always attributed it to his genius. Seeing him on this DVD actually talking quite a bit helps one realize that he is quite human, and something I never doubted, loves those kids and that very sweet girl he married. Just from what I have heard, she is amazing. I admire her for the way she has supported David, allowing us to have so much of him.

Even though I have never met David, I was drawn to him the first time I ever saw him on DVD. I remarked, ""Who is that guy with the kind of frumpy sweater."" My friend replied, ""You don't like his sweater?""  I explained that I liked it fine; it looked very comfortable, but who is he?  She did not know, even though she had many Gaither CDs and DVDs. I swear, I saw several before I ever heard David sing enough to really know he sings. I kept saying, ""Find out who he is."" She says, ""Why are you so interested?""  I told her, ""He is just full of things he wants to share, I can tell.""

One night she played ""Heaven.""  I thought, ""Oh, brother.""  Then toward the very end, David sang. She said there's your guy, and I listened. I moved to the edge of the couch. ""Well, it's about time they let him sing,"" I said, and that was the last thing I said until he finished ""No More Night.""

I came home and found it on his web page, then I listened to ""The End of the Beginning,"" and a couple of other songs. My search began: With some help from David's kind wife, I ordered God Bless America.""  Once I figured out how to order on the Internet, I bought the DVD called ""Heaven,"" so I could hear David, and learned to like the rest of it. I bought any DVD on which I could find David.

My good friend's son had recently committed suicide. I introduced her to David on the Internet and she bought the CD Revelation. I cannot even remember how many times I went to her home with Gaither DVDs to play for her and her mother.  We found them healing. I found ""It is Well with my Soul."" on one of the Billy Graham DVDs that Gaither did. I got to know Bill Gaither, Guy Penrod, and Mark Lowry, and began to like some of the singers I thought I did not like, and continued to collect songs by David.

This guy opened my world to music I would have never had in my home, were it not for him. I have lost at least a half dozen Gaither DVDs with folks not returning them, but so be it. I have quite a few. This makes me qualified to give a fairly reliable opinion about Bill and Gloria's efforts, and I can tell you one and all, this is a fantastic DVD. David sings O' Holy Night on this one. No one, not even Pavoroti or his mentor Mario Lanza sing it better, (actually not as well -in my opinion). David lives in his songs, and they are very moving.

Bill and David are entertaining here; David is very down to earth, and seeing him with his kids is a treat. Seeing him with his wife revealed to me why he is doing so well. What a little soldier she is.

Bill has truly given us some of David's very best on this DVD. Toward the end of it David seems to be getting tired, but is still gracious. I have no doubt that Bill Gaither fully appreciates this young man and the talent that he has contributed throughout the years. It thrilled my heart to hear Bill being so sweet. (Guess I'm a softy.)Of course, Bill is always nice, but this is special.  I think you will really miss something if you do not get this publication. It is very generous, so you will have more than your money's worth.

I love the interviews and commraderie with him and Bill.  He truly seems to be a very humble person.  I have seen him in person once and would go again and again if I had the opportunity.  The only problem with this dvd is that it is not long enough.  I think that No More Night, Jesus Saves, It is Well and Let Freedom Ring are my favorites.

4397417,5,B004KO1NU8,"I would like to have given this David Phelps DVD a TEN Star rating, or even MORE ... simply because I believe his is the voice of one of the finest, most OUTSTANDING TENORS to EVER grace the face of the earth. Now, with the amazing tenors of whom you are likely familiar, the statement I just made could quite easily be a VERY unpopular one. But I'd like you to see for yourselves ... and, as a friendly warning, please be prepared to want to purchase everything he has ever recorded!!! Because I DO!!!  I not only WANT to, over a period of time you can believe I WILL!

I THINK this is the DVD in which Bill Gaither, when interviewing Phelps about his family and his life in general, mentions how one expert had said about Phelp's tenor voice, (paraphrasing here)  that it was not the usual voice of a tenor. He explained that this was due to the fact that David's vocal cords could pass for those of a baritone ... making Phelps capable of portraying a more varied tone than that of a tenor's voice without the added ... uhhhh ... boost? (you might notice that I'm not very good at paraphrasing!)

You really should hear this DVD, even if you buy it in the hopes of proving me wrong! ;)",1434412800,,1188,4.266666666666667

Nice to get a glimpse into the artist's personal life - his family singing acapella together in a casual setting (just like they sing together in their car on their way to church) was  breathtaking.
