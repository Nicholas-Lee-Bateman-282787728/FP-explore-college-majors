2326756,2,B0009W5KHM,"You may not remember his name, but Zoel Zwick is the guy who directed a big hit named 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding.'  All right, now you know it, and 'Elvis Has Left the Building' is his follow-up, which was released straight-to-video in America.  If you never heard about the film, it's no surprise because, for all good acting from the stars, the film is embarrassingly bad.

The comedy features Kim Basinger and John Corbett.  Basinger, clad in pink, is delightful to see as Harmony Jones, cosmetic saleslady of Pink Lady, who travels around riding a pink cadillac.  The life of Harmony has been stragely linked to Elvis Presley, but today troubles seem to follow her everywhere, for every time Harmony meets Elvis impersonaters, they all drop dead in ridiculously silly way.

So, while FBI chases the lady in pink, Miles Taylor, bored excetive of advertizement company, happens to meet her, and falls in love.  Harmony also likes him, but after misunderstanding that Taylor is another Elvis lookalike (meaning another dead body), Harmony runs away.  In this way, Taylor and FBI chases her, and the story finally leads the characters to Las Vegas, where a convention for Elvis impersonaters is going to be held.

The concept is silly, but not bad itself.  The problem is how to put it into practice.  Though the two stars are very charming and likable, the inept direction killed the joyfully romantic mood between them, which is the greatest thing in the film.  Instead, director throws so many unnecessary elements into the film -- too many flashbacks about Harmony's childhood, unfunny conversations over phone between Corbett and Sean Astin (yes, that's him from 'LOTR'); simply annoying Denise Richards wearing Elvis-wig (I'm not kidding); and awfully familiar 'comic' dialogues between two FBIs, or a gay receptionaist and them.  It is unaccountable that while the film insists on showing these scenes, none of which are particularly good, John Corbett has to spend considerable time in a car trunk (don't as me how).

[CAMEO of TOM HANKS!!!] There are some cameos, and all of them are funny -- see Richard Kind as 'Burning Elvis', David Leisure as 'Hole-in-the-Head Elvis,' and Tom Hanks as 'Letterbox Elvis.'  Hanks appears only twice, second time during the end credits, so don't miss it.  Plus, guest appearances from Pat Morita, Angie Dickinson, and Annie Potts.

Besides the natural charms of Basinger and Corbett, and the film's sporadically funny moments, the soundtrack is wonderful, which includes lots of Elvis songs.  Some are original versions, some remixed-originals, others covers, and all fantastic.

If you like Kim Basinger, you might find the film pretty good with her delectable comic acting.  If only the film's director had decided on making much use of her talent.",1126396800,,2793,5.056768558951965
2326757,5,B0009W5KHM,"You have heard the words ""Elvis Has Left the Building"" at Elvis concerts, and concerts with Elvis impersonators, and maybe among some other places, and now these words are the title of this film that I find at my local video store this week. But it doesn't seem to have a movie about Elvis, without his songs in the film, and this movie doesn't fail on it, and there are other people even singing his famous tunes. And with the anniversity of his death coming up, this might just be the thing for you Elvis fans to watch, if you are looking to watch either an Elvis Presley related movie for the first time, or any Elvis Presley films, but I am sure that you would even enjoy some of the older Elvis Presley related films that are out there if you are one. The movie opens, with Young Harmony Jones (Madison McReynolds) in Memphis 1968 with the real Elvis Presley (Gil McKinney), as he is dring her home, and now it is flashed to the present. Now Harmony Jones (Kim Basinger) feels that she is cursed around Elvis impersonators, because when she is around them, they are seem to mysterious die around her, and when she meets a man (John Corbett) whom she mistakes for another one, she tires to avoid him as possible, but she doesn't know that he has to pick up that Elvis suit for his wife, so they they can get a dirvoce, and in order for that to happen, he has to hand deliver to Las Vegas, and meet her there, so they can get dirvoced, but just wait until you see what happens to him, on the jorney to Las Vegas, which I would hate to spoil for you, and I won't, so you will have to watch the film for yourself. I haven't really seen many movie critics reviews, really none at all, so even this wasn't released to theatres, or they did screen it in advance for them.",1123718400,2,1769,4.252225519287834
2326758,5,B0009W5KHM,"Nowadays, it is rare that a movie is produced which doesn't have shooting, cursing, and overt sex in it. This movie was a wonderful return to how movies were once made. I applaud the film industry for giving us a more innocent & fun film for those of us who are more mature adults (over 35). Loved it!",1123632000,9,301,4.206896551724138
2326759,5,B0009W5KHM,"This is one Elvis related film that Elvis fans and fans of music in general will love.  John Corbett, as he did in My Big Fat Greek Wedding, did a great job and Kim Basinger played the role just as it should have been played. The script is well plotted out.  Unlike another reviewer, who claims to be a fan of Kim Basinger's, it is obvious she has great comedic skills as first revealed in My Stepmother Is An Alien.  It is a love story for Heaven's sake and a satire as well!  There is a generous dose of authentic Elvis music which makes you overlook some terrible impersonations.  The music is meshed cleverly into the plot and it is a joy to the ear.  Despite the PG 13, due to some violent death scenes, it is still a good family film.",1123286400,2,740,4.176056338028169
2326760,2,B0009W5KHM,"I was surprised to see this DVD, because it has probably never been released in theaters dued to it's low budget and weak screenplay. I had to see it for the simple reason that I am a die-hard Kim Basinger fan, and her last role in The Door in The Floor totally broke my heart! This is certainly a bad choice of follow-up made by the everlasting screen goddess.

In this film, she plays a travelling cosmetics bussiness woman(Harmony Jones) who had an encounter with young Elvis when she was a little girl, and they had a memorable conversation together. One day, she witnessed a drunken Elvis impersonator accidentally burnt to death in a hotel room, and in panic she vanished from the scene. Along the road, she had two more encounters with Elvis impersonators whom also died from accidents in her presence. She was horrified and thought she was bad luck or something, and wanted to avoid all things Elvis. Meanwhile, the police are investigating the mysterious deaths of the three impersonators, with some small evidence left behind by Harmony. At the same time, Harmony meets a handsome stranger(John Corbett) in a hotel and he instantly had a crush on her. She didn't want to get involved with him, because he was delivering an Elvis Costume to his soon to be ex-wife. Harmony is confused and terrified by all the chaotic things, and she must summon her courage to figure if it was Elvis' spirit at work in attempt to prevent the growing number of people from impersonating him, and can she deliver herself to the man of her dream and walk away without Elvis Phobia?

Kim Basinger anchors the film with a decent comic performance, and her Tennesse accent is quite impressive. It is not her forte to do goofy comedies, especially when she's so beautiful as Pink Lady in this movie. There was very little chemistry between Corbett and her, and there romantic plot is so choppy and under developed. Lets hope her next film will be a heavy duty drama or thriller again.",1123113600,2,1970,4.674351585014409

Well she goes into this one lounge and there is the trouble man trying to be Elvis. He talks into helping him improve his looks with this make-up. She agrees to help him not realizing that he really was going to put the moves on her. So she goes to do what ever at this sink and the next thing you know the guy lights up a cig. and he starts to drink.

2326774,3,B0009W5KHM,Just a nice date night movie. Acting is fine Kim Basinger does a good job. There is no logic to some of the action or dead Elvis's and if you are a huge fan of Elvis this may not be a good movie. Don't expect too much and it will be just fine.,1386720000,,243,3.6037735849056602

Put his name on anything and it will sell because of the love people had for Elvis. But I wish the Elvis estate would stop people using his name to make a few bucks before they slip into oblivion because they have no ideas that are new. Like Johnny Carson said and it was quoted many times
""its a shame Elvis died and not the impersonators"".  As for Basinger she had to be desperate to make a movie, while Elvis will be remembered for centuries, Basinger is lucky to still be in movies making crap.",1346198400,,624,4.243697478991597
2326781,5,B0009W5KHM,"While most straight to DVD films are not worth watching, this one is the exception.

Kim Basinger plays a ""Pink Lady"" (Mary Kay) cosmetic sales lady who had met Elvis as a child. During her recent travels Elvis impersonators around her die from freak accidents. She falls in love with John Corbett (love at first sight) who she believes is also an Elvis impersonator because he carries around an Elvis suit which belongs to his soon to be ex-wife Denise Richards. The acting is pure ham, such as in Mars Attacks. The accents are overly done. The FBI agents hunting the pair are comical. The concept is original. The cast is full of stars (Tom Hanks, Sean Astin, Angie Dickinson, Billy Ray Cyrus, Pat Morita). The dialogue is so-so, perhaps the weakest aspect of the movie. The Elvis impersonators were so bad, you wanted them to die.

Thank you. Thank you very much.",1341014400,2,866,4.65359477124183

2326784,4,B0009W5KHM,"Quirky little movie, even has a cameo with Tom Hanks. This was a real sleeper and I accidentally found it one day while channel surfing. It hooked me and I had to buy it. It has Mike Starr as an FBI agent in a role you wouldn't expect him in. A wonderfully funny movie, I believe the word is quaint. Family safe and entertaining for the whole group.",1250726400,,349,4.147058823529412
2326785,3,B0009W5KHM,"This movie is silly.  You will have a few laughs and that is about it.  If you are an Elvis fan, don't bother.  This movie  degrades Elvis.  He deserves better.  If you are not an Elvis fan, give it a try.  You wouldn't understand anyway. Kim Basinger seems to keep running into Elvis inpersonators and magically they have freak accidents that kill them.  Kim is running from them and is feeling guilty.  She finds love in the end which helps her through her crisis.",1143763200,2,466,4.4523809523809526
2326786,4,B0009W5KHM,"First, I rented this movie; then I ordered a copy for my personal collection. I liked it that much. If you're a fan of The King, you will want to see it; if you're not (how could you?), it still has a better storyline and more humor than much of what does make it to the big screen.

Kim Basinger also graced the film with her combination of beauty and a talent for comedy not seen since ""Nadine"" or ""My Stepmother Is An Alien"". She should do this more often.",1143676800,12,459,4.1
2326787,4,B0009W5KHM,"I didn't think much of My Big Fat Greek Wedding, but I liked this movie a lot.  I bought it yesterday at this writing for 5 bucks at a local video store, and found myself laughing a lot.  I don't know if it helps not to be an Elvis fan, but even if you are, let's admit it:  there are too many knockoffs of the King running around--lots of them truly as bad as what are portrayed in this offering--and as Basinger's character says in the end, he's probably not too happy about it.

I became a Basinger fan when I saw the movie Nadine back in 1987, and it's wonderful to see her in another romantic comedy.  Even better this time, because there isn't a bunch of swearing.  I think the last good comedy I saw her in was My Stepmother is An Alien, and that was laugh-out-loud funny too.  This one's been long overdue, and she is just wonderful in it as Pink Lady sales rep Harmony Jones.  I would also like to point out that the woman is still a gorgeous knockout for her age--even better than most of today's younger starlets.  Her character is amusingly glam looking, yet clean cut, completely feminine, and that's what makes her comedic performance twice as good.  Corbett makes a handsome match for her as he, as well as the FBI, chases her around the country--both of them driving great looking convertibles--and the romance has a sweet clean, almost yesteryear appeal that you won't be afraid to let your older relatives watch.

Joel Zwick came up with a great concept here; Elvis impersonators getting killed off at random in some very silly and hilarious ways everytime Harmony gets within 3 feet of them, and a love affair Harmony keeps running from because she thinks Corbett is another Elvis impersonator when, in fact, it's his estranged wife (Denise Richards).  I have to admit I wasn't expecting much when I bought it off the bargain rack, but was pleasantly surpirsed last night.  It's not deep, it's not earth shattering, but it's the most clean fun I've had in a long time, and I recommend it highly no matter what your age.  Also, if you like Basinger in comedy roles using her natural Georgia-born accent, you will like her and Jeff Bridges in Nadine.",1143331200,19,2167,4.523076923076923
2326788,5,B0009W5KHM,"I must admit that I have never have, nor ever will be an Elvis fan, but there is something about this movie that just appeals to me. Its funny, light and sweet, something that comedies just seem to missing these days. Not as hardcore as Wedding Crashers, yet not as beautifully romantic as My big Fat Greek Wedding, Elvis has left the building stands in a genre all its own.

Don't miss at least renting and watching this movie..........its sure to make you laugh in the end at least. Sean Astin, John Corbett, and Kim Basinger...........well I can't say much for Basinger, but I can tell you that the former two where absolutly wonderful.

It's not the memorable of a movie, but it's otherwise okay, and will kill an hour and a half on a lazy weekend afternoon.  See it once.",1502496000,,406,4.113924050632911
