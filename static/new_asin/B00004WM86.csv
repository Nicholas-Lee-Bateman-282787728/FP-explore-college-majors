Every corner of the movie involves you in a mistery that needs to be discovered, to reveal a sin at the very end.  The passion and the love that only can exist in the rooms of a lost old mansion of the Venezuelan forests.  I enjoyed this jewel and very seductive movie very much.",1075161600,6,360,4.424242424242424
7926204,4,B00004WM86,"Albeit difficult to follow, due in part to the series of disjointed flashbacks and confusing images, this is a beautifully told story of pain and betrayal set in an exotic and lush tropical setting. The plot line is simple: a woman, residing in France, inherits an old hacienda from her aunt on the Venezuelan coast in the early 70's, only to discover her aunt's illicit relationship, and subsequent seclusion, with her illegitimate half brother. Venezuelan society of the 1930's and 50's was extremely hypocritical and chauvinistic, a point exceedingly well portrayed in this film. The mise-en-scne and the photography are top notch. The acting is subdued and languid, almost somnolescent in its reverie of another era. To appreciate this film, one has to have an understanding of Latin society; its intolerance for female rles outside the established ""norm;"" its many unspoken, rigid rules and its complete disregard for human nature. The contrast in this film, offered by the lushness of the landscape and the dryness of the interaction within the family, is its most salient attribute.",1026864000,7,1089,5.193181818181818
7926205,1,B00004WM86,"The pace of this movie is so slow it would, at times, seem to be a series of slides, with the sounds of the Venezuelan countryside as the most prominent feature in a lackluster soundtrack. The photography is beautiful, as are the lush and exotic locations. This is a story of a mature woman remembering her first love, as her niece is visiting with her. It is told in flashbacks. I really don't know if the story is confusing because of the script, or because silent scenes are so long you fall asleep in between them.",985824000,3,518,4.40625
