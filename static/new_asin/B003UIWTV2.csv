8406008,5,B003UIWTV2,"I saw this series on Hulu with subtitle.  I am Japanese and saw it with my American friend.  We enjoyed it so much.  This historical event shows both American view and Japanese view as Japan was changing to be modernized and became a part of the world.  In stead of fighting, Japan decided to adapt and compete economically and with strong naval force so that Japan would not be attached or occupied by a Western country.  All the sets look very authentic in this film.  I can see that the cameraman tried to duplicate old hand painted photographs (acumen prints) from 1850s.  Previous movies from Japan for old and historical periods only showed close ups, castles with actors and actress with current make-ups and current ways of speaking. But this series, Ryomaden shows how people really looked like with authentic clothing and make-ups.  All the actors and actress are top class and well directed by the director for acting.  There are always lots of scenes that make you cry.  This DVD has English subtitle, and I hope more people from all over the world would see it to understand what Japan went through.  Some countries still have hard time opening up their countries, but continue fighting meaninglessly.  They should watch this DVD too.",1425513600,2,1247,4.802816901408451
8406009,5,B003UIWTV2,"This is a mini series created by NHK called Taiga Drama series. It has English subtitle and it is one of the best series that I have seen from NHK.I have seen many Taiga series as my husband is Japanese.
Sakamoto Ryoma is the founder of the Meiji Revolution creating the first Naval Academy for Japan. He has changed the constitution and created the Upper and Lower House in the Japanese government.

Aside from being a historic series,the way the acting and the interpretation of the film is phenomenal. You can almost smell the waves,inhale the dust,and get wet under the rain. I strongly suggest that Amazon should carry this series with English translation.",1283817600,14,661,4.798245614035087
