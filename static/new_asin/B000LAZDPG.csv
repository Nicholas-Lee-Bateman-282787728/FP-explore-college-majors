2701085,3,B000LAZDPG,"Stories about the cruel annihilation of physical, emotional and spiritual lives that follow addiction to drugs appear to be constant sources for films. If seeing the destruction of people's lives when they become addicted to drugs helps those who are on the teetering brink of trying heavy drugs to avoid the fall, then these films are well worth the making.  Yet if the constant barrage of stories such as this one fails there, then the reason for continuing this line of filmmaking is questionable and wearing. Such is the case for this very well acted, directed and produced little film from Australia.

Based on Luke Davies' novel ""Candy: A Novel of Love and Addiction"" and adapted for the screen by Davies and director Neil Armfield, this story is divided into thirds: heaven, earth, and hell, unfortunately leaving the audience in the final category.  Dan (Heath Ledger) is a poet who drifts around living off loans from friends. He is deeply in love with young artist Candy (the very beautiful and talented Abbie Cornish) and together they use drugs, advancing to heroin through the encouraging pastime of Professor Casper (Geoffrey Rush) who manages his addiction rather well and maintains a live-in lad Jorge (an impressive little debut by Roberto Meza-Mont).  Dan and Candy explore their passion and love with the enhancement of drugs: this is the 'heaven' segment. But their disconnected  relationship is questioned by Candy's parents (Tony Martin and Noni Hazlehurst) and when Candy announces their engagement, her parents fear the lack of character that Dan represents.  Dan and Candy marry, now completely addicted to drugs, live in a ware house, and without income Candy turns to being a hooker and Dan tries to become a male hustler with out success, finding it easier to steal credit cards and explore fraud: this section is 'earth'.  Candy becomes pregnant and the couple decides to go clean, suffering together the withdrawal that eventually leads to Candy's miscarriage, an event that breaks the spirit of everyone around them.  They see the need to be clean and they move to a shack house outside Melbourne where they attempt to find a new start only to go back to drugs (hell episode has started) and Candy descends into psychosis, gradually ending up institutionalized. Drugs have fractured Dan's and Candy's love, their family ties and even their relationship with Casper and the few other friends they have.

The film is unrelentingly dark except for the few moments in the heaven portion when the passion and love of the couple is radiant.  Ledger and Cornish are superb if a bit flat due to the storyline, Rush delivers his usual fine acting and Martin and Hazlehurst show significant talent in tough roles.  The problem with the film is its overdrawn length about a situation that changes very little: there is no arc to the storyline, just a constant unrelenting descent in to the abyss of self-destruction that accompanies the devastation of drug addiction.  But if the viewer doesn't mind a story with no light at the end then this is a very well done film from a solid crew.  Grady Harp, April 07",1175385600,3,3128,4.935238095238096
2701086,3,B000LAZDPG,"I knew it would be a downer, this story.  It could have been titled, ""Watch Drugs Destroy Two More Attractive People!"". But there was so little character development that you didn't really care about Dan or Candy. Watching this was like watching an excrutiatingly drawn out train wreck. You weren't drawn in to the drama as it sped along it's downward spiral.  You wanted to be drawn in.  You wanted so say, ""Make me care!"" But it never happened. Not to me, anyway.  Maybe it was not meant to appeal to viewers. Maybe it was just an ""art film"" that told a little, grim story, and viewers could take it or leave it. I wanted to see Heath Ledger make another movie where he completely ""melts"" into a character, like Ennis Delmar in ""Brokeback"", where his performance is heartwrenching and unforgettable. I hope his next movie will shine.  Sorry, this one was disappointing.",1175212800,5,871,4.666666666666667
2701087,4,B000LAZDPG,"The reason I say it was difficult to watch is because of the subject matter.  I find it incredibly hard to see people so hooked on drugs that they sell themselves on the street.  I wish they had given a little background about the characters.  Was Dan always a no good lout, or did his addiction bring this out in him?  What did these two people see in each other aside from the physical and the fact that they were both hooked on heroin.  How did they meet?  You are dropped right in the middle of the relationship and they are already junkies.  I gave it four stars because in spite of this flaw, it was still a good movie, with great performances by the three lead actors.  Heath Ledger as Dan leaves behind his pretty boy image.  Abbie Cornish is spectacular as Candy, and Geoffroy Rush is their mentor/friend who supplies them with drugs, and he gives a wonderful performance, as always.  He is also a college professor, who eventually dies of an overdose.  The final scene in the movie is quite moving.  ""Spoilers*  When Candy is released from the hospital after suffering a breakdown, she visits Dan at his job, where he is a dishwasher. (Well, at least he has a job now, and he's drug free) You can see that they still love each other, but Dan turns her away probably because he knows that if they get back together, they will get back on the drugs.  Its what their whole relationship was based on.  They have no other way of relating to each other.  Also, Candy had miscarried their child, and I think there were just too many bad memories for their marriage to survive.  Heath Ledger blew me away in the scenes where he held their still born baby, and when he cried at the end because he knew he had to let Candy go. So, so sad.",1175040000,14,1738,4.3312693498452015
2701088,5,B000LAZDPG,This movie was on a list of movies we could watch for extra credit while I was in nursing school. It is an emotional and insightful look into the world of addiction. Heath Ledger is amazing. I loved this movie.,1465516800,,210,4.275

2701092,5,B000LAZDPG,"Candy is a masterpiece about love and addiction. It started filming on January 27, 2005 and was released on February 15, 2006. Candy is 1.000 times better than Trainspotting (and Trainspotting was really good) and 1.000 times less known than Trainspotting. Candy is a touching and strong love story full of despair, hope, regrets, dreams & failures. The story does not try to judge, punish or teach. There are no good and bad guys. Candy is a human and honest portrayal of the hell of heroine, a story about real love and a movie that will break your heart into a million pieces. Heath describes the movie like a film of love () not a story about heroine. Heath explains: Heroine is involved but I think that the beauty of this film [is that] its not exploding heroine or glorifying it in any way () Its a tragic story of love. Director Neil Armfield was a bit hesitant about using Heath as Dan, since he thought that Heath had a natural energy that was heroic, and Dan was grubby and edgy. But, again, it was Heaths performance in Monters Ball that got him the role. Luke Davies (the writer of the book upon which the movie is based and screenwriter of the movie, together with director Neil Armfield) wrote a beautiful and touching article about Heath after Heaths death; he describes Heath as a talented, generous, kind and sincere human being, and says: It was Monsters Ball that convinced Neil Armfield that Ledger was the one for Candy. What attracted Heath to the project was the novel, which he describes like a tragic love affair with both the drug and each other, the screenplay and the fact of being allowed to use his own accent, which he didn't do since Two Hands and 10 things I hate about you: shooting a film using my own accent was attractive  I haven't done that for 8 years. I was looking forward to feeling liberated from  having to perform with an accent  It was a sense of freedom. I was able to mumble in my own accent, to breath in my own accent, to improvise freely. Abbie Cornish gives a breathtaking performance. Heath says about Abbie:  shes incredibly talented  She relies a lot upon  instinct and the magic of the scene, and she keeps it real and shes a very grounded human being, very talented obviously, very beautiful I could not have asked for a better Candy. I must say that Abbie is the strongest and most brilliant female character of all of Heaths movies. Id go further and say that two of the most beautifully portrayed love stories in cinema history are the ones of Ennis and Jack, and Candy and Dan. Candy is a real jewel. Director Armfield is awesome and the cast (Heath, Abbie and Geoffrey Rush) is superb / Antonia Tejeda Barros (Spain).

P.S. Unfortunately, the DVD does not have ENGLISH subtitles and, if English is not your native language (like it happens to be in my case), sometimes there are words that are difficult to understand, due to the Aussie accent and slang. The DVD is packed with very exciting EXTRAS.",1452384000,,2963,4.547842401500938
2701093,5,B000LAZDPG,"Really good very underrated movie that for some reason is not available for streaming, at least legally. Candy and Dan are drug addicted illicit lovers totally strung out. They will do anything to get high and go to ridiculous lengths to get a fix. Her parents watch them helplessly fall into the dark abyss of addiction. The brilliant Geoffrey Rush plays their older mentor ""dealer"". Great writing and acting and I love the poem at the end of the movie.",1451865600,,454,4.6875
2701094,5,B000LAZDPG,"I bought this movie used, as it is hard to locate and very expensive. Even the used DVD was expensive, however  I was extremely happy with the used condition, as it was well cared for. I had never seen this movie before, however as a Clinician/Licensed Chemical Dependency Counselor, I spend time researching materials that will be not only provide information, but will have an impact. Most clients are ""forced"" into treatment because of Probation, Parole or Child Protective Services. Many are angry and their defense systems are strong. This movie is an attention getter.  I have used Requiem For A Dream, which is extremely intense. Candy, with excellent performances by the late Heath Ledger, Abbie Cornish and  Geoffrey Rush (great in his role as the  ""heroine dealer""), has dark scenes.  There is one scene that  was difficult  to watch, however you will not forget it ! This movie does not produce ""good"" feelings.  It is a  dark, sad ""in your face"", downward spiral ride on the destructive path of Addiction.",1438992000,3,1017,4.900584795321637

I found it to be incredibly okay. It was on the cusp, that not-good-not-bad that didn't allow for the enjoyment of something genuinely good, or the entertainment provided by something really bad or so-bad-it's-good.

2701103,3,B000LAZDPG,"Not as good as the book it is based upon. Does not have the detail. If you read the book also this makes far more sense. Story about two people who fall in love with one another and are using heroin too. The woman has also got mental health issues however, and trouble ensues. If you are into heroin stories, or looking for more media with that subject and have enjoyed other films and books with that subject, this is another one like that. The movie just is not great, that is my issue. I expected more. I am not rating it based on morality issues nor glorification of drugs or any such thing because I am not against such lifestyles. This review is based solely upon the fact that I thought the movie itself was lacking and does not follow the books detail, and the ending is abrupt and does not sit well with me .Also having had some experience with such things makes me feel the story is a bit unrealistic in general. If you are into heroin culture you might enjoy this in spite of that, I enjoyed it alright. I just did not LOVE it the way I loved, say, drugstore cowboy.",1410912000,,1077,4.233009708737864

2701106,1,B000LAZDPG,"Boring and completely uninspired.  Well acted, but the smugness of the Dan character was a bit bewildering, for he is depicted as nothing more than a lazy whining slob without talent who finds someone he can prostitute for his habit. End story.  If this were a love story, it was not about the heterosexual couple, but rather the under explored relationship of Dan and his beloved gay professor.  Which is what I watched the entire movie hoping to flesh that obvious relationship out...the highs were boring, the lows were boring...as one review said, ""I like it better when it was called Trainspotting""",1405123200,,603,4.892156862745098
2701107,4,B000LAZDPG,"Great performances by Heath Ledger, Abbie Cornish, and Geofry Rush.  Sad romance between Dan, a hopeless addict, and Candy who joins him in his lifestyle.  They hustle and scam their way through, sometimes mooching off of Casper, a drugged out academic.  Candy eventually resorts to casual prostitution and Dan isn't bothered by it, but she certainly is and becomes disappointed in him.  I'll leave it there, because as sympathetic as Dan appears to be, that's when you want to yell at him to stop this craziness.  A good movie, and interesting look at bohemian life in Australia.",1402790400,2,580,4.938144329896907

I am a substance abuse counselor, I purchased this to give my clients some insight into the dynamics of an unhealthy ""using"" relationship.  There is a great deal of frontal nudity in this movie which I did not expect.  There is also a scene where Candy delivers a still born baby which Health Ledger holds in full view of the camera.

2701135,5,B000LAZDPG,"I absolutely love this movie! I've seen most of the movies the late Heath Ledger made and ""Candy"" is one of my favorites. The movie takes place in Australia and is about a heroin-addicted couple, Dan and Candy, who are in love. Their addiction not only creates much drama and pain for themselves but for those who love them as well. The movie is dark in much the same way as the 1987 film ""Barfly"" with Mickey Rourke and Faye Dunaway is but lighter. In the end there is redemption.  Abbie Cornish plays Candy and Geoffrey Rush plays Casper, an older man who is their friend, benefactor, and dope peddler. Despite the brokenness of the three characters -- Dan, Candy, and Casper -- they sincerely love each other. Unfortunately, they love heroin more and will do anything from prostitution to theft in order to obtain it. The three actors are Australian. I haven't seen Heath Ledger act in a film wherein he can speak in his native Australian accent. It's lovely to hear.  However, I wish the movie was subtitled or captioned in English for the hearing impaired because for an American like me it was difficult at times to follow the Australian dialogue. The acting is superb, especially from the three. Heath Ledger in particular portrays a weak, vulnerable yet loving character I'd never before seen him perform, with the possible exception of ""Monster's Ball"".  If you're a Heath Ledger fan as I am, I think this is a movie you'll want to add to your collection.",1328745600,2,1464,4.666666666666667

It showed how the drugs at first gives them a strong connection of love, sex and friendship. Then it goes on and shows, how after a while of using heroin the relationship becomes tainted and and volatile.  Once clean and removed from each other for a while, there is some clarity from Dan about how the relationship really was, very unhealthy, codependent and dangerous. The acting in this if spot on, I don't know how I missed it in the theaters. Heath Ledger was a very talented actor its to bad that the reality of this movie caught up with him.

You watch them along their struggle and want to help them out of their problems and get them to drug-free happiness again.  I'm glad I bought this movie.  I seen it before I bought it, and after watching it, I knew I wanted to buy it.  I didn't know how well I would like it at first, but I do like it. But, if you're going to watch it, prepare yourself for some sadness.  This movie also includes one of my favorite actors in it...HEATH LEDGER!!  In my opinion, all his movies are great! I do recommend this movie...and all of Heath Ledger's movies as well.  May he rest in peace!",1277856000,,842,4.387096774193548

The story...the acting...the direction...the production values...all are extremely well done. This film is based on the book Candy, which I understand is largely autobiographical (and watching the film, one has this impression). I'd seen Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain (another devastating movie), and I must say that his performance here is every bit as accomplished; Abbie Cornish is also excellent. The fact that this film deals so openly, so honestly with addiction to hard drugs, I can only imagine, is the sole reason why it's never gained such wide appeal here in the US. This is a shame since Candy is not merely a 'drug film,' it's incredibly, wildly romantic, for instance. At least the Australians got it as it won all the big awards down under- as it well deserved.",1271376000,,899,4.921052631578948

Beautifully written, Luke Davies is a phenomenal poet/author. I can't get this movie out of my head, it's so haunting. Candy's mother (Noni Hazlehurst) is so perfect for her role, and Tony Martin, Candy's father, made me cry. I don't understand why this movie isn't more popular",1253404800,,420,4.6891891891891895
2701154,5,B000LAZDPG,"Candy is easily one of the best films about people addicted to heroin (or even drugs in general) that I've seen in quite some while. Although the two young lovers in this story are hooked on heroin, they are also hooked on each other and it is through their relationship that we get a very special focus on them as human beings with value and worth and not just two junkies who are difficult to like or possibly even identify with. Extra points get thrown in for outstanding performances by every actor in this movie, Heath Ledger as Dan and Abbie Cornish as Candy are completely convincing as are Geoffrey Rush as Casper, Tony Martin as Candy's father and Noni Hazlehurst as Candy's mother. The cinematography works wonders for this movie and the choreography reflects good judgment. The plot moves along at a good pace and I was never once bored. The script was well written and the musical score enhances the experience quite a bit.

When the action starts, we quickly meet bohemian poet and heroin addict Dan (Heath Ledger) who has a touching love affair with his girlfriend Candy (Abbie Cornish). They are both hooked on heroin when the picture starts but we get the distinct sense that there might be a real chance for Candy to kick the habit; Dan is already much too hooked to be able to quit without professional help. We see Dan and Candy love each other, fight with each other, drop into their friend Casper's (Geoffrey Rush) home for heroin or money to buy heroin, and we also see them alternately trying to avoid or tap Candy's parents for money. Candy's parents gradually begin to suspect Dan and Candy are using drugs when Dan has a trip and falls asleep on a coach as someone is speaking to him at their wedding reception although Candy is too far gone by that point to admit to her mother than she and Dan are junkies.

Unfortunately, the situation for Dan and Candy only gets worse; and this is a great reason why this film shows people why they would want to quit using heroin and drugs in general. Dan and Candy are so hard up for money to buy drugs that Candy turns to prostitution for money; and even though Dan doesn't like that he wants his heroin more than he wants Candy to be only with him.

Dan and Candy try to turn their lives around and quit when Candy discovers that she's pregnant--but will they be able to do it? They're quite hooked and not in any drug treatment program; but wow, how they try hard. Candy's parents continue to be kept in the dark; and Dan has no relationship at all with his parents so they practically don't even know he's alive much less using drugs or about to be a father. There's another question, too--what role will Casper play in their efforts to kick heroin? Will Casper do the right thing and withhold the drug from them or will he cave in himself? After all, Casper himself uses the drug even as he is given a great job teaching at a local university. No spoilers here--watch and find out!

The DVD comes with a few extras; two good ones are a short featurette about ""Candy's poem"" and the brief but very enjoyable ""making of"" featurette.

Overall, Candy is one outstanding movie that ranks very high in my book. I highly recommend this for fans of the actors in this movie; and people interested in the themes of drug addiction, love and the good and the bad that can come with love will enjoy this film as well.",1251936000,8,3376,4.46515397082658
2701155,3,B000LAZDPG,"For this viewer, the film starts to gain momentum when Ledger tries to fake his identity on the phone and cash in on someone else's credit cards. Then, the miscarriage scene gives some force. But there is way too much predictability in the script, and fairly two-dimensional acting from the two leads. Given the girl's interest in painting and drawing, it seemed a bit inconsistent, at the scene of her breakdown, that she chose to scrawl volumes of highly charged prose poetry(far superior to her doodlings and indebted to the C19th French Symbolists) on the house walls. Her acting in these moments of heightened intensity just don't convince. I've now seen Cornish in three recent films where she plays very similar loser/confused adolescent types. Hopefully more directorial skill will lift her stakes. I've never been a Ledger enthusiast, apart from Brokeback Mountain(and not having seen his post-humously awarded role), where his inarticulateness, and internalised dilemnas were perfectly married to the intent of Ang Lee's film. That said,the parting of ways in he final cafe scene was poignantly satisfying",1242432000,,1115,5.269662921348314

After that i was hooked. i think ledger's performance in this was better than in the dark knight. Abbie Cornish was outstanding. She had an everyday kind of beauty to her that made me attracted to her, but this naivety that repulsed me about her. Rush seemed to be in a comfortable role, but perfect and stylish.

Ledger, who hypnotized audiences with his recent Oscar winning performance as the Joker in the latest Batman movie, broke my heart as the passive Dan.  And Cornish won it as sweet, self destructive Candy.  I will say, that no story of love and drug addiction has ever been more engaging.  The chemistry between the two is riveting and doesn't feel forced.  The story line, while intense, never becomes unrealistic.  You don't get that over the top, ""we gotta make you cry"" feel while watching it.  But you will cry, and you will feel.  And at the end of the movie, you don't feel manipulated.  5 stars.

As Dan, Ledger goes to the heights of romance & depths of addiction.  His commitment to his work is breathtaking.

Abbie Cornish is amazing as Candy.

Her performance is as emotionally revealing as it is physically.  She fully embodies the role from anger to dementia.  The short scene where she plays with honey dripping from a table is chilling in its simplicity.

Candy's parents also do excellent work in this film.  Tony Martin plays the loving father Mr. Wyatt who always looks on the bright side and struggles to believe the best.  His strident wife who chronically fights with her daughter and finds fault with her is played with great panache by Noni Hazelhurst.

Neil Armfield directed the film with a screenplay by Luke Davies based on his book.  The movie is gripping and moves well, while the performances are breathtaking.  The DVD extras with Ledger talking about the role are interesting.  He said that this was a very hard film to do.  It was also a very hard film to watch.

It was definately something new for me in the way of a drug movie, but it wasn't completely about the heroin. It was also about love. There was love for each other, and love of the drug. Through the entire movie the viewer is left to figure out which love is paramount.

Heath did an amazing job portraying Dan. And Abbie Cornish did a very good job playing the title character Candy. The supporting cast was also very good and helped tie the movie together.

I will definately be purchasing a copy of this movie because it does say a lot about the relationships people have with each other, and how an addiction, be it anything, can effect them.

2701173,4,B000LAZDPG,"'Candy' is an Australian film, a love story between two junkies.  The movie divides itself into three parts: Heaven, Earth, and He||.  Dan (played by talented and memorable Heath Ledger - RIP Heath) and Candy (Abbie Cornish) have a love that's true.  Their highs are high and their lows are low.  At one point, after spiking up and nodding off during their wedding reception at Candy's parents, they sit outside McDonald's sipping chocolate shakes and declaring ""We're the coolest people at McDonald's"".

Their days are spent hitting up friends and family for money, stealing, hawking what possessions they have, and finally turning to prostitution to feed their heroin habits.  They speak of the clean life, yet scoff at it when their next fix is due.  Best friend Casper (Geoffrey Rush) winds out taking them in.  Casper is their homo$exual father figure and sometimes provider.  Dan and Candy's lifestyles go up and down, depending on their drug use.  Candy confesses to a rent-collector that ""I'm a prostitute and he's worthless, we don't have any money"".  Their lives deteriorate though pregnancy, miscarriage, and eventual nervous breakdown.  Can a love this true withstand the trials of heroin, heartbreak, time, and tragedy?

The movie is based on the novel 'Candy' written by Luke Davies.  (Watch for Davies in the film, in his cameo of the milkman)  The novel is one of the best books I've ever read, Davies puts a whisper of poetry into his words, making them beautiful and hypnotic.  While the movie stays close to the book, there is the added role of Casper, and the fact that Dan and Candy fight more in the film than in the book.  Certain parts are left out, like the lazy day spent picking crabs off each other.  If you like the movie, you really MUST read the book.  The acting is superb in this film (what a tragedy to lose Heath Ledger).  The costume designer captured the ""look"" of the addict, especially with Dan's greasy, unkept look.  The script was well done and the atmosphere is perfect.  Rent first, then buy.  Enjoy!",1223769600,6,2044,4.810344827586207

It is difficult and almost haunting to watch, knowing this was one of his last films. I found it to be a very true and realistic story of love...and drugs...and the affect drugs have on their lives in the story. Dan and Candy (the actress who played Candy also gave gave a very strong performance) had so much potential...she was an artist, a painter...and he was a poet. But, as their drug addiction grows stronger...we watch their lives go deeper and deeper into a downward spiral. They try to get their act together and clean up when Candy becomes pregnant...but she ends up miscarrying the child...and their spirits are truely broken after that. Through it all, you can always feel Dan and Candy's love for each other...but the drugs get in the way...and they become other people...Candy eventually has a nervous breakdown and goes to a hospital to get better. While she's recovering, Dan is slowly getting his life back together too. We see him finally getting a job...working as a dishwasher in a chinese restaraunt and clean and sober for once. You get the feeling he is on the mend...getting better...but he is still stuggling...and missing Candy. The final scene is what really got me...I watched it over and over again...because it was that good. When Candy is released from the hosptital, she comes to see Dan at the restaraunt he's working at. The love that they have for each other is very clear...but in a heart breaking moment...and a scene that is almost hard to watch because it so real and honest...Dan breaks down...(Ledger is amazing in this scene...I was crying with him)...because he knows he has to let Candy go. With tears in his eyes, he tells her there's no going back...they need to remember how clean things are right now. Up until the ending, I was glad enough to just have rented the movie...but after watching the final scene...I knew I wanted it in my dvd collection...even if only to watch that scene again and again. I apologize for giving too much of the story away here...but I hope that you do give this movie a tyr. It is worth seeing. It makes me so sad to think that we won't be blessed in Heath Ledger's talent anymore...and I'm already missing all the films he will never get the chance to do.",1219017600,2,2405,4.647887323943662

Those who have actually felt the gnawing desperation along with the highs of love and drug addiction will appreciate this film for it's authenticity and vulnerability. When one is addicted to anyone or anything nothing else matters, literally. Reviewers using the word cliche feel pretty clever I imagine. However there are no cliches in this movie for this is exactly how it is. The physical and emotional torture these two young actors endured to make this movie should emphasize how important they felt this project was. There are scenes that make you sit up in panic a moment after Candy asks to ""try it your way"", lean back in a daze trying to keep it from turning into dizziness as they circle each other in a blur, laugh at the pathetic hilarity as they load a washer into the trunk of their car and head to the pawn shop, feel the rush when they kiss as if they haven't seen each other in years or when the hit hits the bloodstream, the fist clenching grief of parents struggling to keep their composure as their baby girl lies to their face, and finally the deep sigh as the credits appear knowing that this is how it must end whether we want it to or not.

The book this movie was based on was an okay book with some amazing parts and the movie is pretty much the same (perhaps having the writer of the book also co-write the screenplay had something to do with it).

It's a movie about despondent youth who turn to drugs for a more vibrant life and not realizing until it's too late at what cost.  There are plenty of movies with the same theme and nothing about this film stood out above the rest.

The acting was great but the movie started with Dan (Heath Ledger) and Candy (Abby Cornish) already using drugs and I never felt attached to them as characters until much later.  The viewer always assumed that Dan was the reason Candy started using but we discover that Abby's childhood was not all rosey as it first seemed and that Candy was the one more strongly dependent on drugs.

2701194,3,B000LAZDPG,"Ah, the drug film. A genre unto its own, drug films tend to either a.) Portray drug addiction as a horrific nightmare (""Requiem for a Dream"") b.)Use it as a tool for dark, twisted comedy (""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"") or c.) Some combination of the two (""Trainspotting""). ""Candy"" is clearing aiming for the a) category, portraying young Australian lovers Dan and Candy, whose lives spin out of control when they become heroin junkies.

If the subject wasn't so familiar in modern cinema, this film might have been powerful and shocking, but since so many superior films have already covered familiar territory, the film comes across as derivative at best and melodramatic at its worst. The film is clearly aiming to show how degrading drug addiction is, so we see Dan and Candy stealing, lying, living in squalor and prostituting themselves to feed their habit. Often the film goes so over the top that instead of being shocking, my reaction was more like ""Oh, come on!"" ... the most obvious example being when Dan and Candy are left in the hospital to cuddle with their dead, stillborn baby.

What saves the film is the performances. Heath Ledger is terrific, fleshing out the lazy, self-indulgent, romantic and ultimately more practical character of Dan. (And I'm not just giving him props because of the circumstances of his recent tragic death). Geoffrey Rush also gives a fine supporting performance playing Dan and Candy's flamboyant ""mentor"". Abbie Cornish gives a decent performance (though not on the same level as Ledger or Rush), but her character is written as so histrionic that it's hard to imagine any actress really excelling in the role.

2701196,3,B000LAZDPG,"""Candy"" - not to be confused with the 1968 comedy of the same title.

Heath Ledger and Abbie Cornish give great performances as Dan and Candy, couple in love both addicted to heroin in this small Aussie film. It is the world of the characters who say they can and will change tomorrow but they don't. Like Al Pacino in ""The Panic in Needle Park,"" the film works as convincing portrait of the youth who has nowhere to go, who knows virtually nothing about themselves and their life except that they are slowly going down.

My 3 star rating is based solely on the authenticity of each episode, not the way they are connected to one another. Director Neil Armfield (also respected theater director) knows how to tap the depth of actors' skills, but still couldn't overcome the episodic nature of the source material. (The film is based on a book by Luke Davies who also co-wrote the script with the director). About 30 minutes in, we realize that for all the riveting turns from the actors and three-dimensional characters the film offers familiar things except the very impressive ending. Even the fantastic support (more like a cameo) from Geoffrey Rush as ""chemist"" Casper couldn't change that.

""Candy"" is well-acted and often depressing, but not as devastating as ""Requiem for a Dream"" thanks to the romantic side of the story, love-hate relation between Candy and Dan, which could have been explored more.",1192752000,18,1408,4.809917355371901

You get the bad -- the crippling agony of going cold turkey, the violent rages when demanding a fix, a miscarriage and emotional pain on top of withdrawal, and so on.  There are also the rare moments of beauty, of the enjoyment of life driving in the sunlight with the top down.  The scenes are rounded out with the pure strangeness of drug havens, such as the juxtaposition of Geoffrey Rush playing Microsoft Flight Simulator while a tan cabana boy in an orange Speedo lounges in the background.

Individual scenes are compelling, moving, and shocking, but as a whole, the film doesn't leave an impression.  This is a repackaging of vignettes that have been told before (and in much better films, like Requiem for a Dream, or, on the lighter side, Spun).  Everything in Candy has been done before, and in better quality works.  This is not to say that the acting isn't first rate, or that there aren't amazing scenes. but Candy as a whole is just not a memorable film.

My cynical side wonders if the director believed that ""gorgeous people ruined by drugs!!!"" was enough of a premise for a movie, and focused merely on scandalous scenes of drug use, rather than the film as a whole.  I'm a junkie for movies about addiction and psychological pain, so I had to watch this one, but it isn't one I'll be recommending to friends.",1177200000,16,1672,4.514950166112957
2701199,5,B000LAZDPG,"""Candy"" is a poignant little drama dealing with both drugs and a relationship, and more specifically the drugs that affect that relationship.

Heath Ledger gives one of his best performances as Dan, a heroin addict who meets Candy (Abbie Cornish), at first a young innocent girl. Immediately, Dan and Candy become inseparable wanting to do everything together. Pretty soon, Candy is also a heroin addict and the couple are scrambling to get money to feed their habit...Meanwhile, there is their friend Casper (Geoffrey Rush, who gives Oscar-worthy supporting work) who both encourages them to quit, but supplies them when they need any.

Now, I've seen a lot of drug movies, great ones (Requiem for a Dream, Spun, A Scanner Darkly, Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas, Jesus' Son, etc.); But never until this one have I seen a drug movie that could actually convince people to stop doing drugs or to never do them at all. The filmmakers went incredibly realistic for their portrayal of drug use and how it affects people and many of the scenes were painful to watch. The withdrawal scene in particular is agonizing, as is the following ""labor"" scene...All the performances in this film are incredible; Especially Ledger, Rush, and Cornish. The script, based on a novel by Luke Davies, doesn't go for all the cliches that have made up many other movies before it. ""Candy"" is a movie that had it not been such a small production, it could've scored some Oscar nominations...This is a great little film and I highly recommend that if you're reading this you see it.

8160505,5,B000LAZDPG,"I had forgotten about this film until it a few days ago when my son mentioned Heath Ledger.  I also forgot how truly impactful this story is; and how devastatingly it rings after the real-life demise of it's main character's actor.

Candy is a dark tale with both dramatic and beautiful undertones.  It is a story about love (perhaps even falling in love with the ""wrong person""), the troughs of addiction, and the calamitous repercussions that users and their non-using counterparts experience at the hands of drug use.

I don't know if I can truly and amply convey my deep inner connection to this movie, so the best I can do is run through several distinctive thoughts as a means to explain or express plot points and overall thoughts.

*The acting is stellar.  The title character ""Candy"" is portrayed by the beautiful Abby Cornish (Limitless, Suckerpunch).  Her character is rich and layered.  In the beginning of the film she is a sweet, somewhat innocent, girl-next-door type, who by the end of the film has lived through wretched times as a result of her relationship with Dan (Heath Ledger).  Dan is an avid heroin user with a charming personality; but the decline of the couple as years pass is not just incredibly saddening...it is a very accurate depiction of the perilous affliction of hardcore drug use over time.

*If you have a sensitivity to birth-related tragedy (abortion, miscarriage, stillborn, or SIDS, etc), I may recommend you prepare yourself for an EXTREMELY graphic and detailed scene involving something of the like-and if it's not something you feel inclined to handle well, you may refrain from watching the film entirely.  Regardless of a sensitivity through personal experience, this scene will rip your heart out of your chest while simultaneously enraging you.  You have been warned.

*If you know someone, or yourself have experienced the going-ons of addiction, you will understand and view this from a very separate space than someone who does not.

*This is a beautifully made, thought-provoking, emotion-inspiring movie down to the subtle camera movement and still shots, to the overall message delivered.  You will explore the depths of hell while still finding beauty; find hope in the darkest pit of despair, explore sadness in moments that would otherwise promote relief.  There is an extensive amount of unnaturally coexisting emotion, and it will resonate long after the credits roll.

A truly provocative film.",1472169600,,2456,5.069651741293533
8160506,5,B000LAZDPG,"The DVD came in great condition for being a previously ""used"" DVD. The movie was amazing, a real tear-jerker, and a great love story. It was nice to see Heath Ledger play a role in his native Australian accent and he claims it was one of the reasons he chose to take this role, as he was allowed to improvise freely in certain parts of the film. In most of his Hollywood Movies he claimed to have to learn and stick to an American accent to keep the roles coming in, so this was a really nice change for him I read that he has been quoted as saying. Overall, the movie was great and I would highly recommend it.",1467331200,,611,4.1
