2024017,5,B0001S6AQE,"This is a pricey set to be sure but there is a reason for it -- the good people releasing this set had to shell out some serious dollars to get clearance to use artists' music that was ""appropriated"" when the shows were created.

oh right. sorry. You know, people say to me Johnny, what's your secret? How did you make it so big? Well, I worked hard..cuz I got plenty of nothin', and nothin's plenty for me..I got the sun in the mornin' and the moon at night..Luv a good Negro spiritual..
While I appreciate the love of all the American fans, as a Canadian (expatriate) in all seriousness, you can NEVER know the love we hosers have for this show and its cast. I was blessed to have seen almost all the cast members live growing up in Toronto (including A Night With John Candy at University of Toronto in 1980) and this group of performers was--withooot a doooot--the greatest array of comedic genius on television..EVER.
Although we will, sadly, never get to see Dr. Tongue--The Movie: This Time It's French""--we are all lucky to have on film the comedic brilliance of SCTV.

2024019,3,B0001S6AQE,"This isn't so much a review as a complaint. Yes, I agree that SCTV in its prime was one of the funniest shows ever (and these episodes are easily funnier than the earlier Harold Ramis ones). However, how can the studio justify $63 for it? Most other ""Complete Season"" DVD packages are half that price. The episodes themselves deserve 5 stars, but for this price gouging, I have to deduct 2 stars. I am peeved because I would LOVE having this set, but my principles won't allow me to be suckered into overpaying. I guess I'll just rent it frequently from Netflix. [Another complaint: for $63, they should have been able to acquire the rights to the original songs in the sketches (there will be quite a few edits/changes for this DVD because of lack of rights).]",1082678400,10,761,4.562043795620438

Pieces of this series have been thrown together and rebroadcast as 30 minute reruns on Canadian cable channels but there not the same shown out of context.
Some classics from network 90 include (not necessarily from season 1):
""The Andy Griffith Show starring Merv Griffin"" with Rick Moranis as Merv. ""Ouuuu, Aunt Bee's bringing us lunch!""
John Candy staring in Monster Chiller Horror Theater's presentaion of ""Dr. Tounge's 3D House of Stewardesses."" Don't forget to buy those 3D-Glasses from Count Floyd.
""Indira"" with Indira Ghandi staring as Evita (Andrian Martin). Singing ""Don't cry for me Rawalpindi""
""Perry Como, Still Alive!"" Dave Thomas as a laid back Perry Como making a comeback with a Disco act. This was the clip shown at the Emmy Awards. The next year the real Perry got a special award. I think half the audience thought he was dead and the other half felt sorry for him.
And of course Bob and Doug Mckenzie, filling the CBC's requirement for ""Canadian Content."" Frying back bacon and drinking Molsen. How much more Canadian can you get, you hoser!",1081814400,7,1332,4.7956521739130435
2024022,5,B0001S6AQE,"FINALLY this is getting released on DVD!!  There's just no comparison - SCTV was THE best sketch comedy show ever aired on television, cable included.  Every cast member went on to major productions & became heavy hitters in the comedy field.  And to the reviewer above - Harold Ramis a LIGHTWEIGHT?  Ever hear of ""Stripes"" and ""Ghostbusters""?
Here's why this took so long to get to DVD - notice it's not NBC Entertainment releasing it, but that company formed by several smart Rhino Video executives, Shout.  Seems NBC threw up it's hands in surrender trying to secure all the music & ancillary rights for a DVD release, so they sold their rights to Shout, said ""Good Luck Suckers"" and thought they made a great business move!  Little did they know Shout has made a conscious effort to chase down all these shows with hard-to-secure rights, knowing there's a huge pre-set market for selling them.  Good for them!

2024035,4,B0001S6AQE,"Partial cast: John Candy, Eugene Levy, Andrea Martin, Rick Moranis, Catherine O'Hara, and Dave Thomas

SCTV, or second city, was a 90 minute comedy program broadcast on NBC.  90 minutes is a lot of time to fill in drama; in comedy, it's a monumental task.  Comedy shows like it, or Saturday Night Live, have a certain quality quotient: maybe 1/2 the skits are good and 1/2 are not very good.  The problem with SCTV(to the extent it never made a mark on network TV) was that 1/2 of a show in their case was 45 minutes...a network cannot have 45 minutes in prime time with poor entertainment and/or low ratings.
The ensemble cast that SCTV started with was great.  You later saw their fingerprints on any number of movies, especially John Candy, Eugene Levy, etc.  Here is another differentiation between SCTV and SNL: with Saturday Night Live, their skits were topical and the lead sketch was always great...real watercooler material.  With SCTV, they were not live but taped and they were never topical.  The humor had to be timeless and not topical.
I will make your decision easy: if you liked SCTV or much of the cast, then get this.  If on the other hand you were not a big fan of this type of humor, then just keep on truckin'.  This was a real 'inside joke' show where you either 'got with it' and loved their clever take on things, or you found it unfunny, even grating...Again, this 'love it or hate it' aspect was the reason that SCTV is not celebrating its umpteenth year on the air like SNL...",1432857600,,1504,4.516605166051661

However this DVD set has no program guide, and the DVDs have no subtitles.  The only extras are some interviews with cast members at some festival, which really didn't excite me much.  For such an expensive set, I would hope they would give you a bit more -- hope this will come out on blu ray some time (dream on?) with extras this show deserves.",1424304000,2,652,4.327868852459017

2024039,4,B0001S6AQE,"Growing up I recall watching SCTV every Saturday night before SNL. That is why I purchased this first volume.  Positives: This boxed set contains some really funny skits with all of the actors you now see as successes in other shows.  John Candy, Dave Thomas, Catherine O'Hara, Rick Moranis, Andrea Martin, Joe Flaherty, and Eugene Levy.
Negatives: This DVD set took skits from the shows and sandwiched them between the SCTV logo and jingle.  In some cases they play the logo two or three times which implies that they wanted to insert a skit but did not.  This gets annoying after a while.  Also, some of the skits are dated and therefore not very funny.  But these are far and few between.  If all of the skits were hysterical gems the show would have been on the air longer than three seasons.
In General:  I still laughed and in some cases recalled pleasant memories of Saturday nights in front of the TV growing up.
That made it well worth the money.",1407888000,2,955,4.543859649122807

The fact that it's made like this on purpose makes the humor all the more enjoyable. The characters are each funny in their own right.

2024043,5,B0001S6AQE,"SCTV was one of the greatest comedy shows on TV. It was, unfortunately, only offered very late night, after Saturday Night Live starting at 1 in the morning in the NYC area. As such, many are unfamiliar with the show itself though they are very familiar with the actors, almost all of whom have gone on to star in movies and tv. As would be expected from a 90 minute show, not every skit is hilarious. However, many are. Despite the dated look (this is from the 70's ) the excellent take-off's on celebrities and tv/movie shows are acutely funny with outright laughter spontaneously occurring. The cast is fabulous. The skits are sharp witted and far ahead of prime time tv. In fact the only show that comes close is the old Saturday Night Live with many SCTV alumni in their cast. This is terrific tv for those who can appreciate comedy on a high satiric level.",1375056000,3,862,4.496815286624204
2024044,4,B0001S6AQE,It's a little dated but if your an sctv fan you will enjoy it. You have to have lived in the era when they played old movies on tv to get the humor.,1367971200,,148,3.515151515151515

2024047,5,B0001S6AQE,"I've been an SCTV fan since the early 80s, first when it was just a syndicated 30-minute show from Canada, and then when NBC picked it up.  It was better and more consistent than SNL ever was, and had better musical acts.  Great to see it finally on DVD, though $45 a season is a bit ridiculous.

If you aren't familiar with SCTV, here's the thing:  It is almost entirely based on parodies of the TV shows, celebrities, and culture of the time.  So, if you didn't grow-up in the 70s or before, chances are you aren't going to get any of it.  I can only assume that is the reason for most of the bad reviews.  If you are in your 40s or older and you have any sense of humor, you have to love this stuff.  If you are younger than that, it's probably not going to mean anything to you.  The old SNL may be a bit more accessible to people who didn't grow up with it, but SCTV is really a creature of it's time.

So, if you are old enough to remember the popular culture of the 70s and early 80s, then you will love this stuff.  If not, you probably won't get much of it.",1338249600,,1066,4.004739336492891
2024048,4,B0001S6AQE,"I knocked off a star for its user unfriendly menu. Unlike later volumes which tell you what is on each episode, this just has listing like ""Episode 6"" or ""Chapter 3"" on the onscreen menu.

That's a moot point though as there is so many classic SCTV bits on here, you'll be rolling on the floor in pain from the laughter. The Johnny LaRue stuff I thought would date itself but that John Candy laugh just slays me every time. From 3-D House of Stewardesses to Angus Crock via Poochare and Brooke Shields (as played by Catherine O'Hara) doing the Devo tune ""Whip It,"" this is comedy gold.

The extras are nothing really to write home about and I'd like to see this rereleased with a more informative onscreen menu so you can scoot through and pick your fave bits to replay.",1322956800,,770,4.415492957746479

Not all the skits or episodes are great, but enough is for an A+ IMO.  Especially funny are the skits with Bob and Doug McKenzie, Count Floyd's horror show (esp. the ""3D"" horror scenes), the Farm Film movie reviews (""it blowed up real good""), and the SCTV owners/workers.  It kinda makes me think of a cross between Monty Python and Saturday Night Live, though there's no real way to describe SCTV's humor as it is unique!",1264032000,,590,4.288288288288288
2024053,5,B0001S6AQE,"To me the SCTV cast had a better collection of talent that the SNL of the same time.  This DVD of Season 1 of the NBC version has some great moments, although, like most sketch shows, not every sketch is a gem.  I loved the premise of SCTV--low budget network in drab Melonville featuring crass management and a mostly wannabe collection of personalities.  It was great to see the actors and old characters again- Andrea Martin as Station Manager Edith Prickly, Eugene Levy as hapless newsman Earl Camembert, Rick Moranis as VJ Jerry Todd (the schmaltzy video version of Turning Japanese is a scream), John Candy as Orson Welles-wannabe Johnny LaRue, and the gang from The Sammy Maudlin Show--Joe Flaherty as Sammy, Candy as sidekick William B. Williams, Levy as funnyman (and a comic in all seriousness) Bobby Bittman, and Catherine O'Hara as ""I wanna bear your children"" songstress Lola Heatherton.

Highlights from Disc 1 include the Maudlin show (featuring Andrea Martin as a very bemused Mother Theresa), Rick Moranis as Woody Allen trying to make a movie with Dave Thomas as Bob Hope in ""Play It Again, Bob"", Thomas as Japanese talk show host Tim Ishimuni interviewing the Godzilla-like monster Grogan, and the made-for-SCTV movie ""Polynesian Town"", featuring John Candy as clueless filmmaker and star Johnny LaRue.  I look forward to seeing other favorites like Count Floyd and Dr. Tongue of Monster Chiller Horror Theatre, and Dave Thomas as the host of 3CP Russian television.

Somewhat surprisingly, the one feature from SCTV that made it in American pop culture, Moranis and Thomas as Bob and Doug MacKenzie in ""The Great White North"" is none too funny in this disc. I'm sure they'll get to The 12 Days of Christmas (""five golden toques!"") in one of the later discs.",1170720000,3,1777,4.926421404682274

This is sketch/satirical comedy at it's best. Have there been comedy shows that are its equal?  Of course there are other great comedy shows but nothing exceeds it. Not by a long shot!

For viewers like me, this is not the ground-breaking show that used to be seen late night alongside other shows like Sha Na Na and The Hudson Brothers.  Nope.  This is what the show became after it was a success.  Harold Ramis is nowhere to be seen.  Reoccurring characters like Count Floyd are tired and stale.  Much of the humor centers around the move to a big network (this gets old fast).

The prints are quite clear but they are too complete.  By that I mean that all of the station identification spots have been left in (sometimes three in a row for the longer commercial breaks).  In the end I was quite sorry I had made this purchase.  It is no wonder the ratings on NBC dropped as fast as they did.  If you are looking for the classic shows that made careers, these are not them.  But if your first experiences with SCTV were on NBC then this will be as you remember.

SCTV with people like John Candy, Joe Flaherty, Eugene Levy, Andra Martin, Harold Ramis(who appeared in one season, but appeared in a couple of scenes in the set, he is still funny)Rick Moranis, Cathrine O Hara, and Dave Thomas it can't be beat.

This cast is just the greatest. The show is tremendous as well. One great episode is called Polynesiantown, a spoof of Chinatown. It was an ""SCTV Movie Of The Week"" which starred Johnny LaRue as the owner of a Polynesian resturant. This scene is very famous for the craine shot at the beginning and end of the film, which made the actual SCTV episode go over budget and the episode was slammed by critics. This too would happen in the makebelieve town of Mullionvillie and SCTV, and a whole other episode would devote time to the problem of the craine shot. That scene is other noted for the appearence of musical guest Dr. John, a big rock star at the time who actually played a part in the scene. Through out SCTV's run on NBC, musical guest actually played a part in the story line, giving them alot to do. The scene was very and the whole show was as a whole. The show that could compare to this is the orginal SNL where the cast were power hungry and become stars to early. The cast of SCTV(except John Candy) didn't become major stars during there stint. But they would all become household names for years to come. Very one knows Eugene Levy in movies like Splash A Mighty Wind, Waiting For Guffman, Best In Show, Bringing Down The House and teens will regonize him in all three of the American Pie movies. Catherine O'Hara would be popular in the first two Home Alone movies, Beetlejuice, and both A Mighy Wind, Waiting For Guffman, and Best In Show, appearing with Levy.  Dave Thomas was a regular on Grace Under Fire. And Rick Moranis was the star of all three Honey I Shrunk The Kids films. Martin is a Broadway star, Ramis is a big time comedy director, and Flaherty was on Freaks and Geeks. This was a powerhouse cast that lit up t.v with this classic show, and these dvds is a must for any comedy lover's collection to treasure.",1111449600,6,2815,4.913865546218488
2024061,5,B0001S6AQE,"While Saturday Night Live added a hip-edge to the television variety show, it was in many ways more of a return to TV's live performance roots than a revolution in comedy. SCTV, ""the little show from Canada that could,"" was the late '70s and early '80s real innovator.

A comparison between SNL and SCTV is in some ways akin to comparing McDonald's and Burger King: each had a unique premise that shaped everything they did. Burger King (in its day) was a slave to the pace of a flame-broiler, while McDonald's pre-cooked. Likewise, SNL wrote, staged, and performed a show in 6 days. They worked in front of a live audience and were beholden to the pace (i.e., waiting out laughs) that such an arrangement dictated. SCTV was performed for cameras, and had time to write, edit, digest, reduce, and re-use in a way SNL never could.

The result is that SNL pushed towards catch-lines and easily identifiable, repeatable characters. SCTV, on the other hand, evolved into an ever more complex tapestry of comedy, irony and parody that wrapped around and glided through their sketches. Further, the isolation of their Canadian studio location (particularly the Edmonton years) kept the cast a true ensemble. Unlike the ego wars of SNL, SCTV remained largely devoid of breakout stars through its entire run.

At the heart of SCTV's success is the concept (or conceit) that the program was day-in-the-life of a low-end television network. The programs present a seamless intertwining of the ""SCTV Network"" programming and the characters and traumas which fictionally produced it. Even the musical guests (which in this set include Dr. John, The Tubes, Roy Orbison, and Robert Gordon) have their performances (both musical and acting) woven into the sketches. Real-world production incidents, such as the ""Polynesian Town"" budget overrun, are worked into the characters' lives, and the show develops continuity from week to week, rather than resetting the characters' history each time they appear in a new sketch.

These 90-minute shows created for NBC (following the show's original 30 minute syndicated version) include fantastic wrapper material that stiches the sketches together. Lola Heatherton's cancelled special, Johnny LaRue's budget problems and subsequent demotion, and the McKenzie Brother's off-set hunt for a topic all provide the sort of mind-bending transitions from foreground to background wrought by films like ""A Face in the Crowd.""

SCTV's writers are geniuses of hybridizing their influences. They'll spin a Fantasy Island parody through a Hope & Crosby road picture, Casablanca, and The Wizard of Oz, cross Merv Griffin with Andy Griffith, or feature Bing Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. At its peak SCTV reaches the level of surreal layering that Firesign Theater pioneered on LP. Personal favorites include Gil ""The Fishin' Musician"" Fisher, Sammy Maudlin, Lola Heatherton, Bobby Bittman, Hollywood producer Larry Siegel, Mel's Rockpile, Gerry ""Good Video"" Todd (and the Todd Monroe videos and Crazy Hy's commercials that he shows), and periodic skewerings of Woody Allen and Bob Hope.

That said, one must also admit that these shows don't provide the same rush they did when first broadcast, though perhaps it's unfair to expect them to do so. Twenty-five years of comedy inspired by these originals can't help but change the context in which these are now viewed. The clubby nature of being an SCTV fan was part of its charm, as were late-night viewing hours, the social setting against which these shows were viewed, and the ephemeral nature of TV-before-DVD. There is some terrific material here, but viewers are likely to find themselves skipping and picking. A few of the characters (such as Andrea Martin's European cleaning lady) get tiresome, and the canned laughter can be truly annoying.

Most of the extras are skippable. Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty's commentary, as well as a short piece on John Candy, shed little light. The one truly worthwhile piece is a 1990 cast reunion with Conan O'Brien as the interviewer. Overall this is a great reminder of what a towering invention SCTV was, and 25 years later on, what a huge impact it made on comedy.",1109894400,18,4178,5.135294117647059
2024062,5,B0001S6AQE,"Understated, nuanced, intellectual, and character-driven in the extreme, SCTV was a show that many people didn't ""get,"" and some people flat out didn't like.

But to me, it joins Monty Python, Saturday Night Live, and Your Show of Shows in the all-time greats of TV ensemble comedy. And where Saturday Night Live relied on the forceful personalities of stars like Eddie Murphy and Dan Akroyd for individual skits, SCTV created a whole world of characters that played out the drama of a small television station. At the same time, it also used the standard fare of comedy TV satire -- imitations of stars like Bob Hope, Woody Allen, Merv Griffin -- but integrated them into the show's wacky worldview in such an offbeat way as to leave one's mouth hanging open.

This volume seems to contain the first 90-min season's shows, the first few of which collect snippets from older shows. Some of these are among the classics: Merv Griffith, Night School H-Q, Polynesiantown, Play it Again Bob (which has to be one of the most subtle and best realized movie satires ever), and Sammy Maudlin (with Bobby Bitman's unforgettable interview for the Senate drug committee). The later episodes in the collection start the themed shows -- the PBS-style fundraiser with the Elephant Man (the punchline of which Saturday Night Live blatantly ripped off), and Lola Heatherton's breakdown during her TV special.

Especially wonderful on this set are the extras, which are worth the price of admission alone. These include terrific interviews with living cast members about the show, reminicences about John Candy, and interviews with the wardrobe and makeup people. From the interviews it is evident that the shows were created in the same spirit we fans perceived them -- as if the the cast and staff were totally invested in their characters and were trying like hell simply to make each other laugh. The producers of this set really knew where the fan's hearts were when they made this box! Just wonderful, and moving as well.

A drawback is that the box doesn't have an index or table of contents, so you have to skip among the discs to find your favorite episodes. A simple list would have been handy; but that's a minor complaint.",1109721600,2,2217,4.872679045092839
2024063,5,B0001S6AQE,"For those of us who saw the magic back in the early 80s, the days of looking at endless VCR tapes from ""back in the day"" are over as the NBC broadcast of SCTV episodes have been encapsulated for us to enjoy once again. Needless to say, if you weren't there, you probably won't get it. But for those of us who were, some, like me, would have paid 10 times the amount paid to see SCTV again. SCTV, and the cast which comprised it, is brilliant comedy. Like Monty Python, it is a thinking man's (or woman's) comedy. You may be fooled by the slapstick and the bad impersonation, but underneath is sophisticated and intelligently funny. The characters are unique, and the punch lines still parroted today by purists. The Christmas Special and the CCCP1 parody will forever be memorialized as some of the best comedy I ever saw. I promise. Thank you Dave Thomas, John Candy, Joe Flaherty, Catherine O'Hara, Andrea Martin, Rick Moranis and Eugene Levy for remembering my teenage years so fondly.",1107820800,4,988,4.619318181818182
2024064,5,B0001S6AQE,"First a couple of gripes.  Damn, this set is expensive!  I take it that what drove the price up, as well as held up the release of these shows for so long, was getting the rights from the various musical acts featured on the 90 minute show.  The majority of these groups are not exactly household names these days, and while their performances and interactions are decent enough, do not constitute the highlights of SCTV comic genius.  Anyway, the price is prohibitive enough that none of the local video marts is carrying the set.

Notwithstanding, the comedy is sublime.  It reaches that rare stratosphere where the routines seem to have been created to fulfill the adventurous nature of the performers, with little concern for tailoring it to a mass audience.  Kovacs, Python, early Letterman maybe, but only Firesign shared SCTV's ability to take an underlying concept and grow it in a way to allow the comedy to get wilder and more intimate simultaneously.

Members of this troup moved on to various levels of scattered success.  It's good to see Catherine and Gene prospering in Chris Guest's ensemble pieces. (I used to feel sorry for Eugene Levy, and now he seems to be the second lead in just about every comedy movie being made these days.) But nothing they or anybody else has come up with lately surpasses those great years in Edmonton.",1106352000,3,1348,4.775862068965517
2024065,5,B0001S6AQE,"I got hooked on SCTV back in 1981; however, I was sad to see ""Midnight Special"" cancelled in the late Friday timeslot.

I began watching when, channel surfing, I came across the Merv Griffin/Liberace skit with Lou Ferrigno, which is in this volume.

HOWEVER

I distinctly recall in a 1981 broadcast that at one point Merv and Liberace were oooh-ing and aaaah-ing over Ferrigno's biceps or pecs, and an angry Ferrigno said, ""Hey, You guys sound like a couple of..."" interrupted by Merv: ""We'll be right back!""

I cracked up and was immediately hooked.

But this isn't in the DVD! So... what happened? Did the producers fear a Merv Griffin lawsuit or something?

SCTV's humor always seemed more ""in the know"" as you needed a background in bad movies and bad tv shows from the past (and my friends lived and thrived on obscure and bad pop culture) in order to really find SCTV hilarious. SNL was more drug addled and goofy. SCTV was far better written than SNL.

These shows are still very funny. Love it!",1103846400,6,437,4.329268292682927

I found the commentary offered by Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty to be delightful, and the other extras (Remembering John, and the Aspen Comedy Festival, to name but two) quite wonderful.  It is a must-own for serious comedy lovers.",1100649600,3,380,4.478260869565218
2024069,5,B0001S6AQE,"Unlike many who have watched this set, I am a new convert to SCTV. This never aired where I lived when it was a first run show, so I had only heard of the understated Canadian brilliance that is SCTV until this set was released. Although expensive, this DVD set is one of the true gems in my collection, and I already have had my money's worth out of it.

The entire cast is great (although I am not much of a John Candy fan, he is generally excellent in SCTV, particularly doing impersonations such as Alfred Hitchcock), but I think the standouts are easily the two women, Andrea Martin and Catherine O'Hara, who never fail to make me laugh. In particular the recurrent character of non-English speaking Vice President of Program Coordination Pirini Scleroso (Martin) is the single funniest feature of the set. I especially enjoy the guest editorial by Pirini when crabby manager Guy Caballero is out of the room (at one point she answers the phone with ""Sell forty shares!""), and her visit to the English for beginners classroom. Martin also excels in the musical ""Indira"" and with O'Hara in the hilarious episode of ""Monster Chiller Horror Theatre"" (another recurring favorite) featuring the ""Ingmar Burgman"" film ""Whispers of the Wolf,"" which is a devastatingly accurate send-up of Bergman. The other Martin bit that I prize is ""Mrs. Falbo's Tiny Town,"" which is the most surreal children's show ever conceptualized. Eugene Levy also proves excellent in virtually every sketch: watch for him as Gino Vanelli and as the host of ""Mel's Rock Pile,"" which features the funniest presentation of ""MacArthur Park"" in history. I also love Joe Flaherty as Slim Whitman, who sings with everyone from Indira Gandhi to Barbra Streisand to great comedic effect.

My favorite sketches include the Guy Caballero and Pirini Scleroso dialogues, ""Monster Chiller Horror Theatre"" (""Doctor Tongue's 3-D House of Stewardesses"" and ""Whispers of the Wolf""), the Edith Prickley monologues, ""The Larry Siegel Show,"" ""The Great White North,"" ""Farm Film Report,"" ""Mrs. Falbo's Tiny Town,"" ""Spray-On Socks,"" ""High-Q,"" and ""The Brooke Shields Show.""

Of course along with the winners come a few clunkers. My least favorite storyline was the ""Polynesiantown"" spectacle, which was never really all that funny and was extremely long. I found the ""Leave It to Beaver 25th Anniversary"" sketch to be boring and not especially entertaining, either. The only recurring character I disliked was that of Bobby Bittman, which is surprising because I generally like Levy so much. I just think it is repetitive and falls flat quickly.

In summary, I am delighted that I have finally been introduced to SCTV. It is brilliant, far funnier than Saturday Night Live, and is now available to comedy lovers everywhere. Buy this set if you want to laugh for a long time.",1098230400,11,2825,5.004255319148936
2024070,5,B0001S6AQE,"SCTV was simply the best comedy sketch show ever aired. Its conceptual brilliance and respect for viewers' intelligence exceeded even Monty Python's Flying Circus, and the cast of its Golden Period--John Candy, Joe Flaherty, Eugene Levy, Andrea Martin, Rick Moranis, Catherine O'Hara, and Dave Thomas--was better and stronger than any cast in the history of Saturday Night Live. This 5-CD set captures the first of its glory years, and boy these sketches ARE glorious! This set has several of the long-form sketches for which SCTV was justly famous--such as Polynesiantown, Play It Again Bob, and the parody of Fantasy Island--but there are also the regular characters that brilliantly skewered all the show-biz phonies rampant in the 1980s. Mrs. Falbo, Count Floyd, Lola Heatherton, Dr. Tongue & Bruno, the McKenzie Brothers, Guy Caballero, Bobby Bittman, the 5 Neat Guys-- what a truly glittering bunch of weaselly little losers they were! The set's extras include an informative booklet and several fascinating backstage interviews with the show's stars, writers, producers and crew. There's also a hilarious panel discussion from the 1999 Aspen Comedy Festival, with Conan O'Brien interviewing several surviving members of the cast. Aside from some rough sound quality on the final disc, this CD set is an impeccable tribute to one of the greatest shows in the entire  history of television.",1094342400,8,1395,5.340909090909091
2024071,3,B0001S6AQE,"I watched SCTV fairly religiously in the United States from 1975 (in syndication) until 1983, which I think is the year NBC pulled the plug.  I never actually saw the additional year of the series, with most of the cast missing and many essential parts filled in by no-name actors, until a couple of years ago.

I'm going to hedge a bet here.  I'm going to hold off purchasing this first DVD volume, based on the first nine episodes of ""SCTV Network 90"" which appeared on NBC to the consistent applause of cultish fans.  These first nine episodes were based on repackagings of sketches which appeared between 1975 and 1979, with SOME new material and a lot of wraparound pieces - if I recall, these episodes graciously minimized the disasterously humorless appearances by Robin Duke and Tony Rosato (interestingly, you'll find them as extras during their 1978 season).

To me, SCTV hit its real stride AFTER these first 90 minute shows, some of which show evidence of having been assembled in a hurry.  It was after this period that the cast truly benefitted from the returns of both Candy and O'Hara, and you began to see them taking full advantage of the 90 minutes with the devastatingly brilliant ""Don Caballero"" episode and the awe-inspiring ""3CP-1"" (or CCCP-1) show.  This stuff was so spot-on, so hysterical, so far above any other sketch comedy of its day that it needs to be both seen and studied.

That's the volume I am waiting for and the one I will unreservedly lavish 5 Stars upon.

This one, while fondly remembered, and while it does have some excellent stuff, is just not the one I'd be willing to shell out the big money for.",1092614400,10,1643,4.657439446366782
2024072,4,B0001S6AQE,"Having moved to Canada when I was ten in 1975, I saw the original SCTV on Global Television. Needless to say, it was a bit over my head when I was 10 or eleven years old. Later, it was reincarted via NBC (from which this volume is taken from). There are a few skits that don't hold up really well, but many of them are hysterical. SCTV was satire at its best, and at times, well exceeded the standard that was established by SNL, although it is a bit like comparing apples and oranges. The set is pricey, but worth it.",1091923200,3,518,4.138613861386139
2024073,5,B0001S6AQE,"The thing about SCTV was that very few people ever seemed to know it ever existed. Then, those that did see it, well, most didn't ""get it."" So to rate this is strange. For us hardcore SCTV viewers back in the late seventies and early 80's. the show was much more important than Saturday Night Live. We SCTV lovers also feel vindicated because of the great subsequent success of its players: John Candy (poor John), Eugene Levy (Oscar caliber on his last film with Christopher Guest), Catherine O'Hara, Andrea Martin (she's the voice on parts of Elmo's World!), Martin Short, and Rick Moranis. For some reason, Dave Thomas and Joe Flaherty haven't broken through on the popular front.

 Best sketches on Volume One:

 1. All the Count Floyds.

 2 Polynesian Town- Johnny LaRue's famous Crane Shot. Incredible.

 3. Andrea Martin as a sex counselor.

 4. Dave Thomas as Bob Hope interrupting Bobby Bittman's Big Telephone bit on the Sammy Maudlin Show.

 5. Bill Needle succumbing to Guy Caballero's pressure.

 Many of these may not be so funny if you didn't see this show back in the day. If you are unfamiliar with SCTV, you might have to subtract up to two stars.",1091404800,5,1165,4.702970297029703
2024074,5,B0001S6AQE,"Whenever I got together with friends discussing television and movies we always wondered why every crummy TV show and movie made it to DVD while SCTV was not yet on DVD. Then we would inevitably begin to reminisce about the show, out favorite sketches, etc. Now we can all watch together because SCTV is finally on DVD . . . well, at least some of it is, and that's a good start.
For those who fondly remember the series I must first state that this is not a collection of the 30-minute shows that were shown in syndication. Rather, this collection contains the first nine shows of SCTV-90 that ran on NBC during the early 80's. Fortunately, the first episode of the collection is a retrospective of some of the best sketches that ran on the syndicated show. Fans will be able to see ""Night School Hi-Q,"" a quiz show where Eugene Levy plays a harassed Alex Trebek to Catherine O'Hara's clueless Margaret Meehan; John Candy as a fully grown Beaver who finally gets revenge in Eddie Haskell; Rick Moranis as Merv Griffin comparing jacket linings with Yasser Arafat and Liberace; and the jewel of the disk, Rick Moranis as Woody Allen playing against Dave Thomas as Bob Hope in ""Play It Again, Bob."" No one ever imitated Bob Hope like Dave Thomas; seeing him on the screen almost makes us believe were really were seeing Bob Hope, that's how good the impersonation was.
And there's more to come with some of the best-loved characters in SCTV: Guy Callabero, Edith Prickley, Bob and Doug McKenzie, Johnny LaRue, Mrs. Falbo, Lola Heatherton, Bobby Bittman, Earl Camembert, Floyd Robertson, aka Count Floyd, Dr. Tongue, Perini Scleroso, Mel Slirrup, and Sammy Maudlin. They're still as funny, and almost as fresh, as when we watched them back then.
Other highlights to look for include the following:
-- John Candy as Civil War coward ""Yellowbelly,"" a spoof on Chuck Connor' series, ""Branded.""
-- Rick Moranis a video deejay Gerry Todd, pre-MTV and eerily prescient.
-- The Sammy Maudlin Show where Bobby Bittman (the unfunniest funny-man in Hollywood) is upstaged by Bob Hope.
-- The Ingmar Bergman film parody that shows up of Count Floyd's ""Monster Chiller Horror Theater."" Floyd is under the impression that it's a horror film. His disappointment when he finds out the truth is as hilarious as the parody itself. ( A bit of SCTV trivia here: Count Floyd, who was SCTV news anchorman Floyd Robertson in a vampire costume and cheesy make-up, is based on Bill Cardille, who Joe Flaherty watched as a kid growing up in Pittsburgh. Cardille did the weather for the local NBC station, and on weekends hosted the studio wrestling matches and as ""Chilly Billy"" hosted the Saturday night horror feature.)
-- Joe Flaherty as station owner Guy Callabero, who, although he can walk, uses a wheel chair. (""I only use it for respect!"")
-- ""The Grapes of Mud,"" a parody of ""The Grapes of Wrath.""
-- ""Mrs. Falbo's Tiny Town."" Andrea Martin at her funniest.
-- Johnny Larue's ""Polynesiantown,"" with its ending crane shot that got LaRue in hot water with Guy Callabero because it went so far over budget.
-- ""The Merv Griffith Show,"" with Rick Moranis as Merv doing the part of Sheriff Taylor. Look for Eugene Levy as a great Floyd the Barber and John Candy as Otis.
-- ""Dr. Tongue's 3-D House of Stewardesses,"" a cheesy send-up of 3-D movies.
-- Catherine O'Hara as Lola Heatherton. Simply hilarious.
That said, the only stumbling block would be the price, which is due to the cost of obtaining the music rights. But it's worth it, and the music's not bad. For instance, the late Roy Orbison, Dr. John, and Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes (fans of Conan O'Brien and the Max Weinberg 7 should watch for LaBamba and Mark Pender in earlier incarnations) are among the performers.
Besides the excellent commentaries on each disk, there is also a 24-page booklet with articles by Conan O'Brien and Ben Stiller, among others. O'Brien says in his piece that in regard to SCTV, ""I don't think anyone's ever topped it."" I agree.",1089331200,106,4006,4.757183908045977
2024075,4,B0001S6AQE,"Just imagine the mess in Melonville when all those fancy plasma TVs come crashing down on the sidewalks. Bet that high-tech stuff blows up real good. It can only mean SCTV is back -- this time, in a hip and hilarious five-DVD time capsule from the early 1980s. The SCTV set is expensive and Shout! still is getting a handle on how to package extras, but this box is essential for anyone who howled along with the Second City gang back in the day. Viewers of a more recent vintage will find the vibe comfortable as well, partly because of the show's influence on today's TV gagsters.
The DVD set's title, ""SCTV Network/90: Volume 1,"" is a head-scratching way of saying these are the first nine shows from the Canadian import's first season on NBC. The episodes ran 90 minutes -- an eternity for the cast, which already had spent several seasons cranking out tight, insanely well-written 30-minute shows for syndication. ""There's a lot of time to fill, we found out,"" SCTV veteran Eugene Levy says as he provides commentary on a numbing ""Great White North"" episode.  Many of the older shows' best bits are repurposed on these DVDs, with NBC-era wraparounds. Most of the favorites are here: Dave Thomas' killer Bob Hope impersonations, Dr. Tongue's 3-D effects, ""Indira,"" ""Mel's Rock Pile,"" 5 Neat Guys, ""The Sammy Maudlin Show"" ... classics all.
The DVD set seems straight out of Melonville in telling the real-life story of SCTV, with half-hour documentaries sort of stuck on each of the discs. The show's history is fairly involved, and viewers may get the feeling they missed something as cast members and producers struggle to remember it all. (A nicely put together tribute booklet helps clarify things.) Levy and Joe Flaherty provide commentary on a couple of episodes, providing the best moments in the DVD extras. Writers and craftsmen have their say, a nice touch. Star writer Harold Ramis is on hand to stroke his chin and offer the big picture.",1089331200,5,1953,4.8125

I would fight the sleep so I could watch it all, since it ended at 1:00 AM. I have always wanted a DVD to bring back those fond memories. Well, this is not it. It is hard for me to say this, because I do think SCTV was the greatest comedy ever and had the greatest talent ever assembled (will ever be assembled). The problem is, that this collection is really before they took off as a really great show. This footage is very raw stuff and dated. Moreover, these were the episodes before the great Martin Short came in. Moranis, Thomas, Candy, etc. were all great, but Short was the greatest. I popped in one of the DVDs of this collection the first night I got the DVD, watched the whole disc and did not laugh once. The person who I had been bragging about this show to said ""that was not funny."" I tried to explain that they were an ""acquired taste."" However, I asked myself, what is going on here, I loved this show, what happend? Well, I still love the show, but the show I loved came after this season of DVDs. So, I guess what I am saying is, that this is the most talented comedic troop ever, right before they really hit their stride. Will I buy the next collection? HECK YES!

2024077,5,B0001S6AQE,"My message to them: KEEP WATCHING! It gets better after a while. I was turned off at first and thought the show hadn't aged well - but once I got ""into"" the humor I found myself laughing hysterically. Most shows will rarely make me laugh when I'm watching alone. SNL sometimes does it when a skit strikes gold (which is getting rarer). Although they're not all hilarious, SCTV Vol. 1 has some downright hilarious skits that had me rolling on the floor in laughter, and often chuckling, BY MYSELF, which is very rare. John Candy's Yellow Belly skit was great. Woody Allen meets Bob Hope? Classic! John Candy's Farm Film Report detailing all the latest foreign films? Hysterical! (""They got blowed up real good!"")
Sure, some of the skits are outdated. Unless you grew up during the '80s you might miss some stuff. But the truth is this has some of the funniest impersonations and sketch ideas you'll ever see in your lifetime. As Conan O'Brien says, ""These very well may be the funniest DVDs you'll ever own. So, enjoy."" I don't quite agree, but they are ONE of the funniest collections you'll get the chance to see.
It's a bit dated but stick with it - after an hour or so it suddenly turns downright hilarious and I can't stop watching it. I never realized how great Rick Moranis was at impersonations...",1089072000,5,1304,4.600858369098712
2024078,3,B0001S6AQE,"I was a huge fan of SCTV. Early in its run it was considered truly cutting edge and featured and produced a long list of talented comic actors. Later, I often wondered why Andrea Martin, an extremely funny lady in the tradition of Lucille Ball, never went on to greater success later in life. She was easily as good, if not better than many of her co-stars. She is one gifted, hysterically funny comedienne.
I've seen the first three in the series and of those three Vol 1 is the best. An earlier reviewer commented that SCTV hadn't aged well. I don't think that's entirely true. I think the problem with this collection is that it's simply not only NOT their best material, most of it is far from their best.
I remember the very early years of SCTV. They had 30 minutes to run a number of skits. The pace was fast. If every sketch wasn't a smash, and who from The Show of Shows through Kovaks can claim that they themselves batted 1000%, the fact was that many if not most of the routines were flat out hilarious.
There are a few of those early bits included in this series. The Taxi Driver send up with Rick Moranis doing Woody Allen as Travis Bickle for example. But most of the stuff is from their NBC days. By then the show had been stretched to 90 minutes, the material softened and dumbed down, the skits way too long and overdone.
I gave the series 3 stars as the musical appearances by the likes of Levon Helm, Dr John and Robert Gordon are all fantastic and boost the rating by a star. There are a few really funny comedic bits. The problem is that those funny bits in this set are way too few and far between.",1088812800,7,1620,4.280130293159609

I was eager to buy this box and bought it as soon as it was available. Unfortunately, I just didn't find myself laughing much. Aside from some concepts not being as funny as I remembered, it seems a lot of the material had references current to its time. My wife is 5 years younger than me and needed a lot of pop culture, current event references, and bits of satire explained. And as the saying goes, if you have to explain a joke, it's not funny. In fairness though, the actors themselves are all great and are very likable. I found myself rooting for them to be more funny!",1088726400,7,874,4.434782608695652

2024081,3,B0001S6AQE,"I was really looking forward to this Boxed DVD set. I have to admit I was disappointed. There was not enough Sammy Maudlin, Count Floyd, Lola Heatherton, Bobby Bitman, Johnny LaRue, William B., Schmeinge Brothers, Dr. Tounge, and well I could go on & on. My favorite skit is probably when Hollywood actors read Bible Verses. Kirk Douglas (Joe Flaherty) reading ""The Lord Is My Shephard"" is about the funniest bit I've ever seen on TV. Of course it wasn't in the set. Too much time was spent on talking about what a great time they had instead of the cast showing what a great time they had. The tribute to John Candy was awful. Show us the skits he was in which we remember him by. And as much as I like ""Freaks & Geeks"", the clip of that just to try to get you to buy that set was bogus. By the way, if I see one more bit with Dave Thomas as Bill Needle, I'll scream. Even though I was disappointed in this set, I'm sure I'll buy the 2nd one when it comes out. I only hope they'll do away with the tributes and small talk and show good SCTV bits. Here's hoping Kirk Douglas shows up.",1088553600,7,1084,4.14218009478673
2024082,5,B0001S6AQE,"If you are unfamiliar with SCTV, that is simply something that must be remedied quickly.  This is the set to do just that.  After years of watching my old homemade VHS tapes of this show slowly deteriorate from too many viewings, finally they release this classic comedy on DVD.
However, the format is not how I remember it as I used to watch the half hour shows in reruns late at night as opposed to the 90 minute NBC shows depicted here, but many of the same bits are here.  Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas do some dead on ringers of Woody Allen and Bob Hope.  I think Rick does Woody better than Woody does, if that is possible. Who can forget the ""Great White North""?  There are simply some unforgettable moments of the kind of satire that makes the Simpson's so funny.  The late great John Candy in some bits he later reprised in various films (""Splash"", for example) playing Johnny LaRue, with his exercise show with famous line ""better take it easy, my heart is beating like a rabbit"".  For those too young to remember Don Kirshner's Rock Concert, the comedy satire of ""Mel's Rock Pile"" may not make sense, but for those who do it is too funny for words.
The show was a parody of television, with ""SCTV"" representing a TV channel (likely modeled after 1970's ABC).  The commercials, the ""sweeps week"", the late night programming, and the behind the scenes productions, and more, are all just a wonderfully written satire of what was the unbelievable spectacle of 1970's network television.
The only downer is that this set does not include the inclusion of Martin Short, who created some memorable characters such as Ed Grimly, and who participated in some of the best sketches they did.  Also missing are dozens of classics which were not part of the NBC 90 minute show.  That said we can always hope those are released in DVD quality as well.  Considering how many films these actors went on to be in, they represent the same kind of talent development that made SNL famous.  I would call this SNL combined with Monty Python, classic sketch comedy, but more satire than antics.
Highly recommended.  It is great to see John Candy, Rick Moranis, Eugene Levy, and others so familiar to comedy films in the last two decades, and how they all got their start.  Thanks for finally releasing these, now get busy with the second set!",1088208000,5,2331,4.599033816425121
2024083,4,B0001S6AQE,"It's great to see SCTV again after waiting so long, and there are some great bits here. My particular favorite is Rick Moranis on the Gerry Todd show and as crooner Tom Monroe.  I could watch that 80 times in a row and not tire of it. And David Brinkley's commentary (Moranis again) on the high cost and low quality of heroin is priceless.
That said, I feel a little disappointed. This first season is good, but doesn't have some of the really great stuff, such as The Days of The Week, the Schmenges, Moe Green, the Halfwits; and yes, the stuff is dated and everybody looks really young -- which is a big surprise because I really haven't aged at all, although many of my friends have, the poor dears.
So yes, this is a great start, and anybody who wants to support the effort to see more SCTV released should buy this set, and write to the producers to demand more.",1088208000,8,867,4.319018404907975

John Candy is a genius, as we know, but so are Moranis, Thomas, Flaherty, and Martin.  Catherine O'Hara is wonderful in every role she played and it is quite easy to understand her later success in light of what she did on this program.  I can say this about few purchases but it was worth every bit of the 63 bucks I paid for it.  All 5 DVDs are notable and you'll be transported back to the 80's while you view, which for me, is an end in itself.  I'll be putting this in again and again.",1087776000,4,583,4.034782608695652
2024085,2,B0001S6AQE,"I watched SCTV faithfully as a kid in the late 1970s and enjoyed the comedy of Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty, Andrea Martin, Rick Moranis, Cathy O'Hara, Dave Thomas and, of course, the late, great John Candy.  I was 16 or so at the time and always enjoyed it over Saturday Night Live.  So when I heard about the SCTV 5-disc set issuance, I decided to rent two of the discs to revisit this old friend in hopes of being thrilled enough to buy the set.
Alas, I'm not buying the set.  I'm sure aging almost 25 years has a lot to do with it, but I didn't laugh much at the four 90 minute episodes I watched on the two discs.  I can't figure out if I changed that dramatically in my humor tastes or the show just wasn't that funny to begin with.  I have to admit that I'm disappointed because I hadn't seen the show in any form in years and was really looking forward to it.
It was great to see Candy and Levy perform in particular (Candy's Johnny LaRue and Levy's Earl Camembert were the classic SCTV characters), the two cast members who made it big in movies after the SCTV run ended.  But the material they worked with just doesn't cut it 25 years later.
So, if you loved this show in its day, my suggestion is to rent one of the 5 discs at your local DVD place, watch it from start to finish and decide if the set is for you.  I'm glad I did, as the set is pretty expensive.",1087776000,10,1369,4.085820895522388

I have taken one star away from my rating for only one reason, to encourage the producers of the DVD to give us more chapter stops for each episode, preferably one for each individual sketch or parody.  I would imagine that is one of the main reasons that many people will buy the DVDs, in order to see their favorite bits, sometimes over and over.  As it is, all you get is a very general summary in the DVD booklet of the major sketches in each episode and three or four chapter stops per 90 minute episodes, which are not tied to anything so far as I can see.

The first nine episodes of the 90 minute show that aired at 12:30 on Friday nights are included here and the stuff is largely unaffected by the passage of time.  To think the show was cancelled so that they could put on Friday night music videos...oh well, at least they've been digitized.  If you've never seen the show, and you like to laugh...order this volume, you won't regret it.  It's one of the most underrated comedy shows ever made.

2024089,5,B0001S6AQE,"Finally, at long last it is here and to prove once and for all how lame SNL really is.
This is classic character-driven sketch comedy at it's best and if you do not think any of the material that is spread across these 5 DVDS is remotely funny you must be dead. Yes, some of the material seems dated but so does South Park from its first 3 seasons. Comedy involves making fun of things around you and even though some things seem dated some things still hold true like the ""Moral Majority"" episode. And how can you not laugh at the 5 Neat Guys. If you remember the old 30-minute shows from your local UHF channel, some of that material is spread across most of these discs along with the innovative wrap-around pieces tying the whole thing together. I think mostly 98% of what you remember is here. Some things were edited when the old 30-minute shows were incorporated into the NBC produced shows in 1981 as well as some music beds due to licensing issues (one of the major things that was holding up SCTV from coming to DVD) You can go to [...] which can give you all of the episodes produced and the things that were changed through syndication
 So now you can return to Mr's Falbo's Tiny Town, see Crazy Hy's commercials through out the Jerry Todd Show, marvel at the magnificent crane-shot at the end of ""Polynesiantown"" and the fall out from it, and the lengths Guy Cabellero will go to keep SCTV from going into the red.

2024092,5,B0001S6AQE,"When SCTV was originally done on TV in the mid-70's it was intended as a cheap ""Canadian content"" filler program on the rather inaccurately named Global TV Network. The network was actually at that time broadcast only in Ontario, Canada. Those first two seasons were done on the incredibly cheap, but with extraordinary results. They were the seasons when Harold Ramis appeared on screen, but before Rick Moranis joined. Many of the satires were of Canadian TV and celebrities. ""Floyd Robertson"" and ""Earl Camenbert"" were parodies of newscasters Lloyd Robertson and Earl Cameron. Lloyd still hosts the most-watched national newscast in Canada. ""Halfwits"" was a parody of a Toronto High school quiz (hosted by Alex trebec in pre-Jeopardy days!) called ""Reach For The Top"".
After 2 years, Global dropped the show, but it was picked up a year later by another (& bigger) Canadian network - the CBC. But by this time several of the bigger names, particularly John Candy & Catherine O'Hara, had gone on to other things, so the cast was supplemented by Moranis, Tony Rosato & Robin Duke. Rosato & Duke moved to SNL at about the same time NBC started showing ""SCTV90"" on Fridays at 1 am. The McKenzie Brothers skits, originally just filler material to fulfill the CBC's demand that the show be ""more Canadian"", were, remarkably among the most popular skits.
By the time SCTV moved to NBC, the budgets got larger, and the original cast, including Candy & O'Hara, were reunited.
Because so much of the original Second City ran below the radar, they were able to get away with a lot of things. Not censorship problems - copyright problems. They just never bothered to get clearance for a lot of the tunes they played or performed on the show. Sir John Gilguid & Sir Ralph Richardson appeared without salary or residuals. That's why the NBC shows are coming out before the originals.",1087171200,17,1872,4.853125
2024093,5,B0001S6AQE,"With the exception of a handful of worn videotapes I still have in my video collection containing some episodes I had taped off TV over 20 years ago, I've had to rely on my memory. The fact that my memory has held up with vivid clarity after all these years is a testament to just how unforgettable this show is.
Conan O'Brien makes a poignant statement during the '99 reunion special contained in the set. SCTV was ""his"" show in the sense that, while the entire country was watching SNL and it's cast members were getting famous, SCTV was a little show of cult status that had no production values, no proper exposure, and no corporate idiots telling them what they could and couldn't do, not to mention horrible time slots. In other words, if you wanted to watch it, you had to look for it, or stay up past 1:30am. With SCTV, you felt like only you and a handful of friends were hip enough to recognize the true genius comedy show on TV. Perhaps it was SCTV's lack of exposure and budget that enabled the stellar cast to develop their ideas and hone them, playing to themselves and their own amusement rather than any particular Nielsen rating statistics. Even back then some of their references were a little esoteric, making it all the more funny if you ""got"" it. (i.e. comedian Jack Carter endorsing the Mr. Boom microphone. Show me one person under the age of 35 that would get this today). Whatever the case may be, SCTV managed to escape the grasp and restrictions of corporate involvement (for the most part, though NBC's revamped intros to each season got increasingly cheesier), and as result was able to keep up a consistently high level of quality (until they went to Cinemax in their final season).
This set only scratches the surface, as it represents the first 90-minute episodes made after they were picked up by NBC. Luckily, these episodes were interspersed with both older skits and newer material, so those of us hoping for the early first few seasons to be released at least have a few classic snippets
contained herein such as Grapes of Mudd (with Harold Ramis)and  Shock Theater. This also means that these episodes predate Martin Short's involvement (though he does appear on the extras material), which is personally fine by me because I never particularly cared for Short's work with SCTV. IMO, Rick Moranis was the best ""newcomer"" to the cast, as he seemlessly blended in with the rest of the cast and didn't appear to upstage any of them. Short's style, on the other hand, always seemed too ""polished"" and incongruous to me in relation to the rest of them, though I will say that I enjoy his work more now than than I did when he first joined the cast.
There are far too many classic bits here to mention, and if there's any criticism of this set it's that it leaves you craving more (I've heard a 2nd volume will come out on October). Here's some of my favorites bits you might have forgotten about(some of which are not on this particular set):
1. Moe Green's Dialing for Dollars: cheapskate Moe Green (Harold Ramis) hurriedly hanging up the phone when someone calls in to guess the correct film title.
2. Edith Prickley live at the Mellonville Baths - Q: what night at the baths would be complete without a dramatic reading of the letters of Alezander Hamilton by Charleton Heston?
3. Indira the musical with Indira Ghandi and Slim Whitman: sung to the tunes of Evita.
4. The Merv Griffith Show: ""we'll be right back""
5. Mel's Rock pile with Richard Harris
6. Monster Chiller Horror Theater's, ""Ingmar Bergman's Whispers of the Wolf"" (""un shrimpka"")
7. Julia Child and Deforest Kelly cooking show (""Needs more cimminon!"")
8. Dimaggio's on the Wharf: Joltin' Joe (Bill Murray guest star)
is plugging his new restaurant by challenging patrons to try to strike him out for a free meal. He's whacking line drives in the middle of a crowded restaurant. Patrons are given batting helmets to wear.
9. Dr. Tong's 3D House of Slave Chicks in Smell-O-Rama: says it all

2024094,5,B0001S6AQE,"Wonderful! It's absolutely great that something with SCTV has finally been released, other than the John Candy Tribute, which is excellent itself. I recommend SCTV Network Vol 1 to anyway who enjoys blowing a few valves of continuous laughter. But I must say that the episodes prior to SCTV's promotion to NBC in 1981 should also be considered for re-issue. Many a time I went to bed late at night with my sides hurting after viewing many of these earlier versions, which came out during the late 1970's, featuring off-beat comic genius Harold Ramis (Ghost Busters) who actually appears in the skits. He spoofs the call-in contest perfectly in Dialing For Dollars, or as Old Muley starving in the 1930's dustbowl, or that guy with the exaggerated long legs! If my memory serves me correctly, these earlier episodes seemed to have a more spontaneous, and more of a slapstick approach than the later ones with NBC, thus translating into more honest gut-bursting laughter. Maybe Ramis had something to do with that. If this 5 disc DVD set is successful in sales, I hope the producers will consider compiling many of the earlier Rhodes Productions versions. Hopefully, SCTV Network Vol 1 is just the first installment in what will be a more comprehensive collection of this hilarious and very original television comedy show.",1087171200,6,1321,4.954954954954955
2024095,5,B0001S6AQE,"After I watched the entire set over my last weekend off, my first impression was how much I actually remembered from growing up watching this show in my teenage years--also, surprisingly for a show that was considered more of a critic's darling than a ratings giant like Saturday Night Live there were a surprising amount of catch-phrases, such as ""Blowed 'em up real good!"", ""How are ya!"", ""How's it going, eh?"", ""I want to bear all your children"", ad infinitum. (I really don't understand the previous reviewers that keep comparing the two using simular sketches as examples--the SCTV cast keep hammering home in the various DVD documentaries that each SNL show had to be conceived and rehearsed in a week and the timing of the material had to take a live audience's reactions into consideration, whereas SCTV was a continuing process, a sketch was ready...well, when it was ready and there was no live audience)
I have to be fair, although I rate this set 5 stars, this is more my rating than an objective one, as I am middle-aged and I would get more of the dated references/premises than probably someone half my age would (i.e.: celebrities spoofed includes Slim Whitman, Joyce DeWitt, Brenda Vaccaro, games shows spoofed includes ""What's My Line?"", ""The GE College Bowl"", etc.), but as Conan O'Brien in the 1999 reunion pointed out, the overall concept is the star and is the main reason to watch, which is a typical day in the life of a small-town/""anywhere"" television station (it could be Canada or the US, although most of the cast was Canadian and the series was made in Canada) barely able to stay solvent with it's own low-budget programming and it's ""celebrities"" (under-paid, over-ego'd ""big fish in a small pond"", like Guy Caballero and Sammy Maudlin and the rest of his Melonville ""Rat Pack"").
Bottom line: even though there were the catch-phrases, they were the pepper in the big comedy soup of SCTV, you watch for the characterizations and the big picture--every episode started with some sort of crisis to the SCTV station and how it affected the station throughout it's broadcasting day--whereas SNL was and is always for the hit-and-run skit and the quick laugh as well as the belief of comfort in the familiar.
The skits that stand out for me are: ""Pledge Week"" and ""Bouncin' Back with Lola Heatherton"" (both more wrap-around devices rather than skits), ""Monster Chiller Horror Theater"" (one with what Count Floyd thinks is a ""werewolf"" movie and the other a ""3-D classic"": ""Dr. Tongue's House of Stewardesses""), ""The Pope Who Would Be King"", ""Mel's Rockpile"" (two of these, one with Roy Orbison and the other with ""Richard Harris""), and ""The Great White North"" (at least 5 of these skits, there is one that turns into a wrap-around);
The skits I missed I hope are on future releases (and not on the earlier seasons that were not in the 90 minute format): Orson Wells and Merv Griffin vs. HAL9000, ""Buggery on the High Seas"", ""A Friendly Reminder from the Church of Satan"", ""Bob and Doug McKenzie's topic: Star Wars"" (I might not be too clear on these titles, they're from my own recollections, but fans will know what I'm referring to, I'm sure) and a sci-fi version of ""Route 66"" with John Candy in a role eerily prescient of ""Spaceballs"";
Other: I thought the overall audio and video quality was excellent for a late-'70's/early '80's TV show--the only audio problem I noticed was a few seconds of drop-out in the first five minutes of disc 5--the shows as previously mentioned by another reviewer are only a little over an hour long and there is a 20-30 minute supplement on each disc, in my opinion the 1st disc general rememberances being the best and the ""Making of"" (or ""Art of"") being the worst--I was disappointed with the reunion as was not that funny and the video quality was awful for a HBO special (also no one obviously asked either castmembers Robin Duke or Tony Rosato to attend although Martin Short was there, Rick Moranis was ""sick"" and John Candy was not even mentioned by ANYONE!)--and the enclosed booklet is garishly-colored and designed, making it hard to read as well as being sparse for info and tributes, the Dan Ackroyd one being surprisingly indifferent;
For a North American show that was the answering attack to the opening salvo of Monty Python in the revolutionary comedy wars, this is a wonderful and pivotal moment in late-20th century entertainment history that deserves to be documented and remembered, no matter how high the cost--I highly recommend it for any student of comedy and even moreso for those of us still young enough to remember how great and subversive 70's and early '80's television actually was contrary to the opinions of the culturally predjudiced and ill-informed.",1087084800,5,4748,4.848522167487685
2024096,5,B0001S6AQE,"You might think me biased, because I was heavily into the show (and these particular shows) when I was young, and I have studied them in the intervening years, and have the episodes pretty well memorized.
But, unlike other things that once amused me that now seem flatter and duller - this show remains astonishing.  Just to see the jokes laid out with somewhat more visual clarity sometimes brings tears to my eyes.
The writing is fine to excellent, very great comedy writing ala the best of ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""Mr. Show"".  The clever format, great makeup and sets, and sharp writing make this a great show.  What makes SCTV truly astonishing is the power of the cast.  Never have 7 people this funny worked together as a team, like this.  My god these people were awesome.  Dave Thomas, Joe Flaherty, and Eugene Levy were comedy geniuses.  Catherine O'Hara was such a powerhouse, such a force of nature, that it isn't even funny (to steal a phrase).  These people all worked later but all did their best work here by a mile.
The shows look good and the extras are put together well. The commentaries and mini-documentaries leave you, to paraphrase Lola Heatherton, hurting for more.  This cycle of shows and the one after this are SCTV's peak, and a peak for sketch comedy.
For many years other shows, most notably Saturday Night Live, stole jokes from SCTV.  (Want examples?  Compare the recent Christopher Walken ""Pranksters"" sketch with the funnier ""Revenge!"" sketch from a later SCTV show.  Compare the Celebrity Jeapordy sketches to the ""Halfwits"" game show from a later SCTV show.  They've been stealing jokes for 15 years now.)

Oh well, there is no failure here, this is priceless comedy, and the fact that it's out has made me giddy as a schoolgirl.  Enjoy!",1086652800,2,755,4.7615384615384615
2024104,5,B0001S6AQE,"A good day indeed!  Who could ever forget Count Floyd hosting Monster Chiller Horror Theater screening such epics as Dr. Tongues 3D House of Pancakes (Would you like some syrup!)and Dr. Tongues 3D House of Stewardesses.
Other Great Sketches;
The Godfather: SCTV trys to eliminate the four families (ABC, CBS, NBC & PBS)
Polynesian Town: Johnny LaRue begging for his crane shot.
Fantasy Island: John Candy as Tatoo is a classic, especially when he gets amorous with a stratavarius violin!
The Guy who sells used fruit (Eugene Levy)
The Porno store guy with the snake on his face (John Candy)
Indira; The musical: (Andrea Martin)
The Days of the Week: You'll be hard-pressed to find two more stupid characters than Rocko & Mojo.
...And last but not least, Great White North.  SCTV's answer to the stupid ""Canadian Content"" rule that was imposed upon them.  Out of their protest came the two most memorable characters of the 1980's!  Coo Luk-u-coo-coo-coo-luk-u-coo!
RELEASE All OF SEASONS/CYCLES ASAP!!  I WANT MY SCTV!",1086480000,47,1017,5.029761904761905
2024105,5,B0001S6AQE,"I don't know if I spelled her name correctly,but the character Andrea Martin played..the one who was attempting to learn english in several episodes,has got to rate as the funniest character ever on TV.I have no idea how the cast got through them without choking to death laughing. Catherine O'Hara as her instructor is wonderful,too. All of the members of SCTV are incredibly funny,witty and talented,and I am so glad some of the episodes are out on DVD.BUT WE WANT THEM ALL!!!
One more thing: If you only know John Candy from his movies,which were wonderful,you really should check him out as the various characters he brought to life on SCTV.His talent was monumental,and he is sadly missed.",1086393600,7,694,4.889830508474576
2024106,5,B0001S6AQE,"This collection of genius comedy is an absolute must for the collection. Unlike SNL, the vast majority of the skits are comedic brilliance. I have been waiting twenty years to throw away my old scratchy VHS recordings of this unique show.
Thanks!",1086393600,5,246,4.880952380952381
2024107,5,B0001S6AQE,It is surely a sign that the end of the world MUST be looming now that these are FINALLY being released!!!  I had just about given up hope. Let us all hope that the assured success of this first installment will result in the rest of the episodes being released in a timely manner.  WE HAVE WAITED LONG ENOUGH ALREADY SO DO NOT TEASE US!!  Now if only someone would get off their similarly lazy asses at Paramount(i think) and get DUCKMAN released.  Probably have to wait for hell to freeze over but now there is at least something to watch in the interim.,1086220800,3,556,4.3173076923076925
2024108,4,B0001S6AQE,"I didn't realize there were that many commercials back then but be aware that the episodes are 66 minutes each and not 90 minutes. It's still the full version but I am annoyed at the marketing habit of rounding to the ""with commercials"" timing. Also included is the live 1989 reunion interview of the SCTV gang by Conan O'Brien (65 minutes) and a series of funny interviews with the gang 20-year after (about 30 minutes). Still, a very funny set.",1086134400,10,446,4.5875
2024109,5,B0001S6AQE,"...truly, I in pain from watching this. Sick-makingly funny. I'd never watch this SCTV dvd with a date as I turn into a mass of un-macho giggles with every viewing. Take my word, this is a date breaker.",1085788800,4,202,4.342105263157895
2024110,5,B0001S6AQE,"SCTV was by far the best comedy show ever. John Candy was awesome as Orson Wells, Johnny Larue and all the Zany characters he played. The SCTV Xmas party was one of the best episodes ever. I loved Jerry Todd, Skip Bittman, Bobby's little brother....all the memories are coming back. The show was a classic. I hated those chopped up episodes they used to show...what a disgrace that was. Thank you to whoever got off their ass and finally released SCTV on DVD. djdan",1085443200,5,465,4.5476190476190474
2024111,5,B0001S6AQE,"It is still my favourite show.  Even after years of not watching it I can still remember Vic Arpeggio in Black Like Me, Rocco (don't you mean Billy....Billy McKay!), Sid Dithers (San Francisco? How did you come, you drove or did you flew?), Artisans and their Art (We can get you Hookers!  That's not bad!), Guy Caballero's singing of Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child, Charlton Heston laying stomach down on the pavement looking up at the Towering Inferno (he thinks of the solution while at Burger King),  Earl Camembert with a toothache - Floyd making him laugh and Earl giggling in between moans of pain, I have an impacted wisdom tooth! he cries, Guy Caballero being caught passing bad cheques - the chairman of the board, Crazy Legs, punishes him.  I've never been a big SNL fan, SCTV was my choice.  I'll definitely be buying this DVD and any others that come out later.  As Nostradamus would say ""I knew this DVD would come out.""",1085184000,,944,4.622754491017964
2024112,5,B0001S6AQE,"I never could have dreamt that in these troubled times, the most longstanding and enduring prayer of my life would be answered.  A proper release of these 90 minute shows is the only thing I have ever wanted more than world peace.  If that sounds insensitive, please account for the fact that I was only 13 when I began to pray.  When our Betamax began to fail, my collection of homemade tapes was injured; and when it died completely, my access was lost.  Watching these masterpieces chopped into senseless 23 minute syndicated bits has provided some of the saddest moments of my life; just imagine if The White Album were cut down to a single disk (sorry, George--we disagree).  The only thing better would have been if the original Chic jeans commercials (the REAL commercials) could have been restored for this release, but naturally that would have been too much to ask.  As long as they kept the musical guests.  And concerning the price: $63.00 is a PITTANCE for the only gift greater (to the 13-year-old in me) than world peace.  Now just pray that they please FINISH THE JOB and release the rest of the Network 90 seasons!!!  (I probably shouldn't say this (shh!), but I will pay ANY price.  Next stop: Cinemax?)",1085097600,10,1221,4.663551401869159
2024113,5,B0001S6AQE,"I have been waiting for literally YEARS for a SCTV box set.  Finally, finally, finally my prayers have been answered!  In its prime, this show made its period peers (""SNL"" and ""Fridays"") seem like lame high school talent night productions!  Even today, just thinking about the Julia Child/Mr. Rogers boxing match on ""Battle of the PBS Stars"", or 'Gavin MacLeod's' tribute to Bonnie Franklin, or Jake the Guy With The Snake On His Face, or ""Dr. Tongue's 3-D House of Stewardesses"", never fails to make me laugh!
