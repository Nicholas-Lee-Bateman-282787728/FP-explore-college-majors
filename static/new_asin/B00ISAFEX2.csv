8644967,5,B00ISAFEX2,"You can't waffle about the cinematic meta-art of Todd Jason Falcon Cook. Either you dismiss it for the horribly inept, meandering, plotless, pointless, clueless tripe it is - or you come to appreciate the blurred vision of a young Texas man with a camcorder and a dream. I am in the second camp - and own every single one of his classics since first getting turned on to ""Death Metal Zombies"" years ago. Dear readers, this is the pinnacle of TJFC's artistic arc. So, so, so bad. To even make it through one of the three vignettes that comprise this horror trilogy is a testament to your stick-to-it-iveness. Because this is really just like being butt-called on FaceTime - nothing happens for endless sprawls of time - then something does but you're not sure what and then we're back on cinematic hold. Two sock puppets reading a PF Chang's menu off camera while the lens remains affixed on a light switch would be Goodfellas by comparison. It's that bad. No, it's worse. And it's awesome. And I'm going to watch it again tonight, even though I just watched it two days ago. I'm a glutton for the D-minus horror homebrews of the world and this never disappoints.",1432684800,,1162,4.618357487922705
