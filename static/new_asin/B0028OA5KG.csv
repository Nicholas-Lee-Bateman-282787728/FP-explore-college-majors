This is four disk series produced and directed by John Foley between 1988 and 1990. The series I purchased was from TGG Direct through Publisher's Clearing House for $27.95

This is different from the other war series I've purchased. Each disk gives an very good historical account of the actual battles with excellent tactical maps anyone can understand. The second part of the disk is the re-enactment phase of the battles by those men and women who have dedicated themselves to preserve historical accuracy. The third part of the of each disk is a full length feature film.

5 stars for the historical accounts. Being a bit naive on the topic, Mr. Foley provides an excellent narrative for each battle and the tactics used by both Northern and Southern armies. At times you will wonder how the Union Forces actual won the war as Mr. Foley points out the continued flaws and poor leadership of their forces.

4 star for the reenactments. They were well done and provided a good insight as to how the forces were arranged and moved into battle.

Movies 3 stars. The four films are Drums in the Deep South, Kansas Pacific, Hellbenders and Santa Fe Trail. The first two are not a must see-1 star, The third is okay 2-stars. The fourth is a real Hollywood production Errol Flynn, Ronald Reagan, Van Heflen and a host of others. This one was worth watching. 4 stars

Overall, I enjoyed the series and will use it as a reference as I gain more knowledge on the bloodiest conflict in American History. I always wondered what the cost in lives was-over 600,000 dead and millions wounded in just four short years. I hope we've learned our lesson especially with the current political upheavals.

I believe $27.95 was a bit much for this product. $15-20.00 would be more appropriate.",1346198400,4,1803,4.722929936305732
