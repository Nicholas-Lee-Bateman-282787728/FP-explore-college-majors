8744838,2,B019D3J3WA,"A group of Russians are on a shopping spree to neighboring Finland for quality products. The bus ride lasted all night, and don't worry you aren't spared a moment. Stas is an irritating teen boy who knows and films everything with a shaky cell phone camera. All the pictures are shaky. He does not get along well with his mom and the two have been at odds the whole trip. Dad passed away a month ago.

The shoppers detour to a new store, designed just for the. Once in, the store is locked and the Finns start to kill and eat them. Mom and son must now team together.

Normally cannibalism in a story such as this symbolizes economics. Clearly the Finns are feasting off of tourist, bloating themselves off of Russians wanting quality products. The shortness of the film, the lousy camera work, and the irritating characters made for a bad film.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1451001600,,879,4.515723270440252
