2590841,4,B000FUTVUA,"This movie is wonderful. Not just because I love Kim Delaney, but because the story could happen. It is a movie that makes you stop and think, what if this really could take place.",1171238400,2,180,4.323529411764706
2590842,3,B000FUTVUA,"It's all about special effects.  Some of which were spectacular,  the crevasse snaking across the midwest being one.  Also glad the ""Woodstock"" film effect was dropped in this edition,  an improvement over 10.5 in my estimation.  Meaningful character development and storylines?  Not here.  However,  it is pure entertainment for a couple of hours.  So hunker down with your popcorn and get set for some big screen thrills.",1169164800,,423,5.1940298507462686
2590843,4,B000FUTVUA,I feel this movie was better than the first in the series.  Very good special effects and excellent cast.,1168473600,,105,4.526315789473684
2590844,2,B000FUTVUA,"Under no circumstances ever use Amazon U.K. they are not the same company as Amazon U.S.  Amazon U.K. customer service is terrible, they double shipped an item to me and gave me the run around tyring to return it.  Their customer service can barely understand English and they never followed through on any request I forwarded, or answered any complaints.  Amazon U.K. simply does not care if your unhappy with a product, received two or three in the same order etc. Tough, they don't care",1168300800,6,489,4.729411764705882
2590845,3,B000FUTVUA,"You have to suspend disbelief to some degree to enjoy any disaster movie, but the follow up to 10.5 requires a bit more than I'm comfortable with. The action was decent and the acting was alright, but there were some fundamental flaws in the premise and conclusion that were really hard to swallow. There were a few subplots going on that really didn't enhance the story for me, but they were worth enduring to get to the next action sequence. If you enjoyed 10.5 as I did, then you'll probably enjoy seeing what happens to our heroes next.",1168300800,9,540,4.520408163265306
2590846,3,B000FUTVUA,"Not the best disaster flick I've ever seen but not the worst either.  Some sections are slow others boring or to long but if you want a clean movie to while a way a lazy day, watch this one.",1166918400,3,190,3.871794871794872
2590847,3,B000FUTVUA,"10.5 apocalypes is a disaster film about quakes. Essentially, a big quake reverses the continental drift and causes a huge gulf to form in the central USA. The first part of this film was pretty good. You see the aftershocks take down Mount Rushmore, several cities and cause massive computerized destruction.

The problem I had with the film is the blandness of the characters. Some were even unlikeable. The friction beween Brad (Dean Cain's Character), his little brother and his wife was just painful. They act like teenagers. Who couldn't predict what happened to Brad? I didn't honestly like any of them, didn't care whether they lived or died, and had no interest in their soapy melodramas.

The response from FEMA given their field record in real life was a bit comic.  The disasters, however were great, and well worth watching, although the story lagged in the second part with the rescue in the casino.

3 stars. Would've been vastly improved by likeable characters.",1163462400,5,977,4.939024390243903
2590848,5,B000FUTVUA,"I REALLY liked this movie with the special effects and most especially because it was a sequel to the movie 10.5, which was EXCELLENT.  The same main characters were brought back, which really made this movie great. I love castrophe movies and special effects and these two movies are two of my favorites.  I have watched them MANY times, and always pick up things that I missed the first few times. I even rewatched them again this week.

I would recommend this for content, actors, sequence settings, and special effects with a different twist on an earthquake episode.",1162425600,4,571,4.8061224489795915
2590849,4,B000FUTVUA,"This sequel to 10.5 is a disaster freak's dream come true.  We get destruction of Hoover Dam; Las Vegas sinks into the sand; Mount Rushmore crumbles, and Houston is dessimated.

While probably not geologically accurate, I found the movie pretty much enjoyable except for the too lengthy rescue sequence in Las Vegas, but the first half and the final third are pretty involving.  There are no super star performances, but you get adequate ones from Kim Delaney, Frank Langella, Dean Cain, Oliver Hudson, Beau Bridges and Carlos Bernard.  The CGI effects are pretty decent and although some of it is reminiscent of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, there have been a lot more disastrous disaster films, so if you're a genre fan, you shouldn't be too disappointed.",1158710400,44,751,4.984
2590880,2,B000FUTVUA,"If a reasonably talented group of high school kids got together to make a movie with only equipment they could scrounge and a very low budget they might produce something like this.  While the premise was slightly interesting, if mostly unbelievable, the backdrorps and special effects would have made movie-goers cringe even back in the 70's.  Some of the acting is barely acceptable, most of it is worse and the dialog is often laughable.  If you just want some mindless babble on the TV on a Saturday afternoon this might suit but if you're looking for a good settle down and watch a movie flick you're probably going to throw this out your window after the first 45 minutes or so.  I gave it two stars because, hey, at least they tried.",1524873600,,740,4.583333333333333
2590881,1,B000FUTVUA,"I laughed SO much I had tears running down my face!! I applaud the strength of the actors, it must have taken a boatload of will power (or mind-altering medications) to stay 'in character' while uttering totally ridiculous dialogue. I don't think I'd react quite so calmly while watching the obliteration of the U.S. landscape...or would I?",1524873600,,340,4.982456140350878
2590882,1,B000FUTVUA,"After a while it's like a soap opera with all this drama, usually from the women.  I would expect the characters to act professional but they don't.  It's all Hollywood drama.  I can't watch anymore.",1524700800,,199,4.628571428571429
2590883,1,B000FUTVUA,"Great idea for a story but I think the camera man was a young teenager that just learned how to zoom in and out for the first time.
The camera work killed it for me. To bad.",1524700800,,173,3.7027027027027026
2590884,2,B000FUTVUA,"Who doesn't enjoy a good natural disaster movie?  I tried to overlook the bad acting and low budget directing, but I just couldn't do it any longer.  I'm shocked Beau Bridges agreed to be in such a movie.  Do yourself a favor and make another selection.",1524355200,,253,4.456521739130435
2590885,1,B000FUTVUA,"The best part about this series was watching all the national landmarks get destroyed. That's why I gave it one star. Other than that the writing was formulaic, uninspiring, and boring. The directing even worse than the writing and bless those actors for trying, but you can only do so much with a crappy script. Just fast forward to all the good parts with the CGI destruction sequences.",1524268800,,388,4.720588235294118
2590886,4,B000FUTVUA,"Don't be fooled by Amazon only having a single season. This is essentially a three part mini-series. I suppose it could have broken out to additional series, but it is intended to stand on its own.

It is a disaster movie and what comes with disaster movies is an accelerated timeline, never ending climatic moments, playing loose with reality and the like. But this is not a documentary, it is a movie intended to entertain and from my perspective it was entertaining. You can nit-pick the acting and cinematography but you would be hard pressed not to find the same type criticisms with any disaster film.",1524268800,,607,4.726415094339623

2590889,3,B000FUTVUA,"I really want to like this.  But, after the 1st episode I have a headache from the constant bouncing camera work.  I  know its a technique to make it feel more real but it still bothers me.  Do we really need fake shadows passing in front of the actors?",1523750400,,253,4.1020408163265305
2590890,2,B000FUTVUA,I saw a lot of actors I recognize. Sadly I agree with another review the zoom in and out is horrid totally kills the viewing process. Have no idea whose bright idea that was but they had to know it would irritate the viewer. Good story line and I would have given 5 star if the zoom in and out  was not there.,1523750400,,309,3.9047619047619047
2590891,2,B000FUTVUA,"Didn't like this movie all that much. Watched the first two but didn't care to finish it. Typical apocalypse movie that seems to follow the same Hollywood formula as most others. Didn't really find anything unique about the characters and didn't really get attached either. Some of the visual effects are decent, acting is mostly okay, but the story line gets boring. Next!",1523664000,,373,4.936507936507937
2590892,1,B000FUTVUA,"Why offer a series that has either one season and one episode or one season and 2-3 episodes.  Two things are obvious... 1) it's not that great, which is why the network dropped it and 2) you're going to watch it and get all wrapped up in it and it runs out of rope, leaving you frustrated to wits end!

2590894,1,B000FUTVUA,"Oy. What complete kaka. All the washed-up actors you could ask for in a single catastrophe of a catastrophe flick. The writing was like something out of a Jr. High play. The ""acting"" was as wooden and staid as you could ever imagine a hostage proof-of-life video capture might be. The ""special"" effects were horrid. The dumbness of the plotline and side stories just made me want to puke.

I couldn't finish this beater. Way too stupid; way too awful. Stay far, far away.",1523404800,,471,4.607142857142857

2590898,2,B000FUTVUA,"WOW, the other reviewers were so spot on regarding this movie and the camera zoom.  Zoom in, zoom out, zoom in, zoom out, zoom in and out super fast.  It's as if they thought it would give them a dramatic effect.  Well, the only thing it did was make me stop watching.  That and the blank look on Kim Delaney's face, most of the time, looked as if she was slightly smiling, when anyone else would be shocked(?), afraid(?).  I had hoped to like this show.  bummer",1523318400,,462,4.252873563218391

2590922,4,B000FUTVUA,"This was so corny and cheesy -- I loved it!  Terrible script, overacted, glaring plot holes -- it sucked me right in.  A total throwback to the melodramatic TV movies of the 80's.  They looked like they were having lots of fun making it.  I was having fun watching it and yelling, ""But that doesn't make sense!""  and laughing at the lines they said.  It desperately needs a sequel.",1523059200,,381,4.449275362318841
2590923,1,B000FUTVUA,"Bad acting, ridiculous story line. But the worst part is the camera work. Hope you don't have epilesy or are prone to vertigo or other balancing issues. Because the constant zoom in, zoom out, zoom in, zoom out will make you sick.",1522972800,,230,4.5

Then zoom in on the person you were talking to so you know it is intense for them too!""  ZOOM zoom ZOOM zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom cut frame zoom zoom zoom zoom.  Did a first year film student film this this?  Also/// horrible effects.  I thought for a moment I made a mistake about what I selected and had accidentally picked something filmed in the 1970s.

2590927,1,B000FUTVUA,I could only watch a few minutes of this disaster movie. The CGI is good but the constant zoom in zoom out of the actors is ridiculous. Same camera technic as NYPD Blue.

If I'd seen this guy madly zooming in and out I'd have walked off the set the first day. Guessing some wanted to.  This is the most nuttiest cinematography ever seen.

2590943,4,B000FUTVUA,"If you like non-stop disaster action, you'll love this series. That said, I did find a few things wrong that should have been addressed by the writers/producers.  First, there's no mention of events anywhere else in the world. They could have easily had the newscasters mention other problems around the globe. There's also no mention of help from other countries. The second problem I had is that it took four days of constant disasters before the President of the United States decided to speak to the nation. ""I need to address the nation,"" the president says. Yeah, you should have done that before now, Mr. President. Along with not mentioning the rest of the world, there was no mention of national security events or suggestions of our bringing military forces back to help deal with the disasters. There is also the instant time element that the main characters experienced when traveling to events. A guy in Denver says he needs to go to Lake Mead to get a first-hand look. A few seconds later, he's there in a helicopter, flying over it like it was just down the block from Denver. The father rescued in Las Vegas turns up in Denver a few minutes later, talking to his daughter. That happened a lot in this series.  Finally, I'd like to know what cellphone batteries they were using, as their cell phones never seemed to die. It's a fun disaster flick with non-stop action - but nothing more than that.",1522368000,,1412,4.666666666666667
2590944,1,B000FUTVUA,"How is it possible to shake the camera so wildly and zoom in and out ALL the time will lead to a good viewer experience?

2590947,4,B000FUTVUA," (Apocalypse) means ""To Reveal what is Hidden"" it has nothing to do with ""end times"" as such, you ignorant yanks!

But let that go.

I like Kim Delaney. Not as much as I like Dana Delany  (no relation, actually, but they look enough alike to be sisters) but I like her. I also like Beau Bridges, his brother, Jeff, and their Dad, Lloyd (aka Mike Nelson of SEA HUNT to MY generation).and I like David Cubitt, her partner in crime for this and the original 10.5 event. I miss Fred Ward in this one but having Frank ""Dracula"" Langella on hand comforts me a lot. Peter Outerbridge (Happy Town) is in this and doing a great job (as usual). Melissa Sue Anderson, too, as the First Lady.is 21 years younger than her husband in this film but I'm no ageist.  And I like Gabrielle Beauvais (Spider-Man: Homecoming , The Magicians Grimm (here still being billed as Gabrielle Beauvais-Nilon later she had to abandon the Nilons...they made her legs all pimply).

ANYWAY. You will have read that the FX are nothing to shout about in this Return to 10,5.
They aren't.
The science is ""iffy"" at best but that's the point of a ""science fiction"" story. You take a scientific premise (plate tectonics) and extrapolate with a good dash of ""what if"" and you get a story. This cause behind these events probably COULDN'T happen. In other words Pangaea shall not rise again.
But a land mass split down the middle by a seismic event?
Yellowstone will give it the good old college try one of these days. It's only a matter of time.
The cast (those I recognize and those I don't) are pretty darned good. Excellent job all around.
The story? Not bad. For those who resent the usual ""tropes"" what do you see happening if events such as these go down?

It's a dollar store version of 10.5 but it has its redeeming moments. I wouldn't consign it to the waste bin.",1522022400,,1832,4.467065868263473

Yet, borrowing the emotions transmitted by the actor portraying the mayor of NYC, just like in the movie, we, New Yorkers have come together and rebuilt.  As such, not only I view this movie as a testimony of the strength and valor of the citizens of New York, but also as a premonition of the horrors which befell us, just 2 years later.

2590964,2,B000FUTVUA,"10.5 APOCALYPSE which is a sequel to the original TV movie 10.5 from few years before
i'm surprised there's a sequel at all, the original 10.5 TV movie was tolerable to watch in terms of the acting performances
and so was the plot very exagerated
so this sequel which was filmed for TV broadcast over 2 nights is actually worse in terms of the acting performances,
Beau bridges as the President very average acting pretty bad acting, Kim Delaney as Geologist Dr Hill it's tolerable
and one of the Actresses playing one of the Volunteer helpers in the film is The presidents Daughter, that's over the top
i was very surprised to see Frank Langella play role in the film, Frank is a stage & screen actor not a TV actor
maybe he had no other acting offers at the time this TV movie was filmed
the plot is major Exageration the special visual effects mostly done with CGI (Computer generated images)
anyway Echo bridge owns the rights to the film now and has reissued it on dvd and blu-ray
and both formats are in 1:78: ratio with 5.1 dolby sound quality
 and have no extras, no audio commentary by Director John Lafia, no behind the scenes featurette no TV trailer
all you get is the main menu and options to play part 1 & part 2 and scene selection that is it.
pretty pathetic effort by Echo bridge
so if you don't want to spend lots of money buying the blu-ray reissue, just buy the dvd
they're both no different in regards to extras
about 2-3 stars for the TV fim itself, about 1-2 stars for the blu-ray & dvd reissue based on no extras nothing
so best to buy the dvd version to save money",1496275200,,1589,4.35016835016835

2591077,4,B000FUTVUA,"Part of my feeling towards this film is due to my mistake in watching it only a few weeks  following the first miniseries, 10.5, to which this a sequel. On the one hand, knowing the background of the characters and the earthquake team allowed for a smoother transition into this movie which leaps right into the action with no effort to familiarize the viewer with them. On the other hand, having recently experienced about all the smashing effects which the creators could devise, undercut the seriousness with which one could  take these similar ones (not to mention the difficulty of accepting poor President Beau Bridges going through the  same motions so soon after one saw him doing the same thing for only the West Coast).
Beyond that, looking to introduce something new for the audience, they borrowed the 'burrowing through the wreckage to escape a collapsed building' scene from almost every disaster movie made in the last century, including the various Poseidon calamities. Most difficult to swallow was that this was going to be the one  that divided the country into two separate land masses with a watery  gap between them. That, for me, moved the show into the B category of 'The Monster Who Ate Tokyo'  and the like.
Without going on with this listing, I can summarize by saying that, to a recent viewer of the better original,  this one seemed to be action without meaningful characters, and an overblown scenario which had no credibility.
Recommendation:  for those who have seen the original, don't bother seeing this one until memories have faded sufficiently to make the action seem new but still related to remembered character development. Under those conditions it may be quite a decent watching experience. Those who did not see the original should find it entertaining but needing multiple days toi avoid earthquake fatigue.",1369440000,3,1851,4.987012987012987

If I knew who to blame for this annoyance believe me, I'd post their name here.  Half of the time they were invading personal space, the other half they were backing way off.  I suppose they were attempting to inject some frenetic action in an otherwise static story.  It didn't work; instead, it just came off as drunken and disorderly.
As for the story, I could imagine someone with a clipboard checking off all the plot devices they wanted to utilize in this epic of mass distortion.  A spate of messy history/rocky relationships, check.  Mystified experts, check.  Dead volcanoes erupting, double check.  Inspirational flag waving sentiments, check.  Anomalies of the scary variety, check.  A crazy theory that comes complete with an indispensible crazy old coot, check.  Reciting numbers with an excitable voice as though numbers alone were drama enough, check, check, check.
I really don't know what they were trying to achieve with this blunder, but a great movie wasn't part of their agenda.  Or.  They were just incredibly inept.  At any rate, with this doomsday scenario everyone is going to have to relearn geography.  Since I have no plans to do that and since I've seen Mount Rushmore destroyed about a b-zillion times in various disaster movies, and really don't care what happened in Vegas....although I do wonder how they thought they could lift a scene from The Poseidon Adventure and not have anyone notice!?

2591104,1,B000FUTVUA,"Bad script. Worse science. Throw in some good actors and computer animation to make it seem realistic ... but oh! It doesn't work. Not anymore, NBC. Asteroid was bad. This is worse. You can start with the title, which plagiarizes the title of yet another completely-ignorant-of-science disaster movie, The Day After Tomorrow. (Unlike this, however, TDAT was actually a pretty good movie.)

That in a nutshell describes NBC's 10.5 Apocalypse.

It starts where the original 10.5 left off. Now, I didn't like that movie either, but at least they got right the fact that there is a lot of seismic activity on the West Coast. But then California fell into the ocean. You get the idea that the show's producer got jilted by some Hollywood starlet, and that's why they insisted on destroying Los Angeles and the Hollywood sign. Or, more likely, they just copied every disaster flick since 1990. The scientific problem with that movie is that a.) they turned two fault zones with completely different motions into what is essentially a rift valley, b.) they missed a very good opportunity to show how seismologists actually measure the magnitude of an earthquake - which, by the way, does not increase as the earthquake gets longer, c.) they forgot that nuclear weapons are better at creating or triggering earthquakes than stopping them, and d.) they forgot to realize that magnitude 10.5 earthquakes only happen as the result of asteroid impacts. They could have combined 10.5 and Asteroid and been right about a few things.

Well, apparently the earthquake the seismologists started to stop the West Coast from sinking into the Pacific caused a tsunami. Goodbye Hawaii. Then next, the volcanoes in the Cascades start going off one by one. I suppose they forgot to research that too. Although a movement along the Cascadia subduction zone would feed a little extra crust into the area, resulting in a few extra eruptions perhaps, that process would take at least a hundred (thousand?) years or more. I don't know, I'm not a geologist, but I'm thinking they hurried things up for the sake of time. Well, I suppose that's forgiveable.

This is where we are introduced to a pair of brothers who insist on working out their struggles during the heat of a rescue mission, completely ignoring protocol. Their little argument about who leads the pair will wear you out through the rest of the movie. So ... Sam Hill's father, the great earthquake genius who conveniently predicted everything that happens in the two movies, is stuck in a Las Vegas that is slowly sinking beneath the ground. (Gee, you would have thought he would have gone somewhere he knew was safe.) Meanwhile her boyfriend is reading the temperature of Lake Mead, and instead of calling out a rate of temperature increase, he decides to yell out the temperature every four seconds, making him so stupid that he tells his pilot to fly him below the level of the dam, *after* saying that the dam will break from an earthquake or something. Well, he dies and Sam Hill seems briefly upset. Then she's back onto the mission like nothing happened. Sucks to be him.

Meanwhile, there's a fault line that insists on targeting Mount Rushmore snaking across the Midwest where there is no fault line. Pause.

Wouldn't it make more sense to have the fault start in the New Madrid Seismic Zone, which is where the North American plate attempted to rift itself apart some hundreds of millions of years ago? They could have made their fault follow the course of the Mississippi River! But they didn't. Unpause.

Our famous band of brothers is called in to save other members of the cast in Las Vegas. Conveniently Sam Hill's father is able to make his way up and through the various levels of the building without much help. Our genius/hero is rescued along with a few strippers he brought with him, and the big brother dies a theatrical death, since it was apparently easier to kill one of them than to have them resolve their conflict.

So the Midwestern fault is snaking toward a nuclear reactor. This time, the bright idea is to use explosives that are a million times less powerful than the atomic bombs they used to ""save"" the West Coast to divert a fault that is about ten times the size of the San Andreas. Yeah, makes a lot of sense. But it works ... briefly and inexplicably so. Nature ultimately wins and splits the nation in two with a 50 mile wide channel of water.

Now, think on this. The fault has probably already killed a few million people, having gone through Dallas and Houston, and it's already destroyed George Washington's stone face on Mt. Rushmore. But the President and his scientist hacks are upset only *after* the fault reaches the Gulf of Mexico? Give me a break. After all those people dying, having a canal through the Midwest, opening up tons of new places for sea trade, imports and exports, plus delivering a whole lot of water (albeit salt water) to the often dry Plains states, seems like a pretty good thing, even if it does split the country in two. So why is everybody so upset about it now? Indonesia is made of at least 10,000 islands. I'm guessing they would all be on Prozac if they saw this movie ... or half a bottle of Ambien. And, of course, we get the comforting speech at the end. It seems to be more of a discourse on the political tensions in the US after the 2004 Presidential election between Kerry and Bush than a fitting end for the movie.

So there you have it. Spoilers and all. I'm very happy to spoil it for you. Now you can go watch a much cooler movie with much better acting and plot, like Twilight.",1284508800,3,5604,4.680203045685279

2591125,1,B000FUTVUA,"My husband likes campy, disaster movies... so he bought this just to see the special effects. We got comfy, turned out the lights and prepared to watch a movie we weren't really having high expectations for anyway, but thought it might be good for some of the intense end-of-the-world disaster scenes at the very least. It turned out, I could not even stay in the same room with this movie for longer than the first 5 minutes. THE CAMERAMAN IN CHARGE OF FILMING THIS NEEDS TO HAVE HIS CAMERA FOREVER REVOKED for the RIDICULOUS zooming and constantly MOVING camera angles. There is literally not a period longer than one second where the lens is not zooming in, zooming out, zooming FURTHER out, zooming back in, zooming waaaaay in to where you are almost looking up someone's nostrils, then back out again. I have never seen anything more annoying in my life. I tried to ignore it and watch it but finally had to give it up because it was giving me a headache and making me feel SICK.

I have no idea how they thought moving the camera in and out constantly was going to produce any effect other than to annoy the crap out of the viewers. There is nothing good about this movie. I'm sorry. I had low expectations to start with but really, really have never see anything this bad before.

In fact, I have never reviewed a movie before. The HORRIBLENESS of the camera work of this movie ""inspired"" me to come to Amazon and share my frustration over the stupidity of the way this movie was filmed. It is a shame they could not have produced something that you can watch without feeling ill when they had some pretty interesting special effects at the very beginning to work with. But it was all downhill from there. Any scene which has a human being in it is ruined with a hundred different zoom-angles in the span of a minute or two. My 10 year old shoots better video, seriously.",1268352000,22,1878,4.4723032069970845

(USA/Germany/Canada - 2003)

Aspect ratio: 1.33:1
TV soundtrack: Dolby Digital

Once upon a time, US network television produced memorable, must-see miniseries' like ROOTS, FATAL VISION, HELTER SKELTER and THE ATLANTA CHILD MURDERS, movies with real grit and integrity. Nowadays, they produce rubbish like '10.5', an unmitigated disaster in every sense of the word, in which an earthquake in Seattle triggers a sequence of equally devastating tremors - each one worse than the last - which seismologist Kim Delaney believes will culminate in a massive, landscape-altering quake along the West Coast. Naturally, the l-o-n-g bits between disaster set-pieces (including the destruction of San Francisco and a spectacular climactic deluge) are populated with boring characters mouthing the usual soap opera clichs, while the scenes of destruction are as dramatic as they are scientifically unsound (ie. there's no such thing as a '10.5' earthquake; the Golden Gate Bridge was built to withstand even the most violent tremor, and will NOT collapse during seismic activity; nuclear explosions CANNOT seal faults in the earth's surface, etc.).

The script is utterly predictable throughout (virtually every character is divided from their loved ones, either geographically or emotionally, yet the quakes bring them together in the end and, yep, make them all better people as a consequence - puh-leeze!!), and Beau Bridges plays the President with such overstated 'fortitude' and 'compassion', he comes off looking like some godawful televangelist, and is just as convincing. Even worse, David Foreman's largely hand-held camera-work - a swirling mess of zooms and zip-pans, borrowed from TV's ""NYPD Blue"" and designed to convey a sense of realism where none exists - seems calculated to drive viewers up the wall. The much-heralded visual effects are only intermittently successful, and most of 'em look like what they are - CGI images (EARTHQUAKE, SAN FRANCISCO and THE BIG ONE: THE GREAT LOS ANGELES EARTHQUAKE contain much better depictions of widespread devastation). Appalling stuff, directed by John Lafia (CHILD'S PLAY 2 - 'nuff said), and promoted under the titles '10.5: Apocalypse' and 'Earthquake 10.5'.",1255132800,3,2214,5.541420118343195
2591128,2,B000FUTVUA,"Even though the storyline, casting, acting, and special effects are okay, the ways the cameras are moving and zooming in and out, much like amateurs taking home videos without good image stabilization, give me headaches.  The cameras zoom in and out a lot even within a split second.  I don't understand what effects the director wants to create besides giving people headaches.
Also, for quite a lot of shots, there is significant and intolerable snowy noise.",1254614400,3,460,5.0394736842105265
2591129,4,B000FUTVUA,"As with 10.5, this movie was believable and entertaining.  Although I found some characters to be a little annoying, overall performances were great.",1254182400,,149,5.478260869565218
2591130,3,B000FUTVUA,"There isn't a whole lot new that can be said about the 2006 two-part miniseries 10.5: APOCALYPSE that hasn't been said about its 2004 ""prequel"" (which was just 10.5), except that it's a special effects extravaganza come true, with no fidelity to scientific plausibility.  This time, an all-star cast, including Dana Delany, Beau Bridges (as the President), and Frank Langella, find that the catastrophic earthquakes that leveled Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle in the original miniseries are growing so intense that they will eventually split the continental shelf asunder, and cause parts of the United States to separate.  This, of course, requires radical and (naturally) implausible action.

John Lafia, who both directed and co-wrote both this film and the original, went to great pains to declare both films to be entertainment, not to be believed.  It's just very hard, however, to get past the level of implausibility that is thrown the viewer's way in 10.5: APOCALYPSE.  As in the original, this implausibility, combined with rather lame dialogue and melodrama that makes even the much-maligned 1974 sci-fi/disaster opus EARTHQUAKE seem like Stanley Kubrick or Steven Spielberg helmed it, weighs everything down to a large degree.

But then again, the biggest reason for the existence of 10.5: APOCALPYSE, as was the case with the original, is the incredible special effects destruction sequences, this time involving Las Vegas and Houston; and the rescue sequences are done with a certain measure of credibility.  This is, as advertised, a very uneven flick, and definitely rates a zero for plausibility; but as a special effect's lover's paradise, it does indeed rate a 10.5.",1247529600,,1694,5.298507462686567
2591131,1,B000FUTVUA,"...just because this silly movie is one of those that has the potential to be one that's so bad it ends up being ""good,"" i.e. trying so hard to be serious that it ends up being unintentionally hilarious.  I'll leave aside the predictable plot twists (e.g. ""let's all celebrate now, 'cause we've beaten it, oh wait, oh my God, turns out we're not out of the woods yet""), and the ridiculous scientific premise, 'cause after all this is supposed to be science fiction/disaster/adventure, and there's no law written saying that reality suspension is necessarily bad in such a movie.  A lot of the comedy potential is in the nauseatingly petty, overacted middle-school drama going on between supposedly adult characters--which they somehow have the time and energy to indulge in even while the entire world is crumbling around them.  This lends itself to derisive laughter as well as cynical contempt for all concerned--you might find yourself rooting for the ever-expanding crack in the earth to swallow them all up and give a nice, juicy, self-satisfied belch.  This movie could thus end up being a cult classic.

However, all this comedic potential is ruined by the annoying, amateurish camera work--the entire movie feels like it was filmed by some 8-year old who just discovered the zoom function on his parents' video camera.  In and out, in and out, in a little further, whoops, a little too much, so pan back out just a smidge, then zoom in again so fast it makes your head spin.  This goes on in EVERY SINGLE SCENE, the idea being, I suppose, to create ""drama"" or ""tension.""  But such a gimicky technique is simply being used here to try to artificially infuse drama into the most banal of scenes.  In this it fails miserably, succeeding only in creating intense irritation and utter loathing for the cameraman, the editors, the director, the producers, indeed the entire movie.  My suggestion: don't waste your money on this cheesy dreck--even only one star is too much for this clunker-- if you feel like you can't live without seeing it, wait until it appears again on one or more of the cable channels--which it seems to do with startlingly contemptible regularity.  And if you are the sort of person who DOES feel like they NEED to see a movie like this, then, well, I'm at a total loss for words...",1246233600,28,2308,4.773869346733668

2591161,3,B000FUTVUA,"...then you'll probably like this one, since it's practically the same movie. I myself really liked the first one. It was fun on a no-brainer level and the cast, led by the very likable Kim Delaney, was at the very least capable, given what they had to work with. It sounds like I'm bashing these films, but really I'm not. I enjoyed both of them, but I have to admit this one left me slightly disappointed for two reasons. Warning, spoilers ahead!!

1) The death of David Cubitt's character barely an hour into the film. I thought he was a good partner and possible love interest for Kim Delaney's character and the way that he was eliminated was ridiculous, to the point where I seriously thought they were going to bring him back towards the end, bruised but still alive. And after a short crying episode from Kim, he's never mentioned again! Not once in the whole second half of the film! Not even when her father comes back. Weird!

2) The way too abrupt ending. Honestly, when I noticed that there was only three or four minutes left to the film and the fault line was still heading towards the coast, I thought ""there must be another part to this"" or perhaps the DVD inexplicably left out the ending. But no, the fault line hits the Gulf Of Mexico, the President utters a ten second speech, and the end credits pop up! Are you kidding me? What happens to the rest of the cast? Yes, the Oliver Hudson character and his wife make it (in my opinion the least interesting characters), but what about the President's daughter and the doctor she was working with? What about the woman who was heading up the rescue efforts in Las Vegas? Didn't she need closure too, considering at the beginning of the film she was still reeling from an accident a year or so prior to this? All these subplots are thrown to the wind. One almost gets the impression that the filmmakers ran out of money and just tacked on the ending.

So, in conclusion, yes the film is flawed, but hey, these films aren't meant to be taken seriously, so sit down, put your brain in neutral and enjoy.",1220054400,5,2067,4.4485488126649075
2591162,3,B000FUTVUA,"As I understand, this is a follow up from another mini series. Since I never saw the previous one, I was a bit surprised to how this begins. The movie (wich is really a 2 part mini series, also put together as a 2 parter on this disc) really begins in the middle of a starting disaster. No intro story whatsoever. I even checked to see if I didn't somehow accidentally started the disc somewhere in the middle instead of beginning. Anyway, once started, it really keeps going.
 Like I say in the title, I thought it was a nice filling for a rainy weekend (wich it was now here), and in my case a saturday evening and sunday afternoon. I rated it 3 stars since it is a tv series. Was it a ""real movie"" for the cinema's, I proabably would have given it 1 or 2 stars. But as a tv series or tv-films go, I think this was quite entertaining.
 The acting isn't top notch but barable enough. It is really all action so once started there's never a real dull moment, wich is good I think. Focus everything on the action and people won't notice the b-acting and mediocre CGI, I guess is what the makers were thinking. ;)  And it works. The CGI is of mediocre quality I think but then again, this is a few years old now and I guess they don't get as a big of a budgets for these things as for cinema-movies with big stars in it. And keep in mind that really LOT is going on! I mean almost half of the US is being destructed here!

Yes, in my opinion a nice filler for a long rainy day or 2. Especially if you like disaster movies. And the price is more than fair. Though I do wonder if you shouldn't get the dvd instead of the BR since I didn't had the idea the picture was really ""Blu Ray worthy."" And the sound is only regulal stereo wich is a shame.

It is a fact that at somepoint in time there was a huge divide in the two coasts, but nothing like this can ever happen.
With that out of the way, i believe the acting was barely ok. I only saw it once, and never want to see it again, which is rare for me.  Some of the concepts come straight out of 10.5.  Meaning some ridiculous action would have had to be taken to avert this disaster.  They actually get one thing right, politics.  Without giving the ending up, it took along time for the plan to come to light and approved.

2591178,1,B000FUTVUA,"I've been hard on some movies. I really, really disliked this movie. I looked for good points, I found few.

The hammy screenplay had some natural, flowing dialog, but most of it was cumbersome and strictly B-movie material in substance and feel. Its hard to point at the screenplay or the director, it just typified all that is bad. The effects were poor, as might be expected from the Towering Inferno or Earthquake, but the movie was made much more recently...standards have increased.

The story line was absurd, even compared to some of Irwin Allen's classics.

Initially, I liked the jerky, 8th grade cinematography, but as the first hour came and went it became hard on the eyes.

Normally, I would be able to say ""At least it was short."" It wasn't. It was very long.

I actually went over in my head, areas that Oscars were awarded for, to see what I could find that I liked about it. Nothing stood out as good. There were several egregious areas, cinematography (see above), acting performances, screenplay. Even the costume design was non-existent. The highlight of the costume design was that the heroic civilian volunteers, dressed in street clothes, had pieces of tape with their names written on them for identification.

Tag lines call it a ""disaster film"". One out of two ain't a bad batting average.

I love the movie! Plenty of special effects and there's always something going on. It's a long movie but well worth the time and you won't be bored if you like disaster films. So why did I rate it only 3 stars? After watching this movie my first thought was, what happened to the soundtrack! When I saw the ocean pulling back from the shore I didn't expect it to sound like a wind tunnel test done in a tin can. (this is at the beginning of the movie so I'm not giving anything away) Voices come through fine but the special effects are confusing to the mind. Your eyes see one thing and you hear something completely different.

The original 10.5 was put out by Lions Gate Films. The 10.5 Apocalypse on Amazon says the DVD is put out by Platinum Disc? but my DVD was put out by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment. I contacted them about the soundtrack and received an email today stating that they are aware of the soundtrack problem and IF they ever reissue this movie the problem will be fixed. But the DVDs they put out there are defective.

So I say 5 Stars for the movie, 3 Stars for the awful soundtrack.
