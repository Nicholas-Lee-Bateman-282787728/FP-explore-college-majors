7980087,3,B00008976N,"While dragonball gt was a completely different series that wasn't quite planned, this series ended wrong.
Instead of ending this series with a happy ending that tied things up, they decided they were going to make MORE episodes instead of just ending it. I loved dragonball z, but then they started repeating a theme.
Step 1: Find a way to beat your opponent
Step 2: Play around with your opponent for 3-5 episodes
Step 3: Decide finally kill your opponent, but learn that he has now figured out a way to beat you!
Step 4: Repeat steps over again.
Sadly, for those of you who haven't seen the majin buu series...
They could of destroyed majin buu thousands of times. Goku even says, ""I could of destroyed him, but I really wanted to let the boys do it."" Are you kidding me? Basically every character becomes annoying in the Majin Buu saga. When I say every character, I mean Piccolo and Krillin. Mostly because they have to say everything thats obvious like, ""O MY GOD HOW CAN GOKU GIVE OFF THAT MUCH ENERGY!"" or things like, ""GUYS, GOKU JUST TRANSFORMED!"". Honestly, the series goes downhill in the majin buu saga. This dvd has one or 2 good fights, but then they decide to make it have no ending. Seriously, the ending doesn't tell you what happens to anyone.
No, the cell saga was good but this dvd ends the great DBZ in no way what-so-ever. I would suggest you lower your standards for the so-called great ending...
So you know, I am not joking when I say that this dvd ends the series in no way at all, but it does prolong it for even longer into a series called Dragonball GT(which is really bad compared to DBZ and DB).",1068940800,,1626,4.423333333333333

7980089,4,B00008976N,"It's sad but all good things have to come to and end. After over 400 episodes start from the original DB, the series manages to come to an end that leaves the audience hungry for more. This is incredible in anime, where the average series is about 30 episodes. Despite GT, which is not a bad series, DB started with Akira Toriyama and in my opinion, ended with him. GT has great animation and moments which capture the essense of DB , but it's just not the same. This is the true ending of the epic DB saga and it does not disapoint. Although, the 1st episode, where Gokou protects the dinosaur egg is boring at times (even though Chi-Chi's dancing is far from boring), the Tenchiaki tournament is exciting and the only right way to finish DBZ,which has had so many of these tournaments. The fruity guy fighter hitting on Trunks, Vegita (with his back turned) knocking some punk ... kid 10 miles away, and Pan (Gohan and Videl's daughter) are all funny. The final fight between Gokou and the reincarnation of Majin Buu, Ubuu, is the kind of fight that reminds us why we love this series so much. If there wasn't an Evangelion or Cowboy Bebop, DBZ would arguably be the greatest anime series of all time. 4 star DVD, 5 stars of sadness",1047340800,4,1234,4.440528634361233
