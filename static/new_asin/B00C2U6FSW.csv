8576758,5,B00C2U6FSW,"This is a fun movie, full of dancing and singing by the precocious yet peppy child star Jane Withers. If you thought Shirley Temple was the talent of her generation, think again, because Jane Withers is amazing.  She's a bit of a scrappy tomboy that is a ray of sunshine. In this film, Jane is part of a band of traveling gypsies who sing and dance for money. The troupe comes across a mysterious young heiress who was in a car accident (Rochelle Hudson). She has lost her memory as a result. Jane suggests she become a Fortune Teller in order to earn money for an operation that will restore her memory. The gypsies discover she was engaged to a man she didn't love. Once her memory is restored, she has to choose between the gypsy she fell in love with or go back to her old way of living. Jane does a lot of delightful dancing and singing. Although she was billed in ""B"" pictures (and sometimes in roles that Shirley Temple mother's rejected), she is an unheralded talent. Her singing and dancing are just as good (if not better) than Shirley's. She also has an extraordinary gift of mimicry; she could do accents convincingly while Shirley could not. I love Jane's character in her films: she plays a scrappy tomboy with a heart of gold. Feisty yet positive and energetic, her performances jump from the screen. She definitely upstaged Shirley in ""Bright Eyes"" as the bratty Joy Smythe. You and your family will enjoy this movie. It is clean, wholesome entertainment with a little dynamo as its star.",1384387200,2,1504,4.57037037037037
