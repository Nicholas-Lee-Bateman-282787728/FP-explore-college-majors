8719346,5,B00YYISWBI,"The criminals and crimes were hard to digest, but the acting, particularly Elba's, was award-winning (he won a golden globe as Luther). Because of the Luther mini-series, I have bought almost all other Elba movies. I find him compelling and terrifically talented. His eyes are so evocative he could almost act without talking. I even bought The Dark Tower to see him as the Gunslinger. I live in Maine where horror writer Stephen King also lives, but before Tower I had only seen one other film based on his creepy stories: Stand by Me (a lovely change from his horror sagas.) The Dark Tower is fantastical and full of adversity and adventure and I loved it. I can't imagine anyone but Elba playing the Gunslinger.",1521763200,,714,4.72

8719350,5,B00YYISWBI,"It only works in my newest BluRay player, but it's great as I could only find DVD when only the first two were available, so it's nice to revisit seasons 1 & 2 in nice quality before getting into what is new to me. I'm forcing myself (hard work) to pace myself and not binge watch and tip off acquaintances how obsessive I can be (my friends already know.",1459900800,,355,4.159420289855072
