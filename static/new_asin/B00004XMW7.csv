Jelly Roll Morton's ragtime and Madam Lulu Whites brothel, and finally the end of an era with the arrival of WW1. A must see for Jazz fans as well as history buffs.

Good to see the history of this Esoteric Community that needs to be equal under the law in America so it can
come from underneath the table and be safely regulated and legally enjoyed by all who want it.
This movie proves that Whoring didn't start with Heidi Fleiss' Skinny White As*!!",1471392000,,390,4.735294117647059

7926467,4,B00004XMW7,"I purchased this on VHS some years ago. What I found so interesting is to listen to the slang words during that era. Such as:

'Sporting women'
'Good timing'
'Crib houses'
'Crib girls'
'Slumming'
'Do-wrong people'
'B-girls'
'Mustezoes'
and Jessie Brown's One Dollar Breakfast Special.

One thing I found rather odd was they didn't mention the movie ""Pretty Baby"" at all, much less show clips of the film, when it took place during that time. Before that many people had probably never heard of Storyville. I don't think I had until the movie came out.

Regardless it's an interesting-to-see documentary.",1332892800,,603,5.01
7926468,3,B00004XMW7,"A documentary of New Orleans sex industry legal at the beginning of the XXth century (till 1917).

Funny original stills and some ideas for busting recent revenue.

Not too deep work.",1321315200,,183,4.870967741935484

7926470,5,B00004XMW7,"This is an important piece of the history of New Orleans, an overview of the area where so much of the history of jazz took place, It was a very sordid story, I have always been sorry that so much of old New Orleans was wiped away, which has denied us the opportunity to see it how it was.",1244419200,,289,3.9152542372881354

7926472,3,B00004XMW7,"Storyville existed from 1898 to 1917 as a district where prostitution was not illegal-nor was it strictly legal, either. This film, narrated by a fictional prostitute of the era, attempts to depict Storyville and its denizens. It features an interview with Al Rose, whose book 'Storyville New Orleans' is the definitive work on the topic. The film is very strong on the life of the prostitutes and the social structure of Storyville. It makes some over-generalizations about jazz that can be pardoned in a glossy work. Male prostitution goes unmentioned. The worst flaw is that it provides none of the reasoning for the establishment of Storyville-the French Quarter was over-run with bordellos, among other things-and it has very little discussion of what happened after Storyville was closed down. Rent this DVD if you can, except for hard-core New Orleans history buffs (like me) it's not a keeper.",1091664000,15,901,5.136054421768708
