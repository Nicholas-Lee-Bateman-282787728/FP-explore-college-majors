8671487,5,B00MBNZCU2,"The films of Ted Knighton are an extraordinary collection of imaginative scenarios. I have been fortunate to see these films in the theater and can attest to their bold cinematic impact. Mr. Knighton's vision of the world is not about willful strangeness for its own sake; rather, Mr. Knighton seems to find the everyday world we inhabit  as one of unnoticed portent, and if one can bear to look, this world is strange beyond anything we might indulgently attempt. So despite the ironic DVD cover, he really does seem to bear more resemblance to high surrealism than low Lovecraft. The surrealists seem to derive their fantasies form the quotidian, and Lovecraft is the sort of fantasist trying to freak you out with strangeness for its own sake. But these sophisticated, largely silent films communicate a dread and an awe with regard to the world we encounter again when we wake up. Highly recommended.",1417996800,,904,4.908496732026144
