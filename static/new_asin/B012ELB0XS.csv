8726114,5,B012ELB0XS,"Not since ""Pulp Fiction"" have I been so excited about seeing a film that was nothing like any other film I had seen before with so much innovation and yet it was accessible and entertaining. Shot in black & white in a 4:3 aspect ratio (less wide screen like a square), with unconventional camera moves, it all sounds super pretentious and I thought would be distracting and or annoying but it was not at all! Talk about artistic courage also. ""The Revenant"" was my favorite film last year and so was this, Mexican filmmakers are kicking butt!",1464134400,3,542,4.597938144329897

8726118,5,B012ELB0XS,"Terrific, smart, poignant film; a road movie but mostly about DF, about youth, nihilism, idealism, and family.  One of the best movies I've seen this year [and I watch a tremendous amount of movies].",1448236800,3,199,4.852941176470588
