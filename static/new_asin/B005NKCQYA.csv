8480565,5,B005NKCQYA,"For a first-time filmmaker to develop an at-length short, with the aspirations of a feature-level story, I applaud writer-director-producer Tiara Luten. She succinctly packs a punch with dialogue that makes you stop and think about relationships in your own life; characters whose scenarios nearly everyone can relate to either personally or with someone close to them; and brings up the age-old question everyone in today's overly busy, career-driven times asks themselves at a certain point in their lives - which is taking a look around at one's job, relationship choices and asking ""is this enough?"" And, pining for a game-changing love if the answer is ""no."" The moments of this movie stuck with me, as does the storytelling savvy of its filmmaker.",1346630400,2,753,5.180327868852459
