1381874,5,B00004Z4WR,Being a man that love cars and car chases I found this movie very good.  The nitro chase was very good and I can't wait to hear the engines on some  serious audio equipment.  Being that I haven't viewed the DVD yet I hope  that the transfer is excellent.  Definitely recommend to car lovers.  Nicolas Cage rules.,969408000,,312,4.385964912280702

1381877,5,B00004Z4WR,"Wow! This has got to be the best movie I have seen in a long time. The  storyline was not what I had it out to be... with Nick Cage and his little  brother, and the car chase scenes were amazing. The best one with the GT in  the Storm Duct, amazing seeing it outrun a helicopter. Definate one for me  to add to my collection of DVD's.",966470400,,334,3.8676470588235294

1381932,3,B00004Z4WR,"I don't understand how to review this.  The movie, OK , I like Cage (as long as he doesn't get Political).  The DVD itself, I won't know until I watch it (right now it's on my DVD shelf).  If I were to watch it and the DVD itself is fine, that is no guarantee that ALL of the other DVDs that people may buy will be OK.

1382020,4,B00004Z4WR,I really like this movie but I prefer the Director's cut. The director's cut of this movie is even better than the theatrical release.

1382042,5,B00004Z4WR,"this has always been and always will be one of my favorite Nicolas Cage movies. I also love Giovanni Ribisi. They did so well with the acting and the right amount of action vs humor. A definite cat vs mouse, where in the end, situations change the game. It is also a heartwarming story of the love for family, blood or not, and how you can easily build a bigger family through life experiences.

Nicolas Cage is good as a car thief who has a mental problem with a Mustang.  There are a lot of car chases and crashes and some pretty impossible situations that he manages to get into.  The cars are the center of the movie.  But the acting in this version is better.  With A-list stars like Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall.",1492128000,,453,4.270588235294118

I also read the book, ""Lone Survivor"" (and its sequel, ""Service"") when it first came out a few years back, and I must say, it was inspiring and riveting - I could not put it down.  It just displays the unique, best, qualities in Americans - being willing to be the first line of defense for our country, living and dying to put others first (a value I see declining in our beloved country).  It continues to inspire in me, as a retired public safety officer and Lifeguard, after losing 343 brothers in the World Trade Center, to push to be the best I could be, to serve, and to lead from the front (thanks, CPT Richard ""Demo Dick"" Marcinko), something lacking in our country's leadership.

1382869,4,B00004Z4WR,"There are 2 writers who are given credit for creating this film and I think we can all agree without the work of H.B. Halicki (the creator of the original Gone In 60 Seconds) this would not have been made.  The other writer who helped get this movie together was Scott Rosenburg who worked on the screenplay.

Untouchable car booster Randall ""Memphis"" Raines (Nicolas Cage) retired from the business. Now six years later, his brother, Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi) takes over ""the job"", employed by British car broker Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston). Well one night Kip feeling on top of his game messes up stealing some cars and gets into some major trouble, Memphis gets called back to the life he got out of to save his little brother. To save his brother he must: Steal 50 exotic cars all over Los Angeles and Long Beach in just one night and deliver them to Long Beach Harbor, Pier 14 by 8:00am, Friday morning.  If he does not deliver all of them and on time then he will never see his brother again. So Memphis and Kip need to get a crew together to get this done so they ask for some help from longtime friend Otto Halliwell (Robert Duvall) to get the old crew reassembled. That old crew includes sexy Sara ""Sway"" Wayland""(Angelina Jolie), Donny Astricky (Chi McBride), The Sphinx (Vinnie Jones). The only problem is the LAPD G.R.A.B. (Governor's Regional Auto-Theft Bureau). It's on the lookout and Det. Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and his partner, Det. Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant) are keeping close eyes on Memphis and his team. Can the team pull this assignment off and save Kip?  Can Memphis remain untouchable from Castlebeck and the cops? It's a long shot and it's going to be one hell of a ride but they may have a chance.

This movie gets a B.  It shows how much love Memphis has for his little brother, there are not that many people who are willing to put their lives on the line and possibly end up in jail to try to save a family member.  Maybe its just me because I don't know a family member that would risk going to jail for me.  That being said you can see the chemistry flow between Nicolas Cage and Giovani Ribisi because they make you feel like they truly are brothers.  When Ribisi is showing his anger at Cage for leaving him behind you really feel the sibiling bickering going on.  There are touches of comedy which I love to see in a movie like this because it breaks it up and makes the movie flow great.  Then the night they had to steal all the cars in my opinion was epic.  All in all watch this movie.

1382922,3,B00004Z4WR,"I am an avid fan of this movie. For me it's a sort of guilty pleasure. I am a plot/continuity freak. I typically obsess on the tiniest discrepancy in a movie but for some reason this one is just plain old fun.

I bought this hoping to find some extra footage tucked away nicely that might expand the story line a bit but to be honest, with the exception of a single seen near the beginning I didn't see anything I hadn't seen before. In fact, I actually think there was LESS footage than I'm used to - hence the 3 star rating.

Taken all and all, the premise is interesting enough, though predictable. Cage plays Memphis Raines, a car boost (thief) forced into retirement by his his mother in an attempt to protect his younger brother, Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) and prevent him from following in Cages footsteps. Of course this happens anyway and we find Cage being summoned back into the life of a car boost to make good on a contract his little brother botches. Into the mix we throw a few cops, a psychopathic Englishmen with a penchant for fine woodworking and a giant Bull Mastiff with a cast iron stomach and a sweet tooth for Mercedes keys.

While it probably won't make you split your sides laughing it never the less is a solid good time for anyone who likes car movies and isn't too put out by the liberties they tend to take.

As far as this particular product goes, I'd caution against it if you're a big fan. Get the regular version. It's actually better.",1399593600,2,1464,4.391143911439114

1382926,5,B00004Z4WR,"ok here it is, in some ways it is better then the original and some ways not so much. as you know the classic 1974 Gone in 60 seconds is a gear head classic. one stunt car and the amount of abuse it took is amazing (I know they fixed it between takes, but still).
but the acting is god awful almost unable to watch. the acting in the remake is MILES better, the story is crisp and stands up well. the cast is great and you believe they live in that world. it does not stand up to the original when it comes to car stunts. the 1973 ford mustang Mach 1 took an amazing amount of abuse and still runs to this day, the remake used the wrong mustang and CGI. but over all a great movie and it gets watched 3 to 4 times a year.",1397606400,,721,3.8456375838926173

1382954,5,B00004Z4WR,"This segment is another example of ""60 Minutes"" excellent investigative reporting
on the food industry practice of flavoring all packaged products that we eat.
Watch this again and again, its only 18 minutes long!!! Each time reveals another
aspect of American food production that you have never thought about.
The opening scene shows a team of ""tasters"" going through an orchard, picking
and tasting the most succulent fruit in order to come up with a new soft drink.
 Every nuance of the taste experience is recorded as well as the theory of how
the consumer will want to taste this.  You might think that this farmer, fruit grower
would be in line for lots of business if they pick his orchard to inaugurate the next
new taste craze.  Unfortunately, the tasters will take fruit samples back to their
Research & Development department TO COPY the taste chemically, perhaps
adding something that will cause the customer to WANT MORE, thereby, buy more!
Visually seeing the ""Champion Tasters"" and the scientists who develop The Taste
is priceless.  In the lab, there show a cabinet that houses 700 different types of
Raspberry flavor.  The viewer must come away with having to think seriously about what
we are eating, and why.  A very freeing epiphany for those dieters who blame them
selves every January for having to start 'dieting' AGAIN!  A deeper thought is to consider
if most packaged foods we eat are altered for the benefit of selling the product -- are
real food farmers out of business because their REAL food is no longer in demand,
since sub quality of food can be FLAVORED and sold as its Illustrated on the box!

of the DVD.",1390694400,,1731,4.765886287625418

What is nice about this film is that there is a good build-up of the story and backstory before setting off the high-octane car-stealing, car-chasing adrenaline-rush that will have you rooting for the 'bad guys'. And, man, can they drive!!! The gorgeous cars alone are a reason to watch this show!

1383005,4,B00004Z4WR,"I thought this was an awesome movie, I love the soundtrack, all the cars, Eleanor, everything. Probably my favorite NC movie of all time. So you have Kip who's a car thief on a 50 car boost job, only problem is he's young, cocky & pretty much inexperienced for the job. So he fumbles it & gets caught up, the guy who hired him for the job naturally gets ticked off & grabs the kid to end him. Memphis (Cage), who's apparently a legendary car thief himself, comes in to rescue his kid brother, Kip by taking the 50 car order to save his brothers life in a daring one night mega boost. Everything go's as planned until the final car on the list, 1967 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500, ELEANOR! Now if you are a true car guy, then this would be a must for your collection even if you are not a Ford fan, either the real deal or 1/18 diecast if you cannot afford it. As of this writing, an Eleanor has recently sold at an auction for $1million. This is the car those fools that wrote Fast & Furious Tokyo should've used for the final race. So then, all the cars do get delivered, maybe not all in one piece but they do get there. Our contractor who hired Cage to do the job seems to never had any intentions of paying for the job but he gets dealt with & we have a happy ending. My only gripes about this movie was I didn't really like Jolie's hair, it looked really disgusting she doe's not look good as a blonde, she rolls up on the crotch rocket & says ""no questions i'm here for Kip"", well duhh. Can 50 top end cars even be boosted in one night like that, I don't know I mean even with good careful planning that's alot of expensive cars. Great movie though, highly reccomend it...",1370217600,,1674,4.153846153846154

1383012,4,B00004Z4WR,"Nicolas Cage is a natural, Robert Duvall is classic, and Angelina Jolie is beautiful. Mix the three together and it is tough to miss. The screenplay is a bit derivative and formulaic, but entertaining nonetheless. Classic action, chase scenes, a villain you love to hate and characters you love to love combine to make ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" an enjoyable accomopaniment to a bowl of pocorn ona Friday night.",1368921600,,405,4.884057971014493
1383013,1,B00004Z4WR,"One word that comes to mind when I think about this movie...Ick!

Nick Cage plays...guess who..Nick Cage. His over acting and a plain stupid script make this a real mess of a movie. With an ugly Mustang with bolt on customizations as the ""Star"" of the show. Why guys rave over this silly car is a mystery. Probably because it looks like something you could sling together in your back yard on a Saturday afternoon while slugging down a few cool ones.

The bolt on parts look like something right out of the J.C. Whitney catalog. The semi truck running lights are a nice touch. I don't know for sure but this Mustang was probably designed by the same fellow that done the ""The Family Truckster"" in the film Vacation. You can almost hear the car cry because of it's shame. At least one thing you can say about the car, it didn't have a choice as to whether to be in this horrific movie or not. Some fool just paid over a million dollars for this POS.

I would say it is easily in the top ten worst movies of all time. Cage should be ashamed. But...he got paid, so I suppose that makes it alright with him.

If you watch it keep an air sick bag close by. And it would help if you have a lot of cool ones in you before you start.",1368835200,,1225,4.156118143459915

It is a fast paced action movie that has a lot of beautiful cars in it. Nicholas's brother in the movie gets caught up in the lifestyle Cage was in. Cage left and his brother took up the car boosting business. Cage's brother got into some trouble and Cage had to come back to help save his brother.

There are some good chase scenes, some cool-but-not-over-the-top action, and it's not super violent or anything. There's also some nice lighthearted humour to keep things real.

What did it for me was the amazing car chase scene threw the city as cops chase Cage threw the city.  This is also the Director's cut so we get few extra minutes of film not in regular version.  So if your looking for some intense car chase scenes, be able to see some very classic cars in their own beauty follow by some good music from the soundtrack, then this is the movie for you.

This movie also has one of the coolest looking Mustangs (or any other car for that matter) ever made in Eleanor.  Between this movie and my die-cast model of that car, they're probably the closest I'll get to having my own Eleanor...my wife agrees.  Though I should remind her that Eleanor is a CAR...maybe that's why she didn't take too kindly to the suggestion of ""having Eleanor in my garage.""

Anyway, the storyline is decent, plausible, and not overly-done (like a Fast and Furious movie).  I like the character Cage plays, even though it's the same in most of his movies.  I really like Robert Duvall's character in this movie and he brought a lot of...what's the word...class(?), dignity(?) to this movie.  And the chase scene with Eleanor rivals the best ever done (Bullit), and personally I think it beats it.  Fun movie I don't get tired of watching over and over.

Nicholas Cage plays ""Memphis"" Range who comes out of retirement to save his misguided brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) from being killed by a sociopath black market car dealer.  The movie is full of car chases, cat and mouse cops and robbers meet-ups, and lots of excitement as Memphis has to think quick and move fast to save his brother, Kip, and keep his hard-working waitress mother from losing both her  sons.

Angelina Jolie has a small part as a top-notch mechanic.  The great Robert Duvall plays another criminal coming out of a retirement to do one last gig to save a life and keep his friend, Memphis, and family together.

1383089,4,B00004Z4WR,"I always have to shudder when I see alot of big time modern talent immersing themselves into products that were originally sub standard to begin with. This is a remake of course of the same titled /74 film which was filled with unknowns and blazed a quick and merciful path into oblivion. I usually have to put my hand over my face and peek through my fingers when I watch these things,just in case. Well I must say this solid cast with Bruckheimer in control,actually surpassed the original and in fine fashion. Released in June/00,this film did good at the box office and got fairly good reviews to boot.
The film's story starts as the brother of the famous ex-car thief(gone legit)Memphis Raines(Cage),young Kipp(Giovani Ribisi),fouls up his part in a car heist operation. The man paying him is not too happy and is having him flattened into a pancake at a scrap yard when his big brtoher Memphis shows up to bail him out. They have 72 hours to get 50 cars to save his brother and fulfil an order but in reality it will all come down to 50 cars in just one night. Raines enlists the help of his old mentor Otto(Robert Duvall) and some of his other comrades from years gone by to pull the job off.
Dogging the scheme are two cops Castlebeck(Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff(Tim Olyphant).Sometimes the two come very close to stopping the entire operation and in fact near the end it is just Raines against the duo in a spectacular chase over a blocked Golden Gate bridge. Raines escape in a /67 Shelby GT(the final car) has to be seen to be believed. However when Raines gets to his destination he is 12 minutes late and the boss rejects the car;his brother will die. A firefight ensues with the cops finally arriving to sort out the mess.
Well acted throughout and the tense atmosphere well maintained when necessary,this film just breezes by. Ribisi does a good job as Cages recalcitrant brother,Duvall is a delight as  Otto and kudos go to Delroy Lindo for his spot on portrayal of the ever-intense Detective Castlebeck. The stunt work,like alot of Bruckheimers pictures,is excellent. I couldn't help noticing that for those who saw the original that some of the background music had been changed for this directors cut edition. The one pivotal song however,Low Rider by War,was thankfully kept in. The newer music however I found doesn't detract from the movie at all but just gives it a slightly different feel.
Technically speaking this movie has been transferred well and is in a 2:35:1 a/r. Special features include:Three featurettes on the movie,the actors and its stunts,a look at the chase sequences,action scenes put to music,a music video by Cult,the trailer and a convo with Bruckheimer.
All in all a recommended movie for a weekend curled up in front of the set with a bowl of popcorn.",1296518400,,2795,4.715746421267894
1383090,3,B00004Z4WR,"As far as action movies go, ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" is a pretty good one for my tastes - a good butter-on-popcorn movie. What I'd like to alert others to is that, while this ""Director's Cut"" disc contains a number of good behind-the-scenes-type special features, the version of the actual movie that's on it is VERY different in feel from the theatrical release, which of course was the same version that was on the first release of the movie on VHS as well as on DVD. This new version uses more than a few different scene takes and different camera angles that did the theatrical release. In places, it also seems to be edited differently from the first-released version. A number of the cuts from scene to scene are different. And some scenes were cut and replaced by others. Obviously, any ""director's cut"" version of a movie, by definition, is going to be different from the original version. But if the version is THIS different, it's only fair to the customer that he/she be given viewing options. This was done in the latest release of ""The Bourne Identity"" on DVD, for example. Both the original and the new version of that movie were put on the disc, so the viewer could choose between the new version with the added or differently edited scenes, or the original version that he/she was familiar with and had enjoyed in theaters.",1275177600,8,1335,4.637130801687764

1383093,5,B00004Z4WR,"Some of you may feel like five stars is a lot for a film like `Gone in 60 Seconds'.  On most days I may agree with you.  The thing is, this film (as stupid as it may be at times) is so much fun and so incredibly watchable that I can't help but shower it with love.  Despite the fact that Nicholas Cage is one of my least favorite actors (although, shockingly, this is one of his best performances...maybe because he isn't over thinking it) this film satisfies all of my `adrenaline junkie entertainment' needs.

And then some.

I just adore this film.  I saw it quite a few times in the theater and I own it and watch it frequently.  It is one of those films that you don't need to ponder and you don't need to be in any specific mood to watch.  It won't `affect' you, but you shouldn't expect it to.

It will entertain you, period.

The film centers around two brothers, Randall and Kip.  Kip is hired to steal 50 cars for some guy, but when Kip screws up he finds himself writing his own death wish.  With no other choice, Kip yanks his more experienced brother Randall out of retirement to help him fulfill his quota.

Insert a lot of attractive cars, one major attractive woman and a lot of cool car chase scenes and you have `Gone in 60 Seconds'.

Bottom line, this film is fun.  Sure, there is better, and even in this genre there is better, but this was one of those films that really got me revved up when I was fifteen and it still continues to bring me back to that happy place.  With Ribisi, Jolie, Duvall, Lindo, Olyphant, McBride, Patton, Caan and, yes, Cage, `Gone in 60 Seconds' has a lot going for it, and it takes full advantage of that.",1271116800,,1654,4.236421725239617

1383102,4,B00004Z4WR,"Gone in 60 Seconds 2000. A car thief, Kip,in a sophisticated organized crime group makes a mistake while boosting [stealing] a car. The boss of the outfit is a ruthless murderer shipping highly expensive, rare cars overseas and wants to use the bungler Kip as an example and to bribe Memphis, Kip's brother and ex-thief with a reputation as the best to steal 50 rare and expensive cars by Friday morning at 8 AM. Memphis resists and then gives in to snatch his brother from being crushed at the salvage lot. He quickly organizes some of the old gang and some new people with unique skills plus his old girlfriend, Sway,he left when he reformed. The movie depicts the psychology of car thieves and car theft, as well as the unique psychology of the different types of experts in car stealing. It shows the loyalty to family and within a ring of thieves to each other over the law. This is contrasted with the ruthless use of money and power and threat of death by the boss to bully and bribe Memphis and the gang to carry out his high-risk scheme. The risk is heightened because the police who had tried to catch him before he reformed finds out that he is back and is once again involved in car theft. The ruthless boss lays down his terms as allowing Skip to live plus $200,000 with the stipulation that they meet the deadline exactly because that is the time the boat shipping the cars is to leave. The ring plays out the nearly impossible feat under the time pressure and while playing cat and mouse under the eye of the police. During the execution of the last heist, Memphis and his old girlfriend repair their lost love and reunite. After a harrowing last chase where Memphis shows his extraordinary skill and his determination to save his brother, he, nevertheless, winds up with the boss ordering Kip to be murdered anyway because Memphis was 12 minutes late. During a deadly tussle with the boss and his henchmen, the police suddenly enter the scene and the fracas ends with both Memphis and the police pitted against the boss. Memphis saves the policeman's life as he kills the boss. In return, the policeman, seeing Memphis has really reformed and was only back into car stealing to save his brother, decides not to arrest him. As he walks away, Memphis tells the policeman where to find the cars. The gang, having gotten together just to save Kip and for the thrill and comradery of the old car stealing days, has a parting party to celebrate the ordeal and their success, totally unconcerned with not getting the money, illustrating that this crime's appeal is its thrill which is greater even than sex.",1253145600,,2616,4.6038543897216275

1383104,3,B00004Z4WR,"First of all, I know that there are people out there that think that this movie is the absolute greatest.  It does appeal to many of the senses, but in my opinion, it lacks the makings of a classic movie.  It, however, may qualify as a sort of cult classic, but not a movie classic.

The acting is clearly back-seated to many beautiful cars, hip music, and, surprisingly, big-name actors (e.g., Cage, Jolie, Duvall).  I found the storyline to be quite predictable, as was the outcome.

You know the drill...there is an evil bad guy and developments endanger a family member of a good bad guy, thus forcing the good bad guy to bow to the evil bad guy far enough to try to save the other family member.  There is also a street-wise cop that has a history with the good bad guy, but their interactions exist primarily to provide a situation for a high speed chase that is included in the movie mainly to total as many cars of as many innocent drivers as possible.

Don't get me wrong...this kind of action movie is amazing...it's got plenty of, well, ACTION. If that's what you are after, ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" will give it to you.

If you are, however, looking for character development, a story you could watch again and again, and more that digital candy, then this movie is probably not for you.

For those reasons I give this movie 3 stars.  You'll probably enjoy watching it, but when you're done there's, alas, not much reason to watch it again.

3 stars...fun action, but it's quite predictable and then forgetable.",1240444800,,1519,4.527472527472527

1383106,3,B00004Z4WR,"OK, neither of these movies are the deep, moving, cinematic masterpieces that Halicki and Cage are both otherwise known for (are you kidding me?)

This is a car flick, period. My interest is purely my inner 14-year-old's car nuttiness coupled with my (now 36 yr old's) appreciation for awesome Mustangs; and Eleanor is one awesome hunk of steel (either the 1973 mach I OR the 1967 GT 500)

So it ain't ""Shakespeare"" as another reviewer said, it ain't supposed to be. You don't go to a strip bar looking for fine wine or to Six Flags  in search of the ultimate metaphysical meaning of life (or maybe you do, i ain't yer momma)

The reason I'm chiming in here, though, is because the reviews that have been voted to the top are for Halicki's ORIGINAL movie, shot in the early 70's (or, the remastered DVD that came out a few years ago)... NOT THIS MOVIE. THIS MOVIE is the 2000 remake with Nick Cage and Angelina Jolie. Actually, this DVD is the director's cut of that movie released in 2005.

Cage and Jolie would have had a hard time stealing tricycles in 1973, when those reviewers saw the movie they are talking about. The shocking thing is enough idiots rated these wrong reveiws all the way to the top, without anyone catching the fact that they were talking about a different flick.

Usually I am not the type of guy that loves car movies, but I love this movie. The car action is good for the most part. The scenes that are meant to garner emotion do it well. The music on this movie is perfectly done. This movie was just brilliantly put together.

Kip Raines and his crew go on a boost (high profile car theft) for 50 cars and fail miserably. Kip's old brother, Memphis Raines, is contacted about Kip's failure. Memphis soon learns that they are going to kill Kip if Memphis can't get the cars in 3 days. So on the first day he assembles a small crew of men, and a woman, to help him steal 50 cars. On the second day they find out where all the cars are. On the third and final night they are going to steal all 50 cars. You are on the edge of your seat all the time. Memphis is unsure if they are even going to make it. That is different then most movies where they are trying to be positive.

The entire time this is going on, there is a timer that keeps appearing at the bottom of the screen. It is a count down until they are out of time. Kip is played to perfection with a combination of being scared, but still wanting to help. There are so many different stories going on in this movie, and it works very well. You see why Memphis left his brother, which is really tear jerking.

One gripe I have with the entire movie is a ridiculous jump sequence. The entire movie looks fairly realistic, but near the end of the movie they added an extremely fake looking jump sequence. All the events leading up to that moment are great, but the jump is just too fake. That is the only thing that knocks this down to four stars.",1216339200,,1660,4.117283950617284

More of an ""Oceans 11"" version just as that remake is a little more palatable to families today. That isn't to say the originals aren't good classics, they are just a little rougher for some to take. The current version of this movie moves along at a steady pace and although you know the general circumstances you're never quite be sure what may happen next.

When Memphis learns of this, he comes back to town to see if he can help his brother. The only thing that will appease Calitri is if the order is fulfilled. Memphis must deliver the cars to Long Beach Harbor, Pier 14 by 8:00am, Friday morning, on the button, or watch Calitri kill Kip.

 I loved the role that Nicholas Cage played in this, he comes across as very masculine and fearless, and brave but very loving of his family, as he does what needs to be done -while being well aware of the dangers involved. In a situation (business) that requires quick reflexes and action, he knows when to be slow and calculating and I loved the scene where he stops and it seems listens to his 'intuition' (by remembering a small detail) and backs away from a trap.

Cast:  Nicholas Cage, Giovanni Ribisi, Angelina Jolie, T.J. Cross, William Lee Scott, Scott Caan, James Duval, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Timothy Olyphant.

Running Time:  117 minutes

Rated PG-13 for violence, mild sexuality and language.

""Gone in 60 Seconds"" is an energetic, slick, stylish action picture with high octane star power and lots of awesome looking automobiles. If you are a viewer interested in cars this production, by producer Jerry Bruckheimer (""Con Air,"" ""The Rock""), is worth seeing just to feast your eyes on the glossy vehicles. Although the film secretes a stench of weakness in many areas, its precise sense of action and excitement make it a moderately successful summer thrill ride.  The film stars Giovanni Ribisi (""The Mod Squad"") as a young crook named Kip Raines, who, as the movie opens, fails to deliver a long list of expensive cars to the powerful criminal Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston). When Kip's life is threatened because of such, his older brother, Randall ""Memphis"" Raines (Nicolas Cage), a retired but skillful car thief, is called upon to complete a task in exchange for his brother's survival: steel fifty cars-specified by model, color, year, and make-in only four days.  Memphis disburses the first three days recruiting a team of bandits to help him pull off the heist. The crew includes Sara ""Sway"" Wayland (Angelina Jolie), a sexy yet gruff retired car swindler knowing Memphis through previous business, a fellow named Mirror Man (T.J. Cross), the aging and wise Otto Halliwell (Robert DuVall), as well as Tumbler (Scott Caan), Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott), and Donny Astricky (Chi McBrde).

Contributing to the film's drive and tension is a subplot involving two police detectives, Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant), who suspect from previous experience that Memphis and his crew are up to no good and keep an extra close eye on them.  There is not much time for character development here; the audience gets to know these people though their rugged lifestyles and assume tough personalities through the films hard core, stylish atmosphere. To make matters even worse for the film, the dialogue fails to define the characters with a gritty cultural tone.  In spite of problems, the characters are effective due to the top notch cast performers responsible. Nicolas Cage's melodramatic performance is intense and convincing, Angelina Jolie's sleazy appearance is completely appropriate here, and Delroy Lindo is deliciously sturdy and believable. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Caan, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, and Christopher Eccleston provide persuasive supporting roles.

The film contains standard structure, with a satisfactory first act that elaborates on the story's style and the character's motives, sets up a fast-paced theme of action, but lacks depth and strong character introduction. In the second act we run into a few more problems: the story wastes time during much of this segment, never really building up for the third act. While the middle of the movie occupies much time, and a sex scene provides a solid mid-plot, not a whole lot happens. The third act is pretty much a sheer adrenaline rush containing furious wall-to-wall excitement and one of the most intense car chase sequences ever filmed.  The soundtrack to ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" contributes a great deal to the inspirational action scenes. It is scenes like the car chases that makes this movie work in spite of several destructive faults. Dominic Sena, whose career has mostly consisted of directing commercials, has an appealing style and a decisive attitude in ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" which will grant audiences with two hours of commotion, thrills, and excitement, but not much more.",1135987200,3,3798,5.266556291390729

1383149,3,B00004Z4WR,"In the VHS era, the ""extended cut"" was generally reserved for Jim Cameron films like ""Aliens"" and ""T2: Judgment Day"". They gave movie fans a chance to see elaborate sequences that were often cut due to the overly-long running times of the features. With the introduction of DVD, major studios are cashing in by putting together extended cuts of major blockbusters by throwing in some missing scenes. In some cases, the ""unrated"" cut is the version that the director intended to be seen but due to the MPAA giving it an ""NC-17"" rating, the studio is forced to hold off until home video in order to show it in its uncut form. Lately though, ""Unrated"" is just a new word thrown out to make the new version seem like it's too extreme to be shown in theatres, when it's actually just the same version with scenes included that weren't given a rating by the MPAA.

There is no guiltier pleasure than the Jerry Bruckheimer summer blockbuster. It's where music video directors go to cut their teeth in the movie industry and Oscar winners go to get their payday. 2000's remake of ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" with Bruckheimer staples Nicolas Cage and Will Patton is the ultimate celebration of all things one should associate with Bruckheimer. It's a big, loud car chase film filled with outrageous stunts, phoned-in performances, cliche characters, bad racial stereotypes, and a whole lot of noise.

""60 Seconds"" stars Nicolas Cage as retired car theif, Memphis Raines, who is forced back into the game when a cheesy mobster type (with perhaps the most annoying accent in cinema history) threatens to kill his younger brother if he doesn't steal 50 cars in one night. Along for the ride is Delroy Lindo's veteran police officer who is still stewing over the missed opportunity of arresting Raines in his ""heyday"". There's plenty of great actors standing around including Robert Duvall, Angelina Jolie, and the afore-mentioned Patton. There's also hardly a racial sterotype that the movie doesn't throw in. You've got the Asian girl who can't drive, the Mexican car-jackers protecting their turf, and T.J. Cross as the ""token black guy"" who knows he's the token black guy and won't shut up about it. Still despite it all, I'd be lying if I said this movie isn't watchable.

This extended version is released as the ""director's cut"" so one can assume director Dominic Sena put his stamp of approval on this one. You might think that with a luxury like this, he would have included a few more character moments but in fact, the strongest such moment in the theatrical cut, a sequence with Nicolas Cage and Giovani Risbi has actually been removed and replaced with an alternate scene that is far less powerful. For its ""nine minutes of added footage"", there are a few subtle differences but nothing worth writing home about. As for its ""Unrated"" tag, if this cut were submitted to the MPAA, it would more than likely receive the same PG-13 rating as the theatrical version. If you already own this movie on DVD, it's not really worth the upgrade.",1120867200,5,3027,4.783938814531549
1383150,4,B00004Z4WR,"A lot of people say that the 1974 version of this movie was better, filled with more action & had raw feel about it. True. But I wasn't growing up then, hence the cars, the actors & the scenes were not from my generation & so I like the new one.

Besides the above the ""Elenor"" Car chase scene was 40 minutes in the original & only 20-odd minutes in this one which is a good thing because today's fickle audience will not sit through 40 minutes run-around leave alone anything else.

Nicolas Cage did a pretty convincing job as ""Memphis"" a car thief who does it for the thrill & because allegedly the cars beg to be stolen & not for gain or glory. Nobel eh! Modern day Robin Hood.

The lovely Angelina Jolie had a miniscule role in this movie -more eye candy than anything else- & did not actually contribute but she's still lovely isn't she?

I was told by a friend that I am not a ""real chase movie watchers"" well, thank God is what I say. If I led such a monotonous life I would surely die. Besides that's what PS2 is for - harebrained car chases that can last longer than 8 to 10 hours.

Verdict: Overall I think the movie struck a decent balance between remaking a classic & living in the moment. A good movie to watch over & over again-ish.

Rating: 4 stars for a creditable performance & being as true as possible to the original without loosing any integrity.",1120521600,,1367,4.258687258687258
1383151,4,B00004Z4WR,"When I first heard about this movie I wasn't sure if I would want to see it.  I mean a movie that basically sounds like a storyline right out of the ""Grand Theft Auto"" video game series doesn't sound like a promising film.  So, I didn't go to see it in theaters, even though I saw that it was doing solid numbers at the box office and had good reviews from people going to see it, though the critics thought this movie was garbage, everyday society thought it was a great caper movie.

""Gone In 60 Seconds"" is an incredibly fast-paced thrill ride that will leave you breathless.  The movie begins with Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi) attempting to boost 50 cars before a deadline that is four days away.  One of the cars he boosts from a dealership causes him to be chased by police and he inadvertently leads the police directly to the warehouse where numerous other cars out of the 50 are being stashed.  Needless to say, the police cease the cars and Kip is now in a life or death predicament that he cannot escape.  Enter Kip's older brother, Randall ""Memphis"" Raines (Nic Cage), Memphis is a legend of car-boosting who after numerous run-in's with the police walked away from his life of crime and seemingly all of his family and friends without looking back.  Now Memphis must return to save his brother by boosting 50 cars in what is left of the original timetable established for his brother, which leaves Memphis 3 days to assemble a team and boost the cars before his brother dies.

A surprisingly good storyline and script, with excellent actors chosen to flesh out the parts, ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" rises above the mediocrity it should have been destined for.  Most movies of this type would have had a hip, young cast that were essentially newcomers to acting and it would have been average, but thanks to super-movie producer Jerry Bruckheimer (producer of ""The Rock"" and ""Armageddon""), the movie gets the A-list casting treatment with the likes of Nic Cage, Angelina Jolie (looking good even in dreadlocks), Giovanni Ribisi, and Robert Duvall.  If you are a fan of films like ""The Fast and The Furious"" or even the lackluster sequel ""2 Fast 2 Furious"", or even the original ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" that this film is based on, then you shouldn't miss this extremely entertaining movie.  By the way, this review is for the ""Gone In 60 Seconds: Director's Cut"", though I have to admit that I hadn't watched the theatrical version in some time so I'm not sure what was changed in the film, but I recommend getting the director's cut for any film just so you get the movie as it was originally intended to be.

I dare anyone to watch any of the previous mentioned and be able to count to six before the camera cuts.  It's impossible.  Once you realize 4.9 seconds is the limit of a hold in a shot, (For me anyway) it becomes almost impossible to watch.  Similar to watching a strobe light.  Is it possible that it is cheaper to make productions this way or could it be a sinister plot to shorten viewer attention spans?  In either case this movie is worse than watching a blank screen.  It's so bad that I no longer like Nick Cage. After I started watching, I was ""Gone in about 18 minutes.""",1116633600,3,795,4.2885906040268456

In other words, it's a marketing ploy.  Yes, this version is slightly different from the one previously released -- this one has all the deleted scenes re-inserted, so the film runs a few minutes longer.  But there's nothing in it that wouldn't get another PG-13 if they re-submitted it.

1383155,2,B00004Z4WR,"Yes, I know. Its sad that I would devote so much thought to a thoroughly forgettable film.

Jerry Bruckheimer makes a certain kind of film. He makes films that are widely seen because they are the equivalent of an 'easy read'. People go to his films because they want to see a bunch of people break into Alcatraz or because they want to see a bunch of convicts save a plane or destroy an asteroid before it hits Earth. They are loud, slickly produced films full of explosions and action. They ARE the Summer Film. Most of these films are enjoyable in a rudimentary sort of way. It is the truly memorable films of summer that go beyond these formulas. Unfortunately, ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" doesn't even live up to the Bruckheimer standards.

I have some questions about the film, well, 60 questions, and some thoughts about each of the questions.

1. Why was the movie made?

When a production company becomes as big, as well-known, and as important to the studio footing the bill, as Bruckheimer's company is to Disney, they have to produce films on a regular basis just to keep the cash coming in. I am sure that everyone involved anticipated that this film would be a huge hit, causing buckets of cash to fall from the sky.

2. Why did Academy Award winner Nicholas Cage make this movie?

3. Why did Academy Award winner Anjelina Jolie make this movie?

4. Why did Academy Award winner Robert Duval make this movie?

It's the cash, stupid. Cage makes about $20 million per picture. Jolie and Duval probably made a mint as well. They've got mortgages just like everyone else.

5. Why is Cage's character called 'Memphis' when he is from Long Beach, CA?

6. Why is Jolie's character called 'Sway'?

7. Why is Vinnie Jone's character called 'Sphinx'?

Only the screenwriter, Scott Rosenberg, can answer these questions. The answers certainly aren't in the story. In Rosenberg's last film, 'Con Air', many of the characters had nicknames, but we learned why they had those nicknames. At least Duval's nickname is 'Otto'. That makes sense.

8. After his brother, played by Giovanni Ribisi, fumbles a car theft, causing Cage to come out of retirement to save him, why does Cage agree to let Ribisi and his friends join the crew?

Their great track record?

9. Why is their Cajun music playing over the credits?

The main characters are from Long Beach. It makes perfect sense. Of course. Cajun music.

10. Why is so much of the daylight action shot with brown filters?

It makes the entire film look muddy. Great idea, guys.

11. Why is Christopher Eccleston's villain British?

Yes, I know the actor is British, but there is no reason for the character to be. Watch the very good, but very depressing 'Jude' or the simply great 'Shallow Grave' to see how good this actor can be. And then, wonder aloud why he decided to appear in this film.

12. Why is it so easy for Cage and his crew to steal cars?

Most of these scenes are interesting, but not suspenseful. Because they only have difficulty grabbing a small number of the 50 cars, everything appears easy. The suspense is gone.

13. Because of #12, the climatic car chase is predictable. Why?

Because everything else is so easy, naturally something will go wrong with the last car. There is no suspense anywhere. In the entire film.

14. Why is the actual climax so boring?

Because it has been done hundreds of times before.

15. Why is the only sex scene between Cage and Jolie less erotic than the two lovers that they are watching at the time?

It's the chemistry, stupid. There isn't any.

16. Why is Delroy Lindo's character driving a Cadillac and then a BMW while undercover?

Not exactly standard police issue.

17. Why are we introduced to Frances Fisher's character at all?

She has literally one line. She also pops up in the background twice.

18. Grace Zabriskie played Cage's mother?

Yes. At least her one scene had some point in the story.

Okay, so I'm not actually going to ask 60 questions about the movie. The movie attempted to live up to about a third of its promise, so I think it is acceptable for me to live up to a third of mine. It promised a lot of car chases, it has two. It promised interesting characters, it has none.

If I really went to the trouble of listing 60 questions, and you read them, we are each devoting far too much time to a film that will live up to its title in more ways than one.",1113264000,,4379,4.533757961783439

It is definitely *not* a car film; the 3 Oscar winners/nominees ""starring"" in it are absolutely terrible (and wasted) in it. The customized Shelby is ugly - and they wasted 14 classic Mustangs shooting this film (you don't even get to see the great majority of the cars the gang is assigned to steal). This is the kind of sugar-coated action film Nicholas Cage wastes himself on to make a lot of quick bucks at our expense. He can do a lot better. Entertainment Weekly rated it the 5th worst film of 2000!",1111190400,,568,4.419047619047619

1383158,3,B00004Z4WR,"Let's face it... this movie is one of those box-office hits of the month. While this movie is surely popular with sports car enthusiasts nation wide, there is relatively no real drama anywhere in the film. This was a definitive characteristic of the original ""Gone in 60 Seconds,"" only the car chase in it was much more entertaining... and much longer. And although there is not one single dynamic character in the entire film... that's not really the point, is it?

The point is that with a big enough budget, some big-name actors, and action producer Capo Jerry B., people are going to be entertained. There are actually some exciting car chases, as well as some interesting cop and robber interaction. However, the plot driven narative makes for plenty of tongue in cheek moments, albeit taken with a grain of salt.

At the end of the day, ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" might keep your attention long enough to realize that you should have just watched ""The Rock,"" Jerry B. and Nic Cage's action packed masterpiece. Nevertheless... this film is not bad. The movie is fun, and the cars really do make your mouth water; I was definitely convinced by Eleanor, as well as her little red button.

In the end, there is one huge problem with the film... the Lamborghini Diablo has minimal screen time... come on people!!! I know they had the car rented long enough to give it some decent screen time and maybe a car chase or two... but nooooooo; just Nic stealing the car and driving away, and that is it. It's such a crying shame. If you want get a good look at a Diablo, as well as see one in action, watch ""Bedazzled.""

I only recommend buying this movie under three different circumstances. One: in one of those cheap two packs... Two: used at a dirt cheap price... Three:  the next time it appears in a Sunday newspaper ad or on Amazon.com for less than 10 dollars.",1102291200,,1857,4.564564564564565
1383159,2,B00004Z4WR,"What in concept seems to be a good movie, eventually turns out to be a bad investment. Nicholas Cage is Memphis Raynes, a man renowned all over the region as the best car-jacker ever. Only now, he is retired from his criminal past and has a legitimate garage business. When his sorry-for-a-brother gets involved with a car smuggler who vows to kill him, Memphis must save him by agreeing to jack 50 rare top class cars in a very short span of time. If he fails to deliver all the cars in pristine condition within the stipulated time, his brother would eventually die (I wish he would).

This premise is enough to describe this total hash of a movie. Memphis gathers his old team of ex-cons and together they set out on this ridiculous journey. I call it ridiculous because the way the movie was made is cheezy and with production values like this, a B-rated movie has greater dignity. At no point in the movie can you relate to the characters in anyway whatsoever. Angelina Jolie is just a bundle of looks, but has absolutely no role in the movie, save for a kiss!. The humour is dry and out of context most of the time as is the timing of some sequences. What bothers me is that in these type of movies, the protagonists never fear for the worst i.e they don't worry somebody might die and they show a sense of coolness which is misplaced. Robert Duvall as Cage's mentor is a saving grace who manages to bring some shine into an otherwise lacklustre plot. In a movie where all the guys are supposedly cool criminals, the director tries to show sentimental brotherly love b/w two protagonists, but ends up bringing you a good anaesthetic. The rest of the actors need not be mentioned. There aren't any 'actors' except the cop.

The only reason this movie might deserve a 2 star is for its cars. Some are beautiful, but most of the movie is dark in picture, thus casting a gloomy picture  on everything.  The scene where Cage 'talks' to a car is rather funny. (Funny as in, crazy !). Dominic Sena, who gave us Swordfish, was probably in a bad mood when he created this one. Only the last car chase is pretty memorable, if not for the car, which Sena did not create !.

Overall, avoid it if you can. It is not the same as the cult classic of the same name that was released in 1974. If you really want to see a good car chase movie that is both authentic and jaw-dropping, watch Ronin or Vanishing Point. Both are uber classics any enthusiast shouldn't miss. Only if you are out of options and don't have anything else to watch, then watch Gone in 60 Seconds......for just 60 sceonds!.",1099008000,3,2584,4.420168067226891
1383160,5,B00004Z4WR,"This is the movie before Fast and the Furious where we first saw all these sweet cars. You can tell most of the reviewers have seen Fast and Furious so they are comparing this movie to that which it is not. It does have its stupid humor to it but what action movie doesn't once in a while? Everyone already explained the plot so i'm not going to put you through that, what i will say is that it is definately one to check out. Not as good as Fast and the Furious since that movie wrecked any greatness we could expect from this movie (sorry but yes, it makes gone in 60 seconds sub par).

The last car chase/rescue scene, however, is pure dynamite, with some exciting car driving and tension when Cage goes after Eccleston.  However, getting there isn't quite as exciting.  Director Dominic Sana (Swordfish) keeps things rather lethargic early on, and wastes the talents of Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall in thankless roles.  Nicolas Cage gives his sincere, stoney eyed macho performance, and actors like Scott Caan, Delroy Lindo, Timothy Olyphant and Giovanni Ribisi do well, but this film doesn't rely so much on character development as the cars.  Nice vintage cars, too!  A purely adrenaline/testosterone film, and not one of the best, but the ending is worth the wait!",1095206400,,776,5.2682926829268295
1383162,2,B00004Z4WR,"This is just one of those predictable dumbed down action movies that leaves you wondering why you just spent 2 hours watching it. The only good thing about this movie is Angelina Jolie is in it. If you are a big Angelina fan you may as well buy it if you see if for real cheap (like 5.99) because there are a healthy amount of extras including interviews with Angelina.

But this is just a seen 1 seen em all type movie. I find Nicolas Cage REALLY annoying in this movie although I am a fan of his but I prefer him in dramas and not cheesey action flicks like this.

The plot is ok on paper but the dialogue/script is really poor and you just know exactly how this movie will pan out and how it will end....so predictable. The cops were really annoying, especially the young detective...he tried ever so hard to be the cocky/funny type cop that can sometimes be interesting but like everything else in this movie it just fell flat.

Vinnie Jones' character was the only mildly interesting character in this film and he doesn't even speak!!! He used to be a soccer player here in England, he was a really dirty, aggressive player so its no wonder he plays a lot of bad guys in his movies.

If you like cheesey, flat, predictable action flicks then this is right up your street, some of the car chases are pretty cool but its not quite as thrilling watching these in your bedroom as a pose to a cinema is it?

1383163,4,B00004Z4WR,"""Gone in 60 Seconds"" exists for one purpose: to show off some of the hottest cars in existence. The storyline is kind of hokey, but the cars more than make up for it, especially the GT 500. The car chase at the end is one of the best ever filmed! All the actors (Especially Robert Duvall, who can never give a bad performance) do fine in their roles. All in all, ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" is a one @#*& of a ride!
Also, don't miss Christopher Eccleston (plays the villain, Raymond Vincent Calitri, in this film) this January, when he resurrects one of the greatest characters of all time, the Doctor, in BBC's new ""Doctor Who"" series. BBC plans to send it to American TV stations as well.

Jolie is Academy Award material and she hardly does anything in this movie.  Gage is a master, this movie was a waste of what he's capable of doing, but I guess he's a good draw.  I actually saw this at the theater when it came out and a second time recently.

(This film apparently did entertain a majority of the people who saw it, judging by the reviews here.)But a director, an editor,and actors must back it up. Well, one out of three aint gonna get it. The actors do their part,and what a great cast. But direction and editing (esp.editing) kill this film for me.
  Let me give the biggest and most continuous example:

All that said, I really did enjoy watching the movie, although I had no doubt as to the resolution of the existential dilemma presented to Nick, given the fact he is the most worthy of the anti-heroes in recent memory, a good ""bad"" guy we root for from the very start. And he does have a special woman, (no, not the sexy Angelina Jolie, although she is sweet indeed) by the way of his special personal vehicle, a super-charge mustang he refers to by name, and seems to have male-female kind of bond with.

What was disappointing about this film was that Angelina Jolie didn't exactly have a big role, or as much screen-time as Nicolas Cage or Giovanni Ribsi. She's one of my favourite actresses, and I suppose that was the only reason I wanted to see the film. Although seeing Giovanni Ribsi didn't hurt.
It took a long time to start, and the storyline was supposed to be that Nicolas Cage's character (Memphis) had to steal 50 cars in 4 days. By the time the film dragged out, he only had one night to steal them all. And it was so predictable how one of the cars would be ""late"" being stolen, or would get held up.

1383168,2,B00004Z4WR,"My opinion hasn't changed much since I first saw this in Summer 2000. It's still an increasingly tedious no-brainer that has very little in the way of excitement or thrills.
I had hopes that it could be a rival to Con Air as Nic Cage and Bruckheimer made good with that movie but with GI60S there are no huge set pieces or ever-escalating chaos. Cage's character is lifeless and is poorly motivated. The villain is probably the most unscariest bad guy since the big rubber shark in Jaws 4. And the rest of the supporting cast are put to no use, included Angelina Jolie who is totally wasted in a role that means nothing. Robert Duvall, Giovanni Ribisi and Vinnie Jones are also put to no use.
That's another problem with the movie. There are far, far too many extraneous characters who do nothing to complicate the simple plot in any slight way.
Dominic Sena's direction mimics Michael Bay (who was already mimicking the Brothers Scott) and gives us that highly polished Jerry Bruckheimer shine. IE It's always sundown in long beach and when it's not the night is filled with neon signs.
Trevor Rabin, who made great music for Con Air and Armageddon, does a very bad job with the score. There are a few moments of what could have been something very cool but he takes the easy way out and scores GI60S with nothing but noises and musical chaos that matches the quick cuts and flashes (that passes for editing) onscreen.
The car chases (precious few as there are) do not entertain. The final showdown between Cage and Delroy Lindo (also wasted) quickly induces yawns and glances at the clock. And why did the final stunt have to be CGI? Real stunts would have been so much better.

Like the others you are trated to an opening few mintes of car action, followed by 90 minutes of actors shuffling around with not much muttering something about i gotta do this for my ""brudder"" and then a final fairly decent car chase.  The thing is - unlike the original which is a much better and honest movie done on a show string budget, this one hypes with the promis of exotic cars at speand.  Ferraris, Jaguars, Lambos etc.  Know how fast you get to see a Lambo going? About 3mph as it backs up down a driveway.  Know how fast you see the Jaguar 220 go? Who knows it looks like it was pushed into the camera fram by extras on the set - I don't even think the motor was running.  Ferraris?  the only time you see them is when the theifs enter a ware house - you never actullay see them driven. You never get to see any of the exotic cars driven.

It was meant to be an exciting action movie with impressive stunts.  Starring Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Giovanni Ribisi, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, the movie boasts an impressive cast that is underused.  Still the movie is great at what it set out to do.  The car chases are some of the best since Bullit.
 The plot is a simple one.  Memphis Raines, a famous car booster, has to steal 50 exotic cars or else his kid brother(Giovanni Ribisi) will get taken out by a mob boss.  It isn't the deepest plot but it works in this movies.  Memphis(Nicolas Cage) puts together a team to help him steal the cars.  Obviously the plan doesn't go perfectly as Memphis and crew run into rival boosters, police chasing after them, and the ever elusive ""Eleanor,"" Memphis' unicorn.
 Gone in 60 Seconds is a fun movie to watch with good performances, exciting action sequences, and an awesome soundtrack.

1383182,1,B00004Z4WR,"It might occur to you that i didn't like this film a lot.
What's happened here is called ""completely missing the point.""
This is a remake for which there was even less need than there is for most remakes.
The original film isn't much, and, in objective cinematic terms, it's not very good.  Technical production values are abysmal, and the acting is worse.
Despite that, the original succeeds admirably at what it set out to do -- wreck a lot of cars and show a clever crook Getting Away With It.  And showcase some Incredible stunt driving -- the final stunt is unbelievable.  And it's real.
Right off the bat, the remake suffers because someone decided that the hero couldn't be Only In It For The Money, so we get the ridiculous plot gimmick of his being blackmailed back into crime after going straight.  This one can work, but it takes a slight amount of intelligence to make it work.  And that sin't on display here.
Next mistake was to decide that the film needed a Plot.  And a Love Interest.  Only plot this story needs is ""got to steal 'X' cars by Tuesday and we can't find one of them.""  Again -- for the money, not becuase he's nobly risking his own life and freedom to save his brother.
Third mistake is introducing an Evial Villain.  Not needed.
Fourth mistake is making the hard-to-find car something exotic and rare; in the original film, the Mustang Mach One they were trying to find seemed to be, at the time, nearly as common as VW Beetles, and not being able to find one was a running gag. (I remember the period -- i didn't go a day without seeing one or two.)
Fifth mistake is not using a real one, anyway.  The car in the film is a fibreglass body which sort of resembles the GT500 it's supposed to be -- or rather, looks like what a GT500 would have looked like if the original designer had had the good taste to consult this film's art director.
Sixth mistake is the fact that -- even if it were real -- the car isn't nearly original anymore, and anyone who specified a specific year of GT500 is going to want Original.  The paint is nothing like the original, and it's fitted with a nitrous system -- putting something like that on a 427 side oiler in the degree of build-up that Ol' Shel and his gnomes put into the GT500 is inviting an under-hood explosion.
Seventh Solecism is that, even if it looked real, and even if it looked original, the car either has Chrysler running gear under it, or the sound men used the sound of a Chrysler-powered vehicle (a number of people have identified the sound of the starter as being a Chizzler product.)
Eigth Error is that they spend more time on their idiot plot than they do on the Chase.  And that's exactly backward of what made the original film so good.  And the chase they do sort of show is made up of isolated and un-connected stunts that don't gel together as a chase.
And the Ninth and Biggest Horrible Thing is faking The Jump.  Given the apparent location and setup of The Sort Of Jump in this film, i'm sure it either had to be wholly or partially faked with CGI or else was done with an empty car.
In the original, Halicki himself actually rode that thing, jumping it high over four ""wrecked"" cars in the middle of the road.  As we watch it in slow motion, we can see the whole body of the car flex and twist as it hits the ground, see the tires spinning and burning as he fights for control...
In this ""remake"", we sort of see what's maybe a car fly through the air in a shot that really doesn't give us a very good view.
Pass this up; watch the original.
It's sad -- if they had done anything like a real remake, Cage would have been perfect for the part.
Oh, well.  At least the original is available.",1033948800,2,3688,4.3154848046309695

Nicholas cage is great in the movie... and the action parts with the cars are awesome... I love the relationship between memphis and sway.... and sphinx is a really cool character also...the one and only thing that i do have that i didn't like about it was the part when he jumps over all the cars on the bridge.... the cgi didn't look too good, but other than that the movie is excellent.... and the car chase at the end with elenor wasn't as boring as the car chase in the original..... the soundtrack is also a plus to this.... you should also check out the dvd.... its got some really cool extra stuff on it....",1032998400,2,883,4.2
1383184,2,B00004Z4WR,"THE STORY: Kip Ranes has become what his brother Memphis (Cage) was: a car thief. As he messes up a boost he is caputerd by his employee Calitri. If he doesn't steal 50 cars in 72 hours for him, he has to die. So Kip has to get help from brother Memphis to do the impossible task that will save his life.
THE CAST: Academy Award Winners Nicolas, Cage, Robert DuVall and Angelina Jolie are joined by a supporting cast including Giovanni Ribisi, Timothy Olyphant, Will Patton and Delroy Lindo. These names make a lot of moviegoers happy.  But unfortunately they all waste their talent, trying to give dimension to their cardboard characters and almost all of them fail. Except for Delroy Lindo whose Detective Kasselbeck is the most likable characters off them all, even though he is pursuing our ""hero"" Nicolas Cage. Somehow I wanted him to get Memphis and that sure as hell wasn't the intention. But Cages character is so flat that he can wave his hands around all he wants, he is just not really likeable and the love to his brother is unconvincing and unemotional so I didn't really cared for those two. Angelina Jolie does what he needs to do: Trying to look sexy and tough with stupid hairdo. But she's only trying.
THE SCRIPT: The script by Scott ""Con Air"" Rosenberg seems to me like it was written in a short time under a lot of pressure. I can't come up with another reason which justifies this script without insulting him. One of the major problems, and there are many of them, is that the ""funny"" lines are anything but funny and the way the black people are portrayed is really clichd and annoying. Also the script does a big build up, so that you anticipate a great showdown but it never really comes...
DIRECTING: Dominic Sena does have an eye for beautiful lighting and that's about everything I think is worth mentioning here. The (few) action sequences are extremly bad edited and slow paced that you feel more like a spectator than a driver. The beautiful cars are shown too short and the transition between scenes often disrupts the rythm of the film and literally activates the breaks. Even the final car chase, which I was waiting for the whole boring 90 minutes is a major dissapointment because it lacks the most important thing: Speed... The climactic jump of Cages (CGI)Car is nothing more than laughable and unrealistic (which in this case, other than in a James Bond-type movie, hurts)
THE DVD: Sound and picture quality are top notch and the extra features rather interesting. It shows how many efforts were made, which made me feel sad because the end result could have been much more

I guess I have a problem with movies that are totally unrealistic, unless they go out of there way to profess that they are unrealistic. The Evil Kinevil car jump scene is one of these that defies logic. There is plenty of action, if that is your thing. However, if you are expecting a movie that will leave an impression on you, then you will be very disappointed.",1026432000,,565,4.4423076923076925
1383190,4,B00004Z4WR,"...and here's why! While Cage is, in my mind at least, fairly decent at romantic comedy (a genre I love), ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" proves that he can carry off action roles with a certain surpising panache. From the moment Cage's character flicks his collar ""Fonz-style"" in front of a full-length mirror and says (in his trademark low/long/quiet voice), ""I'm a baaaaad man,"" you know you are in for some great moments.
I'm usually not a fan of action flicks. So when a friend suggested I watch this, I was expecting the usual high-octane, blow-something-up-and-drive-away-at-eighty-MPH-laughing-your-head-off fare. But ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" is... well... a little different. Cage plays Randall ""Memphis"" Raines, a car thief gone straight, who is forced to return to his life of crime when his brother, Kip runs afoul of a local gang boss. Raines' choice is simple: Return to his old life for one last job, or watch his brother get squished to death in a car crusher. No-brainer right? The catch? The job looks impossible -- steal 50 rare classic luxury cars and drive them all onto a tanker, and do it before the ship sails in 72 hours! Forced to choose between certain death for the brother he gave up the passion of his life to protect, and doing the impossible Cage makes the Hollywood-obvious choice and accepts the challenge, enlisting the help of his brother's car-thief cronies, and his old crew (which include both Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall).
This movie, action aside, is essentially about the question, ""To what lengths will you go for family?"" And Cage, while expertly playing the cool, hard-bitten thief on the outside, manages to show us the warmth, and depth of dedication Memphis really holds for his brother. As such, ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" while being chock full of heart-pounding, demolition-derby thrills, is at the same time a very thought-provoking film. Although not recommended for the younger set (Parents, if you must let your 0-10 year-olds watch this DVD, do yourselves a favor: watch it with them, and skip track 21.) it is an extremely well-done film. To everyone disappointed with the quality of this film (and there have been many) I say, ""Watch it again. You didn't look closely enough.""
So, does Memphis pull it off? You'll have to buy it and see.",1024012800,,2279,4.891472868217054
1383191,3,B00004Z4WR,"The good thing about ""Gone In Sixty Seconds"" is that with all the action going on, you won't remember that the leads in this movie - Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, and Robert Duvall - have at least three acting Oscars between them. At some point, you might realize that these great actors have absolutely nothing to do, but - hey! - it's another car chase, some hot car, gratuitous voyeur sex, or some rockin' tune to distract you.
Like I said, that might be a good thing, especially when Duvall's character says a local crime lord is ""tearing at the soft underbelly of our fair city."" It's a long way from Tom Hagen or Colonel Kilgore, but Duvall is such a pro that he pulls it off, as do the rest of the leads.
This is strictly a by-the-numbers action flick, but it's well executed, and it's first rate eye candy. In particular, the climactic car chase involving a '67 Shelby Mustang is a dandy, and Cage drives it pretty convincingly (he's a car buff in real life).
There's no character development to speak of, the dialogue gets pretty hammy from time to time, and some of the action (particularly a scene where Cage & Co. steal cars from the police impound lot) is laughably implausible, but ""Gone In Sixty Seconds"" is indeed a good time, and worth a view or two.",1023753600,,1267,4.4655172413793105
1383192,4,B00004Z4WR,"Terrific fast-paced car-chase movie with a good soundtrack and memorable characters.
Nicolas Cage plays a reformed car thief (Memphis Raines) who gets sucked back in to do one last job to save his brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi).  Memphis, and his band of former ""boosters"" plus the next generation of boosters (Kip's friends) must steal 50 classic and exotic cars before a 72 hour deadline is up.  They decide to do it in one night, because by the time ""the heat is on to you, your ship has already sailed.""
This movie is filled with great visuals of some pretty cool cars, and solid performances by Cage, Angelina Jolie, and Robert Duvall.  The final chase is something that hasn't been seen since Steve McQueen's ""Bullitt,"" and the scene in which Cage cases a Ferrari dealership is one that I continue to play over and over to hear one line:  ""You would not be a self-indulgent wiener, sir.  You'd be a connoisseur.""
The DVD's extra features consisted of the usual stuff:  Theater trailers, teasers, interviews with cast and crew, music videos, etc.  What truly would have been cool would have been a section that gives 2 or 3 paragraphs on each of the 50 cars that were on the list to steal.

But it's elevated above the staple car chase limitations by Nicholas Cage and Giovanni Ribisi. The female lead however, Angelina Jolie, is wasted in this film, with nothing much to do except look sexy.
It's a Jerry Bruckheimer film, so it does have a fair amount of cool car chases and big noisy things exploding. But this, unlike Bruckheimer's other films (The Rock, Con Air, Armaggedeon) is somewhat short of any really good car chases. And director Dominic Sena (Swordfish) wastes most of the time on boring sub-plots instead of what the audience really wants: action.
In short, if you're looking for a brainless entertaining flick with ""that Tomb Raider chick"" then this is the film for you. But if what you want is a film with cool cars and really great action, check out The Fast and the Furious instead.",1019001600,,945,4.698795180722891
1383195,1,B00004Z4WR,"Producer Jerry Bruckheimer is one of the most successful people in the movies. He has a formula for action pictures which has been as successful as it has been critic proof. He's the man behind such blockbusters as ConAir, The Rock and Armageddon. Gone in 60 Seconds is his latest production, and even by Bruckheimer standards, it's run-of-the-mill. To his credit, I imagine Mr. B. is the only producer on the planet who could get away with spending [that much money] on a remake of a low budget 1974 movie, but that's exactly what Gone in 60 Seconds is.
Memphis Raines [Nicholas Cage] used to be the top auto thief in Los Angeles. When his mother told him his brother Kip [Giovanni Ribisi] was going to turn out just like him, he did the right thing. [""I didn't do it for the money I did it for the cars!"", he exclaims.] He moves to a small town and opens a go-cart track. Well, wouldn't you know it? Kip turns out just like Memphis anyway. Now Kip has made an enemy of Raymond Calitri [Christopher Eccleston], a lowdown Brit who seems to control the grand theft auto market in LA. Raymond gives Memphis a choice: Either steal fifty cars in seventy-two hours or stand by while Kip is whacked. Memphis rounds up some of his old crew. These include his old mentor Freb [Robert Duvall] and his old flame Sara [Angelina Jolie]. Meanwhile, police detective Castlebeck {Delroy Lindo], who regrets he didn't nail Memphis years ago, gets wind of the plan and attempts to stop it. Memphis finds himself squeezed into the middle between the law and the lawless.
The story goes from the preposterous to the absurd and back again, but in a Bruckheimer movie, story always takes a back-seat to action. The problem here is that most the action isn't all that exciting. It's rather soulless, with one predictable event following another in a sort of paint by numbers fashion. There is one very well done car chase, but one such scene in this kind of movie is hardly sufficient.
Gone in 60 Seconds has three Oscar winning actors among its stars. Sometimes in an otherwise mindless movie, this is a bonus, but not in this case. Nicholas Cage has no character development. He's essentially the same guy he was in ConAir. Angelina Jolie has a very small role, despite the fact she gets second billing. Robert Duvall gets to say a lot of inane dialog with a straight face. These are not stars doing their acting thing. These are three stars just working for a living. I am sure they were paid most sufficiently. They were cast simply as part of the Bruckheimer formula, which says that you've got to have a big name or two above the title.

1383211,4,B00004Z4WR,"Basic storyline:  Little Kip (Ribisi) botches a 50-car boost and his big brother Memphis (Cage) comes to the rescue.  They steal a bunch of really nice cars, including a 67 Shelby GT at the end.
If you can suspend reality a bit, the movie is fun.  It's tough to watch with my boyfriend because he is always pointing out how unrealistic everything is.  I saw the movie for what it is:  Pure fun.  It's not an Oscar type movie that is supposed to provoke deep thoughts.
My problems with it - 1) Angelina Jolie was not in it enough.  2) I'm not a fan of Ribisi and his character seemed like a whiny little baby the entire movie.  3) I had to make myself ignore the zillions of unrealistic things that happened (ie:  the helicopter flying 15 feet off the ground chasing the Shelby GT).
Basically it's a fun flick to watch if you like pretty cars, but people who are very analytical about movies will probably hate it.",1009238400,,913,4.355029585798817
1383212,4,B00004Z4WR,"Ok then. Let's just get a few things straight first of all.
1: This is not going to sweep the oscars.
2: This will not wow audiences with its phenominal script.
 Do you know why that is?... It's because this wasn't made for that! It's not that type of movie. This is an all out fun movie (or as some of us like to call them ""popcorn movies!"")
 So, heres my advise. You buy this movie, slap it in, turn the lights out, sit back, relax, turn up your dolby surround sound system and just enjoy it!
 I just wish that critcs would stop jugding these movies for something they'r not! They'r not all going to have great acting and scripts. So long as they excite and entertain the audience WHO CARES!? I don't think that there was much wrong with the acting in this, yeah some of the script was a bit cheesy but it's all part of the fun!
 Hope you all enjoy it!",1008720000,,854,4.126506024096385

And I think that it deserves more recognition. The film doesnt have the best acting, but the acting don't have to be Academy Award calibar. I mean its all about the action, the cars, and don't forget ... Angelina Jolie!
The film is about once legend car thief Randal ""Memphis"" Reins (Nicholas Cage), who, after going straight, must go back into the game in order to save his young brother ""Kip"" Reins (Giovanni Ribisi, Saving Private Ryan), one last time. He must steal 50 cars in 24 hours! With his old crew, Sway (Angelina Jolie, Girl Interrupted), (Robert Duvall, The Godfather I & II) and Hatley (Will Patton, Armageddon). Along with his new crew including his kid brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) and Tumbler (Scott Caan), along with many other stars.
This film is action from start to finish, and has a lot of real classic cars. Like the 69 Bearacuda and the 67 Shelby GT 500, this movie is destined to be a classic. And nothing outbeats hearing this on your DVD surround sound kit! If you want to see good action, good acting, and great car chases see Gone in 60 Seconds. You will not be disappointed.

1383215,5,B00004Z4WR,"Gone in 60 Seconds is one of those wonderful movies that really makes you wish you were doing something else with your life. In the same way that Top Gun made you want to become a fighter pilot, Gone in 60 Seconds will have you contemplating taking part in some serious grand theft auto. Which, in retrospect, is perhaps not such a good thing.
Nicolas Cage is Randall ""Memphis"" Raines, a retired car thief persuaded to come back for one last boost to get his younger brother Kip out of trouble with the local gangsters. His objective is to steal fifty cars in just one night, including his unicorn; a 1967 Ford Mustang named Eleanor which he has never been able to get away with before. It's not long before he has assembled his old gang (along with a few new members) and they begin to work out how exactly they are going to pull this off. Pursuing them every step of the way is grizzled Detective Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and a gang of rival car thieves angered that Raines got the big job instead of them.
The cast is large and varied. Nicolas Cage (The Rock, Con Air) is perfectly at home as Memphis Raines, at first reluctant to take on the job but gradually warming to his old life. As he brushes off his old car-stealing gear and holds up his leather jacket, he says with a touch of vanity and self-mockery, ""I am a ba-ad man.""
Angelina Jolie (Tomb Raider) is the token love interest Sway, who is included in the group because she's an expert with Ferrari's. In reality, she doesn't really do much except stand around and pout quite a lot.
Former soccer hard man Vinnie Jones (Snatch) is the silent but hard-as-nails Sphinx. Although he only actually says one sentence at the end of the film, his mere presence provides some great moments. Note his reaction when he finds a dog has eaten his car keys.
Robert Duvall (Falling Down, Sixth Day), as old mechanic Otto, brings more dignity than the film really deserves, with his usual quiet and understated performance. Out of all the characters, his is probably the only one which bears a resemblance to a real person.
Giovani Ribisi (Saving Private Ryan) plays young Kip Raines. To be honest, he's quite annoying, both as an actor and as a character, consistently squelching through his lines. It's to Cage's credit that he manages not to look too annoyed with the guy.
But for all the characters in the film, they are more or less superfluous to the cars themselves. That much is obvious when we first see Eleanor, as the camera pans lovingly over the cars bodywork.
The first half of the movie is mostly exposition, with Memphis being incredibly organised and clever. There is a fairly standard chase and fight scene early on, just to keep the action level up. It's a Bruckheimer film, don't you know! It's really the last twenty minutes where the film really, please excuse the pun, shifts into top gear.
As Memphis desperately tries to steal Eleanor (the last car on the list) with Castlebeck and an army of cops in hot pursuit. The final car chase is truly a job to behold, perfectly staged and executed, long and varied, and underscored with the ultra cool music score. Cars crash, but interestingly do not explode, which is rare for a Bruckheimer film. Still, it also ensures that none of the good guys get hurt.
It's kind of a shame that after such an adrenaline fuelled burning of rubber, the film ends in a fairly standard gunfight that lacks any sense of tension. After all he's been through, you know that Memphis won't come to harm.
I gave this film five stars because, even though some of the characters grate and the plot isn't very strong, it's just impossible not to love this film. Although Bruckheimer has never been one for deep characterisations or subtle sub-plots, by God he knows how to get the pulses racing. This movie is an essential buy for anyone that knows a quality film.",1005177600,,3858,4.576589595375722
1383216,5,B00004Z4WR,"Gone in 60 seconds is a adrenaline rush that grabs you from the very beginning and never lets go.  But few people know that its a remake of a 1974 Classic where nearly 100 cars are destroyed in the 40 minute chase scene between a 1973 Mustang Mach 1 and the entire city of long beach.  But we aren't talking about that now are we?
Bottom line:  this is the coolest car movie out there right now, the fast and the furious comes close, but not quite.  The assignment is to steal 50 Exotic beauties in 72 hours or Cage's brother gets the axe.  Cool huh?  With cars ranging from a 1967 Corvette to a Lamborghini Diablo.  And the final car, which is none other than a 1967 Shelby Mustang GT500.  The sexiest car in existance.

1383218,4,B00004Z4WR,"As ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"" begins to unfold, it gives you one of two different options: you can either scrutinize its inane sense of logic, disinteresting plot, and lack of intriguing character development. Or, you can do what I did, and just sit back and enjoy the ride. And what a ride it is. True, all of the above statements threaten to bog the movie down, but director Dominic Sena, teaming up with pyrotechnic-master Bruckheimer, fills the screen with some very high-speed action that is more intense than most might give it credit for.
Simplicity is all the rage in the story, which centers around Memphis Raines (Nicholas Cage), a former car theft professional whose brother Kip (Giovanni Ribisi) is the latest target of a mobster who hired him to boost expensive cars. After a heist that went sour, he's out to kill Kip, but agrees to walk if Memphis can deliver 50 cars of various makes and models to him in three days. So, like any devoted and loving brother would do, he rounds up his former gang of car thieves and makes plans to boost the vehicles one night before the scheduled shipment.
That's all you really need to know, except for a few side stories involving a romantic past between Memphis and the lusty Sway (Angelina Jolie). The entire plot is predictable, beginning to end, reason being that since the movie is rated PG-13, we automatically know two things: a) nothing overtly violent will be taking place, and b) due to this lack of violence, nothing very shocking is going to be taking place.
But for the most part, the movie pays off with a lightweight amount of good-natured action setups that accomplish what they promise. There's the various escapes from the bumbling cops (including two detectives who appear to have come straight from a bad TV cop show), many of which provide us with some very intense chases as cars swerve in and out of traffic, dodge garbage trucks, crash into other cars, etc. Sena crowns this off with a very effective, if somewhat cheesy, finale in which Raines steals the car he could never control, and takes it for the ride we all dream of taking.
Thrown into the mix is a cast that appears to be having so much fun with the material that I almost felt left out when trying to pick the movie apart. Cage is back in the bad-boy form we have come to love him for, and is interaction with the delectable Jolie provide some very witty one-liners and even some awkward chemistry. Among the cast are Robert Duvall as a shady mechanic, and Ribisi in one of his less-appealing roles, but everyone seems to have high spirits, which helps the movie keep up a pretense of fun.
I'm not usually a sucker for schlocky thrills, but ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"" had me laughing and watching in all the right places. The title is a pretty good summation of its own plot, and though I found the film to be completely mindless, there's enough good, raunchy humor and more-than-mediocre action sequences to make up for its lack of intriguing story.",1003449600,2,2981,4.626415094339623
1383219,3,B00004Z4WR,"If you're reading this review to determine the depths of acting muster displayed in the film, then you obviously haven't seen it yet....
If you've read any of my other film reviews then you know that I'm an Angelina Jolie fan and I've recently added this to my collection of Jolie films on DVD.
Reviewed as an Angelina Jolie film - Three stars for this one and that's because Angelina doesn't show up for about half an hour and then, she's barely featured - don't buy into the DVD cover or movie poster that feature her prominently. She's just the best looking cast member.
First - the DVD. The interfaces are pretty cool. Lots of nice graphics and car sounds. It gets a little tired if you're spending some time just zooming around the features though.
A small interview with Angelina Jolie is featured under the ""Old School"" catagory of the special features. It's short, though, so be warned. The most you get out of it was that Angelina Jolie came up with the whole ""look"" of Sway ( that character she plays in the film )...which, I'm thinking, was probably more fun for her than the limited acting she was asked to do.
As far as the film itself, it's an okay movie. It's no masterpiece. It's basically a little plot wrapped around a lot of stunt car chases. Nothing wonderous or even particularily original.
The plot revolves around Nicolas Cage and his ""old school"" gang of car theives having to do one last big run in order to save his younger brother from a ... well, this is starting to sound much more complex than the movie lets on so I'll stop here before I give something away.
Needless to say, Nicholas Cage has made better films. Mostly he's talking in that ""8mm"" whispered voice that's supposed to make him seem mature and deep. It doesn't exactly work, I mean, the guys a car thief.
For those gearheads out there ( and I mean that affectionately ) there are some very cool cars featured. Notably the Shelby GT. Very cool. Ferarri's are featured ( Angelina says ""hello ladies"" ) as are just about every really ""hot"" sports car. You just get a glimpse of most of them, though.
Note that none of the cars are suped-up or special a la ""The Fast and The Furious"" but the cars featured here are actually a shopping list, not a personal vehicle.
Robert Duvall is featured - he's doing that ""Days of Thunder"" talking to the car thing he's apparently mastered.
Giovanni Ribisi is along for the ride if you'll pardon the pun. He's done a lot of better work than this. See ""Saving Private Ryan"" if you want to realize a bit of his depth.
Back to Angelina Jolie's performance...""phoned in"" would be appropriate. I'm not even sure why she'd take a part like this, with so little character. She's got the look ( which she apparently defined ) and she's nice to look at...when we get that chance. I'll remind you that she's not on screen all that often. In all, she's probably only got 20 minutes or so of screen time.
To make an obtuse Angelina Jolie jump - the character she plays here could very well be the older incarnation of ""Legs"" from Foxfire ( a much, much better Angelina Jolie film ). They appear to wear the same boots <G>.
So, yes, this is a must have for the completist, but everyone else should probably just wait for it on cable.

This is like Con Air on land. The story line was a little hard to believe. I think it would be hard to steal 50 cars in one night. Especially when most of those cars are exotics. The special effects in this movie aren't really the greatest, but the action makes up for it. If you are into guy flicks, then this is a definate must for your collection.

1383231,5,B00004Z4WR,"Are you in the mood for a movie with deep, philosophical overtones?  Want to watch a film that is a cerebral challenge, one sure to leave you intellectually exhausted by the end?  If you answered ""yes"" to either of these questions, then ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" is most assuredly not for you.  At least, not in your present state of mind.
However, if you want a movie that is just plain a lot of fun, one that has a few laughs & is well done, then you will enjoy this one.  In fact, this is an almost sure-fire movie if you're searching for these attributes.
This movie is the result of pouring together a flimsy plot, good direction & top echelon actors such as Nicholas Cage, Robert Duvall and Angelina Jolie, stir gently with a quality Trevor Rabin soundtrack, sprinkle in some of the most gorgeous sports cars in the world, then let it sit for 60 seconds.  Afterwards, pop it into your DVD player and it's ready to watch!
As is the case with every Bruckenheimer movie except ""Armageddon,"" this production is very well done.  It is also noteworthy to mention that ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" is NOT just one big, long chase scene, or a series of chase scenes one-after-the-other.  By my count, there were only two car chase scenes;  a brief one in the beginning & a dramatic one towards the end.  Somehow, the film found ways to keep my attention in between times;  remarkable for a movie that is almost exclusively about stealing cars.
The main question that will probably decide whether people enjoy this movie does not have so much to do with the film itself as it does the genre.  Can you appreciate a light-hearted, fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously?  Do you prize the opportunity of seeing exotic cars like Ferrari, Lamborgini, Porsche & a vintage Mustang?

""Memphis"" comes home to help his younger brother, Kip, who has followed in his older brother's footsteps but is not as skilled at stealing cars. Having screwed up a major car boost, his employer, a sadistic, maniacal individual, will kill him, unless ""Memphis"" agrees to fulfil a contractual obligation of stealing fifty top of the line cars for which Kip's ""boss"" has made a commitment. The only glitch is that ""Memphis"" has a decidely short deadline in which to make his quota.

For reasons that those who view the movie will immediately discern, ""Memphis"" agrees to this thankless task. He gets his old crew together and with his former nemesis, a hard nosed detective played by Delroy Lindo, in hot pursuit, the games begin.

The cars are, literally, all gone in sixty seconds.  This film should be the ideal vehicle for iconography and obsession, instead it's a demonstration of ham-fisted editing and incompetent characterisation.  Everyone in the film is meant to love cars, yet the film is devoid of passion.  No passion, in any sense of the term. And yes, the script is terrible, the dialogue clumsy, the plot hackneyed, the characters cardboard, and yes, you might be able to overlook all this if the cars were the stars (plus Angelina (and why doesn't she have some attractive friends, too, for that matter?)).

However, for a movie about stealing cars, there wasn't a whole lot of car stealing scenes nor many car chases.  The whole point of this movie is sport cars, so shouldn't the director plan the movie around, say, sport cars?  There was way too much pointless plot before the all-to-quick car theft.  And they made the ending so sad it's tough to watch (you car fans know what I'm talking about).

You can watch the action highlight featurette and the time needed to watch the whole movie. Overall a very bad value.

How much of a movie can you make about car theft?  Not a lot, but who cares?  That's not the point--the whole idea is to drool and cough over these gorgeous sets of wheels.  Angelina Jolie doesn't play a major role, and even though we know that Sway and Memphis were once involved, there's 0% romance between them now.  No biggie because she's in the film for 2 reasons (I think):  give the guys a pretty woman to look at along with the cars, and for the ladies who watch this who love cars like I do, she's a character to identify with.
The supporting cast members do a good job in being just that--support.  They're important in that they help boost cars and not much more.  The whole story exists on one premise alone, and that's Memphis' love for his brother Kip.  Memphis re-enters the life to save Kip's life, and since the task of stealing 50 cars in 48 hours is a daunting one, he needs help from some old friends.  I really liked the other members of the crew and wish some of them had had more camera time and lines...
How's the sound on this DVD?  NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING!  I can't imagine trying to watch this movie any other way--it must've been incredible in a theater.  Sound so good, you swear the cars are racing by you in the room!  WHOA.  Nothing like hearing a nitrous car in surround sound...  Saddest part of the movie?  The way the Shelby looks at the end--that ticked me off/made me cry.
If you're in this for a heavy story, you will be incredibly disappointed.  If you're in this for the cars, prepare to love it.

The original, on the other (better) hand, used ONE for the whole chase! It was torn up at the end, but it ran. The ONLY thing better about the new one is the acting (what little there is).

1383250,3,B00004Z4WR,"Gone in sixty seconds disappointed me to some extent but I can't say that it was awful..
I hadn't seen the original ""cult"" movie dated 1974,but I had heard a lot of good things about it..The cast for the new version was great and I was especially happy that Nicolas Cage,one of my favorite actors,was playing Memphis Raines,the lead character. The listed cars to be stolen by our thieves were real beauties and they alone were a sufficient reason for me to like the movie..Well,at the end,it turned out to be the case,as they were one of the few good things about the movie..
Here is the simple plot..The young brother of the legendary car boost Randall ""Memphis"" Raines and his crew make a deal with a mobster and agree to steal some cars for him..Things don't go right and they mess it up..The mobster,an italian nicknamed ""The Carpenter"",holds young Kip Raines hostage in order to convince big brother Memphis Raines to do the job..Memphis,who had quit the city and ""boosting"" cars some years ago,reluctantly agrees and gets his crew back together in order to steal 50 rare and expensive cars in 3 nights...
The movie could have been good if only the script was a bit heavier and the characters were better developed. My guess is that Bruckheimer,the producer of the movie and the big audience entertainer,decided it would slow the movie down. But I should also note that altough the final big chase was quite entertaining (somehow I have the feeling the big chase in the original film was better),that's almost the only car chase in a movie you expect to include a lot of. I was under the impression that from the moment Memphis agrees to do the job,all the script did was to prepare us for the big final show.
The actors did a pretty job altough I don't think they had to spend too much effort for those ""weak"" characters they played. Nicolas Cage was fun to watch and Angelina Jolie was strange looking in blonde hair. But my favorite actor was Giovanni Ribisi in this movie.(Kip)
The DVD includes a nice amount of extras and the picture and sound quality are great..
I give this 3 stars because of Nicolas Cage and some nice scenes here and there..If you are looking for a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat or a movie with surprises,you probably won't like this one..If you are looking for lots of car chases,again you may be disappointed.

This movie stared Nicholas Cage as Randall ""Memphis"" Raines, an ex-car theft, his brother, Kip Raines played by Giovanni Ribisi, is trying to follow in his footsteps. Kip and his squad of unintimidating, punk, rough-em-up car baddies agree to a job where they're ridiculously expected to steal 50 specific cars for some really over-dramatic scary boss dude a.k.a 'The Carpenter' (scary, huh!?) .Anyways, they've got some ludicrously small amount of time for no good reason to nab the cars. But unlike the 'car theft legend' Kip's brother is made out to be, Kip himself ..... and screws up, and now his bro has to go steal the cars for him in order to get him back from 'The Carpenterrr'.
I don't know why that sounds so great, every line is overdramatic especially the big bad boss who sounds more .......... than evil to me, I mean he's British and loves making things out of wood and treats them like his babies. Another horrible mistake that you seem common in these bad action flicks it that there are things where it 'just happens to be there'. The part I am specifically talking about is the final chase scene (which is a beautiful blend of inconprehensive sense and pure stupidity) where Cage is in the LAST car he needs in the LAST few moments of his deadline and all these cps are chasing him and he reaches a part on his route to the warehouse with a huge traffic jam, and an empty car carrier truck 'just happens to be there' right smack in front of him, so he floors it up the truck's back and clears like a mile or so of traffic.

Everyone says this movie has no plot. Like running a truckload of beer in limited time was a plot, or saving an orphanage by throwing a concert while on the lamb. This movie is designed for enjoyment purposes. No sitting around looking for the next plot twist, or trying to figure out ""who done it"". Just sit back, relax, feel the testosterone flow, and enjoy.

This movie is totally unrealistic and basically just a bunch of fast cars driven by a few excellent actors (Giovanni Ribisi & Robert Duvall) surrounded by some vomit-inducing actors (Scott Caan, Angelina Jolie, & Master P) in a very boring story.  This movie uses scenes ripped off from AMERICAN GRAFFITI and BULLITT to make up for a faulty plot written by Scott Rosenberg.  Apparently, Jerry Bruckheimer used his trademark moronic formula of (if we put a whole bunch of exotic cars in the movie people will want to see it just so they can sit around saying ""that car's badass!"") showing exotic cars in stunts and a surgically enhanced girl in hopes to make this a guy's movie.  If you are a car nut do not expect to see any cars that you have not seen in movies before (Hummers, Lamborghini's, and a few classic hotrods) and you will also hear a lot of namedropping in an effort to impress the layperson.  The technical side of the movie is just as bad.  The stunts are altogether unrealistic and the CGI special effects are easy to pick out.  The disc is also disappointing; the volume on the menu is much greater than the actual movie, the commentary audio track is mixed so softly that it is barely audible and the beginning of the disc is filled with previews to other similarly disappointing movies.

It's obvious that Angelina Jolie made this before her Oscar win for Girl, Interrupted--her character was rather secondary and pointless.  Cage again plays the wise-cracking semi-superhero we've seen before in Con Air, The Rock, etc.
Gone in Sixty Seconds probably does appeal to its intended crowd--those who like speed, explosions, and never-ending chase scenes.  Those looking for a plot or any characters should not expect much from this.  With the exception of a surprisingly good soundtrack, the cars are really the best part of this movie.

1383274,3,B00004Z4WR,"Gone In 60 Seconds wasn't as bad a movie as I feared it would be.  I don't usually like to sit down to watch a movie with any expectations, be they good or bad because that can usually affect your judgement on the movie.  Expect it to be too good, and if it's only average, you hate it even more, expect it to be utter trash, and if it's average, you might be tempted to think better of it than it deserves.  Sometimes it's hard to keep perspective when your friends insist on telling you about the movie, or you've read someone else's review, or something of the sort.  I have to admit that I had heard bad things about the movie, and the trailer I had seen for it during its theatrical play didn't really interest me that much, but a friend loaned me his movie, so I gave it a watch, and I have to admit that it wasn't all that bad.
 Yes, no glowing recommendation from me, but it was an entertaining way to spend two hours, and I'm glad I at least got the chance to watch it once.  If I ever see it again, it will be on television though, because I have no plans on actually adding this movie to my collection.  It was better than average, but in no way exceptional.
 The cast wasn't actually that bad, given the material they were given to work with.  Nicholas Cage, whom I generally like, did a good job with the role he was given, but the script didn't really seem to give him any leeway to actually develop a character I could really care too deeply for.  Also, why they bothered getting Angelina Jolie for this movie, I really can't guess because all together she gets about twenty minutes of screen time.  As a fine actress in her own right more could have been done with her role, but the movie didn't really seem that interested in developing the characters, merely with barreling along at full throttle, throwing so much eye candy at you that you don't notice how skimpy the plot actually is.  Well, I noticed.
 Still though, the film does have a certain energy, and if it doesn't live up to what it could have been, that's just the way it goes sometimes.  I'd recommend this as a rental, or see if you have a friend you could borrow it from since one viewing should be enough for anyone.",980380800,,2200,4.257211538461538

The cars are hotter, the story is a little more solid, if not having a thin plot, and the acting is certainly better thanks to the talents of Nick Cage, Angelina ... Jolie, and Delroy Lindo.  The only disappointment is the shorter car chase at the end.  I was really hoping for another 40 minute car chase with updated cinematography and special effects.  But alas, no, although the car certainly had more gusto then the original and it was certainly just as fun to watch.  It's also a blast for every car enthusiast to see all the various exotic and rare four wheeled beauties this movie shows off.  Everything from a Luxury SUV Yukon (seems kind of strange to me though) to a Daytona Charger (banned from Nascar in the 70's because it was too fast) to the star of the movie, Eleanor.  That's right, this movie may have Cage, Lindo and Jolie pulling off decent performances with a meager script, but just like in the '74 original movie, the hopped up GT 500 Mustang with outside pipes and a paint job with attitude steals every scene she's in...I mean, that IT'S in.  Cage tries to work with this lovely lady in the scenes he shares with her...I mean, IT...but he can't keep up.  If you like cars, and I'm not talking to just guys, I know there are plenty of women out there who look at cars and drool as well even if they don't know who makes it, then this movie is good for pure entertainment purposes.

Eleanor as the '67 Shelby Mustang GT 500 turned in an outstanding and powerfully-driven performance. O.K., enough of the auto puns and cliches. However, speaking of puns and cliches, the one scene where they could have done without was the scene with Cage and Jolie waiting to steal one of the cars where Jolie and Cage start making sexual references about male and female genitalia and the sex act in relation to car parts during a semi-heated romantic scene.

You look at a movie with Nick Cage, Robert Duvall, Delroy Lindo, and Angelina Jolie, and you would have to think it was going to be good, but you'd be wrong. From a purely visual standpoint the film is slick and entertaining, but in reality it is a poorly written mediocre action movie. Nicholas Cage plays Randall ""Memphis"" Raines a legend in the auto theft community who is forced out of retirement to save his kid brothers (played by the always strange Giovanni Ribisi) life. Raines must recruit a group of car thieves (Jolie, Duvall and others) who are capable of stealing 50 rare and exotic cars in 72 hours while the crafty police detective (played by Lindo) is hot on their trail. From there the movie goes on to be a disappointing mix of bad one liners and stale dialogue. Duvall's talent is absolutely wasted in this picture, and Angelina Jolie's physical appearance is down right frightening (what ever happend to that pretty girl from ""The Bone Collecter""?). As a guy I have to admit that I loved the action and the car chases especially the final chase with Cage, but the ending is so far fetched that you wouldn't believe it.

You'd think Bruckheimer would have learned his lesson after Days of Thunder--cars just aren't that exciting.  Here, in typical Bruckheimer fashion, the music-video cuts and the sound are the only things that keep things moving.  It's only through the charisma of the lesser characters that the movie survives.  Cage is in neutral the whole way through, and Angelina Jolie is little more than a walk-on (check out the false advertising for this film; take the money and run, Ange... you won't get far), so you know it ain't about cars and girls.
Bad Boys was similarly thin on plot, but this movie isn't as funny.  The Rock had it's share of charismatic actors, but this movie lacks the Rock's action.  It's basically a rainy-day rental, and if you were one of the few who actually paid money to see this in the theatre, consider yourselves had.

1383301,3,B00004Z4WR,"Producer Jerry Bruckheimer (American Gigolo, Beverly Hills Cop, Armageddon) took a minor B movie from the 70's and remade it into a big budget action flick.  Unfortunately, the updated screenplay is no better than the original, which was a meager excuse for one big car chase.
The story revolves around Memphis Raines (Nicholas Cage), a renowned but retired car thief pressed into service to save his brother's life.  He must steal 50 cars in a few days or his brother will be killed.  This is not a very complex or intriguing plot, but it gives Bruckheimer an opportunity to spend $90 million wrecking expensive cars.  The dialogue is vapid, something to fill the time between action sequences, which are quite spectacular.
Director Dominic Sena, (Kalifornia) got an opportunity to direct his first megabuck film and did a fine job on the stunts.  This film didn't offer much opportunity for nuance; so he did well with the project he was given.  The car chase scenes were spectacular especially the car jump on the bridge.
Nicholas Cage and Giovanni Ribisi are wasted in a film with few good lines.  Cage did a lot of his own stunt driving, which was impressive, but he didn't have a lot with which to work with such a shallow character.  Angelina Jolie is just a throw-in to up the testosterone factor.  The best acting performance is probably that of Delroy Lindo as the frustrated detective.

1383304,3,B00004Z4WR,"This is a remake of a classic from the 70s, so in order to fully gage the effectiveness of this film, I'd need to take a look at the first.
Nicolas Cage is past his prime. Angelina and Giovanni are just hitting theirs. Robert Duvall is a great character actor, Delroy Lindo is effective as the detective. But in general, these actors seem to fall into traditional roles. Nicolas Cage is the same pained character he's played in every film since Face/Off (the exception being City of Angels, where he strayed a bit). Angelina was sexy, exciting, and mysterious, as she is in every film. The pairing of her and Cage had as much chemistry as I saw with Billy Bob and her pairing in Pushing Tin (course, we all see where that 'lack of passion' led... so don't take my word for it). Giovanni seems to put the most into this film, straying enough to make a point.
But, this is a Bruckheimer film (The Rock), so who really needs acting? The car chases are spectacular, and the action is brilliant. The comedy comes from the two African-American members of the 'team.'
Overall, the film just isn't that special. Nothing stands out, and a cast that features a couple of Oscar winners should fair differently.
I'm a big fan of car chases, Angelina Jolie and Nicolas Cage and if you are too then it's go if not rent it and have fun for a couple of hours.",976579200,,1343,4.419354838709677

The plot is simple: Boy in trouble (Giovanni Ribisi - looking greasy), big brother comes to help (Nic Cage - Showing age). Big Brother is forced to resume a life he left so little brother wouldn't follow in his footsteps. Isn't it ironic..dontcha think?
The supporting cast is excellent. Delroy Lindo is money, sans one very poorly delivered line ""Don't ever talk about my wife"". Robert Duvall as the Chop Shop Master and prevailing cooler head is under used but we'll take it. Wiil Paxton is in fine ""Bruckheimer"" form. Angelina Jolie looking like an sexy Albino Rasta girl.

Being a worldly 30 years old, I have come to the conclusion that people in my age bracket, unless irritatingly borish and too self-important, will accept cool sound, stunts and action, sex and visual Ooh's and Ahh's for entertainment and deem it righteous. Old Schoolers seem to think that plots and dialogue matter. Yeah maybe in boring period pieces and taught mysteries with great actors (Seven/Silence), but not with this flick.
From the first rev of the Porsche 911 twin turbo, it's clear this is whiz bang stuff. Get your buzz on and crank this picture UP!!  The Picture is very clean. I enjoy all the different tints they use in different sceens to set the mood. This could grate on some of you. When you see all the cars for the first time, you can only think that those cars were clean enough to operate on. DVD hides very little as you know.
To wrap this up, the ""boosting"" sceens are cool, there is plenty of humor and the grand finale chase through a very decayed looking Long Beach (or where ever they are) is spectacular.
Want perfect plot and Thespian acting, go to the arthouse. Want popcorn fun and a reason to rattle the windows, then pick this up.",976579200,5,2074,4.50132625994695

1383308,5,B00004Z4WR,"Where to start with this one? In the summer of 2000 wedged between The Patriot and Shaft was a movie titled, Gone in 60 Seconds. This movie was supposed to be a flop when critics found out that Mr. Bruckheimer was updating a 1974 B-Flick.
He who laughs last! Well so much for the critics, because this movie did anything, but flop. There is a few story lines to follow in this, what should be a classic. The story of a man giving up everything for the good of the family. The tale of two brothers and how they will do anything for each other. Lost love united in the middle of a ""boost."" Or a chase with the ""unicorn.""
Now all of these add for a great movie, but you know what, Memphis (Nicolas Cage) and Eleanor (67 Shelby Mustang GT-500) make the movie. The car he has tried to steal three previous times will the last one in the line of 50 to save his little bro from being killed by Raymond Calitri. What happens is Memphis and Eleanor go for a joyride that will appeal to anyone and make everyone wish they could drive her like Memphis. I still have goose-bumps from just watching it. I will tell you something, I guarantee you the original is not this great, so why don't you get out of your seat, put this movie in the VCR, and hold on, seriously, because you will be laughing, and wanting to grab onto to something!

1383312,4,B00004Z4WR,"Dominic Sena's (Kalifornia) Gone in 60 Seconds is pulse pounding, adrenaline erupting, star saturated, pun laced, kinetically explosive, vividly captured, exhilaratingly breathtaking, and undeniably fun romp of chase movie that delivers all the goods in a timely fashion and with evident expertise in style to spare. Starring a first class cast including Nicholas Cage (Randall ""Memphis"" Raines), Angelina Jolie (Sara ""Sway"" Wayland), Robert Duvall (Otto Halliwell), Giovanni Ribisi (Kip Raines), Delroy Lindo (Detective Roland Castlebeck), and Will Patton (Atley Jackson), the film abounds with highly visible acting confidence that permits the film to leave comprehensive character development for an emphasis on an outstanding visceral experience that leaves one uninterested in the characters motivations or predispositions.
Gone in 60 Seconds manipulates its star power like finely warn marbles being confidently thrown in the fray confident that they will fall safely in the zone. Despite consistently sharp and savage criticism by the bulk of film critics about the film's lack of breadth, shallow characters, underwritten relationships, and obvious methods of storytelling, Gone in 60 Seconds was never meant to be an Academy Award winning ensemble piece of the sorrows of thievery on a family. It was solely intended by Producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Top Gun, Armageddon) to be a very engaging popcorn movie that people would want to see again and again, and he succeeded smashingly.
Despite what you might hear from the reviews, Gone in 60 Seconds is a notably delightful chase film that was meant to experience not to inanely analyze. Enjoy the ride, and don't take it too seriously.  As for the DVD edition of the film, Gone in 60 Seconds includes a fabulous anamorphic wide screen presentation, a Jerry Bruckheimer commentary track, making of documentaries, theatrical trailer, and much much more.

There are only two real chase scenes and its at the beginning and at the end.  The Ferrari 355s, Lamborghini Diablos, the 'Cudas, and the Jaguars only make cameo appearances.

This is an action packed comedy that revolves around the two main characters, Randall ""Memphis"" Raines (Cage) and his brother Kip Raines (Ribisi).  The main story is that Kip botches a rather large ""boost"" of car he was supposed to steal.  His employer is not so happy and threatens to kill him.  This is where Randall comes in to bail his brother out.  But he gets sucked into a delima and has to steal the cars himself.

1383318,2,B00004Z4WR,"Take a mediocre script, the type which, traditionaly, would be a low budget feature, throw a lot of money at it, giving it A-list actors and a director with MTV credentials, then hype it up with fast-paced, exciting trailers.
The result 95% of the time is a movie which could be only mediocre at best.  This is the case for Gone in 60 Seconds.  The plot is wildly improbable.  It takes the hero three days(or aproximately 100 minutes of screen time) to decide to do what he should have done in the first 60 seconds of the movie.
Of course that would have cut out all of the lingering auto erotic shots of cars as they are being scoped out for theft, all of the dimly lit back room conversations and the car chase finale.
In other words, as usual for a Bruckheimer produced picture, the movie unapologeticly demands an excessive amount of suspension of disbelief in order to be effective.
So let's throw out the plot and go instead to the car chases which were this movie's true reason for existence.  In a word: derivative.  The chases felt borrowed from other movies, only without as much risk.  The bit where the heroes hook the undercarriage of a rival gang's car to a towtruck was lifted directly from American Graffitti. You don't have the 150 police car pileup that happened in The Blues Brothers, there is no wild spin out like in Cannonball Run and no really big stunts like the chases in Terminator 2.  The only moment which felt fresh was the compressed gas tank bouncing along the path of oncoming cars.

1383319,3,B00004Z4WR,"Gone in 60 seconds is story about a retired car thief who is forced back into the business when his kid brother ends up on the wrong side of a psychotic gangster.  Nicolas Cage's assignment is simple enough, for $200, 000 he must steal 50 cars ... or his brother dies.
This movie was blasted by every critic that I saw, however, I think that the critics were overly harsh.  Gone in 60 seconds is a high adrenaline, car chase film that requires the viewer to use the same powers of ""willing suspension of disbelief"" that are necessary for most of Nicolas Cage's action films.  Nicolas Cage and a fairly impressive supporting cast (including Robert Duvall, Delroy Lindo,  Angelina Jolie) give decent performances despite a script that under used them.  Giovanni Ribisi is perfect in the role of Nicolas Cage's over confident younger brother.
Great acting, however, is not what this film is about.  This film is about fast cars and lots of action, which it delivers.  After a brief introduction to the characters, we get to watch how the thieves stalk the individual cars, a part that I found interesting.  After this point, it is pretty much a none stop car chase scene, which was fairly well filmed and has a pretty good soundtrack to keep your adrenaline pumped.

Had not Halicki perished during filming of the sequel in 1989 (a water tower fell too early and crushed the car Halicki was driving), he would have been the obvious choice to direct a WORTHY remake of the best car-chasing movie of all times.
Car-chase movies were a lot better in the 70's (the Driver ('78) and Cannonball ('76) (no, NOT the Burt Reynolds comedy) for example), with the rare exception of new movies like Ronin.

Those looking for a little bit of substance in their film need not apply to this one, audiences who want to grab a bag of popcorn and have some fun, will certainly get their money's worth out of this fast paced 'cartoon.'Calling this film a cartoon may sound like an insult, but with this film, that's not the case.  With this movie, we get loads of colorful characters and some crazy stunt work.  The story is one that you've seen a ton of times previously, and if you haven't it's still predictable.  Randall ""Memphis"" Reins (Nicolas Cage) is an ex-car thief who once was 'the best' in the business.  Reins is lured back into the business when his dopey brother (Giovanni Ribisi) gets on the bad side of a notorious criminal called 'The Carpenter'.  Reins comes rushing, reluctantly at first, to little brother's aid and in order to have the little man's life spared, Reins, along with his brother, must steal 50 cars in 24 hours for 'The Carpenter' or both of them will be killed.  There's some bits of Reins assembling the old gang he used to steal cars with including the sexy Angelina Jole-an ex-girlfriend with an attitude.  Master actor Robert Duvall is also on hand as the theif's mechanic.  Reins back on his old turf even makes a local gang very unhappy and just for good meausre, we get to see the car thieves dealing with these dopes in a few very amusing scenes.  Another main character is a cop (Delroy Lindo) who sees Reins back in town and vows to catch him this time out.  To this cop, Reins is like Moby Dick, and although this is nothing original, the cat and mouse, hide and seek game played between these two guys is also very fun. Gone in 60 Seconds is concerned less about plot and characters and more about cars and style.  The thing about this movie though, is that for a movie about cars, we only get one car chase.  Granted it is a long and exciting one toward the film's finish, but those expecting this one to be all chase will probably be disappointed.  But, if you're just looking for two hours of escapist fun, this is a really great movie.  There's nothing too special about any of it, but if you know what you're getting into, there's just a general aura of fun about the whole thing. This movie won't appeal to prudish viewers who believe themselves above a silly good time, fans of The Rock and Con Air should have a pretty decent idea of what they're getting into.  Imagine those films, but sillier!  Gone in 60 Seconds IS a fun movie, just turn off your common sense and enjoy the ride.  I'll bet you have a good time.",972432000,3,2631,4.445833333333334
1383327,5,B00004Z4WR,"For years, Jerry Bruckheimer has rocked the movie scene with smash hits such as Armageddon, Enemy of the State, and Top Gun.  As we enter a new millennium of film-making (which, by the way, does not begin until 2001), Bruckheimer adds to the list of box office favorites with Gone in 60 Seconds and Coyote Ugly.  Both movies are excellent...chock full of action, drama, comedy....you name it, it's in there.  Gone in 60 Seconds is my personal favorite movie, mostly because I am an automobile fanatic.  However, there is much more to the film than just cars.  I admit that it was the cars and action that lured me to watch the film, but while watching the movie, I began to love it even more once I realized the underlying plot....brotherly love.  There are some who feel that this movie has no plot;  that it is merely a movie full of cars that go fast.  Those people are obviously wrong and I believe that Jerry  Bruckheimer himself would be outraged by such a claim.  The movie has a deep plot, and with that plot matched with the right mixture of drama, action, comedy, and exotic cars, Gone in 60 Seconds has earned its place among the all-time greatest movies.
For those of you who feel the need to bash Gone in 60 Seconds, or those who think it has no plot, or those who think the movie is horrible, you should also have the guts to reveal yourself instead of hiding like the cowards you are.

So when June 9th rolled around and the new Bruckheimer flick hit theaters, I was there, and I loved every minute of it! The movie has a simplistic but addicting plot: Memphis Raines (Nicholas Cage) is a retired car thief who is trying to stay away from his old life of crime. His little brother Kip (Giovnni Ribisi), however, has grown up to be just like his hero, Memphis.  Kip decides to to get involved with a dangerous boost, in which he must steal 50 top-of-the line cars. When Kip gets into trouble, his boss kidnaps him and finds Memphis. Memphis has two choices: Steal all 50 cars in 48 hours, or watch his brother die.
Memphis takes the Boost.
He assembles his old team: Otto (Robert Duvall), and expert on stripping down cars, Donny (Chi McBride), an old timer car thief, The Sphinx (Vinnie Jones), a rough and tough friend of memphis, and Switch (Angelina Jolie), Memphis's old girlfriend. After careful planning, Memphis and his friends start what could become the most impressive car boost ever.
The rest of the movie if packed with intense police chases, ear-shattering explosions, and oh so many beautiful cars! As with any Bruckheimer film, the viewer leaves the movie with a feeling of adrenaline, and Gone in Sixty Seconds is no exception.

Don't get me wrong, this is a spectacular film, but all it takes is one trailer with a fast car being chased and everyone has their view of the film set in stone before they've even watched it.
I for one am not one of those unlucky individuals. The basics of the plot are that Nic Cage's younger brother has taken on a job he can't really handle (after following in his brother's footsteps to his chosen carear), and when it all goes wrong, there's inevitably only one person left who can save the day, the now retired Cage with his legendary persona.
They've got to steal 50 cars in just under a week, and as the prospect of a dead brother doesn't bode too well in Cage's now relatively docile and humble mind, he decides to save his li'l brother's hide. I know, another typical American tale of good vs bad is the picture you have drumming through your mind, but this film has sooooooo much more to offer.
The soundtrack is the best I've heard this year, and the simple elegance with which the central stars perform consistently is rarely matched by holywood these days. And instead of opting to run out guns blazing (as is the norm), the gang (of young and old blood) opt for the more tactical aproach, and the only thing standing in their way is the fateful Elanor, an absolute beaut of a motor with which Cage has a bit of unfortunate history.
Do they get there, don't they? You know the answer well before the time comes, but if you watch this film remembering it's a 2hr slice of entertainment, I guarantee you won't be disappointed!",970185600,4,1691,4.423076923076923

Gone in 60 seconds isn't exactly Cage's best work, but it was one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a while.",969840000,10,637,4.364406779661017
1383336,2,B00004Z4WR,"This was a movie that was made for summer. It had it all, big stars, numerous exotic fast stars, but why did i tire of it so quickly? There could be numerous reasons, but the underlying factor is that there has to be more to a movie than a two hour car chase scene. It was from Bruckheimer, so it was stylish action sequences, but once you see them steal one car, you have seen it all.  There was some sort of a plot about his brother who would die if they could not get all the cars, but there was not enough character development done so you would be able to care whether they could pull the whole thing off. And the villian was a carpenter whose weakness was seeing his wooden creations get destroyed. Very clever stuff.",969667200,,723,4.201438848920863
1383337,5,B00004Z4WR,omg u have 2 get this movie it is so awesome it had so much action and its fast paced and the plot is awesome but the best part is that the characters r very well developed,969667200,,172,3.675675675675676
1383338,5,B00004Z4WR,"Gone in 60 seconds not only makes you want to drive at high speeds with nice cars and feel the breeze in your hair, but actually does it for you. Seeing this film 4 times in the theater, it got better everytime, the cinematography, directing, and script that fit right in with the 200 mph car chases. Nicolas Cage was perfect for the role, giving the best line readings to what could have been a very dull script. Overall a great action installment that makes you wanna get in that porsche 911 turbo and gas it all the way",969667200,3,522,4.282828282828283
1383339,5,B00004Z4WR,"I loved this film. The film got terrible reviews over here in Britain but it just shows they are not always correct. The film was a never ending rush of fast cars and brilliant action sequences. Nicholas Cage was brilliant as always, as was Giovanni Rubisi who has not had the recognition he deserves. Angelina Jolie was good although her part didn't do her justice. Overall a very enjoyable film that could be watched over and over again.",969667200,,439,4.641025641025641
1383340,4,B00004Z4WR,"I've seen this film at the movie month ago. What a race, what a show. If You like much cars, You can seee them all in action!  Of course acting of Nicolas is also pretty good. Try it.",969667200,,183,3.8157894736842106
1383341,4,B00004Z4WR,"Well, no one can say this movie did not have enough action, or not enough chase scenes, and did I mention the cars?  Critics who tore this movie apart really need to stop complaining about films that are only made to entertain.  It seems that some idiot invented an unwritten rule that says ""movies have to have deep involving scripts to be good.""  It IS true that well made films have good scripts, good characters that we can relate to, and most importantly, an involving story.  Well then I guess this isn't a well made film, but SO WHAT, it's entertaining, fun, and pleasing to the eyes (cars, fun action) and ears (very loud, get on DVD).  It's definately a car movie.  Check it out if you can take the action",969580800,5,714,4.412213740458015
1383342,5,B00004Z4WR,"I've read quite a few reviews from critics and other sources of information only to find that the majority seem to think that this movie was poorly made. I completely disagree. Movies aren't always about a perfect story line, or perfect acting, or even being perfectly accurate. Some movies are made just so the viewer can have fun and sometimes an adrenaline rush.
I'll be the first to admit that Gone In 60 Seconds wasn't a blockbuster. It didn't do anything new for the genre. But, the sheer awesomeness of the cars and the speeds at which they are driven makes the movie enjoyable. This movie is obviously meant to appeal to car enthusiasts and it does because it's all about cars. No filler content, no real attempt at an amazingly intriguing movie, just cars... and that's what makes it fun to watch. I HIGHLY reccommend it to anyone who even remotely enjoys cars. If you don't like cars, don't even bother.",969580800,,913,4.6419753086419755

1383344,5,B00004Z4WR,"This movie starts out with action and then keeps on going! There is never a low time especially when Master P. is out to get Cage. There are so many cool cars in this movie including the Shelby. This movie is definetly worth buying and you will never stop watching it! I recomment it to you, your friends, and your family!",969408000,,322,4.295081967213115
1383345,5,B00004Z4WR,"Every generation has its car movie.  (Bullitt, Smokey and the Bandit, etc...)  This is definitely ours.  Everything from Diablos to vintage Ferraris to the star: a '67 Shelby GT500.  The final car chase is unreal.  Of course its over the top, but it does things very tongue-in-cheek.  Good acting, good visuals, good soundtrack, and great opening sequence.  I hope the DVD is filled with goodies.",969408000,,396,5.0
1383346,5,B00004Z4WR,Do you have the need for speed? 0 - 60 in 2.9 Seconds sound good? The cast of this movie couldn't have been chosen any better.  Nicholas Cage is great in this movie just like he was in movies like 'The Rock' or 'Con Air'. I personally didn't like some of his new ones like 'Bringing out the Dead' but I saw this one anyway because I am a fast car fanatic.  It combines NON-STOP action and suspense with drama and comedy.  A killer combo. This movie is DEFINATELY worth seeing for anyone who likes Nicholas Cage or anyone who has been convicted for grand theft auto.,969408000,,565,4.261682242990654
