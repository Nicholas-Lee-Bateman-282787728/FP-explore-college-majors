It's the low-budget amateurish feel which causes this collection to be conversation worthy and worth adding to a decent home collection. I recommend starting with The Fear which I caught on fandor before seeing this collection and was the reason for seeking Experiments In Terror 2 out.",1360886400,2,436,4.986301369863014
