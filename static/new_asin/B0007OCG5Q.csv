2224004,5,B0007OCG5Q,"In an age where Hollywood feels it can slice and dice books to make a movie, especially with classical myths & legends, I thought Sci-Fi Channel did an exceptional job with this film.

Tragedy, deceit, scripting (except for Siegfried's lines - when he was just Erik the Smith's son, I could understand his being a punk but when he discovered he was a King, that should have ended his immaturity) - legend and fantasy all rolled into one miniseries.

Unlike the critics here pointing out minute details of inaccuracies and inconsistencies, I watch a movie for one thing: escapism. Can you escape in the movie? Yes. Easily so. It's not campy at all even when the prince's pals take on Erik in the town square and he bests them. It's not a long fight sequence and it doesn't distract from the film's overall feel.

The fight scene with the dragon (an overgrown komodo-like dragon) was quite classic and without the typically Hercules/Xena crap of defeating it.

Max Von Sidow did a superb job as Erik/Siegfried's father. He taught the lore of steel to his son, taught him to use weapons, to forge weapons, to learn the lore of the Gods, to respect the Gods, to be troth, and to stand up to the scrutiny of the christian ""Our-God-is-better-than-your-gods"" type of mentality.

The dwarf and his magic made sense. In many native cultures, those born deformed were believed to have been touched by the Gods/Spirits and often ended up becoming Shamans, Magicians or Varlokkurs. And making Julian Sands character a son-of-a-dwarf (something he despised) was truly superb.

The Seeress (Brunhilde's advisor) while somewhat historically accurate, didn't have historically accurate Runes staves. Iceland had 16 known Runes and these would have been carved on wood or possibly bone but not engraved in steel or metal. The way she held them and then cast them to read the omens from Odhinn was accurate.

Also the use of the ravens for communication is accurate. This is an old Shamanic technique that has been found in many native cultures. I was quite surprised to find this mini-series using such things.

Again, minor differences. SCA people usually note discrepncies in fighting techniques, weaponry and costuming. Historians look for slipping away from original story lines - this one from the Sagas.

I disagree that Siegfried should have been cast as a big ape of a guy. That was done in ""The Viking Sagas"" and it didn't work as well. Few big actors have the training to pull off good roles as they focus more on toning muscles and physical prowess rather than delivering their lines convincingly enough. Erik was acceptable in my opinion. Brunhilde was also very strikingly beautiful with an air of coldness about her. She definitely had that aura of the Saga Brunhilde to me - fat or not. The girl IS beefy.

If you haven't seen this film get it. I'm going to order a copy but also tape the one on Sci-Fi on VHS since I hear they've cut parts I like. The dragon head in the wagon was terrific! It's exactly what I'd do if I were in his boots so why cut it? Oh yes, the ""special edition crapola"" on the DVD. Yes let's CUT the movie to put on 'director's comments' or silly video games. Ugh.",1143676800,13,3185,4.712230215827338
2224005,4,B0007OCG5Q,"First off, let me say that if you like Norse myth you'll like Dark Kingdom.  This is one of the stories that inspired Tolkien to write Lord of the Rings.  Or should I say, one of three stories, because they combine three stories to make this film.

This is the story of Brunhild and Siegfried from Wagner's the ring cycle Brunhild is usually the fat lady.  That's where the saying comes from, ""The opera ain't over until the fat lady sings.""

Brunhild was a match for any man, or God.  This movie is a good movie, but if you saw it on the sci-fi channel.  You saw a more complete movie, than you got on the special edition DVD.

1) first cut Saxons at the Smithy
2) Siegfried bringing the Dragon back to Bergen.
3) the lady saying she would be a pagan again just for tonight
4) Kremheld confessing her love for Siegfried to Hagen.

My question is, why did they make these cuts for the American version of the DVD.  Also, why did they change the title from, ring of the nibelungs?

I believe the DVD is still worth having, but it only gets four stars because of the edits.",1143590400,97,1071,4.252475247524752
2224006,4,B0007OCG5Q,"I wasn't disappoined with this movie since I wasn't expecting too much.  However, it should be said that the ""Saga of the Volsungs"" and ""the Nibelungenlied"" are my two favorite books.

What I like about the ""Nibelungenlied"" is the giant battle at the end when Siegfried's widow gathers an army of vengeance to avenge her lover.

""Volsungs,"" though, explains the character of Kriemhilde much better than ""Nibelungenlied.""

In either case, you have to read both books to appreciate the story of Siegfried/Brunhilde.

Anyways, there are parts in this movie where it deviates from both books - and in my opinion, it did a FAIRLY good job with it (considering it was made for television).

There are very weak aspects of the movie though:

1) The BIGGEST weakness of this movie was the casting of Siegfried.  Whether you know him as Sigurd of Siegfried, the initial hero of the story is supposed to be a massive, courageous and ""manly"" hero - the actor they casted for this movie has a tiny stature and smiles way too much to be a tough guy.  And the script (whether improvised or not) turns Siegfried/Sigurd into a wise-cracking comedian.  This completely mutilates any pre-conceived notions you've had of Siegfried/Sigurd.

2) This movie only deals with the ""Nibelungenlied"" up until the point where he dies.  The old German silent film, ""Die Nibelungen,"" actually divides the movie into two parts: ""Siegfried"" and ""Kriemhilde's Revenge.""

3) In truth, this movie feels more like the ""Saga of the Volsungs"" than the ""Nibelungenlied.""  Because of that, we don't awesome introduction of Siegfried commanding his way into the domain of the Burgundians.  We also don't get the awesome battle at the end where Hagen, Gunther and everyone pretty much dies in a giant battle.

Anyways, if you're a fan of Volsungs/Nibelungenlied, you should definitely check this movie out (if you've already seen the German silent films based on the same subject-matter).  The actress who plays Kriemhilde does an awesome job - exactly the way I envisioned her.",1143590400,4,2035,5.008928571428571
2224007,4,B0007OCG5Q,"As a German student, I was forced to suffer through Nibelungenslied in its original Germanic.  Now, years later, I have finally come to appreciate the tale, and I must say I applaud Sci-Fi for the wonderful job it did!

There are deviations from the original story, of course, but they do nothing to change the over-all story.  Watching this movie is akin to watching Romeo & Juliet: there is nothing like seeing a favorite play or classical story (in this case both) unfold before your eyes!

At last, non-German students can appreciate the story!

I had to subtract a star for your typical sci-fi special effects.  I can't be too harsh, though, because there are some real gems hidden in the story.  The dragon, for example, falls along mediocre, but the animators put a lot of trouble into giving the dragon a special ""pocket"" which it must open in order to blow fire.  Beautiful and creative!",1143590400,3,896,4.698717948717949
2224008,4,B0007OCG5Q,"Much of what Sci-Fi shows is well below average in my opinion. There are rare but great exceptions; e.g. Dune. I find that frustrating as someone who has read/watched science fiction for 50 years.

It is in that spirit that I watched Dark Kingdom on the Sci-Fi channel. Having seen the entire Wagner Ring Cycle (yes, it can be survived), I immediately looked for the pieces that made up that tragedy.

Atmospheric photography, great costuming, some odd bits of martial arts weaponry (Brunhilde used very familiar Bo staff techniques) and pretty good special effects were big wins.

Acting by Kristanna Loken, Alicia Witt and Julian Sands was quite good. Julian as the good king being slowly drawn into more evil deeds was nicely handled (a transition George Lukas can't quite manage).

Still, the whole background of the Nibelung seemed only loosely attached to the story. Same vague discussion of ghosts and their curse doesn't convey the depth of the original stories - nor the operas.

I give credit to those attempting to deal with this material and make it sensible in a relatively short period of time (go check out the times for the Wagner operas :). The dark ending is appropriate and consistent - though I'm not sure the moral lessons were apparent.

All in all - a really decent effort. Thumbs up on this one. Good fair for an evening fantasy ride - though probably not a purchase .",1143590400,5,1392,4.755186721991701
2224009,3,B0007OCG5Q,"Saw It on scifi channel. It started great. Story was good, great cast, effects and scenery were blockbuster worthy. I was expecting more on the second night. I know it was a classic hero myth, so I was already in the know as to the basic ending. The climax of the movie happened and it was all she wrote. The plot could have been expanded around the curse of the dragon gold. This sub plot could  actually be a prequel to the movie.

It's also a little strange that according to the the DVD description, the movie is 132 minutes. Sci-fi had it stretched over two nights. Which by my math is 240 minutes. Take an hour out for ads, it leaves 180 minutes. Either the movie was cut down for DVD or Scifi was clever in passing off a 90 minute movie as a miniseries. Blockbuter has a 212 minute PG-13 rated version of the same movie. circa 2004...hmmm

At the start I would compare it to LOTR by the end it was more akin to The 13th Warrior.",1143590400,2,935,4.183333333333334
2224010,4,B0007OCG5Q,"Overall I liked it a lot. The costumes, military kit and buildings were an odd mish mash of Renaissance and Medieval styles rather than Dark Ages as it theoretically should have been, but nothing SO bad that it jarred me right out of the story as routinely happens with Ameircan made fantasy or historical epics. At least the swords were in the ball park (fairly close to period weapons except for overly long grips)

I thought the acting and writing was fairly good as these things go, I enjoyed the twists and turns of the old story, some parts were actually laugh out loud funny such as when Brunhilda hog tied the Burgundian king and told him to be quiet on their wedding night. I liked how they highlighted and did not shy away from the whole pagan vs. christian theme. I also loved it when Brunhilda performed a decapitation...

I thought the fighting was fairly decent, much better than your typical Xena-esque Hollywood kung-fu with swords stuff, more swashbuckling and perhaps with a hint of historical European technique. There was a fight in the early part where Sigfried looked like he was doing some quasi-WMA moves with a staff or spear. The duel where both parties shields are broken was good to see as well, reminiscent of dozens of such duels you read about in the Norse sagas.

The casting was good, which is of critical importance in a piece like this. The actors particularly sigfried had a wierdly European enough look to me that they didn't come across as overly pretty models or call girls right out of Hollywood central casting.  No fantastic performances but no really jarringly awful ones either. I particularly enjoyed seeing Max Von Sidow in the role of the old blacksmith.

All in all I'd say a fun flick, good mood setting for any fantasy fan. Thats a lot coming from me, I even complained about LOTR",1143590400,11,1830,4.6532507739938085
2224011,4,B0007OCG5Q,"Though its budget is a mere drop in the water compared to films such as ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" ""Dark Kingdom"" is a rather well-made fantasy flick.  Since ""Rings"" was inspired by the legend that this film is based on, the viewer will notice a number of similarities between the two.  There are cursed ghosts who seek out a horde of gold that includes a very special ring, there's the standard story of destiny, plenty of swords and sorcery and, yes, deception.

The tale we are presented here is that of a young boy named Seigfried who is separated from his royal bloodline in a great battle.  He is found by a lowly blacksmith and renamed Erik.  He is raised to be a man of honor.  One night while discussing the gods of old and the new Christians, he receives a sign from the old gods that will eventually lead him to his destiny.  Without giving away much more, just know that he is the chosen love of a certain Icelandic queen and deception and treachery lead to the two meeting at a most unsavory time.

The cast is headed up by Benno Furmann as Seigfried.  He does a solid and convincing job as a young man torn between his newfound friends, gold, and the love of his life.  Julian Sands is sinister as Hagen, who is the advisor to King Gunther, superbly played by Samuel West.  In fact, West probably gives the best performance in the lot.  Alicia Witt plays Gunther's sister, who falls very hard for Furmann.  The Icelandic queen is played with rigid perfection by Kristanna Loken.  Also look for Robert Pattinson as Giselher, Witt and West's younger, adventure-hungry brother.  Fans of Harry Potter will recognize him as Cedric Diggory in ""Goblet of Fire.""

Special effects, considering the budget, are very good.  I especially thought that the FX crew pulled off the dragon rather well.

The music is also pretty good.  It moves the story along at a reasonable pace and builds tension as the deceptions begin to unravel.

This film is definitely worthy of a few looks.  If you're a huge fantasy/adventure fan, you might consider this to be a solid purchase.  It's also running on the SciFi channel this week, so you may want to watch there before plunking any hard-earned cash down for it.",1143504000,11,2231,4.58080808080808
2224012,3,B0007OCG5Q,"Compared to the region 2 DVD, where the film has 2 parts (as it was shown on European TV) and runs about 177 minutes in PAL (which equals 184 minutes in NTSC), this version was obviously cut by about 50 minutes. The title (UK: Ring of the Nibelungs) was also inexplicably changed, lest any U.S. viewers be put off by the similarity to the Wagner opera cycle. The fact is that the operas are based on the same source material, an ancient (about 800 year old) Germanic saga, similar to the British Beowulf legend and other myths. The ""Nibelungenlied"" has been filmed several times (there is even a silent movie version), but this latest TV adaptation has been updated to match the tastes of today's audiences. There is plenty of swordplay, some good special effects, and a fine story. Some younger viewers might be surprised that someone had ideas like that 750 years before Tolkien. Kristanna Loken is great to look at and quite adept at handling a sword. Since the cast is international (German, Swedish, America-Norwegian), there is a weird mix of accents, but apart from that, the movie is quite entertaining and deserves some recognition. The soundtrack is also good, and the DVD offers a decent 5.1 sound. The opening map places the action (as in the original saga) in Burgundy, a region that straddles today's border between France and Germany. The movie was shot in South Africa, although the landscapes are digitally made to resemble Scandinavian ones.",1142121600,179,1459,4.84

2224035,4,B0007OCG5Q,"Released to TV in 2004 at 184 minutes and originally titled ""Curse of the Ring"" or ""Ring of the Nibelungs,"" ""Dark Kingdom: The Dragon King"" runs 132 minutes on the shortened DVD, meaning its cut by 48 minutes. This is an ancient European tale going back 700-1500 years about a Scandinavian child of noble birth who is reared anonymously by a noble blacksmith (Max Von Sydow) and names him Eric (Benno Frmann). Eric miraculously meets and falls in love with the Queen of Iceland (Kristanna Loken) before slaying a dragon and becoming a king. Unfortunately, he can't marry his first love because a rival king and blood brother (Samuel West) manipulates him into marrying his beautiful sister (Alicia Witt). O what a tangled web we weave when at first we practice to deceive!

For a movie that originally aired on Sci-Fi (now SyFy), this is an impressive film. The casting, locations (South Africa), CGI, score and numerous sword-fighting scenes are all top-notch, especially for a TV movie, which explains that it was released theatrically in some areas. Although this is a fantasy sword & sorcery flick the tone is serious and realistic beyond the magical elements. Witt is likable and winsome while Loken is stunning and tough in a warrioress sense. Frmann is solid as the main protagonist, Eric/Siegfried, having the requisite noble looks. His fight with the dragon is outstanding and the creature looks formidable and frightening, to say the least.

The story struck me as very unique, but only moderately interesting. It could've been more compelling IMHO but, then again, I've only seen the shortened version. The cut scenes include: (1.) the Saxons at the smithy, (2.) Siegfried bringing the Dragon carcass back to Burgund, (3.) the lady saying she would be a pagan again just for tonight, and (4.) Kriemhild confessing her love for Siegfried (Eric) to Hagen, the house villain, played by Julian Sands. It's hard to believe that peripheral scenes like these could turn the movie into a captivating powerhouse, but I could be wrong. Nevertheless, the positives outweigh the negatives and this is a worth seeing if you have a taste for sword & sorcery.

2224065,5,B0007OCG5Q,"This movie, an edited-together mini-series, tells the story of Siegfried from Norse mythology. From the finding of the magic ring, the slaying of the dragon, to the love of Brnnhilde, the elements of the story are all there. But this is not just a dramatization of the Wagner opera; some interesting additions are made that really make the story stand on its own.

Some of the performances are a bit distracting to me, not really seeming like they fit the character, but overall, this is very well done and quite excellent for a made-for-TV mini-series.

If you're a fan of ancient mythology or medieval movies with dragons and sword fights, then it's time to fire up the popcorn maker and sit back, I think you'll enjoy this movie.",1361836800,,732,4.7109375

I would recommend it as an absolute MUST to all WAGNER afficionados. It must also be shown at RING festivals that are typically a week long.
Also, the price : what a bargain !!! I got it for less than a dollar. Incredible.

2224068,3,B0007OCG5Q,"I love good fantasy stories, particularly those that borrow from ancient mythology. The Nordic legend that inspired this one also contributed greatly to J.R.R. Tolkien's inspiration for The Lord of the Rings. As such, you will see numerous parallels and similarities.

When the kingdom is assaulted and burned to the ground by invading Saxtons, the king's only son is set adrift on a piece of wood down the river. He manages to survive that terrible night but never remembers what happened. Taken in by a local blacksmith, Siegfried (Benno Furmann) grows to be a fine swordsman. He catches the passing attention of Brunnhild (Kristanna Lken), Warrior Queen of Iceland, as she is passing through the territory on one of her hunting expeditions. The queen's seer has predicted that when the skies rain down fire, she will meet her match, the one man chosen to defeat her and become her equal. That night a meteor strikes the earth, and Brunnhild and Siegfried are both drawn to the site. They battle, make love, and declare their affection to one another before parting ways, with the promise to meet again.

Desirous of becoming worthy of his fair maiden, Siegfried journeys to the kingdom's central city with his father, in order to deliver new swords to the king and his knights. The neighboring territories are being terrorized by a mighty dragon that has recently awakened, and guards a cursed treasure deep within the craters of the earth. King Gunther (Samuel West) takes a battalion of knights to war against it, but his forces are destroyed. In his absence, Siegfried forges a sword from the meteor and sets out in secret to slay the dragon. What transpires thereafter sets in motion a series of events that involve deception, ghostly warnings, and the vow that whoever possesses the treasure will be brought to ruin. Not all legends have happy endings and this one doesn't either, but I was fascinated with the journey the miniseries took us on into another world, another time, a distant place in which magic still dwelled.

Some of the early battle scenes are painfully bad, but later hand to hand combat is quite impressive. Overall I found it an enjoyable way to spend several hours. There were so many aspects that reminded me of Tolkien's work -- a cursed ring, a dragon with a cave full of treasure, the people of the mist, a warrior woman, the queen a secret son of a king attempts to win over -- that for awhile it was difficult to settle into it, but it remains that Dark Kingdoms is a surprisingly well made and ambitious project, well worth your time if you're a fan of the genre.",1332892800,,2600,4.747787610619469
2224069,5,B0007OCG5Q,"It is a beautiful story about courage and love. I loved this movie you do not find one like this often.

2224070,5,B0007OCG5Q,"Story is about Wagners Ring Cycle but they could not use the title, Rig dus Nieblungin in the uS. Trust me it's a great film!!",1330300800,,126,4.08
2224071,5,B0007OCG5Q,"This movie, which looked like a Grade B, was on sale, and I guess I bought it because I saw it was about a Dragon and I thought it might be something my nephew would like. (I'm a Lord of the Rings fan myself and just MIGHT also enjoy, on the right rainy day, even a Grade B dragon story in a medieval setting such as this seemed to be.)  Well, when I first began to watch the movie, I was only halfway paying attention to it, and then I picked up the name of the dragon.  If it wasn't old Fafnir!  So, I began to pay more eager attention to this story set in the ancient Norse land.  After awhile, the story began to emerge as apparently ""The Ring of the Nibelungs""!  Oh, I thought, that must be why that strong, pretty warrior girl in this movie is named Brunhilde!  [But, I thought, it's strange that she isn't depicted as fat... I don't know if I can accept her as thin.]  From then on, I was very attentive to the movie, being as it was about such a famous myth.  And it turned out to be a really GOOD movie!  Wow.

The big thing that IS wrong with this movie is the title of it, which is all wrong for conveying what the great IMPORT of this story really is.  It is a variation of the famous Norse myth of the great Lasting True Love destined for Brunhilde and Seigfried but destroyed by dark sorcery and the curse of the Nibelung situation.  To a lesser extent, it is about the loves of King Gunter and of his sister Kreimhilde.  Also, by its own spoken definition at the finale, it is about the END of the mythic age of the pagan gods--and what an unforgettable ending it is.

And, oh, the undying love of Brunhilde! --And, oh the excellent love, too, of beautiful Kreimhilde.

I'll remember this movie.  And I'll also keep it to watch again sometime.  I rate it as Grade A.  It's certainly not Grade B.

I wouldn't recommend it for children.  It's for Mature Audiences only, in my estimation, because of the nudity and the extramarital love scene [which is fairly tame-by-modern-standards I guess] at the beginning of the story.  Otherwise, the movie is no more or less morally objectionable than LOTR would be--as far as I can recall.  There is some bloody violence, one beheading that is gruesome.

The actors are all outstanding in noteworthy performances.  I'm not sure I entirely liked Benno Furmann's idea to de-heroize Siegfried's character in so many instances; I'll have to try to decide about that when I watch the movie again later on.  I do like him anyway, though.  The characters of Brunhilde and Kreimhilde are played by actresses capable of meeting as equally strong, dignified, attractive  adversaries.  Kreimhilde is very pretty and creates a character who seems deeply honest, delicate, sensitive.  Her beauty is of a type that conveys a sense of lovely purity.  Brunhilde's character naturally conveys great strength and endurance.  Both of the women are sympathetic characters in their own different ways, both of them seem noble-hearted persons caught up in a tragic web of circumstances.  [In a sense, the two women represent the old pagan Age and the new Christian Age, but I don't think the director intended much strong symbolism in these characters on that point.]

It seems Max von Sydow, who played the fisherman stepfather of orphaned Siegfried, is always a fine actor who makes any part memorable.

The title of the movie is appropriate to the extent that the events of the story take place in a mythic age wherein sorcery and black magic play a large part in the plot, but this movie should not be construed as promoting sorcery, witchcraft, or ""Dark"" values.  It's unfortunate that the movie title does such a disservice to a fine film.

The sets and costumes are really authentic-looking, all very interesting to observe as recreations of the ancient Norse world.  The Dragon-boat at the bottom of the sea amidst the glittering, drowned, gold horde is the terrific image that opens and closes the film.

[Just parenthetically--and this is only a trivial note--but anybody who likes braided hair styles will have a feast for their eyes to enjoy here, especially at the court of King Gunter.]

The outdoor Winter Scene at the Castle of the Queen of Iceland [Brunhilde] is Very beautiful.  And the crucial contest between Brunhilde and Seigfried on the ice-lake is really unusual and remarkable.  Those scenes of the Ice Castle exterior were quite pleasing fantasy forms.  One of the best imagistic details of the film to my taste.",1329609600,,4470,4.634860050890585

It's fun and despite being a ""TV Movie"" it doesn't look cheesy. I only gave it four stars because it's set in the 5th century but Gunter lives in a stone castle.

2224075,5,B0007OCG5Q,"Max von Sydow has been in a large group of Sci-Fi / Fantasy films and although ""Dark Kingdom: The Dragon King"" may be given B movie status, there are some excellent players.  Benn Frmann is the dragon slayer; Kristanna Loken is the main heroine (quite obviously of Norse descent); Alicia Witt is the love torn princess; Samuel West is the despotic king; and the other champion of this film's making is the costumer and the set builders.  It is a tale as old as Viking mythology, spun upon the loom of Odin in Valhalla.  Fate and destiny, love and hate, friendship and betrayal, along with sorcery and a hoard of gold belonging to the Nibelungs - this story has a lot of elements to keep up with.  This is an action / adventure / romance that should have been built upon tenfold; and yet it seemed to die with a single epic presentation.  It was pared down from 3 hrs into 2, and known in other countries by other names such as ""Kingdom in Twilight,"" ""The Sword of Zanten,"" and ""The Curse of the Ring.""  This film is based upon the Nordic legends ""Der Ring des Nibelungen,"" and ""Vlsungasaga,"" and the German epic poem, ""Nibelungenlied.""  I can only imagine that this film would have outshone thousands of potential rivals, had ""Dark Kingdom: The Dragon King"" been R-rated instead of a made for TV movie.  In Germany and England, this movie fared better than it did in the USA; partially due to USA censorship choking, and in those other countries the story was well received enough to be made into theater playhouse performances.

(Also only cost me $8 including shipping). :)

Besides what others have written, unrequited romance dominates the storyline and rivets your eyes to the screen, needing to know what comes next! To whit, Xanten has one of the strongest female leads in Kristanna Loken of any fantasy movie ever.  She oozes chemistry and power, and her look just screams ""untamed.""  Alicia Witt provided a believable and passionate supporting actress as well.  And yes, for you guys out there they are both gorgeous. :D

The budget is not huge but big enough so it doesn't get in the way, and there is some excellent directing nonetheless.  Some of the scenes are actually quite beautiful and memorable, especially at the beginning and end.  The music is decent, and the story quite engaging and involving.  Characters progress and develop naturally, as one scene leads to the next and the story grows.  And the slower scenes are just as fascinating and fun to watch as the battle scenes, which is hard to achieve!

Without spoiling anything, if you're looking for light and happy family fantasy, keep in mind the entire movie centers centers around the cost of scheming to get what you want, so... I'll leave it at that.  I imagine for those familiar with the original legend you know that, but I'm not.

Sci Fi Channel screens it sometimes, but of course, just to irk fans, it usually winds up screening at 2:00 am!  But it was worth staying up late just to see the unedited version.  The plot is much better if you can see the unedited European version.  I wish Amazon would sell the Euro version 1 DVD and I'm going to check on UK Amazon if I can get that uncut DVD.

The acting is very good, nothing at all like the typical Sci Fi Channel made for TV miniseries stuff.  Julian Sands does a great job as the villian, without over acting - he gives a deliciously evil performance.  Alicia Witt is also very good as the Princess, Samuel West gives a dignified performance.

If you like sagas like Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Narnia, then this is for you.  The story line of Dark Kingdom matches the original Norse mythology story very closely, which surprised me because usually TV miniseries just toss in lots of sex, violence, heaving bosoms and tittilation to boost ratings.  This is a very classical rendition of the ancient Norse tale and mythology buffs will really enjoy it.

Very good production values, lots of ""action"" sequences, swordfighting and romance - so there is something for everyone - not just an action movie and not just romance - so it's a combination of ""chick flick"" with the fight scenes - nice balance - plus it's family fare that you can feel comfortable letting little kids watch - not too scary, not much violence, just lots of classical swordfighting.

Even though the Region 2 USA DVD is heavily edited, it's OK, but I highly recommend trying to get the European Region 2 DVD!",1199404800,2,1739,4.535256410256411
2224100,4,B0007OCG5Q,I watched this late at night and was pleasantly suprised that I actually enjoyed it. Nice movie if you are into the type of material presented.,1198886400,,143,4.538461538461538
2224101,4,B0007OCG5Q,"I watched this mainly because it looked a lot like The Mysts of Avalon, one of my favorite movies. It's got a lot of similarities: mainly the pagon way of life threatened to come to an end. In a nut-shell this is a tragic love story with some action thrown in. If you like Shakespear, you'll probably love this piece. I warn you, though, don't watch if you're wanting warm fuzzies.",1187827200,,381,4.380281690140845
2224102,3,B0007OCG5Q,"The story of Siegfried and the Dragon was one of the most important and well-known legends in northern Europe, as evidenced by the vast number of references found in the archaeological record, but the story has been mostly forgotten by the general public.  Everyone has heard of Achilles, but few people are familiar with Sigfried--or Sigurd as he was called in the Norse version of the tale--except those who study Norse mythology or German opera.  Finally the story is told in a format that's accessible to the common man.

The advertising claims this was the inspiration for Tolkien, but this story inspired many more than just him.  Richard Wagner goes without saying, but other stories like Grimm's classic Sleeping Beauty were obviously derived from Sigfried's saga as well, although that link isn't so obviously portrayed in this version.

I believe this was originally released as a mini-series on German television, then a year later on the Sci-Fi channel in the U.S.  The acting is about what you'd expect from a TV movie, most of it is okay but there are many weak points.  I suspect it's this weakness that earned it a less-than-stellar rating on IMDB.  I didn't find it too distracting the first time through, but on repeated viewings you notice more.  I still quite enjoy the movie, though.  The one notable exception for me was Kristana Loken, who played Brinhild (also the Terminator in T3).  She gave an excellent performance, and while of course Max Von Sidow always does an excellent job, Loken's performance was very memorable for me.

The worst thing about the movie is that this version is cut by about 50 minutes, as other reviewers have mentioned.  It's frustrating because the edits were completely unnecessary.  They cut the entire story of Prince Giselher and his developing relationship with Sigfried, along with some important scenes like Sigfried returning with the dragon's head.  The original contained many scenes where they explored the differences between Sigfried's pagan religion and Christianity--very respectfully to both sides, I might add--but they cut out all of that.  What's most frustrating is that this is the only version available in region 1 and I'm not aware of any efforts being made to release the original.  I'd almost say you should buy whatever version you can and then download the full version if you can find it, but I'm sure they'd say that isn't legal.

If you are interested in ancient European legends or Norse mythology then I would highly recommend this movie, despite its flaws.  If it inspires you to read the original tales, The Saga of the Volsungs or the Nibelungenlied, then all the better.  If you just want a fun fantasy movie then I'd also recommend it as it's better than much of the fantasy fair out there, although it doesn't compete with The Lord of the Rings.

I give it 3/5, docked a point because of the missing scenes.  The full-length version I would rate 4/5, if they would ever release it here.",1180656000,11,2978,4.878727634194831

2224110,2,B0007OCG5Q,"This movie was adequate.

What I would have to say about this movie overall is that some parts of it had potential.

The movie had great scenery and attention to costume design.  Some of the acting was superb (brunhild), while others I hated (Sigfried!  What kind of accent was that?  I just hated his character as well).

Also, I think the character brunhild was superb.  I loved her character design and personality very much, and it's a shame that she was paired with such a weak character like sigfried.  They should have had the movie based on her instead.

Sigfried was not how you would picture a hero at all.  He wasn't even an anti-hero.  All he cared about was himself and the only quality that in my mind made him a hero was his ""courage"" and ""strength.""

This movie starts out very badly and kinda unrealistically, but it gets more interesting towards the latter half (aka: when brunhild comes in) and ends on an unexpected and sorta unsatisfactory ending.",1166918400,2,968,4.629411764705883

2224113,3,B0007OCG5Q,"The Dark Kingom is one of the large spate of swordplay movies that have come out since the LOTR trilogy.  This one focuses on old Norse legends from the centuries just before the Middle Ages.  Siegfried just escapes the destruction of his father's kingdom and is adopted by a blacksmith.  He grows up to be a stout, smart, and athletic young man, and has a one night stand with Brunhild; queen of Iceland, that just happens to be the first time for each of them.  She goes back to her kingdom to await him.  He goes on to glory and to reclaim his father's kingdom.  But along the way, he takes treasure that is not his, and so begins a curse that ends his life and the life of Brunhild.

This DVD version is just over 2 hours long, and they go by fairly quick.  The action scenes are realistic enough; though nothing dramatic or awe-inspiring.  The sword fights are actually very good and Brunhild is quite impressive with a variety of weapons.  The dialogue is okay; nothing cheesy but nothing great.  The setting is wonderful, but not fully taken advantage of with great shots, hence the cinematography is alright.  The story itself is understandable, and quite similar to the Greek and Roman myths of high school class in terms of the emphasis on greed, pride, misplaced loyalty, jealousy, etc...

Some of the scenes do seem forced; especially the initial encounter between Siegfried and Brunhild.  The magic and wizardry is kept to a minimum, and the dragon seems somewhat weak.  To think about it practically, the dragon's body was 30 - 40 feet around.  Siegfried's sword is about 2 - 3 feet long.  For Siegfried to kill the dragon with one pierce into its chest is like a full grown man like me getting killed by a sowing needle poked into my chest; hardly possible given the size of the weapon in relation to the size of the victim.  But all in all, the movie is worth the 2+ hours of time to sit thru it.",1158969600,3,1912,4.476878612716763
2224114,3,B0007OCG5Q,"Dark Kingdom-The Dragon King brings to the screen the love story between the Queen of Iceland and the son of a blacksmith.  However, all is not what it seems in medieval Scandinavia...

On the positive side:

1) The clash between the old religion and the new is very interesting and the film could have and should have focused more on that.

2) The strong Norse, LOR and D&D setting (the time period, the scenery, the overall feeling) is great.

3) The costumes, the weapons, and the armor are all wonderful.

4) The magical items were amazing.

The major setbacks are in relation to:

1) The acting is average to poor.  Samuel West, especially, was not good at all in his role as King Gunther.  Alicia Witt, however, was delightful as Kriemhild, while Benno Furmann's Siegfried was just mediocre.

2) At times the dialogues are just weak.

3) The dragon looked like an iguana and not like a dragon!

4) There were times when the film went Xena (sloppy/amateur work) on us.

5) Siegfried was too similar to Achilles.

In short, the acting is average, the plot is interesting, while the dialogues are average and sometimes below average.

In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment.",1157500800,3,1272,4.6877828054298645

Unfortunately, Siegfried is enchanted by the Burgunds into forgetting his love, his life, and working for them.  Part of that work is acquiring a great treasure--and the bride for his 'blood brother' the Burgund King.

Overall, the story is interesting and reasonably well done. This particular version was cut from the original miniseries and I think suffers in some way from that.  Additionally, people who are fond of happy endings will not like this story very well.",1152057600,6,725,4.768

2224117,3,B0007OCG5Q,"I rented this on a whim, mainly because I love Norse/Germanic mythology and have the Siegfried legend virtually memorized. I knew that this was a TV movie, and so I began watching it expecting it to be idiotic. I was proved wrong--it wasn't idiotic, but it wasn't that great either. It was enjoyable entertainment, and I can't say I was disappointed, but it was a one-time-only watch for me.
Dark Kingdom freely mingles portions of Das Nibelungenlied (Middle High German, 12th or 13th century) with the Volsungsaga (Icelandic) and some other sources, Wagner in particular. My favorite of the Siegfried legends is the one in Das Nibelungenlied, and the middle 3/5 of this movie follows that pretty closely, condensing the timeline from at least a decade to the space of a week or so--what I call ""Troy syndrome.""
The picture and sound quality are both good. The image is always clear and sharp. This isn't a cheap-looking film by any means.
The acting is capable, but nothing special. Benno Frmann's turn as Siegfried was okay, but his accent was distracting. I understand how difficult it is to act in a second language (I've done it, and it's hard), but he seemed to have a difficult time modulating his voice correctly. He did seem to enjoy the part, though, and gave his Siegfried wit and energy which were fun to watch.
Finding out now that about 50 minutes was cut from the film is enlightening. I wouldn't mind seeing an uncut version of this someday--perhaps it'd make more sense. The other reviewers seem to think so, and I'm inclined to agree.

However, the biggest reason to buy this DVD are not the FX.  Rather, it is a solid story although albeit a wee bit corny in a few spots.  A refreshing aspect is that it indulges in Nordic mythology, which is very welcome.

Even more important than the story is the cast.  Benno F?rmann is great portraying the motif of the hero of noble blood who is raised as a commoner.  Kristanna Loken is PERFECT as the Viking queen!  Her Scandavian ancestery / complexion, her athletic prowess and her acting ability all combine to make her an obvious choice in this movie.  The casting department should get serious kudos for landing her!

2224124,5,B0007OCG5Q,"The evil twin kings kill young Prince Siegfried's entire family; he is then rescued by the kindly blacksmith Eyvind (wonderfully portrayed by the brilliant Max von Sydow). The young lad (who has forgotten his past) is now called Eric and has been superbly raised by his kindly new father to be a strong and honorable adult. Incidentally, he is also a talented swordsman. Eventually he meets and falls in love with Brunhild, the beautiful Valkyrie warrior queen and they both forge an impenetrable sword/spear from a meteorite that falls from the sky. Eric travels to Burgund, where he meets King Gunther and slays the dragon that has been terrorizing the kingdom.  Naturally he now remembers his past and becomes King Siegfried.

Of course battles, spells, potions, romance, jealousy, greed and betrayals ensue which turns the story into a delightful and entertaining movie. I thought the casting was excellent; the German/Swedish accents made me feel like I was watching real Vikings. During our introduction of King Gunther, I kept thinking he was horribly miscast--he didn't look regal with his beady eyes but guess what, he ended up acting just like he looked!

I really enjoyed watching this movie.

2224125,5,B0007OCG5Q,"The Sci Fi Channel recently aired the excellent mini-series, Dark Kingdom: Dragon King.  This is a moving and beautifully done remake of the classic legend The Ring Of The Nibelungs.

The cast included: Benno F&uuml;rmann as Eric/Siegfried, Kristanna Lken as Brunhild, Alicia Witt as Kriemhild, Samuel West  as King Gunther, Julian Sands as Hagen, Max Von Sydow as Eyvind, Robert Pattinson as Giselher, and more. This strong cast had a chemistry that effectively brought this Germanic/Nordic legend to life.

Coming down in time to us from the Nordic ""Volsunga Saga"" and Germanic myth ""Das Nibelungenlied"", this is the legend of a Blacksmith who slays a dragon and becomes a King, as well as being one of the greatest yet tragic love stories ever told - that of Siegfried and Brunhild. Although this retelling changes Brunhild, who was originally Odin's favorite Valkyrie into a mortal but Amazonian Queen of Iceland, this didn't stray too far from the inspirational legends.

The story is told mainly from Siegfried's point of view, with Brunhild on the peripheral (I remember the legends as being told mainly from Brunhild's side). Escaping an onslaught led by twin barbarian kings, young Prince Siegfried is taken in by kindly blacksmith Eyvind, who changes the boy's name to Eric to save him from the twin king's search. Eyvind raises Eric as his own son. Fate steps into Siegfried/Eric's life when a meteorite brings him and Brunhild together for the first time. Although she returns home to Iceland, the two are never very far apart in spirit, and he vows to go to Iceland and win her.

In the interim, Eric travels to Burgund, which is being ravaged by the dragon Fafnir, who has a legendary horde of gold. Eric forges a sword from the metal left by the meteor the night he met Brunhild, and uses it to slay Fafnir. He bathes in the dragon's blood, making himself invincible. But then, is visited by the Nibelungs, the People of the Mist, who claim the treasure. When Eric takes the Ring as the treasure's rightful owner, the Nibelung inform him there is a curse on any who takes even one piece of the treasure. Eric ignores this warning.

Hailed as a hero, Eric leads a battle between Burgund and the Twin Kings, then is awakened to his true identity as a King in his own right. But then the plotting begins. The King Gunther and his advisor Hagen want to keep Siegfried tied to the house of Burgund, and plot to have Siegfried marry the King's sister, Kriemhild. Siegfried's wine is laced with a potion to make him love the princess, and forget about Brunhild. Then King Gunther announces his desire to wed Brunhild himself, and asks for Siegfried's help in winning the deadly contest Brunhild has set in place. That's when things truly start getting twisted. Let's just say Fafnir was the easiest, most benign challenge the young hero faces in his life. At least with the dragon, you know where you stand and what dangers you're really facing. Much preferable to slimy treachery!

Of course, The Crowgrrl especially loved the ravens in the movie. (OK, I'm a corvidophile!) There were ravens depicting Huginn and Muninn, Odin's own messengers, and one that was a messenger/familiar of Brunhild. OK, the pet falcon of Burgund was pretty cool, too.
