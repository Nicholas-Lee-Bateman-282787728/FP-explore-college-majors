Bob Bitchin; Courtney Haas what it was like out to sea on Bobs sail boat",1377475200,,117,4.363636363636363
8084800,5,B000BBSA2I,"Who am I? I lived aboard a sailboat for 15 years, so let me say right here, these folks are the real deal.

Having said that, okay, I admit I'm disappointed. The raison d'etre of Lats and Atts was getting out there and doing it. And they do. My problem is with the boat reviews. These folks are schizo. One minute boat bum, the next Cruising World. Still and all it's a pretty cool show. It has a real down home feel to it. While they review gold-plated yachts, they sail with others who are just like you and me - average people living the dream.

Buy this and enjoy, get motivated, then, darnit, go sailing!",1329350400,,609,4.241379310344827
