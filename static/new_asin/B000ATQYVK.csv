2393774,4,B000ATQYVK,"I'm so excited!! And it comes out on my birthday!!! Awhile back I found out that there was a TV movie ""Once Upon A Mattress"" but it was over 30 years old so I knew I wouldn't be able to rent it. Then I was wandering around Amazon and I found this one. I sure hope it's good. I can't wait.",1134000000,,288,3.737704918032787
2393775,4,B000ATQYVK,"I remember seeing this on TV years ago when TV was often live. Carol played Princess Fred then, and I am looking forward to seeing what she does as the Queen. The score is wonderful. One of the best is ""I'm in Love With a Girl Named Fred."" This version should be pretty good.",1133827200,,275,4.111111111111111
2393796,3,B000ATQYVK,"Not in love with the show, but the production was colorful and well-done. Carol Burnett is all you'd expect her to be, and Tommy Smothers was a nice surprise. Also, for them what are going through GLEE withdrawal, behold Pretty Teacher Guy.",1507593600,,240,4.738095238095238
2393797,5,B000ATQYVK,This is an old movie.  Was funny and a pleasant way to spend an evening.  Fun for adults. Kids liked it too.,1505001600,,108,3.8636363636363638
2393798,4,B000ATQYVK,"Not quite as good as the original with Carol Burnett as Winifred, but still a funny and entertaining story and Carol makes a good Queen.",1501977600,,136,4.48
2393799,4,B000ATQYVK,A little too campy a version for my tastes.  Bob Mackie's over the top costumes on Carol Burnett make her look like Malificent from the Disney movie. Tracy Ullman was marvelously charming.,1501804800,,188,4.875
2393800,5,B000ATQYVK,"Carol Burnett is one of the best, funniest actresses of all time.

2393824,5,B000ATQYVK,Cast is fabulous. Appropriate for entire family (references to a princesses' pregnancy are handled well and no questions were asked from my elementary school children).,1485388800,,168,5.76

2393826,3,B000ATQYVK,"I remember it being more funny. Too much sex talk and crude language. I'm still a Carol Burnett fan, but I won't be watching this with kids as I had originally planned.",1482019200,,168,4.28125
2393827,5,B000ATQYVK,"We love this show, and recently found the original production, with Carol playing the Princess! Wonderful 'bookend' productions!",1481932800,,128,6.166666666666667
2393828,5,B000ATQYVK,I loved this when I saw a while ago and got this for my children. It was a huge hit - I mean seriously - it is Carol Burnett and Tracy Ullman! What could be better!! And the fact that Carol Burnett played the princess and now the Queen is just wonderful! Edward Hibbert is a hoot! Wonderful for the whole family!!,1480982400,,313,4.064516129032258
2393829,4,B000ATQYVK,"Love Carol, but it isn't exactly the stript. Leaves songs and some dialogue out, while some were added.",1478995200,,103,4.777777777777778
2393830,5,B000ATQYVK,"Great show, but I really wish the version with Carol Burnett as Winifred was available somewhere.  I bought the cast recording CD with her as Winifred, but have been unable to find the ""original"" on VHS/DVD/BluRay.  If anyone can recommend somewhere I could get it, I would be eternally grateful!!",1478649600,,297,4.92

2393879,5,B000ATQYVK,"One of the great musicals. I was fortunate to see the original tv version, with Carol Burnett as the princess, and it was great. Now she is the queen, and it is also fine! Zoe DeChanel, Tracey Ullman are all fine. Tom Smothers is great in his role also.",1454198400,,253,4.183673469387755

2393896,5,B000ATQYVK,"Hilarious. Fun family film, especially for tweens and teens in the family.  This version features Carol Burnett as the queen (she originally played the role of the princess on Broadway and for the first t.v. production). Tracy Ullman does a wonderful job as the princess. Tom Smothers has an understated role which he plays so well. Denis O'Hare is great. Music is fun and lively. It's the kind of movie that entertains and leaves you smiling but isn't sappy or overly romantic. Just enough love story to keep you interested. Moves along and isn't too long.",1447977600,,557,4.802083333333333
2393897,5,B000ATQYVK,As much fun as my family remembered,1447372800,,35,4.142857142857143
2393898,3,B000ATQYVK,"I enjoyed the characters very much - sassy, rascal of a queen; silent, patient king; dauntless, the prince heir; and the princess Fred;  good dance and song routines throughout; surprise ending in an expected sort of way.  I am troubled about the `cheating' suggestion - especially for the children watching the show, although I understand the local princesses are in a pickle due to the unfair ""marriage law"" which has become a burden for marriageable single young women and available male suitors.",1445385600,,499,5.073170731707317

2393901,5,B000ATQYVK,"Have been trying for a long time to get the CBS version with Carol Burnett as the princess.  YouTube has it, but it's all grainy.",1441670400,,129,4.16
2393912,5,B000ATQYVK,"This production is so terrific.  The editing, the sound and more so the voices of the starts in the show.  Who knew that Tracy Ulman could sing?",1440028800,,144,4.296296296296297
2393913,4,B000ATQYVK,Great music and talent but not very kid appropriate,1439769600,,51,4.777777777777778

2393916,5,B000ATQYVK,"Absolutely hilarious! I read a lot of comments about this film, and I think that the prince and princess are old on purpose, it just goes to show how obsessive/doting the queen was.",1438646400,,181,4.515151515151516
2393917,3,B000ATQYVK,"Eh, I enjoyed it but I like weird things.",1438300800,,41,3.6666666666666665

2393920,5,B000ATQYVK,"When I feeling down, I put this on, and laugh.  It's kooky, and just the thing to get me out of a sad mood!  Carol Burnett-? It doesn't get any better. She's in her element here; Tracy Ullman-?  What a stitch!  She, too, is perfect for her part as the crazy, funny, intelligent young woman vying for the ""hand"" of the s'mothered Prince.  I back up a few times just to watch ""the dance"" and the expressions of the characters' faces as the dance goes on and on.  Denis O'Hare, Zooey Deschanel, Matthew Morrison, the lovable Tommy Smothers...I think it's a great movie.  Sometimes stories without a ton of depth or thought-provocation are just plain great entertainment.
Was it fun? and funny ..........YES
Good Story?......................... YES
Good Acting?........................ ABSOLUTELY  (It's supposed to be exaggerated characters!  It's a fairy tale, for crying out loud!)
That's entertainment!",1434412800,4,902,5.165517241379311
2393921,4,B000ATQYVK,While I would much rather be able to see Carol Burnett in her original role as the princess in this delightful twist on the well known fairy tale of the princess and the pea. Her performance as the Queen shines alongside the many other magnificent performances in this whimsical musical comedy.,1433721600,,294,4.784313725490196

2393945,4,B000ATQYVK,It was wonderful to see the show.  I had grown up listening to the LP recording with Carol Burnett as Winnifred.  I saw that there were changes to the story but did not detract from the fun of it all.,1430611200,,200,3.975

2393963,4,B000ATQYVK,Carol Burnett is funny regardless.  The video is fine.  It wasn't what I remembered from t.v. long ago that had the 'Cracker Jack' guy and Burnadette Peters in it.  But I guess they haven't made that one available.  It is still a good watch.,1421884800,,241,4.409090909090909

2394018,5,B000ATQYVK,Purchased movie for my daughter's birthday.  What a great movie for the whole family. Carol Burnett is at her comic best as the nasty queen.,1401926400,,140,4.6
2394019,5,B000ATQYVK,"This is an Excellent and very Fun Musical to watch. Carol Burnett is excellent as 'Queen Aggravain'. You can feel her egotistical attitude about herself and jealousy of letting go of her son Prince Dauntless (Denis O'Hare). I would love to have seen the original Broadway Theater production (1959) which had Carol Burnett playing the part of 'Princess Winnifred'. In this movie, Tracy Ullman does a magnificent job in playing the role of 'Princess Winnifred'. Her energy and body language is a fantastic joy to watch and root for. Side Note: Tommy Smothers (of the Smothers Brothers) Plays 'King Sextimus'. In real life, Tommy Smothers was known as an expert with yo-yo tricks. I think he was a proponent for yo-yos from the Duncan Yo-Yo Company",1400716800,,745,4.920634920634921
2394020,3,B000ATQYVK,"I like this play, but this version was a wee bit disappointing.  Love Tracy Ullman,  but she was horribly miscast here.  Carol Burnett is an institution.  The woman can do no wrong.  Funny to see Zoey Deschanel, and Matthew Morrison so young.",1398729600,,242,4.666666666666667
2394021,4,B000ATQYVK,"My wife has been after me for a few weeks to see ""Once Upon a Mattress.  I had seen the stage play, back in the late 1960's (I think), and enjoyed it, but wasn't fired up to see the movie.
Well, I am so glad we rented it from Amazon!  It is a really great musical commedy...and my wife knew the words to EVERY SONG!  Man, was I impressed.  I went around singing ""I'm in love with a girl named Fred,""  for a couple of days.
Great Fun...and I didn't recognize Tommy Smuthers, till the end.
Try it...You're sure to laugh a lot!

2394032,4,B000ATQYVK,"I really enjoy this musical. They did a great job keeping the musical feel while making it a film. The lead is not much to look at and makes the chemistry between her and the prince a little awkward. Loved the casting of everyone else, especially Bernadette. She's a hoot!",1395705600,,272,4.46

All the other players are superb as well, and I mean all of them.  It is rare to see a production that is so perfectly cast down to the last person.

The ""feel"" of this show is definitely intact and any non-professional group would do well to have this recording on hand to show your own cast members what you're striving for.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that there are numbers in this version of the show that are left out from the original.

2394100,4,B000ATQYVK,"I don't understand how one could think the songs are not memorable.

 I played the Prince (Dauntless) many decades ago. I still find myself singing Normandy (it's fine and fair!) and can never get rid of the ""I'm in Love With A Girl Named Fred"" from my gray matter. I enjoyed being in this whimsical musical. The only hitch was when my wireless mike fell between my legs (my tights). I simply rolled it up and put it in my tights. The director told me later that when I did that, did I notice the huge laugh from the audience. I said no, not really. He said while I was putting the mike in my tights, my line was something like ""come and see me in the tower.""

Anyway, as you can tell, this musical has great memories for me. I found this production a bit sparse compared to the original, but it brought back great memories and some of the most singable songs I know. And of course, Carol Burnett is her genius self. The lovers were not the centerpiece they should be and yes, The Jester was one of the main personalities in the original, missing in this production.

But, it's TV and again, glad to find this production.

2394123,5,B000ATQYVK,"Once Upon a Mattress is a 2005 Disney live-action musical adaptation of the 1959 Broadway hit and based on the popular fairy tale The Princess and the Pea. In this story, the beautiful but diabolical Queen Aggravain(Carol Burnett) does her darndest to prevent her son Prince Dauntless(Denis O'Hare) from getting married, therefore, the entire kingdom cannot be wed until the Prince does, and that makes life miserable for Sir Harry(Matthew Morrison) and his sweetheart Lady Larken(Zooey Deschanel). Then one day, an unusual and unconventional princess named Winifred(Tracey Ullman), or ""Fred"" for short, has arrived, and soon, Dauntless is swooned by ""Fred"". so Aggravain will do anything to stop the wedding, so she put ""Fred"" to a test, by letting ""Fred"" sleeping on twenty mattresses for one night, but there's a catch, The ever-scheming Queen placed a pea inside the bedding. Tom Smothers, Edward Hibbert and Michael Boatman also stars in this wonderfully hilarious comedy. The special features includes a behind-the-scenes look of the movie, a blooper reel featuring on-set laughs and sneak peeks of other Disney favourites like the Proud Family Movie, Kronk's New Groove and Valiant.

The music is catchy and nearly all the songs are unique and fun. This is a excellent adaptation of the classic musical and short enough for family movie night, as the 90 minute run time is perfect to maintain the attention of all family members.

2394131,1,B000ATQYVK,"Taking a fairy tale which might require 5 or 10 minutes to read and expanding it into an hour and a half musical is a real stretch. The simple story of the search for a true princess is overshadowed by a pregnant girl friend, a mute king and an adult prince who eats dessert sitting on his mother's lap. Top it off with random interjections of song and dance, and if you make it through to the end (I did), you probably won't do it again (I won't).",1261526400,2,448,4.1022727272727275

However, I'm surprised that the show is cut considering how identified Carol Burnett is with this show.  I saw a UCLA production a few years back that was directed by Ms. Burnett that was extremely faithful to the original so I'm surprised she agreed to the changes.  Maybe this was due to the Disney release which basically cut some of the racier (and funnier)stuff.  Oh well, missed opportunities.  What left is pretty faithful, beautifully produced, and has some excellent performances.  Buy it and have some fun.  However, see a stage performance if you want to see the whole thing.",1250553600,,716,4.80327868852459
2394143,5,B000ATQYVK,"Disney brings the 1959 off-Broadway-to-Broadway hit retelling of The Princess and the Pea back to the small screen with their 2005 feature adaptation of ""Once Upon a Mattress"", and if you're a fan of musical fairytales at all, you should be fully delighted by it! Carol Burnett is back in the cast too, only now she takes up the role of controlling Queen Aggravain, who refuses to accept any princesses vying for her son's hand as worthy to marry the not-getting-any-younger prince. Denis O'Hare plays Prince Dauntless to manchild perfection here, evoking thoughts of the great Ken Berry, while modern comedy queen Tracey Ullman aptly takes up the role living legend Burnett originated, the ungraceful but winning Princess Winnifred. Also on hand in this well-cast version are charming Tom Smothers as the silent King Sextimus, cursed to be mute until ""the mouse devours the hawk"", Michael Boatman as the Jester who speaks for him, Edward Hibbert as the Wizard who assists the Queen in her schemes, and Matthew Morrison as Sir Harry and the beautiful Zooey Deschanel as Lady Larkin, a couple who must help the prince finally wed so that they may get married themselves. You see, there is a law in the land that no one can marry until the prince does, even though the Queen seems dead-set against that, and this is especially bad for Lady Larkin, who now finds herself a mother-to-be.

And that last plot point illustrates that there is a tad bit of raciness to this story for something carrying the Disney moniker, let alone a musical fairytale as such. Nevertheless, it isn't overplayed, in my opinion (you might have to be a Disney fanatic like myself to achieve any initial shock by it at all), and in truth, as much as I adore Zooey and her singing voice (she and her voice are as lovely as can be in this one), she and Morrison seem to fall into the background a bit upon initial viewings, surrounded by such bold, comedic personalities in the other roles. This film is definitely for fans of Burnett, Ullman, and O'Hare, who are a treat throughout. The songs are all very enjoyable too, and while they are not instantly memorable, some repeat viewings will surely cause some to stick for you, and this IS a film one can watch over and over. It's not one of the most oft performed shows in the country for nothin'! So, if you are a fan of musicals, fairytales, or anyone in this cast, and especially if you grew up on those old Cannon Movie Tales from the '80's Disney Channel as I did, you really should pick this one up! I don't think you'll regret it! Bonus features on this enhanced widescreen DVD include a nice Making-Of featurette with some insight into the play's history, some Behind the Scenes outtake footage, and a couple of rehearsal to film comparisons of the musical numbers ""Shy"" and ""In a Little While"". Now, I have read some complaints about songs from the original play not being included in this TV incarnation, so there is the downside that will appear for some longtime fans, but if you are new to the show, it won't be a problem and you'll be in for a well-paced, entertaining fairytale treat that so many of us missed on its quiet TV and DVD debuts!",1240099200,,3178,4.624778761061947

Very focussed on making Carol Burnett (The Queen) the star, when the PRINCESS is the star of the show in the original stage production. However, good acting, great scenery and costumes - pity some of the original funny dialogue from the other characters and some songs were cut to make Ms. Burnett look good!

Disappointing",1237161600,,481,6.741935483870968
2394146,5,B000ATQYVK,Excellent theatric style performance.  Allows drama students the opportunity to view theater style action while watching a film.  The story is the same which is nice and easy to follow.  Fun to see Carol Burnett in the role as the Queen vs the princess.  I prefer her original work as the princess as that was her catalyst to fame.  Tracy Ullman was outstanding and I didn't see enough of Tommy Smothers.,1234396800,,404,4.633802816901408
2394147,3,B000ATQYVK,"Having this version of the musical is great but it can't compare to the one that was broadcast some years back with Ms Burnett as Princess Winnifred.  As I remember the cast consisted of Burnadette Peters as Lady Larken and Jack Gilford as the silent king.  Those two stand in my memory with the rest of cast up to the material. I think that the song ""I'm Shy"" backed by Ms. Burnette's lung power is one of the great pieces of comic theater. It would be great if it would come out on DVD so we could compare the two.",1234051200,,516,4.15
2394148,2,B000ATQYVK,"I've really fallen in love with this musical. I have to say that I was really disappointed when I realized some of the best gags, and a few songs were completely left out of this film version. Overall, though, this film captures most of the spirit and of the stage version and featured some good cast selections. I'm not quite sure why they thought Tracy Ullman looked young enough to play Princess Winnifred, but she does a great job. Carol Burnett is awesome as the Queen, and she really steals the whole show.",1229385600,,512,4.516129032258065
2394149,3,B000ATQYVK,"Flat out goofiness really makes this movie. The over-protective, over-possessive queen, blandly ineffectual king, and infantile prince give plenty to work with. Then, when Winnifred shows up as a contender for the ""princess"" role, there's a new force to contend with. Much to the queen's dismay, Winnifred (or ""Fred"" as the prince calls her) might actually pass the unpassable tests that stand between Fred and her son.

Nearly 50 years ago, when this fist came out, it must have been daring adult entertainment. Now, when even a VP-candidate's daughter starts her family before marriage, I'd say it's kid-safe for most households. It still gets laughs from the grown-ups, too. Go ahead - enjoy the silliness!

If you know of anyone or website that does screenplays, I would be most interested in finding out.

I did forget that there was a couple of songs that was left out, such as the Minstrel's song and the song about Normandie.  That too was disappointing.",1221436800,,528,4.447916666666667

I thought it was entertaining, well-cast and not overacted. Delightful dance numbers, too. Tracey Ullman isn't always my cup of tea, but she doesn't overdo her role here and is charming. I thought the whole cast was fine, and it was nice to see Carol Burnett in a role that suited her. Denis O'Hare is perfect as the prince.

I know the score very well and they included most of the songs, though I wish they had left in the jester's song. Kathleen Marshall as choreographer/director can be wonderful or just professional but here she captures just the right tone--the film is not too precious or too broad; instead  she evokes a sweet, off-kilter and gently humorous world.",1208736000,,794,4.545454545454546

2394166,2,B000ATQYVK,"Everything about the show had a lot of promise, but promises weren't kept. I feel the show had 3 fatal flaws wich ultimately ruined the chance to immortalize a wonderful, hilarious play.

#1: The movie was directed by a choreographer. While the dancing is great, the life of the show comes from the comedy. I felt like the show was absolutetly stripped of the natural comedy in the origional script.

#2: The movie was made 8-year-old-child friendly. A vast majority of the humor that derives from the origional script (which they completely hashed for their PG rating) was without ambiguation geared towards an adult audience.

#3: The casting needed some serious help.  Just by listening to the 1997 Broadway Revival Cast recording, you could tell what the Broadway show had that the movie didn't: Talent, and Emotion.

All in all I'm a little sad that I devoured 14.50$ plus shipping on this movie. I couldn't find it to rent it anywhere, so now it will probably just sit and collect dust on my shelf. Like I say, it had the chance to be great, but missed it.",1181606400,2,1062,4.657754010695188

Too bad a black and white version of the 1950's stage production isn't available.  Once Upon the Mattress has great lyrics and great stars, but this version falls flat as a pancake.  It has no energy.  I can't stand the trashy Vegas style costuming of the queen.  The rest of the costuming is beautiful.  Perhaps the beautiful set design is too similar to the costuming as it all seems to blend together.  Nothing stands out.

2394169,2,B000ATQYVK,"Disappointed, disgusted, disparaged, and that was just within the first 15 minutes.

Oh, and the first 15 minutes were probably the best 15 minutes of the movie!  Productions meant for the stage don't always translate well to the screen, but that shouldn't have been the case with this show.  It shouldn't have been!  An excellent cast, yes, but that still didn't save this one.  The most captivating character in the show SHOULD have been Princess Winifred, but in an attempt to not play it exactly like Carol Burnett had in the '60s, Tracey Ullman was often rather dull in the role.  She was likable, but still dull.  The choice of Carol Burnett as the Queen was poor because she's a show stealer, and obviously was going to detract from Princess Winifred.  Zooey Deschanel as Lady Larken was charming, among other characters, but that still didn't save it for me.

The worst thing about this production of Once Upon a Mattress was the filming of it.  Way too many close ups.  Made for T.V. musicals, in my opinion, look better if they are still represented more in the fashion of stage musicals--not so many close ups!  85% of this movie was a close up!

And just in case you're wondering.... Parents, if you're looking to buy this one for your kiddies just because it's made by Disney--think again!  It may be relatively subtle, BUT this movie musical is about sex.

I can make only two positive comments about this production...

1.  Zooey Deschanel was great.

2.  Costumes and sets very colorful--beautiful!

2394170,2,B000ATQYVK,"For anyone who loves the original Broadway cast recording, this DVD version fails miserably in all departments.  It is miscast, badly directed, and boringly choreographed.  The role of the Princess needs a belter.  That's the whole core of this musical.  Ullman is not a belter and is also too old for the part.  The supporting roles seemed to be scaled to her inadequacies, as we are also served a middle-aged, dull and pathetic Prince Dauntless.  As for the young lovers, they were dull to begin with, so they come out fine.  Curiously, Carol Burnett whose debut performance in the original shot her to stardom, is less than impressive as the Queen.  While the part does invite some ripe overplaying, unlike the lady in the original Broadway cast who managed to bring a little subtle fun to the role, Ms Burnett has about as much subtlety as Godzilla and her overbearing presence actually unbalances this already weak production.  As she chews up the scenery (which looks like styrofoam, anyway)and forcibly intrudes on scenes she wasn't meant to be in, one gets the unpleasant feeling that, despite relinquishing the starring role, Ms Burnett still has the urge to dominate.  What is it with these hitherto wonderful funny ladies in later life?  (Think Lucille Ball in ""Mame"").  All their innate skills appear to become subordinate to a manic ego.  And believe me, I'm a Carol Burnett fan about everything she did until this!  My two stars are for the delightful score, which even this lousy treatment doesn't quite diminish.

2394186,3,B000ATQYVK,"My first question is Why? Why bother going to such expense and effort to bring this old chestnut to the screen (TV, that is)? It was never a GREAT musical to begin with. But on the other hand, I'm glad they did, because, as a former musical director, I have conducted and played this show several times. The last time was over 30 years ago, so it was wonderful to see and hear it again after all this time.

There have been complaints that the songs aren't memorable. (One reviewed didn't like them so he/she fast-forwarded through them. That's a wonderful way to get to know a song!) The songs are indeed memorable, and quite tuneful. Mary Rodgers, Richard's daughter, did a wonderful job...better, in fact, than her father was doing about that time. And the lyrics are very clever. ""Sensitivity"" in 5/4 time is a tour-de-force of writing and performing. I was sorry they cut ""Very Soft Shoes,"" the jester's song. And ""An Opening for a Princess."" I missed that, too.

The casting was either good or inspired...mostly. Matthew Morrison and Zooey Deschanel as the young lovers are rather wimpy, to the point of who care if they get married or split or what. But just about everyone else was magnificent. The jester (Michael Boatman) was too good to have had ""Very Soft Shoes"" taken from him. Tom Smothers, a real treat, was wonderful to watch. His pantomime and facial expressions were delightful. Denis O'Hare grew on me. Not being a TV freak, I wasn't familiar with him. Tracey Ullman was fine, if a little long in the tooth for the part. (Then again, one of the productions of the show I did starred Imogene Coca in the part, and she was in her 60s then!) As for Carol Burnett, she was fantastic, totally over the top! She graduated from the princess to the queen perfectly. (Imogene should have had such luck!) Unfortunately, a song was added for her, which did nothing to distinguish itself other than quote Winnifred's ""Happily Ever After,"" a theatrical no-no. (Fred's song was a soliloquy. How or why would the queen sing the same thing?)

The production values were very high. Bob Mackie's costumes for Carol were breathtaking...and hysterical!

In all, though the show is dated, it's part of musical history and let's wish that more classics would get this treatment. (How about SHE LOVES ME for a start, guys?)",1150329600,45,2319,4.704433497536946

2394189,5,B000ATQYVK,"""I want some happily ever after to happen to me."" ~Princess Winnifred

Tracey Ullman and Carol Burnett acting in the same movie seems to create an especially hilarious comedic chemistry. Based on the hit Broadway show from the 50s, this retelling of the ""Princess and the Pea"" is a delicious dance through fairytale land.

The castle set is magical and filled with cherry trees, roses trailing over the tower walls and dreamy moonscapes viewed from the top of the castle. The cinematography is especially clever, causing even scenes that would be a normal interaction to suddenly turn into an occasion for laughter. The camera angles are very creative.

Tracey Ullman plays Princess Winnifred and her physical comedy is filled with a mixture of childlike wonder and adult comedy. She alternates effortlessly between gazing at the moon and dancing in complex choreographed sessions that show a high sense of artistic precision. Candles throughout the set create an appealing romantic mood. The sets and especially brilliantly designed costumes could not be more entertaining.

As Queen Aggravain attempts to get rid of Princess Winnifred through a variety of tests, Prince Dauntless becomes more and more amused by the challenge between his mother and his love interest. I have to say one of the scenes I laughed over the most was Queen Aggravain feeding Prince Dauntless chocolate cake.

2394190,2,B000ATQYVK,"Most people knows that pricess and prince in fairytales are between 16 to 25 years old. So why cast Tracey Ullman?

A mermaid? An alien? But to my surprise, she didn't turn into anything and it was never explained how she was discovered.

Also, although I like musicals in general, none of the songs in this movie is instantly likeable. I listened to each song for half a minute, then I fast forward to the middle of the song, listened some more and fast forward to the end.

I think they're trying very hard to make everything funny in this movie by any means, including casting choices. Unfortunately, it doesn't work for me. There just isn't enough funny in the script. Like one other reviewer noted, it is stupid funny. If they want to go this route, perhaps they should cast Jim Carey as the price, or get Robin Williams to play the queen.

As other Amazon reviewers have noted, Tracey Ulman does a fine job as the goofy Princess, but it's Carol Burnett as the star of the show in the role of the overbearing Queen, looking like a cross between Cher and the cross dressing Tim Curry in ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"", that will make this version both a cult and family classic.",1138492800,3,746,4.8203125
2394210,4,B000ATQYVK,"I fell in love with this cute musical back in the 1960's when it was originally aired on TV in black & white, and loved it again ten years later when it was re-aired in color with only minor cast changes. To the many fans of this beloved play, it is impossible not to compare the new Disney version with the originals.

There is much to like. The look of it is wonderful, complete with a Disneyesque rose-framed window at the end, and a castle full of beautiful, anachronistic rooms, and stained-glass windows with a slightly sinister edge to them. Prince Dauntless and the King (Tom Smothers) are likable, sympathetic, engaging people who you root for;  Sir Harry and his Lady Larken are both charming and attractive.

Inevitably, though, as in all previous made-for-TV versions, certain changes in dialog and action have been made, and several songs are absent. I was a little sorry to see the jester's role so reduced (he had a fine song in the original play and the earliest TV version), but I did find it amusing that the Wizard, usually played as the Queen's lover,is this time only an effeminate court sycophant. The G-rating might have been more appropriate had Harry and Larken been secretly married as they were in the 1960's version, which actually makes more sense considering they have defied a marriage law. Otherwise, Larken's pregnancy would simply be an embarrassment instead of a crime. It would also be more suitable for the children watching this film, which after all is a prime-time Christmas offering.

But I saved for last the two starring ladies. Carol Burnett should have been brilliant as the Queen, and in moments her brilliance does come through. But she needed the outrageous brassiness that Jane White once gave the role, and it wasn't quite there. Still, no one else today should play the Queen, if only for the legacy. Carol Burnett forever!

I am not at all sure about Tracy Ullman as Princess Fred, though. She was not bad, she just wasn't great. Fred needs to be so much larger than life. She's not just another princess, she's the kind of princess children love because she's a princess they can hope to be like - not the perfect and pretty ladies like Snow White, Aurora, or Cinderella. Ullman is fun, she's cute, but she does not dominate the screen in the same ways that once made Carol Burnett a star. In those days, the bedroom scene was a broadly hilarious climax to a charmingly funny musical. In this production it is amusing, but little more. And for that alone,I was greatly disappointed.

Yet in spite of these problems, it was a most enjoyable film. I am surprised that Disney has not tried to market it in their ""princess series"", but time will tell. It is a nice film that looks good and feels good, and to the generations who do not know the older versions, this one should be very satisfying.",1137715200,2,2845,4.657370517928287
2394211,3,B000ATQYVK,"With the exception of watching Carol Burnett play the Queen, this version is wrong on so many levels. Once again, Disney takes a classic show and turns it into a attraction fit for their theme park parades and shows. Mind you, I don't have anything against Disney and love their work and movies but why change what is a deligtful (and adult) fairy tale into a sanitized version of the Partridge Family? If you have never seen this done live, have fun with the DVD (and you might) but for true fans of the show, this was a huge disapointment. And why didn't they put the orginal version - with Burnett as Fred - on the extras? Shame, shame, shame!",1137283200,3,646,4.391666666666667
2394222,4,B000ATQYVK,"A long time ago in a kingdom far away, or something like that, there lived Prince Dauntless (Denis O'Hare).  His one desire is to marry, but his mother (Carol Burnett) has no desire to see her only son married, so she has devised a series of tests that any bride-to-be must pass before she marry the prince.  Officially, they are to keep the bloodline pure by making sure Dauntless marries only a true prince.  Of course, they are so hard that no person would ever be able to pass them.

The prince's unmarried state also weighs heavily on the rest of the court, for the queen has decreeded that no one may marry before the prince does.

This especially hits close to home for Lady Larkin (Zooey Deschanel) and Sir Harry (Matthew Morrison).  Not only have they fallen in love, but they are expecting.  In order to keep Lady Larkin from being exiled in shame, Harry heads out to find the perfect princess.

Who he comes back with is Princess Winnifred (Tracey Ullman).  At first glance, she seems to be the worst princess yet with her brashness and klutziness.  The Prince is immediately smitten with her, but the queen devises her most fiendish plan yet.  A true princess would notice a pea hidden under a pile of mattresses, right?  Will the Prince ever get married?

I've heard of this musical for years, but had never seen it until this version came out.  It's a fun retelling of the classic fairytale of ""The Princess and the Pea.""  Humor abounds and I laughed the entire way through.  Carol Burnett originated the roll of Princess Winnifred, but here she really digs her teeth into the roll of the queen, making her appearances on screen very memorable.  Tracey Ullman also steals scenes are Winnifred.

There were a few things that put me off a little.  Most noticeably, the prince and princess are much older then I thought they would be.  It adds a creepiness to the relationship between the prince and the queen.  The song ""Man to Man Talk,"" while not having anything offensive in it, will certainly lead to questions from curious kids who don't know about the ""facts of life.""  I was surprised it was present in a musical always marketed toward families.

Of course, the thing that makes or breaks a musical is the musical numbers.  There were several memberable songs here, most notably ""Shy,"" which Tracey Ullman does an excellent job belting out.  Her ""Happily Ever After"" was a nice tender song while ""Song of Love"" is very funny.  With the exception of the wonderful ""Spanish Panic,"" the dance numbers weren't quite as inventive as I would have liked, but they were enjoyable as well.

Rushed out after the movie ran on TV, the DVD has only a couple behind the scenes featurettes to its credit.  Nice, but nothing to get excited about.

Since I have never seen another version, I can't compare this to other portrayals and have no opinion on songs that got left out of the show.  While not a perfect musical movie, it will entertain for an hour and a half",1137024000,2,2970,4.601904761904762
2394223,3,B000ATQYVK,"Overall, I thought this revamped version of Once Upon a Mattress was good, but not great.

Tracey Ullman was wonderful and fantastically funny as Winnifred as was Carol Burnett as Aggravain.

What bothered me was the rewriting of a great show.  It was obvious the show was cut to pieces for two reasons:  To give Carol Burnett a larger role and to make sure the show ran within a two hour time slot.  This took many good songs out, shifted the focus of the show to only Aggravain and Winnifred and also took out a lot of charm with it.  Gone is the role of the Minstrel and the fun trio of the Jester, Minstrel and King Sextimus. Gone are great songs ""Many Moons Ago"", ""Opening for a Princess"", ""Yesterday I Loved You"", ""Very Soft Shoes"" and a complete ""Normandy"".

While I can understand minor rewrites and cuts for TV version, I think this show was cut to the point that it suffered greatly from the original version.",1136332800,16,919,4.434523809523809
2394224,4,B000ATQYVK,"This new version of ""Once Upon a Mattress"" is delightful in many ways, and somewhat disappointing in others.  For those well-acquainted with the original stage version, you may find yourself missing some wonderful Rodgers-Barer songs (such as ""An Opening for a Princess"" and ""Yesterday I Loved You"").

However, given the time constraints of commercial network television (where this version was originally presented), one can understand some of the decisions.

Also in this version, more weight is given to the role of the Queen (Carol Burnett) vs. Princess Winnifred (Tracey Ullman).  That's understandable, however, given Burnett's star power and enduring talent.  Burnett is stellar in her role, and while Ullman gets the job done with great comic timing, she lacks that awkward, youthfully exuberant, peel-the-paint-off-the-wall singing that the role needs, and Burnett so wonderfully did in the original version (and would become a trademark style for her).  Still, given the casting choices these days for someone else in the role, Ullman was probably the best pick.

Though ""Mattress"" isn't quite in the pantheon of truly great American Broadway musicals such as ""South Pacific"" or ""My Fair Lady"" (Richard Rodgers's daughter, Mary, wrote the tuneful, memorable score), it's not easy to write ""great"" content around ""The Princess and the Pea.""  Still, for a musical that got its start as a fun romp in the Pocono Mountains, any musical writer worth their salt would die happy to have a hit such as this on their resume (and bank account).

Bottom line:  This new version of ""Mattress"" is wonderfully entertaining and stands up nicely on its own merits.  It's encouraging that television is doing this sort of thing again (i.e., ""Annie"", ""The Music Man"", ""South Pacific"", ""Cinderella"").",1136073600,10,1791,5.293286219081272

Lady Larken and Sir Harry the Immaculate are not married and are expecting a baby and therefore are ""the reason"" the princess from the swamp is brought to the kingdom.  Some princess....ANY PRINCESS.... MUST marry the Prince before Lady Larken's baby is born because she cannot marry until the Prince marries and she is starting to ""show"" her pregnancy. Disney suggests that teenage pregnancy is ""ok"" and even virtuous.  Shame on you!!!  Why did this storyline have to be inserted into a wonderful fairy tale.

2394230,5,B000ATQYVK,"So, a lot of reviewers here have seen Carol Burnette play Princess Winnifred as well as experiencing other versions of this comic musical rendition of The Princess and the Pea.  I respect that you have seen those versions and like them better, but some of us haven't, so we have to work with what we know. I empathize with your feelings entirely, having cringed at the late 90s version of Rogers and Hammerstein's Cinderella.

The latest stock of musicals transferred to DVD from either television or film have been embarrassingly bad.  Down with Love, Bride and Prejudice, the new Willy Wonka, Moulin Rouge, and the new Music Man--none of these will be remembered years from now.  This is definitely not the case with Disney's new offering of Once Upon a Mattress.

Having purchased this on DVD just a few nights ago, I fell in love immediately and have watched it repeatedly since--not a typical undertaking for yours truly.  Carol Burnette is her vintage self as she undertakes the role of control freak Queen Aggravain, and reminds one easily of some of the hilarious villains she played on her variety series--which I'm gratefully old enough to have grown up with.  Tom Smothers is hilarious and touching as the mute king, and I love the fact that they allowed him to play with his yoyo on the set!  Zooey Deschanel and Matthew Morrison sang beautifully together, but it wasn't lost on me the hilarious edge that these two good-looking people who would normally play the stereotypical lead roles ended up being the understudy romance in this version.  That's what makes this version so very funny:  Thank you Disney for providing just a touch of reality to this film by making Prince Dauntless and Princess Winnefred both middle-aged people!  How hilarious is it to see a mother who still ruthlessly clings to her still-single ""little boy"" in his 40s and a less than lovely, flambouyant single princess desperate to fill an ""opening"" to be his princess.  Denis O'Hare is charmingly boyish, innocent, and sympathetically funny as the prince for this reason (Come on, ladies, there are a lot of guys out there like this--in fact I am related to one of them!) and Tracey Ullman steals the show as the swamp Princess Winnifred with vigor, vitality, and boundless energy.  That is a very physical role for a woman her age to play, but she carries it off with such skill, she reminds me of Lucille Ball who also didn't shy away from these roles at that time of her life.  I knew she was a talented comedienne, but I didn't realize just what a great dancer and singer she is as well until seeing this movie.  With all due respect to Miss Burnette, there's no question whose movie this is!

Featuring unforgettably melodic songs (Unlike the bad ones in both Bride and Prejudice and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) with sharply intelligent and witty lyrics, there won't be too many great musicals of this calibre coming down the pike any time soon.  In fact, I think this one has the power of endurance along with the likes of Gypsy, My Fair Lady, and West Side Story.  Watch for my personal favorite scene, the Spanish Panic, simply one of the cutest and most entertaining dances I've witnessed on film in a very long time.  It is a very charming bit that involves the nostalgia of roaring 20s and 30s Broadway dancing that actually makes you feel like you want to learn it yourself.  Obviously, I really enjoy this presentation.  In, fact, I'd personally love to give it 10 stars, and hope you and your family feel just as enthusiastic about it.",1135382400,9,3546,4.714748784440843
2394231,4,B000ATQYVK,"This production of Once Upon a Mattress makes you wonder why Tracey Ullman hasn't been on Broadway until now. She makes the show, in spite of the fact that the role is for a younger woman. For that matter, why aren't there more musical roles for women over forty? The only one I can think of is Mamma Mia. Judging by the popularity of Mamma Mia, it seems as if there is a considerable audience for such shows.

The DVD version of Once Upon a Mattress is fun to watch, but I can't help thinking that I might have been disappointed if I'd paid Broadway prices for a ticket. The only memorable number in the show was Ullman's opening tune ""I'm Shy."" On the other hand, the DVD includes a few extra features that you may enjoy. There's a short about the 1959 production that starred Carol Burnett as Princess Winifred, as well as two split-screen musical numbers comparing the rehearsals with the full-dress version.",1135296000,11,912,4.527272727272727
2394242,5,B000ATQYVK,I loved this version.  Carol Burnett was as fabulous as usual.  She looks young and it was hard to imagine her as the mother. Tracy Ulman was so funny as she always is and to have Tommy Smothers as the dad was a great combination.  Even the prince wasn't too princely.  He was just cute.  Overall I loved the movie.  The costumes were well done and the story was just plain fun.,1135209600,2,378,4.180555555555555
2394243,2,B000ATQYVK,"I was looking forward to the ""new"" version of ""Mattress"", a wonderfully funny and sophisticated show that is too often dumbed down or produced with sophomoric shtick in schools and community theatres across the country.  This made-for-TV version had echoes of the botched ""Music Man"" of last season- miscast, chopped, over-produced, and lacking the sweetness and simplicity of the play.  When you read the original script, you find that, with the right actors, the play plays itself.  It is witty, more adult that one would think, with charming music that defines the characters, forwards the plot, and keeps the audience in on the joke.  The TV version cut songs, including the opening number that sets the stage for the entire production by casting it against a more traditional telling of the Princess and the Pea.  (That the music itself is valuable was evident in the use of the omitted song in the underscore of the show.)  The removal of other numbers, the downplaying of secondary characters, the reassigning of songs, and the addition of a ""new"" number (a reworking of one of Princess Fred's songs) for the Queen, all pointed to the sense that this was a vehicle for Carol Burnett, cast now as the Queen because she is too old to reprise the role that started her career.  I love Tracy Ullman, but felt that she had neither the vocal power nor the eccentricity in this performance to play Fred in a way that would carry the plot.  Denis O'Hare's Prince Dauntless lacked the boyish simplicity and charm to make him likeable and sympathetic.  The other members of the company, all talented in their own right, missed the mark, with lackluster, bland performances.  What a pity.  These actors could do better, if allowed.  Matthew Morrison gave a beautiful performance in ""A Light in the Piazza"".  True, this is a very different show, but there's got to be more to his comedic skills than were evident in this prodution.  I kept thinking that Zooey Deschanel, with her wacky Lady Larkin, would have made a better Winifred than Ullman.  And what a waste of Tom Smothers' talents.  Why use a singer, with verbal comedic talent, to play a role that, until the last minute, is silent?  Why not use Bill Irwin or David Shiner or Geoff Hoyle, comedic actors with a background in physical theatre and clowning?  Please, let this not go down in some archive as the ""definitive version"" of this show.  It needs to be redone, using the reliable and eminently playable original script, as it appeared on stage, with cast members selected for their abilities and a director who can successfully translate a stage play to film- Sam Mendes or Rob Marshall perhaps.",1135123200,5,2656,4.797802197802198

2394245,5,B000ATQYVK,"This is a cute version of ""The Princess and the Pea"".  It has a great cast of characters.  I love Carol Burnett.  It also has memorable songs, especially one called ""I'm in love with a girl named Fred"".  If you enjoy silly comedies, watch this film.",1135036800,,249,4.3478260869565215
2394246,3,B000ATQYVK,"First, the good news: Carol Burnett has done a new version of the musical that catapulted her to stardom, ""Once Upon a Mattress"".

Now, the bad: A sassy, funny show has been Disneyfied to death. I believe it was the late great Allan Sherman who said, ""A camel is a horse that was designed by a committee."" The committee approach is what is wrong with this version: things that didn't need changing have been trampled to death, rendered bland and humourless and politically correct, to please the particular constituency of the Magic Kingdom.

The problems begin, appropriately enough, at the beginning, where two songs (""Many Moons Ago"" and ""Opening for a Princess"") that serve as sufficient exposition for theatre audiences have been jettisioned in favour of a young girl sadly tromping through- where else?- Disneyland, in search of Princess Winifred.  It's a silly enough concept, but some brilliant corporate mind has the kid talking to Snow White and Cinderella en route, even telling Cinderella, ""Loved your movie.""

Incredibly enough, it's mostly downhill from there.  While Carol Burnett is wonderful as control-freak Queen Aggravaine, she'd be wonderful reading the phone book, and such an appearance might do her more professional good than this namby-pamby production.  Tracey Ullman takes on Burnett's old role of Winifred the Woebegone, and the best that can be said is that she gets the woebegone part right.  Ullman is a bit long in the tooth to be playing the part, and her comedic style does not work for the role.  At many points, she seems to be more intent on playing her dimples to the camera than on creating laughs; there is little wit, sass or point to her portrayal.

There is a wild variance in the quality of the work done by the rest of the cast; Tom Smothers is quite good as King Sextimus, even though his big moment towards the end (""I! Can ! TALK!"") has been directed down to a whisper.  Denis O'Hare is too old by half to be attempting the role of Dauntless, and can't be understood part of the time, a largish problem when the lyrics are as intricate as the ones in this show.  Michael Boatman manages the incredible feat of making the Jester interesting in spite of the fact that the Jester's big number, ""Very Soft Shoes"", has been cut.  A good Jester can take more bows than the leads on the strength of this song, and one wonders why it was omitted.

The performances of Zooey Deschanel and Matthew Morrison make for the worst Sir Harry and Lady Larkin I've ever seen, high-school productions of this show not excepted.  The lovely, yet satiric ""Normandy"" is completely mangled by these two, with both of them so intent on harmonising that they forget that the words MEAN something.  The song is both a love song and a Borscht Belt spoof of love songs; the imagery of a ""beach where the peach blossom blows"" is closely followed by the streetwise ""And I know how to reach / a man who knows / a man who knows.""  Deschanel and Morrison haven't a clue what all of this is about.

But then, neither did much of anyone else connected with this version.  The direction is flabby and pointless, with many a gag thrown away and many a laugh stifled.  The design of the sets is perfectly dreadful, with a sepia murk imposed on nearly everything, and furnishings wildly anachronistic for the period of the story.  Many of the costumes look downright cheap, although Carol Burnett's (by the great Bob Mackie, I understand) are terrific.

The worst of it all is that a show that was once bawdy and graceful, hysterical and touching has been dumbed down and PC'ed to the point that there IS no point to it any more.  There was once real wit and bite to the proceedings; this production is so bland, it very nearly qualifies as a formal remake of Disney's ""Cinderella"".

If you're a Carol Burnett fan, as I am, you'll be willing to suffer through this to get a chance to see her in it, and it must be admitted that the lady still has what it takes to make an audience laugh, uncontrollably at times.  But what she's surrounded with is not nearly as good as she is, and that's more than a pity, it's a crying shame, given what ""Once Upon a Mattress"" should be and once was, many moons ago.",1135036800,7,4211,4.606425702811245
2394247,5,B000ATQYVK,"Wow I am amazed at how upset people get when they make changes to a musical. I think some musicals are sacred . . . I mean shows like Gypsy, Fiddler on the Roof and the Sound of Music for example are so well written they are timeless and perfect as is . . . while others don't age well (or transition well from stage to screen.) I mean Chicago the movie cut songs . . . but they kept in what would work with the concept that all musical numbers happen in Roxie's mind . . . so there is an example of good changes. I mean years ago they used to chop up musicals for no reason when they transitioned to film and they were horrible . . . such as the original movie versions of Bye Bye Birdie and Damn Yankees. I found Disney's Once Upon A mattress charming . . . they could have back off on the high gloss.  I will be the first to admit that lately Disney beats a dead horse . . . they find something that works and then kill it. I mean they pump out tons of those straight to home video dvds and most are not up to par. They had some success with stage musicals and now they are turning more movies into Broadway musicals . . . obviously some are going to work better they others. After the success of the remake of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Cinderella they have tried to duplicate it with the Music Man and Annie. The Music Man was drawn out and lack luster and Annie started off strong and then was rushed at the end. I think they hit gold with Mattress. First of all Tracey Ullman is not too old . . . the thing that makes this show funny is that the Lady Larkin and Sir Harry are more the sterotypical leads and Prince Dauntless is a momma's boy way over due and Princess Winifred is a princess that is desperate for an openning.  I though Tracy hit this right on the mark. Carol Burnett is wonderful in everything she does (I could go on forever about her) . . . she look hysterical in those costumes and added so make as the queen . . . I have heard the original cast album of the show and seen clips from the other two televsion versions and Burnett was/is wonderful as the princess . . . it is a role that will always be associated with her. I think Tracey Ullman is the only person who I could think of that could bring something new to this without harming the original . . . and she does. Sarah Jessica Parker in the revival??? what were they thinking??? It should be a comedian! I like the changes they made here . . . sorry to those who did the show . . . but the songs they cut were boring anyway. It is one thing to see a show live but when you are sitting in your living room it is easy to channel surf when it gets boring. I think the cuts made this version crisp and gave the leads more to do. I like that they added a new song for Carol and had her sing ""A princess is a delicate thing."" If you are so closed minded that you can't get the original out of your head or if you are a die hard purist of this show and can't bare watching something different because you played the jester in your middle school porduction then DON'T WATCH this! If you are a fan of Disney, Tracey Ullman, Carol Burnett, Bob Mackie or love Broadway musical and don't have any preconceived ideas about this show then I am sure you will love this version. It's great for the whole family . . . the kids will love it . . . **I am following up with more on the DVD** . . . I just bought the DVD . . . I was surprised it's in widescreen . . . it was shown on TV in full screen but was obviously filmed in widescreen . . . and it makes it even better. Plus there are some cool special features: including a brief behind the scenes look, some outtakes and you can watch two musical numbers as a split screen of the rehearsal/ finished product.",1135036800,5,3732,3.994645247657296
2394248,4,B000ATQYVK,"This new version of ""Once Upon a Mattress"" that Broadway chestnut from 1959 that originally featured Carol Burnett as Princess Winnifred ( she also appeared in the 1964 and 1972 television versions) reappears for the holidays with Burnett as executive producer and in the role of Queen Aggravain. This clever reinterpretation has all the appeal of the original production with the multi-talented Tracy Ullman appearing the role of Princess Winnifred. Featuring winning songs and a winning cast (including Zooey Deschanel, Michael Boatman and Tom Smothers) this version is delightful eye candy with colors that almost pop off the screen with their fairy tale sheen. Nicely updated by Janet Brownell and well directed by Broadway choreographer and director Kathleen Marshall.

Nobody in the Kingdom according to the law can get married until the Prince finds a bride. His mother Queen Aggravain (Burnett) continues to come with difficult and challenging questions/tasks to prevent her son from getting married. Desperate to get married Lady Larken (Zooey Deschanel) and her Knight Sir Harry (Michael Morrison) comes up with a plan to get the child-like Prince (Denis O'Hara) married. Harry goes on a hunt for this perfect princess and discovers Princess Winnifred (Ullman). When we first meet her she climbs over the castle walls having swam the moat.  With help from Harry, Lady Larken, the Minstrel and Jester Winnifred (""Fred"" to her friends) proves to be much more difficult to dispose of compared to the other princesses.

An entertaining Broadway musical that still manages to be engaging and funny, this retelling of the princess and the pea myth is a fun throw back to when musicals were king on the big screen and TV as well.",1134950400,20,1732,5.156583629893238
2394249,5,B000ATQYVK,"OK, so I'm sure Carol Burnett was fab in the original show, but for my two kids and I who had never seen this before, we really loved it.  It was so nice to see some real dancing on a TV movie, the colors were great, Carol's costumes were wild, and Tracy and Dennis were a hoot as the two lovers.  Who cares that they were ""older""?  Dennis was great as a big ""momma's boy"" coming out of his shell and Tracy was terrific throughout.  Smothers was sweet and sly, and overall it was a lot of fun.  I've been introducing my kids to movie musicals lately (Danny Kaye, Gene Kelly, etc. etc.) and this was a whole lot of fun.

I'm sure many out there have great memories of the Broadway original and other productions, (including ones they were themselves in.).  Hey, I was in Fiddler on the Roof when I was a kid, but I don't judge the movie by what my high school did!  I say bravo to Disney for bringing something to TV that may encourage kids to go to see the ""real thing"" on Broadway and to support more musicals made for film and TV.  And for those who complain about the cuts to the script, hey, it ain't sacred text here, it's a musical!",1134950400,4,1138,4.136363636363637
2394250,2,B000ATQYVK,"I have waited a long time for Once Upon A Mattress to return to film... unfortunately, this version was a major disappontment... especially after watching Sarah Jessica Parker revive it on Broadway. I can't understand how Carol Burnett would allow such an amazing show to be chopped to pieces by Disney. The acting was actually very good... but too many wonderful songs were discarded... and some of the best parts in the stage version are reduced to cameo roles such as the King, the Jester and the Minstrel. I also felt Tom Smothers as the King could have given a much better performance, but the film script didn't allow for it... I do not blame him, I blame the lack of creativity on the film writers and/or Director. He is certainly capable. I also do not understand using Tracy Ullman as the Princess... she is a wonderful actress and did a good job... but the role, in my mind, requires someone younger... Zoey Deschenel (Lady Larken) could have been wonderful as the Princess... I will not be surprised if other fans of this wonderful stage production are not as disapponted as I was. Bottom line for me is, with this much talent, this movie should have been amazing.",1134950400,5,1175,4.653846153846154
2394271,3,B000ATQYVK,"For me, any review of ""Once Upon a Mattress"" is a matter of how it stacks up to previous versions. ""Mattress"" was the second musical I ever saw performed on stage when I was a kid. In my twenties, I played Sextimus. I saw the 1972 version on TV (and recently acquired a copy; it doesn't age well) and found the 1964 TV version on eBay -- that is the best version, with an unexpected song and dance routine from Elliott Gould, who is light on his feet and sounds like an American Anthony Newley.

This new version, to use my wife's assessment, is too Disneyfied. It's just OK when it could have been fabulous. It's polite when it should be raucous. Too many gags are blown because they toned down the delivery for film. Also, the secondary parts have been reduced to almost nothing. The Jester's role is so slivered that I wonder why he's in the film.

Tracey Ullman: Very good as Winnifred, but held back. Her British accent in the part is fine, since it establishes her as a foreigner in the kingdom. And she IS supposed to come from a marshland swamp in a northern kingdom.

Dennis O'Hare: Good acting as Dauntless, sloppy diction when singing.

Carol Burnett: Here's the main problem -- she's excellent (especially with the new song written for this version), but restrained. Aggravain is written to be bombastic and overpowering.

Tom Smothers: Very good as the King, but again, this is a part that has been played by Buster Keaton. It was written as basically being a medieval Harpo Marx. All of the girl-chasing has been excised. He's very mellow and charming, but mellow doesn't do it for me with this part. He was fine for ""Man to Man Talk"". Smothers was as wonderful as he was allowed to be by the director.

Matthew Morrison: Again, a cartoon part played too realistically. But Morrison was very good, and sang very well.

Zooey Deschanel: I liked her. Her voice was beautiful (her diction was sloppy.) She acted rings around Bernadette Peters in the 1972 version. But the problem with a more down-to-earth Lady Larken is that what attracts Dauntless to Winnifred is the fact that Winnifred is the very first down-to-earth girl he's ever met.

Michael Boatman: As the Jester - probably a good actor, but who knows from this? The part was cut to a point where he was a glorified extra.

Edward Hibbert: Disneyfied in a politically correct way -- instead of obviously being the Queen's lover-on-the-side, here the Wizard is an old drag queen -- LITERALLY, when he's playing the Nightingale.

The director blew the end of the curse. It's a standard comedy Rule of Three:

Jester: Look... the Queen can't talk!

King: (struggling) I...

  (court is breathless)

King: (struggling harder) I...

  (court is breathless)

King: (smiling) I can!

  (court cheers!)

Here, the director had Tom Smothers in the background saying (very quietly), ""I... I can talk. I can talk."" Completely killed the bit.

The pantomime with Winnifred trying to get to sleep was rushed into, then screwed up with bad camera cuts.

""The Spanish Panic"" is a choreographer's Mount Everest. This choreographer fell off the mountain halfway up.

Much of the material holds up (when the director has the faith to let the cast deliver it properly) and the songs are still charming.  To address a previous reviewer's plea of ""Can't anyone just have FUN anymore????????""  Well, yes -- which is why I resent not having much of it with this movie.  It wasn't that much fun.

The nice thing will be if kids like it enough to seek out other, better movies of musicals, or to audition for this one when their local theater does it, just because they remember liking this one.",1134950400,8,3642,4.688188976377953

Burnett and company have taken this show to the public and made it ENTERTAINMENT.  The idea that the new ""40 year old virgin"" is the prince is so funny.  Tracey Ullman in all her glory just scrapping it up is, well, Tracy Ullman, what more do you need.  Tommy Smothers????  Come on.  This was fun.  It was intelligent.  It was stylish.  And filmed and choreographed beautifully.  I don't even care if they missed some songs (since I was Sir Harry once and hated ""Yesterday I Loved You"").  Can't anyone just have FUN anymore????????

2394273,2,B000ATQYVK,"Overall I guess this was an okay show.  The set and costumes were good (if not over the top).  This would be a pretty good show for people who haven't seen the stage version.  However, for those of us who have this show was terrible.  It took the minstrel out of the show and he has some of the best songs along with the jester and the King.  I hated how they gave Normandy to Sir Harry and Larkin and took out Yesterday I Loved You, Opening For a Princess, The King, the Jester and I and Very Soft Shoes.

Then onto the songs they did have...I guess they were all right.  The actors were okay singers, nothing too amazing though.  The part I hated most was the newly created song for Carol Burnett.  It was awful.  Princess Fred should have been younger and her accent was dredful and didn't really fit at all.  She really couldn't sing very well which makes me wonder why she got the role in the first place.

It's nice to see this wonderful musical on TV, but I would say do yourself a favor and see the ""real"" version of it on stage.  When my high school did it it was stunning and we interpreted some of the lines quiet differently and added little things to make the performance more unique and special. (Not to meantion our lead singers rocked the house).  See it on stage and you won't be sorry this musical is so much more amazing when done with talented singers and actors who arn't chosen based on what they have done in the past.",1134864000,5,1441,4.230769230769231
2394274,3,B000ATQYVK,"Love the show, but it just isn't the same on TV as on stage.  Our local little theater did it two years ago and it was fantastic, so I have some preconceived notions about what it should be like.  Shows that were designed for the stage don't film that well.  They should just pull the camera back and film it like a stage show, but instead, they can't resist moving in for close-ups and such when they film it for TV.  Distracting.  As well, I think the casting of Winifred could have been better.  Our local show used quite a large woman with a huge voice for the role, and it was great.  Dauntless was very skinny, and she was able to pick him up when they were dancing.  To make it even more of a shock for the queen, I think the choice of a black woman for Winifred would have been wonderful--say, a 250-pound black actress with a fantastic voice.  It would have made Winifred totally different from what the queen had in mind--Tracy Ullman looks a little unusual, I guess, but otherwise she's pretty much a standard-looking princess in this version--slim, fit, long hair.  Could have been better.  But of course, I love Carol Burnett in anything, as I'm sure many people do.",1134864000,2,1179,4.412037037037037

In its place they sang a shortened version of ""Normandy"" which was not their number in the first place. ""Very Soft Shoes"" a minor show-stopper for the jester was missed and ""Many Moons Ago"" and ""An Opening for a Princess"" were reduced to bits. The score that was retained was edited but the songs still entertain.  The cast was well chosen and Tracy Ullman was brave taking on a role forever identified as Carol Burnetts' who camped it up in high style as wicked Queen Aggravain for this special. Tracy was good and funny but her singing lacked the lung power of Carol Burnett especially the way Ms Burnett belted out ""Happily Ever After"" and ""Shy""  Denis O'Hare made an appropriate woe-be-gone Prince Dauntless and Matthew Morrison sang well as Sir Harry.  If this show had been made for HBO maybe they could have retained the entire show instead of being constrained by the endless parade of commercials on network Tv. As is the show was still a lot of fun and the funniest line came when Lady Larkin tells Sir Harry she is expecting his baby and Sir Harry replies, ""You can't be blamed you had a moment of weakness""",1134864000,13,1349,4.56198347107438
2394276,5,B000ATQYVK,I have just finished watching this on the Wonderful World of Disney and it was perfect.  Carol Burnett has always been a personal favorite of mine and her performance in this along with the multi-talented Tracy Ullman are not to be missed!  The musical numbers were delightful and integral to the plot of this wonderful production.  What a delightful holiday treat this was!  To top it off was to see the DVD release of this treasure advertised at the end of the broadcast tonight.  A must have for my collection!  This brought Broadway right into my living room and I highly recommend this DVD for everyone out there.,1134864000,2,618,4.675925925925926
2394277,4,B000ATQYVK,"In former days, that is to say, once upon a time, Jay Thompson, Marshall Barer, and Dean Fuller decided to turn the fairy tale of ""The Princess and the Pea"" into a musical called ""Once Upon a Mattress.""  It premiered off-Broadway in 1959 and made a star of Carol Burnett, who took the show to Broadway.  In 1964 Burnett starred in the first television production of the show with Joseph Bova as the prince and did another production in 1972 opposite Ken Berry.  Both times Jane White and Jack Gilford played the queen and king, while the first production had Elliott Gould and Shani Wallis, the second offered Wally Cox and Bernadette Peters.  Now for the holiday season in 2005 television offers a third production of the musical, still with Carol Burnett, but this time with her playing the queen instead of the princess, passing the torch to Tracy Ullman, although Sarah Jessica Parker did a Broadway revival back in 1997 (both roles are for a mezzo/alto, the princess needing to sing from low B to high C# and the queen from low A to high B, so they are virtually the same vocal range).

The story is set in the kingdom of King Sextimus the Silent (Tommy Smothers), a kind man who is unable to rule because a fairy gave him a curse that stops him from speaking.  In his stead Queen Aggravian (Burnett) has taken control and come up with one of those stupid rules that power mad rulers do in fairy tales that are turned into musicals.  She has decreed that no one in the kingdom can get married until her son, Prince Dauntless (Denis O'Hare), has wed, and the prince can only marry the lucky princess who can pass one of the queen's tests.  Nobody has, which is unfortunately because Lady Larken (Zooey Deschanel) is now pregnant with the baby of Sir Harry (Matthew Morrison).  Something needs to be done.  This is where Princess Winnifred the Woebegone (Ullman) enters the picture.  Prince Dauntless falls for her, even though she is painfully shy, and the only question is whether she can pass the key sensitivity test devised by the queen.

Along the way Ullman gets to sing ""Shy,"" ""The Swamps of Home,"" ""Song of Love,"" and ""Happily Ever After,"" while Burnett now gets to take a crack at ""Sensitivity"" and ""Quiet.""  Burnett has fun wearing Bob Mackie gowns (who else designs these things?), Ullman brings her own brand of comedy to the role of Winnifred (who else is as wild eyed and as wacky as Burnett?).  The two best songs are given over to the second leads, who are, after all, the soprano and tenor in the show, so the knight and his lady sing ""In a Little While"" and ""Yesterday I Loved You.""  But this is a musical where the songs are cute (e.g., ""An Opening For a Princess"") and you watch this for the comedy.  No, this is not as good as Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""Cinderella,"" but it was never trying to be.  If you watched this on television tonight then you should already know if you want to pick this up, otherwise you key motivation will be having fond memories of one of the earlier television productions, neither of which are currently available.",1134864000,2,3069,4.5610200364298725

Princess Fred is a delightful twist on what a princess is/isn't.  The entire cast is just perfect.
