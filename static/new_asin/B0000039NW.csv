1177689,2,B0000039NW,"Cheesy 80's drive-in feature starring Anna Chappell as Evelyn Chambers, a recently released mental patient who is the owner of the Mountaintop Motel, a rundown motel in the backwoods of a small town. After she accidentally kills her daughter, Evelyn is sparked by voices who tell her to kill every guest that stays at the motel in the future - and now the survivors who have noticed the many deaths occuring, must fight for their lives as the crazy old bat continues her rage on everyone. Complete with creepy atmosphere but essentially bad acting and a bad script, this film is slightly enjoyable for the main fact that it's so corny. Some of the acting is alright, most notably from Major Brock I believe it is, who plays Crenshaw. It's extremely bad, but very funny and sometimes very creepy.",1053561600,3,795,4.726618705035971
1177690,1,B0000039NW,"So they call this a horror movie do they? God help us!
I like the ""Slumber Party Massacre"" movies and thought that this was something like that. On the cover it looks great!  I couldn`t wait to get this one. Sat down in front of the tv and turned on.  It did exactly nothing for me. Money well spent i thought to myself. Luckily i found a store that pays for dvd`s.
Poor suckers.  I could have been so much better!",1007424000,3,414,4.08641975308642
1177691,5,B0000039NW,"Just to give you an idea of the rather skewed reviews of many movie critics: In the most recent Video Watchdog Movie Guide, Headless Eyes, another cheesy, bloody, even more obscure potboiler, was given at least a single bone, while this silly but undeniably entertaining masterpiece was given a prompt WOOF!
This isn't Spielberg. This is an offering from the realm of baby budgets and unseasoned, often artless actors (or relatives of the producers, perhaps). But a few things set this lovely little cheese-out apart from other fatuous horror flicks. First, the killer: In this case, instead of some tall, beefy, masked sociopath with a knife, we have a middleaged/elderly woman with a hand scythe. Second, the setting makes one genuinely uneasy: A tenebrous wood and a slatternly series of shacks, masquerading as a motel. The ""protagonist"" (Hey, even murderers need some respect at the end of a hard day) is especially freaky, stout and lurid with her sickle, mowing down unwitting customers; these customers are singularly ridiculous, from the preacher who, knowing that murder is afoot, confronts Evely advancing on him with her trusty scythe with the question: ""Evelyn, how'd you get in here?"" This movie is like a pond: There is a delicate, precarious symbiosis between the utterly absurd and truly unsettling. Consider this a stylish gore camp classic, and you will hit upon the abstract of almost every review you've read so far (including mine). I still love it after several viewings.",996969600,5,1494,5.1020408163265305
1177692,4,B0000039NW,"The 80's was a decade filled with hundreds, if not thousands, of really stupid and pointless horror movies.  Most of them direct-to-video.  But MOUNTAINTOP MOTEL MASSACRE is one of the few stand-outs.  This movie is good old fashion horror fun.  And the new re-mastered VHS looks and sounds great.  What makes this movie worth while is a cast of colorful, if not stereotypical, characters.  The performers do their best to have fun with the story and play along with the situation, no matter how outrageous it gets.  What is remarkable, is the creepy atmosphere.  The motel itself is a run-down spooky old place hidden in the woods.  It really does add a whole dimension to the movie.  And some of the set-pieces, such as an underground tunnel that travels beneath the motel rooms, make for some great moments.  Evelyn Chambers, our star and serial killer, is one hell of a nut job, and the actress who plays her does a great job of having fun with the role.  I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a mindless, but creepy, camp fest from the 80's.  Think of it as a very bad version of PSYCHO.",993513600,3,1099,4.574358974358974
1177733,5,B0000039NW,This movie is just one of those movies.  It's absolutely horrible to the point of being laughable.  I got it for a night of giggles with my mum.  She loves this corny stuff.,1364947200,3,173,4.181818181818182
1177734,1,B0000039NW,"As Halloween draws near we have been working hard to round up as many horror films as possible within our spare time. Ideally when choosing your Octoberfest horror flicks you want to mix it between creature features, classics, laughable B's, and slashers. In hopes to meet our slasher quota we decided to pick a lesser known movie entitled Mountaintop Motel Massacre. Sure it looks absolutely absurd, but was certainly worth a shot. The crazy grandma on the cover was intriguing enough making one say ""this woman is totally insane,"" thus giving you a sense of some possible redeemable quality. However there was none. Please understand that the elf loves horrible B movies, but they need to have something going on in the laugh department. Sure there were a few laughs from time to time, but most came in between trying to keep your eyes opened from sheer boredom. The use of this crazy woman was so poorly done that not one scare or creepy moment was anywhere to be found. Seriously is you have a deranged old lady you have to explore the studio space. Just me, my old lady, and the road.

Ok here goes the plot. Evelyn is a completely whacked out old lady who has spent the better portion of her golden years in an insane asylum. Once she's released on good behavior she resumes her role as master of the house at her dump the Mountaintop Motel. While tending to the garden she starts to dip into her old realm of insanity with her sickle in hand. She then finds her daughter trying to speak to her dead father and flips her bill. This old bat goes totally nuts and gets a bit carried away with the sickle. While swinging her arms around in a total hissy fit she winds up slicing her daughters face up leaving her dead. Now she really gets crazy and continues her tirade by killing off her hotel residents. She does this by some trap doors set up throughout the motels basement. That's pretty much the meat of this nightmare of a movie. In between the killings is a heavy dose of lame boring dialogue that will leave you near sleep.

Obviously in no way were we a fan of Mountaintop Motel Massacre despite going in with minimal expectations. Honestly it could have been decent if they kept the tempo up and got a little more creative with the old lady. A couple bright spots were the old fat drunk pastor and the guy that looks like Danny Tanner with a mustache. Danny Tanners brother is a total perv that understands with great mustache comes great responsibility, and is also a man responsible of awarding the film a DMF of 1. Yeah see the DMF is back baby! And it's in full rotation. Odds are you will never find this movie on t.v at anytime, even at 1 am when they run Death Ring. So in order to watch this you actually have to make an effort which we plead with you not to make. Instead of wasting an hour and a half of your time just read the review instead of watching. Even Wicked Games grab this movie by the shoulders and yells ""you were, you were a bad girl!"" This will surely get a patented Loomis of ""He's gone, the evil's gone from here"" while dumping it back into the mailbox.",1319846400,,3093,4.405594405594406
1177735,3,B0000039NW,"Newly released from an insane asylum, Evelyn returns home to run her remote mountain-top hotel.  In a fit of psychotic rage, she kills her daughter, then she starts killing her hotel guests, one by one.

Although the film is low-budget, it does have its charms.  The hotel guests are unique and colorful, particularly the ""preacher"" character. He has some witty dialogue with other characters in the film.

Evelyn could compete with Freddy Kruger as one of the most outright zany characters you'll find on film.

The horror itself is done in a campy sort of style.  Definitely has a ""drive-in"" feel to it.  Fun to watch.",1305158400,5,620,4.7924528301886795
1177736,3,B0000039NW,"This film is not the best slasher for Terror Train and Friday The 13th are by far better; however its not the worst b/c it has great atmoshpere and some creepy scenes! Actually the recent horror film with luke wilkinson ""Vacancy"" , took the idea of a motel with secret tunnels under neath each motel room with trap doors on all the bathroom floors, under the rug,for all the guests to be butchered at night! Thats one of the reasons this film is so original and also the gore is pretty good for a low budget film. I had many laughs because there is some great humor in this, like the preacher with rats in his room, horrid acting by some characters,  and the two cousins who think they can sing but they really cant! This slasher gem is worth a look but only if you don't take it seriously!",1279497600,2,790,4.266666666666667
1177737,1,B0000039NW,"i say that because as bad as this is i hope they were really going for laughs and not chills because the thrills are just not there.

 evelyn just got out of the nut house for killing people so she comes back to the motel of the title and starts killing again.

  thats the whole movie,except that it goes like this for 90 min. or so and isn't near as exciteing as it sounds. the budget goes beyond low(looks like yhey had a $1.98 to spend and they didn't use the money on actors. really a waste of time!",1148083200,2,504,4.05050505050505
1177738,2,B0000039NW,"good things]

The atmosphere in this movie is creepy, hazy and wet. The motel looks more like a run-down Camp Crystal Lake, which I am sure is purely intentional with the camp slasher craze of the early 80's. The soundtrack is cheap but adds to the creepy elemnt.

The plot is surely not unique, but but is is well done. Get a bunch of stranded people in one secluded place where the law can't help them and then kill them. The formula that worked with Friday The 13th 5 times.

[the bad]

The acting in this is absolutely HORRENDOUS! The make-up effects aren't much better. The story is good, but we know who the killer is from the first 5minutes of the movie on, which in my opinion took ALOT of suspense out of the movie.

[final thoughts]

I think this movie would have been so much better with a fatter budget, better acting and more of a ""whodunit"" mystery, but we had neither of that and the movie falls flat even though there is a valiant effort.

The D.V.D. doesn't give us any extras, and we all know that sucks.",1136246400,8,1022,4.319371727748691
1177739,2,B0000039NW,"Where are the mountains at?  This film is called MOUNTAINTOP MOTEL MASSACRE but yet there are no mountains, the ""motel"" appears to be nothing but some shacks in the woods and I had no idea a body count of seven equaled a massacre.  But then again MOUNTAINTOP MOTEL MASSACRE is a little more eye-catching than WOODED SHACK INCIDENT.

Not the worst slasher movie of all time I give that honor to the agonizing AX'EM, but not the best either more like firmly in the middle or maybe a little higher if you find a frail old woman you could kill with one punch to be scary.

For slasher completist or the very bored only, no nudity, little blood, no scares and mediocre filmmaking.",1131062400,7,675,4.463414634146342

1177741,1,B0000039NW,"At first glance Mountaintop motel massacre looks decent, a little tragic but watchable. Boy was I wrong. Nothing could prepare me for how terrible it was. It delivers terrible acting, no structure and nothing to grab your attention. The story in theory is quite good, but instead it has been butchered into a poor, depressing movie. I wouldn't even recommend this movie if you were bored and pulling your hair out. Avoid!",1075680000,2,421,4.861111111111111
1177742,5,B0000039NW,"The tagline for the movie was ""Don't disturb Evelyn, she already is."" How true that turned out to be. Evelyn is our main character, such a poor little thing she is. Not only is she a widow who runs a motel and has a daughter who practices the black arts, she also happens to be crazy and has been a resident at a mental hospital. In a fit of fury she kills her daughter Lorri. The authorities pass it off as a accident and Evelyn is free to go and manage her motel. But when Evelyn gets some tenants on a stormy night, she starts to crack.
This movies is a morbid gem and filled with unease. If you're going to watch the movie, do so at night, by yourself with the lights off. If the whispering voices and bone-chilling music doesn't get to you I don't know what will.",1075248000,13,768,4.126666666666667

7902402,5,B0000039NW,"As a longtime horror buff, I really don't understand how anyone could give a bad review on this movie.  This is really a fun, underrated classic from the slasher era. I've honestly watched films of this kind with higher reviews that sucked so bad I thought maybe I was missing something.  The worse part of this entire movie is the two chicks thinking they have a legit shot at country music stardom, but they make up for it with an impromptu wet t-shirt contest when their car breaks down in the rain.  This film has great creepy atmosphere for a horror movie, especially during the storm scenes.  It has interesting characters who run the spectrum from a honeymooning couple, stranded motorists, a shady salesman, and the old coots who seem to be permanent residents.  All of these folks converge on this grimy little ""motel"" that actually looks more like little shotgun shacks from hell.  Of course, you have Evelyn. Bless her heart, she's about as nutty as squirrel poop and loves to appear through little trap doors in the floors of the rooms to do her special brand of ""housekeeping"".  My teenagers love it when I take them on a trip to the 80's with these types of films and they're jealous that we had ""such awesome movies back then.""",1462147200,3,1242,4.618181818181818

7902407,2,B0000039NW,"I have been looking at this title for 30 years now.  I kept putting off watching it for some reason or another.  I would pick it up at the video store and walk around with it until I found something else that seemed more appealing and then put it back.  I usually love these types of movies, really bad, 80's slash and hack, remote setting, this is great stuff to me.  So this weekend I finally gave in and watched it.

I did enjoy the atmosphere of this movie.  I really liked the story, I think to an extent Vacancy stole some ideas from this movie and somewhat improved upon them.  But then you throw in the actors and a script and wow, the whole things falls flat on it's face.  I don't enjoy when people who are scarred don't scream, even when they see a dead body.  I don't enjoy when there is no sense of fear in the characters that are being stalked, no sense of danger, never in a hurry.  This is a horror movie and there is no sense of horror.

The make up effects were bad, the film editing was bad, the dialogue in the script was bad.  This is actually a movie that I would like to see be remade, there is something there and that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of one.  And I can definetly see why this has a small cult followinig.

The movie does carry a creepy, foreboding atmosphere. The music itself is the creepiest, then the set and lighting.

As for plot, it does drag on a little. The acting is flat and not very good.

But the movie does carry a charm to it.
