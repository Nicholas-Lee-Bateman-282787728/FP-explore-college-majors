3678482,5,B001L57ZZG,"Having been a long-time fan of period dramas, I was eagerly anticipating the release of The Duchess on DVD [having had no time to go to the cinema], and watched it last night. I must say I was very impressed at the production quality of the movie and the overall acting caliber of the actors.

Though the movie is based on a biography, Amanda Foreman's ""Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire"", my review is based on just the movie for I have yet to read the book. The movie basically portrays the life of Georgiana [Keira Knightley in one of her best roles to date], an 18th century aristocrat who at a very young age, not quite 18, is married off by her ambitious mother [a suitably icy performance by Charlotte Rampling] to
the Duke of Devonshire, William Cavendish [Ralph Fiennes in a remarkably controlled performance]. Though Georgiana's mother and the Duke enter into the marriage contract with the understanding that Georgiana's main role would be to provide William with a male heir, the girl herself naively believes [and is helped along by her calculating mother] that the Duke loves her.

Georgiana's illusion of a marriage based on love is abruptly torn to shreds when she arrives at the Duke's palatial home - her 'induction' into the carnal aspects of marriage leave her feeling cold and unfulfilled, the Duke turns out to be a man who is emotionally distant and not given to sentimentality, and worst of all, he is also an adulterous cad, having affairs with lowly maids [right under Georgiana's nose] and even upper class ladies, one of whom is Georgiana's supposed best friend, Lady Bess Foster [Hayley Atwell].

The menage a trois between the Duke, Duchess and Bess makes for compelling viewing in and of itself - though Georgiana insists Bess is thrown out of their home [Georgiana had initially asked Bess to live with them due to Bess' impoverished circumstances], the Duke refuses, and this gives rise to a very awkward living situation. The silent dining, the visitations by Bess' three sons [of whom she was initially denied access to by her estranged husband], and Georgiana's hurt at witnessing true affection between Bess and the Duke when she herself is deprived of love is heartrending to watch.

Georgiana however, does find love - with Charles Grey [Dominic Cooper] who is a fast-rising politician. Their love is mutual and Georgiana finally finds in Charles a man who truly loves her for who she is. It was such a joy to witness their intimate scenes [not just the sexual part of it] for in these scenes, we truly see Georgiana come alive and her face is filled with the radiance of a woman fulfilled.

The story of the Duchess of Devonshire is ultimately the story of a woman who lives in a gilded cage - her wealth doesn't shield her from the other pitfalls of life, namely of a loveless marriage and the confines her position places her in. Even in finding true love, she realises there is a high price to pay for dalliances, especially if one is a woman. In one of her confrontations with the Duke, Georgiana asks ""Why can't I have what you and Bess have?"" and this is a stark reminder that life as a woman back then was a life of repression and submissiveness.

I felt the main actors did a fine job in their performances. Keira Knightley shines as the unhappy Duchess who goes from a carefree young girl in the opening scene to a fashion icon whose unhappy marriage becomes fodder for gossips and even plays, and who ultimately, in utter resignation, comes to accept the confines of her position and the practical realities of her marriage. Ralph Fiennes is simply amazing as the Duke, a man who is so emotionally-restrained, he comes across as ruthless and cruel, though he does reveal a capacity for empathy in some scenes. He is merely a product of his times and a man bound to duty more than anything else.

All in all, ""The Duchess"" is an emotionally-wrenching human drama that will appeal to fans of period movies. It is filled with sumptuous costumes, lush depictions of the English countryside and a haunting score. Highly recommended!",1230508800,28,4076,4.724331926863573

3678485,4,B001L57ZZG,"The Duchess is a gorgeous movie to look at but stare too long and you begin to wonder if everything you see on screen really happened in any capacity. The characters were indeed real human beings, though in the film they hardly acted it. I suppose if you were filthy rich, even during that particular time period, you could pretty much do whatever you wanted, female or not.

Kiera Knightley plays said Duchess with perfect finesse and completely looks the part. She is never uncomfortable and she holds her own even when she is forced to share the spotlight with the incomparable Ralph Fiennes. The two lack chemistry, but that is exactly what it is supposed to look like; what supposedly actually happened. He is cold and distant and she is young and the complete opposite. He only wants for an heir, a male one at that. He is not happy when she begins spitting out one, two little baby girls.

His actions are harsh and intimidating, though never at the beginning of their marriage. It is only when things begin to fall apart in more ways than one when things get a bit nasty for everyone. It is a joy to watch the two of them on screen together.

The fault of the film is not with the acting. That is the only thing keeping this movie afloat. That, and the absolutely glorious looking costumes that litter every scene. It is a feast for every period film loving man or woman. By far the best costumes I've seen in any period film. No, the fault lies with the length of the film. It just feels long. There is not much of a plot to be honest. After the first hour of bickering and flirting and babies, it becomes repetitive and almost unrealistic. There are love triangles and threats and typical angsty plot lines that are neither interesting nor inventive.

While historically, some things portrayed in the film DID happen, alot of it feels made up and I found the end to be predictable and unsatisfying. I will not reveal anything here, for those that do not know the story that well. To me, it just seemed a bit odd and unspectacular. Still, the film has alot going for it and is worth watching for the acting alone.",1229904000,3,2122,4.461340206185567
3678486,4,B001L57ZZG,"Lady Spencer: All of London is talking.
Georgiana, The Duchess of Devonshire: Oh, let them talk!

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. An arranged marriage to the older and wealthy Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes) made young Georgiana (Keira Knightley) a Duchess.
2. Unfortunately, the Duke was a man of few words, and the job description for his wife included only three tasks - bear heir; look pretty; no talking.
3. This did not sit well with the vivacious, articulate and charismatic Duchess, whose baby switch seemed set on pink instead of blue, and who had a natural flair for partying and politics
4. Soon the Duke starts triangulating the relationship, and the Duchess retaliates with a bit of Earl Grey.
5. Everyone lives scandalously ever after

Excellent acting performances are given by Fiennes and Knightley, as well as by the always impressive Charlotte Rampling (Lady Spencer, mother of Georgiana), Dominic Cooper (Earl Grey, also from Mamma Mia!) and Hayley Atwell (Bess Foster, really close friend of the Duke and Duchess)

The costumes and settings are breathtaking, and although somewhat lacking in depth, this movie adaptation of the life of Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire does not disappoint as pure entertainment.

3678487,4,B001L57ZZG,"Earlier this year we were treated to a look at Tudor England in the film ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" that opened with magnificent diffused shots of lovely fair-haired children scampering carefree through a bucolic sun-infused backdrop. All those fat-cheeked cherubs with their hair flapping in the wind definitely testified to innocent times for even before these babes hit puberty they were immersed in political intrigue to promote their families and their legacy. Did it faze them? No. We, the collective modern audience, must not let our studied egalitarianism confuse what may seem as a limited and unfair way of life. Obsessed with the acquisition of a male heir, the men and women in this film and now in director Saul Dibb's ""The Duchess"" understand and accept their roles and move accordingly like partners in a precise cotillion to ascertain success. Both sexes were expected to perform their duties to maintain succession with nary a powdered wig becoming skewed or a piece of big two-foot-tall hair coming out of place. And after the blessed event transpired, the semblance of propriety remained with the ubiquitous stiff upper lip reining in secrets that were wild and woolly enough to curl the real hair underneath all that sculpted artifice.

In ""The Duchess"" Keira Knightly plays the witty beautiful 18th century fashionista and politically correct Georgina Spenser Cavendish, duchess of Devonshire with a portrait-perfect insouciance that quickly sours once she realizes that her feather-in-her-cap marriage is nothing more than a sham that will provide the ennui-prone and rather dim-witted duke (the incomparable Ralph Fiennes) with the boy child he desires to carry on his name. Like one of her present-day descendents, (Georgina is the 4X great-aunt to the tragic Diana, Princess of Wales) the Spenser depicted in this based-on-a-true-story biopic wants and needs only affection from older hubby William and gets nothing but lackluster loving, a first-hand look at frequent dalliances with the servants, and the maternal responsibility of rearing one of his by-blows. After the birth of two girl children and multiple miscarriages, Georgina is faced with the ultimate humiliation: the object of William's infidelities has narrowed to Bess, Georgina's best friend, who fleeing her abusive husband has sought refuge in the Cavendish home.

Not that the Duchess is any angel. From the opening idyllic scene (more beautiful young people running through green meadows) the audience knows that she is smitten with Charles Grey from the get-go. That she shares his politics--the Cavendishs were supporters of the infant Whig party--and his dream for a better world becomes more and more evident as her life with the duke wanes on an emotional level. G, as she is known to her friends, unwisely figures that if the Duke can have his cake and eat it too, why not she, the modern-thinking Duchess? Nevertheless, while attempting to persuade her husband to accept her indiscretion if she accepts his, G finds herself sadly outmaneuvered. Why would someone with so much power and backed by the buttress of convention agree to give a mere possession so much leeway? Poor G, as clever a gambler as she is, cannot beat odds that are stacked so unfavorably against her.

Knightly shows her desperation with pink pre-Sephora-ed cheeks and pretty lip-glossed moues; slightly tipsy from the huge offsetting wigs, she seems off balance, her tightly corseted stick figure somehow not altogether in conjunction with the glamour of her spectacular face. Showing her strength in her somewhat rigid jaw line, she pouts rather than sneers like she did in the `Pirates of the Caribbean' trilogy and still uses those expressive eyes and strong eyebrows to convey her desperation as she did in ""Atonement."" However lovely, she tends to jerk about in a flurry of motion rather than suggest the quiet stillness of a lady of that century.

Fiennes, on the other hand, plays the historically one-note duke with a nuanced compassion. Undoubtedly the villain of this piece, Fiennes searches deeply for the soul of this character and somehow relays to the audience that it is not the duke that is solely to blame for all this wasted protocol but society itself. While G shines in the opulence provided by the Cavendish money, William willingly takes a backseat to her popularity always appearing faintly bewildered and aghast at being in the center of attention during any of the many public shows of affection directed towards his wife. However, when his omnipotence is challenged, Fiennes' reacts with the certainty that one would expect from a duke. The modern ideas of individualism did not exist at this time; the duke approached whatever fell under his domain as his possession and treated all as such. Softness is shown only to his much loved dogs, all else with the sternness befitting one accustomed to getting his way. G's airy desire for Utopia crumbles in the shadow of William's steely realism.

From a purely technical standpoint, this film wastes little time on unnecessary scenes romantic or otherwise. Dibb tells his story with a precise almost terse rhythm punctuating it with the aristocratic Rachel Portman score that plays in the back of the audience's mind like Handel's `Sarabande with Variations.' Visually pleasing-- Knightly shines in over 25 elaborate costumes that make you wonder what couture houses were thinking back then for both men and women patrons--""the Duchess"" transports one back to an earlier time when life was as complicated as the clothing.

Bottom line? ""The Duchess"" tells the story of an enchanting 18th century Spenser that like her modern day descendant must kowtow to a duty that robbed her of the romantic love she desired. Despite her obvious advantages--her life's similarities to that of Diana's seem uncanny as both shared a popularity with the public, were beleaguered by the paparazzi, established fashion trends and were extolled for their obvious love for their children--Georgina Spenser's relatively short life was dappled with the same marked sorrow that plagued Diana. Spectacularly beautiful, this film must be viewed from the vantage point of a society that expected much from their aristocrats and apparently still does. Like ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" ""The Duchess"" ends with the visual wish to return to an innocence epitomized by children running freely in a verdant field. Aristocratic money cannot buy happiness but it can at least purchase a backdrop and costumes that provide a semblance of what other people want. Recommended, although those viewing with adolescents or children be aware that the film contains a rape, a lesbian love scene and rather chilling scenes of loveless child begetting.

3678489,4,B001L57ZZG,"A lot of people think of British period drama as stuffy and boring, a reputation it occasionally does something to deserve, but history is anything but dull, and if you were under the impression that the past was a place of strong moral values and happy marriages that has given way to our current immoral society full of single parents and extramarital affairs, think again.  Consider the subject of the life of Georgiana Spenser Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire (Keira Knightley).

Married young by her mother (Charlotte Rampling, in a wonderfully controlled performance) to William Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes), the foremost peer of the realm, she finds quickly that her husband (who she met only twice beforehand) is a cold and distant fellow who is only interested in a male heir.  Already tasked to mother his bastard daughter Charlotte, she gives birth to two daughters, to the disgust of the Duke, who has a series of mistresses that she tolerates.  The Duchess becomes a social marvel, hobnobbing with Whig politicians like Charles James Fox (Simon McBurney) and Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper, later 2nd Earl Grey and Prime Minister) and politician/esteemed playwright Richard Sheridan (Aidan McArdle), whose ""School for Scandal"" was based heavily on the Cavendishes' marriage.  She eventually finds a close friend in Lady Elizabeth (Bess) Foster (Hayley Atwell), and invites her to live with them, which turns out to have dangerous consequences when the Duke initiates an affair with her, and refuses to expel her.  She then finds herself living in a forced menage a trois (subtle humour found in the three of them eating silent breakfasts together).  Understandably, she finds herself increasingly drawn to Grey.

The dramatic core of ""The Duchess"" is an examination of the limited social prospects for women in this period (though, as an aside, one imagines a great many poor women from this period would gladly enter a loveless marriage to live like Georgiana does), and their limited legal rights.  Both Bess and Georgiana face adulterous husbands who hold over them the prospect of never seeing their children again as a price of leaving; getting her children back is, indeed, Bess's motive for embarking on her affair with the Duke, who, as a powerful lord, is easily able to finagle it.  Georgiana, likewise, initially decides to choose freedom over her daughters, but cannot.  The Duke, for his part, is a controlling fellow, raised in a very patriarchal worldview; Fiennes expertly shows his emotional straitjacketing, which at odd moments make him mildly sympathetic, though he mostly is not, particularly at the conception of his long-desired son.  He's normally at a loss when called to talk about feelings.

Keira Knightley, once again travelling back in time to the 18th century (her fifth or sixth visit, I believe), does a fine job as Georgiana.  Hayley Atwell is likewise very good as Bess, a character who walks the finest line between sympathy and dislike from the audience.  There's a curious scene included which seems to suggest at a rather different dynamic between the two women, though this doesn't go anywhere.  Fiennes, as mentioned, does his best in a rather staid role.  Dominic Cooper as the young semi-radical Grey is suitable, though not of the same calibre as the other actors.  McBurney and McArdle are scene-stealers in small parts as Georgiana's sympathetic male acquaintances.  The set design, as one would expect, is stunning.

While not in the highest tier of British period pieces, this is a fine addition to the genre.",1228608000,128,3585,5.11663807890223
3678490,4,B001L57ZZG,"A sad testament to the rigors of 18th century English society and women's roles, The Duchess tells the story of Georgiana Spencer (Keira Knightly) and her marriage to the older Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes). The product of a society that relegates women to window dressing and child-bearing, at sixteen Georgiana is filled with romantic notions and little information about the demands of marriage. Frolicking with her companions on the lawn of her family's estate- including future prime minister and lover Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper) - Georgiana is thrilled to learn of a marriage proposal by the impressive Duke of Devonshire. All the duke requires is a male heir and his bride-to-be is certainly capable of fulfilling her husband's demands. On the pointed advice of her mother (an intimidating Charlotte Rampling), Georgiana casts her self into the role of wife, quickly disabused of any frivolous romantic notions on her wedding night. Unfortunately, Georgiana bears the duke three girls, her husband increasingly chagrined and ill-tempered as his wife disappoints him with the birth of each new daughter.

Stoic and rigid when it comes to his wife, Fiennes plays the distant husband to perfection, indulging in extra-marital affairs and ignoring his wife's obvious suffering when she discovers his penchant for callous infidelity. Georgiana responds as best she can, given the restraints of society, becoming the darling of the social set, charming and witty, a trendsetter who captivates the imaginations of those who enjoy her company, male and female. One admirer is Whig party leader Charles Fox, but there are many. Georgiana is a skillful raconteur regardless of her deep disappointment with marriage. On an outing to Bath, Georgiana makes a new friend, a woman suffering the loss of her children through her powerful husband's interference. The kind-hearted Georgiana welcomes this woman into her home only to know the most grievous betrayal of all and the beginning of her deepest despair.

Georgiana's is a tragic life, a woman trapped by society's expectations. Knightly captures the essence of this woman's dilemma, her fresh beauty quickly marred by the reality of her situation. The one time Georgiana dares to break from her restrictive marriage and cold husband, seeking love in the arms of her lover, Charles Grey, she suffers immediate repercussions, brought quickly to heel by the man who controls every aspect of her life, especially her children. English society is not kind to women when they escape the boundaries set by men. As much as Georgiana is loved by the public, her behavior is scandalous. Although a somewhat repentant duke welcomes his defeated wife home, it begs belief that Georgiana's life would really change for the better, save her acceptance of the limitations of the marriage. Still, this is a thoughtful commentary on the marriage of a spirited young woman who endures a similar fate long before the memorable Diana Spencer, her relative.

3678491,4,B001L57ZZG,"""The Duchess"" is a wonderful costume drama based on the life of Princess Diana's ancestor Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire, who was celebrated and scandalous in her time, which was late 18th century England.

Georgiana was given in an arranged marriage to the Duke of Devonshire (a wonderful performance by Ralph Fiennes), who had only met her twice previously. The Duke is desperate for a male heir, and soon, Georgiana soon finds herself in a loveless marriage and the mother of three girls - two born of Georgiana and one born of a maid who had an affair with Devonshire. Even after bearing the indignities of her husband constant affairs, Georgiana becomes a darling of English society, known for her fashion sense, political activism, and love of gambling.

But Georgiana draws the line, or tries to draw the line, when Devonshire takes a live-in lover and her three children. She eventually begins an affair with a young politician that threatens her way of life.

The film paints an appropriately bleak picture of what it was like for a woman in those days. Georgiana is a beautiful, intelligent, and charming young woman whose only hope in life is that she happens to marry someone who loves her and will treat her like a human being. As it turns out, Devonshire becomes increasingly unlikeable as he expects Georgiana to abide by his affairs, then sit in silence as he keeps another woman and her children under their roof, and not just any woman, but one that had become a good friend of Georgiana.

The movie is beautifully filmed and the performances are very good. The story tells a compelling story of a woman trapped by her times and circumstances and forced to make terrible choices.",1228003200,354,1703,4.802047781569966

3678604,5,B001L57ZZG,"I must disagree with those who found this movie to be unengaging, poorly written, or melodramatic. Keira Knightley was able to take on a role of a lady within a past society where women were very much controlled by men. She acted this splendidly and with much emotion, much as she did within the movie pride and prejudice. The orchestral choice for each scene was beautifully depicted and the overall message of the movie was moving. This, I would argue was not dramatic, but rather written the way it was for the purpose of conveying a message of suppression within this time era, as she could not make her own choices which was the reason for her overall unhappiness. I loved it, most movies or shows like this tend to contain too much drama in the sense that the plot is about the women's control over the men, how they earned power through their marriage and used it to their advantage. This movie was about the sentiments of one main character and her unjust life of which was rather saddening, which is not dramatic in the least, in my opinion, but rather showcases the lives of many women within that time era.",1513555200,6,1117,4.534653465346534

The cast is excellent, the costumes and sets are superb.  If you're unfamiliar with Georgiana's story or the upper-class mores of the time, the plot may drag or seem confusing.  For all of the heaving bosoms and lingering glances, a lot goes unsaid.  In the book Fox played a much more central role and there was considerably more information about Georgiana's role in politics than was implied here.  The roles of gambling, debt and fashion were also underplayed in the film.  Perhaps I've become too accustomed to mini-series or multi-season format...I expected more detail given the length and breadth of Georgiana's influence and the parallels in the life of her descendant, Diana Spencer/Princess Diana.  Given the ""shorter"" format of a theatrical film, the Duchess delivers and is a must-see for lovers of historical costume drama.",1513036800,,974,5.05625

3678610,2,B001L57ZZG,"The real Georgiana Cavendish was an interesting character - worth a movie, and the makers of The Duchess stayed relatively close to history.  The movie tries to make you feel sorry for Georgiana, and judging from the reviews, it reached its goal.  However;  it was common for aristocrats of that time period to have mistresses, and she would have know that - it would not have been considered abusive at that time.  Consequently;  it was considered socially acceptable for her to have a lover after she had a son (she did it before having a son).  Also; repeatedly rubbing the viewers noses in her supposed misery seems a questionable method to hold our attention (especially considering all the other interesting historical material they could have covered).  In addition, the show is very slow - it is as if they had to fill space.
The historical Duke of Cavendish was very rich (maybe the richest man in England), and Georgiana gambled obsessively.  It is documented that the Duke paid one of her gambling debts that was over 300,000 pounds - this is equal to about $400,000,000. (U.S. dollars) today, and she had many other gambling debts she manipulated other people to pay for.  Do you feel sorry for her now?
In conclusion:  Most viewers enjoyed it so give it a chance, but consider skipping the movie, and reading Wikipedia on Georgiana Cavendish.",1512172800,3,1355,4.8268398268398265

I decided to stick through it anyway, fast-forwarding as necessary, because I had enjoyed earlier scenes. And the costumes are good. However, the plot, and the quality of the script-writing, took a bad turn when Lady Bess was invited to move into the house. But, when the bizarreness of Lady Bess going to the countryside with Lady Georgiana occurred, after all the ludicrous twists before that made Lady Besss repudiation of the lover who controls her childrens fate and sudden renewal of friendship with his wife extremely unlikely, I stopped the video.

3678622,4,B001L57ZZG,"Some time after the beginning of the film we hear the phrase ""freedom in moderation"" and I believe this to be one of many basis to the film. Georgaina is young, beautiful, rich, has the attention of all of society and is a Duchess to top it off.. Everyone wants to know her or be her but if they knew the truth, would they ? Of course, anything that happens inside her home is privy to all of society - freedom ? in moderation I suppose.

But lets leave that phrase aside. Lets not talk of the constraint on freedom implemented by men. Of course all that was infuriating but of equal focus should be the inherent constraint placed on existing.

I think a lesson that Georgaina has learned is that we aren't truly free in the greater sense of the word. She experiences this with love ... the most volatile and purest of emotions. We are tied by love, our politics, religion, emotion, etc. or like choosing your love for one thing over your love for another.",1510617600,3,956,4.365168539325842

And each time I hate the Duke, and Bess, and weep for G. I haven't read the book, perhaps I will one day. It is justone of those movies like Little Women and Withering Heights, and Gone with the Wind that I just love to watch. I love watching Ralph Finnes  play all these psycho characters, he really gets you into a love hate relationship with the Duke - one minute you hate him, the next you feel sorry for him. The entire cast was well played  and I really appreciate watching it. I try to put myself back in that time, and honestly I'm so glad I wasn't there.

3678667,1,B001L57ZZG,"As a lover of Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire, I hated this movie. I do not think I've ever hated a movie more. Her character is butchered in this rendition. If you want a fictional period drama, this is a good movie for you. Do not consider this the real story of Georgiana Cavendish. Somewhere she is turning over in her grave.

**SPOILERS**
She loved Bess with all her heart, and never once demanded that she leave. In fact, when Bess had two illegitimate children by the Duke, Georgiana allowed them to grow up in her house. She, Bess and the Duke and a very happy relationship because Bess knew how to appease each of them and she, by turn, lived a very comfortable life in their house. They had their ups and downs, but overall it was a menage trois that worked well for all involved.

Georgiana put her children above all else. She would never have debated between Charles Gray and her children. She struggled to give up Eliza, but she was able to be Eliza's godmother so that she could still see her regularly. The real Georgiana was a gracious and kind woman who showed as much love as possible to everyone, except herself.

She was exceptional in politics, and did more than just attract attention. She was a key advisor to Fox, the Prince of Wales, and many other Whig members. At times she was all that kept the party together.",1488585600,2,1344,4.477551020408163
3678668,5,B001L57ZZG,"Beautiful, but sad movie.  Showed how women, with no right to vote, say or inherit because of society's view of how women were to behave in the era of this movie.  Sadly these societal norms continue on today in many countries.  America still cannot vote a woman into the office of President.  Although this true story took place in England, I admire the English people for doing away with slavery before America did and did not have a civil war to come to the realization that all humans are equal.  They also had several female leaders who actually ruled better then men.  I dream of the day when a woman will be President, but I fear it will be after I am gone from this earth.  The irony of the election of 2016 is how a very wealthy man accused a Muslim woman who lost her son's life while saving others family's sons of being forbidden to speak.  To date I have not heard anything profound from this wealthy man's third wife of any significance, only another woman's words and a prayer.  Perhaps this third wife has to wander the halls of our white house looking out for a man in his robe and making sure she is on time for dinner.  Perhaps she should watch this movie and free herself from a man who gropes other women while carrying this man's child.  So perhaps the era this movie portrays lives in our white house today.

Multiple sex scenes and a rape scene are not magic tools that make a weak movie better - all they did for this movie was gross me out. The costumes are beautiful and that's about the only good thing to be said for it. Characters remain undeveloped and flat, plot tedious, and the understanding of history very simplified. I was disgusted and bored. 95 % of it is regular crude romance novel stuff--the other 5 % is a last minute attempt to do a dark women's drama. If the latter is what you're looking for, go see Volver with Penelope Cruz. Much better and less fake.",1470700800,2,711,4.353383458646617

3678784,4,B001L57ZZG,"This film is largely based on the actual life of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, the renowned Georgian beauty, political and intellectual hostess, and lover of Earl Grey (yes, the one who invented the delicious tea--who knew he was such a stud!), and an ancestress of Princess Di.  I've never cared much for Keira Knightly except in 'Love, Actually'--one tries to suppress the dreadful 'Pride and Predjudice'--but she is remarkably good here. Despite that, it's Ralph Finnes who runs away with the film, as Georgiana's husband the initially cold and utterly selfish Duke of Devonshire, whose glacial exterior masks a caring and rather loving nature (by the standards of the time). Dominic Cooper is clever and very studly as Mr, Grey (not yet an Earl), and Charlotte Rampling is superb as Georgiana's mother, Lady Spencer, caring and affectionate, but cold and implacable, again by the standards of the time. In fact, very few films have ever recreated the true zeitgeist of an era as well as this one. It's truly as if one had stepped back into the era.",1446940800,13,1056,4.932584269662922

3678789,4,B001L57ZZG,Costumes and hair designs were fabulous as were settings.  Keira Knightley looked better than ever.  Not so much her acting.  She didn't mature with her character.  Still seemed 17 yrs. old through the whole movie.  Didn't care much for the story line but that's the fault of the author.,1446768000,,287,4.775510204081633
3678790,5,B001L57ZZG,"The way the British Monarchy treated woman as possessions, make me sick.  This is still a great movie; it is a shame Princess Diane didn't view it before she married old Charles; could have save her a lot of grief knowing that this bs was still in his blood line.  I think it was well done and very thought provoking as to how far things have come since this time.

3678815,4,B001L57ZZG,"I feel I was missled into watching this movie, as Amazon's description was that the main character ""was reviled for her extravagant political and personal life."", and I was expecting a somewhat more villainous (interesting) Duchess.  This Duchess was not reviled by anyone I can recall in the movie, with the possible exception of her unsympathetic husband.  Aside from that misunderstanding(?) on my part, I was ably to enjoy ""The Duchess"" for it's BEAUTIFUL costumes and locations, and some very fine acting.  That greatly helped me to overlook a pretty simple if not predictable plot.  Romantic drama just isn't my thing, at least not without a devious or reviled character, as I was promised.  I did enjoy it and I'd have seen it anyway and been satisfied even without the false promise.",1445644800,3,791,4.962121212121212

The combined efforts of those who made this film enable the viewer to maintain a heightened state of anticipation and interest throughout. The themes of dedication, loyalty,unrequited love, and personal freedom are examined fruitfully. For those who are sensitive by nature, there may be parts that you need to fast forward through because they are a bit too intense, but these are just a few moments that are used to illustrate the story.

No strong woman would've fared well. The Duchess was miserable & not too savvy. Why did she bother to ask her husband if she could have an affair? Steal hubby's money someway and then run off to America with the man she loved & take her children with her. Instead she chose to stay with a man that didn't love her & wasn't kind. But he was loaded and very high up in society. The Duchess chose material wealth and standing over love and happiness. Yes, it would've been difficult but not impossible.

3678968,5,B001L57ZZG,"Perhaps my cinematic standards are lower than some other reviewers, but I thought this movie was very well made: superb scenery, excellent costumes, handsome actors playing their roles credibly, appropriate music well orchestrated and played. We watched it at one go, which we rarely do, and quite enjoyed ourselves.

There is, to be sure, one negative aspect of this and similar films, which other reviewers have mentioned, and with which I entirely agree: it is unfair to ask us to sympathize with, even pity people living in almost unimaginable luxury. The Devonshire palace is a vast pile filled with marble and art works to dwarf the collections of most museums. An army of servants guarantees that neither the Duke nor the Duchess nor any guest will ever have to move a chair, open a door, or exert the slightest effort to do anything, while everything is kept spotless and shining. Every meal consists of the finest foods and wines prepared by the best chefs and served on the finest china, crystal, and silver. If in the midst of such luxury some men and women still contrive to be unhappy, so much the worse for them, but nobody outside their charmed circle should be asked to shed a tear on their behalf.  To enjoy a movie like this one, it is simply essential to take it on its own terms and forget the fundamental immorality of the entire enterprise. We did, and we enjoyed it.",1438473600,7,1389,4.688524590163935

3678994,4,B001L57ZZG,"Keira Knightley deserves kudos for playing Duchess Georgiana of Devonshire, England. She played the eighteenth century duchess with humor, style, and grace. She gave her credibility and a soul. I never even heard of the Duchess until now.

Based on the historical book about her life, she married the Duke of Devonshire (played wonderfully by Ralph Fiennes) with her mother's approval (played splendidly by Charlotte Rampling OBE).

The Duchess is a complicated woman of intelligence and character. She becomes the life of the party at any event. She is a celebrity of her time. She set the fashion trends of the time. She was quite a character.

After having two daughters and raising the duke's itiligitimate daughter. The duke seems unable to father a son instead of daughters. Georgiana loves her stepdaughter like her other children whose mother had died and came to live with them.

When they vacation in Bath, Georgiana befriends Lady Elizabeth ""Bess"" Foster, a battered wife and mother whose sons are kep away by their father. Bess (Hayley Atwell) becomes more involved into the Duke and Duchess' marriage by living with them. The situation must have raised eyebrows in their time. The Duchess seeks to find love elsewhere with Charles Grey.

The casting is first rate with experienced actors. Keira has come a long way from playing football in ""Bend It Like Beckham"" a few years prior to this role. The art direction and costumes spared no expense in this production.

There are extra features in the making of the film; the history; and the period costumes. The Duchess had to wear a lot in her time. The hairstyles and costumes were extravagant and heavy.

The film is entertaining as well. Based on the history of a historic figure, the Duchess is a colorful complex woman ahead of her time. Keira should have earned accolades for playing her.",1437091200,,1855,4.926282051282051

3679006,4,B001L57ZZG,"The Duchess

The Duchess has a fatal flaw as a film.  We are to believe the Duke, Ralph Fiennes, is immune to the charms of his wife and Duchess-Keira Knightly.  Once the viewer discards this absurdity he can enjoy the movie.
 The cinematography is brilliant.  The incredible interiors of the homes of the Duke of Devonshire are lavish.  They are palaces in all but name.  Ditto the grounds.  What is the difference between 18th Century English aristocrats and West Virginia trailer park hillbillies?  The morals are the same but the English have more polished manners.  It seems that blended families are nothing new.  There are two women living with the Duke.  A grand total of seven children are involved, three mothers and three different fathers.
The Duke is literally given Keira Knightly, gift wrapped in a series of spectacular gowns, but is too obtuse and cold to enjoy the gift.  He seems to prefer any one but her.  Only an actor of Fiennes ability could make this even partly believable.  Knightly, who has acted as a soccer player, a pirate, a bounty hunter and a Pict Princess, is super in this costume drama.
The Duchess of Devonshire, an actual woman, had a terrible, heartbreaking marriage.  She endured much for the sake of duty and her children.  Her distant descendent was Lady Di, The Princess of Wales, lamentably passed from us.  The comparison of the two Spencer women is inevitable.
The movie runs 1hr 50 minutes.  I would like to say that this is a thinking movie, exploring the place of women in a mans world, but I cannot.  This is an emoter.  We feel more about the protagonists than we think about them.  But I did like it much better than last years movie about Queen Elizabeth.  Three saw blades for the gorgeously filmed PG13 The Duchess.",1436400000,,1771,4.697068403908795

3679109,4,B001L57ZZG,"This is a very well acted period drama that follows a very head strong 17 year old girl through her marriage to a much older duke. Their marriage is strictly a business arrangement for the duke who wants a male heir.  She has to adjust to living with a husband who is the only person in the area that is not in love with her.  She uses the power of her position and her beauty to encourage liberal ideals that are in direct opposition to her husband.  She has two daughters, a lover, and a very close women friend.  The duke gives her a choice: give up the lover or he will take ""his"" daughters away from her.  This true story highlights the incredible inequities between rich titled white men and the rest of the population, including their wives.  One can see why the gross injustices of a system based on supposed nobility (a legacy of the feudal period in England) had to change.  During the time of ""The Duchess"" the power of the ""nobility""  was in full force.  It is interesting to contrast this drama with the BBC drama ""Downton Abby""  where the power of the nobility was finally coming to an end.",1432944000,2,1104,4.367647058823529

3679168,5,B001L57ZZG,"I cannot imagine living life as depicted in this film. I suspect it was easier to be among the poor than the rich in certain situations; however, being female wasn't the ideal gender to live if there was no love to be had. I cannot imagine who had it worse -- Her Grace -- or the witnesses to her life. This film clarified for me that although women today have various complaints, issues and feel bound and subdued by politics and 'the good ol' boys club' -- the fact remains that women today can choose many many things that only a few years ago were unheard of. The drive for equality continues and we all of us can be grateful that the drive is alive and well. This film is worth every minute of time to watch and gives clear evidence that life today is much much better than all the pretty gowns and 'privilege' of wealth purported to be during those times. I have often thought it would be fun to live in those times but I now rethink that position. Keira is quite versatile with her skills as an actor...will have to look up more of her work.",1430870400,17,1048,4.245

3679265,5,B001L57ZZG,"Before watching THE DUCHESS, I had wrongly dismissed it for years as just another period piece featuring the lovely but overused-in-this genre Keira Knightley. How wrong was I!

This movie does feature the outrageously lush set design, locations, and costumes you would expect from a high-budget historical drama, but it does so in total enhancement of the story. Based on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-biography-by-award-winning-historian-Amanda-Foreman/dp/0375753834/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the biography by award-winning historian, Amanda Foreman</a>, THE DUCHESS tells the life story of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, a woman who was married off by her mother (Charlotte Rampling) at 18 to a wealthy and powerful noble, William Cavendish (Ralph Fiennes).

All the beauty and extravagance of William's home means little when he unceremoniously beds her on their wedding night. Fiennes is nearly void as William. There are glimmers of humanity from time to time, signs that he himself feels imprisoned by his lot in life, but they are washed away just as quickly by his mysogyny and rape of Georgiana. Fiennes also gives him this hateful tick of humming whenever he feels uncomfortable, uncertain, or dismissive. He's a character who will garner little sympathy even though the script does allow him a few moments of reflection.

In contrast is Dominic Cooper as Charles Grey, future Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and a man who Georgiana has loved deeply even before her loathsome marriage. It does not matter that William has had many affairs and taken in a live-in lover, Lady Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell), but he refuses to permit Georgiana a modicum of the same. He desires only two things from Georgiana: loyalty and a male heir. William recognizes their love but will not be embarrassed by an adulterous wife. As he says, ""[Charles] is a dreamer like yourself. You both dream of another world that does not exist, and never will.""

The movie shows with contrasting beauty Georgiana's position as a radical force in elections and fashion, her bisexuality, the heavy weight of being seen solely as a machine to produce a male heir, and what a mother will sacrifice for her children. More generally it addresses the limited lives women led in the 18th century, the growing power of the Whig party, the place of nobility in politics, and the horrors of gender inequality in both public and private life.

Highly recommended.",1428192000,,2490,5.407216494845361

according to Wikipedia, her husband, upon hearing of this staggering amount stated ""is that all"".

we should all be so lucky eh!?

apparently her niece, Lady Caroline Lamb was not so wise, at least according to the film of many years ago; which is quite a cinematic pot boiler.
the transfer to dvd was not good many years ago, but perhaps it has been re-mastered.

3679465,3,B001L57ZZG,"First, I have to be clear that I didn't see the whole of this film: the writing and performances were solid, I just couldn't finish it, once it became clear that it was going to be yet another historical drama where there was a lot of focus on the sexual perversions of one of the main characters.  Why is this such a prevalent theme in historical drama? Maybe some might think I have no business writing a review of a film I didn't see to the end, and they'd have a point.  However, based on other reviews I've seen on Amazon, I'm guessing I'm not the only one who appreciates being warned in advance about the nature of any explicit content.  So, be forewarned; this film skirts the edge of PG-13 rating, with a shot of a nude housemaid departing what was obviously a tryst with the master, as his wife enters the scene, upon which unpleasantly suggestive marital dysfunction ensues. That was where I shut the movie off.",1424390400,,922,4.443786982248521

Georgina Devonshire made quite an impact in her day; but Ms Knightley's performance, like those from so many of today's superficially attractive actors, lacks depth or substance.

To decide to stay in her home with her husband's mistress was phenomenal, as we observed her pain in all this I kept wondering when she was going to receive something good in her life. When she gave up her baby I thought it couldn't get any worse.

3679524,4,B001L57ZZG,"I enjoyed the movie and it motivated me to find out more about the duchess's life.  She was 17 when she married and the duke was only 24.  This is a big difference from how their ages are represented in the movie.  He is portrayed by an actor in his 40's or 50s, although the actual duke was a young man.  Also, Georgiana gave birth to no living children at all for nine years.  In the movie the time frame is not shown and the viewer is left to believe that she soon gave birth to daughters which the duke rejected.  I think they wanted to make his panic over having no male heir less understandable.  If he really believed girl children had no value, he wouldn't have insisted on bringing home the daughter he had with the maid and raising her as one of the family.  Also, Georgiana left behind a huge gambling debt when she died- she was a gambling addict.  She had been afraid to disclose the amount to her husband.  When he finally found out after her death at age 48, he just said, ""Is that all?""  Her mother, who is a formidable matriarch in the film-  lost all of her own inheritance by gambling.  This is an enjoyable movie, keeping in mind that it is heavily fictionalized to minimize the duchess's flaws and maximize those of the duke.  It is entertainment rather than history. I agree with the other reviewers:  wonderful sets and excellent acting.",1420243200,,1360,4.384

3679536,2,B001L57ZZG,"This was a disappointing movie. The filmmakers had everything going for them--a wonderful production and cast, access to authentic locales, and a worthy subject for a biopic--but they failed to make a movie worthy of her. Rather, they made a movie that looked beautiful, but ultimately felt hollow and pointless. The movie never really delves into Georgiana's life or her accomplishments, never shows the brilliant, vibrant woman she must have been. Instead, the film portrays her as an eternal victim who merely dances to whatever tune is piped for her. In the end, this was just a soap opera in fancy Georgian costumes, recycling tired modern themes about feminism and privilege. (Note to filmmakers: that bit about the rule of thumb? It's a myth. One that was exposed long ago. Really. You could look it up.)",1420156800,2,811,4.970588235294118

While the actors did a good job with their characters, there wasn't too much they could do with their characters without overacting.

3679604,2,B001L57ZZG,"I don't understand why everyone liked it so much. From learning a little about the history of the actual Gerogina, it seems like her charasma and the story's intrigue was not conveyed in the film. The makers focused on many of the beautiful letters which are preserved that she wrote. Why didn't they use them in the film? The pace and tone of the film never changes. It's monotonously melancholy and slow. That killed the chance I had to care about the characters.",1419465600,,465,4.614457831325301
3679605,5,B001L57ZZG,"To begin, how can one describe the injustices intelligent women have had to suffer for millenia?  Here a naive young woman's compassionate nature is compromised by her own family when given into a loveless marriage.  Her brutish husband just happens to be a Duke whose main goal is to provide a male heir.  Gee, how easy can THAT be???  The two characters' evolve as he teaches his seemingly impetuous wife about ""respectable"" love and forces her to comply with the mores of  English society.  An important subplot also emerges as we witness 2 women supporting each other through circumstances only they could share or understand.

If you enjoy romantic period pieces with sumptuous costumes and gorgeous settings this movie is a great ""getaway"".  A world of balance, elegance, and grace support  Keira Knightly as she ""morphs"" into the popular, trend setting Duchess who converses as an equal with the men around her.  The Duke (Fiennes) eschews social niceties since in his position he does as he pleases in ALL parts of his life.

If you also like unpredictable turns as each character gets what he wants you'll find this movie intellectually stimulating!",1419465600,,1158,4.979166666666667

3679607,4,B001L57ZZG,I was surprised about how much I enjoyed this movie. The main character was surprising as a young woman eager to be a wonderful wife & mother.

Virtually no plot except the director/producer's bizarre fixation with this wealthy and powerful duchess trapped in a loveless marriage being forced to bear children until the desired male heir is obtained while enduring her husband's adulteries. There is a warning message here to our society... we are moving from fidelity in marriage back to a world such as The Duchess portrays. Where vows mean nothing.

I can't believe that in such a strict time period such open insults to marriage turned a blind eye from society. Lesson is if you have money and power you can get away with anything.

No raw sex, but there is audible during the rape scene (The main character screaming as her husband assaults her.) and, after their marriage, where he disrobes her, but there is nothing not done in good taste.

It's always great to see how people endured such hardships, being royalty. It shows us that life wasn't always a bowl of cherries. She showed great strength in living with someone who didn't show her any love while she was forced to turn a blind eye to her husbands trysts, and then having to live in the same palace with her husband while he had his live in mistress who was her friend.

The movie I think could have been better in regards to story development. For example, at the end I did not feel completely attached to the Duchess and her struggles. The Count of Monte Cristo and Elizabeth were movies where you sort of built this solid bond with the character and smile/cried as they went through their struggles. Perhaps more of her whimsical pursuits or master plans would have won me over. So, I give it an OK.",1415404800,,571,4.345794392523365

The story-line is well written and how the characters' lives play out invokes a multitude of emotions from the movie watcher.  Be prepared to feel joy, wonder, anger, disgust, sadness, grief and curiosity all wrapped with a veil of sexual stirring. The movie is a rare glimpse into the preordained lives of people and societal class structure dictated by the laws of justice of the times. One can't help but compare the morays and attitudes of then v. now.  Somewhere in there, you'll find the old adage ""some things never change"". Keira Knightley and Ralph Fiennes surpass any expectation one might have and the period costumes, architecture, interior designs, impeccable details and scenic countrysides are all a feast for the eyes.

3680215,3,B001L57ZZG,"A nice period piece, shows us the manners and morals of the 18th century British royalty and upper class. Keira Knightly is blushingly beautiful as the suffering wife of her flagrantly profligate husband the Duke, played by Ralph Fiennes. The story reflects a period of interesting contrasts: At the same time America and France are about to explode in revolution, the British remain unwaveringly rigid and two-dimensional. The movie too has a two-dimensional quality. Everyone has a role to play. They're all prisoners of their context. The only people who are free in this story are the small children running, frolicking, and playing their nursery games. Yet they too only seem free, totally unaware that they too lead a choreographed life.",1414454400,,743,5.148760330578512

3680342,5,B001L57ZZG,I first saw this film in theaters. The storyline is interesting. Young girl finds herself in abusive marriage with a man of esteem and power. Through his infidelity she finds her own life and successes but in the end gives them up to remain with her family and protect her lover. It's a truly sad story. Between Kiera and Ralph the acting is quite good and the costume and set design is beyond beautiful.,1413504000,,404,4.472972972972973

3680350,3,B001L57ZZG,"A bit too spicy for its rating. Should be R. I liked the costumes, and period detail etc. Fiennes did a great job. 'I don't make deals' was the best line he had, said with entitlement but also with a certain sufferance, bewilderment I thought, and an awareness of his unique situation in society. I think Daniel Day Lewis could have pulled it off too. It was that kind of role; different, lonely, surly, misunderstood, bad but not all bad. He was fond of his kids.
 I am not sure about Knightley in the title role. I think her deportment wasn't right.
But I read Foreman's book on which it is based and it stuck true to the facts for the most part. She had a good heart, loving her rival's motherless child as her own.
I also took to the Duchess cos of her plea to the Government not to burn Irish villages while putting down the Rising of 1798. (not in the movie) She was a huge gambler, and left a gigantic debt after her death - to which the Duke said, when he heard:'Is that all?'

The historic element was right on the money and they did a fantastic job with the costumes and even little nuances that would have been popular in that time period. I never give book or movie reviews that tell the story, I think that's silly as you will either watch it or not if you are interested and have read some good reviews.

It is a heartbreaking story of a 15 or 16 year old girl married off to a 40 year old duke who expect her to give him a son. I can't imagine ever living her life, especially at such a young age.

3680421,1,B001L57ZZG,"Possibly the worst waste of 2 and a half hours ever. I think there is a conspiracy here. How can one actor be in two of the worst films I have ever seen? If I ever see Ralph Fiennes in another movie credit I will run from the theater screeming. It amazes me that someone looked up the life story of one of the most boring and stuck up couples in the history of the the stuck up British empire and decided to make a movie about them. It would be one thing if Kate Winslett's charector were even the least bit interesting but we basically have a woman willing to be abused in order to have wealth. Poor little rich girl.  Ralf Fiennes barely showed up for the filming. You get the impression that even after making an abomination like ""The English Patient"" this film was so bad and poorly directed that he was almost as bored and uninterested as the audience. Kate Winslett did the poor little rich girl. Except don't expect this to be interesting or entertaining like ""Titanic"". Costumes might be ok if you are into hoop skirts and putting dead birds and foxes on your head. On the other hand go watch Johnny Depp in ""The Lone Ranger"" if you are into people wearing dead birds.

Personally I think this is a conspiracy by the cable companies to put Amazon Prime out of business. Some cable executive said:

Hey Amazon is too popular. I know, lets get someone to add ""The Duchess' to their lineup"". That will teach those cord cutters!",1412899200,3,1432,4.37593984962406

3680497,5,B001L57ZZG,A true to life movie of how it was back then.  Keira Knightley did a magnificent job in portraying the Duchess of Devonshire taking the audience throught the years of the Duchess life.  The Duchess is a decendent of the Earl of Spencer and she is linked to Princess Diana.  I loved this movie.,1412640000,,293,4.388888888888889

3680510,5,B001L57ZZG,I absolutely adore this movie. There is so much strength and passion. At the end of the movie the passion was still there but choices had to be made in order to keep leveled love and harmony. I loved the relationship between the duchess and the other guy (not the duke). Even though they were not married there was something very genuine and honest about their relationship but in the end they matured and made a grown-up decision for the sake of their children and the generations to come.

3680513,2,B001L57ZZG,Actors are all excellent and scenery is beautiful but the movie never really gets into the life and character of the Duchess.  So all we get is her suffering in her marriage.

3680562,4,B001L57ZZG,"The Duchess is based on the true story of Georgiana, The Duchess of Devonshire. A young woman hoping for love, she agrees when  her parents arrange a marriage before she is eighteen. At times the Duchess is beloved by all, others she is reviled for attempting to find happiness outside of her loveliness marriage. In the 1700's, men hold all the power. A husband can beat his wife as long as the stick is not thicker than his thumb, he controls all the money, including what the wife brings to the marriage, and he may send his wife away, refusing her the right to see her children. The Duke has an affair with Georgiana's best friend, and installs her and her three children in their home. In addition, he brings a child born out of wedlock with a maid. After years of trying to sustain a marital relationship, the Duchess has an affair with Charles Fox, and falls in love. Society does not allow women the same leniency that men enjoy, and Georgiana is forced to make a terrible choice. Lavish costumes, stunning sets and superb acting make The Duchess a new favorite.",1412294400,,1070,4.544041450777202

3680567,5,B001L57ZZG,"This beautifully filmed version of the Duchess of Devonshire's life was again ordered for my cousin in US and has not yet been viewed, but is eagerly anticipated.  The DVD arrived in good time.",1412294400,,193,4.676470588235294
3680568,4,B001L57ZZG,"What moves this movie forward and, I believe, motivates most responses to it is its very nuanced, understated but constant sadomasochistic theme, which is relentless. The duke's sadism, as compared to that of Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes' character in ""Schindler's List"") is very much more controlled, assured, almost passive looking, with that pathetic little smile he wears throughout, as if to say he can't help himself. But, indeed, he is the architect of his own destiny, as well as that of those around him.
Keira Knightley, who can shine with the brightest, uses a particular technique to convey the plight of the masochist: she rounds forward her shoulders from the moment of her marriage consummation, as if bearing eternal shame.  Even as the plot continues and the duchess advances through the arc of her character, the utter believability of the accumulation of years upon years of this increasingly sadomasochistic interaction bears down and down on the viewer, to the point of emotional suffering. This, I think, is actually what keeps this beautiful piece of film from getting the higher marks it deserves. The writing, photography,  costume design, set design, music, major acting, and editing are all top notch. Yet there is something disconcerting about the whole project. What it is is the too clear view this film gives us of the ugly underbelly of human interaction: if there is power available to be usurped, human beings will grab it, institutionalize it, take a seat and watch the show as the other guy dies a slow death. That's a fact of life nobody likes to dwell on.",1412294400,3,1590,4.973684210526316

Enough said, this is interesting and it is always sad that one couldn't marry for love alone or even at all.  And morals or immorality is ever rampant in these times.  So interesting.

Ralph Fiennes plays the part of her husband who as you watch his character navigate the frustrations of his times of marrying to produce an heir, still has a trace of humanity left in him. You tend to hate his character but somehow you hang in there with him.

""The Duchess"" is the sad story of a woman ahead of her time who, despite a having a mind of her own, was condemned to suffer the injustices of her time, although she always fought for what she thought that it was fair without ever giving up.

She was abused in ways that never happen today and we never see anything like it now that we have socially evolved to where we are now. I can never imagine this happening again in the future because men have come to see that it wrong to commit adultery, and cheat on their wives. Many of the reviews say that women had it so bad back then and I agree that this never happens today. Men in power never cheat and never treat his wife as an object.

How many times was opportunity thrown at her feet for her to simply get lost in her feelings instead of seeing it for what it is. I could not finish this movie. I had to stop after she makes her announcement at dinner after Mr. Grey comes calling very loudly while she ate supper with the Duke of Devonshire and Lady Bess. That was where I had to say ""omg, this woman is so lacking in common sense that she is going to cause herself and her family more pain than she could ever realize simply because she cannon control her emotions or her words.""",1411171200,,674,4.31496062992126

3680860,2,B001L57ZZG,"Very depressing.

Maybe some will enjoy watching this simply for the historical aspect to it.  But in my opinion, it is not worth sitting through this.

This movie did however improve my opinion of Keira Knightley.  At first when I saw her flouncing about she seemed very out of place. I was expecting to be annoyed through the whole movie by her character.  But as the movie went on I grew to like her character and she did fairly well in representing her.

Overall though, this movie is terrible when it comes to enjoyment.  Almost every scene does nothing but makes you recoil in disgust or feel depressed.  There is no redeeming of the situation.  It is a bleak picture.

The only good thing I can say is that it makes you appreciate how lucky women are today to have the freedom that they have.  But again, it was not worth watching this to appreciate that.",1410739200,2,862,4.461538461538462

For a start, the actors don't even know how to pronounce the name ""Georgiana"". They either say ""Georgina"" or make it rhyme with ""container"". That is ridiculous! The film is not very accurate to the facts, as told in Amanda Foreman's biography, and the choice of Keira Knightley to act Georgiana is not ideal. She does not look like the Duchess of Devonshire (she is far too thin) and she is rather wooden most of the time. Dominic Cooper as Charles Grey, her lover, is very unappealing too.
The film moulds the facts to fit a sort of ""poor little rich girl"" formula, which is bound to have a broad audience appeal. Georgiana's husband was actually only eight years older than her, but here he is presented as old enough to be her grandfather. There is no reference to her friendship with Marie Antoinette or to the fact that she wrote novels and poems. Altogether a bit of a wash-out.",1388707200,4,1043,4.5828877005347595

This is not, frankly, a happy story. Neither does it qualify as raunchy, by the way.

The husband, if you can call him that, was about as tuned in to reality as an unborn child.  These people struggled through their miserable lives, forced into social mores that put them into such emotional bondage, despite the massive amounts of money and prestige.  Frankly, I was unimpressed with their egos and money and narcissistic behavior.  There were no real heroes here, and it was a sad comment on the very rich.

No one stood up for principle, no one fought for anyone but themselves, and the entertainment value was minimal.  I watched it for a minor character, Aidan, who could have added a great deal if he had been allowed.

3680946,3,B001L57ZZG,"It's a superlative movie as far as attention to costumes and women's hair evolving during the last decades of the 18th century, and a real treat for its true locations...but flat and lacking when portraying the main heroine, and Bess - the secondary heroine. In reality, while we are made to believe that Georgiana was the toast of the town for her daring towering hairdos, plumes and costumes, she was much, much more than a pretty presence on the political scene. Georgiana was complex; rebellious and daring, frustrated to the point of bulimia, discontented, chafing under the impotent awareness of her situation...Fine, we get that, but her brilliance is not fully explored. The movie leaves the impression she was little more than a decorative celebrity gawked at and cheered wherever she went.

Bess, the one that came between, is left an unknown quantity in the film. This is unfortunate because she was the sober, strong and practical presence in that household, and vastly interesting in her own right. She also bore the Duke a daughter, going to Italy (like Georgiana) to hide the illegitimate pregnancy and give birth. More intellectually grounded than Georgiana, she took an interest in the literary lights of the day, opened a salon and welcomed progressive ideas, political discussions, debate...In other words, while Georgiana remained directionless - Bess was practical and proactive.

Another point; Georgiana was Godmother to her own child Eliza by Grey (of Earl Grey tea fame, btw) and visited her often, openly, no one pretending not to know her connection with Grey's younger ""sister"". She, like many of her class, had married for advantage and in a world less prudish and hypocritical than the world we live in today, departures from conventional morality were expected and accepted - provided that it was all done with discretion and with a modicum of pretense.",1380326400,2,1884,5.093851132686084

Keira Had every reason to feel slighted and unloved. While you can't condone her behavior, you can see why she could desire it as a way to experience happiness in the midst of such a double standard in her marriage. The way the three of them (her husband, his lover, and the duchess) ate their meals together was positively horrible. She was trapped in a loveless marriage, and despite her love for her children, the continual rejection from her husband robbed the little joy should have had. I have to say that scene where she handed her only baby boy to her lover's family (on her husband's order) made me cry. I felt the agony of the character's hopelessness and grief. The saddest part of all was the fact that this story was based on a true story. So it wasn't just a fictional tale, but based on this duchess's life and her painful experiences.

It was also interesting to see the compromises Georgiana made in order to live a life close to her children... and to continue to pursue her interests in politics and social issues.

Keira Knightley and Ralph Fiennes give a powerful performance, that will bring any woman to tears at many points throughout the film. This is not a happy story but a real one. It's both highly accurate to The Duchess of Devonshire's life as well as gripping in its drama. If one ever wished to understand the true life of an aristocratic woman in Britain during the 1700's - or of any woman helpless in a patriarchal society - this depicts it perfectly. The emotions are raw and real. I'm astonished by what these actors brought to the table. Definitely more of a feminist movie but in a moving manner and one that would not off-put men, but rather enlighten them (hopefully) to the real trials that women faced and even continue to face today.

In some ways while Georgiana's story seems to be predominently personally tragic, but that is partly because the film's one flaw is that it only makes a passing reference to the fact that Georgiana used her money and influence to assist, her lover Charles Grey, and his political allies William Pitt and William Wilberforce to initiate societal change including prison reform, educational initiatives for the poor, founded the first society for the prevention of cruelty to animals and most importantly, worked to end the slave trade.",1360195200,,859,5.128571428571429

Georgiana married William Cavendish, the Duke of Devonshire, when she was 17 and he was 26. Portrayed by Ralph Fiennes, the Duke seemed considerably older.

Without spoiling too much of the movie, the Duke's main interest in Georgiana was producing a male heir. He was portrayed as treating Georgiana heavy-handedly, showing more disrespect than love for her. Cavendish's behavior toward Georgiana was difficult to watch, and Georgiana's attempts at rebellious behavior were as self-deprecating as they were sad. Though there has been some question as to whether Cavendish was as loathsome as he was portrayed, what can be substantiated would be more than enough to push Georgiana into desperation.

For a period drama, the costumes and sets were, for the most part, lovely. There was very little else about the movie that was lovely or enjoyable.",1353715200,4,939,5.2052980132450335

If compared to movies such as ""Sense & Sensibility,"" or ""Pride & Prejudice,"" the plot will fall totally flat.  However, if one is interested in learning something about the Duchess of Devonshire and the time she lived in--while being entertained at the same time---this is the ticket!  ""The Duchess"" is vastly more exciting than watching a biography of her life on an educational channel! The actors are well chosen, and the acting is superb!

This review is from: The Duchess (DVD)
Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""The Duchess"" starring Keira Knightly and Ralph Fiennes. It was a good movie, to be sure, and a very extravagant one and well worth watching, but I just didn't find the movie to be all that enjoyable. It was a movie that had all the markings of an Academy Award feature, but, in my opinion, failed to live up to that status. Well, on the positive side, the movie was just gorgeous. The photography was excellent. The depiction of the English countryside was magnificent. The costumes and physical setting were just overwhelming. Surely, this was ""Best Picture"" stuff. But it just didn't rise to that level. I'd say it was a good, but not a great movie.

The acting was somewhat stiff and formal, as with a lot of British period pieces. Usually, it takes me a while to relax and fall in with the cast and the setting, and with the story. In this movie, it just didn't happen. The characters and their portrayal were unsympathetic. I just didn't care. The film never grabbed me emotionally. By and large, it was stiff and wooden and, although the cast went about their actions in fine competent fashion, it just didn't jell as a gripping story. In fact, other than being visually overwhelming, the royalty period-piece story as portrayed was rather dull and uninteresting. Maybe, if I knew more about British history the movie would have been more interesting, but I doubt it. Pity. An enormous amount of energy obviously went into the filming of this movie. Watch it for what is good, and you'll probably enjoy it, and be forgiving for the weak script and acting.

3681063,3,B001L57ZZG,"Keira Knightley is Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire. Ralph Fiennes is the Duke, an SOB who only wants a son, and a pretty piece of property. But the Duchess is not only beautiful, she is intelligent, spirited and charming.

Poor Duke: he'd wanted a son, and instead he got two daughters, or three if you count the one he brought home which he had sired on one of the maids, who died. Remember that in those days (1770s), it was not known that the father determines the gender of the child.

Georgiana met Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell) at Bath, and brought her home because Mr. Foster had tossed her out, homeless, and won't allow her to see her sons. She soon becomes the Duke's mistress, and he uses his influence to get her visits from her sons.

Young Charles Grey [later Prime Minister, and the one my favorite tea was named for], played by Dominic Cooper, becomes Georgiana's lover, and she . . . no, I won't spoil the story. It's based on a true story, but I won't swear how accurate it is. At the end, several epilogue statements are posted on the screen, and I suspect they are all true.

It's a lovely movie in many ways, including settings and costumes of incredible grandeur. But the limits of being based on a true story is that the ending is not very satisfying. Still, it's worth seeing.",1336694400,,1303,4.46218487394958
3681064,4,B001L57ZZG,"It would be pretty hard to be a fan of period movies and not like ""The Duchess."" As far as period movies go, this one does not disappoint in terms of lavish costuming and set designs.  The story is also an interesting one, which unfolds in a very low-keyed manner which helps to underscore the outrageous events that shape the lives of the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire during the mid-18th century.

Keira Knightley is lovely in the role as Georgiana Spencer, an ancestor of the (equally) romantically star-crossed, Diana Spencer, better known in the supermarket tabloids as simply Princess Di. Georgiana's mother (played by Charlotte Rampling who looks remarkably good for her years) brokers an advantageous marriage for her daughter with the odd and emotionally remote Duke of Devonshire, played by Ralph Fiennes. Predictably, the Duke has less interest in Georgiana as a woman than he does in producing a male heir and their marriage quickly devolves into a study in procreation, minus romantic attachment. As time passes, Georgiana's situation is not aided much by the fact that she initially presents the cold Duke with two daughters. Worse, the Duke then begins a long-standing affair with one of Georgiana's closest friends, Bess Foster, with whom he also fathers a couple of illegitimate children; to heap insult on injury, he then insists that Bess also move into the home that he shares with his wife.

While the story line of ""The Duchess"" probably doesn't sound especially pleasant, it is nonetheless an intriguing study of the strange social mores of British nobility and their steely adherence to obligation and responsibility, even in the face of abject humiliation.  Knightley shines in the difficult role as the lonely Duchess who has been betrayed by nearly everyone that she holds dear. Her performance is restrained but poignant and she brings a quiet dignity to the role of Georgiana that adds an interesting dimension to a woman who was just as dogged by public opinion as her 20th century descendant, Diana, Princess of Wales, would be.

Georgiana manages to break free of the constraints of her unsatisfying marriage and indulges in her own scandalous affair; no great surprise, but her extra-curricular activities are met with a stern, if hypocritical, reprisal from her amoral husband, the Duke.

The movie is an interesting one that may seem tedious at points as the palpable tension between the Duke and Georgiana is steadily building.  However, the movie is well worth seeing; the story explores the life of a most interesting character and provides a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the smothering, hot-house environment that typified the lives of landed gentry.",1335139200,,2692,5.118451025056948

I have seen most of her movies and, for me, this was her best thus far. And of course, although Ralph Fiennes was callous, I just love him as an actor, and he played his part very well.

3681082,5,B001L57ZZG,"When I first saw the trailer for this 2008 film I assumed it was nothing but a costumed piece of fluff set in 18th Century England with a focus on courtship.  I sure was wrong though.  Yes, the costumes and settings are beautiful but this film is based on the true story of the Duchess of Devonshire whose troubled marriage and rather outrageous behavior was not completely unlike that of the future Diana who was actually a distant niece of this famous beauty.  Yes, she was beautiful and Keira Knightly, cast in the leading role is so strikingly attractive that she steals every scene she is in.

Georgiana, the Duchess, was married at the age of 16 to a much older man who was intent on one purpose and one purpose only - that of producing a male heir.  Ralph Fiennes is cast in this role and he gives an spectacular performance as the cold and distant husband who finds it difficult to make even small talk with his wife but, as time goes on, somehow becomes more sensitive.  What follows is a series of ups and downs for the duchess as she bears several girl children and is looked at with contempt by her husband.  Soon, she makes a woman friend who has been abandoned by her own husband and the two exchange confidences.  But their relationship becomes strained, however, when she, too, becomes one of the duke's many mistresses.  Naturally, the duchess takes a lover and more complications ensure.

I loved this film and watched it with my eyes glued to the screen.  I loved the pomp and the costumes and the very fine acting and directing.  This was a BBC film and it certainly captured the time and the place and the manners of the period.  It also specifically displayed the place of women in that society who might be dressed in beautiful clothes but who were powerless in a culture that gave them no rights whatsoever and, especially, no rights to their own children.",1297814400,,1880,4.5266272189349115
3681083,1,B001L57ZZG,"After reading the book this movie is supposed to be ""based"" upon, ""Georgiana: Duchess of Devonshire"" by Amanda Foreman, I was really looking forward to the movie, especially after reading many Rave Reviews.

But in the end its just another dull Period Costume Drama.  The vivid personality of Georgianna is blurred right from the beginning when she agrees to a loveless marriage arranged by her ambitious parents.  In reality, according to the book, it was Georgiana who was ambitious; her parents actually counseled her NOT to marry the insipid dullard-Duke who did not love her.

Her enduring and passionate friendship with Elizabeth Foster is (at first) minimized in the movie, because Mrs. Foster was also the Duke's mistress; when Georgiana in reality did not seem to care in the least, and raised Elizabeth & The Duke's daughter as her own. Perhaps the Producers of the movie didn't think their audience could believe in such a friendship.  Elizabeth herself is not at all interesting in the movie, when she must have been quite remarkable to command the devotion of the Duchess AND Duke (after Georgianna died, the Duke married Elizabeth).

Another remarkable incident in Georgianna's life is that that the Duchess was wandering around (traveling) in revolutionary France when pregnant with the Heir, and had to invite several impartial witnesses to her labor & delivery to affirm that the Heir *was* legitimate.  This is entirely ignored in the movie.

Worst of all, Georgianna's remarkable intellect & abilities are not demonstrated AT ALL. She could be any bimbo aristocrat.  And her tragic and hugely troubling addiction to gambling, which was a horrible blight upon her marriage & life: just ... ignored.

Very pretty dresses, though.  Bleah.",1296864000,77,1754,5.140845070422535

WTF! and the duchess' lover wasn't too appealing. they could've picked a better looking actor to make it a little more believable. but then.... i guess at that point the duchess was desperate enough to get anyone aside from her husband! this movie disgusted me. the only reason i watched it to the end was because of Keira Knightley's performance",1294790400,2,789,4.374149659863946

3681092,4,B001L57ZZG,"""The Duchess"" is based on the true story of Georgiana, wife of the Fifth Duke of Devonshire, a powerful member of the aristocracy in the mid-18th Century. Georgiana's life became a hot topic with the publication of a widely-acclaimed biography and the interesting parallels drawn between her story and that of Diana, Princess of Wales. Both were trapped in loveless marriages, both overshadowed their rather boring husbands, both had to compete with the husbands' well-known mistresses, both were widely reknowned for their influence on fashion, but in the end both brought on their own destruction with foolish behavior. ""The Duchess"" gives us a rather black-and-white view of Georgiana--she's portrayed as a lovely innocent, but was notorious for running up huge gambling debts and problems with drugs and alcohol; this is only hinted at in the film. As for the Duke, despite Ralph Fiennes' attempts to breathe some life into this dour character (see the interview with Fiennes on the DVD), he comes across as a terrible tyrant until the very end. The costumes and sets in this film are gorgeous, and it's very tastefully done. Highly recommended if you like this type of thing (I do!), but it's  more of a ""chick flick"" than real history.",1282953600,2,1241,5.024271844660194

However, please don't assume that watching this flick at all informs you on the life and times of Georgiana Spencer Cavendish. It takes great liberties not only with the timeline of her life -- obscuring the order and timing of such crucial things as her affair with Grey and the birth of her legitimate daughters -- but also with basic character assumptions. Georgiana's son, for instance, was not conceived of some Hollywood-drama domestic rape. He was conceived on holiday in Belgium, and Georgiana and  her husband both wanted him desperately, the former because a son would enable her to finance her extraordinary gambling debts. The movie portrays Georgiana as a one-dimensional woe-is-me I'm-so-pretty society fluff ball. She was anything but. This movie is a disservice to the real Georgiana, but if it had not used her name and had presented itself as fiction, I might have enjoyed it quite a bit.",1274400000,14,1037,4.994219653179191

Real Georgiana was a more complex person than the one portrayed by Keira Knightley, and her life was never defined just by her desire for a happy marriage.

This tepid my-husband-doesn't-love-me-and-doesn't-allow-me-to-have-a-lover version didn't do this notable woman any justice. No depth, no dimensions to the story.

Spirited and adored by the public at large she quickly found her marriage to be a disappointment, defined by her duty to produce a male heir and the Duke's philandering and callous indifference to her. She befriends Lady Bess but finds she is once again betrayed by her husband who wields his power with the three eventually living uncomfortably together. Against this background, and with the pressures of an unfaithful husband,strict social pressures and constant public scrutiny, Georgiana falls passionately in love with Charles Grey, a rising young Whig politician. However, despite his ongoing liaison with Lady Bess, the Duke refuses to allow her to continue the affair and threatens to take her children from her.

3681105,4,B001L57ZZG,"The Duchess showcases great acting in every way; I was particularly impressed with Ralph Fiennes and Kiera Knightley's performances. The plot flows along smoothly with excellent character development although they could have edited it down just a few minutes to make the action even tighter. The choreography and the cinematography work wonders for this motion picture and the script was very well written. In addition, the costumes and sets are magnificent and very detailed.

When the film starts, we meet several principle characters. The Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes) is most interested in marrying Georgiana (Kiera Knightley), the rather young daughter of Lady Spencer (Charlotte Rampling). Lady Spencer is thrilled to marry her daughter off to a prestigious Duke and Georgiana is rather excited at the idea of marrying the Duke.

Unfortunately, however, things don't go well. Georgiana is a passionate freethinker who likes modern day politics, drinking and even gambling on occasion. The Duke, on the other hand, is cold, mean-spirited and rather traditional; he desperately wants a male heir to become the next Duke of Devonshire. Despite their best efforts (not all of which are all that romantic) the Duke and Georgiana can't produce a son. The Duke blames Georgiana for not bearing him a son which only makes things worse. They wind up with three daughters, one of whom was fathered by the Duke before he even met Georgiana; the two sons they did have were both stillborn. The Duke becomes even colder toward Georgiana and he has encounters with many other women; and when Georgiana makes friends with Lady Bess (Hayley Atwell) even more unexpected results occur that shake Georgiana to the core.

Georgiana eventually has her own romantic feelings for the young, politically ambitious Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper). Together they find true love and their mutual passion for politics certainly unites them very romantically.

I could tell you more but then I'd be giving spoilers away and I don't want to do that to you!

The DVD comes with a ""making of"" featurette and there's a bonus entitled ""Georgiana in Her Own Words."" There is a ""costume diary"" as well.

The Duchess paints the portrait of a lady who is far from free despite having a prestigious place in society; and it doesn't disappoint.

The tremendous indifference that Devonshire displayed to him, politics and his wife is a terrific reminder of how powerful the elites were and how much damage they could do to individual lives simply because they didn't have to care. Power grows careless and selfish. This movie was not just about the sufferings of one duped young lady, it is about the indifference that had to be fought and still must be guarded against. A very timely film, I do believe. How many of you are involved in politics? Not many I do expect. Yes, it got a little tedious, but that is how Devonshire made the lives around him, yes? And I thought Keira Knightley did a tremendous job of acting, the scene where her hair catches on fire was very believable and affecting.

THE STORY (mini-spoilers ahead!): A young and stunning lass of nobility is thrilled to become the new bride of the renowned and fabulously rich Duke of Devonshire (thus, she becomes the Duchess); however, she quickly finds the Duke to be rather a cold fish in the romantic aspect of love-making. Still, after talking with her mother about it she holds out hope for improvement of the situation. Then she discovers that the Duke has previously fathered a little girl who comes to live with them. Then she discovers that her best friend has become the Duke's mistress. Then she enters into her own love affair with Charles Grey (future Prime Minister of England)... and so on, and so forth. The subsequent complexity of events does not follow the normal flow as one typically encounters in such films of the historical drama genre. I should also mention that this movie features only brief sexual scenes and is in no way overloaded in that aspect.

This tale is based upon the true story of Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire who lived during the late 18th- and early 19th-Century.

Ms. Knightley was perfect in each one of those films, especially ""Pride & Prejudice."" I'd also seen Ralph Fiennes in
""Schindler's List,"" giving an intense performance as the villainous Amon Goeth. Being as I love period films, even if I'm ignorant of the subject matter, I knew I was in for a treat.

I was not disappointed. Kiera Knightley gives one of her greatest performances in this movie, which enhances her acting range far beyond the tough damsels in the
""Pirates"" films and ""Pride & Prejudice."" Ralph Fiennes was a detestable villain, as in ""Schindler's List,"" and as a result, gave a truly menacing portrayal. I highly recommend this movie.

One final note: I've been seeing a lot of comments on YouTube complaining about the nudity in the movie. Grow up, for Christ's sake. Being a PG-13 movie, the nudity wasn't prolonged or explicit and the sex was implied. Besides, the nudity was important to the storyline a la ""Schindler's List.""

It's interesting how some people look at these costume dramas with some sort of 'nostalgia' (even though they have never lived through the time) - yet, they keep forgetting what society was like at the time. You couldn't really express yourself if you were any 'different' from what they expected you to be. You were forced to be who they wanted you to be. It was the time of arranged marriages. The time of politics over love.
Of course we have our own problems in the modern era, but it's silly to imagine it was any better in, say, XVIII century England.
Ok, coming back to the movie. Great performances all over, amazing photography and music. Good dialogues - that sound very natural and believable, not something produced for the screen, as most period pieces. The dynamics between the characters is interesting.

So she has no power whatsoever over what her husband chooses to do? I kept hoping she'd hit him over the head with a roasted pig or something. Instead, she puts up with his mistress and her one stab at freedom (having an affair) only leads to more sorrow. Defeat followed by yet another defeat, ending with resignation to what her husband wants. Yes, it's all true, but the real Georgiana had an adoring public and was admired by many. There are hints of her spirit here, but in the movie it's more about how Georgiana was a victim forever. It's hard to like a movie when it's all about victimhood. You kept wanting Ralph Fiennes to get his comeuppance, but it never does. Instead, we're asked to feel a little sorry for him, even though everything in the movie is done according to his terms (eventually even his wife's love affair).

3681124,3,B001L57ZZG,"I have to say in advance I haven't read the book the movie is mostly based on, so I watched it with only the little knowledge I already possessed of the Duchess of Devonshire from my history lessons.

I was totally surprised how much I was moved by Keira Knightley's superb acting in this role: she shows very convincingly the change in her character from a spirited and a bit naive girl to an impressingly urbane woman and devoted mother, who wearily accepts her husband's shortcomings as well as her own (not being able to bear a male heir for many years). The result is an indifferent marriage arrangement before she begins to try to seek some happiness for herself and fails.

Ralph Fiennes gives us a fine perfomance of a man, who recognizes the (i.a. intellectual) differences between himself and his young wife from the beginning. Yet he seems to be unwilling or even helpless to do cross the void between them, even though he appears to be fond of his wife in some ambiguous way - until it is too late and Lady Foster and violence stand between them.

Mainly the movie is carried by the development of the main character in her relationsship with her husband and Lady Foster, as well as Georgianas short experience with her lover, Charles Grey.

The emotional upheavals and the loneliness of Georgiana is masterfully shown, but that's it. The wondeful supporting cast was sadly cut short to a few lines and scenes and therefore almost seems neglectable, despite the characters importance for the story arch.

The movie is a candy for the eyes and ears, but barely goes into the depth of the Duchess' intellectual and political interests. Her accomplishments as well as her less noble exploits (affairs, drugs and alcohol) are mostly left out, despite Ms. Knightleys potential as an actress - she's reduced to a dressed-up, elegantly pale, unsatisfied woman, who is finally forced to seek refuge in the love for her children.

The movie-makers promise more than they actually give the audience - would they just've focused on the unhappy relationsship between the main characters it would be much more satisfying.",1246060800,6,2120,4.8264462809917354

This time around the plot is not a Jane Austinish tale of romance and veiled aggression over the teacups, but a study of a personality - or rather several personalities, specifically the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, which sound a bit like a couple created for the express purpose of enlivening a Regency Romance, with a marriage so open that one could practically drive a coach and four through it, without risking harm to either party. She was Georgiana Spencer (Kiera Knightly in yet another corset), the golden girl of late 18th century British politics; beautiful, accomplished, well-born, adored by practically everyone who knew her, except her husband. The Duke was one of those grim, cold and emotionally-distant figures, devoted to duty, his social position and his dogs, in more or less that order - and yet as played by Ralph Fiennes, not entirely unsympathetic. The two of them eventually had a functioning marriage, as the 18th century aristocracy defined it - with the additional fillip that the Duke's long-time mistress was her best friend, and the three of them lived companionably together for decades. This only goes to show that actual, documented historical reality is several times more improbable, dramatic and interesting than anything the most creative dramatist could make up.",1243900800,4,1572,5.342741935483871
3681126,4,B001L57ZZG,"It's obvious that the makers of ""The Duchess"" were attempting to draw a parallel between the more recent foibles in the marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana.  Usually, I don't like these period pieces where usually the ornate settings and lavish costumes overwhelm the story.  This one intrigued me in a Tennessee Williams or John O'Hara kind of way.  Yes, the film is a potboiler but not one to easily dismiss.  The film teeters at time towards parody but ultimately it grounds itself in reality.  It helps that the leads are two superb actors.  Keira Knightley projects a stiff upper lip as the Duchess of Devonshire, a woman forced to suffer indignity because of the strict mores of the time.  Ralph Fiennes as the Duke of Devonshire adds weight to a role that could very well be caricature.  He imbues some modicum of sympathy to a man that is an absolute cad.  This isn't a great film but it's certainly an interesting one.",1243209600,10,937,4.664634146341464
3681127,3,B001L57ZZG,"I am a big fan of virtually everyone involved in the making of ""The Duchess.""  Certainly the actors, led by Keira Knightley and Ralph Feinnes, are top-notch.  The look of the picture is beyond sumptuous, and who couldn't be intrigued by the tale of a real-life 18th-century populist-noble who introduces her cheating spouse as ""our husband"" when walking with her hubbie and his mistress?

Unfortunately, there's plenty wrong with this picture.  Ultimately, it seems as if the filmmakers stopped after creating visual splendor - this movie has all the heart and subtlety of ""Under the Tuscan Sun,"" that classic movie that wasn't content with showing a movie-perfect kiss on the Italian seaside, but had to introduce a cute-as-a-button kitten into the mix in case you weren't already feeling good enough.

Here, much of the problem can actually be laid at casting with Keira Knightley.  It's not that she does a bad job, but she's just wrong for the part.  At the beginning of the movie, she's cast perfectly.  Her character, Georgiana, is a nubile 16 and ready to be married off to the Duke of Devonshire (Feinnes), perhaps the wealthiest man in England.  That's all well and good, and Knightley is perfectly vivacious and beautiful.

But the story is about Georgiana's struggles with life as her husband proves to be a first-rate prat and boor, more interested in his dogs as companions than his wife - whose sole purpose is to give him a son.  But after Georgiana has multiple babies (both living and stillborn), she.  Still. Looks. Like.  Keira.  Knightley.  She does not age.  She does not gain a pound.  Knightley's collarbones are as pronounced by the end of the movie as they are at the beginning, and that's just not what happens when you've had six or seven kids.

All this reminded me of the scene in ""Notting Hill"" where Hugh Grant tracks down Julia Roberts on a film set and sees her dressed in period-costume.  All the time I watched ""The Duchess,"" I was aware of the fact that I was watching a production.  This was not a movie I could disappear into and watch characters - I was watching people act.  Not the same thing, and not good.  As a result, I never became emotionally invested in this one-note flick.

I'm sure Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, is the subject of many great books. I'd like to read one someday.  But I have a hard time recommending this film other than for students of set and costume design.",1243036800,4,2430,4.7173396674584325

3681129,3,B001L57ZZG,"This 18th century costume drama actually stays fairly close to the historical record -- with some changes and adaptations. It tells the story of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, who falls into a loveless marriage with an older aristocrat who only wants her to produce a male heir. They get into a weird menage with her best friend who becomes the Duke's mistress. Meanwhile, Georgiana is pining for the embraces of Mr. Grey, an aspiring Whig politician.
With gorgeous gowns and wonderful hairdos as well as terrific locations in great English homes like Chatsworth, this movie makes for pleasant viewing without ever engaging the emotions. I did some research which showed it stayed fairly close to the historical record. It did suggest that Georgiana and Charles Grey met and fell in love when she was 17. But he was six years younger than her so that could not have been the case. (This was the Earl Grey after whom the tea is named. As prime minister, he passed the 1832 Reform Act, cutting out some of the worst abuses of the electoral system and setting Britain on its long path to democracy).
The movie does cover Georgiana's significant political role. She is also said to have inspired Sheridan's ""School for Scandal."" She was an interesting and significant historical figure.
 The movie alludes to but glosses over Georgiana's gambling addiction. She died 20,000 pounds in debt which in today's money is a staggering amount of almost Madoff-like proportions.
However these are minor cavils. One does not expect a movie to be a historical documentary. My main problem with this film is that I did not for a moment believe I was watching real 18th century characters. I felt more that I was seeing 21st century characters dressed up in 18th century costumes. They did not think or feel like people of their own time, which was considerably different from our own, but appealed to our 21st sensibilities.
That particularly applies to the winsome (not to say anorexic) Kiera Knightly who moves languidly through the movie like a fashion model. The problem I find with this actress is that I rarely feel any real appetite for life in her -- for the good or the bad. Everything happens at a remove. Her way of portraying tragedy relies more on makeup than acting and she has an annoying way of sucking in her cheeks to indicate emotion.

It was one of those movies Amazon had suggested when I purchased a copy of the Vivian Leigh movie about Lady Hamilton. So I bought, The Duchess"" with no prior knowledge of its quality or story.

Since this is a historical movie about a true story, I really don't think the term ""Spoilers"" applies. But if you don't want to know anything about movie details in advance, you probably shouldn't be reading our comments... especially mine. So, stop here if you don't want to hear details of the movie.

My first impression of the actress playing Georgiana in the very first scene was that she was pale and sickly looking. But she surprised me by giving a resounding, strong, believable performance of the real Duchess; presenting her as described in historical documents (which I read after watching the movie).

I also later learned that her fashions, hairstyles, personality and details of her life very closely followed the actual Georgiana. The movie's attention to detail and realism by shooting in the actual palaces and ornate surroundings of the real Georgiana were stunningly accurate. Much better than they could have done in a studio or CGI. My complements to the producers and directors for their choosing real locations and following historical documents and paintings to duplicate the real life and surroundings of Georgiana.

The movie failed to inform the viewers that Georgiana was a Spencer... a direct ancestor of Princess Di or that Georgiana was also a direct ancestor to Princess Fergie by means of a child Georgiana had with her lover. So, I had no idea of the significance of this Duchess when I watched the movie... yet I could not help but see both Fergie and Diana in Georgiana before I knew there was any connection.

Without that foreknowledge, I had noticed that Georgiana (as portrayed) had a vivacious party girl personality when she entertained very much like Fergie. Yet she lived a tragic, loveless married life just like Princess Di and was beloved by everyone... except her husband. Her only job was to provide an heir for the Duke.

Georgiana's marriage was tragic and loveless. Her husband blatantly lived with his mistress in their home for over a decade and later married that mistress after Georgiana died. Sound familiar... Camilla?

The only love Georgiana had ever known was denied her by threats of losing her children and threats against her lover. So the one baby girl she had with her lover, she had to give up to her lover's family shortly after her birth and returned to her loveless marriage to the Duke. Her lover later became Prime Minister.

It was ok for the Duke to have his mistress right in the same house... but Georgiana was not permitted the same option.

My only criticism is that the movie producers and director should have let the audience know the significance of Georgiana's ancestral bloodlines shared with Princess Di and Fergie and that Georgiana was a Spencer... even if it was only mentioned by a text insert at the end of the movie. It should have been mentioned somewhere, especially for those of us who are not from the UK and don't know the minute details of Royal bloodlines. I had never heard of Georgiana prior to watching this film. If I had not looked it up on Wikipedia, I would not have known how Georgiana was related to Di and Fergie and how their tragic fates were all intertwined. There was no mention of this on the movie. After I read about her, it really brought more significance to Georgiana's tragic life as depicted in this movie.

The similarities between Georgiana and her descendents, Princess Di and Fergie are quite disturbing. Almost a mirror of things to come. It was sad to learn that their shared ancestor, Georgiana had suffered a similar fate. A tragic story to be sure, but well worth the time to watch. If this movie didn't win any academy awards... it should have. An unforgivable oversight by the Academy.

Ralph Feines was quite surprising in his portrayal of the Duke. Quite believable. I have a feeling his portrayal of the Duke was a bit softer than the real Duke. I was surprised to see him in a historical role like this after Voldemort and the Red Dragon... but he did an excellent job.

My only other comment is that the print on the screen was much too small to see on any TV. It was so tiny, I had to get out of my chair and get within 4 ft of the TV to read it. (and I have a large screen). Filmmakers need to keep in mind that home audiences need to be able to read a properly sized font on their TV screen when the film includes text details for the audience. They should make allowances for this issue prior to releasing the DVD version.

For those reviewers who have made derogatory comments on the costumes and hairdo's... they obviously have not taken the time to read about the life of Georgiana or looked at the portraits and biographies of her... or even bothered to watch the extra's included with the DVD. If they had bothered, they would have seen that this movie recreated the real Georgiana's hairstyles and unusual fashions to the tiniest detail. It may seem bizarre to us, but Georgiana was famous for her hair and clothes, which were a constant source of interest by the media and public throughout her life. Very similar to the same attention that Princess Diana attracted by her life and fashions. If this movie had not portrayed Georgiana's hair and clothing fashions as she had actually worn them, it would have been as bad as a 23rd century producer portraying Princess Di wearing dime store fashions. Accuracy is very important in historical films about real people. To depict them differently than they really were just to suit those with limited historical knowledge, would have been of the utmost disrespect.

So don't listen to people with no appreciation for historical detail. With those attitudes, I don't know why they would even bother to watch a high caliber historical movie like this.

To fully appreciate the accuracy of this film, I recommend reading up about the Duchess of Devonshire on Wikipedia and taking a look at some of the paintings of Georgiana.",1240358400,6,6266,4.720036596523331

If she only knew! Her marriage is a marriage based not on love, but convenience...she is from the right family, has the right looks and fits the ""job"" title requirements, nothing is said of love.

Yet it appears that there is one area in which Georgiana is lacking the requirements of a good wife, the Duke requires a son by which he will be able to pass down his title, and the first 2 children of the Duke and Duchess are girls. We have heard it all before - from Kings to Dukes they all feel the drive to produce a male heir and have no idea that the problem lies not with their wives but with themselves. Georgiana is caught in that same old story. When she finally does produce a male heir for the Duke things do not get better, but worst. As Georgiana finds herself still alone and betrayed by those closest to her.

When Georgiana finally does find true love in the arms of the young politician Earl Grey, she is not allowed possess it. Instead she is threatened with the one thing she holds dearest to her heart - her children.

The only reality here is the answer for the question, what was Kiera Knightley thinking in taking this role?

This plodding flick is plotless.  A young English beauty marries an older self-absorbed duke resulting is the usual, for 21st century Hollywood, unhappy life.  So what?  The human experience has long proved that aristocracy offers only anguish and pain for the non-aristocratic.  Where's the point here?

The cold duke only wants a son from his marriage, Knightley's duchess wants a fidelous and warm marriage.  The duke gets his wish, the duchess doesn't.  One is moved to sorrow for her, and for the screenplay's lost potential.

The scenery, costuming, and acting in this movie save it from complete doom.  Knightley and Fiennes give convincing performances.

3681137,4,B001L57ZZG,"""The duchess"" is far to be a single commercial proposal. It's a very mature and touching movie that reveals the well known double moral sense, the ethical deficit and the state of things in a Pre Victorian period that was convulsing just at the eve of the American Independence (1774).

A very young girl (Georgiana) becomes Duchess, a dream come true for many potential female candidates. Her alluring beauty captivates this Duke, featured by a very weird behavior. He is not precisely a friendly company, a very discrete man, isolated from the madding crowds who ignores the basic principles of courtesy and good manners.

She will soon realize this man hides much more than he really exposes. But when she becomes pregnant, will know he had a daughter named Charlotte (9) with a maid who passed away days ago.

This awful truth will intersect with another fatidic and random event, when Georgiana casually meets a very disappointed wife (Elizabeth), who has been betrayed by her husband, and realizing her sad condition she proposes to live with them while the things resolve by themselves. That fatal decision will become the Pandora box the Duchess and will lead her to the very hellish entrails.

The dramatic events and successive facts will plainly absorb the audience from start to finish. Thanks to a very successful script and astonishing edition process the tragedy will never stop because the multiple moral and affective obstacles she will have to surmount in order to survive and bear this enormous burden of insolence, cynicism and dishonor in her very home.

Keira Knightley and Ralph Fieness make a tour de force acting. She epitomizes the brutal suffering without falling into hyper indulgence.

Perhaps the only flaw has been the discrete photography. One cannot avoid to let oneself remind for instance, the impressive photography of another related film as ""Barry Lyndon"", for instance, but that would lead us to another territory.",1238803200,2,1953,5.068535825545172
3681138,5,B001L57ZZG,"The year is 1774, and 17-year old Georgiana hopes her marriage to the much older Duke of Devonshire will be a love match.  Sadly, he's cold and distant and has a series of paramours, one of whom moves right into the family home with them.

Keira Knightly is perfect as the doomed Duchess; she gives a sensitive performance as Georgiana grows from spunky girl to political hostess to submissive wife. Ralph Fiennes plays the odious Duke masterfully.  Based on a true story, the movie highlights many events in Georgiana's that would later be repeated by her descendant, Princess Diana; Georgiana's husband was uninterested in her, cared only for an heir, and carried on an affair that lasted for 25 years.  Also like Diana, Georgiana was the most important fashionista of her day, loved by the people, and the darling of the London gossip columnists.

The exquisite costumes won an Academy Award and the grand English homes (including Chatsworth House where Georgiana lived with the Duke) are breathtaking.  The atmospheric photography features golden candlelight and natural sunlight.  This is everything a period drama should be - a riveting true story that's lovely to look at with flawless acting.

I would suggest parents to let their children know how lucky they are to be able to choose the man you would like to marry, not what was good for the family. Marriages were arranged and most marriages were only considered biblical room mates.  Men have always had their mistress' to turn to when his wife in unavailable (pregnant) and if they have been kicked out of their wives bed and considered to be in the dog house. The movie really portrayed how little control women had over their future. Now about the movie.. it is true history about this duchess and her life.

This story actually had a lot of similarities to ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" just with a Duke and Duchess instead of a King and Queen....those darn men are always demanding an heir! Obviously though, that was something important in that time period.

So, while I don't usually like period, historical movies, this one held my attention from beginning to end. One of the first times in awhile that when it was over, I was a bit sad and wanted to see more of their story. I did appreciate them telling you vaguly how their lives continued, but would have been more then happy to keep watching.

Keira Knightley really surprised me, I don't usually love her, but I thought she did this role very believably. She was vivacious, passionate and tortured. Everything you need for a good duchess. The costumes and scenery were awesome. Ralph Fiennes is always amazing, in my opinion. Definitely worth a watch.

This film's plot can be summed up in a sentence: The Duchess of Devonshire had a horrible marriage and subsequently a sad and unfulfilled life. Read the biography the film was based on for more interesting details, because they couldn't be bothered with them in this movie. It seems that the director was more interested in lush visuals than characterization, dialogue, plot, or meaning. If it's lush visuals you want, however, you might like the beautiul settings and amazing costumes and wigs. I was disappointed because, while I highly recommend the book the film was based on, the movie felt so slight. I found Knightley's performance wooden, but I tend to find her face rather unexpressive most of the time. I kind of liked Dominic Cooper, but I may be prejudiced in favor of him because he really looks good in this movie. So my advice would be to avoid the movie unless you just want something nice to look at and go buy the book, which is a terribly impressive biography.",1235433600,6,1099,4.670103092783505
3681148,3,B001L57ZZG,"Visually exquisite, The Duchess is a very tastefully done period piece, and by that I mean nothing in the way of gratuitous nudity or violence, such a rarity in films today that I think it deserves high praise on this score alone.

Ralph Fiennes turns in his usual skillful performance, revealing depth and layers to the generally unlikeable character of the Duke of Devonshire. A less capable actor might have played this as a flat, one-dimensional personality. Kiera Knightly is generally pretty good as the Duchesss, but it seemed like she didn't quite have a strong enough presence to make this film as compelling as I thought it could have been. A part of that may be that her looks are very striking-21st century-supermodelish and I found this to be a distraction, and that made it hard for me to stay in the time period.

Despite the fairly good pacing, something in the story line is lacking. There is no real ""punch"" here..leaving the unfolding of events a little colorless and flat. One of the biggest criticisms I have is in the development of the relationship between the Duchess and Charles Grey - this could've been built up better; also, these two actors seemed to have zero chemistry together.

The costumes, settings and scenery are enchanting enough that I would have been content to watch this even if it had no plot. Yes, there are certainly better period films out there, but if you like the genre as I do, I think you'll enjoy this one.",1235347200,17,1458,4.6875

We find Keira's character much like Kirsten Dunst in Marie Antoinette. She is married off and becomes a duchess. She is considered the princess Di of her time, she has timeless elegance and fashion and everyone wants to be her. It sounds like a dream come true right? When her first child turns out to be a girl, she tries again. Her husband begins to get frustrated assuming that he had chosen a healthy wife and why she couldn't bear him a male heir was just beyond words. Lets just assume that he doesnt realize it is indeed his fault he cannot produce a male heir, but men of this time hadnt realized the chromosome game yet. He does what any male would do in this situation, begins to have an affair. When she falls in love with someone else and tries to do the same, he threatens to take her children away and dethrone her in a way that would be humiliating. Think Demi Moore in the scarlett letter.

The moment that the Duke stepped out of any active duty with the Whig party, I thought that the intelligent and witty ""G"" would step in....instead there was a great deal of emphasis on the love traingle/rectangle. What I liked about the movie was the emphasis on the difficulty for women to move about in the social circle as they pleased, and their lack of understanding about what marriage actually meant sometimes......aren't things still like that today sometimes?

Fascination is a notoriously difficult thing to reproduce on the screen, and though Kiera Knightley who here plays Georgiana is undoubtedly beautiful she's not someone who projects tremendous charisma or wit very naturally. The movie wants us to feel sorry for Georgiana because her husband (Ralph Fiennes) kept demanding she produce him a male heir (which she eventually did) and because he cheated on her with her best friend in some sort of sophisticated arrangement that allows her to couple more or less openly with Lord Grey (Dominic Cooper); it's hard to feel sorry for her since she's dripping in diamonds and gigantic wigs (each more spectacular than the next) and because the Duke keeps her in splendid palace after splendid palace. No one distinguishes herself or himself very much in this somewhat moribund period piece, and Ralph Fiennes doesn't have much to do as the dull Duke. Dominic Cooper, said himself to be quite a fascinator on the stage, yet again shows himself unable to generate much spark on the screen.

Excellent performances from newcomers Dominic Cooper & Hayley Atwill, and it's always good to see the very under-rated Charlotte Rampling, though her role is small. I only rented it because of it's Oscar recognition (Costumes & Sets). The DVD extras are instructive. The filmmakers insist that everything is authentic as can be, though there seems to be a debate about that. I enjoyed it.

3681157,5,B001L57ZZG,"The Duchess is a visually beautiful but very dark film. The story takes place from 1774 to the mid-1780s in England. The lush, stylish costumes and  rich, elegant interiors were beautifully photographed and reinforced the message that there is often far more than meets the eye, for Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, lead a sad and confined life even though she was married to one of England's most wealthy men.  Keira Knightly is excellent as this naive 17 year old girl who is married to an emotionally distant, cold, privileged man. Ralph Fiennes plays the part of William Cavendish, the 5th Duke of Devonshire, in a performance that is frightening in its chilly control. The Duke is disinterested in his young wife except as one who will bear him an heir. He cheats on her to meet his sexual needs and is totally inadequate to meet her emotional needs.

Charlotte Rampling plays Georgiana's mother, an ambitious woman who arranges the marriage of her daughter to the Duke and continually advises Georgiana to be patient and understanding even when the Duke has affairs with housemaids and brings an illegitimate daughter, Charlotte, into the home for Georgiana to rear. Georgiana has two daughters and several miscarriages, so by the time she and the Duke have been married for 7 years, she is seeking a more affection and emotional response whereas he has grown ever more cruel since his expectations for a son have been thwarted. Georgiana befriends Lady Bes Foster and moves Bess into her home only to find that Bess becomes the Duke's new mistress. Bess uses the power of the Duke to obtain her children from her estranged husband. Bess is manipulative and realistic but not without compassion and often comes to Georgiana's aid as the dark story unfolds. Georgiana eventually does have a son and is given a handsome sum of money for her own discretion. The pressure on Georgiana is now decreased for she has met the Duke's expectations.

Georgiana eventually has an affair with Charles Grey, played well by Dominic Cooper. This young politician impregnates Georgiana and we get to see how gender differences impact the lives of women. Whereas the Duke was able to bring his illegitimate child into the home, Georgiana was forced to turn her illegitimate child, Eliza, to the family of her former lover.

Eventually Georgiana is able to develop the distant, cool, soul blunting and spirit numbing sense of defeat that allows her to accept gross injustice and become a realist about the powers that society gives men and the powers that are denied women. The film will leave you feeling sad for the confines that we place upon ourselves and others.",1234396800,,2655,4.904231625835189

Some of the women had the strength to overcome, or at least make the best of, their circumstances.  Others brought themselves to other places of distress.

Keira Knightley is always lovely and strong in her portrayals; Dominic Cooper is touching--a far cry from the nonentity he played in Mama Mia (which of course was all that role called for.)  Ralph Fiennes has so many faces that he never disappoints.  He was a marvelous cad in this film.",1234137600,,765,4.793893129770993
3681159,5,B001L57ZZG,"For those who enjoy epic period films with gorgeous costumes, original and beautiful set designs, and excellent acting to boot, then ""The Duchess"" is a movie you should not miss.

Set in England during the French and American Revolutions and the English Enlightenment, these events provide a formative backdrop to the movie's primary plot. Based on Amanda Foreman's award winning biography, ""Georgiana: Duchess of Devonshire,"" the film documents the tragic story of the beautiful, intelligent, strong-willed aristocrat who formed a popular ""salon,"" which included the brightest literary & political figures of her day. She was also an active political campaigner for the Whig Party at a time when women's suffrage was well over a century away. Born Georgiana Spencer, the Duchess was an ancestor of the late Princess Diana, who was born Diana Spencer. Althorpe was the ancestral home of both women.

At age sixteen, Georgiana married the much older William Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire, in 1774. Awed by her new husband, the romantic teen bride had high hopes that her arranged marriage would succeed...or at least provide an amiable relationship. Unfortunately, she couldn't have been more wrong. The aloof, emotionally cold, coarse Duke was a notorious womanizer who wanted a male heir from his Duchess and nothing else. Cavendish did love his dogs, however. Bah!! He became more and more aloof and abusive to his young wife as she provided him with daughter after daughter and two stillborn sons. She even took in his illegitimate daughter and raised her as her own to gain his favor and some kindness, to no avail.

Her best and only real friend, Bess, Lady Elizabeth Foster, (Hayley Atwell), betrays her, and Georgiana's home life becomes more and more like a prison with herself the only inmate. She does find love outside her marriage, but this forbidden relationship is soon nipped in the bud as the Duke threatens his wife with dire consequences if she continues the affair.

Filled with illicit romance, betrayal, real historical events and characters, along with impeccable acting from Keira Knightly as Georgiana, Ralph Fiennes in an extremely strong & complex performance as Devonshire, and Charlotte Rampling as Georgiana's mother, I found this film to be highly entertaining and educational. I also love English history which added to my enjoyment.

Beautiful costumes, great hair, Ralph Fiennes does an honourable job with the pile of cow manure he's given for lines, and Kiera K looks lovely as always if we are all getting a bit bored of her posing and  posturing -(I think she figured out a long time ago that she doesn't actually need to develop any depth as an actor to have a great career- just a little more tweaking of nose and protuding of upper lip)..but the costumes are absolutely lovely ,

3681163,4,B001L57ZZG,"A few years ago, as in pre-`Pride and Prejudice', everyone wrote off Keira Knightley as a mildly talented pretty face; a young actress taking a backseat to bigger names in big-budget mainstream action films who happened to keep work thanks to her impressive bone structure.  If you were to ever entertain the idea of this young woman becoming a major actress with an Oscar nomination and more to come for that matter you would be deemed crazy.

Keira is not the type of actress to get awards attention; is she?

Then 2005 happened and she did a little movie called `Pride and Prejudice' and received massive amounts of Oscar buzz, and thanks to a seemingly weak year in the lead actress category Miss Knightley was able to land herself a nomination; a well deserved one at that (I love me some Witherspoon, but in retrospect Knightley should have won the Oscar).  That shining moment had a lot of people scratching their heads.

Was this vibrant star really the bland yet pretty Barbie-Doll they saw two years back in that Pirate Blockbuster?

Two years later they got another chance to revel in her talent when she starred in Joe Wright's (her `Pride and Prejudice' director) second film; `Atonement'.  She proved yet again that she has acting chops, this time missing out on Oscar but grabbing a slew of other nominations, including a BAFTA nod.  This caused many to claim she needed a certain hand in guiding her to greatness.  She was accused of only performing well for Wright, since she was still turning out mainstream fare that was less than impressive.

Could she act without help?

I think finally `The Duchess' gives us the answer.  This time she worked with another director and yet still turned out a fresh and inviting and beautifully crafted performance.  She is lavish when she needs to be, conflicted when she needs to be, charming when she needs to be and utterly devastated when she needs to be.  She is utter perfection.

I guess now the question is; can she act outside of a `period drama'?

I kid, really, because I am not judgmental of her talent, for I see she has it.  I know that some have raised that issue with regards to her acting ability, but quite frankly who cares.  If this girl starred in EVERY period movie made I'd be happy, since she does them so well.  Look at Emma Thompson; a wonderful actress who excels when she straps on the corset.  Same can be said for Knightley.

The film tells of Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire.  Married off to the Duke and sacrificed into a life she did not want, this tells us a very sad yet realistic tale of despair and compromise.  Georgiana wants to love her husband but his interest in her is minimal at best; for all he desires of her is a son.  Sadly, she provides him with three girls.  This moves the Duke to pursue other lovers, even if it means hurting his wife.  Georgiana has her own exploits, which involve young Charles Grey, a boy she's loved and continues to love, but her relationship with him compromises her life in more ways than one.

`The Duchess' is actually quite good, enjoyable and entertaining.  I was expecting something rather bland and boring, but that didn't happen.  I was intrigued and emotionally connected, so that I felt her devastation, her frustration and even her warmth.  The one problem I have with this film is that it fails to really flesh out the woman that was Georgiana.  We see that she was well liked by all but her husband, but why?  Sure, Knightley is ravishing and delightful, but we never get more than surface treatment from the script, which is more occupied with her living arrangements and love life than with what made her who she was.  The film, while entertaining and very watchable, feels one-note, and it had the opportunity to be more than that.

The acting is superb and keeps us very much interested in the story.  Knightley is not the only gem here.  Ralph Fiennes has possibly had his best year ever, with three very strong supporting performances (see also `The Reader' and `In Bruges') and this performance is no exception.  Hayley Atwell is also wonderful here, very sincere and moving.  Dominic Cooper is pure eye candy (although some find him rather unattractive), but he also has moments of purity in his performance.

This is the Knightley show though, just so we are clear.

I personally recommend this movie.  It may not be as insightful as it could have been, but as far as these period dramas go it covers all the bases.  The acting is fresh, the dialog is intriguing, the sets are lavish, the costumes are gorgeous, the landscapes are breathtaking and the story is clear and touching.",1233532800,,4637,4.646191646191646

How does a composer convey the feelings of beauty and opulence at the top level, the deep sadness of rejection and powerlessness, and then the very subtle sense of growth through experience to develop an inner strength that rolls on like a freight train sound?  I found the layering a most impressive combination that stayed within me for many days.

Many of the supporting cast, as well as Ralph Fiennes, render performances that, while not Oscar-worthy, are at least interesting. With that, I run out of positive things to say. While the ""message"" of the film was well-understood, it was delivered in such a ham-handed way that left little artistry to the script. The leading lady, who in other films has been pleasing to watch, delivered a performance that was unimpressive. The portrayal of the Duchess in question, while packed full of very loud speaking, lots of open-mouthed breathing, furrowed brows, and other hackneyed displays of emotion, lacked much depth. Some may find the story rousing, but pay close attention to why- it seemed to me that sympathy was garnered by the situations which arose, but not by the emotional attachment to the character, a fault to be laid at the doors of both Knightly and the script writers. For those who enjoyed it, I cannot agree, but I will say that the visuals would have been worth the price of rental.",1233446400,20,1139,4.816326530612245
3681166,4,B001L57ZZG,"Keira Knightley plays Georgiana Spencer, Duchess of Devonshire, in THE DUCHESS, a handsome costume drama about the woman who, in the late 1700s, was a major celebrity known as England's ""Empress of Fashion"".

The film, directed by Saul Dibb, was adapted from a book by Amanda Foreman and was shot at many actual locations where the real characters once lived.

Married at a very young age to the Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes), a cold man who only wants a male heir from her, Georgiana is not only forced to put up with her husband's cruelty, but to also share her home with his illegitimate daughter, and later his new mistress.

Ultimately, the unhappy woman begins an ill-advised affair with future Prime Minister Charles Gray (Dominic Cooper), but must soon choose between him and losing her children.

Charlotte Rampling and Hayley Atwell co-star in this fine film about a vivacious and, ultimately, heroic woman who was a victim of her time.

The DVD from Paramount Home Entertainment contains some excellent ""Behind the Scenes"" feaurettes, including one that gives us insight into the real Georgiana through her own letters.

3681168,3,B001L57ZZG,"In ""The Duchess"" (2008), dir by Saul Dibb, Keira Knightley plays Georgiana  Spencer, the Duchess of Devonshire (""Empress of Fashion""), a real historical figure.  She married the Duke of Devonshire, a marriage of convenience that proves disastrous. The Duke of Devonshire is played by Ralph Fiennes, who has not had a really decent role after ""The English Patient,"" eons ago. The Duke expects a son, to inherit him, and she produces three daughters in succession; he takes a lover, Haley Atwell, who is has three sons and is separated from her husband. The Duke cruel and relentless, torments his wife with his autocratic manners and constant infidelities. When she produces a son, after he practically rapes her, he relents and lets her re-enter society.  She takes a lover too, Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper), with whom she has a daughter. The film does not show her death, which must have occurred at an early age, but we are told the Duke marries Atwell, who becomes the new duchess.

Keira Knightley, beautiful but still a budding actress whose girlish giggles prevent the viewer from taking her seriously, slowly matures into her role and eventually becomes believable. She plays mostly in period pieces--she probably is too beautiful to play an ordinary housewife, or any other character, as Kate Winslet and Cate Blanchett have done. Knightley is still a phantom from the past. But her contemporary mannerisms prevent her from rising to the level of seriousness such roles demand. As for Fiennes, he is almost as unlikable as the horrible Goeth of ""Schindler's List."" He scowls too much, and his make-up doesn't help any. Tragic--to some degree--he is also too much of a caddish monster to be forgiven for what he does to a knowingly compliant woman. ""The Duchess"" is a lavish and slow moving production; in more expert hands, it could be a reasonably moving epic. Its problem is the lack of dramatic turns. It has no moments of true crisis--just glides into the recreated opulence of London and Bath of two centuries ago, when humankind (at least in Europe) was reshaping itself. Jane Austen ignores the outside world, but has real dramas in her stories. Here we HAVE the outside world, but just find ourselves on its borders. Nothing that really moves us happens. Better luck next time, Keira. You have the looks. Now, rev up the talent. And get some better writers for your stories. Maybe, go back to a Jane Austen story.",1233273600,2,2430,4.890776699029126

Women are to be seen and not heard, submissive, and capable of popping out male heirs like they're living in puppy mills, or related to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Duggars/dp/141658563X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Duggars</a>.  Georgiana Spenser Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire (Keira Knightley), is in such a situation.

Her husband, Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes), is a powerful, emotionless, and influential man who plucked Georgiana from her parents when she was not yet eighteen.  The idea was for her to shut her mouth, look gorgeous (which she does the entire movie), spit out a litter of sons, and casually dismiss the Duke's obvious troubles with nymphomania and fidelity.  During this time Georgiana learns to deal with her situation, becoming the talk of the town, friend to all, and epicenter of aristocratic, social gatherings.  One of the lines in the movie is that the Duke is the only man in England who is not in love with the Duchess.  When ""she"" fails to produce sons, the Duke loves her less, and takes his scandalous acts a step further; he nails Georgiana's best friend who's living at the Devonshire castle, and then refuses his Duchess' request to evict the third party of the carnally awkward m&eacute;nage a trois.  Marriage Twister!  Red Hand, Blue.  Lies, babies, rape, secret trysts, and perpetual infidelity ensue in this biographical tale.

The costumes, set designs, locales, and everything involved with the presentation of the movie are spectacular.  No expense was spared, and that time machine feeling of being able to truly experience another era is palpable.  It should come as no surprise that a costume drama would have stunning costumes.  Knightley has said that being dressed for the part and wearing the massive wigs literally caused her neck pains.

Aside from the aforementioned, the best I can say is that the Duchess is ostentatious in a positive way.  There aren't more than one or two truly captivating moments; it's just a competent and efficient performance by all involved.  It's not in the upper echelon of British period pieces, and plays out just as a reading of Wuthering Heights would - good, but not flooring.  If the movie took one or two risks similar to those of its heroine, this would have been considerably better.  I highly recommend this for Keira Knightley fans.",1233100800,,2554,5.261728395061728
3681171,4,B001L57ZZG,"I finally got an opportunity to watch The Duchess
last week, and I liked it much more than I expected to. I guess I had read too many negative comments about it that lowered my expectations. But, I thought it was really pretty good--not a feel-good movie, or even an atta-girl movie--and it certainly didn't portray a complete picture of the Georgiana from Amanda Foreman's bio, Georgiana: Duchess of Devonshire, but that would take a 6-part mini-series and not a 2-hour film.

I think Keira Knightley did a good job of convincing me that she was Duchess material (naive, flirtatious, intelligent, ambitious, pragmatic, maternal, resigned), and I felt so sorry for her and so glad that, much as I love history, I am alive in the 21st century and not the 18th. Ralph Fiennes played the Duke perfectly--just the way I imagined him when reading the book a year or so ago. The script and Hayley Atwell were much kinder to Bess Foster than I would have preferred, but you can't have everything, I suppose. Charlotte Rampling was fantastic as Gee's mother--cold, ambitious, I shudder just thinking of her. I wish Fox had been more in the movie, but I liked the brief glimpses we had of him.

The double-standard comes into play in that I am much more forgiving when a filmmaker takes liberties with history to tell a compelling story than I am when a filmmaker takes liberties with certain literary texts (e.g., Austens!) and rewrites them to tell a completing different story. I know I should be outraged when historical facts are fudged in the name of storytelling, but I'm finding that I'm okay with it...to some degree. As long as the facts aren't twisted so badly that the lessons that history can teach us are corrupted. I don't think that happened with The Duchess--Georgiana may have been to the manor born, but it wasn't an easy life, and that comes through in spades.",1233100800,,1871,4.718654434250764
3681172,5,B001L57ZZG,"The movie starts by claiming to be based on a true story.  My history sucks so I'm not sure if it is or it isn't, but it's still an excellent film.  Reviewer Terrance Allen called it a ""Costume Drama"", and his words are to the point and true.  'The Duchess' is a visual and audio array pleasing to the senses.

The year is 1774.  Georgiana (Keira Knightly - King Arthur, Pirates Of The Caribbean) is to marry William, the Duke Of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes).  Lady Spencer (Charlotte Rampling - Swimming Pool) is excited to give her daughter away to the Duke, though she knows the only reason the Duke is marrying her daughter is to produce an heir to his title.

Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper) is a young, up and coming society male.  He's to go to college and he studies to become a politician.  Though they met before her marriage, Georgiana takes an interest in Charles because her passions are politics and gambling.  As her marriage decays, especially after inviting her friend Elizabeth ""Bess"" Foster who betrays her friendship by striking up an affair with the Duke, Georgiana finds herself even more drawn to young Grey.

The music and photography are stunning; the costume design, sets, and visuals are spectacular.  I'm not fond of Ralph Fiennes, but I find him very appropriate in the role of the Duke.  His acting was better than it's ever been.  Georgiana is saucy and intelligent, the scriptwriter dialogue is well done and makes for great characters that you find yourself involved with.  On a funny note, all this talk about having sons during the era is quite humorous in today's world, where we know that the sex of the child is determined by the sperm of the father.  In the movie's era, though, it was the woman who was blamed for the birth of daughters.

While a beautiful movie, it's a sad tale.  The position of women in that era was so restricted that they were helplessly dependent on men.  Georgiana's trials are heartrending, and her husband is a cold man incapable of seeing women as anything more than an object he owns.  I loved this film, the beauty of it and the subject of material.  While the film claims to be based on a true story, I'm not historically competent enough to judge if it is or isn't.  Still, it's a magnificent film, one that you shouldn't miss if you like dramas of the era.  Enjoy!",1232841600,,2332,4.579710144927536
3681173,4,B001L57ZZG,"I went into The Duchess with low expectations; in fact, I don't think I would have rented the film if it hadn't been my only choice.  I mean, another period British drama starring Keira Knightley!  However, this film grabbed me almost from the start and didn't let go until the very end.  I think what made this movie so engrossing for me was the fact that it's based on a real person who is remembered 200 years later and was a relative of Princess Diana.  It's almost eerie how Princess Diana's life so easily mimicked that of her ancestor, Georgiana Spencer:  from the marriage that started out hopeful and became loveless, the husband's affairs, and the need to produce an heir.

What this film also highlights is the plight of women in Georgiana Spencer's time.  The husbands were free to conduct affairs and create bastard children, but their wives could be beaten and have their children taken away at the whim of their husbands.  One of the most awful points in this film is when Georgiana confronts her husband about his affair with a woman he allows to live with them and demands to have her own lover.  What follows is most gut-wrenching rape in a film I've seen in a long time.  All the more gut-wrenching because you don't actually see the rape occurring; all you hear are Georgiana's screams as they echo throughout the house.  Ironically, it's this incident that leads to the birth of the Duke's much-wanted, much-needed, heir.

I'm normally not a Keira Knightley fan, but she was simply wonderful in this role.  She truly becomes Georgiana Spencer.  There are several scenes that stand out for me: her hurt she feels when the Duke requires that she take care of his illegitimate daughter, whom she comes to love as her own; the anger and hurt displays when her husband's affair with Bess is discovered and Georgiana realizes she has no control over her life and household; and most especially when Georgiana must give up her own illegitimate daughter, which shows Knightley's full talent as an actress.

I also felt the chemistry between her and her lover was minimal.

3681175,5,B001L57ZZG,"Georgiana Spencer Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, was a well known society beauty in eighteenth century England.  She lived lavishly and sometimes self-destructively, trapped in a marriage to a man who valued her primarily for her ability to produce heirs.  She was also very active politically since her husband was one of the leaders of the Whigs, a group which called for Parliamentary supremacy, limits on the monarchy, and protection for civil liberties.

This film is an adaptation of Amanda Foreman's excellent biography of Georgiana.  It does an excellent job portraying Georgiana's public and private lives, including the bizarre menage a trois which she maintained with her husband and her best friend for many years.  The film was made at some of Georgiana's real homes, especially Chatsworth House, which is still the residence of the present Duke of Devonshire.

The film is interesting on many levels and though it lags at times, for the most part it's paced well.  Really, it's a bit hard to feel sorry for a woman so inherently rich, and blessed with such awesome beauty, but at times you feel her Gilded Cage as it closes in on her.  She is certainly reckless at times and for the era she acts very Gloria Steinem, which seems anachronistic to say the least.  Ralph Fiennes is a boorish presence as always, playing to type.

She's too gorgeous to be a real person and way too skinny to be a woman of the 18th century, but no matter, I loved the movie. I grudgingly admit, she is a very fine actress. The number one task of a historical movie is to make us believe we are living in those times, to allow us to feel and experience what it must have been like when, in this case, England ruled the world. The Duchess succeeded wonderfully. Ralph Fiennes was terrific--completely believable as the cold but partly human Duke of Devonshire. He embodied the emotional reserve, social sense of place and devotion to duty that we have come to think of as English. The locations were fabulous, the music lushly layered and powerfully emotional in just the right places. Nothing is as amazing as real life. Pardon me for going a bit over the top, but at the close, I felt I had seen much more than a movie, I had witnessed the drama of human existence.",1232150400,,976,4.427777777777778

The story is based off true events and the movie does a fairly decent job at transporting you to that time and place.  It is amazing to see how people of royalty lived back then.

The reason for the lower review is because there just isn't anything that spectacular or surprising.  I would recommend it to friends if they enjoy those time period films but it did not floor me.  I thought the story line was average and I never felt any bit of true emotion while watching.  You definately won't walk away floored and I doubt you really would have this on your must see list.

The tale is told using period piece splendor that includes excellent set design and art direction.

Set in the late 1700s, Georgiana learns as a young woman that she has been betrothed to the Duke, whom it turns out only wants to marry her so that she may bear him male heirs. However, after birthing only daughters, the Duke spurns the Duchess and seeks out romantic relations with her best friend (the soap opera element).

The relationships between she, her husband, and her best friend in a sort of perverse love triangle, are very interesting and rich dramatic material that Knightly navigates effortlessly.

Fiennes is her equal throughout, playing the Duke with his typical dark sensibilities. He is not a cliched villain with whom the viewer cannot emphasize. There is a forced quality to his life though which he commits atrocities all while maintaining the aura of a man pushed towards harshness by his role and responsibilities. He is easy to detest, but demands more than simple hatred. Fiennes' portrayal is believable to the core, and so well done that at times he dominates the screen in confrontations with his female co-star.

The sets and art direction are superb. Interiors are often cast in the murky light of candles with studio lighting only added when absolutely necessary. The costumes are also well done and effectively immerse the viewer into the world of the characters. Knightly looks stunning throughout, and makes the film easy to watch for those who are not huge fans of historical dramas.

3681181,5,B001L57ZZG,"Beautiful, passionate and heartwrenching.  Easy words to describe ""The Duchess"" featuring outstanding performances by Keira Knightley and Ralph Fiennes in a true story of Georgianna Cavendish, the Duchess of Devonshire and her husband William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire.

Before the modern media frenzy covering the lives of Lady Diana Spencer, Princess and Wales or Sarah, Duchess of York and the men they were involved with in their lives, over 200 years ago, the story of Georgianna, the Duchess of Devonshire was the epitome of socialite, of high fashion to many.  But behind close doors, her life as the Duchess of Devonshire was not so pleasant.

Back in 1774, a 17-year-old Georgianna Spencer (Knightley) was chosen to be the wife of  the 5th Duke of Devonshire, William Cavendish (Fiennes).  For Georgianna, she thought that married life was to be happy and imagined her husband to be like her father.  Talkative, loving... but the Duke was not exactly that type of man.

In ""The Duchess"", Duke William Cavendish was a cold, emotionless man.  Rarely did he talk to his wife, all he wanted her for is to give birth to a son to be the rightful heir.  For Georgianna, she learned that her husband was not a good man, a good lover and a good husband.  He slept with women, in fact, having an illegitimate daughter named Charlotte who Georgianna raised as one of her own.  And by the age of 24, having given birth to two girls, the Duke was getting restless.

In his mind, the marriage was an agreement that he gave her the lifestyle but in return she would give him a son.  And because she has not done that, she has been considered a bad wife according to the Duke.

While at a party, Georgianna watches her husband asking another woman to dance.  Her name is Lady Elizabeth Foster, wife of politician John Thomas Foster who she had separated from.  She had been living in lodges and unable to see her children.  Georgianna, feeling pity for her develops a strong friendship with Lady Elizabeth aka ""Bess"" and invites her to move into their home.

Meanwhile, at a party at the home, Georgianna comes across one of her good friends, Charles Grey (2nd Earl Grey).  Both of them have liked each other during their teens and Grey is now preparing himself to be a politician.  Grey has always loved Georgianna and Georgianna helps him get votes by making public appearances at his events and helping an old friend out.  But she realizes that their feelings from when they are teenagers continue to exist and realizes that Grey still thinks about her and has every day since she left to get married to the Duke.

But all is not well when she returns back home.  She finds out that the Duke has been having sex with Bess and to make things worse, the Duke wants Bess to live at their home permanently.  Not thrilled that her husband has taken her best friend away from her but now wanting to keep his mistress in the same home.  This devastation has driven Georgianna to her good friend Charles Grey, the only man who has truly loved her and she truly loves as well.

But what happens when the gossip papers (old tabloids) start to publish news of their affair.  Who will Georgianna choose?  A happy love life with the man she truly loves.  Or to live an unhappy life with the Duke and his mistress?  And how will the Duke respond to these rumors?

A complicated but yet well-written, well-paced film that clearly brings out the recreation of the late 1700's and showcasing one of the most prominent women of England's past.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

The video is presented in 1080p High Definition.  The picture quality looks great on Blu-ray and the beautiful scenery of that time period is captured well on camera.  I will say that there are many parts where lighting may have been an issue because the picture quality seems a bit flat at times.  But there are moments where you do get vibrant colors but not eye popping.  If anything, the video does have a good transfer.

As for audio, the film is featured in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD and despite the film being primarily a dialogue-driven type of film, the shining moments audio-wise for the film is the use of music which effectively makes a scene come alive in certain areas of the film.  There is also a French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital track included as well.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Duchess"" has several special features included on the Blu-ray disc:

  * How Far She Went... Making ""The Duchess"" - Presented in HD, this featurette was exciting as it featured interviews with the cast, but also people on staff.  From making the hairstyle, the makeup, the clothing, finding locations to film the movie and much more.  A very well done featurette.
  * Georgianna in Her Own Words - Presented in HD is an interview with Amanda Foreman, author of ""Georgianna, Duchess of Devonshire"" who reads a few letters that were written by Georgianna herself.
  * Costume Diary - Presented in HD, this featurette focuses on the fashion at the time and getting the costumes of that era look authentic in the film.
  * Trailers - Trailers for upcoming releases.

Surprisingly, there is no commentary.  It would have been a blast to hear the director talk about the film since there was so much put into it.  I would have loved to hear Amanda Foreman who wrote the original book talk about Georgianna but unfortunately there is no commentary.

As an American, I truly never understood how important Georgianna, the Duchess of York truly was.  I've always wondered previous to the film's release why some viewers made comparisons to Lady Diana Spencer and Georgianna (Spencer) Cavendish.  Even I was surprised to find out side that Lady Diana was a descendant of Georgianna's brother and to see the similarities of both lives fro two different time periods.

Two women from different times who have similar story in that they were women who had happiness or lack of happiness in their well-documented lives with their husband, having to be in the spotlight of tabloids, loving mother to their children, enjoying the fashion of their time and being involved with certain activities, I can see why there have  been comparisons.

I was even surprised to find out afterward how even Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York (ie. Fergie) was a descendant of the Duchess Georgianna as well.  Sarah Ferguson is the descendant of Eliza (the illegitimate daughter of Georgianna and Charles Grey).  And to learn also that the tea Earl Grey was named after Charles Grey and even his accomplishments as a Prime Minister during his lifetime.

As for the Blu-ray, the special features were quite informative but I wished there was commentary for such an elaborate film such as ""The Duchess"" but you do get informative special features and overall, this film was just enchanting, passionate and breathtaking but at the same time, heartwrenching.

From it's beautiful presentation, it's well-written story and it's top tier talent, ""The Duchess"" is a fantastic film and it's beauty captured well on Blu-ray!",1231459200,7,7029,4.755371900826447
3681182,5,B001L57ZZG,"Let me first state that I was not a huge Kiera Knightly fan, mainly because I can literally hear the sound of teen girls around the world sticking their fingers down their throats to lose their dinners everytime her bony body is called ""sexy"" while lovely healthy curvy women like Kate Winslet are refered to as be ""zaftig"" or ""Rubenesque"", but Kiera has won me over with this performance. In fact, I would say that this is the most emotionally charged film of the previous year, and possibly the best performance (and yes, I have seen the over hyped ""Dark Knight"". I wasn't thrilled).
 Knightly actually looks healthy, glowing, and absolutely radiant in the role of Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire whose social climbing mother marries her off to a much older, emotional cold Duke played by Ralph Fiennes (who is, as he is in all of his roles, absolutely brillant). Georgiana weds before the age of 18 to a man she barely knows and clearly does not love, but she tries to be a good wife and mother, even going as far as to raise the Duke's illegitimate daughter as her own. She becomes a major star in the social scene of the time, with her unique style, wit, and beauty, and seems content to live separate lives with the Duke though still residing under one roof. All of this changes when the Duke chooses her best and only friend as his mistress and forces Georgiana to live with her as well. Georgiana then turns to her childhood sweetheart and falls deeply in love for the first time in her life. Of course, society being what it was (and is), the Duke does not allow her to keep her lover and forces her to make a heartbreaking choice between the love of her life and her children. This story is made all the more poignant knowing that her descendant the Princess of Wales would have to face a similar choice in our modern era of supposed equality.
 Some reviewers have said that the values and standards of the time will be seem alien to modern viewers. I greatly disagree. It has only in very recent years become the norm for women to choose their own mates based (hopefully) on love and not face becoming a complete outcaste if they divorce their husbands. In fact, in much of the Muslim world, arranged marriages are still the norm, and even in the West amongst certain religious groups (conservative Catholics being the main one), women are often trapped in loveless or even abusive marriages because divorce is such a taboo.

3681184,4,B001L57ZZG,"""The Duchess"" is an exquisitely produced 18th century period piece drama, with a solid cast, first rate production values, and a rather depressing plot.  The movie insists on being interpreted on its own terms of 18th century social customs, morals, and laws.

As the story opens, Lady Spencer (Charlotte Rampling) is arranging the marriage of her daughter Georgiana (Kiera Knightley) to the much older and very wealthy Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes), who badly wants a male heir.  The young and naive Georgiana is suddenly the mistress of a great household at the center of society.  Unfortunately, when four pregnancies fail to produce a male heir, the Duke looks elsewhere, taking as mistress Georgiana's companion Mrs. Foster (Hayley Atwell).  Georgiana's own affair  with a young lawyer (Dominic Cooper) draws the ire of the Duke, who will offer his errant wife a fateful choice.

""The Duchess"" is a tough movie to watch, although it is decent enough spectacle based on its production values.  Georgiana's spirited quest for her place in the world runs counter to her husband's desires and the customs of her time; the ending is not necessarily a happy one.  It is recommended to fans of period costume drama.",1231027200,,1218,5.05
3681185,4,B001L57ZZG,"The Duchess is a lush and lovely portrait of the queen of late eighteenth century English society, Georgiana, daughter of Earl Spencer and wife of the Duke of Devonshire. She was a great beauty celebrated in paint by Reynolds and Gainsborough, a friend of the Whig political leader Charles Fox, the playwright/politician Sheridan and the witty and irascible lexicographer Dr. Johnson. She was also the lover of a future Prime Minister, Earl Grey, whose family cared for their illegitimate daughter.

The movie, based on a best-selling novel, focuses on Georgiana's troubled marriage that included a twenty-year menage a trois involving her best friend, Lady Elizabeth Foster whom the Duke married after Georgiana's death. Some will draw comparisons with Prince Charles, Diana (coincidentally a member of the same Spencer family) and Camilla Parker Bowles.

The acting is superb, especially Ralph Fiennes as the cold-hearted but oddly endearing Duke, Keira Knightley as the beautiful, bright, alcohol and gambling addicted Georgiana, Charlotte Rampling as Georgiana's aristocratic, sensible, worldly-wise but sympathetic mum and Dominic Cooper as the up-and-coming politico, Charles Grey.

The story is compelling, the direction well-paced, the period detail -- costumes, furnishings, manor-houses and gardens, art, music and other entertainment of the era -- authentic in its elegance and splendor. There is hardly a glimpse of the great mass of humanity unless clothed in servants' livery, cheering plays and political speeches, or running alongside the Duke's coach. There is, however, an ominous inkling of revolutionary change in far off America and nearby France.

There is also reference to an elusive concept of ""freedom"" with the implication that the Duke and Duchess are ""prisoners"" in a gilded cage. Perhaps, but one wonders if these people would have been happier had they been poor.",1231027200,,1894,5.520689655172414
3681186,4,B001L57ZZG,"The Duchess is a superior slice of costume drama which manages to craft interesting, multi dimensional characters and an involving storyline from the well worn confines of the genre.

Keira Knightley plays a very similar role to the one she played in Pride and Prejudice, a feisty, modern woman trapped in a male dominated society. However, whereas Lizzie Bennett's heart and character inspires affection, the Duchess of Devonshire's fosters only reproach and punishment from her traditional and patriarchal husband. Her performance is a standout and demonstrates why she is so highly rated in the face of many disappointing roles in other films. She brings both strength and weakness to the character. Able to deliver withering put downs at her husband and others, whilst showing the pain of her loveless marriage etched into her face.

If Knightley is the lynchpin of the piece then it is Ralph Fiennes that elevates it above a crowded genre. Resisting the temptation to play his character as evil, instead he simply plays him as a man of his times. In Fiennes' hands the Duke feels no need to win any bouts of verbal jousting with his wife as he is secure in the knowledge that, as a husband, he is in complete control of the relationship. The Duke also clearly sees very little wrong in his treatment of his wife and acts, as he sees it, in a logic manner making the whole film feel more believable and, as a result, tragic.

In terms of the cast the only misstep is Dominic Cooper as Charles Grey, who lends the wide eyes of a political dreamer but doesn't have convincing chemistry with Knightley and plays one of the more one dimensional characters in the piece. However Hayley Atwell impresses by playing her character so well it is possible to describe her as scheming, and manipulative as well as sympathetic and loyal without it seeming a contradiction.

The film is deliberately paced so as to give characters and events time to breathe, encouraging the mood that the marriage is a car crash in slow motion, inextricably drawing all the characters further into the muddled mess of their relationships. Overall it's a fully recommended slice of real life costume drama that draws a multi layered drama full of compellingly deep characters from what could easily have been a one note story.",1231027200,2,2300,4.844783715012722

A historical costume drama with some powerful performances, THE DUCHESS is the study of The Duchess of Devonshire and her battles with The Duke during their strained marriage.

Little known director Saul Dibb gets a dream cast in Keira Knightley (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Atonement/dp/B00140PL9U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Atonement</a>) as The Duchess and Ralph Fiennes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Constant-Gardener/dp/B000C65Z1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Constant Gardener</a>) as The Duke. Thanks to Fiennes' uber-talent as a powerhouse actor, he helps pull the entire production up several rungs. Knightley shines unexpectedly bright in her role as the clothes-designing Duchess who steps into royalty and a marriage of the times; that is to say, something completely foreign to those of us in today's world.

By contract, she is to be honorable and deliver the Duke an heir: a son. But three girls later and the Duke is becoming restless. He finds lust wherever his loins take him and the Duchess must simply bear it. A friend and confidant, Bess (Hayley Atwell), soon turns into a lady of conflict as she sleeps with, and then moves in with, the Duke. The Duchess tries to settle the matter but the Duke's power won't allow her any leeway.

When a past love arrives in the Duchess' life, a powder keg erupts. Mr. Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mamma-Mia/dp/B001GKJ2FW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mamma Mia!</a>) turns the Duchess' life upside down, and when she becomes pregnant with his child, the Duke's orders force her into an impossible situation: give the baby up (and give up Mr. Grey) or never see your children again.

The terrible power wielded by The Duke is pulled off exceptionally well thanks to the high performance of Ralph Fiennes. Surprisingly you loathe him and then, as the film progresses, you actually pity him when he says things like, ""Look at them. To be that free."" His job and title have strapped him down and drove him into this role.

The forced and eventual consummated acceptance of the Duke's power is probably Keira Knightley's strongest reveal for her since I've been watching her flicks.

The costumes and sets are stunning in their elegance and appropriateness, as is the believable love that future Prime Minister Grey (yes, he actually becomes Prime Minister) and the Duchess feel for one another, even when forced apart by society and their own lives.

This is a wonderfully done film with plenty of eye-candy sets and dark characters to make most movie watchers delight.",1230854400,4,2711,5.72636815920398

3681189,5,B001L57ZZG,"Perhaps it is a vital part of this generation of women to be reminded of those days when we women were simply considered, ""Chattel"".  This is an important movie and worthy of food for great conversations with your daughters, and other women.

While watching, I did think of Princess Diana and found it ironic that The Dutchess is one of Princess Diana's relations.  Princess Diana also found herself in a marriage of three.  Yet, as far as we know they did not live under the same roof.  I did find it fascinating that the servants stayed in the room while all sorts of outrageous conversations were taking place and surely gives a new eyeopening pop on the Kings and Queens demanding confidentially oaths amongst their staff.

It is an amazingly sad, wild ride, that leaves one filled with compassion when all is said and done.",1230681600,,828,4.675862068965517
3681190,4,B001L57ZZG,"THE DUCHESS (based on Amanda Foreman's book ""Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire"" which in turn was based on historical fact) has been well adapted for the screen by Jeffrey Hatcher, Anders Thomas Jensen and writer/director Saul Dibb.  What was basically snubbed by the critics of the theatrical release as a 'fashion show with little else going for it' turns out to be a quite beautiful period drama.  The fact that the story is based on the life of the outspoken feminist and political thinker in the late 1700s - Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire - who happens to be an ancestor of Princess Di whose life in many ways paralleled the Duchess,  makes it more interesting than most costume dramas.  And yet, even without the obvious parallel in stories, this film stands well on its own, due to a smart script and a fine cast.

Lady Spencer (Charlotte Rampling) coaxes the marriage of her beautiful daughter Georgiana (Keira Knightley) to marry the very wealthy Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes), a rather boring dog lover whose only interest in 'purchasing' a wife is to gain a male heir.  Caught up in the dignity and lush homes and gardens of the Duke, the new Duchess charms all who see her - and the manner in which Keira Knightley wears the vast number of gorgeous sculpted costumes  gives credence to her appearance popularity and enhances her personal popularity as she looks beyond the surface to the hearts of the people around her.  When the Duchess is unable to produce live boy children (two stillborns don't count, nor do the two daughters she births), The Duke turns to dalliances both with the household maids and to the Duchess' newest friend Lady Bess (Hayley Atwell): the Duchess seeks solace with her childhood love Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper) and the tension in the household comes to a breaking point.  British etiquette rules, and the 'wife' must bear up under the pressure of society, a position the Duchess obeys but continues her popularity with the politics and social comments of the times - quite a daring feat for those revolutionary years in England, America, and France and the world in general.  How this singularly intelligent woman copes provides the resolution of the story.

Keira Knightley is ravishingly beautiful and continues to impress with her sensitive acting skills.  The contributions by Ralph Fiennes, Charlotte Rampling, Dominic Cooper and Hayley Atwell bring finely honed characterizations to life.  Rachel Portman is responsible for the musical score that fits the production like a glove.  There is, then, far more to this film than a panorama of elegant costumes. It is deserving of a larger audience.  Grady Harp, December 08",1230681600,2,2677,4.9708520179372195
3681191,4,B001L57ZZG,"Georgina (Knightley) is not yet 18 when she becomes the Duchess of Devonshire.  Her mother assured Georgina that the Duke loved her.  The Duke (Ralph Fiennes) is a chilly man whose only interest in Georgina is as a broodmare.

The Duke's disappointment becomes quite obvious when Georgina cannot produce a live son.  Despite that, she's labeled as 'The Empress of Fashion' and she's the unofficial Queen of the Court.  As they say, the Duke of Devonshire is the only man in England not in love with his wife.

This film shows the deplorable conditions for women.  For example, Lady Elizabeth Foster (Hayley Atwell) is being beaten by her husband.  It's legal for her husband to beat her as long as the stick is not any bigger than his thumb.  It's also legal for her lord husband to take away his wife's children for no apparent reason at all. The Duke's treatment of Georgina is no less appalling.

""The Duchess"" is a gorgeously costumed and appointed film.  It's eye candy for costume epic fans, although it is painful to see such a lovely woman in an unforgivably unhappy marriage.

3681192,4,B001L57ZZG,"The premise of THE DUCHESS, the theatrical adaptation of Amanda Foreman's biography, GEORGIANA, recreates the contents of the book with Keira Knightley portraying Georgiana or ""G"" and her tumultuous arranged marriage to the Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes) and complex relationship that ensues as the Duke participates in extra-marital affairs, which includes one of G's only confidantes, Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell). G decides two can play that game and she too ventures into the path of infidelity and secretly meets with an old brief acquaintance and political partner, Charles Grey (Dominic Grey).

The film is twofold. First, the Duke and Duchess experience the ups and downs of their marriage and second, the romance between the Georgiana and Charles. The Duke's storyline and somewhat tiresome demeanor shows his controlling nature and dire need to make G conceive a male heir that emphasizes the aristocratic tradition. There was an attempt to include a subtle hint of humor within the film with Fiennes's character; this can be displayed with his continuous doting with his two dogs.

Second, Georgiana and Charles's relationship was far more romantic.  But it would have been interesting to see more of the couple's political collaboration, which may have added another hour to the film. This may have elevated the significance of Georgiana's role and leadership in political affairs, especially during the eighteenth century. However, this was part of the storyline was briefly shown.

Overall, THE DUCHESS was an engaging film.  The period costumes and landscape captured the essence of the movie. For those who enjoyed films such as THE OTHER BOYLYN GIRL or Knightley in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, this film will not disappoint.",1230508800,3,1737,5.324817518248175
3681193,4,B001L57ZZG,"""The Duchess"" stars Kiera Knightley as Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire, a young, beautiful woman tied down by the constraints of 18th century English society. Georgiana marries the Duke of Devonshire before she turns 18, hopeful that the ""good match"" will lead to happiness. Sadly, the marriage isn't a happy one, since Georgiana can't bear a son.  As she looks for a way to find happiness in her life, Georgiana buts heads with her husband. As her husband brutally tries to control her, Georgiana discovers the perilous position of women in 18th century society, a position that no amount of charm, intelligence or beauty can free her from.

Knightley is good as Georgiana.  She captures the Duchess' pain as she struggles against her husband and herself.  The movie is beautifully shot--this is certainly a period drama that spares no expense.  Ralph Fiennes is a bit flat as the Duke--but you wonder if his character is supposed to be that way.

I would recommend this movie to fans of period drama and historical romance.  The film is well done, and is an interesting, if depressing, view of 18th century English society.",1230508800,2,1130,4.91578947368421

SPOILERS:

 Imagine being married to someone who turns out to be cold as ice and wants nothing from you but a male heir, blames you for not coming up with one, then invites another woman to live in your household and tries to get an heir that way!
Apparently, this all happened to Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire.  Eventually, she has to learn to live with the situation and with multiple kids, as well as having to give up one baby.  I put a lot of the blame for all this on G's mother, who pushed her into the arranged marriage and then expected her to suppress her anguish and put up with all the betrayal in order to maintain a position of wealth and status.
Then again, women at that time had few, if any, choices in such matters.
