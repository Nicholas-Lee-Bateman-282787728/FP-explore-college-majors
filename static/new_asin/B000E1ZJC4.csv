As some movie-going-folks like to moan, ""the book was better!"" Before I start bashing this DVD (sorry Martha) I'd like to say that I believe the book is great. A 5 star in my opinion. (I'll write that review soon, I promise). I expected the visuality of DVD to be a huge plus next to the book. That's why I bought it. However, as a perfectionist, there are several things that annoyed me big time.
The low standpoint of the camera.
The poor lighting (in the room.)
The noise of some bird or machine at the beginning.
The coughing of partisipants of the class.
The average quality of the images.
The use of the camera that at times is focused on a board while Martha is clearly pointing out something on another board or when only 3/4 of her body is in view.
To me it feels like a friend was asked to film one of her classes. I wished it was a instruction dvd. Just Martha and her material. All done with a professional production team. That would have made it well worth the money.
I've watched it only one time but I hope that combining the information with my training to become a trainer will add some benefits to the book. But I'm not very hopefull.
My biggest advice to Martha would be, do it again but use a 5 star professional production team. Then this DVD might become of blockbuster status.",1240876800,6,1586,5.080459770114943
8104492,5,B000E1ZJC4,"I am impressed with this product. Before purchasing this product, I read the reviews published here. And although they were glowing, I was some what skeptical. To tell you the truth, I own dozens of books about writing as I am particular interested in writing methodology. I find it infinitely interesting to study the way that other writer work. But usually I just end up picking and choosing a few good tips from material and retiring the rest. This book has proven to be ultimately usable and I found practical and meaningful advice on every page. I have now instituted the recommendations this book proposes and feel my writing has picked up its pace and significantly tightened. The techniques this series illustrates definitely pointed out the holes in my plot, and gave real suggestion on how and why to fill them. The one drawback I found was that I purchased the packaged set and really didn't need it. The DVD is a reiteration of the book. But if you are the kind of person who needs information presented in multiple formats to really grasp the nuances of it, then the DVD / Book combo might be a good idea. Otherwise, stick with one or the other.",1203292800,2,1158,4.62621359223301
8104493,5,B000E1ZJC4,"I'm a full-time writer. I spend about five hours a day spinning tales

but the Blockbuster Plot material has given me a sort of template to set my writing down inside. I just can't tell you how much Martha Alderson is

changing my writing life.

I couldn't finish.  I could begin and I could end but I couldn't finish.  It was because the middle of my novels caused me so much pain that I'd stop and start another one.  Martha Alderson's Blockbuster Plots, book and DVD''s ended that pain.

This all reminds me of a pair of shoes that hurt my feet.  Then one day I lined them and they felt fine.  A simple step left out -- made me wince when I walked and cushions fixed it.  Martha  provided me with the cushions I needed -- to walk comfortably through my writing life.  She showed me how to take my unique ways, put her cushions in them and walk with a smile.

I have nine incomplete novels.  Good ones, heck maybe great masterpieces, we'll I'm not all that but I am now on my way to finishing.  And that's why I think Martha's opinion about plot is genius.  And she's made those tools available to anyone who want's to invest in them.  If you're a business person that knows how to figure cost to benefit ratios, this is an investment - way up on the benefit side.  And would you believe it, it took me years to find this.

Blessings,

Pastor Sid Chaney

P.S.  With Martha's materials mastered you win. It's gives you a template like a skeleton or a paint by number to drop your writing in and you won't find it anyplace else, not like this.  She also shows you how to literally hang your plot on walls.  How to fill them in with multi-colors to express your whole book vividly.  How to plaster them around you, so you can see in one panoramic view, your whole creation at once.  That's worth almost any price.  Buy her stuff, master it, use it and it may make all your writing dreams come true.  At least you will get better, it will be easier and if you're not having fun already, you will.

And finally, remember, the only reason I'm writing this is because I believe deeply in what Martha Alderson is doing in Blockbuster Plots.",1163548800,7,2134,4.30478589420655
8104494,5,B000E1ZJC4,"The Blockbuster Plot DVD is one of the most valuable resources available to writers.  It's packed with guidance, inspiration, and information that helped me turn my work from a great idea into a masterfully crafted book.  I cannot recommend this enough!!  Get your hands on this DVD - it is priceless.",1140393600,10,301,4.862745098039215
8104495,5,B000E1ZJC4,"I have attended more screenwriting workshops than I want to admit. None of them, get that? None, have given me a fraction of what this DVD plot demo DVD gave me. I only wish I had seen it years ago.

The DVD gives practical, hand-on, concrete help to deepen characters, amp up the tension, conflict and suspense, and gives great insight into how to come up with depth and lasting meaning.

I can't rank this product high enough. Absolutely recommend it with no hesitation of all writers. Check it out. You'll be glad you did.",1137456000,19,525,4.515789473684211
