7002887,5,B00T86J0UI,"The 7 Way IC Title Ladder Match (Champion Bad News Barrett vs. R-Truth vs. Dean Ambrose vs. Luke Harper vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. Daniel Bryan vs. Stardust) was a high-flying,smash-mouth,brutal fun-fest. The Randy Orton-Seth Rollins match was solid with a cool ending to boot. The Sting-Triple H NO DQ-match was a pretty good brawl even with the TNA-style interference. The Paige/AJ Lee-The Bella Twins-tag team match was a big sloppy at times, but they did some nice stuff. The Rusev-John Cena-US title match match was your basic John Cena bout with no real surprises. The Bray Wyatt-Undertaker match was your basic big man brawl but a good one to say the least. The Brock Lesnar-Roman Reigns-World title match was a hard-hitting,smash-mouth,back-and-forth bout with a surprise ending to boot. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10.",1427846400,6,821,5.0
7002888,3,B00T86J0UI,"Where did it start?

That stupid ""anonymous"" Raw General Manager email messenger thing?

John Cena or Edge winning the title every-other week?

Albeto Del Rio winning the 40-Man Royal Rumble?

Giving The Miz a title run?

The Rock vs Cena ""Once in a Lifetime"" match at back-to-back Wrestlemanias?

Bringing back Brock Lesnar to feud with Cena for just 1 month, only to have him lose?

Denying Shemus the right to ""Headline"" Wrestlemania after winning the rumble, only to have him compete in the opening match with an 18-second victory over someone that should have never had the title at that time?

Merging the titles again on a whim during a pointless PPV instead of building it up to an epic match at Wrestlemania?

Turning the Royal Rumble into a joke by allowing gag-entries such as JBL, Michael Cole, The Godfather, and countless others that just show up for a mere minute or less.  Thank God Rey Mysterio is gone, was I the only one getting sick of him managing to 619 every single person in the ring during a rumble, or how Kofi Kingston is now automatically expected to do some amazing ""out of the ring"" trick to avoid being eliminated?  Stop scripting the rumble so much and just let them all brawl it out.  The Rikishi & Too Cool dancing in the ring during the rumble several years ago was one of the stupidest things I have ever seen go on during the match.  This year's rumble was possibly even worse than last year's.  The Rock is not a band-aid.  If we hate Reigns, then shoving The Rock in front of him will not make us automatically like him.

Redesigning the belt to look like a ridiculous Wonder Woman logo.  It is by far, the worst belt design EVER.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly where WWE started down the wrong path, but it seems that they're pulling a George W. Bush and ""staying the course"", because things seem to be getting worse and worse.  First and foremost, I believe it begins with the commentating crew.  Who is today's Gorilla Monsoon & Jesse Ventura, Jim Ross & Jerry Lawler?  It's hard to even enjoy the action in the ring when the announcing crew is babbling nonsense instead of calling the match with enthusiasm.

Next, what the hell happens in these corporate meetings between Vince McMahon, HHH, Stephanie, etc... and the writers?  Why would they NOT project storylines out a couple of months to build up the main event at Wrestlemania?  Back in the early days, we all knew who would be main-eventing Wrestlemania: The top 2 guys.  Preferably the top good guy, and the top bad guy, but once in a while, the rare opportunity would arise to create something special, a match between the top 2 good guys (Hogan & Warrior, Rock & Austin III).  Roman Reigns' rise to the top was rushed and forced.  You cannot fool the audience anymore, that's why the crowds are turning on your 'heroes', they're yours; not ours.

The IC ladder match was also a hugely-missed opportunity for an historic showdown between the only 2 guys that should be competing for it: Dolph Ziggler and Daniel Bryan.  That would have rivaled Macho Man vs Ricky Steamboat or Shawn Michaels vs Razor Ramon.  Again, that match should have been in the planning for the past few months, but instead, they give it to us on Raw for virtually no reason.

Has anyone else realized that Dean Ambrose is the new Rowdy Roddy Piper?  Or how Dolph Ziggler is the hybrid of Mr. Perfect & Chris Jericho?

For some reason, Ryback was getting a huge push a couple of years ago, and today, he might as well not even exist.  Same for Cesaro, he was starting to gain a lot of momentum last year, but now, he's back being a forgotten 'never-was'.

Not re-signing Kurt Angle for another (short) run was another screw-up.  He wanted to come back on a part-time schedule.  Angle vs Rusev would have been epic.  Having Angle engage Lesnar in another feud would certainly have been worth watching again, but greedy WWE didn't want to negotiate.

I also have a problem with the way the stage design takes up an eighth of the entire arena.  The bigger the stage, the less seats are available for fans to attend.  There's no way WM32 will come close to the indoor attendance record, thousands of potential seats will be taken up by a ridiculously large stage.  Go back to WM3-style and have NOTHING, rely on the 50-yard screen above the stadium for the graphics, and then bring the wrestlers out in those miniature-motorized wrestling rings.  Those were awesome.

On to this year's WrestleMania:

Right off the bat, excluding the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal just discredited any prestige it may have potentially held.  Only in its 2nd year, it has already become a joke.  Same goes for the Tag Team Title match.  With 4 teams competing, that just means they ran out of ideas and figured it'd be a good idea to have as many participants as possible, bad move.

The Intercontinental Championship Ladder match:  An utter pointless clusterf*ck of misused talent.  A triple-threat match between Bryan, Ziggler, and Ambrose may have been acceptable, because those are the only performers anyone had any interest in, which it ended up boiling down to.  Is it necessary to have every a$$hole in that match somehow knock down the rest of the group... that was getting a bit ridiculous.  As Bryan has already been a multi-time Heavyweight Champion, him holding the IC almost seems as a demotion, rather than keep him in the main-event picture and let Ziggler or Ambrose carry it for a while.

Orton vs Rollins:  What was the point of the Jon Stewart storyline from a few weeks back?  No appearance by him to end the story?  Orton has become another version of John Cena: oversaturated, peaked too early, now is just hanging around taking up space without anyone really caring anymore if he wins titles or not.  The feud between the two was rushed, almost as if WWE just slapped this match together because they didn't have any better ideas.  The crowd was lifeless throughout the match and J&J Security are ruining any credibility that Rollins may have.  He needs to ditch them and they can go suck off the Miz's teet for a while.  The match did feature an innovative finish, which was nice.

Sting vs HHH: Not much to say here, the match was somewhat entertaining, I'm not sure what I expected it to be, but it didn't disappoint me.  The DX vs NWO bit was kind of cool, it was a good ending to an open chapter.

Divas Match:  Let's face it, nobody really cares who wins or loses, its a novelty, its eye-candy, its a bathroom break

Cena vs Rusev:  Something is seriously wrong when the crowd is rooting for the Russian that ""hates"" America.  Cena needs to go away for a while, nobody cares anymore.  Cena winning the title virtually served no purpose and actually hurt any credibility that Rusev had.  Rusev's over-acting is almost clownish.

HHH/Stephanie/Rock promo took way too long, it almost seemed like a stalling tactic.  Stephanie or Vince thanking the fans would have been much better, again.... The Rock is not a band-aid.

The Mt. Dew product placement is downright SHAMEFUL.  Why not just slap a giant logo in the center of the ring?

Wyatt vs Undertaker:  There is no way Undertaker was going to lose 2 Wrestlemanias in a row, the result was quite foreseeable.  Taker was quite lethargic and sluggish, almost lifeless (in a bad way).  It seemed like it was only happening for his redemption, but was an overall letdown.  Wyatt had good intensity and showed the potential in his strength, but nothing mentionable happened during the match.  Taker over-sold his human-side which portrayed him as weak and vulnerable...

Reigns vs Lesnar:  Reigns played the victim well, he even ripped off Cena's ""Never Give Up"" tagline.  It was a good match, reminded me of Rocky 4 when Rocky cuts open Ivan Drago and everyone exclaims: ""He's Not A Machine!"", that seemed to be the same case for Lesnar, but it was good to see his dominance.  Rollins cashing in his MITB contract and pinning Reigns was a nice touch, because nobody wanted to see Lesnar pinned.

Overall, it was a pretty good show.  Parts of it seemed slapped together, and most of the undercard were greatly misused; but it had some good moments and seemed to be above the average PPV.",1427760000,4,8222,4.64677307425399
7002889,5,B00T86J0UI,"1.) Intercontinental Championship Ladder Match: R-Truth vs Luke Harper vs Dean Ambrose vs Stardust vs Dolph Ziggler vs Daniel Bryan vs Bad News Barrett (c)

This was the first Wrestlemania since Wrestlemania 10 in which the Intercontinental Championship was defended in a Ladder Match. This match received some unfair criticism from fans in the weeks leading up to Mania but I think this match shut the critics up. It's been awhile since a Ladder match took place at Wrestlemania but this was a great way to start off the show. This match had plenty of action and a lot of the high and sick spots you'd expect from a Ladder match at Wrestlemania. One of the best moments from the match was when Harper powerbombed Ambrose through a ladder balanced in between the ring and the barricade. I could go on about other moments and spots, but it's a match that really just needs to be seen. Ambrose, Ziggler, and Bryan were 3 big favorites going into the match. The end comes with Bryan and Ziggler getting into a headbutt battle on top of the ladder but in the end, Bryan's headbutt prevails, sending Ziggler off the ladder. Bryan retrieves the title, winning his first IC title and his second championship at Wrestlemania

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) Seth Rollins w/J&J Security vs Randy Orton

The build-up for this match had been brewing since last November when Rollins took out Orton with a Curb Stomp. With Orton back for vengeance and looking to destroy the future of the WWE, this match was extremely intense and the build-up for it paid off. Orton came out, going a little retro with his attire, decked in his old red tights with the elbow pads. This match was extremely athletic and one of the best Randy Orton matches I've seen in awhile. Both men moved at a fast pace and displayed great agility. Orton takes out J&J Security early with a double DDT on the floor. Rollins looked to have a win in the bag following a Curb Stomp, but Orton stayed in the match. Rollins attempts another Curb Stomp but Orton amazingly reverses it into an epic RKO for the win. Extremely impressive match! Orton and Rollins have tremendous in-ring chemistry with each other

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) No Disqualifications Match: Sting vs Triple H

This was one match many had been waiting for. Sting's first match in WWE was finally here. The heart and soul of WCW vs one of the many locker room leaders of the Attitude Era during the Monday Night War. Sting had an impressive entrance with a Japanese taiko drum group performing before and during his entrance to the ring. Triple H's entrance however blew Sting's out of the water and had every bit of theatrics you could imagine. Scenes from the upcoming Terminator Genisys were used for Triple H's entrance as well as several Terminator robot statues. I don't think it was fair that Triple H's entrance outshined Sting's but I can't deny that it was an epic entrance. The match itself was also outstanding. Triple H and Sting get some back and forth action in on each other. Just as Sting locks in the Scorpion Deathlock, the New Age Outlaws and X-Pac storm the ring to try to save HHH but get taken out by Sting. Eventually the numbers game catches up to Sting and we get an NWO interference in the form of Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall, and Kevin Nash make the save and we get a clash of the Monday Night Wars as the NWO and DX brawl. We even get an interference from Shawn Michaels who superkicks Sting but it's still not enough to keep him down. Eventually a sledgehammer shot puts Sting down for good and Triple H gets the win. After the match, Sting and Triple H shake hands, displaying a mutual form of respect for each other. I was disappointed that Sting didn't win as there was literally no reason for Triple H to go over but at least they both created a Wrestlemania memory that will forever be remembered

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Paige and AJ Lee vs The Bella Twins

Thanks to the ""Give Divas A Chance"" movement over the last month, this match got some fairly intense build-up. The promo exchanged between the Bellas and AJ and Paige on the final Smackdown before Wrestlemania is what really sold this match. Going into it, this match was really unpredictable as to who would win, which is the way it should be as it's been too long since there's been a huge unpredictable divas match. Nikki and Brie were out to embarrass Paige and AJ on the biggest stage of them all, while the 2 frenemies were looking to avenge the humiliation the Bellas made them feel over the last few months. Nikki and Paige start things off and Nikki knocks AJ off the apron and gets the upperhand on Paige. Nikki consistently knocks AJ off the apron to prevent her from being in the match, turning the match into a Handicap Match for awhile. Paige eventually gets the tag to AJ who comes in and takes out Nikki. Paige aggressively sends Brie into the steel steps while AJ defeats Nikki, making her tap out to the Black Widow. AJ's Wrestlemania record extends to 2-0, Paige wins her first Wrestlemania and the Bellas are now 0-2. I'm only poking fun at the streak statistics but this was a fairly decent match that got at least 10 minutes of ring time. Now if we can get the title on the line at next year's Wrestlemania
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) WWE United States Championship Match: Rusev (c) w/Lana vs John Cena

In a rematch from Fast Lane, John Cena got another chance to take the title from Rusev and finally be the one to end his anti-American crusade. Rusev had a nice entrance as Lana aided Russian soldiers to the ring, carrying a long Russian flag. Rusev marched to the ring to the tune of the Russian anthem and a Russian flag in hand. Cena also had a nice pre-entrance video that displayed US Presidents like Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy, and Barack Obama. The match itself was well executed. We saw a few never before seen moves as Rusev performed a diving headbutt off the top rope and Cena did a sprinboard like Stunner off the second rope into Rusev. Lana tries to interfere and Rusev accidentally knocks her off the apron. The distraction costs him the match, his title, and his undefeated streak as Super Cena slams the Super Athlete with an AA for the win. It was a great match but so painfully obvious that Cena would be the one to beat Rusev. It was practically Sgt Slaughter vs Hulk Hogan at Wrestlemania 7 all over again; as Rusev took Slaughter's position while Cena took Hogan's. It was a great match but I'm sure I'm not alone when I say, I wish Kurt Angle had signed with WWE to have this match with Rusev instead

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Triple H and Stephanie McMahon come to the ring and talk smack to the fans and cut their usual, outdated, 2013 esque promo saying they own the fans and the arena and WWE. This brings out The Rock who gets an outstanding pop from the crowd. The Rock and Triple H have an intense stare down with each other and Rock pretty much challenges Triple H to a fight in the middle of the ring. Before a fight breaks out, Stephanie interferes and mouths off at The Rock and slaps him before ordering him out of the ring. Rock leaves but re-enters moments later with Ronda Rousey from ringside. Stephanie tries to convince The Rock that Ronda is on her side and reminds him of her being on her side at SummerSlam. When Ronda doesn't budge from Rock's side, Stephanie and Triple H mouth off at them both. This leads to Triple H and The Rock getting into a big fist fight, taking long time fans back to the early 2000s. Ronda gets Stephanie in the armbar and contemplates breaking her arm but releases the hold and Steph escapes. This was truly an amazing moment and did some heavy speculation at 2 possible matches that could happen at next year's Wrestlemania. Rousey vs Stephanie / Rock vs HHH at WM 32 anyone?

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Bray Wyatt vs The Undertaker

The Undertaker hadn't been seen since last year's Wrestlemania when his legendary streak ended at the hands of Brock Lesnar. Skip to February 2015 where Bray Wyatt begins taunting and challenging The Undertaker to fight him at Wrestlemania, claiming he wants to end Undertaker for good and take his rightful place as the new face of fear. Bray Wyatt was added to the list for having an awesome entrance as a group of creepy, zombified scarecrows walk alongside him to the ring. Next out was The Undertaker who wore his 2003/2004 attire with the leather pants and belt buckle. And even more importantly, for the first time since 2011, Taker had hair back on his head. It wasn't shoulder length but his hair was back. Despite people thinking Taker would be in no condition to compete, Taker looked to be in tremendous shape. Much better than last year, that's for sure. The match itself had a nice eerie atmosphere to it and reminded me of Taker's first Wrestlemania match with Kane--from a supernatural standpoint. This was a truly close match as Wyatt looked to be sending Taker to 21-2 on quite a couple of occasions. The best part of this match was when Wyatt spider walks to Taker only to have Taker sit up and stare Wyatt dead on in the eye. A second Tombstone keeps Wyatt down for the 3 count and Undertaker goes 22-1 in his amazing and triumphant return at Wrestlemania 31

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

7.) WWE World Heavyweight Championship Match: Roman Reigns vs Brock Lesnar (c) w/Paul Heyman

The build-up for this match was pretty poor and lackluster. Heyman's promos delivered but they weren't enough to make this match matter as much as it should have. Most of the build-up revolved around Reigns and Heyman rather than Reigns and Lesnar as Lesnar was absent for most of the Road to Wrestlemania. A possible alliance formation between Reigns and Heyman was teased several times, more than likely done just to try and get fans talking. This match was quite similar to Lesnar's 2014 encounter with John Cena at SummerSlam. Lesnar rips into Reigns with multiple German, front, back, and snap suplexes--barely giving Reigns any time for offense or defense. Reigns laughs at the pain he receives which puzzles Lesnar. An outside scuffle, ends with Reigns sending Lesnar into the steel post of the turnbuckle, busting him open. A bloody Lesnar is all it takes for Reigns to get the upperhand as he takes Lesnar down with several Superman punches and Spears. It's not enough to keep Lesnar down though as he floors Reigns with an F5. Suddenly, Seth Rollins runs down and cashes in his Money In The Bank briefcase and the march becomes a Triple Threat. One Curb Stomp later to Reigns and we have a new WWE World Heavyweight Champion and his name is Seth Rollins! Wrestlemania 31 goes off the air with Rollins standing tall as champion as fireworks shoot into the sky to close the show

Overall: What a Wrestlemania! This Wrestlemania had it all! A Ladder Match with a title on the line, Sting's first WWE match, tons of epic entrances, a nicely timed divas match, NWO vs DX, Ronda Rousey and The Rock clashing with Stephanie McMahon and Triple H, The Undertaker's return to battle Bray Wyatt, and a shocking end to the PPV. For the last 2 months, so many people judged and criticized Wrestlemania, saying it'd be horrible and boring and yet, WWE managed to make the negative critics eat their words and gave fans one of the best Wrestlemanias to remember. If you still say that this Wrestlemania was bad after all the classic scenes that took place, you're either in denial or love to complain about the product. I think Wrestlemania 31 kind of served as a precursor to Wrestlemania 32 as a couple of potential matches were teased for next year's event. Ronda Rousey vs Stephanie McMahon, Triple H vs The Rock, and even NWO vs DX. Okay...,maybe the last one is a little far fetched, but still. It doesn't deny the fact that Wrestlemania 31 is one to be remembered for the ages. The entire card was good top to bottom and delivered extremely well. Wrestlemania 31 gets a 5/5 stars from me",1427587200,5,12599,4.922316384180791
7002890,4,B00T86J0UI,"Cesaro and Kidd vs Los Matadores vs New Day vs Usos: Cesaro won after pinning Big E. after stealing the pin from Jey Uso after a top rope splash.
  Andre the Giant Battle Royal: Mizdow had enough of the Miz and eliminated him leaving Mizdow with the Big Show. And Big Show won.
  IC title Ladder match: Bryan won
  Orton vs Rollins: Orton should have lost. I would have been cool with that over Sting losing. But Orton won with an RKO..
  Sting vs Triple H: The fans wanted Sting vs Undertaker but of course greedy big nose saw it that the fans wanted him to beat Sting at WrestleMania. Since he has to beat all the big names. And yes he won and it ruined the night for me. And if Sting vs Undertaker finally does happen Sting will predictably lose that one too. Since Vince can't let a former WCW guy beat his big name guys. Which he already proved with his WCW Invasion angle years ago.
  Paige and AJ beat the Bellas.
  Cena vs Rusev: Cena beating Rusev was obvious the second Rusev said he didn't like America. So of course Cena won the U.S. title and was the hero the WWE needed. Same ole crap. He won with an AA after Rusev hit into Lana. Again I would have been happy with the face losing this one and Sting winning.
  Triple H and Stephanie came out with Triple H having a smug look on his face rubbing in how he beat Sting. Which yes pissed me off more. Since that's the only match where I wanted the face to win. Then the Rock slowly came out. Saying he wants Triple H.
  Stephanie slapped The Rock and told him to get out of her ring. So the Rock left and came back in with UFC fighter Ronda Rousey from the audience. Stephanie was dumb enough to tell her off too. The Rock and Ronda then took out Triple H. Then Ronda grabbed Stephanie's arm in a hold causing her to scream.
  It was an okay moment but it didn't make up for WWE dropping the ball with the Sting loss.

  Bray Wyatt vs Undertaker: Bray came out with another WM bizarre and kick ass entrance with people dressed like scare crows. Bray should win this won like he should have beat Cena last year. But Vince doesn't know how to make new stars. Which is why Lesnar ended the streak and not an up and coming star. So yeah Bray will lose this one I predict.
  Next to Sting vs Triple H this was the second best match of the night. Undertaker proves he can still go. In a highlight Undertaker reversed a Sister Abrigal with a choke slam. Bray then kicked out of a tombstone. Taker then kicked out of Sister Abrigal.
  Bray then did his creepy spider walk towards Undertaker and Taker sat up to scare the crap out of Bray. Undertaker then revsersed another Sister Abrigal into a tombstone for the win.
  Reigns vs Lesnar (WWE title): The only reason I want Reigns to win is because Lesnar resigned which means his reign where he rarely ever defends could go on. While I rather see someone new as champ over Cena or Orton beating Lesnar.
  Reigns got Lesnar bleeding on the cheek early on. Which just pissed of Lesnar enough that he decided to just torture Reigns after an F5 instead of going for the pin. Lesnar then tossed Reigns all over the ring and destroyed him through-out.
  Just for Roman to smile at Lesnar. Reigns was able to get some kicks on Lesnar against the ropes. But Lesnar just got angry and knocked Roman out of the ring hard. When Reigns returned to the ring; Lesnar hit a suplex knocking Reigns out of the ring. Reigns then returned to the ring for another hard suplex by Brock.
  Reigns then kicked out of an F5. Reigns then taunted Brock on the ground for Brock to respond with some slaps and punches. Just for Reigns to smile. To piss Brock off enough to hit a German suplex and another F5. Reigns then kicked out again.
  Reigns then reversed Brock trying to slam him into the ring post outside and slammed Brock into the ring post. Which busted  Brock up more. Reigns then hit two Superman punches only to stun Lesnar. A third superman punch knocked Lesnar down. But he quickly got up just to get a spear. That didn't knock him down either. A second spear did but be kicked out. Then Lesnar hit the F5.
  However was too tired to get the pin. Rollins then cashed in to make it a triple threat match and hit a curb stomp on Lesnar. Went for another one but Lesnar caught him for an F5 but Brock was hit with a spear by Reigns while holding Rollins.
  Rollins then hit a curb stomp on Reigns to pin him to be the new WWE Champion.
  In closing it wasn't a bad WrestleMania. I just don't see how they thought fans waited years to see Sting wrestle in the WWE for him to lose his first match there. But hey that's typical Vince these days; has no clue what the fans want. The only person who waited years for Sting to be in the WWE just for him to lose to Triple H; is Triple H. That's about it.",1427587200,3,4787,4.2153846153846155

7002892,5,B00T86J0UI,"I think rating something a month before it even happens to be a little silly. But everyone wants to be the first to comment. They want everyone to believe they have ultimate wrestling knowledge. Well to be perfectly honest Brock should not be current champion, and Daniel should be back to tag team status or cruiser weight at best. It's been a silly build up with him from the start. The last time I saw such foolishness was when Ray became champion. The little guys should go back to being servants to the real stars like they were in the past.

Sting vs. HHH would have been an epic match 10 years ago, but I cannot believe they will put on anything more than a 3-star match. Brock vs. Reigns has the potential to be horrible. Roman has no business being in the main event title match at WM...I'm not being a hater, because I like him and I think he will become a superstar, but his ascension has been rushed and shoved in everyone's face. They've done a terrible job building him up and have made a fool of Daniel Bryan (who really should be in this match, honestly) in the process. Bryan was unjustly ""stripped"" of the title and it would have made a great storyline to see him face Brock...David vs. Goliath--the crowd would have gone nuts to see him pin Brock after so many have failed. Reigns will win, and noone will care because noone has reason to care--maybe they would next year, but he simply hasn't been around long enough for anyone to emotionally invest in him. Honestly Ambrose vs. Brock would be a better headliner, but Vince needs his Hulk Hogan/Rock/Cena superhero, and he thinks he's found it in Reigns. This isn't 1987--this isn't even 1995--noone cares about the ""pythons"" and stature of the champion. People want someone they can relate to, and Reigns is NOT the guy. How many people do you know resemble Daniel Bryan compared to Roman Reigns? It's a major disconnect that never seems to be addressed. We've already lost CM Punk, will DB be next? This is going to be a pivotal WM for WWE, and while it always seems like Vince comes out on top, this one is shaping up to be a disappointment.

7002917,4,B00T86J0UI,"Well this was no WrestleMania 17 but it wasn't bad either... some of these matches were really good with a couple being absolutely perfect!

1.  4-Way Tag Match (Tag Titles) - Personally, I've never liked these tornado-style tag matches with a bunch of teams included, and this one is really no different... The New Day & Kidd/Cesaro are my two favorite (and best) teams in this, so glad one of them won!  They had some fairly entertaining spots in this with Kidd/Cesaro ending up retaining the titles!  I'll go (7/10) for this one!

2.  Andre The Giant Battle Royal - FINALLY the Big Show wins a Battle Royal!!!  You'd think as big as he is he'd win the Royal Rumble every year!  I find most Battle Royals boring with too much going on in one ring with too many wrestlers crammed in... but this one wasn't too bad - my favorite part was Sandow finally standing up to the Miz and quitting being his stooge!  That was the stupidest gimmick ever, glad they finally ended it!  Was cheering for Sandow to win but Big Show was too much for him!  (7/10)

3.  Ladder Match - Here we go again with the bookers trying to get everybody on the roster on WM!  This time a ladder match with about 7 or 8 guys participating!  Lots of what goes on in all ladder matches... one guy climbing the ladder and not going all the way up because he's waiting for somebody else to yank him off the ladder!  Daniel Bryan gets the win at the end due to WWE trying to please the fans after they ejected him too early from the Royal Rumble!  Some great spots in this though so I'll go (8/10).

4.  Randy Orton vs. Seth Rollins - Now this is the match of the night in my opinion!!  There is some great, classic stuff going on in this match which was incredible!  Both Rollins (Shawn Michaels, Jr.) and Orton both flowed effortlessly and had PERFECT timing with their moves!!  Noble and Mercury interfering was classic cheating with Orton finally getting rid of them!  And what about that curb-stomp counter with an RKO from Orton to get him the win??  That was priceless!!!  This was the best match I've seen from WWE in a long time!  (10/10)

5.  Triple H vs. Sting - This was a good match but not all it was cracked up to be - Sting had the upper hand, then here came D-X - then Triple H had the upper hand, and here came the NWO!!  They were trying to re-create the Monday Night War with both teams fighting on the outside... finally Triple H won it with a sledgehammer blow counter to the Stinger splash!  (7/10)

6.  The Bellas vs. AJ Lee & Paige - Well the Bellas are looking beautiful as always - but there's not much I can say about this match since I was heart-broken that the Bellas didn't win!  I didn't think AJ did as much as she could have... was this the match she was playing hurt on the outside?  Can't remember...  anyway - Paige/AJ get the win and rob the Bellas out of their Wrestle-Mania moment!  (5/10)

7. Rusev vs. John Cena - Here is another highlight of the evening - and how GORGEOUS does Lana look in her beautiful white outfit!!!  WOW!!!!  She's stealing the show all by herself with that outfit!!!  Anyway - this was a great match - much better than what they did at Extreme Rules - back and forth action with cool spots and bumps!  Hated to see Lana get knocked off the apron, I knew something was gonna go on with her when she threw her shoes in the ring!  Cena finally wins the US title and Rusev doesn't even check on Lana!!!  Terrible manners on his part!!  I think he blamed Lana for losing!  (9/10)

8.  Undertaker vs. Bray Wyatt - Here we go again with Undertaker taking a million years to walk to the ring!!  We all know who's gonna win this one, don't we?  Since they're not gonna have Undertaker losing twice in a row at WM!  This was a good match though... Wyatt reminds me a lot of a young Mick Foley!  No surprise of Undertaker winning but still a good, tough match!  (8/10)

9.  Reigns vs. Brock Lesnar (WWE Title Match) - Wow - who in the world is gonna beat Brock Lesnar??  Certainly not Reigns!!!  He's nowhere near good enough at this stage in his career!  So, we get lots of domination from Lesnar - no surprise there... suplex after suplex... Reigns doesn't go down easily though and Lesnar winds up running into the steal ring post to give Reigns the opening he needs... he does his superman punch and spear... still can't beat Lesnar - then Rollins pops up and cashes in his Money In the Bank briefcase - now he's included in the match and winds up pinning Reigns to win the title!!  I thought this was horrible!!!  Whatever happened to a one-on-one match for the title??  The ending brought down my rating for this match - (6/10).

All in all a good event - some matches were top notch, others were mediocre.  (7/10) overall!!",1439251200,4,4751,4.323496027241771

7002931,3,B00T86J0UI,"This year's WrestleMania has less going for it than last year and the ppv continues to fall from must see to just rent it. This became available on dvd and instant video a month ago (rental just recently) so like many others read the reviews and decided to rent it. The match card seemed interesting.
The first match was the ladder match for the intercontinental title which is fine for those that like those kind of matches. Too many laughable moments such as Bryan and Ziggler headbutt fight on top of ladder. Winner: Daniel Bryan which everyone expected. Match rating- 3/5 and can be skipped.
Orton v. Rollins could very well have been a Raw main event but was saved for this to give it more pop. The mat work was good and the last few minutes really showed Orton is a better wrestler than Rollins. Winner: Orton. Match rating 3.5

Oh my. Now for the Sting v. Triple H segment. First off, the entrance of Triple H has got to be seen to be believed. He comes out as a Terminator with an endorsement from Arnold himself. Okay, that was entertaining but in a WTF way that may have sounded good on paper but came off in a different way. The match itself was okay but clearly Sting's day in sports entertainment is done. Both men were not as they once were and it would have been unlikely this match would have happened anywhere else but at WrestleMania. The interference from DX and Nwo was akin to two aging gangs from rival nursing homes. Good for nostalgic purposes but really good for laughs. Winner: Triple H (by use of hammer) and they shake hands and we all wave goodbye. Match rating 2 because to be honest not much wrestling happened.

Now for the good stuff. The divas tag match had AJ Lee and Paige squaring off against the Bella Twins. The women's matches don't get enough recognition. Paige held her own against both Brie and Nikki when AJ was incapacitated. The wrestling was good and no fake slaps that are often seen on tv. This was a match that could easily been twice as long and would have carried the momentum. Winners: AJ and Paige  Match rating 4/5.
The next match was the real main event, Cena vs. Rusev for the US title. Rusev was the clearly dominant force as always with Cena being the underdog that never gives up (as always). At least Cena tries a new maneuver, a springboard stunner. The only downside was how many times Cena managed to kick out. No way anyone can sell that believably. Having Cena win because he set Rusev up to hit Lana by accident was unworthy. Understand that the match was basically US vs. Russia so no way but Cena to regain the US title but clearly Rusev is the better athlete and would have made fans stunned by retaining the title. Winner: Cena. Match rating 5/5.

The final two matches. Bray Wyatt v. Undertaker. This was only so Taker can retire with a win if he wants to. After last years ending of the streak nothing on the line here. He is showing signs of age no matter what the commentators say of his form. For him to have so much trouble putting the former husky harris away was almost painful to watch. Undertaker needs to retire. Wyatt is hard to take seriously as well. Winner: Undertaker  Match rating 2/5 for not being wrestlemania material.
Brock Lesnar v. Roman Reigns for the WWE World Title. After months of building up Reigns as someone that could beat Lesnar for the title what happens? A squash match that portays Lesnar as an unstoppable Ultraman and Reigns as someone that just laughs when he gets beaten up. Even when Roman manages to rally and hits Brock with multiple super-punches the match seems too staged. Roman Reigns has taken on many opponents and won. Brock Lesnar is not invulnable and any credibility is lost when these type of matches occur. The fact that Seth Rollins cashed in and made it a triple threat only made this main event even more sour. Winner: Rollins / Loser: the fans. Match rating 1/5.

Final note- the 30 minute segment following the US title match has the Rock talking smack to Triple H and Stephanie and getting backup from UFC fighter Roussey. Could not believe it went on and on and on for so long. All told this year's Main Event of wrestling had a lot of hype but the substance wasn't there. Three stars overall and recommend as rental because nothing really to keep here.",1434931200,,4286,4.4884615384615385

I may sound biased but actually being apart of the show makes you feel so intrigued by the matches. Watching it live gives a different experience/perception on the show itself but this year truly brought in an extremely impressive WrestleMania. All of the matches were fun, exciting, enjoyably watchable and provided a lot of shocking surprises and spine-chilling twists and turns. And the confrontation of Ronda Rousey with The Rock and The Authority also produced a crowd reaction of a high-profiled match. The main event was well played, and eventually topped off with an ending the majority of the fans unexpected, but satisfied. The build up prior to WrestleMania 31 wasn't strong, but the event itself makes up for it. It's worth the purchase. And in my opinion, it's one of the best WrestleMania's I've seen completely since X-Seven, X8 or XIX. Nonetheless a great WrestleMania in 31.",1433203200,3,1041,4.988505747126437

Orton vs. Rollins

Really enjoyed this one. Wish they had more time. The ending was incredible.

*** 1/4

Sting vs. Triple H

This match went over 18 minutes and I. Felt. Every. Second. Sting is running on empty so hopefully this is the end of the road for him. There were some run-ins from a lot of fan-favorites soyeah.

**

The Bellas vs. A.J. & Paige

As is the story with any match involving wrestlers who don't have a penis this match barely lasted 7 minutes. Paige played the face in peril. A.J. spent most of the match lying on the outside. The Bellas areThe Bellas. Yet this match was alright. Loved the ending.

**

Rusev vs. Cena

After the surprise upset for Rusev at last months Fastlane Cena was getting one finally shot at the U.S. Champion. Could Mr. Hustle, Loyalty and Respect get the job done? If youve been watching W.W.E. television since 06 (or 07 or 08 or 09 or 10) I think you already know the answer. At least Lana looked nice. Rusev rode in on a tank! A tank! Oh and John used a new move! I guess you can teach an old dog a new trick.

*** 1/2

Steph/Trips/Rock/Ronda Segment

I usually don't mention segments that aren't important to any matches but this deserves a special mention for making me almost rage-quit the show. There was speculation that they were trying to buy time for the sun to set for Wyatt & Taker's entrances. Whatever the reason this dragged on for waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too long. Long talking segments on P.P.V.s. If I never see another one Ill die a happy man.

Bray vs. Taker

Fortunately for Taker he didn't get hurt like last year. Unfortunately his opponent came into this match banged up. Despite this the two were able to have a decent match. Could Taker go one more year? Maybe. Hopefully everything lines up next year for him. Unless it involves Sting. Man would that suck.

***

Reigns vs. Lesnar

Ughh, this match. *puts up flame shield* I understand the story they were trying to tell. The Rising Star vs. The Unstoppable Monster but the way events unfolded left a bad taste in my mouth. Reigns was able to land a few blows here-and-there but this bout was all Lesnar until the spot with the ring post. Things were way too one-sided for my liking. The only thing thats keeping me from giving this match 1-star is...well youll have to see it to believe it.

* 1/2

So that was Wrestlemania. Overall I'd have to give it a ""eh."" The only thing that I thought was terrible was that drawn-out talking segment that's rumored to set up matches that may not happen at next year's 'Mania. I'd say give a look at least.",1433030400,3,2771,4.509018036072145

I also thought that there was a chance the fans might crap all over the show due some booking decisions that the fans didn't agree with.  It was with a sigh of relief when I watched and found that this Mania actually wasn't all that bad.  I didn't feel that it was as good as the previous year's but it did hold its own.  This of course will be a review of the show itself as the DVD or Blu-ray has not came out yet.

First of all let me start by saying that I honestly did not feel that Levi Stadium was the best place to have this Mania simply because of the time difference from the west coast and the east coast (around 3 hours).  Having it daylight for most of the show really took away from the ring entrances of Sting, Undertaker and Bray Wyatt.  I kind of wish they would have went somewhere else for this Mania, but this is just something that I didn't like about the show.  The show itself began with musician Aloe Blacc singing America the Beautiful.  After this we having our standard WM opening with LL Cool J speaking during the footage.

The opening match was the WWE Intercontinental title match to be contested under Ladder match rules.  The people involved were:  Wade Barrett (champ), Daniel Bryan, Stardust, Dolph Ziggler, Luke Harper, R-Truth and Dean Ambrose.  I thought the match was good.  It was a little congested with so many bodies.  I felt the match may have been better as a four way match or so.  I didn't feel that Truth, Stardust or even Harper added all that much to the contest.  Barrett, for being the champ, was almost non existent in the contest.  Ambrose probably took the bump of the night as he was powerbombed over the top rope and smashed through a ladder outside the ring.  Bryan and Ziggler had the best showings and I really hope we can see these two wrestle a one on one match at Mania next year (although with Bryan possibly injured yet again, it might not happen).  The match clocked in at a little over 13:00 and it was good but there was really nothing new here.

Next we get a WWE commerical following by events that led up to the Seth Rollins and Randy Orton match.  The Orton/Rollins match was one that I was looking forward to and I don't think that it disappointed.  These two guys had great chemistry with each other and even though there were points in the contest where it moved a little bit slow, they still delivered.  The ending to the match is probably one of the best finishes I have ever seen and has to be seen to be believed.  Just take a look at the timing needed to perfect this move.  These two guys really put on a great match with it clocking in at a little over 13:00.  This was Orton's 12th straight Mania and he usually doesn't have great matches at the show of shows, but this one was a pretty damn good one.

Next we get another WWE commercial followed by the events that led up to the Sting/Triple H match.  Both men got special entrances with Sting being played to the ring by a Japanese drum corp and Triple H doing a Terminator like entrance to tie into the new Terminator movie that the WWE has been promoting.  The match itself I feel is one of the first bad bookings that WWE did.  I think most people know by now that Sting lost the match and I feel that the WWE made a mistake by doing that.  I don't understand how you can have Sting wrestle at his first Mania and then have him lose!  Triple H didn't gain a whole lot by winning the match (even though the commentators still appeared to believe that the Monday Night Wars was still going on and Triple H had won the war or something).  This is basically Vince McMahon not being able to give a WCW guy a real shot in the WWE, not even someone who is a huge star that Sting is.  We also got to see DX get involved in the match as well as NWO as well.  I love hearing Michael Cole saying that time has been rewound by 15 years.  I take a look at some of those guys that came out and had to laugh.  Take one look at Hogan or Hall and tell me that time has basically stood still for these guys.  The only one who really look all that good was Shawn Michaels.  Anyway, after all that, the match itself was pretty good.  Sting actually could still go and Triple H was absolutely perfect as the heel in this one.  I loved the point in the match where it was sledgehammer vs. baseball bat, because that was classic.  I liked this match and it wasn't too long or too short clocking in at around 18:00 or so.

After that we get another WWE commercial followed by a backstage interview with new IC champ Daniel Bryan.  He is joined by some other former IC champs like Pat Patterson, Roddy Piper, Ricky Steamboat, Ric Flair, Bret Hart and Ron Simmons.  After that we get to see musicians Skylar Gray, Travis Barker and Kid Ink perform in a not so great show.  Then, we get another commercial

This is followed by AJ Lee and Paige taking on Nikki and Brie Bella.  This match was pretty good but I did not agree with AJ lying outside the ring for most of the match.  I don't know if that was planned or she just did it cause she knew she was going to retire soon, but for whatever reason, I felt it took away from the match.  Maybe they did it to allow Paige to shine, I don't know.  This 6:00 match was pretty good but could have been better.

After that match we get yet another WWE commercial followed by a Tale of the Tape with Brock Lesnar and Roman Reigns.  After that we get footage of the Hall of Fame ceremony and then the HOF class of 2015 is introduced.  This year had a few good people in it.  We saw the Bushwackers (really?), Larry Zbyszko (pretty good choice), Rikishi (never a fan), Connor the Crusher going in under the Warrior award (very sad), Alundra Blayze or Madusa (one of the greatest of all time and gave the best speech), Tatsumi Fujinami (kind of a head scratcher), Randy Savage (brother Lanny put him in but we all wish the man himself was there) and Kevin Nash (pretty good choice and still looks pretty good for his age).  After that there is another WWE commercial and the events that led up to the US title match.

The US title match with Rusev and John Cena was pretty good but not as good as I thought it would be.  First of all, let me say that Rusev and Lana had maybe the entrance of the night.  You just have to see it.  The match itself had its moments but was kind of slow and plodding for most of the match.  It was basically just your standard Cena match, nothing new there.  Again, I think the booking was wrong and the wrong guy won this 14:00 match.  The person who won this match didn't need to win so that's why I say the booking was wrong.

After that match we get the announcement that WM XXXII will be held in Dallas, TX next year (I am so looking forward to that).  Then the Kickoff Show panel discusses what we've seen so far.  After that Stephanie McMahon and Triple H come out to gloat and address the crowd.  The Rock comes out to confront them and then he pulls in UFC competitor Ronda Rousey to take out both Triple H and Stephanie (here's hoping for a match at WM 32).  While I did like this segment, I thought it ran too long and took away from the last two matches.  This was something that maybe could have been done at Raw.  After all that we get a Terminator Genesys trailer.

Following that we get to see the Undertaker take on Bray Wyatt in a pretty good match.  There were a lot of people concerned about Taker coming into this match.  How was health?  Can he still go?  What will he look like?  He did a good job, although I do think his time is up and I believe we will see his final match probably at WM 32 in his home state of Texas.  Bray did very well against Taker.  Again, I think the booking was wrong.  I think most people know that Taker won the match and redeemed himself.  I actually would have liked to have seen Taker beat Brock last year and then have Bray win this year to truly become the New Face of Fear.  It could have been like a passing of the torch.  Anyway, Taker did look pretty good but I do hope his last match is around the corner.  This was a good 15:00 match.

After that match we get 2 commercials and then see the events that led up to the main event.  The main event match with Brock Lesnar and Roman Reigns was something that I worried about.  I didn't know how the fans would react to the match and I didn't know if it would be that good.  This match was awesome and was really one of the best main events I have seen in a long time.  Even when the match was turned into a Triple Threat match, as Seth Rollings turned in his MitB briefcase after Reigns and Brock tore each other up, it still didn't take away from the match.  Honestly, I was really enjoying the Brock/Roman match so I was a little angry when Seth came out but I got over it.  As a side note, this is the first time in a long time that I can remember someone bleeding (Brock) on a WWE PPV and those cut guys not stopping the match and work on the person who bled.  This was a great 16:00 match.  Brock looked as good as I had seen him, taking Roman to Suplex City.  Roman, while smiling as he was brutalized, showed me a little bit of who he is, but not much.  I just don't know if he will truly ever be ready to be a world champ.  They may need to re evaluate that decision.  I know Vince is hung up on him but he needs to swallow his pride and maybe knock Roman down to a US champ.  I did hear that Roman's family got so mad when he lost that they almost caused a bad scene backstage after the show.

All in all, this WM was a solid show, even though most of the matches ran on the short side.  It kind of reminded me of the older WM shows where there were more shorter matches.  The Ladder match was great, the Rollins/Orton match was good, Sting really turned it up against Triple H and the Main Event was just fantastic.  The other matches were good but could have used some more work.  I would still say that this is a Mania worth checking out.  I would give this one an 8 out of 10 and it is worth watching!",1429315200,,10189,4.151174668028601
7002962,5,B00T86J0UI,I stopped watching the WWE for years but this event brought my attention back.  This ppv showed the unpredictability of the attitude era all over. So many creative and amusing surprises!  Fast paced all around with incredible entrances. That was true entertainment.,1428278400,3,265,5.285714285714286
7002963,4,B00T86J0UI,"It should be noted that Aloe Black performed ""America The Beautiful"", LL Cool J starred in the opening video, the live performances this year were Skyler Grey & Kid Ink, the traditional showcasing of the Hall Of Fame class, and Triple H & Stephanie McMahon got into a verbal & physical confrontation later in the show with ""Furious 7"""" co-stars The Rock & MMA fighting sensation Rhonda Rousey.

Ladder Match: Intercontinental Champion Bad News Barrett vs. Daniel Bryan vs. Dolph Ziggler vs. R-Truth vs. Dean Ambrose vs. Stardust vs. Luke Harper - You knew the direction this match was going when multiple bodies were flying to the outside in the opening minute that had multiple moments such as the ladder not being the only object used as a weapon, one participant bringing out his own ""special"" ladder, one man channeling the spirit of Terry Funk, bodies falling off the ladder along with one man being put through a ladder on the outside, and one participant knocking out everyone in sight.  This was the car crash you expected that's been missing from Mania since Money In The Bank.

Randy Orton vs. Seth Rollins - Orton started off explosive with uppercuts & clotheslines while Rollins attempted to use J&J Security to his advantage while executing offense such as a suicide dive as they traded momentum with each man countering the other's signature offense along with having similar strategies such as going aerial from either the top rope or a springboard position & both men using their opponents momentum against them along with one of the most memorable RKO's I can ever remember in what was definitely the best ""wrestling"" match of the night.

Sting vs. Triple H - Both men had unique entrances (which I marked out for being a huge fan of the ""Terminator"" series) while it should be noted that this match could only be won by pinfall or submission.  Both men started out having the same idea as far as attempts to take down their opponent before one man was able to get the advantage constantly stopping opponent dead from getting offense before finally being able to take advantage of a mistiming working him over in & outside of the ring before the match evolved into what Michael Cole described as ""The 'Monday Night Wars' have come to WrestleMania"" as you saw guest appearances from the two biggest factions in wrestling during that era along with a battle of ""sledgehammer vs. baseball bat"" in what told a good story as far as being the final battle of WWE vs. WCW and was entertaining for what it was.

A.J. Lee & Paige vs. Bella Twins - This started out as an aggressive cat fight that saw headbutts & an aggressive Alabama Slam as one team had the strategy of making this an unofficial handicap match by constantly knocking the partner off the apron isolating her partner working her over while their opponents used impactful moves including coming off the apron & different variations of DDT's along with taking advantage of the ringside environment in a solid divas match & the best divas match at WrestleMania in recent years.

United States Champion Rusev vs. John Cena - Lana was in Rusev's corner for the first time in weeks while Rusev had quite the entrance as he was dominate early with various kicks & power offense along with even trying to embarrass Cena at one point as he was able to just keep countering & stay in control stopping Cena dead whenever he amounted some amount offense before both men were able to start trading momentum countering each other's power moves & submissions along with each man executing offense that we've never seen from them with it coming down to a strategy that worked in their previous match backfiring on this occasion as it was a solid match but I enjoyed their previous match better.

Undertaker vs. Bray Wyatt - The first appearance of Undertaker since ""The Streak"" ended last year with Taker showcasing his trademark offense from Old School to his apron legdrop before Wyatt used his own body as a weapon along with various strikes to take control as they went back & forth with both men countering & kicking out of each other's offense along with playing mind games with each other as this was the third year in a row where one of the opponents was injured during the match so they did the best they could under the circumstances but still delivered a good match.

WWE Champion Brock Lesnar vs. Roman Reigns - Brock powered Reigns into the corner followed by a suplex & F5 all in the first 30 seconds before he kept working him over with what Brock himself called ""Suplex City B..."" as Brock made it clear he was out to punish Reigns more than beat him such as suplexing him out of the ring only to suplex him back in only for Reigns to be bleeding from the mouth but laughing at the beating he was taking only to keep kicking out & giving back the punishment to the point where Brock was bleeding before it came down to one man taking advantage of the opportunity when it presented itself...just nobody expected WHO it was that took advantage.  This match told a good story of Brock continuing to be the most dominate performer today while showing Reigns being so tough in not only taking a beating but delivering it right back while the ultimate winner showcased he was the smartest & an opportunist.

(Pre-Show) Tag Team Champions Cesaro & Tyson Kidd vs. The Usos vs. Los Matadores vs. The New Day - This was under sudden death rules where the first team to score the fall wins which saw a bunch of different stories & scenarios throughout the entire match such as different teams making blind tags into the match which wouldn't be to the benefit of their opponents, how one participant was taken out of the match in the opening minute, each team having a moment of dominance, various unique double teaming, the different high flying maneuvers & sequences where one man executed offense only to have a move done onto them, and all of the managers on the outside getting involved in the action at some point including the sharpshooter that you have to see to believe in a non-stop action match.

(Pre-Show) Andre The Giant Memorial Battle Royal - The second annual battle royal provided some highlights such as who everyone decided to body surf out the match right at the bell, who was so excited that he almost eliminated himself, the issues Miz had with his assistant...past & present, various points of domination by the strongest men in the match, a rematch from the previous year, and a long overdue victory in this type of match for the victor in your typical battle royal.  As a side note, it should be noted that despite what J.B.L. kept trying to put over during that match that Big Show did win a previous battle royal as he won the second annual WCW World War 3 battle royal in 1996.

Also included is the annual Hall Of Fame ceremony honoring Randy Savage, Kevin Nash, Rikishi, Alundra Blaze/Madusa, The Bushwackers, Larry Zbyszko, Tatsumi Fujinami, celebrity inductee Arnold Schwarzenegger and Warrior Award recipient Connor ""The Crusher"" Michalek.  It's no big secret that the buildup to this years' Mania wasn't as strong as previous years to say the least along with the fact that there were very loud & vocal members of the ""WWE Universe"" who made it clear that they didn't want to see certain superstars in the positions they were in the card but the only thing I didn't like was the musical performances (unless they're singing the wrestlers to the ring, I think it's just a waste of time) as this was a very enjoyable show overall that I would recommend.",1428019200,6,7549,4.669676448457487

Well, maybe the shows themselves are worth it--the last several over the years have always been good, if not ""great."" In any event, another top-notch card, with maybe some debatable spots.

I remember saying years ago that if Sting & Triple H had met during their prime, if would have no doubt been 5 stars. And whether or not Sting should have been put over is debatable as well (I guess), but in the twilight of his career, Sting has done everything, so what would either guy winning would have done. Either way, they are both legends.

Taker returns a year after the epic ""streak"" ends & destroys Bray Wyatt. A better match than maybe I initially expected. Of course, maybe the big event was the ""Main Event,""--Brock taking Roman to Suplex City & Seth shaking up the world by cashing in on the big stage.
