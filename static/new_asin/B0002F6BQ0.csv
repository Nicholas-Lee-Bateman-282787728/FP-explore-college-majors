2089536,5,B0002F6BQ0,I recall seeing Joselito as a kid when we went to the movies at the drive in.  This movie brought back good memories since again the songs are those of Jose Alfredo Jimenez.  Songs about horses are a favorite of Antonio Aguilar's.,1184457600,3,230,4.4523809523809526

8027554,5,B0002F6BQ0,This was an absolutely wonderful film with great acting and singing. I first remembered watching this film when I was a little boy and although it is absolutely in Spanish with no translations available it was superb. I enjoyed it immensely and could because I am fluent in both Spanish and .English. My family learned the songs and loved the dancing horses and Antonio Aguilar and Joselito were  a fantastic cast for this delightful journey to the old Ranchero west of Mexico. Both artist sang wonderfully but the most climatic part of the film for me was when both Antonio Aguilar and Joselito sang La Malaguena absolutely incredible. They were incredible and the dancing horse was a famous trait of Antonio Aguilar because I believe he raised and train these horses himself. This is a family oriented film an absolute must for gente de la Vieja Guardia and something to share with their families.,1420416000,2,899,4.837662337662338
8027555,3,B0002F6BQ0,"I remember seeing this film with my parents in a movie theater when I was a child.  What I DO remember is that this film was in color.  Perhaps the folks that released this film to DVD couldn't get their hands on a color master.  Otherwise it is a Spanish-language, Mexican-made entertaining film with young Spanish singing star Joselito and a some Mexican singer actors.  The story takes place in 19th century Mexico and is about a young heir being taken to his inheritance.  Beautiful singing from the young star.  Recommended for Joselito fans.",1394323200,,547,4.76595744680851

8027558,3,B0002F6BQ0,"I was glad to purchase this product, as I have had it about 20 years go when I taped it from TV one afternoon.  The One that I recorded, was in colour and had subtitles, but someone borrowed the take and it was never returned to me and do not remember who borrowed it from me.  One day I decided to logg onto the internet and find out whether I may be able to get a copy.  I was happy to have found the website in order to purchase a copy. However, I was disapointed, as there are no subtitles and the movie is in black and white.  Whereas, the one I had was in colour and had subtitles (in English.  I would have liked if it stipulated the grade of the movie being purchased.

Thank you",1267315200,2,687,3.978102189781022
8027559,4,B0002F6BQ0,"If  you are a Joselito fan, this is for you. If you don't know, he sings. Beautifully. In Spanish. Like a younger Hispanic Bobby Breen. The film is in Spanish, no subtitles. Not to worry. The plot is basic. You'll have no trouble following along. The other singer is a famous Mexican star. The whole movie is fun, family fare. You don't need to understand the language; just kick back and enjoy this light western flavored fare, apparently filmed in Mexico. Good print, good sound. It's Joselito, for goodness sake!",1252713600,2,515,4.722222222222222
8027560,5,B0002F6BQ0,"A good reminder of the past, now on DVD, for lovers of music and modus operandi of Joselito, I suggest you see it with people over 60 years",1252627200,,139,4.0
