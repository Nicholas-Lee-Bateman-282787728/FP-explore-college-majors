They spent too much time talking about his personal problems while sharing limited info about how he was treated in prison and the whole democracy process that came about, which is the most important part of the story. Surely there is a better one out there. His early life is wonderfully portrayed in the movie ""Cry Freedom"" and hopefully at some point someone will come out with something of equal quality about Mandela's release and the changes that came about in South Africa.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cry-Freedom/dp/0783230532/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cry Freedom</a>",1273536000,,708,6.01980198019802
