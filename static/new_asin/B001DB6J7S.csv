3528188,5,B001DB6J7S,"This is a good quality scary show for kids. My daughter loved it, as she loves most scary shows, however, I was hesitant as some shows can be just a bit too scary, but this one was just right.  The ghosts/bad guys had some funny lines, which lightened up the situations.  The cast of kids did a nice job acting...all in all, I highly recommend for kids 5 and up.",1243814400,,362,4.1571428571428575

3528191,3,B001DB6J7S,"Max Doyle (Sterling Beaumon) is a high school freshmen who is obsessed with magic who discovers his house is haunted.  Max's father (played by Peter DeLuise) is obsessed with sports and tries to get Max interested in athletics, just like his older brother, Colin.  While rehearsing his magic act for a school show, Max discovers he can see a pair of ghosts named Tara (Madison Pettis) and Nicky (Luke Benward).  It seems the brother and sister used to live in the how where Max and his family now live but they have no idea why they are ghosts or what happened to their parents.

But there is a more sinister evil dwelling in the house.  Evil spirits are trapped in a netherworld behind a wall in Max's basement.  Only a powerful entity name Mr. Phears is able to leave the prison.  Phears intends to free himself and all of the spirits on Halloween night.  Max, Nicky, and Tara need to find the spell and the magical ring that will banish the spirits once and for all and save their town.

Mostly Ghostly is based on a series of books by Goosebumps creator R.L. Stine.  The Goosebumps series generally did a good job of presenting horror stories for families and younger viewers that were scary, but not too scary.  Mostly Ghostly will be hard pressed to scare anyone with it's snail's pace story.  Children are likely to become bored before the film is half over.  Stine had a knack for relating to kids and knew the right buttons to push in his stories and the Goosebumps TV show.  Mostly Ghostly is lacking all the qualities that made his books mega-sellers.  The kid characters are weak, the story lacks suspense, and the ending is a feeble attempt at setting up a sequel

The most enjoyable characters are the adults, namely Max's parents and Phears...not good when you are trying to appeal to kids.  Phears and the other spirits are the best part of the film.  The one area where the film does shine is on the make-up work and design of the ghosts.  The one scene that does provides some chills is when max enters the netherworld and while the ghosts cannot see him, they can sense him and he has to run for his life from a terrifying, eyeless entity.

Ali Lohan co-stars as Traci, an older student who agrees to be Max's magic assistant in return for help on her homework.  Most of her screen time is spent flipping her hair from side to side and trying to look pretty.  At only ten years old, Madison Pettis is already an acting veteran, having starred in The Game Plan and in the Disney Channel TV show, Cory in the House.  Clearly though, cute as she is, she is better suited for more comedic roles.

Stine's story isn't bad, it's just that director Richard Correll does nothing interesting with the material and you end up with a very flat film.  Without any special features, Mostly Ghostly is mostly boring.",1233014400,3,2821,4.516765285996056
3528192,5,B001DB6J7S,"Mostly Ghostly is a great way to keep your whole family watching the fun.  If you've read the books by R.L. Stine, you'll like it even more.  A good movie to have on your shelf.",1225584000,,177,4.0285714285714285
3528193,1,B001DB6J7S,"My family and I screened this last last as part of the Wiz-tober Disney Channel presention.  The kids were excited as the trailer looked pretty appealing.  We popped our popcorn and sat in anticipation and ten minutes into this... we realized this was a stinker.

Just about everything is wrong with this film.  Cheap production values, really bad script, bad acting, bad casting, cheesy effects... the only bright spot was the over the top acting by the demon (great make-up)

We were tricked into this so called treat.  But we salvaged the evening with a DVD of Halloween Town.

Watch at your own risk.  Horrible.",1223769600,3,615,4.79047619047619
3528194,5,B001DB6J7S,"Mostly Ghostly is a great halloween movie. The acting is great and the storyline is even better. It is along the lines of goosebumps if you are familiar with that series. Here is a short version of the storyline...A brother (Nicky) and sister (Tara) come back to their old neighborhood just to find out that they are ghosts. They can't find their parents so they go to their old house in search of them only to find a new family lives there. One of the kids that lives at their old house (Max) can see and talk to the Tara and Nicky but Max is the only one. Tara and Nicky are scared because nothing is familiar to them now so they inlists Max's help to find their parents. A quest to find the parents lead the kids into a lot of different trouble...buy the movie to see what happens next.

There are a lot of familar faces in this movie including Madison Pettis (The gameplan), Kim Rhodes and Brian Stepanek (suite life of zack and cody), Ali Lohan (Lindsay's little sister), and Noah Cyrus (Miley's little sister). This is actually a great family halloween movie that the entire family will enjoy. If you are looking for a great family Halloween movie I suggest that you add Mostly Ghostly to your dvd collection.",1223251200,5,1215,4.448430493273543

3528229,1,B001DB6J7S,"This movie should have been presented as a 30 minute episode on Goosebumps. There was a constant repitition of needless scenes. All the while I'm thinking, ""Let's get on with the plot already!"" You could see that this technique was a ""time filler"". My granddaughter and I usually enjoy RL Stine-based productions. NOT THIS ONE!",1354060800,,327,4.963636363636364
3528230,3,B001DB6J7S,"Mostly Ghostly is a direct-to-DVD movie based on the short-lived book series by R.L. Stine, the author of the popular Goosebumps series and Fear Street Series.
The story centers around a 11-year-old named Max, who loves anything to do with magic, which bothers his Dad (played by David DeLuise) who is a major sports fan. Max has a major crush on an older classmate Traci (played by Ali Lohan), but he can never get the nerve to talk to her.

While Max is in his basement he hears voices that lead him to a hidden tunnel to a ghost world, which is only accessed on Halloween. He finds two ghost kids Nicky and Tara (Madison Pettis) who use to live in Max's house. They don't have any memory of who they are or how they died. Max must help them to remember and battle a nasty ghoul ( played by Brian_Stepanek) that is determined to destroy the children.

This is the one book series that I have never read by R.L. Stine, so I have no idea if the movie goes by the book. Mostly Ghostly is not a bit scary, has a low-budget, and a few bad actors like Ali Lohan! Despite being a Universal movie, it felt more like a Disney production because of all the Disney Channel stars that appear in it. I enjoyed the parents the most played by David DeLuise and Kim Rhodes. It's not a horrible movie as I think younger kids will enjoy watching it, but some adults may find it a bit boring.",1346976000,3,1375,4.264367816091954
3528231,3,B001DB6J7S,"Warning! There are ghosts in the basement!!This is one Disney casting galore with bad acting though. The only person who really delivered is Tara(Madison Pettis).Once again like most kids movies I've seen older siblings like to tease/taunt/humiliate their younger siblings and don't forget the bully in school. I've read a lot of reviews and most adults didn't like this movie. First because of lousy acting,second the scary parts are bland,third the storyline is such a muddle,fourth the parents aren't acting like parents,fifth the older brother acts the same age as the younger brother...need I go on?Taking all these aside though,for me,it's one cute movie!",1313712000,,661,5.365384615384615
3528232,5,B001DB6J7S,"This was excellent. I have to admit the reason that made me want to watch this is because it is based on an R.L. Stein book, and I happen to be a fan of his kids horror stories. It thought the casting was great. They where able to use familiar Disney actors without them seeming like there characters from their shows. Luke Benward, Maddison Pettis,David Deluise, Kim Rhodes, they all delivered A+ performances. Let's not forget the main character Max played by a seemingly highly talented stage/movie/TV actor, Sterling Beaumon, I doubt this is the last we'll see of him (his resume is very long, even though he is only 13), he did an excellent job acting his role. This was classic R.L. Stein, from dumb bully brothers, to creepy basement creatures, to creepy children (ghosts), to a creepy ending where you know the bad guy is still out there, but he can't harm anyone any longer. I recommend this to anybody with kids, and to kids who want a good laugh, and maybe some scares. The special effects where top-notch considering it is a made-for-TV-movie.

I understand its a kids movie but young children should be not watching anything scary.  Ghostbumps is geared toward young tweeners and above.
