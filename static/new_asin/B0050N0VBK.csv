4516694,5,B0050N0VBK,"Gritty London underworld crime. Ya gotta love that Northern Irish brogue in this earthy cop from Belfast. The DVD set includes the pilot of ""Murphy's Law"", continuing for years. Episodes are 90-minutes, feature-length cop/mystery/crime story; except for series 4+5 which run 50 min each. Each series has a primary plot that carries throughout with a few main characters. Thriller BBC episodes, action filled, finish with a twist unpredicted. And a number of times you'll belly-laugh at one-liners, usually spit by Murphy when he should have been silent. 5-stars for Brit-Mystery fans.

DS Tommy Murphy (James Nesbitt- ""Bloody Sunday"",""Cold Feet"",""Walking Ned Devine"") undercover cop with a haunting past, a rugged body that gets abuse, a mind a step ahead of people around him (be they the low-life he's undercover to investigate or other coppers), and he's FUNNY. His smart mouth, quick wit with a biting comment at the wrong time, gets him a fist or other injury. When he's close to a romantic moment, his verbal quaffs ice all inspiration.
DI Annie Gutherie (Claudia Harrison) is boss, beautiful, available--except to Murphy--who tries (bless his heart). Beautiful lass.
Carter (Del Synnott), another cop, is a regular as is Father McBride (Mark Benton) an old friend of Murphy's who tries to help, but usually compounds an ordeal. Later, Clarke (Sarah Berger) becomes the leading female cop.

All sets have subtitles, occasionally needed for accents. The Complete Collection has 23 (YES twenty-three) suspense episodes. See episode details in my individual series 1,2,& 3 reviews. Unrated, fights and murder scenes don't spare the blood. NOT kids stuff. You get death, brutal graphic scenes, upper-frontal views, nasty language, maiming, blackmail, smuggling, drugs, nightclubs, robbery, kidnapping, hangings, fighting, plus comedy. Vivid gritty violence.

Series 4+5 is really 2 three-episode miniseries stories and the longer Murphy's Law runs, the nastier the crime. 4+5 filmed in Ireland, 300 min total.
_ _ _Series 4 involves Belfast Brothers Johnston as they saddle up with even more ruthless crime scum in Leicester. One brother plans to marry into the Paki family to access money and team up for a major deal. Murphy goes undercover. a major violent action, nude dancing, and unbelievable bad odds that Murphy can get on the inside, get info, and out again alive. Also Murph is primary caregiver to his Alzheimer's Mom and shows a bit of uncharacteristic softness. Brian McCardie (Lilies) guest stars.
_ _ _Series 5 about sex traffic, porn, Serbian illegals smuggling which goes very bad for Murphy's undercover team. He must try to safely recover colleagues. An ugly situation gets worse & worse. Some naughty language and disturbing violent scenes. Repeat, not for kids or weak of heart. Murphy at his most intense.
Series 1,2 & 3 listings have their own reviews with episode synopsis.

Complete Collection a value!
Amazon price ($35.99 at time of this review) is amazingly low for the Complete 9-disc set this good.

Best line: ""What do you get if you cross an insomniac, an agnostic, & a dyslexic? Someone who's been up all night wondering if there really is a DOG.""",1310256000,15,3182,5.1949317738791425
4516695,5,B0050N0VBK,This was an excellent series- He is awesome in it. Don't understand why they cancelled this show- all the good ones get chopped,1388275200,,127,4.565217391304348
4516696,5,B0050N0VBK,"James Nesbitt never disappoints. I have loved his work, since Waking Ned Devine. Check him out in Monroe, as well.",1385078400,,114,4.75
4516697,5,B0050N0VBK,"This is a great series, but you have to like James Nesbitt.  He's great in this role of an undercover cop from Ireland.  He has a very dry sense of humor.  Some episodes are pretty dark, but for the most part the issues covered are relevant to today.  Sometimes it's hard to understand the accents -- thank goodness for subtitles.",1374624000,3,330,4.45
4516698,3,B0050N0VBK,"James Nesbitt is really under-utilized in this Murphy's Law, even though the series was written for him.  The reviews on the package, like un-nerving and thriller, etc. is really not the truth at all.  It is a average crime drama, but it did not hold my interest, even thought I really like James.  Maybe others will like it, but since seeing his other work, like Jekyll, this is a snoozer.",1365552000,,390,4.542857142857143
4516699,5,B0050N0VBK,"Got to say this up front. Save this for after the kids have gone to bed. Follow Murphy through the slimy underbelly of the drug and human trafficking world.
Don't look for the sanitized CSI version of crime.  No bang your dead clean bodies, things don't always work out for the best in the end, and the hookers and strippers don't wear bikinis.
Good series to follow through to the end, but I must say again. Don't leave these DVDs out for the kids.",1360454400,2,449,4.345238095238095
4516700,5,B0050N0VBK,"I bought these sets separately - not the ""complete collection"" so the review is for the show as a whole, rather than this specific disc set.

This is by far one of the best, if not THE BEST foreign crime shows I have ever seen.  I have watched Many foreign crime/mystery shows and love some, like some, and others I could live without. This one, I was heartbroken when it was over - not because of the ending or the content, solely because I'm going to miss Murphy, the storylines, the feel of the show, everything about it is absolutely unique and wonderful.  When people say ""gritty"" it makes a red flag go up that says ""extremely, unnecessarily vulgar"" - but this show is GRITTY in the real sense of the word-it is not meant in the sense of the most recent use of it in the entertainment industry (in America)-which is usually Vulgar in a way that has nothing to do with the story or creating a scene or having anything to do with the actual content of the show. Vulgar for the sake of being vulgar is not GRITTY.

This show is so wonderful and mesmerizing and has you on the edge of your seat when watching, that you don't notice what would be acceptable only on HBO, as far as drugs, sex, and violence goes. Everything is true to the story and never seems like it is overboard or done solely for reaction purposes.  It is gritty in the true sense of the word, and the drama and mystery and crime - SUSPENSE is more like it, is so wonderful, its like a movie that keeps going on and on...until its over and you can't believe there's no more Murphy episodes :-( I was actually a little sad.  A week or so later I wanted to watch a show, felt like it was a certain mood, couldn't put my finger on it - ""what is that show?"" Then I realized the show I was so anxious to sit down and watch the next episode was Murphy's law and I had finished the series a week ago.

It was that good. I will be endlessly searching for another show that can give such a strong ""mood"" of suspense that is so believable but I can't imagine I will find one.  LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!",1339459200,4,2062,4.163316582914573
4516701,5,B0050N0VBK,"SUBTITLED!!  This tv series is the epitome of British crime dramas.  Wonderfully written and acted, with a great dose of sarcasm and quirky sense of humor.  I watched this series years ago and was just waiting for it be released with subtitles, as some of the accents are a little hard to fully understand.  Order this series and prepared to be entertained!",1334275200,4,357,4.709677419354839
4516702,5,B0050N0VBK,"Occasionally, an actor steps into a character who becomes indelibly memorable: Jeremy Brett as Holmes, John Thaw as Morse, Sir Derek as Cadfael, Dame Helen as Jane Tennison as examples. I believe James Nesbitt's Tommy Murphy deserves membership in that club. Although I have only watched most of the first two seasons, I am quite impressed with this series.

Murphy was a cop in Ireland who witnessed the killing of his daughter in a hostage situation. The scars of the experience drove him from his marriage, job, and country. He relocated to England, where he resumes his roll as a policeman, but is often called ""Paddy,"" with a sneer.

Murphy investigates all sorts of crime, often under cover. His wits and his wit are impressive. Its different in a good way, although often bleak and unsweetened.

I recommend it, especially to Anglophiles, and by the way, it has subtitles.",1319155200,13,879,4.885906040268456
4516703,3,B0050N0VBK,rough harsh words nuity not my cup of tea. It's life on the seedy side always not we want for entertainment if so we can just take a ride to anywhere USA,1315094400,2,153,3.8125
4516704,4,B0050N0VBK,"We have watched the first three seasons of Murphy's Law. It's quite good in all categories, but we do miss the light touch of season one, and its humor. And Annie. It is more difficult to do that than it is to do dark crime dramas, and the addictive patter is now gone. It used to be quite brilliant, the way Murphy spoke. Now (by Season 3) he's just a tough guy.

Still, very very good, and we'll probably get seasons 4 and 5 when we see them.",1312156800,5,444,4.045454545454546
8451522,4,B0050N0VBK,"I jumped into this mainly from reading some of the reviews, and after watching the first two seasons, felt as if I had found a goldmine (and here, I'm going to assume that you've read a few of the reviews to know that this series is about a wise-cracking Irish undercover cop, one with a shaky past that hasn't quite gone away).  The writing was crisp, the lines sputtering out funny Irish one-liners, the drinking non-stop.  This was lending a good name to the name Murphy.  But the reviews pretty much said to be careful, to not get too used to the light-hearted style, that the series would soon change to a darker side (supposedly at the insistence of the lead actor, James Nesbitt,) which did happen at the start of Season 3.  But now, after finishing the series, I emerged feeling quite opposite of what many of them had predicted.  The darker side, minus the humor, suited his character much better.  Nesbitt seemed to dive into the new, straight-ahead no b.s. role full-on, his portrayal as an undercover cop showing his raging temper when his backup crew lets him down (""It my life on the line,"" he yells, and you certainly believe him).  The ability to still use his wit to infiltrate the various gangs and seedy enterprises is all quite believable, the writers and Nesbitt doing a convincing job now that much of the fluff (such as a love interest or his ex) has been pushed aside.  He's still the goofball playboy, still the risk-taker, but now he's a bit more of a loose cannon, something the ""department"" recognizes and thus gives him wide berth (only because he usually gets the job done).  His morals are good, his values strong, even if his methods push the limits.  And yes, there are more than a few unbelievable sequences where you wonder how come the crooks never check his mobile phone (which rings directly to the station), or notice him making discreet calls.  He can talk his way out of a paper bag, to be sure, but sometimes you wonder if the writers simply decided that the viewers wouldn't notice (but the viewers DO notice).  Still, a terrific series...if you want the humor, the recaps, the shorter stories, then go with the first 2 seasons.  After that, the stories are 3 parts to a disc, so be ready to budget the nearly 3 hours it'll take to finish one story line.  Better than most movies out there...check it out.",1429228800,2,2348,4.572792362768497
8451523,5,B0050N0VBK,"Enjoyed this when it aired on the Beeb 2001-7 and it was equally entertaining this time on dvd.  In this series as in the Hobbit films, Nesbitt seems tailor-made to play a bit of rough.  His constantly undercover role provides a different slant to a crime drama.  The six one hour episodes in the first three series allows good story development that held my interest throughout.  The final series five was disappointing.  There was more than enough action with expected violence, language, etc;  at times, Murphy's stamina pushed the boundaries.  This is one of the better ones.",1426377600,,579,4.907216494845361

8451525,2,B0050N0VBK,This is a terrible series.  Don't think it is British because you will be disappointed.,1421798400,,87,4.8
8451526,1,B0050N0VBK,"After having seen action movies with the likes of Jason Statham in ""The Transporter"" series, Liam Neeson in the ""Taken"" series, Guy Pearce as ""Jack Irish"" and Ian Glen as ""Jack Taylor"", as a his-own-man character, ""Murphy's Law""'s leading man pales in comparison. The first disc of this collection was so infinitely boring, I could not bring myself to go any further.",1420588800,,367,4.935483870967742

8451531,4,B0050N0VBK,"James Nesbitt is one of the most dynamic actors Ive seen in a long time.  His show, MURPHYS LAW, ran for five series, before being scheduled opposite Doc Martin. The gritty drama couldn't compete with the sunny comedy and was summarily cancelled. Such a shame.

This wonderful box set from Acorn Media brings the complete set of MURHPYS LAW together so that the viewer can watch, thoroughly involved in the drama and wondering how on earth a show this good could come to an end?

Actually the answer is found in the way the series developed.

Series One of MURPHYS LAW was lighter in tone, with Murphy being a witty Paddy (Irishman) working in England as an undercover cop. Though not without his stress and angst, the show was highly watchable because of Nesbitts brilliant presence and the finely-tuned pitch between drama and comedy.

Then Series Two came along and, despite striking a few sour notes, found a more intriguing, darker tone. Murphy was more intense, brooding and dangerous. Nesbitt grew an intimidating-looking moustache and worked out with a trainer to become a lean, mean fightin machine. The visual difference in the actor between the two series is absolutely striking.

By Series Three, the writing caught up with the actor. Although there were things I didn't like (a great deal more foul language, for example), Nesbitt had me hooked.

(The first three series were all released individually by Acorn Media. The decision to complete the release of the series as a box set might be a little annoying to some, but viewers just wanting Series Four and Five rather than the box set can purchase them separately.)

Series Four is brilliant. Utterly captivating, edge-of-your-seat kind of stuff. Murphy is even darker and the stakes are higher.  I could hardly wait for Series Five

And then, it imploded. The combination of being scheduled opposite the delightful, hilarious Doc Martin, and descending into nihilistic, unrelenting hell in the storyline of Series Five just gets to be too much. There is insufficient payoff for this series and despite the sheer brilliance of Nesbitts work, MURPHYS LAW just goes too far at times.

It is one heck of a ride, but I was willing to see this thing through. In the end I felt like someone spit in my face. Theres a difference between hard-hitting drama and taking cheap shots. Perhaps that is a reminder that ultimately, audiences want to be entertained.

MURPHYS LAW is a nail-biter, to be sure, but you probably will appreciate it more if you stop watching after Series Four. James Nesbitt is one of the most dynamic actors Ive seen in a long time.
