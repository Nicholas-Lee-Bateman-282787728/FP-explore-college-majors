8392863,1,B003A7SW4G,all the write ups and the cast made this film sound amazing. i am sure it is an amazing film...but whoever did the subtitles ruined any chance of me knowing. They are so hit and miss that its impossible to make sense of them and there is so much dialogue and no subtitles to translate it that you know you are missing parts of the story. Also the gaps between the subtitles mean that by the time you get the next one you forgot what the previous one said so you lose any tiny gist of the conversation you may have had.
