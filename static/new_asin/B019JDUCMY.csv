All the drama, melodrama, and comedy of life in the USSR and life in a front-line combat unit in WW II which makes a war series successful. Ranks with M*A*S*H and China Beach and Foyle's War as absorbing, binge-worthy military epics! The special effects are noteworthy!",1524960000,,319,4.818181818181818
