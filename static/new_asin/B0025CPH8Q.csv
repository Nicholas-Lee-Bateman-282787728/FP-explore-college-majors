High resolution (minimally, 96KHz sampling rate and 24-bit word length) was expected to experience ""Acoustic Reality"" but disappointed. If high resolution sound quality is sought for, go for new recordings. Remastered won't do.",1255737600,,337,5.8979591836734695
8473642,3,B0025CPH8Q,"After much anticipation, I purchased this collection.  Unfortunately, I found it would not play at all on my Samsung BD-P1600 player.  My Sony BD-S350 played the disks, but not in the DTS Master-HD format.  After much difficulty, I finally contacted someone at Surround Records (via email - they have no website).  I was told that the disk format (AVCHD - the same format used by HD videocams) - would not play on low-profile players such as those mentioned above.  The rep told me that full-size players, including the PS3, had no problems with the disks.  Amazon.com was kind enough to allow me to return the collection for full credit.  I can only wish that either Surround Records or Amazon (or both) had included a warning in all ads for this collection.",1250121600,2,759,4.748091603053435
