My granddaughter used to just love the monkeydoos and it would litteraly stop her from crying or fussing at any time.  I looked for the monkeydoos everywhere but could not find a DVD at any store.  I finally found one here on Amazon, and we all are very pleased.  She is now over 1 year old and still watches it.
If you have a little one I recommed this DVD it lets your child interact with music, sounds, with active movement, and it is not irritating like alot of kids video's.
Sincerely
Caryn ( 1st time grandma)",1296604800,,683,4.183206106870229

I like the fact that she's not just watching a show.  She requests this often and will watch it as many times as I allow her to!",1249948800,,270,4.254901960784314

8311316,5,B001IQKNP2,"This set of 2 DVDs of Monkeydoos is incredibly priced (bought it NEW for $3.99) and my kids (ages 4 & 6) love them!
1. These DVDs are very enjoyable and my kids dance and sing following the screen. I often hear they laugh with joy as they sing and stomp! My 4 year daughter watches it everyday!!
2. This set of 2 DVDs does not come with plastic cases, but they do come with hard-paper sleeves. This is the reason why it is so cheap and bargain. But DVDs are excellent quality and not bootlegged (illegal) copies.
3. NOTE: if you are looking for ""Monkeydoos: Gallop, Hop and Stomp"" remember that it is renamed as ""Monkeydoos: Go, Go Animals!"" So in short: ""Gallop, Hop and Stomp"" = ""Go, Go Animals!""

Overall, it is fun and enjoyable for the kids! And with this set of 2 DVDs is a bargain. Highly recommended!",1245369600,,808,4.315789473684211
8311317,4,B001IQKNP2,"We have both of these videos.  I think they are very good for the developing child.  They have repetitive movements throughout the whole song so it gives the child a chance to understand what they're supposed to be doing and do it.  The movements are also not very hard to do.  Our little boy loves watching them, but as of yet he won't ""exercise"" along with the video.  However, throughout the day you'll find him doing some of the ""exercises"" so I think it's worth it.  Some of the songs are repetitive and may be annoying to adults, but repetition is good for little kids, and pretty soon they'll even be singing along!  The only thing that could be improved on is making some of the songs a little more upbeat.",1239840000,,714,4.404580152671755
