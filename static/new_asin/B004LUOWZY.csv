4405079,4,B004LUOWZY,"... is required to swallow the plot, however the viewer is rewarded for doing so by watching Jean Simmons as a Cinderella-like ex-mental patient, complete with a wicked stepmother and stepsister, who steal her house and her husband! (Dan O'Herlihy in a wonderfully caddish performance). Efrem Zimbalist is the dishy Jewish outsider who befriends Jean, and helps her see through the confusion in her mind's eye. The art direction is effective, creating a stark, cold, wintry, New England college town. When Jean ditches the blonde wig for her real brunette tresses we feel as if she washed her emotional trauma from her head.

This film is  an old favorite of mine and has been unavailable until recently. Even TCM has it scheduled for an airing this month! Fortunately folks can see one of Jean Simmons' strong performances again.",1302134400,19,830,5.007246376811594

4405087,3,B004LUOWZY,"In HOME BEFORE DARK, Jean Simmons brilliantly plays a victim of both mental illness and family scapegoating. The movie takes a long, long time for this drama to play out, but the black-and-white photography and wintry setting enhance the dark mood of the picture. Unfortunately, the music--a mixture of cues from previous film scores--underscores the artifice. One cue underscoring the protagonist's climactic ""insanity"" is repeated to the point of tedium, where it sounds like cheap melodrama. The resolution of this movie is more fun than most of the picture, but I've found the movie as a whole hard to sit through. I recommend it with reservations: If you're a Jean Simmons fan, if you enjoy long domestic dramas like this, and if you don't pay any attention to music underscoring when you're watching a movie, HOME BEFORE DARK may be just right for you.",1444003200,,858,4.965277777777778

4405092,1,B004LUOWZY,"The movie was terrific.  My low score ranking is based solely on the quality of the copy I was sent.  This was promoted and billed as a new copy, but it froze/skipped numerous times throughout the screening.  This very negatively impacted the viewing experience.  I am incredibly disappointed with this Amazon purchase.  (Reference Note:  I have played other DVDs since the Home Before Dark screening, and they ran without any freeze/skip issues.  I wanted to make certain it was not a DVD player issue, as opposed to a specific disk issue.)",1420848000,,541,4.8791208791208796

4405094,4,B004LUOWZY,"As 50's movies go, this one holds up quite well...!.  Good, somewhat sophisticated storyline, strong acting, and an overall a ""darker"" and more original older movie.  It's a good story, but also poses a unique ""chicken-or-the-egg"" type question when it comes to one suffering from a mental or emotional breakdown.",1418428800,,313,5.24
4405095,5,B004LUOWZY,"I loved Jean Simmons in this role.  She never got the notariety of other actresses of her time, but she is just as great.  Sunrae",1418083200,,129,4.12
4405096,5,B004LUOWZY,"Caveat:  one needs to be in an upbeat mood when  seeing  this.  I had seen this as a rerun almost two decades ago and waited patiently for it to come out in VHS and later DVD.  It is so engrossing that I watched it again on TMC last night.  I won't comment on the plot, but I did notice that my attitude about Simmons' character has gone through some development itself as I have watched the movie over a two-three year period.  This is nothing against Marblehead, where many of the outdoor shots were made, but the ice, snow,  sleet, and dark, cloudy tones shot in black and white and narrow streets along with the beautiful, but prim and proper seeming houses give one a sense of claustrophobia quite appropriate for the plot.  Even the interior of the ""colonial"" antique-furnished house seems cold in spite of a fire in the fireplace.  There is no ""Christmas Ideals"" feeling anywhere. Color film would have ruined this.  Even the filming technique used for Boston at Christmas appropriately makes for a forbidding atmosphere contrasted with Christmas songs, decorations, and good cheer inside and out--a sensitively-deleniated  contrast to what Simmons' character, Charlotte, is going through.  Added to this are all the rather proper, stuffy Ivy league faculty types in a town that seems to show Charlotte no sympathy, although we must remember we see all of this through her eyes (this was also in the more conventional 50s).  In addition to the movie, I highly recommend the novel (I obtained mine through a used book service) because we have Profesor Bronn shown in a more dimensional light and understand, even if we don't approve of,  his neglecting his wife.",1417564800,3,1668,4.823943661971831
4405097,3,B004LUOWZY,"A rather depressing movie. It's just as much about a bad marriage as it is about mental illness. How many minutes of watching a bad marriage do you need to see before it gets depressing? Especially when there is no end in sight. The end provides some resolution, but we had to wait so long for it, and even then it's hardly satisfying. If you like sad movies, you might like this one.

Jean Simmons plays her part well, but her voice is so similar to Audrey Hepburn's, it threw me off from start to finish. Very distracting. I kept hearing Audrey Hepburn while watching Jean Simmons. (I never had this problem with another flick.)

Cold relationships can make great movies - Gilda being the obvious example. But ice-cold, deep freeze, as in the North or South Pole, well, that's another story. If you saw The Duchess (2008), and recall what Keira Knightley's character had to go through, that's the kind of frozen, viciously bitter relationship we're talking about.

No doubt Simmons was the lead here, but she really hogs the microphone. It gets a bit tiresome by the end to hear her speaking non-stop.

The subtitle of this movie could be: The Marital Abuse of Emotional Neglect.

I saw Jean Simmons in Home Before Dark about a week after seeing Tippi Hedren in Marnie. They both are about women dealing with mental issues. I prefer Hitchcock's work.",1417478400,,1352,4.663865546218488

4405101,5,B004LUOWZY,I had remembered this gem from years ago when it first came out.  I had quite a time finding a copy until one day here it was on amazon.com finally in DVD.  Jean Simmons shines as a woman who has spent some time recovering from a break down in a mental institution who returns to the same problem centered environment.  And the turn of events which follow are subtley surprising and soul satisfying.  Am glad I ventured a second look.,1402358400,,434,4.3875
4405102,5,B004LUOWZY,"This is one of my favorite older movies, and when I saw it was available, I ordered right away.  Also, some of the scenes are shot on location where I now live which makes it even more appealing.  The story line, though from the 1950's, still rings true today regarding individuals who have spent time in mental hospitals.  A great film; I highly recommend.",1395705600,3,357,4.546875
4405103,5,B004LUOWZY,I am a huge fan of movies made back in the 1940s and Jean Simmons is one of my favorite actresses. The movie touches on mental illness and the effects that families can have on victims of mental illness. It's a subject that should be studied at the clinical level that families can be the worst thing for the patient in question. Patients can be used as scapegoats being blamed for all the ills that are in a family. Good movie.,1390953600,4,428,4.296296296296297

4405110,5,B004LUOWZY,"Although it is dated of course, the story is riveting.  Jean Simmons created memorable characters and this one is one of her best.  Underrated performance in a very rare film to find, but well worth the search and the viewing.",1365724800,2,226,4.625
4405111,5,B004LUOWZY,The remaster  of Home Before Dark was sharp and clear. Brought back the memories of the time I had read the book and seen the original movie. Glad to have it to see again .,1364947200,,172,3.914285714285714
4405112,5,B004LUOWZY,"Hollywood just occasionally produces movies attempting to depict sufferers of mental illness responsibly (at the same time hoping not to drive audiences away). Notable examples which did reasonable business at the Box Office were ""The Snake Pit"" (1947), then later, ""Splendour in the Grass"", ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""Girl, Interrupted"" (which brought Angelina Jolie to the notice of critics).
""Home Before Dark"" (1958) did poorly in comparison. A pity, for this Mervyn LeRoy directed drama in authentic-looking New England settings was for my money the most searching and engrossing of all. LeRoy earlier had effectively directed Ronald Colman as a shell-shocked WWI veteran in his classic ""Random Harvest"" (1942) and does so with his leading lady Jean Simmons, then not aged 30. Maybe LeRoy had a young Joan Crawford in mind for the demanding central role. Simmons, so often undervalued and cast as ""decoration"" gratefully seizes it, at last having a script to get her teeth into.
She plays a relegated-to-the-background neglected wife of a cold, spineless faculty professor (well portrayed by Dan O'Herlihy) who meantime has his eye roving towards more outgoing sultry and complicit Rhonda Fleming. Simmons has a breakdown and, after a spell in a  mental hospital returns, to this stifling environment, with a disdainful ma-in-law as a particularly alarming occupant.
From then on the drama depicts her as a lonely isolated soul hanging on to sanity by her fingernails. One could well imagine Crawford in this role in the 1940's, yet Simmons makes it all her own. Extra uncertainty and tension abounds in the vulnerability she brings to the part, such as when she bursts in on a very public party, tipsy, in a dress too big for her. The situation is not entirely hopeless; we see her grow from mousy pathetically subservient housewife into an angry, independent woman grasping fate in her own hands.
If you are not a Simmons fan I daresay it will seem a talky slog to some. To me this is an assured movie which has the time-honoured Hollywood virtue of keeping its points neatly contained (unlike, say ""Suddenly Last Summer"" of the following year, a rather repellent all-star overblown film about typically nutty Tennessee Williams folk), a rare worthy vehicle for the leading lady.
Just why Simmons wasn't even nominated at the Oscars for her awesome performance is beyond me.",1362182400,11,2393,5.089058524173028
4405113,5,B004LUOWZY,"I saw this movie on tcm last month and had to get it. It is a bit like ""Gaslight"" but in my opinion better. I thought the director did a great job with the scenery and setting the tone. Like others, I thought it was expensive ( I paid 20) for a  classic movie. Plus the remastered copy was nothing special and had no extras whatso ever. That was disappointing since I was looking forward to learning more about the movie. Tmc at least gives a little history of the film. But if you love good classical movies, this one is a must see.",1361750400,,533,4.125
4405114,5,B004LUOWZY,"This is my favorite Jean Simmons movie.  No matter how many times I have seen it, I still can't wait to see the end when she finally realizes that she has the strength and courage to walk out on that no good family.",1360281600,3,215,4.0
4405115,5,B004LUOWZY,This is one of my favorite films that features an absolutely wonderful performance by Jean Simmons. Not only was she one of the most beautiful women ever to be on the screen she was also one of the best actresses. This movie is really well done with a terrific supporting cast. Not to be missed. After seeing it I always wonder why she wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this.,1359590400,4,375,4.371428571428571
4405116,5,B004LUOWZY,"This is one of the all-time great tearjerkers that also contains an Academy Award-worthy performance.  Sadly, some reviewers find it is less compelling than Olivia de Havilland's performance in ""The Snake Pit.""  However, I feel Simmons' more subtle performance, especially after she returns home after a nervous breakdown, is the more difficult challenge for an actor.  In fact, several of her finest roles (also think ""Spartacus"") are underappreciated.
The entire cast of ""Home Before Dark"" make it a must-see for viewers interested in subtle factors involved in difficult family interactions --who actually is disturbed and who is victimizing whom??",1352764800,5,651,5.555555555555555
4405117,5,B004LUOWZY,"Wonderful movie.  I became so interested in it after several viewings of this Warner Archives MOD dvd, that I came back to Amazon.com and ordered the novel upon which it is based.  I look forward to comparing the film and source.

Director Mervyn LeRoy once again demonstrates his ability to draw very deep and human performances from actresses (he also directed Vivien Leigh to perfection in Waterloo Bridge and Patty MacCormack as The Bad Seed) and in an interesting approach, LeRoy weaves intriguing nuances from Warner Bros. smash hit for Bette Davis, the classic Now, Voyager into Home Before Dark.  Some of the similarities in the two films:  As in NV, the heroine in Home Before Dark (Jean Simmons) is an inward, reserved girl dominated by the women in her home; both heroines are named ""Charlotte""; both have a relationship with a man who cannot---or will not---be intimate with them; each find themselves attracted to a man who is not from their insular world; both are institutionalized; furthermore, LeRoy  incorporates segments of Max Steiner's memorable and haunting score from the earlier film.

I mention the parallels because fans of Now, Voyager may also find in this movie a very sympathetic and touching portrait of a troubled woman finding her way ""home"" out of the ""dark"" of mental illness.",1342396800,5,1311,4.986238532110092
4405118,4,B004LUOWZY,"Here we have yet another overpriced WB Archive Collection DVD-R.  As is usually the case with these, there are NO extras whatsoever.  And I'm not so sure about the supposed remastering job on this one.  While the overall quality is good, it is certainly nothing to get excited about.  The audio is fine, but the video is a bit grainy and there are still quite a few white specks that pop up throughout the film.  However, as other reviewers have noted, the movie itself is quite enjoyable.",1329523200,,489,4.574712643678161
4405119,5,B004LUOWZY,"I think that the other reviews are spot-on as far as the plot and cast performances are rated so I won't dwell on rehashing their fine critiques... However, I would like to add some back story info about this fine film:
  My hometown is Marblehead, Massachusetts and Warner Brothers filmed most of the movie there. I vividly remember watching Warner Brothers Jeeps whipping about all over town, setting up location shots and what not... There is a scene in the film when Ms. Simmons boards a Boston & Maine Railroad ""Buddliner"" at the ""Cape Marble"" railroad station, as she starts a trip to Boston. I and my friends were at the station to watch the filming of the scene (which took about 13 takes, because we kept wandering into camera range as the train pulled out of the station) and somewhere there is some film footage of the Director yelling, ""Would you PLEASE get those damn kids out of the shot!""
  The station, tracks and right-of-way have been gone now for 40 years, but I can picture the filming as if it happened yesterday. On a personal note, my Dad had a few cocktails with Ephram Zimbalist Jr. one evening at the ""Molly Waldo"", a popular Marblehead restaurant in the 50's and 60's.
  I acquired a copy of ""Home Before Dark"" about 4 years ago through a California based ""Film Finder""... I am thrilled to see it offered by Amazon, as I'm pretty sure the film was never released on VHS/DVD before this, and I've never seen it on any Cable channel or TV broadcast.
  So... Not only do you get great performances by the actors and a truly gripping plot line: You also get to see the beauty of my Hometown, Marblehead as it was in the 50's. Please give the film a look... You won't be sorry!",1313366400,14,1699,4.475728155339806
4405120,5,B004LUOWZY,Jean Simmons is one of my top 10 actresses of all time.  This is a really good movie.  I highly recommend it.,1313107200,2,109,3.909090909090909
4405121,5,B004LUOWZY,"Charlotte Bronn (Jean Simmons), the wife of a college professor (Dan O'Herlihy), has been released from a State Mental Hospital only to return to the same environment that led to her breakdown. Adapted by Robert and Eileen Bassing from Eileen's novel of the same name and nominated for a Golden Globe in three categories, Mervyn LeRoy's 1958 masterpiece Home Before Dark is a devastating yet remarkably liberating exploration of a woman's struggle to achieve mental health.

I first saw this film many years ago and I never forgot the towering performance of Jean Simmons or the film's shattering emotional truth -- that some people are simply incapable of showing compassion to those who are vulnerable.

The film is set in an upwardly mobile neighborhood in suburban Massachusetts. Charlotte has long suspected that her husband, Arnold Bronn, was secretly in love with her stepsister Joan Carlisle (Rhonda Fleming). But is unable to confront the fact that her husband does not love her, and slips into mental illness.

After one year in treatment, she is released but goes back to face the same nagging suspicions and the same well-meaning but overbearing people including her sister Joan, stepmother Inez Winthrop (Mabel Albertson), and housekeeper Mattie (Kathryn Card). Charlotte does have some support, however, in the person of Jacob Diamond (Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.), a visiting professor that is living with the family for one semester and has to confront anti-Semitic innuendoes at the college.

Diamond reaches out to Charlotte and provides some much-needed kindness but she has difficulty gathering the emotional strength to accept his support. She continues to blame herself for her illness and clings to the notion that her previous suspicions were delusions. Still unsteady and trying to please everybody, she buys a dress that doesn't fit and has her hair done to look like her stepsister Joan, then shows up at a dinner party out of control.

Little by little, however, Charlotte begins to muster the strength to confront the truth and the film delivers its message without having to resort to the intervention of a hero-psychiatrist who makes everything right. Charlotte's growth is achieved through her own personal transformation and the payoff is deliciously worth the 136-minute length of the film.",1302393600,41,2317,5.234501347708895

8434888,3,B004LUOWZY,"Warner Archives did a great transfer of this movie---not a restoration, but the audio and video are more than adequate to enjoy the movie. But personally, I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I thought I would. Given the premise of a mental patient returning home after a year in a hospital to the very situation that caused her breakdown, and having Jean Simmons as that patient (she's a terrific actress), and with a great supporting cast (including Rhonda Fleming and Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.), I was expecting much more. I love film noir, suspense and gothic tales, but this movie didn't register as great in any of those three sub-genres. The movie was flat and dull with a lot of talk ... until Charlotte's entrance at the Boston restaurant decked out as her step-sister. That was the scene that finally drew me into the movie ... an hour and 45 minutes into it! I'm surprised I stuck it out that long. This could have been a great movie, but maybe the director (Mervyn LeRoy) had other things on his mind. As I watched ""Home Before Dark,"" I couldn't help but think about one of the greatest movies of all time, ""Now, Voyager"" as both leads are women named Charlotte who live in or near Boston and have been in psychiatric care. In fact, a trivia item on IMDB for this movie says that the soundtrack of Voyager was used for this movie. Maybe Warners was trying to rekindle the greatness of ""Now Voyager."" ...
