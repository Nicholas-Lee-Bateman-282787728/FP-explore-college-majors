6251730,1,B00I6JOD8M,"Whats it about?

In an early 1900s version of New York City that isn't the real one (although it will take a flying horse for viewers to work that out), a common thief falls in love with a dying heiress and clashes with a Russell Crowe-shaped demon.

What did I think?

Its astounding how a movie can be both overwritten and under-explained. Demons! Angel horses that are really spirit dogs! Everyone has a magic miracle inside them! Love someone so hard they can never die! Time travel! Stars are people too! Will Smith is the Devil and even though its 1916 he wears a modern blazer and a T-shirt! Wait, what? Exactly.

I tried really hard to get swept up with the romance and magic, but much like the dying protagonist I was left cold. If there is a miracle inside everyone, I wish I could use mine to get my two hours back.",1401667200,19,826,4.3441558441558445
6251731,5,B00I6JOD8M,"I'm not sure why this movie did so poorly in theaters -- bad release timing? critics who came in expecting one thing and got another? -- but it's far more enjoyable than Rotten Tomatoes might lead one to believe. It was hyped as a romance, which it is, but it's more about the power of love in general across generations and how we don't always get the miracles we want, but we sometimes get miracles nonetheless. The performances are moving and the visuals are beautiful. As is so often the case, it's not the book, but it has merits of its own.",1401580800,190,546,4.362745098039215
6251732,5,B00I6JOD8M,"Winter's Tale - a truly magical, uplifting, emotional piece of art.

The directing is wonderfully done accompanied with a musical score which makes it special and really shine all throughout the movie.

Script is full of metaphors, symbolism with huge amount of detail and depth in it, thought-provoking ideas, it is beautiful and unique, which is quite rare in films nowdays.

There is plenty to see for the mainstream audience, as well as people who have different perspective, so it works on both levels, which really surprised me.

The acting is a strong part and everyone did a great job to portray interesting and multi-layered characters, especially the chemistry between Colin Farrell and Jessica Brown-Findlay was wonderful to watch, and they fit the roles very well.

Cinematography is also a very important part of the movie, the film visually looks amazing and it helped to create a believable New York, with all of the different settings and themes - major and small.

There are some issues here and there, but it is a 'Tale' and i think this motion picture represents the title perfectly.

The only real problem is the marketing - trailer, while it is really good, in my opinion, it barely represents the actual movie - posters, they look really cheap and similar to every romance film, therefore people might have been mistaken and not wanting to see this movie in theaters, although i can see now that the cover of Blu-Ray looks great. So, don't judge a product by it's marketing.

Overall, i loved the film, every second of it. Can't wait to see it again! A must own on Blu-Ray/DVD!

Blu-Ray review:

Winter's Tale on Blu-Ray looks exceptionally well. Video transfer is vivid, detailed and i think it captured the feel of the film in the cinemas. Audio is once again, top quality, no complains. Unfortunately, for me the most awaited part of the disc (Bonus Features) are not so great. There are 2 featurettes added and about 13 minutes of deleted, extended scenes. While, these still make an exciting watch, there are just too few of them. I was waiting for a Director's Cut,  commentaries, but was dissapointed to find only these special features. I still think that this is a worthy purchase, for people who haven't seen the film and for the fans. 4/5 Stars

The director/writer/producer Mr. Akiva Goldsman did an amazing job and i thank him and the rest of the cast and crew with all of my heart, thank You for making this one of a kind movie!",1399075200,67,2464,4.744730679156909
6251733,5,B00I6JOD8M,"Colin Farrell and Jessica Brown Findlay ~  with their beautifully expressive eyes, subtle gestures,
soft tones of voice and dialogue - make this movie an engaging, emotionally worthwhile journey.
The gorgeous cinematography, the atmospheric settings,  the striking characters and circumstances,
the evocative, spine-tingling score ~ all combine to make a  lyrical and  haunting  film.

In viewing, it might serve you well to be something of a romantic. Able to let yourself be
swept away into an imaginative premise and picturesque settings. If you know the Mark Helprin book,
don't let internal comparisons distract, seeking that unachievable perfection-in-translation.
Just let the movie simply be what it is. Consider both have something meaningful to offer.

This is magical realism, a from-the-heart type of film. Akiva Goldsman's admitted ""wink and a nod"" to
those who know what it is to have loved and lost and continued on. For as anyone knows who has been there
~ or imagined being there: There's no such thing as feeling you've lost once you have truly, deeply loved.
You carry such abiding love with you every day of your life ~ into eternity if there be one.

Love begins for Beverly Penn and Peter Lake at first sight. Though from separate worlds in upbringing,
their mutual need for something true ~ and  amazement at it finally arriving just as all else threatens ~
puts them immediately on equal terms where wonder and desire are concerned. Even as dark forces
conspire to destroy them, they dare to take what joy is there to be had.

Keep in mind, this film is predominantly about  Love. Capital L. Love in the highest sense of the word.
Not only the romance that occurs between the two leading characters.
There's more than meets the eye if you look closer.

Nothing is without meaning.

Some films may be read like poetry - the smallest nuance being as vital to the whole
as what's blazing on the surface.  This one has ""layers"" of stories within the story.
Some are obvious: the slips and bends of time, the impact of historic places, crossed destinies,
good versus evil, mystery over certainty, the universal longing for love in a world where death
should not triumph. Other aspects are far more secretive and delicate, better left to
individual interpretation.

Jessica Brown Findlay's lovely, ethereal voice is divinely  suited for Beverly's occasional
heavenly narrative. Her beauty at once innocent yet alluring, luminous and naturally elegant
~ perfect for love-at-first-sight.

Colin Farrell is impossibly captivating with unbelievably emotive eyes. His moving portrayal
of Peter Lake's undying love and profound grief is heart-rending and physically palpable.

The two together give the story a believable sincerity and make the movie
infinitely re-watchable and worthy of owning on DVD.

The A-list supporting cast - Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Eva Marie Saint,
William Hurt and the rest, all shine equally as bright.

A person biased against poetry will miss the treasure of the most exquisite poem.
The fault-finding critic will relentlessly find something to pick apart, be it in movie or book.
The particular audience this movie appeals to, the open-hearted viewer, will find
the light and beauty within ~ no matter what anyone else says or doesn't say.

A touching, deeply memorable film.

P.S. Two items critics complained about that might matter to some:

1. The fantasy elements. They are there. These are vital even in the book they also
complained the movie didn't fully do justice to. It does perfect justice by the
essence of the story, not by replicating every detail and character of the novel.
Remember - it's a tale, a parable of sorts, given to metaphor and visual imagery.

2. It used well-known actors in cameo roles. A glimpse and then they are gone. Once again,
this is a tale. As in  a dream, some visions and characters don't last as long as you wish
they would. They are there for a singular purpose and then they vanish. Even shorter scenes
are important to the whole. Actors in those roles just as stellar and worthy of appreciation.
Thankfully, true actors know this even when some critics do not.",1398988800,188,4159,5.001451378809869
6251734,5,B00I6JOD8M,Everything about this movie is good. the acting story visuals and music are perfect. Saw it on vday with my little bird and was really enjoyable.,1398816000,8,145,4.615384615384615
6251735,5,B00I6JOD8M,"Pretty good movie. Wished it had been a bit longer. Those of you who have read the book as well, does the movie stay pretty true to it? I haven't read the book yet, but I saw that it is quite long. My guess is they had to cut parts of the book out, and keep what they felt the most important parts were. Do the character's personalities match up with how they were in the book? I also heard the book was written in 1983, and that there were references to the Twin Towers in the book, and the movie was made about 30 years later, and sadly, the Twin Towers are no longer around, so obviously that had to be taken out of the movie. I usually have to watch a movie more then once, to really get the ""feel,"" of it, so I usually like it better when I watch it again. Also, someone mentioned it doing poorly at the box office. It could have been the timing, also, (spoilers), while the guy and girl DO end up together, it just isn't in the way you'd think, obviously, maybe that had something to do with it.  Think it's safe to say that he needed to perform his Miracle in order to get back to Beverly?credits roll, is supposed to be Peter and Beverly in the afterlife, finally together? I also wonder what Beverly's Father thought.....Think he knew what they were doing when she died? Wonder if he could have blamed Peter for her death in a way? Also, I wonder if the picture of the two of them together at the end, right before the credits roll, is supposed to be them together in Heaven? Also, When Peter was by Beverly's grave at the end of the movie, think he knew then it was his time to go be with her again?",1529107200,,1609,4.1079365079365076

6251762,3,B00I6JOD8M,"This was just odd. You don't really know what's going on for the first twenty minutes. The pacing is way off. You're thrown all this confusing information trying to figure out how it all fits together. There is a lot of present time and flash backs that make it even more confusing. Then you have the issue of trying to figure out if this is a fairy tale, romance, sci-fi, or paranormal flick. It could be a kids movie except that there is a sex scene in it. It's pretty tame sex (nudity is modest, no thrusting, tongue kissing or nipples), but it's sex nonetheless.

I wanted to love it, but it's just odd. I feel really unsettled after watching it when, on paper, the story should feel very satisfying. Maybe it would be a better story if it were told in another way. I don't know. So,it doesn't suck, but I probably wouldn't watch it again.",1519516800,,843,4.369426751592357

The film is quite different, but the thrills and sweet moments and philosophical asides like artworks around every corner of this well curated museum, enraptured me.  It's amazing how far a film can stretch the scant use of obvious CGI and not have the likes of me wanting more.  Forgive my sole gripe -- I unspoilingly announce is that Will Smith should not have been in this film  Next viewing probably a while from now, but this is on rotation  for sure.  And, of course, read the book.

Even the smallest roles are beautifully executed -- William Hurt, Jennifer Connelly, Graham Greene, Kevin Corrigan, Will Smith, Kevin Durand, and the incomparable Eva Marie Saint are all part of the magic that is this movie!

This is a great set-- DVD, Blu-Ray, and Ultra-violet. That makes it possible for me to watch it on any machine and in every room. A great set and an excellent price!",1497830400,5,685,4.7478991596638656

Colin Farrell did an excellent portrayal of the character, Peter Lake. Jessica Brown Findlay was beautiful, mysterious and mesmerizing in her role of Beverly Penn. The two together had that spark and chemistry that played out very well on screen. Russell Crowe's performance was perfect as the epitome of evil. Just seeing him on screen brought forth emotions of fear and what he was capable of as the devil's right-hand demon. Although, the ending might not be what is typically seen in love stories, the ending was perfect for this story and satisfying. I highly recommend this movie.",1482883200,,711,4.836065573770492

Points also for Russell Crowe being one of the most interesting, and well-played bad guys ever.

And if you don't read the entire cast list (and I urge you *not* to..because..) you will be so surprised at the cameo performance as Lucifer. At least I was.

That said, I'm not sure I really liked the ending - but I'm not sure that I didn't.

And all *that* said, this movie has something for everyone - romance and mush for those who like that, blood and fights for those who like that sort of thing, and good versus evil for everyone. EXCEPT - there is some intense violence and  peril - I would *not* show this to a child who is under the age of 13, or maybe even a little older.",1475539200,4,910,4.107344632768362

Half way into the movie it became impossible to watch any longer.  The attempt to marry fantasy with reality failed miserably.  The mixed up story and characters gave me a headache and I finally turned of this stinking mush.  The cast was great,  but the story and the way it unfolds compares to a ride on the TEACUPS at Disneyworld after drinking a bottle of vodka!  I lost all interest, turned it off have way through and tossed the DVD into a box of donations for the Goodwill store.

The costumes and settings are very authentic of old and new New York and it is nice to see Colin Farrell playing a ""good guy"".  Fun brief appearance by Will Smith as Lucifer and Russell Crowe is a very creepy villain.  Jessica Brown Findlay is lovely and ethereal as the past love and Jennifer Connelly is always nice to see.",1464998400,5,467,4.202247191011236
6251886,4,B00I6JOD8M,"The film incorporates ancient beliefs about life. We are all connected by light. We turn into stars when we die. There is one miracle in all of us. The gods/angels/demons intervene.

In our tale Peter (Colin Farrell) is a thief in NYC. He leaves the dark side run by a demon Pearly (Russell Crowe) and joins the good side. Pearly works for Lucifer (Will Smith) and is after Peter who meanwhile falls in love with a pretty redhead (Jessica Brown Findlay) who is about to die from TB. Peter literally lifts her off her feet and rides off on a magical white horse. This leaves me really skeptical: Did a guy really write this?

This is a slow developing story. It has several good scenes and a number of snooze scenes. I would leave out the narration which assumes the audience are idiots and work whatever ideas it gives us into the Lucifer dialog. 3 1/2 stars

This movie is an enjoyably weird thing to behold. I dare anyone to try to tell someone about it and NOT sound like you're on bath salts.
I suggest watching it. It's a weird fun time that tries to pass itself off as a magical love story, but it's the framing device of that love story that makes it so wonky.
There isn't much set up for the rules of the fantasy world. Things just are the way they are with little to no explanation or anyone questioning it.

6251940,5,B00I6JOD8M,"Watching this film gave me a greater appreciation and liking towards Colin Farrell for the role he played. To have found such a great love that endured into the 21st century was an amazing, though unrealistic, feat, but it worked for the film that I was able to enjoy this film for what it really was. Also having known Jessica Brown Findlay from Downton Abbey, I came to see her in a new perspective, one which I adored her even more because she continued to play a role that depicted her true lovable self. Russell Crowe's role, though he was evil, was incredible human at times that you almost felt sorry for him for being the demon he was and wished he was a better person in the story. After seeing him play a villain, I was excited to go back to watch his other films such as A Beautiful Mind and Cinderella Man to appreciate him even more as an actor because he is so incredible and it's nice to see all aspects of his acting. All the characters in this film did a terrific job playing their roles that it conveyed a very powerful message and that is: love can and will always endure everything now and forever.",1443657600,,1118,4.328571428571428

After watching him in this film, I changed my mind.  He plays a different type of character than I am used to seeing him play.  In this film, Colin's capacity for human emotion is greatly displayed.  This is a moving tale.  I liked the fantasy/paranormal/historic feel to this story.  And let's not forget, Russell Crowe.  He was great also.  One of my favorites.  Always.",1440547200,,546,4.32

This movie has characters of the same name and some of the same settings and that is the only thing in common with the book. The plot is not the same, it has very little to do with the book.

The writing isn't bad, but story was nonsensical and you can't follow the plot to save your life.  Maybe the book is better?

I BELIEVE IT TAKES A GOOD BRAIN AND A GOOD IMAGINATION TO TRULY APPRECIATE THIS FINE WORK. THE MORONS WHO WATCH TRANSFORMERS 1-6 WOULD CERTAINLY NOT WATCH A QUALITY PIECE OF ART LIKE WINTER'S TALE. THE MOVIE LOST MONEY BUT WAS NEVER THE LESS A FINE WORK OF ART.UNFORTUNATELY MOST GOOD MOVIES DO NOT MAKE MONEY. THE GARBAGE RAKES IN THE BUCKS SO HOLLYWOOD WILL CONTINUE TO PRODUCE DREG.

The novel is very long and I think they did a very good job of adapting the book to the movie.  And of course I loved the casting!!  Who better than Colin Farrell as the main character and love interest and who else can pull off beautifully a bad guy than Russell Crowe, two of my favorite actors. All in all they stuck to the premise of the book and that was difficult, because,as I said the book is very long. They didn't butcher the story, like so many other book to movie do.  It's a wonderfully lovely story. I've read the book several times, and have often wondered why it hadn't been made into a movie. It has all the great qualities of a totally enthralling story.  I also bought this, as I plan to watch it for a third time with my fiance.

6251992,4,B00I6JOD8M,"Between the end of February 2015 and May 2015 I watched seven (7) movies, in addition to the 10 I previously contributed reviews for, where Colin Farrell played a key role.  In alphabetical order, the 7 movies are: Ask the Dust, Cassandras Dream, Horrible Bosses, Minority Report, The Recruit, Seven Psychopaths and Winters Tale.

I only now became aware that the actor was being honored for his overall achievements in film.  Around mid- May this year, the movie The Lobster was awarded third place (Prix du Jury) in the Cannas Film Festival, which an international award.  But, its the Maui Film Festival Navigator Award that sums up my sentiments of Colin Farrells performances in every movie I have watched so far. Theres nothing I could write that could be more persuasive to get people to watch his movies than recent recognition of the actor and his abilities.  It seems appropriate to  support the actor and the movies Ive watched by posting this in lieu of fleshing out individual reviews.

The following is from MauiNow.com (Posted 06:23 PM HST, June 5, 2015):
Colin Farrell was the recipient of the esteemed Navigator Award, during the Celestial Cinema on Friday night (06/05/2015) at the 16th annual Maui Film Festival.

The Maui Film Festival Navigator Award honors a film artist for carving a path of distinction through the turbulent waters of the entertainment industry without sacrificing their fundamental commitment to excellence.

Colin Farrell is a chameleon who constantly creates one-of-a-kind characters that send pitch perfect pebble-to-boulder-sized ripples through whatever story his performance is helping to tell, said festival founder and director Barry Rivers. In short, Colin is a cinematic force of nature and, for that reason, the Maui Film Festival takes great pride in honoring him with its 2015 Navigator Award.",1433808000,2,1848,5.1952861952861955

In the case of Winter's Tale, I would normally give it a three star review based on the solid acting and production value which was paired with the drivel that is its storyline. I understand suspending your disbelief, but this movie asks to much and for to long. Even so, on my scale it still would have deserved a three star rating; however the religious symbolism was offensive so instead of giving it one star Im just splitting the difference.",1429660800,,666,4.328

I may be pretty slow on the uptake, but I cannot for the life of me see where the movie was generated from the book - but that's not a bad thing in any way. The book was, for all intents and purposes, quite good -- a fantasy-allegory, the nature of which is somehow beyond my words to describe or explain.

The movie, though, is a beautiful and ethereal love story. How they got this love story out of the book is beyond me, but I'm glad that they did. I'll admit to being a hopeless romantic, but this story about a love that spans well over a hundred years (under circumstances I won't and/or cannot explain) was so very touching and yet, for my sensibilities, so entirely plausible. The leads (Colin Farrell, Jessica Brown Findlay and Russell Crowe) are just perfect in their respective parts. Jessica has that perfectly ethereal quality, which is somehow a good match for Farrell's down-to-earth quality - both of which are put into jeopardy by Crowe.

I highly recommend this movie - but, if you're a bit slow like I am, you may need to watch it more than once. Once you get the feel for it, you'll want to watch it again ---- and, likely, again.",1428796800,2,1261,4.357446808510638

I accepted that much of the story would have to be omitted to make it a film, but what greatly disappointed me was the films failure to show that Winter's Tale was not love story about Peter and Beverly...it was a love story about New York City. The horses wings were cheesy...the CGI was poorly done, and my biggest gripe is that the WINTER (capitalized because in the book it was a winter to end all winters), looked like any normal winter in New York.

6252072,3,B00I6JOD8M,"Many people, including me, were sure Winters Tale would be the perfect Valentines Day movie, yet the early reviews warned us all of another disaster. The movie has lower ratings than Endless Love in early reviews, which means that watching its trailers and teasers over and over again is a better financial bet than shelling out the cost of an actual ticket.

Based on a the 1983 novel by Mark Helprin, Winters Tale is the story of Peter Lake, played by Colin Farrell, who falls in love with a girl dying of tuberculosis. Nothing is out of the ordinary until you add some magic powder to it and throw some time travel into the mix. As seen in the trailer, the plot is both interesting and confusing at the same time. The only thing that kept me waiting for something better was the promise of Russell Crowe as the villain in this movie. Unfortunately, we are living in times where even Russell Crowe cant prevent movies from being sent to the hall of shame.

From his unbelievably awful portrayal of Alexander the Great in 2004s Alexander up to the recent box office bomb Dead Man Down, Colin Farrell has lost his star power. Where Farrell goes, disaster follows. Even a small role in the beautifully crafted Saving Mr. Banks was not enough to redeem him.

Make no mistake, Winters Tale is a wonderful story about the power of love and the novel certainly belongs on your shelf. It is much cheaper than a ticket to another unsuccessful adaptation, and you can read it over and over again without regretting it.

I fell sad for that critic . Several of my favorite movies have been panned . It seems like the world of today is becoming increasingly colder and people are loosing their capacity to ""feel"" or maybe they are afraid to let themselves have any emotional depth . It's nice to let your heart and mind be swept away by a little fantasy once in a while . When any movie can make you feel a little happiness, a little love , a little sadness, or maybe a little anger , that is a gift . Maybe  I'll never find that kind of love or crazy adventure in my life, but it's nice to know what it feels like! If you want reality , watch the news . But if you want something a little ""more better"" see a good movie . ( if your heart and mind can handle it ) . I found this movie to be very entertaining well acted and well written . It made me ""feel""!!!  By the way , if you do run into the devil one day and he looks like Will Smith , won't that be a kick in the ass?",1424649600,,1106,3.7835497835497836

6252123,5,B00I6JOD8M,"""A Winter's Tale"" is a beautiful movie - one of the nicest I have seen in years. I recently enjoyed Colin Farrell's acting as young Helen's father in ""The Saving of Mr Banks"" and had never seen him before, but his performance in this movie is superb.
I had bought the movie because I am a Russell Crowe fan. I appreciated Crowe's performance, however his role in ""A Winter's Tale"" is as a supporting actor and is quite dark and different to the likeable lead hero he usually plays. Interesting.
While I am not a lover of time-lapse films, this one worked for me.

One must be in the mood for such a thing; you have been warned. I am not a religious man. While there is an absence of bible thumping it has characters representing and/or referencing the devil, god, spirits, and destiny. In my opinion none of them can be taken seriously in this film any more so than in life, and that is why I like it. This movie combines a few ideas and draws it own impossible relationships between categories. It is a heavily overacted fairytale at times and is clearly over the top emotionally.

6252184,4,B00I6JOD8M,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Wondrous, Heavenly, Delightful, Joyous work I have seen in many years. I had little notion how much of a hopeless romantic I am, besides my earlier belief in Santa, which by the way, lasted until I was Freakin' TEN YEARS OLD. I suffered greatly for that, due to the never ending lambastes for loving an older unavailable man, but HEY at least that phase only lasted till 10!

Colin is one of the most instinctual actors I have seen who first graced my film palette with ""Alexander"" and his range, especially in the sadness and sorrow arena are incomparable. The hair color and widows peak did distract sufficiently to detract points but as with other Whiskey Tango Fox elements of the movie, I had to ignore this effect. I also never saw Consumption depicted in this manner, she never coughed once!

The cast of characters were as unbelievable as the storyline and I think this may be why there are several ""professional"" amateur reviews on here to keep a potential audience far, far away. Sorry fellas, this was a beautiful work of art and then some. I always desire a more pure form of content but some reviews have me thinking otherwise.

I was so moved by the storyline that just reading the quotes on this site brought tears. OY! Am so very glad I was all alone to reveal my true side of being religious, romantic, hopeful, and deeply somber.

Eva Marie Saint! So wonderful to see her at 90 and spry. Graham Greene playing against character, well, not many Indians shown in 1916 NYC... haha. And who doesn't love a winged white horse to complete a fantasy? I have little complaint due to the overwhelming themes that delved into my youngest dreams and made them come alive. Hope springs eternal even if just for that flash of lightning.

So do you believe in Magic? If not by films end, you have my deepest of sympathies. Perhaps give it another try with eyes wide shut. High recommend for all young at heart.",1417910400,,1956,4.574285714285714

It's definitely something for those more inclined to fantasy, metaphor, and plots that aren't always A to B. It reminds me of a more Fantasy ""Big Fish"" that same sort of anything can happen kind of wonder. It's a sweet love story with concepts that might not be new but are executed with a fresh spin. It's one of those movies that you will understand by the end if you pay attention, but until the story ties everything together you really can't force it to explain itself. Now I love that kind of story telling now and then.

This is not my usual type of movie. I am a 75 year-old man and love macho action movies. My favorites are Godfather and Patton. I hate romances and cannot explain why I was totally enthralled by this love story. Perhaps I understood what the producers were trying to say about love and good and evil.",1416268800,,682,4.213740458015267

To see Russell Crowe play the part of the quintessential devil's helper, as he  did in this vehicle once again portrays his natural talent to play both sides of the bad/good theme; the man did an excellent job. Colin Farrell - wow, who better could have stolen things and stuff to have the things and stuff of his heart and soul stolen from him by the gorgeous Jessica Brown Findley?
  Well, this ""chick flick"" made me weep three times, the big sap that I am. My wife just gave me that beautiful upside-down smile only women can do (how do they do that, anyway?), and a very long hug to go with it. We pay money to be entertained, and this film did that in spades. Give this one a look; it's a beautiful story, full of heart, love, some magic, and just enough thrills to keep you going.

6252218,4,B00I6JOD8M,"Critically panned and basically shunned when it made its theatrical run, I caught WINTER'S TALE on cable with exactly zero anticipation.  Knock me over with a feather!  This whimsical, magical, haunting tale of transcendent love is a definite keeper.  WINTER'S TALE is the story of thief Peter Lake (Colin Farrell), a 1916 New York troublemaker who's made a mortal enemy of the demon Pearly (Russell Crowe is terrific).  By chance, Peter breaks into the wealthy Penn household to rob it, and meets the beautiful--yet consumptive--Beverly Penn (the stunning Jessica Brown Findlay).  Beverly's days are numbered, yet the two instantly fall in deep love, and Peter decides if there's one more thing for him to steal, it is Beverly's death.  This yearning for a ""miracle"" makes Beverly the target for Pearly, who sends a goon to the Penn country estate to poison Beverly.  Peter is crushed, and his confrontation with Pearly and his men should have been his demise, yet Peter finds himself crawling out of the East River in the year 2014; it turns out he cannot die, for he is Beverly's miracle.  Destiny puts him in the path of terminally ill little Abby (Ripley Sobo), and her mother Virginia (Jennifer Connelly).  Peter discovers that saving Abby is his miracle, and after one more confrontation with Pearly (who is incensed Peter is still alive), a miracle does indeed take place.  The viewer then learns there is a close correlation between miracles. . .and the stars of the sky.

Again, this is a beautiful, haunting film showing love is timeless and transcends lifetimes.  Other noteworthy acting performances include William Hurt as the Penn patriarch, Graham Greene as Peter's mentor and friend, and a cameo by Will Smith as the Judge (i.e., Satan).  Screenplay writer and director Akiva Goldsman bases WINTER'S TALE on the Mark Helprin novel of the same name; it's a novel I will definitely be picking up.  If one can get past the bad press and approach this film with an open mind, WINTER'S TALE will prove to be a most rewarding experience.

The movie makers definently went the whole nine yards on the evil side. They brought in the name Lucifer with a face change and personality switch. It was without a doubt very demonic in nature. The Lord is the author of love, but they didn't bring him into the movie except in profanity. If this truly was a movie about good and evil than the Lord needs to be involved because there is nothing good apart from him. It could be that I'm missing some big peice of the film because I didn't watch it all, but I highly doubt I'm missing very much. I read a synopsis of the movie and apparently at the end Peter uses his miracle to ""save"" Abbey, then goes to live ""among the stars"". This is a very strange movie with very twisted views.  A film can be allegorical without being all strange and twisted. Anyway, if your a sensitive person on any level guard your eyes and DON'T watch Winter's Tale.

The first star is because Amazon makes me give it at least one... the second is for Colin Farrell's performance (and, hey, anything that lets you look at that face for two hours can't be all bad, right?).

Still, though, I'd love to see someone actually make the film the trailer seemed to be advertising. Anyone...?",1411171200,,718,5.128205128205129
6252294,3,B00I6JOD8M,"This review is from: Winter's Tale (Amazon Instant Video)

Winter's Tale somewhat defies description - is it a romance? is it a period piece? is it an allegory? a fantasy? Regardless of what you call it, it's a moving and emotional journey. The story starts in the early 1900's, when we meet Peter Lake, acted by Colin Farrell, a charming thief, just 2 steps ahead of the law. He accidentally meets Beverly Penn, acted by Jessica Brown Findlay (of Downton Abbey), in her home when he finds an open window and enters the sumptuous estate in order to steal something. She is not at all afraid of him, and helps him to escape unnoticed. Beverly is suffering from consumption, from which she is expected to die, and Peter is totally taken by her beauty and gentle spirit. She shines with a light that sparkles and believes that each person who leaves the earth becomes a star. Her stern father disapproves of him, of course, though Peter eventually wins him over by saving the family home from a fiery explosion by fixing the runaway furnace.

Peter acquires a white horse of magical properties - it flies ! But he is constantly being pursued by the scar-faced evil maniac played by Russell Crowe. The film makers could have done a better job of revealing the back story of why these two are opponents. Crowe represents the dark forces that are out to destroy both Peter and Beverly.

Peter gives Beverly one of her dying wishes by taking her out to dance on New Year's Eve, but he is unable to prolong her life when she suddenly takes a turn for the worse. Peter believed he had been sent to save her, and that was his destiny.

The fantasy aspect reveals itself through the beautiful flying white horse and the fact that Peter survives for nearly 100 years searching for the woman who followed the light. He eventually finds the vision that he has been chasing his whole life, and it's completely unexpected and beautiful to behold. His love transcends generations and gives him purpose and fulfillment.

The film is a visual masterpiece of beautiful sets and costumes and scenes, and the score is lovely and haunting. I don't usually seek out fantasy films, but this one had enough realism mixed in with the fantasy to hold my interest.",1411084800,,2235,4.633838383838384
6252295,2,B00I6JOD8M,"Caveat: This is a guy's review of a would-be schmaltzy love story.

Ever read a book where you find out that the thing everyone was chasing is so over-the-top ridiculous, it ruined what had otherwise been a fun romp? I'm thinking of recent Dan Brown novels, and M. Night Shyamalan's The Village.

In this case, I do not blame the writer.  The ending, while saccharine and a bit forced, felt true to the story, and I can see why some people found it deep and satisfying. Thanks to poor pacing, lack of development of what could've been some very interesting characters, and a particularly odd and distracting casting choice, I found the ending to be a major letdown.

The earlier parts of the movie present a mostly engaging tale of love and mystery that treads little new ground, but is well told. Jessica Brown Findlay is very fetching and believable as a young girl born into an affluent environment. Fans of Downton's Lady Sybil will find her character quite familiar. Colin Farrell's roguish protagonist is likeable enough.  Russell Crowe played a good turn as the villain, but I was not crazy about his motives. We've all seen his ""rason d'etre"" before.  Without giving anything away that isn't learned in the opening dialog, we realize that much of the background should be taken on ""faith"". Crowe's character is presented as an unambiguously evil villain.  When later scenes try to make him more relatable to us mere mortals, it feels either insincere or incomplete.

William Hurt is interesting, as always, but we've seen his character before, too.

The soundtrack and the cinematography steal nearly every scene, and the story, while inadequately told here, was poignant, if sappy. A young adult who has not yet encountered most of the themes here might find this movie to be beautiful and thought-provoking.

I wanted to like it, and I almost did. Maybe if they had stopped the movie suddenly after Colin Farrell wakes up and sees the scenes of our present, and rolled credits over the lovely score,  it could've left us wanting more. Maybe it was really just too much of a story for this one movie.",1411084800,,2109,4.78236914600551

6252297,4,B00I6JOD8M,"The mood of this film reminded me a lot of ""Upside Down"" : a kind of ethereal place that spans time and space. The idea of souls and soulmates, and human destiny. Think 70s books like ""The Bridge Across Forever."" ... We are intertwined in the fabric of things that are much larger than ourselves and we only get glimpses sometimes .... I enjoyed this film quite a lot, it is a romance and it is also about good versus evil. Russell Crowe is such a great actor: brilliant as the thug/gangster (much in the same way as his role as mayor of New York in that other film.) You'll enjoy this movie if you like mystical, fantasy mood pieces with a philosophical message.",1410998400,3,663,4.354838709677419
6252298,4,B00I6JOD8M,"This is a romantic fantasy that tells a love story that stretches across time and space. I have not read the book so this review is strictly about the movie version. At the beginning the movie is a little hard to follow; we see random things happening that do not immediately relate to each other. I suspect if one watched the movie after reading the book it would all make better sense right away.

It quickly becomes evident that supernatural forces are at work in the lives of the characters and the story will move beyond the obvious and natural. I don't have a problem with this as I am a fan of some fantasy and can take that in stride. If you're looking for a simple love story, this isn't it.

The movie held our attention all the way through but I probably enjoyed it more than my wife did who would have preferred just a simple, normal love story. We had rented the movie and I will not be adding it to our collection.

This is the kind of movie that leaves a lot of unanswered questions and requires the viewer to just accept the reality of things as shown and not look for logical answers. If you can do that, then you'll likely enjoy the movie, if you can't, then this movie is probably not for you; I was able to do that to a greater degree than my wife.

The movie is well acted and the scenery contributes nicely to the telling of the story. There are certainly moments of musical beauty if your tastes incline toward the classical as mine do and tender scenes of love and trust. There are, however, moments of brutality that bothered my wife but they illustrated the depraved nature of the demonic villain, Pearly Soames, played by Russell Crowe.

While the movie hints at the on-going spiritual warfare, it greatly distorts what is actually going on in the spiritual realm.

I would suggest you rent this movie first to see if it is a good fit for you and your family.",1410998400,,1886,4.358974358974359

6252346,2,B00I6JOD8M,"Implausibility is the hallmark of Akiva Goldsmans Winters Tale, a sappy romance, whose handsome production values and fantastical elements cant quite conceal its dime-novel origins. Set at the turn-of-the-century (the 20th Century, that is), this adaptation of the Mark Helprin novel employs generous dollops of magic realism in a vain attempt to cover a multitude of narrative sins.

Peter Lake (Colin Farrell) is a dreamy-eyed thief-with-a-heart-of-gold who makes a home for himself in the attic of Grand Central Station, rides around the city on a kind of magic horse, and, on one of his periodic burglaries, meets Beverly Penn (Jessica Brown Findlay), a poor little rich girl, who, like all good heroines of a certain era, is rapidly succumbing to consumption. Repeating to some extent his Javert bit in Les Miserables (minus, thank heavens, the singing), Russell Crowe plays Pearly Soames, a sadistic Fagin-esque figure who raised the orphaned Peter up to become a thief but who now thinks his young ex-protg has just turned into a great big softie (the fellow has somehow gotten the notion that he can steal from people without actually harming them physically) and is determined to make Lake pay for his disloyalty. Soames is so villainous, in fact, that he stops just short of twirling his mustache whenever hes about to perform one of his trademarked dastardly deeds. Turns out theres more to it, though, as we learn that Peter is the first human whos on the brink of using his miracle, (i.e., saving Beverly) which would result in...well, were never really quite sure what it would result in, but were assured it would be pretty awesome. And, oh yes, did I mention that at some point a laughable Will Smith joins the proceedings, portraying no less a figure than that old boy Lucifer, who it turns out is Soames boss, Soames himself being a demon from hell? And things just get weirder from there. In fact, I half expected the horse to let out with a Wi..i..i..i..lber at some point, but he never did.

Fast forward to the present day to find an amnesia-stricken Peter unaccountably defying the ravages of time to wander the streets of New York searching for that elusive something he knows he lost a full century ago. Yet, amidst all the soul-searching and miracle-working and New Age-philosophizing, the only thing we really want to know is why the man couldn't come up with a more stylish and flattering hairstyle after a hundred additional years on Earth.

Ah well, if this sort of thing happens to be your cup of tea, at least know that youll be rewarded with some mighty impressive visuals as well as a total saturation in period atmosphere. Youll also get to see such acting stalwarts as William Hurt, Jennifer Connelly, Graham Greene and Eva Marie Saint in supporting roles. But beyond that, I cant offer much in the way of encouragement or solace for those who insist on giving Winters Tale a try.

He proves that he is one of the greatest actors alive today, that he can overcome rampant incompetence all around him and deliver a powerful, deeply believable and moving performance against impossible odds.

Most actors need a strong director and a strong screenplay to deliver a great performance (Liz Taylor in Virginia Woolf, for example), but Farrell doesn't need anything except a camera. He's amazing.

All the other actors besides Farrell are at least competent (except for the always insufferable Will Smith), and William Hurt and Russell Crowe rise slightly above competence.

The only other greatness here is in the sets, the locations, which are some of the best I've ever seen. Everything looks real and authentic, as if it was filmed entirely on location in Manhattan - but they'd have had to shut down the city and blow the whole $60 million budget on filming permits if it had been.

This movie's downfall is the idiotic story, a schmaltzy mess of fake spirituality and stupid, leaden fantasy - but it inherited all that from Helprin's book. Goldsman's fault is not that he botched the filming of a great novel but that he tried to film a stupid one. For this to be a good movie, it would have to be much better than the book, and it's not.",1409616000,,1360,4.654166666666667

But when the audience leaves the theater asking each other just how old is Eva Marie Saint anyway? we know the movie has a problem.
 Winters Tale the book authored by Mark Helprin in 1983 found a wide and enthusiastic readership.  In 2006 in a poll of literary professionals Winters Tale was among those mentioned as the best work of American fiction of the last 25 years.  People liked the book and the literati also liked it, a lot in fact.  However the ambiguities in the original text and the technique of magic realism just did not make a satisfactory transition to the big screen.  It is in fact a confusing mess with glimmers of brilliance.
 Peter Lake (Colin Farrell) is an orphan in turn of the century New York, the abandoned child of would be immigrants.  He is a professional thief.  That in itself is plenty to pack into a single character.  In the course of his business he encounters Jessica Brown Findlay (recently of Downton Abbey) as the terminally ill daughter of a newspaper magnate.  She is not just lovely but also brave, kind and vulnerable.  He falls hard for her which we find entirely believable.  Her love and death transform him forever.  It is a nice story, no?  Well yes, but there is more.
 Russell Crowe is the Demon in charge of New York who works for Lucifer, played by Will Smith.  From time to time a magic white horse Athansor pops up to rescue the hero from the demons.  The dead girl is translated into a star.  The hero is in 1916 one moment and in 2014 a blink later and doesnt have a memory.  In modern time he rescues another sick girl, a little child, from the demonic Russell Crowe.  Are you following all this?
 In the novel it all works.  In the movie is just seems silly.  People do not act as they do in the film.  No stupendously rich father welcomes into the life of his dying daughter a self proclaimed thief.  No mum and da would set their infant adrift in a toy boat in New York harbor.  When a magic white horse springs gossamer wings and flies a fleeing couple away from danger normal folk would comment upon it.  It is all just too much.  It is also just too little.  We have an apparently divinely inspired horse, a guardian Angel and an Angel in human form who all wander in from stage right briefly, never with an explanation and sometimes with no narrative purpose.  In films with cosmic themes of Angles and Demons there is usually some sense of a

theological framework.  This movie omits even that.
 The movie version of Winters Tale is written and directed by Akiva Goldsman in his first time outing in both tasks.  The translation from print to film is beyond him.  It may have been beyond anyone.
 In addition to actors already mentioned we have William Hurt who should be given best actor in an implausible role as the dying girls super rich father.  Jennifer Connelly (Blood Diamond, Requiem for a Dream) plays a mom in 2014 New York who helps Peter Lake find his release.  Eva Marie Saint plays the 104 year old newspaper heiress in 2014 who remembers Peter Lake from 1916.  Miss Saint won her Oscar for On the Waterfront with Marlin Brando in 1954.  She continues to be a fine actress at age 89.
 Winters Tale will go down in the books as the first big catastrophe of 2014.  Estimates of the production budget range from $60 million to an absurd $150 million.  Whatever the true total might be it is not likely to be returned to the producers.  The opening weekend brought in a miniscule $7 million.  Clearly Akiva Goldsman lost control of the spending on the picture.
 This single saw blade flick will submerge without a smudge on the minds of the viewing public.  Few will see it.  The PG-13 fantasy runs two hours and 9 minutes.  The acting successes do not overcome the inherent complexity and implausibility of the material.
 Read the book and enjoy it .",1409529600,2,4029,4.4930939226519335

Thank you for an original story! It was realistically fantastic which is the only kind of fantastic film I can fully buy into. The only thing I didn't really like were a few unresolved issues that I had that were not fully explained in the film. I am logical and need the why and how as well as full closure and I felt that was missing with the characters who played Colin Farrell's parents. Just me though.,1409097600,4,559,4.333333333333333

Winters Tale has been my favorite book for many years and I am aware that as such an epic, sprawling story, it couldn't all make it to the screen.  But this story was butchered, ravaged, and utterly destroyed.  It's as if all the magic and mystique was purposely surgically removed.

The entire movie was just really convoluted. The introduction of the fantasy was without any explanation, and we never really got a decent explanation as the movie went on. The time travel was really jarring and unnecessary, as was Will Smith's cameo.

The love story between Peter and Beverly was severely lacking in quality.  And the actors seemed misplaced in their roles....Will Smith as Lucifer.  Pathetic.  It was all so stupid I will just say I HATED this movie.  Absolute trash.  Trying to put into our minds that the ""universe"" loves us and has a plan and that we become stars when we die.

But after watching it all the way through, it all came together with such fluid ease that I immediately wanted to watch it again. The screenplay was adapted from the book, of the same name, by author Mark Helprin. Having read the book, I must say the movie was a pleasant surprise.

The chemistry between Beverly and Peter was amazing. Of course this is because Colin and Jessica are extremely talented actors. I couldn't imagine any other actors playing these parts. They were fantastic together.

The story itself is a timeless classic. A tale of true love so strong, it stands the test of time. Especially in Peter's case - it elongates his lifespan. It literally keeps him alive through years and years. It all comes down to the belief that every person is born with a miracle inside them and this miracle is meant for one person and one person alone.

Beverly fulfilled her destiny and later, so did Peter.

It had a very bittersweet ending. So be sure you have a box of Kleenex handy when you watch it. It's a tear jerker.",1407110400,4,1138,4.483091787439614
6252489,5,B00I6JOD8M,"""Winter's Tale"" truly deserves a perfect title - as a tale dares you to believe in something very unique while it is wistfully told to the tune of love and destiny along with aspects of the mystical and unending magical promise.  It speaks to the viewer in metaphors and symbolism with each little detail having a larger lyrical meaning. Some little-applied shine of mysticism, but mainly a tale of overwhelming and haunting romantic love where time itself is its own character. Full of layered stories which lapse into others, and some that come alive for your own personal interpretation allowing you to be swept away. I was thoroughly enchanted with the story of this couple, Peter Lake (Colin Farrell) and his love, at first sight, Beverly Penn (Jessica Brown Findlay).  It got so far under my skin after it first hit me squarely in my heart.

This sumptuous narrative beats in a rhythm with the heart of a romantic. With a screenplay written by Akiva Goldsman (""A Brilliant Mind"", ""Cinderella Man"", also with Russell Crowe) who then turns to direct this piece adapted from the novel by Mark Helprin.  Goldsman treats his tale with his personal touch that comes from one who deeply feels the storyline and believes in the power of what love is able to do then dares you to catch a miracle.  When I first learned of the film, I thought I would have to suspend my disbelief quite a bit when I did view it.  What did occur is this spellbinding story played out easily to my emotional side, it stretched out and pulled me in quite effortlessly.  It was so enjoyable to just sit back and watch this unfold, feel the full bluster of emotions, and not care at all if this tale wasn't entirely based on reality but so much more in mood and emotion.  Thank goodness for that because this seasonal story just blew me away and easily at that.  It is quite astounding to delight in as the cinematography (Caleb Deschanel) is both deliberate and delicate. The silvery-white winter scenes shimmer enchantingly.  The music (Rupert Gregson-Williams and Hans Zimmer) casts its spell equally well and does not cast a long shadow over the dialog but allows for swells and then evens out as if it is breathing along with you.  There is also quite an enjoyable flurry of actors included everywhere throughout from Will Smith, Eva Marie Saint, to Jennifer Connelly and William Hurt. They all make their quite important marks and are gone in the wink of an eye.

Beverly is positively ethereal; her gossamer nature is almost intangible while her circumstance makes one feel that she is just out of reach for a mutually besotted Peter.  She is very ill with Consumption, as this is set in circa 1916 New York City. The whole feel of knowing this of one's true love makes for an urgency of devotion in Peter to know her and love her as best as he can. A petty thief and master mechanic who enters her home while she is alone and is quickly discovered, he admits that he came to rob the family although has quickly reconsidered.  He cannot help but make the undeniable decision to just steal her heart instead upon first seeing her.  Emotions and chemistry are flying around this couple as a heightened blush of blinding attraction, the subject of which definitely peaks this tale.

This winter is glossed with chilly issues and we quickly learn that along with a smooth frost of good inevitably comes the icy chiseled evil. This in the convincing but menacing person of an otherworldly Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe). He has had many dealings with Peter before going his own way, you could definitely say they are acquainted. The whole treatment of the darkness versus the light in a steely battle through these two men is a basic theme of the story. A study of interest too, it includes within how a timeless love follows Peter from the past to the present day through the memory of his Beverly who has told him, ""There is the world behind this world where we are all connected"".  It may be hidden in the frost or from the light, in the love we have for that essential person, the belief in miracles, in your own destiny, or perhaps it is plainly written in the stars.  ""Magic is all around us"", Beverly reminds Peter along with the viewer, ""we just have to look""...",1407110400,5,4245,4.622340425531915

6252496,3,B00I6JOD8M,"I made a point of watching Akiva Goldsmans's ""Winter's Tale"" *after* reading the book upon which it's based, knowing that stories are usually considered better on the page than in their filmic adaptations. But having completed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mark-Helprin-s-novel/dp/0156031191/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mark Helprin's novel</a>&nbsp;of the same name, I was left pretty bewildered as to how on earth the transition from book to screen would take place.

The trailers would have you believe that ""Winter's Tale"" is a bittersweet time-travelling love story (perhaps a more fairytale-esque version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Time-Traveler-s-Wife/dp/015602943X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Time Traveler's Wife</a>), though I suspect any romance-loving reader who tracks down the book on the basis of this film will be utterly baffled by what it has to offer. Suffice to say that the book and the film are only tangentially related, sharing a few character names, a couple of plot scenarios and the basic gist of two lovers separated by death and time (though in the book, Peter and Beverly's love story only takes up about 10% of the page count).

Adapting the book in its entirety would have been utterly impossible, and so Goldsman spins his own tale out of a selection of Helprin's ideas, ending up with something that's rather like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Story/dp/B000IB681Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Story</a>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paradise-Lost/dp/048644287X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paradise Lost</a>. As it happens, the film inserts a fleshed-out backstory for one of its villains, something that is only ever-so-vaguely hinted at in the book, changing the entire narrative into a romance set against a backdrop of warring demons and angels.

It's 1916 and Peter Lake (Colin Farrell) is an Irish thief on the run from his old employer Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe) who seems to have a vested interest in vengeance that goes beyond punishing his runaway protg. When a mysterious white horse comes to Peter's rescue, he decides to steal what he needs from a row of Upper West Side mansions and get out of New York for a while.

Beverly Penn (Jessica Findlay Brown, best known as Lady Sybil on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Downton-Abbey/dp/B0047H7QD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Downton Abbey</a>) is a beautiful young woman dying of consumption. She's alone in the house when Peter breaks in, but after an unorthodox meetcute the two of them realize their mutual attraction. A tentative romance blossoms, but Pearly is incensed at their connection, certain that it foreshadows an impending miracle - something that he's determined to prevent.

There are some trite elements (Beverly's interminable voice-overs) and some rather inexplicable bits (Will Smith as Lucifer!) but I found myself enjoying it despite its undeniable unevenness. The visuals are beautiful, with vistas of snowy parks and ice-covered lakes, as well as a cast that manage to keep straight faces throughout some awkward exposition and wonky CGI of winged horses. Jessica Findlay Brown in particular is simply gorgeous - if anyone was ever going to fall in love at first sight, it would most probably be with her.

Critics totally panned this film, but I suspect it may find a second life on DVD. Despite its strangeness, there is a sincerity and beauty to it that is best enjoyed curled up on the sofa with a hot drink and/or a crackling fire. It's sweet and winsome and a little ridiculous at times, but honestly? I liked it.",1406937600,,3790,6.0353159851301115
6252497,1,B00I6JOD8M,"This is quite possibly the worst film of all time.  One would think that with the actors involved, there would be some quality to the acting.  You would be wrong.  The outtakes must be incredibly funny, because none of these actors could have maintained a straight face after uttering such nonsense. The best actor is a horse and he never says anything.  In a futile attempt to be profound, the film takes on the feel of a hopeless funeral dirge in which we can only mourn the loss of two hours of our lives.  The holes in the plot are too many to be accurately counted, so that if you made a drinking game of them, even the most hearty drinkers would likely pass out twenty minutes into the movie.  At least they wouldn't see the rest of it.

6252533,3,B00I6JOD8M,"Back in July of last year I read and reviewed a book by the name of Winters Tale.  This 1983 cult classic by the author Mark Helprin was one of, if not THE, most rewarding reading experiences of my life.  Glistening with such profound insight, backstory and spiritual subtext, this science fiction novel of the supernatural kind was such a surprise for me.  Sitting down and opening up to page one, I had no idea what this story was about.  All I knew was that it had to do with true love, a flying horse and a villain that Russell Crowe was going to be playing in a movie sometime in the near future.

Yes, Crowe was my inspiration for seeking out the novel.

Now, I am not a stranger to the concept that film adaptations of complex novels are just never as good as the novel from which they stemmed, and so I was pretty much aware before I even sat down to watch Winters Tale that it was going to pale in comparison.  I even made mention of that inevitability when I reviewed the novel last year.  I knew halfway through reading this book that there was just no way it could truly capture the grandeur, the majesty and the importance of this truly inspired and revolutionary tale.  I braced myself for epic disappointment, and based on the barrage of truly vitriol reviews, I had a feeling my premonitions were going to prove all too on the nose.

This movie is NOT awful.

Now, Im not saying that Winters Tale is a masterpiece, or even a great film.  Its heavily flawed, and a lot of that has to stem from the fact that the source material is just too complicated for a mere two hour film.  The time allotted to tell this movie is not enough to contain all of the wonders in the story, and quite frankly, some stories are almost tarnished when the visual capacity cannot match the minds eye.  In other words; some of the passages contained in Helprins masterful novel are better left on the printed page.

For me though, the films primary failings stem from writer/director Akiva Goldsman feeling the need to spell everything out for us.  Most of the beauty found in Helprins text comes from the ambiguity of a lot of his subtext; the subtle way he was able to layer so much of the story with such rich spiritual undertones without ever once outright addressing them.  It was all cloaked in such mystery and personal observation/interpretation/application that it became a truly personal experience.  When I put the novel down for the last time, I felt like a changed man.  The film feels too intent on defining Helprins prose, creating a literal adaptation that betrays the stories true contents.  I blame Goldsmans inability to truly understand Helprins book.  This was a passion project for him, and so obviously he loved this story (he pushed very hard to get this made, and even called upon the help from friends Crowe and Smith to put their names behind it in order to get financing), but at the end of the day his approach was too straightforward, too simple and thus the wrong approach to take.

Now, those who have not read the book are probably going to think that everything I said was complete rubbish, since the primary complaint from most filmgoers was that the film was hard to understand/made no sense, but if you read the novel youll see exactly where Goldsman is coming from, and youll understand why I say his approach is too simple.

Add to this the fact that casting Will Smith as Satan was one of the worst ideas Ive ever heard of; ever.

But among all of my personal complaints, I didn't hate this movie.  The romantic aspects of the storyline (the entire first half, basically) is beautifully rendered, and while I took issue with the direction Goldsman took concerning the main plot points, I did like the way he used visuals to alter his viewpoint (particularly with regards to Pearly Soames).  Speaking of visual effects, while they are slight (or at least they may seem so, since they are far from garish), they are mesmerizing.  The way that that white horse floats over the city is just spellbinding.  The performances are hit and miss, with Farrell failing to really delve into the weight of this character (again, I think time got the better of this film in many areas, especially the second half) and Smith fumbling a plum cameo performance pretty epically, but Crowe was effectively evil and Jessica Brown Findlay is quite the find.

At the end of the day, Winters Tale is a very ambitious film that was adapted from a very ambitious novel that failed to deliver on its potential mostly because the films director was just notambitious.",1406332800,3,4573,4.576687116564417

6252536,3,B00I6JOD8M,"In winter's tale, a burglar, Peter Lake, (Farrell) falls for an heiress (Findlay) who is dying from consumption. Peter then sets out to save her only to find that he has enemies standing in his way.

The acting in this is top notch as Farrell and Findlay have good chemistry and play their roles very well.  Russell Crowe as the villain also does a commendable job in the role.  And all the name brand actors that start in smaller roles, William Hurt and Will Smith, for example play their roles very well.  The acting and the quality of the actors are what kept me interested in the movie.

The story is a good one although familiar one as it does take some time to truly get going and get the basics of the story told, it does leave you wondering quite what is going on for the first 30 to 45 minutes for sure.  There are times when the story does feel a bit choppy and could have been done a bit better and there are some plot holes that were a bit overlooked.  Did I miscalculate or would have little Willa been way over 100 years old in 2014?  Not that big of a deal to me, as this is a fantasy tale but a bit of an oversight I thought.  And although I did enjoy this classic good versus evil retelling, the more the movie went on the more predictable it became with a bit of an anti-climatic ending and in the end felt a bit too long at nearly 2 hours.  Maybe it felt that way to me just because it became too predictable at the end with a bit of a subpar climatic battle between good and evil, I am not sure.

Even though with all that, I did find the movie watchable and enjoyed the story overall.  I wouldn't consider this one of the greatest tale of this type but I certainly wouldn't say it was the worst either.  It was certainly worth watching and worthy of 3 and half stars.",1406332800,7,1788,4.132947976878612
6252537,2,B00I6JOD8M,"The movie started out pretty cool but never quite developed into a coherent story. I felt like character development was happening and the plot was being set up throughout the first half, but it just never seemed to come to fruition. The flow of the story seemed to be all over the place and tough to follow. I felt like I was watching Lost, where nothing was really explained. Character development never really happened, even if the guise of it was there at first. You knew Farrell's character loved this woman, but it seemed so rushed and unbelievable. Likewise, Russell Crowe's character hated Farrell's character as much as Farrell loved the woman....but it never felt real as well because the back story just was not there. Crowe overacted his part for sure, you could not even understand half of what he said. The choice for Lucifer was absurd, I won't give it away but rofl....really? The acting overall was pretty bleh, but so was the script so what are they to do?

It is a shame because it seems to be a good story, perhaps I will pick up the book, I have no doubt it is better than the movie.",1406332800,3,1104,4.492537313432836

6252541,3,B00I6JOD8M,"Unknown to most of the world is the battle for good and evil over people's souls. Miracles play a big part in the equation. Peter Lake may be part of that equation without being aware of it himself. Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe) is determined not to let that happen.

The story is interesting story based on a novel by Mark Helprin. For the people that know the novel most movies are not good enough. However without knowing the novel that this movie is based on there is a lot of unanswered references. Unfortunately the version I watch came on a rental disk so it did not have a voice over commentary to explain the unexplainable.

The costumes were well done. The graphics were reasonable without overwhelming the story. The background music matched the feel and did not overwhelm the dialog.

I do not know if it was intentional, however it was fun finding major actors in all the strangest places in the film; Will Smith was just being himself. Jennifer Connelly must have felt that she was back in ""Labyrinth"" (1986.)

I always thought it would be impossible to bring this monumental story to a film and after seeing it I believe that is still true.  It almost might be better not to read the book and get mired down in the choices the director made. Will Smith as Lucifer is utterly ridiculous and unnecessary. Colin Farrell is a decent Peter Lake (except for the ungodly haircut in many scenes) and Russel Crowe is allowed to chew on the furniture a bit too often.

Still, this is a visually compelling effort that deserves a look. It makes you think on several levels and in yet another summer of hopeless idiocy at the theaters, we should all be grateful I suppose.",1406160000,,745,4.384057971014493

and the cast was first rate.  One of the clues as to whether a picture is as awful as the one star reviewers suggest is to see what percentage of the total reviews are one star.  Most films on this website or IMDB or Netflix receive about 2 to 5% one star reviews by those who have
seen it.  Winter's tale has nearly 20% ones.  That should tell you something.",1405555200,5,492,4.247311827956989

It was interesting, well done, you cared about the characters...but the second part seemed rushed, they just didn't take the time to make you care about the new characters. There was not enough of a relationship established between the characters for what ended up happening to happen. Yes, to enjoy the movie you have to be willing to suspend reality, believe in angels and demons, but that's what makes it fun. I just wish the ending could have been done better.

However, when it comes to light that the actual reason he won't die is because he has to perform a miracle on a girl with cancer, I laughed out loud.  The combination of odd winged horses, poor acting, strange illnesses, weird plot-points, hundred-year-old newspaper editors, and worst of all, Will Smith as satan, left me entirely speechless.... In a bad way.  Do not watch this movie.

However this movie has no character development so the audience isn't emotionally invested in any of performers or their plights.  This had promise, but it's a NO for me.  Too cheesy and poorly written script.  I gave it two stars because Colin Farrell is beautiful, so at least I got to watch his hotness prance around the screen for the duration of the dull movie.

Its a complex story that is not easily reduced to a screen play and the compromises needed to bring it to the movie screen. Like Peter Jackson's treatment of J. R. R. Tolkien's  stories there will always be something missing and something added. That being said I found this an enchanting movie which was far more than just a standard romance. It distilled the essence of Peter Lake & Beverly's enduring love & its reach into the future to affect another life. I would recommend reading the book before seeing the movie, I personally reread it every year (in the winter of course) to get the connections between all the characters & how they have been reduced to fit this medium.

6252713,3,B00I6JOD8M,"I read the book in '83 and loved it.  It seemed like a mashup of Ayn Rand with pinches of G.K. Chesterton, Greek mythology, and the Keystone Cops thrown in.  Helprin's version of magical realism; I'm a fan.  I thought for years about what a movie version would look like.

This wasn't it.

Not to say it's a 'bad' movie.  It's well-written, brilliantly shot, beautifully designed and features a compelling score.  But Colin Farrell is just not Peter Lake as I would have envisioned him from the book. Nor does Jessica Findlay match the description of Beverly Penn. Russell Crowe is workable as Pearly Soames, but the whole treatment of the Short Tails failed for me.  And where was Jackson Mead?  Hello? Major charactor?  Finally, as much as I hate to say this, I'm growing bored with Will Smith, the 'movie star'.

One more rant:  The whole demon/Lucifer concept was a fail, as is Hollywood's perception that they have to spoon feed the finer points of allegory to the wallowing masses.

Overall, 'Winter's Tale' is a nice love story that's vaguely reminiscent of 'Winter's Tale', but it's NOT Winter's Tale.  I'm guessing we'll have to wait about 10 years before someone takes a crack at a remake.  And that's why I'm going back to the book.",1404777600,2,1243,4.689814814814815

6252759,5,B00I6JOD8M,"Writer/director/producer Akiva Goldman has adapted Mark Helprin's 1983 novel for the screen and has made it even more a work of magical realism than the book alone. The film is stunning to watch, the story has many levels of meaning that embrace the such topics as immortality, good versus evil, miracles, death and dying and transcendent love, and it is cast with a collection of superb actors who take us with them through this fantasy of time and love and redemption.

There are many meaningful passages of dialogue, but one that Beverly offers is the essence of the story: ``We are all connected. Each baby born carries a miracle inside. A unique purpose and that miracle is promised to one person and one person alone. We are voyagers set on a course towards destiny, to find the one person our miracle is meant for. But be warned: as we seek out the light, darkness gathers and the eternal contest between good and evil is not fought with great armies... But one life at a time.'

One summary is excellent: `New York City is subsumed in arctic winds, dark nights, and white lights, its life unfolds, for it is an extraordinary hive of the imagination, the greatest house ever built, and nothing exists that can check its vitality. One night in winter, Peter Lake (Colin Farrell), orphan and master-mechanic, attempts to rob a fortress-like mansion on the Upper West Side. Though he thinks the house is empty, the daughter of the house is home. Thus begins the love between Peter, a middle-aged Irish burglar, and Beverly Penn (Jessica Brown Findlay), a young girl, who is dying. A burglar falls for an heiress as she dies in his arms. When he learns that he has the gift of reincarnation, he sets out to save her.' The film moves from early 1895 where parents (Matt Bomer and Lucy Griffiths) being refused entry into America set their infant son in a little boat to send him to America. We then are in 1914 when the above action occurs - colored by the shenanigans of Judge/Lucifer (Will Smith) and the evil Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe). Later we follow the still living and unchanged Peter Lake to 2014, joined by Virginia Gamely (Jennifer Connelly) as he completes his miracle of saving the life of a younger redhead. A magnificent white horse plays a major role; Eva Marie Saint, William Hurt and other supporting actors are excellent. The musical score concentrates on Brahms, Berlioz, Khachaturian and others during the film - but someone opted to place a pop tune during the credits that is completely devoid of any of the graceful mystery of the film.

When it does use it's wings it flies like a bat.
Then there are people's souls/spirits that we find out are really stars in the night sky -  a way overused literary device or hook in literature and film.
Our lead character, for some not clear reason, seems to be able to live forever (OK, has to fill a task - whose is not clear), and fortunately they chose a popular age for his newly acquired gift. Oh, in the beginning is the undeveloped subplot of his parents forced to leave the country because dad doesn't have good lungs. While leaving they put their son (the future ""live forever"" star) into a model boat and put him adrift in the ocean. What happens to him after that was never clearly explained.
Added to this is an angel (no wings); a devil (African American) and his evil understudy who likes to be a petty thief and has petty grievances with our ""live forever"" star who also was a petty thief.
Also tossed into the movie are prism like light beams that are suppose to represent another dimension of connectivity between, well, everything.
Finally, there are two red headed girls who are suppose to be so significant that the evil understudy wants to kill either or both - not clear which or why. Well, supposedly they have something to do with the devil not wanting humans to have hope.

6252770,4,B00I6JOD8M,"This movie was so beautifully filmed.

 It  came across as a charming adult fairy tale, but with enough grittiness in the plot and characters to not to put the menfolk to sleep while watching it.

Unfortunately, the original book written decades ago, is quite a tome, and so the story is very involved, with complex situations and characters.

There is also a spiritual/metaphysical bent to the theme of the story and, fortunately, some of that manages to be captured here on film.

Martin Scorsese brought the rights to the film( from what I understand) and then, he wisely understood how there was no way a movie could do justice to the book- it would  be tremendously difficult to condense such a story into a reasonable amount of film time.

While all the actors are fantastic in their roles, and the cinematography is breathtaking, so many things were lost in this effort to bring the book to screen.

2/3rds of the  movie is magical to watch, even if not totally following the book.

(You are getting the skeleton of the book here and a bit disjointed at that,as not all is in order)

 Because you are enchanted by what you are watching- initially- you cut that fact slack, because you get sucked into this lovely, gorgeous but adulterated/abbreviated version of the story.

 So,  visually,  you really enjoy this movie until the last 3rd, when it takes a large turn in the story line.

Those who will be most disappointed in the movie plot, are the ones who read the book it was based on.

Those who never read the book will see this as a movie that started off with promise and sort of withers away.

Still watchable- but there may be confusion,questions- even some questioning how the book could have been that good.

In truth- the book is good if wordy!

It just does not translate easily to screen.

So if you never read the book, enjoy what you can out of this feature.

While it never touches all the magic and emotion that the book offers a reader- there is still much here to enjoy, so enjoy it!",1404345600,3,2010,4.534818941504178

Mark Helprin is an extraordinary writer, with a strong command of language and a remarkable ability to weave together numerous characters and complex plots with mastery and beauty.  It was a book I didn't want to end and after it did, I wanted to read it again.  I was mesmerized by the wonder of it's mystical quality coupled with a powerful realistic representation of  New York City during the era it depicts.  I did not feel the same connection with the movie.  Although the acting is good, the movie falls short on capturing the true essence of the book.  The movie has taken one facet of the book and expanded upon it, but in doing so, has also diluted significant factors that created the impact of this piece of the story.  The movie completely omitted significant facets of the story that truly were the lifeblood of it's message.  In addtion, it has not fully developed some of the characters.  These shortcomings, collectively, provide a mere whisper of the epic quality provied in the book.  Personally, I feel the movie does a disservice to Mr. Helprin's genius.

Colin Farrell's character falls in love with Jessica's after seeing after her for about 10 seconds and his horse can conveniently fly whenever he's cornered.

The movie, however, takes so many shortcuts, leaves out so many plot twists, sub-plots, characters and great quotes that it really only vaguely resembles the book. Which would be bad enough but then it decides to undermine the story with this tired old play on angels and demons. I'm surprised they didn't throw a vampire or a werewolf in there too. Maybe they were left on the editing room floor...

If you've never read the book and you like that kind of 2 dimensional story-telling then this will be worth the 4 bucks to rent it. If you have read the book then I would only recommend it to you as a strange rendition of something artful, like a book report written by someone who didn't read the book but overheard the plot being discussed on the subway in their second, imperfectly understood, language.

6252845,4,B00I6JOD8M,"WINTER'S TALE is a slightly hokey, but thoughtful, tale about love and miracles with gentle performances by Colin Farrell, Jessica Findlay Brown and Jennifer Connelly. Based on a novel by Mark Helprin, the story is about a man named Peter Lake, a thief with mysterious beginnings who falls in love with a woman whose house he sets out to rob. He's also accompanied by a flying white horse, and being pursued by his former employer, Pearly Soames, played with gusto by Russell Crowe. I would describe the plot a little more, but it's hard to go into too much detail without giving everything away. Suffice it to say, there's a lot of talk about light, stars, destiny and miracles. And also, if it wasn't already apparent from the get-go, this movie takes place in a fantastical version of reality in which angels and demons exist in human form, and seek to influence the world around them. I thought that the movie did a good job of establishing the fictional world in which this takes place, even though not everything is explained in great detail. Of course, not everything needs to be explained to death anyway, and I appreciate that this film didn't dwell too much on needless exposition. The film can be divided into two parts: one that takes place in 1916, and the second half in present-day. The setting doesn't change, but a select few characters exist in both time periods, for reasons best left for the viewer to find out on their own. At its heart this is a love story, and a fairly compelling one at that. Enough time is given to the development of the central relationship to make it feel believable, even though it begins quite surreptitiously. In general, I felt like the film was emotionally moving in all the right ways, and had a nice story arc. However, despite the good (yet unorthodox) story, there were a few things which let me down. First of all, Russell Crowe seemed miscast as the main villain. He chews the scenery in an awkward way, and puts on a ridiculous Irish accent. John Hurt also has a small role as Colin Farrell's girlfriend's father, and I felt like he gave a poor performance, or at least one that didn't live up to the good performances around him. And although not bad, per se, there was an unexpected cameo which kind of felt out of place. I went into this film knowing who it was, but it would be better for the viewer to go in without such knowledge. In terms of technical quality, the cinematography was decent, but nothing outstanding and the visual effects were also passable, although a little bit cheesy. I, however, did like the score and incidental music they used. It accentuated the material quite nicely and helped to punctuate emotional moments during the film. I also liked the song ""Miracle"" which played during the closing credits. Overall, I thought this was a decent directorial debut from Akiva Goldsman, who doesn't have the greatest record as a writer (and also wrote and produced this film). The magical realism was something fresh to me, and an antidote from lots of movies that try too hard to be ""realistic."" The story was something easy to get behind, even if it did resort to cliche at times. And despite the shortcomings, this is something I can recommend, if only because it tries hard enough to stand out.",1403913600,2,3276,4.65

After fuming over my disappointment over the movie and thinking about it over and over, I was so disappointed....it made me think about the movie even more.  The more I thought .... I need to see it again... So watching it again from a different perspective than expecting a happily ever after changed my opinion altogether.

6252861,3,B00I6JOD8M,"This movie is stunning in bits and pieces, the core themes od ""good verses evil"" and ""eternal love"" are at time very clear and discernible, other parts of the film take the viewer to scenes that are confounding and lack clarity.

The character Colin Farrell plays ""Peter Lake"" appears to be completely overwhelmed by time, circumstance, and a mysterious  red-haired woman hes destined to save, yet not the one he falls hopelessly in love with, but a small child nearly 100 years later when Jennifer Connelly and said red-haired girl appear to just walk into his life as he's furiously drawing a picture of a red-haired woman in on the sidewalks in Manhattan's Central Park. Its unclear whether he time travels or just has a penchant for not aging.
Appearances by Russell Crowe and Will Smith as the forces of evil, which for reasons unknown are perpetually out for Peter Lake and his female counterpart fail to make a lot of sense of their  Where Pegasus comes into play in the grand scheme of things makes about as much sense as dropping Tarzan into an Ironman film. Great role by the trained horse, but what ""Horse's"" connection is to Peter Lake is sort of an enigma, but it an interesting addition to the film, a flying horse that capable of saving Peter Lake from the clutches of the villains cast as black derby wearing thugs that work for Russell Crowe.  I would encourage everyone to watch this movie, in particular the romantics like myself who believe that love conquers all and that it is timeless, regardless of a poorly developed film script, an absence of plot or miscast characters and a ""winged horse"" like Pegasus in mythology.",1403740800,,1643,4.714285714285714

6252868,5,B00I6JOD8M,"I saw this with my husband on opening day. I personally love fairy tales and fantasy, but he does not particularly, yet we both took away the same idea from this film, and both enjoyed it very much. The whole point is we are connected as creatures in a whole universe, as spiritual things and not just physical. (Much like Star Wars, actually, only without the zooming space ships). There is good and evil at war, with rules of a sort, and love and hope are powerful weapons against evil. The movie gives life to the idea that we are capable of amazing things, miracles even, though we don't necessarily know when, who, how, but each action creates a ripple, and a good action makes a powerful one that inspires more good, as an evil one does. If more people thought about that, that butterfly effect on others of each action, it'd be a better world.

Colin Farrell is a seriously underrated actor. He has a complete grasp of emotional portrayals, is fearless in showing his heart on his sleeve when the role suits, and this one does. Jessica Findlay's delicate yet strong beauty is a wonderful contrast to Colin's more rugged and rough charm, they have a very real chemistry that was lovely to watch. Critics who loved the book complain that this romance is a tiny part of the book, but perhaps the book, IMO, belabors the points it tries to make: I got them fully from a two hour movie. Russell Crowe's villainous demon is appropriately nasty, and while his accent isn't Irish, it IS at least consistently something and I thought him just the perfect casting of smug maliciousness. I am less enamoured of Will Smith as Satan, though he played the part well. It just seemed odd in this movie.

The cinematography is beautiful, the story unfolds like a flower opening. One has to pay careful attention to detail. I left the theatre determined to own this the instant it came out. And to never read the book.",1403481600,6,1907,4.556851311953353

Really enjoyed the depictions of Elis Island and Grand Central Station.  The ease with which the screen writers take you back and forth in time makes it easy for the viewer to keep track of the underlying themes, times and characters in this movie.  The cinematography is ""dream-like,"" and fits the meaning and purpose of the story like a glove - I was captivated by Colin Ferrell's character, and have never seen him better in any of his past films.

6252874,4,B00I6JOD8M,"Mark Helprin's monumental 750 page Winters Tale abounds with beautifully penned dream-like prose, painting his gritty hard-edged commonplace with strokes of luminous narrative that is often moving and frequently masterful. He populates the story with wonderful characters and is eloquent at getting the reader into their heads and on board with their cares. Alas, behind all its magic the book is frustratingly thinly plotted and as in many over-long dreams, characters with whom the reader has journeyed far and grown to care for wind up on a glowing, seemingly endless fade-out into a disjointed and muddled conclusion.
The film does much better. The film makers have done an admirable job of distilling a coherent and comparatively sensible plot line and keeping many of the best characters in place, while still nicely suffusing the film with the book's glow of magic. The first part of the film, set in the early 20th century works really well (though the cameo with Will Smith as the devil is pretty strange). The latter half, set in the present is less good, as there is a sense of being in the final stretch and as though the filmmakers were feeling pressured to get through to the end of the story, which results in an unfortunate under utilization of Jennifer Connely's amazing talent. Trying to compress this epic into one film seems to have been too much, and it might have worked better to have done Winters Tale in two installments.
The onscreen chemistry between Colin Farrell's character Peter Lake and Jessica Brown Findley's Beverley is great and their story in the film version is far more solidly plotted and satisfying than in the book. The performances they turn in are wonderful, once you stop noticing Colin Farrell's uber-weird period haircut.
Jessica Brown Findley of Downton Abbey wins best in show, hands down. Her amazing onscreen presence is nothing short of heart-stopping, and she manages to perfectly bring to life the Beverly that Helprin describes in the book: ""She was so marvelous that, when he tried to think of her, her description rolled away from him like a dropped coin, and all that was left was a feeling of joy.""",1403136000,7,2157,4.928571428571429

That may seem like a small gripe but the film is predicated on the idea of miracles.

6252894,3,B00I6JOD8M,"Winter's Tale... promises all sorts of amazing fantasy flair but deliver's pulled punches at the end of the day. It's core is the war between good and evil and we are treated to an interesting perspective of demon's and their territorial rule under their great leader Satan himself. The idea of angels seems to be a side note and although Russell Crowe's character Pearly mentions them in the trailer in reference to Peter Lake (Colin Farrell) I am not sure that line was actually in the movie (I was distracted at times by my popcorn). Cecil Mature (Maurice Jones) who acts as a friend to Peter (Farrell) is obviously some sort of fantasy character and probably meant to be an angel but I missed where that was made apparent. There is a white horse that is a spirit guide that also flies  though, so that's something to get excited about right? Didn't we just see this same spirit guide in The Lone Ranger, standing in a tree?
To be frank you are not going to be inspired by this love story. It is not compelling. If you were like me and were dooped by the trailer where Farrell says he is robbing the place and then gets invited to tea... you will be sadly disappointed. That was the extent of how clever this plot gets. If there had been some exciting fight scenes I might have jacked up the star allotment but that was limited too.
I give Crowe full points on being a New Zealander who pulls off the Irish Brogue but he is no Brad Pitt playing a Pikey. If you have the money and time to waste on a fantasy love story that I dare you not to yawn through then see it. If you value your time and prefer not to waste your money... wait until this comes out on Prime for free or someone else pays for the rental.
