3086528,2,B0012DUCFW,"Not one of my favorite documentaries. Much to do about a paddle boat and some sights, limited info regarding the dam itself. Some interest, short enough",1444521600,,152,4.884615384615385
3086529,1,B0012DUCFW,Tells you nothing about the dam and little about the lake. It mostly seems to be a promo for a particular boat ride.,1443225600,,116,4.086956521739131

3086532,1,B0012DUCFW,"So so.  Been there many times, but still expected to learn something new.  Out of date info, boring.  Sorry.  But I wouldn't watch it again.",1416441600,,140,4.48
3086533,1,B0012DUCFW,I think amazon should provide a newer higher quality version of this informational video.  It would be much more appealing that way.,1398902400,,132,5.0
3086534,2,B0012DUCFW,"If you're interested in hydrology or the ecological hubris of building dams on rivers in deserts, this can be interesting.  The film was likely (no date on it) shot in the mid 1980s, when the lake Mead levels were over 100 feet higher than now and the lake volume over twice what it is now.

This short film is really about taking a particular Las Vegas tourist side trip, but that gives you just enough info for some amusing follow up:  turn on your google maps and search for the Lake Mead Marina (this boat, the Desert Princess, still makes this tour from there) and check out what the area looks like now.  For the record, according to the 2011 doc film Last Call at the Oasis, Lake Mead came to within 38 feet of dead pool at its lowest point (probably Nov of 2010).  The height of the water in this film (note the height of water relative to the turbine intake towers) is probably around 1215-1220 feet. (Record height was ~1226 or so in 1983).  The lake now (early 2014) is around 1105-1110 feet.",1389312000,,1003,4.365591397849462
3086535,1,B0012DUCFW,This was one of the very worst tourist videos I have seen.  It is 11 minutes talking about touring on Lake Mead on a paddle boat.  There is brief mention of the Hoover Dam.  It was not worth my time.  I am appalled that such a misleading title can be on Amazon Prime.  Don't you watch the stuff you list?,1364947200,,304,4.0
3086536,2,B0012DUCFW,"This was shot mostly about Lake Mead. There is not much information about Hoover Dam. This must have been shot around 1999-2000 era, because there is very little of the white ring around the lake. It is interesting to see the lake nearly full. Right now, as of this review, the lake is much lower and has a white calcium carbonate ring that is about 11 stories tall. It is interesting from a historical perspective, to see what the lake looks like then as apposed to now. When they actually get to the dam, it looks like they just took a tour and there really is nothing insightful, they you cannot find on the internet, already and you can probably learn more from taking a tour of the dam. This production is really no more than a travel postcard with a British narrator. If you can watch it for free, please do so. It is neat to see Lake Mead that full. I would not recommend it to purchase. By the way, contrary to what the host says, most of the electricity generated from Hoover Dams generators, is sent to the greater Los Angeles area. The Las Vegas casinos get little to none of the electricity produced out of the generators. Also, in the film, the narrator says that electricity is produced from 17 turbines. It is actually produced by 17 generators. There are turbines, but turbines are just a part of the generators. You need water to turn the turbines. The turbines are attached to a rotor. The turbines spin the rotors inside a stator and that produces electricity. It is similar to saying that cement and concrete are the same. You need cement, water and aggregate to produce concrete.",1358035200,,1600,4.501718213058419

3086538,1,B0012DUCFW,This is more of a promo for tourism than a documentary.  I learned nothing.  I have amazon prime so I did not have to pay for it.  I'd be hoppin' mad if I actually spent money on this thing.,1355875200,,190,3.8205128205128207

3086540,1,B0012DUCFW,"I actually did know that this DVD was only 10 minutes in length before I ordered it, so I'm not complaining about that. I'm fascinated by Hoover Dam and its history, and have read as many books and watched as many films about the dam as I can find.  I thought perhaps there was something here I hadn't yet seen, and I do have to admit that was true in a way.

Nearly all of the ten minute footage consists of the Pacific Princess paddle wheel boat cruising Lake Mead.  The few shots of the dam are brief, and mosty overexposed.  However, we do get some nice views of people boarding the boat, sitting in deck chairs, and looking at the wildlife. I didn't know that you could take a paddle wheel trip on Lake Mead, so I can't say I didn't learn anything new LOL!

The Pacific Princess people should give this DVD away as promo material, but I hope nobody else shells out $9.99 for it.",1253491200,,883,4.232142857142857

This spent 6 minutes showing you the lake and paddleboat then about 2 minutes with a few snapshots of the actual dam itself. I've been to Hoover Dam as a kid and remember more from 40 years ago live visit than this ever even thought to document.
