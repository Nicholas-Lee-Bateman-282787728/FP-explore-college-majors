First off, the band performance of CTA is great. Danny sounds as good as he ever has, and he has managed to surround himself with some outstanding musicians who bring a fresh sound to the music of Chicago. After seeing this dvd I would much prefer seeing CTA in concert over Chicago. There are several other great performances as well. I found Stewart Copland's band, Gizmo, to be very interesting. They had a really different sound, although Stewart's drumming sounded like Stewart's drumming. Steve Smith played with his band, Jazz Legacy, and showed once again what an incredibily versatile and talented drummer he is. Mike Mangini, though he played with recorded tracks, also demonstrated that he too is a excellent drummer of many different styles. Thomas Lang and Dave Dicenso both gave blistering drum solos, though demonstrated through very different approaches. Jason McGerr had his drumset assembled on stage as he played through the entire assembly process.

The educational portion of this dvd is found throughout the performances as well as the interviews. First, the performances provide camera angles of the drummers, and their technics, that can be watched over and over again. Since this dvd features drummers, the drummers get tons of camera time. Second, the interviews, followed up by actual drum demonstrations are invaluable.

As a drummer of about 38 years, I can't stress how valuable this dvd is as a learing tool and motivation for a young drummer. Spend the money. It's worth it.",1187568000,4,1769,4.89
2818494,5,B000PFU9CO,"Excellent range in styles performed (moreso than the previous ones).  The quality of footage is awesome and I would highly recommend this to any drummer of any ability, however the intermediate to advanced drummers would benefit more from this video.  Buy it here, because Modern Drummer charges more for it.",1186617600,,308,5.14

8191130,2,B000PFU9CO,"A few parts that shine on this DVD but overall it didn't do much for me. I'm more of a song drummer and I enjoy seeing drummers playing in the context of a band/ensemble rather than alone.

Ronald Bruner Jr: He definitely has some virtuostic technique. I wasn't crazy about his overall approach to playing along w/tracks. I know he's played w/Kenny Garrett. Would like to see what he can do in that setting.

Jason McGerr: My favorite part. He starts with just a snare drum and adds in the rest of the kit as his tech brings it out. He's got a nice groove and a great sounding ludwig kit. Even still, I'd rather see him play with his band, Death Cab for Cutie.

R&B Gospel Summit: Teddy Campbell and Marvin McQuitty are good players and it's cool to watch them navigate their tunes. Aaron Spears plays way over the barline. These guys are going for big fills most of the time. I think that can be cool when done sparingly. In this case, it's a little too much icing on the cake, at least for me. I'm aware that with the advent of 'backing tracks' in live settings, that this kind of playing is becoming the norm for live R&B/Gospel.

Glenn Kotche: Cool if you like multi-percussion. My fav part is when he plays a Wilco tune.

Thomas Lang is doing his Thomas Lang thing. Big kit, lots of independence, and technique. If you're into him, I think you'll enjoy. Luis Conte joins him on latin percussion but I didn't think they had a strong musical connection. Thomas' interview w/Steve Smith is cool.

Stewart Copeland: This was the other part I liked. It's good to see him playing with his side project, a band from Italy. He's still a bruiser and his playing is exciting in this setting.

If you really like watching these MD festivals you may have a better experience than I did. I'm just at the point, after having seen so many of these, that I get more out of listening to music, rather than watching drummers.",1207180800,2,1912,4.4147727272727275
