4858137,5,B005QBN1FO,Yvonne De Carlo has always be one of my favorite actresses and I think she did a wonderfully funny job in this movie.,1364256000,2,117,4.130434782608695
4858138,4,B005QBN1FO,I've seen this moview a few times.  I like it.  It's typical of older westerns.  I also collect old westerns and would like to latch on to a copy of this one.,1334275200,,158,3.875
4858139,4,B005QBN1FO,"I agree with a previous reviewer that Frontier Gal is an odd,but interesting western. I do recommend it. It is among many of the recently released westerns from the Universal vault that I saw on encore movies. I had never seen it before. Frontier Gal really is a first class ""B"" western with Rod Cameron,Yvonne Decarlo,Andy Devine(playing a similar character from the Roy Rogers westerns),Fuzzy Knight,Sheldon Leonard and a few other recognizable  character actors from other Bs.
What stood out for me is it's sense of fun,gorgeous and beautifully photographed scenery,great running inserts and hilariously staged chases;saloon brawls, fights between the hero(Cameron) and the saloon woman owner(DeCarlo)who he is forced to marry unwillingly. She is extremely independent,brash,petulant and spoiled, but she has a big heart. There is a major shootout between the townspeople and the villains. I cannot say enough about the colorful costumes of the bar girls  and the technicolor work mastered by Natalie Kalmus. This movie is just fun to watch and partake of the hijinks. It is not a serious western,but what boys and girls in enjoyed in saturday matinees in the 40's and 50's.

Another delight is a young girl,Mary Ann, played by Beverly Simmons. She plays the daughter of Cameron and Decarlo. She steals every scene she is in and you cannot take your eyes off of her. She has her mother's traits and plays well off of the adult characters. There are no other kids in the film. Odd,but interesting. Highly Recommend.",1321574400,15,1517,5.108870967741935
4858140,3,B005QBN1FO,"This is one of the oddest old- time Westerns I have
seen, then and now.  Firstly, it's in great color
for a small flick, and the ""heroine"" wears designer
gowns fit for a Ziegfeld girl. However, the movie
features Sheldon Leonard as a bad guy, and Rod
Cameron and Yvonne De Carlo as very mixed-up lovers. De Carlo owns a saloon, swanks around in
would-be whore's wardrobe, and shoots a lot. It's
so bad, one has to wonder how it all came about.
Lot's of money spent, attempt to build a masculine
hero in Cameron, and dub an operatic voice for De
Carlo,but it comes up empty on all counts.",1320278400,4,587,4.336363636363636

4858142,3,B005QBN1FO,Not nearly as good as RIVER LADY. Same leads. Image quality crisp but color is iffy. I suspect that these Technicolor films are actually Eastmancolor prints.,1427673600,,157,5.076923076923077
4858143,5,B005QBN1FO,"After seeing 'Salome, Where She Danced' with Yvonne de Carlo & Rod Cameron - I decided to purchase this DVD & it is now one of my top 5 favorite westerns. Wonderful story!

4858147,4,B005QBN1FO,"Westerns have always been my favorite movies. When I was ten years back in 45,I fell in love with the theme music to Frontier Gal.have tried for years to obtain this movie,but was unavailable till just a few years ago,but am enjoying it now. Great copy of original,  Thanks  Jack Thomasson",1412899200,,289,4.647058823529412
4858148,5,B005QBN1FO,"This is an excellent western .It  was made in 1945 and the soundtrack and picture are excellent. I am a collector of westerns and also a fan of both leading actors.so maybe I am biased. It is a comedy/western which is well worth viewing,if you can find it. It would not be p.c.acceptable in todays films,but is an excellent film for western viewers and is someyhing different.recommended viewing.",1392336000,2,396,4.823529411764706

4858150,1,B005QBN1FO,"I can't really review a product that never arrived. However, rating of the seller petemi78 should be 0. I sent 2 e-mails to the seller petemi78 (through  Amazon) regarding the fact that the ordered product never arrived but the seller did not even bother to answer my e-mails. This seller did not have any way of tracking the shipping and therefore I did not have any means of knowing where the ordered product would be. I did not have any recourse but to notify my credit card not to pay for something that was not received. This was really very disappointing since I've had previous products that I bought through Amazon before without any problems. Now I am wary about any order that does not have any shipping tracking system as this seller did not have..",1364947200,,759,4.580882352941177
8483095,3,B005QBN1FO,Saw this movie in my youth and was excited to see it again. The chavinistic themes are uncomfortable at times and not nearly as cute a story as I remembered. Easy to see why the stars used to get so frustrated with the material that the studio forced on them. But I enjoyed the nostalgic trip down memory lane and Yvonne De Carlo was so beautiful.,1529020800,,347,4.2727272727272725
8483096,4,B005QBN1FO,In the beginning of this movie I fpund to be watchable.  Neither Rod Cameron or Yvonne de Carlo on my favorite actor or actress list.  But in th middle of the movie where the door opens ans on walk MARY ANN. the movie became alive for me.  I think this little girl stole the movie from Rod and Yvonne.  I truly enjoyed seeing her on screen and that is why I am buying the DVD.  probably one of the best child actor /actress I've ever seen.  Adorable to the 10th degree.,1528243200,,469,4.0989010989010985
