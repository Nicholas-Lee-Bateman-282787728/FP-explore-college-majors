2534938,5,B000EU1Q3Q,"I couldn't think of a better title. Superman will soon race across our TV screens in color. I always thought this method of the flying sequences was more convincing than the Black and White's version of the glow around the body float. I'm only talking about the flying. Don't get me wrong the B&W Eps are superior in drama and storytelling but the color episodes are adventurous and fun. So no matter what,Superman is always great to watch over and over again. Seasons 3-6 only had 13 episodes each. So the combining of the 2 seasons will maintain packaging integrity.",1142121600,34,568,4.69

2534949,5,B000EU1Q3Q,"In the 1950's America, there was so little information desemenated, so little education about government and finance, so very litttle intuitive freedom and perhaps a jaded bigotry which if not fully understood by white america; It was Appreciated by nonwhites. Most importantly was the respect given by kids to adults in those days. And it was not a good thing to be born out of wedlock, divorced or sentenced to death in a court of law because in those days you had no appeal past the supreme court or for the majority the court of public opinion.
This Series of Superman magnified those concepts; It was in the same ""vien"" (sic. the producers) as ""Leave it to Beaver"" and ""Father Knows Best"" bygone principles because it lacked inclusiveness for minorities. This was at least 8 or 9 years before Dr. King's ""I've got a Dream"" speech. But I digress and will shut my big mouth to finalize that this is essential television that millions of baby boomers will subscribe.",1479168000,,968,4.733727810650888

2534954,5,B000EU1Q3Q,This is the Superman I grew up watching and really enjoyed it. George Reeves is the Superman to beat. He made believing a man could fly was possible. No one else took off and landed in such a believable way. It was great to see it in color. These were filmed in color when they were made even though they could only be broadcast in Black and White. It was a marvelous treat to see them in color. Great clean fun to watch with my children (8&6). My little girl wanted color and was very happy when we started watching the color ones. I wish reporters today were as honest in their reporting and tenacious at getting to the truth. Great shows.,1474156800,4,641,4.262295081967213

2534999,3,B000EU1Q3Q,"BOTTOM LINE: With this and the remaining seasons of the series you have to check you brain at the door and just enjoy them as light-hearted fluff entertainment. When viewed in that context, they're harmless gee-whiz fun. Held up the first two seasons though, the quality & content of these later seasons pales in comparison. 3 modest but honest STARS for these later, lesser (yet still fun) adventures of The Man of Steel.

THOUGHTS: Show sponsor Kellogg's didn't like the harder tone of the first season, insisting series' creative team lighten the overall mood and make it more kid-friendly. Season Two still had some excellent adult-themed episodes, despite watering down the 'violence' that had many parents uptight. Then comes Season Three (the first broadcast in full COLOR). George Reeves had packed on a few pounds in the interim and Kent's glasses have real lenses in them now. Sadly, Lois Lane accelerates her downward spiral into a prime candidate for ""most-dimwitted 'Ace Reporter' in newspaper history"" with each succeeding show. (I place the blame squarely on listless cookie-cutter writing, not actress Noel Neil.) All the actors seemed to start taking their roles less seriously, (though Reeves wisely kept his Supes a ramrod straight pillar of fatherly virtue and gentle advice).

The scripts were instantly dumbed down for S:3, as right out of the gate we get the goofy time-travel/caveman episode ""Through the Time Barrier"" and other blatant nonsense, like the abysmally stupid ""The Bully of Dry Gulch."" Egad. And in this season the show's writers start utilizing Superman's Kryptonite weakness big time. It seems like every other crook in Metropolis has access to truckloads of the stuff. And speaking of which... the bad guys? *Sigh* They are no longer much of a menace - to anyone - and irritating goofball characters like Professor Pepperwinkle were brought in to give the whole affair a more comfortable feel for the younger kiddies. The repetition of stock footage starts to become glaringly apparent here as well. Every scene showing Kent slipping into that storage closet is the same two shots, recycled over and over and over again: one with and one without his hat. (Sometimes the film editors didn't even bother to make sure the right clip was used; showing him leaving his office with no hat on, then cutting to the clip of him headed to the closet WITH a fedora on, looking around quickly to make sure no one is watching, whipping the hat off and ducking inside! LOL.)

THE DVDs: The good news is that the track record of top shelf quality established with the release of the first two seasons continues here. The episodes for this S:3/S:4 combo set all look & sound good; focus is sharp and the audio is mostly clean, clear & level. The inclusion of three additional bonus featurettes ups the value for this 5-disc boxset. Recommended viewing for anyone still in touch with their inner child.

2535006,3,B000EU1Q3Q,"This show pretty fun to watch but by the 3rd/4th seasons, it starts getting a bit repetitive, with only few episodes offering anything new or different. The first episode in this set was especially retarded. They have this scientist who pulls a ""time machine"" out of a box and when he activates it, everyone standing around it is sent back in time to the prehistoric days. If that's not stupid enough, no one even wonders how Superman just happens to be there too! Clearly an episode for very small children.

And why doesn't anyone close Clark Kent know he's Superman? when even an idiot would know he's Superman in civilian clothing. I thought newspaper people were supposed to be smart! Could it be they might just be playing along with him or something?

At the same time, what's with that office building?!! This show features like a huge office building that the 4 main characters work in, yet there doesn't seem to be anyone else working there! What kind of newspaper office is this for cryin' out loud!!! What an excessive waste of space! How can a metropolitan newspaper be run efficiently with only 4 people working there?!! If it were a small town newspaper that might make sense; but then again a small town paper won't require such a highrise building as its headquarters....

The first two seasons may lead one to ignore some of this show's idiocies, but by the time we get to this set those things just become too noticeable. You also wonder how grown adults can stand to be made asses of year after year like this by acting out these parts! No wonder George Reeves shot himself afterward!

Anyway, I'm sorry. I'm just speaking my two-sense. I just couldn't hold it in anymore! Buy it if you want to, but it won't be as watchable as the previous two seasons.",1415664000,3,1773,4.60126582278481

2535008,5,B000EU1Q3Q,"This is the season that made several big changes. The most noticeable change was that producer Whitney Ellsworth thought ahead and believed that Superman would last much longer in syndication by filming in the show in COLOR. This was a brilliant move for 1954. Actually, I truly cannot think of ANY other series that was filmed in color this early in TV history. Unfortunately, the other big change was in the storylines. This is the beginning of episodes that truly were for kids rather than kids and adults. The first episode of the series is 'Through the Time Barrier'. The title sounded like it could have been a very good episode but, alas, it played out as an example of what many episodes would be like in these color episodes. It was a very silly episode which only had two redeeming qualities: It guest starred the great and last appearance of Sterling Holloway. The other plus is that we actually get to see Noel Neil with a very short skirt that shows off her good looking legs! However,this is still a great series with a great cast. And I am not really saying the show went into the tank, either. Even though the episodes were silly, there were still some outstanding episodes. One of my favorites was a very humorous gem called 'Flight to the North' starring a very young Chuck Conners. Other fun episodes were 'Great Ceasar's Ghost' where Perry White finally comes face to face with the person he has been calling for throughout the series, or does he? Others are 'Superman Week' which is actually a sequel to the second season episode 'The Defeat of Superman'. Still others are 'Olsen's Millions', 'Clark Kent Outlaw', 'The Bully of Dry Gulch', 'The Seven Souvenirs' as well as fourth season episodes 'The Big Freeze', 'Topsy Turvy', 'Jimmy the kid' (Larson gets to play two roles--the good guy Jimmy and the bad guy ), 'The Wedding of Superman' where Noel Neil shines as the bride of Superman, 'The Deadly Rock' where we actually have Superman meet Batman (in a way) because it guest stars Robert Lowery who played Batman in the movie serial 'Batman and Robin'. Another cool thing about this episode is that it links to the great episode of the second season 'Panic in the sky'. And it also stars the hilarious Steven Geary who plays professor Van Wyck.
So, even though it is much more kid friendly, it still has some hilarious storylines which still makes it a great series to watch. Even though it is a very inexpensive series, they did some top notch work with the show. Pick it up and see what I mean!",1415491200,,2522,4.619153674832962

2535034,4,B000EU1Q3Q,"Adding color was pure genius - especially in hindsight as it allowed the show to have a wider showing in the 1960's to about 1980. It is still shown on some of the station that show classic TV shows.

The color ranges from great to lightly washed out as some have all ready stated. And the plots slowly became more 'kid friendly' but stil have a lot of meaning for me. I can remember watching them when I got home form school and on Sat mornings. It's like watching old friends!

Sadly nothing like this could fly (pardon the pun) today. I showed these to my daughter when she was younger and, for the most part, she really enjoyed them. Few people die, nothing is blown up and the good guys always win. It's a little sad how things on TV are today but then that's true for a lot of things in the current time period.

I would rate this a 3.5 to 4.0 out of 5 stars - the show was starting to run it's course but still had a few shows with the power to entertain and move you.

THe quality is fantastic.. I own TV and movies on DVD from the 70s and 80s that don't look as sharp.

Only true gripe is i think Noel Neil was no where near as appealing as Phyliss Coates.  I was surpised that she and Jimmy were more like 2 kids that superman had to constnatly save.  The dynamic wasn't anything like the comics or later decades of movies.

2535064,5,B000EU1Q3Q,"Following the excellent second season, the producers of the ""Adventures of Superman"" made the decision to switch to filming the series in color (Something that would not be fully realized until it entered into syndication in the 1960s). Other changes included more child-friendly stories, as well as shortened thirteen-episode seasons. The result of these changes can be seen here in this DVD boxed-set, which includes the complete third and fourth seasons.
For the most part, the quality of the show in terms of storytelling diminished very little, although there are certainly episodes that will make you scratch your head and wonder what the writers were thinking. Nevertheless, the show continues to be a fantastic, character-driven series!
The highlights of seasons three and four include: ""Great Caesar's Ghost,"" where gangsters try to drive Perry White insane before testifying in a big case; ""Clark Kent, Outlaw,"" where Clark poses as a safefracker to bring in a crime ring; ""Joey,"" where the Man of Steel and the Daily Planet fight track corruption and win a horse race; ""The Big Freeze,"" where gangsters submit Superman to super-cold temperatures, temporarily robbing him of his powers while trying to force an election to go their way; ""Jimmy the Kid,"" where a look-alike poses as Jimmy Olsen to get information; and ""The Deadly Rock,"" where criminals and a scientist mistake Clark Kent's friend (Robert Lowery, who played DC's number two hero in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman-and-Robin-The-Complete-1949-Movie-Serial-Collection/dp/B0007G89FU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman and Robin - The Complete 1949 Movie Serial Collection</a>), who also has and adverse affect to Kryptonite.

2535073,5,B000EU1Q3Q,"Jack Larson, playing Jimmy Olsen, was probably the last adult actor of the 20th century to be able to convincingly utter the word `jeepers,' and that fact says something about the value of this wonderful series.  Jack Larson's portrayal of young Olsen was so popular that, in 1954, DC comics gave Jimmy Olsen his own comic book.

By this time also, Jimmy's role in the weekly Superman TV show had expanded.  At least 3 episodes from this collection, 'Olsen's Millions,' 'King for Day,' and 'The Bully of Dry Gulch' were lifted directly from the early issues of the Jimmy Olsen comic book.  (BTW, the original, comic book versions of these `Jimmy Olsen' stories were written by none other than Otto Binder, the legendary sci-fi author who wrote the best of the original Capt. Marvel comics.  Superman's publishers had, by 1954, sued Capt. Marvel out of existence, but Binder, along with artists Kurt Schaffenberger and Pete Costanza, eventually went to work on Superman's magazines.  Superman's magazines, in turn, gradually absorbed many of the traits of Capt. Marvel stories.)

Seasons 3-4, the 1st two seasons filmed in color, mark an increase in humor, whimsy, and sometimes all-out goofiness, when compared to the seasons 1-2, which were in B/W.  There is still plenty of excitement and peril in these episodes,  but when I was 12 years old, watching this series for the 1st time (rerun by Channel 33 in Youngstown, Ohio), the humorous and whimsical touches used to bug me: I took my heroes extremely seriously, and didn't like the implication that this could be in any way a `kiddie' show.

I am in my 40's now, and do not take it as a personal insult when I watch these episodes.  Most of the time, you still get a disciplined, well-constructed, well-acted story that usually involves either Superman or the audience trying to solve some sort of puzzle.  Usually too, either Jimmy, Lois, Perry or any combination thereof faces some sort of mortal peril.

It should also be noted of course, that the Supeman comics published during this period (and up through 1980'S!) often featured stories that where deliberately humourous of goofy as well, so it can be argued the the producers were just taking their cues from the funnies.

One thing that impresses me as an adult, besides the understated but high quality writing, is the dedication and professionalism of the cast.  If you really study George Reeves, you will see that in every scene the man was ON, and that he really was a very good actor.  For instance, if you observe him when he is about to pull off his Kent clothes to change to Superman, he always makes subtle movements of his arms, shoulders, hips, his head, any part(s) of his body, as if his muscles are literally wanting to burst out of his suit so he can spring into action.

Also, Reeves had a fantastic voice: strong, clear, intelligent and masculine, but with undertones of gentleness and kindness.  Those qualities are the essence of Reeves's  Superman.  This idea of a man who could be simpultaneously strong, wise and compassionate, is probably why Reeves's Superman is so fondly remembered and still enjoyable.  He is a kind of super father-figure.

In fact, from Season 2 and onward, the show featured the occasional child guest star, which of course was a device to reinforce kids' emotional involvement in the adventures.  In these episodes, you can see that Reeves had an excellent chemistry with the kids, naturally paternal, so it's sad that Reeves never had children.

Likewise, the characters of Jimmy, Lois and Perry also resemble, perhaps unconsciously, family members of the target audience.  Jimmy and Lois especially would tend to serve as surrogates for viewers, allowing audience members to imagine themselves sharing the adventures.  But these characters would simultaneously have reminded youngsters of bothers and sisters, with Lois sometimes acting in place of a mother instead. The feeling of family is one of the things that distinguish this series from later versions. And of course, when I was 12, it was easier to put myself in Jimmy Olsen's shoes and to imagine an annoying girl as Lois Lane.

On the whole, these episodes are almost as good as those of Season 2, especially if you factor in the fact that the colors for Reeves' super suit look so great, and that Noel Neill definitely is prettier in color.  Also, the special effects for the color seasons were more sophisticated than the B/W episodes.  In fact, this collection has a really neat little featurette about Thol Simonson, the man who did the special effects, and he was still alive and looking good! (The man is 90 years old if he is a day!)

It's true that the color episodes do not have the `edge' that Season 1 and some of Season 2 had, but the overall tone of the series carries through, and all of the craftsmanship and charm is there.  I highly recommend this product, it is still over 11 hours of highly entertaining programming.  Now for a little TV scavenger hunt: 2 episodes on this collection contain direct references to the 2 best episodes of Season 2, `Defeat of Superman,' and `Panic in the Sky.'  I challenge you to find the episodes to which I refer.",1206662400,6,5188,4.81941309255079

2535075,4,B000EU1Q3Q,"I just got my copy of Seasons 3 & 4 of Adventures of Superman. Special features include a piece entitled ""Adventures of Superman: The Color Era"" and another called ""Faster Than a Speeding Bullet: The Special Effects of The Adventures Of Superman.""

The former, about the series being filmed in color features interviews with Jack Larsen, Noel Neill, Gary Grossman (author of ""Superman: Serial to Cereal"") and a television historian whose name escapes me. All pretty much agree that it was a shrewd move of the producers to start filming the show in color, and saving the negatives until color television was common a decade later. In the words of Larsen, ""Those guys were pretty smart.""

The one about the sfx was mainly a profile and interview with Thol Simonson, along with Larsen and Neill. Both cast members were effusive with praise for Simonson, saying they always felt safe, no matter how risky the effect looked on screen. Something I had not seen before is a diagram of the ""pan"" apparatus and counterbalance that replaced the wires that had earlier suspended Reeves.

Episodes I have watched so far are ""The Wedding of Superman,"" ""The Big Freeze,"" and ""Through the Time Barrier."" As has been noted elsewhere, these stories are much less heavily dramatic as the nourish early episodes. However, the light comedy is not really campy, just good-natured. Also, Neill as Lois looks quite fetching in her cave-girl outfit in the time-travel story.

In fact, Ms. Neill still looks quite lovely in the new interview footage. She still has those same sparkling eyes and the lovely smile that gave me that first crush on Lois all those years ago.",1180915200,3,1646,4.888888888888889

We were all still young at heart and we believed in Super Heroes.

George Reeve's acting ability and great charm  along with a great cast are the main reasons to place this DVD set in your collection of Great Golden Age Television. The early shows were the best. They were mini-movies but as the years passed by, they became more comic and kiddie-like. I loved all of the episodes. George Reeve's acting is legendary! He has a magnetic personality. In this show,He became the Man of Steel! When He left the stage, as  a kid, you could not wait until he flew back into the scene. That was the impact that he gave us all.

from WB. On many episodes, the color is washed out, at least for part of

the episode. Also, I realize that old films are not perfect, and light

flashes sometimes occur, but I though WB had the original films. Many of

these episodes have serious running flaws, where the film obviously

didn't run right. Didn't anyboby verify that the film-to-DVD transfer was

okay before trying to sell the item? Some of these episodes are worse than

The original serials with Kirk Alyn are now out on DVD and they are entertaining considering the era and technical issues of the day and of good quality..yet the 1st season with our George Reeves is the best as far as the whole idea of Superman as a true depiction with all the film noir qualities are concerned IE: emphasis on gangsterism production and darkness of characterization and very ""detective pulp"" stories..2nd season..now we have new producers and writers, a new less sexy more liberated Lois Lane and while the 2nd season is also in Black&White it all shines but already in a less violent more crossover comical direction that found its full expression by this the 3rd season now in color.
The color is nice but check out the 1st season in glorious B&W for realism and atmosphere.

This amazing 5 single sided disc set contains 26 more thrilling episodes comprising of seasons 3 & 4 of the adventures of Superman. The color added a new dimension to the show and made these episodes even more fun to watch. The video and sound quality is better than I expected compared to the first two seasons and definitely an improvement. The stock footage is still full of scratches and debris but the episodes themselves look pretty good considering the age of the show. The special features included this time around are Superman the color era, Special effects of Superman and amazing story of Superman featurettes. I don't think this show has received the respect it truly deserved in regards to its release on DVD.

2535090,3,B000EU1Q3Q,"I would recommend this dvd after buying the first 2 , which featured the B&W seasons. The first season is a different show, mostly serious, hard hitting, with a 1940's 'film noir' quality. The series became more 'kid friendly' in the second season, but several episodes were still on a par with the first season.

This dvd features the 3rd and 4th season, the first ones shot in color. The comedic tone is set in the first episode when the daily Planet crew is sent back in time to prehistoric times. Those times consisting of a few rocks and a cave.

 What saves this show for me is the always ernest performance and charm of George Reeves, and the appeal of the cast even in the dumbest stories. There are still some excellent episodes, but even at their worst this show has an appeal that makes them watchable.

 George is starting to get a little long in the tooth already, and I recently noticed that he starts to belt his pants way too high-like Fred Mertz on 'I Love Lucy"". But it was the 50's.

I give it 3 red stars.",1163289600,3,1025,4.340314136125654
2535091,5,B000EU1Q3Q,"I loved it, it was absoulity terrific.  Of course there is one thing that I was and continue to be disappointed in and thats within the first 2 seasons of which are in B & W.  The Compnay that had burned these eposoides on to DVD elimanated one eposoide in particular.  This eposoide is where I think it was either Louis Lane or Perry White had been tied down to large log.  The log was in a Mill for cutting lumber and either Louis Lane or Perry White would end up being cut in half, when all of a sudden, Superman comes crashing through the wooden wall and stops the saw blade before the one tied to the huge log came in contact with the saw blade.  But of course that was within the first 2 Seasons of which were in B & W.

  As for Season's 3 & 4, they were absoulity terific. It was so nice to be able to see it in color for a change instead of the boaring dull

B & W.  I hope that they don't cut out any more eposoides when it come to Season's 5 & 6.",1163030400,2,957,3.8615384615384616

2535102,5,B000EU1Q3Q,"Overall George Reeeves is excellent. He makes an

intelligent Clark Kent. He is the definitive

investigative reporter; not the bumbling, goof-ball

that the movie Superman portrays him to be. The color

TV episodes are much funnier and lighter than the

black and white season one episodes and the color is

fantastic and weel preserved except where I note

below.

The characters are wonderful too. You will see

STERLING HOLLOWAY (the future voice of Winnie the

Pooh) as daffy scientist Prof. Twiddle in ""Through the

Time Barrier"", CLAUDE AKINS (the future Sheriff Elroy

P. Lobo and AAMCO Transmissions spokeman) as a

plotting submarine commander in ""Peril by the Sea"",

CHUCK CONNORS (the future Lukas McCain a.k.a. THE

RIFLEMAN) as a country bumpkin in ""Flight to the

North"", PAUL BURKE (future DYNASTY TV series' Neal

McVane) in ""The Phantom Ring"", JOHN BERADINO (later to

become Dr. Steve Hardy in TV's GENERAL HOSPITAL from

1963-96) in ""The Unlucky Number"". All are fast moving,

action packed episodes.

If you remember that George Reeves really loved to

bust through walls and doors and just about anything

to make the TV epsode more thrilling, you'll really

get a real kick out of it when you see him do it again

and again in almost every episode. He actually helped

plan many of the stunts and was very atheletic. He

would jump off a ladder to do the landings and would

bounce off a spring board and do a forward-roll onto a

mattress for the take-offs; many times right over the

cmera-man.

My biggest complaint, which may seem minor to many

other fans, is that the opening color sequence where

we hear the announcer say, ""Faster than a speeding

bullet! More powerful that a locomotive..."", all the

way to the end, comes from a certain 1957 episode and

is badly scratched and deteriorated, especially at the

beginning. It is used to open each and every episode

of the entire 1955, 1956 and 1957 seasons that are on

this DVD set. Why the DVD production team picked one

of the worst condition openings to subject viewers to

over and over again is beyond reason. ""Copyright 1957""

is seen at the bottom of each 1955 and 1956 episode.

The episode's correct copyright date appears in ROMAN

NUMERALS at the end of the episode just prior to the

cast credits.

For trivia fans only: they changed the revolver from a

Smith and Wesson (which was used in the black and

white episodes) to a Colt in the color episode opening

sequence. The DVD freeze frame feature allows you see

that the color photographed revolver's cylinder

rotates upward (clockwise: Colt) while the B&W

revolver's cylinder revolves downward

(counter-clockwise: S&W).

By the way, Noel Neill (Lois Lane) and Jack Larson

(Jimmy Olsen) have bit parts in the movie ""Superman

Returns"". Noel Neill is the dying billionairess in the

opening sequence and Jack Larson is the old bartender

with the bowtie. Too bad that film didn't have more

humor in it and move a little faster.

 Iunderstand that the 5th and 6th Seasons are due out in November, 2006.

 With only 16 episodes left, I wonder with what extras the producers of the DVD set will fill the five discs. See my list of episode titles for the 5th and 6th season under that listing.",1154304000,4,3245,4.766304347826087

2535104,4,B000EU1Q3Q,"Although this 3rd and 4th year compilation of the classic tv series forgoes the commentaries that marked the two preceding releases, these radiant color episodes are marked with the same intriguing premises and generally fine production values.  OK, maybe some of these ""adventures"" of the Man of Steel are fairly silly, and by now even the most rabid fan must be annoyed by Lois, Perry and Jimmy's inability to recognize Clark Kent's real identity, but the flying sequences are even better this time around.  Jack Larson as Jimmy dominates the other players and deservedly so, but Noel Neill has a nice turn when she imagines she marries her longtime love!!!!",1154217600,2,660,4.990909090909091
2535105,3,B000EU1Q3Q,"Now, don't get me wrong. I'm a huge fan of George Reeves and company. But if you're thinking about ponying up for this set like I did, there's two questions you need to ask:

1) How are the prints?

First of all, don't expect the same quality as the B&W season 1 & 2 sets. There's a stock 1957 opening that's a little rough. And luckily none of the episodes seem to have the excessive print damage that say ""The Stolen Costume"" had in the first season set. However, the colour isn't perfect. In many cases, the technicolour picture is perfectly sharp and crystal clear - amazing for prints that are 50 years old. But then the camera will quickly cut to a more soft, washed out shot or scene - from a 100% sharpness to about 80% resolution - and it gets very distracting at times. This happens constantly. I've read they had a lot of restoration work to do on this one and it's too bad they couldn't correct this so the print is uniformly sharp. You get used to the picture after a while. But it is disappointing considering what they were able to pull off with the first two season sets.

2) How are the stories? I heard they turned it into a kids' show!

Well, in terms of the storylines themselves, many of the shows have devolved to the standard two thugs ""Whadda we do now, boss?"" type of situations. Sure, it's still highly entertaining and George Reeves is still letter perfect. But the show has certainly lost a step in these seasons compared to the second and particularly the first season's harder edged radio serial leanings.

As for Lois Lane, Noel Neil has her moments. But at this point in the series, she seems far too sunny and perky for the role and has very little rivalry with Clark - although the softening of the scripts don't help her out here. For my money, Phyllis Coates just nailed Lois perfectly in the first season - she's the damsel in distress obviously (and what a screamer!) but still the feisty, business-like, tough as nails reporter (unlike Noel here). For instance, when Clark takes over the editor's chair from Perry White in ""Peril By Sea"", Noel's Lois couldn't be happier for Clark - while Phyllis' Lois would've torn a strip off him!

So to recap, it's still wildly entertaining - but the inconsistent prints and storylines make this Superman a little less than stellar.",1154131200,22,2309,4.511961722488039
2535106,3,B000EU1Q3Q,"""The Complete Third and Fourth Seasons"" would not be bad except for two reasons. The most bothersome is that my first DVD set had a defect that would not allow me to play episodes 16 and 17 on disc 3. The replacement set did the same thing. I tried the disc on 4 different DVD players and my two computers. The players ranged from a high end Sony to a low end Magnavox and mid priced Samsung. The computers tried were a new IBM laptop and my two year old Compaq decktop. None of them would play these episodes without either hanging up or skiping. The other problem is the poor quality of the video transfers. The color quality changes with almost every scene change. It can be very good or very bad with washed out color. Warner Brothers needs to use more care when bringing out these great sets.",1154044800,4,797,4.32

It's such a good show, and it holds up pretty well after half a century.  I can't wait for the rest of the series to become available.  As far as seasons three and four being more comedy and less drama, I suppose that's so, but it's just so much fun watching, and remembering.",1154044800,,452,4.1022727272727275

It truly is amazing that nobody can see through the disguise being created with a pair of glasses and a business suit. Creating believability where none exists by fantastic acting makes episode after episode of the original TV Superman  an amazing classic favorite and a must own complete series.

2535111,1,B000EU1Q3Q,"What are we reviewing here? How superb the cast was? How great the episodes that many of us haven't seen in years? How fantastic it is to see that they actually planned for the future and shot seasons 3-6 in color or are we reviewing the quality of the DVD? If it was the cast, the individual episodes and that those that foresaw the advancement of technology, then I would give it 5 stars, but the review should be of the quality of the DVD. Sure we can point out our favorite episodes and reminisce, but the quality is not there. The picture quality goes from extremely sharp and clear to something you would find in the $1.00 bin at a discount/drug store. I doubt any time went into this. It is almost as though they didn't even go to their vaults to locate the original negative, but took a copy of what they have passed to the television stations. If I was one of those who had put the time and effort into producing the episodes in color, so, if in time, technology allowed, future generations would see it in color, I would be totally disappointed in the product that was issued.

As has been pointed out, the opening is reproduced for each episode in poor quality. Next we get to the title of the episode. Has anyone else noticed, the episode title is always clear and sharp? Then, once we get into each episode, it is like a roller coaster of quality. Finally we go to the credits, and, just like the episode title, it is always clear and sharp. Why is it that the center of the film has deteriorated, but the title and credits are in perfect condition? One interesting note: In the first two seasons, they had Superman biographers and cast members doing commentary on select episodes, but not on this issue. Jack could have done commentary on his dual role in ""Jimmy the Kid"" and Noel could have done the same for ""The Wedding of Superman"". Could it be that they didn't want them to know how cheap and bad the quality of seasons 3 & 4 were? Not one episode is in pristine condition.

I believe that Warner Bros. pushed this for release to coincide for the new Superman movie. I don't think that they took time to find the original negatives nor attempted any type of restoration. They played on fans desire to purchase this fiasco of a transfer. I, like others, couldn't wait and purchased it on its first day of issue. I had seasons 1 and 2 which I was pleased with, I expected the same, like everyone else, for seasons 3 and 4. It didn't happen.

Maybe in four or five years, they will have 'discovered' the original negatives and re-issue a digitally restored version. One can only hope. Other studios are putting out quality vintage television show DVD's, Warner Bros. failed miserably with this one. Wonder if seasons 5 & 6 will also be issued from poor quality stock? I feel sorry for the surviving members of the cast (Noel Neill and Jack Larson) who probably thought Warner Bros. was going to issue a quality DVD, since this is, literally, their legacy, only to find out it's a cheap quality product. If we keep giving glowing reviews for content and not quality, this is an example of what we will see in future DVDs.

Recommend BUY USED, or borrow from a friend that has a copy. Send Warner Bros. a message that we want a quality product.

This review is solely on the quality and film transfer to DVD.",1153699200,19,3322,4.430441898527005
2535112,5,B000EU1Q3Q,"Yes, the episodes are complete and uncut, and in glorious digitally restored color, very vibrant. Don't expect the colors to be this vibrant when the last two seasons are released next, when the producer decided to save money on production. Generally, visual and audio quality are superb, and once again, we are shown why George Reeves became the favorite Superman of millions, and still is. His charm and warmth shines through at its best. I was never a big fan of the special features, although they do add a nice supplement. They could have added, for example, A&E's bio on George, or something of greater length and depth.

Since one of the reviewers finding a ticket posted several months ago, and the other said s/he pre-ordered the set, I wonder if the tickets were included in a limited number of early-run sets (or maybe it's just random distribution in only SOME of the sets).

Since Amazon doesn't mention the tickets in their comments, there was no misrepresentation from the seller.

THE NITTY GRITTY -- REASONABLE PRICE FOR A TERRIFIC PACKAGE

The color episodes which make up this set have a modern look to them that children find more appealing than the earlier two seasons. True, the stories are targeted more toward children than adults, but with so many adventures to watch there is something for everyone in this series. This most recent addition to the DVD editions adds, through color, a new dimension which really helps in rounding out this series. I look forward to the next set, and to seeing a few more of the series that I have not seen in almost 50 years.",1152748800,2,2629,5.253623188405797
2535116,4,B000EU1Q3Q,"Warners/DC has now released seasons 3 & 4 of the 1950s classic ""Adventures of Superman"" series, this time in color for the first time.

  One would like to say the overall collection is as good as

the black & white seasons one and two episodes, but that is not the case. The addition of color to the series created budgetary problems for the producers of the t.v. franchise that more than doubled the costs of each episode. In order to shoot in color, therefore, the t.v. crew had to slash the episode numbers in

half, from 26 to 13 episodes. This is why we have two seasons in one DVD collection.

Money woes were also behind a certain ongoing cheapness in set and properties construction that shows up on film. Walls shake when doors slam, ""rocks"" shudder when Superman drives a fist into them, and, in one episode wherein a submarine lurks off the coast and watches a beachfront house through its periscope,

the house and its surroundings are quite obviously not even a painted matte, but, rather, A PEN & INK DRAWING COLORED WITH WATERCOLORS!

This is truly indicative of how much cost-cutting has gone on here!

The tone of the series has changed radically as well. When AOS began , it was structured as a cinematic extension of the rough and tumble Bud Collyer radio series , with a touch of the old Fleischer cartoons of the forties for added flavor. But by the time the color conversion was getting readied a whirlwind had struck the world of comics. A psychiatrist named Frederick Wertham (called ""Fabulous Freddie""....sarcastically...by comics insiders) had launched a campaign to ""rein in"" the ""extravagant evils"" of comic books and got congress caught up in his drive

to ""clean up"" this ""depraved medium"". The innocent minds of the little kiddies had to be protected from such corruptive rot. In the frenzy over ""Werthamism"", entire lines of comics folded, and

a new industry regulatory group, the Comics Code Authority, came into being. This was the comic book equivalent of the Hays Office in the film industry.

Comics had to, under the new guidelines, ""shape up"" or ship out.

Most of the EC titles...from ""Tales From the Crypt"" to ""Vault of Horror"" and ""Weird Science""...did the latter.

Other titles, from ""Superman"", ""Batman"", and others, began to ""tone things down"" as well.

And what happened to the comics got tied to the AOS t.v. series.

The decision was made to ""tone down"" AOS too. Make it more ""kid-friendly"" and less ""stress-inducing"".

For this reason, the 3rd and 4th seasons didn't pack the kind of visceral punch the first two seasons did. Some of the episodes are just plain cornball stupid. Others, though, work pretty WELL. ""The Big Freeze"", ""Joey"", ""Dagger Island"", the superb ""The Wedding of Superman"", and ""Test of a Warrior"" (along with a few others) deliver the goods as ""Super"" entertainment. ""Test of a Warrior"" I strongly recall from childhood, wherein Perry White is given the Indian tribal name of ""okeecheeboygan""...""He who writes with thundering machines"".

Overall, the color is good in these transfers, if somewhat inconsistent. I don't think this is a film-to-DVD pixelation problem. I think it is a problem inherent in the original color photography. It took a good deal of light (key lighting, side

lighting, back lighting) to shoot good color in those days and I sense that the lighting set-ups in use weren't always sufficient to get the job done ideally. What one notices in various scenes is that the color in CLOSE-UP shots is vibrant and sharp...often simply gorgeous...whereas in medium shots and long shots it tends to have a yellowy , washed out look...and sometimes even looks overexposed. All in all, though, the color looks good and gives the production values some extra ""Pizzaz"".

The acting is first rate. The ensemble of Reeves, Neil, Larsen,and Hamilton hits on all cylinders, and Reeves, especially, simply ""owns"" this roll. His Clark Kent is also still the best...and toughest...of all Clark Kents, movie versions included.

One additional thing should be said here. The George Reeves Superman comes across, still, as the most POWERFUL Superman.

A special feature on Disc 5 involves the special effects of flying in AOS and reminds us of one thing; Superman is the essence of POWER, and his takeoffs and landings IN AOS remind us of that. Reeves utilized the mini-trampoline and coil springboard techniques pioneered at Republic Studios for their ""Captain Marvel"" and ""Rocketman/Commando Cody"" flying hero adventures for his takeoffs (and the jump-from-a-ladder or swing-out-from-a-suspended-bar techniques for his landings). Because of this, the Reeves take-offs and landings have an athletic ""muscularity"" to them that none of his successors have achieved. In fact, in the world of Reeves/Reeve landings, Chris's look positively wussy compared to George's. The screaming-wind sound effect of Superman in flight in AOS is still the best audio accompanyment to all versions, as is the whipping wind effect. Again, all these elements work together to enhance the effect of kinetic POWER here, something that has largely been missed in other versions. I have not seen ""Superman Returns"" yet, so I cannot comment on how well that film evokes the power sense I've been addressing . Hopefully it will do so nicely.

So is this collection 3 of AOS worth the loot you need to shell out for it. Sure it is. How could it not be ? The good features still outweigh the clunkers and you're still in for a super good time watching it all.

Enjoy!",1152316800,14,5511,4.9458288190682556

The ending of each episode are correct to 1955-56. Each episode is sharp, though there are spots of irregular color saturation.  The packaging is just as good as the previous 2 .

2535121,5,B000EU1Q3Q,"I've written often about the deterioration in quality of ""The Adventures of Superman"" after color was introduced, in 1954, and I'll still stand by the statement, for the last seasons of the series...But having just sat through this collection of the third and fourth seasons' color episodes, allow me to ""eat crow""...these episodes are VERY entertaining, and certainly are far better than I remembered!

The decision to shoot in color was a bold move, by sponsor Kellogg's, producer Whitney Ellsworth, and the series' home studio, Motion Pictures for Television Inc,(MPTV), as the technology to even air color programming would not be widely available to local television stations for nearly a decade. Series like AOS, ""The Cisco Kid"", and ""The Lone Ranger"", in choosing to use the far more expensive process, understood that these programs would have a 'lifespan' far beyond the 1950s audience. Certainly, in the case of AOS, the continuing popularity of the show, and the sales of these collections prove their point!

Because of the expense of color, the seasons would be slashed from 26 to 13 episodes per season, which was a godsend to the cast, particularly George Reeves. Lighting for color was MUCH brighter and hotter than for black and white, and the costume department realized Reeves' original brown-and-gray, frequently sweat-stained ""shoulder-padded longjohns"" would be even more of a problem in future. A 'genius' decided to redesign the costume, creating a thicker, full-body red and blue suit of foam rubber, which would not 'show' perspiration (but would, sadly, make the actor appear much stockier). While in theory this was a great idea, in truth, it was a disaster, as the suit didn't 'breathe', with 'locked-in' sweat causing severe rashes and frequent heat exhaustion for Reeves. A half-hour stretch was the maximum he could wear it, safely, making for long 'shooting days'...and the physical torture of the suit would 'age' Reeves, rapidly, over the remainder of the series.

Knowing this, my respect for Reeves' professionalism has increased, and this collection offers some of his really terrific performances, as well as some of Noel Neill and Jack Larson's best work, as well. Among my favorites are ""Superman Week"" and ""King For a Day"" (which shows Reeves still willing to manhandle baddies...something that would soon be completely eliminated as Kellogg's bowed to parental pressure for less violence); ""Jimmy the Kid"", offering Larson a meaty dual role, as both 'comic relief' Jimmy Olsen, and a notorious gunman; and, best of all, ""The Wedding of Superman"", an acting tour-de-force by Neill, in a remarkably sensitive (and prophetic, for ""Lois & Clark"" fans) episode of Lois and Superman finally acknowledging their love. This episode is acclaimed as one of the finest episodes of the entire series, and shouldn't be missed!

So, if you harbor an illusion that the color episodes will be a disappointment, like I did, I strongly urge you to reconsider, and buy this collection...I think you'll be in for a VERY pleasant surprise!",1151539200,91,3061,5.190283400809717
2535122,5,B000EU1Q3Q,"I can't believe all of the boo-hooing about the quality of these prints.  So the opening segments aren't what they should be... but what follows is exactly what the reviewer ""Wow"" said it is...i.e. ""WOW!""  Beautiful prints, wonderfully presented.

As for the episodes themselves...I'm going out on a limb and announce that I perversely perhaps prefer these to the earlier, more noir-ish entries.  You can see that by this point in the series the creators had nothing to prove and let a healthy sense of humor enliven the proceedings.  To be honest I never looked to ""Superman"" for detective adult-type entertainment....I'm much more fascinated by the outrageous half-camp/half-serious plots you get in these seasons (that, truth to tell, often verge on the deeply serious themselves...see the episode about the chief suspecting he is losing his mind, in ""Great Caesar's Ghost."")

2535123,5,B000EU1Q3Q,"I have to say that seasons 3 and 4 are different in tone than the first 2 seasons. One reviewer said that in many respects it looks like a different show. I have to agree. I'm not in favor of the decision made to shoot these subsequent seasons in color although I understand the economic reasons why the decision was made. Still the show remains fresh and top notch compared to other series and there are some more adult-like episodes to match the black and white seasons. ""The Seven Souvenirs"" is a prime example and is, to my mind, the most perfectly paced episode of the whole series. It glides along and George Reeves is at the very top if his game, acting-wise, throughout the episode. Watch his delivery during the climax when he is revealing what the thefts are really about. Jimmy Olsen playing a twin bad guy, in another episode, is a riot in that part. Many of the villians are played in a more Damon Runyon style and are very funny. There's plenty to enjoy from these episodes. After seasons 1 and 2, you just need to do a little adjustment and enjoy the shows on their terms. They're still an absolute joy.",1151280000,14,1118,4.432038834951456
2535124,4,B000EU1Q3Q,"By the time ""Adventures of Superman"" was filmed in color, the series had evolved from a hard-hitting crime drama to a family-oriented show.

The 1955-56 seasons were uneven in quality, but featured its share of memorable episodes: ""Clark Kent, Outlaw,"" ""The Seven Souvenirs,"" ""The Big Freeze,"" ""Jimmy the Kid,"" ""The Wedding of Superman"" and ""The Phantom Ring."" This five-DVD set was transferred from the best existing 35mm print material (some of the original color stock had obvious defects) with stunning results.

2535126,5,B000EU1Q3Q,"Superman in color but still from the 1950s is a pretty cool and rare combination. These are shows for both old and new audiences. Alot of people say that with season 3, the shows became more for the kids. I don't think the change was anything drastic enough to really stand out from the other two seasons (with the exception of the cave-men and pirates episodes). They explain on the special features that although everyone had B&W televisions and that the networks broadcast the show in B&W they made them in color knowing that in the future the reruns would be ready to be seen alongside other colored shows and continue to keep up. Pretty smart. For any Superman fan or any fan of old classic shows purchase this and enjoy.

2535127,3,B000EU1Q3Q,"Having just read the other reviews, it seems to me that there's a blur between reacting to the quality of the picture and the stories themselves. So, I'm going to try here to put things in perspective.

In terms of the picture quality, i agree that the transfers could have been better. Although in color, the picture looks rather faded and washed out, and there are many imperfections. On the other hand, we're assuming here that Warners had the capability of cleaning the picture. Perhaps they did not, and were limited to less than perfect source material. So I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.

 As far as the episodes themselves, my fondness for them is mainly based on a sense of nostalgia, as I used to watch the show every day back in the 1960s. In terms of the stories, they can't compare to the first seasons. In fact, despite the same cast (with the exception of Lois Lane) it feels like two completely different shows. The first seasons scripts, which featured Phyllis Coates as Lois, were well written dramas, with a no-nonsense Superman acting as an avenging angel, ringing in the bad guys (who were actually quite menacing) The drama was tense, the dialogue crackled, the acting and direction was great, as was the background music. The second season stories were toned down a bit, but there were still some great episodes(""Panic in the sky"", ""A Ghost for Scotland Yard"", ""The Face and the Voice"", etc.) By the time the series went to color, the scripts were toned down even further. the bad guys were no longer punched out by Superman, and were more comic than menacing.  Still, there were some good episodes in seasons 3 and 4, including ""Great Caesars Ghost"", ""Test of a Warrior"", and ""the wedding of Superman"". Basically, the episodes written by Jackson Gillis are the best (same goes for season 2)The episodes written by David Chantler are worse...some are downright boring. The dialogue and direction in season 3 and 4 also were vastly inferior to seasons 1 and 2. (I guess when Tommy Carr read the new scripts, he wanted nothing to do with them.) Having said all that, I don't want to seem hypocritical. I did buy the set, and have no regrets that I did. It was a great series, albeit one that went through many changes during its six year run. Unfortunately, the only change for the better was going to color. Otherwise, these episodes are still enjoyable, but pale in comparison with seasons 1 and 2.",1151107200,10,2430,4.670560747663552
2535128,5,B000EU1Q3Q,"Color changed Superman, and Noel Neil was beautiful in Color as well as Black and White. Her sadness and want to find love in The Wedding of Superman, is superb as an actress should be. There is a song by Jose Jose named Quiero Perderme Contigo that is in format with how Lois Lane feels in that episode, but the same should be of Clark Kent, and what must be in his mind. Probably that is what Manuel Alejandro the Composer of the song had in mind when he wrote the song. Through the Time Barrier is a comedy in dealing with Time Travel, and as for thier adventures in the Land Before Time, they encounter what Wilma and Fred Flinstone must have really looked like, if they were for real and man did live with the Dinosaurs. Again Noel Neil is gorgous in that epesode, and even in a Cavewoman dress that looked pretty stylish.

By all means order or buy this great Collection",1151020800,2,876,4.3090909090909095
2535129,5,B000EU1Q3Q,"Superman in COLOR!

WOW!

I just received my copy of season 3 in the mail and have been a couch potato most of the day as I sat watching episode after episode.

The first thing I noticed is that the famous ""intro"" we all know doesn't appear to be ""cleaned up"" by Warner Brothers. By that I mean they're chock full of specks and film scratches, looking pretty bad overall. For a minute, I thought I was in for a day of watching terrible transfers of each episode.

That is, until the actual episode started. WOW! Talk about great looking! I remember seeing some of these color episodes when they were let out of the vaults to play on TV long after they were originally made (in the 50's they were ONLY broadcast in black-and-white). But seeing the transfer placed on these DVDs is like watching all new episodes! Not only is the color excellent, but seeing the ENTIRE episode again (instead of those heavily edited versions we'd all watch in later years on commercial television) was a huge plus as well! I can only praise the great job Warner did here.

Sure, the episodes aren't as serious as the first season, but they definitely are enjoyable nonetheless. I especially enjoy the humor as Clark/Superman would quip some comment about his alter-identity to the others at the end of most episodes. The other characters in the series may have been ""dumb to the world"", but WE all knew what he was hinting at, DIDN'T we?

And even though you'd THINK seeing the ""flubs"" on screen in these replays would make watching the series less enjoyable; I actually ENJOY ""catching what I missed seeing back then"". One such example is when Superman puts the crook's heads between jail cell bars he bent with his bare hands. But watch when he places one of the guys into that newly opened area. The guy's shoulders slam into the bars and the bars bend just as easily from the force of his shoulders hitting them! Obviously, in reality, the guy would have had 2 broken shoulder blades!

There are some great documentaries included on disc 5 as well, including my favorite of the bunch, the one covering the special effects on the TV series. Little did I know that George Reeves loved crashing through those walls! And you have to hand it to George for those fantastic take offs and landings (especially back in through those windows). They've never been done better! Even in the movies!

I've purchased all three volumes to date and will definitely be purchasing volume 4 when it's ready for release as well.

A quick bit of history - a few major changes happened to the show at the start of the third season.  While seasons 1 & 2 both had 26 episodes per season, beginning with season 3 the number of episodes produced per season was cut in half to only 13.  The show also went to color, which took up a large part of the show's budget.  (As a side note, these episodes were originally shown on TV in black and white, first appearing in color in the 1960's.)  Also, by the time of the third season, the focus on the show had really changed to more of a ""kid's"" show, with little of the violence that had defined the first season in particular.  It certainly makes the show a very different show to watch from the previous first two seasons, but enjoyable in it's own right.  And you might find this box easier to watch with the whole family.
