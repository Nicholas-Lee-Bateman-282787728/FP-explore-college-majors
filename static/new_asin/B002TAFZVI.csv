8380003,5,B002TAFZVI,"This is definitely one of the best Czech movies. As a Czech living in the US, I really wanted to have some good Czech movie to show my friends. Thankfully, there are English subtitles - though they certainly are not perfect. But we enjoyed it immensely! It also came much faster than what I expected - within two weeks from my order (shipped from the Czech Republic).",1426291200,2,367,4.492537313432836

8380006,5,B002TAFZVI,"The lack of reviews about Cosy Dens is a mystery to me. This very good
Czech film should be a classic of it's kind. It reminds one of the
former masterpieces from old Czechoslovakia, but at the same time it's
original in a very unpretentious way. It deals with serious things, but
it's subtle humour is very engaging. The silence surrounding this
film is a reminder that the most famous work of art are not always
or necessarily the best. I think no lover of East Europian films will
be disappointed with this DVD. I saw this first on TV, and it swept
me off my feet, so I later ordered it from Amazon. It's a film to be
watched more than once, which is not such a common thing, really.",1351728000,6,686,4.244274809160306
