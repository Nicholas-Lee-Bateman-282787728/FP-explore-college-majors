7801452,5,1931046239,"If you are a strength athlete, coach, or interested in being the best you can be...throw out every book, muscle mag, etc you own and get Intervention.  I've been in the game nearly 40 years and this has it all.  Intervention will take you from beginner's patterning movementss to the best explosive (plyometrics) movements.  And does it in a simple and engaging format.  I cannot recommend this series enough.  I recommend both the book and the DVD.  Each has incredible value.

Save yourself a ton of $ on other resources and DO this for yourself!!!",1399507200,,550,4.726315789473684
7801453,5,1931046239,Everything you want. Whether you are just starting out or an experienced coach Dan John knows what he is talking about. Incredible value.,1374019200,,137,5.0
7801454,5,1931046239,"What's the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing and wisdom is doing. Dan John has been ""doing"" for well over thirty years and it comes to life in his Intervention DVD. Mr. John shares simple formulas and step by step instructions that guide you to training a de-conditioned elderly person to training an elite athlete. Whether you are a professional coach or a weekend warrior, you are missing out if you are not privy to the gold found in Intervention.",1368489600,,478,4.841463414634147
7801455,5,1931046239,"Great content, love the program, have already incorporated routines into my personal training programs.  Highly recommend and I've only gone through the first two of three discs.",1361232000,2,178,5.592592592592593
7801456,5,1931046239,"There isn't much to be learned about lifting and training that isn't included Intervention. Dan John has got to be the most prolific writers of strength and conditioning literature there is, so when he told me this was his best work yet, I had pretty high expectations.
Intervention exceeded all of them.
Intervention is quintessential Dan John; easy to read, simple to understand, and every page is laced with little knowledge bombs that will change the way you think about programming and training.

Intervention is more than just a book about programming. If you have followed Dan's writings over the many years you would be aware of his tool box of training methods and rules for lifting and life. Intervention walks you through which, how and when to use the appropriate tool.
In less than 300 pages i have honestly learnt more about programming and training than I learnt in a 3 year degree at university.
I get contemplative at this time of year. Right now I'm thinking about how my university fees could have been better spent on motorbikes, travel, workshops, dining and whiskey, but I'm also motivated to get back to helping people.
So many people need intervention. Read it; learn from it, and then share over 30 years of life and lifting knowledge with as many people as you can.
Every year my biggest failure is to help my own parents to get from point A to point....
""ahh yes, i was missing point B"".
Intervention has now given me tools. Seeing as the zombie apocalypse has yet to come, it's time to get to work.",1356220800,3,1526,4.672862453531598
7801457,5,1931046239,Dan John does an excellent job with this DVD getting across his system of applying exercise as an intervention. Many concepts in here that are gems you won't find anywhere else. I have been using this as the base of our interns education since it covers so much so well.,1346716800,6,270,4.42
7801458,5,1931046239,"I am a big fan of Dan John and have read a ton of his stuff online. He is a great storyteller as well as being incredibly bright and humble. He's the guy you want to share a couple of dark beers at the local pub with just to hear him talk. If you don't laugh during this video you are probably dead.

This is a seminar that seems to be geared towards coaching/training others, but the info is absulutely necessary for those of us who are selfcoaching. I honestly wish I had come across this info 10 years ago.

Dan is no lightweight in the sports/training world. He has had a pretty impressive lifting and throwing career and is at the age (50something I think) where he can give some real perspective on what works and wehat lasts.

There is none of the ""Huge Arms In 6 Weeks"" or ""A Six-Pack in 6 Minutes A Day"" crap here. (If you want that sort of stuff, the answer is always the same: be a beginner.) What you get is a lifelong way to strength train, a way to prevent injury, and to rebuild after injury. On top of that you get some great insights on life, keeping balance/perspective, and setting and reaching goals.",1332115200,5,1120,4.248826291079812
7801459,5,1931046239,"Dan John's latest work is a must have for those who are their own coach or train others to continually reach new levels in strength and conditioning. This is the what, the how and the why all in one. I know that my personal training plan and my clients are truly enjoying this 'Intervention"". CARRY. SQUAT. HINGE. PULL. PUSH. ENJOY!",1315180800,5,332,4.55
7801460,5,1931046239,"Hugely impressive work, Dan John has distilled decades of knowlege and experience into this fantastic lecture. From the fitness enthusiast to a head coach, everybody could benefit from watching and learning from this.",1311897600,4,217,5.606060606060606
