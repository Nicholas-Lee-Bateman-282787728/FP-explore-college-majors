8147915,2,B000IZJRRO,"I ordered this movie and wasn't able to watch it until after the two week return policy had expired. It turns out that something was wrong with the dvd, and it would skip through half of the whole movie. I wouldn't even play in my blue ray or dvd player because it was too messed up and the only way I was able to watch it was in my computer, and even then it would skip. I had to buy it somewhere else so I could properly watch it. My advice is make sure that whoever you buy it from has a return policy and make sure you watch in different devices to make sure it works well.",1359590400,,577,3.8983050847457625
8147916,4,B000IZJRRO,"Leena Yadav, the director, has chosen all aspects of life. She has spoken through the visuals as well.

On the whole watch the movie for its great script, wonderful songs and visuals that are truly awesome !!! Watch it also for Aishwarya , for she has not looked so graceful after TAAL happened to her. Watch out for a commendable work of art and literature",1303084800,,357,4.492307692307692
8147917,3,B000IZJRRO,"A megalomaniacal writer is an intriguing basis for a story, and actor Sanjay Dutt nails the role with aplomb. He and actress Aishwarya Rai, who plays his wife, are a powerful onscreen pair, and the intense interaction between the two--both in their love scenes and their dialogue--is the highlight of the film. Sanjay's character, Shaukat, is an award-winning novelist who prods his wife Antara, a college professor, into having an affair with her colleague, Yash (played by Zayed Khan), so he can use the experience as material for a new book. His selfish manipulation of his wife and her willing participation in such a cruel emotional game--in which they all suffer, but Yash is the only innocent victim--is riveting. However, there are two glaring problems with the film. First, Yash is far too immature to be convincing as a college professor or the love interest of a sophisticated woman. Second, since Yash and Antara work together and Antara is married to a famous writer, it isn't believable that she would be able to keep her marital status a secret from her lover, which is essential to the plot. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1254009600,,1342,5.583333333333333
8147918,1,B000IZJRRO,"Someone needs to tell Aishwarya Rai and Zayed Khan that they cannot act. The movie is very strange indeed, unlike your usual Bollywood flair. It's an interesting story and I am sure there is nothing original about how the story unfolds or the plot. Sanjay Dutt is not a bad actor, mediocre perhaps, certainly better than Rai and Khan put together. This film is a total waste of time.",1246492800,,383,4.565217391304348
8147919,1,B000IZJRRO,"This was not a movie that i would recommend.  It was dark, slow moving and i did not care for the plot.  I have loved Aishwarya Rai in other movies but this one got passed on.",1246320000,2,175,3.8333333333333335
8147920,4,B000IZJRRO,"Shabd is about a married novelist (Sanjay Dutt). His first book was hailed as brilliant but his second one panned for not being 'real' enough. He has had a 2 year dry spell since. To get 'real' he decides to encourage a friendship between his wife (Aishwarya Rai) and a new young teacher at her work (Zayed Khan) and write a novel based on his imagination of unfolding events and judicious questioning and guiding of his trusting wife. He is adept at mind games and she gets caught up in them. 'Real' and fiction start to get confused and the writer starts to unravel believing he is writing the 'real' events in a God-like way. Wife still loves him and the young guy wants to marry the wife (not knowing she is married till near the end)....

This isn't a movie I would say was 'enjoyable' but it was interesting and well done. It actually had a more 'real' ending (to an extent) rather than a Bollywood one (though I would have found a more Bollywood ending more emotionally satisfying). It is close to an art piece and, while there are some songs adding to the emotional buildup, it isn't a song and dance type Bollywood. It is slick and modern and often tortured emotions are played out.

Sanjay and Aishwarya are both excellent. It may be the best I've seen him do (though I cant say I've explored his movies much). Unfortunately Zayed is miscast and it is a bit unbelievable that Ash's feelings would drift towards him. The script is interesting (though a few scenes at the end dragged a bit when they'd made their point) and cinematography good too..

This tends to get average ratings elsewhere on the Net- though some have been a bit more generous here and there. I'm glad I watched it but it's probably one I won't revisit.",1246060800,,1733,4.495238095238095
8147921,5,B000IZJRRO,"The story line of this movie is not for everybody but for those who think out side the box. It is about a writer who losses his way while writing and trys to push his wife away into the arms of another man, just to test out the plot in his book. Was a hard movie to get into but was worth it for the ending that will touch your heart.",1232928000,2,334,3.7183098591549295
8147922,3,B000IZJRRO,This movie was very strange. The husband is insane. But the movie is very passionate and the graphics are beautiful. The story line makes you feel you were missing a little something but I am not quite sure what it was. It wasn't as sound as it should be. But this is worth watching.,1167782400,5,283,4.2592592592592595
