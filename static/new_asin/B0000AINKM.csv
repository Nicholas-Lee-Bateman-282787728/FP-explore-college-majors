1906470,3,B0000AINKM,"Let me keep it simple.  By now you know that ""El Ultimo Cuple"" (1957) and ""La Violetera"" (1958) are the biggest box office films in the history of Spanish language cinema.  You probably know also that a big part of that success lays on the magnificent Sarita Montiel who stars on both. You are surely attracted to this DVD by the reasonable pricing. Right?  Well, you get what you pay for and in this case you will get two great movies transferred from inferior quality film stock and thrown into an attractive DVD box without its original widescreen format, in faded Eastmancolor and lousy sound. No remastering, no restoration, nothing! No English subtitles either...just another nicely priced bootleg. Period. I say: PITY!",1265414400,12,725,4.926229508196721

1906474,4,B0000AINKM,"Spanish screen legend Sara Montiel stars in both of these films, two of her most popular, dating from 1957 (El Ultimo Cuple) and 1958 (La Violetera).  Both are musicals, with melodramatic, highly sentimental stories that either take place or begin at the turn of the 20th century.  But the plots are not the main thing here, they just offer a welcome excuse to see and hear Sara sing some great ""cuples"", a saucy, dance hall-type of song that was popular in Spain ages ago; some are uptempo, others are ballads - in both cases, Sara always goes to the heart of the song and delivers moving, heartfelt performances. Her beauty is legendary as well, and the screen literally glows with her stunning presence.  The films appear unrestored and full screen on this DVD (no English subtitles are provided), but the video is clear and has good detail, and the films are reasonably splice-free, although signs of wear and blemishes are quite obvious, and the colors are substantially faded as well.  But the rarity of these titles and the terrific price of this disc make it a must for fans of Sara and her music.  Indulge, and take a magic, nostalgic trip to a wonderful, gentler era.",1112832000,42,1177,4.694174757281553
1906475,3,B0000AINKM,"These two films starring Sarita Montiel were the two most successful Spanish films ever. In the years 1957 and 1958 each  played for over a year in one theater in Madrid before general distribution. The music is great but the recorded sound on this DVD is marginal. The video quality is not too good. There are no english subtitles. If you collect spanish classic films or are a Sarita Montiel fan, you should own this DVD. It was finally realeased in the USA in Oct 2003.",1069027200,29,472,4.488372093023256
1906476,3,B0000AINKM,I got this for my mom.  They are some of her favorite films but I expected that the quality be a little better.  I thought it would have been clean up and the sound improved with technology. She loved them any ways.  We watched them together like we did when I was a child.,1439769600,,273,4.018518518518518
1906477,5,B0000AINKM,I have enjoyed her movies and recordings since I was in my teens.,1439164800,,65,4.076923076923077

1906480,5,B0000AINKM,"These are a few comments about the Montiel double feature DVD from DVD VISION -ORO FILMS offering of El ltimo cupl and La violetera.

For those of you seeking the best print of Cupl look no further as it doesnt get any better than the one offered here. It is sharp with well saturated colors. There are a few frames missing in some spots, but after years of prints that belong in the garbage bin, this is good news for fans of Montiel.

If you don't like a lot of songs in your soup you better skip this one as it is a wall-to-wall cupl songbook and then some. This is the usual story of the rise and fall of a beautiful and talented singer, with all the clichs intact, but if you want to see a real movie star at her peak, this is a splendid example of a phenomenon that was and might never be again.

In her book La Montiel stated that Cupl was shot on a shoestring budget and that the film makers were constantly running out of money, but you wouldnt know it from looking at this lavish production. It surely is eye-popping with the ladys incredible beauty as its centerpiece.

Considering the state of most Hispanic film classics offered on DVD, this ceratinly is among the top three prints to be highly recommended.

And now La violetera:  Im afraid the print offered here is not on a par with the first film. It is rather brownish most of the time. Youre better off getting the DVD from DistriMax Inc. This has better color rendering and comes with sharp yellow English subtitles. The only thing that might interest a lover of old songs is that the Double-Feature Oro Films offers in its Extras an isolated lyrics (with the accompanying soundtrack) to all of the Violetera songs. But if you want a decent print, this aint it.

Yes, its a drag to have to buy 2 DVDs, but at these prices, they are certainly affordable.",1431648000,,1823,4.359882005899705
1906481,5,B0000AINKM,"A classical movie. After so many years, it is amazing how well Amazon has preserved the quality, sound and clarity of these movies that I saw

1906482,1,B0000AINKM,"The disc you sent was old and scratchy and I could not enjoy the beautiful music which is why I ordered this movie.  The disc you sent was definitely old and previously used.  I believe I deserve my money back so that I can order another movie, or maybe you can send me a new version of the one you sent.",1423612800,,304,3.9672131147540983

I watched these movies many years ago and I enjoyed them a lot.
These DVDs have no subtitles. And no one indicated so in the Amazon Page",1387324800,,159,4.0
1906496,5,B0000AINKM,"The great Sara Montiel (1928-2013), also affectionately known as Sarita, in what are widely considered to be her 2 most famous movies. This is a veritable treasure. She had many previous films, including USA films, and was fairly well known. Then came  ""El Ultimo Cuple"" (1957), which was at its time and by far the greatest Spanish  box office opener ever, followed by ""La Violetera""(1958), ""Carmen la de Ronda"" (1959), and many others. They made Sarita extremely famous worldwide (maybe with the inexplicable exception of the English-speaking audiences). She was decorated with the maximum medals and honors conferrable to foreign citizens by France, Romania, Brazil, Portugal, the USSR. When I talk to regular French and Russian people old enough to remember, they still have the desire to see her act and hear her sing. She was also highly honored and decorated by the artistic organnizations of the Latinos of the USA. Everybody: enjoy her beauty, her unique make-up style (a white line above the mascara), admire her acting. And, above all, listen to that peculiar voice and style of singing, so smooth and deeply felt, so unique. It once captivated all Romance and Slavic audiences, and then the World. It will captivate you if you listen.  Totally unforgettable.",1387065600,2,1270,5.096153846153846
