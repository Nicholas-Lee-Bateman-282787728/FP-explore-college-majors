8462020,5,B0058OG7DM,"I am always looking for classic 3D films pre 1990, and this fits the bill.  I saw it in the cinema in the 80s and then had home versions using two different 3D TV systems, but this one uses the current Bluray 3D standard and is excellent.  Although an Italian release it plays fine in English and the 3D depth is superb, much better than modern CGI films which to me feel rather flat and 2D.  Bit of a silly story but from a 3D point of view I'd recommend it.",1473033600,,459,4.021978021978022

8462023,5,B0058OG7DM,"I enjoy this movie, although they really don't show the demon as much...  just once in a photograph and again at the end.  But the events in the movie keep my attention as one thing happens after the next, leading up to the final event.  Some crazy stuff happens in that house to a lady named Melanie, and it also gets to the owner's daughter, Susan.  Great movie.",1365465600,2,364,4.3088235294117645
