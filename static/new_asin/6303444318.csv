7848072,5,6303444318,The shipping cost more than this product but it was so worth it.  My daughter wanted this movie for Christmas and I was willing to pay top dollar for it.  Great condition and really fast shipping.,1357430400,,196,4.416666666666667
7848073,4,6303444318,"I was just a little kid when this video first came out and my Grandma bought it for me as a present. I remember watching it over and over and over again. Eventually it got put away and was pulled out again just a few days ago when I was organizing movies. My daughter, who is now just short of four years old herself, saw the cover and insisted we watch it. Being in my twenties now I was more skeptical now than I was then. But she absolutely adores it and she is well on her way to memorizing the whole thing as I did at her age.
  Watching it with eyes untainted by childhood excitement I have to agree with the other reviews, this may not be the best work of Dr. Seuss but I must say it still has a special place in my heart. As close as it is to my heart I could not give it the full five stars, the reason being that there is just one thing about the story have always bothered me. Even as a little kid, I didn't understand how she could be accused of abandoning her friends in order to pursue fortune when she really didn't seem to have any friends at all in the beginning of the film. That point aside, I must say that even after all these years I know every single word to the story and watching it does make me smile (at least it did the first three times my daughter made me watch it with her). So overall, like I stated in the beginning of this review, Daisy-Head Mayzie may not be Dr. Seuss at his finest but it sure is timeless.",1321747200,,1442,3.986159169550173
7848074,1,6303444318,"I agree with ""a customer"": this cartoon should never have been made. As an animation, it's OK, but this is no more worthy of Dr. Seuss' name than a 10-note ringtone deserves to be called ""a newly-discovered Bach masterpiece"".

Seriously. He may have written the outline for this book, but it falls far short of any legitimite production he allowed during his lifetime. Shame on his estate for plumbing his name for gold like this.",1292457600,,430,4.733333333333333
