420437,5,6302038316,"Due to some for of nostalgia, I have been on a recent kick of searching for all the 80's Sword and Sorcery movies as of late.  My favorite rediscovery so far (Excluding the Conan films because their budgets were too high) was Deathstalker II.  This movie has absolutely EVERYTHING you could ever want in a movie:  Violence and Bloodshed, Amazons, T&A, cheesy one liners, and is excessively degrading to women.  In the sequel, Deathstalker isn't some muscle-man, just some guy with a sword. He's not ripped, in fact he's got a bit of a gut (just a bit) which adds to the realism of the movie, except when it is all ripped away by the extras such as Ivan the terrible's henchmen expelled for excessive brutality sitting alongside one of Atilla the hun's former soldiers.  The Pig-headed warrior also makes a return cameo, and a cheesy score that Manowar would be proud of.  infuriate your girlfriend by getting this movie!  Now its on DVD.  I have died and gone to Valhalla....",1007942400,4,975,4.6608187134502925
420438,1,6302038316,"I have seen some bad movies in my time but this takes the cake as the worst. The one-liners in this movie are so corny you bust out laughing. You have to see the sets , cardboard walls and backgrounds that have visble camera lights....
This is horrible...but in a funny way",1001030400,4,273,4.269230769230769
420439,4,6302038316,"This is my favorite of Monique's films (that I've seen) and I believe it is her personal favorite too.  Filmed in Argentina which must have caused problems, the stark scenery is made up for by the large number of wisecracks in this sword and sorcery romp. Monique for once gets the chance to prove that she's more than just a sexy body, although there is a bit of that on view to keep her adoring fans happy. You also get two Moniques for the price of one here, which can't be bad. One is a petulant pouting prima donna of a princess (I bet she enjoyed playing that role!)- the other a chirpy perky peasant girl dashing about in skimpy buckskins. (That alone should be at least worth the cost of a rental!) The hero is suitably brawn without too many brains, as heros often are in these things. This could explain why he seems imune to Monique's charms - although in the end - well, if you haven't seen it I'd better let you find out for yourselves! There is a blooper section at the end and a catchy little theme tune which gets a gag during the film. There are plenty of quirky characters to keep fans of this genre engaged along the way.",996969600,7,1140,4.277777777777778
420500,4,6302038316,"Deathstalker 2 is a fine example of what happens when the film's creators decide ""To Hell With It"" and make the movie THEY want to make. It's probably a perfect example of just how good a B-Movie can be. Conan it is not.
The acting is poor - many of the effects and scenes are shamelessly torn straight out of other movies - and they had to recycle the same three swordsmen over and over again with a variety of different masks - but if anyone were to ever make a parody of the 1980s swords-and-sorcery genre... well, Deathstalker II has already done it - perhaps unwittingly.

Forget Deathstalker 1, 3 and 4.  You don't need to watch them to enjoy this one. In fact, they're terrible.
This, however, is a classic.",1385856000,,714,4.401515151515151
420501,5,6302038316,"This film doesn't take itself too seriously, and has some fantastic comedy value. John Terlesky (Deathstalker) plays it brilliantly for laughs, and this film is one of my favourites from the 80's. One of the great B movies of all time. You will either love it or hate it.",1349481600,,271,4.551020408163265
420502,5,6302038316,"When one of the first lines in the films is a pun on its title, you know you're in for a ride. From scenes where the editor fails to cut away before the actors start laughing after a particularly lame joke, to completely banal scenes with exploding arrows, this film is awful and wonderful.

Oh, and by the way, the film is absolutely nothing like the cover -- but that's standard for the barbarian genre.",1336608000,,405,4.4
420503,5,6302038316,"They say that sequels are rarely as good as the original. However, I've seen several that are even better than the original. Deathstalker 2 is one of them. It's a movie that crams about all the fun you could ask for into 77 minutes. It's a great mix of comedy, action, fantasy, and even horror. There is a scene featuring zombies, which I didn't expect since this isn't a zombie movie. It's a sword and sorcery movie, and it's one of the films included in the Roger Corman's Sword and Sorcery collection. Toni Naples is great in this movie, playing a tough and sexy villianess. It's the kind of role that Julie Strain would perfect in the Andy Sidaris movies she starred in the 90's. Deathstalker 2 is just great fun, another winner from B-movie director Jim Wynorski.",1334448000,,768,4.572463768115942
420504,2,6302038316,"I just saw this for the first time. Funny how people think this is better than the first. As far as the ladies go, my favorite by far is the topless dancer that is the main focal point during the bar brawl scene. Any idea who she is?",1316563200,,233,3.875
420505,5,6302038316,"I must say, I've never seen the 1st movie which precedes this, but...
This one Is a Riot! John Terlesky, while not as bulked up as Conan, portrayed an acceptable, as well as humorous 'stalker! Toni Naples is HOT as Sultana (a deadly woman with a blade of her own)! Monique Gabrielle is all of Charming, Humorous and Sexy all in one (as both the Princess that seems a little kooky and the devilish clone of her and what are her ultimate aims?)! If you're looking for plenty of action and laughs, this could be a great choice! I must warn that there are some revealing scenes in here as well (which isn't necessarily advocated for children).",1301875200,3,639,4.47008547008547
420506,4,6302038316,"I absolutely love this movie, its great for mindless fun. It has some very quotable lines. If you like B movies, then this is one for you. It doesnt take itself seriously at all, and I think it makes fun of over 50 different tv shows or movies in the course of its dialog. Buy this movie, in no way will you be sorry you did. However, if at all possible...skip Deathstalker I.",1290902400,,376,4.164383561643835
420507,4,6302038316,"This is pretty decent as a guilty pleasure. Not very good on the level of a bad movie you can sit around and laugh with your friends. The kind of movie you can pop a boner to and laugh at the same time. A rare breed indeed. Also, there's a porn floating around with the chick from this movie. I suggest not watching that porn as it degrades subsequent viewings of this movie tremendously. I'll never watch this again.",1289865600,,417,4.291139240506329

420509,4,6302038316,"Also a reviewer had found no Slavic-originating cast artists' surnames in this film article, a story of a good orphan princes taking back her kingdom from bad guys is really entertaining and on any taste sexy and funny while steady murdering depicted as a sci-fi gothic/wimpier comedy with love-making somehow somewhere.

There is much hinted at during about a two hour non-stop history-linked action.",1253404800,,401,5.265625
420550,4,6302038316,"A horrible movie that's actually a lot of fun.  I never heard of the ""Detahstalker"" straight-to-video franchise before this flick, but enjoyed it anyway.  Long after cut-rate foreign studios mined the Conan-genre dry, ""Deathstalker"" was still trodding the sands of swords&sandals territory with cheap production values, dumb-gags and nonexistent scripts.

Story?  Deathstalker, free-booting adventurer, steps in to save the life of the impoverished Reena, a fortuneteller marked for death by angry customers (she foretells the birth of children to men other than husbands).  Reena, as it turns out, is a princess deposed by Jarek the sorcerer.  In her place, Jarek has installed Reena's magically-created clone - but the process that created the clone won't allow Jarek to kill the original.  There's also Sultana, a warrior who's as beautiful as she is fiercely insistent to...

Oh, does it matter what it's about?  You'll probably forget about it two minutes after your player has spat the tape out.  (Did somebody make this available on DVD?)  However, ""Deathstalker"" is one of those flicks that taps into its own flaws in a good way.  Much like the story and the main character, ""Deathstalker"" seems like a good-natured relic of a lost age, never really following any path other than that that provides some (cheap) thrills.  Nowhere near as poorly solemn as the ""Ator"" movies, nor as just misguided as ""Barbarians"", ""Deathstalker"" is a movie you just know is junk, yet one you can sit through.  The best thing here is John Lazar (that's right - ""Z-man"" is back, and he's handy-as-ever with a sword!!) hamming it up as the evil Jarek.",1156723200,,1638,5.086142322097379
420551,5,6302038316,"Yeah, this is a sequel with nothing to do with the first one, and yeah, it's no Conan, but it doesn't try to be. Just remember who the writer/director is (the esteemed Jim Wynorski), take your mind off the hook, and go with it!

The premise (soldier of fortune helps a princess in disguise regain the throne)is classic, but it's all told with such a goofy tone that comparison with a more serious film is, well, goofy.

If you have the DVD edition with the director's commentary, you'll see where Wynorski was going when he made the film. The script is full of in-jokes from other movies in the genre, jokes from television, and more than enough one liners to fill a dozen old Bob Hope movies. You also get John LaZar (from Beyond the Valley Of The Dolls) as the evil sorcerer, Monique Gabrielle (of a zillion b-movies) as the damsel in distress, and Toni Naples in black leather as Sultana, who swings a mean sword.

Add to that a gazillion extras (all masked so they can be used over and over in other scenes), lots of wooden swords painted silver, a fight to the death with Queen Kong (featuring Amazon ring girls holding up the round number painted on cardboard). Yep friends and neighbors, this one leaves no clich unheard. Do I recommend it? Wholeheartedly. Genre fans won't be disappointed.",1116633600,5,1297,4.581896551724138
420552,5,6302038316,"From the moment, in the opening sequence, when Sultana's (the delicious Toni Naples) vow ""I'll have my revenge - and Deathstalker too"", heralds the title - ""Deathstalker 2"" on screen, accompanied by Chuck Cirino's amazing score, I fell totally in love with this movie! No sad Conan clone this!

Cult director Jim Wynorski has quite simply given us one of the most entertaining movies of all time.

The masterful casting of John Terleskey as our wisecracking hero and the gorgeous, scantily-clad Monique Gabrielle in her inspired double-role, ensures a whole laboratory of sexual chemistry between the highly picturesque duo. They also look like they're enjoying this bawdy romp no end!

The unprecedented amount of inspired one-liners, corny puns and cheeky verbal and visual references to other movies (most notably Spaghetti Westerns, Hammer Horror and Star Wars) demand repeat viewing to extract every delicious drop of Wynorsky's waggery.

The plot is a simple one - our eponymous hero (but is Deathstalker his first name or his last name?), promised a great reward, teams up with Evie the seer (Gabrielle), whose rightful position of princess has been taken by an evil clone of herself (evil Evie of course). Battling their way past zombies, pirates, and Amazon tribeswomen, Terleskey and Gabrielle never miss an opportunity to extract every potential bit of humour from each scenario. The other players join in the fun too - John La Zar, as evil wizard (is there any other kind?) Jerak warns Deathstalker that grave-robbing carries a stiff penalty in these parts, Sultana pokes fun at Evie's wardrobe (the Wilma Flintstone look) and pirate Chin (a tribute to Hawaii 5-O) and his hapless team are to bounty-hunting what the Archbishop of Canterbury is to bungee-jumping.

Scene follows glorious scene, my personal favourites being the initial punch-up in the tavern, evil Evie tiring of her musical dwarf playing nothing but the Deathstalker theme, Deathstalker's hilarious fight against the Amazon's champion and , of course, the final scene - when told that his heroic exploits will be reenacted for centuries to come, Deathstalker grins and says ""Well, I sure hope they get a good looking guy to play me"". What a parting shot!

There's no mistaking the miniscule budget here, and there's even some footage recycled from the (inferior) Deathstalker 1 and a couple of amusing inadvertent anachronisms and continuity errors. With a movie as refreshingly entertaining as this, who cares though?

The DVD contains the outtakes (the same as were also present during the end titles on the VHS version), the theatrical trailer and, delightfully, optional full-length commentary by Wynorsky, Terleskey and Naples. This is very very funny, and adds yet another dimension to the whole package, as Wynorsky flirts with Naples and points out anachronisms, such as a tyre visible as our heroes ride past.

For potential UK purchasers, make sure your DVD player is multi-region, as this is only available as Region 1 (NTSC). My copy took around 10 days to arrive from the States. At this price, Deathstalker 2 has to be the DVD bargain of the century!

You will either think it is brilliant or complete garbage! I am convinced that most viewers with a sense of fun, will decide it is the former.",1109635200,5,3288,5.085343228200371
420553,5,6302038316,"This is a great ""B"" movie.  I rated it a 5, which i don't ever hand out to ""B"" movies, but as far as they go, this is one of the greatest.  Obviously it can't compare with greats like BraveHeart and such, but you have to know what you're getting into before watching this.

I believe there are 4 Death Stalker movies.  1 and 4 try to be ""serious"", kind of like Conan rip-offs.... not real great.  2 and 3 go the more ""humorous"" route, with 3 failing pretty badly.

But Death Stalker 2 is GREAT!  Adventure, comedy, action, slashing, and for those that like beautiful women in their movies, Monique Gabrielle doesn't disappoint!

Be ready for a cheesy movie, but it's fun cheesy!  Lots of great (and bad) one-liners throughout.  :)",1107475200,10,730,4.462121212121212
420554,1,6302038316,"OMG. This is a sequel to a Conan rip off. I mean, this movie has greatness written all over it. The first one was made to be semi serious, but it didn't exactly come out smelling like roses. So the creators saw what they had to do to redeem themselves. Make a tongue in cheek sequel. So they made this abomination. This movie had some one liners that were pretty funny, and then it had others that came out as ridiculous as a man wearing clown shoes in a mine field. This movie is good for watching with friends so that you can laugh and have a good time. But otherwise, don't bother.

What I learned from Deathstalker 2: Huts do not have doors, and barbarians carry ninja stars as weapons.

If you liked this movie, I recomend: Better taste in movies.

Caution! Conan fans will be offended.",1091836800,4,791,4.331081081081081
420555,3,6302038316,"One can only think that Sam Raimi is a fan of this movie as he seems to have copied much of the camp from this film.  Once the camp has been removed, Deathstalker II is mostly a collection of clips lifted from the first movie.
Deathstalker is out plying his thieving trade when he happens on a seer who seems to be more trouble than she is worth.  You know the tone of the film when the seer asks him if Deathstalker is his first or last name.
What plot there is consists of Deathstalker being convinced to help the seer return to her throne, one occupied by a sorcerous double.
Along the way we get profession wrestling with a giant Amazon, the attack of the shuffling zombies, plenty of scenes from the first movie, lots of bad jokes, anachronisms galore, heaps of nudity, and a few truckloads of camp.
As this was not the serious film that the first was, it is more successful in its goal.  Just imagine a Bruce Campbell King of Thieves movie (except most of the wisecracks come from the seer) and you will get an idea of what to expect.  It's fun.  Really.",1069977600,6,1060,4.306532663316583
420556,5,6302038316,"Deathstalker II RULES!!!!
It's the best low-budget, comedy, fantasy T&A filled epic EVER.
But enough about the film, we all know that's great, onto the DVD.
The picture quality is fine, although it's best to turn the brightness up on your tv as it's quite dark(this isn't the DVD's fault I have a brighter VHS version but it just seems faded).
This is not cropped so you get to see the full picture, cars and spare tires too.
Audio, addiquate, gotta love that deathstalker II theme.
Extras:
The audio commentary is informative and funny, you really think this movie was fun to make, it has a trailer to.
Bad Points:
It would have been nice if this had had a multistream option like the T2 disc. So you could choose between the normal version and the Director's Cut. What this would mean is that the disc would skip the clips of DS1 and Barbarian Queen and the extra long fight footage to make it a more concise viewing experience. Although not having this option isn't worth dropping a star as you still get to see everything but have to skip the bits yourself. More out-takes would have been nice, but I guess you'll have to live with the ones in the credits.",1022025600,13,1160,4.476415094339623
420557,5,6302038316,"Simply a great DVD. This is personally my favorite movie in the Deathstalker series. It's worth it just for the excellent full-length commentary. The picture and sound transfer are very clear and sharp. There are also some added scenes, lost scenes and extended scenes not in the VHS versions.

For DS2 fans who have the VHS version and are wondering if the DVD version is worth buying: Yes!  This version includes a feature-length audio commentary by director Jim Wynorski, Toni Naples (Sultana), and John Terlesky (Deathstalker himself) for behind-the-scenes information you didn't even know you wanted to know....

This was supposed to be a serious Sword and Sorcery movie but, lacking the budget to pull that off, they turned it into a fun, cheesy romp through time...and they did it very well! You may catch references to other movies and cartoons. If you're void of a sense of humor and the movie doesn't manage to entertain you, you still get to watch a beautiful 25 year old John Terlesky run around in leather pants and loin cloths...if you are into that! For those of you who prefer beautiful, half naked women, you won't be disappointed either.
