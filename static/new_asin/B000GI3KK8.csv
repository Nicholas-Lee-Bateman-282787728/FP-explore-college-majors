2613366,5,B000GI3KK8,"Being an avid reader of Buk's stuff for the past 20 years or so; it occurred to me that I had never seen him on film or for that matter even heard the man speak. After considering the volumes of his verse I had consumed prior to viewing this film I was still not prepared for what I was about to see. Just watch this and you'll feel closer to the writer, closer to yourself and ultimately - closer to truth.",1182384000,2,407,4.037037037037037
2613367,5,B000GI3KK8,"Although a bit ""Euro"" in its presentation (cheesy French piano in between sections), the substance of these two DVDs is solid.  Nothing beats an interview with Charles Bukowski.  His looks are as honest and peculiar as what comes out of his mouth.  But, don't just watch the DVDs...  his written poetry is just as captivating.  He takes you back to scenes in the 70s and 80s that are long gone now.  In his writing though, they are right there...  present tense.",1177286400,3,462,4.62962962962963
2613368,4,B000GI3KK8,"Schroeder made an interesting choice in conducting this interview. Very little formal questioning was posed, he in fact very rarely interjects any commentary.

 Bukowski seems to be a little disarmed by the format. Sometimes he seems closed off and embarrassed. Sometimes he seems too drunk to make a coherent point. However sometimes the format creates a level of openness and magic happens when Bukowski talks.

 Its these moments that one watches the Bukowski tapes for, to me they were quite profound. Bukowski allows you in, past the drunkeness, past the angry shell.

 You actually get something out of these tapes, unlike the terrible documentary 'Born Into This'.",1174608000,5,671,5.224299065420561
2613369,5,B000GI3KK8,"All who fail to view this DVD are doomed to a life of ignorance and a sorrowful lack of wisdom.

John Martin was the most eloquent interviewee.

The celebrities seemed to be at a loss for words, apart from Tom Waits, who read just the right (Buk's) words.",1163030400,6,255,4.291666666666667
2613370,5,B000GI3KK8,"2006 seems to be the year for Bukowski on dvd and it's about time! between this and BORN INTO THIS, fans of Buk have a reason to rejoice, and pray there's more stuff in the vaults. I won't go into any production details about THE CHARLES BUKOWSKI TAPES because it's all in the product description, but I will say that it's a four-hour tour into the mind and thoughts of CB broken down into 52 short chapters. if you're a non-fan, it probably won't win you over, but anyone curious as to the thought process of this author who arguably changed the face of modern lit and poetry will be sucked in. for those who think this two-disc set is just the ramblings of an old drunk are wrong: CB is very cogent and thoughtful. some might say Bukowski was pathetic, I say PROPHETIC, and his works will stand the test of time. P.S. for optimum viewing, add a few ADULT beverages and get the kids out of the room.",1159056000,23,900,4.3
8132497,5,B000GI3KK8,"Bukowski (1987)

Bukowski is drunk, reads poetry, talks about life amongst other things. In all, it's interesting because Bukowski was such a good writer and you'll be pulled in.

I read all of Bukowski's work and loved the stuff, especially Post Office: A Novel by Charles Bukowski, Factotum by Charles Bukowski and Pulp by Charles Bukowski.

If you don't like Bukowski then you'll probably be bored out of your mind. Some people have trouble because he drank so much and lived in some shoddy place in L.A. Bukowski was also an admitted dipsomaniac and barfly. At least the guy was honest. I like a writer who is honest. You really do find honesty in Bukowski's work.

Bukowski is drunk, reads poetry, talks about life amongst other things.

You'll be pulled in.",1452470400,,763,4.793893129770993
8132498,2,B000GI3KK8,"Now this is old footage. It wasn't filmed in a wide-screen aspect ratio.

But the FOOLS who transferred this footage to DVD simply STRETCHED the video to fit into a wide-screen format.

What a crime!

Everyone's head looks stretched like a big bubble.

Hard to watch and very disrespectful to the source material.

It's more enjoyable to watch on YouTube where it has been posted in the correct aspect ratio.",1365120000,3,408,4.771428571428571
8132499,5,B000GI3KK8,"These tapes are hilarious!  Insights into bukowski's thinking process and drunkenness.  Yes, he is drinking a beer through most of these candid interviews.  The interviewer is allowing Bukowski to be himself as travel down a few streets and onto various porches and couches.  His speeches verge on being incoherent, but somehow you manage to get the message and even when he is being vulgar and, at times, emotional, he's still charming and lovable throughout.  The video is low quality, but it doesn't really matter.  There are some amazing scenes here.",1317945600,,554,5.1
8132500,5,B000GI3KK8,"A must see for all hardcore Bukowski fans! If you are NOT a Buk fan, you can probably skip it.",1309046400,,94,3.75
8132501,5,B000GI3KK8,"Terrific. A face and voice to match the unrivaled writer/poet. I feel closer to the man. Although he is older and less pugnacious there are moments where one can see the edge that created America's greatest modern day poet... The soft voice is unexpected and adds to the aura of the man, but the grizzled face tells no lies... Tattoos have receipts, but scars tell the truth and Hank has plenty...",1303171200,,397,4.605633802816901
8132502,5,B000GI3KK8,You can't go wrong with these tapes if you are a Bukowski fan and perhaps even if your not. These are very inresting and entertaining.  They arrived in mint condition and on time.  We have really enjoyed watching them and seeing another side of Bukowski.,1280534400,,254,4.622222222222222
8132503,5,B000GI3KK8,I have been a fan of Hank's now for about 3 years and when I saw this DVD I didn't have the money to buy it but bought it anyway. You know when you want to buy something and then your conscience reminds you not to buy it for whatever reason? Well I ignored it and I am glad because this is some of the best footage of Hank in action. He pours his heart out on all subjects like a wise sage and explains himself a little better among the company of Barbet and Joe and the other guys making this one of the best chronicles of the man himself. Worth every penny and worth putting the car insurance off for another week.,1280016000,,616,3.975806451612903
8132504,2,B000GI3KK8,"I bought this DVD 6 months ago.  AND I STILL HAVEN'T FINISHED WATCHING IT.  Watch grass grow, watch paint dry.  But to sit thru this DVD in one sitting... you will have to hide the knives in your kitchen from yourself.  It has some cool footage, but in modern day times this movie is just too Terribly produced.  You'll think that you could have edited the movie better yourself.  Unless you want it as a collector, don't think for one second this is a GOOD FILM.  Its NOT.  I'm a fan of Bukowski's writing.  And Bukowski Born Into This.  This movie will make you wanna punch your drunk uncle.",1231891200,4,593,4.3577981651376145
8132505,5,B000GI3KK8,"I didn't have time to watch the whole DVD, but so far the tapes are exactly what I expected: raw, funny and sometimes, sad.
Bukowski was a character of himself and that role playing was a form to sustain his dignity in the quite hostile environment he was in almost all his life: bad parents, bad jobs, bad women, cheap booze, lack of money. So that's why he tried - and in the tapes this is apparent sometimes - to build a myth of his past, and amused doing that.
But it doen't mean that he is not true or authetic (his bad skin and bad teeth expose everything about his past). It only means that, from time to time, Bukowski looks TOO MUCH Bukowski than one would expect.
Overall, the DVD is a great document about one of the great 20th century american writers and gives to his readers a live and deep insight to some of his thoughts and poems.",1188777600,5,847,4.234567901234568
8132506,5,B000GI3KK8,"Into Bukowski I went, and unlike any other Bukowski footage, I was able to leer into the person, the man, the human being beyond the author.  I was able to see Bukowski in a light where I could call him ""Charles"" and feel a personable aura this documentary captured unlike most others.

Charles Bukowski is often associated with an eccentrically-driven tough-guy kind of image, and he's tough, yeah, but he's tough in a complex way unbeknownst to most of the public.

In this recording, Charles is ""Charles"" before he is singularly a world-famous author, ""Bukowski,"" and we are treated to an intimacy otherwise shelved away.  Especially take note of the seen where he visits his old childhood home, recounting the abuse his father gave him;  it's here that you see his sensitivity and humanity best:  ""Let's forget it, okay,"" he says to the journalist, as he recounts his beatings in the old bathroom.

Okay, maybe...but we won't forget you, Charles.  Thank you for the gift of your literature.",1185753600,5,994,4.875
