7889179,5,6305436347,"This is most likely the best Roy Rogers dvd on the market today. 3 restored movies from ROAN GROUP ARCHIVAL ENTERTAINMENT ( on one disc ) and they're all winners!

DAYS OF JESSE JAMES (1939) directed by Joe Kane has Roy & Gabby siding with Jesse played by Don ""Red"" Barry.

ROLL ON TEXAS MOON (1946) directed by William Whitney is one of my personal favorites as Roy tries to clear up a scrap between the sheepmen and cattlemen. I like when Gabby ( a cattleman ) is always being followed by Dale's pet lamb. He yells, "" ...quit follerin' me ya walkin' lamb chop! ""...This is the uncut theatrical version.

KING OF THE COWBOYS (1943) also directed by Joe Kane is the big WINNER here. Combining several source prints this version runs longer than it's original theatrical version & also includes alternate scenes as a bonus.

All 3 films LOOK GREAT & it's a real treat to watch them presented as such.

Another great bonus is a Trucolor short of Roy welcoming Roy Rogers Riders Club members to this weeks movie at the local theater.

All in all this dvd is A MUST for all Roy Rogers Fans!!!

As Gabby would say,"" That's the ticket by crackie!"".

BUY THIS.",1179964800,12,1153,4.457142857142857

Being a Brit who grew up going to Saturday morning pictures,its great to be able to see some of his  films in SUPERB clarity and pretty good sound. A nice touch was the Roy  Rogers Club short which is also the great thing about DVD, you get a lot  for your money. All in all, a great deal and good films. Please keep them  coming!",967766400,33,379,4.013333333333334
