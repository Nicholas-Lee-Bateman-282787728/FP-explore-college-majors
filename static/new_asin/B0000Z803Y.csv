8004717,1,B0000Z803Y,"I feel sorry for all the people who appeared in front of the camera; including the few members of the public spending a day at the beach and seen briefly in the background of a few shots, curious about what all the fuss happening 'over there' (i.e. filming) was about. If this production was a film school final project, it should state so in the description and then I would cut it some slack. However, if this was made by filmmakers who considered themselves professionals -- they should have taken the camcorder back to the rental shop and stayed home. Its neither a B movie, nor a camp one. Its just downright bad and embarrassing.",1319068800,,635,4.530434782608696
8004718,4,B0000Z803Y,"Movies like this always brings back memories, maybe it's just all the sun,surf and tanned bodies.  Gidget movies will never compare.  I loved the campness,the ridiculous back drops, acting, weak plot, but it's still enjoyable and definately for the older girls!! These types of movies you just can't rent from the local video shop - well not in Australia anyway. Enjoy it for what it is, clean fun!!",1287705600,,399,4.852941176470588
8004719,5,B0000Z803Y,"This movie won the hearts (and the laughs) of queer film festival

audiences across the country. And it should. It's so sharp that even with next to no budget, Film Fatale productions has made one of the campiest, most successful lesbian parody flicks to date. It's one of those ""it's sooooo bad, it's soooooo good.""

Four old(ish) sexy surfer pals reunite on the beaches of Hawaii to celebrate a 40th birthday and a divorce (how gay). The ladies in bikinis hit the beach, cocktails in hand, wit on call, revenge on the brain, and sex on the.....everything.

The one-liners are amazing; the spoof of a low-budget is even more amazing (like the rubber shark attack); and every scene is funny (not to mention pretty hot). A very clever, and sexy, parody.",1143417600,3,752,4.7251908396946565
8004720,4,B0000Z803Y,"I saw this movie at Outfest with a theater full of women, all of whom couldn't stop laughing.  This movie has been made with no budget, but the producers made a conscious decision not to hide the lack of money and the result is that even the rubber shark is funny.  Georgia Ragsdale has written some great one-liners for this.  Beware, straight folks probably won't get a lot of the jokes.  Even the cliche'd ending is okay because the trip there is so much fun.
You won't regret the 90 minutes spent with these three ladies.",1069891200,11,525,4.4375
