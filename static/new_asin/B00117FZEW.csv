8240848,4,B00117FZEW,This was a gift and the recipient was thrilled with it.  He has watched it already and will again soon I'm sure.,1390348800,2,112,4.090909090909091
8240849,4,B00117FZEW,"The first part of the video showed how the B-36 was structurally tested to find problems and weaknesses and how the problems and weaknesses were fixed, which I found interesting. The second part of the video showed views of the B-36 taking off, flying, and landing, and B-36 air crews. In some cases, in the second part of the video, it seemed like the same parts of film were being used over and over again just to add to length to the video.",1279584000,6,443,4.349397590361446

It shows you what it was like to be a member of a crew that flew the B-36. It has excellent newsreel footage, as well as scenes of the crew preparing for a mission. You get to see this aircraft from every angle. Some of this video has narration and some of it has music with captions.",1268265600,11,680,7.9605263157894735
8240851,1,B00117FZEW,"I do not recommend Men of Sac & the B-36, most of the DVD is silent and you do not know what is carrying on, scenes are repetitive and very boring; narration would have helped a lot.  I purchased this for a former crew member and he was disappointed.",1231027200,14,250,4.1020408163265305
