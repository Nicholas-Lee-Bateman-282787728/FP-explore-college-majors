8555402,4,B00AOJ5PVQ,This is four movies that although somewhat interesting were not inspiratonal to me.  The third movie Wounded Hearts is the best movie doesnt mention anything about God or church.  It was about a wounded heart devistated by loss who is learning to love again. The other three did have a story line of someone sinning and admitting they were wrong. Only He who finds a wife shows two lives whos relationship w God changed and through that forgiveness their lives changed.,1372723200,,469,4.777777777777778
