7837547,5,6303111904,"Come December 14th, it will mark 41 years since my very first drum lesson.  In all these many years, I have practiced numerous hours and spoken to scores of fellow percussionists.  Seldom has anyone, including myself, had much significant contribution in the area of drum tuning.  We all just sort of wing it with what we perceive as a ""good"" sound.
Bob Gatzen has forever altered my thinking and approach to drum tuning.  Bob has finally revealed the hidden mystery of maximizing the unrealized potential of every drum.
If you think that you know everything about drumming, Bob will surely blow your mind.
Hey Bob, if you ever read this:  where were you in 1962, when I really needed you???
Respects to All,
