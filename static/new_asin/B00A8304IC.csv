5399577,4,B00A8304IC,"This was a fairly enjoyable show. At its core, this is a series about a couple of high school kids, centered around main character Kaito Kirishima, who attempt to shoot a film together during their summer break. Thrown into the mix is an alien girl, Ichika Takatsuki (who passes off as a ""foreign exchange student""), who traveled to Earth in an attempt to find a location on Earth she remembers vividly from a picture.

Its largely slice-of-life, meaning it follows the characters during their everyday dealings with each other. There are sci-fi things thrown in as well, since the main heroine is an alien. However, the bread and butter of this series is the romantic parts. Almost every character is in love with another one, but they are afraid to confess either because they're afraid of rejection and causing awkwardness within the group. Otherwise they know that their love interest likes someone else, and either bear the burden alone, or try to hook them up together, knowing full well that its going to cost them a chance at happiness. If you've ever experienced anything like that, you'll probably connect to these characters. Or you'll probably just want to smack them on the head for dragging their feet on that topic. But those scenes really do tend to tug at your heartstrings.

There are some comedic elements as well, usually with Ichika's pet/computer Rinon, a small cute blob-like object that also interfaces with her ship, and one hilarious incident involves Ichika using an unconscious Kaito's head to cover herself when her towel begins to unravel in the first episode, right in front of his sister and a female friend, no less. They also make numerous references to Men in Black, which plays an important role later in the series.

The show is mostly slow paced, although the sci-fi scenes do ramp things up when they occur, such as Ichika's sister arriving on Earth. It also has a small callback to Please Teacher, so if you liked that series, you'll enjoy this one as well.",1355356800,15,1997,4.816326530612245
5399578,5,B00A8304IC,"So much. I first saw it about a year ago and fell in love. It's like Super 8 in Japan. So good. I'm sad that we don't have a dub yet, but I can't complain too much because the sub is amazing by itself. It's truly a great show that deserves any praise it gets. Plus the art and animation are beautiful.",1395619200,,301,3.870967741935484
5399579,2,B00A8304IC,"I watched this anime online from a fan subbing group. It was good enough that I went and purchased the DVD from Sentai Filmworks, only to find in the first episode that some of the subtitles were not even discernable words. By that I mean a sentence would read something like ""Hi, Joe, how are hwi today?"" This problem came up twice in the beginning of episode one so I quit watching it. I don't know why any company would release something without watching it first. Definitely watch online!",1391299200,,492,4.53932584269663
5399580,5,B00A8304IC,"I love this anime it is so touching! It is right up on the top of my list with SAO, Cowboy bebop, Ano hana and darker than black! I would recommend this series to any anime person.",1388534400,,180,3.891891891891892
5399581,3,B00A8304IC,"What else can I say? Toradora's my favourite romcom anime, so I should be praising this, right? Wrong. While the show has soooo many awesome moments of feels with laughs and tears, it doesn't go on long enough to really get the viewer to completely cuddle up and cry like anohana or even toradora. Also, while a lot of the characters had very ""real"" things to say, most of them lost the chance to develop their characters because they were to busy worrying about who likes who so much, they forgot why. Still worth watching, and it makes a nice addition to my anime shelf. I don't think I'll be rewatching this one for awhile though. It was so lost between scifi, romance and slice of life, that there was no real categorization to this show. Not exactly a bad thing though. I liked how strange the premise was, and how it actually helped romantic development. I just wish there was a little more thought required or involved in the scifi aspect, even though I'm a romcom junkie.",1382918400,,979,4.50561797752809
5399582,5,B00A8304IC,"The characters, humor, and animation are all great. A great watch, especially in the summertime. Five more words required. Yes.",1374105600,,127,5.4
5399583,5,B00A8304IC,"I didn't realise when I ordered this series, that is written by Ysuke Kuroda, the guy behind the excellent 'Please Teacher!' and 'Please Twins!' animes of a few years back, but within a very short time, I knew it was by him; there are too many similarities for it to be a coincidence. That is not a criticism, but his style is so recognisable, and even some of the characters are dead ringers for those in the 'Please!' stories; if you watched and enjoyed those stories, you will love 'Waiting...' Even some of the locations in the story (in and around Karuizawa) are recognisable from 'Please!' as well.

This story follows a group of high-school friends who decide to make a movie over their summer break. Kaito Kirishima discovers his late grandfathers 8mm movie camera, and decides to use it to film the movie. He is out one night testing the camera with some new high-ISO film, when he is fatally injured by something that falls out of the sky. But, he awakens to find everything is OK, so he assumes he must have dreamt it all. However, unknown to him, he was accidentally killed, and then resurrected, by an alien girl called Ichika Takatsuki, whose damaged spacecraft crashed to earth, and she then used her alien nanotechnology to restore him to full health. Said alien girl, the pretty, bespectacled and red-headed Ichika, then joins Kaito's school as a transfer student, basically to keep an eye on him and make sure he is OK. He doesn't remember her, and through a sequence of events, she ends up staying with him in his home, as she has nowhere else to go, and Kaito's big sister Nanami, with whom he shares the house, following their parent's deaths years before, has to go away on business for some time, so she entrusts Kaito to Ichika's care while she is away. Needless to say, love blossoms between the two, complete with lots of blushes, heartache, misunderstandings, (near) kisses, and angst from some of the other girls, who like Kaito, and become jealous of the 'new girl's' growing closeness to him.

I won't say any more, so as not to spoil things, but the story is cute, innocent, and heart-warming, the group of friends being, in the main, caring and selfless, and always on the lookout for one another. It is emotional, and very good fun. Cue the inevitable beach days, festivals ('matsuri') complete with cute 'yukata' and too much to eat, school culture days, embarrassing incidents involving underwear (or rather, the lack thereof!) and guys getting slapped, and called 'baka!' by the girls! There is little in the way of 'fan-service'. I hope there will be a sequel; I would love to know if Kaito and Ichika do end up together forever (as they promised each other), and if the others in the group sort out their feelings for one another (there being several love triangles going on amongst them!).

Picture and sound are excellent; there is a 16:9 aspect ratio, and the soundtrack is Japanese language/English subs only. Even the music is great! If you liked the 'Please!' stories, and other similar ones, you will love this. Just buy it; it's excellent!",1371945600,3,3085,4.719851576994434
5399584,5,B00A8304IC,This show like many others that section 23 releases need a blu ray release the reason why because its a good show this story is so memorable and so pure hearted and has gratifying ending that frankly makes you wanting more and leaves a void of emptiness because of how good the show is please section23 release a blu ray soon i will buy it oh and before i forget this show is directed by my most recent favorite director Tatsuyuki Nagai who has done some notable works such as Toradora a comedy and one of my favorites Anohana:The Flower we saw that day if haven't seen them check them out Anohana is like a slice of life and a sad story as well as A Certain Scientific Railgun.,1371254400,,678,4.263565891472868
5399585,5,B00A8304IC,"Great series, unfortunately short but very sweet. Definitely a must buy for anime fans of all sorts or at least sci fi/ romance fans",1369353600,,132,4.541666666666667
5399586,4,B00A8304IC,"Honestly, I was surprised by how much I liked this series.  I would have given it 5 stars.  However, I'm pulling a move that I usually HATE when reviewers do, sorry Sentai Filmworks.  This really needs a Blu-Ray release.  Hence I deducted a star.  There are 1080 masters available for the series and there's plenty of Japanese BD releases.  Granted this is a Showgate release, and I don't know if they aren't providing 1080 masters, or if Sentai Filmworks just isn't investing in a BD release.
The reason why I'm upset about this, is that I love resolution on a beautiful series, which this is.  The composition and color used are just great.  The story as previously put, is about a summer romance with a twist.  Honestly, the twist intertwines into a beautiful love story between multiple characters, which really makes them come alive.  One which makes me pine for my youth and those summers filled with crushes, and adventures.
When put into the climax of the series, it has one of the most beautiful endings that I've ever seen in a series.  I'm by far a cynic in many media, and I don't cry easily.  The ending of this series makes me sob like a single woman during an Anne of Green Gables marathon.  However, they are tears of joy and makes me feel young again.  The entire series puts a very fine point and captures youth explicitly and succinctly. This is a series that I wish I could convince many non-Anime watchers to see, because it's that beautiful.",1369267200,13,1463,4.576923076923077
5399587,4,B00A8304IC,"From the creator of Onegai Teacher and Twins, Kaito is a enthusiastic film maker, using an old 8mm camera and taking some home movies.  However things change when a flash of light crashes into the lake he is near and all he remembers is a hand reaching for him.  The next day he meets with his classmates and they decide to make a indie movie over the summer break, where they are joined by two uperclassmen - Rinon and Itchika, the new transfer student.  But on the way home he sees Itchika fishing by the river and he finds out that she has no where to go.  He invites her to stay at his house for the day and after her bath he collapses.  His sister and childhood friend (who has a crush on him) finds them in the foyer, him unconcious and her pretty much naked.  But little do they know at the time the new transfer student is actually an alien who has come to earth to find a memory left behind.  And this starts the story of a group of friends who start off making a movie, but end up learning more about each other and discovering that it is not what you are, but who you are inside.

This is was an entertaining show that follows the Onegai formula, in fact you pretty much have each person there, the quiet hero, the boisterous male friend, the one with a crush on the hero, the cute shy girl, Ichigo (need i say more), and the attractive alien (who is a student this time not a teacher).  It did have the usual funny parts, the embarassing moments, and a lot of self discovery.  While nothing new, it does go to show that the tried and true formula will always make for a good show.  Enjoy.",1365379200,5,1600,4.17915309446254
8548148,5,B00A8304IC,I like this anime. Both artwork and story was good. It remaind me of another anime. It's called Please Teacher. Which is also good. Both story same yet not!  The end was good. The girl came back. You can see it in the film that they made.,1458777600,,238,4.0638297872340425
8548149,5,B00A8304IC,"It's weird to find something you didn't know you wanted to watch and having found this, makes me extremely happy. I have to say this series caught me off guard. It's  very beautifully animated, has some of te most memorable and likable characters, has a very nice soundtrack and is over all an amazing experience. It may bother some that this isn't out in a blu ray release, but this doesn't really bother me as i don't own a blu ray player. I am just so happy to be able to own this wonderful series, as i am sure i will keep coming back to it again and again.",1451952000,,561,4.146788990825688

8548152,5,B00A8304IC,"If youve never heard of this series don't feel bad, even I who is a fan of the series its based on (onegai teacher/twins) didn't know this existed. But I'll tell you now, if you love romance anime or in general touching stories, Buy this don't even read my review... Well read my review then buy it. Anyways as usual heres my review.

Story wise you have our main character who seeks to film everything, he loves his old camera and he loves filming stuff. However one night he ends up filming what seems like a strange light and before he knows it he wakes up at home like it never happened. Oddly as well just before summer break a new girl transfers in... What ensues is a plot of galactic proportions as our main man ends up finding this summer, along with his friends, one of heartbreak, love, sorrow and magic. Waiting in the summers story isn't anything brand new but how it handles its short story, 12 eps,  allows for character growth and realism Ive never seen in any anime before. Animation wise, its very bare bone art but I think that is what makes even the crazier moments seem possible. Characters look like they represent summer and it's a nice change of pace. Sound is very nice as well, great opening and closing songs and a good Japanese cast of voice actors, no dub. Overall waiting in the summer made me cry as it finished, its again only 12 episodes (there is an ova but it's not on this set)  but it was such a great watch I want to see it again soon. Buy this show and trust me you won't regret it.",1437523200,,1521,4.2926829268292686
8548153,5,B00A8304IC,One of the best shows I've ever seen. The DVD is also very nice!,1427846400,,64,3.642857142857143

8548156,5,B00A8304IC,"The first thing I need to address is how Sentai chose to advertise this show.  While the cover image is beautiful, and captures the tone of the show pretty well, the back copy, and even the tag line (Lights, Camera, Teen Angst!) totally misrepresent the series.  They leave out the most important part, and this is something that is known from the very first scene in the very first episode.  The main girl is an alien.  Her ship crash lands, and she nearly kills the main character.  When he wakes up the next day he finds a new girl at the school, the alien who has disguised herself as a normal, small town high school student.  She befriends five fellow students, one of which is the young man she nearly killed.  Together, the six of them decide that they are going to film a movie over the summer, and while filming the movie, the characters grow closer, and learn the importance of being honest about who you are, and how you feel, and how important it is to have people close to you, who care for you, and who will go that extra mile for you.

Waiting in the Summer is a solid, simple sci-fi love story.  While it takes it's time to find it's footing, once it does, it grows into a solid, emotionally involving series with a strong cast of characters, and solid art and music.  The series has a fairly low key tone, keeping the melodrama, and slapstick comedy so common in shows like this to a minimum.  Sure, the cast falls into the normal anime stereotypes, but they are softened, made more realistic, and the show is better for it.

One of the best parts of this series is that you can really understand why all these characters spend time with each other, and why they grow to depend on each other so much.  As much as Waiting in the Summer is a love story, it's also a story about the importance of finding people you can trust, and be open with.  The on going theme in the series is the importance of being honest about your feelings, even when it could hurt.

The art is very strong, with fluid, beautiful animation through out the series.  While there isn't much action in the twelve episodes, when there are big action scenes (and there are a few, especially towards the end), the animation stays top notch.  The character designs are visually appealing, using a soft palette, and character designs that lean closer towards the realistic.  The Japanese cast (there is no dub), do an amazing job with the roles, and by the end of the show, each character feels not only fully developed, but you can see that they have actually grown over the course of the series, and the cast handles this transition beautifully.

I almost gave this series four stars, because the first four episodes (basically the first disc) are very rocky.  The show takes a while to find it's footing, and because of that, the first four episodes feel very uneven.  There are a few bits of fan service thrown in (nothing explicit, but kind of out of place), and a few over the top comedy moments that don't seem to gel well with the over all tone of the show.  Still, once the show settles into it's groove, it develops into a truly heart warming story about young people forming the kind of bonds that help carry you through life.  The final episode is really what made me decide to give the series five stars.  While the conclusion is not definite, it allows the characters to show how they have grown emotionally, and how they have become stronger because of the events that transpired over the summer.

Seriously, this is the type of show that will easily slip under the radar, and I'm disappointed that many people will pass it up because the back copy really just makes it sound like another, silly slice of life show.  Do yourself a favor, and give this show a chance.  Waiting in the Summer is a true hidden gem.",1400198400,,3808,4.457431457431458

Very very beautiful.",1398038400,,326,4.190476190476191
