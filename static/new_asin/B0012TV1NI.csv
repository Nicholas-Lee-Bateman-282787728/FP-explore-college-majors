We had Commie-hunters here in the US in the 1950's, but nothing to this extreme. Brave citizens united and armed themselves against oppression, but got slaughtered by the Army, which is supposed to defend the country and citizens against foreign aggressors, not its own people.  Well-acted and totally-engrossing.  Lee Yo won is one of my favorite Korean actors and I just wish I understood the language, so I wouldn't have to keep reading the English sub-titles and miss the emotions and drama.

I would recommend to anyone who enjoys foreign films that aren't comical or just excuses for jumping into bed. The production is first-rate, sound and picture quality top-notch.  The DVD ran without a hitch.",1364774400,,819,5.135338345864661
