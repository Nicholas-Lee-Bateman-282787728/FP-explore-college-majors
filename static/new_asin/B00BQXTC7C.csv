8572951,5,B00BQXTC7C,"My daughter has the first season movie.  She loved it and I bought this one for her to complete her collection and video watching.
It is very entertaining and she could be watching much worst thing. There are not 11 year old girls trying to look and act like 15 or
16 year old dealing with problems that girls so young do not have any understanding what any of those problems should be yet.  It is about high school girls dealing with wholesome high school issues, their magic abilities.  I recommend the video it is very entertaining.",1399334400,,535,4.494845360824742

8572954,1,B00BQXTC7C,"Disappointed we couldn't watch the movie. Being an Australian customer, the region 2 format of the shipped product means we can't watch it. Why wouldn't an organisation like Amazon have simple checks like this in its system. We've bought several DVD's in the past without checking the Region and each of those was fine.",1374019200,,319,4.925925925925926
