5320396,5,B009DJKKKE,"This series is the unqualified great one about western ranch life and horses. Made in Alberta Canada, the scenery is absolutely spectacular. The quality of the filming, writing and acting is second to none. You seldom see an actress so good with horses as is Amber Marshall. The series is still being filmed and with good reason.

DO NOT BUY the ones that say ""GMC"" at the top
DO NOT BUY the ones labeled as ""canadian version"" with the red band at top of case

both of these releases have sub-par video quality.

Only buy the UK release--they are lighter colored, with a colored band at the BOTTOM of the box saying which season it is.
I was only able to find these on amazon.co.uk. The video quality is very noticeably better. Do yourself a favor and buy the UK versions, released by ""4digitalmedia"".",1495670400,,524,4.4375

5320401,2,B009DJKKKE,"love this series, started watching on amazon prime and now I am hooked so buying each season to catch up. Curious though some of the seasons seem to be missing an episode. When showing the ""previously on heartland"" review at the beginning they show scenes that were not in the last episode on the disc series. Starting here with season 5 that has happened. Like some episodes were skipped from the end of season 4 when Lou had her baby, and now the baby looks to be over a year old and we did not see Ty ask Jack if he could ask Amy to marry him, and they show Amy finding a ring. That is a whole episode not included in the disc series, :(  Seems Ty is not staying in the loft anymore?

Realized now that this season 5 that I received is actually season 6 and not season 5 at all. This is why so much seemed to be missing, will have to return this because I have already purchased season 6 in an actual season 6 package. Not cool, so where is the real season 5?",1487894400,,962,4.057894736842106

5320409,5,B009DJKKKE,"Nope. No sophomore slump nor junior nor senior slump. Not for HEARTLAND, with its habit of big heart and absorbing characters, as its seasons keep on truckin'. Just got done binge-watching Season 5, and I am as hooked as ever. Dang you, O Canada, and your trademark niceness. Amy and Ty's romance still sweeps me along. They are the most core characters of this show, with other relevant participants - like Lou and Grandpa Jack and Tim and Caleb - in fixed orbit around Amy and Ty. I am endlessly drawn by the premise - that of the Bartlett-Fleming family experiencing the joys and rigors of running a ranch for rescue horses and damaged horses and abused horses. Amy, the young horse whisperer (a label she far from fancies), is the one who works the magic. She'd inherited her dearly departed mum's uncanny knack for reading horses. Amy applies psychologically-based therapies in lieu of rough handling, in lieu of force, to gentle the troubled horse, to make it bide, to make it regain its trust in people. Heartland Ranch triumphs or collapses on the strength of Amy's gifts. And, to think, she shouldered this burden when she was only fifteen. That was some years ago.

And then her older sister Lou. Lou is still micro-managing, still a control freak, still jittery, still gets on my nerves sometimes. Season 5 tracks the growth of Lou and Peter's baby, Katie, from wailing infant to, well, eight months or so further on. In Season 4, we found out about Shane. In Season 5, everyone in the show finds out about Shane. And Tim... that old rodeo cowboy who makes sandpaper seem soothing to the skin. Tim still dispenses the tough love, still gives Mallory a run for her money when it comes to saying the wrongest thing at the wrongest time. See Tim connive and scheme and then watch that scheme inevitably backfire on him. Still, it's because he means well that I've a fond spot for him. As for gruff Grandpa Jack, he's still the bedrock. I wish I had a grandpa like Jack Bartlett. Back in the day, I could've used his brand of kind wisdom and timely kick in the pants.

I'm meandering. I won't go too much into plot points. I will say that this show hasn't diminished any in terms of how addictive it is. The actors inhabit their roles like well-worn Wrangler jeans or a broken-in Stetson. It's hard not to think of these characters as real people. It's hard to pick an episode as a favorite because I really like all of them, and, anyway, it's hard to isolate episodes when you're binge-watching (thanks, Netflix!) and so it's like this one continuing saga, one episode folding into next episode. Oh, maybe I'll single out ""The Slippery Slope"" which has Lou and Lisa reuniting Grandpa Jack's old band to celebrate his birthday and in which you can check out Shaun Johnston and Amber Marshall do their own singing. And, every now and then, the show sprinkles in an action episode, and so there's ""Cover Me"" in which Amy and Ty go on a daring raid to recover Tim's stolen race horse. Anyway, to me, HEARTLAND is some kind of perfection. Even the theme song  - Jenn Grant's enchanting ""Dreamer"" - couldn't suit the show better. I'm in love with these people. I'm obsessed with their family drama and conflicts and the challenges that Amy faces with each new troubled horse. Amber Marshall as Amy keeps on shining so luminous, and Graham Wardle as Ty is my dude. HEARTLAND continues to open our eyes concerning the diversity of the equine work force as Amy ends up working with trick horses, liberty horses, show jump horses, chuck wagon horses, police horses, seeing-eye horses... yeah, this show is an animal lover's dream show. I'm only the most casual of animal lovers, but I'm persistently inspired by Amy's kindness and patience and perseverance and by her sheer love of horses.  The song goes, ""And at the break of day you sank into your dream, you dreamer..."" That's Amy and I think that's even Ty.",1475280000,,3909,4.636363636363637

5320421,5,B009DJKKKE,Great family series from pre-teen to Grandpardnts. For those of you torn between the UP (Orange stripe) and the red one this season 5 is season 6 in red stripe. I googled the episodes after getting season 1 and it lists all seasons.,1461283200,,232,4.4186046511627906
5320422,1,B009DJKKKE,"I gave this one star because the company that boxed these pulled a fast one on the viewer.  I have all the seasons on disc - SEASON 4 AND SEASON 5 ARE THE SAME - save your money!!!!!
What they did when they boxed Season 1 for distribution they pulled 9 episodes from Season 2 as viewed on TV.  Season 2 discs are TV Season 2 Episodes 10 through 18 AND TV Season 3 Episode 1 -14.  CONFUSED YET - I WAS!!!  Season 3 discs are TV season 3 Episodes 15 - 18 AND TV Season 4 Episodes 1 - 18.  Now you are caught up to the TV Episodes on Disc, BUT!!!!! instead of dropping out TV Season 4, cause you already have all of it if you bought Seasons 1 through 3, they just did it as a stand alone season 4 but it is Broadcast Season 5.  So if you buy the discs for Season 4 and Season 5 you get the same Episodes.  This was intentional and it ticked me off soooo 1 star.  I have better things to do with my money than buy duplicates.  Amazon did take the second set of Season 4 I bought after I spent 2 hours figuring out what the heck was going on so I now only have 2 sets instead of 3.

Grandpa might be my favorite character - he's a bit ornery, but he's always there for his granddaughters and for Ty, who he has adopted as one of his own.  He tends to be where the life lessons come from.  The Amy and Ty romance story line is really sweet, and Mallory always adds a little humor.

We like the series for the great acting, writing, and beautiful scenery of Alberta. This is truly a great family TV series as the horses relate  well to kids and in most cases there is a lesson to be learned.

Unfortunately, this is produced in Canada on CBC. They have an agreement with Up TV in the US not to release season 6 until it is shown on Up first. Up is on Dish but they are running season 5 now.

Season 7 is being broadcast in Canada at this time.",1383177600,,592,4.042735042735043

I wonder if Ty and Amy are really going to marry. As for Tim, I'm hoping he heads up marrying his son mother. She looks like a good partner and good edition to the family. I would recommend this movie to the family and teens. The stories made be made up, but the lessons in the seasons should be taken serious. Why; because some of the lessons could help you not make the same mistake as they did.",1380931200,,564,4.136363636363637

5320579,5,B009DJKKKE,"I found this series on Hulu and couldn't wait for them to put up Season 5, so I ordered it from Amazon.

This series is about healing horses - and people. It puts family values front and center with people and their stories radiating from that solid core. For the most part, the language is family-friendly as well. It is beautifully written, directed, and acted. The characters become real and you can't help caring about them. There is laughter, tears, misunderstandings, conflict, resolution, and love - just like a real family.

Calgary is showcased in all its seasonal dresses, and the scenery is breathtaking.

And then there are the horses. These magnificent animals are central to many of the plots and you will wish you could hear their whispers as they nicker and nudge, jump, lunge and gallop their way in and out of the limelight.

I highly recommend this series for people and horse lovers of all ages. I now own the entire series, Seasons 1-5 and cannot wait for the release of Season Six. Absolutely love this series and hope it continues for many more seasons.",1380672000,,1076,4.707446808510638

5320592,5,B009DJKKKE,"With the exception of a few minor swear words, it's been so heartwarming to have a series you don't have to stop watching half way through the series. Soon my daughter and grand-daughters, the latter age 8 and 16, were hooked as well. We weren't exactly sure watching the first few episodes, not that anything was wrong, just seemed a tad slow grabbing us. Since it seemed very family orientated and we had next to no choices on TV anymore, I wanted to give it a fair chance, so glad we did. The characters become like part of your own family! We can't wait until season 7 is out next month as it left us with a huge cliffhanger in season 6! The song at the end got stuck in our heads, I found myself humming it soon after hearing it. It is so very pretty, it is called ""Stars"" by Grace Potter & The Nocturnals. Of course it might mean more if you watch the last episode.

5320608,5,B009DJKKKE,"All-in all,my Wife and I love this TV movie series. The stories and actors do a great job of portraying their characters,and over-all theme. The music and scenery is super too.
 The episodes keep you on the edge of your seat most of the time. The themes and situations seem to be pretty traditional and usual for family lives,these days.
  The scenes with the horses are especially good,and fun to watch.
  If I had any criticisms-think it would be the ""roller-coaster""relationships between the main characters/personalities of the series,more specifically between Amy and Ty,Lou and her several romantic flings,and Amy,Lou and their Father-Tim.
 The goings on-with Grandpa Jack,talkative Mallory with the other Cast members is interesting,amusing and sometimes cause for suffering and empathy.
  I imagine-most of the Heartand Series fans are pulling for Amy and Ty to sooner,rather than later become engaged and married-after all of the ""off and on""episodes to finally reach that stage in their relationship,having weathered several assaults by other guys and gals going after Amy and Ty.
 The stormy relationship between Ashley and her Mother is pretty funny-aaah-""daughter like Mother.""
  Jack(Grandpa) should get all kinds of awards for his patience(sometimes),continuous assault by/from almost everyone else in the cast. In ""real time"",I don't think any person could reasonably withstand ""all""that he was afflicted with,and endured throughout the Series.
  We are wondering what his fate will be after viewing the last episode(18) of the  6th Season(I think? ),where he fell off his horse and was lying in the Snow at night?
  Overall-as said -my Wife and I really have enjoyed Heartland-are addicted to it-and are very much looking forward to seeing the next Season's Series and episodes.",1375056000,,1795,5.402877697841727

5320623,5,B009DJKKKE,"I gave this 5 stars because this is the best program I've seen in quite awhile and it showed up quickly and in excellent condition.

Delivery & Quality: The product arrived quickly and was packaged well. It is a cardstock box with an opening at one end for thin, plastic dvd holders to insert in and the pictures are of good quality.

The Show: I started watching this show on Netflix and was so hooked that when they cut off mid 3rd season (one thing I hate about Netflix), I decided to just get all the DVDs so that I could continue to enjoy this program. It's about a teenage girl whose mother died and is being reared by her grandfather on a horse ranch with her sister and other characters. Her job is working with the horses as she has a special gift and understanding for them. There are many characters in the show that you'll get used to and know who they are (although new characters get introduced, there is none of this constant changing of characters like I've seen in some programs). This show is also full of adventure, love of family, and respectfulness as well as romances and life challenges. All-in-all an excellent show.
I just wish Amazon had season 6 out so I could buy it, too, but I'll be watching for it.",1371859200,,1229,4.385964912280702
