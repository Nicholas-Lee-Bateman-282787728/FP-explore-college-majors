8176958,5,B000NDFFN6,An excellent presentation of the Canadian role in World War I.  I would recommend this for anyone with an interest in the subject.  Only wish I had had this when I taught this material - excellent for classroom presentations as it is divided into manageable segments.,1357948800,,267,4.782608695652174
8176959,4,B000NDFFN6,"This DVD series while relatively cheaply produced (the format is simply that of Christie taking the viewer and sometimes a descendant of First World War combatant to WWI battlefields associated with the Canadian Expeditionary Force). There are no re-enactments or dramatizations. The film is as close to being there as can be imagined and in some ways it's better. Even an informed tourist to these sites, as I have been, would miss the kind of things that Christie picks up, literally finding shell casings, and evidence of fortifications as he walks through the sites. There is some very compelling historical footage and some excellent readings of eye witness accounts, notably those of Will Bird who wrote the Canadian WWI classic, ""Ghosts Have Warm Hands"" and Canon Scott, whose account of finding the body of his son, unrecognizable in the mud except for his college ring, has to be one of the most poignant stories of that terrible war. Christie, a former high school teacher, and publisher on Canadian military history, is an authority on the First World War and has made it his mission to publicize these forgotten stories. The only reason I would withhold a 5th star is that I would have liked to have seen more money put into the production. But in terms of content and the fact that there is nothing like it, if you have interest in the area, it's well worth the price.",1295654400,,1381,4.7824267782426775
