8158427,5,B000KNVENO,"I always thought LA was a city defined by traffic, racism, commercialism, and the vanity of Hollywood until I saw THE NEW LOS ANGELES. After seeing the film and becoming more immersed in Los Angeles politics myself, I realized that there is so much more to LA. LA is, believe it or not, a progressive city and THE NEW LOS ANGELES shows this hidden reality with clarity and passion. From the 20 year tenure of the first African American Mayor Tom Bradley to the election of our current Latino Mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa; from the birth of the United Farm Workers Movement under Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta to the rise of the labor movement led by Miguel Contreras--this film shows LA unlike you've ever seen it before.

I recommend it for anyone with a progressive vision for the country. The film deals with issues like immigration, living wage, economic justice and racial tension, which are shaping policy and discussion throughout the country. Los Angeles has consistently been a leader on many of these fronts, and how LA has handled key challenges and events in its recent history can surely serve as a model for communities across the country.",1165276800,3,1154,4.828282828282828
