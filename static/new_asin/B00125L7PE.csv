8243936,5,B00125L7PE,This movie is the ultimate sequel.  It's the ultimate sequel.  Nerds are always discriminated against and watching them take control is a breath of fresh air  Nerd equality is a important issue that is never addressed and this movie attacks it with a certain poignancy that I've never seen.  The performances are Oscar worthy and this is an important movie every American should see.  It moved me to tears!,1437523200,3,406,4.826086956521739
