2349291,1,B000A1IOMU,"This script would have been better served as an ""Outer Limits"" episode.  Than perhaps it would have had better pacing and appeal, as it is it was boring and even annoying in places.  The opening scene, for example, would it have been so much for our protagonist to have a scene to introduce the main characters in the beginning rather than having it that he arrives at the space base with no greeting and and has to walk down a dark narrow hallway with a flickering fluorescent light to a dark shabby room alone. The film seemed to strive too hard for an ""noir"" feel, or perhaps it was trying to be deep.  I would have recommended that the makers have watched Sean Connery in the movie ""Outland"" made in 1981 to get some idea of how to set up a tone.",1331078400,2,750,4.267605633802817
2349292,5,B000A1IOMU,"This will be one of the best movies you'll ever buy for ten bucks! Forget about the bang for the the buck that it took to generate this story. Nolan, Mercer and Karibalis soak so far into these characters in a truly believable script of human tolerance and balance of reality versus intent. This story could have been told from the perspective of Midtown Manhattan. But on the moon Triton the story of people reflecting on their lives decisions is very well portrayed and shows the desolate place our minds take us sometimes. The pacing and flow of this unraveling study along with well placed and timed visual effects all funnel into a very respectable first full length offering from Mr. Krawlzig.

I kept hoping someone would explain the significance of the ""no pattern"" storms - why mention it if it had no significance? I wondered about the mention of angels. It had one interesting concept but never did much with it. It appeared the government investigator needed forgiveness for something he did on his last assignment, and it appeared he got it, but that's a stretch.

All the way through I kept wondering what happened to the ship that dropped off the investigator. Did it abandon him and fly away?

2349302,1,B000A1IOMU,"I rarely review movies, since they are already reviewed and are very subjective.  But this film required a review.  Or rather a warning.  It is unquestionably the most vacuous, boring, total waste of time films ever made.  If you must, I suggest first getting a small cup of water, place it before you and stare at it until it boils.  Your mind will be ever so much more fulfilled than by watching this movie.  The only possible good that could come from this is, if sitting in the lotus position while watching, and concentrating deeply, your may achieve sansara.  Your mind will be that vacant.

Update:  The last comment does not work.  But I can achieve sansara by thinking about thinking about this movie.

2349320,1,B000A1IOMU,"If soap operas are your thing then find old tapes of daytime soap operas and watch them.  If you want a soap opera with some bad scifi cliche contrivances mixed in, this is your series.  The worst part of this show is it has a strong start; I can almost guarantee you'll enjoy the first episode and want to know what happens next.  However, the predicable but good ending you expect to a movie never happens, and in episode 2 and 3 you end up with a plot that opens cliffhanger after cliffhanger for no apparent purpose at all other than a metaphorical shout out by the producer, saying ""Please, please renew me so you can see what happens next"".  Very unsatisfying non-ending (again cliffhanger after cliffhanger), and you end up hating the characters you liked at the beginning as they do more morally questionable and just plain stupid things.

Bottom line (sorry for being vague, hard to give more info without a spoiler). It's got a plot for a 2 hour movie or 30 page short story which would be good; but the writers are trying to stretch it out to a 50 episode run on the SCIFI channel.  Give it a miss.",1421884800,,1109,4.411764705882353

The dialogue through most of the movie consists of Agent Hayes asking 1 sentence questions and getting 1 or 2 word answers from the only 2 other actors.

2349331,1,B000A1IOMU,"This movie broke a new record for me; it is officially the worst movie I have ever watched in my 24 years on planet Earth. Normally I don't mind budget, middle-grade sci fi movies. Some actually have decent camera work, a decent soundtrack, or even a decent storyline. Let's face it, not every idea for a movie can get a $20 million budget, but with a little creativity and good camera work, a movie can still work out. I mean movies made in the 50's didn't have the CGI at hand today and they still pulled things off. Not Ascension. When I first heard of a movie that took place on Saturn's moon, I thought it sounded really cool, and if the story or characters were compelling enough then I could overlook any cheap CGI this movie possibly would have. That wasn't the case with this movie.

The acting is stale, as you can see it in the actors faces that the script and dialog are awful. The set design is atrocious. For being a moon base some fifty years in the future, this place sure doesn't look like it. There is no space-age looking technology anywhere, it's like they didn't even attempt to make it look like so. The whole movie looks like it was filmed in some guys basement with some cardboard cutouts for walls. The actors/actresses aren't even decent looking... I mean at least in other budget movies they throw in a cute actress or something to keep your interested. This movie had none of that.

Even the food in this movie is awful. At one point the lead character eats what looks like a combination of vomit, feces, and urine mixed together. Maybe the writers were trying to tell us something... like that this movie is basically on the same level of vomit, feces, and urine mixed together. This is in year 2050 or something, why are they eating ****? Don't you think they would have resourceful ways to create food when on an interplanetary mission? Maybe I'm picking at one thing here, but this is one of many minor problems with this movie, why it doesn't work, and why it doesn't make sense.

This movie is a joke. I can't wrap my head around why it was even made. Everything about it is just awful. 1/5, I would give this movie a lower score if I could. There is nothing redeeming about it at all. This is honestly the worst movie I have ever watched, and I am petty forgiving even if a movie is budget or not. Do yourself a favor and watch a movie that's actually decent. There are plenty of other gems out there even in the budget department. This movie is not worth the trouble. It is a pile of crap from beginning to end.",1394236800,3,2547,4.3691983122362865

Whatever they were trying to do with this could have been condensed in a 15 minute short.  Do not waste your time with this.  Scenes that have nothing to do with the plot go on and on.

There's a crystal that seems to hold the clue to whatever happened, happening, or will happen.

Good acting, good story, well done considering the obviously modest budget but there is simply no getting around the incredibly poor (non)ending. Did they run out of film stock? If shot on video did they screw up and purchase a too short video cartridge when it came time to shoot the movie? Something went wrong that is for sure. The ending pretty much crapped on the rest of the movie. Could have been a true gem but those hopes got dashed with the premature rolling of the credits.
Too bad and truly disappointing. Should throw in an expletive or two but it is too hot to get all worked up right now.

In fact, I'm convinced this is what foreign intelligence services show you when they want you to talk. No need to waterboard - this is the newest torture device. You in a locked room and this astounding crap playing non-stop. Oh, trust me, you'll break.

Grotesque mockery of a film - forget SciFi - I'm talking just the basic framework of any film period.

I have zero doubt that the writer/director of this steaming stinkpile is the author of the first three reviews which slop heaping amounts of false praise onto this shyte.
