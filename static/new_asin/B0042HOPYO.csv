8413708,5,B0042HOPYO,"This is not the average 'Berlitz type' archaeological historical travel guide. Miles knows his subject and makes many penetrating observations.

This does not preclude the odd silly statement (or is that PC, or are they the same?) such as in his opening preamble: ""It is not the story of ancient worlds long past, it's of us, then"". Unlikely. One doubts that those presently squatting around the base of the pyramids in Egypt are the same people that built it, anymore than the contemporary immigrants to France would in the future be considered the builders of the Eiffel Tower, Versailles and so on.

Leaving aside these quibbles, this series is more than worth watching (many times over).Excellent photography, superb locations (that you will be hard-pressed to find even in the best archaeology books), top-quality std DVD transfer and Miles's incisive and crisply crafted commentary.",1511654400,,888,5.2027972027972025
8413709,2,B0042HOPYO,"The series deserves 4 stars, but 2 stars for the blu-ray disc.

I like this series, but I had to get the European format DVD from Amazon.co.uk to watch it. On my player the blu-ray would load and display menus and still images, but not moving pictures

I don't know what the problem was, but I do know that my international DVD player can read European format PAL discs, and my Panasonic DMP-BD35 (firmware vers 2.4) blu-ray player's manual specifically says that it won't play PAL discs.

The blu-ray disk is a region-free disc produced in Britain: the same one sold in England, produced by the regular BBC, and not re-distributed in the US by BBC America (which makes many fine blu-rays; I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Madagascar-Blu-ray/dp/B004PHSTZ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Madagascar [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonders-of-the-Solar-System-Blu-ray/dp/B003NF97O4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonders of the Solar System [Blu-ray</a>]).

The only DVD of 'Ancient Worlds' available as of 1 January 2012 is region-coded for Europe.",1326240000,3,1154,6.522875816993464
8413710,2,B0042HOPYO,"I thought I was going to like this. It is presented by Richard Miles, who is definitely a full-fledged professional historian, not one of the ""pseudo-historians"" who seem to proliferate of late. He wrote the excellent recent book on Carthage:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carthage-Must-Be-Destroyed-The-Rise-and-Fall-of-an-Ancient-Civilization/dp/0670022667/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carthage Must Be Destroyed: The Rise and Fall of an Ancient Civilization</a>&nbsp;- Well worth a read!

So why is this series strangely unfocused, meandering, and ultimately profoundly unsatisfying? Why does the speaker seem to lack any sort of coherent overall vision, jumping from one disconnected idea to the next, so you may often realize you've completely lost track of whatever he's supposed to be saying? Why is the material presented so uneven in quality and accuracy considering it is supposed to be coming from a professional historian?

Also, why does Mr. Miles feel compelled to deliver his lines in such an abrasive, sometimes even seemingly hostile way? Even beyond the other obnoxious elements this shares with so many other modern documentaries, Mr. Miles' bizzare style of delivery made the show seem sort of surreal after a while. I wondered if the filmmakers had goaded him into adopting some sort of ""hard-bitten passionate historian"" persona to bring a bit of Reality TV goodness to the mix. But what I often seemed to see in his eyes was frustration and disgust.

Having read his Carthage book I can't believe a historian of Mr. Miles' caliber could be involved in such a substandard presentation if he had had any real control of the material. My impression is that he was roped in to lend credibility to a project that originated from other sources. With all the emphasis on the history of trade and the interconnectedness of the ancient world you might almost at times feel you were watching some sort of sneaky globalist propaganda. In any case it seems sketchy as history.

If you don't know much about the ancient world and are looking for a very basic introduction, this may be a reasonable choice for you. Those who have done much reading in the subject already will probably find it disappointing or even offensive.",1314403200,5,2277,5.423728813559322
