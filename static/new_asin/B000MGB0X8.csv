In Cardiac Arrest most patients with one actually die, and quickly. The small cast and, apparently, cheap production limit the appeal but I enjoy it.",1477008000,,322,4.767857142857143
8168531,5,B000MGB0X8,"This is the most accurate account of a new doctor's first year. In my day the nurses weren't quite as lazy, but the hours were much worse.
Helen Baxendaie is superb as are the rest of the cast. Medically and emotionally on target.",1388620800,,230,4.372093023255814
8168532,1,B000MGB0X8,"...went down from there. This series is best described as annoying.
Another good descriptor is boring and irritating.
Unless you have a favored neice acting in thie pile it is
best given a pass. You will not miss much.",1363046400,,218,4.615384615384615
8168533,5,B000MGB0X8,"I have watched the earlier episodes before many years ago. I loved it then and I thought I would get it for Christmas. There are many (too many, it seems) medical dramas back in the 90's. In the UK, we have 'Casualty', 'Holby City'; from the US, we have 'ER', 'Grey's Anatomy'...etc. But amongst all of them, I think 'Cardiac Arrest' portrays what is going on in our National Health Service in the UK, and the people in it, most accurately. The way the housemen are trained, the crazy hours, the ocassional useless doctors, and how the nurses will always be the way they are ^_^, why divorce and suicide are so commonplace in this particular profession....just so brilliant and so real. Mind you, some hospitals in the UK may have a easier life than others; and things are changing slowly, it seems.

The only problem (because it is so real) about this TV series (and I think this is why it wasn't a big hit back then) is there are a lot of medical jargons. If you have never studied medicine or anything medical-related related, you will have a hard time following it. The other medical dramas are successful because they often have a lot of 'human relationships' thrown into the mix. Cardiac Arrest focusses more on what the 'life' is like in the NHS rather than the 'people' in the NHS per se, even though the storyline is about the 4 to 5 main characters, namely Andrew, Claire, Raj, and James.

If anyone is interested in a life of medicine in the UK, they should watch this. The chances are they may change their mind afterwards.",1357171200,,1535,4.517985611510792
