1860385,5,B00008RV0F,"I'm glad someone finally started releasing on dvd the few Roy Rogers films that were made in TruColor, in their original uncut form. Hats off to Lions Gate Home Entertainment! But please don't stop with this one. There are at least 10 more, out of the original twenty or so films that were originally made in TruColor, that there are color prints for. Some how the color prints for the rest were lost. This is really sad. However, I recently found out about one that has recently been released entitled SUNSET IN THE WEST, and although it says it is in B&W, it really is in color. I bought a vhs copy and was thrilled. I guess it was also released on dvd, but no dvd copys seem to be

available at present. Keep up the good work Lions Gate!",1127865600,14,740,4.285714285714286
1860386,5,B00008RV0F,"Color and Quality of this DVD is Excellent.  Bells of Coronado

is my Grandkids favorite ""Roy"" movie. They want to watch this one over and over.  It's more popular than Shrek at my house.",1093824000,13,187,4.4411764705882355
1860387,5,B00008RV0F,"This is an absolutely gorgeous Trucolor uncut version of Bells of Coronado.  It is far superior to the 1990's VHS version released by Republic Home Video.  Although I would not rate this movie as one of Roy's best, it is still a good one. The quality of this DVD makes it a must for collectors of Roy's films. Lionsgate/Fox is to be commended for the great job they did.  Hopefully they will do more of Roy's Trucolor films on DVD (Republic Home Video had marketed 9 Trucolor titles on VHS).",1084492800,24,491,4.433333333333334
1860409,5,B00008RV0F,I may not be the best perso to review these movies as I am almost a rabid Roy Rogers fan. He was my hero as a young boy and I have a lot of pictures of him and autographed items so you see I am a bit prejudiced. But these movies are good escapist fun.,1395360000,,251,3.581818181818182
1860410,5,B00008RV0F,"this to was a gift. the person loves the movie. we had been looking for the movie for a long time, and looked a amazon.",1388534400,,119,3.8
1860411,3,B00008RV0F,"Please note that this review is in regards to the Good Times Video DVD realease of ""Bells of Coronado"". Prior to this, I'd never seen a film shot using Republic's Trucolor process. And after, I'm not entirely sure I want to see another. I'm not sure what this ""remaster"" is in comparison to... but I don't find the picture to be ""remastered"" My complaints with this release aren't with the colorization process used, even though it's primitive looking when compared to Technicolor. My primary issue is the overall softness of the image. I'm not entirely sure if it's a result of Trucolor, but the picture is never what you'd call sharp, it always has a muddy ""shot at twilight"" or the old ""day for night filtered"" appearance, even when the scene is in bright daylight. The sound quality is quite good, the dialogue is nice and clear, however the lone song in the film gets a bit muffled sounding. Recapping, I'm not sure if my picture quality complaints are down to the Trucolor process, or a bad master, but I'd hesitate to agree that this film has been remastered.

As for the film itself, I've seen better Roy Rogers films, and I've seen worse. There was only one song in the film. I found the lack of song welcome, as I'm not a fan of that element of Roy Rogers/Dale Evans films, but some will find that a detractor. The story was rushed feeling, but one can only put that down to a slightly more than an hour run time, only so much story/character development can occur. It IS uncut! Which is a big plus for the viewer, we're not presented with lines and actions which have no context in light of cut scenes and dialogue!

Overall, I'm not pleased with this release, but I'm (sometimes overly) picky when it comes to picture and audio quality. Your experience may vary.",1373241600,,1774,4.540625
1860412,5,B00008RV0F,roy rogers dvd bells of coronado is a 5 star movie it is restored the true color clear and it is uncut 67 min.run time i hope they bring out more roy rogers movies restored in true color and uncut bring out all of his true color movies the far frontier and under california stars in true color and uncut iam sure roy rogers fans agree with me.,1313020800,,343,4.0588235294117645
1860413,5,B00008RV0F,This is a very good release from Lions Gate of this Roy Rogers film.  It looks great and is uncut with only minor imperfections.  I'm very pleased to see a good quality uncut print of a Rogers film.  There just aren't enough of them in decent shape.,1300579200,3,249,4.25531914893617
1860414,5,B00008RV0F,"This film is somewhat impressive. The restoration process is first class. Production values of the original film  were well above average. Another factor; it is in full length form. All Roy Roger's Trucolor films deserve this care. It is my understanding that possibility is remote because of the lack of care down through the years of these films. They were butchered down in some cases to as little as 51 minutes or so for their early TV showings,some were simply not preserved in their color form at all,ownership changed more often than that of the Chrysler Corporation and who knows what else. In other words finding all of the basic ingredients to work with is a challenge.

One might think that I was one of Roy's biggest fans. Not so. Back in the day Hopalong Cassidy, Gene Autry, Johnny Mack Brown, Ken Maynard etc.were much preferred over Roy. Nevertheless an appreciation has evolved over time. Roy's family values and clean cut image are certainly scarce in today's world. He also looked the part of a cowboy hero: slim/ trim and athletic looking no matter what age he became. That is not the case with the group above save William (Hopalong Cassidy) Boyd. I forgot to mention John Wayne. He too is in that group with the middle age spread. Another selling point of Roy Rogers is Dale Evans. She was able to gain the attention of any cowboy or cowboy fan. And of course there is Trigger, Pat Brady and most importantly Gabby Hayes.

If you want to feel young again this film is a good place to start that journey.",1272153600,6,1525,4.619926199261992
1860415,5,B00008RV0F,"I really enjoyed the movie, but there are couple of scenes that might not be suitable for younger kids.",1248739200,,103,4.473684210526316
1860416,5,B00008RV0F,"This is one of the best Roy Rogers movies because dale
Evan is almost a Gracie Allen in this one. It's great and
the DVD is sound in every way.",1242172800,3,143,3.8
1860417,5,B00008RV0F,"This is a good and as far as I know an uncut color version of the Roy Rogers movie. The plot is a thinly veiled Roy Rogers vs the commies who are out to steal Uranium ore, lets just forget that you need tons of the raw stuff to refine into anything useful for bombs or power generation but that someone wants it and is willing to steal to get it. Well boys and girls guess who foils the plot? Guess who gets away with it? No doubting here but that's not the point. You don't watch a Roy Rogers film to wonder who the hero is. Anyway it's a great slice of Americana and a fun rainy day movie. And it isn't one of those hacked up copies that Reel Enterprises releases.",1237939200,2,666,4.015037593984962
