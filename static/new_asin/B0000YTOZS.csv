1962760,4,B0000YTOZS,"Interesting piece of the Book of the Dead. In the second part there is an animation of the process of dead...., is that the best they can do with the technology of nowadays? I ask myself. Besides that is quite an enjoyable film. I recommend to read ""The tibetan book of the dead"" by Evans-Wentz, my opinion is that is a best translation that the one from Thurman, or Fremantle. If you are really want to learn about Tibetan Buddhism, especially from the Kargyutpa Lineage read all the books from Evans-Wentz, including: ""The Tibetan book of the great liberation"", ""Tibetan Yoga and Secret Yoga"" and ""The Great Yogi Milarepa"".",1129161600,15,625,4.743119266055046

1962762,4,B0000YTOZS,"This DVD is a must see for every Buddhist.  The Tibetan Book of the Dead was not easily available to lay persons and even if available, the language was very difficult to understand.  This DVD with very clear translation in English is a boon to many Buddhist. I make sure my elderly parents and relatives watch and understand the contents/message in this film.

However, I feel that ""Part 2: The Great Liberation"" can be little longer with more animation and more details of the journey to the next life. I hope there will be part II of this DVD.

I recommend every person to see this film to understand the book better and be well prepared for the journey that we all will have to take one day.",1124668800,16,695,4.40625

1962764,5,B0000YTOZS,I have had the videos of this for several years and have used them in some of the classes I have taught.

1962779,4,B0000YTOZS,"The Tibetan Book Of The Dead has a mysterious, even ominous sound to it conjuring up thoughts of mystical contact with dead spirits in some sort of secret way. The Canadian Film Board, two-part documentary film, The Tibetan Book Of The Dead  A Way Of Life  The Great Liberation, narrated by Leonard Cohen explores the actuality behind the mythical title. The Dali Lama makes a brief appearance in the film to help explain the connection to Buddhist thought. The realities of death cannot be disputed or avoided. The Tibetan Book Of The Dead is an ancient archive of guidance and strength. It remains a source of wisdom and teaching beginning with the spiritual cultures of the Himalayas.

1962827,3,B0000YTOZS,"This video although is very interesting and is about an important topic, in my opinion it could be better done. When you make a video is not only about showing images. Music is one element that should be in harmony with that of what is going on. The music of this video is very disturbing and out of its context. A solo Soprano sax with an electric drum set playing ay notes here and there makes this video to be completely not so pleasant to see. Ok you may say that the content and essence is the most important... then if that is the case, one should be mindful of how to reach the senses of the audience who ultimate is probably a wide secular one, and maybe first to approach to this topic. So the way to approach must be in all senses good....",1394928000,,749,4.172413793103448

1962830,4,B0000YTOZS,This is a very interesting book for someone trying to get down to the nitty gritty of death and to see how others view death.  In the western world we are taught what our parents were taught not that it is the truth about death and dying.  American is a melting pot of cultures that's why we have so many religions.  I wanted to know how others view the process.  As a retired RN that worked ICU I started to disbelieve what I was taught.  From having so many patients that were clinically dead to come back and tell me where they were and what they saw I had to start my own spiritual journey and this book helped me look back to the beginning.,1368230400,5,645,4.128

1962847,5,B0000YTOZS,"Absolutely one of the best insights into the bardo (transitional states) of death and becoming. This documentary has two parts which deal with the teachings of the Tibetan Book of the Dead, as well as an additional feature. Set in the Tibetan area of northern India, each of the first two films follows Tibetan monks and yogis as they lead the deceased through the bardo of death. The film shows in rich detail the life of the people in this region, the Tibetan Buddhist practices and ongoing mentoring of new monastics, as well as giving an in depth look at the understanding of death as presented in the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Leonard Cohen narrates this documentary and the the cinematography is very good. The final short piece on this dvd shows the monastics at Gampo Abbey in Canada practicing a very Buddhist form of generosity. This is a dvd to watch many times. It is an excellent production in every way, although the coming attractions previews at the beginning of the dvd are a bit annoying. However, fast forward to the actual documentaries and enter into a world few of us get to experience.",1343433600,,1108,4.658163265306122
1962848,2,B0000YTOZS,"I have tried watching this DVD however the disc itself has technical problems.  When you put the disc in it makes a loud whirring sound and takes a while to start.  Once it starts it freezes up often.  I have looked into returning the DVD, which I can do, however they will not send me a new one.

1962849,5,B0000YTOZS,I PURCHASED THE TIBETAN BOOK OF THE DEAD DVD FROM AMAZON. I HAD SEEN THIS VERY INFORMATIVE AND TOUCHING STORY NARRATED BY LEONARD COHEN QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO ON TV. I WAS VERY PLEASED WHEN I FOUND IT WAS AVAILABLE NOW AT AMAZON. PART 1 A WAY OF LIFE IS ABOUT THE TIBETAN BOOK OF THE DEAD WHICH STILL REMAINS AN ESSENTIAL TEACHING ORIGINATING IN THE SPIRITUAL CULTURES OF THE HIMALAYAS.  PART 2 THE GREAT LIBERATION FOLLOWS AN OLD LAMA AND HIS NOVICE MONK AS THEY GUIDE A HIMALAYAN VILLAGER INTO THE AFTERLIFE WITH READINGS FROM THE TIBETAN BOOK OF THE DEAD WHICH IS A VERY INFORMATIVE INSIGHT INTO A VERY OLD CULTURE. VERY WELL DONE AND ACCENTUATED WITH THE BEAUTIFUL VOICE OF LEONARD COHEN.,1330041600,3,691,4.484126984126984
1962850,5,B0000YTOZS,"Leonard Cohen's voice is amazingly well-suited to narrate this. Somehow it adds a deep other worldliness to the material. Although I had studied Buddhism academically, I can honestly say that this DVD is what brought it to me on a much more emotional level.  My understanding of the Bardo of Becoming has been greatly shaped by this DVD and I highly recommend it to anyone who is curious to learn more.  It is suitable for a beginner, with only a limited knowledge of Buddhism.",1315267200,4,477,4.666666666666667
1962851,4,B0000YTOZS,This documentary explains to the lay person what the Tibetan Book of the Dead is about and how it is used. It also shows (I am sure) a rarely seen Tibetan death ritual and explains what happens when someone dies - from a Buddhist point of view. Very interesting and wonderfully filmed.,1306800000,4,285,4.5
1962852,5,B0000YTOZS,"This film gives one of the clearest explanations of the dying process according to classical Buddhist teachings, particularly as it is practiced in the Tibetan culture.  The clear presentation brings to life what can easily be an overly abstract theoretical knowledge of the transition process.  Very highly recommended for anyone who wants to understand the Buddhist teachings on death and dying.",1282953600,37,397,5.491803278688525
1962853,5,B0000YTOZS,"Leonard Cohen is the perfect narrator for this documentary, imparting his respect for the Tibetan ritual with his rich, soulful voice. The combination of the spectacular location, the amazing cinematography, and Cohen makes this film one that is worth owning.",1269043200,28,259,5.5
1962854,4,B0000YTOZS,"This DVD is broken up into 2 parts one entitled ""A Way of Life"" and the other ""The Great Liberation"" each about 45 minutes in length.

These episodes take a look into the life of the villages amongst the Himalayas where these people live Buddhism daily (not just practice it).  There are 2 interesting story lines (one in each part) depicted of the rituals involved when a loved one passes.  It shows how the Lama and his students perform the reading and ritual of sacred text to help the passed move into a better transition for re-birth.

The second part is a little more of a telling of story rather than documentary.  The narration throughout is a bit hypnotic and will provide a sense of a waking meditation as you listen and watch the information provided.

I have seen some of these filmed excerpts in other documentaries, however this was the first to translate into English when the Lama was speaking in front of the dead and their family and friends. This representation of the Book of the Dead is both informative with detail and entertaining to watch.

Anyone studying concepts of death, rebirth and/or the metaphysical will enjoy the information and presentation in this DVD. Students of metaphysics will also notice similarities between the Tibetan teachings of the continuation of life and other religious and philosophical teachings. A good one for the home collection. 4 stars.

1962856,5,B0000YTOZS,"This is a 2009 re-release of a earlier 2004 DVD version which has been out of print for way too long. Originally available in two parts on two VHS tapes in 1994, it was a great relief to see them finally transfered to DVD.

With a total duration of 90 minutes, the first half (titled ""A Way Of Life"") includes an interview with the Dalai Lama and explores the history and use of the text of the Bardo Thtrl. Anyone sincerely interested in  the liturgies and rites of the Tibetan Book Of The Dead will find this first half of the documentary, shot over four months, simply fascinating. The reality behind the veil of mystery surrounding this sacred text is eloquently revealed.

The second half, titled ""The Great Liberation,"" documents a more intimate look inside the book as it takes the viewer inside the home of a deceased man as a Lama and a younger monk perform the Buddhist ritual, rarely seen in practice. Take note that this includes footage of a deceased person - it is not gross or morbid. But in case you have any issues with this, you should at least be made aware. This actual documentation is interwoven with the thoroughly engaging animation by Ishu Patel.

For purist, this documentary lacks some production values we have come to expect in today's digital world, but that is no excuse to dismiss this entirely watchable film with it's profound insights. In a way, this film progresses along in a meditative sort of way. I know of no other documentary that explores the Tibetan Book Of The Dead with this degree of integrity, intelligence and respect. Adding to this the excellent narration by Leonard Cohen, makes this DVD a must in any library of important Buddhist films.

Steve Clorefein of Parabola Magazine writes of this film: ""An extraordinary window into traditional Buddhist practices of devotion and compassion"" - and I could not agree more.",1239408000,132,1868,4.735384615384615
1962857,5,B0000YTOZS,"For years, I've been studying books on the afterlife, and this video has the best information. I'm impressed by the accuracy of the Buddhist teachings. This may be because Tibet is the *highest* region in the world with an average elevation of 16,000FT =)

According to the NDE Research Foundation, 15+ million people today have experienced NDEs and yet Buddhism described this 1,000+ years ago, long before any advanced medication or worldwide communication was available.

Ketamine was not invented until the 1960s, and this is the #1 reason why Atheists today like David Mills and Marshall Brain deny the reality of an afterlife. How could Ketamine be responsible for NDEs that occurred 1,000s of years ago? The afterlife was described by ancient Egyptians, Buddhists and famous Philosophers (Plato, Socrates).

This video explains general concepts and applies them in a very concrete way to death in two Indian villages.

It gives a great account of how Buddhists deal with grief in these two different situations.  It also interviews an ancient Buddhist monk about what he desires for the rest of his life, and an investigation of a young boy who might be the reincarnation of a great spiritual figure, and why people think the boy may be the man.  The narration by Leonard Cohen is stunning: I couldn't imagine a more appropriate voice and style.  The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is the relatively mediocre production values, but considering the remote location and the arduous environment, it's not surprising.",1134086400,59,799,4.726618705035971
