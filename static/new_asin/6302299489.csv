457179,5,6302299489,"I recorded this tape and wore it out..... This film gives hope to all those people who were laughed at or looked over. I love the bottom line of the film:
  #1: People who are over looked will not be in the end.
  #2: If people are your true friend, when the name brand clothes come off  and your driving a Chevette they'll still be there!
  GREAT FILM THAT  GETS THE POINT ACROSS AND GIVES HOPE TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE ONES  LAUGHING NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!",921024000,,458,4.232558139534884

457181,5,6302299489,"If you remember being looked over in high school, then this movie is the best thing since sliced bread.  Robin Lively is so funny, and who could forget the rap scene, or the frog prince.  I recommend this movie to anyone  who likes fairy tales.  And trust me you can find this movie in English out  there!!",919555200,,306,4.298245614035087
457182,5,6302299489,"I watched this as a teen and I fell in love with it. It has unique elements, eg. Louise Miller's best friend daring her love interest to ""top that"" in a rap lip sync. I love Robyn Lively's  transformation in this film. It was very similar to Sandra Bullock's in  ""Love Potion #9""; from tripping dorky nerd to sophisticated glam  queen. I give it 5 stars for the valuable morals it presents and its  creative presentation of those morals; Louise Miller's bravery to be  herself regardless of what powers she has. This is the type of film that I  believe should be on network television as the movie special for children  on Saturdays. I wish I could purchase it without the spanish subtitles. But  I'll probably purchase it anyway. When you love a film, you love a film.",917568000,3,769,4.521739130434782

One part of the movie may be a bit mature for younger audiences, but otherwise it is cute.  Although the character tries to use witchcraft (nothing dark here) to get her guy, in the end she depends on herself.  Good message at the end.",1515715200,,372,4.333333333333333

457290,5,6302299489,"This movie is serious nostalgia. As a kid growing up in the '90s, this movie used to air all the time on the Disney Channel. I mean, ALL THE TIME. I had it recorded on VHS and of course, I loved it. (I was really into magic and witches! Still am!) I'm happy I was able to get my hands on a copy via DVD, and I may eventually upgrade it to a Blu-Ray because of the special features. I haven't even watched it yet, but I know it'll be cheesy as heck, and that's what I love about it.

Little known fact: Dick Sargent, who replaced Dick York as Darren in the series ""Bewitched"" plays Louise's Dad. I never knew that until recently!",1503100800,,628,4.064516129032258

457296,1,6302299489,"Even the stunt casting of Dick Sargent (Darrin Stephens #2 from BEWITCHED) cant save this mess of a movie from Dullsville. Clich script, cardboard characters, cheesy musical numbers/background music (ugh, which reminded me why I always hated the late 80s as far as pop culture goes) all make for an excruciating viewing experience. I remember constantly seeing this listed in TV Guide with a One-Star rating back in the day and that should have been a red flag. Even the current interviews on the BluRay are tedious as the star reiterates over and over how great it feels when fans gush about what this movie means to them. Must only appeal to females who were tweens in 1989 and are nostalgic for acid wash, crimped hair, tutu skirts and really bad New Jack Swing. AVOID!",1497312000,,772,4.725925925925926

457332,4,6302299489,I'm only a mild fan of T.Witch but I love 80's nostalgia so I was interested in the bonus material. If your a fan of the movie you should enjoy this special edition. Included are very lengthy interviews with cast members that run about 20 something minutes each.  They even talk to the guys who wrote the rap songs in the film.  All the main cast are here and they give their thoughts on the movie as well as their careers and other projects they did.  So in total all these segments together run well over the hour mark so they're not short changing the buyer with quick 2 minute interviews.  It's a lot of happy talk and fond memories that can seem long-winded at times but I found myself enjoying it more than I thought I would. There's also a commentary and I don't see why it won't be a good listen with the entire cast on the track.,1490659200,6,838,4.21875

457697,5,6302299489,"Nick Krassowski Reviews:

The movie ""Teen Witch"" (1989). It came out the year I was born. If my life is anything close to as magical as this very special art film I might as well change my initials from NJK (Nicholas John Krassowski) to NJKR for Nicholas JK Rowling  she invented magic. This is fact.

The movie stars Robyn Lively, Blake Lively's older sister, an extremely young and transgendered Joshua John Miller, the second Darrin Stevens from ""Bewitched"" Dick Sargent, the most magical owl to ever exist, Zelda Rubinstein (yes, the very same magical owl from Poltergeist), and THE Dan Gauthier! His credits include: _______________.

After the treacherously short opening credit sequence (it sadly turns out only to be a 3 minute dream of standing on a rooftop, BUT holds a special importance for featuring music by none other than the wildly popular music artist SHANA who later plays a crucial role) the movie kicks off to a rousing start that jostles and bucks you about like a mechanical bull operated by a 2-year old. Some might find that kind of ride to be a discomfort, but me my friends  I find it to be the kind of 90 minute pain in the coccyx that I can laugh about for years to come.

What happens over the course of those 90 minutes is a handful of 1989 gems that could never exist today in the Neo-1989 year of 2015 A.D. (or 26 A.T.W.  26 year After Teen Witch). Gems such as:
 Meisner-trained acting to the likes you have never seen!  Characters with so much realism you will hang out with your non-Teen Witch friends the next day, realize THEY'RE the actors, and say, ""No thank you. I'm going back to Teen Witch where the REAL friends are.""
 There are also Xtremely  and I stress XTREMELY  motivated and absolutely show-stopping musical numbers that have every clear purpose of being included in the picture. With a clear influence from the smash hit ""Breakin'"" films, songs ""I Like Boys"" and ""Top That"" are amongst the most ingenious, well-written, best choreographed, and severely poignant tunes to ever hit the silver screen. If we are honest with ourselves and say we're best friends who tell each other everything, even the things we don't tell ourselves, not even in the dark, because I mean obviously we are. Best friends I mean! I mean, yeah, haha, of course we're best friends! How could we not be?! R--r--right...? (*clears throat*)
Can we not all relate to the cheerleader chiming of ""I Like Boys""? Are we monsters who do not like boys? I think not. Do the lyrics, ""I'm hot/and you're not,/but if you want to hang with me I'll give it one shot"" from ""Top That"" not bear a resounding truth to the walls we put up around ourselves when it comes to being open to new friends and experiences?

With a plot that screams at you as if you were a nana with a busted hearing aid, Teen Witch offers the best of all worlds. There are:  teens
 witches
 comedy
 drug references
 sexual education scenes
 dancing
 music
 music & dancing
 a very short woman
 a talking dog
 kissing
 French kissing
 close-ups on French kissing
 coincidental and convenient plot points/expositional information
 an annoying younger brother
 fatherly advice
 Latin chanting
 giggles
 turmoil in a best-friendship that never gets resolved
 dancing
 montages
 clothing
 infidelity
 evil teachers
 and dancing

It's clear to see where movies like Sabrina the Teenage Witch, The Princess Diaries, and Donnie Darko got their influences. Even Sir Steven R.R. Soderbergh, the Earth's first and only filmmaker laureate, has been quoted as saying, ""The biggest influence on me as a filmmaker? I guess I'd say classic American films. And films by Fellini, Antonioni, and other European/Asian directors. Also Teen Witch.""

The only complaint I have about the whole thing is that the poster art is very misleading. One could understand the reference to ""Bewitched"", but if one expects there to be a pointed hat or any broom-stick riding in this film you will be sorely disappointed. Stick to the witchy classics like ""Hocus Pocus"" or ""Mommie Dearest"" for those kind of hijinks.

It is also a shame that, as Wikipedia states, and I quote: ""The original soundtrack for Teen Witch went unfunded as the film's investors ""discovered"" Jean-Claude Van Damme and abandoned the ""Teen Witch"" project in favor of financing 'kung foo' action genre movies."" Damn those Teen Witch investors for abandoning such a sure thing for a Canadian no one's ever heard of! And the Wikipedia submitters for spelling kung-fu incorrectly!

The final word: Do yourself a favor and watch this masterpiece.

I part you with clips from my now favorite sequences of all time that you would swear were from Australian films like ""Starstruck"" (1982) or lost scenes from ""Beat Street"" (1984), but I assure you are not.

457939,4,6302299489,"Teen Witch is perfect for anyone who lived in or loved the 80s. It's a cult classic, following the trials and tribulations of Louise Miller, a teenager girl struggling to fit in and learn who she is. In the midst of her awkward adolescence, Louise learns she is a descendant of witches...and will become a witch on her 16th birthday.

Madame Serena helps Louise perfect her craft, which I includes becoming the most popular girl in school and getting the most popular boy to fall in love with her.

However, the high life isn't all it seems  when Louise realizes what she's sacrificed in her battle for the top...and finds herself choosing between a life she wants and a life she already knows.

Teen Witch can speak to kids even today dealing with identity issues. Although the story has musical numbers mixed in, it's a story that speaks to the heart. People will learn what's really important..believing in yourself.",1385424000,2,919,4.761006289308176

6/12: Getting off the Sixteen Candles trip just right before, Teen Witch is fairly the same kind of a film but this time with disastrous results. The cinema of 80's was filled with awful, corny films that seemed to embrace bad fashion, retarded dance-like mannerisms, chopped-up hairstyles, mindless music numbers, and loud colors. Teen Witch is no exception to this. It is also one of the worst pictures I've seen. Only if it would start off with a music video with Tawny Kitaen, it might have gotten a `2' from me instead of a `1'. Maybe...maybe not. Well, there is nothing good or much else to say about Teen Witch, so I'm just going to end it with a quote from wiki which pretty much sums up the film: ""The production budget for Teen Witch was $2,500,000. The film was released in the US on April 23, 1989 and grossed $3,875 in its opening weekend at the box office, and only $27,843 total in its entire run."" All in all, I would say that you are better off drinking a glass of hydrogen peroxide and deal with the Poison Control Center afterwards.",1340496000,,1073,4.474489795918367
458018,5,6302299489,Now this is one of my all time favorite 80's movies. I would watch it EVERYTIME it came on HBO. My daugher who is 14 also liked it a lot.

458032,2,6302299489,"Robyn Lively stars as Louise Miller, a 16 year old high school misfit who discovers she is a witch;  in this half-baked cross between a John Hughes 1980's  Teen comedy and ""Bewitched"". Dick Sargent, who played mortal mate Darrin to Elizabeth Montgomery's enchanting Samantha in the second half of  the eight-year TV run of ""Bewitched"" (1969-1972), makes brief appearances here as Louise's mortal dad.
  The screenplay by Robin Menken and Vernon Zimmerman never makes the most of the supposedly ""magical"" premise. Louise's suddenly discovered magical powers don't even make sense. Why is Louise a witch? Nobody in her family has magical powers.  Louise's magical powers never seem natural or organic, because they are not. Louise uses a magic amulet, worn around her neck, to cast spells.  Louise has a quirky drama teacher (played by Marcia Wallace from ""The Bob Newhart Show"").  Louise uses her magical powers to send her favorite teacher away on a romantic vacation. Why? When Wallace suddenly disappears from the plot, so does a subplot about the school play. Supporting players Marcia Wallace, Dick Sargent and Shelley Bermann are all wasted. Zelda Rubenstein, the medium in ""Poltergeist"", gives the only effective ""adult"" performance  as Madame Serena (Serena is another nod to Elizabeth Montgomery and ""Bewitched""), the medium/witch who functions as Louise's magical mentor.
  At first, Louise uses her magical powers for the most elementary hocus-pocus; such as turning her annoying brother (Joshua Miller  into a dog, making an obnoxious date vanish, and causing a despised teacher (Shelley Bermann  to  make a fool of himself by stripping down to his underwear in class. Ha! Ha! Eventually, Louise casts a spell to make herself the most popular girl in school. She soon regrets it; especially since she can't reverse the spell.
Louise admirably resists casting a love spell on sexy Brad (Dan Gauthier). But when Brad shows a genuine interest in her, Louise isn't sure whether the attraction is real or the result of magic. Either way, lucky Louise still has a hot make-out session with Brad (well, 1989 HOT) in what looks like an  isolated love shack.
  ""Teen Witch"" features an obnoxious Soundtrack. Two musical numbers (""I Like Boys"" and ""Top That!"") are haphazardly inserted into the plot. Oh, there's also the prom finale. ""Teen Witch"" can't decide if it wants to be a bad 1980's teen comedy, a bad 1980's teen musical, or a charming/magical  teen fantasy. In trying to be all three in 94 minutes, ""Teen Witch"" ends up being a harmless, misguided mess for an undemanding audience with extremely low expectations.",1317859200,3,2625,5.122065727699531
458033,2,6302299489,"I came across this not too long ago, it jogged a memory and I wanted to watch it again.  Quite honestly, even though we have age and maturity behind us, seeing this again was more corny than nostalgic.

Robin Lively plays Louise, an awkward geek girl who is feeling out of place in high school (the most original plot line ever).  She comes across a woman who she does not recognize from the Poltergeist series (ha ha ha) who informs her that she has special, supernatural powers and can use them to her advantage.  So, Louise uses these special powers and potions in order to do the things that we wish we could do - get revenge.  She gets back at the teacher who humiliated her beyond belief in class, the obnoxious little brother, and eliminates the horrible boy she was conned into a date with.  Finally, she uses it for love.  She has a horrible, embarrassing crush on the coolest guy in school, Brad, and attempts to get him to fall for her.  But she backs off.  Then she decides that she wants to be the most popular girl in school.  And she becomes as such, and then she learns a lesson and everyone lives happily ever after.

Honestly, the story was not all that great and rather predictable.  And looking at those clothes and those haircuts is beyond funny.  But then again, he who is proud of the haircut they had 20 years ago can cast the first stone.  It was cute, it was every wish come true for every girl.  But I can't get over that teacher, maybe because we live in such a cautious world today.  He'd be thrown out of that place before he blinked for those insults he threw at her.  I guess it was a more innocent time.",1312675200,,1636,4.311475409836065

Classic story line, and with this movie you've got the added fun of the 'magic' factor.  And of course the moral lessons come along for the ride. A great fun movie to watch and be entertained.

The only problem was over here in the UK it has never been released on dvd, so i have to order it from Amazon.com and play it on my region free player.  I ordered another copy for my niece (10) for Xmas and i only ordered it a couple of weeks before the big day and was told it wouldn't arrive in time for Xmas, but would get here in the new year, i knew it would arrive though.
It was posted through my letterbox 3 days before Xmas just like i knew it would be, so thank you very much Amazon :)  Wonderful service as usual.

Regarding the film it's a great story where Louise is a geek and when she turns 16 she gets some powers (cos she's a witch) so she uses these powers to put a spell on herself to make her the most popular girl at school! There are some good songs and the film is quite funny aswell :)",1294444800,,907,3.834224598930481
458037,4,6302299489,"This movie is a typical 80s flick: the hair, the outfit, the story and especially the music. It is a light-hearted teenage romance about an ordinary girl who falls for the most popular and handsome guy at her school - who, of course - barely notices her existence. She is kinda dorky in her baggy clothes and bland hair-do and he is of course gorgeous with a hot girlfriend and entourage of equally popular buddies on his side. The opening sequence of the movie is just great in terms of how truly 80s it is. Teenagers today would think it was a joke and laugh at it, but back then, such cheesy openings, costumes, hair etc. were quite commonplace and I loved it.

Anyway the ordinary, grey mouse discovers one day that she really is a witch who can make anyone and anything do what she likes. At first she does silly things like get back at her English teacher who torments her, turn her brother into a dog or make it rain etc., but then she gets serious and puts a spell on her crush who begins to take an interest in her. And that, unfortunately, is where it becomes silly to the point of annoying.

Dont get me wrong: I loved this movie for what it was supposed to do: it is lighthearted, feel-good, happy. It's sort of like a 1980s Barbie commercial. But the story does not have much substance and the characters are flat. Dan Gauthier, who plays the crush, is very handsome and most scenes with him are shot like he was doing a Jeans or cologne commercial.  However, unlike many of the John Hughes' type of movies from that era (Some Kind of Wonderful, Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles) where the story, just like the characters, had dimension and layers, the characters and story in this movie are flat, two dimensional puppets. The premise is similar to ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" (girl falls for guy who doesnt appreciate her at first), but in ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" there were real feelings that developed, the characters were self aware, went through some kind of journey of self awareness, clarity and lessons learned, they had depth and dimension. Here, you see the boy fall for the girl because of a spell. That's it. There is a lot of internal consistency missing, like for example, after she removes the spell, what is it about HER that makes him come back to her. Where is the moment of clarity for him that makes him realize that, spell or not, she is the one? What about his gorgeous ex? Is she letting him go without a fight, or a cat fight with the new girl at least (Can't Buy me Love"", ""Secret Admirer"" anyone?). What's the lesson learned for both the girl and boy and ultimately the audience?

The lack of these elements make this movie more a farce than an actual great movie with substance. It is totally possible to have the 80s cheesy, teen-romance element in there without making it look so silly or commercial-like. One of the reasons I like 80s teen flicks, aside from having grown up with them, is the way characters - because they are so young and closer to children rather than adults - are very much in touch with their feelings and know little about guile and deception and playing games. This movie had a lot of potential but missed the target pretty closely. It is not very believable - even in the realm of believability for 80s teenage flicks.

That being said, it was still a lot of fun to watch. Not much thinking is required on your part and if you enjoy the 80s atmosphere, fashion, and music and just the lightheartedness that comes with that era, then this is one of the movies to go for. I found it to be very relaxing, especially in this day and time where everything is so complicated and where things have stopped being fun and silly and instead almost always have a serious, depressing, overtly sexual undertone. I am in my early 30s and I feel bad for the teenagers of today - with all their gadgets and facebook and twitter accounts that take them away from real human interaction and into a fantasy-world essentially with virtual friends, conversations and social lives. It must be sad. All those things were missing in the 80s and people (and the movies they were in) actually had to talk to each other, interact. No cyber stalking; if you like a boy, you have to actually go physically to the football field and watch him practice etc. There is something to be said about that and I am always glad to find it in 80s movies and especially teenage flicks. This movie, silly as it may be, is and does just that. I can imagine that as a 13 or even 17 year old, I would love it.",1287273600,,4544,4.437125748502994

FOR NO REASON.  The soundtrack is out-of-this world.  I particularly enjoyed the catchy ""I'm gonna be the most popular girl"" and ""Top That,"" during which two middle-class white kids, one of whom is dressed like a 40s gangster, have a ""rap-off"" that  trumps anything Vanilla Ice could have pulled off in his wildest dreams.

458086,5,6302299489,"Louise isn't very popular. She's younger than most of the kids in her classes because she skipped a grade. She has bad hair and an even worse wardrobe. Her younger brother is the very definition of annoying. And the guy she has a crush on doesn't even know that she's alive. All of this changes on Louise's 16th birthday. Suddenly she develops powers she didn't have before. All she has to do is wish for something and suddenly it's hers. And Louise knows what she wants. To be the most popular girl in school.

We've all been there. Those early teenage years are awkward for most people,  so Louise's story was easy to relate to as well as being entertaining. When I was a kid I waited eagerly for this movie to come on HBO or the Disney channel. For about a decade between middle school, high school, and college, I hoped and prayed it would be released on DVD. Eventually I gave up and bought a $50 copy on eBay... that's how much I love this film. And now I've finally got the DVD and it was all worth it.

Teen Witch has lost none of its charm in the nearly 20 years since its original release, and if anything it's gotten better with age. Louise's story is still touching and entertaining. There were still moments when I was mortified FOR her (what teacher would read a page from your diary aloud in class--Louise's teacher, that's who), and there were still moments when I wished I could BE her.

I remember watching this movie when i was a kid on HBO. i was not more then 8-9 but I remembered it so vividly that when I decided one day to search on Amazon for it, I went insane when I saw that it was there! This movie revolves around the 80's, you guy can probably tell by the cover picture.

Its mainly about a NOT popular girl named Louise Miller who is striving to make it throught school and at the same time crushing over the most popular guy. She went into a fortune telling store and the little lady, Who i have no idea who her name is though, lol she is that lady in poterguist as well. Either way, the fortune teller lady to her that on the night of her 16th birthday, she will have her powers. Louise sorts of thinks the lady was crazy, runs away.

True to the Fortune tellers words, she finds out the hard way.

She starts to believe in her powers and ability and used it for her own benifits. sooner or later, to make herself to become the schools most popular girl and snag the man of her dreams. but then in that process, she might lose her really close friend that has been with her through thick and thin since the beginning of probably grade school, who knows. LOL.

But then later on she realized that her powers she has may be too much for her to handle. will she give it up and go back to who she was, a nobody? or would she learn to use them wisely with the old lady's help and fix the mess that she got herself into?

the only tibit of it was when i bought this from amazon. i bought it for the price of $9.99 and then a few days later, the price changed to $6.99. what a way to take the money!",1156464000,,1703,3.9941176470588236

458198,3,6302299489,"While the boys of the 80's had Michael J. Fox as the ""Teen Wolf"", girls were well-catered for too, with Robyn Lively as TEEN WITCH.  For a fun flashback to the era of leg-warmers, frizzy perms and stonewash jeans, TEEN WITCH is a great film.

Louise Miller (Robyn Lively) is the school dork, until she inherits magical powers on her 16th birthday.  Almost immediately Louise transforms from wallflower to wonder-witch, and nothing, it seems, is impossible...not even the love of the highschool football hero (Dan Gauthier).

Zelda Rubinstein, Marcia Wallace, Shelley Berman and Dick Sargent (from ""Bewitched"") are all fabulous.  Robyn Lively is an appealing presence in the lead role.  The DVD includes both widescreen and full-frame versions of the movie.

At first she thinks life is great after casting spells to get what she wants, but eventually learns it is a hollow victory.

A great film, especially for pre-teens and early teens.

For those of us remembering those 80s fashions, it is a hoot to watch. I forgot about the big, teased, permed hair that was so popular back then.

She does so many things with her powers, and relizes in the end nothing was real, all the friends she had and all the attention was fake! So she decides on either giving up her powers or keeping them and all her fake friends! So needless to say this is a big chick flick but its totally cute!! I recommend this to anyone!

Now, the acting isn't the best, but the story line is great. It's all about Louise who doesn't realize it but she's a Witch! She comes into her powers on her 16th Birthday!  She wasn't really popular in school but when she comes into her powers everything she's wanted falls right into her hands.  Unfortunately, she really wanted the guy of her dreams to love her for her. She wanted to be popular for who she is not how she dresses or who she knows.  She learns this in the end, and some how ends up with one out of two wishes coming true.

I love all the music in this movie. I really wish they'd come out with a soundtrack. I know I'd be the first one in line.

I wanted to be her. but then when i grew older seeing it again now at 23. She was happy only for a period of time, she wants the guy to love her for who she is and not her popularity and looks. I thought she was crazy to give up her powers. She should've kept em and let the spell wear off the guy of her dreams.

From the 80's synth pop score (It's a shame a soundtrack was never released for such a unique score.  Cindy Valentine you're great.) to the campy 80's high school themed story, this movie is nothing short of pure magic.  Fans of 80's pop culture should own this late '80's 'classic'.

Somehow it manages to go so over-the-top with its cheesiness, that it transcends to charming (no easy feat; just ask Irwin Winkler who directed ""The Net"").  And despite at least two jaw-dropingly bad musical numbers, I loved every single inch of this movie.  I remember seeing this movie as a kid and falling in love with Robyn Lively: she is so charming in this movie!  Lively plays Louise Miller, a nerdy high school girl who secretly admires the captain of the football team.  She finds out she has descended from a line of witches and has been endowed with her own magical powers.  With the help of an old witch, Madame Serena, she becomes the most popular girl in school, gets the handsome football captain on her side, etc.  It is a predictable story line, with predictable outcomes and payoffs.  Even so, the movie never tries to be anything but fun  and enjoyable.  It succeeds!  Lively really carries the burden of the charm.  She is a joy to watch!  I don't expect you to be looking into a movie called ""Teen Witch"", wanting superb cinema.  Thus, if you have read this far, you probably are looking for a light, fun, charming movie.

It is hard to comprehend how this movie got produced, but I am so glad it did!

You will remember the horrible songs by heart.  You will even remember some of the magic spells that Louise says over and over again.  You will find yourself saying ""Top That!"" all the time!

I highly recommend the film for its moral of self-confidence, for the cute love story (the guy is sooo hot, even in 80's clothes), and the fashion Louise struts after she becomes popular.  I think its every girl's dream to be popular in high school and get the most popular, handsome guy in school.  I have watched this movie so many times and never get sick of it!  It may be a tad cheesy, but keep an open mind.",1081296000,12,1062,4.192118226600985

458471,1,6302299489,"My search is over.  I have found the absolute WORST movie of all time.  I just saw this movie on HBO.  I sat watching it with my jaw scraping the floor in awe over just how horrible this movie was. The storyline is overly simplistic and doesn't flow - people run off and do things for no apparent reason. There are musical numbers thrown in for no apparent reason (and they aren't good enough to make you not care that they are there).  A shy student wants to be more popular and date the cute quarterback.  She does a make over, shortens her skirt, teases her hair, slathers on some make up, tosses in a little spell and voila!  Everyone at school loves her.  I understand that the whole ""lesson"" to be learned from this is that the girl just needed to have more confidence in herself, which is a great plan, but in the end, she still dumped her best friend (they don't reconcile before the end of the movie) and changed herself to make people like her rather than remaining true to herself.  The absolute most jaw dropping horrible moment has gopt to be the whitest, cheesiest rap sequence I have ever seen.  It was painful to watch it was so bad (and I am not a fan of rap so it wasn't as though I was comparing the ""home boys"" to the real thing).  If it were possible to give this movie a negative score I would.  I would not suggest people even waste their money renting this let alone purchasing it.",1057708800,8,1405,4.264150943396227

458513,5,6302299489,"A daring departure from the British stage for a then-unknown Robyn Lively. Most reviews authored at the time for Teen Witch dismissed it as merely another assassination attempt on the good achieved from the so-called ""Vien des maisons serepents"" school of theatre appearing first in the late nineteenth century but re-emerging in 1981 again with the success of Midnight Madness. Ironically, said series paved the way for Teen Witch, albeit unintentionally (of course). 12 years later those initial reviewers have all experienced the worst regret of their words as the culutural behemoth known as Teen Witch continues to plow through our conciousness, as well as best-of lists. It's hard to imagine a first viewing, but one can divine the best way to approach Teen Witch is to think back to that first kiss. Think not of the trepidation, but consider the intitial contact--when the shame of childhood lifted.  Featuring Dick Sargent in a haunting turn as the father. His hands and face can express the oppression and rewards of love, war, anything intangible. Whatever is unexpressible by words. Don't fight it. Enshroud your very being with the genius of Sargent. No contemplation of the action can prepare or add to what you need to believe in the magic of Teen Witch. Cast aside doubt, turn off all trappings of our modern world. Press your face against this sample jar of heaven and breath deep. Breath deep children.",980553600,,1420,4.991561181434599
