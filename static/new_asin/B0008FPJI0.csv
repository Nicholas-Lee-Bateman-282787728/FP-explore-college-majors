8056085,5,B0008FPJI0,this set was pretty good with English audio Dragonball Z is pretty good it is better than any other anime.so I think that this Set could have been better if they had the original Japanese audio it was in its original format not 16 by 9 it was 4 by 3 which is good. I like when gohan goes great ape and nearly kills Piccolo.,1360886400,,323,3.9846153846153847
8056086,4,B0008FPJI0,"This volumen starts where vol. 2 left off at the start of Gohan's traning with Piccolo. His first excercise to survive alone in the wilderness for six months. Imagine a four-year-old kid with unlimited potential alone in the desert. Goku after been killed by Raditz begins his journey through Snake Way in order to train with King Kai or Kaioh. This is a excellent filler volumen except maybe the last episode which is pretty slow and got no impact on later episodes at all,not to mention having the crappiest dub ever!!!This line of dvds from funimation are worth all it's hype with the excellent audio tracks of japanese,spanish and english 2.0 and 5.1 tracks. I'm off until my next review !@!",1144713600,,695,4.75206611570248
8056087,3,B0008FPJI0,Great show and episodes are good. Was nice to watch them in original format. I didn't like that the extra's was the same Goku vs. Vagetta feture that was in the 1st. dvd. Also was lacking the follow nibus extra which I thought was real cool. All in all you need it to continue the series but would love more special features.,1120608000,,325,4.258064516129032
