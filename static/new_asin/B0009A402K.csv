2274140,4,B0009A402K,"I picked this up at Hollywood Video for a pre-Halloween weekend.  I found this film delightful.  Grade B film, no sensible plot. but for entertainment it was a blast.  The commentary is great.  Even the makers of this film can see the humor in it.  I hope they are not too embarrassed; it was a fun film.  Check it out.  If you are not a film snob, for escapist vampire entertainment this is ""well done.""",1130457600,,404,4.306666666666667
2274141,2,B0009A402K,"You know, there are a lot of vampire movies out there, and this is one of them.  Don't expect to be impressed.  On the positive side, Dark Town has lots of blood and gore, a sultry redhead (always a good thing), nudity, and even lesbian activity - but nothing can really get around the fact that the story is a little on the stupid side and the acting is - well, it's bad.  It's really bad.  The cinematography is actually quite good for a B-movie (aside from the cheap-looking opening credits), and the special effects are really quite good - complete with some of the little things that don't mean much in the grand scheme of things but are much appreciated by us connoisseurs of the art.

There's an odd grouping of characters here.  On one side, you have a severely dysfunctional family gathering for the insufferable dad's birthday party; on the other side, you've got these gangsta types who specialize in cursing and shooting people.  You won't like any of them - although, I admit, that lesbian redhead really started to grow on me.  The weird thing is that you really don't have a good idea as to who the main characters are - it pretty much comes down to who's still up and going at the very end.  It doesn't really matter how the trouble starts; all you need to know is that good old Dad comes home a changed man and the whole blood mania spreads like wildfire.  Apparently, the pale faces, weird eyes, and electronically enhanced voices don't really tip anyone off that something might be a little out of sorts here.  The gangstas get involved when they pick the wrong house to hole up in when the heat is on.  These guys can't act a lick, but they do deliver the only halfway amusing scenes in the film.  The best moment comes when this one poor dude, who has really gone through the ringer without having to now deal with vampires, tries to cover up his blood stench when the vampires start nosing around his hiding place.

If you like to watch vampires feeding on human flesh and blood, Dark Town is your movie.  Beyond that, it's really only good for a few laughs.  I can't really single out any bad performances because all of the performances were bad.  The ending works, I guess, but it's a little weird - I think they may have come up with it on the spur of the moment.  Throwing in a guy walking around carrying his own head just seemed liked pandering to us gorehounds in the audience.  Dark Town proves that blood and gore alone just don't guarantee horror success.",1130284800,19,2488,4.452538631346578
2274142,3,B0009A402K,"Considering the subject matter and film genre, I thought this independent film was watchable.  It took a very innovative look at the vampire movie genre and brought it up to date.  I wonder what other scenes didn't make it to the final version.  I would like to see a few of the actors (esp. Ms. Wright) in different vehicles that allow them to stretch their skills a little further.  If you are looking for the great American movie, this is not for you.  However, if you are looking for an entertaining and up-to-date treatment of the vampire story, try this out.",1126915200,3,564,4.544554455445544
2274143,3,B0009A402K,"First off, let me say that I'm a big fan of vampire movies...I've seen thousands of them in my lifetime so far.  I'll agree, this is your typical B-Grade Vampire Flick with your obligatory nude scenes and whatnot & people who love to overact in their acting scenes. However, Dark Town wasn't that bad. I've seen worser movies with even worser acting and tons of nude and sex scenes. It's better than alot of the other B-grade fodder(like Blood Relic) cluttering movie rental's shelves. In my opinion, they had above average production values and it's worth a rental, at least, if there's no other good movies to watch. I liked the direction they took with the vampire attack scenes and how those vampires could see through the other vampires eyes & see what they could see. It was alot more imaginative than what you normally see in vampire movies. The ending of the movie made it kinda final that those vampires wouldn't be back but, if they decide to make a Dark Town II, they could improve on things and make it alot better.  One thing, it did keep my interest til the end of the movie and that says alot(and I assure you my interest wasn't to see more nude scenes)...that's more than what I can say on watching other movies of this grade. Overall, Dark Town isn't all that bad but, then again, it isn't all that great either.",1122163200,,1329,4.5103734439834025
2274144,2,B0009A402K,"Not too much worse. That is no excuse for this film though. My first impression of this flick was that it was made by some student filmmaker, who used some poor sap's money to finance a horrible B-Movie. Some of the acting wasn't so bad. It was the sleazy and illogical plot that stunk the thing up. First, forget all of the usual ""rules"" of vampires and vampire movies. None of them apply here. Rules are made up as they go along. The people who produced this thing seem to have taken every opportunity possible to inject sordid sexual inuendo into the movie. You've got multiple lesbian scenes, multiple intimations of incest, and I believe every single actress in the movie had at least one nude or sex scene. Oddly, the nudity was ALL in girl-girl sex scenes. I'd call this a soft-core porn movie, but I think that most porn movie writers would be rightfully offended. If you're a lesbian who loves BAD horror movies, this may be just the ticket for you. If not, you'll probably want to pass on this one. I'm guessing that even Cinemax wouldn't even air this direct to video release in a 3 a.m. time slot of the producers actually paid them to.",1121472000,,1148,4.4714285714285715
2274145,1,B0009A402K,"Oh, where to begin... I knew it wasn't going to be a mind-blowing horror movie from the looks of the cover, but I have seen a lot better horror movies released from the ""Lion's Gate"" movie company than this one. Well, lets get to it: the picture is actually crisp and clear (which is usually not the case with these B-horror movies). However, on that same note, the way the camera man moves, and picks certain angles, the movie has a tiny bit of a camcorder generic feel to it. Some parts seem like a home movie or high school film project (although definitely an above average one). Next, the acting is VERY bad, it even has some of those bad ""over acting"" actors that you just love to hate. The story line is a scattered mess at the beginning that slowly comes together as it pathetically creeps along. As generic as this is though, you will get to the point where you don't even care what the plot is, or the outcome of the movie is. Speaking of plot, this is a very poorly wrote movie, in all aspects: the lines, the story, and the FX. Here is a couple examples: a guy has another guy dead banked with a gun at close range and can shoot him right then and there, and not possibly miss! Instead, he slowly walks backwards, towards a car that is behind him. He gets behind the car, and THEN starts shooting at the guy he just had dead banked at close range 3 seconds ago!!!! This may have been the dumbest scene I have seen in a long time. Another example: a guy gets hit at close range in the shoulder with a shotgun and has a medium size puddle of blood stain on his t-shirt. In reality, if you shoot someone at close range with a shot gun in the shoulder, they won't have a shoulder, neck, or arm left! The movie is full of these types of flaws. I will just leave you with these examples. Next, my personal favorite category: the gore! It was ok at times, and generic most of other times. It had a few failed attempts at gross out horror, and then some just flat out generic-Halloween-store-prop horror FX.  It did have a couple cool gore scenes (I liked the baby scene) but not even the gore saves this movie from its one star rating that I am going to give it. I should also mention really quick that the sound on this movie wasn't so hot either. It wasn't muffled, but it just wasn't up to par with other DVD's.

Verdict:  There is a few gems buried in the vast world of b-horror movies, but this definitely isn't one of them. The guy that gave this a 5 star rating is absolutely nuts, or had something to do with the making of this movie. If you notice, his good points pretty much centered around the girls in the movie (why not rent a porno?) I also think the price of this movie is a joke, not only to buy it, but to rent it as well!

2274216,1,B0009A402K,"Dark Town (Desi Scarpone, 2004)

Sometimes you watch a bad movie and it's just bad. You can let that go. No harm no foul. The director is incompetent and/or the actors are amateurs and/or the lighting tech was on acid and/or they decided on a fluffy-bunny soundtrack for a torture porn film or... whatever. And you can just let it go. But then there are the movies where you spend an hour and a half looking at those places where the writer, the director, or both had some really, really good ideas and they went wrong. Even in those cases, sometimes the potential is enough to give the film some redeeming qualities; you can see the flashes of brilliance here and there. And then there is Dark Town, a movie where, if any editing was done to it at all, they took out every glimmer of what was a good movie and left us with this ridiculous attempt at an exploitation film, which manages to exploit nothing but the intelligence and taste of those who keep watching in the vain, ludicrous hope that, somehow, it will improve. I doubt you can call this a spoiler alert given the rest of this paragraph, but just in case, spoiler alert: it doesn't. It manages to get worse at every turn. Considering how awful it starts out, that's saying something.

Plot: Curtis Armstrong (Loaded's Joel King) is a slumlord who stops by one of his Compton tenements slated for demolition to clear out the squatters. He gets a lot more than he bargained for when he finds out they're vampires. He goes home to his birthday celebration with an expectant family...and a newfound taste for the red stuff. But this isn't just any birthday--two (should-have-been-) interesting subplots are about to cross Curtis and family's path. First, Jen (Janet Martin in her screen debut), Curtis' prodigal daughter who hates everything about her father and his profession, has been convinced by her girlfriend Lisa (Meghan Stansfield, recently of American Bully) to attend the party and come out. Meanwhile, Rakeem (Sand Sharks' Delpaneaux Willis) and his crew of wannabe gangsters, with his sister Tisha (Kobina Wright in, to date, her only feature appearance) in tow after he rescued her from a shootout, are creeping the Armstrong residence after Rakeem's lawsuit against Curtis--his landlord--was thrown out of court. When a neighborhood watch incident gone horribly wrong wnds up with one of Rakeem's crew shot, they end up hiding out in the Armstrong house for entirely different reasons--and finding out the neighborhood watch is the least of their worries. (Given that Jen and Rakim are the main characters here, one does have to give the screenwriter credit for resisting the obvious temptation to call his opposite number ""Erica"". Or was that joke too subtle for these guys?)

You know, the more I think about this movie, the more it could have been a grindhouse classic. You've got all the angles here--there's violence (and some gore, but not at the torture-porn level), there's acres of gratuitous nudity and one scene of what the MPAA calls ""strong sexual content"" that should have melted the celluloid used to film it, had anyone involved either in front of or behind the camera had any aptitude for what they were doing. (Both Martin and Stansfield are drop-dead gorgeous; shot correctly, this could easily have rivaled that incredible first clinch between Mariel Hemingway and Patrice Donnelly in Personal Best.) There's typecasting of the basest sort, at least among the wannabe thugs (the lesbians don't have enough depth of character to be stereotypes, which is the main problem with the scene mentioned above). It's stupid, stupid, stupid, but it could have been stupid good instead of stupid bad, if you get my meaning. There's a reason people still watch crap like The Thing with Two Heads and Night of the Lepus and Shriek of the Mutilated decades after they should have faded into obscurity. Dark Town will never achieve the same notoriety. It's just worthless. (zero)",1355356800,3,3957,4.894187779433681
2274217,2,B0009A402K,"I bought this set for ""Modern Vampires"" and was disappointed it is on a 2-sided disc with something called, ""Bruiser"" (not ""Martin"" as pictured) on the other side. The Bruiser side was touching another disc and had scratches.  In other words, the play side of one disc is rubbing against the label side of another.",1345593600,2,314,4.709090909090909
2274218,5,B0009A402K,"This is a low budget vampire movie that centers around one family. The sound track was better than most ""B"" movies. The acting was less than most ""B"" grade horror movies, but superior to most low budget horror films. The family consists of a weird father who everyone hates. He is a slumlord. Mom is hounded by phone calls from a woman with a French accent (Ariana Fronti). The son appears to be slightly normal while his wife (Claire Mills) is having a difficult pregnancy. One daughter prefers women to men while the other daughter is involved in drug dealing with a local gang. The gang supplies the movie with a subplot. Except for the cell phone, this could have been an 80's horror movie.

The movie is humorous, but it appears to be unintentional.  Dad, who was turned into a vampire in the opening scene, speaks with a slight voice chamber echo. When he bites the drug dealing daughter, she stumbles through the house holding her neck. Mom says, ""I hope she's not coming down with something."" The special effects of the newborn infant, was a doll covered in blood- a LOL moment. The vampire carrying his head, another LOL moment. The lesbian daughter (Janet Martin) appears to be the normal person on the screen. She reminded me of a ""thin"" version of Julie Strain. This was her only film, although she may have been the best actress in this movie. Meghan Stansfield plays her lover.

If you are going to do a home break-in, make sure it is not a house full of vampires.

Being OG, Gangstas go to rob her. Only they didn't plan on stepping right into the middle of a Vampire Surprise Birthday Party! Turns out White Girl's dad is vampire, and it's his birthday. By the time the Gangstas show up, Vampire Dad has already infected like everybody else in the family. The family is all dysfunctional and stuff, which I guess means that there's an older sister who's a lesbian.

The dysfunctional family vampires infect the gangstas. It turns into an All-Vampire ho-down. The only thing that's missing is the Stevie Wonder/Paul McCartney soundtrack. Ebony and ivory sucking in perfect harmony. In the end, they all stand in front of the skylight and get turned into ash. I don't know what else to say about this thing, and to be honest, I don't want to waste any more of my time or yours talking about it.",1135641600,16,1465,4.644787644787645

WITH THAT OFF THE WAY, EXPECT A MOVIE WITH A LOT A LOT OF BLOOD AND GORE THE FIRST HALF HOUR OF THE MOVIE IS CRAP BUT AFTER THAT IT GETS ""INTERESTING"" AND AMUSING. THE VAMPIRES ARE NOT THE ""USUAL"" VAMPIRES THEY ARE A COMBINATION OF VAMPIRES AND ZOMBIES THEY DONT JUST DRINK THE BLOOD THEY EAT EVERYTHING THEY CAN OF A CORPSE.

8058643,3,B0009A402K,Peg and the kids were already pretty dysfunctional before Al showed up from work as a vampire.  There were plenty of stereotypes and some scenes were actually funny; most involved the father enjoying his new life with the undead.  The movie dragged on about 15 minutes too long.,1489536000,,278,4.770833333333333
