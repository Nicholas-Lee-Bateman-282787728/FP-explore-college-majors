4051842,4,B0031XLT3U,This is a Canadian show filmed in the beautiful mountains of Alberta. It's about a teenage girl who is a talented horse whisperer. Lots of family drama and growing pains. Well worth it if you've never seen or heard of it. It's definitely something you could watch with your parents or your kids.,1274659200,58,295,4.584905660377358

4051866,5,B0031XLT3U,Great series. Love Amy and Ty and Jack. Love hate relationship for Lou. But Tim is manipulative and  self serving and deserves whatever  heartbreaks dished out to him. I am going into the 6th season and eagerly look forward to more Heartland.,1503273600,,242,4.738095238095238

4051871,3,B0031XLT3U,"I'm from a 6th or 7th generation Canadian farm family -- a real farm where we did rough, difficult work and my Dad would have referred to Jack Bartlett as a ""Dime store Cowboy"" (some say ""Drugstore Cowboy"") because he really overplays the rugged masculinity bit while building his little matchstick fences (thinking here of stretching barbwire with Dad through a swamp and digging postholes for 8 ft posts without an auger, haying in a 120 degree (F) hayloft, picking stones long after dark, stuff like that). That lack of authenticity aside, I'm a bit concerned about the fact that someone on the show is always in a snit over something, and this would be forgivable if it were just the teenagers, but it's everyone. I have to hand the award to Amy for being in a snit more than anyone else. Even when she smiles she looks like she's in a sulk. I've only watched episodes here and there when I can't find anything else, plus the horses and scenery are amazing-- but it's already wearing on me. How about sending a message of being more understanding and not so quick to go into a snit or a sulk-- and the snarky, smart ass remarks are thick and fast-- great role model for our kids. If they're going to have the kids giving lip to adults (which I know they do -- I did it too) they shouldn't just let the adults fold on it and take it without reprimand.

The show could be improved greatly with a lot less sulkiness-- stick to the real human-animal drama in the scripts -- there's no need for these lame ""Ty didn't look at me when I got off the bus, so, like, whatever, it's over, that's fine.... sulk sulk sulk"" dramas. The Mallory character is supposed to be annoying so that works-- just her tone of voice alone could put you over the edge-- something between snarcastic, whiney, bored, and know-it-all pretty well sums it up.

It's very difficult to get lost in the Amy-Ty romance because she's always snivelling and he's always trying to appease her -- it's about as sexy as a game of checkers--- but I guess the kids see it differently, which is the target audience, after all. Which is my motivation for writing this in the first place-- how about a less sullen, whiney, quick to take offence role model for our young people?",1495152000,,2233,4.470588235294118
4051872,2,B0031XLT3U,"The video quality of this DVD is absolutely horrible. It's blocky, pixelated, and looks pretty bad.

There are two DVD versions of this show, the original canadian release, and then another one that says at the top ""as seen on GMC"". Do not buy this version. Only get the original Canadian DVDs--the quality is very noticeably better.",1494547200,4,333,4.842105263157895

If you are the kind of person who watches a show with the kids and always worries that sooner or later you will encounter an episode with some questionable content you do not have to worry about that with this show. I've seen 8 seasons of it and have always been pleasantly surprised at how the writers and producers have chosen to maintain a consistent high bar for the characters. Also the cinematography is absolutely beautiful. After the first couple episodes the show just gets better and better.,1492992000,,549,4.670103092783505

I bought the UP version of season 1. Although the pictures seems a little grainy at times, I don't mind it because UP has done an excellent job at editing out any language that had been there previously. It is so nice to watch this gem of a show without the unneccessary language.
As for the show itself, I would recommend it for preteens and up. Some of the family situations are adult, which might make it hard to explain to very young children. The show is delightful for horse lovers, and even those who have never touched a horse. Most of the horse info is incredibly accurate. It is amazing how real this show is.",1483488000,,882,4.384146341463414

But it's an enjoyable story (though somewhat predictable), contains almost none of the language and violence that overwhelms most of today's visual entertainment, and plays out in a beautiful part of our world.  The background scenery is stunning, and I've found myself bobbing to the music.  I'm only in the 5th show of season one, and it hasn't hooked me into bingeing.

I'm now watching every episode from the beginning with gusto. It's rare to find a horse show that is done realistically and well acted and well written. It's rare to find any show that meets all those criteria actually.

The horse handling, training, riding and behavioral issues are handled and explained realistically - clearly the writers have experienced horse people on staff. The scenery is gorgeous. I appreciate that this show doesn't rely on gratuitous violence, sex or drug & alcohol use to create drama or interest. It's a show I can watch and feel relaxed during and after.",1478822400,3,713,4.844262295081967

4052324,5,B0031XLT3U,"Next thing I knew, I'd binge-watched two seasons of HEARTLAND in three days. HEARTLAND, for ye poor uninitiated, is a Canadian television series what's spanned nine years already, with Season 10 looming. Me, I stumbled across it while browsing on Netflix. On a whim, I loaded the pilot episode, and here I am, three days later, my weekend spent and about to dive into Season 3. I don't know what's in store for me in Season 3. For all I know, the show jumps the shark. For now, I love this show a lot. Sometimes, I like to take a break from cynical television. HEARTLAND demonstrates that wholesome family programming can be as addictive as the CSI case-of-the-week or the broody drama or the superhero thriller.

HEARTLAND tracks sisters Lou and Amy Fleming, their grouchy grandfather Jack Bartlett (Shaun Johnston), and sudden ranch hand Ty Borden (Graham Wardle), there to serve out his probation, as they experience the ups and downs of life on a Canadian horse rescue farm nestled in the foothills of the Alberta Rockies. Not that I'm the most gung-ho animal lover, but I found the premise irresistible. The most core character is 15-year-old Amy (Amber Marshall) who still grieves for her mom and who despairs at living up to her mom's reputation as a horse whisperer. See, her mom had passed on this knack to Amy. But the pressure is insane that Amy's under. It's a 600 acre ranch what's been with the Bartlett family for six generations, and it's badly floundering. Amy's mom was exceptional with frightened and abused horses. But she was lousy when it came to the business side of things. On her watch, the unpaid bills had mounted like poo in an untended horse stall.

Now, consider Samantha Louise ""Lou"" Fleming (Michelle Morgan), bossy older sister to Amy. Lou'd been away in New York these past four years, precious MBA in tow and having by now mastered those obnoxious big city ways. Back home for the funeral, Lou is dismayed to learn that the bank would give the Heartland ranch a loan only were she to stay as a guarantor. Oh, and something else about Lou: she's deathly afraid of horses. Why don't you linger to find out why?

Even factoring in Lou's business acumen, the key to Heartland's regaining eventual solvency is her younger sister Amy. Amy's the one with the magic touch. It's uncanny how she can read a horse, how, by dint of her mom's training and her own natural instincts, she can teach a traumatized horse to trust again. And the camera loves the quietly expressive Amber Marshall. I dunno, there's this core of honesty to her, a kind of natural glow about her. When she's working with a horse, when she's riding a horse, there's unfettered joy writ on her face and in her body language. She's special. Man, If Amber Marshall isn't like this in real life, then she is a consummate thespian at her young age and I am a bit devastated.

No great, big secret to this show's popularity or longevity. HEARTLAND invites you in with wide open arms. With its cast of very appealing characters and its focus on equestrian stuff and old-fashioned family themes that never really go out of style and on gentle humor, it's like a modern-day incarnation of, say, LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE. Yeah, it's sort of a western minus the wild shoot-'em-ups (but there may be a fist fight or three). If you're a horse lover, it's gratifying that the show explores the diverse roles that horses play, as well as delves into the different methods in handling and caring for them hay-munchers.

Okay, no, it's not so original in its plotting. The episodes are strewn with familiar tropes: the estranged father (Chris Potter); the rich, mean girl (Cindy Busby); and Graham Wardle, as likable as he is, is still the typical bad boy with the heart of gold. But the cast is so good that I don't mind the predictable story beats. I don't mind the emphasis on depicting the ""rigors"" of teen life. Maybe because the teen angst is balanced with healthy portions of adult dilemmas. In that sense, it's more of a multi-generational saga. Shaun Johnston is marvelous as Grandpa Jack, and one of the best things about the show is his ongoing rivalry with Chris Potter's estranged dad, him who years ago walked out on the girls. Michelle Morgan is fantastic as Lou, although it may take a minute to warm to her, she's so simultaneously take charge and oblivious and sort of spastic and sad sack. But I've come to root for her hard. She works so hard to save the ranch, comes up with so many nutso ideas, and she's all the time overshadowed by her gifted younger sister.

There's a very fleeting shot in the opening credits of a shaft of sunlight bursting thru the gloomy sky to cast warmth and light on the landscape below. And it's super-corny but I took that one moment as a metaphor for what this show represents to me. HEARTLAND makes me happy. It's crazy that, nowadays, HEARTLAND passes for counterculture programming, given the current pulse of what's popular on television. I'm happy there's still room for a show like this, a show that thrives not on snark and gratuitous sex and violence but, rather, on old-school, homegrown pleasures, on the grace of a tight-knit family and the love of animals and commonplace drama made gripping because you care so deeply for the characters going thru the drama. And, for me, this is on three days of binging. Who knows, I may even read the twenty-something books it's based on.",1474156800,2,5422,4.666317991631799

Sometimes the way people treat their horses is hard to watch, but I guess that is the way some people behave toward their animals.  The story line is catching, looking forward to season two.",1473984000,,271,4.625

4052343,5,B0031XLT3U,This is a totally relaxing and entertaining series which stimulates all of the emotions of the viewer.  We started watching and found ourselves compelled to watch episode after episode and we are still enjoying every moment.,1473984000,,224,5.222222222222222
4052344,5,B0031XLT3U,"I'm not a horse lover, romantic or Canadian.  To the contrary, I'm a ""Walking Dead"" junkie who watched & enjoyed every episode of The Shield.""  Had I found Heartland while flipping channels, I would not have watched more than a minute or two.  And in the process would have missed out on a pleasant entertainment experience.

I started a new exercise regimen and went looking on Netflix for a series with many episodes that could chain together automatically without my having to fritz with channel-changing, and that didn't require watching every second in the way that action adventure or crime stories sometimes do.

I don't know what made me choose Heartland but I feel lucky to have found it  Yes, the story line in each episode is somewhat predictable, and the characterizations are stereotyped.  That's what makes it PERFECT for when you're doing something else that commands your primary attention.  Miss a word or two of dialogue?  Not a problem.  For multi-taskers who want something to half watch/listen to run while cleaning house, cooking, working, etc., Heartland beats elevator music and might just make you look forward to tasks.

There's something else in the series that I've come to appreciate and that's the simplicity.  When the world feels overwhelming, escaping into Heartland is soothing and uplifting.  I get it that it's idealized and unrealistic, i.e., not real.  Real people write it, however, perform in it, produce it, sponsor it and watch it in sufficient numbers to make it a success.  In an imperfect world, that's a lot of people demonstrating a preference for traditional values.  I'll take it.",1473811200,2,1629,5.022388059701493

4052746,5,B0031XLT3U,I Love this show so much. I wish amazon had the newer season on here where i can buy them to stream online but they don't They only have the first three seasons with that option so hopefully the other seasons are avaiable that way in the future. So i really love this show it is a great show all the way around and it would be great for any family. I remember finding this show on netflix back in 2013. I started it and never looked back and thanks to this show i made it though that winter that year. We were having weeks of 40 below degree F weather that year it was probably the coldest winter i ever saw. If it wasn't for this show and how happy it made me feel i do not think i would have made it threw that winter. Ok maybe i would have but this just made things a little easier and made me forget how bad the cold weather really was. I really would recommend this show if you have never seen it. I hope i could convince someone else to give this show a chance.

They stopped putting 22 episodes in each dvd after the season 3 one.of this type.  However then the big Boo Boo happened.

4053027,5,B0031XLT3U,"this is never happen to me, i just fall in love with heartland tv show. Heartland is a Canadian family drama television series which debuted on CBC on October 14, 2007. The series is loosely based on the Heartland books by Lauren Brooke. The TV series changes the setting from Virginia, USA (in the original novels) to the Alberta Rockies in Alberta, Canada.

Heartland follows sisters Amy and Lou Fleming and their grandfather Jack Bartlett through the highs and lows of life on a horse ranch in cattle country. The story details how even though Amy and Lou's mother was killed in a car accident, they continue to keep their mother's dream alive by healing abused and neglected horses.
in the first season Amy Fleming was only 15 when her mother died from her injuries in a car accident in which she was involved. Amy inherited her mother's gift of horse curing. When Amy returned home she decided to carry on her mother's work healing abused or damaged horses including the horse that her mother gave her life to save named Spartan. Amy also had to deal with the return of her older sister Lou who had been living in New York City. Before Amy's mother died, she agreed to allow Ty Borden to live at Heartland as part of his probation and when he arrived, Amy's grandfather went with his daughters wishes. Ty grows close to Amy and becomes best friends with her, later falling in love but they soon have a heartbreaking break up. Though later on, while working with a pair of horses, they manage to make amends.

The US (GMC/UP) SEASON TWO starts where the 1st leaves off & continues into SEASON THREE.  Each US set continues in this way.

4053094,5,B0031XLT3U,"I must say, this show is amazing. I can't get enough of it. I have fallen in love with the scenery, the characters, the story, and the horses. The characters are so real, and the drama and plot makes this show even more loveable and addicting. I am obsessed.

Season One is a great start, and the ending episode is so dramatic, wonderful, and terrible at the same time. The end of Season One ends on the edge of a cliff, and you have to watch the next season. Season Two is great, and you get so frustrated with what happens between some of the main characters, but in the end of the season, the last episode, you are SO happy with the way things ended up working out. You just can't get enough of it. Season Three is amazing, and the characters and relationships just keep getting deeper and better, and the plot thickens. Season Four has a dramatic, underline dramatic, middle section, and if you are a fan, as I am, you get even more drawn in because you HAVE to know what happens. The end of season Four is great. This show always leaves you wanting more and either so happy, upset, and completely wanting to keep watching.

My Mom, sister, and brother love this show so much that we were watching the episodes every day over lunch. We started watching the show because a friend on Facebook posted about how amazing and great the show is. It made my big sister watch it, and then she encouraged my little brother and I to watch it, and then my mother started really liking it.

We are now watching season five, and I am so excited and thrilled to keep watching. Season Six awaits, and Season Seven is starting on CBC in Canada this month. (September 2013). The seasons have so many episodes, and so much drama, that you can't get enough of it, and are addicted.

I came across the series on Netflix and was hooked and have purchased 4 out of the 5 seasons available (still need to get season 3).  It is a shame that Hollywood and New York can no longer create shows that are not completely filled with blood, sex, nudity, Drugs, cursing, immoral & amoral characters as heros, violence etc.  I'm in no way a prude, have watched and enjoyed my share of R rated movies and even dropped a few F bombs, but in the last few years, I've been leaning toward BBC & Canadian productions because they are producing TV shows with stories and characters that I can admire.  Without being to smarmy, Heartland has good character development, values and moral messages that I can admire, relate to and enjoy. I can watch this show without being embarassed if someone walks into the room or cringing everytime a character says a line.  A real family show without being stupid.",1376870400,4,970,4.551724137931035

Finding out that the lead actress actually rides and lives a similar lifestyle has made it even more exciting to watch.  The stories have also provided a glimmer into the equestrian world.  I might have to find an equine show on Colt competition and Liberty horsemanship. Now I just need to find Season 7 episodes I can watch in the USA.",1376438400,,501,4.928571428571429

Delivery & Quality: The product arrived quickly and was packaged well. It is a cardstock box with an opening at one end for thin, plastic dvd holders to insert in and the pictures are of good quality.

The Show: I started watching this show on Netflix and was so hooked that when they cut off mid 3rd season (one thing I hate about Netflix), I decided to just get all the DVDs so that I could continue to enjoy this program. It's about a teenage girl whose mother died and is being reared by her grandfather on a horse ranch with her sister and other characters. Her job is working with the horses as she has a special gift and understanding for them. There are many characters in the show that you'll get used to and know who they are (although new characters get introduced, there is none of this constant changing of characters like I've seen in some programs). This show is also full of adventure, love of family, and respectfulness as well as romances and life challenges. All-in-all an excellent show",1371859200,,1139,4.471153846153846

4053180,5,B0031XLT3U,"I stumbled upon this series because of an Amazon suggestion link. This is by far the best family series that I have ever watched. As a mom of teens & preteens, I am always searching for something the entire family can watch together. Heartland has it all...a breathtaking setting, humorous & likable characters, and an unbelievably well-constructed romance that has the viewer completely enchanted with the characters. Nicholas Sparks has some competition with these script writers! The extraordinary cinema-photography is unbelievable...they use cranes to film aerial shorts of rolling rivers, snow-capped landscapes, and wild horses. The sets are beautifully constructed...authentic log cabins, stone fireplaces, weathered fishing cabins, wooden fishing piers, and rustic red barns provide a beautiful backdrop for the dialogue. My children were too young six years ago to notice this series when it first aired, but now they are the perfect age. Luckily, the entire series is available so they can follow it from season 1 episode 1. I would highly recommend this for any one who appreciates a stunning natural setting and/or for families with preteens/teens.",1363564800,3,1161,5.4916201117318435
4053181,5,B0031XLT3U,This is a fun and exciting series. Very simple but compelling. I can't wait to get the rest of the series. I may have to move to Canada to watch the rest! Awesome show!!!,1363046400,,170,4.029411764705882
4053192,5,B0031XLT3U,"I HIGHLY recommend this series to any family or individuals. My sister had been telling us about it for months so we finally turned it on and WOW! Awesome, powerful female lead characters (THREE of them)so it's an IDEAL show for young girls. The three female leads are smart, clever, compassionate, powerful and best of all one of them is a horse whisperer(or as her character puts it 'she listens to horses').
Stunning scenery and vistas, beautifully filmed.  Incredible shots of Amy working with the 'troubled' horses. We have been watching it on Netflix so I cannot speak for the DVDs.

This is the kind of TV entertainment we need more of in our culture. Heart-felt, powerful stories with real issues being addressed in a way that is mindful of it's young audience.  Adults LOVE this series as much as kids. The only minor thing that stood out: In series One there is an awkward moment when a teenage boy is angry about someone's behaviour...he blurts out the first part of a swear word then changes his word choice when he remembers the 12 yr old next to him. The 12 yr old understands what he's doing and calls him on, it in a funny way. I think this is a scene that anyone can relate to -- being a kid and hearing someone start to swear and then try to change the second part of the word. There is one fist fight in the entire first season. That is the extent of the violence in the show.  Other than the conflicts between characters that is resolved in appropriate ways.

I'd give this series 10 stars if possible.  My sister is on season 6 and said it only gets better!

Again I cannot say this enough - this is an EXCELLENT series for girls because of the strong female leads.",1362960000,,1686,4.419354838709677

4053258,1,B0031XLT3U,"I own EVERY Season of Heartland on DVD and every single set I have owned (bought brand new mind you) has been terrible quality. The characters look grainy and the colors are very washed out. The odd thing is that the episodes on Netflix are almost HD quality so I don't get it. It seems as though whomever is converting it to the dvds is doing a shoddy job.

My husband walked in while I was watching (he is an Engineer) and said ""Wow, that looks like a VHS"" and that is exactly what it looks like. We have two HD TVs and I have watched it on both TVs and still the same results. I think they are cutting corners and using a crappy company to do their conversions. I feel a little ripped off to be honest. Especially since I am such a loyal fan and this is one of the biggest shows in Canada so its not like they are low on budget. If you can get your episodes any other way Netflix, iTunes, etc...I would do that. I know its nice to have the box sets , but believe me when I say its not worth the $45.

Unfortunately I live in the US so I have no choice, but to buy the box sets since Netflix takes forever to post the seasons up and apparently there is a Canadian iTunes and a USA iTunes so it won't let me buy the episodes through their because they are only offered to Canadians.

If you have a choice skip the DVDS as they are terrible quality. I actually just bought Season 5 and its so grainy that I have been watching it on YouTube, thats how sad it is. I own the Dvds and I am having to resort to YouTube to watch it because the quality is so annoying.

4053274,5,B0031XLT3U,"I bought the ""Complete First Season"" last year (the original Canadian release). It contains all 13 episodes from that season (as was shown on the CBC network in Canada). And I've been holding off buying more seasons, hoping the price would go down as they released season 5.

Now the GMC network is releasing Heartland seasons (so far, just 2).  However, you need to be advised that they actually contain more than 1 season in the set.
As I noted in my title, the ""Complete First Season"" (GMC label) is in fact Season 1: Episodes 1-13 AND Season 2: Episodes 1-9.  GMC's ""Complete Second Season"" (that I purchased last week) is really Season 2: Episodes 10-18 AND Season 3: Episodes 1-14.

So if you're trying to mix and match the original Canadian releases, which apparently they're phasing out (Amazon had been selling them- seasons 1 to 4 to be exact, but they're now disappearing in favor for the GMC labeled ones), be advised you can't without missing some episodes along the way!

Now I'm going to have to either purchase only the GMC editions (who knows when the other half of season 3, and half of season 4 will be released by GMC), or only the Canadian ones..  Not sure why E1 Entertainment decided to back this re-release being the Canadian editions were Region 1, and worked just fine for those of us in the US.  What they should have done was convert them to BluRay discs if they wanted to revamp the line.

Even though I'm in the US, I discovered this show on the CW network, and ended up finding all the episodes online, so I'm now caught up with everything that's been put out, and am anxiously awaiting season 6!

  FYI, Canada is set to release Season 5 in this September, around the time of the newest season (6) being aired on Sunday Sept. 16th.  Whether Amazon US will carry that is not known (but you could check the Canadian side at Amazon.ca  or eBay).  For official info I recommend looking up search ""CBC Heartland"", or add /cbcheartland  on Facebook.

Hope this helps clear up any confusion!!",1346112000,4,2017,4.561111111111111

But don't be discouraged, it intertwines all members of the family and friends.  I especially enjoyed the story line with Jack (the grandfather)starting a romance.  So few shows today show adult characters and their life changes.  The beautiful backdrop is a bonus.  I may have to visit the Canadian Rockies.

Please come out with Season Two on Instant Video!  It may give me the incentive to look into Prime Membership.

4053290,5,B0031XLT3U,"Being a dedicated reader of Lauren Brooke's fantastic Heartland book series as a child, I was ecstatic to find out about the 2007 TV debut. It felt like all my dreams had come true! But, unfortunately, living in Australia restricted me from viewing the show. I was absolutely devastated and spent so much time searching around local stores for people who just might stock it. They didn't, of course, and just when I considered giving up, I found the Complete First Season on Amazon and guess what? They were shipping to Australia! It felt like Christmas had come early! I ordered it straight away then perched out by the mailbox each morning for next couple of weeks, anxious for it to arrive. When it did, I carefully (but quickly) ripped open the packaging to reveal this gorgeous gem it seemed I'd waited my entire life for. The next 585 minutes was a continuous loop of crying, laughing, smiling and jumping up at regular intervals to switch discs. I'd never been so happy.

Heartland is a beautiful family show like no other. It is guaranteed to fill your heart with joy, your eyes with tears, and your life with love with each perfectly paced and excellently written episode. I feel like I have this special, homely connection with the cast, though I've never met them before, and love inviting them into my living room each night.

Big sister, returns from New York to help with the business part of the ranch, while Amy, follows in her mothers footsteps by caring for and training horses at the ranch.

It shows new love and heartbreak - It shows loosing loved ones to death - It shows how you can prosper from hard work - It shows how to deal with family differences - It shows dealing with problems when it would be easier just to walk off - Most of all it shows love for God's creations, nature, animals and humans.

The show presents characters that you can believe in with realistic attitudes and attributes.  With the death of their mother, two sisters, as different as sisters can be, with their grandfather, work to keep the family ranch with different ideas.  Amy, the youngest, continues her mother's work with abused and neglected horses, while Lou, with a MBA, tries her hand at developing an ""equestrian retreat"" (dude ranch).  Grandpa Jack wants to keep to the old ways and offers Lou ideas to incorporate the old with her new ideas.  The girls' father comes into the picture after the mother's death working nearby to earn the trust from his daughters and to become part of their lives.  Lots of water under the bridge, though, between Dad and Grandpa!  Then there's the snooty neighbors, what happened to Grandpa Jack's girlfriend, Lisa, and of course, Ty, the cute ranch hand that is turning out to be less bad boy and more insightful and thoughtful.  Shot with the Canadian Rockies as back drop, this show is lovely to view.  The music is relaxing and adds so much to the atmosphere of the show.  Good clean wholesome fun for the entire family.

4053349,5,B0031XLT3U,My daughter recently moved back home after living in Canada for two years. Her favorite show while she was in Canada was the Heartland series. I bought her the first season and she was thrilled. I am very pleased with this purchase and will be looking to buy the remaining seasons in the future. I would like to get her the second season for Christmas. Would buy this again from Amazon!!,1288137600,18,387,4.464788732394366
4053350,4,B0031XLT3U,"When watching this series for the first time I couldn't help but compare it to the book series that it was suppose to be based on. I eventually was forced to conclude that each (the books and shows) have their own 'Good Points'. The shows are enjoyable, most everyone will like them. My big downer on it was Ty's past and Lou's marriage mate. In my opinion they should have followed the book but whatever. All in all I would and have reccomended the series to anyone.",1282003200,11,467,4.379310344827586
4053351,4,B0031XLT3U,"We watched this as a family after my daughters read the Heartland books, on which the TV show is loosely based. They've done a good job with the show, it's nicely set and photographed, and the acting is decent. The horse scenes are pretty silly at times and full of technical errors, but that's TV for you (we're horse owners, which kind of ruins the horse scenes for us as we pick them apart!). Great show for family viewing (not very small children, but over 6 OK). We're eagerly awaiting Season 2!",1275782400,7,500,4.445652173913044

8387272,1,B0031XLT3U,"This set from EOne and GMC/Up is the bastard stepchild of art being trumped by Mr. Potter commerce. To assuage the head in the sand minds of tender little fundamentalists EOne offers a censored version of Heartland in this season one set. If I had known this--I see no indication that it is censored on the DVD case though I have to admit my 60 plus year old eyes can't read text that small--I would not have purchased it. EOne and anyone else who approved this censored version of Heartland should be ashamed of themselves though I doubt they will. I suspect in their petty minds art always should be trumped trumped by commerce. If EOne had an ounce of moral fibre they would immediately refund those of us who bought this snake oil season set and any other censored season sets we bought. Zero stars for this set.

As for the show itself, the first five episodes are really good. The next five are good. 4 stars for the show.

By the way EOne and their fundamentalist partners have mixed and matched the Canadian seasons of Heartland and produced a bastardised set in the process. Season One  of the EOne/GMC/Up set contains all of season one and part of season two. The moral of this story? Avoid the EOne/GMC/UP sets like the plague unless words like ""arse"" traumatise you so much that they will send you into fifty years of expensive therapy.

Addendum: I found a note at the bottom on the back of the DVD case which says ""Please note package contains episodes as seen on GMCTV. This is a poor caveat since some of us who buy Heartland have never heard of GMCTV and do not know that it engages in censorship. This would be a better caveat: Please note that some episodes are edited for content.",1510531200,6,1700,4.474193548387097
