2672099,5,B000JJ6JZW,I appreciated how Amazon sold 4 seasons in one pack. It's way less expensive than buying them individually and they all came convieniently packaged together. I hope this is something that will be considered for other shows like The Simpsons or South Park. Thanks.,1169164800,3,263,5.0
2672100,5,B000JJ6JZW,A+++++ always will order from Amazon when it comes to videos.  Great service.,1168387200,2,77,4.923076923076923
2672101,5,B000JJ6JZW,Considering that it would cost you over $200 if you bought them all seperatly this seems like a really good deal. I've been collecting them as they come out but if I was a new fan this would be a great pick.,1166140800,13,207,3.9523809523809526
8150695,5,B000JJ6JZW,"This is a great DVD collection of Family Guy.  If you don't already own it, you must get it through Amazon.  The quality is great, and the price is greater!",1334966400,,156,4.166666666666667
8150696,5,B000JJ6JZW,"Being a huge fan of family guy and a DVD collecting fanatic, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to purchase this set.

This was the first time I decided to buy a used product on Amazon and I wasn't disappointed. I did my research before buying, checking to see if both the seller had a lot of positive reviews and if the had a ""fulfillment by Amazon"" label next to the sellers name...just in case.

I ended up buying a like-new version for a mere $28.49 which saved me more then 50% off a brand new version that Amazon sells and more then 75% off if I bought each volume individually (also new).

I tested every single DVD and watched all the episodes to verify that they all played. On one or two episodes there was a skipping issue but just required a quick wipe on the DVD to get it working perfectly again. The packaging that holds the DVDS were also in great shape, with only one volume having slight scuff marks but easily overlooked.

If you're just getting into family guy and looking at buying all the DVDs, definitely look at the bundled volume deals and don't shy away from the used versions.",1322179200,2,1103,4.365853658536586

8150698,5,B000JJ6JZW,I finished watching them this summer and I was very sad when I did. I want more Family Guy.....,1193616000,,95,4.052631578947368
8150699,5,B000JJ6JZW,"Family Guy is a the funniest show I have seen in a long time. When you get a talking dog and a baby sent on world domination you have a great show! Of course the first two or three seasons are the best, but Family Guy is a hilarious show and you will not be disappointed. I enjoyed every moment and I love Amazon for putting these volumes together! WARNING: May cause uncontrollabe laughing!",1187827200,,391,4.297297297297297

8150701,1,B000JJ6JZW,"the one star is for the 'package deal.' unless I am missing something, this doesn't sound like a good deal. I just ordered the 4 volumes individually and paid 87.96...

***update***
i should have posted this when i made the discovery. one of the discs in volume 3 had unreadable portions. this happened on the xbox and xbox hddvd drive. i didn't get around to checking out on any other dvd player.",1186358400,6,397,4.513888888888889
8150702,5,B000JJ6JZW,This has got to be the best DVD investment I've made!  The Griffins and the Spooner Street Crew have a way of getting funnier each time I watch them.  Seth McFarlane and his team are comedic geniuses because I get each and every one of their jokes and whacky situations.  It's good to know that I'm in good company.,1184544000,,315,4.305084745762712
8150703,5,B000JJ6JZW,I just loooove Family guy. My kids (I know...they shouldn't be watching half the stuff involved with this show) Love Stewie. Worth having in your DVD collection!,1181174400,,161,5.0
