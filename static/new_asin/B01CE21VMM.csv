8752809,1,B01CE21VMM,Many of the claims made in this movie show such an overwhelming lack of basic scientific or mathematical understanding that it's impossible to take any of it seriously. The confidence with which these claims are made and then passed off as hard empirical fact is also painful to sit through. I love these sorts of things but this specific title is probably showcased unironically at flat Earth conventions.,1528675200,,406,4.985294117647059
8752810,1,B01CE21VMM,"A lot of claims with very little direct professional/expert testimony. I believe there may be an ET presence on the moon, and there has been expert testimony to same. This particular video, however, takes too many liberties with its speculation on who is on the moon and how the moon got placed where it is in its proximity to Earth. I am not saying that many of the videos claims are necessarily incorrect, however, to assume who the aliens are, how the moon got here, and that the aliens populated the planet in the manner claimed is beyond any direct scientific proof. I found ""Aliens On The Moon"" to be a more informative and scientifically backed treatise on the subject.",1487116800,6,676,4.641666666666667
