7842319,2,6303276547,"This Australian film tells a story about smuggling medical supplies to Kampuchea for gold bars. An adventurer agrees to drive a truck with supplies from Thailand to Cambodian rebels. He has the authorization from an opium smoking warlord who controls the area. But there are problems along the way. He has to worry about being double-crossed by the buyers as well as the protectors, and attacked by robbers. He can't trust the diplomat who set up this deal.

The film shows a tropical country for the events. When things go awry, the adventurer makes them right with his experience and cunning. Of course there are winners and losers in all commercial undertakings that occur in a lawless world. The adventurer survives it all, getting the gold and the girl. The gold bars are donated to a charity. [Believable?] The future is left to your imagination. Some will find happiness, one will find that ""all that glistens isn't gold"". This film just plods along with actions that can be expected.",1170720000,,991,4.863905325443787
