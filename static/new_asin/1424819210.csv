176172,5,1424819210,Few films have the visual spendor and dramatic depth of this epic. Director William Wyler never lets the spectacle overwhelm the drama- you care about the characters. The acting is uniformally excellent. The score  by Miklos Rozsa and the cinematography by Robert Surtees are both  breathtaking. The chariot race is legend. A classic by any standard. A must  see in widescreen.,912816000,,377,5.147540983606557

176176,5,1424819210,"One of the best shows ever created!  Although I did not like the show as much once Richard Dean Anderson stepped away from the show and only became a 'guest' star.  The show was even more fantastic when it was produced on Showtime, because then the episodes were longer, and you didn't have to deal with commercials.  Overall, though, the show is absolutely fantastic!",1506384000,,368,4.71875

Unfortunately, it isn't included in Prime, so I'm stuck paying extra to see the rest.  Some episodes are stupid or comedic, but there are some good ones in there that make it worth going through them all.

I started watching in 2016 on Amazon Prime after a couple of people said it was a good show, and I really like it.  I love how the newer shows follow a progressive timeline.  Lot of twists and turns.  Good characters that work together and you become fond of them.  Pragmatic Colonel O'Neil makes the quips.  Teal'c, strong silent warrior with knowledge of the enemy.  Daniel, thoughtful explorer, the conscience of the group, but who also takes risks.  Major Carter, female warrior, but also a brilliant scientist with huge curiosity.  Alternating funny, sad, suspenseful episodes.  Expertly written and directed.",1475798400,,697,4.931034482758621

176315,5,1424819210,"This show is really fun Sci Fi.

It will make you laugh when Jack tosses out his quips about whatever situation they are in. And it will just all around entertain you.

I didn't watch this show when it originally aired. I am seeing it for the first time now, in 2016. That's significant because there have been a lot of changes in television over the past 15 years that could have easily made this 1990's show outdated and unwatchable. Namely the advent of HDTV. Sci Fi in HD is a different experience than Sci Fi in standard definition.

I am happy to say that Stargate SG-1 works despite being a 4:3 aspect ratio (bars on the sides) standard definition presentation. The thing about sci fi is that everything centers around a good story. If you have a good story, older special effects don't matter. That's why the original Star Trek series is still watchable despite the low quality effects and Shatner's acting. I love it because the stories are great.

SG1 is a great story. It's fun. It's entertaining. And it takes Gene Roddenberry's approach to sci fi, which is that the story should be about the people, not about the science. The science should be a plot element, not the entire story. That's what made Star Trek work, and it's what makes SG1 work.

Each episode is about the people interacting with other species or other branches of humanity. The result is that the cast learns about itself and what it means to be human. Yes, there are action scenes and what not that are fun too. And it's always entertaining to watch Teal'c try to fit in. But at its core, this show is about the people in it.

It's a very entertaining show and you don't have to have enjoyed it when it originally aired to pick it up and start liking it now.

Watching it on the Amazon FireStick I find the video quality to be good. Again, it's standard definition. There is nothing they can do to increase the resolution. But the color depth is good. The clarity is good for SD. The only thing that's weird is that the commercial breaks start very abruptly, like they were cut a second too soon. There are no commercials on Amazon video, but this was a broadcast TV show that includes break points for commercials. This presentation edits out the Stargate logo that was appear before and after the advertisements, so you see a blank screen for 1 second where there would have been commercials. Those blank spaces seem to start a second early, where the scene just abruptly stops. It's very minor, but you do notice it. This is an issue with ever season of Stargate SG1. It's not something that just popped up in season 5.",1473379200,3,2604,4.504237288135593

176619,4,1424819210,"For a Sci-fi, it is pretty believable for a tv show. It proved to be very entertaining, with very likable characters (even a number of the bad ones), thought-provoking, sometimes corny, glib lines (mostly Richard Dean Anderson's character, Colonel/Brig. General, Jack O'Neill), and maybe praises militaristic and secret government programs more than I like. However, the camaraderie between main characters was quite lovely. And it was refreshing that the team had support from most of their superiors. It would have been nice if Goa'uld gods had somewhat different voices or a touch of intonation since they got much screen time. Clever writing for the escapades of Michael Shanks' character, Daniel Jackson, but each actor had well-developed characters. Amanda Tapping was great as the very intellegent and highly skilled Major/Captain/Colonel Samantha Carter. She also  lit up the screen without cleavage and tights. A well written show, skilled editing and special effects, fairly multicultural for the times, and not one race was always the 'bad guy,'  This is a good series to binge on, and then watch the 1994 movie with James Spader and Kurt Russell, and then the Atlantis tv spinoff.
My favorite scfi tv series was the 2004 remake of Battlestar Galactica, but Stargate SG-1 held my interest for its 10 seasons--not an easy accomplishment.",1454976000,,1347,5.26046511627907

176649,5,1424819210,One of the best shows no matter the type that builds on the characters and their relationships. I admit I've watched it many times over and I still catch little nuances. Like the episode Daniel asks Teal'c when he learned to drive a car and Teal'c responds 'in 1969' which references the episode when SG-1 when back in time to 1969.

176724,5,1424819210,"I totally love this series. While this season was not as interesting to me as season four, I still found it to be great sci-fi. This season contains the episode ""2001"", which I loved and is the prequel to one of my all time favorite episodes, ""2010""  from season four. Moreover, in season five the viewer discovers the origin of the inter-galactic scourge known as The Replicators.

This season also has a seminal  moment with  regards to one of my least favorite members of the SG-1 team,  Dr. Daniel Jackson, and it is is a pretty radical one. I, for one, was perfectly happy with it, as it is a bit of a game changer. As a result, I can't wait to see what season six has to offer!",1446249600,,683,4.263565891472868

176825,5,1424819210,Awesome!  I just love watching each episode and particularly look forward to seeing Col. Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) and what he brings to the character. I love his smart-ass remarks in each and every episode as he keeps it real.  Good job on the part of the writers in factoring this into the script and good job on the part of Richard (Col.

Season 5 is still watchable but losing Daniel Jackson is where this show stopped being about its potential and slowly started sinking into what it became which was mediocre and cliche.

Also, the constant ""everybody everywhere speaks English"" always seems silly. But still, it is interesting, and they bring up a lot of military / personal / social / scientific consequence issues in a kind of non-stop barrage with an action backdrop.

176929,5,1424819210,"I bought this instead of the 10-season set because (a) it was cheaper to buy each season separately and (b) there were reviews of the 10-season set complaining of poorly manufactured disc retainers allowing the discs to be loose and scratched during shipping. The individual season sets do not suffer from this issue.

I loved all 10 seasons of this series, and have enjoyed many episodes more than once, so it was only logical to purchase the entire set to watch again in the future. It's an excellent sci-fi series with immersive plot arcs embedded across the series combined with well-done, entertaining individual episode plots that are easily able to stand on their own. The characters and the story are equally compelling, due to both quality writing and great acting.

If I could make one change about the series, I would have kept Richard Dean Anderson's character in a more prominent role throughout, but I recognize that actors sometimes have to move on. While Ben Browder took some getting used to (mostly just because I missed Anderson's presence), he filled his role well and the series continued to thrive as a result.",1431302400,,1132,4.890625
176930,5,1424819210,I enjoy seeing Stargate SG-1 again. A lot has changed since it first aired; they use floppy disc and VCR tapes which reminds me how old I am.

This season, after all, has the mega episode: Wormhole X-Treme.

We bought the first 9 seasons years ago and are now going through them in order. Season 5 had two shattered disks. In pieces. They had never been played before but...many years since buying them. Amazon Prime to the rescue!",1416355200,,529,4.739130434782608

177157,5,1424819210,"I love the Stargate series and except for Universe the spinoffs.  SG-1 was the original and had the most to establish in terms of story line, all the allies and foes, and the shows between that are just telling an episode  (or two) worth of story as a ""day in the life"" for how things are at that point in time in the shows history.  Certainly the episodes that fall into this category span all the seasons but because of what is known are quite different between season 2 and 8 because of the technical and relational differences.  But I love this series and have watched every episode, movie, of every season of every version.  While Universe was to serious and not written in the same spirit as SG1 and Atlantis I still watched it and learned to enjoy it, just not love it as I did the others.  I've watched this series when it was new, once through when it came out on video and am going through it at a much slower pace just enjoying a favorite show savoring each episode a little more knowing there is only so many times I can watch something before it starts to become to familiar  I'm sure SG1 is one of those series that I will always watch after enough time has passed and I miss the show.  No other science fiction show has made me sad when an alien race died (Asgard) or used such an effective combination of formula stories and long term story lines to cause me to embrace it.  The interlacing of future sci fi with real earth history was a brilliant concept and they worked it it well with various mythologies showing up on other worlds over the seasons as the backdrop for past interactions between the human race and alien races.  Daniel and his trip to the ascended plain is a classic move of cutting a character loose while still keeping him included at a much lower level to simply bring him back right in step with the fight with the bad guy of the time.  It's not like reading the Lord of the Rings mind you, but for science fiction TV shows I'll always consider SG1 right below the star trek franchise and a classic I hope they find to write a new series from.  In time...",1413676800,,2094,4.300254452926208
177158,5,1424819210,Love it what more could I say,1413244800,,29,3.2857142857142856
177159,3,1424819210,What I hate about the Last Stand is they do NOT show how the SG-1 gets the F out of there. The very next episode is the same old dumb s*** preparing for the next mission. Bull S***! You cannot just be in a hopeless situation and then ignore everything and magically reappear like Kenny in an episode of Southpark. I know all scifi series have they're gaffs but come on this one is big enough to shove a whole solar system through. MGM really bites the big one for all time on this one.,1413072000,,485,4.11578947368421

Season 5 is probably the best season yet but you have to watch the 4 previous to really appreciate it I think.  Another thing I  like about this season is that they bring previous episodes from other seasons into play in this season.

It frequently seems like a day or 2 on a planet is all it takes for him to learn everything about a culture or language, so the fact that he was still working on something from a year earlier just made much more sense for an archaeologist.

177266,5,1424819210,"I Quite enjoyed the film ""Stargate"", which this program (""Stargate: SG-1"") is based on.  At first, I wasn't sure of the cast chemistry - while I liked Richard Dean Anderson (RDA) of MacGyver fame, he was no Kurt Russell, and this Michael Shanks dude was the James ""unSpader,"" after watching the first couple of  seasons practically back to back, I was impressed. I thought to myself, ""for Television, they sure spent a LOT of money, and what a good decision it was. The writing is quite strong (and consistent, good story arcs), but more importantly, they kept the character continuity, and relayed it back to the film characters seamlessly. Starting with the Egyptian 'Bosses"" (Bad Guys), which they keep going throughout the seasons, then new directions: the alien symbiotic snake-like ""GoA'uld"", the Tokra, the Asgard Grey, the Prometheus... all these ideas woven seamlessly to provide a universe of action, education, enlightenment, and entertainment.

Next to ""Star Trek:TNG"", ""Stargate: SG-1"" is the best SciFi television ever produced. Highly recommend the Amazon Prime viewing experience - I LOVE being able to sit down with some munchies, and watch 1, or 10 shows in a row WITHOUT COMMERCIALS!! (YeeHaw!!) It's a great value.

Some, like me, were involved with other things when Stargate SG1 was actually on television - so we have the great privilege and pleasure to be able to see the magnificent acting that went into this series NOW.

As a Richard Dean Anderson fan since his days as MacGyver, it has been a joy for me to watch Mr. Anderson develop the character of Col. Jack O'Neill.  Amanda Tapping as Samantha Carter has been a delight to watch also, as have all the rest of the splendid cast of Stargate SG1.

So, whether you have been a fan of Stargate SG1 for many years - or are, like me, a ""new"" fan of the program, order the complete season series, Season 5 included, and sit back and just enjoy the greatness of this program.  LOVE IT.",1379376000,,939,4.404624277456647

Episode 100 may or may not be hilarious to you (I thought it was better than avg but not all that) but any show that's willing to look in the mirror and laugh at itself the way they did deserves a nod of respect.  When you have a sarcophagus ""dead"" can just be a timeout. Likewise w/ critical wounds and symbiotic healing,ascension, etc.  But hey, there is always enough defying expectations to keep it suspenseful even when you know as I do that somehow all the big players will show up somehow for many more seasons to come.  Good season in a good show.  Viva Amazon prime and it's free TV& movies for members!",1378166400,,661,4.429752066115703

I love the chemistry between all the leads. I think that's what makes the show. Richard Dean Anderson is priceless as O'Neill. His quips and sarcasm add a lot of flavor to even the dullest plots.
There are a lot of good science fiction ideas, plenty of action, the chemistry between O'Neill and Carter, and plenty of other excellent features. This series became one of my favorite science fiction series.",1374364800,,550,4.861702127659575

177422,5,1424819210,"Growing up, I was a huge fan of Stargate SG1. It is probably one of the first series I ever followed. I literally grew up with this show. Season 5 is by far one of my favorite  seasons. I think it balanced the ""action"" and ""fighting"" episodes nicely with the ""story building"" episodes. Shoot, most of the time in this particular season, they were one in the same. I also think we get a ton of character development. Especially with Teal'c and Daniel Jackson. I don't want to give anything away, but the Goa'uld become even more of a major threat in this season. Especially in the last 4-5 episodes. All in all, if you are a fan of the show, you simply must watch this season. If you are already hooked, you will stay hooked. If you are starting to lose interest by this point, just give it one more season before you decide to pass on the show. I promise that you will not be dissapointed.",1372982400,,889,4.291666666666667

177472,5,1424819210,"This show is amazing.  Every week it is the same old thing, but the same old thing manages to be refreshingly different and strangely satisfying.  The writers imaginations as well as their ability to weave old and new stories together in increasingly intricate tapestries is remarkable. The actors ability to keep their characters fresh and engaging is a mark of true mastery of their craft.  There is sufficient character development to offset the more fanciful aspects of the alien's, their home planets, and their technology.  Some of the other cultures are echoing phases of our own history, while others are breaking new ground.  The SG 1 team, with General Hammond,is able to keep their moral compass pointed straight at the right place. Even when all seems lost in the labryinths of political intrigue and military hierarchy, they always manage to right the wrongs in ways that keep it all going for one more week.

- The DVDs appear to lack any subtitles for Russian speaking parts (e.g. s05e08 ""The Tomb""), and I definitely recall there being subtitles when I watched them on TV when it originally aired.
- The is no ""play all"" option to play all the episodes on a given disc continually. Also, when an episode ends it brings you to the menu for that episode (instead of the episode list). This wouldn't be bad, if only the put the episode-specific extra (where applicable) in this menu as well (which they don't).

This nuisance of the play-all and menus is made more annoying than need be, because if you let an episode play out completely (including the credits) it then shows you dvd production credits for the set after EVERY episode, and you can't fast fast forward it.

177499,5,1424819210,"Meridian is easily one of my favorite episodes, if not my most favorite. You go from season to season and each episode one by one seeing Daniel sort of bumble along, awkward and uncertain (as his signature arm cross makes obvious), struggling with the military's direct, utilitarian approach to people and cultures and technology. He frequently gets in the way of what apparently needs to be done to try to bring about what he feels is the greater good, and when the audience is in the heat of the moment, we react to his actions the same way O'Neill sometimes does, they seem interfering, self-righteous, and naive. But along comes Meridian, and we see the Daniel we knew all along, but didn't realize we knew: he saves an entire country and maybe even an entire planet single handedly, and then takes the blame for the crime. When he's told not to take the fall, he defends his attackers and accusers and rationalizes their actions, and we realize he's been doing this for every thing that's done him wrong so far. When his friends come to him and tell him what he's meant to them, we realize he's meant the same to all of us. His entire life has been a practice in trying to understand people and things no matter how different they were from himself, to find peaceful solutions through communication instead of force, and to see the good in everyone and everything, even things that intend to do him harm. But it's obvious why he feels like a failure: Sha're, Sarah, Reese, and so many others he's tried to help have been killed or harmed by the very things he was trying to protect them from. His reward for kindness has just been more suffering, so it seems obvious why he would be willing to accept death... and also why he, among everyone who's died in the SGC so far, is the only one capable of going beyond it. There is something almost profound about this episode, and moments like these are what make Stargate SG-1 So. Dang. Good.",1355097600,,1942,4.535612535612535

177530,5,1424819210,"I have an extremely conflicted relationship with STARGATE SG-1.  On the one hand, I think it one of the most consistently entertaining shows on TV, almost always featuring very strong individual episodes with remarkably few truly awful episodes.  Although THE X-FILES was a much greater series than STARGATE SG-1, it probably had far more truly weak episodes (although it also had many more truly great ones).  STARGATE SG-1's greatest virtue is its amazing consistency.  Given that it is now heading into its tenth season, its track record for steadily solid episodes is almost without precedent.  On the other hand, there was after Seasons Two and Three an opportunity to do something extraordinary, the potential for true greatness.  In those two seasons it appeared that the show was going to embrace the long story arc format with one episode after another spilling into the next.  Unfortunately, that did not occur.  Luckily the show does possess a memory, and frequently builds new episodes on previous episodes.  But in the end its narrative is more like STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION instead of FARSCAPE or FIREFLY.  When I reflect on how good the individual episodes are, I inevitably wonder just how good the show could have been if in Seasons Four and Five they had fully embraced the long narrative format.

Why didn't STARGATE embrace the long narrative format after seemingly flirting with it in the second and third seasons?  My suspicion is that the network put pressure on them to stress stand alone episodes.  Networks are leery of long narrative shows because the assumption is that it makes it more difficult to attract new viewers.  There is undoubtedly some truth to this.  It would have been very hard for a new viewer to pick up BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER in the middle of Season Five while someone trying to start right now with LOST would have a great deal of difficulty, just as someone trying to start 24 with the 13th hour would be very much at a loss.  But there is also no question that the long narrative format is vastly superior as entertainment and as art for the viewers.  There is simply no greater experience on television than becoming deeply immersed in a series as it tells a rapidly developing and evolving story.

Another mark of the long narrative format is character development.  Think of how much Aeryn Sun grew and changed over four seasons of FARSCAPE or Cordelia or Willow in BUFFY.  One of the marks of the best shows is how characters change and grow over the course of a series.  In this regard, STARGATE was by the end of Season Five quite a disappointment.  Even factoring in Daniel Jackson's ascension at the end of the season, none of the main characters had changed or grown since the show began.  Compare this to any of the main characters on BUFFY, where all of the characters had changed dramatically.  Another contrast with BUFFY:  each season of BUFFY was strikingly different from any other season.  The show never was content with simply doing the same thing each year.  Unfortunately, by Season Five of STARGATE it was pretty clear that the series had fallen into a formula.  It had become a ""safe"" show, one that was not going to play with its core formula or truly shake things up.  At the end of Season Five the ascension of Daniel Jackson seemed to show promise for altering the formula, but that was a hope that would prove short lived.

So the show had at the end of Season Five become enormously dependable.  Each episode was almost certainly going to be a good one, but it was also going to be one in which nothing new was truly going to happen.  It had become a show whose each episode I would very much look forward to, but one that never caused the viewer to say, ""Oh my God!  What's going to happen next!?""  That is a question that I always asked with BUFFY or ANGEL or LOST or FARSCAPE or even SMALLVILLE, but that I never wanted to ask with STARGATE.

I find all of this tragic.  One of my regrets about STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION is that it ran before shows like THE X-FILES and BUFFY made it possible for Sci-fi or supernatural shows to embrace the long narrative format.  I find it perplexing that STARGATE did not choose to do so.  It did, however, by continuously referring to previous episodes give some of the feeling of the long narrative format.  But I would have so much more enjoyed the series if each week left many of the central plot elements unresolved.  I would have liked to see an episode effect a character so deeply that they couldn't forget what had happened for weeks to come.

Still, all in all this remained an extremely fine Sci-fi series.  And even as we head into Season Ten it remains a show that I enjoy very much indeed.",1152144000,4,4734,4.627098321342926

Although THE X-FILES was a much greater series than STARGATE SG-1, it probably had far more truly weak episodes (although it also had many more truly great ones).  STARGATE SG-1's greatest virtue is its amazing consistency.  Given that it is now heading into its tenth season, its track record for steadily solid episodes is almost without precedent.  On the other hand, there was after Seasons Two and Three an opportunity to do something extraordinary, the potential for true greatness.  In those two seasons it appeared that the show was going to embrace the long story arc format with one episode after another spilling into the next.  Unfortunately, that did not occur.  Luckily the show does possess a memory, and frequently builds new episodes on previous episodes.  But in the end its narrative is more like STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION instead of FARSCAPE or FIREFLY.  When I reflect on how good the individual episodes are, I inevitably wonder just how good the show could have been if in Seasons Four and Five they had fully embraced the long narrative format.

Why didn't STARGATE embrace the long narrative format after seemingly flirting with it in the second and third seasons?  My suspicion is that the network put pressure on them to stress stand alone episodes.  Networks are leery of long narrative shows because the assumption is that it makes it more difficult to attract new viewers.  There is undoubtedly some truth to this.  It would have been very hard for a new viewer to pick up BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER in the middle of Season Five while someone trying to start right now with LOST would have a great deal of difficulty, just as someone trying to start 24 with the 13th hour would be very much at a loss.  But there is also no question that the long narrative format is vastly superior as entertainment and as art for the viewers.  There is simply no greater experience on television than becoming deeply immersed in a series as it tells a rapidly developing and evolving story.

Another mark of the long narrative format is character development.  Think of how much Aeryn Sun grew and changed over four seasons of FARSCAPE or Cordelia or Willow in BUFFY.  One of the marks of the best shows is how characters change and grow over the course of a series.  In this regard, STARGATE was by the end of Season Five quite a disappointment.  Even factoring in Daniel Jackson's ascension at the end of the season, none of the main characters had changed or grown since the show began.  Compare this to any of the main characters on BUFFY, where all of the characters had changed dramatically.  Another contrast with BUFFY:  each season of BUFFY was strikingly different from any other season.  The show never was content with simply doing the same thing each year.  Unfortunately, by Season Five of STARGATE it was pretty clear that the series had fallen into a formula.  It had become a ""safe"" show, one that was not going to play with its core formula or truly shake things up.  At the end of Season Five the ascension of Daniel Jackson seemed to show promise for altering the formula, but that was a hope that would prove short lived.

So the show had at the end of Season Five become enormously dependable.  Each episode was almost certainly going to be a good one, but it was also going to be one in which nothing new was truly going to happen.  It had become a show whose each episode I would very much look forward to, but one that never caused the viewer to say, ""Oh my God!  What's going to happen next!?""  That is a question that I always asked with BUFFY or ANGEL or LOST or FARSCAPE or even SMALLVILLE, but that I never wanted to ask with STARGATE.

I find all of this tragic.  One of my regrets about STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION is that it ran before shows like THE X-FILES and BUFFY made it possible for Sci-fi or supernatural shows to embrace the long narrative format.  I find it perplexing that STARGATE did not choose to do so.  It did, however, by continuously referring to previous episodes give some of the feeling of the long narrative format.  But I would have so much more enjoyed the series if each week left many of the central plot elements unresolved.  I would have liked to see an episode effect a character so deeply that they couldn't forget what had happened for weeks to come.

Still, all in all this remained an extremely fine Sci-fi series.  And even as we head into Season Ten it remains a show that I enjoy very much indeed.",1152144000,4,4734,4.627098321342926

177534,4,1424819210,"Season 5 is the season of changes. SG-1 takes a drastic change, killing off their old foe Apophis, introducing a new, deadlier villain, and killing off one of SG-1's own. This season sets up the next three years of the show, and finally the climactic battle between the replicators, goa'uld, and the tau'ri and their allies at the end of season 8. Of the first five seasons, this is probably my favorite.

The highs of this season:

  -The permanent death of Apophis

  -The death of the Tollan's by a mysterious new threath.

  -""Summit"" and ""Last Stand""

  -Armageddon meets SG-1

  -The origin of the Replicators is finally revealed",1146960000,3,635,4.794392523364486
177535,5,1424819210,"This season is very similar in format and feel of the fourth season, and it is slightly better-not for the amount of great episodes, but for the greatness of the great episodes. In this season, we tie up four loose ends and continue several story arcs, and add the greatest villain of all time. This season is awesome-though the two-parter that creates build-up for Anubis is just mediocre. Sadly, in this season we see the departure of Daniel Jackson, the best character on the show, for a season-maybe if the episode that he left in wasn't so emotional I wouldn't be so sad. Great episodes include: Enemies, Threshold, Ascension, The Fifth Man, 2001, Desperate Measures(Maybourne is so cool!), Wormhole Extreme!, Proving Ground, 48 Hours, Summit, Last Stand, Fail Safe, The Warrior, Menace, Meridian, Revelations.

177536,4,1424819210,"Season five sees some major changes. New story lines are introduced. New characters and mythologies are introduced and an old character dies off. Maybe I am just suffering some from fatigue after watching 5 seasons straight through but the show does not seem as exciting any more. It is still highly enjoyable, however. I'm going to see the series through to the end.

Episode synopses follow:

Enemies - Last season ended with a bang when the SG1 crew with a captured Ghoul ship blew up a star in an attempt to destroy Apothis and his fleet. They did blow up the star and the fleet but all is not well. The team was entering hyperspace as the star blew up and they were blown a LONG way away. Just to keep things interesting, Apothis and his personal ship were blown to the same destination. Apothis has Teal'c as a prisoner and is about to destroy the humans when ""help"" shows up. The new ship engages the ghoul mother ship but they turn out to be worse than Apothis. It is a replicator ship. That is the situation. The SG1 team has a set of simple tasks: Get home, keep the replicators from threatening home, escape from Apothis, and contend with a brainwashed Teal'c who is now loyal to Apothis. It's not going to be easy.

Threshold - The SG1 team managed to make it back alive from the mission of the previous episode but there is still a big problem. Teal'c's brainwashing is still in effect and he still considers Apothis to be his god. The prognosis is not good and Teal'c's old mentor, Braytac, comes up with the only possible cure. It is an ancient Jaffa right which involves removing the symbiote and letting the patient remember past experiences. Most patients do not survive the procedure but it is the only hope. Teal'c proves as stubborn in illness as he is in life. There are a few flashbacks to earlier episodes but most of the flashbacks concern his days before the coming of the Earth people. It is an interesting piece of character development for the big guy.

Ascension - The team is investigating a new planet which shows signs of high development and signs of destruction. They also find what appears to be a gigantic weapon. While she is investigating it, Maj. Carter is knocked unconscious. When she comes to, she seems to be fine but a little snippy. After going home, she encounters a strange man who keeps popping up. It seems that Maj. Carter has a stalker. He has the hots for her but there is something more. He is an alien who is only visible when he wants to be. He only wants to be visible for her. After a while, he becomes so enthralled with her that he permanently takes human form. Without others of his kind, he cannot return to his ethereal state. All of this takes place as the Pentagon is further investigating the weapon found on the planet. It is a BIG one. It turns out, the alien is the one originally responsible for building it. It destroyed the civilization of the planet and he was left behind as punishment. Now, he will do anything to stop it from being activated again.

The Fifth Man - The SG1 team makes it through the Stargate in the middle of a firefight. Daniel, Maj. Clark and Teal'c get through to earth but O'Neill is left behind with the new lieutenant who had been wounded in the firefight. The rest of the team promises to return quickly with reinforcements. Those reinforcements will be a long time in coming. Nobody back at SGC has any idea who the mystery lieutenant is. They have never heard of him. They rightly fear that the SG1 team has come under the influence of alien mind control. They have, in a manner of speaking but it is not the alien who is the really dangerous one. The real rat is a government investigator with a political motive.

Red Sky - The SG1 team visits a new planet. It is not quite primitive but it is several centuries behind earth's level. The people there are worshippers of the Asgard. Freyer is their particular deity. They enjoy protection from the ghouls and everything seems fine until the team's visit. The SGC Stargate apparently bypasses a few safeguards. In this instance, their wormhole passed through the local sun, transporting some heavy elements that are destabilizing the star, thus dooming the locals. When they realize this, the SG1 team wants to help. They contact the Asgard only to find that Thor is unavailable, Freyer is not as likeably and that a treaty clause prevents them from helping. It is up to the SG1 team to save the planet. Unfortunately, they are hundreds, if not thousands, of years behind the technology curve to do so.

Rite of Passage - Puberty is never easy. It is especially tough when you are the last member of your race and the ghouls once tried to blow up the earth by planting a bomb inside you. When you are also the result of a genetic experiment designed to make a better host for ghouls things just go from bad to worse. Cassandra was the young girl in whom a bomb was planted several seasons ago. Since that time, she has lived as the adopted daughter of Doc Frasier. She's becoming a young woman now and her body is changing. Its changing in even more ways that your average, hormone drenched teenager. There was a strange rite of passage for girls of her age back on her planet. When girls became fevered, they would go into the woods where they would be zapped into a ghoul lab for examination. They come back cured. Now, Cassandra can't get to the woods. She is dying. The only one who can help is a ghoul prisoner. It's a deal with a devil.

Beast of Burden - ""It is our custom to welcome visitors with a drink,"" says the alien. ""It is our custom to drink,"" says Col. O'Neill. It's a hilarious line when it takes place but, unfortunately, there is little else that is truly enjoyable about this episode. Last season, the SG1 team visited the Unas home world where Daniel managed to make friends with an Unas that was planning on eating him. Since that time, Daniel has been studying the primordial Unas world by means of hidden video cameras. When reviewing the tapes, he is shocked to find that human visitors from another world have conducted a raid and have kidnapped Daniel's friend, Chaka. When they go to investigate, they find that he has been taken by slavers who use the Unas as beasts of burden on a planet that has all of the worst qualities of the American south. The slavery is ugly but the solutions are not as simple as one would hope. It's a good episode but it is not very much fun.

The Tomb - The SG1 team investigate a new planet and this one has a few new twists. It has a Babylonian mythos instead of an Egyptian one. They also find a package of Russian cigarettes. This is troubling. It seems that while the Russians had a working gate for a few weeks, a team went missing. They were not an ""authorized"" team. They were up to some political skullduggery in the same manner that such things happen with all too much frequency to the American crew. A joint mission is sent out to rescue them. This seems to please nobody. Russians and Americans do not exactly have a good track record of working together. Things are made worse when they get locked inside the ziggurat (Babylonian pyramid) and find themselves stuck with a ghoul infesting an alien bug. Things probably could work better if there were not so many hidden agendas.

Between Two Fires - The Tollans, an advanced race who have show a disdain towards earth, are showing signs of changing their policy of not trading technology to inferiors. In fact, they are willing to exchange a large number of ion cannons capable of destroying ghoul mother ships. Things are not as simple as they seem, however. There are vague warnings that the Tollan's offers will lead to the destruction of earth. There are competing factions at work within the Tollan government. Some of them seem to be in league with the really bad guys. The threats against Earth might be official Tollan government policy.

2001 - The episode opens with the SG1 team coming home through the Stargate with good news. They have found an advanced race which wants to share technology with earth. In return, they want access to the Stargate system. They have a gate but not a dialing device. It seems to be a deal which is too good to be true. Nobody is really suspicious except for Col. O'Neill. An embassy is sent to arrange a treaty. While the officials are doing the negotiating, Daniel and Teal'c do some background snooping. They learn that the race they are dealing with is the same one that was so dangerous that, an alternate reality version of O'Neill sent a warning back from the year 2010 to warn them. This raises the suspicion level. Unfortunately, the politicians get involved and mess things up for political gain. The aliens are out for conquest and a US senator is determined to help them to ensure his own election to the presidency.

Desperate Measures - Major Carter is kidnapped and it happens right here on earth. Within the first few minutes of the episode, almost all of the old earth standard bad guys put in an appearance. So does a Jaffa, on earth. It is not Teal'c. It so happens that while the Russians had an active program, they captured a live ghoul in a jaffa. The ghoul has since matured and needs a new host. A rich American has arranged the kidnapping of Carter so that his private scientists can figure out how her ghoul was successfully extracted. The rich guy is dying and hopes to infest himself with a ghoul in order to get healed and then have the alien removed. Things do not go according to plan. Everyone has his own agenda. Very few of them are on the side of goodness and light.

Wormhole X-treme - In an extremely fun episode last season, the team encountered a dweeb who thought he was an alien stranded on earth and who seemed to know way too much about the Stargate program. It turns out that he was right. He was an alien. He was part of a crew which deserted their own forces just before their final defeat and was hiding out on earth. His crewmates were not quite in the same league of dweebishness and neither were they taking part in his memories. The episode ended with the dweeb realizing who he really is and the others disappearing. This time they're back. The dweeb is now the technical advisor on a cable TV show that is WAY too similar to the Stargate program. Meanwhile, an alien ship is heading towards earth and it is identified as being made by the same race as the dweeb. SGC wants to know what is going on and the SG1 team is dispatched to find out. The problem is, the dweeb doesn't remember anything. He thinks he is just a TV writer. His former crewmates are lurking in the background, however, and it is certain that something is going on. It has its serious moments but, mostly, it is a comedy. Its great tongue in cheek stuff!

Proving Ground - The SG1 team is assigned to train and evaluate a group of candidates for the Stargate program. The testing is brutal and Col. O'Neill is not will to cut any slack. He is just about to flunk his group of candidates when he gets a terrible message. The SGC has been overrun by aliens. Worse, he is wounded by some SG personnel who have been taken over. Now, he has to take back the facility with a bunch of trainees he was getting ready to flunk. A lot is riding on this one and things are not what they seem.

48 Hours - While beating a hasty retreat from a ghoul controlled planet, Teal'c takes one last shot at the ghoul ship piloted by Tanith. The shot is good but the ship crashes into the gate just after Teal'c steps through. The rest of the team has already made it home safely but Teal'c is still in transit when the connection is cut. Everyone fears that he is lost for good. Maj. Carter realizes, though, that the Earth gate has received the transmission. They just need the machine to put him back together again. Meanwhile, any activation of the gate will empty the buffer containing Teal'c. Everyone works on a solution. One team tries to negotiate with the Russians for a gate control device. An NID idiot tries to blackmail Gen. Hammond and offers the needed information in exchange for some ghoul devices. Maj. Carter tries to work out a technical solution while being impeded by a self righteous idiot. It is Col. O'Neill who saves the day, however. He lacks the finesse or style of the others but he has his own way of getting things done.

Summit - The Ghoul system lords are in disarray as they struggle for supremacy amongst themselves. In an effort to divert their efforts into something more beneficial for themselves, they hold a summit meeting to try and divvy up the galaxy. This can be frightening but it yields opportunities as well. The Tok'ra conceive a plan to kill all the major players of the system Lords. They plan to infiltrate Daniel Jackson as a servant of one of them and let him release a poison that will kill them all. It's a workable plan but the plans do not survive contact with the enemy. There is a ghoul puppet master behind the scenes, Anubis, who has his own plot to wipe out the Tok'ra and take control of the System Lords. Having Daniel encounter his former lover as the host for one of the System Lords was not in the script either. It's a cliffhanger.

Last Stand - The ghoul summit is not going as well as it could. They don't trust each other. They are further thrown into confusion by the appearance of Osiris who is serving as the proxy of Anubis. Anubis was so evil that even the System Lords would not deal with him. A deal has been offered to get back into their good graces, however. He offers to destroy the Tok'ra and take on Earth. The Tok'ra have pretty much been destroyed. Just a part of SG1 is left alive. Daniel, who is posing as the servant of one of the system lords, comes up with a plan to capture Osiris (who possesses his former girlfriend) and use her to find Anubis. Rescuing SG1 and what is left of the Tok'ra information base also seems like a good idea. It's hard to picture Daniel doing all this covert op stuff but he seems to be doing well at it.

Fail Safe - This one seems to be strictly a local episode. An astronomer discovers a huge asteroid on a collision course with earth. It is big enough to extinguish all life and there are very few options for dealing with it. The Asgard won't help because of treaty considerations. The Tollans have been wiped out. The Tok'Ra are on the run after the last few episodes. Its looks like the Earth is doomed. Maj. Carter comes up with a plan to use a ghoul ship shot down on a distant planet to get a bomb to the asteroid. This will require getting to the planet, fixing the ship, getting it back to the solar system and placing the bomb. None of these steps is simple. Things get even more complicated when they learn some of the strange properties of the asteroid. Blowing it up might just make things worse.

The Warrior - Teal'c and his old mentor, Bray'tac hear of an army of rebel Jaffa. They go to check things out and it is almost too good to be true. The army does exist and it is led by a First Prime who killed his own master, Imhotep. This guy is a charmer and has a way with words. Listening to him inspires all those who hear. He is preparing an army of rebel Jaffa. The SG1 team is sent to meet with this newcomer and see if an alliance can be reached. They offer food and weapons but the rebels are strangely disdainful of them. They prefer their own ways even though they border on suicidal. Col. O'Neill begins to trust the rebel leader less and less. He thinks that the guy is just trying to amass a personal power base. He is going to recommend against an alliance. Teal'c, though, is sucked in. He wants to believe. He is set to leave the SG1 team until he learns a terrible secret.

Menace - The SG1 team finds a new planet that was at one time highly advanced but is now destroyed. The only thing of worth they find is an inactive android. It is lying on top of a slab in a ""laboratory"". They take it (her) back to SGC and manage to revive her. They want to learn what happened to her world. When the android is revived, she is incredibly human but shows the emotional maturity of a small child. Even so, she is still incredibly advanced. She also has an incredible ability. She can build replicators. She thinks of them as toys and she will defend her toys. Her toys will also defend her whenever she gets hacked off. She gets hacked off easily and throws tantrums like any small child.

The Sentinel - Back when the NID was running its own renegade Stargate program, they visited a world which had an advanced ghoul defense system. The renegades wanted to investigate the system but the locals refused because it would violate religious taboos. They go to investigate it anyway. They think the left everything exactly like it was before but something has gone wrong. The Sentinel device is not working. The ghouls have invaded and are trying to get access to the same equipment. So far, a force field has stymied everyone but the planet and its people are being destroyed. The SG1 team is sent back to try to repair the matter. They take with them one of the renegades who is now sitting on death row. It is a race to see who can decipher the system first.

Meridian - The team comes back from visiting a new world and Daniel is in trouble. The world they visited is at about the level of the US in the 1940s and they have just found their Stargate and a bunch of other neat stuff. Included in this stuff is a completely new element that makes what the gate is made of look weak in comparison. They are trying to make a bomb. The SG1 team has misgivings over this. They fear that they can destroy their entire planet. Still, the locals persist and the reaction goes out of control. Daniel saved the day, prevented the destruction of the planet and got himself a fatal does of radiation in the process. Most of the episode involves conversations between Daniel and the strange light being met several seasons ago. The discussions are about his future and whether he will live or transcend to something else.

Revelations - The SG1 team is still in disarray over the loss of Daniel Jackson. Part of the trouble is that nobody is sure if he is dead or really gone on to something better. While the team is trying to come to grips with the loss, the Asgard finally put in an appearance after being incommunicado for several episodes where their help would have been invaluable. Thor has been captured by the ghouls. A renegade group of ghouls led by the shadowy Anubis and aided by Osiris have attacked an Asgard research outpost. The future of the Asgard depends on preventing the information contained there from falling into enemy hands. The SG1 team is enlisted to help gather the research and escape. Then they learn from Heimdall that Thor is still alive. A major rescue mission is mounted and, of course, nothing goes according to plan. The season ends on a different note, however, since this episode is not a cliffhanger.",1138665600,8,18993,4.451436781609195

The move away from exploration and towards X-files-like conspiracies and a plethora of blowing stuff up makes little sense in the established universe of the Stargate folks.  The first half of the season was good; a little bit preachy, but still with the characters doing their thing.

""Wormhole Extreme"", the 100th episode, purported to be a tribute to the show, is a mess of in-jokes and has a serious lack of the actual characters, instead focusing on comic alien Marty and his parody of the SG-1 team.  Things pretty much go downhill from there, to the point where original character Daniel Jackson is ""killed off"" in a very obvious scifi-never-kills-anyone kind of way.  (Don't worry, he returns in season 7)

Some good stories, a couple great ones, and several real duds.  Jonathan Glassner--why did you leave?!",1093651200,10,871,4.9655172413793105
177545,4,1424819210,"Sadly, the fifth season of Stargate: SG-1 broke the streak of progressively better seasons that had been going on ever since the first season.  The year began with a cool premiere, ""Enemies"", but the next couple episodes sucked.  For example, the episode ""Beast of Burden"", which deals with Daniel Jackson's (Michael Shanks) Unas friend, Chaka, was terrible.  Personally, I also hated the episode ""The First Ones"" from last year which began the Chaka thread.  I mean, I haven't seen episodes this bad since Season 1 (many of the Season 1 episodes, while good, are far inferior to the episodes of Seasons 2-4).  Once you reach the third disc, beginning with the episode ""Between Two Fires"", the episodes become good again.  However, the bad episodes weren't the only problems that this season faced.  Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) seemed to regress a little bit because he seemed a lot less tolerent of Daniel than he had been in the last two years (he does, however, reveal his true feelings about Jackson in the episode ""Meridian"").  Teal'c (Christopher Judge) and Dr. Janet Frasier (Teryl Rothery) were underused, as were the Asgard, who seem to have put politics ahead of real problems.
However, when this season was good, it was REALLY good.  There were some amazing story developments this year, beginning with the final demise of Apophis (Peter Williams), the Goa'uld System Lord who has been making life difficult for the SGC ever since the first season.  Next, the Tollan, an extremely advanced race of humans who are allied with Earth, begin acting suspiciously, the SGC begins recruiting new officers, the motives of the Aschen from last season are revealed, the Tok'Ra are nearly destroyed, and the Jaffa rebellion begins to truly become a problem for the System Lords.  And then, Daniel is brought to a System Lord summit where he has the chance to wipe out the Goa'uld threat forever, that is until he learns of the return of Anubis, an ancient System Lord who was banished for his horrific crimes.  Also, we finally learn the origins of the Replicators.  Finally, SG-1 must endure a change that they never thought would happen in the episode ""Meridian"", and then, Anubis and Osirus (Anna-Louise Plowman) reveal plans to attack the Asgard.  But the most pivotal plot twist involves the new series-within-a-series, WORMHOLE X-TREME!!!  Just kidding.
This is a very important season, so despite its poor opening, I still reccomend it.  Just be ready to be underwhelmed by the first few episodes.  But after you get past those, enjoy!  Some good episodes include: ""Enemies"", ""Threshold"", ""Between Two Fires"", ""2001"", ""Wormhole X-Treme"", ""Proving Ground"", ""Summit"", ""Last Stand"", ""The Warrior"", ""Menace"", ""Meridian"", and ""Revelations"".",1083888000,17,2751,5.116331096196868
177546,5,1424819210,"This season its one of the best of this them good tv show. Its the one that Daniel Jackson acended to a higer plain of existence. I like all the episodes in this season. I have al the seasons that are on dvd,there is no greater tv show that this one",1079395200,2,249,3.9019607843137254
177547,4,1424819210,"Stargate SG-1's strength is its characters and humor. After two episodes, you really begin bonding with the SG-1 team and Air Force Gen. Hammond. Imagine a stargate buried under 28 levels in a highly fortified Cheyenne Mountain. Imagine stepping into the gate and going to any one of hundreds of planets where everyone happens to speak perfect 21st Century English. Talk about a universal language! (And some people wanted me to take Spanish!) Good writers could have used some creativity to get around this, but though all the aliens speak English, their written language is markedly different. On one planet the residents even had lapels and their jackets and those little holes on the left side (never knew what they were for).
But once you jump that yawning chasm of suspension of disbelief, SG-1's exploits are well written, though like most sci-fi episodes written around children, you have to take the lumps.
The price is right on this series and watching the beautiful Amanda Tapping alone is worth the price of admission. But the best part is, when we finally do travel to other worlds, we won't have to learn a new language.",1078617600,2,1134,4.880829015544041
177548,4,1424819210,"While there were several gems, I find most of this season lacking the flair and style seen in previous seasons. The cast seems rather tired in this season, almost defeated. They go through the paces, but seem to be grudgingly doing so. Episodes such as ""48 Hours"" and ""Failsafe"" only served to humiliate the cast and writers who, up to this season, seemed to pride themselves on original storylines.
Daniel's departure is handled adequately for his character in terms of how he is retired, but the story feels quite too sudden and contrived. His storyline is almost entirely forgotten by the next episode, especially in terms of the civilization he saved.
The remaining story lines depend too heavily on previous stories from as far back as season one. It was rumored that this would be the last season of the show, and the writers wanted to tie up the loose ends of the series. Fortunately (or unfortunately), the show wasn't canceled, leaving the cast with few allies or enemies. Because of this, the season finale feels weak and ultimately ends up being the worst yet.
Collectors should purchase this item to complete their set. Newcomers to the show may feel best skipping this season.",1078358400,16,1189,4.833333333333333
177549,3,1424819210,"I was hooked from the very first Stargate movie, which I have and I have collected every season so far. I must say that overall, I am pleased.
While the storyline is engrossing and the stargate makes for possibilities limited only by one' imagination, this series was not up to the usual standard.
The truth is that the first 3 or 4 episodes do not hold one's attention. They are in fact outright boring. Mind you there are some really nice episodes in this season and the sound is fantastic with great picture quality.
This series overall, was not as attention holding as the last one. The opening episode, which concluded the previous cliffhanger, was a disappointment. Much could have been done instead it seems to have been rushed to a conclusion.
Then we have the SG team bringing back a robot to SGC to almost cause doom. Really now. Why couldn't it have been studied somewhere else? Mysteriously, the Asgard [our Ally] who are usually at our heroes beck and call, were nowhere to be found.  I found this episode particularly illogical and irritating. The ultimate insult was Daniel Jackson's reaction at the end. Tears? I was disturbed to hear Dr. Daniel Jackson call Colonel O'Neill [ TWO l's] a SOB. Hey, I watch this show with my 5 year old who enjoys it immensely, the whole family does! This is supposed to be television! No need to sink to this level. Sad.
I suggest that whoever is writing the episodes, if they are out of ideas, do what Startrek did; ask the fans to submit ideas for the shows!
AT least the ending episode in this series was exciting with the possibilities.
Having said the TRUTH, the show is overall still very good. It is just that this season was not up to the usual HIGH standard that I have come to expect.
I look forward to the release of season 6!",1076889600,5,1786,4.512345679012346
177550,5,1424819210,"Star Gate had great episodes....exellent stories.....in it's 5th year.  My personal favorite was Proving Ground (SG1 the next gerneration)....It starred beautiful Grace Park (Edgemont/Battlestar Galactica 2003)..as one of the new team members.
Richard Dean Anderson ,Amanda Tapping,Christopher Judge and Michael Shanks....along with the beloved General Hammond (Don Davis)and Dr Fraiser (the lovely Teryl Rothery).....makes this series an outstanding journey. IMO one of the best Scfi series ever made...if not the best.",1075507200,4,520,6.323943661971831
177551,5,1424819210,"Although I totlly understand the awkwardness fans felt over Daniel Jackson's (Michael Shanks') departure and the impact it had on the show, I think that the most objective opinion still ranks Stargate SG-1, season 5 as some of the best TV out there.  Having said that, I had already grown fond of Jonas Quinn (Corin Nemec) in the role of Jackson's replacement on the SG-1 team by the middle of season 5.
Without giving away too much for those who haven't yet seen season 5, I would like to say that I think fans will like season 5 for the development of new metaphysical themes and the emergence of a major new bad guy to fill the vacuum left by Apophis.
The DVD set also comes with some pretty nice featurettes, including cast diaries, photo galleries, audio commentaries for each episode, and a ""tribute"", of sorts, for Daniel Jackson (which may turn out to be a little premature).
My copy of the DVD set also came with a complimentary copy of the premiere episode of  ""Jeremiah"", an apocalyptic sci-fi TV series, which appears to have just finished one or two seasons on cable.  I have yet to view it, but the price is right.  There was another neat little flier enclosed in the DVD case granting the owner to ""SG-1 bucks"" that may be redeemed at the online SG-1 store.  Maybe I'll get one of those neat ball caps or a pair of sunglasses the team wears when they're off-world...",1075507200,7,1381,4.508
177552,4,1424819210,"I haven't seen this set yet so I can't really judge the extra's except to say that if past history is any example they will be worth watching/ listening to. While it may be right that the season took a dark overall tone so many episodes stand out to me as being good television.
I kind of liked 2001, it's sort of a sequel to season 4's 2010 in that Stargate Command obeyed O'Neill's warning to stay away from a certain world coordinate and then inadvertently run into the Aschen anyway on another world. The biggest flaw in this story is that the primitive locals once had a written language, Welsh, which I don't think really existed until the 1870's or so. One of the high points was when SG-1 used the Stargate to turn the Aschen's own weappon against them.
Other good stories include Red Sky, Proving Ground (will any of the young recruits be in the new series Stargate Atlantis?),Summit, where Daniel Jackson runs into Osiris again, and Fail Safe. Fail Safe is sort of a take off on Armageddon or Deep Impact in that a huge asteroid is headed towards Earth and only SG-1 can stop it. They fly out in their Goa'uld cargo ship to blow the thing up but Carter discovers just in time that the thing is booby trapped by the Goa'uld in such a way as to escape detection by the Asgard, she out smarts them of course.
Wormhole X-treme! was intended to be a fun episode and pokes a lot of fun at the show and everyone & thing involved with it. I've seen it a few times and still haven't picked ot all of the inside jokes.",1075161600,2,1518,4.311188811188811
177553,5,1424819210,"I think you're right, Selune, Jonas Quinn's first appearance was Season 5 in  ""Meridian"".  Jonas is unable to return to his own people after he discloses that Daniel became irradiated when he stopped a chain reaction that would have  destroyed the planet.  For those who liked Daniel, there is a featurette about him on this DVD set.
The video is just as good as Season Four, and seeing SG-1 in widescreen anamorphic format is a dream.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 audio is great.  During some of the fights, I really feel as if I'm sitting right in the crossfire!
""Wormhole Extreme!"", which several have already mentioned is a tremendous episode, features cameo appearances by actual crew members as crew in the episode.  If  you're curious, here's the list:
David Sinclair, Prop master:  Bill the assistant director
Hank Cohen, MGM executive:  studio executive
Herbert Duncanson, stand-in for Christopher Judge:  Doug Anderson\Greel the Robot
Jan Newman in make-up:  make-up person
Joseph Mallozzi, supervising producer & writer:  crew member asking about doughnuts
Martin Wood, director:  NID man
Michael Greenburg & Brad Wright, executive producers:  in final walkaway
N. John Smith, co-executive producer:  second crew member asking about doughnut
Peter DeLuise:  director
Rick Dean, chief lighting tech:  crewman that doesn't like Teal'c food
Robert Cooper, executive producer & writer:  the writer
Ron Wilkerson, story editor:  in limo with Cohen
Extras:

=>""Inside the Tomb"" (6 minutes)  Peter DeLuise examines the episode and the set of ""The Tomb"".
=>Dr. Daniel Jackson - A Tribute (6 minutes)  Highlights from Dr. Jackson's time with SG program.
Wasn't there a Part 1 of 3 parts documentary ""Timeline to the Future"" on Season Four?  I would think that Part 2 would be on this DVD set and I don't see it.  I wonder if MGM/UA will follow up on this.  Otherwise, this SG-1 Season Five DVD set is great, highly recommended to any SG-1 fan.",1073952000,37,2207,5.123595505617978
177554,5,1424819210,"I agree with previous reviews that certain aspects of this season dragged a bit.  However, I can understand the trepidation with which this season was made and some of the stresses they may have been under.  Whatever the case, Stargate remains one of the best programs on television.  Even the worst episode of Stargate (and there aren't that many) beats anything else on TV at any given time.
One of the things I loved about this season was the introduction of Jonas (that was this season, right?).  I loved him back on Parker Lewis Can't Lose and thought it was great that he was back on television.  His part seems well scripted and the character has a wry humor that permeates each episode he is in.  I love Daniel, but I love the character of Jonas, too.  Not to mention, he's also easy on the eyes.  ;)
If anything, this entire box set is worth it for Wormhole X-Treme.  I love that episode so much.  The ending ""outtakes"" are just hilarious!!!  It's funny to see the Delouis (spelled?)brothers both goofing around.  Like the line ""but I'm getting paid real money, right?""  or something like that.  Priceless.
Stargate shows everyone that a science fiction show can be thought provoking and genuine in it's character development.  It will always be a standard to which other sci-fi shows strive to meet, in my opinion.
Anyway, take a look and enjoy.  Even if it isn't the best season, it's worth the price to get it.",1072137600,29,1422,4.605577689243028
177555,4,1424819210,"The 5th Season of Stargate was a solid, strong, team oriented season. When I watched it first on Showtime, I have to admit that I was a little disappointed but as I watched them again in repeats and then syndication, I found it to be a very well thought out season as a whole and find myself looking forward to the episodes in repeats on Sci-Fi.",1070668800,10,345,4.242424242424242
177556,5,1424819210,"I know this isn't everyone's opinion, but for me, each season gets better and better. Writers and actors get to know the characters and a story more when they've made over 100 episodes with them. (Episode 100 is included in this set, an episode where the writers just decide to mess around and have a good time)
Season 5 introduces some very key characters and situations:
--Colonol Frank Simmons
--Explanation of the ascended being (""Ascention"" and ""Meridian"")
--The jaffa rebellion (""The Warrior"")
--Further Russian entanglements including the fate of the Earth DHD (""48 Hours"")
--The introduction of Anubis (""Last Stand,"" ""Revelations"")
--The fate of the Tollan (""Between Two Fires"")
--The temperary departure of Michael Shanks (""Meridian"")
--The method of Asguard reproduction (""Revelations"")
--Jonas Quinn (""Meridian"")
All of these situations play key in the epic saga of the Stargate universe, providing for plot variations and new ideas in later seasons. The new ideas are still there. The humor is still there. Over 100 episodes in, Stargate is still going strong in this collection.
I am looking forward to adding this 5th boxed set to my other four boxed sets.
I enjoyed Season 6 even better. Season 7 is still blowing my mind. Let's have those as boxed sets soon as well.",1070668800,61,1282,5.109523809523809
177557,3,1424819210,"The first three seasons of Stargate are magic, the fourth one isn't quite as strong but still quite enjoyable, but this fifth season is mediocre overall.

Year-old reruns play in syndication, which is a different local channel in each city (including Fox in some places, but can also be found on CBS, UPN, etc.) Seasons 6 through 8 are on the Sci-Fi Channel, which took over first-run rights from Showtime. I'm not sure why we should ""be grateful"" to get episodes on DVD two years after the UK... but I'm buying season 5 anyway, because Stargate SG-1 is the best show on television!

177559,5,1424819210,"Wow! This Stargate Season really got to me. There are very few series that can risk so many changes (especially in one season) and keep the track of things without disappointments.
  This season sees the departure of a mayor character, the death (final death... mmm, 99.9% sure...) of the mayor big baddie of previous seasons, the annihilation of a powerful ally, politics and shades of grey, the rising of the new big bad nemesis of the series (in a very intelligent way), a lot of character development, conclusions to several story arcs of the past, interesting revelations and more...
  Perhaps what I most like about this season are the grate scripts (Brad Wright, Robert C. Cooper, Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie were awesome that year). After the grate cliff-hanger of Season 4, ""Enemies"" came to be one of the best season premieres I have ever had the pleasure to watch.
  The directing style improved greatly (more visual language, more depth in the approach and very good storytelling). Episodes like ""The Tomb"" (grate suspense), ""Threshold"" (one of Tealc's best), ""Between Two Fires"", the awesome, huge and perhaps best two parter of the series ""Summit"" and ""Last Stand"", and the amazing Season Finalie ""Revelations"" (script, directing, acting... everything at its best) which was the first season finalie of the series with no cliff-hanger, make of this season one of Sci-Fi and Television's best.
  I loved Anna-Louise Plowman (Osiris) in ""Revelations"", the introduction of Anubis, the way the System Lords were finally approached as a group, and the intelligent twists the season gave to the series.",1067472000,53,1614,5.110266159695818
177560,5,1424819210,"This has got to be one of the finest Biblical epics ever made by  Hollywood, back at a time when Christianity still got some respect by  Tinseltown.  It doesn't quite end up being one big soap opera like The Ten  Commandments sometimes seems.  A simple, yet powerful story of a man  falsely accused, wrongly convicted and who has one thing on his mind,  getting revenge on the ""friend"" who wrongfully imprisoned his  family.  Judah Ben-Hur gets the revenge he desired, but he doesn't gain a  sense of fullfillment.  His victory leaves him feeling ""empty""  and hollow.  What's amazing about this movie is that Christ is only  featured in a few scenes and has no dialog, but his mere presence has an  immense impact on the life of Judah Ben-Hur.  From a simple act of giving  him a drink of water (which gives him the desire to live) to the time of  the crucifixtion when the act is done in reverse.
Now that Warner  Brothers has acquired the rights to a good many of MGM's films, I wonder  when they'll get around to releasing a new digitally remastered version on  DVD.  That's the one film I'm waiting to add to my collection.",964569600,9,1127,4.502487562189055
