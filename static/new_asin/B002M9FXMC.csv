8373677,3,B002M9FXMC,"There is some great, classic footage here of Michael Jackson that spans his career, and so if one is looking for a nice video montage of his work, this will suffice. However, there are some unidentified commentators here who make comments that are very strange and seemingly uninformed. For example, someone dressed in what appears to be only an undershirt who says that Michael's music had ""not a misogynistic content, that would be too strong, but confrontational towards women"". What?! Yes, he sang about some underhanded women (eg., ""Dirty Diana"", ""Blood on the dance floor"") but with as many lovesongs as he sang and wrote, Jackson's music could hardly be seen as blanketly critical of women. Another person says that ""Billie Jean"" was the ""first glimpse into Michael Jackson's life-long paranoia"". So to say that some of the comments are a bit of a strentch would be an understatement. As was mentioned in another review, the second disk has some great audio content of Jackson interviews, but much of it can be found online as it is excerpted from videos widely found on Youtube and other sites.",1275696000,13,1102,4.898395721925134
8373678,3,B002M9FXMC,"I got these DVDs about two months ago, the first one everything is OK but the second DVD has no image. I can hear all the interviews but see nothing. Haw I do to return it and get another one OK ? Moderate quality; the chronology is a little messed . I would like so much to have one good biography of MJ that would show things happening in a chronologic manner, with the right images ( Say... things that happened in the time of ""Bad"" showing him as he was during that time...you know what I mean?)Well, comparing to some of the other DVD I acquired lately, this is moderate quality.",1275523200,,584,4.223214285714286
8373679,3,B002M9FXMC,"Although the quality of this product was excellent, the content was very disturbing to me. I am a huge fan of Michael Joseph Jackson and I felt the interviewers on disc #1 were biased in their critique of MJJ. #2 disc with the audio interview between MJJ and Oprah was heartfelt and touching.",1270425600,4,292,4.528301886792453

8373681,5,B002M9FXMC,"I learned what a great person he was. He loved everyone and they loved him. He gave alot of hisself to everyone . He gave over 300M to help people around the world as of 2006.he would save about 450 seats for children and there parents to see his concerts that could not aford them. Alot of his concerts, the money made off them went to help people. He was a very generous person. Myself I still miss him so much. There will never be another person like him again. His music will live on forever. I didn't get all this info. from the video. I learned alot from reading and there is alot on UTUBE to watch and learn. Everybody should check it out. He won about every award there is to get. You need to get a copy of his 30th anniv.video where he gets with his brothers ,I would recommend this, it was done at Madison Square Garden in 2001.thanks",1261267200,24,844,4.184049079754601
