8089313,5,B000BNKB1E,"If you have not used one of these balls then you need to, this video has some really nice exercises. Thanks",1360886400,,107,4.142857142857143
8089314,2,B000BNKB1E,"I purchased this last year. I did not like it because it was very slow paced, not energetic at all. The space it was filmed was like the corner of a room, and only the instructor and one assistant. how the cover looks is what you'll be viewing the whole time pretty much. i did the routine maybe two times at most and haven't done it since. i wanted to use my ball but ive stuck to regular pilates [my fav] and recently started beginners  bellydancing. if you want low impact ball exercise , more like yoga feel, then you might like it i guess.",1237507200,3,544,4.180952380952381
8089315,5,B000BNKB1E,"This is not a hard-core workout DVD, but a wonderful easy-to-follow overall routine. Amy Grant leads a well-paced workout when you're short on time and want an easy, fun workout. I like the balance ball workout because you really work your abs without even realizing it! You can either follow the beginner or intermediate routine provided on the DVD. There is some nice mellow music included with the routine.

I love her stretching DVD (Pilates for Flexibility) and this one is terrifice too. I use both DVDs over and over again and I can't wait to try her others! Check their website at pilatesforlife.ca",1237075200,,606,4.826923076923077
8089316,1,B000BNKB1E,I don't often rate things poorly; however this item should not be sold. As a fitness expert this is an insult.,1220313600,,110,4.285714285714286
8089317,1,B000BNKB1E,"I struggle to find anything positive to say about this DVD: it is way too short, it allegedly offers two levels of difficulties but having tried both I could not tell the difference (same exercises, minor changes); it keeps moving you from a standing up position to an horizontal one (laying on the mat), then it gets you to sit up, then laying down again, wasting a lot of time and not concentrating on any particular group of muscle. At the end of it I did not feel like I worked out, I did not feel like I learn any new movements nor any challenging ones. I would not recommend this DVD and neither would I buy any more from the series.",1193443200,3,639,4.245901639344262
8089318,3,B000BNKB1E,"Overall this a good alternative to other exercise/pilates dvds. The exercises performed are different than typical, and the ball makes them more challenging - even for fairly experienced practioners. The 20 minutes is a bit too short to feel like you accomplish much though, with slow transitions between moves and an overall slow pace.",1151366400,7,336,5.2407407407407405
8089319,2,B000BNKB1E,"That was the quickest 20 minutes and I didn't feel like I had done anything. I followed the beginners workout but had a hard time following correct positioning. They moved through the workout rapidly, too rapidly, with almost no set up of the poses. Spend a little more and try something else.",1149552000,8,293,4.653846153846154
