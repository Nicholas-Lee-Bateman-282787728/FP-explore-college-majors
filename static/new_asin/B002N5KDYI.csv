3955312,5,B002N5KDYI,"I certainly can't comment from the 'inside' as customer reviewer Linda McDougall does -- read her review! -- but I wanted to add my unreserved enthusiasm for this DVD. Ever since conductor Gustavo Dudamel exploded onto the international classical music scene there has been mounting curiosity and interest about El Sistema and its founder Jos Antonio Abreu. This documentary, lovingly made by one of the best music documentarians, Paul Smaczny, and his partner Maria Stodtmeier, shows us from the ground up how El Sistema works. It takes us inside the homes, rehearsal rooms and the very lives of the children who are involved in learning to play music via the program and mostly in their own words shows us what a powerful force the program is. There are many clips of Abreu explaining his concepts about the importance of music in the lives of the children, not just for the explicit purpose of learning to play an instrument but also for how it teaches cooperation and discipline. The children themselves are marvelous ambassadors for the program because we can see how it alters their lives in positive ways.

I enthusiastically recommend the DVD to anyone who loves classical music, to anyone who despairs about the future of classical music, and to anyone who might some day have input themselves into the similar programs that are now popping up all over the world.

Running time: 100minutes, plus a 9min bonus about auditioning for the Simn Bolivar Youth Orchestra; Format NSC 16:9; Sound: PCM Stereo, DD 5.1, DTS 5.1; Documentary is in Spanish with subtitles in English, German, French and Spanish; Region Code: 0 (worldwide)

3955314,5,B002N5KDYI,"Hasta el momento no he visto el documental, pero por los realizadores y los msicos que se hay detrs del proceso vale la pena conocer su contenido. No hay duda que un crtico desprevenido pueda confundir el exito del ""sistema"" con propaganda poltica del gobierno actual de Venezuela, pero debo advertir que este proceso se inici en 1975 gracias a la posibilidad que tuvo Jos Antonio Abreu  para construir una utopia que pretende, por medio de la msica, hacer una labor social con la juventud venezolana. Es cierto que el gobierno de Venezuela subvenciona con varios millones de dlares el programa de la ""orquesta"", pero ya han sido cinco o seis gobiernos sucesivos de diferentes tendencias al actual los que han estado aportando para que los jvenes venezolanos hagan msica, aficionada y an profesional, en lugar de dedicar su tiempo a otras actividades diferentes a la delincuencia pues los participantes son especialmente de los sectores ms pobres de Venezuela.
Sera conveniente contrastar este documental con otros de similar ndole que ya se encuentran en el mercado en DVD.",1256256000,,1074,5.033707865168539
3955315,5,B002N5KDYI,"I reported as abusive, the comment made by an angry person who has no idea of the importance of this film. Paul Smaczny very kindly sent me a copy of the DVD months ago, as here in Mexico, we're starting the program using the El Sistema model.
Rather than give a review, I can only urge those who may have already seen Tocar y Luchar, have heard or seen Gustavo Dudamel, or have read about the genius of Jos Antonio Abreu, founder of El Sistema, to buy and absorb this most excellent documentary. This model for the entire planet has been captured poetically and beautifully by EuroArts' Maria Stodmeier and Paul Smaczny, already a great master at producing classical music videos.
But the real stars are the children, who speak like old souls...who see the importance of being a member of an orchestra as life's most spiritual lesson.
That the project has rescued thousands of underprivileged children from a hopeless life, has produced Gustavo Dudamel and the Simn Bolvar Youth Orchestra, to mention only a few of many talented musicians, utterly discounts any negativity those with an axe to grind might have.
I have showed this documentary to many friends, and the reaction has been the same: when and where can we buy it? Now you can...and order it NOW, before it gets sold out. The world is watching.",1256256000,8,1306,4.707423580786026
3955316,5,B002N5KDYI,"As I am in the music field in Mexico,trying with others to make the same project work here, I was able to see this extraordinary documentary several months ago. It was a private showing, and almost the entire audience, friends,maestros, musicians, were weeping through it - deeply moved and filled with hope.
They'd already seen or owned ""Tocar y Luchar"", the first beautiful film on El Sistema, but now Maria Stodmeier and Paul Smaczny have gone deeper, and have captured what is beyond words. Their general response of unmitigated admiration for El Sistema's founder, Jos&eacute; Antonio Abreu whom Claudio Abbado calls ""a saint"".
And now, when you see what musicians, such as the true ambassador Gustavo Dudamel,the Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var Orchestra, to mention just a few, have emerged from the project,you'll marvel at why it took more than thirty years for us in North America to catch on.

El Sistema has expanded since the first film exposure, and to me, part of the miracle is
how children play as if they were adults - no passage of time seems present. Their dedication - theirs and that of the teachers and staff who work with Abreu - is almost surreal. Where did all these old souls in children's bodies come from? Is this what happens when they're given a chance to experience classical music? When you listen to their wisdom, so beautifully reflected in the many levels of the project, you'll probably be speechless. And hopeful.

There's a great deal more to say about this remarkable documentary which I hope anyone with the least interest in changing the world, orders sight unseen. Paul Smaczny of EuroArts, who has produced the world's finest concert films on DVD, together with the brilliantly sensitive Maria Stodmeier, have done us all a great favour.
I thank them a thousand times over...and when you see some of the little touches - such as a hawk slowly hovering over dense and sprawling Caracas, free and soaring on the wind -
you'll understand the spiritual message of the film far beyond words.",1254873600,34,2026,4.903790087463557
3955317,5,B002N5KDYI,"I saw this film last night on Ovation television and I am buying the film now for my son and my two granddaughters to watch.  It is awe-inspiring and a teaching instrument for adults that think they know about education.
I am amazad at the way classical orchestral training for untutored, uneducated, poor, hopeless children can lift these same children into the realms of spiritual betterment, professional quality instrument playing and the way to a better life.  Some of the children are already traveling going to other countries to play in orchestras.
Superb.",1254700800,21,564,5.053763440860215
3955318,5,B002N5KDYI,Wonderful Film about El Sistema!,1435968000,,32,5.6
3955319,5,B002N5KDYI,This a documentary about giving the poorest children in Venezuela a chance to experience playing an instrument.  It's heart warming and inspirational.  Playing music keeps the children off the street and gives them skills that will last a life time.  El Sistema hopes that children who go through the program will give the children the smarts to avoid the dangers of the streets.,1433635200,,379,4.984126984126984

3955322,5,B002N5KDYI,"Wonderful responce from children to this fantastic program. It will bring you to tears of joy. At the same time, it is the best social work, delinquency prevention, child socializing, ego enhansing, family centered, crime prevention program I've ever seen. It should be of great interest to not only music lovers but to educators, social workers and the public in general.

A MUST SEE VIDEO FOR ALL!!!",1402444800,,401,4.985074626865671
3955323,5,B002N5KDYI,"During tight budget times, the arts is often one of the first programs to be reduced.  Rather, this film causes us to rethink the role of the arts in young learner's lives.  It has the power to change children and give them hope and opportunity in the face of incredible odds.",1402358400,,276,4.392156862745098
3955324,5,B002N5KDYI,This documents a fantastic program for creating an environment for youth to see an alternate world of choices. Music is used to bring together and educate indigent children and instill hope and offer a way to strive for their dreams.,1394668800,,233,4.85
3955325,5,B002N5KDYI,"El Sistema is a music training program for school children in Venezuela.  This is a fine film.  I saw it using the English subtitles.  The depth of unrelieved poverty in Venezuela is overwhelming, but one man had the vision to see a way to change the lives of children despite the obvious difficulties.  He places music schools into the worst neighborhoods, and these schools foster self-respect and self-reliance.  They give children a safe place to be.  There may be some places in this country where children get caught in gun fire every day, but this seems common place in the barios.  The children are taught to play with feeling, even when their skills are not yet developed.  It is clear that love drives this program; love of music and love of children, and with it comes joy.
You don't have to like classical music to be moved and inspired by this movie.",1394409600,,863,4.631578947368421

3955327,5,B002N5KDYI,"If not, why not? Venezuela is not a rich country, but they can find the money to fund youth orchestras. Their system works. It appears that we have different priorities such as letting large companies escape taxes by hiding their wealth in overseas banks and allowing giant banks to gamble on  our  housing market. Look at the smiles on the faces of these Venezuelan children. Our children could be smiling too.",1367452800,4,411,4.774647887323944

3955329,3,B002N5KDYI,"I saw the earlier inspiring and thrilling video Tocar y Luchar, and read a review that the more recent El Sistema was even better.
