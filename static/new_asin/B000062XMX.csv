Just like you wouldn't buy clothes you knew were made by child slaves, you won't want to buy these videos knowing that the people who made them are well known pedophiles. And ultimately the people most befitting from the sale of them are the Cult leaders themselves. All this information is well documented and easy to find with a quick google search",1457395200,,592,4.647619047619048

8532100,5,B000062XMX,What a wonderful family video! Although this video is marketed to children 7 and under I think older children would also enjoy it. My husband and I watched it with our daughters (2 and 4 years old) and it provided a wonderful opprotunity to discuss biblical truths. It was easy to understand and my daughters love the uplifting songs. I would highly recommend this video as a gift for a special child in your life.,1017619200,,414,4.533333333333333
