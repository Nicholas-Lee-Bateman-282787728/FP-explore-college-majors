The great cinematography, the full range of colors, the beautiful locations for filming and the ful palette of colors in the scenery. The action, the romance, the drama, and of course, the fact that they still love heroes in India.
They still love romance, good triumphant over evil.",1507766400,,330,4.910714285714286

8666517,5,B00LM037NY,"reat movie. Akshay Kumar is such a wonderful actor (and so handsome too) !  He is highly trained in martial arts and doesn't use a double in his action shots. Akshay Kumar loves his country and is very patriotic. He had spoken openly against  terrorists. India's terrorists is Pakistan which is the subject of this movie. So besides being a wonderful movie with its light - hearted  moments, it's also a very serious movie.  I've not understood how. ""sleeper cells"" worked.  This movie explains how they operate and how merciless they are. The USA needs this knowledge as well as India does. When this movie is over you have been highly entertained.(Mr.  Kumar is also a fantastic singer and dancer.) You have also been week educated about terrorists sleeper cells. If you are like me and can't speak the Hindi language,  the closed captions are great !! Mr.  Kumar is well educated in English and it is spoken some throughout the Movie.",1478217600,,937,4.7407407407407405

8666522,4,B00LM037NY,"Akshay Kumar is a performer who keeps on getting better with every film. His self inflicted tragedy is that he was never considered a worthy star yet his star shines the brightest when you compare the other Khans with his success ratio. I say this because Akshay Kumar has a average of three or four films every year and almost all of them make money, meanwhile the Khans only release one. Just think about who is the real star.
A.R. Murgadoss who delivers prolific hits in the Southern movie Industry was also responsible for the first 100 crore film with Ghajini. He had directed the original Holiday ( Thuppaki) which  was a blockbuster and here he teams up with Akshay Kumar to deliver the remake in Hindi.
Virat Bakshi, an army man is on a holiday in Mumbai, when he is caught in the midst of a terrorist plot. The suspect is caught and it is revealed that he is part of a sleeper cell, who are going to create mayhem. Virat's holiday thus becomes a mission to stop this impeding attack on the city of Mumbai. There are many twists throughout the movie and although the romantic angle and songs appear regularly- the movie is not boring.
Akshay Kumar is always dependable and in character. Sonakshi Sinha and Govinda are wasted.
The main terrorist is shown as educated and does not have a back story that reveals his intention for becoming a terrorist.
It could have used tighter editing and despite flaws it is still a watch.",1417478400,2,1431,4.546511627906977
8666523,5,B00LM037NY,"This is actually a very good movie. There are some comic moments, but it gets pretty intense in other areas...it has a lot of action in it as well...the movie is subtitled in English, since this is a Bollywood film from India...the soundtrack is pretty awesome too...Without giving a spoiler, the film touches on issues that are current in the world today...one being the sleeper cells in terrorism...I would recommend it to someone to watch...:)",1417132800,,446,4.96
8666524,3,B00LM037NY,"Holiday: A Soldier is Never Off Duty is a cool title. As a movie it's got me torn. It's got stuff to recommend it but also things that seriously bug me. It's cool that Akshay's stepped away some from his lame-ass comedies, even if it's a temporary respite. Comic calamities like Action Replayy (2010), Thank You (2011), Joker (2012), and the Housefull series pissed me off so bad I soured on Bollywood for a bit. But then Special 26 (2013) got me back on the Akshay Kumar train. And now here's Holiday with its split personality disorder.

Let me break down the first half hour which is a comic dud. Akshay is Virat Bakshi, a captain in the Indian Army. We see him disembark from the train on his annual leave to Mumbai. At the station Virat's family greets him, and, because of the auspiciousness of the hour, he's rushed to the home of Saiba Thapar (Sonakshi Sinha), his intended bride. However, Virat isn't taken with Saiba, thinking her too demure and traditional for his type. He breaks off the arranged marriage. But then he learns that Saiba is actually a modern girl. In fact, she boxes for her university and excels in other sports. So now Virat is smitten, and now it's Saiba's turn to reject him. The first half hour unravels the hackneyed flirtation between the two, and I kept trying to stifle a yawn.

What's up with Sonakshi Sinha, so good in Lootera, wasted in Holiday? In a film that espouses heavy drama and tension, she's marginalized as the love interest and the comic foil. She's barely relevant to the story. As much as I like her, the movie would've been better served had it excised all her scenes so as to maintain a more even-keeled tone. But I did like her cupboard scene.

Half an hour into it, the core plot kicks off. Virat and his cop buddy Makiya (Sumeet Raghavan) are on a bus when they sniff out a bomber. Virat is not only an Army commando, he's also secretly part of the Defense Intelligence Agency, meaning that counterterrorism is very much in his wheelhouse. Sifting thru fragmented clues Virat is able to suss out the next terrorist attack in Mumbai. His investigation draws the ire of the head (Freddy Daruwala) of the sleeper cell network, and cue the cat and mouse games.

Maybe this is a good place to mention that Govinda has a brief supporting role. He plays Virat's superior officer, and plays him for laughs. Too bad, I was hoping to see Govinda in combat. His scenes with Akshay - who, whenever he sees Govinda, snaps to attention and stiffly salutes - made me laugh.

It's good to see that Akshay is still one of Bollywood's best action stars. When he's on his game, he really can do it all: act, be funny, dance, and fight. The action sequences are ridiculous but dynamite stuff. Another cool thing about Akshay is that he performs as many of the stunts as he can, and that always adds an authentic touch. No, son, the problem isn't the action.

***Some SPOILERS from here on out***

Sometimes the dramatic and comic elements merge into a jarring masala. A few times, it works. It's ridiculous but I get the giggles at Virat's habit of stuffing his captured terrorists into his bedroom cupboard. Later, there's a really funny payoff that includes Saiba and the cop friend.

Virat is one of those peacekeepers that are so gung-ho they alarm me. As embodied by Virat, writer/director A.R. Murugadoss seems to be pushing an agenda, and that's fine. He stresses the common man's duty to his country and that civilians should also contribute in the war against terrorism, and I'm down with that. What grates me is that Virat is so cocksure a patriot he's willing to jeopardize his sister's life to nab the head terrorist. He unearths a plot to abduct five female relatives of soldiers who may have thwarted the sleeper cells, and, as bait, he sends his unwitting sister to replace one of the targeted girls! That is seriously messed up. And when he successfully pulls off the rescue mission, and his sister is taking him to task, he looks at her and asks: ""Can't you civilians sacrifice your lives? Should only military and cops sacrifice theirs?"" And maybe he has a point. He'd lost me already. Love his fight scenes, hating on his hubris, hating on how cavalier he is with other people's lives.

That was my biggest problem with the movie. Other things that nagged at me:

- Other than Virat, there is no character development
- The way Virat turns wedding revelers into an impromptu anti-terrorist squad
- Twelve men in suits crammed in one vehicle following a suspect who is on foot... c'mon, now
- Freddy Daruwala, master of the one vacant expression
- Freddy Daruwala's detective methods in figuring out who foiled his attacks are so absurd even Inspector Clouseau is laughing at him
- It's alarming that a Mumbai cop had to be told what a sleeper cell was

So, I like bits of Holiday, detest other bits. I think I enjoyed it for the most part. It's an action-packed thriller with not much let up, never minding Sonakshi's light intrusions. Maybe you should see it. See if you agree or disagree with me. It's still better than a good chunk of what Akshay's been releasing the past decade.

The DVD's bonus stuff:

- The Making Of Holiday (00:11:57 minutes, no English sub-titles but there are smatterings of spoken English)
- Making of the Songs (00:11:28 minutes, no English sub-titles but with smatterings of spoken English)",1409443200,3,5378,4.630640083945435
