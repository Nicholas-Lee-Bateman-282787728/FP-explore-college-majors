8088749,2,B000BM7Z0U,"Very disappointing video.  In my opinion, this video is misnamed as it really doesn't teach any of the fundamentals of rockabilly style and seems to assume you're already accomplished with basic finger-picking technique.  The Brian Setzer section is pretty much useless.",1241308800,3,270,5.560975609756097
8088750,2,B000BM7Z0U,"This DVD is sort of a disappointment, primarily due to its very short running time - 1/2 hour.  The material presented by each guitarist is very brief, with the James Burton and Brian Setzer segments being the longest.  It is not really coherent.  I think Hot Licks could have pulled a lot more material together and made a better product.

What is presented is just too short and lacks any type of context.",1169164800,7,407,4.534246575342466
8088751,4,B000BM7Z0U,"I just got the DVD and was first impressed on how quickly I got the package from the time I ordered it.  The DVD is great for inspiring to play better, and that's why I ordered it.  It has a great introduction and I would have liked to have each segment a bit longer and more in depth, but whatcha gonna do?  The only problem I saw was the camera angles were not the same on the instructors and I wanted to have a better view of what was going on.  It also claims that there is ""Slow motion segments with standard pitch sound"".  Not on my player!  There was nothing listed in the menu for slo-mo, and my DVD player doesn't have sound when I'm doing that, so I don't know where they get that selection from.  THAT would have been cool to witness, but pausing the DVD each frame is still hard to see where the dudes fingers are exactly.  Also listed ""Artist biographies"", and ""suggested listening"".  Couldn't find anything like that on the menu either.  James Burton had the only segment where he broke down the solo's on several songs.  Brian Setzer was a hoot to watch, but it wasn't very instructional in my opinion.  He mostly concentrated on fancy fills that were way too fast for me to pick up on without the aid of the ""slow motion"" listed.  Just my two cents worth.  I have no regrets on the purchase and will do the best I can with what I have.  Joe",1156982400,5,1356,4.221789883268483
