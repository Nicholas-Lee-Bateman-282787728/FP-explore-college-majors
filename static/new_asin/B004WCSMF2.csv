4486269,3,B004WCSMF2,"I'm not a film student or anything, but I just felt it was missing something. I love the horror genre.. movies.. books and after reading the reviews I was expecting something more.

The concept was interesting, can't say that the whole don't invite strangers into your house thing hasn't be done before.. but at least there were more twists to it than normally seen. I don't think this movie had any real suspense moments where Im looking through my fingers to see whats going to happen next.. it just kind of is what it is.. you think something is going to happen and you are mostly right.

Maybe I missed something, but I was slightly confused as to one of the characters. Didn't really explain anything and you are just left thinking.. ok whats the deal? Or maybe it was so deep in meaning I missed it entirely. HAHA you never know.

I say its worth the watch for something unique, but don't expect too much.",1303603200,12,911,4.475903614457831
4486270,5,B004WCSMF2,"This film reminded me of a *Barack Obama* speech (insert Ronald Regan for you righties), you're with him for his long winded start, slightly impatient, then all of sudden you're on your feet cheering with no recollection of how you got to your feet or when you started hooting like a teenage girl front row at a Justin Bieber concert; the film definitively crescendo's. Nick's accent drove me nuts throughout the whole thing, this morning I can't get his damn voice outta my head. He's like a southern HAL from 2001, and now HAL's in my head too.

It's always nice to see a green director on a shoe string budget with a handful of actors (of varying talent) put out a film that can hold it's own with the heavy weight CGI multi-million dollar crapfests they call horror these days. Reminded me of the early work of some of todays heavy hitters in the asian horror markets. Cerebral horror at it's finest, worth the watch.",1303516800,9,921,4.548192771084337
4486271,5,B004WCSMF2,Yay! A horror movie that isn't overwrought. It was brutal and beautifully serene at the same time if that's possible. It was haunting and mysterious and pretty damn ruthless. It'll be a few days before i'll be able to walk through my house at night without being creeped out.,1303430400,10,275,4.63265306122449
4486272,5,B004WCSMF2,This is definitely not your tradition horror film--but in a good way. It takes a while to get going but once it does it really starts to move. It's not traditional in the sense that it's more dialogue driven but it helps add to the creep factor with the lead character. Basically all unknown actors but that doesn't really matter once you get into the characters. MUSIC IS AWESOME! Felt like something out of Shinning--can't wait for the soundtrack!,1303344000,5,449,4.69620253164557
4486273,2,B004WCSMF2,"This review has spoilers. So glad I didn't pay to rent this movie. I am a Prime member and clicked on this because the description sounded interesting. The acting was good but the story was horrible. Who wants to watch a bunch of unlikable characters get killed. There was no depth to any of them. What I really didn't get was how the main villain is supposedly killing as a form justice, but near the end he is not only willing to let a girl who killed an entire family live but he wants to train her and even help her kill an innocent person. It was stupid.",1418601600,,559,4.185185185185185

The mother of this family has guarded her family incredibly closely because of a terrible secret, but for some unfathomable reason she just let's this guy into her house!  He was not charming or likeable, at all.  He didn't say anything creative enough convince me he needed to get int o the house.

4486300,4,B004WCSMF2,"I really enjoyed this little gem of a movie.  I thought the production, direction, story, special effects and the acting were all very well done.  The characters were interesting, there were some surprises along the way that kept me interested all the way through.  It was a little slow in some places but nothing to complain about.  I really like the character of Gloria and wish that they would do something to follow up with her.",1402963200,,432,4.644736842105263

4486302,2,B004WCSMF2,"The actors put on convincing performances but the movie never made it clear what they were trying to convince me of.  There's a minor whodunit about somebody's house catching on fire, a little gore (the rest of the gore is inferred) and a bunch of unlikeable people getting murdered for no clear reason.  The movie would have been easier to follow with a hero character but by the end, the 'hero' is obviously a sadistic psychopath who just lost the only thing holding them back from going on a multistate murder spree.  What was all of this, anyway?",1401062400,,550,4.591836734693878
4486303,2,B004WCSMF2,"It's frustrating to see such talented actors working in a film like this. It has an interesting enough premise, but the villain's ""process"" makes little sense, other than to create some repulsive film footage. And there are turning points that depend on stupidity -- which is always the death knell for a suspenseful film. I give it two stars for the performances and the quality of the filmmaking. But the story is not worth the time.",1400803200,,435,4.7368421052631575

4486307,3,B004WCSMF2,"While I will not post a synopsis here as it has been done already I will say that this movie was a good afternoon watch.  Not a horror film in an Exorcist way but interesting enough to make a person pause and think of the retribution of good and evil.

4486309,3,B004WCSMF2,"Decent effort and there is something about an evil southerner that just strikes a chord with me, but this wants to be deeper and darker than it actually is.

4486314,2,B004WCSMF2,"The movie reeked of gore and predictability.

4486317,1,B004WCSMF2,Ok the story starts out great! But then after the opening credits it starts to get boring. 30 seconds after that it was like taking a sleeping pill with a vodka chaser... I must still be sleeping because work is better than watching this movie.,1373414400,,244,4.444444444444445

4486319,5,B004WCSMF2,"My daughter says:

The key to this film is to go in blind...don't read reviews (I know...) and forget the blurb on the box or the website, disregard the cover art, and know that even the film title is awkward.

4486321,1,B004WCSMF2,"I can't give you a critique on more than half an hour of this film.  I fell asleep the first two times I tried to watch it and simply gave up the third time.  This felt like a bunch of very inebriated college kids got together and talked a friend's' parents into making a movie.
There isn't one positive thing I can say about this.  My favorite genre is a good haunted house movie.  Can't beat it, if it has a good storyline.  The scenes they chose for previews are absolutely the only good ones done.
Please, please give this a pass.  If I could ask for a refund and ""unsee"" what I saw, I would happily do that!",1367625600,,612,4.100840336134453
4486322,5,B004WCSMF2,"I had never even heard of this movie, but since I love horror, I thought I'd try it. It is by far, one of the best horror/thriller movies I've seen. A lot of unexpected things happening, and pulls it all together at the end. Just wonder if she will be blamed and where she will go????",1367020800,,284,4.089285714285714

4486326,1,B004WCSMF2,"I'm sorry, but this movie was awful. The plot was thin and made little sense, the acting was bush league and the gore was just kind of standard slasher movie fare. Nothing interesting or suspenseful about it. Most of the characters behaved unrealistically and the dialogue was cheesy in a way that made the film suffer. The main villain (although his accent is pathetic) does start out seeming fairly interesting and then just becomes another one of those vague, mysterious types that are so played out. This seems like a student film which is not a selling point. Good thing I didn't have to pay to watch this.

I will say the woman who played the son's girlfriend was the best thing about the movie. This is not really a spoiler for anyone who still wants to watch this tripe but seriously, DON'T BOTHER. Not if you're looking for a true suspense/horror film.",1363132800,,861,4.627450980392157

4486330,5,B004WCSMF2,"I found this one fantastic on many levels, even with an amazingly high degree of predictability.  Main thing that sticks with me after the the credits rolled was the characters. Patrick Breen was indeed excellent in his role, spinning out some homespun yarns even as he partook in his evil mischief. The air of gloom and foreboding hung around for the whole movie, which is what bought me to it in the first place.  It was not heavy on the gore which was fine with me, I was not looking for splatter for splatters sake. But the violence was implied and it was there, though I am sure some may find it more camy than chilling.

  Yeah, there was quite the level of predictabilty. I ran a perfect score on who I thought was going to make it out of the movie alive and who would be left on the ground, as I think most viewers would. But hey, predictable is not always bad, meaningless swerves can screw up a story. As others have already attested the plot was not just unrealistic at times, it was unrealistically unrealistic.  Not even people dressed as cops for Halloween act less like cops than the cops did in this movie. Chances to escape were not met with all too much urgency throughout the film. I suppose the characters had seen too many films where they just didn't work.

  As to the ending, I would have ended it a different way but I didn't write the thing, and I am leaving this with a 5 star review so it all wrapped up just fine in retrospect.

  I do have a quibble however!  At one point a Brewers game was on, and the announcer clearly stated an outfielder was shielding his eyes from the sun camping under a fly. As this scene was taking place at night I got grumpy. I suppose the Brewers could have been playing on the West Coast but I am still surly over that continuity flub.

  Overall I really liked this film. While the plot would not bring me back again per se I would watch it again simply for the creep factor but mostly for the sterling characterizations.  Job well done.",1362441600,,1998,4.327956989247312

4486332,4,B004WCSMF2,"Basic elements of a formulaic horror film are well-established at the beginning: family's troubled past, mysterious stranger on the doorstep, etc. But as one storyline unfolds more or less predictably, another much less predictable one is also unfolding, with the potential to derail everything including our assumptions. A sequel to this film would be fascinating!",1361836800,,365,5.654545454545454
4486333,5,B004WCSMF2,"The message this movie has to say isn't voiced in a scream such as House of 1000 Corpses or Halloween.  It's not normal speak like The Fog or In The Mouth Of Madness.  It's more like a whisper.  The movie moves it's bleeding lips up to your quivering ear and mutters the words, ""people are so screwed up not even the director knows why.""  ""Sorry no answers here"" the movie's message declares as it reveals the deranged within our homes, and without.  It offers no clear cut ending or explanations because like life sometimes there aren't any.  We as Americans in a decaying society must take the bad with the worse and move on to more terrible things rarely ever knowing why.  We rush to the grave but hurry to the doctor's office first and never resolute as to which we'd rather go to first. It's this indifference, confusion, and double-minded insanity that takes shape in a few of the myriad of characters displayed in the film.

This movie has alot to say if you listen very close to the message such as the condition of the United States as well as the condition of the American family, The American town, and our collective over-infatuation with things that are none of our business.  It also peeks into the complicated room called religion and explores how far we can take it before religion becomes poison.

Look, there are two ways you can take this film.  One is super-serious as if it were the holy grail of movies.  If you do that you won't be happy, there's no way.  Finally, you can view this snippet of celluloid as you would a thesis on the opinions of one or two in your class which is pay attention but don't lose any sleep over it.

If you expect The Bleeding House to be as action oriented as The Devil's Rejects or Event Horizon you'll be disappointed.  The message here is king. Since I am someone who doesn't particularly like movies that hold my hand and treat me as if I had the intelligence of something running around in a zoo cage, it's refreshing to get some cerebral meat on my plate.",1360627200,,2014,4.449591280653951

4486335,2,B004WCSMF2,"Not as bad as some folks are making it out to be.  I was afraid it would be full of splattering blood and gore, and surprisingly it is not.  But it is very predictable.  The viewer knows what's coming long before the movie gets to its point.",1348617600,,241,4.085106382978723
4486336,3,B004WCSMF2,"A deliciously evil performance from Patrick Breen as a psychotic serial killer elevates this grim Indie.
Breen exudes a chilling charm as a mysterious stranger who insinuates himself into a deeply disturbed family with dark secrets of their own.  Alexandra Chando plays ""Blackbird"", the strange teen who seems more than slightly off center.  We soon learn Blackbird is more than a match for her captor.
BLEEDING HOUSE deserves credit for a novel approach to the serial killer genre but I felt somewhat cheated by its ambiguous climax.  However, Breen--who I remember from guest roles on LAW AND ORDER and THE GOOD WIFE--should definitely garner bigger roles in the future.",1322006400,9,672,5.146788990825688
4486337,1,B004WCSMF2,"You must be pretty cool if you can go around bashing people's skulls in and stabbing torsos multiple times without flinching, especially if you're an underage emo bug collector. One could say that, like Wednesday Addams or Lisa Simpson, young, goth-crowd-pandering Gloria marches to the beat of her own drummer, except that marching implies assimilation. And assimilation is for fascists and liberals.

So like I was saying, the only type of people worth paying attention to these days are serial killers. So it's fitting that this is a movie about serial killers. In fact, I know it's past deadline and who doesn't like pizza? ... but I just think if the Republicans had sponsored a serial killer in the upcoming presidential race, this would be a done deal. It takes a passionate man -- or woman -- with steely ideals to kill people over and over again. And passion is how I make all my important decisions.

These days, it really does take a serial killer able to employ various shades of emotions for me to be able to empathize with anything happening on the screen or in real life -- that and videos of newborn puppies. How did that little feller squeeze his way out of that little tube? That's too cute!!",1320537600,,1210,4.676056338028169

4486339,5,B004WCSMF2,"In THE BLEEDING HOUSE, the Smith family is visited by a mysterious stranger (Patrick Breen). As the story unfolds, we realize that there's much more going on than a simple overnight stay. The man that the Smiths have allowed into their home has a strange and lethal agenda. TBH boils down to a battle of eeevil vs. eeevil w/ some fantastic dialogue (especially from Breen's character) and an overall atmosphere of doom. Alexandra Chando is quite good as the teen daughter w/ a head-full of dark secrets of her own. Great stuff!...",1313798400,7,530,4.771739130434782
4486340,4,B004WCSMF2,"After reading the reviews for this movie that both seemed to be at completely opposite ends of the spectrum of great and horrible, I decided to check this one out for myself. The movie had some good scares once the pace picked up after a slow start. This is not your typical ""Dont invite strangers in"" story, as it has a little twist to it. This family has a deeply troubled past that involves the family's daughter killing every member of a neighboring household and setting their house on fire. Then a completely insane stranger whom has killed many people all over the country in the exactsame way and has somehow managed to not attract and law enforcement attention, and can appearently kill two armed cops with a shotgun during a firefight in which he  didn't really take them by surprise. This stranger takes a fancy to the murderous daughter as he sees that they have something in common. Then in a battle of who is crazier than who the daughter wins out claiming that she kills because she likes it. If you want the entire story, watch the film for yourself. It is a pretty unorthodox story with less than believeable characters. But like I said, its got good scares, but expect plotholes and a pretty unrealistic story.",1307318400,2,1228,4.607305936073059
4486341,1,B004WCSMF2,We've seen it before. A mysterious stranger arrives at your house and asks to stay the night. What do you do? Ok - add this: you and your family have a terrible secret and you need desperately to keep yourselves isolated from everyone and everything and a mysterious stranger arrives at your house and asks to stay the night. What do you do? Or this: You're a horror fan and your best friend writes a gruelingly bad script and asks your opinion on it. Do you let him raise thousands of dollars and shoot the film or do you tell him the truth? It stinks. Try again. Awful.,1303948800,7,571,4.296296296296297
4486342,1,B004WCSMF2,"This film was Midwest torture porn crap. Go see Scream 4 if you want to see something that actually resembles a slasher film. The message of anti-USA, fear the apathetic youth of America is obtuse and a snore. The directing is decent, cuts are really off and acting is uneven. After a decade of SAWS and HOSTELS... can't we be more creative than tying people up in chairs?",1303862400,8,372,4.485294117647059
