5402003,5,B00AA0BTW8,"for the experienced beginner to intermediate. it does take work to complete the dvd. i wished it was a bit longer, once you master the moves, you want more.  working with the chair keeps both legs activated......the AB section was very good, definately felt it the next day.......i will be looking into buying the other dvd's in the set. very pleased.",1375142400,5,351,4.754098360655738
5402004,4,B00AA0BTW8,"I love this video for the very reason I hate it: It's hard. Really hard. And I'm in good shape and I think it's hard.

Instructor Nicole leads us through a very fast workout that's not long (the workout itself is only 22 minutes) but it's intense. I would not recommend this for anyone with back problems or physical issues because of the intensity.

I think Nicole is great - she's not chatty, which I appreciate, and she moves with style and precision. The workout itself targets the lower body in fun and inventive chair moves (Did I mention it's hard?) that aren't overly choreographed.  I've done it about four times and I still can't keep up but I'm inspired to keep trying until I can. Because, let's just be real here, I want to look like Madonna and that doesn't come for free.

The only reason I didn't give this the full five stars is that the video is cut into segments: warm up, workout, cool down. So when you're done with one segment, you have to stop what you're doing and click the next section. Why they did that I don't know but it's annoying.

Other than that, I'm in and I can't wait to get my rockin' Madonna bod on!",1371859200,9,1138,4.323943661971831
5402005,3,B00AA0BTW8,"I was a little disappointed, but only with the intensity of the workout.  I workout a lot, and so by the description I was expecting to really be dripping and exhausted.  Its a little challenging, but certainly not for advanced fitness levels.  FUN though !!",1370217600,9,258,4.688888888888889
5402006,5,B00AA0BTW8,"Nicole is an excellent instructor.  In her tutorial she explains each move, stresses safety and proper alignment all the while encouraging you do to what you can as well as you can with no pressure to be as flexible and strong as she is to start.  This allowed me to freely try her moves and accept that one day I will get better.  This is a great workout and really breaks the boredom you may be experiencing right now from too much P90X and Insanity - though don't get me wrong, I love Tony and ShaunT.  We have a home gym and a lot of exercise videos and I know this one will get used at least once a week for a very long time - can't wait for the great lower body toning I know I will achieve with Nicole's workout. You will not believe all the things she can do with that chair - which by the way if anyone finds where to buy that chair, please post it here.
The only drawback to this workout is the repetitive music - which is great to keep with the count but I fear I will get very tired of that disco thrumming.
The best thing about this video is that  Nicole does every count with you - she does not stop and it is very motivating to have her there doing each move instead of stopping to instruct expecting you to continue.  Oh, also she is very well spoken and has a sweet happy sounding voice - very upbeat.  Though I think this workout would appeal more to women since it is mainly hips, butt and thighs my husband said he would try it.  She is a very beautiful young woman and it is fun to watch her beautifully toned body make these moves look simple.
I highly recommend this video.  Enjoy in great health!",1361318400,19,1620,4.10126582278481

5402010,5,B00AA0BTW8,"This DVD is great .three steps, first she talks about the movements and what part of the body you're focusing on then she demonstrates each step and finally you do the workout . Very explainable and fun!",1398988800,,203,4.513513513513513
5402011,5,B00AA0BTW8,"Great workout, saw this on Dr. Oz, really gives results!  Good Price, sharing with friends, We figure if it works for Madonna, it'll work for us.......",1398470400,,151,4.8076923076923075
5402012,1,B00AA0BTW8,It might work but it is so boring that I could not do it. If you need something to motivate you to work out this is not it,1398124800,2,122,3.392857142857143
5402013,5,B00AA0BTW8,"I am a certified fitness instructor and I bought this for my wife and myself so we can do it together. Nicole is in great shape, knows what she is doing, and put a lot of thought into this workout which uses a chair as your only equipment. It is very well done.",1397433600,,261,3.943396226415094
5402014,2,B00AA0BTW8,"I've had  pathancockthis video for two weeks and I hope I live thru the next two weeks..Some reviewers proudly admitted it was too easy...PLEASE KNOCK IT OFF!!!  The tutorial was helpful but when I tried to remember this  when I discovered it was impossible to follow Nicole.  It would have been helpful to have a altered participant to follow as video progressed.  I will try to give it one month and see if it gets any easier for me.
I do like the length as most do not have the time or energy for a brutal 45 min. workout.  Madonna I`m not!!!",1396656000,,545,4.294117647058823
5402015,2,B00AA0BTW8,"I think that the idea for the chair routine is very unique, but I think that this video is poorly executed overall. Nicole does the workout with you, and she seems rather out of breath doing her own exercise, with little energy to spare to talk about execution or technique. Although I am in my twenties and am in fairly good shape, I have had knee surgeries, so I always appreciate when an instructor takes the time to draw attention to how to do a move correctly to avoid injury. In this video, there is barely any instruction, and I was worried I would hurt myself.

I wish that Nicole had a whole group of people doing the movements, as in most fitness videos, so that she could show you correct and incorrect positions, or low-and high-impact variations.

Further, the video quality itself is on the lower end of the spectrum, and there are not enough close-ups of Nicole to understand if you're doing the movements correctly for such a high-impact workout.  agree with others who say that the music, although helpful, becomes rather repetitive after the first five minutes. Overall, I would suggest this video to trained dance professionals only, as the lack of instruction, in my eyes, creates too big a risk for injury.",1395878400,3,1227,4.671296296296297
5402016,4,B00AA0BTW8,"This DVD is not for everyone!  It's great if you're ready for it.  You better have your energy level way up before you start it because she does a warmup but quickly dives right into a high energy, strong legs workout.  However lazy you might feel, when you see the shape her body is in it motivates you to do whatever she is doing!",1386374400,6,332,4.15625
8548850,1,B00AA0BTW8,"This workout is totally awful!!!  I own hundreds of exercise dvds, and workout daily.  This workout is stupid and dangerous.  It's done by jumping up and down on a regular chair, which is unsafe.  I'm going to throw it away - I wouldn't want to donate it to Goodwill, because whoever bought it, might get injured attempting to do it.  BTW, I am a high level intermediate/low level advanced exerciser, so it's not that the workout was too difficult - it's because it's potentially hazardous!!!!",1516320000,,493,4.752941176470588
8548851,4,B00AA0BTW8,"If you're not in great shape, and I'll admit right now I'm not, if you try and fully match pace with Nicole through the whole workout...you'll probably die.

The demo isn't listed first on the disc menu - and there is not a demo at the start of the workout - so you'd better watch that first so you'll know what you're supposed to be attempting to do in the workout.

I found it challenging, which was great, but I wish there was more than one workout sequence because I can see myself getting bored with it if I do it regularly.",1497484800,,529,4.176470588235294

8548859,5,B00AA0BTW8,"The first thing you notice is that this woman is quite the fitness professional. She's got knowledge and expertise and understands the physiology of the body. Quite the SAFE feeling when you're getting fitness advise, I must say! She shows you the moves in a 'preparation' segment, then does them with you in the next one. There's continuous explaining of the exercise and what part of the body it's designed to improve. This tape has as much toning as it has cardio. A great find, in my opinion!",1410393600,,496,4.6477272727272725
