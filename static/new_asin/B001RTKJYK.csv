3778848,4,B001RTKJYK,This is not my usual ROM com...but after watching tiger's stunts on YouTube...it became a must see...Tiger's talents as a Bollywood actor have my attention.and my family's. I started watching Bollywood's in 2009 because Hollywood became so predictable for me...I've been hooked ever since..Tiger's dad is actor Jackie schroff...both these men are very talented . I've been amassing a Bollywood collection..can't wait to see tigers piling up next to his dad's. So far I have two of his..be sure to check out Tiger in heropanti too!  I only gave it four stars because the violence was more graphic then my usual shows ...during some scenes I couldn't watch... His moves are like watching Bruce Lee and his son Jason Scott Lee.just pure fluid and hypnotic....the bow to his master was just beautiful! Love the songs too.,1470700800,,817,5.007352941176471

8338783,4,B001RTKJYK,"In this tale of love and morality versus corruption, Salman Khan plays Saajan, a college student who falls in love with Kajol (Nagma), who has been kidnapped and forced into prostitution.  Based on Khan's own idea, the story is sweet and moving, with good action scenes, and average music.  Nagma gives a good performance in her first role, and Khan is his usual charming self.  The viewer will be engaged until the end, hoping for a happy ending from a dire situation.",1496361600,,469,4.695121951219512

8338789,4,B001RTKJYK,Good movie with a lot of action but it is far from reality. It has many scenes in which such fights are shown which are not near to reality. However the overall story is good and filled with suspense and thrills.,1472428800,,212,4.195121951219512
8338790,2,B001RTKJYK,"A few good fight scenes (mostly towards the end) in an otherwise tiring and suspense-less production.  The film clearly borrows from The Raid, from concept right down to particular scenes, but is less brutal and therefore a bit more watchable.  Just.  Humor is horribly flat and the only other thing slightly redeeming is an attractive female lead.  Not recommended.  Hopefully a bigger producer will come along with a more professional vehicle for Tiger.",1471046400,,455,5.178082191780822
