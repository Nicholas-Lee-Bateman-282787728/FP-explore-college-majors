1945803,4,B0000TSQIO,"It's easy to see why ""Vixen!"" is one of the late Russ Meyer's more popular movies, with two of those reasons (sorry, this kind of humor is mandatory here) being Erika Gavin. Gavin, as the libidinous title character, seems to be having a great time frolicking through this movie, mounting Canadian mounties, sexually teasing her biker brother or seducing the young couple who stay at the mountain lodge she and her pilot husband operate. Vixen's racism is a bit disconcerting--she frequently hurls racial slurs at her brother's African-American draft-dodging pal Niles--though it seems used largely to set up a plot twist involving communism and hijacking (it'll make sense, sort of, when you see it). Meyer never did hardcore, but the sex in this one isn't as explicit as in some of his later '70s films (""Up"" and ""Beneath the Valley of the Ultra Vixens"" for example). Still, it seems a lot more erotic, with all the men and women embodying sexual archetypes of the day (not to mention Meyer's own erotomanias). It's one of the few Russ Meyer movies where both the women AND the men have good chests. Also toned down are the manic jump cuts and breathless exposition, making ""Vixen!"" a lot less exhausting viewing experience than other Meyer movies, like ""Cherry, Harry & Raquel"" or ""Up.""

Though I'm partial to Meyer's black and white drive-in films, like ""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"" and ""Mudhoney,"" and ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" is a camp masterpiece, I count ""Vixen!"" as one of my favorite Russ Meyer movies.",1096070400,32,1522,4.89922480620155

8002816,4,B0000TSQIO,This movie is a classic for big breast lovers....The boobs on both ladies are tremendous......But you must remember this is soft core....Russ Meyer was not into hard  core....so all you see is simulated sex....Still not bad,1429488000,,223,5.194444444444445
8002817,4,B0000TSQIO,"Curse of Crimson Altar was what I expected I just wanted to see the uncut version as very rarely do they show the cut version on TV.

Very Few Russ Meyer Videos get Televised and this one has never been so It was my 1st time seeing this again It was what I expected.",1381622400,,266,3.925925925925926
8002818,4,B0000TSQIO,"One of the flims that kicked started the sexual revolution in flim made in the late 60's it's nowhere near scandalious as it once was. I read the Roger Ebert review and decided to purchase this flim and I liked it I recomended it to Russ Meyer fans, and I don't wannan to give away to much of the plot but at the end there is a scene invloving communist and an airplane.",1366156800,,370,4.082191780821918
8002819,1,B0000TSQIO,this product was not what it wasadvertised as it wasn't rated correctly. TV shows more then this movie does. Then when I asked to return it I would have to pay shipping and a restocking fee. Which I wasn't even told how much. So why bother it will probably cost as much as the movie in the first place. so be careful if you don't know the movie for sure.,1342915200,,354,4.071428571428571
8002820,3,B0000TSQIO,"This was the first ""X"" rated film ever approved by the MPAA.  Russ Meyer was more than just a filmmaker (or for some, ""a pornographer""), he was a visionary.  He just used sex to make topics more interesting in his movies.  Thinks about it!  Take away all of the sex.  Take away all the inuendo of lesbianism, incest and adultery and what do you have?  A case study of how individuals can manipulate others.  In Vixen's case, she was a master manipulator of everyone she came across.  In the end, I felt sorry for Vixen because of her narrowmindedness.  I've very surprised that Erica Gavin's career never took off after this film.  If you've never experienced a Russ Meyer film, then this is the one to watch.  It's his best work!",1294012800,,730,4.4961832061068705
8002821,3,B0000TSQIO,"Vixen Palmer (Erica Palmer) is the wife of a Canadian bush pilot... She and her husband run a resort for vacationers, but she utilizes the place more for her erotic exploits than for making money... To say that she is having sexual relations with many is an understatement... She provokes many of the young boys in a nearby town, and basically has a good time...

Everyone seems to know about Vixen's exploits except her husband, who constantly considers her a loving, loyal housewife... The plot moves into high gear when a Communist hijacks the husband's plane and orders him at gunpoint to fly to Cuba...

While Meyer never moved into graphic sex, ""Vixen"" was one of the early expressing films for the adult market... It contained much simulated intercourse, a lot of nudity, and sex jokes... The film by nature is exploitative, but Meyer always lets the plot move in and out of the erotic encounters, creating a distinct stimulating sex comedy rather than a series of cheap shots... The performances are always exuberant, and--despite the hilarious action--the characters are very realistic...",1232236800,3,1097,5.021978021978022
8002822,4,B0000TSQIO,"Any college male who saw this flick in the 60's will never forget it.  For most of us, it was our first introduction to the wacky world of Russ Meyer, with his buxom babes and square-jawed men.  The movie begins with a pilot landing his plane in the great north as a voice says, ""This is bush country.""  From then on, you're hooked.  Thank you, Russ.",1184284800,6,350,4.257575757575758
8002823,2,B0000TSQIO,"God, this has to be the most badly edited movie ever!  It's like a student film.  And as far as soft core goes, it's pretty awful.  The only scene worth a damn is the lesbian one, but don't think you'll be seeing anything more than breasts.  It's not that kind of movie.  If you want to see Erica Gavin in a good movie, watch ""Caged Heat""",1102723200,8,338,4.0606060606060606
