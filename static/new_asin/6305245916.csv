I really enjoyed this picture.  Unlike many others, the plot and the action complement each other rather than detract.  A skillful mix!",1414627200,,374,4.676923076923077

7886802,1,6305245916,"If my title, while true, attracted you to this rotten film, turn off the TV, go outside, and play.  Kaczmarek really slums here as a suffering wife whose husband gets involved in a hot little blonde number who is into S&M.  The blonde, played by Sommerfield, is too pretty to have the humiliation heaped on her here in the name of sexual obsession.  I really wish actors and actresses would stop making junk like this and work on their craft.  There is no redeeming qualities here except for some good performances amid the dulling sex and nudity.  I think ""Wildly Available"" tries to pass itself off as an independent film when, in fact, it is just desperate and sad.",980812800,5,668,4.579831932773109
7886803,5,6305245916,"I saw the film and i was deeply attracted by It. The detailed motion and it's close to life made me like it immediately. I don't know how to express  my feeling well, but i guess every person when saw it will think it worth  their time to thinking and have good feeling.",969408000,3,270,4.0754716981132075
