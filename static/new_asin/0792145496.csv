130158,4,0792145496,"The plot looks like ""The Vanishing"", with Kiefer Sutherland and Nancy Travis. However ""Breakdown"" goes to the adventure kind of film, instead of mystery. And this is its great quality. It is a surprising  non-stop action movie. We kind konw what is going to happen, but it comes  with a lotta unexpected electicity. Kurt Russell is well but just imagine  if it was Harrison ford in his place - uau! Kathleen Quinlan has the ideal  look for the desirable young wife, but she's not only the screaming victim  - wait for the grand finale and you'll see what I mean!",912297600,,562,4.58

130339,5,0792145496,Great movie. I first saw it when it came out in 1997. I'd forgotten a lot of it and decided to watch it again one night when I had nothing else to do. I streamed it through Amazon Prime. It's still as good as I remember. The only thing I don't understand is the price of the DVD here. The movie is nearly 20 years old and available on Amazon Prime so I was surprised to see that the DVD costs 34.99. In my opinion that's pretty expensive for an old movie. I read some reviews that say the plot is ridiculous but there is some truth to the story being possible. Things like this have happened. A former trucker confessed to killing multiple people in Texas in 2012. Some were couples. He kept a torture chamber in the back of his rig. I've seen another story involving a different killer similar to that in an ID documentary. So while the movie isn't based on any true story it's entirely possible that some events could occur in real life.,1505001600,3,939,4.251396648044692

130392,5,0792145496,"This movie really took me by surprise. Earlier this afternoon I was browsing through Amazon Video, looking for something to keep on in the background while I played a game on my computer. I saw 'Breakdown' in the ""newly added"" section for prime members, and I'm a huge fan of Kurt Russell but had never seen this movie. I decided to give it a try.

Within about 15 minutes, I stepped away from the game I was playing and devoted my full attention to this excellent thriller. My eyes were glued to the screen the entire time, I really can't recommend this flick enough. It's a quick watch but doesn't feel rushed. The cinematography was incredible, also.

Just hoping for a blu-ray release, now. DVD is fine, but I streamed the movie in full 1080p on amazon and really can't see myself watching the movie in a lower quality.",1503100800,2,823,4.516778523489933

By the 3rd act, your eyes are bulging out of your head in disbelief at how much the metaphorical cow poop has hit the proverbial fan. And the little exchange at 1:18:34 is one of the most hilarious things I've seen in a film since the stormtrooper knocking himself out walking through a doorway in A New Hope. I've probably watched this segment a dozen times now. This movie is described by some reviewers as a Hitchcockian thriller. I think it's closer to a Coen brothers flick given the moments of dark and unexpected humor. Do yourself a favor and make a bowl of popcorn and watch this one with your friends on a beefy surround sound system.",1477526400,,704,4.465116279069767

Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan are a married couple on a cross-country trip from Boston to San Diego. When their car breaks down in the Arizona desert, along comes a seemingly friendly long-distance truck driver (played by J.T. Walsh), who offers to help.  Should they trust him?  Is he really a Good Samaritan - or are his motives sinister?  This is a very suspenseful film, with wonderful performances.  Highly recommended.",1477267200,,518,5.035294117647059

Wife gets kidnapped and naive hubby goes chasing after her including a show of ""honoring"" the ransom demand for more than the couple ever had.  Hubby loses the gun with which he was hoping to take control of the situation while riding the undercarriage of the 18 wheeler of one of the kidnapping gang.  At the farm house of the truck driver, hubby manages to regain control of the situation and release his wife from the kidnappers but they chase the couple in multiple vehicles with multiple guns blazing.  Hubby wins the dangling from bridge fight scene and the film ends with the couple sitting on the bridge.

131549,4,0792145496,"Good movie, but not without problems. There are some fatal inconsistencies as with many Hollywood movies. The thing that needs to be mentioned is: There are 100,000 missing people at any given time in America, and probably millions over the last 50 or 60 years. Most are victims of the type of random crime kidnapping, prostitution, extortion, trafficking, etc. Many however are victims of the financial elite and politicians, simply for sexual slavery and their own sick satanic ritual, torture, and deviance. FBI office director Ted Gunderson and others have reported/testified on this subject, and found evidence of these crimes. Rarely are the perpetrators prosecuted. There are very powerful and rich real life sociopaths in our society, who live otherwise normal lives and have families (like in this movie), but have double (hidden) lives.

The action is ripping good, and Kurt does a great acting job, going from a kind of urban wimpy kind of guy, to a testosterone heated madman as he goes through all kinds of danger and excitement trying to find and then rescue his wife. The bad guys are truly bad guys, and there's not a bunch messing around about it. They are purely evil and cut exactly zero slack in dealing with their victims. The series of events composing the last half hour are really exciting and unusual. Don't watch it right before bedtime if you need to get to sleep right away.

Well, stop right here because you are looking at a BIG winner, a gem in the haystack of boring films!

Let me put it this way without spoilers: for 1 hour and 33 minutes I was transfixed before the TV, no cell phone, no snack breaks, no bathroom. . NADA! . . . a trifecta of being on the edge of your seat.  Haven't felt this way since I was a kid watching Hitchcock's The Birds.

For certain you will never take another road trip without remembering searing scenes from this adrenaline spiked film!

It is the commonplace SITUATION of this story that really scares ya, very little suspension of disbelief, very possible indeed.

What I can't figure out is how the heck I missed hearing about this great movie back in 1997.  Thanks Amazon for reintroducing the greats that somehow slip into oblivion.",1468627200,2,977,4.548571428571429

132544,5,0792145496,"I remember watching this movie on TV years ago and I still believe it holds up today. It would have made a fantastic Hitchcock movie dealing with a man's missing wife. Kurt Russel' character is driving down a desert highway with his beautiful wife when he runs into some very bad people in a truck who want to kidnap young women. The car they are driving 'breaks down' with help from the bad guys after Russel's car is left alone for a while at a gas station (long enough to have some wires disconnected). Stranded, he and his wife run into a 'friendly' trucker who just happens to be driving down the same road as they are. He convinces Russel that he will need to call for a tow truck at the next town so he (stupidly I must say) allows his wife to go with the trucker to the next town to call for help while he waits with the car. First mistake.... never, NEVER allow your wife to go with a total stranger! From there, he finds that same trucker later who denies even knowing who his wife is much less having picked her up at all. And so the mystery begins for him to be in search of his beautiful and now missing wife. The rest of the story is full of suspense and thrills of what he does to find her and what really happened to her. The idea of someone missing and others denying even knowing that person is not a new one. (Hitchcock's older film ""The Lady Vanishes"" has a somewhat similar theme) But this film adds some very good suspense that is not present in other films with such themes. I do enjoy this film and I hope you do to. I believe it is definitely worth watching if you enjoy good suspense films. I am glad I picked it up.",1466467200,4,1642,4.166666666666667

132582,4,0792145496,"Breakdown is a good tense suspense drama, but it is marred by one large negative: Religious bigotry and hatred on the part of
Jonathan Mostow, the writer and director of the movie. I remember seeing documentaries about how the Nazis developed all sorts of blatant as well as more subtle anti-Semitic movies during the 1930's, usually showing the bad characters as being perceptibly Jewish doing harm to pure innocent Aryans. One scene showed hideous looking Jews closing in on a fair blond beauty wearing a gold swastika around her neck. Well, Mostow seems to be emulating the Nazi bigots in this movie since throughout the film, over and over again, he makes sure the audience sees the truly hideous antagonist driving his truck with an ever-present plastic Virgin Mary or Jesus on his dash-board. Nice subtle linkage Jonathan. This kind of gratuitous anti-Christian bigotry and hate, especially when done by a Jew who should know the evil of such bigotry, mars an otherwise good taught drama. This kind of blatant anti-Christian bias is not unusual in Hollywood productions. But wherever it is raised it needs to be condemned.",1463616000,,1128,5.00531914893617

From there, events come together to take Jeffrey Taylor(Russell) out of this career transition into a much darker world where those passing through may never get to where they are going, ending up on the missing persons poster in sheriffs' offices.

As soon as the movie starts, you already get this feeling like something just isn't right. It starts right away and it doesn't stop until the credits roll. Every time you think it's finally over, something else happens.

They took a story that has been told many times before and made it gripping and intense. Kurt Russell delivers as usual and his supporting cast help make this little 93 minute flick one great thrill ride. It's a real shame that this one has still yet to make it to blu ray, there are thousands of movies on BR that aren't half as deserving as this one.",1425254400,,662,4.426229508196721

132930,3,0792145496,"Jonathan Mostow's intense chase thriller features an increasingly frustrated Kurt Russell running after his lost wife Amy, a poor lady who accepted a truck ride from a stranger in order to get help and ends up paying the ultimate price. The performances by all those involved are strong and really help to make ""Breakdown"" something special.
A clever melding of the horror, suspense, and chase genres, ""Breakdown"" is an excellent suspense movie that builds genuine tension and excitement for its entire length, even as it flirts with genre clichs and pulls a viewer down an endless series of roads. Manipulative, and extremely intense in its violence and mounting frustration, the film gets viewers on Russell's side very quickly, and the results lead up to one of the most provocative missing persons films ever made. The movie's decided lack of greatness is the very thing that makes me feel that it is a great viewing experience; it was exciting, angering, and ultimately action-packed. Thankfully, the movie doesn't attempt to say very much, it simply intends to wow with hyperkinetic filmmaking, and on that level it's a real success. The late J. T. Walsh goes over the top in this one, but he's as effective as ever. If you like this genre, ""Breakdown"" will be one of your favorite movies without question.
The DVD, though, is grievous (to be polite about it). My older VHS tape was a lot less grainy in appearance than this new DVD transfer. I don't know if ""Breakdown"" has made it to Blu-Ray yet but it is certainly one that should. I hope that newer transfer will have a much cleaner picture, a better array of extras, and a more sound packaging design. Certainly one of Kurt Russell's better performances, but also (strangely) one of his most overlooked, probably due to the fact that the film has that B-movie, genre based pretension about it. But if you enjoy exciting movies, miss this one at your own risk.",1424304000,2,1920,4.821212121212121

He plays a man on vacation in the desert area of US (remote) who runs into a helpful trucker who gives his wife a ride to the nearby cafe while Kurt waits for help wuth his car. Somehow the car runs again & Kurt realizes wife gone. What happens next is every motorist's nitemare. A group of what I call evil rednecks give him a runaround at the cafe his wife was supposed to go to. Then he rides by the truck he saw her get in, makes the giant rig stop & confronts the trucker. The trucker denies even seeing the wife-a policeman (one of only.two in the one horse town) stops & listens to ""Kurt's"" story & searches the truck & as he finds no evidence moves on. Kurt later gets in a bunch if dilemas where henis captured & forced to draw money out to get his wife back, then escapes by beating one of his captors who had him trussed up in another smaller truck-lucky for him he managed to grab a letter opener from bank desk thou watched by the gang of criminals. The one of two cops stops the runnung wild truck as Kurt was all over the road duct taping and beating the bad guy who had him duct tapped. Of course, said cop thought Kurt was the bad guy so gave the bad guy an ok to exit the truck while asking him if he was ""ok""'. Then the bad guy shot the cop & Kurt ran like Hell. Then injured cop shot thr bad guy & 911 called by Kurt I think who git cops gun & took off in truck to find where wife was taken.

A married couple drive through the desert on the way to San Diego. Their car has a problem and stops. A friendly truck driver helps to push their car off the road, then offers a ride to Amy to the next rest stop. When the car cools down Jeffrey arrives at this rest stop. But Amy is not there! When he catches up to the truck driver the driver claims no knowledge of his wife! The truck is empty too. A Highway Patrolman checks it out. Could his wife have left him after a quarrel? Go see the Deputy for a missing persons report. They will do their best for Jeffrey Taylor. Jeffrey drives on until he finds the road closed. Hes getting away! Jeffrey drives into a fast flowing river. A man shoots at him. Can he survive in that swiftly flowing river? There is a big surprise for Jeffrey!

Jeffrey learns this gang wants $90,000 ransom for his wifes return. They send him to the local bank to make a wire transfer. He tries to tell the bank manager about the crime but a strange man sits nearby. When he gets the money he is told to start walking along the road until a car stops for him. Did his expensive new car attract unwanted attention? Jeffrey is able to escape and capture this long mustached man. The Highway Patrolman calls in this car, then stops this pickup truck. Shots are fired, officer down. Jeffrey goes to that truck stop and hitches a ride! Can he get in back of the cab? The truck stops. Jeffrey hides and sees where they hid Amy. Jeffrey acquires a pistol and locks up the gang (except for one). Jeffrey and Amy get away but are pursued by that gang in a demolition derby. Will the big truck push the small truck off the road into a canyon? Will the good guy survive for a happy ending? Yes, but its a narrow escape.

One lesson is to never leave your cars hood open (or the doors unlocked) when you stop on a drive. Just as you wouldnt leave you drink unattended in a public place. [Watch D.O.A. for an example.] The other is to never separate your group while traveling (as was done here). Beware of friendly strangers who want to help you out.

The driver of the other vehicle later shows up at the same gas station as Kurt and concludes that the two must be rich, based on the relative luxury of their much newer vehicle. While Kurt is inside the station the redneck other driver disables Kurt's car by disconnecting some wires, but the impact doesn't occur until Kurt and wife are several miles down the road. A semi-truck fortunately comes by, and volunteers to take them to a nearby caf - Kurt's wife accepts.

Kurt finds the disconnected wires, fixes the problem, and upon reaching the designated caf finds nobody has seen his wife. Having been to Monument Valley several times I can attest to the fact that many of the locales used in the film are nowhere near Monument Valley.

133345,4,0792145496,"I saw this upon it's original VHS release (did I say that out loud?) and remembered liking it a lot so I thought I'd revisit it. It held up really well.

Here's the scoop. Kurt Russell is travelling with his wife from Massachusetts to San Diego. They are driving a new Jeep, changing jobs and the chaos has left their bank account in a shambles. The Jeep breaks down in the desert. A trucker (J.T. Walsh) offers help. Russell's wife (Kathleen Quinlan) offers to go with the trucker to call for a tow while Kurt waits with the car. While waiting, Kurt finds the problem, gets the Jeep going, heads into town to find out his wife's missing and the trucker denies ever having seen him. Something's afoot and Kurt needs to get to the bottom of things.

This is a ""taut thriller."" Aside from some clunky dialogue inserted to further the plot, this really had me going. The plot points were good and the action was well thought out and directed. And Russell doesn't play an ex-marine or kung-fu hero. He's a regular Joe who slowly rises to the occasion. Little by little he thinks things through and takes advantages of situations. At times, even well into the movie, he's scared out of his wits but keeps going. The climax, on afterthought, could be considered over the top, but it was still really tense. The production values were solid. No bones showing here. Acting, editing, music all blended to make this a near seamless effort.

This can easily be considered typical Hollywood stuff and it is. But they can do this sort of thing really well and this is crafted as well as some of the best of them.",1363651200,,1599,4.506896551724138

133350,4,0792145496,"Breakdown(released May/97)stars Kurt Russell as Jeff Taylor and Kathleen Quinlan as his wife Amy. This is a very taut thriller,full of suspense and surprises,which keeps the pace going at full throttle throughout.
The plot involves the Taylors moving from Massachusetts to California and traveling the scenic roads through the southwestern U.S.Jeff has been driving solo for quite a while and as he reaches back for a flask of coffee,upon his return a pick up truck pulls out of the desert and onto the road. He is forced to act quickly and barely avoids a collision. Later while filling up with gas down the road,the  driver of the same pick up he almost collided with,is there also and the two have a small confrontation. Soon though,it's back on the road but after a few minutes their vehicle suddenly sputters out and they become stranded. Jeff and his wife stare at their engine and are ruminating on their fate,when a trucker happens along and offers some help. Jeff at first refuses but his wife changes his mind and she hops a ride to the nearest truck stop just 5 miles away and says she will return with a tow truck.
All alone he stares at the engine but eventually spies some wires pulled down under the engine area. He re-joins them and is off and running. He reaches the truck stop,Belles Diner,but no one has apparently seen his wife. He heads out onto the road again and spies the truck and driver that picked up his wife. He stops the truck and he has an ugly confrontation with the driver,who claims he has never seen him or his wife before. A policeman just happens along and he searches the truck but can find no evidence of foul play. Instead he lets the trucker go and he advises Jeff to go to town and fill out a report for his deputy there. This he does and when he is done he heads back to the diner. Amy still hasn't surfaced and while he uses the phone a young man cleaning a car  nearby says that he has seen his wife and tells him where she might be. He heads out to that area but is ambushed. He and his vehicle end up in a fast flowing river,becoming a shooting target along the way. Jeff escapes and circles around only to get knocked out and kidnapped.
When he comes to he is on a ridge overlooking a small town. The leader of this operation is none other than the trucker,with his accomplices the pick up truck driver and the young man who gave him directions out there. The trucker demands he go to town and draw out a large sum of money for ransom or he will never see his wife again. He goes into town and withdraws everything he can,but far short of what the men wanted. He is picked up outside of town by the pick up truck driver. When the driver realizes the bag of money is far short of what they demanded,Jeff springs into action by plunging a letter opener he acquired at the bank,into the shoulder of the driver. In the ensuing struggle Jeff manages to overpower the driver and take control of the pick up. Just as he does a policeman passes by,but sensing some suspicious activity,turns around and chases the pick up down. The policeman forces Jeff onto the ground while the yells for his passenger(who Jeff tied up with duct tape)to come out. He does but with a gun drawn with which to shoot the police officer. With the officer down Jeff escapes down a hill,as the driver takes aim on Jeff. Before he can pull the trigger the wounded cop shoots him down. Jeff returns to the policeman and assists him calling for an ambulance,then leaves.
Jeff heads to a truck stop the pick driver had mentioned and he finds the leader/trucker there. He hitches a ride,precariously hanging on underneath the rig. He makes his way to the cab and sits behind the driver area until the trucker reaches his home. It is there,in a barn,Jeff bails out and watches the trucker and his accomplices,which have subsequently joined him,unload his wife and throw her into a freezer below the barn floor. The barn itself is loaded with merchandise picked up from other folks like the Taylors,as this ""operation"" of theirs has been going on a long,long time. Jeff cannot find the keys to the lock to the underground freezer area,which he has unsuccessfully tried to pry open. He does find a gun and enters the truckers home and confronts the group. One escapes while he locks the rest in the underground freezer area,but not before freeing Amy.
The two flee to a trailer on the grounds,beside which is a pick up truck. As they search for the keys for the truck,the trucker comes bearing down on them with his rig and tears through the trailer like it is paper. As he wheels around for another pass at them,they find the keys and flee in the pick up in the nick of time. Just when they think they have escaped on the highway,they get caught between two cars and the truckers big rig behind them. The two cars are eventually taken out but the truck keeps on coming. It all ends on a bridge as the trucker manages to get their pick up sideways in front of his truck. He then proceeds to push them over the guardrail to the creek bed below. Amy is wedged in the pick up but Jeff gets out and gets inside the truckers cab. In the struggle the truck itself goes over the rail and is being held from falling into the creek bed by a slightly protruding bridge strut. Jeff and the trucker climb to the top of the cab and fight it out. How will the film end? You have to watch it to find out,my friends.
The film certainly has an intriguing plot,and the entire cast is on their game from the get go. When Amy isn't there at the diner,Kurt's desperation climbs slowly but surely. And when he finally meets up again with the trucker and he denies ever seeing him,we now know something terrible has happened to Amy...but what? That's where the movie goes and it is quite the ride. The suspense never lets up from that point on.
Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r and is clear and crisp. Besides the trailer there are no extras.
A highly recommended film with a storyline that pulls you in from the start. Russell shines as the desperate husband trying to find his wife,pulled into something he has to inexorably try to free he and his wife from. 4 -4 1/2 stars/.",1344211200,,6187,4.431079894644425

133352,2,0792145496,"In BREAKDOWN, Kurt Russell and Amy Quinlan play a wealthy New England couple who find horror in Iowa. While driving cross-country, their car breaks down. The various local people they meet who initially seem helpful are in fact criminals working together. The wife is kidnapped, the husband is told to pay half a million to get her back alive, and Kurt Russell decides he'd rather fight.

I found this a rather lame movie. Its believability goes way down when, for example, Kurt Russell rides on the bottom of a moving truck trailer and easily finds his way up to the cab. There are obvious continuity and other errors here: a villain gets a brutal rifle blast to his shoulder, but a few minutes later he's driving a car with no visible problems; a small child is shown playing video games (so it's early evening), but a few minutes later in the same scene dawn breaks.

About the only entertainment here is the acting of J.T. Walsh and M.C. Gainey, who are caricatures but fun ones. Kurt Russell, on the other hand, acts like he's not particularly happy to have taken this role, and is just going through the motions until he gets his paycheck.

I must say that the purported message, if any, of this film is intriguing. BREAKDOWN seems to be suggesting that decent people from the coasts shouldn't venture into flyover country, since it's the den of rednecks who lie in wait for them. The forces behind this film clearly weren't interested in fairly portraying the Midwest.",1327968000,3,1475,4.687258687258687

133392,4,0792145496,"How does Joe Everyday react when his wife is unexpectedly kidnapped by a trucker and his gang of nasty hombres?  I like to think he reacts pretty much in line with Kurt Russell's befuddled character in BREAKDOWN, a grand, seat-squirming thriller.  Protagonist Jeff Taylor does what he has to do to save his wife, but in the meantime he goes through the full gambit of emotions, from disbelief to incredulity to fear to anger to vengeance.  And is it ever fun to watch.

A Massachusetts couple (Russell and Kathleen Quinlan) en route to their new lives in California suddenly finds their SUV in disrepair in the middle of Desert Nowhere.  (Or did their SUV *really* break down, perchance?)  An apparent Good Samaritan trucker (the late great J.T. Walsh is fabulous) stops by to lend assistance, and offers to take the wife to the nearest diner to phone for help.  After they depart Jeff discovers the malfunction is due to some disconnected wires under the chassis and he races off to the diner--only to find no sign of his wife, and no cooperation from the hostile locals.  And that's when the BREAKDOWN fun starts, as Jeff tries (without success) to convince local law enforcement there's been foul play, culminating in his taking his own vigilante pound of flesh to get his wife back.

Walsh is a most believable villain and the action and pacing are frenetic to say the least.  The ending is over-the-top lame pizza supreme, but then again, how else could a white-knuckle thriller like BREAKDOWN reach its violent climax?  Just hang on to the arms of your chair and enjoy the ride.

133395,5,0792145496,"Kurt Russell exceeded himself in this film. He ran the gamet of emotions with intense believability as an actor. The first time I saw Breakdown was a few years after it had been released which made me think, ""how did I miss this one?"" The genuine feelings of loss and  true desperation conveyed for his wife is spot on.

  A husband and his wife traveling down an empty highway into the unknown evils of his ""fellow man"" is the crux of the film. Interestingly, Breakdown never early on needs to ""prove"" how much love the couple have for one other. That one element, love, becomes immediately apparent when his wife vanishes. It socks you in the gut, and that look is all over Russell's face as he makes his first cursory search in a dusty roadside bar.

  There are only about six or seven charactors of substance in Breakdown and that is not a detractor. The thwarters of Russell's plight are played with such mean son of a bitc*ery that you want to reach out and ring their necks yourself. The plot is not filled with major complexity which adds to it's astounding depth and simplicity. Great well thought out action scenes drag you through the rural landscape. I really believe the film has never received the proper recognition it deserves. While watching the movie, your envolved!  A display of raw humanity is upheld by the players on every level.

  There is nothing missing from Kurt Russell's acting in Breakdown that makes it anything short of Acadamy Award material. Definetely capable of repeated viewings. This is a perfect film for blu ray (which as of this writting has not been released) and all kinds of extras. Pull the gear shift!!!",1306454400,2,1651,4.658620689655172
133396,4,0792145496,"My title says it all....
This film(and Kurt Russell's role in it) got NONE of the respect and accolade it deserves!  It fell quickly below the radar not long after hitting theaters hence my description of it as a ""sleeper"".  So glad to see Amazon giving it the light of day in DVD and instant formats.

But let's go back a few years.  I ""fell over"" this film about 5-6 years after it came and went in theaters - just like I do every other gol'darn movie I loved!! LOL. Same with ""Back To The Future"" - saw it 8 years after the 1985 version came out and never . . looked . .  back.  That is my favorite movie saga - but I digress.

""Breakdown"" is shorter than the average cinematic release at a bit over 90 minutes, but due to killer pacing and blending of scenes and the sheer raw emotion and suspense in this thing all sense of time is suspended!  You become ""Jeff Taylor"" in this career-changing-cross-country-road-rage-playing-dumb-locals-abduction-conflict-redemption roller coaster.  The plot itself certainly is NO sleeper!

I invite any/all comments on the following issues I raise over some plot scenario and ""technicalities"" of Breakdown:

#1.  The catalyst for the whole film:  Jeff Taylor and his wife are cruising across the New Mexico desert when Taylor has an unquenchable thirst.  He adjusts himself in the driver's seat in preparation to reach for a thermos in the backseat, takes one final glance ahead of him, turns his head back and retrieves the thermos.  Meanwhile...

Black dust F-150 pulls across highway in front of the Taylors.  A near collision and violent swerve takes place as Jeff evades the truck that has appeared of of ""nowhere"".  QUESTION:  Was this near collision entire Taylor's fault - OR - did the F-150 not see the Jeep before entering a highway - OR - was it a combination of Taylor's distraction  and the DELIBERATE ACT of the F-150 STAGING this near collision??  Your thoughts, anyone?

#2. IMDB mentions tons of accidental intrusions into the film by cameramen and mic booms, all of which I have yet to notice only if I run the DVD at 2 frames per second.

My biggest technicality is the time of day itself.  During the scene in my #1, and subsequent scenes at Belle's Diner, the confrontation between Jeff, the trucker, and the Sheriff, the chase scene with ""Earl""(Gainey) into the river, and the small town and the truck stop scene where Taylor manages to stow away under Red's truck, it seems almost no regard was given to time of day or at least taking the position of the sun into account as it progresses across the sky.

The initial road-rage incident seems to take place mid-day.  While Jeff is waiting by the road for his wife's return, then discovers the loose wires beneath his Jeeps engine, it seems like late afternoon.  During the first scene at Belles, the sun seems to be ""higher"".  As Jeff spots Red's truck in the distance and prepares to pursue him, it seems only an hour or so before sunset.

When Earl chases Jeff up the mountain road and Jeff escapes by driving down the embankment into the river, it's broad daylight again!  Ditto the seen in ""Brackett"" where Jeff is wired the ransom money.

First of all - I do believe that the events portrayed in this film could have taken place over a 24 hour period - no doubt.  But the inconsistent daylight from scene to scene(perhaps deliberate) skews our sense of time.  Am I just ""overthinking"" these aspects? Or is this a good point?  Your thoughts?

Overall, ""Breakdown"" is a movie I will never bore of.  It's a film most people fail to think of when enumerating Kurt Russell's roles, but boy are they missing out!",1300060800,,3625,4.635792778649922

- His car breaks down off the road and a truck driver offers a ride for his wife while Kurt stays behind with the car. Afterwards he is able to reconnect the wires that made his car stall and head to the diner where the truck driver says he was taking his wife

- Like much of those dumb teenage horror flicks where the whole town is on the crime, no one tells him anything so goes chasing after the truck driver.

- He finds the truck driver and stops a patrol vehicle, the truck driver says he has never scene Kurt or his wife before. Instead of kicking his ass all over the freeway he cries to the officer. He should have demanded that the pull prints off his truck since it would prove that she was in the cab

After their car breaks down in open country, a married couple (Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan) are pitched into mortal danger when Quinlan disappears after accepting help from a sinister trucker (J.T. Walsh).

Well-scripted thriller, in which Russell and Quinlan become entangled in a ghoulish extortion plot after falling prey to some less than savory characters (I'll say no more). Believable plot twists lead to a dynamic climax which should have most viewers rivetted to their seats, and which probably accounted for director Jonathan Mostow being hired to direct TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES (2003).

Massachusetts transplantees Jeff and Amy Taylor (Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan) are driving to a new life in California when their jeep breaks down. There has already been an incident on the road with some local rednecks that have unsettled the couple. A seemingly helpful trucker (the late great J.T.Walsh-who could do this role better!) stops to offer them a ride to a nearby diner. Amy accepts and that's where the film takes off. She is nowhere to be found,Jeff wonders if he has gone nuts,the whole set of redneck locals seem to be somehow in on it and Jeff goes to the most extreme measures to uncover the plot to kidnap his wife.
The editing in this film is slick and a scene involving a pickup and a semi hanging off of a bridge is priceless and appropriately palm-sweating. This is not the greatest film in the world,but for the type of film that it is,and clocking in at a smart 97 minutes (instead of the 120+ that we seem to keep getting nowadays!),BREAKDOWN keeps pace with the best of action-thrillers.
Kurt Russell's performance is really the key to this film. Russell is known for doing a majority of his stunts, and he really does get banged-up a lot.
Highly recommended for a tense time if that is what you need to get jolted.",1190764800,2,1621,4.75177304964539

That dramatic struggle against the time, the febrile anguish and the fear generated by this coward kidnapping is magnificently told, with (at least to my mind) and supported by the best performance on screen until this date by Ken Russell and the epic means he will have to employ to rescue her. Adrenaline, high tension and hair raising sequences will lead us to a very credible final.

Kudos too, for this promise of the direction: Jonathan Mostow, the same who filmed four years later, the cult movie U-571.",1187222400,,1029,4.612021857923497
133440,5,0792145496,"Breakdown is a terrifying movie that enters the timeliest fears of our time, joyfully and perhaps sardonically representing what happens when we find out that our $50,000 sport utility vehicle isn't enough to protect us from all the nasty human unsavory people that are out there in the world just waiting to kick us a big on in the face.
Kurt Russell is Jeff Taylor and  his wife, Amy (Kathleen Quinlan), have pulled up roots in Massachusetts to move cross-country via the driving method. After talking to a redneck trucker because their Jeep breaks down in the Utah desert, the terrifing fun begins. Just like in Spielberg's Duel, malevolence arrives in the semblance of a big truck. The trucker named Red (J.T. Walsh) agrees to give Amy a lift to the nearest pay phone while Jeff stays with the car.
Now, it's easy to wonder why in the world Jeff would let his wife ride off with a total stranger in an 18 wheeler, but put yourself in the same situation and you would probably do the same thing.  One goes to get help, the other stays with the automobile.
Amy disappears, never turning up at Belle's Diner, where she was supposed to meet with Jeff. The customers have never seen her. And when Jeff chases down Red's rig, Amy is nowhere to be found. Worse, Red claims that he's never seen Jeff before in his life.
What now happens is, ""lets find the wife.""  What an awesome thrill ride that the entire cast gives, especially Russell as the nervous, ready to enter the booby hatch husband who let his wife loose the grip of his loving hand back on that lonesome highway when a nice trucker said, ""Come with me, I can help.""  Russell turns out an amazing performance as the obsessed husband who let his wife get away.  He becomes totally focused,  almost obsessively so to find out why this town has never seen his wife, lips are shut tight and you definitely get the opinion this is CreepVille, Utah.
Rent it.  What a fun ride.  You will have sweaty palms throughout.",1186358400,3,1968,4.53954802259887
133441,4,0792145496,"""Breakdown"" is a 1997 film starring Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan as a couple moving from Boston to San Diego. Somewhere in Arizona -- in the middle of nowhere -- their SUV breaks down. They are beset by a team of guys that make money on the side by robbing/killing innocent travelers. Their breakdown devolves into an utter nightmare.

""Breakdown"" brings to mind three pictures:

-- Spielberg's first TV film ""Duel"" (1971) Starring Dennis Weaver, which was perhaps the first film addressing the subject of road rage.

-- The 1975 film ""Race with the Devil"" starring Peter Fonda, which was a car chase thriller about four vacationers and their accidental run-in with a gaggle of Satanists.

-- And, lastly, the 1988/1993 film ""The Vanishing."" There are two versions with different actors (but the same director); the first taking place in Europe, the other in America. The story involves a man's obsessive search for his girlfriend who was apparently kidnapped while they were parked at a rest stop.

""Breakdown"" successfully combines elements of all three of these pictures, while remaining unique. In fact, ""Breakdown"" is arguably the best of the batch. So, if you liked any of these films, chances are you'll appreciate ""Breakdown.""

It should also be noted that the film is great for people who like desert stories or enjoy Southwest scenery.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Breakdown"" is nothing deep, but it's an intense, engaging, realistic thriller along the lines of ""Duel,"" albeit more eventful. It will definitely grab and hold your attention its entire 90 minute length. There's a great scene at the end that makes a simple statement: Some people have so foolishly opened their hearts to EVIL -- in this case greed, hate, violence and murder -- that they have BECOME hideous non-human monsters (by their own choice). For the sake of society, such people MUST be utterly wiped out from this plane of existence. Hey, ""the wages of sin is death."" Unfortunately we can't trust our ""justice"" system any longer.

One reviewer irately complained that the story is unrealistic near the beginning of the film; specifically the part where Kurt lets his wife leave with a truck driver while he stays behind to watch his vehicle. He referred to this as an incredibly stupid decision. But I personally don't see what's so ""unrealistic"" or ""stupid"" about it. They're broke down in the middle of nowhere and their phone won't work. The truck driver who offers to take them to the next stop is seemingly normal, benevolent, helpful and friendly. Both of them couldn't go because one had to stay and guard their vehicle, which contained many of their possessions (remember, they were moving). And it wouldn't have been right for Kurt to let his wife stay alone with the jeep since there was some hick nutjob roaming the local area who had harrassed them a bit earlier, not to mention they didn't have any type of weapon. It was a bad situation and Kurt chose the safest, most reasonable option available.

""Breakdown"" strangely didn't do very well at the box office in 1997. It has, however, been a bit of a hit on video/DVD since that time. Enjoy.",1184198400,23,3130,4.879472693032015

Kurt Russell is awesome...one of his best movies ever ( Be sure to check him out in any of his roles in the John Carpenter movies). JT Walsh also does a fine job as well as the rest of the cast.

The movie works because it doesn't try to be TOO serious. This is a Hollywood thriller, so the action certainly gets extravagant at points. The premise of the film is a fantastic setup.

I love films like this where the editing is paced, rather than sporadic and choppy. For instance, the scene with Kurt Russell climbing on the outside of the semi is shot masterfully. The tension is real. The supporting roles played by Kathleen Quinlan and J.T. Walsh are convincing.

This movie, considering the low price it's at these days, must be owned. It's one of Kurt Russell's best films.",1152489600,16,730,4.824

I love Kurt Russell and he's so good in this (He was also good in Unlawful Entry which was another fantastic thriller).  The only trouble I have with this, is that it's always on TV right before I'm about to do a drive from LA to Vegas and it's all too close for comfort.  J T Walsh was also great in this.  He was pure evil but also really convincing.  You have to see this movie.  I know that is a cliche but this is true.

Besides the non stop action and my level of interest not dropping even once, it was nice to see a movie that did not make my cry for two hours lost in my life, because many movies I have seen lately new or old did just that.

What makes this story so gripping is the fact that Kurt Russell's character is someone you begin to like really fast and you don't want anything happening to him. Also the action begins on a desert road, with no people around, so this reminds me of those "" lost in the woods"" story, where someone is escaping and there's not many places to hide, besides being all alone and in trouble.

When Russell's car breaks down and his wife hitches a ride with someone from around there to get help, and never comes back, he decides to take the matter into his own terms, and let me tell you, I yelled at the TV a few times, and I never do that, because he gets on a bumpy ride to discover the towns little dirty secret, and he doesn't stop.

133504,4,0792145496,"Before he directed Terminator 3, Jonathan Mostow helmed and co-wrote this taut, suspenseful, Hitchcockian nightmare about a desperate husband (Kurt Russell) whose wife (Kathleen Quinlan) disappears after their car breaks down in the desert.  A vicious truck driver (the late J.T. Walsh) is at the center of it all, and Russell will do anything to find his wife.  For being his first big budget film, Mostow masterfully weaves the nailbiting suspense with taut action, which would be a prelude to his later films U-571 and the aforementioned Terminator 3.  Russell's performance is one of the best of his career, while Walsh is perfect as the savage redneck heading an interstate kidnapping ring.  All in all, Breakdown is one of the most underrated action films you'll ever see, and while it's not perfect, it still leaves it's mark as a taut and chilling urban nightmare.",1116547200,2,872,5.034722222222222

To a large degree this is due to the power of its stars.  Kathleen Quinlan, Kurt Russel's wife, has a relatively small part by virtue of the fact the she vanishes/becomes kidnapped early in the movie.  Her presence is strong enough that when she reappears at the end, your heart goes out to the couple.  Kurt Russel is also very good as the distraught husband.  You can see his mind working to stay focused on his mission while at the same time being emotionally and physically taxed.  J.T. Walsh plays does a great job turning from the helpful trucker to  a very smary character.

The plot is quite predictable and the ending over the top, literally, and yet your really don't mind because at its heart you like it's stars.",1113523200,2,861,4.467948717948718

The film treads similar territory to ""Red Rock West,"" featuring J.T. Walsh in one of his most menacing roles--and Kurt Russell isn't half bad either as the viewpoint character.  In fact the only disappointing thing about the film is that Jonathan Mostow has not gone on to distinguish himself as an a-list director.

The plot rests on a ""city folk"" paranoia of rural places (aka ""fly-over"" country) and smells a little bit like ""Deliverance,"" a little like the early Spielberg film ""Duel.""  Throw in some psychological tension a la Hitchcock and a breathtaking climax worthy of John Woo, and you've got yourself one brilliant, unforgettable nail-biter.  As a modern, top-notch suspense film that didn't get the attention it deserved, ""Breakdown"" is in the estimable company of similar films like ""When Strangers Appear,"" ""The Trigger Effect,"" & ""Nick of Time""--if Hitch were alive today, he might be making films like this.",1105056000,2,1052,5.201183431952662
133507,5,0792145496,"This is a small film that packs a big punch, with a brilliant performance from Kurt Russell that holds our attention from start to finish.

There is a tense, ominous feeling from the start, as Russell and his wife, Kathleen Quinlan, end up stuck in the middle of nowhere, at the mercy of some menacing characters. The great J.T. Walsh plays the leader of the gang, with that perfect mixture of deviousness and cool evil he mastered in so many roles, and writer/director Jonathan Mostow has crafted a tight, well written script from his story, that though it has the occasional improbability, is plausible enough to be intelligent as well as edge-of-the-seat entertainment...because we know this kind of thing has happened to people...and it could happen to you !

Russell, as the helpless pawn of Walsh, is superb, and you see him becoming half-crazed, as he finds himself in a desert twilight zone, unable to get answers to his dilemma...the look in his eyes when Walsh tells him ""time to get the show on the road"" is a memorable moment in the film.

Quinlan looks stunning, with a natural sensuality that is a rare thing to see these days, and though her screen-time is relatively short, she is one of the ingredients that help make this film believable.

Beautiful cinematography by Doug Milstone of locations in California, Nevada and Utah, and a wonderful score Basil Poledouris add a lot to the film.

Russell is so convincing as the husband that the audience relates to his anger, frustration, and fierce dermination to get his wife back from the blackmailing kidnapping ring who abducted her.
The truck driver played by J.T. Walsh, is also excellent as the villian. Director Jonathan Mostow does an solid job with the suspense-filled action sequences. Every scene is realistic and brutal to the viewer. I especially liked the first half of the movie, when the film is sort of like of mystery because Russell cannot find his wife. The second half bogs down, but is still exciting and effective.

Walsh is an unparallelled villain, able to pull off his dastardly deeds and then go home to his wife and son.  The scene in which both he and his wife tell their little boy to kill Russell is downright horrifying.

A real highpoint is when the character Jeff Taylor stands in front of the ""Missing Persons"" board, it really hits home; my God how many people ARE disposed of in the manner suggested by Breakdown? Scary. Could happen is right. I mean what WOULD you do? Middle of nowhere, totally out of your element, battling God knows how many unseen predators in the hopes of getting back your wife? One of the few movies where you can't just say... ""Well, why doesn't he just do this or just do that?"" This character really is helpless. This movie does a lot things right, JT Walsh is harsh and plays the role perfectly, perhaps a bit too close, makes you wonder. The sound on the dvd is great, the acting by one and all is played great. I suppose the only real ""breakdown"" would be the over the top ending that could have been pulled from any 70's television show, a bit dissappointing but at the same time somehow fitting.
I could have taken a star away for lack of extras, but I know that would just bring the average down on a movie that is pretty underrated as it is, because the movie itself is one I watch over and over and the extras will be out... someday, when I'm conned into buying the next edition, which I will because Kurt is just that good:)",1056240000,,1376,4.357976653696498

133559,4,0792145496,"A youngish couple (Kurt Russell & Kathleen Quinlan) are moving from Massachusetts to California, and somewhere in the southwestern desert, their new SUV breaks down.  A friendly trucker comes along, offers help, and Quinlan accepts a ride to a nearby diner to call for help while Russell waits with the car.  He gets the car started on his own, and heads to the diner.  His wife is nowhere to be found, and when Russell catches up with the trucker, the trucker denies any knowledge of the knowing him or his wife.
That's the setup that takes place in the first twenty minutes or so.  After that, BREAKDOWN is a thriller as Russell, a meek man driver by desparation, tries to figure out what has happened to his wife with very little evidence to go on.  There are chase scenes galore.
The situation is actually quite preposterous, and gets more so as the movie goes along.  The scheme that is uncovered is very elaborate, and seems like an awful lot of trouble for the culprits to go through.  But Kurt Russell is so down to earth and believable, and the bad guys actually quite mundane, that the plot somehow doesn't seem totally ridiculous.  The movie, obviously fairly low budget, is gritty and not too glossy.  There aren't too many explosions, but there are PLENTY of cliffhangers, and because we can so readily identify with Russell's character, thanks to his convincing performance, we really feel for him and what he is going through.  Situations that might seem like minor jeopardy in something more grandiose (like a DIE HARD movie, perhaps) are very tense and exciting in BREAKDOWN.
As I said, Russell is very good.  It's interesting that this actor, who has been ""famous"" since a teen, is so convincing playing an ""everyman"" type.  He's handsome, but not too much so, and when he runs around crazily, or is involved in a chase scene, he doesn't just suddenly develop amazing abilities.  He looks scared, dirty, sweaty and ticked off.  He is a man driven by shear fear for his wife, and anger.  It's a convincing performance,and one of his best.
Quinlan, who understandably isn't in much of the movie, is also very good, and is a convincing match with Russell.  JT Walsh, the main bad guy, is very good because he never really drops the veneer of being a regular guy,except in a couple of scenes.  This was the wonderful character actor's last movie, and he left with a doozy.
This movie didn't do to well at the box office, but word of mouth has really helped it out on video.  If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it.  It is rated R, but the main reason for that is not graphic violence (there's not much blood, really) but just an occasional outburst of bad language.

Playing the well-to-do everyman Kurt puts in his best performance as a man desperately searching for his wife when she disappears after getting a ride with a seemingly samaritan like truck driver after their new vehicle breaks down.
In the arid Arizona desert,totally out of his element,Jeffreys ever deepening concern and almost maniacal outbursts at unhelpful(almost sinister) locals are totally believable,and as the conspiracy slowly unwinds like a stressed piano wire you really begin to feel his anguish.
The main villian here is played by the late great J T Walsh,his character Warren 'Red' Barr oozing smarm like mollasses under the scorching sun. This is truly a cold and calculating criminal,and his partners in crime(a particulary nasty M C Gainey and a bratty Jack Noseworthy) are equally unlikable. You just PRAY something bad will happen to them.
The tension builds to an almost unbearable climax as a car chase ensues from Warrens farmstead and ends...well...in a precarious way shall we say. This is my only gripe with the film,some of the scenes here are a little OTT but it ends well with a slow zoom out of the landscape into the credits.

133593,5,0792145496,"Engaging, curious, suspenseful, BELIEVABLE. All of these words describe director Jonathan Mostow's creepy suspense film ""Breakdown"". This is Mostow's first major feature film and he does not disappoint. In fact, Breakdown is easily one of the best thrillers in recent years. Mostow, through his beautiful use of camera, color, and character, leads us on the frightening journey of a Massachusetts couple who find themselves stranded in the middle of nowhere Arizona/New Mexico/Utah-a rather common occurance on long-distance trips. Yet, all is not as it seems. Unfortunately, some reviewers here have thrown in a lot of spoilers. Hopefully you read this review and not the others...
There are a number of items which raise this film above the rest of the average thriller drivel...
1. The gorgeous scenery of the desert. The juxtaposition of the beautiful desert and the experiences of the main characters(which are decidedly 'un-beautiful') only serve to heighten our sense that 'something is not quite right.'
2. A great script without filler. No holds barred, unrelenting, and to-the-point. Thank you very much.
3. Wonderful acting by Kurt Russell. I am not a big fan of his, but this film made me re-examine some of his others. He IS this character. Just the right blend of fright, anger, determination, and anxiety make this probably his best performance on film. I can't conceive of anyone else playing this role. He is the 'every man' that the audience relates to/with.
4. Excellent supporting cast including the late, great JT Walsh as the helpful truck driver. Director's pray for casts that gel as this one did. Every character is utterly believable.
5. A creepy soundtrack that both serves, and drives the film.
I would like to address the few naysayers who say that the film is unbelievable. I am dumbfounded by that statement. What is unbelievable about one person's phone working and another person's phone not working in the same area? I guess the reviewer I have in mind has never dealt with cellular service or analogue vs. digital phones! You know, some providers DON'T OFFER SERVICE IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE COUNTRY. Also, how in the world, by ANY standard is Russell's acting unrealistic!? It's easy to judge what someone in his situation in the film 'should have done'. But of course, as viewers of the film, OUR assumption UP FRONT is that THIS IS A BAD IDEA. When you saw the preview for this film in the theater or read the box at the video store you KNEW it was about a trip gone wrong! Duh. But put yourself in his shoes. Plus, his wife OFFERED to go!
So I put the question to you ladies out there: in a similar situation, would you accept a ride from a 'kindly' stranger who offered to take you just up the road to a diner? I think the negative reviewers would be surprised by many of the responses....Let's see, what else is unbelievable? Cops who second-guess the accuser? Oh no...that NEVER happens in real life! Small towns in the middle of nowhere with strange people calling them home? Nope. Don't know ANY of those (ever been down south!?). A group of guys who conspire to take advantage of travelers in the middle of nowhere? That never happens either does it!?
My point is that on the reality scale this film scores high marks-THAT IS WHY IT IS UNNERVING TO WATCH. In the back of our minds we all know that there is a small possibility of something like this happening. Guys, just think of what YOU would go through if your wife disappeared! (Actually, some of you might not mind. Maybe I should rephrase the question...) Finally, the ending of the film is somewhat controversial. Several major film critics seemed to think it crossed some sort of ethical line, an unspoken film taboo. I found the end extremely satisfying. Worked great for me. If I was in Russell's position I believe I would have had my wife do the same thing...",1028678400,2,3866,4.780269058295964
133594,5,0792145496,"Breakdown smoothly sucks you in, with an ""it could happen to your"" storyline that swiftly takes you on a twisted and suspenseful journey, following a man frantically trying to find his missing wife.
All-American type Kurt Russell is Jeff Taylor, driving cross country with wife Amy (Kathleen Quinlan) in their new Jeep Grand Cherokee.  The couple is on their way from Boston to San Diego, when their vehicle breaks down somewhere in the Southwest (Arizona?), along a deserted stretch of road.  A passing trucker named Red Barr (J. T. Walsh) offers to lend a hand, and Amy leaves with him to call a tow truck while Jeff waits with the car.
Taylor gets his car started and arrives at the roadside stop where his wife was to have called for help, but she is nowhere to be found.  Spotting Barr's truck on the road, he forces him to stop, but the trucker denies ever having seen him before.  A passing sheriff intervenes, but a search of the truck reveals nothing.  Taylor files a police report and returns to the roadside stop to await developments.  From there, he is put through his worst nightmare, discovering that he and his wife, are the victims of a predatory gang of thieves, kidnappers and probable killers.
The late J. T. Walsh is marvelously slimy, as the despicable leader of the group.  The actors playing the other members of the gang do such a wonderful job as subhuman members of society, they could be poster boys for different breeds of lowlife.  Kurt Russell delivers a near perfect performance as a man pushed well beyond the normal limits.  Kathleen Quinlan's screen time is limited, but she is there to deliver a crushing and well deserved coup de grace.
Breakdown is tight, a film of continuous action, where the plot proceeds smartly with hardly a misstep.

Not knowing anything of what happened, or what to do, is as scary and heartbreaking as can be. That's the plot to this intense and incredibly entertaining movie from 1997. Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan star as a couple on a cross country trip who run into some car trouble out in the middle of nowhere. They flag down a truck coming their way and a trucker named Red Barr(played by the great J.T. Walsh)climbs out and offers to help. He offers to drive them into town to use the phone but Russell doesn't want to leave the car. The wife goes with the trucker and he stays with the car. When he gets to the diner where they are supposed to meet, she isn't there and no one has seen her or the trucker. He spots the trucker and stops him but the trucker insists he has never laid eyes on him before in his life. Russell can't believe what he's hearing. His wife, Amy, has vanished. He is then captured by some criminals and is brought to the trucker, who seems to want Russell's money in exchange for his wife. This leads our devoted husband on a chase across the middle of nowhere in hopes of dodging the bad guys and finding his wife, if, in fact, she is still alive. I enjoy 'road thrillers' like this and ""The Hitcher"" and ""Joy Ride"". This one is wonderfully done. The idea of the husband letting his wife go off with a stranger in the middle of nowhere is downright stupid, I'll give you that, but there wouldn't of been a movie without it. This is just entertainment folks. Kurt Russell is really good in this. He is very believeable as a husband who is mortified, scared, and determined to find his wife. He jumps from all kinds of emotions and does them all so realistically. Trust me, he does, no matter what some bubblehead on the next page or so says. One of his better jobs. Then there is the great J.T. Walsh. He was one of our finest character actors. This was one of his final film roles before he died of a heart attack. What a tremendous loss. He is fantastic here.

133633,5,0792145496,"""Breakdown"" is a thriller about a couple whose car breaks down in the middle of the desert in the West. Out in the middle of nowhere, the wife hitches a ride with a truck driver, but never returns.
Director Jonathon Mostow has certainly created a terrific little thriller here, infusing his scenes with genuine suspense, and a mystery surrounding the wife's disappearance that progresses very nicely. Under some very powerful performances from Kurt Russell and J.T. Walsh, this action film has a lot to offer.
The movie begins with a near-accident between a Jeep and a pickup truck. In the Jeep are Jeff and Amy Taylor (Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan), a married couple moving from Massachusetts to San Diego, who are confronted by the man in the pickup when they stop at a gas station. Passing it off, they continue on their way, only to experience car trouble soon after. Luckily, a semi pulls up, offering them a ride. Amy goes, and Jeff stays behind to watch the car.
When his wife does not come back, he finally realizes the car's malfunction (obviously not a mechanically inclined person), and makes his way to any place he can find, stopping at a small cafe to inquire about his wife's whereabouts; they know nothing. He catches up to Red Barr (J.T. Walsh), the man driving the semi, but Barr denies even knowing who he is as a cop searches the truck and finds nothing, no traceable evidence of Amy.
So where is she? The movie keeps us at bay for quite a while, allowing Kurt Russell to give us some very dynamic acting as he plays out all of Jeff's inner collapses and states of confusion. Russell has always been good at playing the action hero, but here, he is the one being chased, the one being toyed with, and in this interesting turn of events, he pulls it off successfully, convincing us of his emotional drive to find his missing wife.
J.T. Walsh is equally impressive as Warren (a.k.a. Red Barr), who, along with his road pals (including the man in the pickup from the beginning), have plans in store for Jeff, the pawn in their lethal game of chess. Walsh was gifted with one of those faces, those strong, stern faces that could cause mountains to crumble at a mere glance. Here, he is harsh and overbearing, fitting the role with an unsettling ease.
As the mystery unfolds, the action begins. Russell is in even finer form during the film's second half, as he gets involved in a high-speed chase and must figure out a way to elude his pursuants. I'm going to do my best not to give away their intentions, which may come as a letdown to some, given the initial paths the story takes, but the commencing action and breath-holding finale are a tour de force of thrills, chases, and suspense-packed action.
At the helm of this project is director Jonathon Mostow, who uses his photography to add to the intensity of the story. Here, he chooses to surround us with wide open spaces to convey to emptiness and vastness of the western terrain, adding to the overwhelming sense of dread that Jeff must be feeling in search of his wife. He also puts us right in the middle of some very intense car chases, and a scene involving Jeff making his way along the bottom of a moving truck is full of tension.
If you are able to break down the mystery behind ""Breakdown,"" you may be at a loss. But the movie does a pretty good job of keeping it hidden from a mainstream audience, and those in the mood for a story that keeps you waiting will find pleasure in its many exciting twists. The action is intense and involving (I almost cheered at the closing credits), and Mostow knows what he is doing, as do the cast members. I had a large smile on my face after this film, a smile of satisfaction that very few movies have ever put on my face.",996796800,6,3747,4.50367107195301
133634,5,0792145496,"During the summer of '97, a summer that gave us great movies like THE LOST WORLD, CONTACT, and AIR FORCE ONE, certainly there was room for BREAKDOWN, wasn't there?  How in the world could so well-made a thriller as this one was escape everyone's notice?
Kurt Russell is this film's Everyman, who is travelling with his wife (Kathleen Quinlan) from New England to San Diego, when they run afoul of a redneck gang in the Utah hinterlands.  One of them sets the trap for Russell's Jeep to break down, and then the leader of the gang (J.T. Walsh, chillingly despicable as always) abducts Quinlan and forces Russell to wire $90,000 as ransom for his wife's return.  Naturally, this is money that he doesn't have.
After having to endure so much abuse from Walsh's sadistic underlings (the ""rich a**holes lookin' for trouble"" line really got my blood boiling, let me tell you!), however, Russell finally fights back and takes matters into his own hands, leading to a ferocious high-speed showdown.
Much has been said about the fact that director and co-writer Jonathan Mostow borrows greatly from other movies.  This is true, but at least he has the good sense to borrow from some excellent ones: DUEL, STRAW DOGS, DELIVERANCE, THE VANISHING.  Russell's performance (as had been the case in TOMBSTONE) is exceptional; and Quinlan, though she isn't seen that much onscreen, still plays an important part because of Russell's ever-increasing concern for her life as the film progresses.  Walsh and his band of redneck pirates (including M.C. Gainey and Jack Noseworthy) rank right up there with the redneck rapists of DELIVERANCE and the bounty hunters from THE WILD BUNCH as the ultimate cinematic villains.
Brilliantly photographed by Douglas Milsome (a veteran of Stanley Kubrick's films; he lensed FULL METAL JACKET) and shot mostly on locations in Arizona, Utah, Nevada, and southwestern California, BREAKDOWN remains one of the most underappreciated thrillers of all times.  Hopefully, however, that status will change.  It is a worthy addition to the thriller genre.",996019200,,2064,5.103857566765579
133635,5,0792145496,"In 1997 I had the misfortune of seeing the coming attractions trailer for BREAKDOWN, a film with Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan, two performers I have always liked and respected.  I groaned - this film looked like just another run-of-the-mill, headache-inducing, Jerry Bruckheimer over-the-top actionfest with absolutely no basis in reality.  Foolishly, I avoided this film until I found myself at a drive-in Scottsdale, AZ.  BREAKDOWN was just about the only movie on the list that looked remotely interesting, though I had sincere doubts.  Reluctantly, I paid admission, fearing the worst.
Oh, my God, was I wrong.  What a movie!!!  My initial reservations about this film were completely erased halfway through the story.  Years of watching ludicrous testosterone-driven action epics with amusement park-like thrills almost prevented me from seeing one of the best films of the 1990's.  I watched the film from the hood of my rental car.  I thought the paint would permanently adhere to my sweaty palms.
BREAKDOWN is a near masterpiece.  To disclose the plot would destroy a nail-biting motion picture experience.  In fact, be warned, as the film is almost too gripping to be enjoyable.  There is such an overwhelming sense of menace and peril in this film that it almost becomes a cruel experiment in fear.
For a first-time directing job by Jonathan Mostow, it's awe-inspiring.  The opening credits sequence alone is imaginative and appropriate to the story.  It has been a longtime indeed since this level of suspense has seen the light of day on the silver screen.  It's so good, in fact, that it's hard to believe that it ever got made.  Amazing that it was not the blockbuster that it deserved to be.
Shooting in the 2.35:1 Panavision ratio, Mr. Mostow has created an unbelievably plausible scenario replete with three of the most frightening villians the movies have ever seen.  They certainly give Bill McKinney and Herbert ""Cowboy"" Coward, the mountain men in DELIVERANCE, a run for their money.  J. T. Walsh, who unfortunately passed away not too long after this film was released (his death is a real loss to the film world), appears in probably the best performance of his career: a purely evil man who doubles as an everyday Joe who loves his wife and son but commits terrible acts for money.  M. C. Gainey, a towering giant who could rip you in half with his own two hands, is brilliant as Earl, one of the conspirators. You would not want to cross this man.  Jack Noseworthy is equally maniacal as the third villian.
BREAKDOWN succeeds for the same reason that Steven Spielberg's DUEL does (though DUEL is more cinematic): it takes two ordinary human beings and thrusts them into a horrendous situation they'd never have any reason to suspect they'd ever be a part of.  That is not to say that the film does not have a few convenient plot devices, but even when it does they can be forgiven.
Kurt Russell - my God, he's just brilliant.  I loved him as Snake Plissken in JOHN CARPENTER'S ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK.  He's such an amazing actor.  The look of terror and fear on his face is complete and real.  Basil Poledouris, who scored CONAN THE BARBARIAN, one of the best scores of the 1980's, provides a tremendous score to this film.  The tension in the sequence prior to the unbelievably tense and superbly edited ending is made all the more so due to his phenomenal score.
Although I have a slight problem with the ending (it contains a few elements that are farfetched), it still remains one of the most gripping action sequences your likely to see in any film.
I cannot say enough about this film.  It's completely riveting from start to finish, and is one of only a handful of 1990's films that I can watch over and over again.  The week that I purchased the DVD I watched the film six times.  I was just as engrossed as I was upon my initial viewing.
The DVD looks and sounds great, though the lack of anamorphic enhancement is disappointing.  Hopefully, Paramount will re-issue this title soon with a commentary by the director.  Recall that DVDs were fairly new when this film was released.  This film is far superior to Mr. Mostow's submarine film U-571.  I'd love to hear his thoughts on the casting and comments on the making of the film.
One major warning: Do not watch this film on television.  It's been on TV twice, and it's completely ruined.  Commercials cause this film to break down (sorry - couldn't resist).
If I could give this film ten stars, I would.  Watch it.  It's brilliant.",984528000,5,4520,4.7560975609756095
133636,4,0792145496,"Breakdown seems to have slipped through the cracks over the years. It was a Number 1 hit when released in theatres in May 1997, though, bizarrely, it took a whole year to reach the UK when I saw it in May 1998. Kind of odd for a successful film with a big-name star. Produced and financed by Dino DeLaurentis, Breakdown was released by Paramount in the US and Fox in the UK. I guess the rights are stuck in a loophole, it's the only reason I can think of as to why it's currently out-of-print.

Kurt Russell is Jeff Taylor, a man traveling across America with his hot wife. In the last leg of their Boston-San Diego move, their car freezes-up and stops dead by the road. A friendly trucker offers them help. Hot wife goes off with him to get a tow-truck. She doesn't return. Jeff, panic increasing by the second, tracks down the trucker, Warren 'Red' Barr (played by the late JT Walsh), but the man denies ever meeting him or his wife. Panic turns to anger, and anger turns to terror, as Jeff is hurled into a kidnap/ransom plot. With no one to turn to for help he has to use his wits and rely on chance to turn the tables on the bad guys.

At a stripped-down, incredibly terse 93 minutes, Breakdown wastes no time with long set-ups. There are no long speeches, no unnecessary deviations, just action and suspense. Kurt Russell carries much of the film with facial expressions. Though I have to say I wish Jonathan Mostow kept a tighter reign on his acting, as he tend to overdo it a bit. Plus some of his dialogue is repetitive and cliched. Yes, there are a few plot holes and gaps in the logic (the useless cop cliche really gets on my nerves) but at such a brisk pace the film doesn't have time to dwell on them.

With shades of Duel, Deliverance, and the Vanishing, Breakdown offers a few exciting car chases, lonely desert locations, and one hell of an evil villain. If you can find it, don't hesitate to invest the time and money.

The DVD from Paramount was released in the latter part of 1998 and is long OOP. It featured a terrible, non-anamorphic picture with Dolby 5.1 sound and no features. Somebody somewhere should buy the rights and make a Blu Ray.",983836800,12,2163,4.386533665835412
133637,4,0792145496,This movie is one the most entertaining movies around without a doubt .  Watch this movie on Video or on cable or something because there is alot of entertaining fowel language.

133638,4,0792145496,"Some of the good things about this movie, among others, are 1) it's very believable, 2) it doesn't have all those overly done, mind-blowing, hi-tech action sequences, 3) the acting are as good as it gets, 4) it keeps you on your seat without slowing down the pace.  IMO these are some of the most important elements of a good movie.",976665600,,332,4.442622950819672
133639,5,0792145496,"... as you can tell from the other reviews.  This is one of my Top 10 movies and I felt I had to throw out my own two cents about this review.  I think what makes this special is that most viewers can relate to this movie in many aspects-- the simplicity of the situation (your car breaks down and your wife is missing after being picked up by a friendly trucker), the frustration of Kurt Russell's character, the type of setting (towns, lifestyle).  ""Breakdown"" doesn't have the amazing stunts that most Hollywood flicks are putting out these days but it IS just as effective.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat and while it doesn't take more than once to ""get"" (like some movies!), this movie has all the elements that will make you want to see it again.",975974400,2,764,4.321678321678322
133659,5,0792145496,"Johnathan Mostow directed this suspense-filled, high octane thriller about  a married couple (Kurt Russell, Kathleen Quinlan) who drive through the  Utah Desert, and all of a sudden, their car breaks down. Russell and  Quinlan encounter some hooligans along the way who are looking for trouble  (M.C. Gainey, J.T. Walsh, Jack Noseworthy). What this all makes for is a  suspensful an hour-and-a-half movie from start to finish. So, please rush  out and buy yourself a copy of ""Breakdown"". And, don't leave your  car hood open when you go in the store. Free ""rich a**holes looking  for trouble"" bumper sticker with every purchase!",968803200,,628,5.148514851485149
133660,5,0792145496,"Kurt Russell is one of my favorite actors. Unfortunately, to a lot of people this is like saying that MD 20/20 is one of your favorite wines.  Kurt Russell seems to get less respect than Rodney Dangerfield, even though  Kurt is demonstrably more talented and charismatic than a lot of actors  with Oscars on their mantelpieces. It's true he's made some bad choices  (don't get me started on ""Stargate"" or ""Captain Ron""),  but really, when you look at other prominent leading actors, have Kurt's  choices been all that much worse than theirs? In any case,  ""Breakdown"" is a prime example of what Kurt can do when given a  decent role. The movie is exciting and well-shot, with superb character  actors like the late J.T. Walsh in support, but it is Kurt's performance  which makes this movie, and it is impossible to imagine any other actor in  the role. ""Breakdown"" speaks to Kurt's great strengths as an  actor: his subtle expressivity, his ability to gain the sympathy of the  audience without overtly playing for it, and his astonishing athleticism  (Kurt did nearly all his own stunts for this movie, some of which would  make Evel Knievel blanch). The next time you're about to say, ""Kurt  Russell? Boo! Send him back to Mickey Mouse!"" watch this movie  instead, and you'll gladly eat your words.",967334400,2,1301,4.788288288288288

133666,5,0792145496,"I was lucky enough to see this film at the cinema. It did not do too well, perhaps because it was better than your average gung-ho action flicks which tend to dominate.
Instead, ""Breakdown"", has a good story which  builds up at a fair pace. Before long the film accelerates into top gear.  The pace and the tension ensure that this film rises above the usual  thrillers. A well written script also ensures that it rarely becomes  predictable. This is still a highly watchable film and the tension never  lets up.
The principal cast - Russell and Walsh are excellent and make  for a wonderful combination.
This is also a good quality DVD, an  excellent transfer - good picture and sound.
