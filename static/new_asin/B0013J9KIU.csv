3112384,2,B0013J9KIU,"First off, let me say, this movie was not exactly good. All the performers did what they could, but they couldn't make up for the rotten script. It had it's funny moments, but they couldn't make up for the poorly written script. The only reason I bought this movie was because Ivana Milicevic was in it, and she's my favorite actress, so basically I watch anything that she's in. You can imagine my dissapointment when I noticed that she was left off the DVD cover and replaced by Jenny McCarthy, just because she is a bigger name, and the studio felt that her image would sell more copies of this lackluster movie. I thought that this was incredibly unfair to Ivana Milicevic, who in all reality is the female lead in this movie, not to mention also a better actress, and a Hell of a lot classier and prettier than Jenny McCarthy, (which says a lot because Jenny's a ten in the looks department.) Well that's Coporprate America for you, compromise integrity and decency to make a buck. All in all, Parallel Entertainment Pictures really screwed its star here and they owe her a huge apology. Although this movie is not very good, true (male) fans of Ms. Milicevic's will still enjoy this movie, especially Chapter 14 from 1:14:41 to 1:14:55 (you'll see what I mean), because as in all her movies, she's FRIGGING HOT!!!!

Not one smile did I crack.  I've been known to smile at funerals,  I'll have ya' know.
The ""trick"" casting is inept and his jokes and gags fall as flat as a pancake.
This film isn't even worthy of renting.
Beware of boredom.  I truly want my time and money back on this loaded production of nothingness.",1213228800,4,355,4.333333333333333
3112387,3,B0013J9KIU,"I'm about to commit some kind of sacrilege.  I love Larry the Cable Guy, I stuck up for his past few movies, which got almost panned across the board and I really was hoping that this third time would be the charm, that a few critics would lighten up and the movie would draw some decent cash.  Sadly that is not the case and I am about to half heartedly recommend Larry's newest movie.

Larry here (still playing himself so arguably his presence is a natural one) is a small town deputy sheriff who is in training to be an FBI agent.  He's in a cafe chatting away with his pals and his gal Connie when an SUV filled with suits suddenly pulls over for a break and among the group is Madeline, whom Larry believes has been kidnapped.  Smelling not a fart, but an opportunity to prove himself of being an FBI agent follows the SUV and takes the girl Madeline, only problem is that she is WITH the FBI and now he kidnapped her.  Larry however remains convinced that she was kidnapped and builds his evidence along the way to a conclusion where hilarity doesn't ensue.

Why not?  Admittedly Larry's catchphrases and shtick which play better on stage are wearing out at the theater and Madeline actually gets better lines then Larry does which shouldn't happen. Madelin and Larry's chemsitry is weird too, a proper European woman with a Southern Bumpkin who warm up to each other chugs with a the grace of a dying Chevy.  No one scene in Witless Protection really soars or made me laugh out loud either, some scenes just play out with lines I know are supposed to be funny but didn't work.  The polo match where Larry bull in a chinas hops his way to a win is the only case and that was slight.  A fist fight in a museum room could have been great but also misses.

By the way, did I mention Yaphet Kotto's character name is the same here as it was in the vastly superior Midnight Run?  Thats a crime.

Larry, I love you but this movie wasn't that great.  It was better a movie then I thought it would be, but it's not as funny as it should have been.  At least for Larry's crybaby audience his gay/foreigner humor is toned down, which is good, but people will still whine at what is left in the movie, especially Larry's attempt to get a hotel room.  Irregardless the film wasn't as funny as it should have been and I'm afraid that if another Larry movie tanks, his screen name could be Larry the Direct to home Video Guy.",1204070400,9,2418,4.325942350332594

3112519,1,B0013J9KIU,"I gave this movie the beneifit of the doubt because I love slapstick and Larry is very amusing on the ""Blue Collar Comedy Tour"". Larry did not transition well onto the big screen. When I think of redneck, slapstick, sweet and funny with the underdog as the hero, my mind immediately goes to Jim Varney's 'Ernest P. Worrell', whose shoes Larry or other rednecks or redneck wannabes, will never be able to fill. I can't be the only one who sees Larry's attempts to mirror the lovable hayseed, Ernest. There is the hat, the accent, the clothes, the stand-up comedy then moving over into movies. This movie has too much crude humor and disgusting bathroom jokes and there is no excuse for the racist comments, especially in a movie such as this. The(dare I say it?) plot was weaker than the pulse of a comatose patient.*(And I am not making light of people who have suffered or are suffering through this.) ""Witless Protection"" has deterred me from watching any of the other Larry movies. I think it's best for him to stick to stand-up comedy, which does work better for him. I'm from the South and I think that Larry does give us a bad name. You can do comedy without making fun of other races, sexual orientation or using over the top sexual comments and bathroom humor(One fart joke will do, sometimes). Is this what has become of America? Have we really sunk so low that every ridiculous script/movie is greelighted just because of a t.v. personalities' previous work? A good stand-up comedian doesn't necessarily translate to a good movie actor. Some people have it. Some don't. Larry doesn't.",1348876800,2,1594,4.696428571428571
3112520,3,B0013J9KIU,"The overall movie is average.  The storyline, picture quality, sound quality, and acting is nothing special.  I do however give this movie three stars because I do think that Larry the Cable Guy is a very funny comedian.  If you want to watch a movie in  your man cave with the guys then this movie would be alright to get.

Your brain capacity is too low to handle funny comedy, and I think that this is a seriously important issue, that there are people out there not smart enough to enjoy Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. Everybody who likes this movie is an idiot, and you need to stop watching movies until you are forced to see The Godfather so many times that the definition of a great film is implanted inside your brain.",1328140800,,619,4.166666666666667

3112527,3,B0013J9KIU,"If you are planning on picking up ""Witless Protection"", then I would say it's a fair guess your not hoping for a film full of witty, dry or subtle humor. My guess is you want something that will allow you to turn off your brain for 90 minutes and have a few chuckles. If you are like me, and enjoy a good fart joke then ""Witless Protection"" isn't a bad little flick. If you are looking for something a little deeper, maybe you should keep looking.

Larry the Cable Guy plays a clueless small town deputy who forces his way into an FBI Witness Protection job when he believes a woman passing through town is being kidnapped. The meager plot is simply a place setting which allows Larry to interact with uptight FBI agents, pompous rich folks, hit men and assorted other fish-out-of-water stereotypes so often found in this type of flick.

I got some great laughs out of this movie, like when Larry has to go through airport security or when he's trying to pay for a hotel room with cash and argues with the hotel manager. There are tons of little one liners sprinkled throughout the film that will keep a smile on your face.

So would I recommend this movie? Sure, as long as you put your brain in neutral, don't go into ""Witless Protection"" expecting a hilarious ""Animal House""-like film. Just sit back and enjoy Larry being Larry.",1250553600,,1331,4.491735537190083

Anyway, the script was really bad.  There were some funny moments, but for the most part there were just corny jokes constantly that didn't get a laugh out of my husband or I.  Surely this movie will be left in our album to collect dust and never see the light of day again.

Larry Stalder is a small town sheriff's deputy with a sagging midsection and a grandiose dream of one day becoming an agent for the FBI.  He doesn't exactly enhance his chances of fulfilling that dream when he ""rescues"" a woman whom he mistakenly believes has been kidnapped by what he thinks is a gang of sunglass-wearing mobsters.  In actuality, they are federal agents transporting a whistle-blower to a trial in Chicago where her testimony could spell big trouble for a powerful, Enron-type CEO with whom she was once romantically involved.  A lengthy cross country chase ensues with the agents hot on the heels of this nitwit law enforcer and his unwitting ""hostage.""

Armed with crime-fighting knowledge he's gleaned primarily from cable TV, and with a malapropism for every occasion, Larry bumbles his way from one outlandish situation to the next, somehow managing to stay one step ahead of the authorities at all times.

Larry the Cable Guy has that rare ability to perform low comedy routines without having to resort to self-conscious mugging to garner laughs.  Likewise, Ivana Milicevic, Eric Roberts, Joe Mantegna, Jenny McCarthy and a whole host of other comic actors throw themselves into their roles with a great deal of abandon and aplomb.

The humor is broad (to put it mildly), but it is more often fleet-footed than flatfooted, and the whole enterprise is so dopey and good-natured that you may just find yourself chuckling right along with all the goofiness - provided, that is, you can put your brain on hold for the full hour-and-a-half that the movie takes to play itself out.",1230768000,,1608,4.973880597014926

He told a group of us at the wrap party for this film (I play Elmer -the crazy dude in the barn)that he writes every night. Usually a story. As he's writing he might come up with a joke or two which he saves. A few jokes a night every night of the year and you've got yourself a pretty good library of jokes.

Again we are treated to idiotic one liners, bodily function jokes, redneck patriotism, and bumbling incompetance. Much like the Three Stooges or Inspector Cleuseu, no matter how idiotic the hero is, he always beats the bad guys. I love slapstick and sight gag humor, but a naked Larry the Cable Guy getting a body cavity search is just too much, even for his biggest fans. The only real redeaming thing about this movie is that Jeff Foxworthy did NOT make a cameo.

So what kind of film is this? Larry is a small town deputy who dreams of becoming an FBI agent. So in an attempt to make his dream come true, he kidnaps a witness from FBI protection. He then decides to take her to CHicago himself to testify. Of course we have some corrupt agents which does nothing but stretch this movie out another unbearable 30 minutes. There;s really nothing else to say about the movie except that it sucks and Larry's constant one liners just make the film that much painful.",1218067200,2,1123,4.478048780487805

I must say that this movie is a little more funny that Delta Farce. It is well-casted and had some great, funny moments.  The humor surrounding the FBI agents was pretty good (i.e., an agents whose last name is Orange, so ""Agent Orange"") and it was great to see Yaphett Kotto after not seeing him in a movie for more than 5 years. Also, seeing Eric Roberts roam around in a jacket with the large letters ""PMS"" was pretty fair, too.  I think you really need to be in a certain mood when taking in a new movie.

3346884,3,B0013J9KIU,"I'm about to commit some kind of sacrilege.  I love Larry the Cable Guy, I stuck up for his past few movies, which got almost panned across the board and I really was hoping that this third time would be the charm, that a few critics would lighten up and the movie would draw some decent cash.  Sadly that is not the case and I am about to half heartedly recommend Larry's newest movie.

Larry here (still playing himself so arguably his presence is a natural one) is a small town deputy sheriff who is in training to be an FBI agent.  He's in a cafe chatting away with his pals and his gal Connie when an SUV filled with suits suddenly pulls over for a break and among the group is Madeline, whom Larry believes has been kidnapped.  Smelling not a fart, but an opportunity to prove himself of being an FBI agent follows the SUV and takes the girl Madeline, only problem is that she is WITH the FBI and now he kidnapped her.  Larry however remains convinced that she was kidnapped and builds his evidence along the way to a conclusion where hilarity doesn't ensue.

Why not?  Admittedly Larry's catchphrases and shtick which play better on stage are wearing out at the theater and Madeline actually gets better lines then Larry does which shouldn't happen. Madelin and Larry's chemsitry is weird too, a proper European woman with a Southern Bumpkin who warm up to each other chugs with a the grace of a dying Chevy.  No one scene in Witless Protection really soars or made me laugh out loud either, some scenes just play out with lines I know are supposed to be funny but didn't work.  The polo match where Larry bull in a chinas hops his way to a win is the only case and that was slight.  A fist fight in a museum room could have been great but also misses.

By the way, did I mention Yaphet Kotto's character name is the same here as it was in the vastly superior Midnight Run?  Thats a crime.

Larry, I love you but this movie wasn't that great.  It was better a movie then I thought it would be, but it's not as funny as it should have been.  At least for Larry's crybaby audience his gay/foreigner humor is toned down, which is good, but people will still whine at what is left in the movie, especially Larry's attempt to get a hotel room.  Irregardless the film wasn't as funny as it should have been and I'm afraid that if another Larry movie tanks, his screen name could be Larry the Direct to home Video Guy.",1204070400,9,2418,4.325942350332594

Larry did not transition well onto the big screen. When I think of redneck, slapstick, sweet and funny with the underdog as the hero, my mind immediately goes to Jim Varney's 'Ernest P. Worrell', whose shoes Larry or other rednecks or redneck wannabes, will never be able to fill. I can't be the only one who sees Larry's attempts to mirror the lovable hayseed, Ernest. There is the hat, the accent, the clothes, the stand-up comedy then moving over into movies. This movie has too much crude humor and disgusting bathroom jokes and there is no excuse for the racist comments, especially in a movie such as this. The(dare I say it?) plot was weaker than the pulse of a comatose patient.*(And I am not making light of people who have suffered or are suffering through this.) ""Witless Protection"" has deterred me from watching any of the other Larry movies. I think it's best for him to stick to stand-up comedy, which does work better for him. I'm from the South and I think that Larry does give us a bad name. You can do comedy without making fun of other races, sexual orientation or using over the top sexual comments and bathroom humor(One fart joke will do, sometimes). Is this what has become of America? Have we really sunk so low that every ridiculous script/movie is greelighted just because of a t.v. personalities' previous work?

3347024,3,B0013J9KIU,"If you are planning on picking up ""Witless Protection"", then I would say it's a fair guess your not hoping for a film full of witty, dry or subtle humor. My guess is you want something that will allow you to turn off your brain for 90 minutes and have a few chuckles. If you are like me, and enjoy a good fart joke then ""Witless Protection"" isn't a bad little flick. If you are looking for something a little deeper, maybe you should keep looking.

Larry the Cable Guy plays a clueless small town deputy who forces his way into an FBI Witness Protection job when he believes a woman passing through town is being kidnapped. The meager plot is simply a place setting which allows Larry to interact with uptight FBI agents, pompous rich folks, hit men and assorted other fish-out-of-water stereotypes so often found in this type of flick.

I got some great laughs out of this movie, like when Larry has to go through airport security or when he's trying to pay for a hotel room with cash and argues with the hotel manager. There are tons of little one liners sprinkled throughout the film that will keep a smile on your face.

So would I recommend this movie? Sure, as long as you put your brain in neutral, don't go into ""Witless Protection"" expecting a hilarious ""Animal House""-like film. Just sit back and enjoy Larry being Larry.",1250553600,,1331,4.491735537190083

Anyway, the script was really bad.  There were some funny moments, but for the most part there were just corny jokes constantly that didn't get a laugh out of my husband or I.  Surely this movie will be left in our album to collect dust and never see the light of day again.

Larry Stalder is a small town sheriff's deputy with a sagging midsection and a grandiose dream of one day becoming an agent for the FBI.  He doesn't exactly enhance his chances of fulfilling that dream when he ""rescues"" a woman whom he mistakenly believes has been kidnapped by what he thinks is a gang of sunglass-wearing mobsters.  In actuality, they are federal agents transporting a whistle-blower to a trial in Chicago where her testimony could spell big trouble for a powerful, Enron-type CEO with whom she was once romantically involved.  A lengthy cross country chase ensues with the agents hot on the heels of this nitwit law enforcer and his unwitting ""hostage.""

Armed with crime-fighting knowledge he's gleaned primarily from cable TV, and with a malapropism for every occasion, Larry bumbles his way from one outlandish situation to the next, somehow managing to stay one step ahead of the authorities at all times.

Larry the Cable Guy has that rare ability to perform low comedy routines without having to resort to self-conscious mugging to garner laughs.  Likewise, Ivana Milicevic, Eric Roberts, Joe Mantegna, Jenny McCarthy and a whole host of other comic actors throw themselves into their roles with a great deal of abandon and aplomb.

The humor is broad (to put it mildly), but it is more often fleet-footed than flatfooted, and the whole enterprise is so dopey and good-natured that you may just find yourself chuckling right along with all the goofiness - provided, that is, you can put your brain on hold for the full hour-and-a-half that the movie takes to play itself out.",1230768000,,1608,4.973880597014926

As he's writing he might come up with a joke or two which he saves. A few jokes a night every night of the year and you've got yourself a pretty good library of jokes.

I love slapstick and sight gag humor, but a naked Larry the Cable Guy getting a body cavity search is just too much, even for his biggest fans. The only real redeaming thing about this movie is that Jeff Foxworthy did NOT make a cameo.

So what kind of film is this? Larry is a small town deputy who dreams of becoming an FBI agent. So in an attempt to make his dream come true, he kidnaps a witness from FBI protection. He then decides to take her to CHicago himself to testify. Of course we have some corrupt agents which does nothing but stretch this movie out another unbearable 30 minutes.

I must say that this movie is a little more funny that Delta Farce. It is well-casted and had some great, funny moments.  The humor surrounding the FBI agents was pretty good (i.e., an agents whose last name is Orange, so ""Agent Orange"") and it was great to see Yaphett Kotto after not seeing him in a movie for more than 5 years. Also, seeing Eric Roberts roam around in a jacket with the large letters ""PMS"" was pretty fair, too.  I think you really need to be in a certain mood when taking in a new movie.

It had it's funny moments, but they couldn't make up for the poorly written script. The only reason I bought this movie was because Ivana Milicevic was in it, and she's my favorite actress, so basically I watch anything that she's in. You can imagine my dissapointment when I noticed that she was left off the DVD cover and replaced by Jenny McCarthy, just because she is a bigger name, and the studio felt that her image would sell more copies of this lackluster movie. I thought that this was incredibly unfair to Ivana Milicevic, who in all reality is the female lead in this movie, not to mention also a better actress, and a Hell of a lot classier and prettier than Jenny McCarthy, (which says a lot because Jenny's a ten in the looks department.) Well that's Coporprate America for you, compromise integrity and decency to make a buck. All in all, Parallel Entertainment Pictures really screwed its star here and they owe her a huge apology. Although this movie is not very good, true (male) fans of Ms. Milicevic's will still enjoy this movie, especially Chapter 14 from 1:14:41 to 1:14:55 (you'll see what I mean), because as in all her movies, she's FRIGGING HOT!!!!
