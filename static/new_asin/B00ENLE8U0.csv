8606997,3,B00ENLE8U0,"This is a clear ""your mileage may vary"" purchase. I am a huge fan and student of Edgar G Ulmer's work. And I am a completist. 60% of this three disc set, our little short documentaries about such fun subjects as tuberculosis, syphilis, etc there also are a few rare miscellaneous shorts, a fairly forgettable low-budget murder mystery, and a filmed Ukrainian opera (Actually my favorite thing on the set! Very entertaining story, and I like the music, much to my surprise).

If you're a complete is like me, and/or a student of film, especially how to do low-budget filmmaking, I think this is a very important set. However,  keep in mind, that a good portion of this if not all of it is available for free online at places like archive.org, and  YouTube.  Certainly the public service short documentaries are. But I like to support people who aggregate and make available this kind of material and keep artists like Mr. Ulmer alive.  Some of his better work (and better known) such as Detour ( arguably his best work, and one of the greatest works of film noir ever) & Strange Illusion, are available for prime members on Amazon instant video.

And of course, his first & pretty much last higher budget film,  The Black Cat for Universal, is almost without question the best Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi movie ever.

 Unfortunately, he sabotaged his career by having an affair with the wife of the nephew of  Carl Laemmle head of Universal Studios (Clearly an affair of  The heart, as he later married her, and stayed married to her for the rest of their lives. She was instrumental on many of his films, I forget in what capacity),  which effectively got him blacklisted from the A-list of Hollywood studios for the rest of his career and life. he remained in banishment and exile in low-budget work, which apparently suited him fine Innoway, because he got to work more independently. Inhe remained in banishment and exile in low-budget work, which apparently suited him fine, because he got to work more independently. In a way, he was the godfather of independent filmmakers, and especially those who started out and/or worked with low budgets  and on the fringes, such as Robert Rodriguez, Quinten Tarantino, Roger Corman, Tobe Hooper,  John Carpenter,  and many others. Including me ;-)

I even like his to low-budget schlock science-fiction movies, The Amazing Transparent Man, & the Man from Planet X. are available for prime members on Amazon instant video. I even like his low-budget schlock science-fiction movies such as The Amazing Transparent Man, & the Man from Planet X.
 Again, a clear case of YM MV when it comes to this set. But for the price I couldn't resist, and I am enjoying it and learning from it.",1435276800,,2725,4.763829787234043
8606998,5,B00ENLE8U0,"Grapevine Video must be congratulated on producing this three-disc set of 11 rarely seen feature films and documentaries of Edgar G. Ulmer. Several of these have not been released to video before. The features are a VD film, Damaged Lives, a interesting little murder mystery, From Nine to Nine and the operetta Cossacks in Exile. The docos include five he made for the National Tuberculosis mob, including an interesting one aimed at Native Americans, and two for the Army. The films appear a little creaky today, partly because of the poor production values UImer was dealing with and partly because of the age of the material, but they are uncut gems from a distinctly interesting filmmaker whose social conscience imbued all his work and his craftsmanship lifted from the banal. I dare say we are lucky these have survived. I hope Grapevine Video unearths more such gems. I will be checking their website regularly for a second and maybe third volume to reveal more to us about Edgar G. Ulmer's broader body of work. Thanks.",1384128000,7,1028,4.88
