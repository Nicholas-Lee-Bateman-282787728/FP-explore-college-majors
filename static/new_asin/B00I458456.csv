6248980,5,B00I458456,This is my favorite show of all time.  This show brings me peace and helps me to forget the troubles of the world.  Good acting from all of the actors.  The story lines are hilarious as well.  After watching an episode you will feel like you have been to a comedy show.  Can't wait until season 5 and 6 come out.,1404518400,4,312,4.049180327868853

6248984,5,B00I458456,These were some of the best shows on Tv. So nice to have all of the seasons so far. Mama is one of a kind,1404000000,,105,3.24
6248985,5,B00I458456,"I love this season beacause it has a 2 part episode where Mama is in Hawaii. Those are the best episodes of the whole series! My other favorites from this season are: Zirconias Are A Girl's Best Friend-When Mama is addicted to home shopping, Breaking Up is Hard to Do-When Vint and Naomi get in a fight and break up, and Naomi's Identity Crisis-When Naomi gets amnesia and doesn't act sexy. Love this show!",1403913600,,406,4.5
6248986,5,B00I458456,I love Mama's Family! I was so happy that they finally put them out on dvd. I've seen them all a million times and I never get tired of them. They are good if you are feeling down. My favorite episode of this season is Workman's Holiday. What a great show! Very underrated.,1403654400,,273,4.169811320754717
6248987,5,B00I458456,"Contrary to other people that will most likely be putting a episode by episode review, I am just going to simply state that this is classic TV, and there aren't a whole lot of shows with this much honesty these days.  While today's TV is dominated by politically correct characters and non-offensive storylines that represent every social and racial dynamic, Mama's Family focused more on simple probelms of small town midwest life.  This show set records for being the highest rated syndicated televison show.  It was shown on my network (WSBK-Boston) on Sundays at noon.  It was refreshing to watch a new (albeit syndicated) episode on a Sunday rather than sandwiched in the primetime network schedule.  My favorite years of this sitcom are yet to come (5-6), but Season 4 is on par with Season 3, and if you want in your face one liners, and simple comedy, you have found it!  Vicki Lawrence definitely made the show, but in my opinion the supporting cast is one of the greatest of the 80's, only rivaled by the supporting cast of shows such as Cheers, Taxi, and Three's Company.",1403568000,15,1082,4.7287234042553195
6248988,5,B00I458456,"Mama's Family is a truly underrated TV Sit Com. Fans have long awaited all Seasons to be released on DVD. Season 4 has some very great moments- with Bubba and Iola added to the cast for full comedy effect. This show is great. This Season Includes The ultimate Hawaii- sit com episode, Bubba's Graduation, Mama going back to school, and also many other great moments in Mama history. Its well worth every penny!",1401408000,11,410,4.63013698630137

6249010,4,B00I458456,"Much like WKRP in Cincinnati, Mamas Family has had quite the odyssey in just getting to DVD.  For the details, just type Mamas Family DVD into your favorite search engine. I take these things in mind when offering my opinion on products. I am sure that people can say x, y, z, are not here, but let me ask a question Are we better for having a perhaps imperfect Mamas Family than none at all? I have so many memories of watching this first syndicated on the FOX Network than TBS Superstation and now on METV (when my antenna holds up.)

The bottom line is that Mamas Family Season Four is funny. The humor is certainly not on the highest level, but theres a relatability to it. Who doesnt want to tune in and watch a family more dysfunctional than their own? Its also great that there are some extras with the cast that offer some insight into the characters, acting, and wardrobe choices that combined together to make this an 80s favorite for so many.",1466985600,,953,4.409090909090909

6249034,5,B00I458456,"Season 4 is definitely my favorite season of ""Mama's Family"". This particular season Thelma and her grandson, Bubba take night school classes together. Thelma develops a harmless crush on her teacher, Mr. Hansen. This scene where she tries to flirt (thanks to Naomi's ""help"") with Mr. Hansen is priceless. This is also the season where Thelma gets picked as a contestant on the game show, Jeopardy! She comes in 2nd but she wins a trip to Hawaii where she promises ""to take her worthless family"" with her as her guests. I also love the episode where Thelma gets hooked on Raytown's very own home shopping network. And I also like the episode, ""The Sins of The Mother"". Probably the funniest and moving episode of the entire series. The season finale, where Thelma and Bubba graduate is also very touching. ""Mama's Family"" was one of my favorite t.v. shows to watch when I was a kid. I'm so happy all the seasons have been released on DVD so I can relive all these wonderful, hilarious moments anytime I please. I highly recommend it. Vicki Lawrence, you are a genius!

6249082,5,B00I458456,"Within the usual laughs there's a good amount of focus on education in this season, with Thelma (Vicki Lawrence) and Bubba (Allan Kayser) becoming unwitting classmates in night school. In Thelma's case, it's a long-ago dropped English class that kept her from earning a diploma; in Bubba's, it's flunking one his junior year. Nevertheless, the two begin in the season's first episode, ""Educating Mama,"" and graduate in the season ender, ""Pomp and Circumstance.""

Other noteworthy episodes include ""The Sins of the Mother,"" where a rebellious Bubba learns about the misadventures of his mother Eunice; and ""Zirconias are a Girl's Best Friend,"" where Thelma becomes hooked on a home shopping channel.

As always, Thelma, Vint, Naomi, Bubba and Iola are sure to make viewers laugh, no matter what they're up to!",1422921600,,808,5.207692307692308

My favorite episode is the one where Mama gets hooked on a game show similar to QVC.  I remembered it from years ago, and it was as funny as I recalled.",1412294400,,345,4.428571428571429

6249183,5,B00I458456,"Season 4 of Mama's family has the cast in place all doing what they each do best. Gidget Goes Hawaiian has nothing on Mama going hawaiian. When mama gets hooked on tele-shopping, the aversion therapy the family  put her through is screamingly funny. The episode when Bubba and Mama graduate from high school is terrific. Eunice and Ed don't plan to come see Bubba graduate, and Mama has to tell him. And even though she knows Eunice is a rotten mother, that she will never try to replace her, but always be there for him. I tell you it brought tears. So a comedy that can make you laugh or cry. Wonderful entertainment you can watch with anybody.",1406505600,,646,4.47457627118644

The whole family can sit around and watch this and laugh themselves silly. The only drawback i have for the DVD releases , is the home screen where the theme music is blaringly loud  from the rest of the episodes the sound  is fine but man, the main screen for episode selection will startle you and have you scrambling for the remote.

6249213,5,B00I458456,"All the Mama's Family DVDs are great, from the look of the cover art and the booklet to the extras. And it's so much fun that each DVD has a theme to one character/actor. This one is about Iola played by the great Beverly Archer! The ""Mama's Family Tree: The Neighbors"" montage is a lot of fun, because there are also commentaries by e.g. co-executive producer Rick Hawkins (who wrote Went with the Wind! on the Carol Burnett Show and 27 episodes of Mama's Family) and Jim Evering (who wrote 29 episodes of Mama's Family). Of course Beverly's interview gives greater insight into Iola Boylen: from wardrobe to accent! The cast reunion is of course great fun too. The one very minor complaint (if I had to have a complaint) is that there are a few things in this ""part two"" of the reunion that are in ""part one"" on the season 3 DVD, but it doesn't take away from this one. It's just something I noticed!",1404691200,2,902,4.407185628742515

8639039,5,B00I458456,"This six episode DVD displayed the best episodes from the season four of ""Mama's Family."" The series spent the first two seasons on network television before returning in syndication in 1986. In 1987 to 1988 season, this DVD has picked the six favorite episodes of the fourth season.

Mama returns to school in the episode ""Educating Mama"" with General Hospital's John Ingle as her teacher. Another episode is when Mama gets addicted to television home shopping. Perhaps the best episode of the season is ""The Sins of the Mother."" When Bubba comes home drunk, Iola recounts when his mother, Eunice, came drunk to a mother-daughter banquet at the church. Heather Kerr was perfect was teenager Eunice. A young Nikki Cox played a young Iola Boylin perfectly.

The other three episodes have Mama on ""Jeopardy!"" with Alex Trebek. She wins a trip for four to Hawaii. ""Mama Goes Hawaiian"" is a two episode deal with Barney Martin (Seinfeld). They filmed at the Kapalua Bay Villa and Resort in Maui, Hawaii.

If you love ""Mama's Family,"" you will definitely enjoy this DVD as part of your library collection. The episodes here are fuller than the syndicated episodes on television.",1508112000,,1173,4.944162436548224
