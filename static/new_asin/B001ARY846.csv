Michelle Yeoh does some great acting in this flick. Even though it's a foreign film, you'll watch the action unfold. It doesn't hurt to read the subtitles. People have this stigma about foreign films. You either learn the language to understand what they are saying in the film or just read the subtitles. I normally just read the subtitles anyways since I do that with all films and TV shows. Overall, I'm proud to have this film in my collection. Totally a classic.",1498608000,,644,4.707964601769912

8279323,3,B001ARY846,"If you're a fan of Cynthia Rocthrock and Michelle Yeoh and are looking for the best action flick by the duo look elsewhere as this movie, while containing some of the best action sequences by the duo is anti-climatic. However, if you've got time to spare this movie is a good way of killing time.",1380585600,,296,4.4
