2352121,1,B000A2WAME,I'd love to review this but 6 weeks later it still hasn't turned up . It's the greatest surf movie ever but it'd be nice to actually watch,1329264000,,138,3.9642857142857144
2352122,5,B000A2WAME,"dig this movie. makes me want to surf, eat well, consume less and make art. great surfing, great music and great people. if you don't have this one you a re missing out.",1294444800,3,169,4.151515151515151
2352123,5,B000A2WAME,Great snapshot of the state of the general culture and surfing a few years after the short board revolution.  Beautiful lines drawn across the waves.,1287360000,2,149,4.96
2352124,5,B000A2WAME,"I owned this on VHS and then bought the DVD.  The DVD is missing the intro by the filmmaker, which is kind of a bummer because that was cute and informative.  Nonetheless it's a great DVD.  Falzon does a great job of creating a vibe that transfers the peace and beauty of nature and surfing into your living room.

The music is one of the best things going for the film, what a great soundtrack.  Yes, the film has a hippy feel, but it's clearly a fantasy and escape from the workaday world.  And for my money that's the best thing ""nature sports"" like surfing give to us.  The fact that the fantasy is somewhat idealized and unattainable is part of the appeal.

For example the kids living in the forest is a little silly, yes.  They were probably doing more harm than good to the environment by todays standards... did they leave no trace behind when they finished their campout?  But my point is all of that is beside the point.  The important thing is the fantasy of living a carefree existance in nature, not actually doing it.

I think it's similar with the outdoor sports, they can be kind of a pain and serve little to no practical purpose.  Yet they stimulate your imagination and help you appreciate the earth's beauty so that make it all worth it.  Just don't try to read too much into it or think you are offering the world a new way to live life, you are not.  It's still just a vacation, and there's nothing at all wrong with that.",1270598400,2,1445,4.33955223880597
2352125,5,B000A2WAME,"I love this movie and always will!  Falzon captures the essence of what surfing is all about- the lifestyle and the simplicity.  It bums me out what's happened to surfing over the years.  I wish I grew up in the 70's and was a part of the movement.  Every time I watch MOTE, I want to go surf a single fin and take it slow.  I've had the same copy on VHS forever but no longer have a VCR.  Have there been many problems with the DVD version like that one guys from the review before I purchase?

Great movie!",1254787200,4,508,4.02
2352126,2,B000A2WAME,"Falzon exposed Uluwatu to the world on Morning of the Earth. Good soundtrack but a ""vegeterian"" film. Like the vegeterian diet, monotonous.",1179360000,,139,5.363636363636363
2352127,4,B000A2WAME,"This is a fantastic surf movie, legendary really.  The music is great, the surfing is great, the psychedelic effects are great (if you are into that sort of thing).  But the big big bummer is that the DVD pressing is really bad quality.  The one I got had little nibs of plastic on the playing surface, so the DVD would not play the entire way through.  At this price (or any, right?) I expect a disc that plays.  As far as I can tell, the director owns the film and is selling the DVD (on his site for $45!).  Too bad he's skimping on the pressing because this is a great artifact of psychedelic hippy surfing culture.",1166140800,5,619,4.247863247863248
8072836,2,B000A2WAME,"I don't get it. The shots are often too zoomed in, there are good sections, but there's other rides that could be me and my buddies. I'd like a little narration to know where they are or who the surfers are. I've got a bunch of old Bruce brown movies that I much prefer. The music is nice and mellow.",1475193600,,300,4.016666666666667
8072837,3,B000A2WAME,"Keeps 'freezing' for a second or so regularly throughout the film.  There doesn't appear to be any damage on the disc surface and my machine operates both NTSC & PAL, so I assume it is simply the conversion of this original film based product to dvd/digital format.",1417737600,,265,4.638297872340425
8072838,2,B000A2WAME,It is supposed to be a classic but we did not see it that way.,1411344000,,62,3.2
8072839,3,B000A2WAME,good,1405209600,,4,4.0
8072840,4,B000A2WAME,"I was so looking forward to seeing this film. And it is a great artifact of the era. A lovely movie. I Don't know whether I just have a bad pressing of the DVD or whether it is an awful transfer, it looks horrible, like a rip from an old VHS tape, with a bumch of artifacting.  Copyright date says 2003, so I wondered whether the more recent 40th Anniversary release was a newer transfer, or just uses this same one.  I held of buying the 40th Anniversary edition because it is only available for $60+ from the director of the film.  Maybe we'll get lucky and someone will do a Hi Resolution scan onto blu ray. So 4 stars for the movie. Zero stars for the quality of the transfer.",1402963200,2,680,4.175572519083969
8072841,5,B000A2WAME,It's everything you thought it would be. Dated music- but just play your own music over it. Little talking. All surfing.,1388707200,,120,4.761904761904762
8072842,4,B000A2WAME,History in the making. Can't belive i waited so long to buy it. Amazing surfing by some of our heros when they were in their prime. The music is a plus.,1358208000,,152,3.935483870967742
8072843,2,B000A2WAME,"Recently purchased a copy from ""surfvideo.com"", and was so disappointed!!! The terrible print saw my memories of this classic lost in jumpy, out of focus, GRAINY crap! It looks like someone used a handheld vidcam to record the movie playing on a poor television set...",1343865600,2,268,4.977777777777778
8072844,5,B000A2WAME,"This is one of the originals and definitely the best surf movie ever made.
It also has a brilliant soundtrack  It has been very nicely packaged to celebrate
its anniversary and rightly so. Reproduced beautifully.
Takes me back to the 70s seeing surf movies in local halls.",1331942400,,272,4.787234042553192
8072845,5,B000A2WAME,"This is an excellent collector's dvd movie by one of the premium surf movie makers. It came with a book with coloured photos and the lyrics to the immortal soundtrack created by the great singers and writers of the day. Todays surfing movie makers should take a leaf out of Albert Falzon's book on how to make a good movie. Highly recommended for all surfers, especially those from that era.",1330905600,,391,4.6
