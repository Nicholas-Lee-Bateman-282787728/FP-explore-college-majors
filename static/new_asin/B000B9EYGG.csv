2409446,5,B000B9EYGG,"""Do you love this house?  Do you love this house?""

Yeah, I really did.  Dan Mirvish has wonderfully created a light, hysterical and crazy story about achieving the American Dream: buying your first house.

This movie's awesome. I loved it. Just off-kilter enough to be funny and heartfelt without being diabetes inducing. I absolutely loved it!

My favorite part was Anthony Rapp's song ""My House"" towards the end. Everything that he says in that song was exactly how I felt when me and my family moved out of our house. I lived in my house for like ten years and that's exactly how I felt when we had to leave. And you have to know I was so pissed at the people who bought it from us when I saw that they'd let the lawn die!

I think this is why Open House works, because everyone can relate to this.

Great job. I really loved it. Hysterical, great performances, great screenplay and awesome camera work!",1133395200,8,907,4.460606060606061
2409447,5,B000B9EYGG,"Fantastic!  ""Open House"" is a wonderfully witty, fast paced and well written musical comedy.  The whole cast was spectacular with Kellie Martin and Sally Kellerman's performances shining through.  The catchy songs are perfectly placed within the hilarious plot.  Watch out world, the musical has returned!",1130198400,7,305,5.711111111111111
2409448,5,B000B9EYGG,"""Do you love this House?  Do you love this House?  Do you really, really love this house?""  Thats lyrics from just one of the memorable songs from this fun and inventive musical!  I loved the cast: Anthony Rapp from RENT and DAZED AND CONFUSED!  Kellie Martin from LIFE GOES ON and ER!  The still sexy Sally Kellerman!  Tired of the same old movies at the theaters?  Buy OPEN HOUSE for a breath of fresh air!",1128556800,6,408,4.346666666666667
2409449,5,B000B9EYGG,"Having seen an advance screening at the Egyptian theater in Hollywood, I was thrilled to see the return of Dan Mirvish' directorial prowess.  Not since his 1994 film "" Omaha the Movie"", have I been as impressed with a directing style.  From the broad dance numbers to the very funny song lyrics, Dan's dry wit and humor is abundant in this film. I was told that the actors sang live on set and that very little was done in editing.  How bold a concept to let the actor's true talents show throughout the project.  I just hope I don't have to wait another 10 years for the next Dan Mirvish film.",1128556800,10,594,4.324324324324325
2409450,5,B000B9EYGG,"This movie was an absolute joy to watch!  It constantly surprised me - first with the musical numbers, which are like none others I'd seen in a movie - and then with the heart of the characters (Anthony Rapp was amazing!),and the depth of the story (don't reveal the ending!).  Somehow this movie slipped through the cracks on its big screen release (I saw it in Santa Fe), but now's our chance to get the DVD.  I can't wait to share this with everyone I know.  Oh, and Sally Kellerman was fantabulous!",1128470400,7,502,4.423913043478261
2409451,2,B000B9EYGG,"SAw the film at a festival -- it's okay. Kind of funny but it wears thin. Be warned if you buy the DVD, however Heddy Burress is cool to see -- She was in Boston Common. Which she was in more films. And Kellie Martin is pretty cool too. It's not bad, it's just not great...",1128384000,6,273,3.892857142857143
2409452,1,B000B9EYGG,"I was suckered in by the 5 star reviews and chose to ignore the 1 star (and only honest) Amazon review on this DVD. Needless to say, the 1 star review and everything stated in it is correct --but I would like to add something: Now it looks like the ""filmmakers and their cronies"" are putting a few additional reviews to their pseudonyms to make it look like they're real reviewers. This can't be the case. Even if you forgave all the flaws of Open House you would NEVER give it 5 stars! Now, I love independent film but hate it when it is absolutely merciless in its ineptitude. This is one of those films; just do yourself a favor and avoid it.",1142467200,6,645,4.252032520325203
2409453,4,B000B9EYGG,"Like most others, I heard of Open House through Anthony Rapp. I didn't bother to rent it, I just bought it because I've never seen Anthony involved in anything that wasn't worth my while. Within 24 hours of getting the film in the mail, I'd already watched it three times. Of course, not all the singing voices are 'fantabulous' but I do have to say I'm in love with Rapp's and Sally Kellerman's vocals. The film has a great humor to it, and a fun tone. The songs are extremely catchy -- you can find me singing Fantabulous all over the place. The film may take some getting used to for those who aren't used to viewing low budget movies, but definitely give it a chance. Open House has become one of my favorites, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who is in the mood for a fun film.",1142380800,4,791,4.28
2409454,5,B000B9EYGG,"I found out about this movie becaues Anthony Rapp was in it. I knew nothing about it untill i spotted it at the store. I picked it up, read the back, and thought it sounded interesting. A musical about real estate, something i've never seen before. I bought and watched it the minute i got home and completely LOVED it. The songs were catchy and it had a strange but good story line. It was fun to see people you wouldn't noremally see singing, singing songs about loveing a house or sexy swiping or making a safe houes of love. It's not a normal musical, but i love all the songs and by the end of the movie i was singing Fantabulous and It's My House. It definetly a movie i'll never fotget.",1142294400,5,693,4.2180451127819545
2409455,5,B000B9EYGG,Seriously funny!!! And the music is a blast! It's good campy fun and definitely something that I wouldn't mind letting the kids watch.,1142294400,4,134,4.869565217391305
2409456,1,B000B9EYGG,"I never would have imagined writing a review for a DVD whether it be positive or negative. However, after reading so many rave reviews for Open House, I was intrigued and pushed it to the top of my Netflix list. Wow! What garbage! Imagine being forced into an evening of karaoke with untalented people you despise and you get the picture. It is shot on the lowest quality video possible (No film or HD here!), overexposed, and has a scratchier soundtrack than a third generation VHS copy of your children's dance recital! I can't even tell you how many times my friends and I covered our mouths in horror and embarassment for all involved with this fiasco. So I decided to go back and re-read the reviews to see if perhaps I had a mini-stroke and miscounted all the stars. Nope, they're all raves... but wait, how come all the praise and hyperboles are coming from people who have only reviewed Open House and nothing else? BECAUSE IT'S THE FILMMAKERS CREATING THEIR OWN HYPE! Shame on them and their cronies. Spare yourself the agony. Run far away from this Open House even if it's just a rental.",1141948800,8,1097,4.573604060913706
2409457,5,B000B9EYGG,"Independent minded, to say the least. It has some rough edges production-wise, but it is infectiously fun. Had me laughing and singing along (god-forbid, if you've heard me sing!)

It also has some of the most fun DVD extras I've seen. Why bother with film school ?Just watch the ""how-to"" features on the DVD!",1139529600,6,309,4.722222222222222
2409458,5,B000B9EYGG,Amazing movie. had me fully captivated. a must see.,1136678400,7,51,4.777777777777778
2409459,5,B000B9EYGG,"I first had an interest in this movie after doing a search for my favorite actor, Anthony Rapp. I originally rented the movie and after renting and watching it several times , I fell in love with Open House.  So much so that I immediately purchased my own copy, as my friends and I watch Open House with veneration. This is the general consensus of everyone I know who loves this movie. My friends and online buddies and I quote the lines all the time.  The entire concept of a real estate musical is pure genius. The movie starts on a ""high note"" and doesn't disappoint. Open House is refreshing because of the absence of ""cool special effects"".  The movie has a loose plot at best, dorky but lovable characters, and is entertaining in that it does not seek to 'wow' its viewers. So, not only was the film fun for the whole family and all of my friends, but it was also original and innovative, an instant classic in my movie collection.",1136419200,8,938,4.410404624277457
2409460,5,B000B9EYGG,"I'm not usually into musicals, but Open House had me at ""fantabulous.""  Really funny, and also surprisingly touching in a few places.  Very well directed, and the acting was great.  Sure, the whole thing's a little goofy, but I think that's the whole point.  It's not a high budget, glossy affair like Rent or Chicago - but it's not trying to be either, and I think it really succeeds on its own, very original terms.  Kudos for the film, and I mean this as a compliment:  Now, I'd really like to see this as an off-Broadway play or something - it could really have a life of its own.",1135900800,7,584,4.3119266055045875
2409461,5,B000B9EYGG,"Until recently, The Producers was the only musical I'd ever enjoyed, and I never expected that to change. My previous experiences with other musicals (e.g. Robert Altman's ""Popeye"") had taught me to be wary of the genre in general. Then came Open House, which showed me that actors randomly bursting into song doesn't need to make me cringe. Open House's tunes are catchy, and they're matched by intelligent, funny lyrics. Sally Kellerman makes for a hilarious alcoholic, and the plot twist at the end of the movie genuinely caught me off guard.

I would watch Open House before any other musical (even Rent -gasp!-) anytime, and if you're looking for a musical and/or my advice, I heartily suggest you do the same. Enjoy.",1134518400,6,722,4.869918699186992
8083947,1,B000B9EYGG,Unfortunately this movie was so bad and not even good. Somehow they found a way to make a fantastic broadway actor sound bad. Not sure what was used to record but it should have been different. The plot is far from able to carry the unfortunate sound.,1499817600,,251,4.361702127659575
8083948,4,B000B9EYGG,I great find if you love musicals! Anthony Rapp leads a great cast in a unique and original musical romp.,1405123200,,105,4.3
8083949,1,B000B9EYGG,C grade filming and definitely not Grease... More odd and strange than comical...  Watched it once and that will be it.,1348704000,,119,4.666666666666667
8083950,1,B000B9EYGG,"I'm a RENT fan, so when I found this Anthony Rapp musical movie I had never heard of I was pretty excited.  When I watched it I couldn't believe how bad it was.  The story line has some (but very little) potential, but to call it a musical is being very, very generous.  The ""music"" is pathetic as are the lyrics.  As for the singers, Anthony Rapp does the best he can with the weak material.  The rest of the singers' voices are as bad as the ""songs"" they are singing.  I finished watching it because I had invested in it (my mistake) but it was actually hard to get through it.  I felt so sorry for Rapp to have been in such a low-budget, poor project; he is so very talented.  If you are an Anthony Rapp fan, do yourself a favor, continue to enjoy him in RENT recordings and don't spoil your image of him by watching this fiasco.",1202428800,3,832,4.124223602484472
8083951,5,B000B9EYGG,This is a strange but wonderful movie. Some may not like it but I think it is one of the best musicals. It is a movie that is a spoof on musicals. It is not meant to be taken seriously it is just meant to be low budget and fun and that is part of it's charm. I rented it and loved it I watched it twice laughing all the way through it. I can't wait to watch it again. I am buying a house so watching that at my new place with just be hysterical.,1190851200,,445,3.6458333333333335
8083952,5,B000B9EYGG,"Open House is a zany and very funny original musical. I usually don't go for musicals, but the subject matter made this one really work for me.  There are lots of plot twists, and no one is really who they seem they are.  With the housing bubble of the last few years and more and more people paying attention to real estate, this movie is very appropriate for its time.",1147824000,,370,4.271428571428571
8083953,5,B000B9EYGG,"I have read some reviews where people are applauding ""Open House"" for being a 'cute,' 'silly' movie.  Which I suppose it is, on the surface.  But, when I watched this film, I felt that there was a deeper message being communicated.  This film made me think about what home really means to me, and how America has placed such emphasis on the idea of home, family, and ownership.  Anthony Rapp's character, and his epic song 'My House,' are incredible statements on how our lives can be boiled down to one certain event, place, or person that impacted us.  Another aspect of the film that I loved was the casting of non-singers in singing roles.  The rawness and relative unprofessionalism of their musical performance adds to the film's honesty.  The entire film was shot in digital as well, and I loved the effect.  As for the reviews I have read that are proclaiming 'Open House' as a worthless movie, I think that they are missing the point.  Perhaps they expect that movie musicals are traditional, formulaic, and easily explained.  'Open House' presents a fresh use of the genre, with fantastic results.",1142726400,2,1107,4.778947368421052
8083954,4,B000B9EYGG,"Open House is a very very silly movie, but that is what makes it so fun to watch. Anthony Rapp is really the best part but the ""sexy Swipers"" are quite enjoyable too.

It is by no means the best movie ever, but it is really a lot of fun to watch and is something that you can watch more than once and catch some things you didn't in the first viewing!",1142726400,3,351,3.875
8083955,3,B000B9EYGG,"My cousin and I rented this movie for New Year's Eve, wanting to A: not have to watch the New Year's Eve shows all night and B: want to see Anthony Rapp in something outside of RENT. Watching the first few seconds of the movie, I thought it was cute, but a little bizare. However, as the movie progressed and the plot went along, I found it to be very cute and funny movie. Of course it is no Casablanca, but it is a good movie. People nowadays go in to the theatre expecting every movie to be done the same way, and it is not so for OPEN HOUSE. OPEN HOUSE takes a step out of the box and has come up with a clever plot line, with mostly cute, yet sometimes predictable lyrics. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. :-D",1142726400,3,714,4.070921985815603
8083956,1,B000B9EYGG,"I have been collecting and watching movie musicals my whole life. In the last four minutes, I have forgotten more about Broadway and Hollywood musicals than the entire population of the state of New Jersey ever knew. I have sat through such awful films as ""Glitter"" and ""Man of LaMancha"" (great show, horrible movie). I have groaned to see that ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"" was made into a movie minus MOST of the great songs. I have further groaned when ALL of the songs were removed from such treasures as ""Fanny"" and ""Irma La Douce."" And, of course, I have paused Richard Attenborough's movie version of the great Broadway show ""A Chorus Line"" in order to leave the room and puke. All of this being said, none of these disasters prompted me to write an Amazon review... until now. ""Open House"" (shudder) effortlessly passes through the level of Worst Musical Ever, then continues on to Worst Film Ever. Wait... while I was typing that last period, ""Open House"" (shudder) left Worst Film Ever and soared - SOARED - to Worst Thing Ever.

Shame on the viewers who gave this five stars. It is SO obvious that they have an interest in promoting this film. An interest for more important than their integrity.

But just in case they do NOT have an interest (I don't want to be sued), then let's just say they have about the same level of taste as Divine does at the end of Pink Flamingos.

And, speaking of Pink Flamingos, you're better off watching that film than this embarrassing horror.

This is where someone says, ""Yes, but did you like this film?""",1142467200,8,1571,4.560283687943262
