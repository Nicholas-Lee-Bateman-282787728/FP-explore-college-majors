1884125,4,B00009MEC4,"Angelina Bettis stars in this predictable, but creepy and well-made gothic thriller about a very shy and disturbed young woman with a lazy eye. When she's little, she has to wear an eye patch, and no-one wants to be her friend, so her mom gives her a rather disturbing-looking dolly in a glass case and tells her that if you can't find a friend, the next best thing is to make one! Hmmm, I wonder what's going to happen when she takes up sewing and a job at the veterinary clinic. As if that's not enough to telegraph the ending, the first shot in the film is one from the final scene. I guess they figured the audience might get bored if they didn't open with something flashy, I don't know. Non-linear opening shots are kind of cool, when we flash back and towards the end find out the story around the shot, but it would have been more effective left out.
Jeremy Sisto (who fans of Six Feet Under will know can be creepy himself) plays an artist who worships Dario Argento (really!) only to find himself involuntarily the middle of a real life Argento film. Anna Farris (from the Scary Movie series) plays her flaky, promiscuous co-worker, who I'm pretty sure is a lesbian (yes, I'm being sarcastic, she's all over May like a cheap suit about 3 seconds after meeting her).
 May tells her doll, who she still has and keeps in a glass case, all about her new potential friends... but slowly begins to become unhinged when things don't work out the way she wanted... and her doll gives her bad advice.
Some critics complained that the movie tries to 'have it both ways' and be funny and scary, but I thought it found an OK balance, there's plenty of pitch-black humor that doesn't seem out of place. Again, nearly any horror fan will guess where the movie is going, but it's still fairly original, well-made and so twisted for a fairly mainstream release movie that it's still entertaining and worth at least a rental. Great acting from Angela Bettis. I'm pretty hard to gross out, but I'm squeamish about eyes, and I had to cover mine during at least two scenes. NOTE: Cat lovers should also skip the scene titled 'Cat Lover' #15 on the DVD.
 Includes nods to Maniac, Night of the Living Dead, Pieces, Opera, and most strongly, Polanski's Repulsion, so that's always cool. I also can't help but admire the filmmakers who somehow managed to get May financed and made-- no WAY could this have been an easy sell, no matter how they pitched it.
The DVD includes two commentary tracks, both of them have oddball commentators such as 'Craft Services Guy'. The commentary is a little too self-consciously wacky in parts, but has some interesting trivia. The easter egg can be found by clicking on the nearly invisible Lion's Gate logo on the main menu--there's a trailer for May, as well as others. If you want to preserve some sort of surprise, don't watch the May trailer till after the movie.
Just friends...thats all May ever wanted....",1058400000,27,2934,4.576045627376426
1884126,5,B00009MEC4,"Whoa! I'm speechless! May is one weird, fun, funny, sad, and disturbing film. It's just so many things. It's a strangely beautiful character study about a lonely girl who just wants a friend. I couldn't help but feel for her. She's weird and shy, but in a cute, sweet way. I was intrigued by her, and wanted her to find happiness. No matter how pathetic her character would become, I just couldn't stop caring. I wanted to reach out to her, and be her friend. Nobody deserves to be so lonely. All she needed was a friend. But things just don't exactly work out that way. Once she began to crack and take the plunge into madness, it was understandable how it could happen. That doesn't mean that the events that unfolded weren't shocking, because they definitely were. But we see why our heroine does what she does. We can't help but want things to be different though, and for her to go down a different path, but when she doesn't, we come along for the ride anyway, following her wherever she takes us.
Angela Bettis gives an amazing performance as May. So far this is the best female performance of the year, and when the end of the year comes, if it's still not THE best, it will be one of THE best. She makes us care about her character from the beginning, and we never really stop, even when she goes psychotic. Bettis shows so many emotions, and makes us feel all kinds of things. She was very natural, and sometimes her body language spoke to us more than her words. We just knew what she was feeling, and could feel her cracking more and more as the movie went on. She was sweet, sad, scary, pathetic, and yet strangely attractive. It's too bad the Academy are such prudes, because this girl is so deserving of an Oscar nomination that it's not even funny. Unfortunately, it's obvious her performance will be overlooked by them. May just isn't ""Oscar material."" Plus, the movie didn't make enough money and isn't well known enough for them to even consider honoring anything to do with ""May."" But even if they don't honor it, the fans will always remember it. I've seen Bettis in other movies, but after seeing this, I will always remember her as May... I've always been a fan of the underrated Anna Faris. She's a great comedic actress. I found her to be a lot of fun as Polly. She's funny and sexy. This is sure to be one of my favorite supporting performances of the year. Faris was a welcome addition to this twisted little film.
Writer/Director Lucky McKee proves to be a great new talent. It's hard to believe this is his first feature film. Very impressive if you ask me. I'm looking forward to whatever he does next. If it's anything as wonderful as ""May,"" then it should be great... Also deserving of a mention is composer Jaye Barnes-Luckett. She does a terrific job here, always providing the right music at the right moment. If she keeps this up, she'll have a bright future ahead of her.
I'm still blown away by this film. There's so many praises I have for it, that I doubt I could remember to mention them all. It's original, well acted, well written, well directed, etc... It's just twistedly wonderful. It's too bad it wasn't given a better release in theaters, but it's not exactly a mainstream movie either. It still deserved better than what it got. At least I can find comfort in knowing that it's sure to become a cult classic. Word of mouth will help it a lot. It's definitely not for everyone though. It's weird, morbid, quirky, wicked, and gutsy. It doesn't shy away from much. In fact, it has one of the best and most realistic slit throats I've ever witnessed on screen. But don't let that scare you, it's definitely worth a look for any horror fan, or any film fan in general. I'm proud to have this haunting film as a part of my collection. It's simply A-MAY-ZING!

1884127,5,B00009MEC4,"This movie is simply amazing.  I cannot remember the last time a movie had such an effect on me.  It is disturbing, haunting and heartbreaking.  Plenty of gore too.  I cannot say enough good things about May.  Buy it right now.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed.  Buy it.....now.",1058227200,2,284,4.673469387755102
1884128,1,B00009MEC4,"I just saw ""May"" last night and was thoroughly disappointed. If you want to see a great story about an outsider and their struggles trying to fit in, go see ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" or ""Buffalo 66"". If you're looking for the sorriest excuse a protagonist has had to become a mass murderer, this one's for you! This type of film is proof that the better horror films are currently being made outside the U.S. It'd be nice to tell me something about a character's background at some point in a film. However, establishing sympathy for someone is not always necessary via flashbacks to trite little traumatic events in an unhappy childhood. I don't need a crash course in pop psychology rammed down my throat everytime something bad happens to someone in a movie. Also, for some bizarre reason, the writer thought that someone who thinks of herself as an outcast would have a really active social calendar. Did the meaning of the word outcast change recently? These are just a few of the flaws I found with this production. Normally, I enjoy the type of character study ""May"" attempts. In this case, it works against the rest of the movie as it degenerates into a campy slasher flick. I have no problem with campiness. Camp is fine. Camp is good if that's what you've been doing all along. But it wasn't and it's not.",1058054400,9,1316,4.604255319148936
1884129,5,B00009MEC4,"THIS WAS THE WEIRDEST FRIGGIN MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN.

Not exactly a comedy, horror or slasher flick, it's more of a weird blend of all three with a lot of psychological overtones. (translation: it really messes with your head)

And it works. Horror movies recently haven't been doing so hot. It can be left up to debate as to why the genre has been suffering, but what May does is take ordinary people, individuals with their own distince personalities, makes you like them, and then proceeds to do horrible things to them.

Take May, for example, the title character. She grew up with a ""lazy eye"" forcing her to wear an eye patch in grammar school, ostracizing her from the rest of the class. Twenty years later, glasses and corrective contacts fix the lazy eye, but May is no better off, having only  creepy little doll named Suzy that her mother gave her to call a friend. It's a character you feel sorry for. Quirky, cute, a little weird, but withdrawn.

May's most peculiar aspect, is her love of parts. May's coworker, Polly, a really friendly lesbian played by anna farris(scary movie) has a beautiful neck. Adam, played by jeremy sisto, a student of weird and lover of dario argento, has great hands. Frustrated, May laments, ""There are a lot of pretty parts, but no pretty wholes."" May is pretty handy with sewing scissors, needle and thread. You can imagine that things will not turn out well.

The first half of the film is humorous, as May tries to connect to Adam, who is amused and intriqued by May. however, when may's weirdness becomes too much for Adam to handle, May is thrust into a frantic pace to find the friend that she is looking for leading to one failed connection after another. May's mother says early on, ""when you don't have a friend, make one."" Blood and wackiness ensues.

I'll say that in terms of acting, Angela Bettis carries the film well on her little shoulders. Going from endearing to sad to creepy to just plain psycho. The rest of the small cast fills their roles well and are entirely believable in the reactions to May and the goings on. Not like most of the dolts I wish death upon early in most horror movies.

And it is definitely not for the squeamish. After 19 years of nightmare on elm st, friday the 13th, the excorcist and such, I consider myself pretty jaded to violence. A little red stuff never bothered me. But first time director Lucky McGee uses a unique storytelling perspective and camera work which makes the acts of violence committed by may seem as if they're being performed in front of me. Meanwhile, the final shot of the film still remains in my head.

Chances are, May won't have huge commercial success, being so damn creepy and weird. Chances are, most of you will not like it. But that's the way it goes sometimes. Hopefully, you'll all check it out, cause I want this movie to do well. Definitely one of the most interesting horror movies of all time.",1054944000,15,2922,4.5717017208413

1884258,5,B00009MEC4,"May is an intensely troubled girl. She has a lazy eye (not from birth) and this seemingly minor disturbance blossoms into a series of crippling interpersonal problems.

This film is sort of a gender switch version of the movie ""Love Object"" with Udo Keir. May has an impact far and above that movie, though.

The protagonist spends a great deal of her time with animals working as a veterinarian's assistant. Part of May's pathology is that she likes *parts* of human beings rather than the whole. She falls in love with Adam, a mechanic played by Jeremy Sisto.  He is an aspiring filmmaker obsessed with Dario Argento; by societal standards this would be strange enough, but even Adam realizes May is off in a way he can only dream of in his film scripts. The mutual attraction and repulsion constitute the heart of the movie, part of which is a meditation on cinema within cinema.

Suzy, the doll, is the scariest part of the film; it constitutes May's inner being. Once that's fractured, things get *really* Argentoish.

1884264,5,B00009MEC4,"May brims over with compassion and gentle humor for its demented, serial-killer heroine. The movie works because writer/director Lucky McKee and actress Angela Bettis are on the same page--which is to say, they both want to tell the story from her viewpoint and her feelings. There's a lot of shocking violence in the film, but because our emotional bond with May is so strong, the violence never repulses us or leads us to judge May. The movie has all the gore of a horror movie, but it has the light humor and tenderness of a coming-of-age story.

McKee indulges in some symbolism involving a doll that verges on the artsy-fartsy, but it's well-executed and the doll itself (which I assume is May's alter-ego) is very creepy looking.

McKee said that Taxi Driver was an influence on this film. Like Scorsese, he celebrates diversity, but also like Scorsese, he wonders if maybe the cultural mainstream exists for a reason.

1884284,5,B00009MEC4,"In my opinion, May is a funny, yet creepy movie. it is directed by lucky McGee, who is genius. I love all his work, and he is so original and versatile. may, played by angela bettis, is a loner who sews and collects creepy dolls, one in particular, her confidant, suzy, who is protected in a glass box. a gift given to her by her overprotective mom. may suffered her life with a bad lazy eye, being made fun of, but then finds a dr to fix it for her, giving her a confidence to pursue her crush, played by the wonderful Jeremy sisto. sisto is cool, laid back, and a huge fan of horror movies, and all things bizarre. not to mention he is a mechanic, still hoping to pursue his dream of becoming a film director. as may and he go on a couple of dates, he realizes how different she is, but he still feels affection for her. the final straw, however, is when he goes to her house for dinner and to watch the novie he made, movie short rather, and he and may start making out. this leads to the bedroom, where he attempts to be very gentle with her, knowing she is quite inexperienced, however may spoils the moment, and becomes downright strange, even too much so for sisto. he leaves awkwardly, and from there, things get really bad. may's motto is ""if you cant find a friend, make one"" I will let you use your imagination. remember, she is a seamstress. this movie could be compared to a super cool modern day Frankenstein. oh, and anna faris plays an awesome receptionist at the vet office, who takes quite a liking to may. great movie. must see in my book. anything by McGee is worth a look.",1433289600,,1593,4.260726072607261

1884288,5,B00009MEC4,"I enjoyed May because it did not easily fit within any known genre of films. Part horror story, part ""Who is this crazy girl with the lazy eye"" and ""Why is she doing such strange things until it all becomes apparent, and we know who May might be...Sin and redemption are Gothic themes that always entangled people, and May is the character than enacts these themes. Lesbian lover-to-be add more sin......Reminds me somewhat of a Stephen King novel, which are never translated into good movies, but this movie is good. His characters are also dealing with inner demons, but unlike his novels, the supernatural is not at play here. So much better because she is more real.

1884309,2,B00009MEC4,"The only reason I'm even giving this movie 2 stars is because of Angela Bettis. She's truly talented, and its unfortunately wasted on this material.  I was hoping, after reading all the great reviews, that I was about to see some underground horror movie I've been missing out on -- let's say that was NOT the case.  The characters, dialog, relationships and situations are not believable or relatable. I couldn't believe some the scenes I was seeing (including a guy bring his dogs leg to the vet where May works and asking if she could sew it back on. She says she can). The story doesn't build very well if at all -- and I wouldn't call this a horror movie. At best its the story of a girl who feels like an outcast and makes horrific choices.  Also, her ""lazy eye"" isn't really even that much of a reason for all this, and she's quite beautiful really.  When I think of an outcast girl horror movie I think of Carrie, who we actually liked and felt sorry for. Even though Sissy Spacek is the definitive Carrie, Angela did a respectable job in the role as well -- and if you wanna see Angela's talents put to work, see that instead.  This movie also managed to have a doll that didn't creep me out. How is that possible?",1419724800,,1223,4.3464912280701755

She's actually quite beautiful! I lol'd at some of her one-liners. It's not a scary movie- just really disturbing.

Her attempts to get a boyfriend were so pathetic, but I could feel her rejection.  As the movie went on, she became more sympathetic in a strange way.  The plot keeps you anticipating the next situation.  It is not a movie for everyone.  But if you like strange, off-the-wall stories, you will really like this one.

1884396,3,B00009MEC4,"This was an odd movie to say the least!!! Its about an awkward young lady named May (Angela Bettis) that has never had a friend or lover in her life due in part because of a lazy eye problem. Everyone knows what an ordeal she must of went through growing up and with little help from her oddball mother. Thats her life in a nut shell and this story is about her trying to make and keep friends and a boyfriend. The story follows her increadibly awkward journey as she attemps to make friends and the bizarre methods she uses to connect with people. She uses the same strange approach to meet her dream guy Adam (Jeremy Sisto). Well I think that you have a good idea what happens with her relationships because of her behavior and her methods. Part of her many mental issues is that she is looking for the perfect person that in the end leads her down a very dark path. The acting by Bettis was very good, but Sisto looked a little out of place in this role. This is a movie that's hard for me to review because of its content. I had to stop and start this movie three or four times to make it to the end in hopes that it would become more appealing to me, but it never did. This movie is not going to win over the masses because of its story and is more on the lines of you'll either love it or hate it. Its not a bad movie it just wasn't very appealing to me. Was it worth the time? Somewhat. Will I watch it again? No.

Interesting in a train wreck kind of way and you keep watching because you really expect it to get better and want to know where the story is going.  Unfortunately, the ending is just weird.  No sense of closure and I prefer an ending with closure...boring, I know. I am a 45 year old lady that loves a good vs evil story.  This wasn't it.  Acting was spot on for the lead crazy lady May and Adam was hot - but I have a secret crush on this guy from previous works.  All in all, I think it has had a high rating and weird following because it is simply different.  Different isn't always good, just different.  Have fun figuring it out for yourself!

She works at the animal hospital with lesbian Polly (a very hot, pre-blonde Anna Faris), and is fascinated with perfect body parts. She falls in love with Adam for his perfect hands.

1884417,4,B00009MEC4,"This is a well done film, and I'm not easy to please.  The mood, evolution of events, unfolding of the tale, the art of it, and especially the sound track are superb.  The story is about an odd young lady struggling to find a place in the world of relationships.  Her psyche and mental state unfold and reveal that she has a unique perspective of people and things. She sees people and beauty differently than most.  I don't want to say too much, but the film has extrene slasher type of gore and violence, surprising and unexpected as you move along with the film from the beginning - it takes you to surprising and unexpected places.  But be prepared, it is rather hard to watch.  What does the film mean?  It's not that kind of film - I don't think it means anything, it is just a painting or a portrait of a character and how she got that way.  It bears repeating that the soundtrack is perfect.

The father never said anything to the mother who was mean to May.  She gave May this weird doll that she made herself and told her, ""if you can't have friends you make your own"".  That should tell you what SHE was like as a child!  May never dated so when she becomes infatuated with a young man, actually with the young man's hands, she does some really strange stuff.  When she becomes way too freaky for him he won't have anything to do with her.  She then turns to her gay co- worker/only friend who's been trying to get with her, and any other gal!  May thinks this is an exclusive relationship but her friend NEVER intended it to be so when May finds her with another gal she comes unglued.

1884436,4,B00009MEC4,"This is not a film to take literally. Instead, you have to stand back and appreciate the broader story it tells. That story is about how negative experiences in childhood, create baggage that haunts our adult relationships. And if we fail to get treatment for this baggage, we can spiral out of control and harm those who come into our lives (emotionally or physically).

The acting was absolutely superb by all involved. I love Sisto, and I have a new appreciation for the lead actress (I had never seen her work). The movie is packed with metaphors. From the very beginning, the mother takes a minor physical abnormality and rather than encouraging May to appreciate her body, she orders her to cover it up. Hiding herself, only makes her more awkward (are you a pirate?). She never got the chance to fit in because she was always self-conscious and hoping that someone would accept her. This didn't happen at home or at school. In adulthood, this cycle repeats itself. The moments with Sisto were painfully accurate. If you have dealt with your own emotional baggage from childhood, then May's interaction with Sisto's character might resonate.

The most brilliant scene, however, involves the blind children. The blind kids would not judge her appearance at all. They wanted to interact with the inner-child that May kept locked up in the glass case. By fighting to shield herself, she ends up getting destroyed. Despite their innocence and their inability to judge the young ""doll,"" May keeps hiding.

I love the film. It became a little bloody near the end, but I kept reminding myself that it is not a slasher film. The slashing was simply part of the metaphor. In a word: BRILLIANT.",1356652800,5,1690,4.820689655172414

The film falls somewhere between the tongue in cheek horror of John Waters and gore-fests for the sake of gore like ""The Hills Have Eyes"". I found myself watching, continually waiting for any kind of credible internal justification for the characters. Of course, the problem of writing characters that are cardboard cut-outs is that their best use is as recyclables in your bin.

1884455,5,B00009MEC4,"May is CLEARLY in a category of its own.  A horror movie yes, but an intelligent and exciting alternative to being scared.

It's about a teenage girl with severe psychotic tendencies that just seems weird and off-putting at first, but once she finds the inner strength to meet the guy of her dreams, it's gradually revealed just how crazy and messed up in the head she is.  I don't really want to spoil anything more, just know that her demeanor is that of a secluded girl who doesn't know how to properly talk to the guy she's attracted to so she basically acts like a hermit in front of him, and she has her own special doll at home that she communicates with and uses as a way to obtain advice, I kid you not.  A really warped and bloody storyline.

Without a doubt, intended for the mature audiences.  However, due to the nature of the content, it's highly inappropriate for children.

1884457,2,B00009MEC4,"I heard a lot of positive things about this heralded ""cult"" movie. Now that I have seen it...what's the big deal?

Before a criticize this flick, let me put things in perspective. I am assuming that this is a low budget, indie movie where the director had to do everything. The guy is trying to make something out of nothing which is not only admireable but also, it is unfair to compare it to mainstream cinema where there is a real budget to accomplish things. If this is truly a do it yourself film, then this is an achievement since the acting of the protagonist is good, the production values are decent, the editing flows and the movie has a sheen.

However, to judge this as a horror movie, a felt that the film is grossly overrated. The story has been told before...person loses their sanity, society is mean to them, they retreat to their private world and ""do some killing"". This movie is quite derivative of films such as ""Pieces"", ""Maniac"", ""Carrie"", and ""Fade to Black"". Not that those are great movies and cannot be touched but the making of private being out of pieces has been done plenty of times.

A lack of originality in contents can be overcome with originality in presentation...and that is where this movie falters.  There is no horror, suspense, tension or mystery. This is not scary in any way.

While the character of May becomes menacing it is hardly believable. Her kills occur because her victims simply freeze from her. She cannot be deemed a genuine threat so her actions are completely unbelievable.

This movie would have been better if the camp, gore and general zaniness would have been toned down and a more realistic mode of ""losing it"" been the focus.

This is just your average shlock that finds it's way to a movie channel.

By the way, I don't like the director at all. His narrative style is horrible for the genre.",1320105600,,1857,4.589123867069486
1884458,5,B00009MEC4,"I overlooked this film for a long time. Don't get me wrong, i always support independent horror films, low budget; movies that are made for the viewer, the genre and movies that want to say something to true film audiences, not the Hollywood commercialized masses that never venture beyond the multi-million dollar budgeted nonsense. So, i watched May, and was moved, scared, disturbed and was brought to laughter, and almost tears, well, almost, but don't tell anybody....

We get just a glimpse of the core of May's suffering when we see her as a child with an eye defect. She is an outcast, to a degree, but her mother's behavior, definitely fed her pain. Soon enough we  see May as an adult, working in a veterinarian clinic. I won't go into detail about what ensues, because by now, you get the idea of what happens in the film  from all of these great in-depth reviews that are written here.

The film was brilliant in many ways. The acting was top notch, especially from the lead Angela Bettis as May, wow such a powerful performance by her! Im sure she was better than many female leads the year this film was released..by far! Her acting is powerful. She moved me, made me feel such compassion and sadness for her, that in a way, i wasn't furious at her for what she did, although i was like ""damn May... don't do it."" hahaaha.  There is a point in the movie when we see her take her first step into the world of becoming psychotic, and even within that place, I still never hated her. People were cruel to her, not extremely cruel, but most had little if any regards towards understanding her extremely fragile soul, in fact people saw her fragility.. and took advantage. The lack of humanity and compassion for others and their weaknesses is a very strong theme here. The characters here who hurt May, seemed more concerned with their own ego, and not how May could be affected by their own immediate selfish needs. You see no one was brutal or vicious with her, it was more of a passive aggressive abuse that she endured, which of course can have a terrible effect on one as well.

Even within her venture into insanity, we see May still has compassion, such is evident when she is working with blind children, a scene that is quite heavy. May begins to totally lose her mind, and although we cannot excuse her acts, we utterly understand where it comes from. I was saddened to see her go into that realm, throughout the movie i wished i could have helped her, explained things to her, helped her understand her own pain. Thats how great Angel Bettis' performance  was, you kinda wanted to jump into the film and protect her. It bothered me to see someone  being psychologically abused as an adult, especially when they come from that history as a child. May was not so much a character study, but more so an examination of the after-shock.. the results of a damaged soul. But as i said, even on another level, it's a study on those people that move through life not concerned with their words and actions which can be hurtful, even crushing to an already fractured human being.

I really dug this film. It was much more than a horror film., and by the way, it had some blood and guts too, for those that want that, but it wasn't too brutal. May was superb.. acting, direction, story line, creepiness, emotions.. so much was conveyed here that makes me so appreciative of this film, i am really thankful i added this to my collection. ""Horror films"" like this, need to be revered..and watched, more often than these terrible shock type blood and guts, CGI remakes that Hollywood pumps out by the dozens. This will be a classic, well..it already is i believe!

Readers, please forgive me, I didn't want to give an in-depth review on the plot, the characters, their development and all a' that stuff, because as i stated in the beginning many other reviewers did that brilliantly so i didn't just want to be repetitive, i wanted to express to you the emotions it made me feel and the power of the things within the film that stuck with me throughout it, and i think that's what great films are meant to do, touch us in certain ways, allow us to examine, relate or understand life through film. May definitely stays with you.

Angela Bettis in a fair world, should have been nominated for her performance....

Angela Bettis was perfect as the odd psychotic May. May is a lonely woman with a troubled childhood because she had a lazy eye. She has no friends and always talks to a creepy doll named Suzie. She tries to make friends and begins a relationship with a man named Adam. She becomes too weird for him, and dumps her. She becomes even more crazy and decides to build a Frankenstin-style friend out of human parts from those who wronged her. This film is a crazy decent into madness, and I loved every bit of it.

1884460,5,B00009MEC4,"If you've never seen this little gem, then I highly suggest you watch, and pay attention. Don't read the reviews, watch for yourself so you can form your own opinion.

But if you want an objective review that doesn't really spoil much the summary goes like this.

May is a sheltered girl who grew up with a lazy eye, and as a little girl she had to wear an eye patch as a kid. The kids were all cruel, and made fun of her by calling her a pirate. To make up for her lack of friends her mother gets her this antique doll in a glass case. However it's for display only, and May cannot remove it from its case. So May grows up, with this antique doll being her only friend.

There is a creepy twist at the end, and the doll becomes a very integral part of this movie. It makes you hurt when you see the end scene at the beginning, and then the movie leads you into building up the events. May is not your typical horror movie. It's a psychological thriller, so you're going to have to watch in order to decide whether or not you like it.

May is definitely worthy of being added to your dvd collection. Especially if you want to have something that isn't the norm.",1312675200,2,1161,4.123893805309734
1884461,4,B00009MEC4,"Angela Bettis is one of the more underrated actresses in Hollywood or Indie cinema for that matter but we can't hold it against her. One look at her film resume & we can be restfully assured she is every bit an actress although her name rarely comes up in conversation amongst moviephiles as often as it should. Perhaps she is yet to secure the role which will not only define her as a serious actress & tap into unknown dimensions we've yet to experience. I do have faith she will one day nab this role which will land her the acclaims she rightfully deserves & hopefullly that film will see the light of day. Having said that, I still believe that May comes pretty close.

While not completely a slasher film per se, I think May is more of a complex psychological study with liberal doses of gore & humor. In fact, I think the film could easily pass as a sequel to the German horror film Nekromantik although less gory & far less explicit. It baffles me how the screenwriters may have initially sold the idea to Lions Gate & the studio's initial response as May is anything but you're conventional horror/thriller flick.

May is a very attractive young girl with some serious issues.

One could go so far to say her problems began as a child when she was  diagnosed with an eye problem that required a patch. Sadly, her mother doesn't provide much assistance or support but rather comes across as abrasive or overbearing. In essence, May's childhood offers the foundation of  insecurity & parental suffocation which would only progressively get worse as she grows older.

Most of the story deals with a grown-up's attempt to deal with life & perhaps even find a little love in the world. Naturally, May tries very hard to be accepted but her mental instability makes it near impossible to keep friends or lovers. As a result of mental issues which were never fully addressed in the earlier stages, May learns what a lot of us learn in life but she utilizes her newfound wisdom a bit differently.

There are so many beautiful parts but not beautiful people.

You can probably take guesses at this point in terms of which direction the film will head & you're first three won't count. Inevitably, the film grows darker with each frame & we  are eventually subjected to a few slayings which most of us are glad to embrace. Yay!

I really did like this film. Honestly, I could relate in some odd way to her character. I think May is a great film for anyone who has ever felt alone or like a loser at some point in their life. May does a fine job of carefully examining the character & showing it's audience that mental illness can reside with anyone really irregardless of how attractive they may appear to the naked eye.",1309219200,2,2719,4.530612244897959

I watched this when it came out in 2002 and I couldn't remember the title but this movie has haunted me ever since and now I'm glad to have found it again.  May's theme, ""If you can't find a best friend, make one"" literally.  Angela Bettis who also starred in tv remake 'carrie', lucky mckee's new film, 'the woman' and several other lesser known films is the greatest under-rated actress of our time.  She is perfection.  She belongs in a class all to herself.  ""May"" defines what makes a good horror movie and even though this movie is classified as horror, it has more than it's share of laughs but of the creepy kind.  It is shocking in places and Anna Farris also stars in ""May"" as one of her weirdo co-workers who also shares a crush on ""May"".  She grew up misunderstood even throughout her adulthood, searching for someone to 'get' her and appreciate her.  She is let down by one friend after another until she snaps and then changes from her peppermint patty type to the terminator.  If you watch this film closely and examine it as closely as I did, you will see the extraordinary acting, setting, plot and over-all make-up of this film.  It is sooooo under-rated.  I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.  Lucky Mckee is one of the greatest twisted horror movie writter/directors known.

1884464,5,B00009MEC4,"I really like the director and writer of this movie, Lucky McGee. He's done some other work such as Roman (movie) and Sick Girl from the Masters of Horror.  This movie is about a girl named May who has a lazy eye.  Her mother had her wear a patch over her eye when she was little so she wouldn't get made fun of for having a lazy eye.  She has a birthday party and her mother gives her a doll that is kept behind a glass case.  May is told to never take it out, and the doll quickly becomes her only friend.  When May is older she works at a vet clinic and it isn't said if she talks to her parents any longer.  I doubt it because it is never brought up and she seems very lonely.  May tries to begin a relationship with a guy, but it doesn't work out because of her doll.  Later, when May discovers that only her doll is there for her and even her doll lets her down in the end, she decides to make her own doll out of people parts.  It's a funny movie in a sick way.  It's sort of sad in a way because May doesn't seem to have friends because of how her parents raised her.  However, it is a very well-done movie.

1884478,5,B00009MEC4,"""May"" is a dark thriller/horror film that many people seem to forget about despite all of the content that the film provides.  Using dark atmosphere, twisted demeanor, and foreboding and haunting themes and images, ""May"" does a good job of providing an excellent sense of horror that many will surely enjoy.  The premise of the film is sort of a mixture between Frankenstein and Carrie and the end result is something truly disturbing and worthy of being watched at least once.

The film begins by showing a young girl by the name of May.  May has a lazy eye that requires her to wear an eye-patch during her childhood, an act that the other children mock her for, teasing her that she's ""a pirate"".  As she ages, the young girl has problems making friends due to her appearance, so her mother makes her a custom doll named Suzie.  May's mother tells her that she should never take Suzie out of her glass container though, since the doll is special, a wish that May honors until her adulthood.

From here, the film cuts away to depict May as a young woman, now living on her own as a veterinarian assistant.  May still deals with rejection from other humans, due to her lazy eye, and decides to go to the doctor for correction.  Her optometrist prescribes May with contact lenses that will correct the eye problem by drawing the pupil forward and central to the rest of the eye.  The lenses begin to work, and May now begins to lust after a young man by the name of Adam whom she saw working at a nearby bodyshop.

May is a socially awkward adult, reminiscent of Carrie, and as a result still struggles making friends.  Her only friend seems to be her lesbian co-worker Polly (played by Anna Faris).  When May finally gets a chance to talk to Adam, she is rather inept at holding conversations, and instead focuses on his hands.  She tells him that he has beautiful hands, and is always caught staring at them or having them caress her face.  May's obsession with body parts extends past Adam.  May is obsessed with Polly's neck, constantly telling her that she has a beautiful neck.

As the film progresses, May's obsession with body parts grows to unhealthy heights.  She begins to get more violent towards others as the film progresses, until the final night where she eventually loses all hopes of sanity that may have been left within her fragile mind.

The film contains grotesque scenes of violence, such as the murder of a cat, children crawling on glass, and body mutilation.  These scenes add to the suspense of showing the slow transformation with May as insanity engulfs her with every passing day.  All of the actors do a great job of providing a truly fleshed out feeling for every character in the film.  Angela Bettis does an excellent job of portraying May in a truly haunting manner that is sure to stick with the viewing audience long after ejecting the disc.",1301875200,2,2878,4.601960784313725

May's other love in life is sewing, which is perfect because, when her attempts to make friends fail, May is going to make one of her very own. Sweetly macabre, May is a macabre fairy tale about a sad little girl who just wants to live happily ever after.

The brilliance of this film is the creation of a insane, ruthless character who we come to love and cheer on. Angela Bettis does an amazing job of making May so sweet and vulnerable, that when the killing starts, our affection for May isn't lessened; if anything, it is strengthened, as she turns from a bullied, insecure individual into someone who is assertive and strong.",1292544000,,788,4.549295774647887

As an adult, her doll continues to be her only friend while she works as a vet's assistant and enjoys making her own clothes at home as an accomplished seamstress. One day, she observes a boy that works at the auto shop from afar and falls in love with him and his beautiful hands. She goes out with him for a while, but scares him away with her odd behavior. This trend of people disappointing her and things generally going wrong extends to all of her friends and endeavors to reach out to people, so she decides to follow her mother's advice: ""If you can't find a friend, make one.""

This is an odd little gem of a film that I heard about on my search for more horror films to watch. It took me a while to find the DVD, but it was definitely worth the wait. May is a wonderful modern retelling of Mary Shelley's classic novel, Frankenstein.

The beginning of the film just makes me smile. May is so odd and sweet. Her budding romance with Adam is so cute and it seems as if they are made for each other. She is incredibly creepy and nonchalantly talks about a dog's stitches bursting, his guts spilling all over the yard, and dying because of a mistake by the vet. He makes weird cannibal romance films. Their relationship doesn't work out and Adam ends it, but doesn't extend even the opportunity for friendship to May.

I connect with May. I feel like I would be friends with her if she weren't homicidal. Like May, I also had to wear an eye patch as a child. I have never heard of anyone else having to do that, so I immediately felt a kinship with her. Her mother is incredibly overprotective, yet seemed really cold towards May. The beautiful porcelain doll in a glass box is a great metaphor for May's relationship with her mother, with May as the doll, protected but alone in her box. This image is reinforced when she dresses up as the doll for Halloween in the final night of the film. It saddened me when May really tries to find any sort of relationship and the results always proves disastrous. Although her actions are extreme and people hopefully wouldn't do that in real life, the motives behind it are understandable by anyone. Everyone can relate to feeling alone and wanting to connect with the people around them. In this way, May is like Dr. Frankenstein and the monster in one. She sets out to create a creature, but feels the anguish and loneliness that the creature feels. This character would be very easy to dislike and even demonize if it weren't handled as well as Angela Bettis did in the film. May does some very odd things, even before she resorts to murder, but the viewer is with her the entire way because of the endearing quality she has. She remained sweet in her own odd way, even while murdering people and sewing their parts together.

One of the aspects of the film that I liked is the doll that is May's only close friend. It talks to her throughout the film. At first, the viewer figures that May just talks to it like a person would talk out loud to themselves. Later on in the film, when May's life is crumbling around her, the doll seems to be screaming at her, conveyed by soft, incoherent murmurings and the cracking of the glass surrounding the doll. The cracking gets deafening when May talks to Adam to try to spend time together and he rejects her, partly because she yelled very loudly in an effort to silence the doll. The moment where May's world really unravels completely is accompanied by the destruction of the doll and the glass box that protects it, which extends the May as a doll metaphor.

This film is very memorable with its almost fairy tale feel coupled with grisly scenes of murder. It straddles the line between horror and comedy, resulting in great black comedy. I would recommend this unique film to just about everyone just to get it out there, but it seems like such a quirky movie that only a select few would actually like it.",1287792000,4,4296,4.385194479297365
1884481,5,B00009MEC4,"""May"" recently popped up on Crapcast's Fearnet and I was pretty surprised because it wasn't the usual low-budget, bottom of the barrel garbage that they normally shovel in week after week.

Instead, ""May"" is an intricate story of love, self-acceptance, and despair. Although some elements of ""May"" are classic horror, the movie is unlike any other horror I have seen in ages. Because it's more or less a coming of age type of movie.

Angela Bettis plays the title role like a fine violinist in a symphony orchestra. Her lack of empathy, and her dispassionate emotions about life in general come off as so real and honest that I can almost reach out and touch her. There is something about May that is so familiar and almost inviting. She wants people around her so much. And as she is pulling them in closer with 1 hand, she is simultaneously pushing them away with the other. Jeremy Sisto as May's sometimes boyfriend Adam also was compelling while also being distant and maintaining a level of macabre.

""May"" movie and character respectively are both incredibly complex. It's really like watching a movie within a movie within a movie. There is a lot going on. And anyone with a beating heart will have to feel something for May. If you're expecting the usual gore-fest (which I love, BTW) this movie is not for you. Instead, ""May"" is a tangled web of psychosis, betrayal, suspense and intrigue.

I judge a good movie not just on how much I was entertained while it was on, but also by how much it provoked thought. ""May"" was able to provoke a lot of thought because there are so many people in this world that we throw away and probably resurface as May. Remember, if you can't find a friend, just make one.",1285804800,,1711,4.6
1884482,5,B00009MEC4,"May is a crazy girl because she had a crazy momma. May's momma wasn't as crazy as May because ain't nobody as crazy as May!

May's got a lazy eye that her momma makes her cover up with a pirate looking black eye patch. May can't make no friends looking that way. One little boy even walks up to her and asks her if she's a pirate.

May's momma gives her a doll that she won't even let May take out of the glass box. That doll is May's only friend and the one she talks to. That leads the viewer to believe that the doll might become something like Chucky and start killing people but this ain't an evil doll movie. The doll is just a doll and doesn't do anything. May's the crazy one that does things.

May works at an animal hospital and is numb to things that would shock and sicken most normal people.

Eventually May's doll gets torn up and then May wants to make her own human doll out of different people's pretty parts.

May is weird, odd, lonely, and very pretty when she's not talking. When she is talking she comes off with some strange comments at the wrong times.

May has some short term experiences with a boyfriend, a lesbian, a live cat and a dead cat.

More movies should follow the ""May"" formula by telling very quick and easy to understand character backstories. This is one of those movies that you can watch, not take a break from and be interested and involved every second of the way.",1277942400,,1407,4.247191011235955
1884483,5,B00009MEC4,"I saw May probably when I was about 16, when it first came out. It was one of the best movies I had seen up to that point. Funny, in a twisted sense, and dark, the movie is about one girl's dreams of finding the ""perfect"" lover. If you have a dark sense of humor, or simply love a good movie with a twist, watch this. Eight years later, it's still one of my favorites!",1272153600,,368,3.92
1884484,1,B00009MEC4,"This was slower and lamer than a legless, comatose cow, and twice as unexciting to watch. Nothing happened for the first hour, then something gross yet predictable happened, then the rest of the movie was silly and even more utterly predictable. A good cast was wasted in this film, which needed a decent scriptwriter like the Sahara needs rain. The only loveable character in the whole movie gets killed by an ashtray, and after that, if you're anything like me, you just won't care about the fate of the rest of them. I don't think this qualified as a horror movie, because horror movies are supposed to have you on the edge of your seat, scared and wondering what's going to happen next. This movie just had me betting with my boyfriend what would happen next (I predicted pretty much everything that happened -- if only lottery numbers were this easy to predict!) and wishing that time would magically find a way to move faster so the slow and steady torture could be over. The only real horror was in how much I payed to buy the dumb DVD. My boyfriend (who isn't normally squeamish; I mean, his favourite show is 'Dexter'!) stopped watching the movie after the disgusting ashtray scene. He refused to go on. Even seeing Anna Faris as a hot and promiscuous gay woman wasn't enough to tempt him to continue. I finished the movie without him. I wish I hadn't bothered, though. This was BAD. It tried to be edgy and daring and titillating, but in the end, it became a hollow mockery of all those things. I was surprised not to see the name 'Allan Smithee' appear in the closing credits, and appear a LOT.

If I had to find something good to say about this film, it might be hard, except maybe that the final song on the soundtrack wasn't bad.",1249257600,4,1743,4.4984227129337535
1884485,4,B00009MEC4,"The Bottom Line:

A horror film about a disaffected, morbid young woman and her attempts to connect with something (or anything) in her life, May is not always easy to watch but if you like disturbing films then you should check it out; it's a polarizing motion picture but it's different enough to be worth watching.",1245369600,,317,4.660714285714286
1884496,5,B00009MEC4,"I remember catching this movie, late night on some channel somewhere and I loved it. It has a great deliberate pace and the whole thing felt awkward and creepy, in the most intentionally good way. The movie leads up to an awesome final sequence and the main character May, played so chillingly well by Angela Bettis that it will...well, give you chills. I would say more thriller than horror, but if you are into these types of movie I think you will love it...",1242518400,,461,4.5
1884497,4,B00009MEC4,"The credits at the end of this film had long stopped running, and yet, I was still riveted on my couch, wondering what I had just watched.  Lucky McKee has created a deliciously deranged piece of art!  Both poignant, funny, sad, sweet, ultimately disturbing in a profound way and cringe-worthy, May is an underrated and touching piece of cinematography.  The movie, although a ""horror"" flick, is so much more than that.  It is the subtle painting of a mentally disturbed mind, the excitement and joy of blooming romance, the harshness and cruelty of the human being, and then at the end the frightening reality that in some ways, we are always alone.

 In the title role of May Canady, Angela Bettis is phenomenal. This was, without a doubt, Bettis' film.  From the moment she began speaking to her doll at the beginning to the tragic moments at the end, she will captivate you.  I found myself both intrigued and disturbed that even at the end, I sympathized with May.  She made me cringe and gasp, and yet, I still loved her all the same.  That is a hallmark of a truly amazing actress.  She was not just the villain; she was also the heroine in her own way.  There's no doubt about it, May was weird, really weird.  But she was just adorable enough to intrigue everyone around her.  She was the epitome of ""twisted innocence.""

 May Canady was born with a lazy eye and grew up watching life from the outside looking in.  She is quiet, shy and socially awkward.  She lives a life she has created for herself, in a small apartment, and her only friend is a doll in a glass case named Suzy her mother had given her a long time ago for one of her birthdays.  May seems to have a normal life; she works at a vet clinic, spends her free time sewing and talking to Suzy...but May, like all of us, decides she wants a real friend.  Someone she can hold.  Therein lies the gut of the movie, that which makes it both darkly humorous and tragically sad.

 Enter the movie's several unique supporting characters, beginning with aspiring auteur and mechanic Adam Stubbs (played in a fabulously subtle way by Jeremy Sisto) and the slightly oversexed lesbian coworker, Polly (the beautiful and talented Anna Faris of Scary Movie fame).  It is the relationships that May forges with these main characters that cause her to do the things she does, and ultimately leads to the tragic ending of the film.

The movie in and of itself is worth watching if one is interested in seeing a unique, gothic, somewhat disturbing thriller flick.  It has several highlights.

Firstly, it is one of those rare horror flicks with good acting.  Yes, I said it.  Besides Bettis, Sisto and Faris, there are smaller, though not less interesting roles played by James Duvall, Nora Zehetner (if you haven't seen her before, check out Everwood and Heroes), and Nichole Hiltz, which are all delivered beautifully, in my opinion.

Secondly, this film sports a really awesome soundtrack.

Thirdly, there is Anna Farris.  I find myself wondering why this talent has been remembered only for the Scary Movie franchise, because she is so much better than that.

 Lastly, and that which stands out most to me, the relationship between Adam and May.  It was one of the most realistic portrayals of budding romance I have seen in film.  Though, of course, the movie is dark and twisted, the relationship between the two characters feels incredibly real.  This is clearly attributable to great actor chemistry, Bettis' ability to convey a myriad of emotions in every look and word, and in Sisto's ability to play off of Bettis without overshadowing her, and still making the most of the time he has onscreen.  You can't help but love these two together, even though you know things don't end well for them.  Bettis makes you feel May's excitement over a first date; her nervousness about her first kiss, and all the ups and downs of a young woman's first foray into romance.  Sisto does not fail to convey Adam's clear intrigue and ultimate attraction to a young woman who is as weird as he is.  And he is able to convey to the viewer that Adam is just as disappointed when the relationship comes to an end as is May.

Will Lucky McKee ever come up with another successful indie film?  I don't know, but I doubt it will be better than May.  See this film, forgive the slightly predictable outcome, and just enjoy Angela Bettis at her finest and Jeremy Sisto in what may be one of his most interesting and well-done roles.  It is a rare treat that a movie can make someone relate to a character that is as incredibly disturbing as is May Canady.",1242172800,,4598,4.601476014760148
1884498,5,B00009MEC4,"Ever since I first saw this film, I've tried to pin down what specifically was so good about it but with varying success.  It begins with an unnamed woman screaming into a mirror while covering a bloody eye-socket, cuts to doll limbs falling past a black void, and then to her childhood.  After this, one's first thought is ""this film better make good on this strange beginning and somehow reconcile it"".  Then there's the strange tone shifts, from light-hearted comedy to anguished violence that refuses to be mere slasher fodder.  In a lot of ways, the narrative of the film follows the protagonist's emotional development.  May is a stunted child.  The film goes from childhood to adulthood because nothing changed in the intervening years.  She lives in a world of dolls and dresses that she made.  Her life-long companion is a doll her mother gave her.  She lives in a world that she created and controls because she's as emotionally developed as a child and can only think in terms of immediate gratification, but she also has an urge for something a little more substantial.  Her child-like behavior and perspective are comical at first, and so are the reactions other people have to it, but as the movie progresses, you realize, to your horror, you are empathizing with the protagonist.  At the very end, there is a strange resolution.  The movie began in May's private world, and decisively ends there.  After I saw it for the first time, I didn't know how to react.  I basically returned it to Blockbuster and continued with my business, but something of the film stayed with me.  Then I bought it and watched it over and over again for months.

If I had to concisely name one thing that made this movie good, it might be that it perfectly expresses how people deal with the unknown, both in and outside of themselves.  When May slashes Polly's throat you can tell that Polly refuses to believe it's possible even while it happens.  Polly and Adam think everything May does is funny.  They see her as something ridiculous because  everything about her is abstract to what they are used to.  When something unbeleivable happens, the natural impulse is to immediately disbelieve and make light of it, which seems to be a coping mechanism.

Of course, that is a re-occurring halmark of the horror genre.  Everything Lovecraft wrote was about how wonderful it is that we have a system of emotional rationalizations that make it impossible for anything truly unknown to penetrate, and how terrible it would be if it ever did.

I guess this movie picks up with a rather Wall-like thesis (that is, Pink Floyd's Wall).  Each human being is totally, irreconcilably foriegn to everyone else, and no one can really penetrate on a soul-to-soul level, and that one's own internal, emotional landscape doesn't resemble the internal landscape of anyone else, and is irreconcilably foriegn.  The film starts within May's perspective, shows the total irreconcilability with anyone else, then returns to May's perspective.  Lucky McKee himself said in an interview that a reoccurring theme in his work is how each human being is fundamentally alone.",1238371200,2,3141,4.877358490566038
1884499,5,B00009MEC4,"""So many pretty parts, no pretty wholes"" is my favorite quotation from the movie. I love this damn movie. Unforgettable and spooky, it speaks to the invisible, lonley freak in all of us. May is such an admirable killer, sweet and quiet, cute and loving...just not loved back. The music, the victims' characters throughout the movie and the ending add greatly to its artistic integrity; the ending could not have made it more of a masterpiece.",1237852800,2,442,4.828947368421052

Then, came May hiding behind a tree and I thought ""Okay, she's hot"". Then the scenes rolled fast and furious, with each movement of her hands, eyes, Bettis' body language I knew I was watching a special performance.

May is a great movie because Angela Bettis is sheer perfection in the roll. There isn't an actress in Hollywood that can hold a candle to Ms Bettis.

May isn't particularly scary or gruesome, it's an excellent character study of a lonely woman who gradually loses what's left of her fragile mind.

  YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY SEE THIS *ONE OF A KIND* MOVIE

  I remember when I first saw this movie.  My best friend's girlfriend begged me to see it, knowing that I had a great taste for the bizarre and unusual, and a pretty dark sense of humour.  After that night, it became one of my top 10 favourite movies.

  I remember feeling empathy for May as it started out with her as a young girl, going to school with an eye patch on, to cover her lazy eye, and becoming an outcast after her schoolmates asked is she was a pirate.  To make up for her loneliness, she became best friends with a doll her mother gave her for her Birthday, that she had made when she was a child, herself.  Her mother prized this doll and always forced May to keep in a glass case for safety.  She could never take it out, she could never touch it, never cuddle it.  And that doll was still her best and only friend, when May became of age.  Now imagine how you would feel, never having any friends, nor any family that ever really showed you any warmth at all.  Only having a doll that you could never touch... Just stare at and talk to.  May craved for friendship and any sort of love to fill her otherwise, empty, lonely life, but was too shy and weird (in an almost enduring way - to me at least) to do anything about it...  Until she met Adam.  In an innocently awkward and clumsy sort of way, she begins to talk to him.  Adam (with a mix of curiosity and sort of feeling bad for May) befriends her and soon May believes she's in love.  However, being an antisocial for all of her life, has had an impact on her, and she tries to do her best to get Adam to like her back, but inevitably screws up and Adam freaks out.  After Adam refuses to have anything to do with her, she starts to try to form a friendship with whoever gives her the time of day.  Eventually, due to her disturbed childhood and social awkwardness, and as her mind slowly unravels, May comes to the conclusion that maybe she can take parts she likes from people that reject her friendship, and create the perfect life sized doll that will love her unconditionally.

  This movie really has some interesting and accurate portrayals of how life can be for some unfortunate people, and how sometimes society might be totally blind to your mental health, and how every step that happens, can drive a person off the edge and into total insanity.  And if it does nothing else, it will DEFINITELY enforce the fact that you should always try to be kind and forgiving to others, who might simply just be lost and not so much different from ourselves at times.",1227398400,,2727,4.2734375

1884530,4,B00009MEC4,"Lucky McGee, the director, also did a short film for Masters of Horror called ""Sick Girl.""  Both movies star the same talented actress who plays May (though with an annoying accent in ""SickGirl."")

What struck me most was the similarities between the two movies as far as where the sympathies of the director (and hence audience lie).  Lucky McGee seems to only care for horror movies where the ""horror villain"" is actually the anti-hero to the movie.  In a way this makes things less scary if you are able to completely place yourself into the role of the awkward oddball girl in May who ends up putting together her own ""Frankenstein"" man.

This is refreshing in some ways and definitely makes the movie ripe for a comedic side since by making a friend of the ""monster"" it also lessons the intensity and horror side of the film.  I guess Mr. McGee is trying to show that we are all ""Frankensteins"" or ""Draculas"" and that even the worst murders are just ""misunderstood.""  These themes are developed in May but are even in more obvious when taken together with the aforementioned ""Sick Girl.""

Overall this is a well-made horror/comedy/twisted-romance film and is good for anyone looking for something a little different. If you liked it I also recommend ""Sick Girl"" though it is not as original or unsettling as this film right here.",1191369600,3,1334,4.744588744588745

She gives her a doll to help substitute for friends. She keeps this doll all the way to adult hood. She talks to it as if it is a living breathing person. Her relationships are both hetrosexual and lesbian. She tries to find the one person to love her and only her and not just a one night stand.

She decides to make her ""perfect mate"", from pieces of people that she finds attractive. She sews them together and presto! The perfect mate! This certainly is a horror movie of a different genre. It is acted very well and the story is very orginal. If you liked the twisted and ""wierd"" type of movies, then I certainly recommend this one!!! You won't forget it!!!",1181001600,,903,4.22543352601156
1884546,4,B00009MEC4,"I liked this film.  Samantha Adams is somewhat brilliant as poor, demented little May, trying to find love while at the same time escaping the memories of her psychotic mother, represented by the very creepy doll in her possession that has some kind of a psychological hold on her.  You can't help but feel somewhat sympathetic to May, at least until she starts her killing spree.  Anna Faris is kind of sexy as May's co-worker, Polly, who successfully seduces the girl in a one-night-stand that I actually found quite erotic!  Later, May also voices her attraction regarding the legs of Anna's new girlfriend, Ambrosia, played by Nichole Hiltz.  While I could never call this a tender love story, it was certainly interesting, and erotic in parts, as well!",1177027200,,757,4.8828125
1884547,5,B00009MEC4,"I absolutely loved this movie. I had seen the cover before while walking around in the movie rental place, but never actually thought to get it. It was New Year's Eve/Early Day when I actually sat down and watched it. It was strange, almost like watching a cult classic or something. But to try and understand the pain and lonliness that May felt towards the end of the film just made me cry. So, I would advise anyone that has thought of watching it, but has never gotten around to it, should definitely watch it. It was absolutely, 100%, purely AMAZING!",1175990400,2,555,4.5049504950495045
1884548,4,B00009MEC4,"A lonely girl named May leads an isolated existence with no companionship other than her encased doll, until one day she meets the perfect guy. Slowly she comes out of her shell as her doll's case cracks more and more. After getting rebuffed by her man and a woman and even a cat (!), she begins her mental descent into madness culminating in the final scene where she finally gets what she always wanted.

May is an updated version of Frankenstein with the girl mistaken for a pirate (monster) for wearing a corrective eye patch. There are themes of isolation, loneliness, and insanity. May speaks of liking people, most of them anyway, and disliking certain parts. May is the perfect embodiment of the awkward girl struggling for attention. I believe only Bettis could have pulled off this difficult role. She is both vulnerable, yet powerful at the same time.

The supporting cast is great particularly Anna Faris (Scary Movie 1-5) who plays the mighty flirtatious lesbian co-worker Polly. And while that description sounds cheesy, her character is anything but. She steals almost every scene she is in and I am completely smitten with her. She holds her cat and sulks across the screen purring like a pussy herself. Jeremy Sisto plays the cute, but aloof Adam whose room is covered in Dario Argento's Opera posters. He shows his character drawn to May's quirkiness, yet repulsed by her natural desires.

I think in different hands with different actors, the film would have failed miserably. But each actor made his or her character someone unique. This film also works as a shining example of McKee's great storytelling skills. Haunting moments include dead cat play, bloodied eyeballs, blind kids crawling over glass, scissor stabbings, and a very creepy doll.

Released in 2002 by Lions Gate, the movie clocks in at 93 minutes. There is apparently missing footage from the movie such as multiple scenes of young May featuring the ""Bird Wing Chopping"" scene where May tries to make her doll fly. Hopefully, this will get re-released at a later time with the extra scenes.

DVD Extras: Hidden Trailers and some interesting Commentary. The German release has production notes and Biographies, while Australia provided a 14 still Photo Gallery.

Favorite Quote: Polly, ""The Doctor needs you to do a Fee-Ko Zam on the Miss Ka-Tay. Does that make any sense?"" May, ""Fecal exam on Miss Kitty.""

Bottom Line: Very unique tale of a lonely girl that builds her best friend.

Rating: 8/10

After all the movies ive seen (ALOT of them) May really stands out as being in its own kinda genre. The movie was creey and all the conversations in the film were extrememly awkward which definitely adds to Mays whole plot and feeling. The movie wasn't as gory as I thought or was told it was, but it was still relly good. The movie is extremely creepy and odd but in a really good way. I recommend it but im sure most people out there won't like it,unless you're into indie horror films. But if you're looking for a gorefest youll be dissappointed. All in all though i liked it.

If you're lonely, buy a dog, or try keeping a boyfriend and not scaring him off, but, by no means, do you begin to start killing people off and sewing their body parts together to make you a friend. This chick was seriously messed up. At any rate, I see all the rave reviews, and I don't understand it, but I guess I don't share the morbid imaginations. Afterall, I wouldn't be surprised if this turns out to be a cult classic. I just didn't like it though.",1171238400,,647,4.2682926829268295

I found this trying to hunt down the greatest horror flicks ever, but this is a different kind of horror flick.

1884553,3,B00009MEC4,"""May"" is a maladjusted young adult making a living as a veterinarian assistant that's had a hard time making friends since childhood. When she does befriend someone, they are just as weird as she is. May's only friend from childhood that followed her into adult life -- a doll that apparently speaks to her (or May is schizophrenic, which doesn't seem likely) -- is even more bizarre than any of her other friends.

This forms the plot of a horror film that will titilate fans of the genre and almost certainly disgust fans of mainstream Hollywood productions. ""Amy"" will impassion horror fans because it is unique and because it breaks certain film ""rules"" including a nongraphic animal slaying. It will dismay oters because it is unrelentingly ugly and its actors are all too realistic. Indeed, a thread of being too real for comfort style runs throughout the production and gives its eerie aspects a certain credibility.

The storyline follows May from her youngest days battling amblyopia (lazy eye) and watching children put off by her eye patch...through the sheltered world she shares with a weird doll her mom made for her...to her adulthood as a vet assistant that ""mostly sews things""...to her adult relationships with a bizarro boyfriend and lesbian coworker...to her exploding madness generated from her inability to stay connected with anyone or anything -- animal, vegetable or mineral. At this point the film bursts open with violence and extreme horror imagery. ending with a whimper in the strangest horror sequence you've ever seen.

""May"" is enthralling from start to finish, albeit a bit slow in tempo while everything unfolds, and ends in a flourish. When I watched it the first time I was totally immersed in its authentic creepy canvass. But, alas, when I watched it the second time it just seemed like a second-rate independent horror production.

So which is it? I'd say it's both. It is sensationally different and genuinely horrifying. It is also produced on a dime (and looks like it) and features a lot of actors that could use some lessons on method technique. Spend some time with it because it's certain you've never seen anything quite like it.",1169337600,5,2177,4.956164383561644
1884554,5,B00009MEC4,"Nobody knows what to make of May (Angela Bettis). Born with a lazy eye, for which she wore a patch while growing up, she became a loner oddball whose only friend was a perfectly kept doll. She moves to L.A. and takes up with a filmmaker (Jeremy Sisto), but the relationship sours quickly -- and dangerously. She then befriends an alluring lesbian colleague (Anna Faris), but that, too, along with every connection May attempts to make, turns deadly. I found May accidentally one day while surfing the web. There were several very positive reviews, and as I am always open to discovering new independent films, I rented it as soon as possible. May  is the story of a girl who is born with a lazy eye and becomes very socially isolated as a result. Her only true friend is a doll enclosed in glass that she can never touch. The movie focuses on how May as an adult has reached the brink: she is either going to begin to learn to make friends and interact with people normally... or not. The movie is hip-deep in imagery and metaphors, most of which are fairly disturbing. May's attempts to interact with people will make you cringe with embarassment; many of the scenes are very bloody and the movie climaxes with some fairly graphic violence. But it's the more subtle imagery- primarily focusing on May's doll- that really set the creepy, uncomfortable tone. You can't believe something like this could ever happen... but on the other hand, you almost can. The underlying idea is a fairly common and basic one: the desire to make a connection with another human being. May takes that promise and puts a new, disturbing, and fascinating spin on it. If you are not able to handle graphic and disturbing images, May is not for you. If you like unique, disturbing, intelligently made movies that actually make you think, then you will love this film. Absolutely one of the best movies I have seen in years; I immediately bought a copy after watching it, and I can't give a much better review than that. My only complaint with the DVD is a lack of a ""making of"" segment; I would have loved a behind-the-scenes look",1169164800,7,2108,4.6063829787234045

If you don't like demented horror movies that can be painful to watch, stop reading. This movie is not for you.

But if you like demented horror movies with sick and strange stuff that happen to be written, directed, and acted very well, keep reading.

First, you need to know that I grew up watching horror movies. I love them. They are in my blood. I love the scares, the thrills, the twists, the monsters, the madmen, the blood, the guts... you get the idea. This is the point of view I am coming from. If you can't relate, you might not like this movie as much as I do. But keep in mind, while I love most horror movies, some movies are better than the rest. This movie is one of them.

Angela Bettis is a phenomenal actress. (If you don't believe me, check her out in the Masters of Horror episode ""Sick Girl"".) She plays May, the lonely girl who grew up with no friends because of her lazy eye. Her mother didn't help things by making her wear a ""pirate patch"" to hide it. Throughout the course of the movie you really come to care for May, even though she's a bit weird and even when she turns a bit psycho. You go through May's ups and downs as she searches for a friend. Every time she thinks she's found someone perfect, there is something wrong. There are so many perfect parts but not a perfect whole. The outcome of May's quest is shocking, sad, gruesome, and ultimately rewarding.

If you are looking for something better than the usual bimbos with big boobs running around like idiots and macho guys showing up to save the day, check out this movie about a sick chick who has the guts to make her dreams reality.",1168300800,,1702,4.30625

Immediately from the beggining the story is captivating when we see a young May struggling to fit in but is unsucessful. The movie jumps ahead to May as a young adult, you'll see that the socially abandoned little girl has grown into a quirky young woman. What most guys will like about the film is that May is that wierd girl who you think is cute but your apprehensive about approaching her, everyone knows someone who is kind of like May.

I'm proud to say that I watch my DVD of May several times a week lol. This movie will make you laugh, cry, and gasp. You feel her emotions as she struggles, falls in love, breaks. One more thing to remember...Watch it ALONE...it has a much greater effect.",1161820800,4,921,4.411764705882353

I felt for May in her weird little ways of trying to connect with other people.  But the movie moves too slow and gives scant background material about May's childhood.  Anna Feris (Waiting, Friends) gives a really funny perfomance.  I don't know if I would really classify this as a ""horror film"".  Sure it has some ""horror moments"" but it was more like a slow drama, or black comedy.  Angela Bettis is a great actress in the lead role.

1884571,5,B00009MEC4,"May is a peculiar sort of movie, part social commentary, part slasher flick.  It manages to succeed admirably at both, despite the fact that it's central star is a cute little misfit named May.

May Dove Canady (Angela Bettis) is a sheltered misfit.  Born with a lazy eye, she grows up wearing a pirate-like eye patch, only to be teased by children her entire life.  Her mother (Merle Kennedy) drives the point home: if you can't find a friend, make one.  And May's mother does just that, crafting a doll for her daughter with big, spooky eyes. The catch is that the doll can never be let out of her box.

And thus we have an allegory for May.  May tentatively explores her world through her job as a veterinarian's assistant and her interactions with her coworkers, the barely-understandable veterinarian (Ken Davitian) and the oversexed lesbian coworker Polly (Anna Faris).  Then May bumps into Adam Stubbs (Jeremy Sisto), a horror movie fan and budding auteur that specializes in gore.

Adam's first film is titled ""Jack and Jill,"" which starts out sweet: two lovers seem to want to devour each other...and then literally do so, biting and gnawing on each other's limbs in an orgiastic frenzy.  The movie deeply affects May, who is fascinated with Adam's hands. When May shift gears from foreplay to kink by biting Adam's lip, he dumps her.

All throughout the movie, May tries to connect with people.  She struggles with her relationship with Polly, who uses and abuses her.  Polly asks May to adopt her pet cat, a seemingly genuine gesture of friendship, only to discover that Polly never wanted the responsibility in the first place.  May also joins a school for teaching blind children.  When May brings her doll to class, the children are intrigued and frustrated: to a blind child, a glass box may as well be an iron vault.  They plead for her to release what's in the glass box, with tragic consequences for the doll.

Bereft of her only friend and infuriated by her inability to connect with the rest of humanity, May decides to make her own friend out of the components of everyone else. Then the killing begins...

All this could be very mundane.  But May is so much more. Warning: There are lots of spoilers below!

MAY AS DOLL: Polly calls May ""doll,"" and May is very much a pure, untouched creature with wide, staring eyes just like her doll.  Locked in her own glass box, May is always viewing the world from a distance.  She even kisses like her dolls, smashing them together with brutal force without any coordination. When the glass on her doll's box shatters, so too does May's universe.  Always watching, always a bystander, and never really touching or feeling anything...May is a walking faade, an entity pretending to be a person.

MAY AS SERIAL KILLER: May exhibits all the traits of an organized serial killer; she gets up every day and goes to work, has her own hobbies, and reads a lot.  But May is completely disassociated from reality.  She was most certainly abused.  When May screams at her doll to ""face the *** wall"" we know it's her mother's voice. She views people as their components parts, alternately admiring and lusting for them.  May starts by killing animals, and then escalates her rage until it transforms into murder. Frustrated, she finally releases her revenge by killing those she admires and keeping the trophies afterwards.

MAY AS GOLEM: The monster (named Amy) created from the parts of May's killing spree is animated only when she provides something of herself.  But Amy's creation is telling: she arranges the three letters of her name ""M-A-Y"" into ""A-M-Y.""  This is consistent with the creation of the medieval rabbis creating golems by writing the word ""emet"" (truth in Hebrew) on the golem's forehead to animate it.  By erasing the first letter, ""emet"" becomes ""meit"" (dead), thus deactivating the golem.  May can be seen as the inverse, finally living only through death, and slowly dying in her own life. Just as Amy is made from Adam's hands, God created Adam from clay--rabbis create their golems in the same fashion.

MAY AS MARY: May's just one ""r"" away from the virgin Mary of Christianity.  May freely admits she's still a virgin.  At the end of the movie, May gives ""birth"" to a creation, sacrificing herself so that her child may live. Most telling, the cover of the DVD portrays May with a Mary-like halo.  Closer examination reveals that the halo consists of scissors and scalpels.

MAY AS OUTCAST: For those of us who had an awkward childhood, we've all had our share of being teased.  Being called a freak can be hurtful.  But more interesting is May's relationship with those who fancy themselves on the fringe; both Polly and Adam say they ""like weird,"" but they really don't.  They like to be thought of as weird, but they're not really unique at all.  Adam and Polly are very much mundane, ultimately embodying what they supposedly are not: stereotypes.  Even Blank (played by James Duval, he of Donnie Darko), who has the weirdest hair-do in the movie, treats May like a total freak.  Ultimately, everyone from the blind children she teaches to her pet cat reject May.

MAY AS VOYEUR: May has gone through much of her childhood with one eye.  When she finally does get full use of both eyes, she watches everything with incredible intensity.  Her fascination with blind children makes her feel comfortable.  They can't look at her and judge her, but she can safely judge them.  Similarly, May is able to stalk Adam from a distance, watching him for hours at a restaurant. In the end, May sacrifices her eye so that she can watch, in her death, life being born through Amy.

MAY AS POSSIBILITY: The term ""may"" can express a measure of likelihood, possibility, desire, or fervent wish.  May is very much a wistful creature, hopeful about the possibilities of having a boyfriend and of relationships that take fruit only in her imagination. It is the shattering of all those possibilities that makes May's fall so heartbreaking.  She's cute.  She's innocent.  She's a little strange, but aren't we all?

May is one of those rare brand of movies that is both horror and drama, parable and slasher flick.  Director Lucky McKee comments that ""there's a lot of raw, personal stuff here"" and it shows, in bloody, angry, pathetic, beautiful detail, from the spring-loaded fake blade that Adam plays with to the aching loneliness of a blind child in the park.  McKee's masterpiece, like Donnie Darko, may well define its own genre.

For anyone who has ever been called a freak, for anyone who has ever been teased because of how they look, and for anyone who has ever become so exasperated with humanity that they despair there's no good left in the world...this movie's for you.",1153785600,63,6748,4.763135228251508
1884572,5,B00009MEC4,"If you want a creepy film that will force you to empathize with the 'bad' guy, here's the one. Angela Bettis is genius in her portrayal of May, an outcast constantly disappointed by unsuccessful attempts at friendship that begin with the assurance: ""I love wierd."" Unjustified, however, in her method for creating the perfect companion, she does put the horror in horrifying. The film never deviates from the storyline, but is not predictable. May sets the mood and never strays. Her character development, as well as that of the other cast members, make this a cinematic success. Not the 'feel good movie of the year,' May's production, editing, directing and acting are top notch.",1149292800,7,682,4.991228070175438
1884573,4,B00009MEC4,"May is the kind of person you are friends with only because you don't know how to get rid of her.  At least that's how everyone around May feels.  Played by Angela Bettis, May is an interesting character that explores what it means to be human and what society thinks of perfection.  Oh, and it's about blood, guts and gore.

In this darkly amusing fable, May has grown up with a lazy eye, an imperfection that has blackened her outlook on life.  Being taught to cover up and hide imperfection, May seeks out those who are perfect only to discover they are human and not perfect.  There is a lot of symbolism and subtle issues going on behind the scenes.  On one hand, this can be looked at as a modern retelling of Frankenstein.  But, on the other hand it is a love story and a slasher film.

However, by using the slasher genre to explore themes of loss and the human condition, writer/director Lucky McKee creates a film that really transcends the genre.  When at its best, May shows us how society is so transfixed on perfection that we lose sight of what makes everyone unique.  May, the character, becomes so transfixed on this idea of perfection (handed down to her by her crazed ""normal"" mom), that she goes insane in trying to replicate the perfect human.  What follows is hillarious but tragic and dark path down some of the worst of human nature.

The entire movie hinges on the performance of Angela Bettis and she does a terrific job bringing this antisocial and shy girl to life.  Her pain is achingly real so that when rejection comes from all sides, we can understand  her eventual breakdown.  Strong performances by Anna Faris and Jeremy Sisto even out the movie and bring in some bitingly refreshing humor.

A terrific movie, I would recommend giving May a chance if you are looking for humor and a moral to go along with your gore.",1145664000,5,1850,4.524096385542169

Suffice it to say it's one of those movies with lesser known actors that achieves a very satisfying texture and feel that is unique unto itself.  Watching a film and feeling like you haven't already seen it or at least parts of it in other films is a rarity.  But May is one of those films.  ""May"" affords the viewer a bizarre, yet sympathetic trip inside the life of a hopeless social handicapper and provides a few nervous laughs along the way.

Come on now Girls, you have to admit that you've at least once thought about doing some of the things May did in the movie. A woman scorned can be a very terrifing thing. But through the whole movie I couldn't but to feel nothing but sorrow for May, never having to experiance an actual relationship, and the lack of social skills are even scarey.

I always wanted to see this film, i saw previews and it looked interesting, since this was the girl who played a mental patient suffering from BDD in GIRL INTERRUPTED, and jeremy sisto is also a good actor and has been in many well known films such as clueless, and hideaway, and thirteen. This movie is extremely disturbing but does not fail as a successful horror film,  despite some parts which were amusing in a sick way. It really showed angela bettis's talent because she really played the part well, her facial expressions, and smiles at inappropriate times, and her naive personality doesn't come off as innocent, but rather shows how obsessive she is and how disturbed she keeps on getting. This was also a psychological horror, because if you know psychology, you'd know that the doll was like a metaphor. It was a symbol of her ""other side"" waiting to break out. (cracking of the doll box glass) And at the end, when she's screaming SEE ME SEE ME, she obviously felt ignored by people, and felt like an outsider, so see me, was her way of saying she was sick of being invisible. It reminded me of jeff dahmer, in which he too played around with body parts and was interested in dark things like satanic rituals, and weird books like in this film may read about amputations and mutialation ""for fun"". And this movie also had a new idea, the murderer turned out to be female, which is a rare thing. Most serial killers are male, so i give props to the writers, who actually had an original idea, and made a sucessfully creepy demented horror.",1136073600,2,1581,4.5473684210526315
1884589,5,B00009MEC4,"""May"" is one of those happy accidents where decent premise,  lazy pre-production, low budget, and erratic editing inexplicably combine to make a terrific film. Inexplicable is not entirely right. Although Writer/ Director Lucky McKee did live up to his name and get very ""lucky"" on this one, he also had the sense to cast Angela Bettis (Janet Webber in ""Girl Interrupted"") as his title character and the directorial wisdom to rein in her performance to an understated level that supports the black comedy spirit of his film.

The story is seen through the point of view of Bettis's May, a character with the social skills of Travis ""you talking to me"" Bickle (""Taxi Driver"") and the emotional stability of ""Repulsion's"" Carol. Bettis is one of those amazing actresses whose face is an expressive kaleidoscope. Film is usually shot at the rate of 24 frames per second and every frame would be needed to record the series of emotions Bettis could register on her face during each second. McKee recognizes this and keeps her in check, but enough leaks out for the viewer to sense that there is a coiled spring beneath the relatively placid surface. This is a lot like the effect Elizabeth Hartman had in her films and the connection is strikingly amplified by a close physical resemblance between Bettis and Hartman.

May is beautiful, fragile, and vulnerable; although wrapped as tight as Carol in ""Repulsion"" she elicits much more audience sympathy and protectiveness. McKee and co-star Jeremy Sisto wisely just let Bettis run with the ball and Sisto's Adam Stubbs stays a one-dimensional nice guy romantic interest.

The film can be roughly divided into two halves. The first half is a black romantic comedy with genuinely touching details as May finally gets contact lenses but is unsuccessful in several planned attempts to meet Adam; then ironically they meet by complete accident. The second half is a psychological thriller with both horror elements and black comedy. The surprising unity and balance between the two halves is where McKee really got lucky as the black comedy of the second half is actually facilitated by the low budget. Had the money been available to realistically stage the violence (and had McKee given in to the temptation to do so) it would have destroyed the unifying black comedy and compromised the film. This is critical because May's second half mental breakdown is accompanied by a physical transformation that would otherwise have disconnected the two halves.

Anna Faris (playing May's lesbian co-worker) also deserves praise for a great performance. Faris was unexpectedly good in ""The Hot Chick"" and she follows that up here with an inspired comic performance. Her delivery is far more funny than her actual lines.

Ultimately Bettis gives us a character you find believable, sympathetic, and terrifying. What makes her performance absolutely unique and special is that she does this while also providing multiple moments of humorous self-parody.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1134432000,4,3032,5.07429718875502

this movie is so compelling that i have viewed it several times. Angela Bettis is both haunting and beautiful in a manner that is both very real and knowingly off center.  this is not a movie for people who need a movie to spell out every detail for them - the story is moved through style. this movie looks great.

May is a girl who desires to be connected to others, is open to that possibility, but has no means to that end. others use her, then shun her, then, well, i ain't gonna ruin it.  perhaps think of this flick as ""CARRIE"" meets ""HEATHERS"".",1129939200,5,594,4.276785714285714

There is so much originality in this film it is completely unlike anything else you have ever seen. This one pushes the boundaries of horror filmmaking in every way possible but unlike some of its predecessors in the genre, the shock value here is done with such artistic subtlety that it sometimes feels less like a horror film and much more like the work of art of some unknown, unsung genius.

Angela Bettis's performance is absolutely flawless. May is a lunatic you can't help but be sympathetic to, no matter how far she goes to try to be happy.

This is one of the most twisted and brilliant horror pictures to come along in quite a while. Director Lucky McGee knows how to build and keep the intensity. I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in seeing a REAL horror film. May has some wicked humor but thankfully spares us the all too common cheese. Be careful if you're squeamish.

She finds herself attracted to Jeremy Sisto (a good performance here), but mainly is fascinated with his hands.  Her co-worker and only real friend (Scary Movie's delightful Anna Faris) is at heart a lesbian who likes to dally with as many sallies as she can.  May works as a veterinarian assistant, and in her spare time, makes clothes and other sewing niceties.  We can see up front that May is missing a few screws and when her boyfriend jilts her and best friend Farris starts seeing other women, it's just too much for May and she goes on a gory killing binge to accommodate what her mother told her:  if you can't have any friends, make your own.

1884603,2,B00009MEC4,"I watched this movie based on a review (not on Amazon). My expectations were high and I was very disappointed.
I think Angela Bettis is a great actress and it is a shame she chose to star in this movie.
May is a shy child who lost an eye when she was young. Her best friend is a doll her mother gave her. She grows up to be a veterinary assistant and seamstress. She also has grown up with little understanding of human beings and even less about human sexuality.
But May herself is not quite that innocent as she takes some glee at one point of the movie explaining how one of the dogs she worked on later bled to death. This does not make her character more complex only repulsive.
May falls in love with an art poseur, who takes on all of the affectations of the weird. But has no sympathy  for humanity or understanding of  art. (Of all the bizarre little trophies this art phony has on his wall you might be able to find his own heart because his chest seems to lack one.)
At the office May becomes involved with an aggressive lesbian. This is her brief education in love.
The sadistic things that befall this poor woman have no true emotional pay off or resolution at the end of the movie just a gimmick that ""sews things together"" so to speak. The movie is a long walk for a short glass of water. Further rather than the movie being sympathetic to those that are different it is outright attack on them. I also found the depiction of lesbians to be quite unfair and bigoted.
There were so many places where this movie could have been made into a better movie. Sadly those opportunities were not taken.
The movie does not work as a horror movie (as it lacks any suspense) or psychological study. I am not sure what it was intended to be. I found it to be a waste of time.",1114646400,2,1777,4.238938053097345

May is a charmingly shy and introverted young lady with the most beautiful hands I have ever seen in any film ""ever"".

May works as a Medical Assistant in a Community Animal Hospital, where she assists the Veterinarian with his operating theatre procedures.

This sweet, innocent, charming, shy and insecure lass falls head over heels for a local mechanic, or rather she is overwhelmed by his hands.

I shall not divulge the plot because to do so would only dull your imagination, but, there is plenty of blood and gore to suit most horror fans, you would need to be one eyed not to appreciate the finale.

And, yes, May does make a friend, one who has all the positive attributes she has always longed for.

May has grown into a woman who cannot escape the dark prison of herself. She is unable to transcend her own inner terror and debilatating emptiness. May is a mess. She has a doll (made by mum) named Susie, who is her only friend. Kept in a glass case, Susie is as untouchable to May as the rest of the world.

This is evident in ""May"", which by and large is ""the little horror movie that could', but ends up with a couple of flaws that makes it ultimately disappointing.  Namely, (1) the lesbian subplot was too over-the-top and stood out poorly against the rest of the movie, and I wonder if it was stuck in there just to cater to the lesbian-fetish crowd; and (2) May's ""snap"" into a murderous fugue state was too sudden and implausible; she went from this insecure fragile waif to an invulnerable scaupel-wielding mistress in the blink of an eye.

Still, the movie worth checking out, and if you're a horror fan who's less critical than me you'll probably love it.

1884636,4,B00009MEC4,"This movie is dark, violent and quietly interesting as a look into the mind of a lonely woman who decays into psychopathic behavior.

May (played perfectly by Angela Bettis) is born with a lazy eye that causes her to be outcast from her peers at an early age. She grows into womanhood not knowing or feeling love, admiration or respect except what her mind conjures up from a spooky doll that she claims as her best friend. May spends her days working in an animal hospital and her nights sewing parts of clothing together. Along the way she meets people that continue to treat her poorly, namely a mechanic with beautiful hands (Jeremy Sisto) and a co-worker seductress (Anna Faris). Desperate for a true friend May volunteers to help blind children and takes on the ownership of a cat but all of her relationships unravel just like the thread she works with every night.

Lucky McKee wrote and directed this off-beat and twisted film and in doing so managed to reach the darkest corners of human interest. We all carry insecurities and in our weakest state hope for revenge against those who betray our confidences, but thankfully most of us never go so far as May. McKee takes an in-depth look at how a mind twists after years of torment and loneliness, he offers a bit of humor and light hearted pokes at his character's despair before delving into the ultimate darkness.

May has a problem. Every time she begins to take interest in someone, the more flaws she sees in them. Only choice parts strike her fancy, and after the loss of the one man she loves, this little doll's out for a new kind of friend-making.

With only the now broken doll her mother gave her as a companion, May begins ""picking up the pieces"" to making the perfect friend.

Bettis' role is strong, as is Farris' (you may recognize her as Cindy from the ""Scary Movies""). The true role to study though (below Angie's of course) is Jeremy Sisto's character as the man--or should I say HANDS--of May's dreams.

Newcomer director Lucky McKee proves a master in his spring, and the deluxe commentary on the DVD proves this both humorously and insightfully. (*Note, the amateur sadomasochism short film Adam shows May in his home is actually an effort Dir. Lucky McKee made as film student in college.)

This film has been compared to the likes of Brian DePalma's ""Carrie,"" by numerous scornful critics, as well it should. ""Carrie"" is, however my first favorite movie, THEN May. McKee put together a brilliant cast at Lion's Gate Pro., and the finale, in which May's ""friend"" is complete, will either make you puke, or bring you to tears--personally I found it touching.

Lastly, for all you hard-core film scrutinizers out there, the largest and most talked about aspect of the film--at least in the commentary--is the cinematography and music. The killer slow and sometimes hard rock soudtrack links with the action quite well, and McKee's camerawork is pure genius, especcially suprising coming from a just post-college student.

In a such a film, the conflict is introduced early on, and the rest of the film consists of putting teenagers in harms way. In this film; however, the bulk of the story is spent on watching this young woman's world crumble apart. A concept that's foreshadowed by her doll confined to a box. Many compare this to ""Carrie"" also. Which is sort of true, but May has no super powers. No pranks are conspired against her, and her wrath is directed mostly at very specific people for a specific purpose rather than it exploding all over everybody who was in her presence when she snapped. The comparison falls apart when you take that in consideration. Another reviewer who rated this film poorly said that he suspected that all the high reviews were by people who spent their adolescence going ""Woe is me."" There may be some truth to that, but it's probably also true that the negative reviews are from pretentious narcissists who like to tear people down to hide their own flaws. My point being is that they say that your perception is your reality. The viewer brings some unknown variables to any creative work. So only certain kinds of people will be able comprehend May's reality. Unless you have that certain something inside this will be entirely alien to you. Either you identify with May or the people she kills. In short, this is a movie about the misery that comes from the lack of social integration and the trials of trying to find love in a world that you don't fit in.

Now ""May"" is another example of her talent, with which she created a creey, unsettling, but oddly attractive character in May.
People say May is a funny girl, and she knows it, from her lonely childhood.  And when she was alone, her mother told her: ""If you don't have friend, make one.""  She remembers these words long afterwards.
Now grown-up, May works at animal hospital, where she is good at cutting and stitching.  Her co-worker Polly is a lesbian, and knows how to have fun while May still cannot know how to communicate well with others, except with her doll Susie.
Then she meets someone, a possible boyfriend Adam, who is an aspiring movie director (his maestro being Dario Argento, who must have influenced Lucky McKee too).  May is happy, too happy to know that Adam can enjoy being with her, a strange little girl, only up to a point.  Kissing is a good thing, but biting the lip too hard is another thing.
The film slowly sets up the personalities of characters, and it never relies on the ordinary 'by the number' method of body-counting.  Actually, May is quite unique in trying to portray the deadly heroine in a sympathtic light.
This is a crucial point, because Angela Bettis can be in fact a beautiful, cute girl.  And so is May, only when she chooses to be so.  But we notice she is not a girl you normally meet at party, and her behaviors are far from usual (you don't talk to your doll, do you?)  Some find it pathetic; but others (like Adam, Lucky McKee, and me of course) find it quirky but charming ... up tp a point.
So, don't expect this film to be a so-called ""slasher film.""  There is ""slash""ing scenes, but that is not meant for a big shock.  Watch this as a character study, even though the material itself is a borrowed one (I mean, like ""Carrie"" of which TV series Bettis starred in).
My last, but not least praise should go to Anna Faris, who was in ... er ... ""Scary Movies.""  She is a much better actress than you are led to believe after seeing her fighting with a masked killer or a cat.  She can act, and now you know it.",1090108800,2,2294,4.443914081145585

""May"" is a twisted, confused and ""totally out there"" young woman, mental wise.
It's easy to realize why she ends up doing what she does. The gore is minimal. The plot, okay. If you're going to get this movie, get a good used one. Don't pay full price. Too many ads for other movies at the beginning. At least 6-7.",1089590400,2,586,4.485981308411215
1884654,4,B00009MEC4,"""May"" is the movie American Psycho should have been. Darkly disturbing, urgent, well acted, funny,
and above all retains a sense of humanity. Angela Bettis (Girl Interrupted, Carrie, Bless The
Child) certainly gives Maggie Gyllenhaal a run for her money in terms of best female performance of
the year in a Lions Gate film. What a perfectly 'nailed' creepy yet vulnerable performance. Jeremy
Sisto (""Peter"" from Six Feet Under) and Anna Faris keep this 'sure-to-be cult classic horror film'
a whole level above the norm.
Unlike American Psycho, this doesn't maintain the same consistent undertone of black humor, but
more than makes up for it by creating and nurturing a strong sympathy for ""May,"" our
psychologically damaged, intriguing and beguiling, enigmatically appealing, murdering heroine.
It is difficult for me to classify this movie yet I'm sure that most will refer to it as a horror
film (and I'll probably put it in the horror section of my store). But it was much more of a deeply
profound drama that probes where few movies dare to tread. Make no mistake about it, there is a lot
of explicit gore (strangely no nudity) for which Lions Gate is famous. Again, unlike American
Psycho, this doesn't only insinuate the graphic gore--it shows it. But with taste and dignity, if
that's possible.
The movie begins with May screaming in agonizing pain, holding her eye with blood gushing out (very
haunting), and then cuts to May as a little girl. She was born with a condition called ""lazy eye.""
The psychological trauma began mounting as May was sent to school with a patch over her defective
eye, only to be ridiculed and ostracized. In an attempt to compensate for May's loneliness, her
mother gives her a special handmade doll that was hers when she was a child. It is kept in a wooden
glass case and May is told that it must stay in that case, but it will be her friend and companion
for life.
As May grows up, eye glasses and then contact lenses are able to correct her deformity which
reveals that May is really quite lovely. The question is, will May be able to acclimate into
society so late in the game?
May works as a veterinarian assistant (of course this gives her access to all kinds of scalpels and
surgical tools) and is very good at her job. But there is a quiet lonely aching that is beginning
to manifest in May and she needs some companionship desperately. Unfortunately, she lacks any real
social skills to properly interact in pursuit of her longing.
May says to Adam (Sisto) while on their first date, ""You probably think I'm weird."" He
replies ""Yes, but I like weird."" She is definitely weird. And so is this movie. But in a very very
good way. It keeps you guessing, it keeps you caring, it keeps your eyes glued to the screen, right
down to the last minute of a very very weird ending. Of course, a very good weird ending.",1089417600,3,2855,4.644268774703558

1884656,5,B00009MEC4,"I tried to write my thoughts about this movie but can't keep in under 1600 words and I could only write a max of 1,000, oh well. I'll keep this short.  I first seen Angela Bettis in the TV movie remake of ""Carrie.""  I thought the story was good and I was very impressed with the lead player Angela Bettis.  I short while later I looked her up at the IMDB.  I had read about ""MAY"" and liked the fact ""Ebert"" had given the movie 4 stars, his highest rating.  This was unusual for him to give such high praise to any horror movie or like genre.  I ordered ""MAY"" on DVD having never seen it.  I had high expectations and was not disappointed.  Angela Bettis is not only very talented with her many fantastic subtle facial expressions of her characters (rarely seen in the best actors of all time) but she is just a great actress in general.  Sad that she has not been recognized and given her due credit but then I like it that she is not mainstream, makes her more special.  Angela has a very unique beauty and she is without a doubt one of the most beautiful women acting today.  The movie MAY as it turns out has one thing in common with the ""Carrie"" remake and also the movie ""Sparrow"" (Avail. DVD-private dealers-ebay) with Angela as the main character ""Maria"" from 1993 when Angela was about 17 or 18 years old, she's now 29.  The character in all three of these movies were more or less loners looking for LOVE wherever it may find them.  All three movies end with a very sad ending for her character at that time and of course we don't see the rest of her life.  I have watched ""MAY"" several times and have the soundtrack (bought from a private party-Luckett) and both are excellent.  The Breeders, Kelly Deal 6000 & others as well as the music score by Luckett and her ATE13 music really set the mood.  Angela's singing in one of the versions of FROX was very cool as well.  I very much liked Anna Faris and her and Angela's scenes together are a real treat.  The best line with them was when Polly (Anna Faris) ask May (Bettis) ""Do you like pussy"" and the followup to that scene, it's quite sexy and provocative.  I believe Angela Bettis will get her long overdue credit.  I liked the doll ""Soozy"" in this movie, the whispering noises and the cracking glass sounds all added to the atmosphere.  This is a ""cut em up"" movie done in a stylish black comedy setting.  All the other characters are well portrayed and the movie as a whole was very well done. I encourage anyone who likes unique movies like ""Harold & Maude"" or that fit into dark\black horror comedy will enjoy this movie.  This movie is not for everyone but it was 100% for me.  I will watch for other movies by Lucky McKee and most of all I will watch for movies with Angela Bettis of which I find intoxicating.  Where is the ""Toolbox Murders"" movie with Angela, can't find it anywhere?",1088467200,2,2854,4.329566854990584

People say that you only like it if you're a ""woe is me"" teenager, but I'm not.  I hated the Ring, if anybody has read my reviews of other movies you'd know.  I don't just like artsy fartsy horror movies.  My favorite movie of all time is 'Freddy Vs. Jason', tell me that's artsy fartsy.  The video store I rented this at labeled it a drama, but I saw a preview of it, in what I think was either Cabin Fever or Leprechaun Back 2 Tha Hood, get my point?  It looked like a horror movie.  I decided to give it a go because I'll give any horror movie a chance, and afterwards I was very disturbed.  The film builds up a lot of character for everyone and my favorite was Polly.  I didn't know what would happen next in this film, and when the final half hour rolled around, I was deeply disturbed.  Mutilation, body parts, human dolls, and scoopels, LOL (Inside joke).  This movie tackles areas that I haven't seen near this bad since probably the Surgeon, another classic.  This movie is definitely worth a view and if you like payback, gore, seeing little blind kids bleed and lesbians, then this movie is for you.  Just for the record, this is the only movie I know that actually showed blind keeds crawling on glass.  The movie may be slow, but that just made me care about the characters more, especially Polly.  She's hot and a lesso.  Peace out and enjoy this film, a very good slasher/revenge/demented film, and keep checking for more reviews by me.

I will try not to give away the ending, but it was beyond creepy, I really wasn't expecting exactly what happened, but I do have to say that it was the most perfect ending for this movie, because the director could have kept going but he didn't and that is what made this movie so good, right when you are really creeped out the movie stops, so you are stuck with that creepy feeling, and you just might find youself keeping the lights on that night!",1086566400,,1139,4.253456221198157

The acting in this cult-campy-wanna-be is very good which made me forgive some of the irritating flaws.  For a first attempt, I have to give Lucky McKee credit.  The potential was there but was never realized and instead, unraveled into an unintelligent thrasher.  The premise of the ""different"" girl (superbly portrayed by Angela Bettis - watch for her!)who had no friends  with the flashbacks of weirdo mother and the creepy doll incased in glass were reminscent of Carrie with a twist and a good start to an engaging story.  When we find May in the present day as an akward young adult finding her way, I was there.  I even forgave the idiotic daycare scene (symbolism of broken glass = something the director never fully explained in connection with breakage of doll's case but she meant something really deep I'm sure) They even had me when May first lost it and attempted to make a real version of her doll, a best friend who could never leave her except to decompose maybe.  But they lost me soon after that......the sudden cut to dismemberment was a stretch I wasn't able or willing to make.

Typical romance, girl meets boy, girl likes boy, girl dates boy,  boy dumps girl, girl get revenge on boy, girl finds love in her best friend in the end.
May's best friend isn't really a person, I mean this as it's not one person. I said not for the weak of heart because the movie is about May making the perfect friend, and there's a scene involving glass that could make the stomach turn.

1884706,4,B00009MEC4,"Thanks to an excellent performance by Angela Bettis, ""May"" is a compelling and sad character study. It's also a horror movie in the true sense of the word, because it follows a character who is so damaged and lonely that we feel HER horror.
May had a difficult childhood. Her massive eyepatch and emotionally distant mother kept her friendless, and now, as a young adult, she craves companionship. Unfortunately she's also got a few loose wires and, well, a lack of social skills that's almost matched by her lack of squeamishness.
So when May meets and falls instantly in love with Jeremy Sisto, a local auto worker who has a goth-like attraction to disturbing images and horror movies. A couple of encounters make it pretty clear that her dark side trumps his, though, so he bails, leaving May open to the wiles of her lesbian co-worker. That doesn't quite work out either, so then...
A lot of viewers might complain that the story is predictable. It is - the filmmakers aren't trying to shock you with twists. What happens is inevitable from the first frame. This is why ""May"" is less of a horror movie than a sad, strange nightmare. I don't know that I need to watch ""May"" again, but I'm glad it's out there. Horror movies are often nasty, cynical little chop fests, where people mowed down like video game targets - it's refreshing to see one that knows that true horror stems from sadness that has turned into madness.

It's about an outcast girl trying to make friends, but unable to acclimate herself to society.  Each rejection drives her deeper into a psychotic abyss and is symbolized nicely by the glass case around her best friend, a doll, cracking little by little with each subsequent incident.  I truly enjoyed this film.  May is so relatable that it's disturbing.  This movie is for all of the outcasts who have felt socially powerless,totally alone and just wished for one true friend.  Angela Bettis is so adorable as the title character I wanted to reach into the screen and pull her out.  I felt a twinge of all-too-familiar frustration each time she came so close to finding a friend and then does something that freaks the other person out and sends them running. Even as she prepares her grisly solution her so-beautiful-it's-creepy smile just lights up the screen.  But don't expect a good-time teen flick about awkward social situations.  This movie will make you cringe and squirm more than once.  I don't think I'll ever get the image of a classroom full of blind kids crawling over broken glass and painting the floor with their blood out of my head.  This is an utterly disturbing portrait of an innocent young girl driven to madness by her inability to be accepted for who she is.  The result is so twisted that only someone who sees the world from May's point of view could truly appreciate it.  If you grew up idolizing ""Carrie"", this might be the movie for you.

First off it avoids the annoying trend of scream like movies that are too self aware.  It is just a horror movie.
Second, it created a character that I was interested in.  A girl who was born with a lazy eye, and parents that were supportive in the wrong ways.  It was also intersting to see how she formed a bond with this creepy doll that is her main friend for her whole life.  she isn't mopey and complaining about her isolation, she doesn't even seem to be aware of it.  Until she finds somone that she is interested in, or part of a person, his hands.  She has an offbeat quality to her that you would expect from someone that has lived in her own world her entire life.  Angela Bettis did a great job portraying this.
Third, it wasn't a straight out horror.  It had the qualities of a dark comedy.  The characters around her are strange in personality and their actions.  Her lesbian coworker, the guy she meets that likes strange but not too strange, the foreign vet she works for that only she seems to be able to understand, etc....

1884712,3,B00009MEC4,"The technically strong Lucky McKee may become a great director one day, he might make films that don't reek of cliches and artsy shock but keep the rest of his talents intact. May is a good film that suffers from being obstructively unoriginal and at times even vexing. The cast is small but strong in that mostly their characters were written and directed with very careful hands.

May is a very quirky and awkward girl with a lazy eye that has sort of fallen into her own little world of self-hatred so deep she can't even detect it anymore, so neither does McKee.  May falls deeper as she attempts to build relationships with people that falter in trust and cause May to suffer further. She is given a doll by her Mom when she is young and as we lay in wait for the doll to spring to life this never happens because quite simply May is not that kind of horror film...the doll is her only friend and possibly the darkest side of her warped mind. It is a film about a girl who finds something to actually live for and she goes all out to get it...as disturbing as that may be when you see what it is.

Anna Faris (from Scary Movie) co-stars along with Jeremy Sisto and Nichole Hiltz.  I actually knew Nichole in High School and she was both a smart and sweet girl.  It's nice to see her succeed. May is played by who could be among the most overlooked talents in film today. Her name is Angela Bettis and we will probably see a lot of her in the future. I hope Angela decides it's best to take on roles like this....she literally carried this film and it would've been a far lesser film without her. Anyway, the only thing I know her from is the television remake of Carrie which is ironic because I just mentioned this in my review of Depalma's version of the Stephen King story. The parallels with Carrie and May have come up and I'm here to tell you they are completely unjustified. Bettis' performances in particular are light years apart. Angela Bettis is oddly attractive but the only way to describe here is profoundly scary looking. She was perfect for the role but I suspect the performance was more her work than McKee's.

Personally, I don't think we'll see McKee conquer filmmaking or even put out another good independent film. May borrows from a bevy of independent films and the style of his music being off beat with the film's true guise is nothing new and neither is the unexpected humor in the first hour of the movie. My major gripe with May was the unusual ""Halloween make-over"" that the major character took on in the last twenty minutes of the film. All of sudden she goes from being this insecure and frail little weirdo to being this confident and sexy killer. I didn't miss anything here I can assure you.  I get why it happened but I did not find the film compelling in any way beyond this point. It simply made the horror of the last half seem so unbelievable. Sure, this flaw can be explained away but it just didn't sit right with me. She seems to drift right back to herself by the films end too as though some other character took her over...I don't doubt that was in fact the film's intention but the lead character was already fully capable of these horrific actions in the first place. Anyway, May's flaws aside, what happens here could rarely be pulled off by any other movie that takes itself seriously and for that I recommend it. If you like horror this little movie is totally worth your time as it's scare tactics are unexpected and deeper than most and its conclusion is unforgettable.",1077840000,5,3528,4.426810477657935
1884713,4,B00009MEC4,"Dispensing with issues of originality - the world through the eyes of a serial killer has been done numerous times, and the ""assembly"" aspect was exploited in 'Pieces' and other flicks - 'May' is probably the most painful and subtley creepy film I've seen in a long time.  Think of 'Pieces' meeting 'Willard' and 'Carrie,' and you can get a pretty good idea of the story.
But that tells you nothing about the film itself, which is pretty spectacular.  'May' re-affirms my personal notion that the best horror movies are done independently, or at least with a small budget.  Without money to pay for huge amounts of effects or stupid sound tricks (the American version of 'The Ring' was particularly abusive in that department), small-budget horror movies tend to focus on plot, mood, and the essential elements of scary.  Too often, major studio flicks give you gore, loud sudden noises, blood, a couple of ddark corners to peek around, a cop chase, and some idiots who you actually want to buy the farm (screaming, bleeding, and dismembered all the way).  What you get with 'May' is a story that's sometimes painful to watch because it's so simple and touches on little aspects of wanting to wanted in that everyone can sympathize with.
Angela Bettis does an excellent job portraying the shy, pretty, and agonizingly akward May, a social outcast from childhood due to an eye condition.  Our protagonist makes halting attempts to connect with other people but is often thwarted by her insecurities and social ineptness.  It doesn't help that the people she interacts with most are a blustery foreign vet and a loopy lesbian tramp (boss and coworker, respectively).  Her best friend is a doll her mother made, part of a huge collection that she uses to stimulate real relationships.  Her behavior would be endearing on a seven-year-old, but May is obviously in her twenties, so it's just creepy.
When she does make a connection, she wrenches the works by simply not knowing where the line that divides attractive eccentricity and plain weirdness ends.  It's painful to watch her try so hard and creepy to see what she simply accepts as acceptable.  You know she just doesn't know any better, so you sympathize - but you can't help but feel grossed out.  Because of your sympathy with her, you are drawn into the rhythm of her spiraling breakdown.  You can almost hear the ""snap!"" that takes her over the edge and down the dark bloody path that she walks for the last twenty minutes of the film.
You cringe, you blanch, and you stare in horrified bemusement - but you just can't hate this girl, even though you know she's not right in the head.  Because she just wants to be seen, to be loved - and we all know what that's like.  Pick this up if you're tired of the regular Hollywood pandering and take a little ride into a strange little world.  May's waiting for you, and she's already deciding what parts of you she likes.",1077753600,3,2923,4.713163064833006
1884714,5,B00009MEC4,"""May"" is the creepiest film I've seen in a long time. Mostly, it's a character study of a strange, isolated girl who works at a veterinary clinic, makes her own pieced-together clothes and talks to a doll. At first she seems to be nothing more than a shy, awkward, wounded soul desperately looking for love and approval. You feel sorry for her, you relate to her, you root for her. About halfway through the film, however, you start to realize that May isn't just strange, she's really nuts. Her character is slowly revealed to be a real psychotic with a taste for blood, and when it happens it's completely unsettling. We haven't seen a character like this since ""Carrie""; a seemingly benevolent misfit pushed over the edge with horrifying consequences.
The performances in this film are all really quite good, which is a nice surprise, and rare for a horror film. Angela Bettis' performance as May is a genuine tour de force; she convincingly shows May both at her most awkward and grasping and at her most sinister and bloodthirsty. Jeremy Sisto is perfect as the pretentious slacker who May falls for, and Anna Farris (of ""Scary Movie"" fame) is hysterically deranged as the (...)coworker obsessed with May.
I'd highly recommend this film for anyone who isn't too squeamish or easily disturbed.",1077235200,2,1297,4.846846846846847

1884758,4,B00009MEC4,"While most were out watching the crop of predictable horror movies (rewritten movie scripts from the 70's and 80's), this gem of a movie quietly slipped under the radar.  Unfortunate, as it is significantly better than the brain-dead slasher films currently in release. May is a horror movie with a human face.  Imagine a deep examination of Stephen King's ""Carrie,"" and you'll have an idea where this movie is going.
May has trouble making friends.  Having spent the majority of her childhood ridiculed and tormented, the seeds are sown for May to be quiet, insecure, and alone.  Her overprotective mother feels giving her daughter a doll would help, yet she keeps it in a glass case with strict orders not to open.  Enclosed and inaccessable, it serves only to deepen her inability to communicate with others.
As an adult, this painfully shy waif (Angela Bettis), finds herself working at a veterinary clinic and attracted to an auto mechanic (Jeremy Sisto). Her attempts to get him to notice her existence are both painful and amusing.  You'll find yourself cheering her on in her success.  Upon deeper examination, we find Adam to be kind of a slacker, with a taste for art-house sleaze and, as he puts it, ""weird girls.""  Between him, her parents, and the other characters she meets in her life, including her inept boss, and a trashy co-worker, you start to wonder if she really is that odd in comparison.
Directed by Lucky McKee, May is a film that succeeds in spite of its obvious low budget.  Filled with symbolism and allegory, the story works; with one glaring exception.  When things start going wrong and violence ensues, the attempts at realistic violence end up looking more campy then serious.  There are some disturbing scenes that are pulled off incredibly well in spite of the budget, and the film ends on a bloody note with slight thoughtful contemplation.  By this time, though, any sense of morality has fallen by the wayside and you'll either be emotionally touched or hysterical with laughter.
Still, May is not without its sense of irony and Angela Bettis plays a powerful, fragile character in a believable descent into madness.  Perhaps it's good this movie wasn't so successful.  Shy girls would have even more trouble getting dates.",1075593600,2,2261,4.900262467191601

In the process she finds ""Mr. Right"", however, she lacks social skills to remain in the relationship and this leads her into a bizarre and twisted journey.  May is a two-sided story that is both full of compassion, but also as dark as the most hurtful resentment.  It provides an opportunity to see the ambiguity within a human being, which leads to a pretty good cinematic experience.",1074729600,3,703,4.682926829268292

1884764,4,B00009MEC4,"This is a good eerie thriller that has ""indie"" written all over it: from the way it's filmed and the actors cast to the soundtrack used and the overall atmosphere.
  May, a ""weirdo""-extraordinaire, is a young woman struggling to somehow fit in this world. Having grown up with a doll as her only friend she finds it extremely difficult to interact with live human beings.
  Her only apparent existence in the ""outside"" world is her job, and that happens to be a workplace where the weirdness doesn't smoothen over as it is an animal hospital with a doctor that speaks his very own version of english and a lesbian co-worker that sees May as her next conquest.
  But May has other plans as she becomes fixated on Adam, a cool slacker who seems to fit May's ambitions for a first boyfriend. Adam, who as he confesses ""likes weird"" does fall for May (after May puts up a whole plan to get him) only to discover that May is a little bit...too weird even for his tastes (Adam is a guy who's at the time finishing a small film of his that tends on the quite gory side). Adam splits and things begin to unravel inside May's volcanic world.
  Predictably, May doesnt take to this lightly and after a brief stint wth her lesbian colleague she finds herself ""betrayed"" again as she realises that her new hope for a love source turns out to be only caring for the sex part which she practices with several partners.
  It's time then for that inner volcano of May's to explode. If people are set on betraying her and if she can't find someone who will love her and be her friend then she will create one. May decides to play God complete with wrath and imagination.
  The end of the film which i won't reveal to its fullest detail is quite brutal, gory and eerie. And the whole movie alltogether is an underground gem that somehow got lost in the latest releases but which has to be discovered for any fan of the horror or thriller genre.
  This film has a number of things going for it that make it special: firstly and most notably the incredible performance of Angella Bettis. She's a glove-fit for May's role and I'd really have to think to find a performance that celebrates eerieness, weirdness and fear-emission the way Bettis manages. This is a role that has to be seen. But she's not alone in her efforts nor does she carry the movie solely on her shoulders. Adam, played by Jeremy Sisto is an equally great outing. Sisto seems totally natural in his role as the womanizer slacker, and he is analogously interesting as a character as May. Same goes though for May's lesbian colleague who is also terrifically convincing.
  This movie rolls the high rails of ""classic"" for almost the distance but the scriptwriter loses his focus in the last minutes of the film as this whole tragedy gets resolved in a butchery way. This is the only reason i deem this a 4-star film: the plotholes towards the end.
  But other than that this is strong stuff. Everybody involved here does an arguably great job in putting together an eerie-atmosphere masterpiece. Pity they didn't stay cautious with the details in the end but this takes very little away from the film.
  Very reccommendable for horror-thriller afficionados, not so for the rest whom -i suspect- might find this film disturbing at the very least. But speaking of that, it's the ""disturbingness"" that will have a hold of you throughout and that's an added plus.",1073865600,2,3406,4.5707236842105265

Let me put it this way, this is a long movie, too long for the anti-climax. When she makes her human doll out of human parts, cool. When she digs out her own eye for the doll, cool. When the 'doll' comes to life and moves his arm? Aw c'mon now. It would have been better if she had just died next to this lifeless, stinky thing.

1884796,5,B00009MEC4,"Thank God for DVD!
Without which many good little films who never get the chance for a wide theatre distrubution would have had a premature and unfortunate demise. The digital technology and the huge boom in DVD sales pushed the studios to look deep into their treasure vaults and release some unknown gems,and May is such a movie.
Lucky McKee's film is original and weird, (and more often than not, there is a thin line between originality and weirdness that is wonderful to watch)and it has this 70s cult-ish feel to it. May can be thinly labelled as a horror film, but it is more of a psychological study into the mind of a 'social outcast', a lonely soul whose only real friend and confidant in life is a creepy looking doll.
In a way May did remind slightly of George A Romero's Martin, apart from both characters' particular taste for blood, they are eccentric loners who can not communicate properly with the 'normal' world outside the one they have carefully cocooned themselves in, and despite the horrors they inflict on others, the viewer can not but feel total sympathy with them, because deep down they are quite vulnerable, naive and exploited people.
May,over protected as a child by her parents and shunned by other kids because of a lazy eye,for which she had to wear a 'pirate's' patch, grows into a very timid and inexperienced woman with a fascination for certain body parts, the hands of the excellent Six Feet Under's Jeremy Sisto, and the neck of her pet clinic lesbian colleague, the incredibly sexy Anna Faris. But what May really longs for above anything else is the intimacy and closeness with anyone who would accept her (she keeps warning her potential suitors that she is weird)..and because of her lack of experience, her fragile emotional state and her twisted outlook at the world, inbred after years of isolation, she does not take  disappointments and rejections too well, with murderous consequences.
Yet the care she displays for the blind children shows another aspect of May's personality, one that is so detached from the beast within her, and it is a confirmation that it is indeed  care and love that she craves most, which she tries to give in return to the ones she sees are as vulnerable and in need for affection as herself.
The ending is quite powerful, and attempting to 'construct' the perfect companion from the different parts of the people she liked, only lead to a greater disappointment and pain. Quite sad and at the same time heartfelt message that many people can identify with, no perfect person exists!
Angela Bettis (with films like Girl Interrupted, Bless That Child and Perfume to her name)gives the performance of her career, one that should really be acknowledged by awards! She plays May to perfection, and is responsible for injecting the sympathy that her character deserves.
Anna Faris, as I mentioned is very sexy, and more so since she plays a vampish lesbian, and has a surprisingly erotically charged scene with Bettis.
May is a litle gem of a movie that I strongly advise you to watch, for it will take you back to a time when movies did not need to have dozens of  accountants and lawyers and two mega stars that will eat half the budget for it to hit the right spot with the viewers.",1072137600,3,3258,4.72231985940246

1)Bad acting
2)Thin plot lines
3)No character development
4)A freak killer taking out teenagers one by one
5)All the teens killed are bad and thus somehow deserve it
6)Every other cliche thats been used time and time again.
May provides the Dario Argento style of horror we haven't seen here in the states for a long time. While Director Lucky McKee may not ever get to display the graphic violence seen in Mr. Argento's films he has successfuly displayed the tension and immense shock they contain but also more importantly he shows the art behind the blood. May has great acting, especially by the lead actress. The scariest thing is to make you LIKE a character before they are brutally killed. The innocent are truly the most scary of all victims. Making you FEEL for someone so when they are killed you're like ""oh man they didn't deserve that.""
Now this is what horror is. This movie get's pretty intense as it builds our strange yet loveable heroine/villian  to her inevitable conclusion about making friends.
It'll freak you out but leave you feeling strangely attached to all the preceding events. I look forward to THE VILLAGE the next project by this great up and coming horror director. Note all the little Dario Argento things scattered through out the film. (If this is your first time hearing the name Dario Argento, I warn you his movie (OPERA) freaked me out and made me fear his name under movie titles lol. So before you seek him out make sure you can stomach intense blood and gore.) But as for Mr. McKee he has set a foundation that will give his movies great credibility.

It's not a convential genre piece meant to scare you or gross you out, it's meant to immerse you in a psychologically twisted world as we spiral down further and further with the title character.  When the blood spills the slow and wonderfully paced build up to it makes it all the more effective.  It's funny and disturbing and clever as all hell.

Angela Bettis plays the part of May so over the top that I have to believe the comedic effect was intentional.  Of course, as our heroine ""descends into madness"", aided by a possessed doll, hilarity ensues.  The comic book violence combined with the forays into lesbian sex and a whinny soundtrack, make it hard to watch this flick without laughing out loud.  Personally, I put this movie in the same category as Return of the Living Dead (without as great a soundtrack) because even though it's packaged as horror movie, it presents itself so ridiculously that it's hard to take it seriously.  And, I think, this is what was intended.  Sure the premise is a little tired (the whole possessed doll maid me do it thing), but if you like you're comedy a little off center and need a good laugh, I'd give May a try.

May is so over-the-top with her dysfunction that she seems to have all the social skills of a 3-year-old. It made no sense for this fella to even get as far with her as he did.
  The nympho/lesbian co-worker provides a semi-humorous thread, but again, it is so over-the-top that it is just campy. I won't ""spoil"" the ending, but I will just say that it is ludicrous. The problem with over the top, for me, is that it then takes the movie out of the realm of ""reality"" and thus is not scary or creepy because I am no longer taking it seriously.

May grows up being different, wearing an eye patch because of a lazy eye.  Mommy and Daddy give her a doll to be her friend, a doll that is one of those 'look but don't touch' dolls.  If you can't meet friends, then make one.
May matures, and we pick up with her as she is working for a Veterinarian as his assistant.  She sees a young man who inspires her to get contact lenses and become a bit more flirtatious, after falling in love with his hands.  His beautiful hands.
May can always see the best in people, though they don't seem to see her very well at all.  Betrayed by the two people who claimed to like her and her odd ways, May finally decides Mommy was right.  It's time to make a new friend.  Someone who will understand her.
Not a blatant blood-splatter film but nonetheless a titillating journey through the sicker side of need.

My DVD player has a mind of its own, and will, at times, want to play a movie before you're damned good and ready. ; as was the case here. Another warning, do not, as said above, and have, as I did, a 2 year old in the room. Now, I'm not saying that he's traumatized for life. However, the opening of the movie should give you a bit of taste of things to come. Fortunately, I waited until well after my son's bedtime to watch the film.
At times movies arrive in the mail via NetFlix and I forget why I rented them. As was the case with MAY. Nevertheless, after watching the movie I was not sorry for it.
I consider the inspiration to seek out and watch the film was probably a review I read and don't remember reading in Fangoria magazine.
Other movies have attempted to show a person descend into madness. It starts when you're very young and you digress. May was a child with a lazy eye that was coddled by her mother and treated as an outsider, so when we see her years later, she's a beautiful young woman, with a stigmatism that will make one think she's looking at you and someone across the road, much like a chameleon. Yet, May's had a friend her entire life to be with her on her downward spiral. The ""creepy"" doll her mother gave to her, ""but not to touch,"" that dwells within a glass box and sees the world through unblinking eyes and while May pines over the doll, she's continuously in search for someone to share a life with. That life she finds in obsession in ""parts."" The song that comes to mind is by Hole, `Doll Parts,' and once you begin seeing the unraveling of the film, you'll understand. A seamstress and veterinary assistant, May is truly one of a kind and is quirky and charming in a ""Carrie"" kind of way. Moreover, by unraveling, it doesn't just mean the film, but the person we're living through.
Lucky McKee is the director and writer of the film and if there's one thing to say about writer/directors, they know what they want you to see when it comes to writing the piece. As a writer myself, I know what goes through my head in setting up scenes. When it comes to writer/directors, they capture the intensity of the scene exactly as it was put to paper. Although the directing was satisfactory, what brought the film out was the acting by Angela Bettis, as May and the character actors that surrounded her. Some faces may seem familiar to people that recognize actors for their body of work and not the pay they bring home.
I had no idea the movie would turn in the direction it did and at the end, you completely understand her pain from the beginning. Troubled? Yes. Dangerous? Absolutely! I think I would find `May' an irresistible girl if I met her on the street or laundry mat as the case may be, and fall in love. However, it would be foolish, costly, and still, I'd understand as I was wheeled down the sidewalk, looking at the dark inside of an ice chest that this girl was special.
For those who watch a movie for stories this is for you. Those of you that have a ten-minute attentions span-what was I saying? This is not for you! Dark, sometimes touching and funny, those of us that truly get inspiration when it comes to good films, this is for you.

Needless to say, having not heard of it before, I made the decision to rent a copy from my local video store before making any determinations on it.  I'm glad I did.
  The movie centers around May, a loner with a lazy eye.  Thinking back on it, this may be a reference to Edgar Allen Poe, but who knows.  Growing up outside the mainstream, May develops into an introvert who works at an animal hospital and sews.  Oh yeah, she also happens to keep a doll as her ""best friend"".
  Shy as she is, May still manages to have a couple people populate her social life.  Adam is a man admired from afar, then caressed in a coffee shop, and who opens May up to the world of interpersonal relationships.  Polly is a co-worker who also happens to enjoy masochism and other women.  Both of them propel May to some life changing revelations and, after May has stitched things together in the end, lead her to sob out ""All I want...is see me.""

I can't remember how many times I heard Ghost World referred to as the rebirth of the hip, smart teen comedy. Then I saw it, and was left utterly cold. The only difference between Ghost World and Clueless was that Alicia Silverstone has gotten too old to play Thora Birch's role.
So then I saw May, and realized that everyone had just seen both movies on the same day and misattributed all the accolades. May is intelligent, funny, and sharp as a scupel-err, scalpel.
Angela Bettis (Girl, Interrupted), who does the most remarkable impression of those Edward Gorey-drawn Victorian little pre-goth girls, stars in the title role. May is a lifelong misfit who fits in nowhere. After (we presume) the death of her parents, May is left on her own in the house in which she grew up, with a job at the local animal hospital, no life, and a best friend who's a really disturbing porcelain doll who May has never taken out of the case constructed for her long before May's birth. Then, through the magic of cinema, we are transported to the realm of Britcom `Allo! `Allo!-this somewhat plain, reclusive girl catches the eye of two Hollywood-gorgeous types, Adan (Jeremy ""Julius Caesar"" Sisto-who really does appear as Caesar, albeit in a Halloween costume, in this film) and Polly (Anna Faris of the Scary Movie franchise). May's naivete causes her to make a few bad choices in the courtship game, a few bad choices are made by others, and the stage is set for the film to become the tragedy (though always leavened with humor) it threatens to become from the first moments.
Despite being what it is (and by now it's not a spoiler to say it's a modern retelling of Frankenstein, since everyone else has mentioned it by now), the movie has some of the funniest one-liners to see the big screen in the past two or three decades. Look especially for a cameo for Nightstalker title character Bret Roberts, whose mini-breakdown may be the funniest big-screen scene since the last spoken line in Ocean's Eleven back in 1960.
Twisted, hysterical, and not for the weak of stomach. ****",1067990400,2,2093,4.705722070844686
1884852,5,B00009MEC4,"In an era when the horror film has degenerated into unimaginative and redundant slasher flicks and PG-13 teenybopper specials, it is satisfying to find a creepy little gem like May. Angela Bettis is wonderful in the title role, creating the greatest female victim/villain in a horror film since Sissy Spacek in Carrie. Rather than playing May as a caricature, Bettis brings her to life as a lonely, tormented individual suffering from mental illness. We watch her personality deteriorate as the film progresses. May is quite attractive in a delicate waiflike way. She is also odd and creepy. It is easy to see how the Jeremy Sisto character would be simultaneously attracted to and repulsed by her. She is like an exotic flower which turns out to be poisonous. The pace of the film is measured but never boring. May's outbursts of violence are brief, but nasty (she is a veterinary surgical assistant and favors sharp implements such as scalpels and scissors). The quirky, Alt-Rock soundtrack fits the story perfectly, and the film has a black humor about it, from start to finish. Lucky McKee does a terrific job of directing. He is like a breath of fresh air to the rather stagnant horror genre. For another entertaining McKee/Bettis collaboration, see ""Sick Girl"" from the Masters of Horror series. Enjoy.",1067904000,,1308,4.9771689497716896
1884853,4,B00009MEC4,"It's a blatant pleasure to be absorbed into  ""one of those movies."" Unfounded by a  trace of hype nor near the Hollywood treatment, it's a wonder to see such movies come out nicely.  Especially when they pull the audiences into a disquieting twist. That's what the disturbingly droll movie, MAY, has done for me.  In its first minutes, I instinctively knew this was going to be one of those rare films that will either be embraced in its artistry or regarded as total filth. Criticism of filth tossed aside, I have to declare that this has to be one of the more engrossing movies I've seen all this year.
As plastic body parts fell on the screen and May's childhood developed on screen, there were irrefutable clues that carefully hinted a later revelation for a powerful ending.  Such scenes add up like the mutilation of a dog's leg, then a shot of one lusty pair of legs, May's sick infatuation to be stabbed with a toy knife, etc.  All of it meshes together, leading to a manifestation of something surprising, and I graciously enjoyed every minute of it.
The plot takes on the teenage girl, May, who is cursed with one lazy eye.  Because of it, she doesn't have much friends to begin with.  On one of her early birthday's, her mother gives her a doll she made from scratch, and tells her ""if you don`t have a friend, make one.""  A line that will turn into morbid irony.  Growing up, May is still a rather reticent girl working as a veteran's assistant.  She has an off-putting fascination with flesh, pain, death, and other abnormalities that the general masses would deem as bizarre or immoral.  Once May receives contact lenses which disguise her lazy eye as a normal one, she is ready to take on the challenge of her first date.  Despite her inability and inexperience of having any friends at all.
Later in the movie, we learn she has an obsession towards human body parts.  Each person who plays some sort of role in her life, she has a type of infatuation with a specific body part, such as a flawless neck or masculine hands.  Though, May's strange persona finally catches up to her, in which the regular outdoor world will not accept as normal.  She feels the iron fist of rejection from her boyfriend, her friend, and an unfortunate punk rocker.  Thus, she is back in her lonesome life and whom does she turn to?  Her doll Susie.  Susie lost too.  May snaps, she has had enough and takes the next gruesome step in the art of making friends.  Those hands, that neck, those perfect legs, such body parts would make the perfect ""friend.""
MAY isn't a traditional horror film that will throw you off your seat or summon the jitters, but a horror flick in a sense of how deep May will go to find self-contentment.  Even if it means killing those she know or immortalizing her dead cat in the freezer.  All the appalling scenes create its own grotesque nature, and underneath it all the film does manage to keep the audience laughing.  I couldn't help but chuckle when May sets her face in her crush's hand while he was crashed out on a table.  Or when she took an anxious bite into her tuna sandwich after telling her boyfriend a gruesome story of a dog's guts sprawling on the concrete.  But as the funny scenes lessen, inward came the disturbing ones like May sleeping with her dead cat, and spraying it with air freshener.
The director's method of creating May was splendid.  I believe he has made use of his time and delved into her otherwise pitiful existence.  There are some scenes I thought were a bit too wacky in its own self, but I could relate to where she took up smoking, because when you are underage and in the military, its hard to get a buzz, so the next legal substance could be cigarettes?  Nah.  Anyway, May's relationship with her doll, who is encased in a glass and wood, is told precisely as it should be.  She abandons Susie after she is befriended by real people.  May begins to dislike Susie and smashes a fist on glass casing.  Consequently, the glass makes crunching noises which haunt May.  It is by these noises, the audience knows that she has lost the balance of reality.
I can see why May is regarded as disturbing, like when the blind children are crawling on the floor with shards of glass scattered all over.  I cringed and winced as the eerie music played and the children moaned.  The movie deserves all of its rights.  Especially the mightily executed ending.  I didn't see that coming when she placed her final piece to her ""creation,""  and screamed ""LOOK AT ME!""  The morale of movie is right on and is an absolute piece of Drama.  Just watching May limp over her ""creation,"" crying helplessly, unraveled how troubled our world is.  And if a movie forces you to relate, wince, and reflect, then it truly is a movie worth seeing.",1067817600,4,4778,4.520979020979021

1884874,2,B00009MEC4,"I'm constantly searching for little seen, original flicks that have something more to offer than typical Hollywood fare.  Being a fan of horror movies (and the fact that it is a necessity to watch one every night in Oct.) I was intrigued by MAY which showed up on a pay-per-view.  It started off well enough, establishing wall flower weirdo May as an off-kilter character that isn't yet psychotic enough to not pity.  The story eventually slides into the blood and shock zone as May's sanity unravels and her craziness comes to the surface.  The end of the film is predictable and silly while trying to be disturbing and cool.  Everyone involved is doing a decent job for an independant flick, however the plot in the second half mars what could've been a creepy character study.  ONE HOUR PHOTO handled the reclusive, misunderstood creep angle with a tad more originality and compassion for it's central player.  MAY on the other hand is irredeemable.",1065225600,3,952,4.839506172839506
1884875,2,B00009MEC4,"""May"" is that most congenial of horror movies to the theater-goer who hates horror movies: a kind of hip, artsy ""horror"" flick that one can go see, feel superior and reinforced in one's pseudo-intellectualism, and come out not feeling like one has been rolling in the horror movie mud for two hours.
The movie is obviously infatuated with itself, and if the film were a fraction as enjoyable and clever as director Lucky McKee evidently feels it is it would be an entertaining ride. As it is, while ""May"" has some interesting concepts, there's certainly nothing here to get excited about.
With that said, one can't help but pity poor May Cannady (played effectively by the lovely Angela Bettis), the film's eponymous heroine, left friendless after her parents die because, evidently, her lazy eye (which required her to wear an eyepatch in grade school) made it impossible for her to make friends. Not to worry, though: the shy, awkward, but oddly fetching veterinary assistant has a creepy little doll she keeps in a glass box (the doll is for viewing only---look, but don't touch!).
But like most awkward teenagers, May wants a little more in the way of flesh-and-blood companionship. Alas, things don't go so well: her filmmaker boyfriend (played by an unusually poised and effective Jeremy Sisto) likes weird, but May is just a little *too* weird---after he shows her his student horror film (which brings an entirely new meaning to the phrase ""I love you so much I could eat you up""), May wants to show her appreciation by making out in the true spirit of Sisto's cannibalistic little horror film.
Her perky co-worker Polly (played by the always nimble Anna Faris) seduces her, but alas: fickle creature that she is, Polly quickly finds another conquest in the leggy and hard-as-nails Ambrosia.
And when, in a moment of pique, May accidentally kills the cat Polly gave her---well, things go to pieces in a hurry, since everyone knows that when you're a shy, weird, awkward teen who lives alone and you've accidentally brained Kitty, you're just one bad hair day from going the rest of the way and slaughtering a homeless punker with a pair of scissors.
But even that's OK: May's mommy told her ""if you don't have a friend, make one"", and May has always been drawn to 'pieces': she loves her boyfriend's hands, loves Polly's neck, loves Ambrosia's legs, and loves kitty's fur. And she's a great seamstress, so you can probably see where this is going.
No offense to Lucky McKee: for a first-time outing, this movie shows a lot of potential. Sisto's student film gave me a good laugh, and the cinematography reminds me of Tim Burton's early work. All in all, this is a well crafted movie. The acting is universally competent, as well, so no complaints there.
But that said, craft and execution isn't everything. Horror films require a certain suspension of disbelief, but ""May"" doesn't even try to make its character's actions understandable. I didn't buy May's transformation from an eccentric, needy veterinary assistant to a serial killer specializing in vivisection: what, one bad date pushed her over the edge? Another of the film's pivotal scenes involves broken glass and a class full of blind children, and manages to serve up the biggest insult to handicapped kids I have seen in my life, to say nothing of the fact that it's an idiotic scene that makes no sense. Did I miss something in my 30+ years on the planet, or did blind children suddenly take a liking to rubbing fragments of glass in their eyes and skin?
But in the final analysis, ""May"" is simply not much fun. It's a self-absorbed and completely self-confident film that expects you to like it as much as McKee does, though unfortunately it's roughly half as clever as he thinks it is. It's painful enough to watch the first time, and I certainly can't imagine the kind of person who would want to own this thing.
If dead cats, vivisection, boring teen-angst, and instant lunatics are your thing, you might get something out of ""May"". If you're looking for a truly decent horror movie, then avoid this one like the plague.",1063584000,32,4096,4.803116147308782
1884876,1,B00009MEC4,"Okay, so my friend and I rented this movie tonight.  I don't even know how to describe it.  Some parts literally left me staring at the screen with my mouth open, either out of disgust or amazement that someone could actually think up something like that.  Some parts made me squirm.  These are not good qualities of the movie by the way.  I do want to say though, that Angela Bettis did an EXTREME acting job.  Her character was unbelievable.  But, I'm glad I didn't spend $9 on that movie in the theater, because most of the time, I was laughing because it was INSANE.  It's kinda scary the ideas that people come up with....whatever floats your boat I guess.",1062115200,2,661,4.45
1884877,5,B00009MEC4,"I suspect the movie ""May"" snuck in under most people's radar. In fact, I am not sure many people know about this wonderful little picture even now. I only came across it through pure chance, read a short review about it, and decided to give it a shot. I am certainly glad I watched ""May"" because this film about a meek young woman with a desperate need to belong really delivers on multiple levels. This movie underscores the fact that there are plenty of films floating around out there that deserve more attention than they receive from general audiences. I cannot say whether ""May"" got a theatrical release or not, but the film is available on DVD and is well worth picking up if you are a horror film aficionado or if you just enjoy great acting performances.
Angela Bettis plays May, a young woman with several serious mental issues. Her problems started as a child, when doctors diagnosed May with an eye problem that required an eye patch. Of course, the kids at school thought May was a pirate or flat out ignored her. The parents did not provide much in the way of assistance either, as May's mother falls into the ""overprotective and abrasive"" category. When May celebrates a birthday, her mother presents her with a fancy doll enclosed in a glass case. Her daughter wishes to take the doll out and play with it, but Mom goes off the deep end and lectures May on the necessity of never taking the doll out of its box. This doll plays a significant role in May's later life, as the young woman believes the toy is her only real friend in the world. In short, May's childhood provides the foundations for a life loaded with insecurity, boredom, and a complete inability to connect with other people on an emotional level. May is one troubled person.
Most of the film deals with May's awkward attempts to function in real life. Her job as a medical assistant at a veterinary clinic allows some contact with a verbally challenged doctor and a goofy lesbian co-worker who keeps her eye firmly fixed on May, but May longs for a boyfriend to fulfill her ambitions. This dream of love takes on a new dimension when she notices Adam (Jeremy Sisto), a guy who spends his time slouching around in a cafe, smoking cigarettes, and attending Dario Argento film festivals. Obviously, Adam doesn't even notice the existence of May until the she makes several painfully inept maneuvers designed to grab his attention. May succeeds to some extent, but ultimately her fragile mental state causes problems that threaten to send May into a downward spiral of bloody violence committed against anyone who ever wronged her.
""May"" is Angela Bettis's film, body and soul. Since she fills the shoes of the title character, Bettis's performance should command most of the audience's attention. Thank goodness she possesses the necessary chops to carry out the role to perfection. I cannot remember the last time I saw an actor/actress convey the range of emotions that Bettis adroitly delivers in this film. The viewer knows May has serious problems, but at the same time the character is oddly charming. The embarrassing interactions with Adam, the painful encounters with her trampy co-worker, and her attempts to reach out and help a class of blind children all reveal a young woman desperate to make friends and live like a normal person. Even more disconcerting for the viewer is the realization that May is, well, cute. Just when you notice May doing something bizarre, you cannot help recognizing that this girl is alluring no matter how quirky she is. That's the mark of a fine actress when a performance conveys two opposing emotions at the same time, and Bettis does it with ease. Who is this amazing young lady? The only other role of note I found for her was in the Winona Ryder vehicle ""Girl, Interrupted."" Keep an eye on Bettis because if ""May"" is any indication, this gal ought to go far in the future. You seldom see a performance of this caliber in a low budget horror film.
My only complaint with ""May"" concerns a lack of sufficient background about the title character. We do get a few scenes about May's childhood, but I think a bit more development in that area would have helped flesh out the story. It's a niggling complaint because the picture works splendidly overall. Kudos to Lion's Gate for releasing this on DVD with a great film transfer and two commentaries with the director and actors. It's a darn shame more people don't know anything about this movie. The time has come to spread the word about ""May"": this is an immensely entertaining horror film with a great actress doing great work in the lead role.",1062115200,206,4621,4.706172839506173
1884878,5,B00009MEC4,"That takes on a different meaning once one sees this one-of-a-kind movie.  May tries to make friends, really tries, but there are many things going against her.  She is not exactly a looker, being thin, a bit awkward, shy, the kind of girl no one would notice or that girls would tease in high school.  In fact an eyepatch she had to wear as a child did not make her friends, as they didn't consider her normal.
There are two quirky characters at the animal hospital where May works.  One is the goofily flaky Polly, a lesbian who is turned on by new things, including being cut with a scalpel after seeing May do it to her own finger.  Another is an older Latin doctor whose incomprehensible messages May understands--""fecoxam on miskatay"" turns out to be ""fecal exam on Miss Kitty.""
Key to May's life is a doll in a glass case her mother gave her when she was a girl.  The pale white Suzy has blown-out auburn hair, staring blue eyes, and tiny red lips, and a brownish-red dress.  This is the one constant friend she has.  However, May's frustrations at being shut out and hurt is reflected when the glass of Suzy's case cracks.  In short, it reflects May's secure little world.  As a result, her house is full of dolls and doll parts, mirroring some 90's alternative/goth band album covers, q.v. Curve's Doppelganger.
She meets and falls for Adam, a Jim Morrison-lookalike whom she sees one day.  He says his tastes are weird, and for May, that's okay--she likes weird.  However, after seeing one of his film school movies, she tries to emulate a scene from his movie, which freaks him out and puts him off, much to May's surprise.  She tries to get back with him, but she is brushed off many times.
Cruel disappointment after cruel disappointment follows, and the ultimate vengeance May takes is horrible, but given what she's gone through, I would've asked her, ""Ooh!  Can I help?""  As someone who's experienced cruelty when I was at school, I've wanted to get revenge in that same way, but more brutally.
The attempt to connect with someone but getting the wrong message or that lack of communication that results in disappointment plays a part as well.  And trying to fit in and find friends if one isn't popular or good-looking?  Trying to explain why one is different?  Looking for a certain someone to call one's true love?  That too.
Comparisons between May and Carrie (Stephen King)?  Both Carrie White and May Canady don't fit in with the normal world, but May had supportive parents and no supernatural powers, although ironically, Angela Bettis (May) played Carrie in the recent TV movie version.  May though is prettier than Dawn in Welcome To The Dollhouse, an ironic title given May's penchant for dolls.
Angela Bettis does wonders as May.  She has a fragile and quirky sort of prettiness which sparkles when she's happy.  When she has been disappointed or cries in frustration, I felt her pain.  I was also surprised to see Anna Faris as Polly, totally different from the squeaky virginal Cindy in the two (soon to be three) Scary Movies.  And Nichole Hiltz as Ambrosia is a Jessica Simpson-lookalike who becomes Polly's squeeze, definitely a cheerleader type who is scornful of May.
I was considered a freak by others at school, and with that sense of alienation and anger, I really identify with May.  Why is it that normality is so valued among children, who exclude others because of some handicap, and even among adults, who shun misfits and outsiders because of some difference, I'll never know, but it should be outlawed.
In the end, maybe the way May makes a friend, albeit in more conventional ways, may be the only way to make a genuine friend.",1062115200,7,3673,4.682242990654205

1884882,3,B00009MEC4,"""May"" is ""Carrie"" minus the telekinesis and the crazy, domineering mother.  Actually, the latter has been replaced by an eerie doll that the mentally deranged heroine believes controls her thoughts and actions.
In his debut as both writer and director, Lucky McKee delivers a creepy, relatively understated tale of madness and murder.  Unlike many horror film directors, McKee allows the terror to build slowly, putting the audience in a state of expectant unease from the very start.  May is a severely psychologically disturbed young woman whose ""weirdness"" first attracts people, then repels them when they realize that that weirdness is far more real and far more deadly than anything they'd ever bargained for.  McKee has some fun with the notion that many people - i.e. the dabblers in the grotesque and the macabre, in other words, fans of films like this - may THINK they know what they like, but, like the rest of us, they run at the first sign of any real trouble.
The biggest weakness of ""May"" is that it often defies credibility.  Although Angela Bettis is terrific in the title role, May herself is so full of twitches and tics that one is amazed that she hasn't been institutionalized long before this, let alone that she is allowed to work with injured animals and blind children.  Similarly, her lesbian coworker, who sucks her thumb and practically drools at the slightest hint of anything bizarre, gives May a run for her money in the psycho-in-the-making sweepstakes.  Moreover, there's a receptionist at a day school for handicapped children who wouldn't last two seconds on the job in the real world.
Despite these few flaws, ""May"" does succeed as an unnerving exercise in twisted morbidity - at least up to a point.  That point is passed when the movie, in its final stages, turns into a bizarrely bloody variant on the ""Frankenstein"" theme, with dismembered body parts strewn from one end of the screen to the other.  That's when all but the most strong-stomached and seasoned horror film aficionados will have likely tuned the movie out.
In addition to Bettis, Jeremy Sisto and Anna Faris turn in excellent performances as the hapless ""friends"" and ultimate victims of this insane young woman.  ""May"" reveals these three fine performers and McKee as talents well worth keeping (as opposed to poking) an eye out for.",1060992000,,2339,4.928753180661578

The movie's description told me about a typical crazy girl who goes on a jolly killing spree and collects body parts to make herself the perfect companion. It didn't sound like anything new, but I saw Wes Craven's positive comment on the back. After returning the other two evening new release rental to the shelf, I went home expecting to see a slasher movie. What I got was much different... and much more. Here was May, a poor, lonely girl who was rejected by the world. But then came that special day. ""I saw someone today: a boy."" As the film progressed, I noticed how perfectly every detail was woven (or stitched) into the story. I also noticed that most of the other characters were also some sort of rejects. A lesbian couple, a goth, a punk, the blind children, even the boyfriend was a little strange. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against those types of people. I, myself, am also different. May was the most diverse, and yet her emotions were completely normal. All she wanted was a friend. It was too bad that things didn't turn out so well, but what's a movie without a plot? I found May to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. It was one of those rare films where you actually felt for the main character, and with May, I felt deeply. My rental on that totally normal day anything but normal. May, you took my heart.",1060646400,5,1602,4.343333333333334

weekend and was bummed that I didn't like it.  It wasn't at all scary,
some of it was even unintentionally funny, and I thought the lead
performance was self-conscious and mannered .  And I don't know if the ending was
supposed to be a surprise but it sure was telegraphed way in advance.  The supporting characters are all one-dimensional.",1060560000,2,406,4.690140845070423
1884895,4,B00009MEC4,"I can see why this movie went nowhere....the subject matter is extremely dark psychologically. How can sweet, shy May Kennedy turn into this utter monster who likes to, err....'sew' things together??? I won't ruin the ending for anyone, but suffice it to say it is one of the all time CREEPIEST things you'll ever see. And I'm someone who watches ""Operation"" on the Learning Channel while eating kidney stew!  NOT for the feint of heart.
What makes this film uneasy to watch is the lack of music during the particular gory scenes. The music does not jump at you when May does what she does. The pacing is slow and deliberate which reveals May's shyness. It is clear this is not a character who's comfortable around people and yet she pushes herself to deal with them. The results are awkward and disturbing. It's this sympathy you have for May that makes her wicked deeds later on so shocking. You can understand why she commits these heinous acts, but it's very hard to watch. The gore is not that bad, as other reviews have stated, it's the psychology behind it that make it difficult. This gentle person has been socialized in an awkward way, so it's only a matter of time before she snaps. I think I'll wait a while before watching this one again, it really stayed with me. For a horror movie? I'd call it good filmmaking. Judge for yourself, it's worth a rental.",1060387200,3,1367,4.579591836734694
1884896,5,B00009MEC4,"Have you ever tried to figure out what something is when your eyes are closed? You grab something round its cool and smooth to the touch. It feels solid so it's not some kind of Nerf ball or anything. Here you are standing in the middle of a room clutching something and you can't quite tell what it is. The object was an apple, but that's not the point.
MAY the new film by first time director Lucky McKee is just that kind of movie. At first maybe it's a romance, then again maybe it's a thriller, hmm.... Maybe it's some kind of comedy, light hearted or dark. At first glance you might just think it's a horror film. But May doesn't aspire to labels, it lives in that world beyond them and that's what works and doesn't work for a film like this.
MAY is one of those movies like Mullholland Drive, From Dusk `Til Dawn, or Femme Fatale. There is a moment in the film that will either grab you and pull you in, or turn you off and produces nothing but loathing. For me that moment came as the blind kids are well.... I don't think I want to share that sequence with you, but for me it worked.
MAY tells the story of a young women named May (Angela Bettis, Girl Interrupted) who seems really sweet on the outside, with just a touch of crazy attached. She had an overbearing mother (Merle Kennedy, Bubble Boy) who wanted her little girl to be perfect. It's just too bad she needed to wear an eye patch to correct a lazy eye. The kids in school all laughed and called her a pirate. To comfort the girl or make her crazy the film doesn't really say, May's mother gives her a prized possession, a freaky looking doll that has to stay in pristine condition in a glass box.
Somehow May survives this weird childhood and grows up to be stable but a little nuts. She falls for a guy with perfect hands (Jeremy Sisto, Wrong Turn) and a girl she works with (Anna Faris, Scary Movie) falls for her. Everything is perfect until these people turn their back on May, and well that's when the fun begins....
Angela Bettis is excellent; she is really beautiful, really vulnerable, and really expressive without doing much. She gives May this quality that is understated and yet still intense. I like how she says more with one look than lots of silly dialogue. She very much reminded me of a female Travis Bickle. She has a longing for what she can not have and is dealing with it the only way she know how.
Like in TAXI DRIVER, there is a moment when May is on the phone with Adam (the Sisto character) and he wants nothing to do with her anymore. Anyone else would have gotten the point. But not May and so when the realization comes, just as when Travis Bickle was dumped by Betsey something inside both of them snaps.
Another bright spot is Anna Faris. Why she pigeonholed herself in those stupid comedies is beyond me. She is excellent as May's lesbian workmate. She is bright and spunky and really funny. I'd love to see her do some more legitimate acting work. Hopefully this is the kind of film that she could use to get better roles. Who knows!!!
Director McKee makes it look easy. He has crafted a fascinating look into the eyes of a crazy person, by doing what few films can. He allows us to see that part of ourselves that is manifested in May. We've all at one time or another been treated [bad], made fun of, been ridiculed, and maybe some of us have tried to go over the deep end. I felt pity for May even if I shouldn't have. This is a powerful movie, and one of the best I've seen all year.
If Hollywood ever got off its rear end and decided that a film like MAY deserved to be shown at the same multiplex as FROM JUSTIN TO KELLY maybe their would be better quality films out there that the general market could consume. Until then it will probably only be discovered by lovers of film. I guess that's not so bad.
There are probably others out there that could find fault in a film like MAY. It's that kind of cinema, either you love it or your hate it. There is not much middle ground. But do yourself a favor, go and rent this movie.",1059955200,8,4036,4.2702349869451695
1884897,4,B00009MEC4,"Just out on DVD is a small film that never made it out to the theaters past the indie circuits and small festivals.  I almost want to say the movie is a black comedy and while you will laugh, you're left with thoughts of how disturbing it really is.
This is a really good movie and anyone who likes horror films should not miss out on it.  This movie is no where near the disturbing level of Audition from Takashi Miike, but ends up being along the same lines, so be forewarned.",1059868800,,478,4.184782608695652
1884898,5,B00009MEC4,"I've been dying to see this movie since Ain't It Cool News named it one of the ten best movies of 2002, but the movie had a very limited theatrical release and never played in my home state.  Well, I ordered it from Amazon as soon as I heard the DVD was out and I got it yesterday.
Angela Bettis plays May, a girl born with a lazy eye whose demanding mother wants her daughter to be the perfect girl.  She deals with the lazy eye by making May wear an eye patch at all times, but her classmates tease her (""Are you a pirate?"" asks a little boy in one scene) and she grows up friendless and lonely, except for a doll her mother made and gave to her.
The movie skips to the present, with May now an adult working at an animal hospital.  She no longer wears the patch, but still has no friends and has never even had a boyfriend.  When she sees Adam, she's convinced that he's perfect, so she gets contact lenses to correct the lazy eye and starts following him around, unsure of how to approach him.  While this is happening, her sexy lesbian co-worker, Polly, starts hinting at her attraction toward May and eventually seduces her.
I don't want to give away the meaty parts, but lets just say that fragile May doesn't handle rejection or disappointment well and she comes completely undone in the final third of the movie.  It's heartbreaking to see a girl who's suffered so much go through such humiliation and Bettis handles the role perfectly.  The ""cracking glass"" scene where May starts to fall apart is filled with tension, but it's nothing compared to what follows.
I can't recommend this movie highly enough, but at the same time I have to warn that it's not for everyone.  Despite Harry Knowles' campaign to get a wider release for the movie, it only played in a handful of test cities and film festivals and you can see why from the opening minutes.  May is not a commercial movie.  The victim and monster are both the same character and the ending is neither happy nor satisfying as the price May pays in the end just seems too cruel even in light of all the horrible things she's done.  Compared to May, I think Donnie Darko had it pretty good.
But forget all that and see May for yourselves.  If you can enjoy something offbeat and dark, you'll be in for a real treat with this movie.",1059696000,,2296,4.363849765258216
1884899,1,B00009MEC4,"I suspect most of the glowing reviews were written by ""woe is me"" high schoolers, or those who fancy themselves uniquely capable of spotting (and enjoying) an artistic or particularly insightful film.  This feature is neither artistic nor insighftul.  In fact, it is only unique in that it tries to shoehorn bits and pieces co-opted from Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, and Tim Burton films, into 80 minutes.  It offers a poorly developed plot, an incoherent storyline, and a predictable ending.  The acting is fair, but the main character is pathetic, cowardly, and mean.  I think it is insulting that Lucky McKee and the producers of this movie believe that I - as a viewer - should find something unique about this film, or something about the main character that should resonate with me.  One of a kind?  I'm thankful for that.",1059609600,14,833,4.9071428571428575

1884901,5,B00009MEC4,"""May"" is a truly brilliant yet difficult film. It is a tale of loneliness and despair as well as one of the desire to be noticed. The main character of May, beautifully portrayed by Angela Bettis, is lost in a sea of humanity, unable to be noticed by others and incapable of communicating with anyone effectively. The film illustrates this from her early years to the present and is a solid study of a descent into complete madness. Famed critic Roger Ebert has campaigned strongly for this film and while I agree with him, I would suggest that it is not for those uninitiated with horror or the very disturbing. There are multiple sequences throughout the film that are very shocking and almost gratuitous in the display of pain and suffering. That said, for those who can handle this type of storytelling, there is much to be rewarded. If you are looking for something out of the ordinary or are a fan of seriously depraved cinema, check it out.....it may be the best film of 2003.",1059436800,4,983,4.590909090909091
1884915,3,B00009MEC4,"OK, based on a lot of the reviews I've read here, I decided to give ""May"" a rent at my local blockbuster yesterday. I was both pleased and unsatisfied at the same time. I won't bother going through the plot since it is already outlined in some of the other reviews in great detail.
The movie has a constant creepy feeling through the whole thing, which is a very good mood for a horror movie to have. I commend the directors/actors on achieving that. The story, while not exactly totally original, is rather fresh and more unique than anything I have seen in a horror flick recently. I think the shining light for this movie was the acting. ""May"" was played wonderfully by Angela Bettis and her character convinced me of her weirdness. The supporting cast was good enough and I liked Anna Farris as the lesbian []. It developed some very funny (albeit unintentional) humor.
The downsides to the film are that I felt, quite frankly, a lot of it was boring. The first 50 minutes has pretty much nothing going on. I understand that we need the story developed and we need just how weird she is illustrated, but that doesn't change the fact that I was bored through some of it. I thought I'd been watching the movie for 40 minutes when I looked at the clock and it had been 20. Some of it is interesting, but I would say I was bored through about half of that first 50-55 minutes.
And while the ending is both expected and anticipated, there is a slight (I'll call it a ""twist"" for lack of a better word) that is quite good. Hence earning another half a star in my book. The last 20 minutes (especially the last 5) are pretty good. I wish more of the movie was like that.
All in all an entertaining horror movie that came out of left field. And while I wouldn't purchase it - I would certainly recommend a rent if it's in your taste. 3.5 Stars",1059264000,2,1839,4.333333333333333
1884916,5,B00009MEC4,"May, is a film that really touched me. I think that it is really sad that Hollywood can put out Sh*t like Dracula 2000 and Ghost Ship ? But something this well put together that has meaning and depth goes straight to video? This movie is one of th best horror films I have seen in a long time. And I think Angela Bettis deserves a little F**cking credit for this amazing performance! The end of the film made me cry and I am not very emotional when it comes to movies. To see a person go through life being odd and not excepted is one thing! But to see MAYs character is another! I think everyone can relate to this film in one form or another. Everyone has put trust in Man and realtionships and was felled. But this movie just shows how some take these failures harder that others. And May definitley didn't love herself enough to realize it wasn't all that serious. And I think that is what makes this film so sad in the end. To finally realize and see the self hate that she had for her own self.

1884918,3,B00009MEC4,"May is a different kind of horror film, one told from the point of view of the...perhaps we should call her the antiheroine. May is the kind of character found in Ruth Rendell novels -complex, conflicted and deranged in a unique way. May, played perfectly by Angela Bettis, is a shy, socially awkward young woman who works in an animal hospital. Early flashback scenes inform us that she had to wear an eye patch as a young girl and, as a result, had trouble making friends (though this could not possibly explain how she ultimately turns out). Her mother buys the young girl a handmade doll, which can never leave its cabinet. This becomes her best friend and confidant. No, the doll doesn't talk back or come alive; May is strange enough on her own. May develops a crush on a young man played by Jeremy Sisto. She is especially fascinated by his hands, a fact which later becomes significant. She also has another potential romantic interest, a female  co-worker (Anna Faris). May, however, proves to be too strange for even the hippest and oddest of her companions and once people get to know her they soon start to avoid her. May, it turns out, does not take rejection well. She gradually develops the habit of slicing up people who offend her, a list that grows by the day. The ending is suitably macabre. This is definitely not a film for the squeamish. As far as slasher/horror movies go, this one is more thoughtful, original and better-acted than most. Still, it never quite transcends the genre. As well done as it is, the second half of the film is played mainly for gore and shock value. May was an interesting enough character that I would have preferred to have her played as a real person rather than a mere killing machine.",1059004800,7,1739,4.591639871382637

Her mother gave her a doll when she was younger but told her she couldn't take it out of the box to play with it.  This doll becomes her only friend for what seems like almost her whole life.  I feel sorry for May in the movie because she's ""different.""  Misunderstood?  Tortured?  There are some very disturbing images in the film ... not for the weak stomached.  Parts that might make you squirm:  show & tell with the blind kids, kitty's sudden ash tray death, eye scratching, eye gouging, the mini-movie, and all the end parts.  I think this movie will definitely be a cult classic, not unlike ""Carrie.""  Angela Bettis is an amazing actress ... and her castmates are incredible as well.  Think: College film gone terribly wrong.  :)  This movie is not meant to be taken seriously.  It's a black dramedy.  Some people will not get it.  The short movie within the movie is the start of May's transformation into, well, a woman Dr. Frankenstein, if you will.  INTERESTING ending.  You have to watch the movie to really get the gist of it (I don't want to ruin it for you).  I think you'll be surprised at what you see.  ;)  If you're looking for a movie that is original and creative, this is it.  Go on, rent it, what do you have to lose?  All movies are experiences, right?  Good or bad.  In my opinion, this just happens to be one of the good ones.  If you enjoy movies that are not mainstream and a little dark, I think you'll enjoy MAY.  Love the commentaries on the DVD ... very humorous.

Watching the last 30 minutes of the film literally made me sick to my stomach and cringe. Building up that point is a marvelously acted film about lonely outcast May, played remarkably by Angela Bettis (Girl Interrupted, TV Carrie). Angelas perfect performance truly makes this film what it is. Starting off as a shy, awkward girl who only wants to have a date with Jeremy Sisto(Six Feet Under, Wrong Turn), then turning into a crazy, creepy lunatic, Angela makes us feel sorry for her and then be intrigued as to why she does the things she does. This makes the final 30 minutes all the more exciting, and sometimes unbearable to watch. Jeremy Sisto gives a strong performance as Mays object of desire, and Anna Faris(Scary Movie, The Hot Chick) turns in a likable performance as Mays lesbian co-worker.
