Artistic highlights are the brief wagon on a rainy night scene and the longer ""Gepetto in the whale"" sequence.

Pinocchio is voiced by Dckie Jones, a skilled horseman from age 4 who later appeared in many western films and TV shows. Cliff Edwards, the voice of Jiminy Cricket here, was a popular 1920s recording artist known as 'Ukulele Ike.' Edwards is credited with inventing a style of jazz singing called 'scat.' Cliff referred to it as 'effing.'

The original Popeye, gravel-voiced William Costello, is probably heard as a statue, although IMDb assumes it's his FLEISCHER replacement, Jack Mercer. In his only Disney picture (not counting ""Roger Rabbit""), Mel Blanc's sole contribution is a hiccup (all his dialogue was cut).

Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.
