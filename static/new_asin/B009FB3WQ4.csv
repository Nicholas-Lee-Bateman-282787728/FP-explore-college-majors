5323950,5,B009FB3WQ4,Fabulous tribute to the greatest singer of all time!!!! Great to hear recordings by her sung by other artists. Highly recommended.,1354752000,,130,5.238095238095238
5323951,5,B009FB3WQ4,"Just received the Music Cares tribute. The tribute was very moving from all the performers. The highlight for
me was hearing and seeing her actually sing the two songs from the Bergman collection. Quite moving!!

5323952,3,B009FB3WQ4,"I just finished watching the DVD and was very disappointed! The show is heavily edited and only shows Barbra Streisand Performing two songs. The DVD is only approx one hour and the entire show has such a hurried pace to it showing one performer after another singing one of Barbara's songs! It would have been nice if the producer of this DVD could have featured the entire show because I know that Barbra sang more than 2 songs! For the true Barbra Fan who needs to be a completist and own everything that she comes out with, I would still buy it but be warned there isn't much of Barbra on the DVD!",1353196800,17,600,4.31858407079646
5323953,3,B009FB3WQ4,"Barbra is great and, actually, mesmerizing in her performances.  The other performers are wonderful but, like someone else wrote, would have liked a bit more of the event on the DVD thus the 3 stars. The entire event seems a bit rushed and unfocused.  I am sure the evening was more impressive than this.  Anyway, its still great to see and hear these singers.",1352937600,13,360,4.59375
5323954,2,B009FB3WQ4,"First, Barbra sounded amazing!!! All the other performers were great as well... Now the disappointment, the show was edited way too much! It felt rushed and the magic of the night was taken away. They should have kept the introductions and unedited all the performances from the night. Barbra did a beautiful medley of her hits and Make Someone Happy, which was removed for some reason?! A proper release should have been done to celebrate a one of our greatest voices.",1352764800,37,469,4.802469135802469

I saw this concert on AXS.TV and I wanted the Seal song, reading some other reviews, people were disapointed that the concert was edited for the CD. I found that the CD was the same as what I saw on TV. It's a great tribute to Barbara. Enjoy",1403308800,2,392,4.131578947368421

5323994,5,B009FB3WQ4,There is nothing that I can say really she is my complete favourite singer and not only that being Jewish I am so proud of the help she has given to Israel and to her help to charities all over the world and also she is the kind of person that does not brag about anything,1360972800,,272,3.875

5324000,3,B009FB3WQ4,"MusiCares, established in 1989 by The Recording Academy, was created to provide essential services to music people in times of need. Each year, MusiCares presents a Person of the Year Tribute Concert to honor those who have generously given to support their cause.  The 2011 honoree was the legendary Barbra Streisand, and the evening was recorded and is being made available for purchase, with all the proceeds going to MusiCares.

""A MusiCares Tribute to Barbra Streisand"" presents many of today's most notable performers interpreting some of Streisand's classic hits. Highlights from the concert include songstress Leona Lewis' straight ahead interpretation of Streisand's 1984 recording of ""Somewhere"" from the musical ""West Side Story;"" an appropriately titled version of the standard, ""Smile,"" performed by the always happy Tony Bennett; a wailing arrangement of ""Come Rain or Come Shine,"" featuring the eclectic trio of LeAnn Rimes, gospel mainstay BeBe Winans, and guitar legend Jeff Beck; and a rousing version of ""People,"" the Bob Merrill and Jule Styne classic made famous by Barbra in the 1964 Broadway production of ""Funny Girl,"" with Stevie Wonder getting the audience on their feet while exchanging riffs with trumpeter Arturo Sandaval.

Not all of the performances are rousing: Barry Manilow's attempt to be youthful doesn't quite hit the mark during his rendition of the Andrew Lloyd Webber anthem, ""Memory;"" Faith Hill, though always well-coiffed, appeared out-of-place attempting the Stephen Sondheim penned, ""Send in the Clowns;"" and Streisand's ""mini-me,"" Lea Michele, tries to milk every note she can out of ""My Man,"" written exclusively for the ""Funny Girl"" film. Fortunately, the concert ends with the madam herself performing an outstanding version of ""Windmills of Your Mind,"" written by her frequent beneficiaries Marilyn and Alan Bergman, and ""The Promise (I'll Never Say Goodbye).""  The recording is worth the investment: the money goes to a good cause and you get two performances by Streisand herself.",1358121600,,2032,5.461783439490445
5324001,5,B009FB3WQ4,Good quality dvd with good content--buy anything with one of her live performances.  The program content wasn't all that great.  Hard for many present day entertainers to even come close in matching her stature.  How do you do a tribute to a true living legend?,1357776000,,261,4.7555555555555555
5324002,3,B009FB3WQ4,Have not been able to view it as it is in a different zone to Australia. When purchased it was very appealing,1357257600,,109,4.0
5324003,1,B009FB3WQ4,"Not only a very technical poor quality but a insane editing of the night.
I didn't think possible such a product so ridiculous.......... poor Barbra..... much better when she had the complete control of her artistic work.",1357171200,3,221,5.0
5324004,5,B009FB3WQ4,"If you're a Streisand fan, you will love everything about it!  Definitely worth the purchase.  Also a surprise in it.",1356480000,,117,4.8
5324005,5,B009FB3WQ4,Who doesn't know Barbra. I think she is one of our best singers still going strong. The fact that she came back to Brooklyn and new her roots. This is great and I'm not disappointed at all.,1356220800,,189,4.135135135135135
5324006,5,B009FB3WQ4,"It was worth the cost even though it doesn't show the tribute only the singers who sing songs associated with Barbra. Lea Michele, Faith Hill and Bill Maher (who was the only celebrity that spoke) was worth the money. I also noticed one man who I didn't recognize (and I'm in the entertainment field) was close captioned often and I never seen him before. Lack of Streisand being the focus also annoyed me, but I love Barbra and would pay to hear her read the alphabet.",1356220800,,469,4.465116279069767
5324007,4,B009FB3WQ4,After getting past the first performer who was just not my thing and hearing how sadly bad Stevie Wonder was who has always been so great-the rest of the performers and of course Barbra were a real treat.,1356220800,,204,4.394736842105263
5324008,3,B009FB3WQ4,"Ok.  Pretty good performances.  Well, Stevie at the end with ""People""....ah.....I don't think so.  Definitely not the best song for him.  The surprise of the evening was Faith Hill singing ""Send in the Clowns"".  What a knockout performance.  Barbra's two songs were excellent, as always.  But if she won an award, or if there was an award, why wasn't she presented with it....or introduced before she sang....or SOMETHING???  She just ended up being just another singer instead of taking a bow for her achievement in receiving the tribute.  I felt cheated.",1355788800,,556,5.021978021978022
5324009,3,B009FB3WQ4,"I was disappointed with the people/singers that were chosen to honor her, after all it's Barbra Streisand the best there is!!!",1355702400,,126,5.0476190476190474
5324010,5,B009FB3WQ4,"What a wonderful memento of one of the most PHENOMENAL nights of my life!  I was so GRATEFUL AND SOOOO THRILLED, to have been there that night to witness this first hand!  Seeing and hearing my LIFETIME IDOL, Barbra Streisand being honored by so many great artists and hearing them sing her songs was EXTREMELY, EXTREMELY special to me. What an amazing experience just to be in that room!!!

Of course, the highlight of the evening was seeing Barbra performing live for the grand finale.  I can't even begin to express what an AMAAAAZING THRILL that was!!!!  Ever since that night, I couldn't wait for the DVD to come out so I could relive that performance OVER and OVER again!!!!  Needless to say, I was REALLY disappointed to see that most of her performance had been drastically cut from this DVD.

HOWEVER.... the two songs that Barbra DOES sing on here are SOOOO BEYOND SPECTACULAR, even if those two songs were the ONLY songs, on here, it would make this DVD worth having!  Barbra's renditon of ""The Promise"" is one of the most INCREDIBLE performances I've ever seen in my entire life!!!!  That performance has stayed in my head ever since that MAGICAL night, and being able to see it again on this DVD is a G-DSEND!!!!

Thank you for another wonderful ""BARBRA TREASURE"" to add to my collection!!!!!
