The only video of Amy on here is when she is seen getting out of a car.....same footage over and over again.  Nothing new.  I was disappointed, and I sure wouldn't want you to be!!",1337299200,11,358,4.693548387096774
8471228,1,B005G5YH3U,"this DVD appears to have been made by some local(Camden area) musicians. It is punctuated by their tribute songs to Ms. Winehouse. Put simply the songs are terrible and there are only three images of Amy in the entire 45 min. video, which are constantly recycled. I learned nothing new about the artist (and I've only seen Amy Winehouse: the girl done good).please, do not waste your money or time.",1327795200,11,398,4.7
