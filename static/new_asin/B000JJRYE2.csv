2673980,3,B000JJRYE2,This piece of film is about operating a leather contest. There are those who do and those who observe. Fun times for every interest.,1203465600,,132,4.541666666666667
2673981,5,B000JJRYE2,"When I came out as a part of the leather community, I found it odd that so many of my friends treated me like straight people do when they find out your gay.  I was pleased this film included so many different aspects of our community.  I think most people think of 24/7 slave master relationships, when you mention leather, it's important to make all the other fetishes visible and thus less threatening for those that are attracted to this outlet for their sexuality.",1182816000,4,469,4.571428571428571
2673982,5,B000JJRYE2,"Facinating glimps on what the men who enter these contests are thinking, and why they want to be a title winner, it surprised me, I am slightly involved in the leather community and did not realize what all these title holders have to do for the next year, after winning, it's a surprising journey, my only complaint is that, the material is several years old, and the DVD add makes one think it's recent, still, I am glad I bought it, although I am not sure how often I will look at it.",1181865600,2,487,4.247311827956989
2673983,5,B000JJRYE2,This is one of best documentary that I have ever seen. It is very well edited and you really get into the contest toward to the end. There are few moments you almost cry. It is just so funny. Take your stereo types away and watch it. You will like it.,1181001600,,251,3.9411764705882355
8151318,5,B000JJRYE2,"This documentary captures the events surrounding the most unexpectedly positive night of my life.

Prior to this night had someone asked me about leather I would have said that leather was what Jim Morrison or Axl Rose or the Hells Angels wore but what macho bravodo those men can boast is nothing in comparison to the masculinity on display at The El Rey that steamy evening in 2003.

If leather in straight society represents rebellion, non-conformity, individuality and brotherhood then gay leather culture amplifies this by a factor of ten. These men not only challenge the failings of society but challenge the traditional interpretation of masculinity as well, an interpretation that some argue is responsible for many of our failings in the first place.

Watching this film brought many memories and the powerful sense that I had been present for one of the handful of events in my lifetime that really matters. That the event was a pageant attended by not more than a few hundred people makes the event even more mystifying.

I was forever changed following this night in 2003 but years would pass before I understood the connection between us. Back then I saw Mister LA Leather as something that I could admire. More recently I have come to see leather culture as something that is an essential part of me as well.
