2582664,4,B000FS2W3K,"Masters of Horror has been good but very uneven in its execution. Haeckel's Tale is the last episode for Season One and it sure ends the season on a disturbingly kinky compilation of twisted grotesqueries. The story is from a Clive Barker short story that's been adapted by Mick Garris (fellow Masters of Horror director and also its brainchild) and produced by George A. Romero to be directed by John McNaughton.

Already, one wonders why Romero would be producing instead of directing the piece. Scheduling conflicts prohibited Romero from taking the director's chair and he instead recommended John McNaughton (his one film which earned him Master of Horror status is one of the best horror films of the last qurater century: Henry - Portrait of a Serial Killer). The fact that Romero was originally chosen to direct Barker's Garris adapted short story means there's got to be zombies or some form of undead within. I, for one, was glad that Romero decided that he wouldn't be able to direct and chose another in his stead. Barker's short story does indeed include zombies but it also has a heavy sense of the old classic technicolor Hammer Films vibe to it. Haeckel's Tale under the capable hands of McNaughton takes those Hammer Films conventions and ramps it up into overdrive.

Even though John McNaughton really has only one true horror film under his belt (he also directed a little-known cult scifi-horror called The Borrowers which had fledgling effects shop KNB FX still doing things guerilla-style), but his work in Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer more than earns him his horror creds. In Haeckel's Tale, John McNaughton clearly has a bit of fun making the only true period piece in the whole Masters of Horror series. McNaughton goes for the classic Hammer Films look for this episode and it shows in the gothic, fog-shrouded atmosphere in the outdoor scenes. The look of the costumes and even the dialogue harkens back to those Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing Hammer Films.

The story is a mixture of the Frankenstein tale with a some Cemetary Man mixed in. Haeckel's Tale begins somewhere around the 1800's and I'm assuming close to the end of it from the costume worn by Steve Bacic who played Mr. Ralston who arrives to seek the help of Miz Carnation who is purported to be a necromancer who can grant him his wish to have his dead wife brought back to life for him. Miz Carnation rebuffs Ralston, but after some begging she makes a deal with him to hear Haeckel's Tale. If he still wants his wife brought back to life after hearing it then she would do so. Ernst Haeckel (played by Derek Cecil)is a young medical professor whose obsession to conquer death mirrors that of a certain eccentric European scientist he so admires. Unlike his idol, Haeckel's attempt to use electricity to put the spark of life back into a corpse fails dramatically. He's soon investigating the rumor of a certain traveling necromancer who goes by the name of Montesquino (played by Joe Polito) who he thinks to be a fraud, but he soon finds out that Montesquino is all he says he is when Haeckel stumbles upon Wolfram (played by Stargate SG-1's own Maybourne, Tom McBeath) and his stunning young wife Elise (the drop-dead gorgeous Leela Savasta).

Haeckel quickly lusts after the young Elise, but as Wolfram will later tell him as the story nears it's climax (in more ways than one), Elise cannot be satisfied by him or Haeckel. Her obsession with a dead husband she loves and cannot let go brings Haeckel to a scene that he cannot comprehend nor accept as something she truly wants. I must say that Leela Savasta's performance as the dead-obsessed Elise is only surpassed by Anna Falchi's own work as ""She"" in Dellamorte Dellamore. Leela's pretty much spending most of her screentime fully naked and writhing around in an orgy not typical of most horror movies. It's also in this orgy scene where we get the biggest Clive Barker feel to the story. Anyone how has read Barker earlier work knows the man can mix horror and sex like no other.

The ending of the episode brings to it a slight twist with Miz Carnation being more than she says she is. This Masters of Horror episode is not the best of the lot, but it is one of the better looking ones in terms of cinematography and it's leads. It also doesn't have much in terms of genuine scares. The story gradually builds up the dreads and disturbing images but never anything that will put a genuine heart-stopping scare on the viewer. Like McNaughton's own foray into horror with Henry, Haeckel's Tale lets the story's own disturbing themes on obsession and the darker side of love put the horror in the story. It does have a nice gore-laden sequence courtesy of Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero and their KNB FX team.

In the end, Haeckel's Tale is a very good episode which has its flaws like the rest of the Masters of Horror episodes. What sets it apart from the rest of the series entries is its unique Hammer Films look and the return of McNaughton back in the director's chair as a horror filmmaker. It's no Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, but Haeckel's Tale will have enough disturbing images to burn itself to its audiences' minds.",1175472000,5,5197,4.705494505494506
2582665,2,B000FS2W3K,"This is by far one of the most interestingly morbid love stories I have seen in the Masters of Horror series.  The plot has a good story but is alittle to morbid for my taste.  The end is definently a twist I was not expecting.  If you liked House of a 1000 corpses, you might like this movie.  It's kind of the same morbid twist.",1173484800,,330,4.030769230769231
2582666,3,B000FS2W3K,"Haeckle's Tale has an impressive pedigree behind it. Clive Barker is one of the horror gods, a twisted mind that has brought us a 1000 dark horrors including Hellraiser and Nightbreed. He also wrote the Books of Blood, check those out for a scary read. However, John McNaughton is responsible for `gems' like Wild Things (yuck!). Unfortunately, it is his influence that is felt more than  Barker's.

What you're left with is Haeckle's Tale about a young doctor, overly influenced by Frankenstein, who wants to bring the dead back to life. Frustrated by attempts using science that fail, he instead finds himself trapped in the realm of necromancy. The movie could have been good had it perused this path, but instead it took a left turn at Albuquerque, as Bugs Bunny would say.

From there, it jumps to soft core zombie porn, almost as if this movie was made with the premise of ""Let's through together a little quick plot and then have a really hot actress have sex with a zombie or two"". The framing sequence makes no sense, especially one at the end.

I love Masters of Horror, but this is one of the most disappointing. Instead of wasting your money on this, get Fair Haired Child instead, which is the best of the series. Buy Haeckle's Tale only if you're completing your set, but don't expect to be scared or overly entertained.

2582667,5,B000FS2W3K,"I'm a very big fan of The Masters Of Horror show on showtime, but to have showtime where I live because it's about $50 extra. So everytime that a one hour movie is released on DVD, I go out and buy it the day it comes out and watch it that day. So far I have seen every Masters Of Horror DVD that has came out.

I really didn't know what to expect before watching this episode because I have never seen Henry - The Portrait Of A Serial Killer which is director John Mcnaughton claim to fame. I am a huge fan of Clive Barkers work though, and seeing that this is a short story of his, I expected something a lot better than usual, which is exactly what this episode is.

This has to be one of the best episodes of Masters Of Horror so far. The story is unique and bizarre, which manages to capture your attention all the way through the movie, unlike a lot of of movies where you have a good idea of what is going to happen next. The actors are deliver great performances even though they are not very well known actors. The special effects are terrific, and there is really not a weak spot in the whole movie.

2582668,4,B000FS2W3K,"So in loving all the rest of the Masters of horror movies, and being a HUGE fan of clive barkers... this was a pretty easy decision to pick this up.  I had no idea what to expect, not seeing a trailer for it anywhere and only going off of the artwork and premise from the dvd.  But this adaption of a Clive Barker story tells the tale of a man who visits an old woman who is told to be able to bring the dead to life.  She convinces the man that if he still wants his wife back at the end of her story, she will do just that.  Then the story begins...

It concerns a man named Ernst Haeckel who (very similiar to Frankenstein) beleives that God has no part in death and that he can make the dead rise.  In failing numerous times, he hears of a man who can make the dead rise through black magic.. a necromancer.  He visits this man and still not convinced, visits him again to confront him of his power.  This does not go over well, and he is left to his own devices.

After receiving news of his fathers illness, Heackel leaves to see him.. on his way he is brought in by an old man and his young wife.  The wife is very beautiful and the man is in his 60's.  Soemthing does not seem right and then the wife in the middle of the night leaves towards the ""necropolis"" to meet up with the necromancer whom her husband paid to have her dead husband brought back to her.

Without spoiling too much of it, I'll just say this... you won't know what hit you in the end and if you enjoy a good zombie movie, then this one might be up your alley.  George A. Romero also was involved in the making of this film if that tells you anything.

All in all, I enjoy period pieces and Frankenstein is one of my all time favorite classic movies.  I would recommend this to anyone who has enjoyed both Clives stories and the MOH series.  The only thing that I found not to my liking was the end was a little creepy-sappy, but once you see it... you'll know what I mean.

2582671,4,B000FS2W3K,"Based on a Clive Barker story and originally slated to be directed by George Romero, Haeckel's Tale ended up being helmed by Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer director John McNaughton, and you may not even know the difference upon viewing.  Haeckel's Tale revolves around a nineteenth century medical student (Derek Cecil) who aims to learn a way of re-animating the dead before embarking on a trip to visit his terminally ill father.  His journey leads him to encounter a necromancer (Jon Polito) and a couple (Tom McBeath and the gorgeous Leela Savasta); all of whom share a horrible secret that you will have to see to believe.  Haeckel's Tale is a nasty, sexy, and bloody affair to be sure, and combined with the hammy performances and dynamite ending, ranks as one of the best episodes of Masters of Horror.  All in all, Haeckel's Tale is an inventive treat that definitely deserves a look if you're a zombie fan, even if Masters of Horror isn't usually your thing.",1222387200,3,971,4.761904761904762

McNaughton (Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer) turns in his entry in the first series of Masters of Horror with an adaptation of a Clive Barker joint. In it, Ernst Haeckel (Push, Nevada's Derek Cecil) is forced to seek shelter during a storm, and finds it with the Wolframs-- a husband (AVP2's Tom McBeath) whose first name we never learn, and his young, beautiful wife Elise (Black Christmas' Leela Savasta). Haeckel, of course, finds her as delicious as the meal he's offered, and Wolfram, oddly, has no problem with that, but there's a great deal more to this odd little story than Wolfram's letting on-- and, as is always the way with rash young men in love, Wolfram has no choice but to let Haeckel discover the family secret for himself, with amusing consequences. Features a very amusing turn from McNaughton's Homicide: Life on the Street crony Jon Polito as a fortune teller. Fun stuff, this. ***",1205107200,,965,4.848484848484849

2582677,5,B000FS2W3K,"In the late 1880's, medical student Ernst Haeckel (Derek Cecil) has a belief that there can be life after death and even resurrection. He goes out to see his ill father as he gets shelter for the night at the house of an old man and his attractive young wife (Leela Savasta) but beyond the house is a strange graveyard where the dead can come back to life and magically conducted by a necromancer (Jon Polito) who has the powers to resurrect dead corpses.

A horrific, erotic, gothic and gory as hell tale of the undead based on a Clive Barker tale and associated with George A. Romero and directed by Henry-Portrait of a Serial Killer's John McNaughton. It's also a fascinating story of the macabre that only Hellraiser's Clive Barker can write and there's good acting and thrilling gore & zombie make-up here mix with some erotic yet bizarre scenes involving the sexy Leela Savasta. This is not a story for everyone or the weak stomached but this is one of the better stories on ""Masters of Horror"".

The Whole Does Not Equal the Sum of its Parts

Adapted from a Clive Barker tale.
Scripted by (Director of Sleepwalkers, MOH Creator)Mick Garris.
Produced by George (King of the Living Dead) Romero.
& Directed by John (Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer)McNaughton.

By looking at those names alone,
you'd think this baby has horror classic written all over it.
And to be honest, you'll wind up purchasing it (regardless of what I say)based on those names alone.
BUT BE WARNED, YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!
Which is a shame because, it has some great scenes in it too,
but suprisingly, not enough to keep your interest peaked.

Are there zombies?
Oh yes, there are zombies of all shapes and sizes.
But not the vicious kind, we're used to.
Instead we're treated to the kind that patiently waits on line at an undead orgy.
And that doesn't even occur until the last 5 minutes of the movie.
In fact, it takes forever just to get there.
And by that time, you're already tired of the movie, and browsing through your collection for something else to watch.
Don't get me wrong the last 10 minutes are great, but the preceding 50 are pure cinematic torture.

If you're looking for a traditional zombie flick,
You could do alot better.
If instead you're just looking for a unique, long-winded, take on the subject of undead lore.
My suggestion is to rent it first,
because chances are,
this one will never find it's way into your DVD player for a second viewing.

8125801,1,B000FS2W3K,"A young scientist who wants to raise the dead is plunged into a dark world of eroticism and necromancy. And for some reason, the scientist is Ernst Haeckel.

For those who don't know, the real Haeckel was a German biologist, naturalist, and artist (quite an interesting one at that!), who helped popularize the works of Charles Darwin. He lived to the ripe old age of 85, and was not killed by a zombie baby when he was a 20-something pretty boy (oh, um spoilers).

That's what's baffling to me personally about ""Haeckel's Tale""; WHY is it Haeckel's Tale? I don't quite get the thought process behind the genesis of this story, as it has little to nothing to do with the actual works of Ernst Haeckel. The ""Haeckel"" of this story is just a generic young mad scientist/Frankenstein wannabe (this isn't just figurative, he actually wants to emulate the work of Victor Frankenstein). My point is, there's really no reason for this young fellow to be called ""Ernst Haeckel"", and it doesn't add anything to the film. It just makes it bizarre for those who know who he is. It's like calling a film ""The Story of Ben Franklin"", and then it being about a young inventor who investigates a nest of tentacle-monsters, and nothing else has anything to do with the real Benjamin Franklin, other than the main character is named after him, and is an inventor. I'm also not sure if the real Haeckel fell in love with women as quickly as a Disney prince, and didn't care if they liked bedding maggot-ridden corpses.

Alright, enough whining about the name! How is the actual episode?

Well...pretty bad. I really don't get what people see in this episode. Admittedly, the acting isn't bad, and itt has the same amazing production values as the rest of the MoH series, but there's just...nothing here. No core theme, no moral, no commentary. Nothing. It's just about about a young scientist who falls in love overnight with a lady who happens to literally do the nasty with walking corpses. I'm not saying every story has to have an incredibly deep meaning or message behind it, but they should have a point, even a simple one. So what's the point of ""Haeckel's Tale""? A woman likes having sex with her dead husband. Okay...why? It seems like something conceived by a 14-year-old horror junkie who just found out what ""necrophilia"" means, and wanted to do a super dark scary story about it. Oh, and they just had a biology class that mentioned Ernst Haeckel, so throw him in there too. And I'm not sure whether this was how the original Clive Barker story was, or if it's been heavily altered by the director, but the finished product is just lacking, regardless.

Even on a pure visceral level, this doesn't offer anything. There's not much in the ways of scares throughout the entire movie, and the big reveal at the end isn't really frightening, just kinda gross. Aside from the undead orgy, there's not much you see here that you can't see in other zombie flicks or period tales. Ignoring the story and just looking at this as a horror spectacle, it falls just as flat.

If you want to see some good episodes of Masters of Horror, check out ""Family"", ""Screwfly Solution"", ""Deer Woman"", or ""Cigarette Burns"". If you want to see something interesting about the real Ernst Haeckel, watch ""Proteus"", by David Lebrun. If you want to watch a woman have an undead orgy in a cemetery...don't talk to me.",1383523200,,3383,4.667785234899329
8125802,5,B000FS2W3K,"Haeckel's Tale is without a doubt the best episode from Season One of the Masters of Horror series, sold by Amazon separately as a single movie,  featuring a tale from the mind of Clive Barker, the highly acclaimed author whom Stephen King claims is the future of horror following his Books of Blood anthologies, who spawned an entire franchise that has not only transformed into cult classics but also greatly influenced an entire generation of body piercing individuals in The United States, and, with references to such horror classics as Frankenstein and Night of the Living Dead, it is sure to satisfy any horror fan.

The story revolves around Haeckel, who is taken in by a couple, after a weary night, and finds himself deeply attracted to the man's wife, whom he later discovers has reanimated her ex-lover, with whom she is still infatuated and can't forget, through the use of sorcery, with her husband tolerating this misadventure, given the fact that he cannot fully satisfy her in bed, much to the chagrin of Haeckel, who upon witnessing her make love to the slightly decomposed corpse of her ex-lover, finds himself disgusted and repulsed, and despite the fact that he, eventually, does manage to engage in sexual intercourse with her, discovers that he is unable to totally satisfy her cravings - as more and more of her former lovers are reanimated and they all participate in an orgy.

With allusions to Frankenstein reanimating the corpse of body parts sewn together and brought to life through electricity, harnessed from lightning, as well as to the zombies featured in Romero's Night of the Living Dead, Haeckel's Tale is sure to please the hardest core of horror fans.",1356307200,,1690,4.922807017543859

First the pedestrian stuff. This is an historical horror movie, all horse drawn carriages and talk of electricity. It's nice for a change of pace and is well done here.

The films main character is that old chestnut ""a man of science"". He is trying to replicate Victor Frankenstein's experiments and is instead setting corpses on fire. The movie takes a very unexpected turn as he is summoned to his dying father and precedes on a leisurely peregrination kind of like that the gay character takes in As Good As It Gets.

On his jaunt he runs into a Necromancer that raise people from the dead for a fee who is very well played by Coen favorite Jon Polito (A cheap talented Danny DeVito). Man of science is curious but disparages the hocus pocus mystical explanation of the necromancers skills.

The movie continues to meander much like the main character until he ends up at the house of a weird old man and his too young and beautiful wife. This is where my patience with the film paid off.

Leela Savasta made such an impression on me I immediately want to see the rest of her films' both of them. Heck I want to buy an office block in Vancouver. (She sells Canadian real estate as well as acting and modeling). Yes I turned from bemused viewer to gushing fan boy almost immediately.

So in conclusion movie is decent albeit slow and Savasta will make a man leave his wife and travel a continent and buy a small affordable Canadian strip mall. Or at the very least see that new Black Christmas remake.",1268092800,,1764,4.531446540880503
8125805,3,B000FS2W3K,"A young cocky med student, Ernst Haeckel (Derek Cecil), is obsessed in finding a way of resurrecting the dead and is convinced he is the only one who will find the secret to this enigma. When a necromancer named Montesquino (Jon Polito) arrives proclaiming to have found a way of re-animating the deceased, Heackel is unconvinced even when presented with a live demonstration. One day while on his way to visit his sick father, Haeckel receives an invitation from an old man named Wolfram (Tom McBeath) to spend the night at his house and is introduced to his young and beautiful wife, Elise (Leela Savasta). During this visit, Montesquino visits Wolfram and their exchange is caught by the curious med student who then decides to investigate only to be greeted by a sight that can only be described as zombie erotica.

This enjoyable tale of the undead is beautifully filmed with some gorgeous location shots and period costumes. The scares are few and far between which is somewhat disappointing. As expected from a ""Masters of Horror"" episode, you get the usual gore, a beautiful co-star who strips down to nothing and also following the norm of other episodes this film is devoid of actual terror. There is a sense of dread during earlier scenes. For instance, when our protagonist takes shelter in a cemetery from a storm on his way to see his sick father. But when the film finally exposes the wretched undead, the horror is gone. The final quarter of this film has an unexpected twist and it involves the lovely Elise, her dead husband and several curious undead on lookers but if you are expecting to be spooked in the old school horror kind of way (The Exorcist, Night of the Living Dead) you will be disappointed. Impressive looking zombies stand there delightfully looking at the sexuality on display causing this horror tale to lose its horrific edge even when gore ensues and the final scene is delightful enough for a horror/comedy.

This erotic tale of love and the undead will hold your interest no doubt but it is miles away from being a fright fest. I will state the erotic ""love"" scene was a bit unsettling, mainly due to it being unexpected and you have to admire an actress who is able to pull off such a scene with such pizzazz and despite the lack of scares, ""Haeckel's Tale"" is never boring. Recommended.",1258416000,,2328,4.717444717444717
