6601839,1,B00MU1YE5Y,This was a nice story but the acting was horrible.  I almost turned it off because of that but I paid for it and I was too cheap to stop it.  Can't recommend it because of that.,1416009600,9,177,3.7567567567567566
6601840,5,B00MU1YE5Y,This is a heartfelt Christmas movie that is good to watch with your family.  I enjoyed watching this and thought the cinematography was good.,1415664000,10,141,4.875

6601844,5,B00MU1YE5Y,"This is a great movie, inspired by TRUE events. That being said, as a christian, in the Holy Bible many were called for many different things throughout the Holy Bible and left on short notice. Moses left his family as GOD's chosen to lead God's chosen to the promise land. Noah to build the Ark to save those who would listen and be saved before the flood waters came. And there were others, who are called and disobeyed such as Jonah, and look what happened to him before he Obeyed God. This movie is not cheesy, nor was it boring. I'd have to place it right up there with Touched by an Angel for the acting part. I have never understood why folks who call themselves CHRISTIANS but really are not, start picking at why this or any film they view is bad, doesn't measure up to their beliefs. Folks I go to church but over the years have come to the conclusion that no one denomination is no better that any other. What really matters it What GOD says, not man.  Remember render unto Caesar what is Caesars, and unto God what is God. This film is done very well, and a family oriented film. I have seen some so called Christian films that are laced with vulgar language, one comes to mind entitled ""Flatline"" and produced by Pure Flix. I for the most part love Pure Flix films the have an flare that in a Christian way stand up to the Hollywood model of films. For Christians everywhere this is a great film, and for those who want christian entertainment in their home and you can not obtain it from open airwaves via an aerial antenna or cable/satellite provider, I suggest to buy the movies and build your own DVD library and have a great movie night, and dump TV altogether.",1436918400,9,1679,4.364217252396166

6601853,4,B00MU1YE5Y,"I enjoyed this film. It is understated but involves the development of real people who while they love God have experienced real grief, displacement, upheaval in their lives and as they are seek to go on in their walk with God, while in a new venue. In the process the main character finds himself processing the grief of his wife's passing and is able to reconcile further with his older daughter. The younger daughter appeared a bit plastic and too upbeat, but sometimes innocence appears that way in a jaded world. I was very surprised by the powerful message of the movie, ""Grace, God's grace is for everyone"" and done in such a realistic fashion and that is the core message of His Word, the Bible. Its not just a Christmas feel good movie, but one for everyday of the year.",1420156800,6,779,4.531914893617022
6601854,5,B00MU1YE5Y,I love to watch Christmas movies so add this one to my collection.  It is really wonderful Christian movie.,1419811200,,107,4.631578947368421

6601856,5,B00MU1YE5Y,"This movie was awesome. I enjoyed it very much. When you watch it, it focuses on his full ministry. People who give it one star need to watch it again. The message is very clear. Trust God, be kind, and help one another.",1419724800,,220,4.1395348837209305
6601857,5,B00MU1YE5Y,"Great Christmas movie!!

6601860,5,B00MU1YE5Y,I found this to be a heartwarming story that puts you in the mood for the holidays...,1419552000,,85,4.0588235294117645
6601861,5,B00MU1YE5Y,"This movie shows what it would be like to truly ""Go"" when God tells you to, like Abraham. The pastor did not fear the gangs, because he knew God was with him, and his daughters lives were pretty believable for the age they both were. It was a truly moving faith based movie & we enjoyed it very much.",1419465600,,300,4.101694915254237
6601862,4,B00MU1YE5Y,"Good ""feel happy"" movie. Its nice to know that someone out there is still making movies that don't have bad language, potty humor and general garbage in them.  Good family movie.",1419206400,,178,4.741935483870968
6601863,1,B00MU1YE5Y,"White. Savior. Complex.

Do yourself a favor and google that instead of watching this mindless racist crap thinly veiled as a religious feelgood film.

WWJD? He would have done more research on cultural divide instead of writing a movie that pretty much says that inner city problems would be fixed with more church.",1419206400,,316,4.943396226415095
6601864,1,B00MU1YE5Y,"I am a christian and enjoy movies that are biblically sound and have solid, enjoyable story lines. I don't expect perfection in terms of acting and special effects, escpecially because most ""christian"" films have rather low budgets and I don't expect the theology within a movie to exactly match my own understanding. However, this movie was just plain terrible. No Pastor just up and leaves his church without advanced notice because God suppossedly told him to and then show up at a mission house without even telling the mission leader they are coming. also, the acting was as bad as it gets. Barely made it through 40 minutes before I gave up. Bad storyline, bad acting, and rather boring film (at least the first 40 minutes)",1418860800,4,729,4.7936507936507935
6601865,5,B00MU1YE5Y,loved the movie. I will buy it at a later date.,1418860800,,47,3.3636363636363638
6601866,5,B00MU1YE5Y,"It was a awsome movie. The mission did a lot of work for the people that needed it especially if they didn't have anyplace

6601870,2,B00MU1YE5Y,"This movie was SO lame...I could not make myself watch it more than 10 minutes! Sorry...may have been a good message...but, too LAME to watch for me.",1418515200,,149,4.555555555555555
6601871,5,B00MU1YE5Y,Enjoyed the DVD and shared it with a friend who is doing the same type of work.,1418169600,,79,3.7058823529411766
6601872,3,B00MU1YE5Y,"This isn't a terrible movie, but it really didn't feel much like a Christmas movie. A pastor leaves his church to go to a Church in a poor neighborhood. Whilst there he gets a lot of flack from one of his daughters who didn't like the move and he spends most of the movie trying to help a troubled kid. There is a small portion of the movie where Christmas decorations are hung and at the end of the movie there is a Christmas dinner.",1418083200,2,434,4.117647058823529
6601873,3,B00MU1YE5Y,"The message is right on, however, much was omitted as to make the story more realistic. This really could have been a 5 star movie with a better script. Having worked in missions, this movie touched me as it clearly demonstrated what a difference one person can make when they genuinely walk in compassion, hope and faith. The message is clear, without hope there is nothing on earth worth living for. This movie would actually be a great movie for a youth group or small group to watch and discuss. It clearly is a reflection of Jesus' ministry.",1417996800,7,546,4.581632653061225
6601874,1,B00MU1YE5Y,Do not waste time or money. Bad acting in clich ridden junk.  Took the loss of the rental not being able to take this after 15-20 minutes.  Hard to believe someone actually got paid for making this.,1417564800,3,198,4.324324324324325
6601875,5,B00MU1YE5Y,"It was a great movie about: Love, Patience, and Forgiveness.",1417564800,,60,5.1
6601876,4,B00MU1YE5Y,"When Pastor Noah Davis receives a letter from an old friend asking for prayers to help at the mission he (the friend) has established, Noah feels the call of God and leaves his relatively affluent church to move to the inner city. His daughters have mixed reactions. One seems excited about the prospects, but the other is not at all happy about being uprooted from her life.

At the first service in the new place, Pastor Davis meets an older woman of strong faith but failing health. She is especially concerned about her grandsons, one of whom is a young man who is in danger of being claimed by the streets. When the woman dies, Pastor Davis tries to honor his promise to the woman to look after the two boys. But he faces obstacles, including a gang and child protective services (looking into the safety of life at the mission for both the two boys and Pastor Davis's daughters).

As I write this, all of the reviews are either five-star or one-star reviews. The one-star reviews tend to focus on the acting. It is true that the acting isn't great, especially at first, and there are times when the cast is hindered by script (and, apparently, by direction). For example, the younger daughter, who appears to be in her early teens, goes into a store with one of the boys and is convinced to steal candy. When she gets home, she boasts to her father that she stole the candy. Really? A young teen daughter of a pastor does not know that stealing is wrong? I simply cannot believe for an instant that she would not have heard of the Ten Commandments.

There are other flaws in the film. In fact, there are many. I'm not too fond of the fact that the only Asian in the film is the Vietnamese woman who owns the liquor market, for example. Some scenes are forced or, worse, contrived. This film is, in short, imperfect.

But its heart is in the right place. And ultimately, it does what Christmas movies tend to do--lead up to a Christmas Eve ending in which almost everything is resolved. And by the end, the pieces seem to fit together without seeming absurdly contrived. So in the end, I thought the film had a certain charm. It just needed a rewrite, a little more rehearsal, and tighter direction.

I don't recall any swearing. There's no nudity. And the violence is threatened or diminished. (There is an attempted carjacking at knife-point, but there's no on- or off-screen violence in it, and one character is shocked by electricity and says he's being electrocuted, but he's clearly not. There is the implicit threat of violence against the pastor by gang members, but they don't spell out anything.)",1417478400,3,2611,4.582441113490364
6601877,1,B00MU1YE5Y,"Even at $13 this one is not worth it. Very poor acting and writing. Very slow and boring. I just could not work up any interest in the characters and the story. I'm sure it ends happily, they all do, (Christmas stories, that is) but I could not make it further than about half way through. I was watching with my wife and she agreed so off it went.",1417478400,2,348,4.057971014492754

8674587,1,B00MU1YE5Y,This film is terrible.  The script fails the actors.  The plot threads are left hanging (This was going to be a tv-series) The most offensive thing is that every black character is a bad influence on the white children in the film.  Insulting!  THis could of been great,1462924800,,269,4.541666666666667
8674588,3,B00MU1YE5Y,"I gave this one three stars... mostly because it 'meant well'.  The acting was stilted-- really bad.  And some scenes were extremely difficult to believe.  Example:  Preacher's teenage daughter (not the adopted one)  goes on a shoplifting spree with her little friend from the neighborhood... brings the 'loot' home in a bag... and almost eagerly admits to stealing it.  In thirteen or more years, with a preacher as a father... she had never learned that stealing is wrong?
Geeze!  -- Also that daughter was giddy in every scene, whereas the adopted daughter went from difficult to happy to angry to excited to rebellious.. almost as often as the scenes changed. -- The best actress in the entire movie was the old lady who croaked.",1451952000,,733,4.862903225806452
