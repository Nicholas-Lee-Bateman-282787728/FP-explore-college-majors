8228587,1,B000XJD3FW,This aggravates me. I bought this because the set I had had episode 99 in place of episodes 100-103. So 4 episodes are the exact same. So I bought this hoping it was just the one I had bought so long ago. But after getting this one and it doing the same thing I'm so done! So I've resorted to using the funamation app! I'm tired of these crap DVDs!,1465516800,,348,3.9857142857142858

8228589,5,B000XJD3FW,"I like the show, but this DVD set has an issue.  You can't watch a choice of an episode.  You can either watch the first episode many many times, or you can watch all of them in ONE sitting.  You can't skip to other episodes or choose them from the menu.  I don't get it...",1436400000,,273,3.909090909090909

YuYu Hakusho
Ruroni Kenshin

8228595,5,B000XJD3FW,"In Yu Yu Hakusho: Eight Finalists you will recieve the final fourteen episodes of the series on two DVDs. Specifically, these are episodes 99 upto and including 112 and they all take place during the show's final saga, The Saga of the Three Kings. Needless to say, the following review may have some spoilers, so if you haven't seen the first 98 episodes of the series, STOP READING!

Yusuke, Kurama, and Hiei have all returned to the Demon World to meet with one of the three kings. While they each meet a different king, they will all have to make a choice in the upcoming fight over the balance of power caused by Raizen, Yusuke's ancestor's, upcomming death. Before then however, Yusuke must grow stronger and learn from Raizen about his past, and the workings of Demon World. Both Kurama and Hiei must also face demons from their pasts both internally and externally. The first five episodes of the volume do this job farely well, then Raizen dies and Yusuke must find a way to keep the Demon World from plummeting into chaos.

How might Yusuke accomplish this? Why, with a Demon Tournament of course! Whoever wins will rule the Demon World as king until the next Tournament in a few years. Even some old foes turned friends from the Dark Tournament show up to fight such as Chu, Jin, and Suzuka. While all want to win, almost everyone can agree that they want a piece of Yusuke! The battles are intense and entertaining to watch as Yusuke, Kurama, and Hiei must learn to come to terms with who they truly are. As Yusuke stares down Yomi in a climactic clash, who will win? Who will become king?

With the fate of Demon World decided we can fast forward to the final episode in our story and say hello to High Schooler Kazuma Kuwabara. On his way to a reunion at Genkai's, Kuwabara meets Kurama and learns about Hiei's choice to stay in Demon World. When the two arrive they meet Kayko, Shizuru, and the rest of their friends, but where is Yusuke? What does the future hold for our heroes? As the sun sets, the series goes out with a bang...

Well, the end of Yu Yu Hakusho doesn't disappoint. While the Three Kings Saga is in my opinion the weakest of the four, it is still very entertaining and enjoyable to watch. My only major complaint with it is the lack of Kuwabara, as he only appears in this sets final episode. Still, if you're reading this review, chances are you've already purchased the first 98 episodes, so why not finish the series? You shouldn't be dissapointed. Like all of these sets, the extras are nearly non existent, but the episodes themselves for only $30 are more than worth buying this.

So, what is left to say about Yu Yu Hakusho? When it began, our hero Yusuke Urameshi was a school skipping delinquent who thought no one cared about him in the entire world. However, his character slowly matures through battles to regain his life, meeting new friends and new foes, and most notably fighting with terrible opponents such as the Toguro Brothers and Shinobu Sensui and learning of his ancestor, Raizen. This show is in my opinion a brilliantly done anime with both hilarious and extremely emotional scenes, and of course...incredible  battles! Farewell to thee Yu Yu Hakusho, and thanks for a wonderful journey!",1198108800,7,3245,4.6152512998266895
