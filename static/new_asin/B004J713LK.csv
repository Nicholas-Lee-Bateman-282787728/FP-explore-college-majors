4390604,4,B004J713LK,"My young baseball fans (7 & 4 yr old boys) love this dvd. They laugh out loud and provide a live instant replays by acting out some of the bloopers. They don't seem to mind that (from what I've actually watched) it was clearly put together 20 years ago or more. It's not going to win any awards for brilliant film making, but if you have goofy young baseball fans, I would recommend it.",1367107200,3,386,4.22972972972973
4390605,1,B004J713LK,"This budget-priced doublebill of baseball's wacky side isn't especially deep, but it's a fun, sometimes uneven little diversion. Skip It.",1359158400,,137,5.9

4390607,2,B004J713LK,A lot of repeat bloopers from previous videos.  To much talking and interviews from not very interesting players.  Very disappointed.,1335225600,10,133,5.6

8431725,3,B004J713LK,Disappointed that so much of the first DVD was again on this one. Expected it to have more new clips.,1455926400,,101,4.1
8431726,4,B004J713LK,My 8 year old son who played two seasons of baseball last year loved this.  He opened it on Christmas even and watched it several times.  He's also shown it to some of his baseball buddies to rave reviews.  It is fun watching it with him and answering his questions about now retired players.,1452556800,,292,4.37037037037037

8431732,5,B004J713LK,"We are huge baseball fans in my house, so this was a must have. My son laughed so hard he was crying at some of the bloopers. It is a great compilation of bloopers over the years and very funny!",1389052800,,194,3.875
8431733,5,B004J713LK,"Absolutely love baseball bloopers. There are a lot that are the same as the MLB All-Time Bloopers, but there are new ones as well. And then you can also go on YouTube and watch the ESPN NOT Top 10 list, which is a list of sports bloopers. You are guaranteed to find at least one baseball. There is Mark Sanchez's infamous butt fumble, and the Astros runner trying to force a single into a double and slid his face right into Reds 2B Phillips. There is also the Braves playing the Diamondbacks in Arizona, Teheran on the mound going after the ball and missing, Freeman crossing into him and missing and Uggla diving and falling and missing the ball. Teheran eventually retrieved the ball, but not before the runner made it into a double.",1385078400,,736,4.5
