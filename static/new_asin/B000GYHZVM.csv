2620633,3,B000GYHZVM,This item was sold to me in the USA and I live in the USA yet t he DVD cannot be played on my DVD players with a ddUK region code. Took days to get info on how to change region codes. Frustrating. I should have clearly been made aware  of this fact. Dissapointing.,1370995200,,264,3.888888888888889
2620634,5,B000GYHZVM,"Those who enjoy ghostly mysteries will appreciate this series, set in the haunted seaside city of Bristol, U.K. Please note that you'll need a Region-free DVD player to view. I don't understand why ""Afterlife"" is not better known, considering the quality of the actors, stories, and care with the sets. In Series 1, we meet the tattered and battered by life Alison Mundy (Lesley Sharp), washed-up in Bristol. Allison is a survivor of a horrific train crash, with scars on the inside and out, who sees apparitions of her fellow travelers. She must come to terms with her psychic sensitivity, living with one foot in this world, the other the cold side of the grave. When Alison walks the hilly streets of Bristol, she is often unsure if the people she sees are really alive, or if they are restless spirits. Alison's narrow town-home is an artifact, marking her oddness, out of step with time, stuck in a previous period; 1970's avocado green looms in patterned wallpaper that is beyond retro, its dank hideousness dominates; vinyl records are stacked on the floor; even her phone is old-fashioned. Lesley Sharp, as Alison Mundy, plays the character impeccably, with such depth and conviction, that she makes even the less credible stories more palatable and believable; she is a remarkable actress. Alison confronts professor Robert Bridge (Andrew Lincoln), a psychology lecturer grieving the loss of his young son Josh. Robert feels responsible for his son's death, since he was driving the car in the accident that killed Josh three years ago. His marriage subsequently collapsed, and his wife has moved on with her own life. Robert is a complete skeptic about psychic mediums like Alison, but she is no fraud. His interactions with Alison constantly challenge his assumptions, but she must face him, since his son is one of her perpetual haunts. Josh's lost spirit keeps trying to make contact with his unwilling father. Alison must also cope with the damage to her body and spirit from the train wreck, and face her fear of fellow survivors who, like her, carry a burden of grief and guilt. Phyllida Law adds depth as a woman widowed by the crash, who organizes a seance in a scary old house, enlisting Alison against Robert's advice, in the magnificent closure of Series 1, with ""The 7:59 Club."" The painful journeys of the train crash survivors ultimately defy gloom with transcendence. But the consequences are dire for Alison.

Series 2 drops this interesting story-line, with Alison as the train crash survivor, and unfortunately suffers from new writers who inflict typical TV-grade cliches, making Alison even more maladjusted than before, not just a  psychic medium, but a real nutter. Viewers are inflicted with her new, annoying OCD and other irritating quirks, like head-on-wall banging. Despite an unsavory environ, all the sorting of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smarties/dp/B009WEBX60/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smarties</a>&nbsp;can induce hunger in viewers, as these U.K. candies are like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/M-Ms/dp/B000TV8NR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">M&Ms</a>, but with a great vanilla-flavoured sugar crust. Not until Alison resolves her issues with her father, and freakish dead mother, does she begin to seem less afflicted with hysteria. The whole story-line with Alison and her mother-issues is done with too heavy a hand, scrawling ""End of the Series"" on the wall. But the last two episodes, ""Things Forgotten"" and ""A Name Written In Water,"" are excellent, weaving together Robert's life-story with his grief over Josh, coming full-circle in a powerful and profound way.

The topics and stories of ""Afterlife"" exclude jolly cheerfulness; the spirits that contact Alison are troubled, damaged souls with terrible, violent ends and unresolved issues. Some of these spirits even have deadly agendas towards the living. Overall, this is an interesting, experimental series that deserves a wider audience. Just don't watch this by yourself, if you're easily spooked!",1364860800,5,4092,5.481774960380348
2620635,5,B000GYHZVM,"Didn't know what to expect. The script is good, two episodes were a little hard to balance (nursing home, mental ward, things maybe different in Europe with regards to access to facilities). The acting is well done as is the storyline. Audio is 2.1 not a major loss. Another enjoyable British show.",1356134400,,298,4.75
2620636,5,B000GYHZVM,What a great show! I accidentally started watching it on the Chiller channel in the US and was instantly hooked.  Then they stopped showing it. I went online in search of the series and was able to watch season 1 & 2.  Wish I can get the DVD's butit's only on non-US format.  I'm very disappointed in that but if you get you won't be disappointed on the series!,1329177600,,361,4.202898550724638
2620637,2,B000GYHZVM,"British horror series about a skeptical male professor researching a book on an unbalanced female psychic who tries to help a variety of people who are being haunted by ghosts, sometimes without success.  The set-up is like a much darker Medium where the ghosts are frequently malicious and sometimes impossible to stop.  This sounds like a great show.  It certainly could have been excellent, but it boasts the two most unlikable lead characters I've ever seen in a television program and watching them bicker or watching the middle aged female psychic throw one of her many emotional tantrums is more torture than entertainment.  Some of the stories themselves are quite creepy but the banter between the psychic and academic is so poorly written and played that it pretty much ruins every episode.  If you can tolerate the lead characters you will undoubtedly like this much more than I did.",1321228800,,894,4.973154362416107
2620638,5,B000GYHZVM,"i love this show i wish it would of lasted more than 2 seasons.
i love alison (the medium) and robert (the psychiatrist) they couldn't of picked better actors for this they worked really well together.

this is a great supernatural tv series about a woman (alison) that can communicate with the dead, and a psychiatrist (robert) that wants to write a book about alison and is not sure weather or not alison is the real deal.

if you like ghost storys, you will love this series, i still think about the last episode and how it made me cry.",1304640000,,539,4.38
2620639,5,B000GYHZVM,I wish this would come out in a Region 1 version.  I just finished watching the first season (for the first time) on the Chiller network.  I hope they will play the second season soon.  The first season was excellent -- so much better than any other ghost-related drama we have on the air here.  Heart wrenching is right!,1276992000,4,321,4.389830508474576
2620640,5,B000GYHZVM,"This is an excellent series!! This just has to come out in USA format. I would purchase this with no questions asked. I can`t believe it didn`t last as a series any longer than it did. Oh well....as the saying goes, the good die young!",1274745600,6,235,4.2444444444444445
2620641,5,B000GYHZVM,This was simply a wonderful tv series and I wish it would have gone another season at least.  The interaction between Allison (the medium) and Robert (the psychiatrist) was excellent as well as the other characters throughout the show.  I'm hoping this comes out in region 1 format very soon so I can see the show again.,1196467200,7,320,4.5964912280701755
8135094,5,B000GYHZVM,"This series is very well done. It analyses a relationship between a medium and the skeptical psychologist doing a study on her. When the relationship brings appearances from his old family members, his supervisor and his ex-wife begin to worry about him. The result is a talented blend of darkness and light. May be too intense for young people and too mild for horror aficionados.",1492905600,,381,4.876923076923077
8135095,5,B000GYHZVM,"I watched this show on TV many years ago and was hooked right from the start!  The chemistry between Andrew Lincoln and Lesley Sharp is incredible and believable.  Both brillant actors and even where it's set is quite creepy :-)

I was disappointed they ended it after only two seasons but the seasons they gave us were great :-)

So glad I now have them to keep (and actually play in Region 4!) whenever I like :-)",1488931200,,415,4.35064935064935
8135096,5,B000GYHZVM,"I have loved Lesley Sharp ever since she played the victim's mom in ""Priest"".  WHAT AN ACTRESS!!!  Why isn't she better known in the U.S.??  ""Afterlife"" is an incredible British series, unfortunately short lived.  A wonderful show that keeps you guessing all the way through each episode.  There are some slow moments between the two main characters involving their personal/professional relationship, but beyond that, the pace never slows.  How I wish this show had continued!!!!  Great performances!!  Great writing!!!  BUY THIS!!!",1476316800,,533,5.481481481481482
