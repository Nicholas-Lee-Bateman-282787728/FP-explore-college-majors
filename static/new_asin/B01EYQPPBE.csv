7741434,5,B01EYQPPBE,I loved this comedy.  Very smart and witty.  It made me want read Shakespeare's works.  I hope there will be another season.  The characters are great.,1519516800,,151,4.6923076923076925
7741435,5,B01EYQPPBE,"Excellent, clever, comedy.  Very contemporary even though it is set in the 1600s.",1518393600,,81,5.230769230769231
7741436,5,B01EYQPPBE,"It's amazing that this show features the same actress, Gemma Whelan, who also plays Yara Greyjoy on Game of Thrones. She, David Mitchell, and the other actors are hilarious as they perform send-ups of Shakespeare plays with some social commentary about the present day.

I guess the reason I am writing this was my utter shock at the realization that this comedienne who had me laughing out loud was the same actress who so perfectly plays a physically aggressive, take-no-prisoners pirate queen.",1518307200,,496,5.048780487804878
7741437,5,B01EYQPPBE,"We loved this program ! It's really witty and smart, and we appreciated most of the humor, even when we didn't always have enough knowledge of Shakespeare to appreciate all-of-it It's extremely rare that we consider watching something a second time, but YES !",1516924800,2,259,4.909090909090909
7741438,5,B01EYQPPBE,"David Mitchell is my hero, so there is no way I can give an unbiased look into this project. I love his as the bard, and since I also love Shakespeare, found the series delightful and raucous.",1516665600,,192,4.216216216216216

7741440,5,B01EYQPPBE,"If you loved Blackadder, you will love this.  Not surprising since it's Ben Elton's!

Begun last year as part of the commemorations of the 400th anniversary of Shakrespeare's death, David Mitchell is perfect as Will Shakespeare, up-and-coming playwright battling snobbery and social mores to stage his work in London society.  His supporting cast is funny as well as informative.  I wish there were more than six episodes a season, but that's part of its charm.  I wonder how long it will run?",1514592000,2,493,4.963414634146342
7741441,5,B01EYQPPBE,"Those familiar with the first series of Ben Eltons Upstart Crow will need no persuading of the merits of the second season.

The scripts are very funny and offer a broad range of humour, ranging from Harry Enfield, as Shakespeares father, sitting on the toilet, to David Mitchell, as Shakespeare, trying to claim personal credit for any telling phrase or image.

Comparisons with Blackadder are inevitable given Eltons co-writing credits for series 2-4; the historical setting; and shared devices such as cross-dressing.

As with Blackadder the comedy is character driven, with a strong (but not as strong) ensemble cast (which includes Liza Tarbuck and Mark Heap) and much of the humour revolves around pointing to parallels with the present (such as references to dodgy financial dealing or the running gag about the horrors of poor transport) or dissimilarities (such as how The Taming of the Shrew is now subject to a feminist reading).

Ben Elton has done his homework and in between laughing its possible to pick up a lot of information about Shakespeare, his works and his times (although the series plays fast and loose with the actual chronology, with the first episode of this series focusing upon Othello, first performed 1604, and the last concerned with Romeo and Juliet, first performed in the previous decade.

Early in his career as an alternative comedian Elton made headlines by attacking Benny Hill. In Upstart Crow his target is now Ricky Gervais, as portrayed by Spencer Jones as William Kempe (me laughing, very loudly and intrusively at something that nobody else finds funny  thats the mark of a comic genius). Other targets include Benedict Cumberbatch, or at least weird-looking old Etonian actors with a rather pretentious name.

At least Elton, who wrote the book for We Will Rock You and Tonights the Night is willing to engage in a degree of self-parody (First, I invent the original stage musical, and then instantly make it obsolete by inventing the greatest hits musical).

In short, the second series of Upstart Crow is always amusing and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, especially when Elton curbs his tendency to write with venom in favour of warmth and wit.",1508716800,3,2194,5.058171745152355
8759795,1,B01EYQPPBE,Unplayable!  Most US players will not. Returned.,1535414400,,48,5.857142857142857
8759796,5,B01EYQPPBE,"Just as funny as the First Series.  Unfortunately, the Christmas Special is not on either DVD.  It's a UK video so one requires a region-free DVD player to watch it but these are relatively inexpensive.",1534464000,,202,4.742857142857143
8759797,5,B01EYQPPBE,"This sounds like but it s not meant to be a supercilious remark.  If you are not educated in past history or recent history and Shakespeare, you will not get this.  Very brave of the BBC to finance and thank God we still have them.",1533686400,,231,4.111111111111111
8759798,5,B01EYQPPBE,"I received this earlier than the projected date, and was so excited to watch it!  I went to my Mom's to play it and it won't play because it's only for Region B/2. I tried on my DVD player and got the same message.  What a bummer!",1533686400,,230,3.872340425531915
8759799,5,B01EYQPPBE,I saw this series on PBS. Loved it. Why can't we get this DVD for region 1?  I'd buy it in a heartbeat.,1532822400,,103,3.4782608695652173
8759800,5,B01EYQPPBE,So funny! If you even have a tad better than passing education on Shakespeare youll get most of the jokes. Experts will get even more. Worth watching.,1528329600,,150,4.592592592592593
8759801,5,B01EYQPPBE,Hilarious.  Edgy.  Watch it.,1523836800,,28,5.75
8759802,5,B01EYQPPBE,I love this show. It's truly funny.,1522713600,,35,4.142857142857143
8759803,5,B01EYQPPBE,"This is pretty epic.  Guest spots are amazing.  Noel Fielding steals the episode he's in doing a great Mick Jagger.  The supporting cast are phenomenal.  I don't dislike anything about this, except the opening song is slightly annoying.",1522195200,,236,5.131578947368421
8759804,5,B01EYQPPBE,See review to Season 1. Still a bit sad about them toning down the opening and closing theme. You can definitely hear the difference. :(,1521331200,,136,4.48
