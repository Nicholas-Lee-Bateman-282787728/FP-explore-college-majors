Now, I must say that although this product is intended to provide ""Comfort For Dogs,"" ours didn't even feign interest in the tape despite our efforts to engage him.  But we were enchanted entirely, and this wordless footage of dogs of all shapes and sizes--combined with gentle music--always makes us smile.  We even made guests watch it sometimes!

I highly recommend this dear video.  Watch out for the Jack Russell puppies and the big ol' Bulldog on the porch swing!",1150416000,2,723,4.6171875
8149170,5,B000063CEM,"Surprising, it was more than that.  The Video Photography is excellent along with the soothing music.  The Labrador puppy segment is our favorite!  Penny (our dog) and the kids enjoy watching/listening to this video for hours!  This is a perfect video for any dog lover.",1025049600,2,270,4.933333333333334
