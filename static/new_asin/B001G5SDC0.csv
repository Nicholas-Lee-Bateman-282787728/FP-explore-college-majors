8303915,5,B001G5SDC0,"This is a silly movie about romance. Personally I love it, whenever I get in a cheesy romantic comedy mood, I pop this in. I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies, but this movie is just so silly and whimsical you can't help but appreciate the stupidity and melodrama of the thing. The movie is very well balanced of silly and semi-serious. This movie isn't for everyone, but it definitely has an audience! 5 stars for tons of fun. Well worth investing in if you are into romantic comedies or whimsical foreign films.",1306713600,,516,4.5
8303916,1,B001G5SDC0,"the story and the movie script look like were written during a tea break session.

i take it back, maybe it was written during two tea break sessions.

there is no story, no plot.  it can make a 13 year old more puzzled about love, but that's it.",1267056000,,246,4.083333333333333
