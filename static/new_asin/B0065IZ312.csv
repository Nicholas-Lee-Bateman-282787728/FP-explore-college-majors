8493409,5,B0065IZ312,"Why is it that European films with child actors are so much better than their American counterparts?  Maybe because child actors in Europe are just so natural in their acting rolls. Films like this one as well as Tinke (from Denmark), The Girl (from Sweden) and Alice in the Cities(from Germany) are films that no American kid actor could ever hope to act in because they're to self centered and hammy. Just compare the original Let the Right One In from Sweden to the terrible Let Me In from America and you will see what I mean. The kid actors in this wonderful little film from Norway are so likable and it is just a cute story of a 10 year old girl's obsession with a new boy in her neighborhood and the rivalry for the boy's attention with a pretty blonde girl in the same class. I'm not going to go into detail of the film's story but I'm sure both adults as well as children will enjoy this cute little film. Unfortunately this film on DVD is in the PAL format and will only play on multi-region Blu-Ray/DVD players in the USA. I'm really glad that I myself bought one so I can enjoy wonderful films like this.",1434153600,,1117,4.319047619047619
8493410,4,B0065IZ312,It has been many months since I watched this film. IMDB can fill you in on the plot. The quality of the disc was flawless. The colors were bright. The characters did not seem like actors. It was as if I was eavesdropping over their shoulders to see their life unfold before them. The friendships seemed genuine and the heartache real. Kids are kids no matter their nationality. The story is universal. I saw glimpses of my own childhood in the story as well. The children were great actors. The cinematography was well done.,1392508800,,524,4.585106382978723
8493411,5,B0065IZ312,"A great and very entertaining movie about character, peer competition, and growing up.  The cast's performance is so believable you feel the emotions of the story, which exposes all the elements of tween-age existance: moral choices, sibling conflict, peer pressure, friendship, and of course, first romance.  Glad I bought it!",1349395200,2,327,5.52
