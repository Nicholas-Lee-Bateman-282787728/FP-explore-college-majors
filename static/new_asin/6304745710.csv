7876818,4,6304745710,"i just saw this movie.i live in the uk,and seeing as im a big fan of Maia campbells i thought i may as well buy this movie until Trippin becomes a reasonable price (see elsewhere on amazon). the reason why i say this movie is kinda cool in a strange way is because this movie is well.....strange!.  firstly,it looks like it was shot on a budget of around $80,000.secondly  the plot is totally bizzare.thirdly the characters are all pretty damn  weird,with the slight exception of Maias character. in a nut shell this is  one of the most obscure films ive EVER seen,and proberly one of the most  obscure films ever made. But,i like it,i like it alot.....why?. Because it  is so nutty.so often now days movies are conventional,but kin folks is  anything but.if Steve martin had made this movie it would of been a  classic,totally off the wall,al la the jerk,if your looking for somthing  toatally differnt to the norm thaen this movie is for you. the high  light of the film has to be when the father discovers his sons girlfreind  is really a man.although seeing Maia having sex in the first scene comes  pretty darn close.
p.s. dispite the fact that i live in the uk,i recived  this movie just 11 days after ordering!",952300800,3,1217,4.578703703703703
