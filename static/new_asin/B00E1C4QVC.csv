5883151,5,B00E1C4QVC,"This is a good, though in general, a lightweight  programme of Ashton Ballets. Most of these works have been filmed in earlier years, the most lamentable lack of transfer to DVD still being the performances by Fonteyn and Nureyev in ""Marguerite and Armand"" and Sibley and Dowell in the ""Meditation From Thais"". It must be said, however, that here the principals in Marguerite and Armand (Roje and Polunin) are excellent, though one cannot but still long for a DVD featuring the original couple for whom the ballet was created. Apart from this I am overjoyed to now have a recording of Ashton's ""Monotones I and II"" for which I have waited years, never believing that it would be recorded and here beautifully danced, especially the Monotones II (Nunez, Kish and Watson).  Also a joyous inclusion is the pas de deux ""Voices of Spring"" which I had never previously seen. It is danced ravishingly by Yuhui Choe and Alexander Campbell. It is always good to have additional works by Ashton to watch and study. Like Balanchine in America he was one of the founding architects of a company which today is considered most important. Also, like Balanchine, he has not been favoured as he might have been by DVD.

5883153,5,B00E1C4QVC,"Watching Tamara Rojo's Marguerite and Armand (with Sergei Polunin) is in itself worth the price of this DVD.  That piece was originally choreographed on Margot Fonteyn, and Ms. Rojo's searing performance paid proper homage to that legendary ballerina.  As well, the DVD contained a most heartfelt curtain call (with a festive ""flower throw""), marking Ms. Rojo's final performance with the Royal Ballet where she was a principal dancer for a decade.  The other pieces on the DVD comprehensively expose viewers to the diversity of Ashton's choreography, ranging from the fluidity of La Valse to the stillness of Monotones I and II.  The few bobbles, especially noticeable in Monotones, did not unduly mar the overall quality of the dancing.",1386806400,,738,5.228813559322034
5883154,4,B00E1C4QVC,"A couple of the pas de deux are on other dVD selections, but with different dancers.  Comparisons are always fun and we all have our favorites.  I don't like Ashton's version of La Valse as much as Balanchine's, but that's very subjective.  Monotones was new to me and I really enjoyed it.  The performance of Marguerite and Armand was very touching.  I don't believe I've ever seen the full ballet before, but knowing the history of it being one of the last pieces choreographed for Fonteyn and Nureyev, you can almost picture them as you watch.  This was Tamara Rojos farewell perfomance with the Royal Ballet and, for that reason alone, is one you'll want to have.  The emotion she brings to Marguerite is deep and heartfelt.  The appreciation of the audience at the close is palpable.",1385683200,7,788,4.700729927007299
5883155,5,B00E1C4QVC,"Sir Frederick Ashton was the greatest choreographer of the 20th Century because of his ability to create ballets sad, funny and plotless with great fidelity to the emotional impact of the music.  If ever there was such a thing as a perfect ballet, it has to be Monotones II.  The other works are wonderful, but Monotones II is reason enough to buy this dvd.",1385251200,2,357,4.5625
5883156,5,B00E1C4QVC,"This disc, recorded in 2013, is a fascinating selection of Ashton's work and illustrates very clearly what an influence he had in the creation of a British ballet concept. If the intention was to showcase a number of short self-contained ballets to demonstrate his range and versatility primarily through the combined talents of members of the current ballet company, it is has been a success.

The 15 minutes of brief interviews and comments on each of the features ballets and Frederick Ashton's legacy to British ballet make for an interesting snapshot summary. The points that come over most strongly and consistently are Ashton's focus on graceful action achieved through action above the legs. In other words he required dancers to use the whole body and not just focus on feet and legs. This had the effect of favouring shorter dancers in contrast to Ballanchine's leg focus which favoured taller dancers for example. The other point that was repeatedly made by all the interviewed dancers was that this made it more demanding and physically tiring than choreography devised by others. They all felt that it was also very fulfilling and rewarding as an experience.

The five featured short ballets make a satisfying program and nicely illustrate all these points. The disc opens with La Valse which is really the only ballet featured for the corps de ballet plus groups. Ravel's original idea for this music was to illustrate the increasing degeneration of the modern world and its eventual collapse. This is quite clearly portrayed in his music. Ashton's setting goes some way towards this conclusion without the finale being as extreme. There is emphasis, as always, on beautiful costuming and movement with artistic balance being maintained at all times even as it speeds up remorselessly. Closing the curtain at the same time as the music ends is the stage equivalent to a fade -out device on a pop record as it avoids the true ending as Ravel intended.

The following Meditation is a lovely example of poised beauty and line held seamlessly throughout by Leanne Benjamin and Vasko Vassilev. All the Ashton characteristics as described above are to the fore throughout. That is also true of the two Monotone ballets featuring two trios of dancers who have to work independently to achieve group unity. This is a very demanding requirement and is wonderfully done by Emma Maguire, Akane Takada., David Trzensimiech, Nehemiah Kish, Edward Watson and Marianela Nunez.

Voices of Spring is a delightful piece of highly artistic 'fluff' not surprisingly popular with young dancers especially. As mentioned in the interview, they then quickly discover its enormous challenges. These include the requirement of great strength and stamina for the numerous lifts from the male dancer, Alexander Campbell on this occasion, and artless femininity from the female dancer, on this disc apparently effortlessly achieved by Yuhui Choe.

The evening probably belonged to Tamaro Rojo though with her swan song as Marguerite, Traviata-like, doomed in her love with Armand, danced by Sergei Polunin. These two magically suspended disbelief throughout their tragic story and not a sound could be detected from a packed audience as the inevitable end approached. The increasingly ecstatic applause that erupted and constant rain of flowers that continued beyond the playing time of the disc did not hide the emotionally taxing effect on Rojo of, first the story, and then her own final curtain call. Carlos Accosta was also there to join in the applause on stage.

This disc therefore is largely a celebratory event. It celebrates Sir Frederick Ashton, his influence on the Royal Ballet and also includes a celebratory final role for Tamara Rojo. The chosen program is effective in these ways even if not everyone's first choice either of ballets or particular dancers. It is still a memorable disc.

The camera work displays both full stage and detailed shots that are sympathetic to Ashton's concepts. The orchestra is on top form under Emmanuel Plasson and one must also mention the fine piano playing of Robert Clark. The imaging is crisp and provides fabulously subtle colour range and the sound is presented in excellent DTD 5.0 as well as sa stereo option. The extras are as described in paragraph two.

I would suggest that this disc is likely to provide a great deal of enjoyment and satisfaction to admirers of Ashton, the Royal Ballet and its dancers including the ones highlighted in the course of this review which is based on the Blu-ray version in surround mode.

8599969,5,B00E1C4QVC,"Interestingly enough Frederick Ashton, one of the most influential choreographers of the 20th century, was born in 1904, the same year as the other most influential 20th century choreographer, George Balanchine. Ashton in Guayaquil, Ecuador and Balanchine in St. Petersburg, Russia. At 13 Ashton saw A. Pavlova dance in Lima, Peru and thereafter determined to be a ballet dancer in spite of parental objections. He studied with Massine in London and had a flourishing career as a dancer in several companies. He was encouraged to develop his choreographic abilities by M. Rambert one of the co-founders (with A. de Valois) of what would become the Royal Ballet; a transition of the old Vic-Wells, to Sadlers-Wells to Covent Garden and finally to the Royal Ballet.
His Pre-War ballets were primarily subject stories of the conflict of good and evil e.g. Baiser de la Fee, Patineurs, Wedding Bouquet and Horoscope. He served in the RAF fro 1941 to 1945. The post war years saw Ashton on a campaign to emphasize the supremacy of classic dance as as stated by the post war school ""to put grace before anything in a woman dancer."" Thus whereas Balachine emphasized  extending and twisting the classic steps to accomplish beauty from the knee down thus favoring the tall, long limbed ballerina (and married a few). Ashton on the other hand demanded that the whole body define ""grace""; limbs, arms, neck, hands, fingers. In particular that tilt of head and shoulder of the ballerina (epaulement). His ladies were smaller; ""petite"" rather than statuesque.
One of the greatest stars of his association with the Royal Ballet was Margot Fonteyn (5'4''). He created works for her for the next 25 years; acknowledged in this collection with Marguerite and Armand (music Liszt B minor Piano Sonata) from 1963. To me, this is one of the most endearing pieces of ballet ever created, (I've only seen a pirate black and white of Fonteyn and Nureyev) and it was certainly well serviced on this disc and it served well as the final vehicle for the magnificent Tamara Rojo. She is one of the most beautiful and talented ballerinas I've seen anywhere. She is limber to a fault and seems to float on air. Yes, as many times as I've watched this final farewell to the RB by her on this disc, I still get a tear during the cascade of flowers at her final curtain.
Ashton in 1965 and 1966 created two - movement only - ballets called Monotone I and Monotone II set to music of Eric Satie (orchestration Ravel). These are excursions into pure classicism  as was  his early beautiful Symphonic Variations (1946) to music of Cesar Frank. Monotone I and II are included in the disc and Monotone II is exquisite.
Also included on this disc is an all time favorite, La Valse (music Ravel) with its fearsome, frenetic whirl-away. It had been choreographed by Najinska, Fokine and Balanchine. Then again in 1935 by Ashton as two works and then as one in 1947. It is captivating and certainly taxes the corps. As always in his works he demands the lines of the dancers bodies, legs, arms, etc. to be ""graceful"". The section included in this disc is as mesmerizing  as any I've seen and I play it over and over.
Ashton retired from the directorship of the  Royal Ballet in 1970 (died 1988) but still did some choreographic work and even danced in his ""Tales of Beatrix Potter"". Also from this last period is another small gem of choreographic art: Meditation from ""Thais"". This wondrous ballet was done for Sibley and Dowell in 1971. It is included here superbly done by Benjamin and Hirstov. It has an opiate haze about it like it's predecessor ""Bayadere"".
For any lover of Ballet, this is a disc to cherish. It reminds me of the great era of dance that I witnessed in my many travels in the 60's, 70's and 80's and all those wonderful memories. These started in the early 1950's with Margot Fonteyn in Swan Lake at Detroit Masonic when I watched her arms.",1396483200,4,3922,4.728070175438597
