7970697,5,B00006JU89,"An impressive film for its gritty realism and the fact that a low-budget independent (but passionate) film maker put it together.  If you like the rawness
of the old neighborhoods...the low socio-economics....the good, bad and ugly, so to speak, this may well be a film to see.  I know that I did not regret
the experience.",1430265600,,323,4.75

7970699,1,B00006JU89,"UNDER HELLGATE BRIDGE (2000), has only two redeeming artistic values,
the first, is the professional, theatre-grade wide-screen,
cinematographical quality and the other one, is the presence and
charisma of a few cast members, above all Jonathan LaPaglia playing
Vincent (a bit of a more robust Bobby de Niro or William Baldwin),
Michael Rodrick as the best of 3 junkie brothers, and Vincent
Pastore playing a muscle man in Frank Vincent's crew, going by the
monicker Big Sal.

It's a mystery why those big name actors associated themselves with a
work that is a non-stop, introverted obsession on the junkie
lifestyle, as a one-trick pony.

The rest of the picture is a let-down, for the simple reason, that
the psychological climate is unstructured, chaotic, confused,
immature, similar to that found in the old JD Salinger novel, ""The
Catcher in the Rye"". Indeed, several characters take satisfaction in
their own self-pity and perpetuating it over the entire picture.

The audience will forgive the author of the script, if the events are
genuine, and were lived perhaps by a teenager, or are intended to
educate that audience. Notwithstanding that, the entertainment is
just not there.

The set is too predictable as inner cities and run down sections of
hyper-populated locations are obviously, stereotypically associated
with drug trafficking and consumption.

There's also the business-side with a bar being owned and operated
by the drug kingpin, who keeps business going well, by circulating
the powder, and calling the muscle for those interfering or
dismissing the consumption as bad, among the patrons.

Although the acting is professional from several actors, and sincere
by all the cast, there are a number of emotional situations that seem
too contrived to be appreciated.

In addition, the music seems haphazardly chosen, random, eclectic,
incoherent, although it does make the picture more effective than
otherwise.

There's a rape scene, that is totally uncalled for, unnecessary in
terms of the ugliness and impact on the public who paid for their
tickets or DVD rental. Pastore getting head in the backseat of a
Cadillac or Lincoln is another redundant moment.

Finally, the drug burn, at the end, seems out of place, a
non-sequitur since nothing had built up to that scene from earlier,
suggesting perhaps more time in the editing room could have helped.

Not at all what was expected (a mobster movie.)",1270166400,,2424,5.1923076923076925
7970700,2,B00006JU89,Well I normally like movies like this but this low budget movie has really bad special effects and the acting is mediocre and the positive thing  would be the story itself and the insight of the neighborhood. I would not recommend you this movie even for its low price,1238889600,,268,4.469387755102041
7970701,5,B00006JU89,"Not knowing what to expect, I purchased this film becasue I've been a fan of Michael Rodrick's for some time now. If I thought I knew his before from his other work, or I thought that 'The Godfather' was a blood and guts movie, I was wrong. They had nothing on this film.
The acting was fantastic, from the begnning through the end of the film. Even though you knew where the film was taking you, you couldn't move. You HAD to watch.
Great great film.",1043452800,6,451,4.255813953488372
