4708077,5,B005I4HO4I,I always loved the blue hound dog since he first appeared on television when I was a kid.  A well done animated film featuring Huckleberry Hound.  Picture quality and sound of this DVD was good.  Recommended for Hanna-Barbera fans.,1412294400,,231,4.871794871794871

4708081,4,B005I4HO4I,"Got it for an avid Huckleberry Fan and although he said it was good, the voice is not the very original of Huckleberry Hound.",1358380800,,125,4.25

4708083,1,B005I4HO4I,"It's a mediocre spoof of Westerns at best. The plot takes forever to finish and it gets derailed by filler. The animation is third-rate. The jokes are luke-warm at best. There are also too many pointless cameos from lesser known Hanna-Barbera characters like Magilla Gorilla & Mr. Peebles. The villains are 1D at best. It's lame,boring & preditable. I give this film a 1 out of 10.",1317081600,,381,4.701492537313433
4708084,5,B005I4HO4I,"""The Good, The Bad And Huckleberry Hound"" is my favorite made-for-TV movie of all time. This has all the wit and charm that Huck showed during his syndicated TV run from 1958-1962. It is funny and just great Huckleberry Fun for everyone. There are some gags from the original cartoons that have been dropped into the movie that were marvelous to see again.

I have enjoyed this movie since it first came out in 1988 and, now, Warner Archive presents on DVD ""The Good, The Bad and Huckleberry Hound."" I watched this film on TV in May 1988 when it originally aired and then purchased this film on VHS that same year. Believe it or not, there are three versions of the film. The first one is the original TV broadcast. The second one is the first VHS release which added additional scenes in the film and then the third version is an edited piece that takes out certain elements.

I was pleasantly surprised that all of the elements from the original video release have been kept intact as well as new elements were added to this release that haven't been seen since this film was first shown on TV, namely the bumpers into and out of commercials. This makes this new Warner Archive version the definitive release of ""The Good, The Bad and Huckleberry Hound.""

The colors on this release are the sharpest I have ever seen them and the sound is pristine. Thank you, Warner Archive, for putting such a great quality DVD release out as this. This is my favorite TV movie of all time and you have outdone yourselves. This fan couldn't be more proud having this movie in my Huckleberry Hound collection. Thank you.",1315180800,11,1606,4.550173010380623

Hopefully this movie will make it to DVD some day.  In the mean time, enjoy this movie on VHS.  It's worth it.",1121644800,3,470,4.470588235294118
4708086,5,B005I4HO4I,"I first saw this movie when I was little, I've always loved it.  It has all your Hanna-Barbera favourites like Yogi, Boo-Boo, Quickdraw McGraw, Snagglepuss, Hokey Wolf, plus a whole host of new characters like Rusty Nails and many more.  This film has all the charm and magic you'd expect from Hanna-Barbera, and can be enjoyed by children and adults alike.  The songs are great, very catchy tunes and the story is a very good, typical good vs bad senario and is a very well watched video in my collection. I can honestly say I don't see any negative points about the film, in my opinion it was an amazing movie of magic, fun, romance and good ol' western shooting.",1078617600,9,665,4.525

8474173,4,B005I4HO4I,"I think the last time I watched this I was 12 or 13 years old... I'm over 30 now and I still enjoyed rewatching this cartoon. Cartoons are just not made like they used to be now days so it's worth having these old classics around to share with younger generations. I watched this with my nephew the same day it came in the mail and he enjoyed it also. Who doesn't love Huckleberry Hound? My only complaint is the inclusion of the annoying commercial break announcements. I get why others would want them included, but it's an interruption in the show and both my nephew and I got annoyed each time we'd have to see those.",1438387200,2,621,4.316239316239316
