If you really want to learn it then you need to be patient. There was some background noise like cars driving by but that doesn't bother me it was just something I noticed. Hypno starts from the very basics. If you are diligent to practice the instructions then hopefully you'll be happy you did. Only thing is the price, yikes for me.",1441152000,,477,4.370786516853933

8244356,5,B00127012M,"I own a large street dance video store and Hypno's 101 dvd is one of our top sellers.  I've done mixed street dancing styles for almost a decade and I've watched Hypno's training DVD many times and it's been helpful in improving my popping.  I've taught hip hop dance and bboying professionally and I've watched almost all of the 100's of hip hop, and funk styles videos that we carry at my store and Hypno's videos are definitely some of the best.  He really knows what he's doing and more than that, he's really good at breaking it down in simple, easy to follow exercises.  I've seen Electric Boogaloo's Videos, and many other training videos, and while they are good too, I feel that Hypno's videos are on the same high level of teaching quality, move authenticity and dance ability.

I resent the previous reviewers insinuating that just because he watched a youtube video clip of the video and he didn't care for it, that any positive reviews about the dvd must be fake.  I looked at that reviewer's other reviews and he had negative things to say on pretty much everything he reviewed.  I'd like him to put out his own videos if he thinks he can do so much better!  Anyway, ignore that reviewer, these videos can definitely teach you the basics of popping and locking, they are fun to watch and Hypno definitely knows his stuff.  I highly reccomend this video to any aspiring funk stylist.",1214179200,,1396,4.57429718875502
8244357,2,B00127012M,"Tommy Hypno Chan is a good enough funk dancer.  If you live in an area where there aren't many choices for pop locking instruction, you might bennefit from taking classes from some one of Tommy's skill level.

If you're buying a DVD, there are much better options.

but really just search youtube.  THere are tons of free clips of classic funk dancers, like poppin pete, poppin taco, and salah teaching classes.",1213833600,,411,4.746478873239437
