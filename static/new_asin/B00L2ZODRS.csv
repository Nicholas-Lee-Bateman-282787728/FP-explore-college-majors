8663508,2,B00L2ZODRS,"The film opens with a complex narration by the ""Overseer"" (Neil Johnson). He speaks in a loud whisper and competes with the soundtrack to be heard (F- for sound editor Phillip Bladh). He is speaking in 2518 about a master human race which accelerated/created human evolution on earth. There was a great federation which went to war with artificial intelligence and won and a search for DNA and something discovered that is 200,000 years old and  the Second Federation has problems with rebels. It jumps 200 years later as we then see a man killed for speaking out and 18 years later his son John Worthy (Darren Jacobs) joins the Federation which killed his father as a star fighter pilot.  They ask him if he was related to the rebel and John says ""NO"" because he knows that a federation that can trace DNA back to the beginning of time will have no idea whose his father.

Yes John Worthy to no surprise rebels against the Second Federation and joins up with the rebels. And if you managed to have everything figured out we get thrown a twist at the end at which point I didn't know what had happened or for that matter, who to pull for. All I know is that they plan a sequel. Now I thought the Overseer was over 200 years old so how could he have a sister that is still alive? Yes, I was confused.

The plot complexity and planet jumping (with no explanation how they do that) made the whole film a waste of time with bad acting and dialogue to boot. Darren Jacobs lead a group of horrendous actors with maybe E.J. De La Pena being the bright spot. And what was that at the end? Four women vs. an entire planet? A waste of special effects.

If you plan on watching it, take notes.
