7995184,4,B0000A02VB,"great DVD combo pack 3 of the best and well known horror classics of our time in one collection, yea the quality may not be the best but that what makes it great. think about it did they have DVD quality in the silent film era, nope so this is like it was back then. and who doesn't like type o negative as background music for Nosferatu. nice touch there. I am a huge horror fan and would recommend this to friends and fellow horror fans alike. I am usually a Blu Ray guy now but i don't mind this at all. I paid $6.50 for it and am happy as could be with that. that's like $2.15 a movie. win win. the only gripe I have is when i opened it up the tape on the top of the case was stuck to the cover a little and it caused it to tear a little at the top. that's it.",1448409600,,764,3.751552795031056
7995185,5,B0000A02VB,"well, i love old horror movies, and these are all great. as i'm sure you've already read, this movie is really really bad quality. but beyond that, this is a really good dvd. especially if you are really cheap like me. actually, that's probably the main reason i like this so much. i'm cheap, this cost under $10, and i got three really cool movies. so if you have the money, by all means, buy each of these individually, and get them with much better video and sound. but if you do most of your shopping at wal-mart and salvation army, get this. oh yeah, Nosferatu has type o negative music playing in the background. i actually enjoyed this, and thought it was fitting, but alot of people probably wouldn't.",1104278400,4,709,4.461538461538462
7995186,1,B0000A02VB,"This DVD pack looks and soudns like a good deal, it even has the man himself, Vincent Price on the front. How can you pass up these three absolute classics of horror in one DVD for this very low price. How? I'll tell you how, first it is like you've purchased the VHS versions of each film as they are extremely grainy and have poor sound quality. Next there are no special features so it might as well be a VHS anyway. Third and to me, biggest of them all, they have ruined Nosferatu, a class film from the silent era by adding heavy metal music to it!?!?!?!?!?!?!? What are they thinking, I'll be selling this DVD first chance I get, I suggest you avoid having to do the same by never purchasing it.",1102204800,2,701,4.2388059701492535
7995187,5,B0000A02VB,All the Movies on this pack are great-Nosferatu;House on Haunted Hill; Night of the Living Dead.  I love all 3 of them but the quality can be better-it doesn't have that dvd picture that people would want.  I love the music they added for Nosferatue.  Rock Horror meets 1922-lol.  I still love these movies but and i think i can live with the bad quality anyway.,1100390400,5,362,4.4393939393939394
7995188,1,B0000A02VB,"If you're wanting to buy Vintage Entertainment's TRIO OF TERROR triple feature DVD,forget it,it's a huge waste of time and effort! This triple feature DVD contains three horror classics: HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL (1958) starring Vincent Price,George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968) and F.W. Murnau's NOSFERATU (1922).These are great horror classics at their best,but this DVD falls nothing short of poor quality and sound and I DO mean poor quality!!! The quality of HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL is so poor that there are video glitches and artifacts as if it was copied of a VHS video source as is the audio which drops out occassionally!!! The print of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is average,but I seen better DVD and VHS copies than this. And finally,the version of NOSFERATU is NOT the actual silent version,but a so-called 'reconstructed' version from 1998 that features very innapropriate heavy metal music by the band Type O Negative and a on-screen introduction by David Carradine (which is omitted from this DVD).The '84 re-release of METROPOLIS was a lot better than this travesty!!! I taped the David Shepard restoration of NOSFERATU off of TCM and believe me,it's a LOT better than this poorly-made version!!! To make matters worse,I couldn't fast forward all the way through it and it starts back to the very beginning!!! I would suggest avoiding this DVD and get a much better-looking quality DVD of these films (I have HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL on DVD in widescreen,and trust me,it's well worth the price!!!) and don't even think about watching,nor enjoying this triple feature set,because it's a real waste of money,effort,and most of all,quality of these terrific and amazing film classics!!! Shame on you Vintage Entertainment for making this DVD look like a disaster-area and train wreck!!!",1087171200,8,1800,5.08445945945946
