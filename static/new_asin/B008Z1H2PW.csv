8532924,4,B008Z1H2PW,"This DVD is good, it is Margaret after all but I liked her earlier episodes even better.  These will probably get the job done but I can remember shows from the earlier years that I thought were better, and by that I mean more challenging.",1435017600,2,239,4.311111111111111
8532925,5,B008Z1H2PW,"This compilation of a variety of Margaret's workouts is wonderful. It is really fun to go back and do ""old"" routines for those of us that have followed Margaret and Body Electric for a long time. The workouts are thoughtfully put together, and although they do go quickly from one to the other, once you are familiar with the series, you can easily go from one workout to the next. Her explanations are easy to follow and her witty personality makes it really enjoyable to exercise with her. She really cares about helping you exercise properly. Highly recommended",1424908800,5,564,4.76530612244898
8532926,3,B008Z1H2PW,"Many years ago I worked out to Margaret Richard's on public t.v. So I thought I would get some of her old volumes which are truly her ""old"" exercises. There is really one big problem I have with the DVD. Each exercise clip from years past goes way too fast then right into the next so you really never get a chance to calmly go into each exercise. Let's just say it is a good thing I have a good memory.",1395100800,4,403,3.9876543209876543
8532927,2,B008Z1H2PW,"No I would not recommend it .I thought it would be one of her full tapes that I bought when she had her show on T.V.It is a bunch of parts from her shows,jumping around. Should send it back!",1387238400,2,190,3.8974358974358974
8532928,5,B008Z1H2PW,I used to exercise to Margaret for years when my kids were young.  She is very good at what she does and very motivating.,1376956800,,121,4.041666666666667
8532929,3,B008Z1H2PW,"I expected a more recent edition as shown on our local channel  with background music with Sreisand,Talor,etc.  Also:
one exercise finishes and runs right into the next one. There is no time between and the warm-ups are not well spaced.",1376611200,4,236,4.875
8532930,5,B008Z1H2PW,"Margaret Richard's Body Electric was my favorite morning workout, our local broadcast quit showing it, and I had not found an enjoyable replacement until I found these DVD's at a great price! Brenda",1367020800,9,198,5.03030303030303
