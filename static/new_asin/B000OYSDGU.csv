2806297,5,B000OYSDGU,Arrived quickly. Good variety of movie. Hoped I could use them for school use. Works well for that.  Would not recommend for casual viewing at home,1357344000,,147,4.653846153846154

8187702,5,B000OYSDGU,"Any and all things Discovery Channel is interesting, exciting and well worth trying out! The description covers what the episode/disks material is about, so I won't go into what you've already read. What I will say, is here you have an amazing collection of, in fact one of many Discovery Channel bests in one package. A best buy for someone who want the 'sampler platter', if DC was a restaurant.... And 5 stars it would be!
Not only interesting for adults, but I am homeschooling my sons and incorporate the DC in as a supplement to our curriculum (Science..History) and they genuinely appreciate and learn from watching.",1439596800,,623,4.831775700934579

8187704,3,B000OYSDGU,"Was a gift for my elderly father. He would love it, but is too deaf to hear the dialogue. This production should be CLOSE-CAPTIONED.",1415750400,,132,4.541666666666667

8187706,5,B000OYSDGU,"This is a great idea: documentary segments of real, cutting-edge technology in 2007, interspersed with imagined  applications of those now-mature technologies in a fictional story set 50 years later in 2057.  ""The Body"" episode is great, and my high school students always think it's really cool and inspiring. The fictional aspects of the other two episodes don't work quite as well as in ""The Body,"" but they are still good. The only problem is that the tech is now a few years old, and with the exponential acceleration of tech, a few years is a lot. Still worth picking up though, imho.",1389484800,,590,4.7745098039215685
8187707,4,B000OYSDGU,"Product arrived in a timely manner. Cardboard case was kinda beatup, but the DVDs were in workable condition. I wouldn't by any means call these shows the best of what the Discovery Channel has to offer, but they're still fun to watch.",1383436800,,235,4.619047619047619
8187708,3,B000OYSDGU,"I thought it was a new unopened item, that is why I bought it.  But it was an already played item.",1364515200,,98,3.6666666666666665
8187709,5,B000OYSDGU,Great video to aid in introducing technology in our lives!  My students really seem to like this video.  Helps them to start thinking about how technology will change in THEIR futures...A+A+A+A+A+!,1363392000,,197,5.32258064516129
