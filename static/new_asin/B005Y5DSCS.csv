8489081,5,B005Y5DSCS,I've been practicing martial arts for more than twenty years and have had many teachers.  Sensei Annesi's approach of focusing on the principles behind good technique rather than just technique itself is very refreshing and has breathed new life into my practice.  I highly recommend Sensei Annesi's videos and seminars.  I've been purchasing his Master Class DVDs one by one and will continue to do so for as long as he produces them.,1360108800,,435,4.931506849315069
