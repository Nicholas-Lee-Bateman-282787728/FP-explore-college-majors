2880126,5,B000FWCWQ8,"Gritty, brooding and full of ""Gangster"" flavor, this movie will easily rise to the top of everyone's Indie Film collection.  The fabulous acting pulls you into an exciting plot that is well supported by moody lighting, skilled editing and a wonderful score. The viewer feels like they've been transported back in time to Al Capone's Chicago. I hated to see the movie come to an end. My advice to any movie buff:  BUY ""LEGIT""!!! You'll love it.",1149638400,4,443,4.740259740259741
2880127,4,B000FWCWQ8,"Quirky, funny and entertaining film. Great to see local talent used in this A-1 indie film. Hope there will be more from Stemberg, Boinski and the 'gang'.",1149638400,2,154,4.7407407407407405
2880128,5,B000FWCWQ8,"This film contains some Action, comedy and Drama all in one. Good show to have in the library. Nice to see Chicago movies again.",1149638400,3,128,4.375
2880129,5,B000FWCWQ8,"This is a MUST for any Action/Drama/Suspense Fan. Reminded me of

 ""Cotton Club"" meets ""Chicago""...I will own my own copy of this DVD and recommend it to all of my Friends!

 Filmed in one of the greatest cities in the World: Chicago, IL.

Great job guys!!!!",1149552000,3,258,4.521739130434782
2880130,5,B000FWCWQ8,"I love indies, and this is a keeper.  Great acting, great story, and a fun, fun, ride.  Chicago gangsters, hot dancers, and guns.  Great combo!",1149552000,2,143,4.64
2880131,5,B000FWCWQ8,"You wouldn't expect an independent film to have such great acting performances. The Big Jim and crew characters were acted wonderfully, and the detective characters were also great.  Great story, and nice surprise at the end.",1149552000,3,225,5.25
8204250,3,B000FWCWQ8,"I watched the trailer for this movie here on Amazon and it, uh, sucked. It was like the opening 90 seconds of the film and all that showed was the skyline and some credits. Really? I am supposed to base a decision on that crap?",1368057600,,227,4.066666666666666
8204251,4,B000FWCWQ8,I watched this movie and have to tell you that it is excellent. The main character played by James W. Boinski brings a great presence to the screen as he convinces you that he is Big Jim and he wants to get out of the mob.  The bad buys are bad guys and from the start of this movie you wonder if the good guys are going to win.  I heartily recommend this movie.,1315180800,,362,3.8783783783783785
8204252,5,B000FWCWQ8,"Okay, I am a lover of independent films, and came across the Legit website, and bought this film on a whim,and was blown away.  The lead actors including Joey Moran, and Big Jim Cartoni, are phenomenal with a great supporting cast as well.  There are full-blown choreographed dance sequences that amazed me with their precision, as well as a brand new song by Lee Greenwood (God Bless the USA)that had me crying.  Greeeeat twists and turns in this script, too.  I want a story here, folks, and this delievered.  All in all, this was shot beautifully, and this is the film I'm passing around to all my friends to see.  Legit rocks!!",1150243200,2,631,4.589285714285714
8204253,5,B000FWCWQ8,"Norm Boucher kills in this movie. Big Jim Boinski the writer, director and actor has ""the"" look and is genuinely trying to get out of the mob ""and away from all of this"" (a line from the movie). Angie, WOW, what a voice! ""Dressin up for Baby"" should be a hit on the charts today. John Stemberg, Richard Strimer...they are the pretty boys and that comes straight from the girls I was watching the movie with at the time. With a budget, it is no telling what these guys can do with Legit 2! If you like Chicago movies, you will truly enjoy the twists and turns of Legit with the city of Chicago making the perfect backdrop.  And yes...I appear in the movie and yes, I ordered 5 copies!",1150156800,,683,4.253846153846154
8204254,5,B000FWCWQ8,"I was referred to this film by friends whose taste in movies I trust.  When they told me about LEGIT, and that it was a MUST-SEE, I was skeptical.  After watching the movie, though, I am really glad I overrode my skepticism, because it won me over big time!

The plot line is great, with unsuspected twists and some really great multi-dimensional characters.  There is charming wit and heart to the story line, and I found myself compelled to find out more about each different character's next move.  The violence is handled very well, and the whole movie is artfully directed and produced and shot beautifully.

I will pass on my friends' advice to all who read this review....LEGIT is a MUST-SEE!",1150156800,2,699,4.688524590163935
8204255,5,B000FWCWQ8,"Loved the fact that you filmed in Chicago and  what you captured at the beginning of the movie. Lived in Chicago all my life and  its nice to know that and idependent film was made here. The movie was fun still talking about it. Love the score. I was singing the 2 songs that were in the movie for days. Can't wait for the soundtrack. Great story, light humored, along with some serious stuff going on. Good acting seemed so natural.  Telling everyone I know about this movie. I watch alot of movies and I found this very entetaining and it held my interest. It's one that I won't forget easily.  It's nice to know that there are people out there taking movie making seriously.",1149984000,,677,4.392
8204256,5,B000FWCWQ8,"Cheers to Big Jim Boinski and John Stemberg and all the Chicago actors and crew that made this happen. A great indie film with a super score. Can't wait for the soundtrack. Cheers to Doug Carter who wrote the score, and Lee Greenwod for ""Desires of the Heart"", listen to the words they are meaningful. John, the song you wrote & composed ""Dressing up for Baby"" is fantastic. Angie Schoofs performs it so well. Love the chemistry amongst the actors. For an indie film made with no budget this movie holds your interest from beginning to end. A nice mixture of serious and light humor and of course the grit that comes with it. All questions are answered.  A great movie to view, leaves you talking about it.

Will there be a ""legit 2""? Can't Wait!!

Thanks for filming in Chicago and using Chicago talent.",1149984000,2,804,4.531034482758621
8204257,5,B000FWCWQ8,"A great contemorary take on a classic mob tale. Getting out of the mob ain't easy.  Niether is making an independant film and Bowinski and Stemberg turned out one hell-of-a indie.  It's complete with a great story, believable cast and a wonderful vision of Chicago. I would buy this movie for the soundtrack alone. I'm putting this one between Goodfellas and Clerks in my collection.",1149897600,3,383,4.876923076923077
8204258,4,B000FWCWQ8,"LEGIT is an important film for many reasons.  It is proof that Chicago is an under-utilized location for film making.  Not only is this great city a beautiful backdrop, it also provides a huge pool of talent from writers and actors to DPs and makeup artists. LEGIT delivers on every one of these aspects.  It takes its viewers through the sometimes gorgeous, sometimes gritty, streets of Chicago and has some really terrific performances by all Chicago-based actors. A stellar performance is given by Norm Boucher as the power-hungry Joey Moran. His portrayal of a man slowly losing his power and his mind is captivating to watch.  Angie Schoofs is enthralling as Billie. Her smooth vocals and sex appeal make her nightclub numbers something to remember.  The nightclub scenes were some of my favorites with exciting numbers by Schoofs and beautiful, peacock feather-clad dancers.  Anyone that wants to support Chicago film making in all its forms should take a look at LEGIT.",1149897600,3,976,5.031055900621118
8204259,5,B000FWCWQ8,"From the opening credits you know what you're in for; with a backdrop of Chicago scenery, and a brilliant and emotional  soundtrack, Legit immediately gives you the feeling it will be a gangster cult classic. You are quickly drawn into the world of Big Jim and his friends and will be rooting for them the whole way.

Top-notch acting from a cast of Chicago actors with several smaller characters adding great comic relief. This is definitely a film you'll want for your collection. Highly recommended!",1149811200,3,502,4.894117647058824
