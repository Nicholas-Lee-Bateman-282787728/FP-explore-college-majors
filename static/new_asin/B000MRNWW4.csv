8171509,5,B000MRNWW4,"There is a lot more to this film than meets the eye at first glance. Not only does it present studies in relationships and culture, but it is a travelogue of Mexico and I use it at the university where I teach Spanish, as well as Mexican culture.  As you travel through Mexico with the two ""contrabandistas"", the two women who are petty criminals, you see the change in landscape, the change in ethnic groups, you hear music of the different regions, see different styles of dress and the change in climates.
  My students love this film and as the story unfolds they learn about Mexican culture and it's numerous facets. In several parts of the film you hear descendants of the Mayans speaking their first language and wearing their typical style of dress. You see examples of the oppression of the indigenous people.  The score that accompanies this film includes tunes of popular artists currently recording and performing in Mexico and the lyrics support the happenings of the film.

  The acting is very convincing and authentic. You won't find a more fun movie that teaches so much about a fascinating country. To live in Mexico is to love it and this film does the country justice.",1393459200,,1188,4.7101449275362315

8171511,4,B000MRNWW4,"Other reviewers have sketched the plot, and this looks at the broader aspects of the film.

Although it's a road-adventure story, the heart of the film is the relationship between the two women. Most of the weight of the film rests on the lead actresses, and their ability to keep the viewer interested in them and their perils. Tiare Scanda and Aitana Sanchez-Gijon both give marvelous performances and are completely convincing in their roles.

For those learning Spanish, the DVD has English and Spanish subtitles, and the Spanish subtitles are an accurate transcription of the words spoken. If you can't follow the dialogue, you can peek at the subtitles to learn what the words are. That's a big help in picking them out and becoming accustomed to how they sound in normal speech.

Some of the lines are delivered rapidly and none too clearly, which is normal in real-word speech. Compared to the other Spanish DVDs in my collection, though, this one is quite easy to understand. Some Mexican slang is used, but not much. The film is aimed at an international audience and sticks closely to standard Spanish.

Most of the characters speak with a Mexican accent and vocabulary, but according to the story, Ana was raised and educated in Spain. She has a pronounced accent of Castille, which the Mexicans find quite amusing. Mendizabel and Aurelia both poke fun at her accent, and the look on Ana's face is priceless. She has heard it all before, and is mighty weary of it.

For the student, it's a chance to hear the contrasting accents side-by-side.

This has become one of my favorite films in any language, and I highly recommend it.",1160265600,13,1640,4.797872340425532
