7867943,5,6304273932,I used one of the 3 video's years ago and was glad I could get another copy. I found the video easy to follow along and it provided a rewarding workout. Sorry that I couldn't find it on DVD.,1301875200,,190,3.8974358974358974
7867944,5,6304273932,I used these videos a while back to get in shape for a fitness test before I went into the military. I noticed results within the first two weeks of using the product. My experiment with these videos lasted about two months and I passed the fitness test without any problems. Pushups are hard for most females but I am able to easily do 25 to 30 with no problem and I shaved 4 minutes off my 1.5 mile run time. The muscle definition you get from the body intervals is amazing and the aerobics tape is challenging yet fun. I am always complimented on how nice my legs are and I attribute it to the plyometric portion on the Body Parts video with Giselle. I was very pleased with this product and would recommend it to a beginner or someone who is more advanced. Doing all three of these tapes together guarantees a great workout and is very challenging. You will be sore for a while but it will be worth all the pain and effort once you see the results.,1278633600,,952,4.236263736263736
