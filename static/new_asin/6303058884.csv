552135,5,6303058884,"the doctor third incarnations last serial is a good one  What always made this show fun was the acting and stories.  And here we get a interesting one for sure!  It's cool to see a villain that isn't a human in a suit. The effects are of their time and budget. but who cares? that doesn't mean I would not welcome someone taking this show and using cgi to replace all the old ones as a bonus. I can imagine that in fifty years it might be really cheap to do that on a home computer even.  so it would look awesome.  Anyways , it's still awesome because of the great late actors in this feature. rip.  Tom baker would show up in the next one and doctor who become a huge hit. BUT , this was shown in the u.s.  the whole pertwee episodes were in fact shown in denver. CO.  back then. So it amazes me that they never reran these on pbs and bbc america .  these are in color and great fun.  This one was the end of a era for sure.",1472256000,,926,3.9301075268817205

552139,5,6303058884,very Happy with DVD its funny to look at the way they made these TV shows compared to today's Doctor Who. this was  Jon Pertwee last regular episode of Doctor till he did the five doctors and it is one of my favorite Doctor Who not for  the effects but Pertwee deliver at the end,1433462400,,279,4.054545454545455

552254,3,6303058884,"As I mentioned in my review of Caves of Androzani, Doctor Who didn't have the luxury of being like a big budget blockbuster flick. Back then, a final episode for whoever the Doctor was was just a final episode, period. They were written by people who knew how to make stories that elide entirely on your imagination because, in spite of the limited budgets, to someone who doesn't have an imagination, the Doctor and his companions aren't materializing onto other planets, they're materialIng onto quarries and studio interiors. However, I don't have a preference over either era of Doctor Who because really, they both have their ups and downs. One thing that both eras have in common was that final episodes were very hard to nail.

Planet of the Spiders is one of the finest examples. It's got a decent and terrifying concept but it's plagued with problems. The story is pretty simple: the Doctor is sent back the wedding gift he gave to Jo because the natives from the Amazon which is where her expedition takes place think it contains dangerous properties. It's a crystal from Metabalis Three and it turns out the dominant species of that planet want it back. The species? Spiders, of course. To be fair, it does have its good bits. We get one final chase involving Bessie, and it's a great adrenaline pumper. There's some suspenseful moments and some tight dialogue, and when has Pertwee ever been disappointing?

However, it falls prey to two huge problems: first, its pacing. It's clear at times that this story doesn't have quite enough constant for six episodes. Thankfully when Tom Baker popped by some new staff were brought in who did a better job of controlling the pacing of the stories, but here there's superfluous subplot ting throughout which doesn't really serve any purpose except to pad the story out. Another big problem is the lack of creepiness. You hear a title like ""Planet of the Spiders"" and expect to be scared outright; I'm a huge arachnophobe and freak out over even the smallest spider so I was really hoping this episode wouldn't disappoint there. Spiders are scary but come on, if you want to scare us with spiders, why use these... skinny, anorexic spindly rubber toys instead of something that resembles giant, hairy tarantulas? Apparently they were going for giant hairy tarantulas but were forced to redact because they were too scary. But here's the thing, why do you think kids wanted to watch this show in the first place? To be scared senseless. This show has a long history of parading itself as a horror show for children, and so therefore some huge expectations are going to be had there.

In short this isn't a terrible episode by any means, it has its moments and Jon Pertwee does a splendid job with the material here, but if you want to get into Pertwee's era, take the dignified route of getting SPEARHEAD FROM SPACE.",1417305600,,2868,4.755020080321285
552255,3,6303058884,"A boring, poorly executed send-off for John Pertwee, there is really not much other reason to watch this story other than because it is the 3rd Doctor's finale.

A lame script that would have barely worked in a 90 minute slot is padded into an even more ludicrous 6 parts.  A bad James Bond chase sequence serves no purpose in the story -- although it as least gets us out of the studio for a few minutes.  In other places, the green screen effects are about as bad you'll ever see in any era of Doctor Who.  The poorly used Tibetan Buddhist overtones are made even more absurd by the English actor cast playing a lama with a silly Asian accent.  The spiders...  the less said about them the better.

Elisaeth Sladen is of course excellent.  Pertwee looks bored, although his meeting with the Queen Spider does inspire him to wake up for a few minutes.

The extra interviews are interesting enough.  I enjoyed hearing people talk about the episode far more than the episode itself.",1416960000,,981,4.5227272727272725

552259,3,6303058884,"This story ends Jon Pertwee's five season run on Doctor Who, the second longest by seasons of any Doctor and the third most number of episodes.

There's much to love about Planet of the Spiders and much to hate, so let's go ahead and take a look at them all:

Positives: Elizabeth Sladen shows plenty of pluck and courage and her emotion really sells the regeneration scene The concept of a band of psychic spiders trying to take over the world through the power of meditation is so insane, it's awsome.

The character of Tommy, a mentally challenged working at the meditation center is lovable and is a great subplot as the crystal increases his intelligence. The revelation of the Doctor's old teacher was marvelous and the teacher's trick was actually a pretty clever one.

Even the self-indulgent chase scene in Part Two was great over the top fun.

I also give the story credit for its efforts to rehabilitate Captain Yates who'd been drummed out of U.N.I.T.

Negatives: The story often depends on contrivance to advance the plot. Even going back to Episode 1, the whole event that creates the fissure between our dimension and that of the Spiders involves the Doctor plugging a diode into a man with psychic powers just at the moment chanting was going on at the meditation center.

Even worse than this, the episode has the Doctor doing research on human psychic power, something that makes no sense in light of the fact that he has all the knowledge of the Time Lords which the episode shows, is pretty darn advanced. The only reason for him to be doing this research is to convenience Barry Lets as writer rather than something the Doctor would actually do.

The editing suffers as the cliffhangers are almost all bad after part one as they fail to have that Classic Who moment that leaves you eager to watch the next episode. This is true even in Part Five when they could have easily used a far more interesting cliffhanger of Sarah possessed by the Spider Queen.

The human villain is weak and uninteresting, again not what we should expect from the final Pertwee story: a disgruntled salesman who at best serves as a plot device.

Sadly, this story also gives Nicholas Courtney the role of idiot savant as the Brigadier alleviated only by his, ""Here we go again."" comment on the third doctor's regeneration into the fourth.

This wasn't  the worst story ever, but Pertwee deserved a better send off than he got here.",1401926400,,2429,4.676056338028169

552430,4,6303058884,"Some reviewers have argued that the Third Doctor, Jon Pertwee in this story ""Planet of the Spiders"", went out on a weak story but I wholeheartedly disagree with that assessment.  It may not be the best story in the Pertwee Collection but it is pretty solid and what better way for a memorable version of this enduring character to bow out than to focus the story on the attributes that him great in spades...

From the Multi-Transportational methods used in the chase scenes to the Venusian Karate moves, this story is flush with action throughout to reinforce this most action-oriented of Doctor Who players.  The story itself is reasonably well developed and centers around the power of a blue crystal the Doctor previously ""stole"" from Metebelis 3 sometime earlier.  This crystal, with multi-faceted powers can not only aid the Spiders or ""Eight Legs"", rulers of this same planet to conquer Earth, but can also promote increased intelligence and other powers in individual humans.  Humans or ""Two Legs"" on Metebelis 3 are subservient to the Spiders so the Spiders have several reasons for wanting the crystal back desperately and of course, the Doctor holds the key.  As for the Spiders themselves, sure, they could have spent a few more pounds of their limited budget perhaps on more

There are several interesting side characters within the story.  These side characters include a slow witted man on Earth named ""Tommy"" who benefits first hand from the powers of the crystal when he temporarily acquires it as one of his ""pretties"".  There is also Lupton, another earth man who wants to use the power of the crystal to conquer the Earth for himself since he was past over for a Sales Promotion...

The story itself shifts back and forth from Earth where the story starts at a Tibetan Retreat where the meditation group conjures up the Spiders in the first place to Metebelis 3.  The climatic scene is on Metebelis 3 where the Queen Spider or ""Great One"" manages to get the crystal back only to overdose on its mental powers and the doctor's body cells disintegrate and hence he needs to regenerate, which he does in his last few moments back on Earth, with a very quick end appearance of the next Doctor, Tom Baker.

As for the regeneration scene, it is tastefully done, sending Jon Pertwee's great characterization of the role into the sunset as gone but never forgotten.  As a classic line from this episode states: ""There needs to be stoic acceptance of the inevitable"".",1355443200,,2478,4.816037735849057

PLANET OF THE SPIDERS
Story # 74
Season 11's Fifth and last Story; the final story of the Third Doctor Era.
Third Doctor, Jon Perwee Era, final season 1973-74
Fifth Classic Sarah Jane Smith Story

OVERALL STORY RATING 7/10
PLANET OF THE SPIDERS is mostly an excellent, entertaining story where the regular cast truly shine.  There are a few rough shoals to wade past involving the guest cast, but it is well worth the ""wade"" because PLANET OF THE SPIDERS is a tale in WHO history too important to miss! PLANET OF THE SPIDERS is mostly a 9/10 story pulled down to 7/10 by a bit of off-key acting by the guest cast in several Metebelis 3 scenes, and by the indulgent chase scene in Part 2 eating up 11 minutes of story time, while doing little for the plot.

The good news about PLANET OF THE SPIDERS is that where it is good, it is VERY, VERY good and well worth the time. It is probably PLANET OF THE SPIDERS and ROBOT together that provide the actual ""Final Curtain"" on the exceptional WHO era of Pertwee-Letts-Dicks. A 5-year era, Seasons 7-through-11, that moved the program into more adult story lines, with often brilliant stories and production.  While a few stories were let down by the limited technical capabilities of the time, the Letts-Dicks production team earns major respect for having the guts and imagination to try, even when the technical limitations of the time couldn't quite ""do it"".  WHO fans unfamiliar with the Classic Series, are in for an enormous treat when viewing stories from Seasons 7-11, because most are often brilliant even with the limitations.

This is an era that WHO fans both old and new, can rightfully salute, applaud, and appreciate, both for its own originality and for its influence and effect on the New Series.  Without the Pertwee-Letts-Dicks era, the New Series could not exist.

Essential viewing for both SARAH JANE ADVENTURES fans, and veteran Whovians, and a good story for introducing novices to WHO.

STORY & SCRIPT 8/10
PLANET OF THE SPIDERS is a case of production and acting falling a bit short of the quality of the script.  Script-wise, PLANET OF THE SPIDERS is an interesting, and important, story told very well.  The production sidetracks the excellent story a bit by some indulgences to the Third Doctor's love of vehicles. But it is the final story of the Third Doctor era, and those minor indulgances don't hold this mostly solid and entertaining story down for long.

ACTING 7/10
As usual, Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor and Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith are each a superb 10/10 in their roles, and have a close, affectionate chemistry together onscreen.  Nicholas Courtney and John Levene as the UNIT regulars Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and Sgt. Benton are also at top ""10/10"" form. A special mention definitely goes to Richard Franklin's excellent ""Mike Yates, former UNIT Captain"" here, who gets some wonderful screen time with Tommy, AND some very charming moments with Elisabeth Sladen to boot! It is genuinely nice to see former UNIT Captain Yates bow out of the program in such fine form. Most of the earth-based guest cast is excellent as well.  John Kane's ""Tommy"" is too touching and superb to miss!  The acting score is a solid 10/10 across the board, sadly being pulled down only by several surprise, off-key performances by guest cast in a few scenes set on Metebelis 3.

PRODUCTION QUALITY 8/10
The production is 10/10 superb, in almost all earth and Metebelis 3 scenes.  The extended chase scene in Part 2 should probably be rated 2/10, as it uses 11 minutes of screen time while doing little to advance the story.  Yet, in its own way, the chase scene is such a nostalgic, fun nod to the vehicle-loving Jon Pertwee era, that it is difficult to rate it quite that low.

There is a scene in Part 3 that is worth several looks. The scene is where Sarah Jane, standing on the mandala, is transported from Earth to Metebelis 3. Normally to the viewer, Sarah would have disappeared from the cellar. In a brilliant use of CSO, the viewer stays with Sarah, and the entire cellar dissolves around her into Metebelis 3.  It is actually a breathtaking production effect, worthy of any modern CGI effects today! Superbly done by Barry Letts who was directing!

Barry Letts at this time, must have been doubly thrilled at his good fortune in having Elisabeth Sladen for Season 11.  One feature of story production that stands out to the viewer, is how central and important Sarah Jane is throughout this story.  In the critical final regeneration scene, it is Sarah Jane who is central, as everything revolves around her, and she is clearly the audience anchor.  Sarah Jane remains central to the action of the following story, ROBOT, which was in simultaneous production with PLANET OF THE SPIDERS. Sarah Jane is the only character to appear in all 10 episodes of both stories. In the clarity of our 20-20 hindsight, making Sarah Jane central to both stories was a wise decision by Barry Letts. His instinct and foresight at the time told him that the audience would follow Elisabeth Sladen and that she could carry the show on her own during the critical transition between Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker.

SPECIAL EFFECTS 9/10
The mostly-CSO-created Metebelis 3 works surprisingly well for a studio set in projecting an alien, otherworldly feel onscreen. While there are some slightly weak CSO scenes involving spiders, there is nothing truly bad, so overall special effects come off pretty well.  Most special effects scenes hold up reasonably well against modern CGI special effects, such as the Part 3 scene described in PRODUCTION QUALITY earlier. Actually a fairly stunning achievement in CSO special effects for 1974.

STORY IMPORTANCE 10/10
A story of top importance, making it a must-watch story for every dedicated Whovian. The final story of Jon Pertwee's 5-year run as the increasingly popular and highly successful Third Doctor, a golden age in WHO history that saw the program reach new heights and grow more adult under the steady hands of Barry Letts and Terrance Dicks. It is the first time in WHO history that the term ""Regeneration"" is used in the program, and also the first time it is suggested that all Time Lords have this ability. It is the final regular appearance of Richard Franklin as Mike Yates, and the first glimpse of Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor. The bittersweet, yet exciting end of the Third Doctor era that served as the solid foundation for launching the incoming new Hinchcliffe-Holmes production team and new Tom Baker Fourth Doctor to even greater heights over Seasons 12, 13 and 14 that followed.

DVD EXTRAS 10/10
Superb across the board.  Three GREAT documentaries: THE FINAL CURTAIN; JOHN KANE REMEMBERS; and DIRECTING DOCTOR WHO WITH BARRY LETTS.

Excellent on-screen text commentary by Nicholas Pegg.

COMMENTARY Participants
Barry Letts, Terrance Dicks, Elisabeth Sladen & Richard Franklin, Parts 1,2,3,4,5 & 6; Nicholas Courtney Parts 1,2 & 6.  An excellent commentary that is also sad and poignant, as it is the final commentary WHO fans will ever hear them all participate in together.  Barry Letts, Nicholas Courtney, and Elisabeth Sladen had all passed away before PLANET OF THE SPIDERS was DVD-released.

FINAL CURTAIN Participants
Barry Letts, Terrance Dicks, Richard Franklin, Jon Pertwee (1995 interview), Mark Gatiss, Matt Irvine, Rochelle Selwyn.

JOHN KANE REMEMBERS
John Kane fondly remembers his only WHO appearance, and gives a fascinating first person account of his very postive impression of working with Jon Pertwee and Elisabeth Sladen on set in the Third Doctor's final story.

DIRECTING DOCTOR WHO WITH BARRY LETTS
Barry Letts remembers his path into producing ""Doctor Who"", and his time as producer.",1348012800,,7917,4.902621722846442
552432,5,6303058884,"I bought this because it was Pertwee's last appearance as the Doctor and Liz Sladen was in it as well. I have always been a big fan of Tom Baker, but this episode showed me how well Pertwee played the Doctor. Now I plan on purchasing all of Pertwee's last season. As well as all of the Tom Baker years. I strongly reccomend DVD this to any Doctor Who fan. For those who only know Tom Baker's Doctor, give Jon Pertwee chance you will not be disappointed, I wasn't.",1343088000,,463,4.213483146067416
552433,2,6303058884,"Planet of the Spiders is the not-so-good departure story of Jon Pertwee's doctor. Sadly it must rank among the bottom stories of Pertwee's tenure.

As I watched it today, I found it to feel exceedingly long, despite the fact, that it was only about 100 minutes in total leaving out the titles and repeated footage. The whole idea of the spiders and Tibetan mysticism was unispired drivel. The storyline was stupid and lifeless and the Doctor is blamed by the writers for having caused the whole problem in the first place. Yes, the Doctor gets blamed for causing the whole problem of the story and I guess then that he deserves to get ""killed,"" at the end for his sin of ""stealing"" a crystal from a planet in a previous program.

Ultimately, the person responsible for this terrible program was producer, writer and director, Barry Letts. This story was really his baby and perhaps this is why this show is one of the weakest. Letts is the person mostly responsible for bringing in the occultic themes into several of the Pertwee stories. The New Age philosophy that was so popular in the 60s and 70s got into Doctor Who because of Letts and it's a pity. The Doctor rattles off unproven New Age clap-trap that everyone has latent abilities to ESP and telekinesis. Of course, the Doctor, a Timelord, speaks with authority so the viewer must take these statements at the Doctor's face value.

Barry Letts as late as when he did the radio Doctor Who episodes, The Ghosets of N-Space, with Jon Pertwee was still obsessed with the occult. One rotten apple can spoil the barrel. There is nothing wrong with a show that involves some occultic themes per se, but there is, in my opinion, when these themes are being disseminated in such a way that the viewer may decide to try and delve into the occult themselves after listening to their hero tell them they have these dormant abilities!

There is a rather large chase scene which, basically goes nowhere. It is rather boring, cars, and hovercrafts, and mini-helicopters going around in circles over the same road endlessly to end with the bad guy disappearing! Even Letts, in an interview, admits that the whole chase was pointless. The bluescreen technique that was employed was awful. Why couldn't the BBC use a photograph of the sky without dust all over it? And beware the ""Bad Acting"" warning sign should have lit up when we come to the quaint spider-food of a civilization segment of the program.

On the brighter side, I rather enjoyed the making-of featurettes. A 1997 interview with Jon Pertwee was used within the documentary and worked well with the other interviews. Even Barry Letts the guy responsible for the mess was an interesting interview. Terrence Dicks gives some interesting remarks also. I also enjoyed the interview with actor, John Kane, who played Tommy. I liked that they included the edited ""omnibus"" version where they edited all the episodes together to make one movie.

In addition I enjoyed some of the audio commentary. Nicholas Courtney, Barry Letts and Elisbeth Sladen, have all passed away, but we are able to enjoy their comments and conversation on the commentary of this disk. Terrance Dicks is always funny with his remarks and Richard Franklin also adds to the commentary. Just to brag, I had the pleasure to see Courtney and Sladen in-person at a convention years ago and actually met Dicks and Franklin.

The real die-hard fans of the original series will want to add this to their collection. But someone who is only mildly interested might want to check a copy out of their local library first!",1332460800,,3583,4.778675282714055
552564,4,6303058884,"In 1974 after 5 full-color, groovy years filled with Venusian karate chops, James Bondesque gadgets, the Master, high octane old roadsters, frilly shirts, and frequently reversing the polarity, Jon Pertwee called it a day and packed it in as the Doctor. Planet of the Spiders is his final outing as the Doctor, and while it's not a great story, it is a fitting goodbye to the Pertwee era.

The story comes off as John Pertwee's greatest hits. There is a letter from Jo Jones (nee Grant). The Brigadier and Sergeant Benton join in for a rousing chase sequence. As a bonus, we get to see Mike Yates (former UNIT captain) one last time, and he is redeemed for his dastardly turn the last time we saw him. We get one last chase with Bessie and the Whomobile, plus a gyrocopter, speedboat and hovercraft thrown in for good measure. The Doctor even has an opportunity to use his Venusian karate and reminisce about one of his many famous friends (Houdini this time). It's a nice walk down memory lane with the Doctor and the UNIT family.

The story itself, well you see there are these giant spiders, and they want this blue crystal that the Doctor took from Metebelis 3. (He'd given it to Jo Grant as a wedding present after solving the problem of the giant maggots in the Green Death a year earlier - luckily Jo mailed it back to the Doctor from the Amazon jungle at the beginning of the story). OK, so meanwhile off in the country Mike Yates is at a Buddhist monastery where he's trying to find himself after the nastiness with the dinosaurs, and he discovers this group of guys chanting away in the basement without proper supervision when something starts to materialize. Mike Yates quickly realizes there's something not quite right here, and that this must be a job for UNIT-slight problem since Mike had turned on the Brig and company in the Invasion of the Dinosaurs, so they probably wouldn't listen to him. Solution - Mike asks Sarah Jane Smith to come down to the monastery to do a story on it and convince her that there is something untoward going on at the meditation center.

Throw in a brief subplot at the beginning with the Doctor doing research into psychic abilities (I think primarily to have the charming scene at the beginning of the story where the Doc and the Brig go to a vaudeville show, maybe the men could learn some of her moves indeed...), a story about a planet's human population subjugated by giant spiders, and a mentally handicapped young man who saves the day and you've got the story. The story is interesting, but feels a bit jumbled. The thread of redemption, rebirth and renewal is throughout the story in order to prepare the audience for the inevitable ending, and it truly feels like the end of an era, which it was.

To put things into perspective, at the time of this story's airing the program had reached its highest heights of viewership and fandom during Pertwee's era. Doctor Who had gone from a show that was almost cancelled to a television institution during these five years, and no one knew the heights it would shortly attain during Tom Baker's first few years. Also the production team had remained consistent throughout Pertwee's time as the Doctor, which hadn't happened before on Doctor Who, and wouldn't happen again until perhaps Peter Davison's era. It gave a strong cohesive feeling to the entirety of Jon Pertwee's time as the Doctor. We must remember that this was not only a goodbye for Jon Pertwee, but for Terrence Dicks and Barry Letts as well.

For the story itself it was Barry Letts' baby all the way. He co-wrote the scripts, produced the story, and directed it. The story was based on Barry Letts interest in Buddhism and meditation and was something of a Buddhist parable. Terrence Dicks, the script editor and no shrinking violet, pretty much let Barry Letts run with it. This even shows during the commentary track on the DVD where Terrence Dicks was fairly subdued, not offering up anywhere near his usual contribution and let Barry Letts have center stage for his story.

I have to admit I was a little disappointed with the extras on this set. There was a nice interview with John Kane who played Tommy. There was the obligatory making of feature, and a nice overview of Barry Letts directing. The then and now feature on shooting locations wasn't that interesting. The omnibus version of the story was interesting to contrast with the original serialized story, and the information text option was filled with interesting tidbits that weren't necessarily already covered in the commentary and making of features.

I did enjoy the commentary option, but found it a little sad because of the realization that 3 of the 5 people involved with the commentary tracks had recently passed away. Barry Letts and Elisabeth Sladen were both quite interesting and had a lot of good information, and Terrence Dicks had some good comments as well, but as stated earlier he was much more reserved than usual on commentary tracks. Unfortunately, Nicholas Courtney and Richard Franklin's contributions weren't as well informed or interesting.

So after all of this should you get this DVD? Well, if you enjoy Jon Pertwee's Doctor, then the answer is a resounding yes. It really is a fond farewell to his years as our favorite time traveler. If you are not familiar with Jon Pertwee's time in the TARDIS, then I recommend you wait until you've sampled at least 1 or 2 stories from each of his five years. I promise you'll enjoy it much more if you have more of a background with his Doctor's adventures. Finally, if you're a fan of the new Doctor Who and want to check out some early stories, don't start here with Jon Pertwee. I strongly recommend you check out Terror of the Autons, The Curse of Peladon, The Sea Devils and/or The Time Warrior before you watch this story.",1328313600,,5834,4.6904296875
552565,5,6303058884,"This is a bittersweet story as we say goodbye to our dearly beloved Jon Pertwee.  The episodes are full of all the things you have come to expect from this era of our dearest Doctor including a somewhat ridiculous chase scene.  Even though the spiders in the episode are a little silly at times it still works because I think everybody hates the idea of large spiders that talk and ride on your back telling you what to do.

There is a very touching scene between the Doctor and Sarah Jane.

The special features are a wonderful sampling of featurettes and DVD-rom delicousness.  If you have any othe other DVD's then you will know what to expect.  If not then you can look forward to interviews commentary and TV features from the period the show first aired (1974).

The good part of the story is the themes of fear and choices that the characters have to deal with.  The plot, while using a lot of Doctor Who history such as Metebelis 3 and the blue crystal, is solid in itself.  The problem starts when we see the spiders for the first time and, later, see the planet itself.  While they tried to make the spiders look good they did not try to make them look very realistic, fearing that they would upset the kids and the parents.
 The planet, made with a LOT of blue screen, seems to be an unlikely mixture of backwards civilization and Lovecraft monsters.  Buddhism and New Age ideas has a very heavy hand in the theme which seems to help the setting but also ages it slightly to today's viewers.
 I still love the episodes but the DVD, with the extras, still feels weak.  I would have loved MORE extras, maybe more about the spiders, and the viewers reactions, in the extras.",1315008000,,1076,4.313432835820896
552567,3,6303058884,"It is always a big todo when there is a change in the actor who is playing the Doctor and this is no exception in ""Planet of the Spiders"".  What adds to the fanfare is the previous of actors, William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton each played the role for three years.  Jon Pertwee had the role for five years.  His Doctor was different from the first two as he was at first confined to Earth and tended to be more James Bond like in his persona.  Also, Pertwee's Doctor had the advantage of having his serials filmed in color.  While ""Planet of the Spiders"" is fast moving and exciting in places, it suffers greatly from the special effects of the day and the budget constraints that make the spiders of Metebellis Three look rather cheesy.  They are more comical than frightening.  A plus for the serial is the wonderful late Elizabeth Sladen who plays Sarah Jane Smith with great panache and style.  She was a great addition to the Doctor Who cast in Jon Pertwee's last season as the Doctor and Tom Baker's first seasons in the role as well.  The Tibetan influence in this serail is a wonderful nod to the Troughton Yeti stories and when Jon Pertwee fades into Tom Baker, it is truely a changing of the guard.  The Doctor is going in a new direction with a new Doctor, new writing and production staff and all of us are hanging on for a new exciting ride",1313539200,,1357,4.392
552568,5,6303058884,"In my own opinion, for the time it was made, this swan song for a Doctor is better then 2010's The End of Time. The overall story is great and keeps you wondering until the regeneration scene. If compared to other regenerations, this one is the simplest and possibly one of the more heart-breaking ones. Jon Pertwee's tenure as the Third Doctor has often been hailed as the Golden Age of Doctor Who and this story is a good example why. I strongly recommend it, even if you aren't a Jon Pertwee fan. It's great for the Tom Baker fans out there, but I also say get it for the historical purpose it serves. The spiders may seem flimsy, but once you see what the Great One does to the Doctor, you won't be thinking that anymore. This story is also good for the petrolhead Who fans because Pertwee's Doctor is well-known for liking fast automobiles, and in this case, hovercrafts. Basically what I'm saying is BUY IT now !!!!!",1309996800,,922,4.429411764705883
552569,5,6303058884,"Planet of the Spiders is a bit uneven, with some wobbly effects and a somewhat meandering storyline, but it's also full of brilliant elements - Tommy, the redemption of Mike Yates, and the always-great Sarah Jane.  It's a wonderful tribute to the Jon Pertwee era, complete with a chase involving pretty much every type of vehicle imaginable - cars, a helicopter, a fishing boat, a hovercraft, and the Doctor's flying car.  Pertwee is excellent in his final story, giving it all the energy, humor, and conviction he always brought to the role.

Best of all, the Third Doctor's death and regeneration are beautifully handled; Pertwee's final moments may be the most moving of any of the Doctors.

The DVD is typically superb, with a good commentary, the shorter, snappier Omnibus version, and a million documentaries.

It's a must see for Whovians, and especially for any fans of Pertwee.",1308182400,,886,4.95945945945946

552572,4,6303058884,"FOR a show like Dr. Who where several actors have played the lead role, There is always debate over who was the best. The general consensus with Doctor Who fandom is that Tom Baker was the best of the classic series Doctors while David Tennet is the best, so far, of the current series. That being said I respectfully submit that Jon Pertwee, the third actor to play the enigmatic time traveler, is ever bit the equal of Baker and Tennet and was, as they were, ""Born to play the role"".

  Pertwee took on the role of Doctor who at the dawning of the 1970's (His first episode aired late December 1969) and looking back now he bore the weight of the entire series'  future on his shoulders. There was great debate at the BBC over weather or not to continue on with the program given the expense of converting and filming the show in color. Add to that a looming strike at the BBC,  and fickle fan base facing a new decade with new interest and a series cut way down in length do to budget constraints (the final Patrick Troughton series had seven stories comprising 43 episodes while pertwee's first series had just four stories comprising 25 episodes) and you had a recipe for a show lost in a wave of insurmountable odds and a show cut short before it`s time. Dr Who could have easily been relegated to a quirky little black and white show that ran for a few years back in the 1960's...releases decades latter on DVD in a ""Shmultzee"" little compellation box set with a toy Dalek. Or worse yet it could have been wipe away all together if the show had not survived past it's first decade.

  Enter the great Jon Pertwee with his tall, imposing frame, Flaming white hair , James Bond persona and some Venusian Uja to boot. Pertwee took on the role with Gusto and made it his own and in some ways change the depth and propensity of Doctor who itself/himself. Not the old sage or the clown was Pertwee's portrayal of the Doctor but the hero; Or dare I say the super hero. So confidant was his portray of Doctor Who at times the viewer may have wondered if there was a big ""S"" under under his cloak and frill shirt and a red cape in the trunk of old Bessie.

  Pertwee didn't just save the Earth from galactic evil-doers he saved the show it self from being a one-decade wonder and propelled the show to new heights and ultimately to the Iconic status the show now enjoys. So much of the shows dogma was either re-created or enhanced during the Pertwee era ( a pause here to also give a huge nod to the great Barry Letts who had a something to do with it as well). From the start we were given the Autons who became permanently ingrained in our sub-conscious with their frightening embodiment of lifeless object. They only appeared twice during the Pertwee era but their legacy will remain with the show to the end (The fact the the new series started with an Auton story proves this). Next of course the Pertwee era gave us The Master played with villainous vigor by the late, great Roger Delgado. Only The Daleks are more synonymous with Doctor Who than The Master and for many fans he is the Doctor's ultimate foe. The sub-terrain terrors the Silurian's and the Sea Devils were both created during the Pertwee tenure. Appearing during the Davison and Matt Smith eras, these two creatures still work as villains even today. The war-like Sontarians also first came to fruition while Pertwee was at the helm as did two of the best companions the show has ever seen in Jo Grant and Sara Jane Smith. The later of course still relevant and immensely popular today returning several time to the program plus staring in her own show the Sara Jane adventures. Last is the  (then) emerging lore of the time lords themselves. The term Galifrey was coined during Jon Pertwee's The Time Warrior and the concept of the Doctor meeting his past incarnations came to be during Pertwee's fourth season opener The Three Doctors.

  Alas, What does all this have to do with Planet of the Spider? In a word: Everything. Pertwee's finale brings together (for one last time) most of the elements of what made his ere so great: UNIT, a mostly Earth bound story, gadgets, a cheesy villain, a fellow time lord and one of the best chase scenes the show ever had. Is this episode a Five star classic like Caves of Andrazani or Pyramids of Mars? No. But from the opening scene's  ""gong""  we immediately sense the approaching doom pulling the doctor to his ultimate fate.  The story has a pace less suited to hasten the story and more to pay homage to it's star. The acting and character development for guests and regulars are solid in the story but the Star is Pertwee and he is given plenty of plot devices to make one final curtain call. Don't expect a classic monster here as the Spiders, and the giant spider herself, are some of the Cheesiest creatures the show has ever seen. If I can say one positive thing about them at least they weren't made of tin foil. While they do little to add to the story they certainly don't detract from it.

 Long time fans , Pertwee fans and Completion-ists will of course buy this episode but to the newer, younger fans who maybe haven't seen it before I would say buy it. Planet of the Spiders is an essential part of the show's history. It is the last chance to see how Jon Pertwee took a show that was destined for greatness and then solidified it's greatness.... before passing it on to a worthy and equal successor....",1296604800,,5433,4.457661290322581

552653,4,6303058884,"This is not one of the best Dr Who stories in my opinion. I bought this on VHS because I wanted to have something of DR Who and something of Jon Pertwee. This is Jon Pertwee's last appearance as Dr Who until the Five Doctors. He gets replaced by Tom Baker who plays the fourth doctor, although in my opinion not as good as Jon Pertwee who is the best.
I didn't find the story that interesting about the spiders as I don't like insects of any kind and the fact that they can talk is ridiculous. When the Doctor and Sarah got to Metebelis III it looked suspiciously fake to me as the landscape looked like giant posters with black spots on them.
This story goes for two and a half hours and it is drawn out. Not a very good ending for Jon Pertwee but suppose if you're desperate to watch some DR Who and Pertwee, then you could probably do worse like the Daemons story. I recommend Claws of Axos, Terror of the Autons, Three Doctors, Day of the Daleks and Death to the Daleks.",1046044800,,974,4.1861702127659575
552654,5,6303058884,"i have given this Jon Pertwee story five stars because in many ways it was one of the best stories that he, himself portrayed and must count as one of the best Doctor Who's ever.
I have to admit to not being a Pertwee fan. My preference has always been for Pat Troughton or Tom Baker. However, one thing cannot be taken away from Pertwee - he certainly brought the series up to date, keeping and expanding it's audience at the same time.
The story is a culmoination of a series of shows which seemed to have begun in the penultimate season of Pertwee's third Doctor. It brings together a number of strands which had been threaded together over the Pertwee years and which were to grace this six part adventure.
Clearly the most conspicuous of these strands was the return of the blue crysatl from Jo in the Amazon. However, there was the Tibetan connection which began in the early UNIT days when Troughton was the Doctor in the early Yeti story. The Tibetan link was also strengthened by the growing drip feed of Gallifrey lore which had begun with the demise of the second Doctor and had continued throughout the Pertwee years. On a production note, the increased location work and the use of vehicles climaxed in the extended chase scene which occupied a lengthy segment of this last Pertwee story.
The story itself gave a little insight into the Doctor's travels which later manifested itself in a Tom Baker story which may be subtitled as what happens when I come back to a planet later on in time.
Overall the Planet of the Spiders was a recognition of the new audience that was following the show. The dandyish overtly heroic Doctor and the more glamorous companions together with the latest toys drew many more young adults to the show. This new audience brought with it a new level of sophistication which was reflected in the show's concerns. Less obvious lecturing and more obvious entertaining seemed to be the order of the day.
Most of all Planet of the Spiders reflected the need for Pertwee to end his Doctor Who days with the regognition of his accomplishments. The story line is charged with some of the issues of the day such as the importance of alternative remedies to the issues of the stress of work and the more complex world reality. The female nature of the spiders themselves and the subjugation of the male slaves on Metabilis tells an interesting story of the growth of feminism in the UK ( especially given the chauvinistic tendencies of Pertwee's Doctor)
All in all the story builds to a conclusion which may have possibly included the death of the Doctor. Instead it concluded with an ending that presented significant opportunities for the actor who was to take over the role.
This adventure kept my attention throughout. I must concur with those who see that the chase was overly long but that surely was a feature of most of the Pertwee stories.
Hindsight often enables us to see things differently from those who underwent the experience almost thirty years ago. As a viewer since the first episode appeared on the BBC I can only review this show the way I saw it.",1034121600,,3099,4.636363636363637
552655,4,6303058884,"Jon Pertwee gets a pretty good sendoff in the Planet of Spiders, Likely not as good as he deserved but still worth your time.
  We see the Doctor FINALLY reach the blue planet that he has been talking about for two seasons.  Yet it is a planet with problems, specifically it is being ruled by spiders who are enslaving the humans.
  The plot turns involving the meditation center, the other timelord and Mike Yates are interesting, as is the final regeneration scene, I did take exception to one bit of the plot.
  It seem strange that the Doctor knowing that the Queen Spider is about to doom herself, while trying to become the most powerful creature in the world would put himself into such danger to try to talk her out of it.  If he succeeds she will continue to be a menace.  This seems to forshadow Tom Baker more than the quite practical Jon Pertwee.  The psycological factor is played well, but I still don't buy it.
  Pertwee was a long running doctor, he would give way to the longest running (and in my opinion the best) doctor, and sometimes that gives him short shift in comparison.  This is unfair.  Pertwee was a class act, a class actor, and a class doctor.",1023062400,,1174,4.450704225352113

552658,2,6303058884,"""Planet of the Spiders"" is an interesting idea that unfortunately does not succeed in realisation. The fundamental problem is its length - six episodes is way too long, a shortcoming made evident by padding that draws some scenes out with an excrutiating slowness. The story is also failed by a plethora of drably sketched and portrayed characters. In fact, there are only a few that can be considered interesting. Lupton is brilliant; an embittered man whose retrenchment from his profession led him to seek power. Perhaps this is not the most realistic of reasons; it surely wouldn't lead people to such megalomania, but John Dearth's performance gives him credibility. Mike Yates, now retired from UNIT, finally gets to become a three dimensional person. His soul searching is the catalyst for the whole story and throughout he is so much better than the public school officer he was during the Pertwee/UNIT years. Tommy is the other interesting character - although in these politically correct times, one wonders how he would be portrayed today. (Most probably a famous Hollywood actor would play his role and win an Oscar for it!) Tommy's role is centrally symbolic - he is the portrayal of innocence and the healing power of the crystal, but I wonder if the use of a character for this sole purpose is justifiable. Apart from these characters, there is nobody else remotely interesting. The men at the monastery are underdeveloped (more missed opportunities for further genuinely fleshed out characters), but the cliche awards go to the settlers on Metebelis Three. They are simply awful, with hackneyed accents and truly dreadful acting. As mentioned earlier, the pace is extremely slow; the best example being the chase that takes up most of episode two. It goes on far too long. Yes, Jon Pertwee, the man of action, was leaving his five year role as Doctor Who, but his final pseudo-James Bond action scenes are just too much of an overindulgence. Pertwee's last performance as the Doctor is certainly not his best - he looks as if he can't wait to get out of there, and even the lovely Elisabeth Sladen seems unenthused with this story. The story is a Buddhist parable, with abundant symbolism, but the messages lack subtlety - I have no objection to a writer's religious beliefs coming through their scripts, but abject sermonising gets a bit heavy handed. The monk Cho-Je doesn't help, spouting fortune cookie philosophy every time he opens his mouth. Effects wise, the spiders are hit and miss. Sometimes they look genuine, sometimes they are ridiculous. The spiders' politics is another dreary subplot and the Great One is hardly the stuff of nightmares. ""Planet of the Spiders"" is not the best way to end the Jon Perwtee era. It is an interesting concept, sloppily made and ultimately a disappointment.",980035200,,2818,4.9724576271186445

The spider 'high council' are like something straight out of  Childrens' TV.
True, there are some more serious and memorable moments -  the mind-link scenes, the ideas behind the blue cystal, and the final  scenes involving the showdown between the Doctor and the Great One, not to  mention his inevitable regeneration, are gripping and make for tense,  involving viewing.

This is one of the better story lines with an above-normal inter-woven plot and enough action to make each episode very interesting!

This is a must-have for fans of Classic Doctor Who.

The story is a milestone in the series due to it being the last for Jon Pertwee's 3rd Doctor.  It is action-filled and features the completed Whomobile flying through the air.  (It had appeared previously with a different and temporary top that had been quickly made to meet recording deadlines.)

The episode features Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen), the Brigadier (Nicholas Courtney), (former) Captain Yates (Richard Franklin), and Sergeant Benton (John Levene).  It ties up the story arcs featuring the blue crystal from Metebelis 3 (first mentioned in ""Carnival of Monsters"", and actually shown in ""The Green Death""), and Captain Yates's fate after his involvement in the events detailed in the ""Invasion of the Dinosaurs"".

Extras include:

Audio Commentary by Elisabeth Sladen, Nicholas Courtney, Richard Franklin, Barry Letts (producer/director), and Terrance Dicks (script editor).

Production Note Option

Digitally remastered pictures and sound quality.

The picture and sound are very good.  They are on a par with most of the early Tom Baker episodes.  The original, high quality broadcast master videotape was retained by the BBC.  (It was never erased like many of the early Pertwee episodes.)  This allowed it to be used as the source for  the digital master of this DVD.",1505692800,,2467,5.34025974025974

7836502,5,6303058884,"Excellent adventure, one of the best Doctor Who stories ever!

Exemplary production, very precise and polished.
Videography is impressive, almost artistic.
So many elements come together in such a harmonious way to tell this sophisticated story.
I'm not all that familiar with Jon Pertwee's Doctor but I assume the writers used everything that made his tenure interesting in this work.
The James Bond concept is put to great use here, it adds tremendous fun overall.
All the characters are very individual and well defined, portrayed by sincerely talented actors.
It's very gratifying to see them all reacting to each other in such natural, sensible ways.
The character of Tommy in particular is a challenging role.
He is changed from harmless idiot to intelligent hero by the mysterious power of the blue Metebelis 3 crystal and it is totally believable! An acting tour de force, genuinely emotional. He actually makes you care that new doors have opened for Tommy and yet so much time has passed by....
Elisabeth Sladen also gives a superb performance here, maybe her best ever.
The human villains are played to perfection, even the Spider Eight Legs  are impressive.
I'm disappointed that British actors were cast to play the roles of Tibetans K'anpo Rimpoche and Cho-Je. Why not go with authentic Oriental actors?
A lack of cultural and ethnic diversity, the weakest point of Doctor Who unfortunately.

Anyway, after being fatally injured by exposure to the Metebelis blue crystal the Tardis rematerializes on Earth and the Doctor stumbles out saying he got lost in the Time Vortex, the Tardis had brought him home, while Sarah and the Brigadier watch.
While dying the newly regenerated Time Lord Cho-Je appears and explains the Doctor will do the same but he will give the process a little push that will shake up his brain cells a little, making his behavior somewhat erratic.
And then we see Mr. Tom Baker appear, the era of the Fourth Doctor begins....

An amazing farewell and debut.

This may well be the most lovingly crafted Doctor Who story ever.
Everyone involved are definitely on the same page and they truly do care.
Planet Of The Spiders is one of the most sincere displays of affection I have ever seen in Television history.

Beautiful.
