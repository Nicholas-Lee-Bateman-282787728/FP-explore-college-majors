1685241,4,B000062Y1D,"This film deals with a young girl's realization that she is gay.
I strongly feel it is a film that everybody should watch, especially parents of gay children and gay and straight teenagers. Important issues are dealt with in a tasteful, sensitive manner. It is educational and eye-opening without being too preachy or threatening to straight audiences.
We see the main character, Jane, deal with her first lesbian relationship and the ensuing heartbreak once the relationship ends. We see how Jane learns to deal with the homophobia from her classmates and friends. Most importantly, we see how Jane's family reacts and deals with her homosexuality.
Where I feel the realism breaks down a bit is that fact that Jane has two gay role models to help her through difficulties: her mother's gay friend (played by RuPaul), and a sympathetic English teacher who confronts Jane's parents at one point. I don't think most gay teens are so fortunate as Jane. Still, this movie may help to serve as a tool for gay teens to come out to their parents. This movie will also help those parents as well, since they'll see that much of what they're feeling are portrayed by Jane's two parents. This film is recommended by PFLAG and made with their cooperation.",1034553600,6,1244,4.845070422535211
1685242,5,B000062Y1D,"I saw this video one day at my local video store and thought hey that looks interesting most Gay and Lesbian movies are serious but have a fun side to them as well like ""Love, Valour, & Compassion"". So I told myself I would get it the next time I came back well it wasn't in so I finally bought the DVD. I was not ready I have seen a lot of tough movies in my life but I could barely make it through this one. The fact that it was basedd on actual events just amplified it and I have never despised a character so as I did of Stockard Channings role as mother to Jane (Ellen Muth).
  Although I must confess that I did get a great amount of joy during the dinner scene where Jane's brother calls her a dyke and she reaches across the table and throughs him across the room.
  There is a lot of pain in this movie so be ready for it and tell everyone you know to watch so they can feel the real pain that some are forced to live ever day especially young teens. Then buy the Sweedish film ""Show Me Love"" for a gentler version but with much more excepting parents and she gets her love in the end.
  Enjoy!",1034380800,10,1104,3.9728506787330318
1685243,5,B000062Y1D,"i usually don't take time to fill out these reviews, but i think this movie is worth the time. it's a great movie, whether or not you're gay. i myself am a straight 17 yr old female, but it helped me see what others go through, and it helped my friend who recently realized she is a lesbian. everyone should see this, it teaches us about what so many people go through, as well as how we can be more tolerant. i recommend it to neone who likes to see movies about reality and life. :)",1026518400,38,484,4.052083333333333

1685252,5,B000062Y1D,"The truth  about Jane is a story about a young girl who discovers that she likes girls. I get this story five stars because 1.) The story starts off like any other persons life. The kid is basically perfect and different, 2.) because she overcame the impossible, and 3.) because this is my favorite movie, and it reminds me of the time in high school when i questioned my sexuality. I came out to my mom but at 18 she denied it....i came to her at 23 and she was sort of accepting....but not all the way....i am a proud Pansexual, and i am married to the love of my life. She is very open minded, and my mom finally accepted me for me. Whenever i watch this movie it reminds me of the time where I questioned myself. This is why i gave it 5 stars....it is inspiring!!!",1478390400,5,768,4.154362416107382

1685263,5,B000062Y1D,"Thank you soooooo much, Amazon Prime! This one was my FIRST GAY MOVIE when I watched on Lifetime channel way back in 2001. I downloaded this movie on VHS when it filmed again. Over the years, I tried to find a DVD with CC via gay and lesbian store, Amazon, BN, movies store, and book stores but no luck. Unexpectedly, I found The Truth about Jane on Amazon Prime this morning at 1 am while I looked for movies to watch. My gosh, I MUST have it without a doubt! I purchased first thing and watched this movie afterwards. This movie totally changed my life when I was 17.

1685280,5,B000062Y1D,"I'm not bi or gay, I just happened to catch this movie while I was watching Lifetime one day.  I was immediately interested and simply HAD to buy it.

I love the fact that the movie is told from the main character's point of view.  ""Jane"" basically narrates her life and what she's going through throughout the movie - from her first love to her first sexual experience with another girl to thinking something was 'wrong with her' because she wasn't attracted to guys and, most importantly, the hurt she was feeling as the people she cared about (mainly her parents) seemed to refuse to accept her for who she was, constantly tried to change her (thinking therapy would make her ""straight"") and keeping her from seeing her first girlfriend.  The broken heart she suffered after she lost her first love and feeling that her family ""hated"" her because she was a lesbian were very heart-tugging moments of the movie.

She goes through so much at such a young age, but her life-story basically indicates that what doesn't kill you DOES make you stronger.

I think ANYONE can benefit from this film - whether it's gay people who have or have not revealed who they truly are and their families & friends.  Of course, straight people can certainly get the message from this movie as well - it brings up feelings & issues that many straight people probably never even considered.

During this film, you experience Jane's life right along with her - from the time she's born until the present time.  You actually see things through HER eyes and begin to feel what she's feeling and going through thanks to her ""commentary"" during the movie.

It has it tear-jerker moments, and even funny/humorous moments as well.  At certain parts of the movie, I couldn't help but feel for Jane and, although I'm not a lesbian, I COULD feel what she was going through.  One quote in the movie is ""Jane's only crime is that she loves differently.""

Even if you're not gay or don't know anyone who is, you can't help but be affected by this film.  You live Jane's rollercoaster of life right along with her, and that's not something many movies provide or offer to the viewer.  There were moments when I just wanted to jump in my TV, give Jane a big hug and offer to do whatever I could to help her with all the emotions she was going through and dealing with.",1336694400,3,2334,4.55023923444976
1685281,5,B000062Y1D,this is a great movie it gives you a little look into the world of how scary coming out can be and how life turns out but not in the way expect and even tho being who you are is something to be proud of life is still full of disapointment,1313452800,,238,3.6862745098039214
1685282,4,B000062Y1D,"For a made for tv movie, this movie is very well done. I think channing, ellen muth, and ru paul present the topic of exceptance of a very taboo subject very well. There are some under currents that I personnally don't agree with but overall a good movie that may help parents to understand that you don't always have to agree with your child's choices but at times you may have to except them. also I find that the presentation of the increased stress that parents and pier's can apply to young adults is done very well. This was the first movie that I saw ellen muth perfomance in. I think that she will have a long and excellant career. Ru pauls performance in this movie is outstanding, to the point when I first saw it I did not realize that was rupaul, he is not over the top flamboient. Which really shows is acting ability. Stockyard channing is outstanding in presenting a mothers conflict dealing with the choices of her daughter both conservatively and socially. A very good movie that covers a taboo subject that can be seen by the entire family.",1301616000,,1058,4.487046632124352
1685283,4,B000062Y1D,"If this film starred anyone other than the adorable Ellen Muth and the dynamic Stockard Channing, we'd be looking at a one-star review. This film is so poorly written and stretched out. But, the acting transcends all of it. Ellen Muth's facial expressions are priceless. With the furrow of her brow, I can see an inner turmoil that surpasses the awful script. Stockard Channing has always been brilliant in everything that she does, and this movie is no exception. The juxtaposition of her friendship with Ru Paul and her inability to accept her daughter was priceless.

The Truth About Jane is an excellent film. Add another star if you find those old ""after-school-specials"" interesting!",1283817600,,689,5.043859649122807
1685284,5,B000062Y1D,"This movie is excellent. It gives a complete view of the coming out expirience without sugar coating. The main character, Jane, goes through the main events that any teenager would when grappling with the realization that they're gay. Jane seeks guidance from her English teacher, Ms. Walcott, Whom Jane learns is also a lesbian. Ms. Walcott provides more reality to the story, because so many young gay people have somebody in their life similar to her. This movie has been labeled as ""cheesy"" or ""overly dramatic"" I cannot disagree more. Yes, this movie has very emotional moments, realistic through and through.

I was lucky enough to catch this movie on television one day, I wasn't expecting much for this being a Lifetime Movie. As I wached more of this movie, I learned my expectations were way too low. The Truth About Jane surprised me and touched me emotionally with every scene. If you're worried this film will be predictible or unrealistic,
don't be. The Truth About Jane is by far the best coming out/gay teen movie I have ever seen. You don't have you don't have to be gay to enjoy this movie, just an open mind.

Knowing this was always the case she grapples with the difficlties of coming out to her peers and and family. Janes mom (Stockard Channing) cannot accept her daughter's homosexuality and the film showcases the struggle of what it must be like to come out to your family at such a young age. The film was touching and dealt with alot of hard issues. Ellen Muth and Stockard Channing were wonderful in thier parts of the story. The film had a bit of a cheesey feel to it being a lifetime movie but the two leading ladies kept some respectability to the film.

1685293,5,B000062Y1D,"What makes this title outstanding is the convincing play of all actors, because the story itself is rather trivial. The most important factor seems to me, that in addition to the problems of a young lesbian woman (treated in other movies) the explosive power for the relation of her parents is shown.

1685295,5,B000062Y1D,"I didn't see this movie until recently, mainly because of the subject matter and my parents. You see, I ""came out"" to my parents this summer, but they don't believe me and feel that it is a phase, or that I am just doing this out of rebellion. ""Jane"" made me feel somewhat better, because I realized that many young lesbians go through this. I almost wish I had been honest with myself earlier, and not gone on dates with boys to make my mom proud of me.  This movie's made me realize that one day I will have to just tell her strongly, and she can go from there. But I don't think my mom will even be as open as Stockard Channing's character is in the movie, because of her, and my, religious convictions, which she considers contradictory.  Anyway, that's all for my rant.

Bottom line: This movie is great, and for all it's corniness, it's sometimes what is needed by a person. And I love the line at the end ""Dad, just because I'm a lesbian, it doesn't mean I have a sudden interest in sports"", because it makes the statement that you are the same person you always were, but now can be yourself in EVERY aspect of life.",1165104000,4,1124,4.267605633802817

I know that high school can be awesome and stressful sometimes. But when Jane discovers her secert... she reveals that she's gay. She falls in love with another girl. But then she finds out that the girl said that she didn't love her. Jane was heart broken when they broke up. No one would understand about Jane. She goes to her teacher's house and she tells her that she wants to kill herself. But she doesn't after all.

This movie has a message. There are people who love differently. But I don't think I would have sex with another girl. That's very sick! But I think that this movie is a very great story. This movie is for all teenagers. I really love this movie.",1163462400,,830,4.286624203821656
1685297,5,B000062Y1D,"After watching DEAD LIKE ME for two seasons we knew Ellen Muth's cracked honeycomb of a voice, and flicking through the channels we wondered if this was some ""lost episode"" of DEAD LIKE ME but instead, we saw Stockard Channing as her mother instead of that cold hearted Cynthia Stevenson, so we settled in for the duration to see how DEAD LIKE ME would have played out if Georgia had been a lesbian, and if her mother had been Rizzo from GREASE.  There's one point in THE TRUTH ABOUT JANE when you will swear Stockard Channing feels compelled to belt out ""There Are Worse Things I Can Do,"" especially when her daughter asks her if she graduated from high school without having sex.

Another star of note is the exquisite Kelly Rowan, who later went on to play Kirsten Cohen on The O.C.  Here she looks even more fabulous if that's possible as the dedicated high school English teacher.  She acts so totally real you could swear she was a real teacher, except for one thing, she is too chic.  In her little black cocktail dress and a perfect white shell cardigan, and little black heels, she is the teacher of a young girl's dreams.  In the story of the movie, Jane is having a terrible time of it trying to come to terms with a new found desure to be with Taylor, the new girl in town, 24 hours a day.  Taylor's mom is a complete psycho and beats her up all the time.  However for sheer human awfulness, there's no one quite like poor Jane's younger brother Brad.

First he spies on Taylor and Jane while they are kissing. Then he tells everyone at school so that Jane becomes the victim of virulent homophobia and her parents wind up getting anonymous phone calls informing them that their daughter is having an affair with a female classmate!  Stockard Channing doesn't know who to believe.  Though she's a cool mom in many ways, she's also rigid as a fencepost when it comes to Jane and her sexuality.  She's certain Jane is straight and can't see it any other way.

Luckily the divine Kelly Rowan is in Jane's corner.  I'm not surprised that this movie led to bigger and better parts for La Rowan, it is the dictionary definition of a breakout part.

And now, can anyone tell me what happened to our wonderful Ellen Muth?  She seems to have fallen right off the face of the earth ever since wrapping up DEAD LIKE ME.

1685300,5,B000062Y1D,"I never heard about this movie until this year when we watched it in GSA. (For those of you who don't know what GSA is, it stands for Gay-Straight Alliance). Now I am straight; however, many of my very good friends are gay or bi-sexual. I am also a very big supporter of rights; as well as, gay marriage becuase I don't see why if two people love each other and want to get married, why they should be denied that rights based on their gender and the opinions of closed-minded people.

This is a about a 15-year-old named Jane, who fiqures out that she is gay. She finds out this about herself when she meets a new girl at school named Taylor. Even though her mother's best friend is gay, that doesn't mean she doesn't freak when she hears that her daughter is gay. Jane eventually gets her mom to join PFLAG, which is Parents and Friends of Gays and Lesbians.

The girl who plays Jane you might remember from the show DEAD LIKE ME. Her mom is played by Stockard Channing who is from GREASE and ISN""T SHE GREAT. This is a movie I recommend to anyone; however, if you are one of the closed-minded people who think that being gay is inhuman, this moive is not for you.",1119744000,11,1166,4.271493212669683

janes father stands up for jane and the mother is really hurt and confused but in the end the mother eventually stops hating her daughter and tries to cope with her daughter she loves so much being gay this is a must see movie!!!

by the way im totally against being gay too not only because its gross which it is but God says that people of the same sex should not be sexually involved with each other at all and i agree just read the bible!",1113177600,3,1368,4.119850187265918

She has a gay teacher to whom she turns to instead of sucide. And it took that fore her parents to say hey, this is my child no matter waht. And it was a hard thing for her mom to except. But in the end, she does begin to except it. This movie hits reality hard. There are so many who are going thou or who ave already been throu the  same thing.

1685303,4,B000062Y1D,"Okay, I admit.  I'm a straight guy with a penchant for lesbian-themed movies.  Sue me.  ""The Truth About Jane"" has a lot of very serious flaws.  First of all it could never shake that poorly-funded, independent/made-for-Lifetime Channel feel to it.  Parts of it were extremely cheesy.  As you've probably gathered from other reviewers, this film is also excessively didactic at parts, especially in the end where it quite tragically degrades (almost literally) into a promotional video for PFLAG.

However, despite all these flaws, ""The Truth About Jane"" won me over within the first 20 minutes.  It is truly a moving and wonderful film, with brief moments of brilliance.

The story of course revolves around the young teenaged girl Jane, played by the adorable Ellen Muth.  Jane is like any other girl, except of course she's fallen in love with another girl, and discovers that she is a lesbian.  Muth handles her role very well, creating a believable character with whom we can identify with.  She very successfully portrays the very rough experience that coming-of-age and ""growing pains"" can be, especially when complicated by sexual orientation.

I like how, unlike so many other lesbian-ish characters I've seen in cinema, Jane is not bisexual, nor does she suddenly decides to start liking girls after a lifetime of very happily dating boys.  One of my favourite scenes was early in the movie when the ""cute"" boy comes to court Jane as she sits in the cafeteria with her other female friends.  Whilst her friends throw a fit about how hot the guy is and how Jane should date him, Jane honestly cannot see what the big deal is.  In another very good lesbian-themed movie ""Show Me Love"", Ellin is portrayed as a someone who was just fine dating boys until Agnes showed up in her life, which to me seems contrived.  Poor Jane goes through quite a bit in the course of this movie; not just coming-out pains, but also classic heartbreak that unfortunately goes hand-in-hand with adolescence, no matter who you are.  ""How much can a girl take?"" you ask yourself, and wish that you could just hug her and take her in.

My only problem with her character was her occasional excess in disrespect and acting out against her parents which, while understandable given the circumstances, she could have shown a lot more maturity if she had resisted the urge to stay out drinking until 4:00AM.  (Same problem I had with Agnes' character in ""Show Me Love"") But, I suppose it accurately portrays the rebelliousness of youth.  Funny I think I missed that in my own life.

Jane's relationship with Tyler was believeable, touching, and heartbreaking.  However, this movie isn't about a lesbian coming-of-age romance.  For better or worse, the centrepiece of the story is Jane's relationship with her mother.

Stockard Channing, who plays Jane's mother, is a respected veteran actresses who excels at slow-paced ""chick flick"" dramas.  In the movie she ""shows her chops"", as the expression goes.  Channing brilliantly portrays the excruciating internal turmoil her character faces.  Two conflicting emotions storm within her; her love for her daughter, and her disappointment and fear at what she is.  Jane's mother is a very complex character and challenging to portray.  She is neither a model PLFAG mom, nor is she a heartless fundamentalist who would cast her child out for being gay.  She is ""everymom"", so to speak.  Channing is up to the challenge however, and portrays ever nuance of her character with veteran skill. We are furious at what Channing's character does, yet we cannot hate her, because we understand why she does those things, and what she's going through.  The mother has a good gay friend, yet cannot accept her daughter's homosexuality.  That doesn't make her evil, it just demonstrates that she is a real person.  Real people are not rational creatures.  In fact I applaud the film for not having Jane's mother be spiteful, then jump to total acceptance.  The film is almost...""unapologetic"" at showing what the mother's reactions and actions, which at times are truly disgraceful.  The mother is deeply flawed, and even by the end of the film it is clear she has not yet defeated all of her prejudices.  Yet she tries.  She is a product of her time, and we cannot simply blame her for everything.  Jane's mother's interal journey is every bit as wrenching and tumultuous as that of Jane's, but at the end they both grow tremendously and develop as complex, 3-dimensional characters.

""The Truth About Jane"" is far from a perfect movie.  It is indeed preachy, some might even say it's propagandistic.  Particularly I found the last act of the film to be a little excessive (you'll know what I mean when you see it).  I would have chosen to be a bit more subtle about it if I had made the film.  But I believe it's the kind of propaganda we need, for the sake of righeousness and the moral evolution of our society.  I hope this movie makes it into the hands of some parents of gay children.  And everything aside, it's a very touching and entertaining story about a girl's unique journey growing up, finding herself, and taking her place in the world.",1099699200,82,5164,4.848

I cheered on her dad when he told her mom off and stuck up for Jane.

1685307,5,B000062Y1D,"Sometimes, just rare little times, it happens, that a movie really touches you. This definitly is one.
It dealt with 15 year teenage girl Jane, fell deeply in love for the first time. With another girl, taylor, the new girl in her class, she also had sex with for the first time.
Giving her pretty hard times realizing the fact, that she's gay. As well as her parents, ""friends"", teachers... And, that's nothing about it.
Although these stories are as different and unique, as humans theirselves, many things, that Jane has to struggle thru, came familiar to me and I wished, more people would really consider about.
It's not a teaching movie. Trust me. It has great beauty, dramatic and very intense moments. And funny ones too. My favorite: After her coming out Janes father took her for soccer game, she was never interested in her whole life, to show understanding and get to know his ""new"" lesbian daughter better. After she is refusing, he said: ""I suppose even golf is out of discussion?!"" ('Damn! Not A thing good about it!')
The characters are well played, especially Jane's, I like most. And the actress is very cute. Just the way she's holding her had, when she looks in love. And that voice! Melting.
