4485359,5,B004W5MHLY,"This has to be one of the very best movies in years!  It sneaks up on you. The movie leads you into conclusions you were supposed to make only to turn 180 degrees and then ...even then you're wrong.

To call this a feel good movie is not accurate.  It is that plus a great acting movie. It is great plot, scripted movie.  All the actors surprise you at one time or another... ALL of them, do you hear?  Even John S. tosses some curve balls.

My son is a lifer in the military.... that is NOT why I love this flick.... I feel so connected to it because the writers and the actors, (should I include the director), got everything to work together and up popped a movie my wife and I will never forget.  The movie is presented in a neither Right or Left view of the military....it is balanced and often worldly.

It has world view. It has Christian view.  It has military view.  You will do good for yourself to watch and re-watch this movie.

Come-on, I dare you!!!!  Do something excellent for you, your family and your friends.",1315094400,3,1027,4.2642487046632125
4485360,4,B004W5MHLY,"It was a good film the acting could've been better, Devane and Schneider where well the best two. Having said that, It was a very good story line.  The film is very enjoyable.. Makes you think",1312934400,,192,4.333333333333333
4485361,5,B004W5MHLY,"I ordered this DVD weeks ago.  On Memorial Day I convinced my wife it would be a good movie to watch.  As soon as the movie began, we both realized it was no accident we were watching it on that day.  The actors were so perfect for their individual roles, especially because they were more like real people you meet in your home town.  As the story unfolded, the father and daughter's relationship seemed so special, even as the four brothers complained about hardly knowing their father.  However, as the brothers learned of their sister's stunning sacrifices during the Iraq war, they finally realized she was more than just an army nurse after all.  William Devane's portrayal as the father was so typical of many military veterans whose war stories remain mostly untold.  Although the United States flag was at the center of the story, my wife and I both remarked that the movie could have been titled, ""Faith of My Sister,"" because of the daughter's abiding faith in God throughout her ordeal of terror.  We all need to be reminded of the thousands of military warriors who have laid down their lives to protect our nation from evil aggressors and to preserve our cherished freedoms.  You should watch this movie!",1307232000,13,1218,4.734597156398104
4485362,5,B004W5MHLY,"We watched this movie last night on Memorial Day, and it is the kind of movie that should be watched on that day. The acting was really good and the plot was great.

A woman has a close bond with her stepfather because they both served in the military. Her four stepbrothers are jealous of that relationship, and their jealousy keeps them even further from their biological father. When the man dies, just before the opportunity of his sons to know him better, all the hidden anger and resentment comes out as they are later arguing about who should have the flag that was presented at the funeral.

The stepbrothers make it clear to their stepsister that they don't think much of her military service, saying she wasn't a soldier since she was ""only"" a nurse. Then, through flashbacks of her military service, we learn what she really did in the military and those are the most heartrending parts of the movie. The woman and her husband go to a counselor to help the woman with her PTSD and she relives those times all over again. Those scenes, from the enemy attacks to what happens when the woman and another soldier go through a horrific ordeal, are some of the most intense and well-acted I've ever seen in a military-themed film.

The only things I didn't like about the movie were some of the sudden transitions, such as when we find out some of people in the family were in a car accident. But, really, the acting in this movie is so good that it is hardly noticeable and doesn't detract from the high quality of the acting or the story.

I loved how it was all brought together at the end--how someone from the woman's past was going to help heal the anger and resentment of the brothers, and that they finally learned to honor those who give military service, as should be done. It also makes good points about how hurtful judging without knowledge can be and how important it is to show others love before it's too late.",1306800000,8,1931,4.492877492877493

4485371,5,B004W5MHLY,Great movie.  A surprise ending that brings a dysfunctional family together.  This is not a chic flick.  Would recommend it to both men and women.,1404777600,,146,4.76

4485373,5,B004W5MHLY,"Far under-rated or advertised, this movie displays many sides of internal family differences between brother/sister, service/non-service siblings, parent/child relations, and more.  Not for the weak-of-heart, much of the action in flashbacks does show an up front view of combat and foreign tactics.  Well played and well cast, I would recommend this to both the military and those who need a better understanding of military life.  A keeper.",1398124800,,442,5.567164179104478

4485378,5,B004W5MHLY,"That's right I said God.  This movie is about Faith, family and Country.  It amazes me when you read comments like, ""Poor acting...turned off after 10 minutes...skip this dud.""  :) Then you read the other 17 reviews of people that actually watched the movie..

This is a great movie...with an unexpected twist or two...in fact the end ill take you by storm. This ""dud"" made me laugh, cheer and cry.  If you love your country...if you love God or you are struggling with your faith (which is most of us) and you like tender movies about family...THEN BUY THIS MOVIE TODAY!

Quit crying about poor acting...the worst actor is Arnold Schwarzenegger (Hercules in New York (1970).) and you still go watch him...lol  Why?  Because sometimes we see a movie for more than a stars abilities.  :)",1370304000,2,786,4.720588235294118

4485383,5,B004W5MHLY,"Some criticize the acting in this movie, IF it was deficient, it was overshadowed by the great story and the triumph of standing for Christ in difficult circumstances and in places where it is not popular or accepted.  True faith in Christ makes brave men and women because their trust is in The Lord.",1352073600,2,301,4.574074074074074

4485387,1,B004W5MHLY,"Accidentally rented this instead of Clint Eastwoods ""Flags of Our Fathers"" and after 10 minutes in I realized there was something wrong because the acting was awful and it was like a low budget soap opera. Do not watch because this was such a waste of 10 minutes.",1341100800,,263,4.5
4485388,5,B004W5MHLY,"I am a big fan of military movies, but never have found a movie that tells the story of services so well.

4485389,1,B004W5MHLY,"1.  It continues to amaze me how folks can confuse reviewing a movie vs making critical comments about the subject of the movie.  This is a classic example of how the story of this movie has actual potential.  However, the amazingly awful acting (as well as substandard writing) ruin the entire affair.  For those who are hoping for a solid patriotic type movie, will get the patriotic part in this movie, but will have to suffer through high school level acting (and writing).
2.  A word to the wise, skip this dud.",1337904000,,516,4.565217391304348

4485391,5,B004W5MHLY,"A gripping, heartfelt story of courage and faith, Flag of My Father is the story of Cpt. Judith Rainier, well played by Gigi Erneta, an Army nurse who is suffering from horrific flashbacks due to her POW experiences in the Second Gulf War.  To add to her difficulties, her half-brothers (led by John Schneider and Andrew Sensenig) harbor animosity toward her for being their dad's (William Devane) favorite child, due to their bond of being war veterans and Judith being his only daughter.  These feelings surge to the surface after the sudden death of her father, when the family has to decide as to whom has the right to own their late father's flag and war medals.  As Judith deals with both trying to reconcile herself with her brothers as well as coming to grips with her own PTSD, the brothers discover a stunning revelation and in the process will get another chance at forgiveness and redemption.

Every once in awhile you enter a film with preconceived notions, only to be surprised or even blind-sided at how good and well-done a film actually is.  Flag of My Father is such a film, where the audience goes in and expects the usual well-intentioned but poorly constructed and acted low-budget ""Christian"" film, only to leave stunned by how well the story is presented and acted.  It's a military based drama that gives a voice to our veterans, yet doesn't come off as being too preachy or get bogged down in political statements or sensationalistic elements.  Instead it goes straight for issues of the heart, dealing with not only how a combat veteran deals with the horrors of war but the universal need of each to connect with family and how painful it is for those family bonds to be broken due to trite misunderstandings and jealousies.  It also shows God's redemptive power and how he can heal those broken relationships.  Gigi Erneta is sincere in her portrayal of a physically and emotionally wounded vet, enabling the audience to connect with and identify with her.  John Schneider and Andrew Sensenig, as the lead brothers of Daniel and Ben, take what could have been totally unsympathetic caricatures and make them into real two-dimensional people who are misled by their pride, selfishness and false assumptions.  Kent Jude Bernard is a standout as a fellow POW who is encouraged by Judith's unwavering hope and faith.  And William Devane, in the brief but pivotal part of the Vietnam veteran father, shines and adds poignancy to his role; it's a reminder of how strong and underrated a character actor he is.  Director and writer Rodney Ray, in his first full-length motion picture, shows real talent in knowing how to construct a powerful story and to execute it professionally within the confines of a limited budget and resources.  In a genre often marked with poor quality and technical incompetency, he is clearly a talent to be reckoned with.  It will be interesting to see his future offerings.

Flag of My Father is a great film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking in how it sheds light on the internal and external struggles of some returning vets (and those who don't understand them) as well as the process of healing through faith and forgiveness.  If you want a patriotic film that you can enjoy with your entire family, or just a good, inspirational film in general, be sure to check this gem out today.",1319500800,2,3352,4.811846689895471
4485392,5,B004W5MHLY,"How do adults and children learn to honor the military?  By watching films like ""Flag of My Father"", we get a glimpse of the enormous sacrifices that create both trauma and, if they are fortunate, depth of fullness and meaning in soldier's life.  Where would we be, as a nation, without the millions of Americans, past and present, who have made such great personal sacrifices to keep us free and living our comfortable lives?  One of the things most Americans don't know about is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and the deep damage and difficulty it can cause in these heroes.  ""Flag of My Father"" gives you an enlightening yet gripping look, then goes further to prove the hope for healing, healing not only from the ravages of war, but also from the emotional difficulty that can become family life.  This is an exceptional story that needed to be told.  Everyone in American should see this fillm.",1318464000,,900,4.737179487179487
