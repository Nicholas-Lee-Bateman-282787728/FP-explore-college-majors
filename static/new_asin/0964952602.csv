8725907,5,0964952602,"As an instructor of American History for Columbia State Community College, Columbia, TN, I use Company Aytch in the History 201 course covering material through 1876.  Students generally interpret the book as humorous because of scenes like stealing a hog, eating butter, and attempting to eat rats.  After seeing the video, their interpretation changes to that of a more serious nature.  Using a format as that of a lecturer twenty years after the war, Bob Funk, acting as Sam Watkins,is able to bring out the horror of war, death, and destruction.  He clearly sees every battle and every march in which he participated and is able to impart this to the viewer.  This is an excellent teaching tool.",975715200,5,699,4.889830508474576
