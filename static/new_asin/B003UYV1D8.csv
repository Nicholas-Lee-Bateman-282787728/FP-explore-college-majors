8406308,1,B003UYV1D8,"I am equally annoyed regarding the accessibility of this disc- this is NOT playable in ""all regions"" as described. If this is supposed to be produced on demand, why would you produce a Region 2 DVD for a purchaser in Region 1? Improving movie metadata in the product descriptions is generally an area for improvement on Amazon, I believe.",1408060800,,338,4.745762711864407
8406309,1,B003UYV1D8,What a rip off! Doesn't play at all. Didn't even say in description that it was for a different region. Save your money and save yourself frustration. I am very disappointed. Amazon: Do your customers a favor and be truthful in your descriptions,1304553600,15,245,4.72093023255814
