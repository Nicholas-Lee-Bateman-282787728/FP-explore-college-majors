For those of you who might be seeking this out as an alternative to the long out-of-print BCI/Region 1 set, this release from Spain does NOT contain the original English audio tracks! AUDIO IS IN SPANISH ONLY!

That being said, the transfers of the episodes themselves are superior to the BCI sets, because they come directly from the PAL standard masters (the only masters known to exist), so they do not exhibit the slight picture cropping and standards-conversion that the NTSC episodes on the BCI set have.

Would've been the best-possible set has the releasing company hadn't been so short-sighted as to leave off the English language tracks. Yes, I know this release was meant for Spanish-speaking Spain, but there are many, many instances where a 'foreign' release at least has the original language option available somewhere on the disc (even it not as the default).",1449792000,2,927,5.012987012987013
