8483638,3,B005QROMMO,"SINISTER, the dvd source of RED FORK RANGE, is pretty much noted for their quality releases of early B-Westerns, in fact, they corner the market for providing the best available source material for forgotten and obscure rare films from the 1930s thru the 1960s.

The print for RED FORK RANGE suffers. Soft, blurry at times, voice and framing off-kilter, an exceptional reel thrown in the mix, this is a very rare Wally Wales low budget gem from the early days of sound Westerns, and after purchasing SINISTER B-Westerns for countless years, I can truthfully say that this is probably the best version of RED FORK RANGE that you're ever going to see, unless a major re-mastering (highly unlikely) is in the works sometime soon.

Yeah, most out there could care less, so what? Some creaky old b&w oater bites the dust. So what?

I beg to differ.

I like Wally Wales and try to see as many of his available films as I can. He has a simple charm, much in the Ben Johnson fashion, and his bad man characters (as Hal Taliaferro) also recall Johnson's characters from ONE-EYED JACKS & THE WILD BUNCH.

And I also like creaky old B-Westerns from the early 1930s sound era. There's a certain nostalgic charm present, especially when cheap, low budget stunts are performed ""as is"" without fake computer generated hi-tech cheats.
Somebody actually jumped onto those runnning stagecoach horses for probably next to nothing. And the beauty of it all (poor print withstanding) is that IT'S REAL!!!...Computer generated stunts can never replace the feel of real action!

And so, in closing, I recommend this version from SINISTER.
Soft, yes.
Low sound , yes.
Great, low-budget B-Western entertainment that simply cannot be copied or re-done today, YES, YES, YES!!!

No re-mastering here, just historical significance for those who care.

...What a great shot as Ruth Mix drives the stagecoach in the climatic race and the camera spots Wally Wales on the nearby hill and follows him as he descends the hill and races alongside and boards the stagecoach. Such stuff dreams are made of.",1350518400,2,2068,4.871794871794871
