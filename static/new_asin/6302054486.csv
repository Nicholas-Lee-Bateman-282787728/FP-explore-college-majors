7821124,5,6302054486,I bought this movie for my dad.  He was thrilled.  This order shipped very fast.,1408838400,,80,4.266666666666667
7821125,3,6302054486,"I had this movie in VHS but no longer have a VHS player!  Would love to re-add this to my movie collection as a DVD!!! Another movie I cannot find in DVD form is ""Rude Awakening"" with Cheech Marin and Eric Roberts.  I would hate to see these movies disappear because they are not available in a current format!!
The 3 star rating has nothing to do with the actual movie to which I would give 5 stars... just disappointed in the format.",1382313600,,435,4.228915662650603
7821126,3,6302054486,"This is a lame movie, the only reason I like to watch it is because of the two beautiful women who star in it, Lisa Hartman and Charlotte Lewis.",1267660800,,144,4.0
7821127,4,6302054486,"I remember watching this movie when it first came on t.v back in the 90's.  I loved it then and I love it now.
They just don't make good romantic movies like this anymore.  Gregory Harrison and Lisa Hartman (Black) have awesome chemistry.  The movie is about a yuppy couple getting stranded on a ""deserted"" island and realizing what's really important in life.  If you love cheesy love stories this movie is for you!!!!",1253577600,,419,4.621621621621622
7821128,3,6302054486,"This was a tv movie that was meant to be a romantic comedy and does a so so job of being charming and amusing. But I'll admit the reason I bought it is because I've been in love with Lisa Hartman since I was six and I couldn't pass up watcing her run around on an island basically just wearing a shirt with a bikini underneath. For that alone I'm very happy. To be fair while it is just fluff it is pleasant and has some funny moments, plus I'm sure the ladies will like Gregory Harrison, and I've certainly seen worse ""Stranded on Desert Isle"" comedy so check it out if it's of interest to you.",1229904000,,595,4.094017094017094
7821129,5,6302054486,"I was very surprised at how good this movie was.  It's a light-hearted comedy about two hard workers who decide to take a vacation and end up stranded on an island inhabited by Gregory Harrison.  The romances switch back and forth, and it really has a surpising ending.  Find this video at your local video rental store and watch it, it will make you feel good after seeing it!",990144000,,377,4.434782608695652
7821130,5,6302054486,"Bare Essentials was a good movie, surprisingly.  The area where the movie takes place is spectacular, and the story line is really good.  Lisa Hartman and Mark Linn-Baker are a couple who are workaholics, and want to get away from it all, so they go to a beautiful island resort.  When they rent a boat for the day, they get a little ""caught up in the moment"" and let the boat get off course.  They end up on a deserted island, or so they think.  They run into Gregory Harrison who moved to this island after he was accused of taking money from his company. He has an on-and-off again native girlfriend staying with him too. They all  begin spending time together playing games, trying to make the best out of things. Then the sparks begin to fly, only in the strangest directions, and ends in a way that you wouldn't expect.  I really recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a cute, light-comedy romance that will make you smile when it's over.",989452800,7,955,4.422857142857143
