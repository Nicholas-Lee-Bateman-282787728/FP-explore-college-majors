6068863,5,B00GAXASK8,"DCI Vera Stanhope is rough, untidy, obsessed, but softed in Set 2, brittle as ever in Series 3. She's a female Columbo. Her health is showing her age. But she's a determined sleuth. This new series has four episodes. Teens and older recommended due to violent disturbing scenes. The characters are adapted after mystery novels by Ann Cleeves. The Northumberland filming locale, also the story settings, (the same place as Catherine Cookson stories) is delightful. Cases are as violent as the country is beautiful. Vera's tough enough for the job, most days.

Brenda Blethyn (Atonement, Pride & Prejudice) as Vera, convincingly leads the team. DS Joe Ashworth(David Leon) is the young family man and assistant. Forensics and some very funny dialogue is covered by Billy Cartwright (Paul Ritter). This nucleus cast questions guest stars playing criminals and victims. Really strong acting casts in every episode, too many to mention.

SDH SUBTITLES available/optional for all episodes.
Episode 1: Castles in the Air
Girls'-weekend in isolated country house party ends with Lizzie shot. Why? Alternate target intent? Who? Local night hunter? NE England is Very Stanhope's territory. DS Joe Ashworth & DC Lockhart (Jon Morrison) are at her side, but one has a conflict. Sonya Cassidy (The Paradise) plays Joe's wife in this and the next episode.

2: Poster Child
Two daughters kidnapped after their surgeon dad is murdered. Not easy for the wife (Saskia Reeves -Luther). Vera struggles to find a ""Why?"" Pressure mounts to find the girls in time. Photographer Jonah (Dean Andrews -Life on Mars).

3: Young Gods
DCI Vera Stanhope and team investigate a fiery death & fall from a cliff. An extreme sport gone too far? Murder or misadventure? Multiple grudges make for many suspects. New team member is Shep (Clare Calbraith -Downton Abbey) former MP and also guest stars in the next episode. Watch carefully to catch a very rare Vera smile.

4: Prodigal Son
A Newcastle club stabbing of a cop. Always difficult to loose one of the force. Vera is taken back to past. How far back? Suspect Ross (Ralph Ineson -Harry Potter) and his wife Lisa, the 'girlfriend who got away' (Christine Bottomley -Land Girls & Hope Springs). Liam Cunningham as Sam Harper.

Yes, there will be a season 4, it's already fact.",1387584000,31,2295,5.026315789473684
6068864,5,B00GAXASK8,"This DVD is great.  Vera tries to be gruff and unfeeling, but she's a marshmallow.  She solves crimes by using her intuition.",1387324800,2,125,4.636363636363637
6068865,5,B00GAXASK8,"I fell in love with ""Vera"" in Set One. Pessimistically, or was it realistically, I didn't think the love would last. I'm happy to report that after three sets, the honeymoon isn't over. I remain in love for a couple of reasons; the writing is brilliant and Brenda Blethyn is heavenly. It doesn't hurt that the setting of Northumberland is moody and beautiful, I can almost smell the earthy fragrance of the windswept land, nor that the supporting cast matches Blethyn's skill.

I have long loved the Brits' excellence in this genre of film and t.v. to the point where I have not followed American detective stories in many years. I understand the accents to the point where I think Americans on the telly sound funny. My love and appreciation is pretty simple; I prefer the stories they tell and the way they tell them. For these reasons the British just do it better for me. The actors look like real people look and are brilliantly believable in the roles they play. I think this is because the writing and casting is spot on. Apparently, my tastes run to their tastes. If I want crime-solving, gun-wielding, super-models I'll tune into something American. I understand why they have an audience, but they are not for me. Different strokes for different folks. Programs like Vera are what ring my bell.

I love puzzles and people are my favorite kind. I have the unfortunate tendency to analyze everything and everyone. And I can't help but do this with what I view and read. The reason I think the writers of this series are excellent is because their main character remains true to who she was created to be. This series is about Vera. So far there has been no slippage from real, to unbelievable, to farce. Vera is a kindred spirit to those similarly afflicted. I see her cloak of protection and I recognize it. She makes sense to me. She is damaged and marching on.

Vera is driven. I cannot help but wonder about what or who is driving driven people. Folks aren't driven by what they are trying to accomplish; they are driven by why they want to accomplish it. I'm not saying the end result isn't important to them, that has to be a given but the why behind it is what fascinates me. I know what is driving Vera, the writers wisely lets the viewer in, little by little, on her reasons. It is real and personal to me. The fact that I ""approve"" of Vera's goals keeps me watching the series. She's definitely wearing the white hat; bad guys only interest me to the extent that understanding them helps the lead characters, the good guys, catch them. It is not my personal taste to enjoy shows about good bad guys or visa versa. I'm really not into the-end-justifies-the-means kind of portrayals. At the very least, I just don't choose to watch them. And I'm so happy to say that Vera spares me from that. The writers give what is, I think, an accurate glimpse of why Vera is driven. Brenda Blethyn's masterful portrayal of a driven overcomer is sheer perfection. Many people use the term survivor to describe folks like Vera, and while I don't disagree with that; to me a survivor is one who has lived through something. This is true by the basic meaning of the word survive. What doesn't kill you doesn't necessarily make you stronger. It can be true of course but, it isn't a given. What makes you stronger is what you do next; after you get up and dust yourself off. It is oh so easy to make your situation worse by doing the ""wrong"" thing next. An overcomer is one who is in the process of bearing up under the weight of the wounds they've sustained in the battles of life and doing the ""right"" thing next. That's just the way I see it, and apparently so does Vera. This agreement in thinking is illustrated in episode one, Castles in the Air. In my experience, there are skirmishes and then there is all-out war!

Over twelve episodes contained in three sets of Vera, clues are revealed to us of what has brought her to where she is in her life; as a person and DCI. She's doing what she believes is the ""right"" thing next. Her behavior is understandable to me. At times it isn't pretty nor excusable but I get her.

Vera is also a thinker. She ponders everything! I can see her brain wrapping itself around the why and the how of the crimes she solves. Life has developed her presuppositions, and they work in the job she does. She uses her innate curiosity in tandem with her understanding of what makes most people tick. She asks the right questions at the right time. She watches and she sees. She listens and she hears. Reading people isn't science whereby the same result can be reproduced over and over again in some laboratory. People are much too complex for that, so she works things through little by little. She sticks like chewing gum to a cat to her belief in evidence, evidence, evidence! Her thoughts nag, nag, nag. She pursues all avenues of her thinking but doesn't jump to conclusions. (Even though Joe would like for her to get some exercise.) She isn't out to get a conviction just for conviction's sake. She doesn't want to live in a world like that. For her, a murderer is a murderer no matter what led them to it or the outright ugliness of the victim. She's damned good at her job.

Vera is not the easiest person to work for; she tends toward the sarcastic, acerbic and impatient. Her team is solid and good at what they do. They have to be because she also tends toward intolerance of anything less. She pushes her people. If you can't perform, keep up, follow orders, (it's not ours to wonder why...) or just take what she dishes out then you'd best put in for a transfer. (And we saw that in a previous episode in Set Two.) Through her relationship with her sergeant, Joe Ashworth, we can see that she isn't so intolerant or arrogant that she won't allow her people to have thoughts of their own. She's just particular.

Vera lives alone, of course, in a remote and isolated ramshackle cottage she inherited from her father. She literally had to shovel it out to live in it. Looking at it, I was surprised that she had electricity and running water! It is a boon that she has cell phone service. I'm sure there is no central heating. It is in this house that she sustained many of the wounds she carries around. This is another hint to what is going on inside her. Living in isolation isn't for wimps but it can be helpful as part of a person's self-defense mechanism. Trust isn't something that Vera does, it is much too risky. I believe that in Vera's mind, trust makes her vulnerable and that's not only unsafe and uncomfortable; she thinks it makes her weak. I must say that she keeps people away as good as I've ever seen it done. But, there are cracks in her chinking. She's let Joe in bit by bit, just as the harsh Northumberland wind whistles through the walls of her father's house. Joe is interesting to me because he doesn't let Vera's orneriness repel him. He is caring and courageous enough to keep going where everyone else fears to tread. He flows through her protestations and subject changes like water through a crack in a dam.

If Vera and Joe were mother and son I'd wonder who the parent is. Vera doesn't take care of herself at all and Joe nags her to do so. It goes without saying that Vera outwardly bristles and snaps at Joe's nagging and ""making a fuss."" I do think though that deep down she's glad that someone cares if she pops her clogs. She obviously cares about him; demonstrating it in a clever way, albeit unseen by anyone, including Joe, at the conclusion of episode one.

David Leon who plays DS Joe Ashworth is quite lovely to look at but that is unimportant in his part and portrayal. I like how his good looks are not part of the story. Joe's a happily married man, to his childhood sweetheart, (trite, I know) and they have three children. I pray to God that the writers keep it like this. I'll definitely be cranky if they deviate. Other returning cast members in Set Three are Kenny who in an episode sports a new ""do"" to help him look younger for his new and younger woman. It doesn't quite work. He's still a damned fine plodder though. We also see again Billy, the pathologist, who is weirdly much too into his job. He's definitely a bit creepy but pathology in general gives me the creeps. (I avoid those programs where half of my time is spent with my eyes closed because blood and innards make me sick.) I enjoy Billy's wit and his falsetto singing isn't too shabby either. I got a kick out of his ""singing"" scene as well as his new ring-tone for Vera's calls. Making a return to the show is Shep, short for Shepherd, whom we first saw as Captain Shepherd in Series 2's Sandancers. She has left the military for the CID.  Shep is a female detective who shows some guts in taking Vera's, let's say, managing style. She holds her own and fits in nicely. I hope she makes a return in Set Four, which cannot come soon enough for me!

As this is Set Three, I am assuming that you've seen Set One & Two. My review is based on that premise, that you know the basic gist of what this series is about. If you have not,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vera/dp/B0050N0US4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vera</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vera-Set-2/dp/B008OTTTP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vera: Set 2</a>&nbsp;Enjoy! Just in case: My copy is a UK format DVD. I have a multi-regional DVD player, which are sold here on Amazon...I think I spent $50 for mine. (I also read in a review that some, not all, but some DVD players can be altered to become multi-regional. Google should be able to help you there.  ***PLEASE READ the informative and helpful comment attached to this review regarding ""hacking"" region one DVD players!***) I only mention this because I have noticed some confusion regarding this a time or two in reviews for other UK DVD's. So, if you are wondering how I've seen this before it has been released in the US...

Each episode has a good mystery to be solved with some sharp portrayals of revenge, atonement, abuse, betrayals, and misunderstandings. Basically, the compost of life. I also want to tip my hat to the writers, once more, for not annoying me with some supervisor hanging over Vera's shoulder haranguing, sniping, winging, blaming, and taking credit for her work. So, ta for that.

***Possible Spoiler***

Finally, I'll share that out of the plethora of fine scenes, my favorite involves Vera, a bottle of whiskey and a nun. (And no, they don't go into a bar...)

6068866,5,B00GAXASK8,"The best mysteries transcend the genre to encompass a wide range of life-issues. These four new episodes of ""Vera: Set 3"" explore this complexity beautifully. Filmed in clouded northern light, with nuanced shades of human emotion, ""Vera"" is a tremendous visual and imaginative treat. Always superb, Brenda Blethyn is the driving, elemental force that is Detective Chief Inspector Vera Stanhope: salt of the earth. Blethyn's face is as expressive and interesting as the blustery northern English landscape, weathering storms of conflict within and without. This superb actor grew up in unpretentious, working-class circumstances, and she brings that wealth of experience to her role. DCI Vera Stanhope's unresolved pathos over her lonely life underlines the narrative. Slugging down whisky under sullen clouds, Vera once declared that solitude is not for the faint-hearted. Northumberland is another character, its rolling hills and rough coastline, the heavy line of the sea, castle ruins, and towns hit hard by decades of economic hardship, providing a unique canvas for these mysteries. Houses huddle under a leaden sky that slams down at the end of the street, a permanent dead-end. The northern dialect, strewn with a heritage of Viking remnants, is as hefty and delicious as meat-pies and ale. Northumberland's northern light and wave-tossed seascapes provide a timelessness to the human narrative strewn upon the landscape.

The haunting soundtrack, by Ben Bartlett, adds an ominous depth to the series. The marvelous Brenda Blethyn is amazing as Vera, she and the rest of the talented crew authentically bring alive the mystery novels of Ann Cleves. The series is further enlivened by a great cast. David Leon is excellent as Detective Sergeant Joe Ashworth, coping with Vera's dark moods and worrying over her health. Jon Morrison plays long-suffering Detective Constable Kenny Lockhart, Paul Ritter is great as the creepy Pathologist Billy Cartwright, Sonya Cassidy perfectly depicts Sergeant Joe Ashworth's wife Celine, and Clare Calbraith is newcomer DC Rebecca Shpherd. In the U.K., theater, movie, and television productions value actors who are robustly, deeply human, and provide venues like this series that share this wealth of talent. All the guest stars are top-notch.

The four episodes include: ""Castles in the Air,"" ""Poster Child,"" ""Young Gods,"" and ""Prodigal Son."" Running time: approximately 352 minutes. Note: English subtitles are helpfully provided. Thankfully, ""Vera"" has been renewed for a 4th season.

Castles in the Air: Written by Paul Rutman & Gaby Chiappe, this mystery opens with the death of physiotherapist Lizzie Faulkner (Eva Quinn). Lizzie was enjoying a retreat with her friends, when she's brutally shot to death outside their vacation rental at Meadow Pond. DCI Vera Stanhope (Brenda Blethyn) impatiently notes that ""bloody lampers"" have been lurking about the surrounding hills, shooting local wildlife. Robert Doran (Richard Riddell) comes under suspicion, as his cigs, DNA, and gun match elements found at the scene. It turns out that DS Joe Ashworth (David Leon) and Doran have a history together, complicating the situation further. And it appears that Lizzie may not have been the intended target; the motive could possibly hark back to a previous incident, years ago. A grieving husband, Justin Bishop (Shaun Dingwall,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who/dp/B00ANDDBBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who</a>), may be involved, whilst his son Sam (Alexander Arnold) keeps an even keel. Frustrated with the investigation, Vera declares that you can't ""shave a pig and call it a ham."" In one wonderful scene, she shows a particular concern for Joe, that involves burning something...

Poster Child: Written by Paul Rutman, this story takes us to Tynside and Newcastle. After their father is brutally killed, Karen Marsden (Amy Cameron) and her adopted, diabetic sister Mira (Shifaa Aafan) are kidnapped. Their mother (Saskia Reeves) frantically calls in DCI Vera Stanhope and her team at the Northumberland & City Police. Jonah Regan (Dean Andrews,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-On-Mars-U-K/dp/B0038M2SAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life On Mars, U.K.</a>), a mysterious photographer, seems to know more than he lets on, while an illegal immigrant, Malik (Amir Boutrous), is struggling with his demons. The stark landscape, with violently blue clouds and sea, is a perfect backdrop to this story of loss and identity.

Young Gods: Written by Gaby Chiappe, this mystery opens in Northumberland's autumn woods. A group of students witness the awful death of Gideon Frane. Vera and DS Joe Ashworth (David Leon) give a lift to one of the young students, Ruthie Culvert (Rebecca Benson), who lives in a chaotic home with her grieving mother (Matilda Ziegler) and grandfather (Kenneth Colley), who is ex-CID. With this third mystery, we finally are given a serving of what there should be more of: time with Vera in her cottage. Thirteen minutes in, she's frying sausages. Too often, Vera drinks her dinner. She and Joe interview Gideon's old girlfriend Izzy Rawlins (Jodie Comer), who he had terrified. Joe accuses her best friend, the spirited Kit O'Dowd (Kevin Trainor is marvelous) of murdering Gideon. Kit scoffs, ""Have you seen the bloody kit I have back at work? I've got a cutthroat razor. I've got scissors that would take your ear off. Why would I bloody burn a man to death!?"" St. Finan's school principal Dr. Ripman (Maureen Beattie), and former students Jamie Levinson (Mark Quartley) and Sister Claire (Pippa Bennett-Warner), come under Vera's radar. In a nod to the Catholic roots of Northumberland, a revealing reunion occurs between Vera and her former teacher at St. Anselem's, Sister Benedict (Ruth Davies, always a treat). Don't miss caf owner (Simon Barks) and his donuts (he will not lie and conceal their existence from Vera). Thanks to director of photography, Jean Philippe Gossart, this is a gorgeously filmed episode, from the lichen on a fencepost, to Northumberland's Vermeer-lit autumn sky.

Prodigal Son: By Marsten Bloom, this mystery unfolds on a promising night with a man and a woman meeting at Tuxedos Bar. Janna Jeffries (Emily Taaffe) thought that she was going to have fun with the bloke, but the evening goes awry when John (Alan Westaway) is stabbed to death on a cobbled side street. Initially, no one knows the victim's last name; he had a BMW with false plates and a stash of money hidden within. Janna turns out to have a friend named Carrie Kinsdale, whose significance we glimpsed in the first mystery. Cara is Vera's half-sister. Appropriately, she lives across the street from a graveyard; will Vera garner enough courage to meet her? Newcastle forms a perfect backdrop to this story, which involves a brewery, hostile takeovers, and John's lost-love Lisa (the great Christine Bottomley,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Street/dp/B005N8KP3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Street</a>). In her inimitable way, Vera tells Ross, Lisa's abusive husband, ""And she has to settle for YOU over the cornflakes."" John's sister is engaged to a brewery owner (Liam Cunningham); was John involved with his lovely daughter (Sophie Stuckey)? This dark mystery has lighter moments, with one of the cutest art-cards ever (wait for it), and the hope for a new life. Thanks to the director of photography, Adam Suschitzky, BSC, this is another masterful visual treat, with Northumberland snow, sea, and sky, wind turbines, and an old churchyard under a mantle of clouds.

We look forward to more of the quick-tempered, cantankerous DCI Vera Stanhope; hopefully the series will continue for many more seasons. Northumberland's evocative, bleakly beautiful  landscape is a welcome, perfect stage for these mysteries. The deeply talented, always compelling Brenda Blethyn is wonderful in the sharp comedy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-Grace/dp/B00003CXMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving Grace</a>, and graceful dancing with Alfred Molina in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undertaking-Betty/dp/B000CDGVPI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undertaking Betty</a>, with cats Fred & Ginger.

6068872,5,B00GAXASK8,"DCI Vera Stanhope of Northumberland is my kind of detective. In this series one she has a new haircut, which is more akin to wind blown and the absence of a hairbrush. She dresses for warmth, not style, although her raincoat is fashionable, and her sturdy shoes look as if they are handmade. All this discussion of her sense or lack of style is necessary to get the full picture of this detective. She is someone you feel you can trust, however, you cannot pull the wool over her. She knows when you are lying. Vera is down to earth, dresses for warmth, eats when she can, drinks more often, and her life as a DCI is her life.

Brenda Blethyn plays Vera, and she is absolutely brilliant. She has the ability to transform herself into Vera, her actions, her speech and her essence demand respect. In this series we are privy to more information about Vera's life, as she relays bits and pieces to her new DS Joe Ashworth, played by David Leon. DC Holly Lawson is played by Wunmi Mosaku, who is feeling bullied by Vera. Jon Morrison plays long time DC Kenny Lockhart, and Paul Ritter plays Billy Cartwright, the pathologist.a

Series one as usual, provides the best in acting, writing and directing. The episodes are all new and reality driven. We can see this happening in any neighborhood. These episodes take place in Northumberland, the moors, the desolate places and the nicer neighborhoods. Vera has a cast of characters who are all put in their place, she wants them to work harder, do more, bring in the clues and help solve the crimes. In series 3 there are four 90 minute episodes, The Ghost Position, Silent Voices, Sandman Years, and A Certain Samaritan. I am such a fan of Brends Blythyn and Vera, and I look forward to each episode.

6068875,4,B00GAXASK8,"Vera Series 3 (2013) continues the exploits of DCI Vera Stanhope (Brenda Blethyn) of the Northhumberland & City Police, retaining most of the series original cast. Veras second is DS Joe Ashworth (David Leon), still frustrated by his boss lack of sociability. Joe encourages Vera to look up her long-lost half-sister to limited effect. DC Kenny Lockhart (Jon Morrison) continues to be the object of Veras teasing. New to the team is DC Rebecca Shep Shepherd (Clare Calbraith), a competent and confident officer with more personality than Bethany, whom she replaced. This is Dr. Billy Cartwrights (Paul Ritter) last season as the charmingly inappropriate police pathologist. His departure is a loss, as he plays well off of Vera and comes across naturally in spite of his quirks. The mysteries are overplotted, but thats to be expected in 90-minute episodes. The cast of detectives peaked this series.

The episodes are:

A surgeon, Dr. Daniel Marsden, is shot in his home and his two teenaged daughters, Karen (Amy Cameron) and Mira (Shifaa Arfan), abducted in Poster Child. Their mother Laura Marsden (Saskia Reeves) is beside herself with worry, as Mira is diabetic and will soon need her insulin. White slavery is suspected, until it is discovered that Mira Marsden was a cause clbre in the UK ten years ago, when she was the sole survivor from a household in Baghdad that was hit by an American cruise missile during the war there. She required extensive medical care and was adopted by the Marsden family. The photographer who made her case famous, Jonah Regan (Dean Andrews), also tried to adopt her but failed. And someone from her past in Baghdad, a man named Malik Saleh (Amir Boutrous), is looking for Mira. DC Barry Kelman (Gareth Farr) joins the team for this tragic case.

Lizzie Faulkner (Eva Quinn) is shot dead, when she wanders outside the rental home where she was vacationing with two girlfriends to investigate shots in the night in Castles in the Air. Vera and DS Ashworth suspect local poachers, including Robert Doran (Richard Riddell), a man whom Joe sent to prison for a serious assault years ago a case whose justice Joe now doubts. Doran denies having anything to do with the death. When they realize that it was too dark for the shooter to have seen the victim, the detectives suspect a case of mistaken identity. They interview the architect of the vacation home Andrew Franks (John Light) and his wife Corrine (Vinette Robinson), who had given the holiday to  Lizzie, and the houses owner Tim Hopkins (Nicholas Gleaves), They find that Corrine was in a deadly car accident years ago that might provide some clues.

Some teenagers on holiday at an Adventure Center witness a flaming man scream and jump from a cliff into the lake below in Young Gods. The man was investment banker Gideon Frane (Darragh Horgan), who had invested in the recreation center where he died. Though he died of drowning, Vera and DS Ashworth set out to find out how Frane came to be alight, whether by intent, misadventure, or accident. The search leads them to an ex-girlfriend, Izzy Rawlins (Jodie Comer), whom Frane had been stalking and to the prep school that he graduated from 7 years earlier. The posh schools first female headmaster Dr. Vivienne Ripman (Maureen Beattie) remembers Frane, his troubled young girlfriend Amanda Adelaide (Pippa Bennett-Warner), and their friend Jamie Levinson (Mark Quartley), who was expelled from the school and went to prison on drugs charge.

In Prodigal Son, John Warnock (Alan Westaway) is found stabbed in an alleyway near a pub he left minutes before. With three other violent muggings in the area, police wonder if Warnock was the victim of a murderer or a mugger, but the 6,000 found in the boot of his car encourages Vera to keep investigating. Warnock was a ladies man, who picked up a string of women and took them to his nearby flat. He had been a detective constable before being invalided out. And he worked at a brewery, Finches, as a security guard for the past five months, thanks to his sister Maggies (Jill Halfpenny) fianc Sam Harper (Liam Cunningham), whose family owns the brewery. But John had recently renewed his relationship with old girlfriend Lisa Strachan (Christine Bottomley) and convinced his sister to give him half of her horse farm, all while poking around at Finches.",1482624000,,4348,4.900815217391305

The stories are interesting and the method of solving them is intriguing and additive. This is a very good series and remains one of my favorites.  Vera herself is a favorite of mine.

This one is exceptionally well done. In addition to excellent
writing and extremely well drawn characters, the
cinematography and music/sound design are among the
best I've ever seen from the British.
Beyond that, it is SUCH a relief and delight to be drawn
into a series that is headed by a woman over 50 -- who, BTW,
isn't physically perfect or psychologically heroic.

Vera's personal life may be bumpy, but when it comes to her work she is on the ball,  What I love the most about this show and the cast members is that they are like any ordinary person, they have their own personal problems just like you and me.  So I can really relate to the cast members.",1399334400,,445,4.080459770114943

6068952,5,B00GAXASK8,"For those who love a great mystery presented in a most realistic fashion, this is for you. I have seen all the episodes from the first 3 seasons and have never been disappointed.  There is never a loose end and you are never cheated by the final revelation. The show does have a kind of standard format but only in the way things generally unfold. ""Learn to expect the unexpected!""  ""Vera"" is an intrepid and very determined head detective.  She is also very human which only adds a fine 3-dimensionality to her character as is also the case for the other players.  She rules her cadre of fellow ""law enforcers"" with a no holds barred attitude while in relentless pursuit of the guilty party -whomever that might prove to be.  Yet, she also has her ""soft"" side, enjoys her imbibing, has ""daddy issues"", ""general family issues"", and spars with her equally qualified side-kick (played by David Leon) who serves as her leg man, foil, and co-investigator, among other things.  His concern for her health and general eating habits as well as comments about her vehicle makes for some hilarious interludes amidst the seriousness of various murder investigations. (One example: During one investigation, Vera parks her auto in the middle of a large metal junk yard.  She is told by Joe (DL) that she shouldn't park there lest the car be mistaken for scrap and hauled away.  He also makes comments about her cholesterol - absolutely ""delicious"".)  To be sure, Vera gets in her licks as well.

The cold bleakness of northeastern Britain and rural settings serve as the backdrop for all the presented mysteries (do all murders only occur in Winter?) which only adds to the solemn reality of what is not necessarily all black and white but, more often than not, exists as different shades of gray.  What makes this series so great is the consistency of its quality, lack of triteness, its unpredictability, and superb and credible acting from the entire cast.  American TV could learn a lesson.  When you have a mystery on American shows and you see a well known guest star either in the credits or in the story whose initial appearance is only for a couple of minutes you can be absolutely certain that he/she is the murderer.  You'll never get that with VERA whose eponymous star's name could very well be a shortened version of ""Veracity"".  One final word and it's a caveat.  USE THE SUB-TITLES!

Season 4 has just been completed.  Keep watch for its eventual appearance on DVD here at Amazon.",1398902400,,2485,4.73953488372093

6068956,5,B00GAXASK8,"I had sets 1 and 2 and was so happy when set 3 came out. I love the scenery. The story lines are never the same and each one shows a new side to Vera or one of her officers. I really enjoy her detectives home life and with his family. He tries to include her but she just can't enjoy taking part in a normal loving family life,  it must bring back unwanted memories of her childhood. Other than that they work great together. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys great acting.",1398124800,,483,4.08421052631579
6068957,5,B00GAXASK8,"Smart writing, compelling characters, and I have not once figured out who-done-it until it was revealed. I recommend to everyone who will listen!",1398038400,,145,5.3478260869565215
6068958,5,B00GAXASK8,"VERA has come of age. While the first episodes back in Set 1 lacked balance between Veras mothering side and her irascibility, the show has finally got it right. Small wonder with Brenda Blethyn at the head. Shes a masterful actor and perhaps just needed some time to get on track.

The four wonderful mysteries that comprise Set 3 of VERA are made all the more intriguing by the slowly unfolding overall story arc of Veras past and how it affects her present. Nonetheless, by mostly allowing Vera to be the mother figure with a genius for solving crimes, Brenda Blethyn gives us a character we would genuinely want to meetwho cares for people and does her job as a servant to society. There are still hints of a gravelly past, but hints are all thats needed. Her occasional short outbursts are as much a vent of frustration with the progress of the case she is working on than they are an indication of what apparently still haunts her.

Each of the four episodes have plots which unfold with expert pacing and intricate precision. The first episode, Castles in the Air is one of the best episodes of the entire series so far.

And of course it all begins with the writing, which is superb. And the visuals. Always damp-looking northeast England is commented upon by a Scottish comedian in one episode: Im from Scotland where damp is a colour.

Kidnapping joins the list of crimes in episode two, Poster Child. While the first suspects are logical and not entirely innocent, the superb plotting reels the viewer in to something far more involving and sinister.

Episode 3, Young Gods, has a very strong opening. Here is found an example of Veras motherly compassion, when she hands a crying witness a packet of tissues. One scene features cross-cutting between interviews, which proves highly effective in keeping the pacing of the episode sharp. It is in this instalment that Veras life-style choices catch up to her and she is forced to begin to come to terms with her personal demons. Definitely leaves you wanting more.

But it is episode four (Prodigal Son) that is probably the best of the set. Its a complex, excellent addition to what has become a first-rate police procedural.",1397433600,,2186,4.724409448818897
6068959,5,B00GAXASK8,"Loved the latest series.  Vera is an unusual detective  and very enjoyable addition to my collection. Will look forward to set 4.

6068960,5,B00GAXASK8,My husband and I enjoy the Vera Series.  We have Sets 1 and 2.  The plots are very good and we love the characters.,1396828800,,115,3.75
6068961,5,B00GAXASK8,"VERA is a new, contemporaneously set British television series made by ITV. The British mystery series, in its 2013 third season, returned to record ratings in the United Kingdom. The series has aired in the United States on PBS channels.  It is based on the best-selling mysteries of British author Ann Cleeves, and like her work, is set in the extreme northeast of England, just under the Roman-built Hadrian's Wall, which separates England from Scotland.  It stars two-time Oscar nominee Brenda Blethyn (LITTLE VOICE, SECRETS AND LIES, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, ATONEMENT) as DCI Vera Stanhope, a solitary, obsessed, caustic investigator with a messy persona and private life.  She's 40 pounds overweight, a bit disheveled; dresses for comfort and warmth --think female Columbo -- in the brutal Northumberland winters.  The boxed set includes four feature-length, character-driven crime dramas; it runs six hours on four DVDs.  For mature audiences.  It has, as extras, a photo gallery and text interviews with Blethyn and her right-hand man Detective Sergeant Joe Ashworth, as played by David Leon.  And thank you, RLJ Entertainment-Acorn, it's got subtitles: don't know what we'd do with the local accent on this side of the pond.

Stanhope pursues the truth in the cases of murder, kidnapping, and blackmail that occur on her patch of Geordie-land.  She's driven by her own demons; fails to follow the rules of proper nutrition; hides her loneliness well; drinks more than she ought. We're told she lost her mother as a young child, was raised by a distant father, is estranged from her only sister.  She's a complex character: a brilliant, independent cop with a dumb private life; a character that undoubtedly requires an actress of Blethyn's skill.  Unusually enough, when on the road with her DS, Vera, rather than Joe, generally drives. Control issues, anyone? In addition to Leon, who characterizes his part with an odd, bowlegged walk, as if he was malnourished as a child and had rickets, she's supported by Paul Ritter and Jon Morrison.  Guest stars include Liam Cunningham, (GAME OF THRONES); Saskia Reeves, (LUTHER); Dean Andrews, (LIFE ON MARS). And Julie Graham, Gina McKee, Judy Parfitt, Nicholas Gleaves.

The episodes are:

Disc 1
Episode 1: Castles in the Air
Three girlfriends spend the weekend partying at an isolated country retreat; one ends up dead with a shotgun blast to the chest. A local hunter is the prime suspect. Stanhope realizes, too late in the game, that the dead woman may not have been the intended target.

Disc 2
Episode 2: Poster Child
A respected surgeon is murdered; his two teenage daughters abducted. A wife and mother is left distraught; Stanhope, at a loss for a motive.

Disc 3
Episode 3: Young Gods
An extreme sports fanatic plunges to his death from a cliff after an apparent fight; Stanhope begins to search for potential enemies.

Disc 4
Episode 4: Prodigal Son
The fatal stabbing of a former police officer outside a Newcastle nightclub sets Stanhope on an effort to recreate the victim's last movements. What she finds ultimately leads her back 25 years. Particularly strong, we thought.

The episodes have been filmed in the original villages of the Cleeves crime novels; the lonely landscapes of Northumberland look good here.  But there are some problems with script continuity; in the beginning of a scene we may have snow on the ground; it will disappear by scene's end.  The acting is uniformly powerful, with particular praise due Blethyn.  In contrast to the female leads of most American TV cop shows, she's not young, pretty, sexy or well-dressed.  She doesn't have a husband, or a lover, and doesn't seem interested in getting one.  She's interested in getting her perps, man or woman, and she does.  Highly recommended.",1396742400,,3784,5.046623794212219
6068962,5,B00GAXASK8,This series just keeps keeping better - the characters are very interesting and the setting in northern England is another look at this country. I hope this series keeps going - the stories are wonderful and the acting excellent.,1396656000,,229,4.897435897435898

6068964,5,B00GAXASK8,"The Vera series presents the formidable acting skills of Brenda Blethyn as DCI Vera Stanhope and David Leon as her young protege, D.S. Joe Ashworth. The third prominent and recurring role is filled by the bleak but beautiful moorlands and waters  of Northeast England. The detectives investigate and solve crimes as a strong, capable pairing that  appreciates their individual skills and tolerates their shortcomings (such as Vera's inattention to a proper diet and need for the numbness of alcohol).
The episodes are so imbued with reality of place and persons that the viewer feels he or she has merely opened a window or door and is observing the conversations and interactions first hand. Only fine actors, directors and gifted writers could produce such authenticity and realism.
Vera is one of the best British mystery series available and a celebration of fine drama.",1396483200,,874,5.147887323943662

6068969,5,B00GAXASK8,Brenda Blethyn is terrific as Vera and the stories are still top-notch and intriguing.  This has been a fine series from the very beginning and I hope it will continue for a long time to come.,1395705600,,192,4.333333333333333
6068970,5,B00GAXASK8,"I have all 3 seasons and have enjoyed them all. They are watched from the treadmill.  If a show keeps me walking, and wanting to do so again the next day then it is well worth owning. Good stories and acting.  I will watch the whole series again sometime. Glad the subtitles are included.",1395705600,,288,4.314814814814815
6068971,5,B00GAXASK8,"Loved this season after watching the earlier ones on kindle prime.  My law enforcement kin like it too, for the more realistic policing procedures and intelligent plots.",1395360000,,169,5.2592592592592595
6068972,5,B00GAXASK8,"We really enjoy the Vera series.  The acting is excellent, the plots are full of suspense, and the views  of the country side are excellent.",1395273600,,140,4.56

6068974,5,B00GAXASK8,"Vera is one of the  best British mysteries that I have seen.  The stories are believable and yet, it is so difficult trying to figure out who the perpetrator is.  I wish there were more than 3 or 4 episodes a season; I can't wait for 2015.",1395100800,,239,4.042553191489362

6068976,5,B00GAXASK8,"This is top notch television drama. Every episode is well cast (some brilliant acting) and well written.  VERA is one of the few crime dramas that you can watch two or three times over and still enjoy its freshness.  The back stories, the personal lives of the police, the plots, all are great. Even apparently minor roles, such as Joe Ashworth's wife Celine, are cleverly built in and significant.  Top marks to the casting director for giving us a real life cross-section of people.a",1394668800,,485,4.75
6068977,5,B00GAXASK8,"Love it!  She is a very believable character, and the background reveals of her childhood make you understand why she is the way she is with her staff.  Most of all, the acting is great, as with most British productions.  Keep Vera coming!!",1394582400,,240,4.534883720930233
6068978,4,B00GAXASK8,"Having sets 1 and 2 I was not disappointed in set 3. I really enjoy all of the English series because the actors and actresses tend to be real people with real other lives and relationships and are not all glitzy and meticulous or over the top like our american versions. They just seem to do everything better. There aren't to many that have disappointed me and I struglle to find new series that I have not already purchased. Its just a treat on a cold New England evening to cuddle up with a hot cup of tea and watch a couple of hours of intelligent, well written, well acted English television. I do think cable and HBO is changing the american television experience but I will always be a fan of English TV. I just wish they would release them sooner than they do. That is my only complaint.",1394496000,,796,4.3133333333333335
6068979,5,B00GAXASK8,"Vera is my favorite British mystery, and I have almost all of those offered by Amazon. Engaging stories, stark landscapes and, above all, Brenda Blethyn. To a large degree, an actor's performance is shaped by the film's director. In most of the episodes in all three sets, Blethyn isn't particularly challenged, despite being a superior actor. However, in Young Gods she is encouraged to take it to an altogether different level by Serbian (I think) director Dusan Lazarevic. All the episodes in set 3 are good, but Young Gods is special. Set 3 is worth getting for this episode alone. I'm going to be on the lookout for anything else he directs because of this, including episodes of Death in Paradise (soon available on Amazon) and Silent Witness (not yet available, but should be if someone has their wits about them).",1394409600,,821,4.829787234042553
6068980,5,B00GAXASK8,"Vera,sets one, two, and three came as a complete surprise to me as I had not watched the series when transmitted on television.
I loved the entire series and the wonderful acting, particularly of the principals, neither of whom I had previously seen.

Well Done..",1393804800,,148,5.208333333333333
6068986,5,B00GAXASK8,Every thing about this series suits me just right - with the possible exception of occasional accents being difficult to understand.  The stories are well thought out and easier to follow than some of the other British mysteries.  There are usually several suspects to consider.  Vera has her team checking the many leads that surface.  The detective work is realistic.  Each story includes moments of humor that are done just right.  Too bad there were only four episodes in set 3.  I hope the sets keep on coming.,1393718400,,515,4.784090909090909
6068987,5,B00GAXASK8,Again good writing. You actually like the characters and are interested in their lives. The settings are wonderful . I hope there will be more of this show.,1393718400,,156,4.607142857142857

6068989,3,B00GAXASK8,This last series was not as good as the first two - something has changed about the writing in the series.  I liked Vera when she was sharper and more intimidating.  Still - a very good show and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase the next series...,1393200000,,245,4.304347826086956
6068990,5,B00GAXASK8,"I had bought the first set on a whim and enjoyed it.
Also the second set.  But this 3rd set is the best of the series.
Vera, you might not like at first, very private and rough around the edges but
she does grow on you.  Especially the way her relationship with her partner and his family.
The son/child she never had.
Put on the kettle and settle down to enjoy a great series.",1392595200,,377,4.081081081081081
6068991,5,B00GAXASK8,"This series keeps getting better all the time. I wish there were more episodes in each series. BB does a wonderful job creating the woman detective with her many quirks, moods, wit and mysteries. Love the story lines and the brooding setting of the show. The UK police procedural at its best.",1392422400,,292,4.634615384615385
6068992,5,B00GAXASK8,"It was with great sadness that watched the last disc of Set 3. Very sad indeed because we wanted Vera to go on forever. We are huge Mystery fans, some more special than others, but Vera has just stolen our hearts. Brenda Blethyn is superb as she is in any role she plays. She is a chameleon. there are some actors who are always themselves but she can morph herself into almost unrecognisable characters. we especially liked the partnership/relationship (really do not like that word as it conjures up something quite different from my viewpoint) between DCI Stanhope and DS Joe Ashworth. He really cares about her - almost her son. It is mutual and when she has his family show up, insisting he spend time with them, the kind of professional she portrays is most appealing. The whole cast is real. The  actors make it look so easy.  What I love most is this ordinary person with frumpy clothes, hides the brain of a brilliant criminalist. The humour is wonderful, very quick and spontaneous. Her compassion, often hidden by her down to earth, stick to the point attitude, is vast, Not only is she kind to peope in pain, she is practical, finding help and support for those in need. Like many dedicated professionals, she doesn't take care of herself. I know that stoicism very well and although it is worldwide, the Brits are very stubborn in accepting, let alone asking for help. She certainly needs a physical! She fuels her grinding schedule with a lot of carbs, caffeine and alcohol. Just how long can she continue? It all has to catch up sooner or later and I don't want another Morse ending to this series. I hope there will be more but noting her workaholism, there has to be an intervention of sorts. Knowing Northumbrians as I do - fat chance that any scare will change her. I remember listening to one of the most brilliant speakers address an inpatient group of addicts/alcoholics. He wasn't highly educated but he knew his stuff as no one else in my experience. He spoke of the dangers of drink when one has the disease and held up a jar of a preserved liver after an autopsy of a man who died of this ghastly illness. The response? One man said "" that's not my liver"".
There speaks Vera. With all the effort made to make her appearance somewhat dull and decrepit with that makeup free face, she is very beautiful when she smiles. Seeing the elderly Nun - that gleaming grin lit up the screen. The scripts are excellent and I truly hope she lasts longer than Lewis (haven't stopped grieving that one yet). Have to confess. We are only halfway through the last disc - can't bear to see the credits roll as we all know what that means!",1392076800,4,2646,4.521920668058455
6068993,5,B00GAXASK8,Have all three sets of Vera and have enjoyed them all. I look forward to the next one. Would recommend to any one who enjoys a good mystery.,1391904000,,140,4.035714285714286
6068994,5,B00GAXASK8,"I've read the books and watched the previous series -- and I've really enjoyed them all.  However, I have to say that Series 3 is my favorite.  The character development has become very finely tuned and there's now an easy, witty repartee among the main characters  (particularly between Billy the forensics boffin and Vera; and between Kenny, one of the older detectives, and everyone else).  It feels as if all those associated with this production are now quite comfortable with their characters and with each other. There's a palpable camaraderie in the incident room. Brenda Blethyn is superb -- she has been consistently excellent, but in this latest series, she gives a particularly subtle performance.  We get a deeper insight into Vera's past and her character. No longer is she simply a clever eccentric, but now we are given more clues to the mystery of Vera herself. The plots are engaging and a number of excellent character actors contribute to this series (eg. Liam Cunningham, ""Game of Thrones"" and Saskia Reeves, ""Luther""). Also of note is the beautiful and evocative Northumberland landscape, which features prominently in each episode.  It is almost raised to character-status. Highly recommended.",1391385600,7,1216,5.178571428571429
6068995,5,B00GAXASK8,"With so many police dramas and mysteries available these days, we are spoiled with choices.  Vera is certainly NOT a choice to pass up....the combination of dedicated  very human characters and stunning evocative settings would be enough to make VERA a special series, but add to that a high quality in performances and technical details and it becomes very nearly perfect.  Viewers see Vera as Detective Chief Inspector Stanhope, clever, determined and amazingly sharp at putting together disjointed clues to solve the cases.  Perhaps more importantly there is also Vera the person who is revealed in small private moments, delivered with powerful emotional understanding by actress Brenda Blethyn,  Vera like many of us is trying to balance work and life, and given health issues of middle age, her struggles are a wonderful representation of the frustrating way that the life things can hamper work abilities.  She is one to not give in to these annoyances and soldiers on to find the solution to the crime.  The cases are grim, and often heartbreaking and haunting.....they could happen anywhere.  It is comforting to see Vera working for justice and good, with humor and strength against these horrific crimes.",1389744000,,1215,5.163265306122449
6068996,3,B00GAXASK8,"This used to be a witty and clever series with great characters.  The characters are still fun, but the story lines have become dumbed down.  And the silliness that has long marked American cop shows (more physical chases than intellectual ones) is popping up here: Vera drives from the station house to a distant loc in less time than it takes her sidekick to chase after a suspect (5 min?); cop stands in front of single paned window on ground floor, flummoxed about what to do while murderer is allowed to do his deed (only after the deed does the cop smash the window and climb out); the ending contains info you couldn't possibly have known because it wasn't dropped as a clue along the way.  The show is still scenic and if you don't mind the tired writing, it's worth a look.",1388966400,3,782,4.454545454545454

I tried watching it on another channel only to find out they don't offer closed captioning which is something I need.  I ordered the DVD and am very happy with it, especially with closed captioning.  I guess I will need to do the same for series 8 when a DVD becomes available since Acorn TV did not get the rights for this either.  I don't want to sign up for the channel that does have the rights since there appears to be little else of interest on it (Britbox).",1518825600,,612,4.161016949152542
