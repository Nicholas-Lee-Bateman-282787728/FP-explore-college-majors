8380582,3,B002TS15JQ,"This is a great DVD and brings back great memories. I owned all these VHS tapes and had watched him 1000 times.  Here's the big major flaw with these DVDs and in my opinion it is a big one. For those of you bodybuilding aficionados, the producers of these DVDs have turned the old VHS tapes into letterbox or widescreen aspect ratio.  This is distorted the bodybuilders on stage. For example the 1982 Mr. Olympia everyone looks much wider than it would be in real life at the time and their legs are way thicker. If a bodybuilder hold his arms out horizontally his arms look really long. If they kneel  with their knee at a 90 angle so the thought is parallel with the ground there five is distorted to look very long. Most youngsters won't notice this and they will just think that these people look like this but it makes all the bodybuilders look much bigger than they were and they look disproportionate.  In this case they should have left the gray bars on the sides and kept the original aspect ratio. This flaw really ruins it for me as we are looking at false history here.",1487808000,3,1081,4.39
