Here, western actor Charles Starrett portrays a discharged college economics professor whose unorthodox financial theories work in actual practice. When they learn of the enormous wealth he's generating, former detractors try to steal Starrett's investment scheme.

There's not-so-subtle socialist anti-banker undertones in this early screwball comedy, but in Depression-crippled mid-1930s America, such bashing and ""share the wealth"" ideas were most fashionable.

8153179,1,B000JU8HAQ,"The intended hero of the story, a young college teacher; flunks a female student in his class, only because when asked; the student politely disagrees with the teacher's politics. By flunking this student; the teacher knowingly prevents the student from graduating with her class. The writer of this movie assumes we are on the side of the teacher.

The teacher is fired, and we are supposed to feel sorry for him. The teacher joins up with panhandlers, who teach him how to fake a war injury or fake being blind to beg for money. Again, the writer of this movie assumes we admire the teacher.

The teacher puts an ad in the newspaper asking people to send him money. That is how he ""makes"" a million.

The actors deliver the dialogue of the tiring script in flat monotones (unchanging, dull, tones), because they know they have a bad script.

The 5-star movie-reviews were written by the people selling this DVD. I have been ripped-off again by a couple of shill reviewers.",1315008000,,974,4.678362573099415
8153180,4,B000JU8HAQ,"Back in the day Poverty Row cranked out these short little no-budget films and, at times, it even managed to produce some pretty entertaining pictures. MAKE A MILLION falls short of being a great little gem, but its running time of 66 minutes holds enough diverting comedy and it boasts a quirky premise. MAKE A MILLION stars big, strapping young Charles Starrett and if you won't mention that he doesn't look at all like a professor, then I won't, either. What's significant is that Starrett has the dexterity and just enough of that light touch to marry his stiff academic role with the film's breezy tone.

Economics college professor Reginald Q. Jones lands in hot water when he denies student Irene Corning a passing grade. Thing is, Irene Corning is the daughter of a banker who happens to be a very powerful contributor to Pelton University. It also doesn't help that Professor Jones maintains unpopular radical views regarding the state of the economy. And maybe Jones should've refrained from his comment to the university board: ""It's hardly an achievement today to get a million."" Irene's blustery father exerts his influence. The professor is put on the spot, placed on an extended leave (but I call it ""getting fired"") and he can return only when, as per his boast, he's made a million dollars. Reginald Jones, not given any real choice, sets out to amass a fortune. His first step is to hang out with the homeless.

And when the professor surprisingly raises $25,000 in only two days, Irene's banker dad starts to get nervous.

Professor Jones considers Irene Corning (Pauline Brooks) a campus menace, thinks her a demoralizing influence on the student body. Animosity between the genders being what it is in these comedies, it's a safe bet that romance is in the offing, even if it takes the good prof a good while to get with the program. But I guess I'd ignore that pretty girl trying so hard to make an impression if I, too, were preoccupied with perfecting my own theory on distribution of surplus. Right? MAKE A MILLION, filmed in 1935 during the Great Depression, is trivial stuff but affords enough chuckles and mild diversion for the poor struggling bastards back in the day. There are even bits when the film sticks it to the stuck-up upper class. If you've only ever seen Charles Starrett as the Durango Kid, this comedic tug-of-war between the haves and the have-nots should come as a pleasant surprise.",1272844800,,2429,4.80622009569378

ALPHA VIDEO offers bargain priced, often hard-to-find vintage movies that are ideal for those willing to skip DVD extras. Their transfers show no evidence of restoration, so quality varies from one title to the next, with ""fair to good"" being the average.
