5931120,5,B00EOMJAWY,"Love Tucker and Dale, and always....really bought this as a spare to loan out, but the campy Cabin in the Woods entertained, as well.  Very pleased with the speed of this seller, and the shape the DVDs arrived in.  Thanks!",1450310400,,222,4.525
5931121,5,B00EOMJAWY,"Cheesiest & shortest review I've ever written.
Two of my favorite, watch-them-often movies in one case-- it doesn't get any better than that.
I bought this, because I watch both of these often & our other movies are in another building where the family ""hangs out"" & all of our electronic media (sans laptops!) are; this allows me to have this close and doesn't take up as much room as both separately.

You still get Special Features, which I like. Sometimes that doesn't happen. Each movie is on its own disc.",1446854400,2,511,4.615384615384615
5931122,5,B00EOMJAWY,These are two of my favorite horror movies of all time! Actually I just bought it for Cabin In The Woods and thought I'd like the other movie and OMG I love it even a bit more than Cabin In The Woods! Super cool that I could get them together and it cost less than if I'd bought one or both of them individually.,1439337600,5,312,3.890625

5931135,5,B00EOMJAWY,"I can't think of a better two-pack!  I love these movies, and when I saw the price on the double, I couldn't say no.  Worth it at twice the price. ;-)",1491350400,,150,3.806451612903226
5931136,5,B00EOMJAWY,This is amazing! Both of these movies are great and to have them in the same package is awesome. Definitely recommend.,1489190400,2,118,4.666666666666667

5931139,5,B00EOMJAWY,Two disks is an added bonus.,1464912000,,28,3.8333333333333335
5931140,3,B00EOMJAWY,I thought this was a decent double feature as I have never seen either movie but i have seen many bits of T&D and have heard of the stupid cabin movie. T&D was definitely my type of movie but the cabin in the woods was disappointing to be considered on the same league as this genius movie. I only got this because the pricing between this and the copy of T&D that i could find were similar in pricing .,1458864000,,403,4.05

8607477,5,B00EOMJAWY,"I got this DVD combo pack for a raffle at a convention that I run that always features a Cabin in the Woods game, and it didn't disappoint. I heard back from the couple that won it that they watched Tucker and Dale vs Evil last week, and they didn't have any issues with it! This is a very cost effective way to buy two of the best ""horror"" movies that have come out in recent years.",1512086400,,383,3.987012987012987
8607478,5,B00EOMJAWY,GREAT MOVIE CAME AS DESCRIBED AND IN THE TIME THEY SAID IT WOULD ARRIVE,1506643200,,71,4.142857142857143
8607479,5,B00EOMJAWY,"Product arrived in a timely manner, and was undamaged.

I highly recommend this Double Feature. Cabin in the Woods is, in my humble opinion, a stellar horror movie that is well stocked with both a lovable and memorable cast and fantastical creatures. Tucker and Dale vs Evil is simply HILARIOUS, completely turning the stereotypical ""backwoods horror"" genre on it's head. I was thrilled to add both of these to my collection.

8607480,5,B00EOMJAWY,"Neither one of these movies is a big budget Hollywood movie, but I enjoyed both of them.  I really got this for Tucker and Dale, what a great twist on the garbage horror movies that normally get made, the cliche bad guys are the good guys and this movie has plenty of action, some comedy, and even a little romance, one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in awhile.  Cabin in the Woods is more conventional horror movie, but it has a better plot and for low budget movie it blows the garbage Hollywood puts out away.

Getting both of these movies on separated disc in one case is a bargain.",1500163200,,594,4.285714285714286
8607481,5,B00EOMJAWY,Two of my favorite thriller comedy movies. Thank you for this awesome bundle and so happy that I have these in my collection after waiting so long to get them. Thank you again!,1499040000,,176,4.363636363636363
