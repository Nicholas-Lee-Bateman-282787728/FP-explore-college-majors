8056817,4,B00092DVQE,"I am not sure how old this country girl is, but I'd guess that she is about 19 or 20.  The story raises a couple of interesting issues.  We have a young girl who knows she has a heart defect, and I'd suspect that she realizes she does not have long to live.  At first, I thought she was driven to become a superior pianist.  This is what she tells a wealthy bachelor when she says she'll marry him if he finances piano training in Montreal.  This raises one intriguing issue: should one marry someone simply because he or she can further some self-interest a person has?  In actual practice, how different would that be from the arranged marriages common in some cultures?  I have heard it said that any man and woman, chosen at random, has an 80% chance of building a lifelong and successful marriage if both are committed to the marriage.

The second issue relates to one's behavior when they know or suspect that they are dying.  It seems that this girl was willing to use a wealthy man to be able to go to the city to 'live it up' before she died.  She smokes, which is terrible for any heart (healthy or not), poses for nude drawings, parties, and seems to be rebellious toward all her community's values.  Is that the way to go for one facing death?  Or, might it be better to spend what time one has left concentrating on doing good for others?  For example, maybe one could volunteer at an orphanage or old folks home, trying to make those lonely people's lives happier.  Parents might wish to discuss with their kids if, when they are taking their last few breaths, if they would want to look back on a time of rebellion and living it up, or if they would take comfort in the smiles of those whose lives they had touched positively.",1177113600,,1741,4.366459627329193
