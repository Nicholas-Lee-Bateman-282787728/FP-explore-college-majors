8753600,3,B01COQ0QXI,"This is a decent movie, but there is so much better out there if you want a romantic comedy. The girl in this movie didn't feel likable at all, and was overly complicated, boring, and not cool at all. The guy was also pretty boring... It's pretty realistic though, from a man's perspective that's for sure. I would highly recommend checking out Garden State, or Midnight in Paris if you haven't seen those yet. They characters in those 2 movies have better development, and personality. Save this one for when you run out of good movies to watch.",1520899200,,546,4.581632653061225
