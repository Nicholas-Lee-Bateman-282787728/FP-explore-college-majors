8247702,4,B0012TBIPY,"This third feature by director Flora Gomes of the African country of Guinea Bissau is a bit disappointing after his previous film, the stunning Po di Sangui, but this musical comedy about the success in Paris of a young black women singer from the island of Cape Verde is quite charming, if a bit amateurish at parts. The starring actress can't be faulted, the songs are good if not particularly memorable but the often silly dialogue and story are the main culprits here, I think. Still, for those interested in seeing a different sort of film (far away from the dull, artier African films often seen at film festivals) this is a movie I can readily recommend. (By the way, the director, despite his name, is a man).",1263513600,,717,4.609375
8247703,5,B0012TBIPY,"I bought this movie, b/c  I heard it was filmed on location in the City of Mindelo in Cape Verde. It seems to me, after reading about this director' Flora Gomes other movies, that he is an excellent director, from Guine Bissau. This is a very different take from his other movies; this is a comical-musical genre. It is, as if, he was driving in a sedan closed his eyes took a left turn ended-up in a yatch travelling the wholeworld and relating this experience to us; that we are very similar in many aspects eventhough we come from many different cultures, background, and generational-gap. There are a lot of undertones and subtle messages in this movie. The musical-aspect here might distract and even overcast the main theme of this movie, for some. For me at first I was taken back by the musicality. However, the music here are done in great taste and interlaced very well with the main theme of the movie.
 The never-ending decision where to place the bust of Amilcar Cabral, in the opening of the movie, forinstance, tells us : here is a society that some how wants to acknowledge their leader, but how; the very person who seems to be responsible to carry it out; is too busy chasing girls and consumated by the materialism that is a product of our economic development. There a lot of CONTRAST in this movie... It is there in just about every scene... Although this movie was on location in Cape Verde, the story is based on the west African Country of Guine Bissau, where many Cape Verdeans and our  Criolo descended from. We, my whole family, enjoyed the costume, the language, the music, actors,local-extras, and the scenery of Mindelo.

This was an uplifting movie. A great sunday afternoon movie, very amusing and for real movielovers. Again the director is speaking to us via many Contrast, and subtle messages in almost every scene. I have seen this movie again and again... and converted it to my Ipod and I-touch format. This American version though has a permanent English subtitle, how disapointing.... at least on my DVD players I can't get rid of this subtitle even if wanted to.
I highly recommend this movie, particularly for people who enjoy serious movies from other cultures... and want to watch an entertaining CREATION.",1246147200,2,2250,4.732142857142857
