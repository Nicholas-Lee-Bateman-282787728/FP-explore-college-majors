The seasons themselves are brilliant, but the playback capability is terrible!!!! With season 5 the first episode played fine, until the end, where it just froze. After that, neither player will play the disc at all!!!! It cannot be that almost every season is having pressing issues, cause then the same problem would occur always, and with every player. This is horrid, and I am deeply disappointed. Only season out of the five I have that have not shown any problems is season #3. So..what the hell is going on?",1456099200,,921,4.726708074534161
