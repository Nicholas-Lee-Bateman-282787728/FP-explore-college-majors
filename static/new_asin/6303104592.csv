7837368,3,6303104592,This film is not great but pretty good. The animation is nice. The story is weird and scary. The cast members are a little bland but still entertaining. The action is top rate. The cover is pretty basic but still fun to look at. The ending is confusing. The main thing wrong with it is that it's still not in english but it's still a pretty good film. I give this movie a 6.6 out of 10.,1282867200,,386,4.025974025974026
7837369,1,6303104592,"This lost gem from the 80's feels like a cross between Dirty Pair and Ultimate Muscle.  To stand a chance against the monstrous tag team champs, two female wrestlers become unwitting guinea pigs for an experimental performance drug.  Now the premise seems appealing at first glance but this, like most wrestling-based cartoons and comics, goes down for the count.  It's said that this particular genre fails because the creators tend to shove more fantasy into the already fantastic world of wrestling, taking out what people love about the sport in the first place--specifically the wrestling.  Speaking of which, the actual wrestling here is actually so good you can't get enough.  With the lackluster main plot taking up most of film's 45-minute runtime, you don't.  Overall, Wanna-Be's is the kind of movie you'd see in the SyFy channel's anime block--just not the kind of movie you'd really want to see.

This film is unrated: Graphic Violence, Nudity, Adult Language.",1273881600,,973,5.120253164556962
7837370,5,6303104592,"I am a huge anime fan and it is hard to choose out which one is exactly my favorite. Well, until I finally saw the Wanna-be's I was not sure. After seeing the Wanna-be's I instantly fell in love with it. I am a huge fan of wrestling especially female wrestling.
This movie has an exciting plot. The Wanna-be's a tag team with rising fame must go against the dreaded Foxy Ladies. They are undefeated and very unfeminine. The Wanna-be's are given a drug that will help them win. Will this save them though from the worlds champions? Will they be able to survive this plot? Will the drug actually work or will it fail like the others in the past? Get this exciting, hilarious, action packed, and totally unexpected animation to find out! You will be enthralled from beginning to end!",1025913600,4,780,4.5
