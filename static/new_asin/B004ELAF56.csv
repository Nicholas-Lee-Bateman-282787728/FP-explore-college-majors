8427216,1,B004ELAF56,"I bought this DVD specifically for Easy Street because I had previously seen a version that was astounding.  This version was impossible to see and I'd wager 80% of the cards were missing.  This makes certain scenes worthless and the movie as a whole is not worth watching in this state.

If I could give it 0 stars I would, because there exists a version that is infinitely better than this one.  This product simply isn't it.  If you are looking for Easy Street, try to find another DVD.",1377820800,11,489,4.449438202247191
