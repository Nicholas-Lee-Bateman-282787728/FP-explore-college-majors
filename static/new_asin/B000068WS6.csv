1728025,5,B000068WS6,"A few months ago I attended a great party where the host had the Carson DVD's playing all night - and I noticed within a few minutes everyone was gathered around the TV - laughing and shouting - watching all the old favorites we had forgotten about. I bought the collection last week when I was reminded by TV Guide (they chose it as one of the 50 ""must have"" DVDs) how much I enjoyed it.  This is a big collection - 7 hours long - with lots of the best scenes from the show - and many extras I have never seen.  It is beautifully designed and packaged, and I think it will be an easy gift choice for several friends for Christmas.  Highly recommended!",1038873600,14,652,4.158730158730159
1728066,5,B000068WS6,"Just as diverse as there is peoples taste there will always be diverse views as to what is ultimate. Nothing short of the complete works will do justice to Johnny. However this package comes extremely close.

If you expect lots of the funniest moments of Carson you will find them. However this is more than a collection or synopsis's of the program. You get the real feeling you know Johnny as you get everything from behind stage scenes to a view of Johnny's home town told by Johnny himself.

The three DVD's are a little much to view in one sitting and are fun to rematch. Everyone has their favorites. And most of them are here. Yet for those that just must have more there are other collections.",1504483200,,701,4.46875
1728067,2,B000068WS6,Don't expect three dvds with that much content. What they showed on the first dvd was good....but it very poorly covered all the years that this man was on...and on top of that...they repeated the same material at times...l,1501891200,,223,4.743589743589744

1728069,5,B000068WS6,"Ok, I've see reviews that say they were expecting entire shows & interviews. Not even close....read the ""do the math"" comment below.

I discovered Johnny Carson here in the US on Antenna TV, I am from England. In watching the selections they show on TV, I really find some of it hilarious. Now everyone's funny bone is different, this is 7 hours of which 4-5 hours are clips from what they consider ""the best of"". Each little sketch offers great entertainment regardless of who you are or how old you are, I admit there were a couple where I laughed so much I had tears.

Do the math: think of it from a movie stand point. Each DVD offering 2 hours per movie which this 3 pack would offer 6 hours. Now if Johnny Carson had 30 years, say 5 days a week take that at 30 minute shows (minimum) that would be at least 7,800 hours of material which is impossible to jamb in to 3 - 2 hour DVD's. I'll be generous & give each DVD 8 hours which would mean I should be looking for a set of around 975 dvd's to have the entire Johnny Carson series.",1499558400,2,1037,4.154228855721393

Now, we watched his show for years and years and KNEW that there would likely be some such content in it, but it was more than we wanted.  We only watched the first DVD. Not as family-friendly as we had hoped. There is SO much good clean content that could have made it onto this.

1728237,5,B000068WS6,"I grew up watching Johnny Carson and laughed through my teen years watching The Tonight Show.  I guess I had seen the infomercials enough times to finally have a sentimental need to get some DVD's so I could watch again.  I got this set and put them on one day while I was working on a new quilt project.  Let me just say, after a few minutes of watching, I walked away from my sewing machine for two reasons:  I wanted to just sit and watch to enjoy the clips, and secondly, I was laughing so much I was afraid I was going to mess up the quilt!  It was so wonderful revisiting the most hilarious moments on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carsons classic reactions.  It was also wonderful to see some of the performers who are no longer with us.....and made me kind of sad seeing them again.  I can't say how much I enjoyed this series though and it left me wanting more.  I also enjoyed the bonus video of Johnny going home to the town in Nebraska where he grew up.  In this video you get a real glimpse into what a nice man he must have been.  No one could top Johnny Carson in the late night shows......in so many ways he truly was the king of late night.  This series is definitely one to get, although I warn you it will leave you wanting more.  I do think more clips should have been added to this collection and the clips aren't in any particular order, but still a very enjoyable collection of highlights from the years of entertainment Johnny Caraon brought to us all.",1436400000,6,1475,4.228571428571429

1728605,5,B000068WS6,It's great to be able to relive the good ole days of television comedy with these! I had almost forgotten how funny he and his shows were! It's also fun to see some of today's biggest stars when they were just starting out  and still nobodies. There is no one like him on late night today and interviews are not handled the same as he did it. I had expected these to be arranged in chronological order but they are not. They jump around from the oldest to the newest and then somewhere in between. I would recommend them for anyone who wants to relive some fond memories of late night TV.,1400025600,,588,4.25
1728606,5,B000068WS6,We purchased this DVD for our son in law as he enjoys Johnny Carson and these clips. I am sure he will like them as we saw The Best Of Carson on TCM recently and really enjoyed Johnny and his guests.,1398988800,,199,3.8780487804878048

1728610,4,B000068WS6,"What IS on these DVD's is nice, including the ""Johnny Goes Home"" special, which further humanizes him.

My problem is what's NOT on these DVD's. First of all, these DVD's are just like the VHS tapes that came out a long time ago.
Though, unfortunately, I counted at least 3 skits that were on the tapes, but no on the DVD's. There is a Smother Brothers bit missing, somewhat funny, but certainly not essential. What is truly disappointing is that the DVD does not have Sam Kinison's ""Lonesome Tonight"" routine, which was absolutely hysterical. Also missing was Johnny's duet with Julio Iglesias, which was nearly as funny. Why these three routines are missing is a big mystery and a crime. Some folks will never know what they're missing.
I also have a slight problem (at least on the disks I watched) with the picture. The picture on the main programs of the 60's-70's and the 70's-80's is off center. If you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about.

Granted, the DVD's have much more material than the VHS tapes, but even the episodes on here are incomplete. This product purports to have the final 2 episodes, which is does. Unfortunately, the episodes cannot be complete because the running time for both is less than 40 minutes - should have been at least 44 minutes. What's missing? Who knows.

Overall, I'd still recommend these disks (as long as the price stays reasonably low), but I cannot ignore the feeling that they are incomplete.",1394150400,2,1447,4.711462450592886
1728611,5,B000068WS6,Still funny. Made us laugh out loud throughout the video. Even funnier than I remembered it to be.  I would recommend to anyone that enjoyed Johnny in the past.,1394064000,,160,4.517241379310345
1728622,5,B000068WS6,"Even my teenage daughters enjoy watching these highlights. With all the garbage on TV today, Johnny and his guests bring us back to a time when comedians were truly funny.",1393113600,,171,4.733333333333333
1728623,5,B000068WS6,"Johnny Carson was the king of late night, undisputed. This box set shows why. For 30 years (1962-1992) he ruled late night TV. His wit, creativity and outstanding interview skills made him a hit with millions. Everyone watched The Tonight Show, and what Johnny said was water cooler talk the next day. The second-to-last show is part of this DVD. His guests were Robin Williams and Bette Midler. This box set also has his final show, which had no guests and was a retrospective of memories. It's all here, Johnny, his sidekick Ed McMahon and his bandleader Doc Severinsen with the best late night band ever assembled. The best part of this collection is the program that Johnny did in 1982 called ""Johnny Goes Home"". In the show he went back to his hometown of Norfolk, Nebraska. He visited his old home and talked to the family that lived there. He recalled days growing up practicing magic tricks in that home and listening to his hero on the radio, Jack Benny. Johnny loved to ""discover"" new comedy talent and give young comedians their big break. Legendary comedians like Jerry Seinfeld, Drew Carey, Ellen Degeneres, Roseanne, George Carlin, Bill Cosby and more credited Johnny for making their careers. Letterman, Fallon, Kimmel and the rest are good hosts but no one will ever top Johnny Carson.",1392768000,,1301,4.8125

Extremely funny DVD collection that covers 30 years as host of the Tonight Show.  At one time back in the 90s, Carson had an average audience of 15 million people per night.  Disc 3 has May 21, 1992 with Robin Williams and Bette Midler and the May 22, 1992 last show.  Includes clips from Jay Leno, Robin Williams, George Carlin, David Lettermen, Don Rickles, Jack Benny and Dean Martin- just to name a few, They have also included animal clips.

Johnny also takes you back to his hometowns in Iowa and Nebraska where he grew up, showing you the car that he first drove in as a kid, his childhood home and all of his childhood memories including actual video that his father took of the family as a youngster and a teenager.  I didn't even know that this was a  part of this DVD collection.

If you put all of the current late night talk show hosts together, they still wouldn't be able to equal Johnny's talent.  We were laughing thru all 3 DVD's.  The best $17.00 that we have ever spent on a DVD collection.  We purchased ours from the ""more buying choices"" button on Amazon and we saved about $10.00 over the Amazon Prime price.

I also added a quick David Letterman clip- this is after NBC passed on him and they gave the Tonight Show to Jay Leno (who was the permanent Tonight Show fill in host for Johnny at the time) before Jay was given the Tonight Show by NBC.",1392681600,5,1804,5.4035714285714285
1728625,4,B000068WS6,It is something that anyone and everyone can watch without being offended.  So much of the entertainment isn't fit for children to watch and is offensive for adults to watch.,1392508800,,174,4.8
1728626,3,B000068WS6,It was ok. Would like to have seen more of the animals that were on his show. Would also liked to seen more comedy.,1392249600,,115,3.8333333333333335

1728629,5,B000068WS6,"Bought this for my husband after seeing him break down laughing over the infomercials. When I went to the Infomercial website they wanted way too much (over $100) so I found this smaller collection of 3 DVDs. This set doesn't have as many DVDs as in the infomercial, but this set was enough to satisfy his need to see more than the commercials and have a good laugh.",1392076800,,366,4.397058823529412

1728631,5,B000068WS6,My husband and I loved this collection.  With the very first DVD of the set of three it put us back several years when part of our bedtime ritual was to get in bed before Johnny Carson started so we could watch it.  Most episodes were so funny we ended up going to sleep laughing.  Watching this collection was just as much fun as when we watched on live tv years ago.,1391558400,2,368,4.083333333333333

Yes, some of the bits are short and they skew toward the later years.  Carson was funny all through his 30 years and never lost his touch.  We can argue over which skits should be here; his catalog is enormous.  What a task to choose just a few hours to represent it all.  Watch this, and remember the great wit that was Carson.

1728806,2,B000068WS6,"The beginning of this compilation is every bit as good as you would expect of a Carson show. Even the first half of the second disc is entertaining. With so many years there is no reason to stint on material.
  When we get to the second segment of the second disc, there is a drop off in entertainment value.  Bette Midler and Robin Williams do not add much here unless you find her duet with Johnny sentimental. R.W. though is distasteful  in his commentary and tiresome with his mugging.  Not well thought out at all.
  The third disc rises hopes somewhat. Still I would have preferred more of the skits which displayed Carson at his funniest. Altogether too few of those and there could easily be a 3 disc product showing skits only. I do not like the waste of time in duplicating parts of the penultimate show. There is too much wasted on Johnny walking out and standing before the applause. We know he deserves it. Why dwell on that and some wobbly interviews with show biz personalities (Grodin, Ann-Margaret,et others) The photo album could have been saved for another Carson edition made for personality groupies.
  You editors did not hit the mark for those of us looking for Carson genius not backstage support nor private moments/awkward farewells.",1325116800,4,1259,4.712328767123288
1728807,3,B000068WS6,"I actually found the ""Johnny Goes Home"" extra touching and a nice addition. What I was extremely disappointed in was the choice of clips. Don't get me wrong. There are some great ones in here but too many duff ones, too. Does anyone on the globe think Albert Brooks is remotely funny (he was like the Ray Romano of the '80s)?

Anyway, where was more of Johnny--no Floyd R. Turbo, no ""take the Slausen cutoff"" guy, no Aunt Blabby. How about a clip of where Bob Hope suddenly appears and cuts into the show unannounced. That happened numerous times and is a classic. Or Stump the Band when Johnny goes into the audience and interacts with the ""regular"" folks. Or his stuff with Carol Wayne as his sidekick. There was some busty babe in a couple of routines but didn't look like Carol.

There's overkill on animals and on bizarre people. Hey, the chip lady is fine but the accordian lady? And, sorry, I'm not interested in seeing obscure comics or ten seconds of Jay Leno's hair. Where were all the athletes he had on the show? Basically, there are none in this DVD set at all.

I just don't get with all the fantastic stuff that was on the Tonight Show, this is the best they can come up with over three discs?

All this does is give people a taste of what Johnny was like but no way is this the ultimate in Carson's genius.",1321056000,2,1322,4.340080971659919

The DVD company reduced the image rate, removing half the video data in a headache-inducing attempt to simulate the look of movie film (instead of the original videotape look).

It's hard on the eyes as well as inauthentic and ahistorical. I bought this as a replacement for the old laserdisc release, but I'll be keeping those laserdiscs because they look and sound much better.

The Tonight Show died when Johnny left and so did a part of America. Johnny was the reason America began staying up late and with his genuine personality, quick wit and sense of humor we fell in love with him and that relationship never has ended. This DVD has left out many magical moments but it would be imposssible time-wise to include them all, you'd have to have every single episode to catch the best of Johnny for he was always special. I know there were certain guests that brought a more hysterical side out in him but just being with Johnny was comforting and entertaining like a visit to a best friends house, a house that now sits empty and sadly silent.

What I liked the best is the bonus special of when Johnny went back to the town of Norfolk, Nebraska--the town he grew up in. He visits his old house, friends, stores, etc. & included in this are his home movies from the 30's-40's. I had missed this when it aired only once. What great nostalgia.

The video clips extracted from his entire 30+ year TV career are a breath of freshness compared to so much of the tripe that is present-day,  la mode humor!

When it came avalible for DVD, I knew that I had to get it upgraded to that format.  I enjoyed all the unseen and added features that was on this new DVD box set.  I was just disapointed in the fact that they edited a few skits out of the Collection.  I love the skits with Johhny Carson and Julio Iglesias singing ""To All the Girls I've Love Before "" and the skit with the Smothers brothers.  Perhaps there were some issues on copyright laws to add these musical numbers on the DVD collection.

Also I wish there were more clips of him doing his skits and or interviewing all the intresting non-celebrities/animals. In my oppion the celebrities were the most boring aspect of this collection not to mention anybody under the age of 30 probably won't even remember who half the people on their were, which brings up another problem. Alot of the jokes haven't held up that well (don't get me wrong there are some really classic moments in this collection) for example on the very first B&W clip where Johnny goes into Kennedy having her 10th baby and the punchline being that there is only one bathroom in the White House leaves this critic a little flat (My grandma told me that was a really racy joke back in the day). Also alot of the skits revolved around current events and commercials that very few people remember. Like I said if you are under the age of 30 there is a good chance that you'll be left scratching your head.

The bonus features are intresting. One takes you behind the scenes of the show and you learned how everything worked, also one show Johnny doing some cool stuff like racing cars and sky diving. Also there is the rare NBC special called ""Johnny Goes Home"" where he goes back to Nebraska to see his old home. I could be wrong but I could that they edited this show. I remember it being alot longer.

I actually considered my purchase a complete waste until I saw the show where Johnny went back home for a visit. That was very nice to see, but I don't know if it makes this DVD worth purchasing.

It is a shame that such great shows have their guts sliced out of them for God only knows what. This process has made me extrememly leary of DVD purchases.",1166140800,13,737,4.411764705882353

1728952,5,B000068WS6,"Sometimes I start to review a certain item, and caution myself against it. Why? Because I know that there are other people who care about the book, movie, music, television show,  in question in a way I do not. They are passionate about it. They know it from inside. Consider the excellent review of J. Grabowski of the 'The Ultimate Carson Collection' on this Amazon site. It is outstanding, and cannot be matched by anything I, a very occasional watcher of Carson through the years, can say.

Nonetheless I'll just do what I often do in these reviews, simply write what I think. I watched Carson in and out, occasionally for many years. I never became addicted to it like some people I know. These were the ones who simply had to watch the 'Tonight' show every night. My guess is America had millions of these.

I think for most of the years I underappreciated Carson. I thought of him as kind of corny. And as I am not a special fan of what might be called 'physical humor ' I just did not care for some of the stuff. Also the various tics and repetitions, the whole hokum which goes with these shows, the various chitchat with Ed and Doc never really got me.

In latter years though I thought of the matter again, and became a bit nostalgic watching the show. He was quick- minded certainly and fast he had something else I really liked, great curiosity. He would bring someone like Carl Sagan on the show because he wanted to understand the stuff Sagan was talking about. He of course kidded and made fun of many guests but he did it without depriving them of their dignity. He gave them a chance , as far as I could tell, to get on whatever they wanted to say or promote.

Moreover he stuck it out for a long time. And what happens is when someone becomes familiar, even if you don't particularly like them at first , they sort of grow on you, and you get to feel you know them, and sort of like them. Old Johnny was like that.

When you think of it really , all these people who were so young once and so full in life, and who it seemed would last forever, and you understand that they are old or most likely, dead, it makes you kind of sad.

It's funny. The twentieth century invented this business of film and now you can see people actually acting, speaking moving as if they were alive. It's uncanny really. There is Johnny out there young as ever when you know he's somewhere else six - feet under. It's strange and it makes you sad.

This man probably entertained more Americans than any other person in history. Got more laughs. Made more people smile when they went to bed.

He deserves a lot of credit and recognition for that. And he certainly got it in buckets in his lifetime.

This does not however stop him from being , I guess what he always was, a kind of lonely quirky guy all troubled in himself.

1728957,4,B000068WS6,"Other reviews have pointed out flaws in the disc mastering and ""Best of"" segments, so I won't repeat those.

My biggest disappointment was in the way the final two shows were absolutely butchered.  The next-to-last show is missing an entire segment (the classic Ed Ames segment from 1965).  The major part of the segment is on disc 1, but still, deleting it from the show is unforgiveable.  The final show is missing a segment as well--a classic montage of the great musical talents who passed through Studio One.

Finally, the end of the final show--Johnny's farewell--is absolutely hacked.  All of the shots of audience members--Johnny's staff and family among them--were deleted. Those are some of the shots that add to the emotion of the very end of the King's reign.  When the video dissolved to credits, the music stopped--Doc and the band played to the end of the actual show.

There are still good things to recommend--""Johnny Goes Home"" is an interesting look at the man and his background.  The camera iso footage from the last show is a good ""behind the scenes"" kind of thing, and the ""Danger Johnny"" extra is some neat, rare footage from the 1960's.

Having said all of that, the quality of the entertainment make this worth having.  We'll never see the likes of Johnny Carson again.  And to be fair, take a look at the extra discs in the larger ""Special Collector's Edition""-the clips are longer, and show each performer in better context.  Very enjoyable.",1130803200,37,1469,4.804780876494024

This dvd set is great. It captures all of the highlights of Johnny Carson's career in Late Night. It has many of the major guests you would expect to see except for the early years because the tapes have been erased.  My major complaint with this dvd set is it does not have enough of the fabulous monoluges throughout the years.",1124928000,7,482,4.344444444444444
1728959,3,B000068WS6,"If you have the VHS tape collection that was released in the 1990's, you may want to hold on to them.  This collection contains the same episodes, however, there are some segments that were trimmed.  For instance, within the actual video files themselves on the DVD are the opening title cards used on the VHS tapes, e.g. ""KING OF LAUGHS!""  The control files on the DVD, though, start playing the video after that.  However, the major disappointment is in however actually authored these DVD's.

Sloppy and erroneous programming abounds on these discs.  For instance, if you use your remote to try to access the main menu directly, the 1 to 2 minute opening introduction plays.  You can Next skip past this BUT it loads the next video file in the stream, which on these discs can be any of the sub menus from the main menu.  You're forced to watch through it or fast forward just to get to the main menu again.  Disc 2 is entirely unforgivable because it's Scenes menu for The Best Of The 80's And 90's does not work at all on any player I tested, stand alone, computer, or otherwise!  Select your favorite scene, and, oh!  Nope!  It acts as a Start button instead, playing the VERY FIRST scene.  Regardless of the Scene you pick!

There are abundant video errors, too, converting the material.  Granted, some of the source video is not the best.  Many of the surviving Carson shows only exist on kinescope, basically using a film camera to record the broadcast off of a TV screen.  Still, most of the errors are in existing color material that has aired fine before on the VHS tapes and on TV.  For instance, one scene from Disc 1 clearly goes into off shades of solid green colors for a few frames.  Another develops wavy static momentarily.  Another has pixelated pink that shows up.

However, just in general, there's poor video conversion to begin with.  Even stuff from the 1980's and 90's on Disc 2 is blurry when things move.  Stuff appears to be slightly slow mo, too.  Like the old experience of video on a PC, frames are dropped, even though the DVD picture quality is higher.

Surprisingly, I found one of my favorite parts of the set to be ""Johnny Goes Home"", the 1982 documentary about Johnny's visit to his hometown.  It's not a ""laugh-a-minute"" show, and obviously wasn't meant to be.  It's a very warm, nostalgic trip back in time.  It's not the least bit boring, as some reviewers have said.

Let's hope the Carson family will decide to release more clips from the Tonight Show on DVD, perhaps even entire shows, so that those of us who fondly remember when Johnny was King of Late Night can see many more of our favorite moments.",1114300800,8,798,4.438356164383562
1728961,3,B000068WS6,"Despite the name, this DVD collection is not really the Ultimate Johnny Carson collection.  For those of you old enough to remember, this collection was first released on VHS videocassette way back in the mid-1990's. However, something happened during the transition from VHS to DVD as there are some scenes that have been edited out of the DVD version.
I find it ironic that on the box of the DVD collection, it mentions Madonna as being one of the guests, yet her clip never made it to the DVD version. However, she is in the VHS version. It fact, it appears that about 5 mins or so have been cut from each of the main shows (Best of the 60's & 70's; Best of the 70's & 80's; and Best of the 80's & 90's), to make room for some additional backstage footage. Or, what the footage that was cut out because Johnny no longer felt those scenes were some of his greatest moments? Or, maybe the scenes were cut because of the very lengthy intro each of the disc's have (just push the menu button on your DVD player's remote control to get to the main menu).
For those of you lucky enough to have the VHS version don't throw out your VHS tapes just yet, as you actually will be missing out on some of the funniest scenes. Because of this, I did not give the overall collection a perfect 5 stars. Instead, I 'discounted' stars as a result of the editing.
 I found the bonus prime-time special ""Johnny Goes Home"" rather boring actually, and actually took away from the funny 'show' moments seen in each of the three main shows listed above. Also, when viewing some of the back-stage footage, my DVD player froze on me twice, to the point that I actually had to turn it off and re-boot the DVD player. Maybe this was just my collection, I am not sure if others also have had this problem.
Despite these some of the shortcomings mentioned above, this is a good collection of Carson's work and unfortunately will probably only be the only collection every offered. But, most of the scenes are with Johnny and his guests, which really don't show Johnny shining at his best, and that of course would be when he was performing the monologue. Instead of the 'Johnny Goes Home' special, I wish the producers of this DVD collection instead put together some of Johnny's best monologue jokes over the years - because it was the monologue where Johnny really did shine.
For those too young to really remember Johnny Carson, or believe that the current Leno/Letterman late night war is where it is at, really missed out on a good thing and an amazing entertainer. To paraphrase Letterman on his tribute show to Carson, it was actually very upsetting to the audience to tune into the Tonight Show and find out that there was actually a guest host on instead of Johnny. After I heard that statement from Letterman, I do remember that when I used to watch the show and sometimes would just turn off the TV set in disappointment because Carson himself - the real deal- was not hosting that night.
I truly feel that Letterman's kind and truthful words just show what a late night monarch Carson was and how he will be so sadly missed in a world of late-night pretenders.",1113177600,15,3145,4.477351916376307
1728972,1,B000068WS6,"There is some good stuff on both discs two and three, but both are just so-so. There is way too much on the last JC show that was aired and the second to last show aired. An overemphasis on these programs takes away from the look at a great career.

To me, the only exceptional disc is the first. Some of the black and white excerpts are simply wonderful. The best of these is when Pearl Baily drags Johnny onstage for a command performance as part of a duet.

Other great segments include Dean Martin stealing the show without a word as George Goebel ( sic? ) is being interviewed.

And a cleancut George Carlin in 1966.

Strongly agree with another's comment that it was a mistake to show the Buddy Hackett interview. Hackett was a no-talent dimwit who wasn't funny then, and he sure ain't funny now.

It would have been easy to create a magical three discs of Johnny Carson moments. This is not it.

This slapdash, rushed effort could have used an editor.",1111795200,18,958,4.4147727272727275
1728973,1,B000068WS6,"Disc One has some great moments, but many of the clips were so-so at best. For example, the disc starts out with a very lame Buddy Hacket routine. It does have the wonderful segment with George Gobel, but then even that one was disappointing because they did not show the last of that segment, the part where Hope flicks ashes into Martin's drink. I saw that show when it aired, and it is among the top 5 best. But it could have been better.

Disc two has a few great skits, but the second half covers a large part of the next to last show, and that show is shown in its entirety on Disc Three.

I enjoyed this set of DVSs, but it wasn't worth the $30 we paid, and that's $20 less than the price here. I have to give this set at this price only a single star.",1110326400,13,759,4.0198675496688745
1728974,5,B000068WS6,"When Johnny Carson died on January 23rd, 2005, a huge void was left in the world of tv. For 30 years, America went to sleep at 11:30 with Johnny Carson. Though he kept a pretty low profile after he left the show in 1992, he still remained a legend in tv history.

""The Ultimate Johnny Carson Collection - His Favorite Moments From The Tonight Show (Vols. 1-3) (1962-1992)"" is 3 discs filled with some of the most memorable moments in the show's history, from Ed Ames' tomahawak throw to Buddy Hackett talking about his boat to Tiny Tim's wedding to Jimmy Stewart's poetry. Plus many of his great characters are here - Art Fern, Aunt Blabby, and of course, Carnac (Question: Dippy Doo? Answer: What forms on your dippy in the morning).

Disc 2 also features ""Johnny Goes Home"", a somber look at his return to his hometown in Nebraska. It features a surprisingly serious Carson as he returns to his house and his school. Disc 3 features Johnny's last 2 shows. First is his last show with guests. Featuring memorable appearances by Robin Williams and Bette Midler (whose serenade at the end is heartwrenching), it is a true tv classic. Then there's his last show, a look back at 30 years of laughter.

This is a great collection of classic American comedy. I hope that a second volume will come out to showcase the many more memorable moments from Johnny's 30 years on the show.",1110067200,9,1375,4.58130081300813
1728975,4,B000068WS6,"The news of Johnny's death really saddened me, as I always thought we'd hear one more xmas special or something out of him. Unfortunately, it seems, the networks rubbed him the wrong way, too bad for us. Otoh, I'm glad Johnny stayed Johnny till the end. I feel priviledged to have grown up watching Carson on late nights, he had a great personality and was great with people, and a great American, imho.

Most of the footage I've seen in the various 'tributes' after his death is in this set, which kind of spoiled it, but still nice to see again. I never thought much of the last couple shows, the Bette Midler singing has got way way too much airtime. I wish I had a few taped episodes from the 70-80's. Here's hoping that we see some in the future, sure there'd be some money in that, lol. Hey Ed, you're great too. I'll have to look for some old starsearch episodes now.",1109980800,,874,4.329268292682927
1728976,2,B000068WS6,"With the exception of the second-to-last show (with Robin Williams and Bette Midler), this is the same release as the Johnny Carson Collection released on Laserdisc years ago.

The only diffence is that the Laserdisc verson didn't drop every other video frame to give the picture a 'film look'.
You remember that dropped-video-frame film-look fad of the mid-1990's; that funny-looking blurred picture in Led Zep's No-Quartet/Unleaded video?  Well, it's back in the Johnny Carson Collection in all it's 15 frame-per-second glory.  (Thearical movies are presented at 24 frames/second.  Standard video is presented at 30 frames/second: 60 fields, and current DVD supports that format nicely.  Just not here.)  If the picture doesn't move, its ok.  But if anthing moves, hand-arm waving, camera panning, etc, the motion-blur due to the dropped frames is horrendous and distracting.  Believe it or not, the Laserdisc has both better picture and sound as NEITHER are commpressed!  (Back to ebay!)

This could of been a really nice presentation, but they ruined it with the dropped frames and lack of material.  And what is shown has also been trimmed.  Granted, 30 years is a long time.  But if you're going to show a clip, especially a classic clip, show the ENTIRE clip.  What's another 30 seconds?

The only reason I can think of for the return of the hated film-look is
to match the frame-rate of the earlier black & white kinescope masters, or to increase the storage capacity of the DVD set in order to keep the studios production cost down by releasing a three disc set instead of a FOUR disc set, God forbid!

Unfortunatly, this is the only comprehensive collection of Johnny Carson on DVD, and we're stuck with it!  Its too bad, really.  Johnny deserves better!",1109721600,5,1764,4.982876712328767
1728977,3,B000068WS6,"I am a huge fan of Johnny Carson and I debated on buying this DVD simply because of the price. I watched all of his shows rarely missing any. But this was a dissapointment as he has alot of shows with Richard Harris, Robin Williams, and alot of bands that would come sit with him the whole show and you would have a stomach ache the next day from laughing so hard. None of these were on this DVD. I would say out of the 30 odd years they only took maybe 5 years of shows out of it. I remember far funnier shows. He was the best there was, but if I could return this DVD I would cause it is lacking on so many great shows. I feel a little ripped off.",1107734400,6,649,3.8507462686567164
1728978,4,B000068WS6,"Although this ""highlights"" format isn't my first choice for how I'd like to see the Johnny Carson archives reissued, it's hard to argue with nearly three hours of mostly hilarious highlights (in three segments, basically covering the early, middle and later years of the show's 1962-1992 run).  It's fine for starters, but with so much quality material to choose from, one hopes for more in-depth DVDs to come (special videos devoted to multiple appearances by a single guest is merely one idea for how they could proceed).

These segments contain clips from Carson's monologues, some of his skits (Carnac, Carson as Reagan adapting the ""Who's on first?"" routine, etc.), chatting with famous guests (entertainers, political figures), a number of the more memorable segments with animals, children, and non-showbiz people, classic bits with Ed and Doc, and other highlights that have stood the test of time moreso than most other comedians of ANY era.  Carson is one tv legend whose brand of comedy is apt to continue to attract younger generations, even those too young to have watched the shows when they originally aired.  The humor is a charming mixture of still-edgy material with comedy appropriate for all ages.

I was disappointed that the last two shows from May 1992 are incomplete.  Among the no-shows are the memorable collage of music performers from the final episode.  Licensing problems, perhaps?  What does make the cut is classic, of course.  There is also an excellent 1982 prime-time special where a relaxed Johnny revisits his home town.  Not intended to be a comedy show, it is rather a highly-watchable peek at Carson away from the showbiz environment (revealing a down-to-earth side of him that will likely surprise a lot of viewers).  While there are a few other minor extras, it is the areas I mentioned that make this three-DVD set an excellent overview of television's all-time premiere late-night host.

1728979,5,B000068WS6,I bought and watched the 3 dvd set. It was really geat. I remember a few years back that direct tv showed entire episodes for one year. I believe you got two or three episodes a week for 5.95 per month. I of course being a huge fan gladly paid the money. After one year the service was cancelled. When I asked direct tv why it was cancelled they said that the owners of the Crason material did not wish to continue the deal. I know for this reason that there are a lot of full episodes. I wish that Carson productions would offer this deal to direct tv again.,1107388800,2,559,4.090909090909091

1728981,5,B000068WS6,"It's great, I've had it since it was released but as I observsed on Leno's tribute show for Johnny on the Monday following his death, there's a lot more in that vault. Just the bit with Johnny, Frank Sinatra and Don Rickles that was shown that night was terrific.

Here's how I see it: Cull throught each of the years that survived on tape, find the best guests and maybe show their entire interview or performance. Going that route, we could be watching ""new"" Johnny shows for years to come. Also many of those shows were 90 minutes long (before commercials)so the wealth of material has got to be staggering.

Sure, the Ed Ames bit is classic and had to be included in the first set, but we've seen it a million times. Time to dig deeper into the vault, especially now that Johnny's gone. Pop it into your DVD at 11:30 PM and pretend you're back there in the good old days(minus commercials).

Many of those are missing.  I watched the entire collection in shock and disappointment that almost none of my favorite memories were included..

Ok, so it's titled ""His"" favorite moments, not mine.  Still, you can't help but get the feeling that something very odd went into the production of this collection.  You can't quite put your finger on it, but it's almost like they couldn't publish many episodes without somebody's permission.  Certainly there's the possibility that Johnny didn't really choose these, or if he did, this was not the top choices on his list.  I just can't believe it.

I always loved Johnny's anniversary shows where he would break out old clips from over the years along with the highlights of the year just ended.  So the package seemed intringing, but I decided to rent first.  Good decision.

It is not that the content of the shows is terrible.  Far from it.  It's just woefully short on material to justify the rather steep pricetag of a 3 disc set.  Understanding that a lot of the tapes from the early years were destroyed years ago, there still had to be over 20 years of material to put together several more hours.  Instead, there is a ""Best of the 60s/70s"", ""Best of the 70s/80s"" and ""Best of the 80s/90s"" segment, each about 45 minutes each.  Many of the classics are here (the Ed Ames hatchet throw, George Gobel's brown shoes joke, the marmoset using Johnny's head as a restroom, Jimmy Stewart's poem about his dog Bo, even a very funny intro of future president Clinton), but there had to be more.  There were no Floyd R. Turbo (who I consider the first right wing militant) bits nor was my favorite Carnac the Magnificent moment included (the answer is Sis-Boom-Bah, the question: What sound does an exploding sheep make).  The latter omission is interesting because I seem to recall Carson saying at one time that that bit garned the biggest laugh in the show's history.

There's also Carson's last shows, which I actually already have on tape, so other than a better picture, it doesn't do it for me.  There's also a show from 1982 when Johnny went back home to Nebraska to visit old hangouts and friends that was interesting.

From 1962 to 1992, Carson reigned supreme as a comedian and broadcaster. Unlike Letterman and Leno, Johnny did his homework when it came to nightly conversation. No matter who sat on the couch, he remained an astute and observant host. ""The Ultimate Johnny Carson Collection"" is an expanded three-DVD set of ""Tonight Show"" highlights selected by Johnny himself, with the welcome addition of his final two programs. The set also includes the 1982 NBC special ""Johnny Goes Home"" - a nostalgic, affectionate look at Carson's return to his hometown of Norfolk, Nebraska.

My only gripe is that the music montage from the last show is missing, but this probably has to do with getting all the clearances from the artists, which can be difficult.
