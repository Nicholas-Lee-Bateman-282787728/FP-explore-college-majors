7823628,1,6302283604,Wow i am so disapointed with the dvd release that's 92 minutes it really took away from the original vhs version that was 104 minutes long! I remember being a kid and seeing this movie i watched it a dozen times and loved it! So when i saw it was on dvd on amazon i bought it without even reading the reviews. Platinum/echo bridge should remake the dvd without editing out most of the scenes that made this movie so impacting i think us viewers can handle the adult content that was originally in the movie without movie companies deciding what we should and should not see! I was so excited waiting for this to come in the mail and now im feeling bummed thanks alot platinum dvd and echo bridge.,1357344000,6,696,4.320610687022901
7823629,2,6302283604,"I recently purchased this DVD and after watching it I felt like I had just watched a television edit of this movie.  I got online and did some searching for the specs of the VHS version and it turns out that this DVD version has some 14 minutes of footage removed.  The original movie is 106 minutes and this DVD is 92 minutes (NOT 106 minutes like it says on this website).  It even has printed on the DVD box that it has an R rating.  The movie as it is on this DVD could easily get a PG-13 rating or maybe pass as a PG rated film. If you are in fact looking for a heavily cleaned up version of this film, this release might be your ticket.  But, if you think by ordering this you're getting the R rated thriller that you remember, think again, this DVD edition is the watered down TV edit.",1171670400,14,792,4.051282051282051
7823630,2,6302283604,"This is one of the scandalously few top billings in Barbara Hershey's career. As such, the iron-stomached film viewer will at least get to enjoy lots of BH screen time for his suffering. Other than that, not much.
Irrelevant but amusing: I read somewhere that during the filming of this movie Sam Shepard would whine every time he had to do anything involving the least bit of action. (Jackie Chan heroics are not involved, you understand.) What a wussy!",983491200,3,454,4.7594936708860756
7823631,3,6302283604,"The title of this thriller is both a pun on Barbara Hershey playing a  lawyer and the fact that she is being stalked, though the stalking is  dropped halfway. Hershey is perceived as a flake, partly because she  dresses ""unprofessionally"", wears wavy hair, and tends to talk to  herself. However luckily for us, this perception gives Hershey a  ""defensive"" atttitude (ho ho) and her acting has a bit more edge  than usual. Director Martin Campbell keeps her moving here, rather than  letting the camera settle on her, which ironically makes her look all the  more beautiful. Hershey's lawyer finds herself in a bind when she is  involved in the death of her married lover, who is also a client she is  defending for his association with a porno racket. The porno film that  opens this film actually looks pretty tame, and it seems odd to have the  female as the aggressor, though I suppose this is a male fantasy. When we  are told that the father of the actress seeks to punish all those involved  (and this includes Hershey by association) because the girl is underage,  something is off since the girl seems most willing in the footage. By  having Hershey fight with her lover and attack him, the idea that she has  killed him is raised, though surprisingly this is dropped quickly, all the  more surprising considering how savage her attack is. What's more of a  surprise is having Hershey represent Mary Beth Hurt as her lover's wife.  Hershey herself says this is not possible after she reports the death, and  thereby makes herself a material witness. Hurt pleads guilty to the murder,  and at one point Hershey challenges her by telling her she was always a bad  actress, recalling their shared college play. This line is particularly  unfortunate coming from Hershey, since Hurt is so much the stronger  performer. Even saddled with a ridiculous southern accent and drag-queen  fly-away hair (what was the hair-stylist thinking?!), she is the best thing  about the entire film, though not even she can save the pseudo-Fatal  Attraction ending. In spite of the schizophrenic treatment, Campbell  maintains our interest all the way through, though I could have done  without Hershey spilling red wine on Mary Beth's white carpet. Even though  she doesn't make much of an impression, it's still interesting to see  Sheree North in the supporting cast, as a reminder of what Marilyn Monroe's  later roles may have been if she had lived. Oh, and Sam Shepard's in it  too, and seems very bored.",968112000,6,2497,4.838862559241706
