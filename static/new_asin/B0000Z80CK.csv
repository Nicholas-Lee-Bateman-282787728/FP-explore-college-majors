-Green Day fans
-Blink 182 fans
-Fans of CKY and Jackass
The DVD is packed with backstage footage of tom delonge, mark hoppus, billy joe, mike dirnt, and a band called Kut u Up getting drunk and doing stupid things.  One of my favorite parts is when Billy Joe from Green Day brands one of the members of Kut U Up on his butt while hes drunk.  Its completely hilarious and has these live songs
Green Day
-Hitchin' a Ride
Blink 182
-Stay together for the Kids
-Anthem part II
Jimmy Eat WOrld

It is an hour and fifteen minutes long and really gives you a good look at actual tour life.

1961834,5,B0000Z80CK,"I love this film I watched it online but I loved it so much so I had to buy the physical copy. Great film it got me into jimmy eat world and green day also I now Love Kut U Up Great movie for any jimmy eat world , green day or blink-182 fan I Love This !!",1344729600,,255,3.413793103448276
1961835,5,B0000Z80CK,"this video may be focused on the band Kut U Up but the members of green day, blink 182, and jimmy eat world definitely make this worth watching. it gives a great perspective on the back stage areas of concerts and just what going into touring with a band. its definitely a great video worth checking out if you're a fan of the pop punk genre.",1331424000,,342,4.196969696969697
1961836,5,B0000Z80CK,"Este DVD es algo que cualquier buen fan de alguna de las bandas incluidas en el debe tener, no deben perderse la interaccion de los miembros cada banda.",1324857600,,152,4.464285714285714
1961837,4,B0000Z80CK,"Not as good as blink's Urethra Chronicles series, but definitely essential as a fan to blink or any of the other bands featured in this movie. Though the movie mainly focuses on up-and-comers Kut U Up, it also deals extensively with blink-182's Mark Hoppus and Tom DeLonge and Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong. If you're in a band and thinking about touring, this video will give you a tiny glimpse of what your situation might be like, though I doubt it'll be with Mark Hoppus. :D

This movie is hilarious; following the antics of Kut U Up and mostly blink-182, it gives you an inside look on each band and has extensive interviews with most bands featured in the DVD. This movie, coupled with the Urethra Chronicles series, are what made me fall in love with blink-182, because everyone on this movie seems so cool as people. It's great for fans of the bands, and highly recommended for a good laugh.",1238457600,,902,4.60248447204969
1961838,5,B0000Z80CK,"hillarious!!! Green Day was the main band I focused on but I do also love Blink-182! Then we get to jimmy eat world. Before i saw this dvd I didn't really know who they were. I had a karaoke machine and I had ""The Middle"" and so I listened to the vocal mix and it was awesome! now I am a big fan of jimmy eat world. But mostly green day is the best. Anyway, once again This is very funny. I laughed so hard I fell off of the couch on the floor hurt but still laughing redundant thinking of That DVD and laughing the rest of the day.",1150675200,,532,3.8454545454545452
1961839,3,B0000Z80CK,"Riding in Vans With Boys is a ""behind the scenes"" DVD. This dvd shows what happens behind the scenes after concerts and while on the road. This dvd shows very little of Green Day(which is the reason why I bought it). Although if you're a fan of Blink 182, Jimmy Eat World or Kut U Up you will like this DVD.

If you want to know what really goes on backstage this DVD is for you!",1146009600,,379,3.986842105263158
1961860,5,B0000Z80CK,"Blink 182 and Green Day have finally collaborated and created the best tour of that time. Kut u Up, a small local band, realize this as they follow the band on tour. And open the show.

As a small local band, they seem to bring the younger days of the members of Blink 182 and Green Day out into the open. As smoking, drinking and cussing young men they cause a laugh at almost every word. It is a complete must-have for Blink 182 fans, and those Green Day fans who are open to the fact that their boys may have been questioned their sexuality.

The bands get drunk, play for 30 minutes to an hour, walk off stage and get drunk again.

It's a must see for anyone who can relate; Fan or not.",1134086400,2,690,4.0962962962962965
1961861,5,B0000Z80CK,"I love this dvd...i watch it quite often! It's a nice 'behind the scene' sort of thing. Including: billie spanking, kissing and burning people, this dvd is a must for any green day fan. There's only one live performance for each band (green day, blink, jimmy..) and several snippets, but it's well worth your money. I am now a Kut U Up fan.",1128988800,3,340,4.412698412698413
1961862,5,B0000Z80CK,"Although Green Day are not in the movie all that much, the parts in which they are in, they totally steal the show. Any Green Day fan should buy this to watch, as should any Blink-182, Jimmy Eat World, or Kut-U-Up fan. Even if you are not a fan of any of those bands, you can watch some truely  hilarious bits in this movie. It shows full on punk tour antics at their finest. If you are a fan of the show Jackass, this movie will more than likely remind you of that. As I said previously, Green Day steals the show. It shows the wonderful Billie Joe Armstrong urinate on a wall before going to play their set onstage, branding Chris Cote's rear end with a pool cue, swinging from a chandelier, kissing random guys, and much more. If you like insane antics, this movie is well worth your money, whether you are a fan of any of the bands in it or not.",1120780800,4,849,4.1454545454545455
1961863,5,B0000Z80CK,"This is a great DVD. It's basically a band called Kut U Up (friends with Blink 182) going on tour with Blink 182 and Green Day, and the rest of the bands on the tour (not featured as much), all put together into a DVD from the point of view of Kut U Up. Fans of any of the bands featured should check it out.

The band featured the most aside from Kut U Up is probably Blink 182. They're in it a lot, interviews and just goofing around (and some concert footage too). I definitely recommend this DVD for any fan of Blink 182, it has a lot of them in it.

It also has sort of a lot of Green Day in it as well, but not as much as Blink. I liked it a lot because both bands are favorite bands of mine but Blink 182's my all-time favorite over the rest.

Kut U Up's actually pretty cool, too. They're friends of Mark and Tom (who brought them on the tour to begin with) and there's a lot of backstage and tour bus footage with them and Blink.

Billie Joe from Green Day is in it a bit too, along with Mike Dirnt...I didn't see Tre Cool that much, but he was in it too. Billie Joe brands Kut U Up's main singer on the butt and rides a chandelier across a room and falls...Mark talks about how Tom's always flirting with him, just to give a brief description of the type of stuff featured in this.

It interviews and talks to Blink 182 a lot and shows them (onstage and off) a lot as well. It doesn't interview Green Day but it shows them in many scenes as well just hanging out with the rest of them offstage and on tour. Jimmy Eat World is the other band on tour with them in this video, but it doesn't really feature them that much.

Any fan of Blink 182 should definitely get this, though! Also, any fan of Green Day should definitely at least consider getting this...and any fan of Blink 182 and Green Day together should absolutely definitely get this.",1116288000,,1852,4.074175824175824
1961864,5,B0000Z80CK,"Buy this DVD even if you aren't a fan of Green Day, blink, Jimmy Eats World or Kut-U-Up (although I guarantee that you will be a Green Day fan AFTER viewing it) because it is the funniest thing you will ever see.  This movie could have been a mess, but Oscar-worthy editing and a great sound track saved the day.  It's actually a good film, deserving of recognition.  We watch it at least once a week and sometimes twice a day.

My fave bits are:

-Green Day on stage (Mike Dirnt is wonderfully loose-limbed),

-a shirtless (and extensively tattooed) Billie Joe Armstrong rubbing cake in Mike's hair,

-Billie Joe spanking or kissing a variety of guys,

-Billie swinging from the chandelier of a two-story hotel room until it rips out of the ceiling and later limping down the hotel hallway dragging the chandelier like some demented party favor until he runs into Mike, who collapses in laughter,

-Billie branding a somewhat willing Chris Cote from Kut-U-Up (""How could I say no to the King of Punk?"") on the bum with a pool bridge (heated with cigarette lighters) after convincingly telling him, ""Just put a little Neosporin on it; it'll be fine, I swear!"",

-Billie proudly showing his charmingly horrified wife, Adrienne, the damage to Chris' ass.

The manic joy in Billie's eyes throughout these adventures is a thing of beauty.

My only regret is that Tre Cool isn't on camera more.  He's shown with his then wife, who appears to have a pretty tight rein on him, although near the end he does manage to get off a quick champagne toast, ""Here's to ass f*cking!""

""Riding in Vans with Boys"" is money well spent.",1108771200,78,1616,4.644366197183099
1961865,5,B0000Z80CK,"I was introduced to this DVD almost a year ago. Since, I have watched it about once a week. Regardless of whether or not you like Blink 182's ""Pile-of-Music"" or rock out Green Day, or even the stylin's of Kut-U-up this DVD is hilarious. The fact that all this happened unscripted makes it even better. The Soundtrack rules too, including music from YOVEE and Jimmy Eats World.",1096848000,13,376,4.626865671641791
1961866,2,B0000Z80CK,I went to 3 DATES on Pop-disaster and Green Day just blew away a very weak Blink 182 everytime me and my friends didn't even stay for all of blink's preformance for the last show in Oakland we were tired of singing and moshing to gren day's  set. Even Jimmy Eat World blew them away hell even Kut U up blew them away. I'm sure little kids could care less if they saw a good live show or not (majority of blinks fans now are under 12) but if you are a little older and have seen some great bands live then you know the difference between somebody good or even great and a band that doesnt put on a good show. The only reason i went to this concert was cause of green day and jimmy eat world. I don't know how blink could even attempt to close out shows night after  night when they were getting blown out of the water and everyone was tired from jumping around to all the Green Day classics which were played perfectly. Well Blink brings this dvd down a few notches.,1095897600,8,965,4.1005291005291005
1961867,5,B0000Z80CK,"I saw this tour when it rolled thru Chicago on June 15, 2002. Not sure if I saw Kut U Up or not, I don't remember. But Green Day put on the best show ever. And Blink sucked live of course, but the 15,000 teenyboppers didn't know that (I felt like I was at a Beatles concert cos they were screaming their heads off, but in a higher pitch which was annoying in its own right). Anyway, this movie is great. Sucks Tre Cool wasn't in it as much (i think he was in like 5 shots), but Billie Joe and Mike kicked ass. The aformentioned butt prodding was hilarious. I think the most serious-ish moment was Billie walking (drunk, of course) to his hotel room with the chandelier in his arm. I want to go on tour like this with my band and just have fun 24-7.",1078185600,,748,4.0608108108108105
8004761,5,B0000Z80CK,"This is the best rock and roll documentary I've ever seen. Biased in that it follows a tour with some of my favorite bands from growing up in Blink 182, Jimmy Eat World, and old Green Day. Shenanigans and wildness ensues as you follow a unknown band who gets the chance of a lifetime to tour with these major bands.",1498348800,,315,4.266666666666667
8004762,3,B0000Z80CK,I bought this CD specifically for Green Day. I doesn't show Green Day very much in the DVD. Its about the band that nobody knows about that isn't around anymore. Kut U Up.,1492992000,,171,4.212121212121212
8004763,5,B0000Z80CK,"This is basically a movie about Kut U Up with cameos by blink 182 (Travis Barker says nothing as usual), Green Day, and Jimmy Eat World (for like four minutes). I did not know who Kut U Up was when i first bought this but by the end of the rockumentary, I was in love with all four of the bandmates. If you're into early 2000s punk and drunk skaters, this is a great buy for you. Definitely worth the price and the soundtrack rocks!! With live songs performed by blink 182, Kut U Up, Green Day, and Jimmy Eat World. Also, my copy came with stickers. Pretty rad.",1484006400,,561,4.155963302752293

8004766,5,B0000Z80CK,Kut U Up is a great band. I watched this years ago because I love blink 182 but the DVD is about the band Kut U Up. This presents a great look into touring life circa 2002. They released an EP in 2013 (so two albums total). Both are worth a listen.,1416355200,,248,3.7884615384615383

8004770,5,B0000Z80CK,If you like blink-182 or Green Day this is a must have movie. It is so funny and shows you what it's like to be on the road. Iv'e seen it over 20 times.,1391385600,,152,3.5
