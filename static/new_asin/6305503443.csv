1038898,2,6305503443,"""Dream to Believe"" is a rather unrealistic movie about a female gymnast, Robin Cook (have heard that name before), who succeeds in making the 2-member team for some never-heard-of gymnastics meet in some high school gymnasium. And needing a 9.900 on her last event, floor exercise, after poor performances on bars and beam (where's the vault??) to tie with her fiendish teammate, she chalks up a perfect 10 (surprise, surprise!) The only reason to watch this movie -- a gymnastics fan or a fan of Keanu Reeves.",1124496000,,510,4.873563218390805

1038900,5,6305503443,"Hey!
A must for Keanu fans....
Ke gives a good early performance as  geeky Tommy Werneki, who gets the girl and helps her overcome her  trials.
He looks awfully cute and fresh looking and his love scene is  tender and caring.
Add this to your collection....!",968371200,7,258,4.565217391304348
1038901,4,6305503443,"This movie is entertaining and inspiring; but the most important reason to buy this is in 2 words: Keanu Reeves!
I won't give the story away except to say that Keanu is at his best romantic performance! You can not miss  this movie Keanu lovers!
""Dream to Believe"" will make you  realize that you indeed have to dream first in order to achieve anything!  If you desire something bad enough and are willing to work hard enough for  it, you can achieve it!  Reach for the stars!  You can do it! And if all  else fails, do like Olvia d'Abo did and just ""get your a#! across the  falls!""
Great 80's ""feel-good"" movie!  Don't waste your  time renting it; GO BUY THIS ONE!  You won't be disappointed!  Trust me!",960768000,4,705,4.37984496124031

1038997,4,6305503443,"I got this movie because I'm a big fan of Keanu Reeves. It is always great to see him in anything but I didn't expect that much from the film. I was pleasantly surprised. I found myself really getting into the story and rooting for Robin in her struggle. When she did her final routine I was actually nervous, just hoping she'd make it. Keanu was great and very adorable as Robin's supportive boyfriend Tommy. Tommy and Robin made a cute couple and I enjoyed their love story. I also liked her relationship with her close friend ,played by Jessica Steen. I've heard people complaining this isn't a realistic gymnastics movie but I have no interest in gymnastics so I couldn't care less. Cute and enjoyable little movie.",1402963200,,719,4.625
1038998,4,6305503443,"Dream to Believe is sort of a Flashdance for the gymnastics crowd, and that's a good thing. Good movie with great gymnastics, with a very young Keanu Reeves establishing that he would become a big star someday. This edition of the movie was watchable, too, an 8/10 on the viewing scale. Other DVDs and VHS tapes are so poorly transferred you can't sit through them - believe me, I bought all of them!",1395705600,3,400,4.493150684931507
1038999,1,6305503443,This movie was horrible. It looks like the DVD was made from an old VHS tape. The audio on the second half was out of sync. Not worth a nickel. I couldn't even watch the last half of the dvd due to distortion. I can't believe someone actually sold this.,1341532800,2,253,4.08

1039001,3,6305503443,Was super excited to finally find this movie on DVD one of my favs! The only problem was maybe 15 minutes before the movie ended there was a glitch which seemed to have cause a 2 second lag in the sound... so it was like watching a foreign film. Slightly disappointing.,1317686400,,269,4.294117647058823
1039002,3,6305503443,"I have seen 1.33:1 vhs releases, and 1.77:1 dvd from overseas.  I wonder what aspect ratio the dvd's really are listed here.  You can't trust amazon's info.
  Here is the rub.
After compareing the vhs and wide dvd, I have determined the aspect ratio of the celuloid negative is about 1.66:1.  The wide dvd I have seen was cut on the top and bottom.  The vhs is not cut on the top and bottom, but is cut on the sides.  So neither is correct.
Studio's are releasing most everything 1.77:1 (16x9) which is a compromize between 35mm and 70mm film.
I would much rather they release things ""the extact size of the celuloid negative"" Period.  When high end dvd players first came out, there was a lot of choices for zooming. 1.2x, 1.4x etc.. This worked well for the odd sized dvd's like ""countess dracula"" which was 1.66:1.  Now they just crop everything to 1.77 no matter the size.
This ruins films shot in 1.33:1 and 1.66:1.",1309651200,,920,4.461077844311378
1039003,2,6305503443,"I only today, picked this up at the 99 cents only store today, and I still think I got ripped off. ""Dream to Believe"" is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama and $1 is just too freakin' expensive for this. This film is probably only notable for 2 things: 1. It has a young Keanu Reeves. And 2. It's directed by Paul Lynch, the man who also did Promo Night. Now onto the movie.

It's about a girl named Robin (Played by Olivia D'Abo) who is badly injured from a car accident that also cost her father's life. So the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastic tournaments, she is often picked on during her classes and eventually she meets some wild kid named Tommy (Played by Keanu.) Robin, when not in training, works part-time, along with her mother and stepsister, at a Laundromat owned by her abusive stepfather. Eventually she is chosen to compete.

Overall, Keanu alone and some catchy 80s tunes are what prevent me from giving this 1 star, and it's also not one of the worst movies ever, but still far from good. The DVD itself is not getting any medals either as it appears to be sourced from an old VHS and towards the end, the sound goes out of sync and when the end credits are almost over, it fades to black, even though sound can still be heard. So this can probably be passed as a bootleg. The DVD artwork makes no sense either as it has what appears to be recent photos of Keanu and Olivia and the background has nothing to do with the movie, as it's also not in the movie itself, so the cover's obviously photoshopped. In any case, avoid at all costs, unless you're a Keanu fanatic. I probably won't be hanging to it any longer. I'm probably gonna give it to The Cinema Snob, who's a great YT critic btw. Hey, if any of you have any crappy movies that they no longer want in their sight, feel free to donate to him to keep his show running.",1223424000,7,1874,4.3210227272727275
1039004,3,6305503443,"The gymnastics was HIGHLY unbelievable but of course being a gymnast, I must have rented it a billion times back in high school (can it be 20 years ago??).  And of course, the fact that ""newcomer"" (this was pre-Bill & Ted, etc.) Keanu Reeves was in it.

I think she did something like 7 tumbling passes in her floor exercise.  Yeah, right!  Can we say ""technical advisor""?? But still a nostalgic choice.",1126828800,,403,4.555555555555555
1039005,3,6305503443,"I saw this 100 years ago (OK - it was 1986) and must have rented it a billion times because of the gymnastics and this is where I was first introduced to the hottie Keanu Reeves.

Not very realistic in the gymnastics department but then, no ""gymnastics"" movie ever is. I am going to get it out of nostalgia and will let you know how it holds up nearly 20 years (!) later....",1126828800,8,374,4.123287671232877

7890484,2,6305503443,"They wrote ""Digitally remastered"" but probably they refer to ""Coach of the year""
only.
The movie ""Dream to believe"" is like the other DVD,4/3 most similar to a svhsrip
than a DVD remastered.
But a little better than others.

7890485,2,6305503443,"They called this a DVD,but is like a bootleg!
I love this movie,and I had two dvd release
one is this,and the other one is worst than this(
but at least audio is on sync).
The colours are slighty ""alive"" than an old 80 vhs
and better than the other dvd.
there are some distortions and at the end of movie the screen become black and music continue(sic!)
And finally...the audio is TOTALLY out of sync on second half..
2-3 seconds delay!
So i vote.. from 0 to 10

Not fatal, but you may be used to sharp images.
