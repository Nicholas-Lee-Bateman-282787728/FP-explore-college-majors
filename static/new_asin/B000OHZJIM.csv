2794995,1,B000OHZJIM,"Here is Dana Andrews in probably the worst role of his career. In ""Hot Rods to Hell"", he plays a moron who gets all huffy about some kids who got a little carried away while having fun. He then proceeds to do his best to annoy them until the confrontation escalates to tragic consequences. Yet somehow the director apparently doesn't think it is his fault.

Excuse me. What part of ""ignore them and they'll get bored and go away"" did he not understand? This movie makes adults look like idiots. No wonder the 60's turned out the way they did. <Sardonic grin>

This film barely managed four stars out of ten at IMDB - just slightly better than ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". I guess I'm not the only one who disliked it.

Why did they waste resources and the plastic to put this tripe out on DVD when there are so many other excellent films they still haven't released? How about a Dana Andrews classic like ""While the City Sleeps""?  Oh well.",1182470400,4,937,4.398843930635838
2794996,3,B000OHZJIM,"I remember seeing this as a kid, double-billed with GOODBYE CHARLIE, at the McDade Drive-In. Maybe I'm just nostalgic for simpler times - the ""juvenile delinquents"" in this film are pikers compared to the drug-addled, sex-obsessed and gun-toting mutants that appear in films these days - but having seen it recently on Turner Classic Movies, I realized that it wasn't a bad little film. If I read correctly somewhere, this was originally one of the first made-for-TV films out of MGM studios that the powers-that-be decided to release theatrically. Anyway, if you long for the days when hot rods were good ol' American beauties, (unlike in the FAST AND THE FURIOUS series) you might enjoy this fast-paced little thriller.",1181606400,39,721,5.067226890756302
2794997,1,B000OHZJIM,"Dana Andrews made his mark in 1940s classics like ""Laura"" and ""The Best Years of Our Lives."" Two decades later, he was struggling to keep his career alive in low-end ""B"" movies like ""Hot Rods to Hell."" Frankly, this movie gives the ""B"" label a bad name, because ""Hot Rods to Hell"" just plain old-fashioned sucks. The plot is thin, the acting is wooden and the direction and pacing are rock-bottom. At 100 minutes, the movie is at least 10-15 minutes too long. Even worse, it's almost like watching an MGM-produced social engineering movie about youth gone bad and the dangers of driving recklessly.

If you're into camp, you'll probably enjoy ""Hot Rods to Hell"" on some level. For every other movie viewer, it's a 100-minute sentence in hell.",1181520000,8,742,4.751937984496124

The plot is there a bunch of juvenile delinquents looking for trouble in a beautiful Corvette,Despite the Corvette being a little bit hopped up and sometimes seems a little ugly it is still neat. The sounds may be off from the car,but again this neither takes away from the movie or the car itself. To me the Movie is the Corvette and the story is secondary for this one.

En route they cross paths with two reckless hot rod drivers racing down the flat desert roads. When the young punks realize the old square is taking over their teen hangout, they will stop at nothing to drive him out of town.

This movie is beautiful to look at, and the cars are motorized pieces of art, and the score and soundtrack are fantastic! But the script and entire plot of the film are mind numbingly stupid. If it stopped there, then I don't think I would recommend this film, but what pushes it into ""must see"" territory are the over-acting performances. Everyone in this film seems set out to chew up scenery, and out-act everyone else in the scene! It's truly laugh out loud funny, and Jeanne Crane as Peg Phillips, the main character's wife should win some kind of award! How did MST3K miss this one?",1415923200,,1010,4.549450549450549

2795137,2,B000OHZJIM,"I know a lot of reviewers here are awarding 4 and 5 stars to 'Hot Rods to Hell' (MGM, 1967) as a sort of blanket, tongue-in-cheek tribute to juvenile-delinquent/drugs-and-dune-buggies flicks of the '50s, '60s and '70s, but this is one truly awful movie, even taken as cult candy.  Yes, you can laugh at the horrible acting, the ridiculous scenarios, the lousy action effects, plodding direction, amateur editing and the cornball dialogue delivered by hopelessly clichd characters; what makes this a tough sell, however, is that poor Dana Andrews and Jeanne Crain-- once-respected actors from Hollywood's late gilded age-- playing the dimwitted parents of two dimwitted children all being 'terrorized' by a well-groomed gang of dragster-driving glee-clubbers, actually are trying (fairly unsuccessfully) to rise above the z-grade material they're given to work with by offering earnest, intense performances, and don't seem to know they're part of the joke.  There are dozens of these types of drive-in exploitation films-- most of them independent releases (AIP's 'The Born Losers' came out the very same year, in fact)-- that are cheesier and more depraved on the one hand, more suspenseful and culturally astute on the other, and certainly better suited to audiences with such, ahem, niche appetites.  HRTH, by comparison, is just kind of sad.  About the only bit of good news is that Warner's DVD (one disc, not two as Amazon's specs above indicate) provides a clean anamorphic-widescreen print with a trailer.  Film earns 1 star, presentation 3 1/2.",1388707200,3,1553,5.296747967479675

It has great `60s decor and clothes and hair, and man do I dig the scene at The Arena! I always wanted top hang out there. It has cheesy acting by Dana Andrews, as a way too jittery man! And his wife is annoying too. There are some great characters, and racing, making this a J.D. cult movie collection favorite.

All the flaws that some negative reviews have mentioned are precisely what make the film so enjoyable, as a dysfunctional middle-American family is harrassed by hot rod hellions (or what passes for them here), lured by the overwrought, lust-arousing wantonness of daughter Mimsy Farmer, giving her all as a willfully loose girl mocking Mom & Dad with her wild ways. We know exactly where this film is going from the start, and it's guilty pleasure all the way as we wait for harried, neutered Dad to finally hit the boiling point & explode. Let's face it, sometimes we all need something that's this much delirious, bad-in-a-good-way fun -- and it really delivers the goods!",1378166400,2,846,4.841379310344828

I hadn't seen this film in 25 years and suddenly there it was in front of me, a dvd, with the original movie poster artwork right on the case. Dana Andrews gives a serious performance as a old school dad who ends his suburban life and heads out to face some unexpected ""animals."" Animals being the teenagers who harass his family in hot rods while on the sun lit deserted desert roads of California.

  Dads at a distance by phone as we're introduced to the main characters who show their cute family affections at home during Christmas.  Mom, played by an under-rated Jeanne Crain, daughter Tina played by the gorgeous Laurie Mock, and seemingly 12 year old spunky son Jamie played by a second tier credited Tim Stafford. Dad gets a bit morose after a near fatal car accident on his return home to the family. This induces a semi reluctant property deal of Uncle Bill's to buy a motel in no mans land. The family packs and off they go.

Nothing like the teeth gritting smiles and wide eyed looks of a mid sixties teenager to charge you up. Enter Duke, the hot rod king and mega sixties siren Mimsy Farmer who plays Gloria, Dukes brassy mouthed flunky. They and the gang do the chasing while dear old dad is just about to crack. One close encounter after another gets dads already frayed nerves to the boiling point while in route to supposed peace. Pops wisely takes a detour into a picnic area for refuge where Duke tries to sneak up and work some ""magic"" on daughter Tina.

A worthwhile side story involving an arrogant pedal heavy dad and his son at the picnic area works while the real driving force of Dana Andrews carries on with his cranky fed up demeanor. Arriving at the wild atmospheric motel which they intend to purchase, dad rescues Tina from the clutches of Duke with murderous rage.  Some jumping sounds emit from the motel bar courtesy of Micky Rooney Jr. And His Combo strumming some nice electrics. Moms always there, never disappointing with her plucky supportive dialogue, especially as Tina stokes her ire on the evils of boys. As we race towards hopeful survival some harrowing techniques by dad end up relaying what he was really made of. Duke and the gang turn out to be the punks the teens of that generation thought were hip ,while Daddy O is pretty cool after all.

Hot Rods To Hell epitomizes the 1966 era. I always believed that Laurie Mock should have gone further in films with her natural style and good looks. The generic sixties soundtrack throughout keeps time and pace. The small missing dialogue between Duke and Tina is a downer and inexplicable but having the film available at all compensates. Hot Rods To Hell is a classic because of its family focusing universal effectiveness. It rises above the mockery of it's meager means. It's time for a definitive release containing extras, baby, extras!",1340409600,,3016,4.654135338345864

Man, she must have been one of the most gorgeous females on earth during that time period. If there's anyone who could have given Elizabeth Taylor some serious beauty competition, Laurie Mock was definitely it! She's the reason I give this film 5 stars and what really makes it worth watching. Of course, Mimsy Farmer (Duke's girlfriend in the film) is no slouch either. She's a doll. But to me, Laurie Mock is a goddess. And it doesn't get any better than that!

For those who might be interested, she now lives in Culver City, CA with her husband (lucky guy) Frederick S. Smith and they are both very successful real estate developers. And from what I've read, they are also highly regarded for their humanitarian contributions to society. She is still amazingly beautiful at age 67.

He at the time was a huge drunk, you would be too if you were in a movie like this. Jeanne Crane has got to be the worst actress ever. She overacts way too much and way too often. Duke is an average 50's, 60's type punk that always has the girl and the car. His girlfriend is retarded and so is everything else about this flick. I love it because it's just, stupid! It is hilarious. A Sam Katzman production makes it even better. He is the famous producer of several classes drive-in b movies. You're going to want to pick this one up. You know, just for kicks!",1299715200,3,913,4.308139534883721
2795205,5,B000OHZJIM,"Dana Andrews' drinking got him into plenty of trouble. For example, it landed him the lead in this 1967 movie, originally made for TV, which was given a theatrical release for its ""intensity"". HOT RODS TO HELL is, despite itself, a minor low-budget classic. I love One-and-a-Half-Star movies. They always transcend themselves.

Andrews is Tom Phillips, who is badly injured in a collision with a drunk driver. Unable to keep working, he decides to semi-retire and take up as the owner-manager of a small roadside motel in a small California town where he, his wife, his teenage daughter, and his young son can live quietly.

What nobody (particularly the motel's departing owner) tells the Phillips family is that the motel is being sold because it has become the hangout of a gang of local hot-rodders who are making the townsfolk miserable. When Phillips shows up, the hot-rodders decide to run him off. The local authorities decide that their own homegrown troublemakers are preferable to these strangers who have shown up and are now so unreasonably demanding protection from all this pointless harrassment. The cops do nothing.

Instead of sensibly packing it in and leaving his obviously wonderful new neighbors and their obnoxious auto club in the rear-view mirror, Phillips decides to have a turf battle with the hot-rodders on their turf---the roads around town. This private war ends in a terrifying game of ""chicken.""

As a kid, this was a scary movie. The storyline is at least ten years out of date, belonging more to the 1950s than the 1960s, but the modified Detroit Iron in this picture is a real treat, and the hammy acting and unlikely situations have made this a cult classic well worth having and watching.",1284940800,4,1726,4.941379310344828

2795209,5,B000OHZJIM,"This is one of the top three funniest movies I have ever seen. The other two were comedies. Seems that almost everything needed to produce a quality film was missing when this bad gem was thrown together. Leading man in the 3rd stage of alcoholism, a terrible director, no budget, no time, the Mickey Rooney Jr. Combo supplying the music. Andrews obviously couldn't remember lines and sometimes seems to forget how to even speak correctly. The budget was so low (made for TV) that it seems they ended up using takes that would normally have been done over. I wouldn't lay into Dana Andrews so hard but I know that he beat the bottle sometime after this was made and he helped many, many people to do the same. I also belong to a HR2H club but there are only three of us. This DVD is wonderful in that when the movie made it back to the small screen via late night tv movies, many scenes had been cut to make room for commercials. Now they're all here for anyone to enjoy. I swear we have found over 100 things wrong in this movie, each one of them worth a laugh if you like that sort of stuff.

The story is bad, the perspective of teens is bad ... the acting is worse than bad .... and that is what is fun about this film.  Who when being chased by a fast 'hot rod' filled with crazy kids ... bent on having fun, wouldn't shriek in a high whinney squeal ""Why won't they leave us alone!""

Dull plot lines and bad acting pervade this story about a father driving his family around on vacation when they encounter teenagers driving around in their fancy hot rods. One of them was a 1962 Corvette, I think. The old man was such a fuddy duddy that he even blurted out that driving ""55 mph"" was ""fast enough."" This was 7 years before the 55 mph speed limit. As for the rest of the film, I liked the drunk old man who drove a little recklessly exclaiming ""those 30 mile zones are muuuurder.""

Driving a fast,cool car with a sidekick and a pretty girl dangling off of the roll bar. The film was an overacting mess from the first scene,but the themes of redemption,self discovery and rising to the occasion like a true man has to are timeless and actually endearing. After forty yrs I saw it again last night. It is beyonddescribing to people not of that era. Just buy some pizza and beer and invite everyone. Almost every performance in the film is laughable,but there remains a thread of sincerity that wins you over in the end. The idea of evil young men terrorizing innocent americans to the tune of surf music is something everyone needs to experience. I feel it is a great way to show viewers how out of touch the hollywood people were with the fast changing times. The overbearing cop,the obnoxious drunk,the whiney teenage girl,the thoughtless playboy town brat,the ultimate insquare parents,the seedy hotel owner,it just manages to get better and better. You also get a glimpse at period hot rod equipment. The poor beaten 1958 Corvette used in the film is smoking so bad you wonder how they made it to the end of the film. Its an hour and a half look at another time,a far,far more innocent time. A time where clean cut kids threatened to dance,flirt,make some noise and,God forbid,drive over the speed limit out in the middle of nowhere. Seemed sosinister in 1966. Almost comforting,now.

The story line synergizes the acting and actors to deliver a profound delivery of what can be not only the individual character aspects, but also an insight into the true meaning to life.

So many people whom I work with love this movie. We have a Hot Rod to Hell fan club. We go to the site of the road filming at Wilsona Gardens each year in January for a weekend to hold an amateur radio Special Event for each anniversary of release of Hot Rods to Hell, 27 January 1967. This last January we had enough of us to show up (the 40th anniversary) to act scenes from the movie right at the original locations and film them on video. For many others and me this film has been defining our lives since we first experienced it in our early teens, so long ago.

I mean Dana Andrews had so many outstanding roles such as in The Best Years of Our Lives and Laura it is hard to believe he ended up in this stinker.  Jeanne Crane looks wonderful but spends the whole movie screaming and making faces meant to convey fear that are just hilarious.  Just goes to show you how important a believable script and a good director are in making a movie.

Filmed in only 2 week's time in the desert outside of Palmdale,Ca. this low budget ""B"" movie was intended to be a ""Movie of the Week"". Made back in 67', it was a little racy (no pun intended), for the masses. It has become a cult movie for anyone who loves cars of the late 50's~early 60's. And what makes this movie so good you ask ? Well ,how about, bad acting, so-so plot, bad editing, low budget, Kool cars & Gloria. Did I mention Kool cars & Gloria? Dukes bad-to-the-bone '58 vette still looks as good as when I first saw the movie back in 1968. I still to this day want a straight axle corvette !!! Made in a time when these ""Bad Seed Teens"" seem mild to today's real life gun toting teen's of today. I believe if this was made  into a video game today, teens would spend less time playing video games !! It's that bad in a good way. Sit back, relax & enjoy. The Fast & Furious has nothing on ""HOT RODS TO HELLS"". If you don't enjoy this movie , well, you probaly won't enjoy the 60's. I wonder why they never gave Elvis a shot at Duke's part?

Duke, in his sexiest voice possible, slowly begs Tina to ""Turn on, Baby!"" My friends and I went wild laughing till it absolutely hurt! Funniest line ever, never to be forgotten. Imagine my utter disappointment when this movie finally gets released on DVD and they edit the line out! Just like TNT did when they aired it a few years ago. Can't believe they need to protect our ears from the horrible druggie language of the time. Very disappointing! All of you should be able to hear it. It was GREAT!

2795232,5,B000OHZJIM,"This film is amazing.  Originally made for NBC as one of TV's first color Movies Of The Week, it was deemed ""too hot"" for TV!  The acting is so over the top, the script is beyond terrible, yet is all adds up to one of the most enjoyable nights at the movies you could ever ask for. Dana Andrews plays a man who's suffered a terrible automobile accident and although apparently physically recovered, is now riddled with self doubt.
Thankfully his high strung wife Jean Crain (in full co-dependent, full on denial mode)  has all the faith in the world that he'll one day return to being a fully functional man (don't miss the final scene for the answer to this).  Thankfully they have a Doctor who perscibes peace and quiet (and plenty of it!).  So they buy a motel in he desert, as you do in this kind of film.
But there's no peace to be had when the local teens run WILD! WILD I TELL YOU!
The teens look a fast 25, speak like jazz heads from the 50's and are very, very rude!
But Crain and Andrews are the real show here, they don't leave any scene un-milked for maximum DRAMA!
A palatable sense of career desperation gently wafts between them, as if they both believe that by overacting to 11 they can somehow lift this turkey.  They can't, they don't and let's all thank god for their bold, misguided attempt.
Highly reccomended.",1183248000,9,1331,4.390243902439025
2795233,5,B000OHZJIM,"The other reviewers really don't get the appeal.  HRTH has been a favorite BAD movie of mine since I was a teenager in the 70s, when I first saw it on late-night TV.  It was gloopy even then.  Sure, Dana is awful, wooden and pedantic.  But that is what fans of this movie really love.  And how about Duke's immortal line when he tell's Laurie Mock's character that her father better not take over Dailey's Motel (which also contains the ""cool kids"" nightclub hangout) or ""No one's going to have any fun...not even you.""  Heavens what a threat!

The movie is chock full of dopey lines and Jeanne Crain's overacting is a real hoot.  Anyone who is buying this should be doing so with their eyes wide open, knowing that while the makers had no idea they were making a Camp Classic, that is just what this is.  Filmmakers could not make it as unintentionally funny, if they tried.  In fact, I've heard that someone is trying to remake the film under it's original title: ""52 Miles to Terror.""  If they ever do, I'll probably see it, knowing that they'll update it and make it like the ""Fast and Furious.""  And I'll probably be a little sad, as the original, for all its flaws has an undercurrent of naivite that is endearing.  A modern remake will be brutal and remorseless, much like our world is today.",1182643200,46,1299,4.453389830508475
