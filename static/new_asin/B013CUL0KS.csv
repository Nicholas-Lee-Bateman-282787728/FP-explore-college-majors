8727322,4,B013CUL0KS,This is an art movie. It is enjoyable to watch because it is very unique. It is a silent B&W movie. It has comedic simulated violence in it and some tasteful yet graphic nudity male and female. Several nude women attractive in that they are normal women without airbrush or plastic. Dustin Mills jumps from Art to mindless trash to genius in his movies. Always fun to see what is next.,1518566400,,385,4.436619718309859
8727323,5,B013CUL0KS,"A truly unique movie for the modern age. Black and white, silent, and comprised of vignettes. The use of masks was a great way to shake things up and make it unlike other films. The awesome director took a huge risk trying this and I think it paid off, would love to see more like this! Highly enjoyable!",1438646400,,304,4.258620689655173
