I know this movie was a box-office flop, and I can see how it would be hard to get for someone who wasn't a hard-core KITH fan.  So I guess that really limits the audience, and the need to re-do it on BR.

There is much in this movie that is, both, mainstream funny and wildly inappropriately funny. (Cancer Boy is one of my favourites.) The best thing about this movie is that is sustains multiple viewings, and remains funny with each viewing.

795306,3,6304125941,"""Say, if a TV comedy troupe like Monty Python can have a film career, why can't we, the Canadian equivalent?""

Back in the late 80's/early 90's, when you wanted sketch comedy that wasn't live at 11:30pm, you went to HBO's The Kids In The Hall. These five guys hailing from Canada produced some of the best satirical comedy and characters for their time. Filmed before a live studio audience and with pre-planned filmed bits, they gave that generation their own Monty Python of sorts. So when the show ran it's course by 1994, the guys decided it was time to take the plunge into motion pictures like their British heroes. They then wrote a script about a scientist working for a ruthless pharmaceutical company who creates the ultimate in happiness pill with disastrous results, as well as playing the majority of the male and female parts, it was going to be a smash because the TV series was such a big hit with a loyal following, right? Although, when the film was made and released there was one problem.

It's not funny.

Not that they made a serious drama about the subject, it's just that there's not a gut-busting laugh in the entire film. If I had to give it a title, humorous satire would fit the bill. And while they created great long-running characters on the show, none of them are really used here (okay, a couple are, but barely) and the new characters are quickly forgotten once the wig is removed. Of course, the casual fan was turned off by the movie in '96 and so ended the film career of KITH. Looking back, the film hasn't gotten any better, McKinney's Don Roritor is a pale copy of producer Lorne Michaels (done much better by Mike Myers less than a year later), McDonald as the lead character Chris Cooper seems like the wrong actor for the part, and mainstay Dave Foley is barely in the film at all due to his feelings on the script and doing just fine for himself on his own with 90's TV show Newsradio.

Truthfully, the only reason why I picked it up is that recently this film/DVD has gone out-of-print. While I'm not too sure why, lately these guys have reunited together for live gigs even more than The Eagles, so I can only assume that this bare-bones release will soon get an extras-filled/commentary version....maybe with an explaination from the guys as to what went wrong. So in conclusion, if you can see it easily (read:cheap), give it a view, but if you're a fan of the TV show but haven't seen Brain Candy yet, prepare yourself for one bad trip, man.

Quite a few familiar characters come out, but there are plenty of new ones to get exited about. Bruce McCulloch especially impressed me. I knew he was talented, as one of the Kids, but he really held his own throughout the film, and actually delivered most of the laughs, for me. While the Kids are all hilarious, the movie is far too real and relevant to today's drug industry. I don't want to say too much...JUST WATCH IT!

795364,4,6304125941,"The movie is funny, but not the type of comedy that will have you rolling out of your seat, perhaps because the subject matter deals with such a grave problem. It combines both farce and satire to bring to light crucial points about our society and its blind acceptance of an industry interested in one thing: money. People will do and say most anything to keep their job and corporations will sell their souls to make a profit. Drug companies are not nearly as regulated as one might think and won't hesitate to distribute faulty products for a buck.

The plot depends on a skillfully exploited and highly improbable situation. Cross-dressed characters are exaggerated, which adds to the derision of the pharmaceutical industry. Enjoy. Worth a view.",1174780800,,750,4.905511811023622

795366,3,6304125941,"The Kids in the Hall have always been reliable in having incredibly sharp aim when throwing stones at the establishment and here they surprise even me with their pinpoint accuracy. In ""Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy"" they throw the gloves off to expose pharmaceutical industry as the cutthroat zoo that it is. Just being brave enough to call attention to the fact that there is a difference between clinical depression and ""I Just Got Kicked to the Curb"" depression is impressive. But they go further than that, showing depression to be something that isn't all bad because nobody would really want to live in a world where neighbors prance up and down the street singing about how gay they are, or in one where rock stars don't have a problem in the world so they are stuck singing Sesame Street-esque lullabies. I've battled depression a few times myself, and never once did I swallow one of those thought quenching pills.

The Kids in the Hall have many targets here, and they are all deserving. Corporate life in general is first on the list. The CEO is an infantile idiot who surrounds himself with Yes Men who spend their days trying to match the carpet to the color of the boss' socks. Anybody who were to wander into their boardroom would find quite the sight indeed. The problems being discussed is not whether the drug is safe but rather what color it should be. The head of marketing is under the impression that he is some sort of idol (""So I'm driving around in my $62,000 car""). And said wanderer would be ridiculed for being too intelligent. I took extra enjoyment out of watching the cop scene, as they proclaim victory (""We always win"") even though they only caught one of the dozens of perps that they were after. People in general are also called out, rightfully so, for being too fixated on happiness and for what makes them happy.

I will admit that in my case they were probably preaching to the choir. I already know these things. But in a country who still believes in ""Support our Troops"" and ""Greed is Good"" it can only help to point out that, in fact, the military is kinda gay and corpos are a stand in for Satan. The comedy here is hit and miss, but considering that sketch comedy is mostly miss and miss I would say that they are ahead of the curve. The ending gets a little too silly, especially with when people become paralyzed within their own happiness. But that allows them to go through and show us their happiest moments which was quite hysterical. If you have seen the TV show before you know what to expect in the acting department. Honorable mention goes to Bruce McCulloch and his portrayal of Cisco the twitchy, heartless marketing guy. I recommend this film for everybody, but mostly for those of you who have wondered about the difference between illegal and prescription medication. The difference of course being that illegal drugs can't go on trash TV to promote itself. The film has a worldview that is right on. Too much leftist cinema today is somber and depressing, this one at least makes you laugh while making you depressed, and then reminds you that depression is a good thing anyways. ***1/2",1172188800,5,3147,4.607843137254902

If you've had a chance to see the skit comedy of ""Kids in The Hall"" (and it's nothing like Dave Foley's ""News Radio""), this movie is above & beyond what they were able to do with the show.

If you haven't seen ""Kids in The Hall"", take a look for old rerun episodes on Comedy Central. It is similar to SCTV - oddball skit tv by some wildly funny Canadians. I actually find ""Kids"" to be funnier than Monty Python.

This movie has a plot, silly characters, and a relatively satisfying ending. It contains a few funny musical numbers, too.

The movie rarely appears on TV or cable. If you like offbeat humor, this is a movie you may enjoy seeing over & over again. This is likely a movie that you'll have strong feelings about - either you think it's terrifically silly fun, or just plain stupid. If you like goofy humor, check it out.

It reminded me of a joke Steven Wright told once that went something like: Aliens broke into my house, stole all of my furniture and replaced it with exact duplicates.

That's what the film seemed like. I know this stuff, these characters, but there is something missing, some undefined essence that I didn't even know was there until it wasn't. Maybe I should give it another try, maybe it's a beautiful picture that I just need the proper perspective on, better focus.

And now for something completely different

I make it a habit to read reviews just to get alternate views on movies and books. Sometimes I already own them but I like to see things through anothers eyes. Then about three reviews in the pain starts. Lack of punctuation, misspellings, totally incoherent blathering, the hits just keep coming and their all head shots (THAt was intentional. I'm amazed at how many people don't know the difference between ""they're"" and ""their"" {Yes I'm also aware of the inexplicable capitalization on ""that"". Feel my pain people.}) Amazon gives you a page on which you can check your review before posting. In the name of whichever god who would have you please use it. Amazon if you're listening add spell check to that page. Do not make it voluntary.

There are times I feel as though I'm walking by an alley and seeing someone being punched and kicked by a shadowy group of people. As I chase them off I see that they're very ordinary looking. Average in fact. The guy on the ground is the English Language. I help him up, dust him off and say ""Didn't I just pull a bunch of rappers off of you yesterday? You've got to be more careful.""

She was happy, like God was rubbing her tummy, she said. It reminded me of the episode of Mama's Family when Ilona's cat dies and she freeze dried it. It also was outrageous to see the guy denying he was gay but the person playing his wife was a man in a dress! The only character I didn't like was Cancer Boy.

I really think though that the DVD could have benefited from having the alternate ending and aditional footage added back in.
As I understand it though, Paramount executives don't care about anything but patting each other on the back while their studio slips into oblivion.

Somewhat like Monty Python the 5 kids play many different characters in this movie.

I admit that non-fans may not get it or may not have the attention span to watch it, but true fans of the show will love it. I actually found that I liked it alot more the second time I saw it.
  The extra features for the DVD version are Zilch! Nothing at all which is very dissapointing, but I still reccommend buying DVD over VHS so you can have the movie quality preserved and the chapter selection(option to skip to your favorite scenes quick).

The Kids in the Hall are the funniest guys and this movie showcases their excellent writing and characters. The characters in this movie are outrageous, yet believable - like really, really exaggerated versions of people you know. Most are all new as well. In the true KITH way, there are a couple gratuitous Bellini-in-a-towel shots in the movie and lots of guys in drag.

The premise of the movie is great, about how greediness can cloud one's judgement and the big money always talks. Mark is hilarious as Don Roritor, the president of the drug company that pushes Kevin (as Dr. Chris Cooper) into releasing his under-tested anti-depression drug 'Gleemenex'. Everyone thinks the drug is the greatest, until they find out about the terrible side effect.

The guys all play many characters, but here are the highlights: Scott's funniest character is a repressed father/husband/closet gay, who comes out when he takes the drug. But he also plays a scientist and Queen Elizabeth. Dave's best is the kiss-butt right hand man of Roritor. Bruce and Mark bring their dumb as rocks cops to the movie, and Bruce is Grivo, the brooding (until he takes the drug) rock singer and Cancer Boy (you have to see the movie to get it).

There are no extras, hence the subtraction of one star. The movie itself is funny time after time though, so buying this DVD is still worth it!",1041379200,,1442,4.691699604743083

It is amazing the wealth of characters The Kids in the Hall are capable of drawing upon which further fuels a very well-written satire on society's eagerness to address and cure any and every thing via a pill - notwithstanding the side effects.  To be sure, some of the routines may be uncomfortable, especially because they end up being so funny (most notably Cancer Boy) but sometimes this is the only way - either confront a particular societal flaw with a harsh unfunny reality or, in this case, make them laugh so hard they are bound to see the absurdity in a given situation and thus be able to move toward rectifying it.

Bruce is short and moody. We all love Bruce. Mark can make funny faces. We all love Mark. Kevin does that little high-pitched squealing thing. We all love Kevin. Dave is obviously addicted to caffiene and other mood-altering chemicals. We all love Dave. .. Of course, we love Scott.
It all just works out.

Years later, however, I must reassess my position and say that this film twenty times as enjoyable as your average comedy. The storyline is much more intriguing than any high concept (i.e. SNL) comedy that comes from Paramount and the results are so much more satisfying. So what if Cabbage Head or The Flying Pig never shows up? The kids go to so much trouble to create characters that are new and not rely on their old characters that you have to admire them, even when it doesn't quite work. I'm not giving it a full 4 stars however, because the DVD never offers much. I wanted to see all of the scenes cut out of the movie (like David Foley's fast food teen ""THE FRIES WILL NEVER BE READY!"") but alas - we must wait until the special edition I fear.

The story is just an excuse to get the various Kids dressed up and making with the funny.

It's a shame this movie isn't more  well-known because it is a comedic masterpiece.  Kevin Mcdonald's physical  humor is at it's best, and he's so darn cute! Mark Mckinney dissapears into  all of his characters and is the most amazing character actor I have ever  seen. Scott Thompson is HILARIOUS as the gay husband in DUH-NIAL and is at  his funniest! Bruce McCulloch plays Alice, the niave scientist in love with  Dr. Chris Cooper (Kevin McDonald) who borders on pitiful but you can't help  but LOVE her! (And might I add he looks GREAT as a woman!) And last but not  least, Dave Foley plays a great YES man named Marv who'll do anything to  keep his boss happy (Including making him *AHEM* GREAT coffee!!) This movie  written by THE KIDS deserves every award it could possibly get...Filled  with lines you'll be repeating for years to come and occasional appearances  of much-loved characters from their TV show, BRAIN CANDY is a work of art.  I wasn't sure if anything could live up to their TV show but they have  truly out-done themselves with BRAIN CANDY.  This is a MUST SEE for anyone  and everyone!!",948844800,,1217,4.5

I thought Dave Foley, Kevin McDonald, Scott Thompson, Mark McKinney, and Bruce McCulloch did a great  job in this movie. I was laughing hysterically through the whole movie. I  love the way they play almost all the characters and how great they pull  off playing women. This 5 men are the best actors and this is the best  movie!",946598400,,446,4.261904761904762
795661,3,6304125941,"The Kids in the Hall television program is probably the best comedy sketch show on TV. Except for Scott Thompson's portrayal of the Queen, there is nary an impersonation to be found. The Kids' bizarre comic world is truly  theirs. Pure, sublime imagination is the only thing that can explain the  brilliant, calculated mannerisms of characters like the Chicken Lady and  Gavin or the ""been there"" slices of life in their sketches. They  could have lived the situations presented or known people that became  caricatures in their sketches, but that can't be entirely the case.  Now -  that said - I found myself to be a bit disappointed with ""Brain  Candy"". The Kids can tell a story better in 5 or 10 minutes than many  filmmakers can tell in 2 hours. If only they can master telling a story in  80 minutes or more. The story line is a good, strong one (a  depression-curing wonder drug with disastrous, comic side effects), but it  seems to be a means to link some half and fully inspired ideas that didn't  make it to the TV show. That the story almost, but doesn't get lost in the  shuffle is in some strange way a tribute to the Kids. When I heard of the  release of this movie, I thought that it would give the Kids in the Hall  the wider audience they richly deserve. I walked away from the theatre  thinking ""This ain't the picture that's gonna do it."" A word to  the neophyte: catch the wonderful reruns on Comedy Central before tackling  this movie.",942192000,3,1458,4.4961832061068705

There are lines in that movie that  have stayed with me more than ""May the Force Be With You"". On a  closing note I would just like to say that I would LOVE to see another Kids  In The Hall movie.

I wish there were more special features like deleted scenes (and the alternate ending) on the dvd, but I can live without the special features. While it's true there's nothing here that you can't find in the show, I still think this is a movie no fan of KITH (or absurdist comedy in general) can live without seeing.
