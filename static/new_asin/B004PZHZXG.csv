8437830,3,B004PZHZXG,"This movie kind of reminds me of Hollywood's ""The Grudge"". It isn't very scary but more of a haunting revenge story. Where Bollywood fails in horror films is they put the musical/dancing in it where that is beautiful in other Bollywood films but has no place in a horror film. Kind of ruins the scary aspect. The first half of this movie has that in it but the second half is where they loose it. I did like the very end though.",1454025600,,428,4.2317073170731705
