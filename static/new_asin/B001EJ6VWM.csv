8298360,4,B001EJ6VWM,"I just recently purchased and watched this DVD.  Jack Canfield is an excellent presenter and a great story teller so he's very interesting to listen to.  The ideas he presents in this DVD were very inspiring and made you feel like you could achieve your goals by applying these positive principles.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone interested in this topic.  It's only about a 40 minute video but as I watched it I took 3 pages of notes - so it's really good stuff.  One of my favorite lines was the last line he said which was ""The best is yet to come.""  You have to believe that and it will prove itself true.  The only reason I gave it four stars was because the camera cut away frequently for close ups to those in audience and I found this totally annoying and distracting.  Since Jack Canfield was up on stage, it was much easier to focus on what he was saying as if you were there in the audience watching him - until they'd cut away on a close up of someone's face and then I found myself just looking away so I could just continue concentrating on what he was saying vs. looking at this super close up shot of someone in the audience.  That aside, though, you will really enjoy this DVD and it will make you really think about how creating goals, visualizing, positive thinking, taking action, etc. can help make your dreams a reality.",1262476800,5,1349,4.342629482071713
8298361,5,B001EJ6VWM,"I am happy I got this DVD because it made sense of some key things that I believe were missing from other things I have read/watched on the law of attraction.....My favorite quote was ""You can't pay someone to do your pushups for you"" Jack Canfield makes points that keep you hooked and really make you think!",1253232000,6,309,4.43859649122807
