But in my opinion how seemingly rational normal people can kill a magnificent creature like a polar bear is a disgrace.  Thanks to precious cub Knut, I have become an avid bear fan.  These creatures are highly intelligent and emotionally complex.  Carrying a camera and bear spray when in bear country is sensible, but to carry a loaded gun is  despicable.  I suggest people stay out of bear territory...period....case closed, other than to rescue and rehab orphaned cubs or injured adults.  Subsistence hunting is not necessary since there are food outlets all over the globe.  Perhaps if the hunters formed orphaned and injured rehab groups, they would have more genuine pleasure and surely the bears would too.  Hunters often kill moms leaving the precious cubs to die slowly of starvation or to be killed and devoured by predatory males.  Please try to help bears maintain some equilibrium in their day to day activities by banning trophy and harvest hunts and promoting hormone harvests if absolutely necessary.  All bears need our respect and support.",1241222400,,1115,5.005434782608695
