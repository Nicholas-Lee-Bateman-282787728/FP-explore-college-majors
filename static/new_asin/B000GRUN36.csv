I was looking for a DVD withthose popular fairy tales stories, but in Spanish for my son. The Spanish used is from Spain, but ""totally understable"" by any Spanish speaking kid
 The cartoons are cute, the translation to Spanish is very good, and the stories selected can entertain children of any age.
I recommend this product to anyone interested into exposing their kids to Spanish language",1203638400,3,414,4.914285714285715
