8152240,1,B000JMKDSI,"The film opens in 1952 with a guy telling us about dimensions that exist on the same plane with ""things"" that can see us but we can't see them. We know this is true because he is wearing a white lab coat. Two couples are abducted by something that looks like the Serbian cartel and are part of forced experiments where they can see the other side, which look like black and white low budget effects,

The acting was bad throughout the film as it consisted mostly of four people in a room whining about something being in there with them...and they have a few flashbacks which are basically meaningless.

8152241,4,B000JMKDSI,"This is one of those movies in which we meet several characters who wake up but have no idea where they are.  They quickly learn that they are imprisoned in a room from which there is no escape.  Two of them are handcuffed to beds and it is obvious they are being experimented on.  They are also experiencing terrifying visions. To make matters worse, the visions are growing progressively more terrifying, and even more real, with each passing moment.  Nearly the entire movie takes place within this one room.  Some might find this a bit tedious, but I didn't because it gave some focus to the story and prevented it from jumping all over the place like so many other movies do.  I also liked that the answers behind the mystery were slowly revealed without giving it all away at once (though everything was not entirely explained, as many unanswered questions remained at the end of the movie).  This was a low budget film, so the special effects were far from spectacular.  There was also quite a bit of over-acting.  However, if you know that going into it and can accept it, then you will enjoy ""Evil Behind You.""  The final scenes of the movie felt unnecessary to me.  The movie had a sufficient ending ten minutes before the end.  The last scenes were apparently included to tie up some loose ends.",1414281600,,1306,4.581896551724138
8152242,5,B000JMKDSI,"This was a very interesting experience.  Never expected  to find a movie with a moral in with all that bad acting, ridiculous
script and over the top  over acting characters.  This is now one of my  favorites .My 18 year old granddaughter didn't
pick up on  it so you will all have to check it out  and let me know what you all  think.  anyway thanks to amazon.com
my interest has been piqued.  also your packaging is super.",1285804800,2,424,4.32051282051282
8152243,3,B000JMKDSI,"I saw it on YouTube, so as with films there, I wasn't expecting much. However, I rather enjoyed it. If there WAS a Christian pov, I totally missed it. I thought it was a decent movie all around. I mean, it won't win any Oscars or anything like that, but I've seen much worse.",1278633600,,275,4.111111111111111
8152244,2,B000JMKDSI,"I think the plot of this movie was the difference between being loving and being selfish in an unberable and confusing situation. The plot and Christian perspective was a bit limited and could have been further developed. There were a few special effects that occured with more frequency as the movie progressed.  These were better than I expected, but could have been better. The whole movie seemed a bit amateurish but I appreciated the Christian perspective it portrayed.",1195862400,,474,5.076923076923077
8152245,1,B000JMKDSI,"I like films with a Christian viewpoint, however this isn't it.  I think this was supposed to be a Christian film, but it was so hokey and poorly acted that if there was a message here, it missed me.  The actress who played Lisa did a decent job, but the other three young people trapped in the room...wow...Their acting school needs to lose accredidation.  The doctor doing the research was stiff and unbelievable.  The terrorists were...Well, if their intent was to kill off Christian viewers who are dying of laughter, they might succeed.  Those accents were hilarious. The film had possibilities but it was just done so poorly.  I say skip it. Go stick hot bamboo slivers under your fingernails instead.",1182470400,2,707,4.801652892561983
