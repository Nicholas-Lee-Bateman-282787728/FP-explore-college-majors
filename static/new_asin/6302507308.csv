474301,5,6302507308,"This movie has nothing to do with Thelma & Louise.  There are deep moral issues involved in T&L (Murder, Rape, Suicide).  This is not about that at all.  It is simply a VERY funny yet touching story about two women who befriend each other, and travel to Alaska together.  They don't know WHAT they're looking for but they do seem to find it at the end.
While Meg Tilly is probably at her best as a supporting actress, this is definitely Christine Lahti at her absolute best.  Ya gotta love her after seeing this movie.  The scenes at the sister's house and with the truck drivers were so funny I had to replay them and get another good laugh.
It is hard to believe that this movie didn't win an oscar and that people try and compare it to T&L.",1032393600,8,743,4.271428571428571
474302,4,6302507308,"Leaving Normal is one of my favorite films of all time. It is an irreverent jaunt through life, filled with wry (bordering on cynical) observations about our world, and zingers that sneak up on you and pounce (Darly: ""You gotta know that it's gonna take more than two fingers..."").
There is something in this movie for nearly everybody to relate to; I can't understand why it is compared with Thelma & Louise. T&L was a male-bashing movie filled with hatred and despair. I couldn't stomach it. LN may be less sensationalistic, but in my opinion it is far superior. Despair turns to humor and then to hope, and there are a few positive male role models.
The cinematography throughout is breathtakingly beautiful, and the opening scene, after the first couple of minutes, is exquisite.
My only complaint, a small one, is that sometimes the dialogue is stilted, awkward, stiff.
I had forgotten Edward Zwick directed this film. His movie Glory is wonderful. Leaving Normal is also wonderful, in a different way, and timeless. It left me deeply moved.",1017273600,8,1046,4.882022471910112
474303,5,6302507308,"Leaving Normal is definitely one of my most favorite movies. Those who compare this movie to Thelma and Louise are incredibly mistaken.  If I had to compare this film to any other it would be Fried Green Tomatoes.  Both films portray, quite simply, the strength of two women's friendship in the feriocity of life--a friendship that, I would argue, blurs the boundaries between the platonic and the passionate.  Currently, I am studying in Europe, miles from home, and this movie, although it's been years since I've seen it, has crept into my homesick mind, and makes me yearn for my best friend at home.  And Meg Tilly's childhood character's altered words to a famous nursery rhyme song tung gently at my dreams...""twinkle, twinkle little star how I wonder where you are? up above the world so high, when I find you I will fly""",974937600,21,829,4.736111111111111
474304,4,6302507308,"And I tell you why. The soundtrack is terrific, together with an excellent performance for both actress. People had compered this movie with Thelma and Louise, I think this movie goes more futher than T&L, is has a  different topic, talks abouts dreams, founds dream trough life path, rather  than heroes and guns. I absolutelly love this movies, is always has an  special place in my heart.",958262400,11,391,4.8059701492537314
474305,4,6302507308,"This is NOT Thelma and Louise, as some may suspect.  Instead, this movie is somehow able to capture both women's yearnings to find a place that they truly belong; both geographically and emotionally.  It has a magical  quality that will remain long after the film has ended.  Wonderfully  written and acted, this is truly a little gem that will instantly become a  favorite with many viewers.",927072000,4,392,4.863636363636363

It is well written and I love the journey the two woman are on . The outdoor scenery shots are  beautiful . The music is perfect for the movie. I had the movie on VHS , so I thought it was time to get the DVD. I was hesitant because of some of the reviews mentioned the quality of the DVD production was poor.

Christine Lahti and Meg Tilly are perfectly cast as a waitress/exotic dancer and a battered housewife, thrown together by circumstance.  A wonderful female ""road trip"" movie, where the leads meet wonderful strangers and unique characters on their way from Wyoming to Alaska. Unfortunately, this movie had the misfortune of being released the same year as ""Thelma & Louise"".  Because of this, this movie is destined to remain mostly unknown.

474470,1,6302507308,"This is a film I have enjoyed since I ran it as a new release on the cinema circuit and purchased it on VHS and then Laser Disk when it came out. I would have to say that I was very disappointed with the DVD when it arrived as it was heavily compressed and full of digital artifacts and considering the price tag of nearly US $20.00 and a vault series release, I expected a lot more from Universal Studios  who could do themselves a favor and check out the Warner Bros Archive releases and see how it should be done. I could have done better down loading a pirate copy from the web, ( which by the way I will not do ) so it looks like I will have to stay with my LD copy  until Universal get there act together and and release this film with a good transfer either on DVD or Blu Ray. Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent film and I rated it poorly purely for the crap job that was done with the transfer. In this day and age when the majority of people have a half decent TV where a bad image is really going to stand out, I find it very sad that a  major studio is releasing such poor quality material, and charging top dollar for it.",1375488000,9,1139,3.965065502183406

474473,5,6302507308,"I first saw this movie when it was playing in theaters.  A close friend of mine told me about it and said she thought I would really love it, so I went to see it knowing nothing at all about the movie.  When the movie was over, I found myself sitting in the theater as the credits rolled and people were leaving, and I was so emotionally impacted by it I was actually just trying to sit there and not sob and make a total spectacle of myself.  The characters played by Meg and Christine touched a nerve in me like no other movie has ever done before or since. I could relate so intimately with the feelings that the characters were having, and it just really affected me deeply and completely to my core.  I was shocked later to learn that it was written by a man.  It was and always will be probably my favorite movie.  Maybe not everyone will come away after watching it and have it touch them as deeply as it did me, but my guess is that many will.  I loved everything about the movie, and it remains very, VERY special to me.

I'm thrilled it is finally on DVD.  I have the tape version, but it's getting old (like me LOL) and so it's great to know it has not ""vanished"" and that other people can still watch it.  I say thank you from the bottom of my heart to the writer and the actors and all the other people who made this movie.  To me, it's priceless.",1364947200,2,1360,4.09433962264151

474517,4,6302507308,"I agree with another review's comparison with Fried Green Tomatoes.  This movie is lovely every which way.  One can't help identifying with the plight of Marianne, played so well by Meg Tilly.  The music choices in the movie are excellent too, adding greatly to the movie.

I had been watching a verson I recorded on VHS tape off TV, the last part recorded in long-play mode, and was so pleased when it finally came out on DVD and I was able to replace the old recording.

I have two criticisms though.  First, the volume level is the lowest of any of my 400+ DVD collection.  I have quite a decent amplifier driving a small pair of dynamic, detailed but inefficient speakers, and I have to run the amplifier full on, 5 o'clock position (where it is still a little on the quiet side for me), where I normally don't go past the 3 o'clock position.  The second criticism is with the picture quality.  I play DVDs on a Panasonic DVD player via HDMI cable to a Panasonic Full HD plasma TV, sharpness control set to the softest position.  But I find the picture has an 'over-sharpened' appearance giving it a 'gritty' or 'edgy' look, coupled with some panning artifacts in some scenes.  I have not seen this in other movies.  Could I suggest that this movie is reprocessed?  Apart from the visual issues mentioned the picture has good colour and plenty of detail.",1361145600,3,1358,4.539094650205762

I've looked almost everywhere (for years) and Amazon.com is the only place it is available. YOU ROCK AMAZON!! Unfortunately, the film came out when ""Thelma & Louise"" premiere and got lost in the hoopla. Just because it was another story about two women and their travels. The comparison ends there. It is familiar piece to both men and women who still or at one time could not figure out their path in life. I love a good story told simply and direct. The soundtrack is very good.

474520,5,6302507308,"This story is very good.  The humour and smart comments are always very close.  But in good female movie tradition there is a deep story too.  Two dames become friends, one works in a bar with a dubius past and one is a beaten wife who needs to get out.  They travel together and make all there important decisions on a wish and a prayer really.  But they do get to a place that the call girl has a past.  She does own land and a home.  But the home never got built and 2 indian boys are now living on the land.  And the land is in Alaska.

Her partner shows her strength here and gets a job and motivates the boys to be part of their 'family' and build the missing house.

The girl from the fast past reveals she had a child when young here and abandoned it and started her life on pillow talk lane and such places.  The 2 women try to trace the child but this is a painful past and not concluded.  But near the end does show huge growth with the mother of the child and she does take whatever steps she can to find the child through official channels.  The outcome is unknown but one can only hope.

474522,5,6302507308,"I'be been waiting for this release for a very long time. I first saw ""Leaving Normal"" when it hit theaters in 1992. Though it had it's bumpy moments, something in this film stuck with me and haunted me hours after. When it debuted on VHS I eagerly went out to purchase a copy. I travel a quite a bit with work and am proud to say that videotape has been everywhere in the world with me save for Africa and Australia.
  For years after DVD's began hitting the shelves, I would search Amazon for news of the upcoming release of ""Leaving Normal"". That news never came, so basically I gave up. My VHS copy was on the fritz now and I was left to nothing but a few uploaded versions of the theatrical trailer. I even went so far as to email Universal Home Video, pleading with them for the release of this film on DVD. That was 5 years ago.
  When I saw an exclusive DVD-R version available on Amazon tonight, I thought for sure the end of the world had come. I can't believe it! I almost cried, lol!!!! Instead, I just ordered it delivered next day. This movie is a true gem and features one of Christine Lahti's best performances, such a huge fan of hers.

This movie is very touching, but also very powerful! The two female leads are having to come to terms with deep psychological wounds, in order to find some happiness & feeling of contentment....& a place that feels like 'home'.
They have to leave society type normal, in order to find their own normal....something/somewhere that feels right to them. They must battle all sorts of setbacks in order to do this!

There are some fabulous characters in supporting roles & the movie is quite hilarious at times. The scenes with the plump girl are a stand out (can't remember her name!) - her chacter is mesmerising & had me in stitches!
It has stood the test of time well, & doesn't really feel dated to me. There is some deep wisdom in this movie, but also some really lovely whimsy & a rather magic feeling.

It's a female buddy road movie of sorts, but my boyfriend loves this movie too, so it's not just for chicks! Some truly gorgeous starry night shots & the scene beside a swiftly running stream in Alaska (well, that's where they are in the movie - I'm not sure where this scene is actually shot!) is breath taking, for the amazing colour & obvious purity of the water!

If you're bothering to read these reviews, then bother to get this movie - I'm pretty sure you won't regret it!! I also love Cold Comfort farm & Casablanca (amongst others), if that's any help. :):):)",1336176000,2,1535,4.494623655913978

474547,5,6302507308,"The Seventies were a great time for American film.  Character and story took precedence over visual effects.  One film that comes to mind is ""Scarecrow"" starring Gene Hackman and Al Pacino.  It concerns a couple wayward souls going on the road to seek their fortune only to be confronted by personal demons.  ""Leaving Normal"" reminds me of that film except the protagonists are women instead of men.  Marianne (Meg Tilly) has a case of wanderlust and is escaping from an abusive marriage.  Darly (Christine Lahti) is a cocktail waitress who is harboring feelings about a tragic decision she made in her youth.  Both want to leave the stifling environment of Normal, Wyoming for the Northern Lights of Alaska to find happiness.  That entails, however, they confront their sins of the past.  This is a terrific somewhat daring film.  Director Edward Zwick challenges the audience to emphasize with flawed, and in the case of Darly somewhat unsympathetic, individuals.  Tilly and Lahti are terrific and Patrika Darbo in a smallish role as a waitress they meet during the course of their journey makes an impact.

Their backgrounds are different but similar in the fact that both faced adversity in their lives.  This movie is definitely NOT Thelma and Louise.  Darly and Mary Ann don't get raped and murder anyone.  Instead, they show us that with hope, faith, patience, and friends, you can come out ahead.

Meg Tilly and Christine Lahti deliver an excellent performance of a smart, funny and sensitive story. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.

Over the years, I have watched this movie whenever possible, enjoying the dialogue, the laughs, the camaraderie between the two primary characters--Mary Anne and Darly, portrayed so effectively by Meg Tilly and Christine Lahti.

Lahti's character has that sarcastic, wise-girl persona down pat, with all the wittiness and self-deprecation one can expect from a person who has met more hard knocks than some.  But she keeps on getting up when life knocks her down.  This quality sees her through.

Tilly's character, on the other hand, seems naive and gullible, with her low expectations and her persistent wrong choices.  All because she refuses to give up on her dreams.  She CHOOSES to be happy.

Two strangers who happen to connect at a low point in each of their lives, they join forces.  They both are trying to escape small-town life in Wyoming, so when Darly offers Mary Anne a ride to Oregon, where her sister lives--which, as Darly points out, is only a ""little"" out of the way in her trek to Alaska--Mary Anne is only too happy to accept.

Combining their individual qualities with their perseverance, Mary Anne and Darly persist in their journey until they finally reach their destination...Alaska. (Mary Anne decides against staying with her sister after all).

So what happens along the way to cement the bond between the characters?  What disasters do they find when they arrive?  And do these obstacles prevent them from finding their dreams?

Discovering the answers to these questions are half the fun in this movie.  You'll need to watch it to find out.",1254009600,3,1809,5.2508710801393725

Of all the ""buddy"" movies I've seen - especially dealing with women - this one always cut straight to the bone with me. When Meg Tilly, in a moment of trauma, cries out ""Why am I here again?"" referring to her continual missteps in life, it struck such a resonant chord with me. Do we ever feel that we've gotten to the place we're supposed to get to? Apparently, in an absolutely luminous moment, she does, as, looking up at the Northern Lights sometime after that, she responds to a friend asking her why she's happy now, she answers, ""Because I didn't expect anything."" (Or words to that effect.) Her character comes to an epiphany before Christine Lahti's does - but both come to a resolution by the end of the movie. It's like observing two of your most dysfunctional friends from afar - you long to help them, hope they arrive at the right answer, and sit back happy when they do. (I also like Meg's moment in the phone booth when, after a raucous conversation with her former husband, she screams, ""I MARRIED him, what is my problem?"")

This is a simple story of two completely opposite women meeting by chance as one (Lahti) is leaving for Alaska and the other (Tilly) just ran out on her husband of a day after he hit her. Darly (Lahti) is wonderfully loud, obnoxious and seemingly crude but her heart softens a bit seeing Tilly (Mariann) crying on a bench in town. Mariann's character (Tilly) is a soft, anxious, people pleasing semi doormat up to this point and a bit of a social flake. They adventure to Alaska meeting wonderful characters along the way and through the fighting and zaniness, they share their ugly pasts and manage to come to terms with their decisions and find peace and acceptance within themselves and each other. They all improve themselves by knowing each other. I love the lead character contrasts, and Patrika Darbo only added to my love for this film.
