5012142,2,B006P5KEYQ,"for the fans out there that still have the old DVD release of THE HILLS HAVE EYES PART 2
 by Image entertainment, keep it

this new Blu-ray release by Kino video is not worth buying at all
first of all the picture quality is very average and not really presented in High Definition at all
and the screen ratio is worse than the dvd release
this blu-ray's screen ratio is only 1:66 so it's pretty bad
plus the audio quality is worse it's only a 2.0 stereo mix, not a 5.1 surround sound mix
and to top it all of, no extras at all, nothing
this blu-ray version of Hills have eyes 2 is pointless to buy
this sequel to the original wes craven classic from 1977 does deserve a better blu-ray release
that's for sure
and deserves a wes craven interview about the film or even an audio commentary by wes craven
but sadly this blu-ray has nothing

Image ent' released the first Hills have eyes on blu-ray with tons of extras
it does not make sense why Image ent' didn't do the same thing with the sequel

i do enjoy this sequel it's Good sequel to the original classic
but this blu-ray version is pathetic and not worth buying at all
so i gave it only 2stars",1393891200,,1149,4.232876712328767
5012143,1,B006P5KEYQ,Bad movie. Nothing to do with the original. Boring and irritating performances. One of the worst of Wes Craven. The issue does not have Spanish subtitles.,1366329600,,154,4.961538461538462
5012144,5,B006P5KEYQ,I love wes craven i saw this movie as a kid and it scared the heck out of me so naturally i bought it,1354838400,,101,3.25
5012145,1,B006P5KEYQ,"What a horrible sequel to a horror classic!  Some of the cast from the original ""The Hills Have Eyes"" return to carry on the story.  There's lots of bad acting and just plain stupidity.  There was obviously no thought put into this film.  The characters act brain dead and do the dumbest stuff to get themselves killed.  There are numerous flashback sequences to the original film but when the dog has a flashback, I just rolled my eyes.  This movie will insult your intelligence.  Its hard to believe a horror movie can be this stupid.  Also, the transfer looks horrible for a blu-ray film.  Much of the action is very dark, murky, and grainy.  Don't waste your money on this one!",1343606400,3,681,4.553719008264463
5012146,5,B006P5KEYQ,"To start out, I love this movie. Call me crazy but it is my favorite out of The Hills Have Eyes series. Just a pure slasher movie. I don't agree with the two previous reviewers who say the picture is worse than the dvd. Sure, it has some speckles that litter the picture every once in a while unlike most of the dvd that came out by Image in 2002 and the picture is of about the same quality of The Hills Have Eyes but to be honest is there really anything better they can do to the print? Unless Wes Craven has a pristine print hiding somewhere like the directors of The Dorm That Dripped Blood and the director of The House On Sorority Row have this is the best we are going to get. And on Blu-Ray it's a lot better than the original The Hills Have Eyes will ever be. It passes the test on dvd and the remastered dvd and the Blu-Ray. Night scenes seem to be more clear on Blu-Ray. The sound is awesome. True Blu-ray sound. 2 channel but I the volume on my tv was low and it still sounded powerful. Had to turn my volume way up for the dvd. I would say that getting the Blu-Ray is a better bet than the pan and scan Image dvd that came out in 2002. At least you get widescreen with the Blu-Ray and remastered dvd.",1341014400,6,1214,4.020661157024794
5012147,1,B006P5KEYQ,"OK, I have the laserdisc, DVD, and now the BluRay of this movie.  When I saw the BluRay was coming out I thought it would be a sharp clear high quality transfer; but, it looks and sounds just like the DVD - grainy, flat, and too dark in several scenes.
I think we've passed the point where BluRay is an upgrade and now it's just a new format to copy DVDs to in order to get more money out of people.",1332720000,21,399,3.925925925925926
5012148,2,B006P5KEYQ,"Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes 2 has always been a guilty pleasure for me. My mother was never fond of my watching horror movies while growing up and the VHS cover was too catchy to ignore. Because of this, I was bound and determined to enjoy it no matter what. Is it the most original for a sequel? No. But the story did keep me watching to find out who'd live and who wouldn't. And yes, the flashbacks from the dog's perspective are quite amusing. One strength the film has going for it is Harry Manfredini's score, which I hope one day sees an official release.

The difficult part in reviewing much more about the movie itself is actually getting to SEE the movie on this Blu-Ray disc. This is remastered? The audio quality is okay, but the picture quality is simply awful. The grain is ridiculous, the picture is dark to the point where I'm not convinced it's better than it looked on VHS and it appears the entire film was simply thrown out there to make a quick buck. Granted, it probably wasn't in terrific shape to begin with, but this is hardly a worthy effort on the part of Horizon movies.",1332547200,3,1103,4.380487804878049

8502622,1,B006P5KEYQ,"I don't really make judgement calls on if a movie is good or not...  If you are buying this odds are you have seen it and know what you are getting into...
My problem is that this is basically not a blu Ray...  Yeah it is on blu disk, but it is only marginally better looking than my dvd copy...  Was a let down like so many fake BR versions out there...  Don't upgrade.",1449878400,,370,3.9594594594594597

8502624,2,B006P5KEYQ,"To be honest, this Blu-ray does have a great HD transfer. Unfortunately, the movie itself is pretty bad. It does have some laugh out loud bad moments, so that's something, but that's about all.",1445990400,,193,4.705882352941177
8502625,5,B006P5KEYQ,"I don't see how the acting in the movie was bad. I liked it more than the first part and definitely more than any of the new remakes. I liked actors, liked plot. I just disliked the long flashbacks. They took a dew minutes out of the movie, thus making me fast forward some of the scenes. It's not how I like watching movies.",1399680000,,325,4.09375
