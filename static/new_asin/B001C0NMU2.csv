3503467,5,B001C0NMU2,"Jack Brooks Monster Slayer is one of those films that I enjoy more with every viewing.  When I first watched it, I was waiting for the monsters, action, and of course Robert Englund's performance.  All were worth the wait, but I was introduced to a whole list of great new characters.  Harold probably being the best surprise.  It shows off what even small budget films can do without relying heavily on c.g.i., with a lot of tricks reminiscent of Sam Raimi in Evil Dead 2.  It's a fun film that I see fitting in with 80s favorites like The Monster Squad, Fright Night, Night of the Creeps, Evil Dead 2, and so on.  I have yet to see Inside and Mother of Tears, but so far this is my favorite horror film released on DVD this year.",1223683200,2,731,4.299270072992701

3503469,5,B001C0NMU2,"Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer.

Seriously, this movie was a blast. It totally channels the Evil Dead movies and has a ton of charm. Totally pays respect to the Evil Dead movies without ripping them off. A very likeable lead character who has anger issues because of a past traumatic incident with a ""monster"". A very good story.

Pretty much all old-school effects, no crappy looking cgi to be found here. Tons of blood, gore, monsters and humor. Robert Englund(Freddy himself) turns in a great performance as ""The Professor"". Definately seek it out. I rented the unrated version but loved the movie so much I'll be buying it tomorrow. Would make a great pick for viewing on Halloween.

Seek this movie out.

9/10 Sequel please!!

And duct tape for the win!!!!",1223596800,2,758,4.8
3503470,4,B001C0NMU2,"Perhaps if I had stumbled over this film as a rental first instead of buying it outright sight unseen, brand new at Best Buy I might feel more kindly disposed towards it. ""WTF?"" you are no doubt saying at this point. ""You've given it 4 stars and you're saying that you don't like the film?"" Well yeah, kinda sorta. I made the mistake of buying it on impulse based on the rave reviews on the cover, the blurb on the back, and some cover art that made it look like the greatest thing since RE-ANIMATOR, EVIL DEAD 2, and ARMY OF DARKNESS. And I can't afford to throw my money away like that, but I took the chance anyway. Needless to say the film didn't deliver what I had been expecting/hoping for, which was something along the lines of a story built around a character like the one John Ratzenberger (Cliff Clavin from CHEERS) played in HOUSE 2. You know, the electrician who is also an ""adventurer"" on the side? He takes one look inside the walls of the house and drawls matter of factly, ""Yeah, it looks like you have some sort of alternate universe in there."" Of course I know better than to go into any film with preconceived notions like that, but in this case my mind just ran away with me and I couldn't help it.

The film stars Robert Englund in one of his best performances in ages as a night school science teacher, Professor Crowley, who has in his class our title character Jack Brooks. Now Jack (played by Trevor Mathews who also co-wrote the story on which the screenplay is based) is just loaded with History. It seems at a very tender age he witnessed his whole family's slaughter at the claws and fangs of some sort of man/monster while they were out camping in the woods. The only thing that saved little Jack's life was the fact that he ran. Running wound up taking control of the rest of his life. He ran from all of the important things in life only to have his pent up rage at his own perceived cowardice erupt at unexpected moments. Anyhoo, one night after class the kindly professor asks Jack (a plumber by trade) if he could possibly stop by his house and help him with a problem he's having with his pipes. (Get your minds out of the gutter, that's not the kind of pipes I meant.) Jack's got nothing better to do, so that very night he checks it out. It seems simple enough at first, but isn't that the way it is with every plumbing problem? Before you know it all matter of disgusting matter is hitting the fan and Jack has to order a new gasket and come back in a couple of days. But by then it will be too late! For no sooner has he left than than a noxious ooze seeps from the ground and its fumes start turn the sweet ol' professor into a meat craving monster!

This flick has an awful lot going for it. For one thing there is (as far as I can tell) absolutely no CGI anywhere! Everything is done the good old fashioned way--with prosthetics, puppets, and men in monster suits. Professor Crowley literally erupts into a tentacled creature from hell that sucks the life out its victims and turns them into flesh eating beasts themselves. MONSTER SLAYER is, as it claims to be, a tribute to some of the best flicks from the 1980s, but yet it just doesn't do it for me. The humor it claims to have simply isn't there for one thing, and for me that is a very, very big point indeed. The 1980s was the Golden Age of horror comedy and a large part of the appeal of those flix WAS the humor, whether it was the droll wit of RE-ANIMATOR or the ""splat-shtick"" approach of Sam Raimi in EVIL DEAD 2. And what's worse JACK BROOKS is a very bland hero! I think the role practically screams for someone who can portray an ordinary everyday man and then rip away all that blandness and channel the comic book spirit of Bruce Campbell when the situation calls for it!

I don't know, I just don't know. Perhaps when I watch this film again in a few months all the wonderful parts, the old school effects and so forth, will triumph over my disappointment. That's why I've given it 4 stars instead of 3. Perhaps they intend to make a series out of this character. That has some great possibilities. Oh no! Don't start thinking about what COULD be again, it will only lead to disappointment.",1223510400,26,4202,4.32319391634981
3503471,4,B001C0NMU2,"Years ago most monsters in film were played by a guy in a suit. No not your typical three piece double breasted suit but a rubber suit twisted and formed into some sort of creature. Later on make up techniques changed and appliances were used. Today, most monsters are a combination of this and CGI (computer generated images) to make a more realistic looking creature but at the same time not feeling quite real. JAK BROOKS: MONSTER SLAYER takes a step back and at the same time offers something new.

Jack is a down on his luck loser. He never seems able to keep a job or girlfriend and has rage problems that are spiraling out of control. His therapist is at wits end and doesn't know what to do with him. And his newest girlfriend is a shrew who belittles him in front of another night class student who is obviously hitting on her.

Jack's problems all stem back to when he was a child and his parents. No, they didn't beat him or mistreat him. They were killed. In front of Jack. Along with his little sister. It seems while on a camping trip, a troll attacked them all and Jack's dad told him to run. Jack obeyed his father but at the cost that he was forever running, trying to avoid anything bad.

At his night class, Jack's teacher Prof. Crowley (Robert Englund of Freddy Krueger fame) asks him to come by his house to check out his plumbing. No, this isn't a gay reference, Crowley has bought an old house thought to be evil and the plumbing is going bad. Being a plumber, Jack agrees and takes a look, discovering the problem and trying to fix it. An old fitting blows and Jack has to order the piece in before completing the job.

It turns out the house is evil though. Buried in the back yard and released when the pressure from the pipe blew the fitting, this evil oozes out into a mist that infects the professor, causing him to dig up a box in the yard and unleash the monster within. This monster possesses the good professor and he begins to eat meat with a ravenous appetite.

Jack finds out from the old fella at the hardware store that the evil the professor told him of is true. It turns out that this gent had been a boy in the house when his uncle purchased a mysterious box from the Far East. Enclosed in a glass case, it was safe until the day he dropped it. The evil entered his uncle and the young boy was forced to kill him to survive. He buried him in a box in the yard, the same box that the professor dug up.

The next day at class, the students can tell Prof. Crowley just isn't himself. And the night after that, the beast within unleashes itself from the confines of the professor's body, turning him into a blob like creature that resembles Chet from the film WEIRD SCIENCE.

This creature attacks the students and one by one begins to eat them. Jack and his girlfriend escape down the hall and finally out of the building. But Jack realizes that he's run far too long, deciding that he's not going to run any longer from the monsters in this world. Armed with a plumber's belt filled with tools, Jack enters into the fray with the intent of taking on each and every creature that heads his way. And that's a number of them since once bitten by the professor; each person becomes one of his monster slaves.

This movie is not typical scare your pants off horror. It is not a spoof of horror films like the SCARY MOVIE films. It is instead a homage to all of those men in suit horror flicks we remember from our childhood, where a looming creature rose from the dust and attacked everything in its path. At the same time, make up drenched goo covered slimy monsters all work for this rubberized monster and face off against Jack as well.

The movie is a blast. It tosses aside the pre-conceived notions of the hero and turns them on their head, so instead of the all American boy saving the day we get someone dealing with anger management issues who is allowed to unleash his rage on creatures bent on total destruction.  It's fun instead of scary and yet youngsters might see the film as horror more than adults walking down memory lane.

As I watched this I laughed out loud, rooted for the good guy and by the films end hoped that this would not be the last we saw of Jack Brooks. The film is original which is difficult to do these days and at the same time pays respects to those classics of old. When looking for something different for your Halloween party this year, give JACK BROOKS MONSTER HUNTER a try.",1223337600,2,4450,4.330132052821129
3503472,4,B001C0NMU2,"Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer is by and far one of the most enjoyable original titles to come from Anchor Bay, and it's easy to see why.  Co-producer and co-writer Trevor Matthews stars as the title character, a plumber with some huge anger issues who witnessed the brutal murder of his family by monsters when he was a child.  Along with his annoying girlfriend (Birds of Prey's Rachel Skarsten), Jack is taking night classes, but sadly his professor (genre stalwart Robert Englund) has accidentally unleashed a demonic force that is horribly transforming him, and soon enough it's up to Jack to put his rage to some monster-slaying use.  With its tongue planted firmly in cheek, Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer is an awesomely enjoyable and bloody treat.  The only real flaw with the film is that it's too short, but there is ripe potential here for Jack's monster slaying to continue.  Hopefully, it will.",1223337600,4,902,4.907894736842105

3503474,5,B001C0NMU2,"I honestly did not know what to expect when walking into a screening of Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer.  Optimistically I thought, ""This artwork reminds me of Raiders of the Lost Ark (one of my favorites) meets Big Trouble in Little China (another one of my favorites), meets Army of Darkness (another one of my favorites), meets Night of the Creeps (one of my absolute favorites.  This, on a secondary note, is not on DVD--nothing short of tragic!  How can this not have been released? Who the hell makes decisions for these companies?  Quite frankly it perturbs me...and I digress).  Pessimistically I thought, I will soon be reduced to another notch on some slick studio big wig's bed post.  They slap sweet looking art on an otherwise putrid film that tricks folks (read: idiots) like me into buying a ticket or DVD or a whatever.  I have to imagine that is the feeling they get too.  I am sure right now, there is some undercover suit with a brand new pair of Converse All Stars cowering in some dark corner of a Blockbuster franchise, licking his lips at the prospect of some young kid (read: idiot) coming across his product and dropping the 4 dollars he earned painting mommy's toe nails on some steaming pile of horror movie (in the prettiest of packages mind you).  Another one fallen victim to marketing....Well I am happy to report that although JBMS is not quite the former, it certainly isn't the latter (films in the latter category include but are not limited to Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde remakes starring Tony Todd, anything direct to DVD that Lions Gate has ever released anything in Dimension's Man Eater collection and 27 Dresses).  Jack Brooks Monster Slayer is actually a really good, funny (and surprisingly scary film).  The special effects are non-existent (unless by special you mean they have four teachers and take Ritalin).  There are some very cool, non-cgi monsters though getting hacked to pieces by the man himself Jack Brooks.  Oh yes, and Mr. Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) is HILARIOUS!  I can't tell if he is a really good actor, or a really, really, really bad actor but either way he is f'ing funny (well worth the price of admission).

I guess at this point I should explain the film:  Jack Brooks watches a monster voraciously slaughter his parents when he is just a child.  Jack grows up with a little bit of a temper and a sh! tty job (this isn't an exaggeration, he is a plumber).  Never really having an outlet for his rage, these ravenous beasts become the perfect destination for the tale end of his socket range.  So Jack proceeds to kill monsters.  Violently.  Notice the plural... Jack kills monsters for 30 consecutive minutes.  And it is very, very, very cool.  There will be no Oscar buzz on this one but there will most certainly be blood.

Haven't seen the bonus features but Anchor Bay usually does a pretty good job.  I recommend this to anyone who loves old school horror and/or comedy.",1222041600,4,2937,4.689453125

3503476,3,B001C0NMU2,"This is a movie that screams ""REMAKE"". Robert Englund did himself no favor by starring in this mess. It has an excellent storyline but def needs upgraded special effects. Its the lame effects that take away from this film.",1462924800,,222,4.717948717948718
3503477,4,B001C0NMU2,"Jack Brooks (Trevor Matthews) witnessed the murder of his family by a morlock looking monster as a child and ran away. Since then he has had anger management issues which provides us with much of the comedy aspect of the film. Part of his counseling is to take a chemistry night class with  Professor Gordon Crowley (Robert Englund) along with his girlfriend Eve (Rachel Skarsten) who he mostly ignores.

Crowley lives in the house on top of Watson Road which has a history. The plot, isn't too hard to figure out, but basically there is just one real monster battle, although there are a number of them he has to fight, I was expecting something different. From the title I expect some kind of Dylan Dog type of film. It was not. The film leaves off for a sequel that never came.

This isn't a bad horror movie my any means.  There were some things I think that could have been approved upon but all in all, this is fun horror movie.  The acting was fine.  The special effects were impressive. Most notably, they were mostly all practical effects.  Nothing ruins horror movies like CGI.  Doesn't matter how good the acting is or how good the story is, if CGI is the primary source of the films special effects, it's going ruin the movie.  Yes there are notable exception to every rule.  But, when it comes to horror movies, CGI is almost always frowned upon by me.  The practical effects in this film were refreshingly, enjoyable and a site for sore eyes.

The only thing that I didn't like was the pace of the of the film.  It runs a bit slow in my opinion. For a movie called ""Monster Slayer"", there wasn't a whole lot of monster slaying going on.  Had they made Jack's professor, Gordon Crowley played by Robert Englund, more of mentor figure who sees all the right traits in Jack. Someone who that already knows about monsters and is looking for the next slayer, I think the story would have moved at a quicker pace.  I think it would made for a better story having the two characters have more of a Buffy / Giles relationship Instead of having the professor there as just another victim of an ancient monster. The story unfolds all around Jack instead of happening to Jack.  In a nutshell, Jack does zero monster hunting until the final act and I think that's a shame.

That being said, the events that unfold are interesting.  There is a story to follow and if there is ever a sequel to this movie I think will be a huge hit.  I honestly don't know why it hasn't been made yet.  This is movie should still be getting much more attention than it has.  One of the reasons I put off seeing it for so long was I've never heard anyone ever talk about this movie. Not a single friend even knows it exists, I have never seen a review of it and when it came out, I had never even heard of it. This movie deserves more than that.  This movie needs a sequel!  Most of all, it deserves to be watched and appreciated for what it is.  A fun monster movie with an 80's monster movie throwback vibe that it nails wonderfully.

Jack Brooks Monster Slayer is definitely one to own in my humble opinion.",1451347200,,2530,4.6613995485327315

The monsters in this movie are not computer generated but rather made the old fashion way with rubber and latex with people working them like large puppets.  If you have seen the movie ""HOUSE"" from 1986, the monsters are done much the same way.  The movie is about Jack who has a problem with his temper because of something that happened when he was a child.  Jack's temper gets in his way until he figures out a great use for it and that is killing monsters.  Robert Englund who played Freddy Krueger is also in this movie.

The plot and ending were extremely predictable even for someone who isn't paying much attention.  Maybe a little too obvious and that may be what hurt it most.  You can get up and walk away and still know what is going to happen right down to the Sodium.  Way too much time was spent on explaining who Jack is and the other characters are very shallow, you can even guess who will die and who lives.  I was getting really bored with Jack; how he and his supposed girlfriend even got together is beyond me, and why a new girl in class even likes him is even more mind-boggling.  He is not a sympathetic or even likeable character.  The main demon is barely threatening and by the time you get to it, the movie only has a few minutes left.  Englund did a fine job, and so did everyone given what they were as characters but the overall story was weak.  A main villain who cannot even move is hardly a threat, but at least it had psychic homing tentacles that can follow and grab you from other rooms... i wasn't scared and i kinda wanted to laugh every time i saw the main demon blob even though this isn't really a comedy.  It's cheap, so you can't argue much.  It can be campy fun if you approach it as such - DO NOT TAKE THIS AS A SERIOUS HORROR FILM or a comedy.

3503493,2,B001C0NMU2,"It would be a lot easier to trash ""Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer"" than it would to lay any kind of praise on it. The film's biggest weakness is that the plot itself is practically nonexistent and takes way too long to come to the dramatic revelation that the entire story is built upon. You know it's coming the entire way through yet it happens with like five minutes left in the movie making little impact. Another big strike against it is that there is hardly any gore to speak of and what's there isn't particularly impressive. Considering that there's a praise blurb from Fangoria on the case, you'd expect a decent amount of nastiness but there's barely any. Then again, Fangoria lost any and all credibility they had years ago, so take that at what it's worth.

""Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer"" could've been much more than it winds up being, which is what's so disappointing. Trevor Matthews in the lead role is charismatic at times and gives his best effort but is hamstringed by the pitfalls of his character being underwritten. Robert Englund brings his A-game as usual but is ultimately wasted in his one note role. The best thing I can say is that there's a definite love for the genre here as many of the themes and scenes echo other entries in the genre, especially ""Jason Goes to Hell"", ""Slither"", ""Demons"" and of course, the ""Evil Dead"". I'm going to give the filmmakers an A for effort because they really do try to make something worthwhile here but the end result is undercooked and the neglect resulting in this threadbare plot pretty much dooms this film to the bargain bin. Just so you know, I wasn't expecting anything fantastic but I was expecting more than this.

It wasn't so horrendous that I couldn't sit through it but I won't be watching it ever again, that's for sure.",1330473600,,1795,4.623824451410658

Trevor Matthews as ""Jack Brooks"" does a wonderful job playing the hopeless anger management patient.  His character's obsessions were expertly played against an infuriating and incompetent world of morons.  Brooks' oblivious girlfriend is such a menace that we have to wonder why he hasn't lashed out at her, too.  Until you realize that she gives him the only kind of love that he can accept...and then, of course, she hooks up with another guy, who then gets beaten to a pulp.  And then the campy Robert Englund.  It truly is a blessing to see an actor who knows his script and his character and who knows how to keep the ""camp"" without overselling it.

3503501,3,B001C0NMU2,"Its taken awhile to get around to this one, led by positive reaction on pretty much every horror site during Jack Brooks' festival circuit run. For the most part the positive reactions were valid. The film has a lot that many zero budget horror offerings don't. Most impressive, and most important of all in my opinion, is that the film looks good. It's well shot, not too much hand-held, dynamic framing and good light/dark contrast in the many night time scenes. The acting, dodgy at best even in studio horror fare, is pretty good here, the stand out being of course Trevor Matthews as the titular Jack Brooks. That's saying a lot considering Matthews in a stuntman by trade and though he is put through his paces on the physical front, there are a number of scenes where Matthews elicits genuine empathy for Jack. While its always nice to see horror veterans like Robert Englund working, he hams it up alittle too much, and its especially noticeable in scenes with the 'playing-it-straight' Matthews. Actually, there's a very curious scene that involves the two actors that is played so dead pan, I'm still not sure If I was reading it right. It involves a lot of talk of Jack coming around to 'unblock' the professor's (Englund) pipes. I read homoerotic, but you be the judge. The all important FX in Jack Brooks is also handled very well, when not in tight close-up. It is here the film's inspirations are laid bare, Evil Dead II and Peter Jackson's Brain Dead, to an almost blinding degree, but director Knautz can be forgiven for this indulgence as he has his fun with such glowing reverence. However, all the above doesn't not a cult classic make. Jack Brooks is a one note, one idea story stretched out to nearly 90 minutes. It should be half that. We really only get to the good stuff in the last half an hour. It really feels like many scenes are just padding, especially those with Jack's anger management councilor and all the classroom scenes with Englund. This excess of scenes over states minor story and character developments making everything more predictable and in turn the viewer more impatient to get to there foregone conclusion.
While it really should have been a short film (though I know they would have never got the funding for it) the filmmakers behind Jack Brooks should still be proud, as the elements that do work, work well.",1275177600,,2359,4.700483091787439
3503502,3,B001C0NMU2,"Reminiscent of 1980's comedy/horror, director John Knautz's feature debut, Jack Brooks Monster Slayer (2007), features some messy, gooey action, and some retro looking, monsters.  The film takes a while to get going, but finishes strongly, with a wild, violent, splattery fury.

As a young boy, Jack Brooks (Trevor Mathews) witnessed his family being slaughtered by some kind of monster, leaving him traumatized, and with anger management problems.  Attending night classes, after working his day job as a plumber, Gordon Crowley (Robert Englund) his professor, asks Jack to drop by his home, to check out his pipes.  Brooks botches up the job, frying the electrical wiring, and helping to unearth something buried in the professor's back yard.  The professor digs out a wooden box, and finds a skull, and what looks like a heart inside.  The heart comes alive, and forces itself down Crowley's throat, beginning his transformation into a hideous monster.

At the local hardware store, Jack learns from the elderly store clerk (David Fox), that as a boy, he once lived in the professor's house, and lost his hand in a horrible incident involving a monster.  While in class, the professor's transformation is completed.  The result is a hideous bloated monster, with many vicious tentacles, that stretch for unbelievably long distances.  Kind of like John Carpenter's The Thing, on steroids.  After capturing a number of students, the monster begins to transform them into zombie like mutants.  Jack escapes, and could run away, but decides to face his demon.

While Jack Brooks is heroic for taking on the monsters, he isn't a particularly nice or likeable guy.  His temper causes him to lash out at his counselor (Daniel Kash), and a classmate (James A. Woods).  He has almost no meaningful communication, with his girlfriend Eve (Rachel Skarsten).  Brooks is totally unprepared, for the huge battle that the entire movie builds up to, and uses his anger and brute force to overcome the monsters.  At last, the jerk has a useful outlet for his rage.  The fights and gore make for amusing viewing, and the violence of the kills is mostly satisfying, but the lack of reality, translates to a lack of genuine terror.  The movie is more a weird, entertaining ride.  The mutants look so unreal, and behave so ridiculously, that it is hard to feel fear, looking at a big comical dummy, hollow tubes, and guys wearing goofy latex masks and padding.  At the final fight ends, Jack has blood all around his mouth.  But seconds later, when he's planting a kiss, the blood has disappeared.

Trevor Mathews does a pretty good job, as the annoying Jack.  Robert Englund is quite funny, in an abbreviated role.  And David Fox, James A. Woods, and Rachel Skarsten, have some pretty funny moments.

The DVD has a number of extras, including a mostly for laughs commentary track, by director John Knautz and members of the production staff, as well as some interesting and pretty extensive, behind the scenes type featurettes.  There are some interesting deleted scenes that would have fleshed out the story, one features a conversation between Jack and Eve, and another with a group of students having a meal with Professor Crowley.  The musical score by Ryan Shore, is a very positive contributor to the atmosphere of the film, and is also the subject of a featurette.  It appears that the filmmakers mostly succeeded, in making the kind of film that they were looking to do.  After a shaky start, Jack Brooks evidently became proficient enough to make a career out of battling monsters, so perhaps there will be a sequel.",1272758400,,3608,4.955074875207987

Get thee back to the 1980s, ye fiendish monster movie! Except that JACK BROOKS MONSTER SLAYER had its theatrical release in late 2007, not that long ago. This movie is Canadian-powered and driven by practical special effects, with a fond eye slanted towards those awesome, semi-hokey, splattery horror flicks of the Reagan era. The tone is very much dark comedy. The not so secret weapon is Robert Englund.

Jack Brooks is an angry, angry guy. And maybe part of it is because he's a lowly plumber and he's also got this really mean girlfriend, but mostly it stems from that camping trip years ago when he was a kid and his family got murdered by a demonic creature in the woods. Hello, psychological trauma, our good friend.

Jack takes this science night class (his girlfriend bossed him into it). One evening the kindly Professor Crowley asks him to look over the clogged-up pipes in his basement. Jack acquiesces; this leads to that, that leads to this, and an ancient evil is let loose and the good professor is gradually transformed into an insatiable monster. Now it's up to Jack Brooks to apply his colossal bad mood and his two-fisted plumbling skills to hold back the hellish thing which the professor had become. Jack has clearly given up on getting a good grade in class.

JACK BROOKS MONSTER SLAYER kicks it old school, and the cast & crew are proud of it. CGI gets pooh-poohed as the special effects crew goes kabonkers with rubber latex and gooey make-up, with puppeteering and animatronics and even more rubber latex. The result is a gallery of purposely iffy-looking monsters, some (or most) of which are so cheesy that even Sid and Marty Krofft go: ""Dudes, seriously?""

As a child of the '80s, I had a great time with this film and didn't at all get bent out of shape at the Ashley Williams/Evil Dead callbacks, and, yes, absolutely, this lead part is tailor made for a younger Bruce Campbell. Trevor Matthews - who also plays the blue forest troll - makes a credible enough horror action lead and his rants are awesome. When he finally mans up and springs into monster slaying mode, he demonstrates a viable presence. The final stages of the film feature buckets of gore and blood and ickiness, but it's done in such a way that you can't take it seriously. If you get in the spirit of the thing, you won't mind a bit.

Robert Englund is a longtime treasure not only of the horror cinema but of sci-fi as well (in a weird way, it was his sympathetic alien character in V that infused humanity into that mini-series). In the Behind the Scenes segment, Englund mentions that this was probably the last time in his career that he can attempt some physical comedy. Ergo, he takes advantage of the film's light tone and goes for the gusto with the physical antics (Englund refers to it as ""Beetlejuicing""), as his professor undergoes his squirrely demonic change. This metamorphosis calls for non-stop belching and scratching and gross overeating and then vomiting. Robert Englund is friggin' awesome in one of his best roles in recent years. This movie is worth watching for his performance alone.

The DVD Special Features include: an entertaining, cheerfully profane audio commentary by Director Jon Knautz, Producer Patrick White, Producer/Actor Trevor Matthews, and Composer Ryan Shore; the Behind the Scenes documentary (50 minutes long, and really comprehensive); The World Premiere at Sitges, Spain; Storyboard comparisons - six scenes from the movie with the pretty simplistic storyboard sketches picture-in-pictured on them (hilariously, it looks like a 6-year-old drew these sketches); On Set Still Gallery (44 photos); Conceptual Art Gallery (14 images); Creating the Music (almost 13 minutes of maybe more than you wanted to know about the score); Creating the Monsters (15 minutes, and these cats really break down their practical f/x); 5 Deleted Scenes, including the Professor, already possessed, scarfing wings at a bar with his class; and the trailer.",1269993600,4,4145,4.887624466571835
3503505,5,B001C0NMU2,"I had heard good things about this flick online, but being a long-time watcher of all manner of horror and monster movies, the description on the DVD rental case made me sneer in cynicism.  The thought of watching yet another no-talent mess filled with pandering humor and the usual (yawn) gore and (yuck) CGI FX trying real hard to be another ""Re-animator"", ""Evil Dead 2"" or ""Tremors"" just annoyed me to no end, so I put it back.  The next time I was there, I must have been in just the right mood, because I recalled having enjoyed a fairly recent one of these called ""Feast"", which was typical, but outrageously so to such a degree that it elevated itself to being a must-see for genre lovers, so, I rented ""Jack Brooks"".  Boy, am I glad I gave it a chance.

First of all, don't expect a hectic pace from start to finish as in ""Feast"" or ""Evil Dead 2"".  The plot for this one unfolds more like a typical B-movie, starting with scenes that establish the characters and situation, then escalates the horror elements as the story progresses towards the finale, a story structure more like ""Re-animator"" or ""From Beyond"", but with the accent a little more on the humorous side than those 2 worthy films. However, ""Jack Brooks"" lacks the feeling of inventiveness that those movies had.  Speaking of '80s horror classics, the good news here is no cheap CGI effects, but honest-to-goodness monster suits and make-up that you can sink your teeth into.  Someone finally got it right when they decided to give us something real rather than a cartoon.

Plot summary:  when a child, Jack Brooks witnessed the murder of his family by supernatural creatures, so as an adult, he still has serious anger issues stemming from the trauma of that childhood incident.  While going to college with his shrew of a girlfriend and studying under a geeky professor(Robert Englund) and surrounded by idiotic fellow students, he regularly visits a counselor over these aforementioned anger issues. Bear in mind that, despite my descriptions of these characters, they are portrayed mostly realistically by the cast, with a minimum of slapstick. When the professor gets possessed by an evil, supernatural entity, Jack finally comes face-to-face with his childhood fears, and becomes the meanest monster-killin' machine this side of Rotor-rooter.

Englund takes an effectively comic turn as the professor, and much has been made about his performance so I need not get into it; suffice to say that it is very good, although faint echoes of the roach alien from ""Men in Black"" come to mind.  The real star of this movie, though, is the actor who played Jack (his name escapes me.  The special features section of the DVD indicates that he was one of the producers thrown in to play Jack at the last minute).  Some people here have posted that his acting was bad, because he didn't act like Bruce Campbell or some such.  GOOD!  The filmmakers have attempted to keep an original feel to their  movie and Jack has a personality all his own, one that you can believe, with no quirky, over-the-top shenanigans.  From the hollow look in his eyes when he rages to the slightly lost look when confronted with the complexities of day-to-day life that threaten to overwhelm him, this actor is absolutely convincing as the type of guy who might show up at your door to unclog your sink, yet he still manages to amuse, even eliciting a couple of outright laughs from me. Exuding an aura of ""everyman"", he eventually recruits audience sympathy without ever turning into a clown. We are clearly supposed to see the world from HIS viewpoint, where it is everyone ELSE who is crazy.  While Brooks is played straight-faced, it is all the other characters who are played campy.  As such, Bruce Campbell would have been woefully wrong for this role, as this is not some attempt to reproduce ""Evil Dead 2"", and I applaud the producers for taking the high-road and shooting for originality. Also, special mention must go to the actress who wittily, and with subtle camp, portrayed his very irritating girlfriend.  The climax itself, while entertaining, feels derivative of some of the more forgettable '80s monster flicks such as ""the Brain"", or ""the Gate"".  In fact, the whole movie has the feeling of an ""origin"" story, but is good enough that I look forward to seeing sequals.  For this reason, I feel this to be a 4-star movie, but I give it a 5 just to offset the low ratings given by some other reviewers who can't seem to get a horror-comedy that cleverly evokes smiles rather than cheap ""laughs"", or who can't appreciate a nuanced performance but must have extreme facial contortions as a sign of ""zaniness"".

Ultimately, when dealing with low-budget B-flicks, one shouldn't expect something that will change the face of film making (although it isn't unheard of).  Bear in mind what this is, a cheap but amusing little tribute to the '80s B-movie done with heart, and you will find yourself pleasantly surprised.  Highly recommended for genre fans.",1264896000,2,5008,4.80093131548312
3503506,3,B001C0NMU2,"Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer (Jon Knautz, 2007)

I ended up liking this one a whole lot better than I thought I would, though the special effects were clumsy, and we could have used some slightly better actors in a couple of the main roles. Still, you get what you pay for, and for a basement budget production, you get a decent amount for this one.

Jack (Trevor Matthews) is a plumber, taking some classes at the local college and on-again off-again dating a real shrew, Eve (Rachel Skarsten). He also has some serious anger issues, for which he's seeing an incompetent shrink (Daniel Kash), though that's beside the point. One of his professors, Gordon Crowley (Robert Englund), asks Jack if he'll come over one night and help with the plumbing in the old, spooky house the professor just bought. We find out through the grapevine that bad things tend to happen in that house, and just as we find this out, the professor has uncovered an old box in the backyard and is dragging it into the house...

There have been many comparisons made to Army of Darkness here, and I can see where the people making them are coming from. Raimi goes a lot farther over the top, and ended up with a much better movie, but Knautz gets that same sort of horror-and-humor blend going early on here and never lets up. Englund is pitch-perfect, naturally, and Matthews does well, but the rest of the main characters leave something to be desired in the acting department. Still, no one ever intended this to be a classic, and if you're looking for a fun way to kill an hour and a half, this will fill the bill. ***",1263600000,,1595,4.5121107266435985

And the Hellboy mention on the box is a little absurd. But for low-brow, low-budget fair, Jack Brooks is worth checking out for genre fans.  The prosthetic effects would be cheesy even for an 80's horror.  But rather than pretending it's something it's not, Jack Brooks makes the most of its budget for a cheesy good time.  Some work on the script and those comparisons to the Evil Dead just might be more valid.  But, as is, it's just a decent imitator compared to one of the all-time cult-classics.

Anchor Bay's 1080p video presentation looks outstanding.  Trust me, the very best DVD doesn't come close in detail and dimensionality.  Unfortunately praise of the films visual preservation is about the only positive critique I can give Anchor Bay's otherwise cheap and/or lazy treatment of the film.  The studio started out strong on BD with PCM and lossless support across the board, but lately one has to wonder if Anchor Bay isn't in the same dire straits as MGM. Most of their more recent BD offerings have been handicapped by lossy compressed audio and, for Jack Brooks they didn't even create a compulsory menu.  So, even the DVD could be technically more advanced than this disc.

There are no extras.  But more than that, BD's interactivity goes wasted.  You can't hit the pop-up menu to select another chapter.  While the disc is partitioned, there is no menu for scene selection at all.  Once you load the disc, the feature just repeats itself in a loop until you press stop or eject the disc.  Fortunately the video doesn't appear to be hampered by the same lowly effort.  The audio is a little weak and favors a made-for-TV fidelity most of the time.  But without a lossless encode, we'll never know if it's the mix that's limiting or the lossy compression algorithms messing it up.",1261872000,,1931,4.782477341389728

Dir: Jon Knautz

Perf: Robert Englund, Trevor Matthews, Rachel Skarsten, and David Fox

I loved this movie. I cannot wait to buy it so I can listen to the commentary. After doing a bit of research, I found that Knautz and Matthews started their own production company called Brookstreet Pictures. This is their first feature film, and I can't wait to see the sequel, Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer II(2010), as well as The Shrine(2010), starring Matthews and Aaron Ashmore (also directed by Knautz).

After reading the title, I thought it would be a horror spoof. I expected something between Buffy The Vampire Slayer(1992) and Shawn Of The Dead(2004). Much to my delight, I found it to be right on target, taking itself just seriously enough to make the horror, comedy and action work. Think early John Carpenter meets early Sam Raimi.

The character of Jack Brooks is a plumber, orphaned as a child by a monstrous troll. He has an anger management problem and a tool belt full of plumbing supplies. Monsters beware! Matthews is amazing. His humor and drama were both nicely executed. Not to mention the action. He can really hold his own with a pipe, an axe and some duct tape!

The make up and monster suits were really well done. Far better than I have seen in so many other films with much higher budgets. The gore was pretty top notch. I had to look away a couple times. There was an ample amount of blood/goop when monsters were dispatched. This is also where I must compliment the continuity/script supervisor. After working as a script supervisor, I know the difficulties involved with keeping bloody wardrobe and make-up in check. Not once in the course of this film did I catch a continuity error. This also speaks volumes about the editing. Kudos to Katharine Jane Reid (script supervisor) and Matthew Brulotte (editor).

And to top it all off, the fight choreography was either exceptionally well planned, or completely spontaneous actions of a couple of guys just beating the tar out of each other. I love that the character is not superheroesque. He scraps with evil, and has the bruises to prove it.

Trivia (from IMDb): Robert Englund agreed to the film after seeing the short film Still Life by the Brookstreet Pictures boys.

******SPOILER******
Robert Englund is a major player in the film. I really didn't expect this. Normally, when a tiny independent film scores a major name, it is a cameo role. That cameo is usually exploited in the trailer to increase the attraction of the film. Not in this case! Mr. Englund has a nice chunk of screen time before he turns into a toothy version of Jaba The Hutt's little brother. He plays a very sweet role before the horror begins. I'm so used to his creepy portrayals in films like Urban Legends(1998) where he plays a potential killer in a mystery, or (of course) the Nightmare On Elmstreet Franchise(1984-2004). (Jackie Earle Haley is set to take on the role of Fred Krueger in the 2010 Remake of the 1984 original.)",1259452800,2,3036,4.776717557251908

3503512,2,B001C0NMU2,"I recently picked up the DVD, Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer as a blind purchase. At a glance, this low budget indie flick had quite a bit going for it. I loved the premise (loser plumber is treated like dirt by all, until he finally flips out and kills a horde of monsters), the inclusion of Robert Englund never hurts, and I loved the title.  It seemed like the perfect low budget horror flick. Visions of Evil Dead 2008 danced in my head as I went home to watch it. Too bad that the most fun I had with this movie was imagining how awesome it would be.

How could anybody screw up this movie so badly? JB: MS is all about the cathartic payoff of watching Jack flip out and kill monsters. Sadly, the director spent way too much time building up to that point. I get it, Jack is a traumatized mess, with a whiny girlfriend and worthless life. The guy is also a total snooze with zero on-screen charisma. Anytime he is on screen talking I felt compelled to shut the DVD off. Jack's only redeeming quality is the rage pent up inside him and we only see it briefly throughout the entire film.

This movie needed less talking and a whole lot more monster slaying (some memorable one-liners couldn't hurt either). Robert Englund tries his best to salvage this film from going down the crapper, but even his hammed up scenes eventually wore thin. Englund's slap stick spiral towards becoming a demonic creature was easily the most amusing aspect during an otherwise stale middle act. The filmmakers must have known this because almost too much time is devoted to it. Eventually, I found myself begging for him to turn into a monster just so that the brutality would finally start!

I will give credit to the folks who made this film for not succumbing to tacky CG effects. The mutants and monsters are all done with prosthetics, puppets and makeup which is the way it should be in my book. Things take the slightest turn for the better once the monster brutality starts up. Sadly, the movie ends shortly after.  Just when this turd finally gets good it ends.

Had the filmmakers focused more on the gory action rather than the forgettable plot this would have been an instant classic. Jack Brooks has TONS of potential, but with the complete lack of suspense, only a few sparse laughs (thank you Mr. Englund), and zero memorable gore scenes you might want to look elsewhere for your horror comedy fix.

I would chuck that up to every story has to have a begining kind of thing though. I would say if/when there is a sequal, the story should have a quicker flow, just my assumption.

Now I'd like to see Mr. Brooks take on monsters that exist in other movies.

3503517,3,B001C0NMU2,"Jack Brooks is an angry guy and he doesn't know what to do about it. It's not just that his cute but incessantly annoying girlfriend drives him nuts by trying to control his life, though that doesn't help. No, the real problem is that Jack lost his whole family on a camping trip when he was just a kid to a man-eating troll lurking in the woods, and ever since, he has felt guilty for doing nothing to save them. But Jack is about to get a chance to turn his life around as a strange and evil entity takes over his science professor and begins to reek havoc, and only a really angry guy could stand a chance at defeating it and saving the day!

Do you remember that line from Jurassic Park that goes something like, ""You do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur-tour, right?"" That's how one feels while watching ""Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer"". You do plan to have monster slaying in this movie at some point, right? As it turns out, ""Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer"" hopes to be the first of multiple films, and this is Jack's origin story. Okay, fair enough. Trouble is, if you're not going to deliver much monster slaying in this homage to Evil Dead and Army of Darkness-style films, ya better bring the funny. Am I right? Well, Jack Brooks doesn't, and this second let-down is just too much. It really is a shame to have to say it, too. Jack Brooks is an earnest film. It sports good acting (not all, but some, including a fine performance from Robert Englund), uses practical special effects, something to be applauded in horror films in this day and age, went all out for its score, and makes a solid effort to be great, but when your script is lacking (in this case humor, not to mention any personality traits to make you really root for Jack) and your grand-finale monster looks like something from a Japanese hentai video (tentacles and all, and it's painful to watch the scenes where victims are holding the tentacles onto their bodies to appear ""caught""), well...

On the upside, ""Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer"" gets the kind of DVD treatment all films should get, and it has Rachel Skarsten as Jack's girlfriend too (though I'd rather drool over her in the slightly campy ""Birds of Prey"" than be irritated by her here). The anamorphic widescreen DVD includes deleted scenes (some that probably should have stayed in the film), a thorough behind the scenes documentary with interviews and all, a separate featurette on the music of the film, a storyboard to film comparison (and seeing these storyboards, it's no wonder it's so hard to get paying storyboard gigs; Here's a director who uses stick figures and finds them quite sufficient), a concept art gallery, a still gallery, the film's trailer, and a featurette on the world premiere at Sitges, Spain. Oh, there's also a rockin' and totally misleading slipcover and a commentary with director Jon Knautz, producer Patrick White, producer and star Trevor Matthews, and composer Ryan Shore. The commentary is possibly a more entertaining way to watch the film than, you know, just watching the film.

So, here's the sum-up. If you haven't read about it first, you're going to go into ""Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer"" expecting an awesome new horror/comedy in the vein of the old Sam Raimi/Bruce Campbell stuff. That's what this film wants to be and promises to be. What it is, is an attempt to be that kind of film but with very little successful humor, almost no likeable characters (aside from Robert Englund's for a very short time), and, well, it just doesn't manage to do what it's trying to do, though it puts a lot of effort into it. If they just had one guy working on the script who could really do comedy like the oldschool horror this film is trying to emulate, it might have been pretty darn good! I'm giving it 2 stars for the effort and another for Rachel and the great DVD from Anchor Bay. Hopefully, Jack Brooks 2 will be much better, as I'm sure it's on the way.",1234224000,,3935,4.594594594594595

This is a very funny oldschool movie. It opts for monsters suits and makeup over the CGI, and it does it well. The movie itself was a bit slow at first and I would have preferred more action. The hero's story, as well as the other character's development, take too long to set up and it makes the movie drag a bit for the first half. The situations and events are entertaining, although it could have done with better editing.

The characters are funny caricatures of the usual stereotypes: the teacher's pet, the drummer, the sensitive guy, the hemp rocker girl, etc. The actors delivered pretty good performances. The dialogue is funny, albeit not new, but it keeps one entertained.

The extras include audio commentary, behind the scenes, a featurette about creating the monsters and another one about the music used (which was pretty good), deleted scenes, storyboards, trailers and galleries.

3503521,3,B001C0NMU2,"After getting good comments on this movie from friends and reading positive reviews in the web I decided to order this movie and give it a try. Well, while not the kind of movie I like, I can see why this movie has become a ""cult"" film for fans of horror films.

Starring Trevor Matthews and Robert Englund (who played Freddy Krueger in Elm Street franchise), the movie tells the story of Jack (Matthews), a guy with anger management issues that witnessed the murder of his parents and sister by a monster when he was a young kid. As an adult he works as a plumber until one day he accidentally awakens an ""ancient evil"". From then on, the movie is filled with clichs from horror films from the 80's, the monsters characterizations are all real, no CGI was used in the film, there's a monster with tentacles and they are animated via stop motion. I hope this helps get the picture. In watching one of the documentaries included they explain this was the approach they wanted, not to use CGI and do ""retro"" special effects. The result is overall good, in this kind of movies the story isn't really vital, but if you're looking for a monster film this is definitely for you. Action sequences are extremely violent and the main monster is really disgusting... similar to  Jabba the Hutt from Star Wars...

The movie is presented in anamorphic widescreen with great picture quality for a DVD. Extras include trailers, 2 documentaries on the movie and its special effects as well as picture galleries with sketches and pictures from the set.

Recommended for fans of the genre.",1229385600,,1572,4.643884892086331
3503522,1,B001C0NMU2,"This movie is a waste of your time. I hope that some of the actors in this movie get a start in movie making from this movie, but that is about it. The story line is terrible, it's a jumbled mess.",1229126400,,196,3.8048780487804876
3503523,3,B001C0NMU2,"I didn't know much about this movie at all before watching it.  For what it is, it's pretty entertaining.  At 85 minutes, this movie doesn't screw around.  It gets in, does what it needs to do, and gets out.  The performances are good - a pleasant surprise in a B movie.  And the plot makes just enough sense to keep you from thinking about it too much during the short running time.  JBMS manages to be funny without being jokey, and doesn't let the comedy run roughshod over the horror.  And it may be the only horror movie ever to be shot in located in Ottowa, Canada.

On the downside, the big tentacle monster in Act 3 is one of the fakest, lamest, most unbelievable monsters in the annals of horror films.  It makes you look at the giant pickle of ""It Conquered the World"" as a masterpiece of effects.

If you like horror movies, this is at least worth a rent.",1228608000,,866,4.290123456790123
3503524,3,B001C0NMU2,"In the special features on this DVD, writer/producer/star/bizwiz Trevor Matthews says he and his buddies (co-writer John Ainslee and director Jon Knautz) were keen to replicate the low-budget charms of 80's horror films like James Cameron's PIRANHA 2, Sam Raimi's EVIL DEAD and the early works of PETER JACKSON--films that entertained them growing up in the comforts of suburbia. Yet watching their JACK BROOKS: MONSTER SLAYER, it fast becomes apparent that Matthews and company were working with a much larger budget (even adjusted for inflation) and crew than any of their idols. Elsewhere in the special features, someone (Matthews? Can't remember) lets it slip that Matthews' father, an extremely wealthy Canadian business tycoon, ponied up the dough. So basically, Junior popped off to acting school, learned to act (quite well, actually), then bypassed the usual audition process and instead packaged a calling card that presumably would launch him and his cohorts onto the scene. Their prior experience amounted to a few decent, but barely-seen Canadian short films, so without the intervention of papa's money, the road ahead might not have reached your local Best Buy so quickly. While that's not a bad thing in and of itself, I'm not sure positioning themselves as down 'n dirty mavericks actually helps their cause.

Nonetheless, there's some good stuff here, though little originality beyond Matthews' aggressive take on the title character, a rolling ball of barely-concealed rage with scarred childhood memories (his parents and sister were slaughtered by a troll), raging anger management issues, a useless therapist, a nagging new-agey girlfriend, a college night class in chemistry (run by professor Robert Englund) that he knows won't likely improve his lot in life and, when he inadvertently unleashes an evil gas and a demonic heart from Englund's yard during some routine pipework that turns the good doc into a bloated, puke-encrusted monster that starts eating Jack's classmates, a reason to become the heroic ass-kicker of the title. Disenfranchised gamer types will undoubtedly find much to admire in this character. Others will have to hope he'll be a little deeper in the inevitable sequel.

JACK BROOKS: MONSTER SLAYER is a horror-comedy ode to 80's genre films that too often substitutes aggression for wit and backs it all up with an overcompensating 91-piece orchestra score that Cameron, Raimi et. al could never have afforded for their first features. Thankfully, the cast never pushes tongue too firmly in cheek and most are able to tease interesting quirks out of their two-dimensional characters (Englund is ideally cast, and Matthews' could have a good future in front of the camera), and there's a modest amount of ingenuity in the ""handmade"" special effects despite their being crafted by professionals, but the whole endeavour seems packaged to within an inch of its life, with easily-persuaded cult film fest denizens clearly in mind, those who could reliably be expected to buy into and expound upon its thoroughly calculated ""cult"" appeal while the filmmakers were likely already working on the features-laden DVD with Anchor Bay.

This is indeed low-budget territory, just not as low as the filmmakers would probably have us believe, and not once do you get the feeling the filmmakers had to fear a lack of funding like their vaunted predecessors. They got what they paid for, and thankfully most of it's up on screen.",1227657600,,3462,5.245487364620939
3503525,1,B001C0NMU2,"WELL I DON T LIKE THIS MOVIE AT ALL  I COULD N T SEE THE END  AS I WAS  SO BORING

3503526,2,B001C0NMU2,"A plumber with serious anger management issues fighting monsters -with Robert Englund thrown in for good measure.  That sounds like a pretty good formula for success.  Unfortunately, Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer pretty much lays an egg.  It's a movie without any soul and very little identity.  I hate to call it a horror comedy because it fails on both counts.  Sure, there's gore aplenty, but it's all so over the top as to be more pitiful than anything else.  On top of that, it sort of annoyed this devoted horror fan to hear the filmmakers say they chose this genre for their first feature film basically because there would be a ready market in place no matter how badly they might screw the whole thing up.  In other words, they thought a horror film was much easier to make than, say, a drama.  Oh, they also thought it would be a lot of fun to play around with all the special effects and makeup.  Obviously, I have to question their commitment and level of respect for the genre I love most in the world.  In fact, I would argue that the film actually ends up making a mockery of the entire horror genre.  And comedy?  Please.  I don't remember even one remotely funny scene in the entire film.  The whole thing's laughable, but it's not funny.

So just who is Jack Brooks?  Well, he's a plumber, and he's taking a night school science class because his incredibly annoying girlfriend somehow talked him into it.  Jack (Trevor Matthews) has some issues - having watched his family slaughtered by a troll (yeah, you read that right: a troll) back when he was still a kid, he is prone to intense outbursts of anger (borne of his guilt over running for his life while his parents and sister were brutally killed).  He's seeing a therapist, but let's just say that no personal breakthrough seems likely any time soon.  As luck would have it, Jack's professor (Robert Englund) is having some serious plumbing problems at his new home (a dilapidated old house he bought for a song because it's supposedly cursed).  Jack accidentally awakens something evil there, and the next thing you know Professor Crowley begins turning into an evil, viciously aggressive Jabba the Hut.  It looks like Jack is finally going to get a second chance to test the old flight or fight response.

I applaud the filmmakers for eschewing CGI for more traditional methods of monster creation, but I think they went way overboard with all the special effects.  In the end, the monsters just look increasingly foolish.  Heck, the whole movie looks increasingly foolish.  Without the safety net of a decent, original script and/or a genuinely comedic presence, thing whole thing falls hard and fast right into the ground.

The DVD does at least come with some decent bonus material.  There's a commentary featuring the filmmakers, a fairly lengthy Behind the Scenes feature, some sixteen minutes of deleted scenes, and several other goodies.  To tell you the truth, I didn't care enough about the film to watch all of the special features, but those who actually enjoy this movie may well be interested in them.",1227052800,2,3088,4.7322097378277155
3503527,4,B001C0NMU2,"First off let me say that if you don't like cheezy horror flicks, this movie is not for you. And I don't mean ""gee, I liked Nightmare on Elm Street 2,456"" cheezy. This is a cheezy that has it's roots in the worst of the 80s horror flicks.

The plot revolves around a rather angry everyman known as Jack, who not only has problems controlling his anger, but also just problems in general. His girlfriend's thinking about straying, his classwork is going nowhere, & he's stuck in a job that gives  him no satisfaction. This all changes the night that he tries to repair his professor's pipes & accidentally summons an evil demon that posesses his teacher. What's a guy to do?

While this wasn't nearly as good as the 80s cheeze that preceeded it, the movie did an overall good job of summoning up a similar feel. The special effects are pretty good for a flick with a limited budget, but it's the actors that ended up being the overall weak spot of the film. The only exception is the always wonderful Robert Englund, who is the one true reason to watch the film. He's magnificent as always in his scream king type roles. The actors do a good job of looking darn good, but don't really endear themselves very well. When the forces of evil finally do start wreaking havock, you start to hope that they not only win, but that they kill off some of the more annoying characters. Even so, this film was far more enjoyable than I expected it to be. As long as you don't expect a lot from it, the film is fantastic.

3503528,4,B001C0NMU2,"When I looked at the cover art for the movie, the first thing I wondered was ""will this be bad as in an awful movie"" or ""will this be bad as in B-movie sexy?"" It has all the things that make one think it could be either - the description on the back draws on a silly plot line that you know is going to be weird and gimmicky, the picture on the front looks like a poster that fell off a Troma bus, and the actors themselves sound like a horror convention stopping in a town nearby. When I watched it I kept thinking ""this is great to have been able to see,"" and yet it confused me with that B-movie feeling hat comes when you watch something truly conflicting.
It is a good feeling to not know how to fill in the feeling.

As far as the immediate needs of a movie go, this flies all the B-movie standards. It has the acting that is brilliant and yet borders close to criminal, it wears a suit that says ""no money"" and yet makes one feel like it plays out wonderfully, it recycles names and faces and yet creates characters that are stereotypes -with flavor?, and has a plot that seems like something you would not want to watch but it keeps drawing the eyes in. I personally found myself laughing at things that I did not think I could like while drawing sober breaths, kept wondering if my peers would enjoy it while secretly knowing that many of them would love the thing (they like the Toxic Avenger, C.H.U.D., and other acts of awful goodness, by the way), and I also wondered what to put in a review on something that could be seen in such different ways. As I said before, I could understand why some people would absolutely hate this movie and yet I understand why I liked it quite a bit. Really, I guess the review becomes conflicted just as much as watching something like this does.

If you like B-movies, check this one out. Maybe check it out in a rental fashion first, casually loving it before taking it home to live with you, or jump straight in if this is your cup of tea. Either way, I thought this was a sexy walk through a hive and depends on how much you like the B's.",1226966400,,2088,4.191542288557214
3503529,4,B001C0NMU2,"The first thing that really caught my attention was that this flick was released through Anchor Bay. I have yet to be disappointed with the quality of any DVD (or VHS) from them, and this is no exception. The transfer is crisp and clear and when watched through my Samsung DVD-V9650 upconverting HDMI player on my 56"" JVC Genessa 1080p D-ILA TV it looks very much like a true high definition DVD. Kudos once again to the good folks at Anchor Bay.

The plot really isn't very important to a movie like this since it's main appeal is the gore, so to put it in a nutshell a dormant evil is awakened through unplanned events and is trying to spread itself. The evil manages to transform normal human beings into hideously monstrous creatures in it's quest to multiply. Enter Jack Brooks...a guy with a chip on his shoulder and a temper from hell. Will Jack save the day? Can he even save himself?? Robert Englund turns in another sparkling performance as a teacher turned creature, and Trevor Matthews does a credible job as Jack Brooks. Gore afficionados won't be disappointed with this flick as it compares favorably to the first two Evil Dead movies. Therein lies the one rub...no new ground was broken; so while there are copious amounts of gore there is an almost total absence of fear.

If you want to watch something that makes the hairs on your neck stand up straight and your heart beat wildly...this is not your movie. If you want a good-time retro carnage flick, by all means get this!",1226793600,,1492,4.584269662921348

3503531,2,B001C0NMU2,"Looking at the cover art for this DVD, you might expect a movie chock full of monster killing action and adventure.  Such is not the case.  We get a little monster action at the beginning, and finally a bit more in the last 15 minutes, but in between we've got nothing but the dull life of Jack Brooks.  For a main character, Jack isn't particularly likable.  In fact, throughout the whole movie I thought he looked like he could use a bath.  He visits his psychiatrist about 4 times for help with his anger management issues.  The psychiatrist is pretty lousy at his job, offering touch-feely solutions which Jack will have no part of.  I guess this stuff was supposed to be funny, but the highest compliment I can give it is that it wasn't actually tiresome.  But funny?  No, not really.  Jack also attends a chemistry class in the evening.  Robert Englund is the ""professor"", though from the material being studied it's more like a remedial high school class.  Englund owns a big old house and is having trouble with his plumbing.  Being a plumber, Jack goes over to fix the problem, but it turns out he's a pretty lousy plumber and only ends up pressurizing some pipe which releases some gas;  an evil gas.  This causes Englund to dig up some crate buried in his yard, which contains some evil black heart which jumps into his body and slowly - very slowly - takes over his body.

You know there's some monster action coming, but before it arrives we get yet more ""funny"" stuff.  Englund comes to class in mid transformation.  The students assume he's drunk.  Jack has a little fight with his girlfriend.  I think another visit to the psychiatrist is in order as well.  Finally we get some cheesy monster action at the end.  It's not bad, fairly fun actually.  But the wait was entirely too long.

You know what this movie needed?  T&A.  That would have helped a whole lot.  Overall, I was expecting a real adventure, but instead got a Shaun of the Dead style thing.  I didn't find that movie the least bit funny either - in fact I turned it off halfway through because I was bored out of my skull.

The film wants so badly for its hero to have that reputation and cult film iconic status, but despite the fact that the film has slight tinges of that, more specifically during the film's opening and conclusion, it just doesn't come close and it fails even more in my eyes for trying so hard.  Although I do give credit to the filmmakers for having Jack be an ill-tempered underdog loser that finds his niche while destroying big stupid looking monsters.  However, in the process of offering up a fairly unique personality, it also makes the character completely unappealing to me, to the point where I would want to see him die violently at the hands of co-star Robert England's iconic villain&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freddy-Kruger/dp/0780626966/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freddy Kruger</a>.

If you identify with the character Jack Brooks and find yourself enjoying other gory horror/comedies, then this might be just the film for you.  I nearly hated this.

As a boy Jack Brooks saw his family torn to shreds by some kind dog-like humanoid.  As an adult he is a plumber who is nearly insane with rage.  There are confusing scenes where Jack is taking night classes and has several therapy sessions.  His night class teacher played by Robert Englund, needs some plumbing work done and Jack comes over to help.  Together they inexplicably unleash some kind of force of monsters and the fun ensues.

I was actually pretty bored watching this.  Something about the sticky and silly gore coupled with Jack just being a character I didn't want to root for, made me completely disinterested.  I don't want to criticize the first hour for being slow because although it was slower than it needed to be, there was some effort to establish characters and pace.  Still, Jack may not be likeable for me but he is richer than your average character in a film like this and if I'm being honest, the actor Trevor Matthews does a pretty decent job.  Furthermore on the positive side, it does have some fun moments, in fact towards the end it has more fun moments than boring moments but fun and stupid are mostly the same thing here, so take that for what it is.",1226620800,,2883,5.528473804100228

Now an anger-ridden twentysomething plumber, Jack struggles daily with an annoying as hell girlfriend, anger management therapy sessions that never resolve a thing, and a forced by his girlfriend biology night class that barely holds his interest. However, his biology teacher is none other than Professor Crowley (Robert Englund)who has just purchased an old house that is in need of a little ""plumber's helper"".  A box is dug up along with a beating heart, an ancient curse is released and then mayhem ensues.

Newcomer Trevor Matthews packs a punch as the lead Jack Brooks.  Having only 3 other film credits to his name, Trevor is a natural actor, plays a great hero and hopefully will have many more opportunities to shine like he did in this film. If you liked ""Shaun Of The Dead"", ""The Evil Dead"", ""Dead Alive"" or any of the other horror/comedy zombie films, you will enjoy ""Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer"".

If you've never wasted hours and hours on Troma, if you've never opted for Dimension Extremes over studying for mid-terms, if you still have no idea what I am referring to, I guarantee you aren't going to understand this film.

Jack Brooks (as well as all the above-mentioned films) is a B-horror which doesn't even claim to rank itself among ""mainstream"" horror. It's not mistakenly ""bad,"" it's deliberately ""bad"" (big difference). It's camp! The special-effects and make-up are simply wretched (especially the grotesquely hysterical ""Professor Gordon Crowley Monster""). There is no CGI in this movie, by the way ... it's all old-school ... just the way we like it!! The typical B-horror fan expects this! It's not trying to be scary! But it does have the requisite ""gross-out"" moments ... and, yes, B-horror enthusiasts both anticipate and enjoy this visceral experience.

For the B-horror pros: this film has pretty much everything you're looking for. The laughs are all there, there are multiple gag-worthy scenes, and it is TOTAL camp! I can admit that I picked-up this film for Robert Englund and had some fairly low-expectations. And when I read the comparisons to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Evil-Dead/dp/B000WC3864/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Evil Dead</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-Alive/dp/157362408X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead Alive</a>, my expectations plunged (it's practically blasphemous to compare a new work to the likes of Raimi or Jackson's masterpieces, please). Nonetheless, the second I saw the zany filming, the realistic casting (I felt like I know these people), and the hysterical stunts ... well, I was sold. And the film's bookends? Bizarrely compelling. (And, honestly, for all its B-quality, there seems to be serious money involved for location and props! Prepare to be surprised!)

I must say, I went into this film ready to hate it ... and I ended up watching it again. And, just as a note, Englund really does have a sizable role (it's not just a teaser-role) ... and he does a fantastic job being completely ridiculous (wait for the possession scenes!! And wait for him to enter the classroom completely messed-up AND ooooo sooooo HUNGRY!!)

Highly recommended to B-horror fans!! Everyone else, run away (so that you don't bring down the star-rating of this great film!)",1226188800,,3171,6.783783783783784
3503536,1,B001C0NMU2,"If you are into juvenile horror movies - this one is for you.  I wanted to see it for Halloween season and I did and now I cannot wait to get rid of it.  Premise of the movie is that our main character Jack Brooks is an orphan whose sister and parents were killed by a monster when he was a kid.  Jack has unresolved anger issues and his counceling sessions are not helping him control his temper. When his accidental plumbing job awakens monsters from their long sleep and they start attacking his night school college student buddies, Jack finds it in himself to figh off the monsters as a way of conquering his own personal demons.  This is a cross of gross (throw up) scenes, imitations of rubber made monsters you may have seen in movies made 20 years ago and blood hungry zombies running around in their feeding frenzy.",1225670400,,825,4.407894736842105
3503537,4,B001C0NMU2,"You like cult films? How about tongue and cheek horror films? Cornball humor? If you do, well, Canadian director/co-writer Jon Knautz seems to have genre films pretty much nailed down. ""JACK BROOKS: MONSTER SLAYER"" is a fun horror-comedy entry to the ""Cine-Macabre"" movie night in Toronto. The film will definitely attract fans of the ""Evil Dead"" franchise and is a definite crowd pleaser for those who like B-movie thrills and thrills.

Ever since he witnessed his family slaughtered by a monster during a childhood camping trip, Jack Brooks (Trevor Matthews) has had some major anger management issues. But when a busted pipe in an old house owned by his night school teacher (Robert Englund) which transforms the kindly teacher to a ravenous, tentacled, infectious over-fiendish reject from Hell. Jack realizes that he can no longer run from the demons of his past and it is time to try and save his classmates before they are possessed or devoured by the ancient evil--or die trying.

The film is a rightful homage to 80's horror and very ""Evil Dead-ish"" in feel. The film is quite entertaining in its own charming way. The film does give a good background for our reluctant hero and the ""black heart"" of evil is cleverly developed as told by old man Howard, played by David Fox. The shots are reminiscent of classic B-movies and the cinematography somewhat emulates a comic book feel. The special effects does stay away from the usual CGI made by Hollywood, director Knautz opted to use animatronic monster effects, old-fashioned make-up and rubber suits to further emphasize the film's campy feel. There is a fair amount of gooey blood and gore with the old-fashioned 80's style.

Robert England may have turned in his best performance since his days of playing Freddy Krueger. Englund is quite convincing in his role as the mild-mannered teacher and honestly, the man steals the show. His slow, goofy and slimy metamorphosis into an almost ""Java the Hut"" clone is also one of the film`s selling points. I just couldn't decide whether I wanted to laugh or be grossed out, but I do know that these elements does fit the film perfectly. Matthews does give a good performance as our hero. His guilt-wracked moments of anger does give his character a lot of depth and somewhat generates a feel of sympathetic unbalanced features. In a way, this film has a ""coming of age"" story, the way Jack realizes his destiny.

The direction by Jon Knautz displays his love for the genre. The film's shots and creature effects are a joy to behold for 80's horror fans. The man did his homework in tackling a genre film such as this and certain scenes are just funny, in a way that it should be. Jack's girlfriend is a nagging one and she never stops talking; it does help with the film's doses of humor. The one problem I saw with the film is that the action doesn't really pick up until the 59 minute mark and for some audiences, the origin part may seem a little dull. The film dawdles a little too long in Jack's anger-management and relationship issues and I thought it would have done better if it had utilized more sequences of gruesome scenes. Also, as good as Englund and Matthews were in their roles, some characters seem like they're minor ""fillers"", and I do think the film could have been edited a little better.

Regardless, that the film's script could have been a little better, ""Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer"" does succeed in this genre. The final minutes of the film is worth the watch as Jack slices and dices monsters in a very ""Buffy-like"" fashion. It's a wonder just how much repressed anger and guilt can do to a person's adrenaline rush. The film has buckets of blood and it is a fantastic display of handmade horror destined to have a cult following. Now, the film may not be for everyone, but definitely geared towards those who appreciate old-fashioned creature effects and over-the-top silliness. A great homage film for 80's horror.

3503538,1,B001C0NMU2,"Looking at the box, it looks like it will be a ""fun horror movie.""  Or a ""fun dumb movie.""  You know, the kind you put on at parties.

Look elsewhere.

This movie really can't make its mind up.  And it has talent in it.  The acting shows promise.  The writing shows promise.  The filmmakers have learned good lessons from Scorsese and Raimi.  But the pacing is dreadful.  There's really only one monster who shows up, and when it does, it looks like Humpty Dumpty.  It is neither effective as a monster nor as a parody of a monster.  But if you're expecting a Charles Band-style ""classic,"" you won't find it.

If this movie looks appealing to you, as it looked to me, you're probably hoping for another EVIL DEAD/ARMY OF DARKNESS or REANIMATOR.  Just go ahead and watch (or rewatch) one of those.  This is not exciting.  It is not funny.  It is not a worthwhile use of camp.  It is not scary.  It just wastes your time.

Oh, and if I can editorialize a tad, let me note the saddest part of this movie -- the waste of Robert Englund's incredible talent.  Englund is one of those actors with idiosyncratic features who has finally aged into them.  You know, the features that look awkward on the young, but distinguished on the middle aged.  When he appears at the start of the movie, he gets to act a subtle, likable, intelligent character.  And he pulls it off beautifully.  It's a wonderful performance.  I was hoping that he would become a Giles or Professor Stokes-type advisor to the hero.  No.  It doesn't take long for the script to take this opportunity away from him.  He again is reduced to mugging and growling.  What a waste.  When I watched his character in the beginning, I though, ""Man, Englund could really be holding his own with any actor in his age range.""  I don't consider horror -- or even direct-to-DVD horror -- to be a ghetto, however there are roles of varying sophistication within that genre.  Englund's warmth, originality, and intelligence are really wasted here.  If this movie did anything, it was to make me aware of Englund's range and inspire in me a need to see him in better movies/more interesting parts.",1225497600,,2141,4.5473684210526315
3503539,2,B001C0NMU2,"Going back to a movie style that was significant in the 80s, with movies such as THE THING ( remake), EVIL DEAD, and what I knew originally as BRAINDEAD ( or is here called DEAD ALIVE), is a significant undertaking. Even if you allow that the commentary says it takes significantly from all of the three movies mentioned, there is something missing. The Core of most good films would seem to be a good script, and if you can't have a good script then original scenes such as EVIL DEAD and DEAD ALIVE ( where even in JACK BROOKS... the commentary says that Peter Jaackson basically never lets up in scene for scene) would seem to be the next best thing. And most of the 80s style creature effects are very good, however they do admit to using  at least three CGI sequences in the movie, but no big deal. The role of Robert Englund would have been much better if used to better devices. However, there is at least 40 minutes if not 50, where its horrifically boring ( maybe that was the comedy, I am not sure), but the commentary claims they wanted to save the best stuff for the last 25 minutes, and in some areas they do pull that off. I think if they kept the same structure and had someone who had a better idea of 80s Horror style write the script, then maybe a redo is in order.",1225497600,2,1282,4.254098360655738
3503540,5,B001C0NMU2,"I didn't think much when I popped this movie in but when it was over I felt refreshed. This movie was simply awesome. The special effects were well made (no CGI). The dialogue was funny and Robert Englund just going crazy just made me crack up like silly. Trevor Matthews was perfect as the hero and the mentally unstable guy that he is. This is one horror movie that has the delicacy to show an awesome ending much like Dead Alive.

SPOILER ALERT- if you haven't seen the movie don't read on but the ending is worth it.

First of all, it ends sort of like a blood bath, but that's not the best part. Jack's girl Eve, the screaming crybaby, gets dumped by Jack after he comes to his senses. I can't recall the girl's name whom he saves in the end, but he ends up having her to do the victory kiss with instead of Eve. The first thing that went through my mind is OH HELL YEAH. NOW THAT'S THE WAY A HORROR MOVIE SHOULD END IN MY OPINION! The hero saving the girl in the end and that's it (not excluding the jungle aftermath). All I know is this movie changed my perspective on what I want to do when I become a filmmaker and do some good horror flicks. Thanks Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer.

3503541,3,B001C0NMU2,"This film did not match my sense of humor, and it was difficult to watch. Surely it was supposed to be ""over the top"", and I did root for the lead character, hoping he'd be able to face his demons (figuratively and actually). But the film was overshadowed by the very ""campy"" type effects (all of the monster looked very fake), and the professor's (Robert Englund)transformation, while humorous, just added to the ridiclousness of this film. I did like the undertone of the film, as it repeatedly suggested that the lead character was running from his past, and he had to ""face his demons"". Ultimately the lead character manages to ""channel"" his angry personality into ""monster hunting"", and his facing his past allows him to diffuse it.

Yes, I'm talking about the one and only Robert Englund. This has got to be one of his best performances ever. Just watching him transform from a nerdy, mild mannered night school science teacher into a black hearted monster was great. I like that he doesn't start off as the killer/monster.

Of course the story isn't about Robert Englund's character. It's about the title character, Jack Brook.

Jack happens to have some anger issues, that are rooted in seeing his family killed by a monster. That of course is what helps lead him onto the path of a monster slayer.

3503543,4,B001C0NMU2,"""Monster Slayer"" is a clever parody of the demon possession films that gripped America in the eighties - films such as Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"" and Lamberto Bava's ""Demons.""  In these features, demons run amok, biting into innocents and turning them into more grotesque demons.  The plots were simple but the gore F/X were complex.  Gratuitous violence ruled the day.  This film is nostalgic for those who enjoyed demonic-type monsters.

  ""Monster Slayer"" stars handsome Trevor Matthews as a young, emotionally disturbed plumber, Jack Brooks.  The film basically chronicles how he became a monster slayer.  It begins with him witnessing his parents and sister being brutally murdered by a hairy, ape-like creature with fangs (a forest troll).  There are also scenes of him as an overly aggressive, abusive football player.  Later, he seeks anger management counseling from a psychiatrist who insists that he confront his fears.

  Jack's chemistry professor (Robert Englund of ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" fame) unearths a crate containing a skeleton and a cursed heart.  (What follows reminds me of ""Alien,"" ""Jason Goes to Hell"" and the more recent ""Slither."")  The heart forces the professor to swallow it.  Soon, he is devouring all food within sight, including the dog.  Eventually, he metamorphoses into a grotesque version of Jabba the Hut with rows of razor-sharp teeth and squid-like tentacles.  This demon monster ensnares most of the students in the professor's class and proceeds to suck out their internal organs.

  The film becomes extremely tense when Jack and his whining girlfriend are trapped in the college hallways and demons are chasing them.  Jack frees his girlfriend but decides to return to his classroom and rescue his friends.  Having learned to face his fears, Jack becomes a monster slayer.  We learn that he is truly caring and kindhearted.  It was his childhood experience of seeing his family butchered that traumatized him and turned him into an angry, rage-filled person.  Becoming a monster slayer helps him to release the rage.

  Through Jack, we learn that all of us have monsters in our past - people, places, and things that have harmed us.  It is best to confront these monsters instead of running from them.  Only then can we be free.

  There have been monster slayers throughout the ages.  One of them was a peasant named Jack who climbed a beanstalk and killed a giant.  Meet Jack Brooks, a simple plumber who kills all types of monsters who terrorize the innocent.  He's a modern hero, and you will love to root for him.

  ""Jack Brooks:  Monster Slayer"" is highly recommended if you're looking for a gory good time.  Robert Englund is delightful to watch as the professor who makes a fool out of himself in front of his classmates.  Dark humor abounds.  There are also some gothic elements involving a cursed house and the secret lying buried in its yard.  Watching ""Monster Slayer"" will help you relive the demon madness of the eighties.",1225152000,,2986,5.002040816326531
3503544,3,B001C0NMU2,"This Canadian import offers something sorely missing in today's big studio films - old fashioned special effects rather than CGI. Therefore I give JACK BROOKS MONSTER SLAYER an ""A"" for effort. It takes guts to do this kind of film these days.

But for execution I have to give it a ""C"".

The story is merely a ripoff of the far superior effects ladden SLITHER. (IF you haven't seen that film, stop reading this and get SLITHER right away!) In JBMS, the jokes mostly fall flat and the rubber monsters tend to look like rubber monsters. Good old fashioned filmmaking doesn't HAVE to look cheap. (Check out FRIGHT NIGHT, ARMY OF DARKNESS, THE LOST BOYS for good examples of pre-CGi films.) The cast is game and do give their all. There is an especially amusing turn by Robert Englund.

For several years now, Jack has been damaging folding chairs, toasters and Chinese egg roll cooks on a regular basis, and his clueless counselor only suggests useless therapies like meditation and yogalates (a combination of yoga and pilates).  Jack's wrath is only aggravated by the constant nagging of his annoying and overbearing girlfriend, Eve, and the boring night school science class she's talked him into taking.  However, the quirky professor of said class, Gordon Crowley, is glad to know this hotheaded (and habitually late) plumber, since the ancient pipes in the spooky old house he's just purchased are hopelessly clogged with sludge.  Unfortunately, Jack's valiant effort to rid Professor Crowley's rusty sinks of the unpleasant brown goo yields nothing but a busted IronMaster 200 valve and a nasty gash to the forehead.  And shortly after young Brooks leaves Watson Road in his clunky white van, the bearded professor and his canine friend, Waldo, are bothered by a mysterious creeping mist from a newly formed hole in the yard.

Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer is a hilariously ridiculous horror comedy with lots of repulsive practical effects and foam latex monsters.  It's a lot of fun, even though there's not as much actual monster slaying as you might expect, since the film is really an origin story.  Hopefully, a sequel will come along soon that will contain action from start to finish.  Although the movie is kind of short, the DVD is loaded with interesting extras that make the disc a very worthwhile purchase.

Robert Englund is becoming the Boris Karloff of modern indie horror cinema and delivers the laughs along with a great characterization.

The hero is a plumber with anger management issues, the villain is played by none-other-than 80's horror icon Robert Englund, and the special-effects are pure, unadulterated monsters suits, latex and goo, all shamelessly 80's-style. This movie has ""cult classic,"" written all over it! So what could go wrong? Unfortunately, a lot.

While this movie certainly has ""that 80's look,"" it doesn't have any of that 80's feel. It's as if they were having so much fun making a retro flick that they forgot movies like ""Evil Dead 2"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" were built around great STORIES, memorable CHARACTERS and slick DIALOGUE. With the exception of Robert Englund and the Jim Henson-style ghoulies, the whole thing just feels utterly phoned in.

The direction and editing are clumsy. The story stumbles along without a purpose. And the actors are practically starving for decent lines. Trevor Matthews (as Jack Brooks) shows some real potential, but the script is so weak, his character has no room for growth, and sadly, by the end of the movie, I could care less about the continuing saga of Jack Brooks The Monster Slayer.

Of course, for fans of Robert Englund, this is a must-see. Although somewhat brief, this is by far his best performance since the Nightmare On Elm Street series. Watching his character's gruesome yet quirky transformation from kindly professor to goo-dripping demon really shows off his talent and is without question, the highlight of the film. Unfortunately once he's finished transforming, the rest of the story just drags along aimlessly without him.

I had such high hopes for this movie. I'm glad at least someone is trying to re-capture that pre-CGI era of campy horror flicks. For that alone, I gave it an extra star. But to be honest, unless you're a hard-core Robert Englund fan, this movie is a rent at best.",1224892800,,1860,4.932907348242812

This isn't exactly movie of the year material, but as direct-to-dvd releases go, I don't know that I've seen much better.  See if you can guess where I would have thrown caution to the wind and had Jack say ""Gimme some sugar, baby!"" had this been my film to make.  It would have rocked.

The dvd has a lot of special features including some very good deleted scenes.  If you love your horror old-school, gooey, and occasionally silly then this is for you.

The special effects are more or less guys in rubber suits and flailing rubber tentacles. It hearkens back to badly made 70's/80's horror movies. Which was maybe the point, maybe not. For me, it did nothing.

Maybe I would have suspended my disbelief if I hadn't watched some of the ""making of"" material BEFORE watching the movie. But I doubt it. Frankly, the ""making of"" featurettes were probably the best part, as they showed the movie-making and prop- / costume-making process. Sadly, the movie was second rate at best. It just wasn't compelling and felt very contrived. The big baddie professor monster looked like a giant puppet (even if I hadn't seen the ""making of,"" I probably would have still thought so).

If the movie didn't take itself so seriously, I'd almost assume it was a spoof of 80's bad horror movies. Perhaps it's best watched in that light (without watching the ""making of"" first)?

There are also a few other cliched characters that are fun to watch and really pull off this campy material. There is the overly emotive sensitive guy, the brainy, nerdy girl, the creepy old guy who warns Jack about the horrors, etc. Robert Englund also puts in a decent performance as a teacher who becomes possessed. The one problem with the film for me was that it took a long time to get to the monster slaying and once there it does not have enough. I was hoping for a Bruce Campbell vs. Zombies kind of thing but it was closer to one guy versus a few people with bad makeup on their faces. This was too bad as I really liked the characters and story but it ended up not amounting to much of anything. I would welcome a sequel with a better budget and more focus on monster slaying. All in all it is definetly worth checking out but don't get your hopes up for something great.",1224806400,,1240,4.258474576271187
3503551,3,B001C0NMU2,"Basically, Jack Brooks Monster Slayer is all set-up with only a pinch of execution. The film is only 85 minutes and most of that is spent with Jack (Trevor Matthews) in therapy, night school, or arguing with his girlfriend (Rachel Skarsten). I did enjoy Robert Englund as Professor Crowley. He plays the lonely old science teacher to perfection. I also got a kick out of the monster slaying once Jack found a way to manage his anger but it's over shortly after it begins. I guess we're locked in for the sequel now. With the backstory out of the way, we should see a lot more slaying. Jack might even become the next big thing in the horror genre.",1224633600,,647,4.445378151260504
3503552,2,B001C0NMU2,"Lately it seems Horror has gone nostalgic. Not in just the sense that every classic film of the genre has been through the ""remake treatment"" as of late, but new filmmakers brought up on those original classics wish it still was 1985 and make a movie today just like they did. Such is the case of Jack Brooks:Monster Slayer. But even though with the classic approach of a world where CGI didn't exist and rubber latex ruled, they may have forgotten that a good story to begin with should be the first thing in place.

Jack Brooks is a twenty-something whose life pretty much stinks. A plumber by day and a night-school student at night, he's a young man who has a serious attitude problem in the sense that he's full of rage and can't seem to understand why. Maybe it might have to do with the fact his family was killed by a forest troll(?) and no one believed him at the time. Or could it be he has a girlfriend who's always on his back. Whatever the case, life's not too good. One evening after class his professor (mercifully played by Robert Englund) asks him to come to his new, yet rumored cursed, home and look at his pipes (the house's that is). After a pipe blows in the backyard, a strange gas and crate are discovered after Jack's departure and the ole Professor starts to turn slowly into something not of this Earth. When picking up a plumbing part, Jack gets a full history lesson of the house from a former resident, gets back to school, and all Hell breaks loose.

Well, as much Hell as this story could allow. As a huge fan of what I consider the modern-day classic era of Horror, the 1980's, I can see that the writer/star & director of this film were as well. But what their film provided sort of reminded me of those ""made eventually for cable Horror"" like the works released by Full Moon Entertainment between 1989 thru 1992. While these films had decent practical special-effects, each one had a storyline that would be forgotten once your finger pressed eject on the old VCR. Much the same for JB:MS. The plotline that Jack is a passive-aggressive weighed down the whole film for me in the sense that it wasn't used well or was ever really needed. In fact, Jack really isn't even a likeable guy, bordering on just plain irritating. You won't love to hate him, you just won't care for him in general. And that's pretty much what we get for the first full hour of the film. Those who think they're getting a modern-day Evil Dead of a thrill-ride with this better take a nap first before watching. As for Englund's slow transformation, it does have a slight humor and disgust but not enough to really count on either to save the film. And when the baddies start coming, Jack still provides as much entertainment as the backgrounds behind him, he's there, he's doing stuff, but it's bland and unsatifying at this point.

But what really got me was a film that was as lackluster as this got an amazing amount of love through a ton of special features. It might be hard to believe, but not only does it have the typical commentary and trailers, but over TWO HOURS of documentaries, deleted scenes, and other featurettes that explain the film in great detail. In fact, I enjoyed these more than the movie itself! Hard to believe this was all packed on just one disc that had a nice video/audio presentation. But when you get down to it, Jack Brooks:Monster Slayer is forgettable. While trying to hark back to the 80's with it's latex effects and huge props, it's story, supporting cast, and lead actor all fail to deliver an engaging film. This is not your Evil Dead twenty-somethings, and if it is, you guys need to rent/buy 2006's Hatchet. Now there's a film that looked at the Horror of the 80's and said ""Thank You"" without chopping up it's legacy.

3503553,1,B001C0NMU2,"I bought this movie because it sounded like a good movie to enjoy and because I had been reading that several people had likened it to the ""Evil Dead"" set of movies.  First, this movie was BAD and mean BAD in the terrible way.  I guess my take on the ""Evil Dead"" series was a little different than the comments that I read.  The amount of foul language in the movie was astonishing.  The f%@k word was used in almost every sentence.  I know, or better yet, believe, that a good monster movie can be made with out all the trashy language.  A few well chosen sentence enhancers is very appropriate, but this was just plain awful.  I bought the movie so now I have to live with it, but I doubt that I watch it again until I have forgotten how bad it is.  I can not recommend this movie for any one.  Thanks.",1224028800,4,804,4.135483870967742
3503554,4,B001C0NMU2,"Im very happy for Robert Englund. He made a very good decision to accept
the role presented to him for this film. It did wonders for the film and
has re-introduced us to his acting which is very very good. By having him
around, im sure it also helped others actor/actresses in the film to bring
up their standards which resulted in better acting for everyone.... For
the budget they had, they sure made a great little film with monsters
and flesh eaters and.....you ll have to see for yourself.  Im sure if
they had more money they would have made it longer and would have made
the african scene better....  A Keeper.",1223942400,,617,4.451327433628318

If you love movies like Evil Dead and Army of Darkness then you are going to love Jack Brooks Monster Slayer. Witty and gory and all around good fun the cast is perfect the story is clever what more do you want from a monster movie!
