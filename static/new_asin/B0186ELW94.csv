8741587,3,B0186ELW94,"This PPV is part of the second season of the ""TNA: One Night Only"" series which are just stand alone PPV events with Mike Tenay & Taz doing commentary on this show.  Now this show featured the PPV return of the six sided ring to TNA for the first time since 2009 while showing pre-match highlights of either what was considered the ""turning point"" of each superstar's career or highlights of the previous feud between the two wrestlers.

Samoa Joe vs. Kenny King - Joe was able to keep knocking King down early on before King was finally able to catch Joe off his feet only to keep showing off & trying to upstage Joe to no avail with Joe continuing to keep striking King down as both men traded momentum with King being able to keep avoiding the muscle buster & using his athletic ability for offense such as a springboard neckbreaker while Joe relied on his power & size to his advantage catching King.

Gail Kim vs. Madison Rayne vs. Angelina Love - Love's past history with both women made her the odd woman out early on until an opportunity came for one of the opponents to win the match once again making it ""every woman for herself"" as all three girls attempted to use the strategy of ""divide & conquer"" eliminating one girl of out the ring so she can concentrate on her other opponent one on one while taking advantage of any situation on the other such as one knocking having the other in a leg scissors only to be put into a legged full nelson herself by the third opponent causing Taz to use the line of the night, ""that's one hot worm"" in a solid contest.

Austin Aries vs. Great Sanada - The top feud X Division feud in 2014 revisited her under different circumstances with Sanada being part of The Revolution with James Storm in his corner as both men attempted different strategy throughout the match with Aries keeping a fast pace using his athleticism to deliver aerial offense & various dropkicks from different positions only for Sanada slowed down the pace using illegal tactics & grounding Aries while continuing to stay one step ahead using Aries' own momentum against him at one point in a back & forth contest but different than their previous encounters.

Mr. Anderson & Gunner vs. Ethan Carter III & Rockstar Spud - Spud was clearly out of his league against both men from the start & he knew it was his offense had no effect on either man & trying to hype himself up bouncing his head off the turnbuckles like Gunner only for him to knock himself out causing him to tag out whenever he got in the slightest bit of trouble causing EC3 to take control for a bit using Spud to his advantage while trying to isolate one opponent from his partner but this match was all about the constant miscommunication with between EC3 & Spud causing them to get physical with each other before one finally just said ""enough.""

Eric Young vs. Magnus - This match was based off their TNA Championship series earlier in the year as Young played some comedic mind games with Magnus allowing him to keep catching him & stay in control with the same offensive maneuver while Magnus used the ringside environment in a creative way to finally catch Young keeping him grounded & stopping his momentum dead in his tracks such as catching him in mid-air with a strong strike and a pretty basic average match.

Monster's Ball: Abyss vs. Bram - Another feud from the past year revisited as the fight started on the outside with the steel steps coming into play in the early moments before they started exchanging shots with various weapons such as a trash can & chair & kendo stick over all parts of their body along with others such as a table in what was pretty much a slow paced brawl.

Bobby Roode vs. James Storm - Their long time feud revisited once again but under different circumstances with Storm now the leader of The Revolution while Roode had the fan support on his side as this match went to the floor very quickly with the ringside environment coming into play before Storm was able to slow the pace down focusing on the head & neck area while Roode was working more aggressive as they continued to trade momentum using their signature moves in a solid contest but a step down from their previous contest.

Jeff Hardy vs. M.V.P. - M.V.P. makes his ""One Night Only"" debut while having a moment with Jeremy Borash at ringside that was a throwback to another ""bad guy"" while continuing to just taunt the fans at ringside before showing up Hardy early letting him know ""you can beat me flying but you can't beat me wrestling"" only for Hardy to show him up in return causing M.V.P. to heavily stall causing Hardy to take the fight to him in & outside of the ring as they traded momentum with M.V.P. trying to take advantage of any situation he could while keeping Hardy grounded while Hardy continued to wrestle his high risk daredevil style in what was the match of the night.

This was one of those events that didn't have a bad unwatchable match on it as there was some average & solid wrestling but didn't have a match that was very memorable or worth going out of your way to watch.",1448323200,,5094,4.485436893203883
