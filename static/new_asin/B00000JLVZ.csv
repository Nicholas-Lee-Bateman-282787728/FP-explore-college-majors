1234264,5,B00000JLVZ,"I have always believed that Linda Purl was highly under-rated as a talented actress. This story is touching and meaningful. I was delighted to learn that it is now available on DVD and it will tuck neatly into my sisters' Christmas Stocking. Now, if only the original ""Young Pioneers"" joins it, I will be very happy as the VHS is fragile at best.",1349222400,4,346,4.507936507936508

1234267,5,B00000JLVZ,"I saw this movie on T.V. last year and I have been trying to locate a copy on video so that I can use it as a family teaching tool.  Every year we get  so caught up in the materialism of Christmas and we sometimes forget just  how blessed we really are.  The young pioneer family in this movie shows  how love conquers all and that we should be joyous and thankful for all  that God gives us, all throughout the year.  It really changed my attitude  towards the whole gift-giving process; We should all give and receive from  the heart and not be concerned about monetary value.  I highly recommend  this movie for families every where!  God Bless...",941500800,83,650,4.369747899159663

1234296,5,B00000JLVZ,This is a good family movie from the 1970's. My wife had this on VHS which she had recorded a long time ago. She had enjoyed it so I bought the DVD for her as a Christmas gift.  This movie is about a young couples struggles on the prairie and their dealing with a loss of a child.

1234315,4,B00000JLVZ,"This is a continuation of the Young Pioneers.  The beginning was so sad.  You feel the pain throughout the movie.  But it also shows the human spirit and how we must go on no matter what the circumstances.  Life is not easy no matter what time period we live in.  Good and bad happen to all people.  It also shows the importance of friends sticking together through thick and thin.  Once again this is a ""B"" movie, but excellently done.  It is a clean movie worth watching with the family with possibly a discussion afterwards.",1438992000,,527,4.473684210526316

1234355,5,B00000JLVZ,"I watched this years ago in the mid 70s on TV. It had been so long ago that I didn't remember the plot. What I did remember was that I really enjoyed it.  I found it here on Amazon and could not resist. I anxiously awaited for it to arrive. I am anything but disappointed.  This was written by the daughter of Laura Ingells Wilder, so it has a Little House on the Prairie flavor to it.  This I am sure would be a very welcome addition to any Christmas movie collection.  While you are at it get the Young Pioneers movie. It is equally as good if not better.  Merry Christmas",1416873600,,574,4.089285714285714

1234396,3,B00000JLVZ,"Thought today's children could benefit from watching what life was like during the frontier days of our country.  The story line was good and did express the hardships of those times along with the simple life, family love and dedication, care for one another within their communities.  However, the video quality was quite poor; colors way off, especially skin color. It would go from bad to worse then bad again.  Really detracted from the good story.  Thankfully didn't pay too much for it.  Rather think my grandchildren will skip over this for viewing again in favor of one that is better produced.",1393113600,2,603,4.872549019607843

1234398,4,B00000JLVZ,"I would categorize this movie along the lines of ""Little House on the Prairie.""  Very simple story and acting.  A clean movie.  The cover, however, is deceiving.

1234399,5,B00000JLVZ,"This movie was good.  I enjoyed every bit of it.  It was not the usual cheesy Christmas movie although the ending takes place at Christmas.

It's a great story of the simplicity of the pioneer days, and in spite of huge obstacles, how the human spirit can carry us through.  It makes us realize what a blessing we can still be when we give something from our heart instead of just ordering a gift over the internet and putting it in a gift bag.  We would really like to see the first Young Pioneers movie on DVD but so far have only seen the VHS version available.",1362009600,10,572,4.04424778761062

1234470,4,B00000JLVZ,"I bought this after my husband and I watched the first Young Pioneers movie. We enjoyed it a lot (even though I find Davey to be the most irritating male character ever created) and I was thrilled to find out that there was a second movie. But, I didn't care for this movie as much as I did the first. I mean, it was good and I still recommend it, but there were a few things I didn't care for. For one, I still feel like the movies should have continued. When the first one ended, I was ready for the second. Once the second one ended, I was ready to watch the third. But, of course, there isn't a third movie. It frustrates me because things are still left open for so many of the characters and I want to know the rest of their story! And they changed one of the actresses (I'm sorry, I don't remember the characters name, but you'll notice if you watch the movie). The story also deals with a lot of emotional issues--loss, poverty, feeling inadequate, etc. so it was kind of a downer. But, it's still a decent movie and worth watching if you enjoyed the first one. Oh! And just a random piece of information--there is no dog in the movie. There is a dog on the front cover but I have no idea why. But I guess that doesn't really matter unless you're looking for a movie with a dog in it.",1359244800,2,1292,4.130952380952381
1234471,5,B00000JLVZ,"Set in a simpler and rougher time.  Life was hard work, broken dreams, premature deaths, and bitter disappointments.  Material possessions were few.  But people developed such strong characters, and such appreciation for simple things.  I think of most pioneers as heros, not many people today would work that hard for such a small reward.  A Christmas movie about giving sacrifically from the heart.  I have always loved this film.",1359158400,,432,5.188405797101449
1234472,3,B00000JLVZ,I am not sure I would recomend this for the whole family. It is  a little too dramatic for younger kids.,1358726400,,104,3.9523809523809526
1234473,4,B00000JLVZ,"A really enjoyable Christmas movie suitable for family viewing.  The story was written by Rose Wilder Lane (Laura Ingalls Wilder's daughter) along the same lines as the Little House books.  The film is well acted and very emotional - a real tear jerker - and follows on from the first story of The Young Pioneers (by the way why is the original film not available) when the young couple were married and first moved out west when they were aged only 16 & 18 years old.  This second part of the series continues on their story and shows the hardships people endured during this time and how neighbours all helped each other out sharing what little they had.  Can you imagine many people doing this now in this age of greed, greed and more greed?",1358640000,18,744,4.488888888888889

1234478,1,B00000JLVZ,This is obviously a very old movie.  the color was bad and the film moved constantly where you felt like you had missed most of the movie as it was a blur on the TV and all other movies play fine.  So I don't know if movie if defective or just bad.  I bought so I opened it and played it so now I am stuck with a worthless piece of junk.,1358294400,2,337,3.6527777777777777
