The ""Lonely Club"" is a  fictional group of kids who, with the help of an adult supervisor, form a  club after they are rejected by others.  Other kids see how much fun they  are having and they want to join in too.  Since one of the rules in the  club is ""You're always welcome,"" everybody that wants to join in does and  the fun begins. Within this dramatic framework, the kids learn valuable  life skills through realistic scenes and six original songs presented in  music video format, including high quality animation.
My children want  to play this program over and over, and enjoy learning the songs.  Musically, this is sonethimg that adults can enjoy listening to with their  kids.
