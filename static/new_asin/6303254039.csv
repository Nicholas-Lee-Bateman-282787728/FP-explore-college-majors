614364,5,6303254039,"Ignore the cheesy title - David Hartwell has delivered a powerhouse of a suspense.

Granted, the performances are dated, (Eric Roberts and Kelly Preston have definitely honed their skills more since this film was made.) However, watch the movie through to the end at least once...have a little faith.

With its refreshingly twisted plot, ""Love Is A Gun"" restores my faith in the modern suspense.",973296000,4,395,5.061538461538461
614365,5,6303254039,"This movie is, quite possibly, the best movie ever made...I mean, there is a lot to say for some of the classics, but I have never sat on the edge of my seat for so long.  After watching this movie half a dozen times, I still  can not get enough!",939081600,8,246,3.9
7842330,5,6303254039,"I don't know how to review this film. I just know I couldn't stop watching it and was exhausted when it ended. Who did it? What did they do? when did they do it? Are we living in a never-ending dream with Jack? Is his life going in a big loop?  It's just hard to say. There were times when I laughed out loud and times when I had to rewind the film to make sure I thought what had happened. did.

Great acting all around. The actors chosen for their characters couldn't have been better. Eric is over the top crazy and the two women are made to be great enemies. The job Jack does is enough to cause mental instability (police photographer) and Jack is open to weirdness. The ending is just perfect. Here we go again!",1524182400,,717,4.151079136690647
7842331,2,6303254039,"I found the three main protagonists very annoying, especially Roberts who acted like a huge twit, so much so that I quit watching after about 1/2 of the film. Looking back now I should have quit much sooner. Why watch such losers, if you want to be entertained?",1514419200,,261,4.458333333333333
7842332,5,6303254039,"Eric Roberts has been stereotyped into playing the weird, strange, freaky guy.  And this movie was probably the one that gave him the reputation.

Its a great movie; Kelly Preston, John Travoltas wife, was hot, crazy hot.  Definitely a must watch old 90s movie.",1514246400,,261,4.886363636363637
7842333,5,6303254039,"Trippy & eccentric, LOVE IS A GUN delivers. Eric Roberts is at his scenery chewing best, and the rest of the cast rises to the occasion. The direction, editing and screenplay are tight. There are no holes or inconsistencies. (Either that, or suspension of disbelief was in full sway.) And the balancing act tone of the film, blending drama, thriller, and (often biting) humor encased in irony is a wonder to behold. (In that regard it could be seen as a precursor to FIGHT CLUB.) Like every other hype term, ""cult movie"" no longer has any real credibility. But, if it did, LOVE IS A GUN would be on the short list.",1483574400,,614,4.491071428571429

7842335,5,6303254039,Not bad. But it takes some patience to get through all the kinky and weird stuff. Should be a classic of some kind.,1453766400,,115,4.043478260869565

7842338,2,6303254039,Ok...this movie is unremarkable and Kelly Preston probably wished no one remembers this movie. But Kelly Preston is super hot and just so beautiful on camera. She is the only reason worth watching...and yes she is strips baked in this movie.,1339113600,2,241,4.902439024390244
