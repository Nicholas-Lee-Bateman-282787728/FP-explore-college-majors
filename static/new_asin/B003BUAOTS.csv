4107415,1,B003BUAOTS,"No Sound!!! As there seems to be no way to make a request for a refund regarding a video, I am writing it here in the hope that someone from Amazon will read it and take an action. Similar things have happened previously(e.g. billing me for a Prime 00.00 video). I have rated this item with one star because you cannot enter a review without a rating. Obviously, I would not have entered any stars were it not required.",1377907200,5,419,4.3164556962025316

8393920,5,B003BUAOTS,I am not usually fond of documentaries but this historical rendition of Jane Austen's life seemed to be more interesting that I usually find biographies.  I guess I am just a Jan Austenoholic.,1401235200,2,192,4.818181818181818
8393921,1,B003BUAOTS,"boring, poorly done, not very informative.  I wish I had paid attention to the rating before renting it.  Not even worth $1.99",1393459200,,126,4.681818181818182
8393922,3,B003BUAOTS,"The narrator became annoying; everything began to be delightful. About half of the presentation is spent on the various locations Miss Austen lived and her family (brothers and sister).  The presentation then goes forward to tie Miss Austen's real life to the stories and characters she developed and shared.  Overall, it is about average for a biography.",1392422400,,355,5.2105263157894735
8393923,5,B003BUAOTS,This short and delicate biographical sketch of Jane Austin did for me what I had hoped it would.  It introduced me to the real Jane Austin and the events in her life that shaped her into the beloved authoress that she is.  Highly recommend watching it if you consider yourself to be a Jane Austin fan!,1386374400,2,301,4.357142857142857
