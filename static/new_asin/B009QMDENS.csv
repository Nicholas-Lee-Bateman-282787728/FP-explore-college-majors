It is a very good movie in English LCPM Stereo 2.0 and includes all the spectacle you would expect.  This is Rome 79 AD and Pompeii was a city of the rich located in Southern Italy.  Intrigue, Gladiator fights, persecuting the Christians, forbidden love this Pompeii has it all.  The Blu-ray includes both parts 1 and 2 for a running time of 191 minutes.

 The video was very good lots of colors with good detail and depth.  Audio was excellent subwoffer adding deep bass during the mountain eruptions, gladiator fights and other action scenes. If you like movies of the Roman Empire you will like Pompeii.",1396051200,,684,4.745762711864407
