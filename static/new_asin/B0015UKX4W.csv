8259995,5,B0015UKX4W,"The previous reviewer hit it on the head. But, I must say that the humour, although aimed at adults, is absolutely right on target. ITV hit it on the head with the main crew....Robson Green, and Maggie O'Neill are wonderul. But, full credit must be given to Joseph Friend (Ollie), who stole the show....hope to see him in more flicks.",1266364800,2,334,4.583333333333333
8259996,5,B0015UKX4W,"The cover of this DVD makes it look like a family film.  Definitely not.  It's a comedy/drama about marriage woes. A small amount of salty language and mature topics makes it inappropriate for children, but would only offend a very, very prudish adult.

Two British couples are best friends.  Couple A, Will & Laura, are solid citizen types, whose life is just a little boring.  Will is a head teacher, which is a high school principal to us Americans.  Laura has just returned to work after having three kids. She's working for Adrian, the husband in couple B.  Adrian (James Wilby) is gorgeous, very charming, and an immature louse. He's the kind of man we women find devastatingly attractive, but wouldn't really want to be married to him.  Adrian is married to Katie,an off the wall firebrand.  Katie divides her time between drinking and coming up with plots to make the philandering Adrian's life miserable, such as making pinholes in his condoms.

As the movie opens we learn that Laura has succumbed to Adrians considerable charms, but now regrets the affair.  Of course, it's not long before Katie discovers the affair, both couples separate, and the fun begins.  Will they switch partners?  Will they both divorce?  Will they reconcile?  Both couples have a ten year old child.  The children naturally want their parents to stay in the marriages, so they engage in amusing plots to force the parents together, such as feigning eating disorders, pretending to be seriously disturbed, etc.  This is all presented in a light-hearted, comedic way.

This movie isn't going to win any Oscars, but it is amusing and entertaining.  After seeing Wilby playing heroes in serious films like Maurice, A Tale of Two Cities, and other weighty, Masterpiece Theater-ish projects, it's fun to see him playing a naughty boy in a comedy.",1211414400,8,1828,4.915032679738562
