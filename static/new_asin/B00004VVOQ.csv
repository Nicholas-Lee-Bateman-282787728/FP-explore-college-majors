1357862,3,B00004VVOQ,"Loosely based on the PC game (a pretty good game), Sin is the story of a cop in the future who stumbles upon a plot by an evil scientist to turn everybody into monsters. Why? Because that's what evil scientists do dummy! And of course they are after an innocent little girl too since they are always the ""key to their master plan"".
  The animation is a fair, the violence is nice and gory (I liked the monsters) but Sin is missing something. It has that ""rushed out the door"" feel. It is a very by-the-numbers piece of Anime, very little substance to it.",984441600,8,554,4.3173076923076925
1357863,2,B00004VVOQ,"Based on the PC game, Sin is the story of Blade who helps a girl. This movie looked really good, but then came the defaults. First off, the guy known as JC dies and is then replaced with his sister uncleverly named JC. Then the CG. The CG isn't horrible like Panzer Dragoon, but I can tell these guys weren't taking notes on the CG in Cowboy Bebop or Blue Sub No. 6. Even the 2D animation is horrible. And then theres the story. The story goes fairly well until the ending. This is the worst ending I have ever scene in an anime and I've seen a lot. The only reason I gave Sin 2 stars instead of one is for the dub, which brilliantly done, but doesn't make up for the laging story and bad animation. Fans of the PC game might get a mild kick out of it, but otaku won't. Avoid this one like the plaque.",980380800,,801,4.0125
1357864,1,B00004VVOQ,"I am an avid fan of anime and manga, and this is (by FAR) the worst attempt at animated film-making I have ever seen. It seems as though the producers got together and said,""Hey, let's combine cell animation and computer graphics and make some kinda movie! Yeah, it'll have neato pictures!"" And the result is this abomination.  The voice-overs are laughable, the animation is average, and the plot is thinner than ... I wasted [money] on this movie ... and sincerely hope that you will spend your money more wisely. (Look to Rurouni Kenshin/Samurai X or Escaflowne for real quality)",978393600,,582,4.82
1357865,5,B00004VVOQ,"Wow!  I have had my copy of Sin for over two months now, and I must say that I love this movie.  The anime movie recreates the actual world of Sin right down to the emblem on Blade's handguns.  Lots of cool features are included on the DVD to boot.  I can not stress enough how awesome this is, if you are looking for a great shoot-em-up movie, this one ranks right up there.",978307200,2,375,4.027027027027027
1357866,4,B00004VVOQ,I really enjoyed the anime.  I read the other reviews and I bought it .  This is an excellent DVD and I can't say anymore you have to get it.  Final Criticism: Story line: Good/ Animation: Good/ Overall: Excellent,976924800,2,213,4.410256410256411
1357867,4,B00004VVOQ,"Being a big fan of the game, I was both excited and a bit worried about the movie.  As I've found over the past few years, video games don't often translate well into movies.  They seem to skim through most of the good characters to focus on a few.  Since the game SIN has only a handful of characters anyway, this wasn't a problem.  The animation was well done, the action was cool, and the story was interesting, though a bit generic for an anime title (super-genetic mutants try to take over the world...pick a movie).  They could have done a better job on the ""extras"".  Not much by way art and original game art.  Instead, the DVD is full of interviews with the movie makers telling you what a good job they did.  Interviews with the game makers telling you what a good job the movie makers did.  There are even a few interviews with the movie's voice actors telling you about what a good job THEY did.  I would have to say at this point that they did a really good job on the English dub...it's about time.  The voice-overs were pretty strong this time instead of being dopey like they are in most dubs.  Basically, if I could change anything it would be this:  1.  Show more artwork from both the movie and the game.  More ""behind the scenes"" stuff would have been good. (forgive me if it's there and I missed it)  2.  ""Movies"" aren't 60 minutes...  3.  Try and stay true to the original characters.  The Alexis Sinclaire that we know and love from the game just looked like a typical anime babe.  I know that's the genre's style and all, but I will be upset if RITUAL runs with it and turns her into a typical anime babe in SIN 2.  Now having said all that, it was a great DVD and I'm glad I bought it.",972950400,5,1710,4.2291021671826625
1357868,5,B00004VVOQ,"Sin: The Movie is one of the only anime that not only lives up to the hype surrounding its release, but surpasses it.  This movie is filled with non-stop action, drama, intrigue, and suspense.  The characters are fantastically portrayed and so *real*.  This is easily a 5 star anime.  I highly recommend buying it and adding it to your collection.",969840000,5,347,4.733333333333333
1357869,3,B00004VVOQ,First I tought the game was great but the movie.  It was all condenced into about 60 minutes.  the story went by quick.  But there is a lOT of  action in it.,967334400,,157,3.8125
7924151,5,B00004VVOQ,Item arrived in good condition I had this anime on video tape. It give a behind the scenes features which I like good anime,1514160000,,123,4.166666666666667
7924152,4,B00004VVOQ,Not a bad anime movie. Can't relate since I got the one from the middle of something...since its not the first one of the series. Great action scene of the monsters and how it is put to rest...sort of speak...permanently.,1414022400,,221,4.55
7924153,2,B00004VVOQ,"After playing the game, I was very interested to see how the characters and storyline would play out in a film.  However, while this movie was watchable and had some nice bits of animation, it was a bit of a letdown.  The first sin is killing off one of the most important main characters in a truly idiotic fashion 5 minutes into the movie.  The second sin is ruining the relationship between Elexis and Blade, which was the core of the plotline in the original game.  The third sin is replacing the original voice actors with subpar imitators.

But the biggest sin is how rushed this anime is.  The runtime is only a scant 54 minutes, putting it closer to a tv episode than a feature film in terms of length.  Exacerbating the problem is that the creators are trying to tell a huge story, delving deep into the backgrounds of a large cast of characters while dealing with a massive threat.  This story, although good, would have been much better told in a 3-hour epic than a 54-minute episode.  As it is, the movie whips along so fast that the viewer is not given any time to appreciate the characters or the plotline before the movie abruptly ends.  There are so many parts that could have been really good if they were fleshed out with just a little more time, but as it is it's a mess.  Unfortunately for this reason I can't recommend it.",1404950400,,1343,4.41869918699187
7924154,5,B00004VVOQ,"This is not a bad anime, the only thing is that it's too short. It would be nice if it could be a little longer, considering its based on a video game. But I thought it was good.",1325462400,,178,3.710526315789474
7924155,4,B00004VVOQ,"Virtually every element is constructed out of cliches, bad ideas and nonsensical elements that fall apart given a moment's thought.

The animation is full of mistaken perspectives, bad attempts at cheating costs and wind that'll ruffle one character's hair but nothing else.

This is the kind of film that is best enjoyed if you love to be overcritical. There's so much here to pick apart and make fun of that it's actually quite entertaining. The over the top voice-acting, the acting on the animation and the plot are all terrible but they are remarkably so.

Perhaps the best part is that there is a special feature on the disc featuring interviews witht he various people involved in creating this. They love it and are enthusiastic about their creation. It's really kind of bizzare to see people so in love with something so bad.

I really enjoyed it but I don't think it'll have a very broad appeal. If you like to make fun of movies, then this is a real gem.",1172620800,,965,4.625730994152047
7924156,4,B00004VVOQ,I reccommend this to anyone who likes anime.  I have seen this movie but I don't own it.  This was a gift to my boyfriend.,1166659200,,122,3.84
7924157,2,B00004VVOQ,"I bought this anime years ago, and I'm still unsure of what to think about it. It was one of the first anime I ever bought for my shiny new DVD player, and I've only watched it twice since that time.

The story itself is of a cop named John Blade who recently lost his partner to a strange, biochemically enhanced monster. Now, he must seek out the few clues to his partner's death while also dealing with the kidnappings of young girls. Joining him is the beautiful sister of the dead partner. Together, as they fight off the biochemical golems, they discover that a woman known as Alexis Sinclaire is responsible for these creatures. Essentially, Sin is a Frankenstein story, as the creatures are very similar in design, only these golems are placed in the 21st century with a very clear mission, which is to kill.

Now, I know it's not the animation I don't like about it. That's pretty good, with the exception of some of the CG, which is bad at times. What I think, now that I'm writing this, is that nothing here is unique in any form of entertainment. The characters are walking cliches (tough cop, victim of the antagonist, and overlord-like bad guy). The story, though it has some unique elements to it, can be seen in bad American horror movies. It just isn't something that has to be seen.

With that said, I can't truly recommend this title. It brings nothing to anime, and compares to just about anything, whether it's an anime or American movies.",1137456000,7,1460,4.5437262357414445
7924158,3,B00004VVOQ,"Summary: good guy tries to stop evil scientist's mutants. The main feature of Sin was gore and violence. There was a clear plot to the film but constant killing and destruction forces that to the back of your mind, making you focus in a visual aspects. After watching you wish I wish I had known more about most of the characters backgrounds (especially the little girl who everyone wanted to capture). If only ADV extended 30 minutes to provide the information, to give the characters more personality instead of portraying them as either cruel, innocent, strong and/or rebelious, this movie would have much more appeal I give it a 3.",1124928000,,635,4.781818181818182
7924159,4,B00004VVOQ,"Ok, so it isn't Vampire Hunter D, Akira, Wicked City, or the like, then again, this isn't the 80's, and not EVERY anime is going to be a classic anymore. It's grown into a huge industry, and not there us just a LOT more, and with all things such as Hollywood and the Music Industry, concepts and aspects begin to be used like jig-saw puzzle pieces, and you'll begin to see movies that barrow concepts from other Anime's to tell it's tell. Not everyone is a Katsuhiro tomo, get over it. What IS important, is the story. The character developement, the gore, the drama, the action, and quality anime. In ALL of these departments it does VERY well. Granted, it had a few cheesey moments, but I'd say that 96% of the film was enjoyable, and moved right along without boring me.

 Matter of fact, for those of you who have beat the game, fear not, they change things around in the story so it's an all new experience.

 Anyhow, check it out, it ain't too bad, definatly worth at least $8.00. PLENTY of GORE, for all your Fangoria fanatics. :)",1121731200,,1037,4.4136125654450264
7924160,1,B00004VVOQ,"Go on folks, nothing to see here. The animation is losey and the characters are weak. I've never seen choppier animetion and hope I never do again. It's like they tried to rush job the ending to get it over with and really leaves the audience upset. There is also, which destroys a lot of anime, a lack of explanation to some things and throws you off even more. Do yourself a favor and move on to the next. Sin is exactly that. Spend 25 bucks on something better.",984528000,5,464,4.224719101123595
