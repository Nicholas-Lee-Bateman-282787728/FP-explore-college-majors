Supposedly Charles Bronson and his sidekick are mercenaries there to help out on the moving of precious cargo, the governor's three teenage daughters and a lot of jewels.  There's plenty of mishap and misunderstanding and snide remarks and random shootings that remarkably don't hit anyone.  The two soldiers of fortune are aiming for big money if they can help out.

I have been to turkey for one month in august 1985.  It was hot hot hot.  Full of ruins and men with moustaches, women in scarves, men addicted to cigarettes, plenty of folks who could speak some German, lots of Moustafas following us down the street and propositioning us, cheap lodgings and good food and long distance Mercedes buses with blasting Turkish hits for hours at a time.

So I loved looking at the scenery and remembering all the crazy things that happened to us two girls with backpacks.

Will you if you have no interest in Turkey!?  You will see ancient ruins and the weird rocks of Cappadacio, old shuttered villages.  It was filmed with a big cast and old costumes in 1970.  Men on horseback and plenty of fighting.... sometimes I thought of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby on the road to  Moracco.

So yes it is an action film for manly men.

But it has humor and near romance and plenty of visual treats for the armchair traveller.  I saw it on a late night movie channel. Buy a carpet and fly there!.",1492732800,,1649,4.523648648648648

8426773,2,B004ECLFUY,"Bronson and Tony Curtis in a war movie together? Sounds good in theory but in execution it's a poor movie. Set during the Turkish War for Independence, it's full of anachronisms: flags of several of the Allies are on display in a cantina including Canada's Maple Leaf Flag... which won't be adopted until the 1960s. In another scene a mercenary refers to having enough ammunition to start World War II, with the Great War barely finished. And a U.S. Marine is shown later wearing a ribbon for the Purple Heart Medal... which was not reinstituted until the 1930s.

The Turkish War For Independence (also known as the Turkish Civil War) came about from the defeat of the Ottoman Empire and the establishment of the Turkish Republic by Kemal Ataturk. The remnants of the Sultan's forces were assisted in their attempts to subdue Ataturk by the Allies (especially the Greeks), who just a short time before had been fighting AGAINST the Ottomans when they were one of the Central Powers.

Bronson leads a ragtag group of mercenaries composed of former soldiers of the Great War and Tony Curtis as some guy who is just tagging along. Bronson agrees to help the Ottomans and their Greek allies against the Turkish Republic. The story from there becomes complicated due to the torturous scheming of the Ottomans (and the mercenaries). As a war movie I suppose it's not that bad but seems to lack something.",1415664000,2,1398,4.796680497925311
8426774,3,B004ECLFUY,"You Can't Win `Em All aka Soldiers of Fortune comes from the time when the studios were looking ever further East to save money while still getting some spectacle for their buck. With Spain and Italy increasingly expensive and the Soviet Union a bureaucratic nightmare, Turkey must have seemed like a good idea at the time for this riff on Vera Cruz that plants Charles Bronson's mercenary and Tony Curtis not-entirely-disillusioned adventurer (""I lost everything in a big war, maybe I can get some of it back in a small one"") in the dying days of the Ottoman Empire and working for the wrong side ostensibly escorting Turkish Bey Gregoire Aslan's daughters and a shipment of gold to safety. Naturally things aren't that simple and with everyone out for themselves they have as much to worry about from their `allies' - Fikret Hakan's colonel and Michele Mercier's mystery woman - as the rebels. There are few surprises and leading men aside it's short on starpower (fourth-billed Patrick Magee is hardly in the film for as many minutes), but director Peter Collinson delivers the action efficiently enough and at times the film looks like one of the more spectacular spaghetti westerns even if the film never really rises above the level of an acceptable second feature on the wrong half of a double-bill.

Sadly the PAL DVD currently available is a Spanish release of dubious origin which, while 2.35:1 widescreen, isn't a great transfer, but it does have an English soundtrack and is currently the only version available.",1366588800,5,1524,4.929961089494164
