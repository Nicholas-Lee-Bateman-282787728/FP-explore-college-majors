1402407,5,B000057KCX,"I thoroughly enjoyed this superb movie with Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine, it was lots of fun, fast paced and well written.  Agree the chemistry and interaction was great, it was a terrific 60s movie, well worth watching, definitely a winner.

1402408,5,B000057KCX,This film makes me laugh hard whenever I watch it. Shirley's assertiveness and Dino's macho charms seem to spark fireworks throughout the comedy. Jack Weston is perfect in the part of the detective and Cliff Robertson is a hilarious choice for a veterinarian. Shirley and Dino rank up at the top of my list of most sexy screen couples along with Bogart and Bacall or Gable and Lombard. Many a junior high afternoon was spent watching it over to see if 'all' of Shirley might be showing under her towel.,1226188800,,502,4.588888888888889
1402409,5,B000057KCX,"This movie is absolutely adorable.  Dean is always wonderful to watch and he is perfect as the rich playboy.  Shirley Maclaine is wonderful to watch as well.  All in all, it is a great movie to watch with several recognizable supporting cast members.",1224892800,,250,4.767441860465116

1402411,4,B000057KCX,"ALL IN A NIGHT'S WORK pairs up Dean Martin and Shirley MacLaine for an hilarious comedy full of mistaken identities, wrong conclusions, blackmail and counter-blackmail.  It's a rare treat.

When a mysterious half-naked girl is seen running from a Palm Beach hotel room containing the deceased publishing tycoon Colonel Ryder, an overzealous private investigator tracks her all the way back to New York.  It turns out that she is Katie Robbins (Shirley MacLaine), an employee of Ryder's research department.  Ryder's nephew Paul (Dean Martin), the new president of the company, is assigned the task of discovering Katie's true ""motives"".

MacLaine and Martin have a brilliant comic chemistry in this bubbly, fast-paced romantic comedy.  They had previously co-starred in ""Artists and Models"" (1955), ""Some Came Running"" (1958), ""Career"" (1959""), and ""Ocean's Eleven"" in 1960 (with ""What a Way to Go!"" as their follow-up to this movie in 1964).

Shirley MacLaine's delicious wardrobe was designed by Edith Head, with an underrated, jazzy score composed by Andre Previn.  The strong ensemble cast includes Gale Gordon (aka Mr Mooney from ""The Lucy Show""), Charlie Ruggles, Mabel Albertson, Jerome Cowan, Cliff Robertson, Norma Crane and Jack Weston.

The DVD features a sharp anamorphic print with a mono soundtrack and optional English subtitles.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",1186099200,4,1380,5.5285714285714285
1402412,5,B000057KCX,"a very fun flick--- where Dino gets to be Dino,  and Shirley Mac

is simply adoreable.  but what other word can you use for Shirley?  great pacing, with good twists & turns ---- not to mention Shirley's curves.",1155772800,8,210,4.447368421052632
1402413,5,B000057KCX,"This is a another superb comedy romance classic starring Shirley MacClaine and Dean Martin Hopefully dvd distributors will have the decency to release another 60's MacClaine classic""Please Come Home"",it would be very beneficial for both them and us!!!",1105920000,11,251,5.631578947368421

All this transpired within the last ten minutes. The screen moved so fast to the next page, that when I hit the back key (after choosing to cancel order) it seems that the cancellation was cancelled.

I think there are too many areas where proximity of places to select options are too close on the page to undesired options.  Maybe create more, less crowded pages or slow things down a bit once cancellations are attempted?

1402444,5,B000057KCX,"Lord God almighty I miss the old days ... when men where men and women were ,ahem, well you get the picture.

I'm tired of what passes for entertainment these days.  Not that there aren't good movies and/or TV out there.  Basically I'm not a fan of blood, gore or in your face sexuality.  Call me old fashioned (or just old) but I enjoy having to use my imagination.

All in a Night's Work is silly, predicable and dated ... but it's also funny in a sweet old fashioned sort of way.  I can watch it and not worry about developing night terrors or PTSD.  I can forget about Ebola, antibiotic resistant ANYTHING, ISIS, and/or the end of the world.",1415491200,2,645,4.325
1402445,4,B000057KCX,An enjoyable but predictable comedy. Very well directed.,1412640000,,56,6.125
1402446,5,B000057KCX,"Very good movie. A true Dean Martin type movie. All the cast did a great job and it was a fun to watch. I hate to say to much about movies and spoil it. Though I did find one part  a bit strange. When Deans charactor actually coaxs his Married friend to go out with him and two other women..because they can now after fooling his wife!  What the heck! I don't see that to much in older movies so I am not sure if that was exceptable in those days to do that but thought it stange and not something exceptable nowdays...though there are strange people who do that sort of thing. It seems a lot of Dean Martin movies are in the swinger type mode.
Still a fun movie otherwise.",1407715200,2,673,4.090909090909091
1402447,2,B000057KCX,"Screwball comedy, yes, fast paced, no.  It was nice to see Shirley Maclain so young you almost do not recognize her.",1405296000,,116,4.523809523809524
1402448,4,B000057KCX,"I don't normally like Shirley MacLaine movies, bit she is really good in these old films. I can see where Renee Zellweger gets some of her style from. Unfortunately like most of these movies, there's not enough Dean. But I'd still recommend it.",1387929600,,244,4.6976744186046515
1402449,3,B000057KCX,"Classic and wonderful cast, Technicolor, Edith Head spinning haute style in monochrome the way no one can do any more, hilarious screw ball mixups, perfect comic timing...what's not to like? I loved this movie - right up to the climax and ending, with which I thought so much more could have been done with some basic adjustments. I won't spoil it for anyone with specifics. Suffice it to say that I was not rooting enough for the romantic couple who is together in the end, and that was no fault of the actors who were doing all they could with a flawed script. Up to that point, it was a perfectly delicious ride.",1329523200,,615,4.451327433628318
1402450,5,B000057KCX,"This is a wonderfully charming romantic comedy, that has a Cinderella-like feel to it, as the worker in research (heroine) gets the owner of the company in the end (hero). This is the type of movie that can be watched over and over again without losing its flair. I love the twists in this one, and really funny misunderstandings, and the great chemistry between the two leads. This is a very cute movie that is a must have for any romance and comedy lovers...a keeper",1314230400,5,468,4.517647058823529
1402451,5,B000057KCX,"This is a fast paced comedy.  There are no dull moments and the movie zips along.  This is a movie I can and have watched over and over.  In all the viewings I have noticed an interesting scene. In the middle of the movie Shirley and Marge are walking through the front doors of the Ryder bldg and heading toward the elevators.  A man walks by, bumps into and maybe grabs a little of Marge's rear.  That had to be a prank by the guy.  Maybe he was the producer or director.  The reaction of Marge is priceless.

One of my favorite lines is from the picture on the DVD cover(upper left).  Dean states, ""I was helping her into her coat.""  Cliff responds, ""What was she doing? Crawling into it?""",1283385600,,692,4.253846153846154

7932937,5,B000057KCX,"Tony Ryder (Dean Martin) never took a real interest in his uncles publishing business until his uncle died. Now the rest of the board of directors does not know what to expect. Luckily it looks like Tony is able to carry of the moral tradition of the magazine.

There is just one hitch, turns out the hotel detective reports that Uncle Rider died with a smile on his face and a woman clad only in a towel was scene leaving the room. The only clue to her identity is an earring with the Chinese symbol for good.

Tony and the board brace themselves knowing that they are ripe for the picking (black mail) by this mysterious woman. If only they could find her and someone foil her plot.

This film was a long time coming let alone on DVD. You will want to watch it again once you know the story to see the clues that were not so obvious the first time around.
