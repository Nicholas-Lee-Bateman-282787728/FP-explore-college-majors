8122688,3,B000FI7082,"Transformers: Headmasters is, as I understand it, the Japanese sequel to Generation One. At first, all the characters are the same, but eventually, as in G1, most of them leave to make room for other heroes, such as Fortress maximus.

This series took some getting used to for several reasons, not the least of which is that none of the characters sound the same as they did in G1. The actors who portrayed them spoke English well enough, but speaking and dramatizing are two different things. I believe the same actors who spoke the original language also spoke English here. Interesting idea, if painful to listen to in some cases. (Like Daniel. Ouch.)

Not to mention, not all of the DVDs worked automatically. For some of them, I had to manually set the player to start at Chapter 2, and then backtrack to Chapter 1 to get the whole story.

Still, for all that, I wound up getting used to the changes, and found myself enjoying the story. The artwork was close enough to G1 that it still felt like a continuation of the old story, warts and all, and the music had more of a beat to it, which I definitely liked.

Still, those same warts might turn off those who aren't fans of Transformers to begin with, and that's who I recommend the collection for.",1234915200,,1255,4.515418502202643
8122689,5,B000FI7082,"Once I received Transformers Headmasters I was dissapointed that it would not confirm and ignored it for several months in my closet.
So I had to purchase a Region Free DVD player, the scripts are not that great, but Transformers can't go wrong. I am up to episode 20 with discipline of once a day without weekends, it is not easy.
I was happy that Headmasters continued where G1 ended.

May The Tranformers go on,and on,and on! They Do.

G1 Headmasters, Masterforce, and Victory! Now complete.
All from the same retailer.",1233878400,2,522,4.725274725274725
8122690,5,B000FI7082,"I liked this set.  I wasn't expecting a lot when I purchased it, since this cartoon mainly was shown just in Japan.  But I liked it nontheless.  It continues the Transformers Saga after the intial run of the Transformers Generation 1.  This set is an import and it is dubbed in English from Chineese or Japaneese, I can't tell really.  But for any avid Transformers fan who was sad to see the G1 end this is a must.",1188086400,,415,4.269230769230769
8122691,1,B000FI7082,"The #1 way to spot illegal bootleg DVDs is to check for Chinese subtitles. This has them. The video and audio were probably captured from either VHS or live broadcast, thus ensuring horrible recording quality, and I wouldn't count on the subtitles as having been translated accurately either. Just wait for Hasbro/Takara to give us the real thing.",1167523200,6,347,5.0
