6751403,5,B00OHNEL60,"I barely remember this series the first time around so it was good to see it with an older perspective. A very good western that featured many up and coming stars of the day.

6751405,5,B00OHNEL60,"I'd forgotten what a delight this series was. Good, literate scripts, yummy atmosphere, good performances by Chuck Connors, and especially the young Johnny Crawford. The scene in the episode ""The Pet"", where Crawford begins to weep real tears on camera is worth the price of the whole set. Strong supporting cast. Well worth your time, and the price.",1425772800,21,350,5.051724137931035

6751411,5,B00OHNEL60,"I'd forgotten just how great this show is! In just 30min. they were able to tell an exciting and always morally relevant story centered around Lucus and his son Mark. Chuck Connors was a professional ball player. But he was also a fairly good actor. And more recently I found out that Johnny Crawford was nominated for an Emmy for his role as Mark McCain.

Always action-packed but never over the top, this show is still so much fun to watch.  I can't say enough about it!
Highly recommended for then and more so for now, in year 2017!",1496188800,,535,4.393939393939394

6751418,5,B00OHNEL60,"Same as my other review of ""The Rifleman."" Outstanding series, one I watched in my youth! Each episode begins with the rapid firing of the Rifleman's Winchester, which set the tone for each show. And, for a half hour show, the stories are great! And family friendly ... definitely recommend this series to all! And I recommend you buy each season in its two part format; the combined season set is almost $20 dollars more  (at the time of this writing) than buying it in two parts.",1489104000,,481,4.528735632183908

6751426,5,B00OHNEL60,"I enjoyed this excellent cowboy series on television from 1958 to 1963.  Because it is the best, I wish that they have cleaned it more completely from little white and black ""dust.""  From time to time there were some frames that had long white lines. But buying it is still worth the money!",1479340800,,290,4.452830188679245

6751429,5,B00OHNEL60,"Season one was in many ways the best. A host of up and coming actors made appearances which helped establish this great Western. Gritty, realistic and solid family values (despite the violence) are the hallmarks of The Rifleman. If you order only one season, make it season one.",1475884800,,278,4.8125

6751432,5,B00OHNEL60,"The Rifleman was one of the truly great westerns. In our age where right and wrong have become incredibly blurred, it's refreshing to see writing and acting that remind us that there is nobility in character and standing against evil. Chuck Connors and Johnny Crawford are a wonderful father and son team. The writing, directing, and cast all make for great viewing from television's true family-friendly age. It was a time when shows were not only about entertainment, but also about teaching character and responsibility.",1473465600,,523,5.1647058823529415
6751433,5,B00OHNEL60,"All of the main characters in this series behave exactly as one would hope everyone would behave, especially Lucas and his son Mark. This series manages to beautifully present life lessons on ethical behavior without in any way coming across as ""preachy."" Anyone with children should get this for them to watch. More than a few adults might learn some badly needed lessons from it, too.",1472860800,,386,4.863636363636363
6751434,5,B00OHNEL60,"I never saw the Rifleman series during its original broadcast. Instead I saw it when the re-runs were played in the afternoon when I was a kid.
Every afternoon, after school, we wandered home to see The Rifleman. Frankly, I forgot almost everything. But, in the deep recesses of my memory,
I still remember the ghosts of Lucas and Mark and Micah the sheriff. Now sitting through the original series I recognize plots and actors from my youth.  Frankly, they are wonderful.  I had thought it was just a blood bath with Lucas shooting everybody in sight. (Some Mad Magazine parody or such.)  But Lucas rarely uses his rifle except in the opening segment.  Most of the shows are about his loving relationship with his son and helping the people who wander through North Fork.  (Supposed to be set in New Mexico. But is obviously shot just North of Los Angeles in California.)
No wonder they thought it was a wonderful character building show for the kids in the 1960's.  That does not mean that some of the ideas are not dated.  We are different today. But, I still love this series. The people we wish we were.",1472774400,7,1108,4.565656565656566

6751448,4,B00OHNEL60,The Rifleman is my favorite western series of this era.  The first seasons dvd quality is good not great.  There were some noticeable imperfections in the picture on Disc 1 of this season.  However the rest of the discs were just fine.  My rating is based on the quality of the dvds not the quality of the scripts or cast whick is excellent.  The first disc of this season contains some of the very best Rifleman episodes.  The Sam Peckinpah episodes quality is excellent and one could tell how he would eventually become the fine director he became.  See the Wild Bunch.  Recommended,1459036800,5,584,4.601941747572815
6751449,5,B00OHNEL60,Great TV Show. No Cursing To Get A Moral Across,1458864000,,47,3.8
6751450,5,B00OHNEL60,"Finally, the price of this wonderful show has come down to a more reasonable price. This show has everything like action, adventure, mystery. Every episode is interest and exciting. Lucas Mccain (The rifleman) is devastatingly good with his rifle and no one can touch him. He is deadly fast and accurate and he sends bad guys and bullies to boot hill every episode. He is a widower with a young son and they run their own ranch and try to make a living and live a peaceful life but there always seems to be someone who comes along to mess up their little piece of heaven and are usually dealt with with deadly force. This show is very much politically incorrect because in this show right is right and wrong is wrong. Justice and fighting for what`s right and uncovering the truth and enjoying freedom are all a part of this show. With every episode there is a moral and a lesson to be learned and you are better and wiser after watching it unlike today`s shows which make you dumber and full you mind full of nasty, vulgar garbage and nonsense. Jesus is your answer and God bless you :)",1458777600,5,1087,4.412935323383085

6751452,5,B00OHNEL60,I enjoyed this DVD very much.  The only thing I didn't enjoy was the first episode.  They left the first episode as it was leaving it unclear.  Other than that I enjoyed the remaining episodes very much.,1456790400,2,203,4.4324324324324325

6751459,5,B00OHNEL60,"Of all the westerns that were part of the great western wave on TV back in the late 50s, The Rifleman was by far the favorite of my Dad and I.  I'm about the same age as Johnny Crawford and I could well identify with his aging and maturing over the series.  I can even remember running and jumping into my Dads arms like Crawford did in several of the earlier episodes.  Even though many westerns went over big in my home growing up, none of them ever topped The Rifleman.  We hardly ever missed it. I can even remember my father reminding me as I left for school that tonight was a Rifleman night, and to make sure to be home on time.  We would look forward to a new episode all day. The series story lines were top notch and very well thought out, the various characters very believable and developed, and the strength and sensitivity that was practiced between Lucas and Mark led to a chemistry between father and son that I never saw in any other western. And there was a nice mix of both drama and violence that never seemed overdone or lame. Even the music on the series seemed a cut above others of its time.  For those that lived through the great western wave on TV back then, it may come as a surprise that no other western ever tackled the same premise that Rifleman did.  That is, though Gunsmoke, Bonanza, and others had copy cat productions, Rifleman was and remained the only western about a widower trying to raise his young son right on the American frontier.  It was very special in that and so many ways..

I am very much enjoying this first year of episodes.  The quality is excellent, and I think this is the very first time I have seen all the episodes in their entirety since the original was on TV.  I plan on picking up season 2 as well, and very much hope that they continue it for all the 5 seasons.  Whether you are a seasoned fan of this series from its heyday or reruns, or whether you have never heard of it before but enjoy westerns, I can't recommend The Rifleman enough.  It was great back then and just as enjoyable a series today...Go for it, and relive an era at its finest that we'll never be seen again...",1446768000,28,2144,4.2772277227722775
