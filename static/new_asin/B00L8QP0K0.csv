6474692,5,B00L8QP0K0,"Just finished watching ""Creature From The Black Lagoon - Complete Legacy Collection"" released by Universal.
I must admit that I had never seen any of ""The Creature From The Black Lagoon"" movies before finding this collection for 50% off in the DVD section of the Barnes & Noble I frequent.  It was in the sale section, so I decided to take a chance and buy it.  I'm glad I did.
The ""Creature From The Black Lagoon - Complete Legacy Collection"" contains ""Creature From The Black Lagoon,"" ""Revenge Of The Creature,"" and ""The Creature Walks Among Us.""
What is intriguing about all three of these movies is that as the Creature is swimming both beneath woman and men, he is actually facing them upwards, face-to-face - though the humans don't know it, and is swimming in a way that can be best described as a courtship ritual.  How this ever got past the censors of the time is beyond me.
""Creature From The Black Lagoon"" is basically an adventure of scientific discovery that leads to the realization that they are being hunted by a lonely creature who is as deadly as man.
""Revenge Of The Creature"" finds the creature being hunted and captured to be put on display at an ocean park - that is actually Marine Land.  Of note, Jacksonville, Florida is the site of the final showdown with the creature after he kidnaps a beautiful young scientist.
""The Creature Walks Among Us,"" finds the creature hiding out in the St. Johns River near St. Augustine where he is captured after being burned nearly to death.  Here is where the franchise gets a bit more bizarre - an obsessed doctor believes the Creature holds the key to humanity's survival in space.
""Creature From The Black Lagoon"" and it's sequels are a good mirror that looks unabashedly at the human condition.
Highly Recommended!
Five Stars!",1517529600,,1791,4.691082802547771
6474693,4,B00L8QP0K0,"I was just a small fry when my pop took us to the show and saw this movie when it came out in the mid-1950's. I was awe-struck when I saw it as a child, and still am, just in a different way. IMO, these CGI science fiction/horror movies out today take a back seat to true classics like Creature From The Black Lagoon. I'm glad that they filmed it in black and white. The scenery is so primitive looking and pristine, that when I first saw it, I believed that it WAS filmed in the Amazon. Hollywood's motion picture cameras and lenses used back at that time gave a picture and perspective that, again in my opinion, were not only unique, but in some ways superior to the special effects gadgets and gizmos of today.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that the picture, while focused pretty well, doesn't have a good, vivid black & white contrast to it. It's like a tint is on the film and wasn't cleared up before releasing it for home purchase. I used as much adjustment in the brightness and contrast functions as I could with my video player, but it made virtually no difference at all.

On the other hand, there are 2 things that I was pleasantly surprised about:

(1) The picture fills the entire screen of my 43"" flat screen TV. In my experience, most remakes of older movies don't fill the screen unless you put it on the zoom mode.

(2) I've always had a passion for how movies are made, and there is a special feature on this DVD showing scenes of the making of the movie. Also, some of the actors, in later years, look back and comment on their roles in the film. And there's footage of the making of the Creature's costume. I absolutely LOVE watching and listening to all of that.

All in all, I'm very happy to have the video. If the black & white had been vivid and clearly contrasted like so many other remakes of 50's shows are, I wouldn't have hesitated to have given it 5 stars.

I thank God that I grew up when I did in this country, and movies like ""Creature From The Black Lagoon"" is just one of the reasons why.",1517356800,3,2048,4.225063938618926

6474906,3,B00L8QP0K0,"This is mainly a review of The Creature Walks Among Us. I review the others separately.

3 stars, Creep Factor: 0, Ending: The creature goes free!, Gore: 0

This is the third installment in the Creature from the Black Lagoon movies. I've seen the 1st many times. It works as your typical black & white, old school, creature feature. Overall, it worked well.
For this movie, they use the King Kong template of human characters: leader of expedition who is slightly sinister & wants to use the creature for his own purposes, heroic man who is calm under pressure, blond love interest, & assorted others.
They threw in some warnings about tampering genetically with nature (as they try to turn the creature into a human - don't ask why). The leader, besides being arrogant, was extremely jealous & OCD. And there was another member who thought it appropriate to sexually harass the blond love interest (who is the wife of the extremely jealous & OCD leader). So MUCH HUMAN DRAMA!
The creature ended up being the least drama generating character & the least violent. Go figure. He just wants to go home & live in the water.
It's interesting that horror movies, especially creature features, deal with man's relationship to nature/science more often & more effectively than mainstream movies. Think Frankenstein as the 1st. This one even had a discussion about man destroying the environment at the start - pre-global warming & gas crisis. Then it brought in the Jurassic Park proverb - the more man tries to change natural processes, the more likely man will die!",1454371200,3,1559,4.835205992509363
