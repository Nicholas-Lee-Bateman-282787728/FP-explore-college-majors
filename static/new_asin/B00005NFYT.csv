1633642,4,B00005NFYT,"I'm a tennis player, so I thought that Anna K's workout might be a good one to try. It is definitely challenging. Most people don't have the space available for the wind-sprints and cone-course exercises she has at the end, but most of the exercises can be done at home. Most people don't have a medicine ball, but you can do the same exercises with a basketball. The balance ball adds a whole new dimension to free weight exercises,  so it's worth getting one.
Anna's feeble nutrition and diet tips are a waste of tape. But I wish the producers had spent a little more time showing Anna play tennis. A tennis tip or two would have been nice and might encourage non-players to take up the game.
Someone commented on how awful the music is and I cannot understand what his objection was. It's pretty much soft rock, not played very loudly. The visuals are also shot with taste and restraint. No sleazy, lingering shots of her chest and butt, thank goodness. But my teenage son did enjoy watching it nonetheless.",1007251200,12,1010,4.549450549450549
1633643,5,B00005NFYT,"This video really makes yah think. Anna K is so hot it hurts. Oh sure, not as much as jumping on a bycicle without a seat, but it hurts. I was feelin the burn all right mmmm ssss mmmm sss. But seriously folks, This is physical fitness at it's best. yeeh",1005350400,3,253,3.980392156862745
1633644,3,B00005NFYT,The only parts of my body that this gives a decent workout to are my heart (pounding whenever I see Anna) and my imagination.,1005004800,2,125,4.25
1633645,5,B00005NFYT,"What a pleasant surprise.  Obviously for everyone who is a fan of Anna, this tape is a must. I must admit I didn't know what to expect in a fitness video. But there was a wide range of exersises that were very well explained and demonstrated and all to pleasant happy music that helped you get into it.  I'm impressed that no one needs to have to train at a gym or buy exotic machinery or equipment to do any of it either.  There were even some interesting nutritional tips given.  Finally I found the presentation to be first rate.  Anna took the workout very seriously, yet smiled a lot and didn't shy away from anything, including doing one handed push ups.  Quite amazing. If you take a look at what it has done for her fitnness, I think it fair to assume it will do us all good to try her work out.  I hope you will enjoy this video, I sure did.",1004313600,2,850,4.146341463414634
1633646,5,B00005NFYT,"From the moment you pop the video in, you can feel the exhileration of the tennis star's workout. The energy of the music is second only to Ms. Kournikova's energy and tireless routine consisting of arm pumps, leg lifts and exercises with dumbells. After the workouts are over, you feel satisfied and tired, yet ready for more. I look forward to her future efforts. I would recommend this to anyone, especially those of you who don't have a workout partner.",1003881600,2,457,4.725
1633647,4,B00005NFYT,"The music to this video was loud and awful. Unless you like heavy metal type music, you'll find it unbearable. The music was geared toward Anna's young male groupies instead of the serious thirty and older customers.
If you can deal with the music, Anna shows you practically every exercise to reach every muscle. It's a great workout and the exercises are extremely helpful for improving your physical ability in the sport you play, especially tennis which is why I bought this tape in the first place. It helps in improving your speed, strength, endurance, balance, and agility and even tells you how many calories you should be eating and gives you four examples of a good nutritional power breakfast. It also shows you how to warm up before hand and how to cool down afterwards.
However, the video does not tell you how much weight,sets, or repetitions you should do except for saying that you should use a weight amount to work out with that makes you tired after 15-20 reps. She uses an agility ball, cones, a box, a medicine ball, weights, lateral resistors, and a jump rope. You'd have to buy some of these exercise tools or use your imagination and use things around the house. But if you're serious about self physical improvement, I definitely think it's worth the investment.
I am rating this video a 4, only because the music is horrendous and I can't mute it because then I can't hear the instuctions.
If you have some knowlegde about reps and sets on your own, and you play a sport, especially tennis, or just want to get in shape and can get past the music, I would then recommend this video.
I would also recommend it to heavy metal music fans.",1002153600,12,1661,4.595959595959596
7947015,4,B00005NFYT,"It's a variety of different workouts.  She does some drills for various athletic skills, some calisthenics, and some plyometrics.  Some of it is done in real time, where you can follow along, but some of it is not.  I feel the section on plyometrics is probably the best, because (as she points out) most people neglect that aspect of their training.

The music is okay, her narration is helpful and concise, and the workout overall is pretty good.  The only reason I don't give it a perfect rating is just because there really isn't anything new here per se.  It's a good but ultimately pretty standard-issue workout.  Also, the nutrition guide is basically just her macronutrient preferences with a few sample meal suggestions.  Overall though it's a good video.",1418774400,,764,4.868217054263566
7947016,5,B00005NFYT,"I recommed the seller the item came in time well packet, I had the CD copy is a great video some of the excercises are good but is nice see Anna encouraging doing fitness with her and I love tennis. This fitness is for people who practise Tennis",1308787200,,245,4.125
7947017,4,B00005NFYT,"Anna came into my living room the other day. (Must have been between tennis games). She left without asking me if I was busy that evening.
She did some really nice workouts. Workouts were very professional. (I am only interested in her workout for professional reasons.) If you believe that, then you believe I only read the articles in adult magazines.",1195603200,,353,4.80327868852459
7947018,5,B00005NFYT,"Anna K is sooo hot. There is nothing better then just sitting down once in a while and watching this video. If your feeling down and out with what your life is all about, pop this video in and you'll feel better. It was cool
Big Truck",1045526400,9,234,4.0
7947019,4,B00005NFYT,"It's a great dvd for if you are trying to develop for a sport.  She really shows exercises that she does for tennis.  This was a pleasant surprise as I thought they'd just put together a workout and stick her in there to have people buy it.
The big negative I had, was, when buying it, there was nothing to indicate on the case that you would need all that equipment and a partner.  You need a medicine ball, orange cones, a big powerball, hand weights, bands for your ankles, a giant grid for the floor, a step, and etc.  I wish they would have had the tennis clips etc. on an optional separate part of the dvd.  If you just want to do the work out, you have to sit through that.
I like it, because it's geared towards improving athleticism as opposed to just sculpting muscles.",1013212800,18,779,4.236486486486487
7947020,5,B00005NFYT,I'd give this more stars if I could.  The only thing missing is the brass pole.,1012521600,16,79,3.9375
7947021,5,B00005NFYT,"Not geared for females in need of an actual workout video, but I give it five chubbies for Annas male admirers.",1011744000,4,111,4.333333333333333
7947022,2,B00005NFYT,"Anyone who likes to see Anna's pretty smile, her ""... body"" ... ... or her charming manner - well...try NOT TO SEE this workaday, serious, business-like tape. To me (a real fan of her charms and sassy ways off-court and on her calendars), her drab workout was bland and routine.  She never wore a second outfit, or gave us even one of her dazzling smiles (not one).  Her voice seemed unappealing (she didn't persuade us, I thought.) You gotta have a gimmick, or at least some special quality.  So Anna disappoints us here.",1010448000,4,522,4.591397849462366
7947023,5,B00005NFYT,"Anna Kournikova doing an exercise video?  First thoughts that come to mind: Finally a video that will show her in her oh so famous skin tight pre tennis match warmup outfits.  As far as a exercise video is concerned you can pretty much do everything she does in the privacy of your home--jump rope, ab-exercises (both sitting and standing) and various short distance shuttle runs. What makes this video for all of the male Anna fans is all of the closeups of her very sexy body in her sports bra and hotpants.  The cameraman definitely knows how to make this vieo eyecandy, with various thigh and leg shots, and also several but shots.  This definitely is the best of the superhot Anna.",1007942400,10,686,4.598360655737705
