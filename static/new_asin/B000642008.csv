2165271,5,B000642008,"I'm just an Earnhardt fan so I can't point out any inaccuracies that may lie in this film about the life of Dale Earnhardt, but what I can tell you is that I really enjoyed this movie. I was impressed with Barry Peppers performance and after watching this movie I am as proud as I ever have been to call myself a fan of Mr. Dale Earnhardt: the Man, the Father, the Husband, and a pretty damn good driver, too! This one is worth buying folks, ESPN did a good job of blending in race footage from actual races and I just can't imagine any Earnhardt fan not enjoing this film let alone all the bonus footage on the DVD.",1102723200,2,616,4.141666666666667
2165272,5,B000642008,"It's doubtful that anyone reading these reviews gives a rats butt what your opinion of Dale Earnhardt is...they want to know how the movie rates.  From the trailers, it looks to be an honest portrayal of a controversial figure in American racing.  Berry Pepper is only an asset to this production, and seems to have hit the nail on the head with his portrayal of the ""Man in Black"".

2165313,5,B000642008,"I owned one of the first copies of this movie back when it came out (it's in storage in another state).
There is a few differences in reality with the story, for drama effects.  The makers of this movie did get with the Earnhardt ""kids"", along with others in the Earnhardt and racing circles, to get as accurate and real as possible.

With his death being 12 years ago, this is a great way to be able to reminisce about the Intimidater.

2165322,3,B000642008,"Let me start by saying I was a big Dale Earnhardt (Sr) fan & still am. I don't watch NASCAR anymore. But, I can see why this story wasn't 'approved' by the family. It casts him in less than an appealing way-and is focused mostly on his early career. It doesn't even really cover his legacy or the crash that he died in. There are a few interviews on the 2nd DVD-but they are fairly short (& old). The movie casts him as a hothead & really doesn't talk very much about him off the track in the later years. To be honest, I would highly recommend watching SportsCentury or The Day-Remembering Dale Earnhardt on YouTube as opposed to buying this movie.",1360627200,,649,4.327868852459017

2165333,2,B000642008,"There is more drama with these ESPN movies than on any NASCAR track, and this nominal biography of Dale Earnhardt, Sr., is not an exception to this very frustrating rule.

Initially airing on December 11, 2004, the screenplay was not approved by Teresa Earnhardt or the Earnhardt family. Team owner Richard Childress - who had a longtime partnership/friendship with Dale, Sr. - sued ESPN for copyright infringement for using the logo associated with the race cars.

Actor Barry Pepper does a good job in the lead role, in a script that inaccurately portrays the rivalry between Dale, Sr., and Darrell Waltrip. The pair - who battled on the track - became friends, with Waltrip driving for Dale Earnhardt Incorporated near the end of his career.

The bonus footage is outstanding, which includes an ESPN documentary on the life & times of Dale, Sr., highlights from races and a feature on the making of the movie.

But a Collector's Edition does not win through a support series and 3: The Dale Earnhardt Story, runs out of gas before reaching the finish line.",1205020800,,1059,4.834254143646409
2165334,3,B000642008,"I'm glad to see Earnhardt's memory being cherished and honored.  I think the actors all did a very good job.  And the first part of the movie, showing Earnhardt's tough upbringing, was exceptional (hats off to J.K. Simmons, but I'm used to that by now).
My problems with the movie come during the later stages of it.
Problem number one: Dale's relationship with Darrell Waltrip.  In reality, while they were fierce rivals, they were also very good friends.  In the movie, they are portrayed as despising each other's very existence.  The one scene that really galled me was when Waltrip bragged about telling the press they could ""write whatever you want about Earnhardt and his team, they can't read anyway"".  Are there any NASCAR fans that can imagine DW saying that, not just about another driver, but about a close friend? (which he was, regardless of the movie's inaccurate portrayal)
Problem number two: Earnhardt's general actions off the track when he converses with other drivers.  While Dale was certainly a tough, strong-willed, independent guy, he wasn't the malcontent grump that all the other drivers hated in the movie.  With the exception of Neil Bonnet, no driver ever showed Dale any kind of respect, instead offering nothing but hostility.  Not even close to the truth.
Problem number three: I do NOT like the way the movie ended.  They show clips of the 2001 Daytona 500, then show the crash clip.  When they show the crash, it starts just as Marlin gets into Dale, then just as Dale's car hits the wall, it fades to white, and there's a shot of Dale as a boy meeting his late father, presumably a ""racetrack in heaven type thing"".  In my opinion, this is just irresponsible, because it fails to show just how much his death hit home.  I would have included a montage showing the paramedics arriving, Earnhardt Jr. running to his dad's car after the race, the press release, the memorials all over the country, the silent third laps, Harvick's win at Atlanta, Earnhardt Jr.'s win at the Pepsi 400, etc.  Someone with no prior knowledge could even think NASCAR was glad to be rid of him, because all they see is a malcontent guy everyone hates getting killed.  The omission of tributes removes an essential piece of the movie-showing just how much Dale meant to NASCAR.  People should know about the silent third laps for the rest of the year.  People should know about Harvick, driving in just his third race, winning in Dale's car, and driving a victory lap with three fingers out the window and then dedicating it to Dale in victory lane.  People should know about Earnhardt Jr. winning the very next race at Daytona, with Waltrip right behind him, then the two of them, in tears, hugging on top of Earnhardt Jr.'s car.  All these things should have been included in the movie.",1204848000,,2799,4.734020618556701
2165335,5,B000642008,My son says that this DVD is great and he loves it. Dale Earnhardt Sr is his hero in racing and he supported him til the day he died.,1200096000,,133,3.6206896551724137
2165336,5,B000642008,"I am a new fan to NASCAR, so I really wasn't too up on the life of The Intimidator.  Hence, I bought this movie.  This was a good movie.  I learned a lot about the man, the myth and the legend.  From what people tell me it was pretty accurate.  The actors were highly believeable, which was important for me, and the movie was not cheesy.  It was a solid movie.  I am glad I got it and I will certainly watch it again and again.  The bonus features were cool as well.  Interviews, documentaries, race clips and highlights--it has it all!  I was really pleased with this product and learned a lot about Dale Earnahardt.",1185062400,,618,4.25
2165337,4,B000642008,"The movie had me hooked right from the beginning, as it followed three generations of Earnhardts; Ralph Earnhardt (Dale's dad), Dale himself, and Dale Jr.  The film only briefly focused on Dale Earnhardt's other children (mostly Kerry). In addition, Teresa Earnhardt was wonderfully played by Elizabeth Mitchell (she played Juliet in the ""Lost"" tv series), and has been in several feature films as well.

Even though I'm more of a Jeff Gordon fan, I thought this was a well-acted, well-paced, and  above average made-for-tv movie (ESPN). Most of the acting was of  feature film quality. As well, most of the actors looked so much like their real-life counterparts, that it added tremendously to my enjoyment of it. The guy who played Dale Jr. was one of the real life racing instructors at the track that the actor's were training at. He had never acted before, but was hired because he looked and sounded so much like Dale Jr. Only the actor who played Darrell Waltrip was poor, and also looked nothing like him.

Unfortunately, the ending was far too abrupt and short, and wasted almost all of the tension the movie had built up. It left me feeling cold and cheated. It's too bad they didn't cut out about five minutes from the movie, so that they could have added scenes that took place AFTER Dale's final race. I wanted to see the emotional reactions from the characters I had just spent ninety minutes with, so that the senseless loss would be more gut-wrenching and therefore more satisfying overall.

DVD Special Features (Extras):

Disc #1: Has two featurettes on it, both of which are above average as well. The making of the movie featurette was 35 minutes in length and wasn't just a puff piece like most making-of extras often are. It even showed some of the actors looping their dialogue-it was short, but was still better explained than I've seen it done anywhere else.

There was also a 43 minute extra, which featured interviews with several stars and racing people, including the real Dale Earnhardt and Dale Jr.  It's really a shame that this featurette had more teary eyes and emotional impact than the ending of the actual movie. The movie would have been so much more satisfying if some of that emotion had been included at the end. After you watch the movie make sure you watch this EXTRA. I was much more satisfied after watching it and I know you will be too.

Disc #2: Has a total of five different interviews, from the years: 1991, 1997 and 1998. Most are just with Dale Earnhardt, but some include his son, Dale Jr. They total 59 minutes in length and are quite good.

Also included, are two ESPN Tv shows that Dale Earnhardt appeared on. They are: ""2 Minute Drill"" (21 minutes in length), and ""Ultimate Outdoors with Wayne Pearson"" (18 minutes in length). In ""2 minute Drill"", Dale just asks the contestants Nascar related questions, and in ""Ultimate Outdoors..."", we watch Dale hunt a deer. I found it creepy watching him wait for, and then shoot the deer. I knew he hunted, but I just didn't think he would like it so much. Very disturbing, even though they never showed the bullet entering each deer.

Finally, there is actual (edited) ESPN race footage (in full screen) from four different races. However, they DIDN'T include Dale's only Daytona 500 win, or his 7th Nascar Winston Cup Championship clinching race. Very odd.

Instead, the four included races are as follows:

1) 1993- Atlanta (Hooter's 500): Last race of the 1993 season where Dale clinches his 6th Championship. (45 minutes)

2) 1995- Sear's Point (Sonoma, Calif.)(Save Mart Supermarkets 300): Dale wins his first Nascar Winston Cup road race- with some nice roof-cam (etc.) shots. (28 minutes)

3) 1999- Bristol (Goody's Headache Powder 500; and NO, it's NOT the Busch 500, like the Dvd menu says): Night race battle between Dale Earnhardt and Terry Labonte. (14 minutes)

4)1999- IROC race-Round 3 from Michigan: 23rd running of the International Race Of Champions; featuring equal cars all painted in different colors. Dale was driving the blue car. Dale Jr. and Jeff Gordon were also in the race, along with 9 other drivers (not all from Nascar). Great finish.

So, I'd give the movie 3 and a half stars on it's own (even with the disappointing ending), and the DVD extras push it up to 4 stars overall.",1184284800,,4306,4.764784946236559

I didn't learn anything new about Dale but was entertained by a great story and some very good acting.  The Movie alone was worth the purchase price but the Bonus Features are so amazing I was floored!  They don't just show some clips here and there ~ there is lap after lap racing footage that could be an entire DVD itself.  This would be a great gift for any racing enthusiast!,1169078400,,541,4.39

2165341,5,B000642008,"I put this film at #9 of the greatest films of all time, just ahead of Breakin at #10. Here are some of the films that missed my list:

Citizen Kane

Forrest Gump

Eight Men Out

Animal House

My Mommy is having a baby

Gone with the Wind

Better off Dead

The folks at ESPN were given the second most impossible task ever, make a movie about E. The toughest task will be to make a movie about me after I die, where would you even start casting? Back to E. He is a really a neat guy. This movie portrays him as the cuddly prankster we all got to know and love when he was driving in circles Sunday after Sunday. Is there anything in the world of sports more engrossing than guys driving in a circle for 4 hours? Only the tour de france can compare in terms of sheer excitement. In this movie, Barry ""Dr."" Pepper plays the god of automobiles, Tim Dayer(I think that's what people down here called him). He grows up in a backass town where no one has any hope of benefitting society in any way shape or form. His dad runs cars in circles and Timdayer thinks it looks like a lot of fun. He ends up doing the same thing and being better at it than his dad. He makes a lot of friends along the way because he's a good racer. Sometimes he makes other drivers mad because he passes them and wins (that is the object of this sport). I made a lot of other kids mad on the BMX circuit in Gretna with my style, but as Timdayer said, Rubbin your facin. In the end, E runs into a wall and dies.

Now onto the movie about me. Where do you start? I personally think it would have to be a North and South type 10 hour mini series. You'd have to have my life broken up into five year periods or you'd run the risk of leaving out something that changed the world. You'd also open the network to countless complaints that my life wasn't covered properly. Some of the great scenes would be:

1. Sparrow flies into my forehead and dies

2. The great pickup on dodge(Natalie Portman would play the girl)

3. Me dropping 43 against Rhombus

4. Me winning at a lot of things (montage with ""you're the best around"" music).

E is solid family fun until he dies at the end.",1135123200,2,2146,4.1028708133971294
2165342,3,B000642008,"This is just one of those short made for TV movies, less than 92 minutes long!!! Hardcore, Nascar fans will still though find this amusing though!!! This movie tells about the legendary Dale Earnhart ""3"", giving you a basic overview and brief biography of his life, that was pretty good in fact!!! My little brother a Nascar fan has watched it already about 10 times, so I' ve pretty much mermorized the entire film!!!

 I myself didn't think that Barry Pepper, captured Earnhart's image that well either. He did a good job acting, but just jot the same as the man himself!!! Barry Pepper also with co producing the film as well, so Barry Pepper was a big contributer to the film!!! If you consider that they made this with a very low budget, you kind of see the genius!!! Their are some people who absolutely love this movie (Nascar fans), while others people that didn't like it or understand it!!!

 It may not have a lot of depth or bea movie like ""Aviator""!!! Really folks can you compare an academy award winning film with a made for tv movie!!! This movie is meant to help you understand Dale Earnhart and what he was as a person and driver!!! Dale Earnhart ""The Intimidator"", one of the legends of the sport, and the most entertaining driver to watch, as he  feared nobody!!! The movie shows his life from his childhood, with his dad Ralph Earnhart, until his final moments at Daytona, back in 2001!!!

This movie is a Nascar fans, dream, but wait disc 2 is the real gold here!!! The best stuff is truly on the second disc which moved my rating to 3 to 3.5!!! The second disc has alot of great footage a Nascar fan's dream!!! I myself am not the biggest Nascar fan around, but let me tell you disc2 is worth buying this movie!!!

-Exclusive interviews With Dale Earnhart

-An inside look at the legend: spectacular racing footage from Dale's best races on ESPN!!!

-Making of ""3"" Feature

-Documentary on the life and legacy of Dale Earnhart

... and more goodies for Nascar fans!!!

Along with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound and, along with French and Spanish subtitles!!!

 Overall, I will give the 2 disc collector's package of ""3"" a 3.5/5, the movie itself a  3/5!!! Nascar fans will love, for evrybody else it depends on your taste of movies!!!",1125273600,2,2259,4.556930693069307
2165343,1,B000642008,"In my part of Virginia NASCAR is as common as Peanut Butter in a grocery store.  Everywhere you go, you are going to see it.  It is either on cars, on shirts, on billboards, or anywhere else that your eyes may wonder.  Most of the material still pays respect to the number ""3"" and the driver that will forever be missed.  It pulls people to the track to see that number and thankfully everyone can profit off the commercial success of this driver's death.  Sadly, ESPN also did this and the result was the ill-fated made-for-TV-movie, 3: The Dale Earnhardt Story starring the ""I need work bad"" actor, Berry Pepper.  Literally racing through the life of this legend, this film boasts a simple 88 minutes and vaguely covers whatever it can to give rabid fans just a taste of this man's life.  Instead of giving him the proper respect, ESPN uses clichs and over-bearing family moments that just scream ""made-for-TV"".  With Pepper's accent fading in and out within races, you cannot help but laugh at this cheaply designed model created by director Russell Mulcahy.

So, what went wrong with this film?  Since the word ""everything"" will not cover all of it, I will attempt to explain in some detail.  I cannot stress this fact enough that if an actor looks like the person that you are trying to portray, it does not mean that he or she will do a good job (see the Charlize Theron theory).  This goes for Barry Pepper, who just never really gave Earnhardt any personality.  I felt like I was watching the story of one of those paper cutout dolls.  Sure, his costumes and appearance would change, but nothing else would.  His motions and emotions were forced and never really felt like I was watching the life of NASCAR's greatest, but instead seeing an actor do an impersonation of someone that he admires.  Pepper would not have Executive Produced this film if he wasn't already an Earnhardt fan (or at least could see the $$ made from the death of a human).  The same could be said about the rest of the actors in this film.  The children felt and sounded like paper mache, never quite seeming that comfortable in front of the camera ... especially Dale Jr.  I felt as if a gust of wind could have made him cry.  In fact, all the performances in this film coupled with a gust of wind made me cry.

As I mentioned earlier, the timing on this film seemed very off.  How can you successfully measure the power of a man in a short span of 88 minutes?  There is just no way that you are going to be able to cover the depth and emotional excitement in this short time.  So, the creative team behind this film chose to ignore these moments and extend the racing scenes.  The outcome was literally horrible.  There was no balance, there was no craft, there was nothing actually paying respect to this man.  The story is where I could see the minds of the cash hungry people just getting bigger and bigger because they were going to do a story about a man life that millions would want to see.  They would want to see it not because it was good, but because the Earnhardt name was solely attached to it.  For a non-NASCAR fan like myself, this was kind of sad.  How can you have the life of Howard Hughes pushing three hours, and NASCAR powerhouse Dale Earnhardt just 88 minutes?  I guess you can over compensate by giving the viewers some extra features to the DVD, but for me that just didn't work.  The story was sloppy and completely disgraced Earnhardt's name.

Overall, this proved to me that if you give a bunch of rednecks a camera, this is the quality of work that they will produce.  This was one of the worst autobiographical stories that I have seen in a very long time, even for the likes of ""made for TV"" it was horrible.  There was nothing redeemable in this story that I could go back to friends or family and say, ""Well, this part was kinda neat"".  There was nothing of the sort here.  I walked away from the film with less of an understanding about Earnhardt and his NASCAR business.  Even if you are a huge NASCAR fan, I do not think you will see the value in this film.  I especially love reading other reviews that say that this was a great film, but lacked some major elements to Dale's life.  Isn't that like a double negative?  Good film, but somehow you forgot to mention this?  I think some are just too generous with this story.  I am sad that he died, but this is not the way to pay respect to the man's life.

A bit choppy in moving between events in Dale Sr. life but found it entertaining and informational with a peek into the great Dale Earnhardt's life.

2165345,4,B000642008,"I've been following Dale Earnhardt since the mid 80's and, like every other 3 fan, I was ready to tear this movie apart! In all honesty, it was a damn good movie!

There were a few parts that weren't exactly correct, but they were things only true NASCAR/Earnhardt fans would have known. One scene shows Jake Elder, Dale's crew cheif leaving the team after his first Championship when actually, Doug Richert was Dale's crew chief during that season. Another scene of Dale and DW wrecking at Richmond in 1986 didn't really turn out the way they showed it. I have that race on VHS and Dale never jumped out of the car saying ""I didn't mean to wreck him! I just wanted to rattle his cage!"" In fact, Dale made that comment about Terry Labonte after the Bristol night race in 1999! One other thing I didn't care for was the way they showed Dale having nightmares and waking up in a cold sweat. Even Dr. Jerry Punch from ESPN said he didn't think that ever happened.

Overall, the movie was a good depiction of Dale's life but there were a few things that were left out like the charity work Dale did and his freindship with Tim Richmond. But, then again, if it were up to me it would have been a miniseries!

If you're an Earnhardt fan, you NEED to own this movie!",1105488000,6,1259,4.348936170212766
2165346,4,B000642008,"""All I wanna do is race, Daddy.""  An oil-stained, greasy-headed teenage Dale Earnhardt explains to his father why he can't hold a job or maintain a relationship; he just wants to race.  ESPN's most recent foray into sports-themed biopics focuses on NASCAR's swashbuckling ""Man in Black"", a hero of the common man and an individual who helped nurture NASCAR's financial boom of the 1980s and 1990s.

""3"" attempts to speak to the psychological make-up of racecar drivers.  Like his colleagues, Earnhardt has to learn to understand the dangers of the track (to protect himself and his expensive car), but he can't let those dangers cause him to drive scared.  Dale represses the fears anyone would experience in an industry where so many die doing their job.  The film shows how those repressed fears manifest themselves in nightmares and instability.

But more than just speaking about drivers in general, ""3"" tries to nail down Dale Earnhardt, the man, and explain what made him one of the more loved and hated men in sports history.  He goes through wives, earns respect and disdain from his fellow drivers and remains an enigmatic mystery to most around him.  With his faults, Dale is shown to be a man of him word and remains loyal to his parents, his friend Neil Bonet and in his own ""Great Santini"" way, his children.

A major element lacking from this feature concerns the impact Earnhardt had on the working class South.  In order to understand Earnhardt, people unfamiliar with NASCAR must first try to understand the people who loved him.  He was not just a sports figure; to legions of downtrodden southerners, Dale Earnhardt was a man who gave people hope.  When he died, a large group of people lost Elvis, Princess Diana and Martin Luther King, all rolled into one.  Any film about his life should give a large amount of attention to the fans who made him an icon and have insured his immortality.",1105228800,6,1909,4.780487804878049

I was glad to see this movie when it aired on ESPN on Dec. 11th. Barry Pepper did such a great job portraying the NASCAR Legend. Dale Earnhardt will always be in my thoughts and I bet he's up there in God's Victory Lane saying to Barry Pepper 'Nice Job!'

2165350,2,B000642008,"Dale E. was the greatest stock car driver ever, and paid some serious dues along the way up to the ultimate price at Daytona in 2001. To be a great athlete, also your family life takes a beating, and Dale's family life problems was no exception until his later years.

I was at Daytona and witnessed Dale's crash. Like many, the crash didn't seem that bad, and I left the stands thinking only what a great race it had been with DEI cars finishing 1 & 2 in the finish. When I finally got to my vehicle, I learned on the radio that Dale had died, and I just couldn't believe it. It was two years before I returned to the track, after Dale's death.

I thought this movie was really lame and poorly writtened. The actoring was OK, but the movie was just really flat and kinda of bogus, no dispect to the actors. I could really tell it was a low budget/""tight shoot"" movie, about one of the greatest athletes in history.

There is so many good documentary's of ""E's"" life, this movie seemed like only an attempt to make a fast buck off this great Legend. Dale's contribution to the sports and entertainment industry, and society deserved better.",1103932800,3,1140,4.393364928909953
2165351,5,B000642008,"It was a very difficult thing to try to do, give a 49 year biography in only 90 minutes.  I personally think Barry Pepper did a pretty good job of depicting Dale.  I am sure the movie missed a few key points, but it did give a lot of insight as to why things were the way they were with Dale.  His father, while tough, taught Dale some valuable lessons that sustained him for the rest of his life.  It showed how things used to be, you had to work for them, not have them handed to you like the young hotshots of today.  There will never be another one like him, and NASCAR has lost one of the best drivers to ever drive a stock car.

The 5 hours of extra footage should bring back some wonderful memories.  I hope they show some of the old races, such as the win at the 1998 Daytona 500, or how he passed Bill Elliott in the grass at Charlotte in 1987, or how he passed 18 cars in the last 4 laps at Talladega in 2000.  There is so much that could be shown, it would be impossible to show all of the high points in just a mere 5 hours.

It is quite apparent that some reviewing this movie are not Earnhardt fans.  Take the movie for what is was worth, and don't bash it just because you were not a fan (SS, WMD).

After viewing ""3"", I must say that I was impressed by the work.  Being that this was a TV movie (And I'm not a big fan of TV movies.), it didn't surprise me that the director would tread very thin on the biographical history and not ruffle feathers any further about his love life, his relationship with his fellow drivers or other tracks.  The portayal of Earnhardt by Barry Pepper was great.  He captured his style and essence.  However, I would have loved to see more about some of his rituals at the track.

2165357,4,B000642008,"I watched this movie twice during the weekend it premiered, and for the record I have been a die-hard Dale Earnhardt fan and follower since the late 1980's. I really wish somehow that ESPN and the Earnhardt family could have worked together on this; it would have been so much better and more accurate. I also think ESPN could have used the Dale Earnhardt: Determined book by Benny Phillips as a good reference; it was the only book published with Earnhardt's authorization himself. The acting was great considering what they had to work with. I have already read a lot of reviews, most of them expressing concern over the lack of Earnhardt's story on the racetrack. If you have followed Dale's career, the fact that he won so many races, had a love-hate relationship with fans, won 7 championships, and the elusive Daytona 500 is all common knowledge, and we have all been there to experience his on track accomplishments and argue his style and reputation. What we know so little about Earnhardt is his life off the racetrack, how he came to be a Winston Cup driver, and what's most intriguing to me, his relationship with his father, Ralph Earnhardt. That was the focus of this movie. The only things I know about Earnhardt off the racetrack is written in books or expressed vaguely in interviews. There is no doubt that three of the biggest things Dale Earnhardt was most proud of off the racetrack was the guidance of and relationship with his father, his relationship with Teresa, and his concern for Dale, Jr. as Jr. tries to build his racing career. That's what this movie tries to do, but since the Earnhardts and ESPN couldn't come to terms on the movie, it's hard to tell what is true and what isn't. One thing I do know for sure is that the movie could have used a lot more of Richard Childress. Richard was so vital in developing Dale as a driver, and while the movie portrays the relationship with Neil Bonnett extensively, it seems to leave out a third common thread in Childress. Childress was also very close to Neil Bonnett, Bonnett died in a Childress car after Childress seemed to be the only car owner willing to give a hungry driver a chance at a comeback. At the same time, I think ESPN may have been wise to tread lightly on the Childress issue, since Childress was opposed to the unauthorized making of the movie. The other things I think could have been adjusted, but I think was just Hollywood-style filmmaking were the inaccuracies of Dale's quotes (the rattle the cage quote happened after the Goody's 500 in 1999 at Bristol, and the kerosene rag quote was a response to a reporter's question asking Earnhardt's opinion of NASCAR introducing restrictor plates at Daytona and Talladega), Jake Elder leaving after Osterlund sold the race team to Stacy (Elder actually left after Dale's rookie season with Osterlund, putting a 20-year-old Doug Richert in position to guide Dale's first championship, long before Osterlund sold the race team). The Darrell Waltrip stuff early in the movie could have been polished up a little, and a better actor could have been used (although no one can act like Darrell except Darrell himself), but the ending of the movie with Darrell announcing made up for it (many new or non NASCAR followers would probably never realize it was Darrell announcing at the end, though). A lot of people expressed concern over the lack of the Earnhardt-Jeff Gordon rivalry, but you know what? There was no rivalry, because both drivers were great at different times. The only time Gordon and Earnhardt had anything resembling a rivalry was the 1995 season (and here's another great Earnhardt quote not used in the movie) when Gordon edged Earnhardt, and Earnhardt made the remark about having to serve milk at the banquet because Gordon was too young to drink wine. After Earnhardt won the 1995 Brickyard 400, Earnhardt claimed to be the first man to win the race, hinting that Gordon was the first boy to win it when he did the year before. Nothing was ever mentioned about Dale's time with Bud Moore in 1982-1983, while Childress spent time preparing a better race team upon Earnhardt's return to RCR in 1984. I thought the Daytona 500 scenes were a little out of place at times, the first caution with Andretti happened after and not before the last round of pit stops (when Earnhardt came out first, and then-teammate Skinner in second, then the two Andretti cautions came out, the latter that sealed the race for Dale). But nothing was made of Earnhardt's bad luck in the 500 to build up to the triumphant and jubilation of Earnhardt finally winning it in 1998. I would like to have seen a more joyful, prankster Dale Earnhardt, much like the way Neil Bonnett was played. Dale was very sentimental, but not somber and over-reflective as the movie portrays him to be at times. Barry Pepper could have also added a little bulk to his character's stature; Earnhardt was a robust 6'1"" 200 pounds, versus the skinny, frail looking Earnhardt we see later in the movie. The crash flashbacks/nightmares I felt were unnecessary because Earnhardt was too fearless and unconcerned about his bad crashes, and never mentioned once at all about being afraid in a race car. If anything, I do remember his voice quivering and almost being in tears after having to give up his seat for Skinner in the 1996 Brickyard, a week after his bad crash at Talladega; that showed a lot about his desire and his determination about being in a race car. As for the ending, I don't think there could be a more emotional, appropriate, and tasteful ending; followed by video clips of the real Earnhardt in the closing credits; reminded me a lot of the Lane Frost material at the end of another tear-jerker in 8 Seconds. All in all, for the entertainment value of the movie it was very good; if you are looking to use this as a factual, biographical account of Dale Earnhardt's life, I don't think it is very accurate and true; but it could have been. Maybe this will prompt the big-name Hollywood folks to take a look at this and create a more complete and accurate movie; but only if they can get the story from the Earnhardt family themselves, that's the only way we'll ever know the true and real Dale Earnhardt. I am looking forward to the bonus features on the DVD in addition to a good, entertaining movie.",1103068800,,6329,4.6873315363881405
2165358,4,B000642008,"""3: The Dale Earnhardt Story"" isn't going to win a lot of non-Nascar fans over to the sport, but as a biography, it is well-made, offers some believable insights on what made Earnhardt the often enigmatic person he was, and, in Barry Pepper, provides an eerily close approximation to the 'look' and 'feel' of the racing legend. Pepper will certainly receive an Emmy nomination for the role, and delivers such a powerful portrayal that you nearly forget how good the rest of the cast is.

While Elizabeth Mitchell is more glamorous than the real Teresa Earnhardt, she is quite solid and believable in the role; to truly appreciate how important Teresa's intelligence and business acumen were to Dale, it would have required a much longer movie, and might have seriously tilted the story away from Dale's other relationships, and the balance that Pepper and director Russell Mulcahy achieved.

Dale's early years come off best in the film, with a wonderful performance by J.K. Simmons as the inspirational Ralph Earnhardt. The grittiness and 'backwoods blue-collar' feel of Earnhardt's upbringing is well-conveyed, and reminiscent of ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" and ""The River"". The film loses a bit of steam when Dale begins racing, and as he achieves success, a lot of memorable moments had to be edited out, or telescoped down, which has disappointed some Earnhardt fans. Considering the time and budget constraints, however, I found the story to be remarkably accurate.

The young actors who portrayed Dale's children as adults should be singled out for recognition; race car driver/first-time actor Chad Mcumbee, while low-key, is pretty impressive as Dale Jr., conveying both a pride in his father, and frustration in being 'held back' so he could complete his education before being permitted to race; Corri English, while too cute, has an infectious smile and manner, and exhibits the Earnhardt joy of fast cars; best of all is newcomer Frank Glidden as oldest son Kerry, who, in a few brief scenes, offers a balanced, sensitive interpretation of the son Dale abandoned, finally winning his father's attention and respect, even as he sees Dale Jr. outshining him on the track. I look forward to seeing more of Glidden's work in future!

While there will certainly be a more detailed and polished feature film about Earnhardt in the future, this ESPN production is not without it's own merits, and provides an entertaining, dramatic overview of the racing legend's life.",1103068800,9,2471,5.108910891089109

I think it could have shown more of the personal side of Dale as far as the all the things he did for other people and the softer side. The movie did make him out to be a hard, kind of cold, person and to hear other people talk about him that really knew him, he was not that way. Overall I think a great effort by the entire cast.

Anyway, I purchased the movie along with ""Any given day - Jr. video"" on Amazon today and it will be a nice treat in my husband's stocking. He and I were avid Earnhardt fans and are now backing Jr. (not for his namesake but for his ability as a driver)

God bless the Earnhardt family and hopefully this movie has their approval. I would love for Teresa to make a movie, since she knew him best.",1102982400,3,1069,4.351758793969849
2165363,4,B000642008,"I wanted to give this DVD 4 1/2 stars but it isn't possible.  This movie gives a different twist on Earnhardt, one that allows us to see into the MAKING of the MAN.  Intimidated himself by his father, Dale intimately knew what intimidation meant.  It stands to reason you can't initimidate, as well as Dale did, without really ""knowing"" what it means.  This movie sheads light on that fact and opens our eyes to deeper demension of our beloved Dale3.  If his dad had not been hard on him, Dale may not have been the man we knew.  This movie also shows the Earnhardt Racing Legacy.  Not just Dale, but Ralph8, Dale3, and Dale Jr8.  It shows how racing was a part of Earnhardt blood ... the passion for it ... the words of their patriarch being passed through the generations ... maybe even to Dale III or Dale IV?  Ralph8 was a legend in his time when NASCAR racing wasn't as big as it is today.  Dale3 an even bigger legend today, and Dale Jr8 the legend to come.  This is something I'm sure most Earnhardt Racing fans have never contemplated until this film.  Sure, we know Dale's racing facts and I would like to relive more of the facts myself.  At the same time, I appreciate any new insight into the INTIMIDATOR.  I want to know it all.",1102982400,2,1241,4.339130434782609
2165364,4,B000642008,Saw the movie on ESPN will be buying the movie soon.  Thought it was a good movie and explored the life of Dale.,1102982400,2,112,3.869565217391304
2165365,4,B000642008,"The movie 3 was set up to be disappointing...A low budget ESPN film...A subject adored by millions....3 generations of memorable moments....and 92 minutes to tell the story.  I wasn't an Earnhardt fan by any means, but you can't have heroes without villains. I AM however a lifelong NASCAR fan ( saw my first race in 1969) That being said, I wanted this movie to cover everything, I would've watched it if it was 4 hours long. The movie did open my eyes to alot of things. I never understood why Kerry Earnhardt seemed to be an outsider, now I know. The movie captures Dale Sr. adequately, but, Dale Earnhardt wasn't the ""oh, he's okay"" driver, you loved him or you hated him. period. And with ALL due respect, no film is ever going to satisfy ALL Earnhardt fans, he was a legend, a modern mythological figure, and given the circumstances, the producers did a good job. I wasn't an Earnhardt fan but, man do I miss him. If you loved the ""Man In Black"" it's no-brainer.....Get the DVD.",1102982400,7,984,4.52808988764045
2165366,5,B000642008,"I watched the movie on ESPN Saturday night. I thought it was VERY GOOD. Being a big Dale Earnhardt fan, now I have to have all the inteviews on the DVD's. I was at the race in 2001 when Dale passed and I cried. I still have tears in my eyes if I see that crash. I did cry at the end of the movie. It brought me right back to that day. I hope everyone enjoys the show as much as I did.",1102982400,2,384,3.5833333333333335
2165367,4,B000642008,"I watched the television debut on ESPN on 12-11-04.  I just want to say what a tremendous job.  They really pleased me with the ending...very tastful and tactful.  Nascar fans know how Big E's life ended and I, for one, am glad they did not actually show it in the movie.  Although it did seem to jump over some large time gaps but I guess it is hard to fit 50 years of life, 7 Winston Championships and the 1 Daytona 500 win into a 2 hour movie!  All in all, I think Big E would be pleased.  Barry Pepper had some ""larger than life"" shoes to fill and I think he did a very good job portraying the ""Intimidator"".  We love you, Big E! My son was 6 at the time of his death and he just doesn't seem as into Nascar without the black #3 on the track and he really enjoyed the movie.  We are Big E fans forever!",1102896000,5,806,3.932098765432099
2165368,3,B000642008,"I just watched the movie on ESPN for the third time and I like it. What they (the writers, actors and director) got right they got exceptionally so. The accents for example, I'm a Southerner, Tennessee not North Carolina, but the accents are good. I especially thought that the actor playing Dale Junior did a great job capturing his speech patterns.

The racing was good, given the fact that it would have been prohibitively expensive to recreate ALL of it. The use of actual NASCAR/ESPN footage really added to it.

Now for what I didn't like. They made Earnhardt look sweaty and sickly for most of the movie, as though they were trying to suggest that death was haunting his every footstep. I didn't know Dale, I'm simply an ESPN-watching fan, but I never thought of him looking or BEING that way. He always looked like he'd live forever, like he knew something the rest of us didn't and that was his shield. In this movie he doesn't look that way.

Also I didn't like that Dale always seemed to be teaching his son a lesson, all the one-liners he heard from his dad. It got a bit predictable and limiting after the first couple.

What they did here, is to focus on the father and son relationships of all the Earnhardt men. That's what this movie is about, go into it knowing that and you won't be disappointed.

Go into it expecting to see EVERYTHING about Dale's life, the racing, the rivalries, the fame, the arrogant, cool, fun side of Dale, and you'll be disappointed.

I found myself thinking that this was pretty good for television but the full-length feature film that will be made some day will be better.

Will they ever MAKE a full length Hollywood movie about Dale? Who knows. Part of me wants them to and part of me doesn't. Not if they can't do any better than the God-awful ""Days Of Thunder"".",1102809600,10,1812,4.5060975609756095
2165369,5,B000642008,"I was genuinely pleased with the quality and realism of the movie ""3"".  Although a great man's life cannot be told in only a couple of hours, it can be well highlighted with good material and casting.  Both Barry Pepper and the young man who played Dale Jr did a great job - time and again I could close my eyes and hear both Dale and Dale Jr. in their voices.  I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see, once more, a moment with The Intimidator.........",1102809600,5,467,4.224719101123595

2165371,3,B000642008,"Bottom line up front:  I would not pay $25 to watch this movie again, but I probably will buy it to see the bonus footage.  Everything I had read pointed to this being really great, but it was a little disappointing.  Barry Pepper did a good job and the actress playing Theresa was good as well.  The actor playing Junior did not have a clue.  They left a major character out until the end, which was the Daytona International Speedway.  The track killed his best friend, which is given about 30 seconds of play.  He had numerous near misses there, and more wins at Daytona than any other driver but he could not win the 500.  The movie gives you no sense of why it was such a big deal for him to win the Daytona 500.  You are also left to figure out for yourself why Dale and Darrell Waltrip are mortal enemies, but at the end of the film Waltrip's brother drives a car owned by Dale.  Too much had to be left out because of time wasted in the beginning, I guess.  Earnhardt is a legend because he drove his way, was the best, and made everyone love him without changing who he was.  I didn't really get that from this movie.  I do have to say that the end was a great bit of filmmaking.  Very haunting without being horrific.  Fading to a white screen and hearing DW ask ""What about Dale, he all right?"" I'm getting chills typing this.  After the broadcast, ESPN hyped the DVD as containing 5.5 hours of footage inculding interviews and race footage.  Depending on the races they use, that alone could be worth buying.",1102809600,18,1520,4.295774647887324
