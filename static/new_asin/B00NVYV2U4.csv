Bought BBC version w/english subtitles from amazon uk for ~27 includes shipping.
Saw first 6 episodes from MHz already and stories are as good as ever. Problem with MHz is the size of subtitles detracts from viewing pleasure (and you can't adjust the size since subtitle is embedded in the video). Other productions have subtitles in an SRT.

Says season 6 in production.

Should receive in 2 weeks or so. The only downside is there is a cliff hanger for Laure where she is in a hospital.
So have wait for season 6 to see what happens.

I hope that those reading this review will forgive my presumption of doing a review before the DVD was actually released. Now in its fifth season `Spiral' a French television police and legal drama set in Paris, we the audience are pretty much the fly on the wall observing the lives and the working practices of certain police officers, lawyers and judges who all work in the `Palais de Justice'. In season five of spiral there are 12 episodes, each episode has a length of 52 minutes. The main narrative here is the investigation into the death of a mother and daughter and is currently our team's main focus, as well as other casework.

The main players are Police Captain Laure Berthaud who is a skilled senior officer who pretty much leads from the front. Once she has the bit between her teeth she has the energy to see any case through, and the willpower to ensure the job is done. However, her methodology and other working practices can at times be considered borderline at best. As a leader of a team, she is very dedicated to her colleagues that are under her command and will pretty much do anything to protect them. She knows how to turn on the charm when needed, all of this bodes well in her professional life - however her private life is pretty much a dogs breakfast. In this series not only has she to deal with her casework but also her working relationship with her colleagues. Unfortunately, her private life is increasingly becoming a very public matter. Laurie's right-hand man is Police Lieutenant Gilles ""Gilou"" Escoffier, both he and the captain are like family and seem to have their own private relationship that at times excludes other officers in the team. However, the lieutenant has his own Gremlins in the form of former drug abuse and past disciplinary enquiries. Police Lieutenant Frdric ""Tintin"" in this season is an officer who seems pretty much excluded out of most things, and for his own reasons seems to want to avoid family and his marriage at all costs. In past seasons, he has been pretty much the stabilising factor from within the tight knit team. However, this season, so far sees him very much out on a limb.

The last three protagonists are pretty much from the judiciary side of the series. There is Lawyer Josphine Karlsson a somewhat cynical individual who in past series always trying to ensure that her position is protected. Ms Karlsson likes the finer things in life and to this end will at times pick up cases that others may avoid. Her dealings have at times gotten into trouble with the police. For Karlsson the police are not to be trusted. Pierre Clment a defence lawyer and Ms Karlsson are very much an item. Clment a former magistrate and he is pretty popular individual amongst his colleagues and to a certain degree the police that he works with. His relationship seems to have a very positive impact on Karlsson, as she seems somewhat reformed - but for how long?

Last, but by no means least Judge Franois Roban, in some ways perhaps one of the most interesting characters, who is a consummate professional, he does not suffer fools and uses thorough working practices, and is meticulous within his own tradecraft. Many find his character cold and calculating his dealings with anybody involved with his casework; he can sometimes come over as being cruel and cold. He values his supposed independence - and at times has attracted the wrath of his seniors for this trait. For him his job is his life, whatever social life he had is pretty much finished with.

In summation then this is a season where mere months after Sami's death, at the end of season 4. Laure is all over the place: moodier than ever, drinking too much, eating badly, 15 weeks pregnant but too caught up in her grief to notice. The judge: seems to be entirely wrapped up in himself, he has grown punitive and blinkered, resolute to be proved right irrespective of the costs. He was not always been this way- but his actions in this case could well have pushed a possible innocent man into a most desperate situation. Spiral has violence and this is part of its landscape, in all its grisly details, but there has been a lot of really violent kicking this series! It is interesting to see the portrayal of the French judicial system at work.

This show still shows it has a lot of mileage left in it and is really worth seeing.",1422489600,13,4382,4.633204633204633
