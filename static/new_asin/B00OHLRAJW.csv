8683598,5,B00OHLRAJW,"I was named after the tugboat in the series but had never seen the show so I ordered it.  I enjoyed the show, thinking about the fact that my mother loved it back in the 50's and liked the name of the tugboat enough that she named me after it.",1494374400,2,243,3.86
8683599,5,B00OHLRAJW,"I purchased this for sentimental reasons because my dad used to watch this show when he was in the Army in the 1950's. He named me after the Cheryl Ann. When I watch the stories, I can almost see my dad watching and see his smile. Some people may not care for the quality of the video, but one  must remember that these were not filmed in high definition back then. It doesn't bother me because I grew up in the era of black & white tv and analog tv. What interested me is seeing what my dad did. Yes, the stories are corny, but that makes it all the better for me.",1490832000,,565,4.0
8683600,5,B00OHLRAJW,"I have  a confession: My name is Cheryl Ann, and I was named after the tug boat on ""Waterfront."" There, I said it. My dad had always told me that I was named after a tug boat. I thought that was the most ridiculous thing I had ever heard. One day, I Googled ""tug boat named Cheryl Ann"" -- and up pops details for this television show. Couldn't resist buying this (and I bought a copy for my Dad, too).

Pretty good show. Of course, mid-fifties tropes included but it was fun to watch.",1485043200,4,484,4.138297872340425
