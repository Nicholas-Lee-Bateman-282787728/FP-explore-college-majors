7837347,2,630308267X,"In this movie, an L.A. detective infiltrates the gritty underworld of a mafia drug-dealing syndicate.  Things get ugly when the mafia declares an all-out turf war on their rival, a Latino drug king.  I don't want to say this movie was poorly made because it wasn't.  It's just that maybe it would have benefited from a bit of fine-tuning.  The movie in itself is decent except the plot becomes too convoluted for its own good, and the narrative becomes garbled.  Consider, for instance, a scene where the detective is fighting a street battle and then the movie instantly cuts to a scene of him making love to his girlfriend.  I guess that symbolized the fact that the man was looking for transcendence or something from all the violence, but that sequence, and the movie as a whole, could have profited from a just a smidgen of subtlety.",976579200,2,838,4.666666666666667
