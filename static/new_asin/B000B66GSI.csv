2402819,4,B000B66GSI,"It's excellent watching the Cardinals battle the Yankees in their last hurrah, or the impossible dream Red Sox in a classic 7 gamer, or watching them battle the Tigers in a classic tale of two different series in one.  Also enjoyed hearing Harry Carey do the narration as well.  Just wished they had released the Cardinals World Series highlights in one complete set like they did for the Yankees and not piecemeal.",1210982400,4,415,4.75
2402820,5,B000B66GSI,"This DVD is a great way for any Cardinals fan to experience or re-experience the 60's-era Cardinals dynasty.  Brock, Gibson, and many other Cardinals greats are all here.  The video pretty much shows the last pitch of each at bat that took place during the three World Series.  This is great because you can watch the whole series quickly, but still follow exactly how the games unfolded.  Great St. Louis baseball nostalgia here -- the old Busch Stadium is referred to as ""brand new"" and ""state-of-the-art"" a few times.  Harry Caray (who started in St. Louis before moving on to Chicago) even narrates one of the films.  All in all just a great DVD -- too bad the Cards couldn't win all three.",1167955200,11,694,4.6016260162601625

2402822,5,B000B66GSI,"If you grew up in the 60's following the St. Louis Cardinals you will love this video.  Great era for Cards fans.  As a 12 year old I attended game seven of the 68 series.  My uncle worked at the Busch Brewery and came across a ticket at the last moment and I mean LAST MOMENT.  He called my dad about two hours before game time and said he wanted to give the ticket to me.  Dad picked me up at school and drove to the Brewery from about 15 miles away.  We picked up the ticket and my Dad dropped me off at the stadium.  I got to the box seat six rows behind the Tigers dugout just before the Cards took the field. Imagine the excitement of a 12 year old at a World Series game by seven by himself.  Although the final result of the game was a bad memory,  just getting to see the game highlights was fantastic.",1392681600,,811,3.95679012345679
2402823,5,B000B66GSI,"I have watched the dvd and it brings back all the GREAT memories of the first time I saw the games live on TV. In 1964 I was only nine years old and it seems like just a couple of years ago. I still remember being in tears, when they lost game 7 in 1968. Would be a great film for any CARDINAL Fan.",1389657600,,298,3.671875

2402827,3,B000B66GSI,"I was looking forward to seeing Gibson's classic World Series performances, but the editing skipped a ton of details. Not the in depth story I was looking for.",1355270400,2,159,4.714285714285714

2402829,5,B000B66GSI,"From 1946 to 1987, the St Louis Cardinals appeared in the World Series on seven different occasions; incredibly, all seven of those encounters went the distance - seven full games before a champion was crowned.  This particular DVD captures all the thrilling action from the three Fall Classics the Redbirds participated in during the 1960s, when a couple of Hall of Fame legends - Bob Gibson and Lou Brock - stole the show for St Louis.

""Stealing"" was of course, Lou Brock's forte; despite stealing nary a bag in the '64 showdown against the New York Yankees, Brock went on to swipe a World Series record fourteen bases - evenly divided between the '67 and '68 match-ups with the Boston Red Sox and Detroit Tigers.  If it seems like Brock was constantly on base, allowing him to run wild against Boston and Detroit; he was!  In the twenty-one games played, Brock hit an astounding .391.  Ironically, one of the most memorable moments involving Brock came in Game Five of the '68 Series, when Detroit left-fielder Willie Horton nailed the Cardinal speedster with a perfect throw at the plate; he chose not to slide, instead trying to leap past catcher Bill Freehan, who applied the swift tag to record the key out.  That play changed the entire momentum of the Series, enabling Detroit to overcome a three games to one deficit, as pitcher Mickey Lolich shocked St Louis in the Game Seven finale; prevailing over the great Bob Gibson.

Gibson's World Series resume is even more impressive than Brock's.  Of the eleven Series games the Cardinals won in the '60s, Gibson was responsible for seven of those victories.  Of the ten games St Louis lost in those encounters, Gibby got the decision only twice; unfortunately, that second defeat in Game Seven in '68 was a heart-breaker; in sharp contrast to the magnificent seventeen strikeout performance Gibson delivered in Game One.

Cardinals fans will not only enjoy the action on the field, but legendary announcer Harry Caray's non-garbled narration as well.  These were three of the greatest World Series ever played; this collection is something any baseball fan will surely cherish.",1329350400,,2134,4.9164345403899725
2402830,5,B000B66GSI,"I just got this and have watched all three of the shows and all are so much fun to watch.  To see Mickey Mantle hit four HRs off the Cards in 1964 was fantastic.  To see Yaz in 1967 after his triple crown year was totally cool.  And Bob Gibson, Lou Brock, Orlando Cepeda, a very young Reggie Smith in 1967 brought back so many memories.  And my fav WS the 1968 with the Tigers.  Al Kaline (hits like he is 20 again), Jim Northrup (hits grand slam), Denny McLain (31 game winner) and Mickey Lolich (won 3 games in series) was awesome.  Bob Gibson again is classic and strikes out 17 Tigers in one game.  Sure the video quality was so so and the sound a bit muddy but were talking 40-44 years ago.  Even the crowd shots were cool.  If you want to see true HALL OF FAMERS playing without steroids just get this and several of the other videos and you will love it.  I'm not even a big Cards, Yanks, Tigers or Red Sox fan...I'm just a big baseball fan and these videos are too cool for school.  Next one I gotta get is the 1972-74 Oakland A's.  PLAY BALL!!!",1211932800,6,1053,4.107843137254902
