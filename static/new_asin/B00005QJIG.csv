DH placed alot of effort into her character and produced a documentary that gives real insite into the dancers.  I had a friend that danced and never really understood the experience, this movie and the documentary opened my eyes.
Thanks DH for taking the time and effort to produce an informative and entertaining piece of work",1038355200,,397,4.739130434782608

1648681,5,B00005QJIG,"How refreshing to see a film that is made as a group effort, that gives as much credibility to the Director (Michael Radford) as it does to the actors (Daryl Hannah, Jennifer Tilly, Sheila Kelly, Charlotte Ayanna, Elias Kosteas, and Sandra Oh) and to the camera men, costumers, etc.  This is a tough slice of life to examine - the sordid existence of the women who work the strip joints in the San Fernando Valley - and the technique of using the improvisational style greatly enhances the feeling of reality.
Each of the characters in this dark film were given enough information about their character to have an outline which they then fleshed out into the richly three dimensional characters we see on the screen.  This takes great courage on the part of a director, but given the quality of talent involved, the payoff is well worth it.  Sandra Oh gives a thrilling performance of a poet-by-day/stripper-by-night and finally has a venue for showing how richly talented she is.  Daryl Hannah turns in a wholly believeable bravura performance as a less than bright yet tender and near delusional young woman in search of a life that makes sense.  Jennifer Tilly gives an over the edge portrayal of a leather-type who perhaps holds more aching tenderness beneath her tough shell that she herself knows.  Sheila Kelly's character just smolders.  All of the actresses have the courage to 'bear it all' in the dance sequences and we can only applaud their commitment to Michael Radford's sense of style.
This is a  much overlooked little movie that will probably surface in the art houses on a routine basis as a film ahead of its time.",1035936000,4,1634,4.7695035460992905
1648682,2,B00005QJIG,"Dancing at the Blue Iguana and the disastrous B. Monkey combine to suggest that director Michael Radford's success with Il Postino was a fluke.
Despite a good cast that includes Daryl Hannah, Charlotte Ayanna and the terrific Sandra Oh, Dancing... is a lumberous, uninspired look at a life in stripping.  What's achieved is not a documentary feel -- well-crafted documentaries, such as Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine, are deliberately paced and meticulously edited to tell their story efficiently.  Dancing... simply looks and feels unedited, events unfolding in excruciating real time.  What the actors talk about tends to ramble on and on as things tend to do in improvisations and unfortunately, Radford also chose to shoot many of these scenes in extended two-shots  allowing for no chance to compress scenes and move them along.  Add that to the ever-atrocious acting of Jennifer Tilly and too long a running time, and it's yet another ""stripper story"" without enough to say.
It's too bad Radford didn't bother to look at his improvisational workshops and actually craft a sharp, well-thought-out script from what the actors bring to the table, because there are quite a few good performers in here.  They just needed thematic focus and better pacing, and without the guiding force of an overarching narrative, Dancing at the Blue Iguana simply rambles on.",1029456000,7,1368,5.195454545454545
1648683,5,B00005QJIG,"This film was made without an actual script but instead grew out of improvisations from an actors' workshop.  I wish someone else would try this technique as it brings a fresh, immediate, quasi documentary feel to the whole work. I've long been looking for a bridge work between documentary and feature film and this may be it. The film is also character driven instead of plot driven because of this original premise.  It is an intense exploration of the underside of the women in the LA strip club scene but it could have been set anywhere.

The actress who nails such a woman leading this life dead to rights is Jennifer Tilly.  You have never seen her in a role like this and would scarcely recognize her as the scheming Jim Carrey client from ""Liar, Liar"" or the woman with the voice worth killing in ""Bullets Over Broadway.""  Her character spins out of control as she finds herself pregnant and in no position to be so.  She has many brilliant scenes but my favorite is when she is in the waiting room at a medical clinic sitting next to an annoying goody two shoes who is an even more pregnant, obviously coddled suburban woman.  Tilly eventually blows up at this woman and ends with a hilarious closing line about her kid will end up selling ""goody's"" kid drugs on the playground some years hence.  In fact, if I had one quibble, it would be that I wish the entire film could have been Tilly's.  Everyone else does a fine job too but I think a lead, sole role by Tilly here could have been Oscar worthy.  Someone should give her a chance to show her full dramatic range again.

1648684,4,B00005QJIG,"OK, so Dancing at the Blue Iguana features wall-to-wall naked gyrating women. But don't let that put you off. Despite the subject matter - the lives of five strippers who work in the eponymous club (played by Daryl Hannah, Jennifer Tilly, Sheila Kelley, Charlotte Ayanna and Sandra Oh) - and the frequent nudity, Blue Iguana is not a T&A movie. Rather, it's a compelling insight into the lives of the underclass of Los Angeles, or indeed, any one of the world's major cities.
If your cinematic tastes run to tightly plotted fare where all the loose ends are tied up with a big gift-wrap bow in the last five minutes, you'll probably it find frustrating. But if you can appreciate a film in which some issues are never quite resolved and some questions are never quite answered - just like real life - then you may be seduced by the Blue Iguana.
The film has been panned by so many critics that I must admit I started watching the DVD with some trepidation, expecting to be embarrassed for the actors. But I became so engrossed in the world of the Blue Iguana that I was actually disappointed when the film ended.
The DVD is very professionally produced. Features include a commentary from director Michael Radford; a second commentary from stars Sheila Kelley, Sandra Oh and Robert Wisdom (who plays the Blue Iguana boss Eddie); Strip Notes, a documentary by Daryl Hannah on how she researched her character in the LA strip club Crazy Girls; and some deleted takes and alternative scenes.
Much of the criticism of Blue Iguana is based on the fact that it was made without a script. The actors started with only two things: the title of the film and the fact that it was set in a strip club. Everything else, they worked out themselves - their characters, their storylines, and their dialogue - in an intense series of improvisational workshops. This approach may be unconventional, but it gives Blue Iguana a freshness and immediacy which is rarely found in mainstream films. As Michael Radford explains in the director's commentary, improv relies on nailing the scene in the first take; once it becomes too polished, it loses its sense of realism.
The female cast has been another target for critics - not because they're not superb actors, but because, in their late 30's to early 40s, Daryl Hannah, Jennifer Tilly and Sheila Kelley would be too old to work as strippers in LA where beautiful young women exist in a buyer's market. But they bring a depth of sadness to their characters - you can't help wondering where they'll be a few years down the track.
Sandra Oh's performance as Jasmine is a standout. Jasmine leads a double life, stripping on the Blue Iguana stage and secretly writing poetry in the dressing room. After persuading her to read one of her painfully beautiful works at his poetry group Dennis (Chris Hogan) starts to fall in love with her mind. But Jasmine realises the fledgling romance is doomed. In the film's most heartbreaking scene, when Dennis seeks her out at the club, she performs her routine to Moby's ""Porcelain"" with its haunting refrain ""So This is Goodbye"". The camera focuses on her face. It's an impassive mask, but her eyes betray incredible sadness. She's wordlessly saying to him, ""This is the real me. Do you still want me now?""
Putting aside its improv-based development, Blue Iguana succeeds on its own merits. If you want to see a T&A film, rent a copy of Showgirls. If you want to see a haunting, thought-provoking slice of life, get hold of the DVD of Dancing at the Blue Iguana.",1013299200,172,3529,4.702746365105008
1648685,4,B00005QJIG,"Okay folks, two things: 1. ""Dancing at the Blue Iguana"" is not another ""Showgirls"", so don't expect to find another Elisabeth Berkeley in there. 2. Amid thousands of cliche-filled Hollywood movies, you will get to appreciate this unconventional filmmaking approach using improvisational workshops done by the actors themselves (as seen in the DVD's documentary). Now about the ""girls"": Okay, Daryl Hannah, Jennifer Tilly & Sheila Kelley might not have reflected the images of young dancing babes in L.A. today, but they all performed their roles quite well. Sandra Oh also did a standout job in portraying the double life of Jasmine/Cathy. And Charlotte Ayanna's voice was no less beautiful than her appearance. (Recalling the fact that she spent 12 years of her childhood in foster homes and won Miss Teen USA in 1993 wearing a $37 evening gown only made me love her even more).",1011484800,2,879,5.068965517241379
1648686,4,B00005QJIG,"The movie was an improv or so I read. It was really quite good and funny in some parts. It mainly was sad showing how stripers were lonely using drugs to fill all the empty spaces, or men, or just plain dreams that never seemed to materialize. The acting was overall pretty good considering that this was all done without having an exact script. I was surprised to see some of the faces in the film, such as Daryl Hannah and Jennifer Tilly. These girls took on some really scary stuff, by getting up in a roomful of men and stripdancing. The dances were very intense and erotic and because I am a girl and was in an audience of mostly men I felt a little, no alot, uncomfortable. There were alot of dances with very little clothing because that was what the movie revolved around, unlike Striptease with Demi Moore, where there was I think maybe one or two times that she actually danced. This movie has endless dance sequences with all the major stars and some minor ones as well. There are also lap dances but they are not as intense as some I have seen in other art films. There was one movie I saw that had the most erotic lap dance ever, it was a movie called The Center of the World. These scenes in the Blue Iguana did not sizzle. But thats ok, I think the movie didn't want to show that side as much as it wanted to show how lost and unhappy these girls were. Some were just plain angry, trapped in a lifestyle they could not escape from. There were some beautiful poems in the film which enhanced the theme of the film. It is definately worth checking out, just be aware there is alot of female nudity! I wouldn't give it 5 stars because there were some parts that dragged, overall I rated it 4 stars.

1648687,5,B00005QJIG,"(...) The very convincing acting outside the strip club counted far more than their perhaps less than comprehensive stripping performance. The whole point of the movie was to not pigeonhole strippers and the excellent acting definitely dovetailed with that. If it's the stripping you're looking for, go get porn. This movie is far too rich to be faulted by something as trivial as 'stripping authenticity'.",1005523200,3,406,5.2615384615384615
1648688,2,B00005QJIG,"This movie had the promise of something wondeful. If is about a strip club and it stars Daryl Hannah, Charlotte Ayanna, Jennifer Tilly, Sheila Kelly and other beautiful actresses. Unfortuneatley like Goldie Hawn's Criss Cross and other stripper movies, the main stars are too self important to degrade themselves with the realistic day to day goings on at a strip club. There is good nudity (face it, that's why guys willwatch this)in regards to Daryl Hannah, Charlotte Ayanna and the nasty looking Sandra Oh but other than that it's not great. The ditzy hannah wants to adopt a baby and she may be being stalked by a Russian hit man with a bad/fake accent. The inside of the Blue Iguana looks NOTHING like a real strip club and if the director is gonna make a movie about strippers he needs to hire some actresses who don't mind taking off their clothes for more then 2 seconds of edited clips. Jennifer Tilly fans, like me, will be sadly disappointed. The movie is not terrible but it could have been great. If you want skin, rent Showgirls.",1000080000,12,1043,4.643243243243243

1648705,5,B00005QJIG,"I watched this thing a second time and it turns out it's a darn good movie. The first time I was paying attention to the stories of Jasmine and the poet, Angel and the Russian, and the rest sort of slipped by me. The second time, the theme comes through loud and clear: humans trying and mostly failing to connect with each other. From Jessie's phone call at the start to her singing near the end. The final scene with the club owner and his assistant walking down the street makes sense. While Angel and the Russian have their lap dance, they are talking but we can't hear them. Sandra Oh (Jasmine) gives a great performance through the whole thing.

It would be easy to dismiss this as just an exploitation of women's bodies. For me all the bare breasts were fine, but this movie has a lot more in it. Very good acting and cinematography combine with a good story to make a film that is well worth watching.",1471737600,6,909,4.347058823529411

Powerful performances, especially from Sandra Oh.

My only complaint is every female character is uber tragic. There are plenty of dancers that don't fit that mold. It's a job. Not every dancer is tragic.",1455062400,3,367,4.71875
1648763,4,B00005QJIG,"This movie kind of remined me of other movies like <Striptease> or <Exotica>By Atom Egoyan. First one was too low graded to be compared and second one was too dark to be compared.
This one was more concentrated in a large number of stripers and they were like families.
All the stripers are very much adorable and make us feel like got to make them know well at the end.
Especially Sandra Oh and Daryl Hannah were really good, More Sandra Oh.
When Sandra Oh was participated in poatry reading meeting and she reads her own poat and tears drops without her knwoledge, that was the great moment from this movie. Also when the leader of the poetry reading group fells in love with her and happens to come to the strip clup calls Blue Iguana and sees her dancing and upset about her being stripped, then he left for good, she cried with tears. That was the sadest part from this movie. And that moment, I felt why many people are talking so muh about Sandra being such a good actress.
when Sandra was dancing naked, she was not beautiful at all. Her makeup was horrible and her dancing was auefull. But when she is acting and delivering the dialogue, she was so shineing like an angel.
Daryl on the other hand was a vunerable woman. i never thought she was beautiful. I saw her first from the legendary film BLADE RUNNER.
I didn't like her face being so many bumpy areas. But as seeing in this film, she has such a beautiful body. She was so sexy. And moreover, she was such a girl like a glass. one touch can make her shattered. That's her main part for her to be loved.
When she saw this man who was in the sit seeing her dancing she falls in love instantly and approach him. He dinies her and instead of making love to her, he gave her a huge money. Daryl was so much surprised. Maybe that man was a gangster or something. But that moment was kind of touchy also.
All the strip dancers look pure and innocent. They never felt like promiscuous or something.
I saw once in LA some strippers on the street. They are so showy-if there's a word like that- they want to look themselves like a hollywod star. I hated them so much.
But these women from this film, they are so lovable.
This movie is so different with other movies dealiing with strip dancers.
It's got class. It's got stories to tell. It's about night life. Something thatnormal people doesn't know.
I am so happy that Korean company paid the guarantee for this dvd and sells for only 2.5$.

1648797,1,B00005QJIG,"The film blows!

So, this film is the result of the actors getting together and improvising...HA! (Cassavetes this is not!). In the ""making-of documentary, `Strip Notes',"" Hannah claims that the director gave the actors only the title of the film and its location, while ""everything else, the characters, the dialogue, and story lines had to come from our imagination."" First major mistake - making Darryl Hannah responsible for something potentially creative, poetic, and aesthetically viable such as a film! The director should have forced the majority of the cast (read: the strippers!) at gunpoint to take a year's worth of acting classes before ever being allowed to improvise or even stand before the camera.

The film blows!

Daryl Hannah as ""Angel"" is even worse here than in the Pope of Greenwich Village (if that's even conceivable). Yes, she's that bad! In ""Iguana"" she dominates the film, she's in nearly every other scene (not stealing scenes, you understand, but rather ruining them!). She pathetically attempts a dumber-than-dumb bimbo (loves children - with a good heart - and is also a stripper), whose supposed deep and enduring qualities will somehow tap into the spectator's pathos. Instead, and not at all surprising, she comes off as totally unbelievable, and beyond, utterly ridiculous. I was actually embarrassed for her while she was (attempting to) act (So in that way, I guess it's fair to state the following: ""On a positive note, her performance did move me!"").

The film blows!

Jennifer Tilly as ""Jo"" is a $#@*&%$ train-wreck! All she does is scream mindless lines at the top of her lungs in a tone and pitch that would make Sam Kinison cringe!

The film blows!

Sandra Oh as ""Jasmine"" is the most despicable of all the characters (poorly conceived, or ""imagined,"" and atrociously portrayed). All Oh does is scowl with the countenance of a grizzled and hardened street-wise chick (who is also, and get this, an aspiring and talented poet!). Come on, in the film her vocabulary is limited to four or five words, all expletives, and yet she writes deeply moving, heartfelt poetry - what a #@%&$*& joke! A bookstore is the last place you'd find this loser of a character. Sorry, the film fails categorically in its attempt to sell the character of Jasmine in terms of a ""tormented, soulful contradiction"" - wholly unbelievable, inconsistent, shallow, and vile, yes, I'll buy that, but a tormented, soulful contradiction, never!

The film blows!

Lastly, there's something of a subplot within the plot going on (I think, but I'm still not completely sure). That being stated, for this phenomenon to occur one needs to at least begin with something resembling a plot - if anyone out there can find the plot, let me know. Morvern Callar 2002, which is another worthless, plot-deprived ""film that blows,"" has more of a story-structure to speak of than this film. That is frightening!

The film blows!

Have I made myself clear?

1648801,3,B00005QJIG,"The movie was OK.  The plot was a little lame, but what can you do with a bunch of emotionally distraught strippers, other than a horror flick.  Beware that there is ample gratuitous nudity to go around (it is a movie about strippers set largely at a strip club.  I bought the movie because I had heard about how Darryl Hannah and the other actresses had worked so hard to learn how to perform exotic dances and was curious to see how accurate this information was.  I have always thought Darryl Hannah has portrayed some very sexy women in quite a few of her previous roles.  In this one she plays an extraordinarily dumb blonde, and she does that quite well, but her dancing wasn't anything special.  She definitely had been working out as evidenced by virually no body fat to be seen anywhere.  This made her look too anorexic.  Jennifer Tilley usually plays the dumb role, but in ""Dancing"" she played the self centered ""[...]"", and she over acted.  Shiela Kelley and Sandra Oh provided reasonable performances and their dancing looked more professional than Darryl Hannah's or Jennifer Tilley's dancing.  If you want to actually see quality exotic dancing (of which the name implies)performed by a woman with the stereotypical female physique, then you have to rely on Charlotte Ayanna and the brief appearance of Kristin Bauer.  Charlotte plays a young woman of relative intelligence(of who's age is questioned when she auditions for the job at the Blue Iguanna to ensure that she is of age) and is somewhat naive due to her youth.  She connects up with and then later gets physically abused by a friend (regular customer) of Darryl Hannahs.  Everything said, Charlotte's acting was ok, but let's face it, she has a voluptuous body and knows how to use it.  Kristin Bauer is hired to dance at the Blue Iguana late in the movie, because one of the dancer's gets killed and one gets fired.  This was probably the best decision made by the casting director.  Kristin plays a seasoned dancer and when she first shows up on screen, you think she has a snobbish, stuck-up attitude with the the other regular dancers.  A little later you discover that she has a serious drug problem when Darryl walks in on her shooting up heroin between her toes.  At that point, you realize that she was very stoned when she first appeared.  In her brief, appearance she proves to be friendly and the best thing is that she has a killer body and dances like she made a living stripping before she started acting.  The price of the movie was worth seeing her dance.

Finally, if you would like to see Kristin Bauer and Charlotte Ayanna, two very sexy beautiful women, strip, this is the movie for you.  Otherwise, I would wait until I was bored and maybe spend the 90 minutes or so killin time watching this movie.",1257379200,2,2796,4.640243902439025

The acting and character portrayals were all phenomenal, and the soundtrack alone was awesome. You felt you knew these five women, and that you could perhaps be their friend. You are sucked into the world of stripping and the atmosphere at the Blue Iguana. The gritty scenes and glimpses of L.A., and the lifestyles of the girls, adds to the realism of their lives, the loneliness, the struggles, and the reality of a life most people wonder about. I am very picky about the movies I like. I cannot stand it when movies depict for instance, poverty, but then the furnishings that the so-called ""poor"" character has, are not realistic. This movie does none of that. There is no shallowness, no overly glamorous shots or depictions.

3 of the actresses (Hannah, Oh, and Kelley) are way too old to be strippers.  Yes they look great for their ages, but they wouldn't cut it in a strip club with younger competition.

Strippers aren't all a mess, and yet the ones at this club are.  Very unrealistic.

No men would go to a strip club where the women kept their bottoms on.

There is no point to this movie other than to apparently moralize that stripping is a depressing road to nowhere. But the reality is that many  strippers are pretty much normal women with normal lives, they can just make a heck of a lot more money stripping than doing anything else.

AVOID !",1219708800,3,718,4.220588235294118
1648805,4,B00005QJIG,"Dancing at the Blue Iguana is a film whose story was developed during a five month improvisational workshop run by director Michael Radford.  The story centers around the Blue Iguana, your average seedy strip club, this one located in a faceless semi industrial area of the San Fernando valley part of LA.  Each of the lead actors developed their own character and storyline based on their own research.

There have been a couple of pathetic attempts by Hollywood to make a film about the world of strip clubs, namely Showgirls and Demi Moore's abhorrent Striptease, but both of those failed miserably.  Dancing at the Blue Iguana succeeds brilliantly.  Walk into any average to below average strip club in America and you'll find stories that are not at all dissimilar from the stories developed by the Blue Iguana's five dancers all played brilliantly by Darryl Hannah, Sandra Oh, Charlotte Ayanna, Shiela Kelly and Jennifer Tilly.

The one story element that sticks out as overly fantastic is that of the Russian hit man played by Vladimir Mashkov, who because his target is being held for questioning by the FBI, is stuck in a hotel next to the club and falls for Darryl Hannah's character because he sees her smoking outside the club all the time.  But if you replace the Russian hit man with a businessman stuck in town for a week, it still makes sense, and would be much more believable.

Robert Wisdom who plays Eddie, the owner of the club, and W. Earl Brown, who plays his right hand man, Bobby, both do a wonderful job in this movie as well.  The camera work is first rate and does a fantastic job capturing the unscripted dialogue.  The soundtrack is perfect for this film.

In a film about strip clubs, there is obviously going to be a lot of nudity, and there is in this film, but it's not done in a gratuitous way.  The film also kind of starts and ends in the middle of each of the stories, but that's the way life is.  I found it just absolutely compelling and rivetting, in some sense the way a train wreck is compelling, because some of these young women have real problems.  I could have watched another two hours of this, though, it was that good.

Strip clubs are often sad places, both the dancers and their customers often have melancholy tales. Dancing at the Blue Iguana captures that milieu in a perfectly downbeat way.  Really a great film.",1171670400,16,2368,4.615751789976134
1648806,4,B00005QJIG,"Prior to watching this, I expected something on par with ""Striptease"" or ""Showgirls,"" which are films about stripping that also attempt to legitimize their titillation by tossing in dramatic subplots. Even with earnest intentions, films of this sort usually end up being clichd and disappointing. Adding to my trepidation was the fact I had never heard of this film, which was released in 2000, prior to 2006. I finally took a chance on it and gladly admit that it really drew me in and convinced me to care about the characters. Like most people, these women only want to find love and something real in life, yet have lost their centers. Indeed, it is the actresses' portrayals of these characters that make each disappointment and set-back so painful to watch. Sandra Oh really moved me with her performance as Jasmine, a would-be poet who sabotages her own happiness because she has come to believe she cannot trust anyone, including herself. Her performance as a sensitive, intelligent person is the most tragic among these lives because she lacks the confidence to escape her current situation, even though she easily could. As Angel, Darryl Hannah is wonderful as a helplessly dim and hopelessly optimistic dreamer. (She also looks unbelievably fit!)  Jennifer Tilly is also very good as the out of control Jo, a woman who tries desperately to win in a man's world, but comes to realize the playing field is not level. Charlotte Ayanna is remarkable as Jessie, an eager to please naf, who has not yet had her spirit crushed by the weight of the world. Come to think of it, it does all sound very clichd and there really isn't much of a plot to tie it all together, just several subplots. Nonetheless, the acting is exceptional, made all the more impressive by the fact much of it is improvised. (And yes, the ladies here all smoke, which would ostensibly account for their trim appearances) I enjoyed the entire two hours and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good character study without the hindrance of a plot.

And yes, Damnit, I'm in love with Sandra Oh!",1133654400,3,913,4.7784810126582276
1648812,5,B00005QJIG,"i watched this film twice today, which is always what happens when a film touches me; i immediately want to watch it again. and i got to this site because i was looking for the ost, but anway, here's what i thought; the acting was perfection, the story a beautiful observation, the dancing seductive and melancholic and overall the film gave a very real potrayal of the difficult choices many women make for themselves, their consequences, and how they deal with these choices in light of both mudane everyday reality and the hyper reality of nightlife. i laughed, cried and all that stuff.  then i watched all the dvd extras. and then i watched it all again. it was well worth the guy in the video shop giving me a funny look at the checkout. any girl whose ever daydreamed about stripping (you know who you are)  should watch this film. not to change your mind, but just to have a look see. it'll give you a new empathy and sympathy for all women in the industry. and it'll make you want to work out for a tighter ass.",1131148800,5,1020,4.391534391534392
1648813,4,B00005QJIG,"It's easy to dismiss the residents of the seedier addresses of our culture.  But the ""Blue Iguana"" makes us look behind the pasties, not to just the flesh, but to the real stories of these women.  Whether caustic and hard, crippled and soft, or just plain exhausted, Blue Iguana skillfully pulls us into places we might not otherwise go, and shows us how much we DON'T see. Most notable are Jennifer Tilly, (who is in my opinion the 21st century's Marilyn Monroe), and Sandra Oh.  Oh delivers a breathtaking and heartbreaking performance as Jasmine, an intelligent and talented poet who dances because the money's better than waitressing.  While it's definitely easier to believe the somewhat stereotypical Darryl Hannah character(Angel, the deadly gorgeous but warm-hearted dingbat), Jasmine embodies the range of possibilities for each of the characters, and for all of us.  Without apology or fear, this is a terrific portrait of woman's resiliency, courage and spirit.",1128988800,3,972,5.205128205128205
1648814,1,B00005QJIG,"I bought this movie only because I will be taking Sheila Kelly's S Factor classes and I wanted to see ""real"" performers in action without going to a seedy club.  I found this movie to be completely boring and senseless.  The acting was poor, the storyline senseless.  Ah, but the sountrack was interesting - some really good songs on it.  At the very least, I got what I was looking for - an overview of the dancing before my classes begin.  Aside from that - I'd give it zero stars if I could for sheer boredom and stupidity.  As the club's owner says to Jasmine at the end of the movie ""You have no life!  This IS your life!""  That says it all.  What am empty existence.",1122249600,5,672,4.228346456692913
1648815,4,B00005QJIG,"Too many people (including myself) passed this by upon its release, and thankfully with the advent of Video and DVD, it may get a second shot at life.
Cast off any aspersions that this is another T&A movie.  There is nudity, but it's (for the most part) tastefully done, and not always gratuitous.  Unlike such moronic fare as ""Striptease"" or ""Coyote Ugly"", this film aspires to much higher ground, more along the lines of Atom Egoyan's brilliant ""Exotica"".
*side note* like that film, it includes a lot of Leonard Cohen and features noted Canadian character actor Elias Koteas!  Coincidence?
Daryl Hannah acquits herself admirably, and Jennifer Tilly does a great job of combining pathos and comedy (the S&M scene is hysterical), but the standout here is Canadian actress Sandra Oh (""Last Night""), who plays outside of type and has you alternatively seduced and saddened along with her character.
Not to be ignored; rent it, then tell a friend.  Films like this are few and far between.",1070150400,63,987,4.927710843373494
1648816,1,B00005QJIG,"This has to be one of the worst films I've ever had to witness. Slow and very boring. For its subject matter the film is very un-sexy and has many many flaws. The main one being the truely dire acting courtesy of Daryll 'Splash' Hannah and Jennifer 'Bride of Chucky' Tilly who's character is obnoxious and annoying. I could not possibly reccomend this film it ... big time and you will be very disappointed if you rent this one out, never mind buying it!",1050624000,6,454,4.416666666666667
1648817,3,B00005QJIG,"Or a couple days.  This well-meaning film gives us a decent look as to what is probably a realistic view of the life of a stripper.  Unlike ""Striptease"", which takes a more comical view and tries to throw in some social issues as well, this one takes a more documentary-like approach to the subject.  While insightful, it doesn't match ""Striptease"" for total entertainment value.
The big problem is that there is not much plot.  We see characterizations.  There is the wild, uncontrollable one who is headed for a crash-landing in life, especially when she finds she's pregnant and insists on smoking in the pre-natal doctor's office.  There is the nice, but very dumb one who thinks that just because she thinks kids are cute, would qualify as a foster parent even though the kids would be treated like cute stuffed animals.  There's the poet who shows her sadness on stage, and shows big reluctance when it comes to relationships.
The movie also shows the very thin line to prostitution in the biz, and while stripping itself pays very well, going beyond that is even more lucrative, albeit with risks.  There is a hint at the tie to organized crime.  Of course drugs are all over the place, not only because the girls can afford them, but it either eliminates boredom or helps buffer the guilt some of them have about what they do.  Finally, there is the issue of overly possessive men, be it former acquaintances or customers.
All of this is presented in a somber, realistic manner.  But maybe too somber.  And no real plot to tie it all together.  There is little joy shown in the lives of these women.  While I'm sure they are accurate portrayals of many types in the life, these are still young, good-looking women making a lot of money, and there has to be some degree of security in this.  ""Striptease"" might have shown an overly optimistic view of the life, but thousands of women make their living this way, and it can't be as bad as portrayed in this movie for all of them.
On the ""eye candy"" front, very, very good.  We do get, among others, Darryl Hannah, Jennifer Tilly, and the lady from ""Arliss"" all going down to their g-strings, and the views are generous.  The big star they bring in at the end is also a knockout.  While they fall short of it being an all-nude club, those wanting to view it just for the ""good parts"" will not be disappointed.",1046649600,5,2364,4.561611374407583
1648818,4,B00005QJIG,"This portrayal of the lives of a group of strip-club employees works simultaneously on several levels.  Initially, I would be remiss if I didn't confirm the obvious expectation that the film is titillating.  There are no portrayals of sex, but there are plenty of scenes with scantily clad beautiful women.  But there is another less visceral side to the movie as well.  This film is the result of an improvisational process whereby the actors were empowered by the director to fill out its skeleton script.  Listen to the commentary for details.  Radford explains (often redundantly) the entire process in detail.
But the movie also works as a fairly realistic cinema-verite slice-of-life piece about the lives of those on the periphery of the sex industry.  In fact, judging from the director's commentary and Darryl Hannah's documentary (included on the dvd), much research went into the details that make this film convincing.  Of course it doesn't all work.  It would be impossible considering the risks inherent in the improvisational process.  There is a subplot about one of the strippers and her relationship with her brother that is not quite carried off.  There are several scenes where minor characters seem to miss their marks.  On a few occasions the dialogue becomes stilted or meandering.  But overall this is a very enjoyable film with some strong performances.  This is an exceptionally good set piece for the talents of Darryl Hannah (talents in fact that I would have never foreseen).  Humorously, in one of her ad-libbed scenes, Hannah references Pulp Fiction, and how it revived John Travolta's career.  If the film industry were a just operation, then this film would lead to more opportunities for the much-maligned Hannah.",1039564800,3,1747,5.120141342756184

7950755,4,B00005QJIG,"I picked the movie for Hannah and Tilly mainly. Otherwise I wouldn't have given it a chance. I liked it. What about it did I like? The reality of it. It's not a flashy life, and any young woman that thinks that is way wrong. What will they do when they get older and their looks are gone, the drugs have taken their toll and have been used by countless men? They tear down their souls. They are living in the moment though, and you can't plan out everything in your life. It's like you live to prepare to die. So, 4 stars, for the movie, not just because of Hannah and Tilly, but for the reality of what it is. Should have made a part two showing then ten years down the line, but I think they did the movie to get themselves out there. Both of the actress's I named have dropped off the radar.",1521158400,,794,4.063694267515924
