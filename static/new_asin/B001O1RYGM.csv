3725744,5,B001O1RYGM,"A few of my friends recommended this movie to me.  Having read the latest review I was hesitant to waste 2 hours of my life watching it.  I can honestly say that I am very happy that I did.  The acting was very truthful and the story had me thinking and feeling things that I never have before. I really must say that the person commenting on the production of this film must have been watching the wrong film.  Also, if your going to write a review to try to sound smart please know what you are talking about.  Autofocus?  I believe that is used on little camera's you buy at Costco right? And if you hated the movie so much why did you bother watching the behind the scenes clips??  Sounds like you just want to be heard.  For everyone else who isn't a failed film school student and actually wants to go on an emotional journey of a new kind, I highly recommend this movie.",1238025600,2,877,4.209580838323354
3725745,5,B001O1RYGM,"Aside from Peace Arch trying to market this as a sex flick, the film is actually a well made relationship film. The cover art (front and back) actually shows eight out of the nine sexually related/themed scenes in the film, and the trailer relayed the same, but I understand what sells. To be up front, there is actually no real nudity in this film, so the R rating is mostly for the prolific language and adult themes.

The story centers on an open relationship between two young adults that enjoy having outside sexual flings and occasional long term romances with others. The film follows their escapades, family and friend support groups around them, and the inevitable fallout as feelings are developing beyond the standard fare. All the leads (including the new Mr. Superman, a JLo twin, and other good looking young people) play their roles very well and actually make you feel for the events they are playing - no matter how awkward.

For an independent production, the quality of the picture and sound were adequate and I have read where quite a few people are happy to see their Kansas City town competently preserved here. The supplements were thorough, including deleted scenes, commentary, a behind the scenes (actually the weakest link as the ""video diary"" dryly narrated by a few of the staff made it mundane) and a music score piece.

A worthwhile twenty to thirty-something film that was made with a professional look and some up and coming new stars.",1237593600,5,1468,4.817460317460317
3725746,4,B001O1RYGM,"I saw Fling*, with a fellow Kansas City native, at the Newport Beach Film Festival. When living in Los Angeles, I found I was constantly defending my hometown's charm. This movie can now do it for me. It's beautifully shot, charming and pretty damn funny. Fling* proves Kansas City is just as rad as I boast. This film was worth the ticket price, the resulting way too expensive flight home and now, the DVD. It's a movie a romantic comedy lover can convince her cynical boyfriend to go to and love. Especially if you're not from KC, you have to see this movie.",1234656000,3,561,4.456310679611651
3725747,5,B001O1RYGM,"I think the movie is fast paced and racey in a very fun way.  I loved the character Olivia,(played by Shoshana Bush) she is young, yet sophisticated and funny.  She is adorable and you can't help but love her. Mason (Steve Sandvoss) was also great.  The connection Olivia and Mason had felt very real. There was a lot of great connection with the entire cast as well. I highly recommend this film and can't believe it is not going to be in the theaters.",1234656000,3,453,4.369047619047619
3725748,4,B001O1RYGM,"I was lucky enough to see Fling when it was playing in theaters. I grew up in Kansas City, and I have to admit that I never had any idea the the city could be this beautiful. KC has a special place in my heart, and the filmmakers nailed some of my favorite things about KC including the awesome scene shot at The Peanut on Main. The director, John Stewart Muller, is originally from Kansas City, and it shows. The locations fit the story well. The biggest surprise of all: Fling is one of the funniest movies I saw all year. Nick Wechsler turns in a star-making performance that almost made me pee my pants a couple of times. This little movie got WAY overlooked by everybody.",1234310400,4,676,4.330708661417323
3725749,4,B001O1RYGM,"Fling is a movie about a young sexy couple who believe that they can have an open relationship and jump in and out of bed with others at whim. She begins to fall in love with a former boyfriend. He, on the other hand, is obsessed with lust and sex and wants to bed any girl he can.  Their relationship is stretched to the breaking point and eventually something has to give.  Will they survive their lifestyle?  This movie sexually teases you from beginning to end. Excellent performance by Steve Sandvoss and Courtney Ford.  Brandon Routh also turns in an excellent performance.
The movie is worth seeing. You won't be bored. It is fast-paced sexual tease all the way through.",1232755200,11,677,4.616666666666666
3725750,5,B001O1RYGM,"I was at the premier for this movie at the newport beach film festival!
This movie is a fantastic representation of open relationships- if you like HBO style shows and movies, you will like the writing, filming, and controversy of this movie! Brandon Routh is a star in this and leaves his beginnings as superman far behind!",1232064000,3,324,4.701754385964913
3725751,4,B001O1RYGM,"The perfect couple that lives by the ideal of detachment from jealously, rides out every other human emotion as they play dangerous games with the people around them.  I like both the American title of ""Fling"" and the International fitting title of ""Lie to Me"".  It is a movie that is true to life with no real heroes or villians, just people that are dealing by either growing or not growing from the situations put in front of them.  Shot in Kansas City, this film was genuine enough to feel like it was simply some of my friends telling me about how they got to where they are now.

The ""open"" couple Mason and Sam are introduced in a Kansas City loft-style apartment, getting ready to leave for a wedding where they both find another love interest.  Mason actually encourages James to hit on his girlfriend, Sam, as he talks to his best friend's (and agent's) 18 year-old sister, Olivia, who grew up with a crush on him.  Mason and Sam stay together at the end of the night in hotel room and through out the movie.  However with a strange love for each other, but no commitment, they spend the rest of the movie seeking out ""open"" interests.",1250380800,3,1145,4.44976076555024
3725752,4,B001O1RYGM,"""Fling"" is one of those ""sleeper"" hits. The kind of movie that doesn't have blockbuster appeal, but creates its own cult following on the DVD scene.  Why? Because it challenges conventional thinking in ways that frighten mainstream mores.  To engage in romantic relationships, where each party isn't attempting to the own the other, is counterintuitive to our Judeo-Christian socialization.  ""Fling"" makes an overt commentary that might be missed by the typical viewer--conform or be alone.  Granted, it's difficult to be emotionally detached and compartmentalized when feelings emerge in relationships. But, does the emotional conflict derive because we legitimately feel expectations from love or have we been socialized to respond a certain way, because of the societal scripts we read from? If we respond emotionally from the framework of our socialization, I suspect it'll be the later--we feel emotional connection from our psychological scripts.

""Fling"" attempts to dissect and explore the emotional possibilities of ""Free Love."" In keeping with conventional wisdom, Hollywood let's the explorer lose in the end. Not because the idea is preposterous, but because ""Free Love"" would disrupt life as we know it.

I highly recommend ""Fling"" to the intellectually enlightened.

3725753,4,B001O1RYGM,"I wasn't sure that I would like this movie when I rented it, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It made me think about things that normally I wouldn't have (I love it when a movie does that).  Does anyone know where to find the soundtrack?  I am rarely impressed with movie soundtracks but this one was excellent!",1247961600,3,311,4.421052631578948
3725754,3,B001O1RYGM,A movie that explores modern relationships between those now in their twenties. The idea of an open relationship might seem weird or unnatural to some and the movie explores this notion and tries to show the reasoning behind being in an open relationship.,1241740800,2,255,4.953488372093023
3725755,5,B001O1RYGM,"Fling is a fun ride about life. The characters are engaging, and ended up surprising me-which doesn't happen often in films. We talked about the film for days afterwards, and I love that!",1241740800,2,187,4.696969696969697
3725756,3,B001O1RYGM,"Pretty good movie, decent acting, I'm always amazed at how natural some inexperienced actors are, none of the leads have done that much, yet seemed very believable in their respective rolls.",1240617600,2,190,5.161290322580645
3725757,5,B001O1RYGM,I saw this movie at the Newport Beach film festival...Simply put it's a different kinda love story that makes you think?? Well done!!,1239321600,2,133,4.826086956521739
3725758,5,B001O1RYGM,"I was really caught off-guard by Fling. From looking at the poster and tagline alone, I hoped I wouldn't be going into a raunchy, shallow romp through sophomoric sexual 'hijinks' filled with all them sexy young honies shakin' their booty-thangs for hairy-palmed mouth breathers and aberrant frat boys across the nation.

What I got instead of that was a thoughtful, down-to-earth look at the modern relationship, and the passion, joy, and most of all confusion that goes into it. In fact, it addresses human relationships, love, and sex so intelligently and honestly that I can't believe it got released.

Naturally, there's still a whole bunch of sex in Fling, but it manages not to be a sexploitation flick, in the same way that it's funny, but not a romantic comedy. It's just a film about people being people, having people problems and dealing with them in less-than-heroic ways. For a while I forgot I was watching a movie. Part of that was because the actors gave a surprisingly convincing performance, but the cinematography played a major role as well. Going with the hand-held style lent a great deal of intimacy and gravity to the events and characters depicted in the movie, and made me feel as if I was a close friend standing in the room, watching things fall apart between my best buds. It also worked to separate the film even further from the big-budget Hollywood flicks that it will inevitably be lumped in with.

Fling was a very new experience for me, a unique film that confronted an important aspect in our culture that virtually no one else in film has addressed with any degree of grace or understanding. A true labor of love. I highly recommend that you scoop up your significant other(s), sit down with them and give this film a watch, and recommend even more that you talk about it afterward.",1238889600,7,1819,4.75
3725759,4,B001O1RYGM,"I was impressed with this movie. Given the premise of ""open relationship"" for the main characters, I did not expect to like them much but I did. The acting is very good. I liked seeing Routh in this thoughtful role and the other two leads are terrific. Good supporting characters.
I also thought the photography was beautiful and was surprised that the sexual situations between characters were done with a sense of intimacy without a lot of actual nudity! Very sexy.",1238716800,3,467,4.777777777777778
3725760,5,B001O1RYGM,"I very much enjoyed this film!  Fling* takes a very realistic and brutally honest look into the world of open relationships, while still maintaining a light-hearted sense of humor about it.  The casting was fantastic, and I found myself immediately sucked into the storyline.  You really feel for the characters' situations.

Filming-wise, some might feel (as one reviewer wrote) that the instability of the camera is a downfall. But I personally enjoyed the method in which the film was shot. It was a personal touch that gave the film a style all it's own. Very HBO/IFC.

And Kansas City is absolutely beautiful!  You can tell the director has a love for the place. It was VERY beautifully shot!

It's a shame this film did not receive more theatrical recognition! I could very easily have seen it playing in the independent film theaters in New York City! It would have done so well in the IFC theater in Greenwich Village!",1238371200,3,926,4.786163522012578

8328786,5,B001O1RYGM,"I saw this one on cable late one night and was mesmerized from the beginning to end. It is a very sexy and sad roller coaster ride that is both funny and sad that makes you wonder what you would do and who you would go with.  A couple with an open relationship meets 2 people separately that they have a hard time saying no to. The male half can't stay away from his best friends sister, he knows she is trouble, but he can't say no and she will not take no for an answer. His other half meets someone too and she is torn between the two men each has qualities that the other does not have. Brandon Routh who dropped the ball in Superman Returns plays one of the men and is really good and believable here. He deserves some credit for his portrayal. I find myself watching this over and over and sometimes I wouldn't mind an alternate ending thought I do like how everyone ended up.",1409270400,2,882,4.157894736842105

When each one meets someone else, lies and untold truths start being told and each of them start questioning if having an open relationship is healthy and if it will work. Twists in the plot thicken when friends are involved and Samantha discovers she is pregnant. Can everyone ever figure out what being in love is really about?

I really liked this movie. It is deep, kind of dark, and very emotional. Well written with good actors. If you like the movie Garden State you will definately like this movie.",1332201600,2,673,4.752136752136752
8328790,1,B001O1RYGM,"If you haven't already done so, watch Latter Days, in which Sandvoss gives a touching and heartfelt performance. In this film, this Harvard grad can't do much with the vapid party talk, mind-numbing, chattery and hollow ""script"". This film is so poor that, by comparison, ""Gossip Girls"" seems like a doctoral dissertation. Well, I gave you my take on this DVD, now choose your poison... LOL",1313625600,2,390,4.924242424242424
8328791,1,B001O1RYGM,"This is one of those movies one is either going to love or either going hate - no in between. As for me, I hated the movie. The only other movie that I would consider on a parallel plane as far as drama goes is Requiem for a Dream. I believe it necessary to review, at least in part, Requiem for a Dream in order to contrast it to Fling.

Before I begin the review I believe it necessary to state that the two situational contexts which I'm most emphatic about are as follows; situations which involve substance abuse or situations which involve human sexuality.

Requiem for a Dream seemed to be a classic example of bad situations gone worse; the acting was great and couldn't have better shown the dark reality of those addicted to or involved with drugs. While some saw Requiem as unnecessarily pessimistic, I saw it as a harsh reality.

Now for Fling, lets start off with the good. The atmosphere was superb, the acting was flawless, and had the drama was very intense. Now, before you dismiss my review as an unsubstantiated contradiction, let me explain what the bad (in my eyes) was.

Obviously, the movie was about open relations, hence the title. The issue that I have is that the plot (in my opinion) exemplifies the most pessimistic decisions the characters in the movie could possibly make. Every character in the movie is not only immature and selfish but also lacks any ability to contemplate the actions of their consequence or the capacity to take five seconds out out of their day to contemplate their future.

Essentially, I find it grossly offensive that most of the public is going to view this as an archetype for open relationships as oppose to its out of context atypical application in the real world. And yes, I know the point of the movie was to show the bad, dramatic side to open relations; I just feel they took it to an extreme, one which made me feel particularly uncomfortable.",1251417600,7,1910,4.573099415204679
