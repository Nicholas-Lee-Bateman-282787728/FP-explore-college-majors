8175970,4,B00080C6BI,"A NICE JOURNEY with this BIKE-O-VISION, PUERTO RICO DVD.... You get everything with this, its non stop action all the way. From the pretty little towns of Puerto Rico, to out in the countryside, with all its tree lined roads and much more. What a beautiful place that it is, I loved the quaint little town of OLD SAN JUAN, with the brightly painted buildings of many different colors, and the tiny balconys above, I adore the narrow cobblestone streets. But i cant figure out where all the people are? they don't seem to be around. And it looks a very nice blue sky day too. As we leave the little town we go through a strange tunnel that comes out on to a courtyard. We leave the towns behind, and travel out to the countryside. This is where the journey begins to speed up. We are traveling very fast now, Maybe TOO fast. We are in bushland, everything looks very green. There are narrow winding roads, lined with trees of lovely colors, i see pretty red and orange colors of the trees. A dog has suddenly rushed out and barked at us, it gave me a fright. All this has been a great experience for me.  The music that accompanys this film is VERY BEAUTIFUL LISTENING.",1336953600,3,1168,4.382488479262673
8175971,3,B00080C6BI,"Well, it's a great travel video of Puerto Rico, with awesome scenery. It's well balanced with vibrant, busy towns and beautiful rural areas with lush vegatation and quaint communities. There is a small tunnel that you go through and even a barking dog that tries to chase you.

However, as a ""Bike-o-Vision"" product, I bought it specifically for indoor cycling and found it to be way too fast for me to cycle to. I had to return it because I could not appropriately bike to it. The speed is much more that of a car cruising up and down the roads. While this may or may not be a big deal to some, for me it rather defeated the whole biking experience. I found that I could not use it for it's intended purpose.

Still, awesome scenery.",1294790400,5,734,4.350364963503649
