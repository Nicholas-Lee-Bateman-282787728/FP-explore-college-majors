8280644,3,B001AZIX4Y,"When I look for DVDs, my intention is to find something I can use for presentation to a group for discussion of forgiveness. This one is very powerful, but not good for group purposes because the accents are difficult to understand. Not a criticism, really, because it couldn't be done without the reports of those who suffered the experiences, but a negative when considered from the point of view of my hoped-for usage.",1228953600,,421,4.780821917808219
