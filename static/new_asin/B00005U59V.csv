7954204,4,B00005U59V,"The movie quality is not great but ""Dang"" is one of those films you want to like. it's got a positive and timely message about abstinence for teens and college aged, has decent technical ability, and is injected with plenty of good ole' fashion humor. Yet ""Dang"" is one of those films that will only be acceptable to some, despite the positive biblical message.

I know of several other Christian videos that also deal with such topics from various approaches, including: ""Searching for True Love"", Pamela's Prayer, ""Sex, Love and Relationships"" and ""Only Once"". ""Dang"" stands apart in that it is a comedy and a step in a new direction for Christian film, but I'm afraid the crudeness of the film will be too much for any conservative Youth Pastor or church.

It is a short film (18 minutes) comedy geared toward upper teens, college age or adults.",1272672000,,848,4.722972972972973
