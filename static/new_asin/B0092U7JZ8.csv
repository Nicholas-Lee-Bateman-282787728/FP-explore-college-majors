8534882,5,B0092U7JZ8,"Good acting, crisp writing, nicely photographed, with interesting special features as well: what more can you want from a documentary about a civil war battle? I enjoyed this thoroughly. There is a lot here for your money: While ""The Devil's Own Two Days"" is only 54 minutes, the bonus features add up to at least that much time themselves. One looks at the re-enactment of the battle on its 150th anniversary, and that is the least interesting. There's one about the making of the project, and one about the Union Pacific train that took some of the re-enactors to the location, and another with a fine explanation of the battle. The ""Devil's Own Two Days"" aims to pack an emotional wallop, and does. This bonus doc describes the fight more as a history lesson, and a good one at that.",1361836800,5,786,4.621428571428571
