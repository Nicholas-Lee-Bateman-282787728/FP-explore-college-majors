4621231,5,B0059XTV4Y,"Modanna has created two movies in one.  One a masterpiece and the second a soap opera that looks like a bad made for TV cable battered wife film.  The Masterpece is the romance of Wallace for Edward . A stunning period piece lead by Andrea Riseborough.  Ms. Riseborough makes Wallace a women you can't take your eyes off of. Wallace says she is not a beauty, but delivers the allusion of beauty by clothing and presence.  That is 100% true of Riseborough performanc. When she is on the screen this movie is impossible to turn away from. Unfortunally when the other story line is on the screen all you want is the romote controle to change the channel. Bad Script, bad acting and nothing to make it worth your time.  But even as bad as the modern story line is ; this is a film not to be missed, but only for the Wallace and Edward parts......so suffer through the other half ....it is well worth the troble to see Ms. Riseborough performance.  Her ""Twist "" dance at the end is charming and funny and heartbreaking all at one! She gets the 4 stars for her Wallace!  A women a king could not live without!",1333238400,8,1103,4.351219512195122
4621232,2,B0059XTV4Y,"The story of Wallis Simpson and King Edward VIII is a fascinating one. Even as they passed through The King's Speech in a supporting storyline(played then by Guy Pearce and Eve Best), the idea of a monarch giving up his throne to be with his multi-divorced, American socialite lover is the stuff storybook romances are made of. Madonna, who co-wrote the script and makes her first feature directorial effort since 2008's Filth and Wisdom(which nobody saw and for good reason), clearly sees something of herself in Wallis, a woman who to the very lenient was an innocent bystander as the American paparazzi skewered her on a regular basis. More critical eyes will note Wallis' guile and opportunistic nature in all things, but most obviously in how she used her charms to woo her way into the upper echelons of society, even if it meant thrusting England into a constitutional crisis at a time when it could least afford it. The various interpretations of Simpson and Edward's scandalous affair is part of what makes them so intriguing, but Madonna has no interest in exploring any of that, content only with the thinnest representation as possible.

Yet, Madonna's decision to present such an idealized view of Wallis(Andrea Riseborough) and Edward(James D'arcy), the future King of England, would have been tolerable if not for the questionable way in which she chooses to tell it. Divided into two separate but connecting stories, one set in 1998 and following poor Wally Winthrop(Abbie Cornish), the beleaguered wife of an arrogant but highly successful doctor. Essentially a trophy wife, Wally endures his emotional and physical abuse, even as she struggles to get pregnant through a series of fertility injections. Finding an emotional void in her life, Wally becomes obsessed with the story of Wallis and Edward, which she sees as the perfect fairy tale romance. Unable to resist hovering around a collection of their personal belongings up for auction, she looks for answers to her own problems by looking at their pasts, and in the process maybe finds new love with a surprisingly astute security guard(Oscar Isaac).

Slipping back and forth through time to draw some rather slim parallels between the two women, it becomes increasingly less clear why Madonna split the narrative this way when clearly her interests lie in the past. The best way to explain it is that she had an overabundance of artistic energy and no idea how to harness it, as some of her flourishes make no sense. Sometimes it's hard to tell if she's shooting a biopic or a bad commercial for blue jeans or perfume. The confusion is amplified by an oddly selected soundtrack, especially when a drug fueled party thrown by Wallis and Edward roars to life accompanied by the Sex Pistols.

Even if some of the creative choices are bizarre, at least the historical segments have some flair to them. The present day scenes are a crashing bore and shot in as flat a tone as possible. Abbie Cornish, usually such a firecracker on screen, is helpless against the bland cinematography and silly, melodramatic script. There has scarcely been a love more dull than that of Wally and her all too perfect Russian guard who comes off a little stalkerish as he watches her anxiously through the security cameras.

Wallis was treated pretty shabbily in The King's Speech, but Andrea Riseborough tries to give her a touch more depth despite not having much to work with on the writing front. We see Wallis' intensity and devotion to the man she loves, even as she knows she'll be forever hated for taking the King away from his people. D'arcy is forgettable as Edward, especially when compared to Guy Pearce's previous charismatic turn. It's really unfortunate that this film had to come out in the wake of the 2010 Best Picture winner, because it's impossible not to compare, and when done so W.E. is found to be severely lacking.",1332288000,11,3892,4.901365705614568
4621233,2,B0059XTV4Y,"If you're a fan of films like ""The King's Speech"" (2010), ""The Queen"" (2006), and ""Anonymous"" (2011) that give you a peek behind the screen of the royal family, you're going to be woefully disappointed in ""W.E."", a 2012 film about the love affair between King Edward VIII and a married American woman, Wallis Simpson - an affair that led to Edward's abdication in December 1936 and the ascension of George VI whose eldest daughter Elizabeth, reigned for more than 50 years and as of this date, remains on the throne.

In addition to a cursory examination of the Wallis/Edward (hence W.E.) affair, there is a concurrent story about a former Sotheby researcher who is obsessed with the story, not only because she was named after Wallis, but also because her own marriage is under strain and she hopes in some way that learning more about Wallis and Edward may assist her.

Two half told stories do not a good film make. Indeed, half told tales diminish rather than enhance a film, so that the two parts of this film - Edward and Wallis in the 1930s and Wally and William in the present - really do injustice to both stories.

But all is not lost, because the contemporary story gives us a look at a really fine actress, Australia born Abbie Cornish whose work has been primarily in Australian and British TV and films. Cornish plays the modern day Wallis, and she does such a fine sensitive job that I wish this were a film about her, rather than a device to serve as a counter point to the Wallis/Edward affair.

James D'Arcy plays King Edward. D'Arcy had primarily been a British TV actor. He's probably best known for co-starring in ""Master and Commander"" (2003) as 1st Lt. Tom Pullings.

Pretty Andrea Riseborough plays Simpson. She was nominated for a BAFTA for the TV movie ""Margaret Thatcher"" The Long Walk to Finchley"" (2008) and the British Independent Film Society nominated her for ""Most Promising Newcomer"" for ""Brighton Rock"" (2010). She is virtually unknown to US audiences.

James Fox, who plays King George V, is the only well known actor (""Patriot Games"", ""The Servant"", ""A Passage to India""), but if you sneeze you'll miss him.

Given the talented actors, what went wrong? Apart from the half told tale problem alluded to above, perhaps the major fault with the film is that it is virtually impossible to see what attracted Edward to Wallis. The film ignores anything to do with the central question - why would a man give up a kingdom for a woman? The film continually tells us that Edward is obsessed with Wallis, and it shows us Edward being obsessed with Wallis, but we are left to wonder why. In an aside, it's suggested that she dressed better than anyone else, and as seemingly silly as this may be, it is the only clue we have.

There's another problem with the film, and this is the continual shifting between real footage (news reels and newspapers) of Edwards and Wallis and reconstructed footage with the actors superimposed. There seems to be no pattern to when this happens, leading me to think that they simply ran out of money to complete the task. As presented, the shift is jarring and is a constant reminder that we are watching a film with actors - a deadly thrust at the heart of any film.

All these problems can be laid at the foot of writer/director Madonna who is best known as a singer, although her second career in film is also notable. She acted in more than 20 films, winning a Golden Globe for ""Evita"" (1996) although winning a Razzie (worst actress) for ""Swept Away"" (2002), ""Die Another Day"" (2002), ""The Next Best Thing"" (2000), ""Four Rooms"" (1995), ""Body of Evidence"" (1993), ""Who's That Girl"" (1987) and ""Shanghai Surprise"" (1986).

W.E. is her fourth film as a writer and second film as a director. None of her other efforts received any type of award, although W.E. did get an Oscar nomination for Costume Design.

Of course the film is not totally without merit. It is visually attractive and it's always good to get a peek at actors who otherwise appear on TV and films in other countries. There are also a few moments when the camerawork is exceptional as it visually tracks extreme closeups of facial features while underscoring the theme offered in the scene (something Sergio Leone did very well in a very different context). But these few crumbs will not provide sufficient sustenance for a 2+ hour film.

Roger Ebert called it ""an elegant, ambitious and relentlessly monotonous film"" and said ""there is little human interest or excitement."" The Hollywood Reporter called it ""as easy on the eyes and ears as it is embalmed from any dramatic point of view.""

The film opened in February 2012 and did less than $50,000 in its opening weekend. Poor as this may appear, films like this generally don't do well when they open - ""The Queen"" (2006) made only $122,014 and ""The King's Speech"" made $355,450. ""Anonymous"" was an exception with more than $1 million.

Bottom line - a dull film that offers no insight into the Wallis/Edward affair.",1331078400,13,4998,4.690639269406392
4621234,5,B0059XTV4Y,"W.E. was beyond what i expected. I totally did not expect it to be such masterpiece, it really blew me away. Everything about this film impressed me from the costume, the lighting, the cast, but most importantly the the accuracy of the story and how Madonna was able to show a different side of the story. As a fan of The British Monarchy i had read a lot about the Duke and Duchess of Windsor but i never bothered to see the Duchess's side of the story and just what she had to go through, what she had to give up. Everyone always thinks about what King Edward VIII gave up, but they never take in consideration the hell she went through and that is what W.E. did for me it made me think and see it from her point of view. Once again Madonna has impressed me with her work, and honestly i don't care what the media says she did a great job directing this film. I am very proud to be a fan of such an intelligent, intellectual, brilliant, and talented artist who never cease to amaze me.",1330473600,15,987,4.172774869109948

4621276,3,B0059XTV4Y,"I think that if Madonna's name had not been attached to the movie, the well-crafted performance of Andrea Riseborough as Wallis Simpson would have gotten far more attention by critics and award-givers.  Riseborough shines.  Interestingly, and contrary to what I would have thought, Madonna directs and films the period pieces quite well and much better than the scenes set in modern times.  The parts of the story involving Wallis and Edward are compelling.  Unfortunately, the script meanders into contemporary New York with contrived story line about an abused wife which doesn't work on any level.  In many ways, this predicament is reminiscent of ""Julie & Julia"", in which the Julia Child portion of the film is lovely, fun and interesting, while the Julie story line is dull and annoying.  Ultimately though, Madonna's premise is that W & E are the worlds greatest tortured lovers since Romeo & Juliet.  Nah.  I get that he gave up a crown for her, but he actually hated the duties of being king and couldn't wait to get out.  But if you wanted me to believe that never have two more perfect star-crossed lovers existed, we needed far more scenes of them falling in love, and far fewer of the modern woman and whatever she was doing.",1511395200,3,1238,4.80188679245283

4621281,5,B0059XTV4Y,"This is a true story of forbidden love and self betrayal. Madonnas work and direction is superb. I speak not as a music fan of hers but as an artist and film lover. It is encouraging to see Madonna as a film maker and writer. I have always enjoyed films on historical figures. Madonna slices the lives of two women, Wally Winthrop by Abbie Cornish and Wallis Simpson potrayed by Andrea Riseborough. She then re-stacks the slices as a film that parallels their injured souls together. Its an amazingly successful technique. Everyone knows about the tragedy inflicted on King Edwards denial of the throne over a free spirited married American woman but nobody ever touched on the life and heart of Wallis Simpson. What I found powerful was how the director ends this tragedy caged in sorrow, guilt and reckless lust with the most calm, peaceful while possibly inflicting the fairy tale line of being ""happily ever after""!  Oscar Isaac delivers a strong performance and James D'Arcy does not disappoint as the King. Also, father and son actors James and Laurence Fox play King George V, Edwards younger brother Bertie. I would buy this film.",1499040000,,1138,4.835897435897436

1 - The photography of a sea of umbrellas at the entrance to Sotheby's is imaginative and well-photographed.
2 - The ""letter montage"" near the end of the movie is extremely well done.  The quotes are well chosen, wonderfully spoken, and imaginatively combined.  In pure movie terms, this is absolutely wonderful.
3 - I don't know if the quotes in the ""letter montage"" are real, but I suspect they are.  Wallis confesses to her Aunt Bessie that she sometime feels suffocated by the Duke's constant attentions.  Those of us who know their history know that this is absolutely accurate, and hearing it read gives one some sympathy for the Duchess.  Even more so is when she points to ""my own familiar friend"" as the source of her troubled situation.  Wallis and the Duke were stuck in an ambiguous situation, where they were not a full royal couple, yet they were not non-royals either.  Wallis was known to be a prolific letter writer, so this is quite a revelation.

HISTORICAL INACCURACIES
1 - The king preceding Edward VIII was George V, not George III.  Really, this mistake is hard to excuse.
2 - Wallis Simpson hated smoking, never rode a horse, and didn't play the piano, yet she is depicted doing all three.
3 - The scene in which Prince Edward overhears his parents discussing him never happened.
4 - The scene in which Edward adds benzedrine to his guest's drinks never happened.  He would have considere such a thing unthinkable.
5 - The king and Wallis never entertained the Duke and Duchess of York in Cap d'Antibes.  The Yorks only met Mrs. Simpson a few times and always in England.
6 - Wallis did dash across France to her friends the Rogerses, but she arrived late at night, not in the daytime.
7 - It might make for a good story, but the last item in the Windsor auction was NOT the Abdication Desk.

UNLIKELY TO UNBELIEVABLE
1 - Wally Winthrop travels to Paris, ingratiates herself with Mohammed Al Fayed in order to see letters written by the Windsors.  Yet at their parting he calls her ""Miss Montague,"" a name she assumed, and she calls him ""Mohammed.""  Extremely unbelievable.
2 - The Duke on his deathbed asks Wallis to dance for him.  She does so while Chubby Checker sings ""The Twist.""  Not credible.  She would have played a song from the 30s or 40s when they were first married.  Unlikely.
3 - Wally's Russian friend shows up at her New York apartment building and is admitted only by giving his name and employer.  Unlikely.

BAD JUDGMENT
1 - A party scene is underscored with wildly inappropriate rock music.
2 - Would someone smart enough to adopt a pen name, travel to Paris, and arrange a meeting with Mr. Fayed really ask a hotel employee if the Duke and Duchess actually stayed in the Duke and Duchess of Windsor Suite?  Pure clumsiness.
3 - There are too many scenes in which Wally just looks morose.  We almost stop caring about her.
4 - The last third of the film needs a quicker pace, leading up to the ""letter montage"" scene.  In many movies this is a fault.  By this time the audience has been watching for well over an hour and a half, and this is when the plot needs to proceed briskly, with fewer atmospheric shots.

As a Windsorphile, I enjoyed this movie, despite its flaws.  Yet I can see within it a different story that might have been more interesting.  The parallel stories could work if the Duchess was portrayed as Bogart was in ""Play It Again,Sam,"" as an imaginary friend giving advice to a contemporary woman.  It could have included all the historical scenes and been much more interesting.  As it is Wally is portrayed as morose too often, her connection to Wallis Simpson is not really clear, and her longing for a baby with her nasty husband is inexplicable.

Still, it is an interesting film.",1448582400,,4004,4.587904360056259

There is no delving deep into the why and wherefore of this obsession, but the film does shows the decadence and complete irresponsibility this self-absorbed couple demonstrated.  There is some background explanation via flash backs, most especially of Wallace's previous relationships and the challenges of the usual sexist attitudes of the time for her. I did learned some new information - like how she tried to refuse Edward etc.  She should have as she had regrets.  I did enjoy this but I will not be reading any more or paying to view again.

I thought it was a well done movie and Abbie Cornish did a very good job in her role of Wally Winthrop. What I really loved about this movie is how the 'fourth wall' was broken across the decades to allow Wallis Simpson and Wally Winthrop to communicate. Wally, who we learn used to work at Sotheby's in NYC before getting married to a doctor who is constantly on call, goes back to Sotheby's daily to see the estate up for auction of Wallis Simpson & King Edward VIII's possessions. We find out that she was named after Wallis Simpson because her mother and grandmother were obsessed with her. Wally finds her life as just a housewife to be boring and how much she misses working at Sotheby's. The blooming romance between her and the security guard as Sotheby's is the only other bright spot in her life besides going to see the items up for auction as her marriage falls apart.

I walked away from this movie feeling sorry for Wallis Simpson, something I didn't do after reading Anne Sebba's book about her. both this movie and Ms. Sebba's book are interesting perspectives on a complicated woman. Definitely worth a watch.",1433030400,,1236,4.542600896860987

The story ties the progress of the affair between Mrs. Simpson and the Prince of Wales to a modern tale of an auction house expert helping to shepherd the sale of the personal effects of the Duchess after her death. The modern Wallis has a bad marriage and a need to escape her tightly controlled life, and finds it in searching for the Duchess in her personal correspondence. Anyone who cares deeply about women's history ought to consider the case Madonna makes here that the Duchess was a woman trapped by her own circumstance, a courtesan who found security, if not love, but paid an enormous price.  Lavishly filmed, with gorgeous sets and costumes, Madonna proves herself a better director and storyteller than one might suspect.

4621882,3,B0059XTV4Y,"While I don't think Madonna can act her way out of a wet paper bag, this film definitely proved she can direct and have potential success with it at the level of her music career.  It's an interesting take on the Wallis and Edward story with good acting, perfect set design and costumes, and tells the story from the 'shameful' woman's perspective in the famously infamous romance.  Madonna can certainly understand what it's like to be vilified in the global press and gives an opportunity for us to see the human side of the woman who was only made out to be a manipulative social climber.  Here we get to see how their romance (they were married 35 years) unfolded and what she lost in order to gain the former King's hand in marriage.  The interplay with that and how a women, represented by one woman in this film, in our time are still struggling with abusive relationships and are often in the position where they have to give up what society perceives as appropriate for them to find real love ad fulfillment in a relationship.  In the course of realizing that her life was unfulfilling with her husband, her obsession in identifying with Simpson - who found fulfillment after two ended marriages grows.  In short, it demonstrates how times haven't changed much for women.  After seeing this film, I'm willing to give more future films directed by Madonna a try.  I hope she keeps at it.  While she won't win an Oscar for her acting chops, she might one day get there for directing if she dedicates time and finds or writes the right script.  And while I like some of her music, I don't consider myself a huge fan of hers, so imagine how surprised I am to be recommending her as a director.",1425686400,,1698,4.519607843137255

4621885,1,B0059XTV4Y,"I'm well versed on the factual story of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Frankly, I very much looked forward to seeing this movie. However, if you value history, please save yourself two long hours and watch only the trailer. This is a total waste of time. Not only is it badly acted by most of the cast, it is directed by an amateur with major mental issues. The mistakes are too numerous to mention. I found it hilarious that the story was set in 1998, yet we see later model 2011 - 2012 vehicles on the streets of New York.

First of all this movie is dominated by the trials and tribulations of a spoiled, extremely wealthy, New York housewife name ""Wally"". Her new-age socialite mother had named her after Wallis Simpson. Wally attends Sotheby's auctions for fun and thinks nothing of dropping $10,000 for a pair of gloves once worn by the Duchess of Windsor. Our ""heroine"" Wally is captivated by the Duchess. She sets out to discover and learn about the life of ""suffering"" endured by her idol.

Wally fails to appreciate the fact that His Majesty King Edward VIII gave up the most powerful throne in the world in order to marry his wife. Such sacrifices pale in comparison to the ""pain"" endured by the Duchess.  The movie does not concentrate on facts. Rather, it seeks to emphasize everything Wallis Simpson gave up in order to marry the former monarch.

I get a lump in my throat when I think of what the marriage did to poor Mrs. Simpson. Immediately after the wedding ceremony the poor thing became a multi-millionaire in her own right, an English Duchess, sole beneficiary of one of the wealthiest men in Europe, and a full partner in a marital union of mutual adoration. That is pretty tough stuff for anyone to endure....  In all seriousness, most of us don't find lifelong marital bliss. That gift alone made the Duchess a very fortunate person.

However, our heroine Wally is bent on playing up whatever imagined female suffering she can conjure up. She starts spending a lot of time at Sotheby's. Her callous husband works long hours as a respected physician. She is not happy with her multi-million dollar penthouse and expensive jewelry paid for by her husband. Wally needs more, so she starts acting promiscuous and flirting with everyone. After she is impregnated by a Sotheby's security guard, she discards the $10,000 gloves and gives them to the ghost of the Duchess.

Some of the flashbacks are nicely done. For example, the scenes at Fort Belvedere and the well documented cruise in 1936 are epic. Also, Andrea Riseborough does an excellent job playing the Duchess. I think she really understands the character and that shines through. Unfortunately, James D'Arcy is horrible. His acting, if we must call it that, leaves a lot to be desired. Also, he is way too tall to play Edward VIII. Edward was an elegant and graceful person. He did not look like a diseased giraffe, and did not walk around with an arrogant, undeserved sense of accomplishment. George Lopez could have been a more convincing King Edward.

Wally's obsession with the Duke and Duchess leads her to Paris, where secretive billionaire Mohamed Al-Fayed amazingly gives her access to private correspondence written by the Duchess. As the story ends, the movie falsely paints the Duchess of Windsor as a miserable woman who was stuck in a loveless marriage. That perversion of the truth is made worse when we see an elderly, ailing Duke of Windsor begging the equally frail Duchess to dance The Twist.

All in all, this is a very sad attempt at directing by Madonna. If she wants to create a story of freaks, perhaps she can direct the remake of Rocky Horror Picture Show. She should stay away from history.",1424822400,3,3698,4.72093023255814

Not even if he's an artiste. If an 80's materialistic statement need run with the Wallis-Edward story I think a better story would start AFTER Wally splits with her abusive hubby (not illustrating this drama scene by scene) and she's ""clearing her head"". The auction influences her and she starts thinking about the Romance of the Century and the objects still connect the 80s to the pre-war era. But get a less wooden actress than Abbie Cornish and nix that Oscar Isaac and replace them with actors that the audience wants to watch. Plenty of guys have knees you wanna see in a kilt.

4622018,3,B0059XTV4Y,This is an okay movie.  Its missing something - just don't quite know what it is.  Wallis Simpson's wardrobe was incredible - but I can't really say that about the story line.,1412726400,2,175,4.4375
4622019,4,B0059XTV4Y,"The film W.E. creatively weaves the historic love story of King Edward VIII and American divorce Wallis Simpson, with a contemporary romance between a married woman and a Russian security guard into a beautiful tapestry that is somehow more than the sum of the parts. Both stories are enriched in the process.

Wally Winthrop, a young unhappily married woman (who happens to resemble Wallis Simpson), has given up her career at Sotheby's at the urging of her abusive, philandering husband. When she visits a Sotheby exhibition featuring items from the former King's estate, she becomes obsessed with the tale of their love story and long life together. She fondles the items to be auctioned and tries to imagine their time together. The world was focused on what the King gave up to marry Wallis, but Wally wanted to know the other side of the story - what the divorcee gave up to marry the King. The Duke and Duchess were maligned and ostracized and spent their 36 years together living in France. During her many visits to the auction house, Wally befriends a thoughtful, erudite Russian security guard, and a romance blossoms when she comes to him after being abused by her husband.

The transitions between the modern and historic stories are interesting and well done - not exactly time travelling, though there is at least one scene near the end in which both Wallis and Wally appear together. The sets and costumes are quite stunning, particularly those set in the 1930's, and the period detail appears to be quite accurate.

I'm not sure why this film bombed at the box office, perhaps because it is rather slow at times, but I certainly enjoyed watching and learning more of the story of the great historic love affair.",1412640000,,1728,4.811447811447811

4622092,3,B0059XTV4Y,"Great costumes, dancing, and cinematography. The flashbacks to Wallis and Edward (""David"") are more compelling than the 1998 frame tale, which is contrived and lacks interest. The fact that the flashbacks are chronologically out of order gives the film a disjointed feel, and I imagine that it would make Wallis's story confusing for those who watched the film without knowing that story quite well ahead of time. There are some careless historical inaccuracies: for example, that Wallis had not been back to England after the abdication prior to the Duke's funeral. Not true! The Duke and Duchess were in London, with the Royal Family, for the dedication of the Queen Mary memorial in London in 1967 (the centenary of her birth) and had been back many other times as well. You'd think things like that could have have been fact-checked.",1410825600,3,837,4.985714285714286
4622093,3,B0059XTV4Y,"I liked this movie much better than I had expected to do. It got panned by the critics, and while there were some mild historical blunders, and the story of Wallis and Edward was far more compelling than that of the modern day couple, I felt that the modern day story in the end did work itself up from being fairly colorless (because its protagonist was deliberately made to be colorless) into a story that captured my interest and won me over. I also very much enjoyed the revelations about Wallis and her letters, and the sacrifice she made for ""the love story of the century.""

4622174,4,B0059XTV4Y,"If  you have any interest in the Windsors, this is a great movie to watch.  The monarchy of England could have been so different if Edward remained the king, this movie gives new insight on Wallis Simpson.
I had low expectations, probably because Madonna was the director, so I expected a smutty and vulgar film, but the cinematography and scenery was a big surprise.  There is massive attention to detail- costumes, jewelry, cars, locations, hairstyles, all the little expensive production items that make a film worth watching.  The acting is so-so, however.  Abbie Cornish was great and Andrea Riseborough was superb as Wallis.  James D'Arcy was just ok.  Possibly there could have been a different choice.  I didn't always buy that this man was so obsessed that he gave up the throne of England for her, although that HAS to be hard to convey on film.  Maybe the chemistry was a tad off.  I also didn't like Abbie's severe look with harsh black dyed hair, although I got that they were trying to make her look like Wallis.
 This is a great story, one of the great love stories of our time, and they told it from Wallis' perspective, which is probably the first time this has been done (with Wallis telling her side).  Although you can't really say ""poor Wallis..."", you do get a new perspective, and don't just write her off as the most hated pariah of her time.  This story needed to be told, Edward's abdication was UNHEARD of, and he was pressured.  How easy it was to place all the blame on Wallis.  As you find out through the film, she did give up a lot as well.  They were banished from England from a long time, stripped of royal dignity and became laughingstocks of the time.
The way the movie moves between past and present is easy to follow, although I don't know if the Abbie Cornish storyline was necessary, I think the movie could have been told strictly through Wallis' eyes.  I also think the movie got negative publicity because Madonna is attached to it.  I think if they would have made this movie through the BBC or even a Masterpiece mini series it could have been phenomenal.",1401062400,,2101,4.572192513368984
4622175,2,B0059XTV4Y,"The premise was interesting and intriguing, but the scenes went too quickly back and forth from the 1930's to present day;  it was difficult to  determine who was who until a good way into the film.  And the physical violence was totally unnecessary.  A raised fist, fading to bruises .... do we need to see the whole gory mess?  I am admittedly an old lady and I do not like ANY overt sex or violence on screen.  Anyone who has seen old movies like ""Desire Under the Elms"" knows that you don't have to see the bodies writhing to get the point.  And much of the older film noir is brutal without showing blood and guts.  Too bad.  It was a good idea, but I will not watch it again without my fast forward in my hand, if ever.  The best DVD on this subject is still Edward and Mrs. Simpson.",1400457600,2,789,4.1655629139072845
4622176,1,B0059XTV4Y,"What possessed Madonna Louise Ciccone, born in Bay City, Michigan in August 1958, to make such a film, and a very bad one indeed, about the greatest gold digger of them all, Wally Simpson, born Bessie Wallis Warfield, June 1896 in Blue Ridge Summit PA? It couldn't be only the possibility of more costume changes per minute than in a Doris Day film. It must have been something about the character of the woman that touched something in Madonnas psyche and reminded her of herself. Wallys blind ambition, perhaps. Her rise from no where to somewhere and then back to nothingevery performers nightmare. If that was the case, and let us give the director some credit, why then is the film so thoroughly lacking in any real psychological understanding of the protagonists character?  When so many books have been written about the duchess why then is this one so historically inaccurate? The answer may bewe can only guess--that it was never Madonnas intention to examine Wally in her time so much as it was Madonna's desire to imagine herself as Wally. There has always been something childish, nave about Madonna the persona, despite the raunchiness. She seems never to have matured as a woman or an artist. She is still the little girl dressing up in mommas clothes, putting on lipstick, and pretending to be grownup. As for the direction itself, this movie is not so much a film as a long perfume ad.  To paraphrase Oscar Levant: Strip away the phony tinsel and you'll find the real tinsel.",1400371200,6,1491,4.7528957528957525

I thought that it transitioned from time periods well, I connected with the characters of Wallis and Wally, and I was interested in the story.  As to historical accuracy; this is a film that is based on actual events, and it is the filmakers creative interpretation of those events.

4622178,5,B0059XTV4Y,"I very much enjoyed this movie. I thought Madonna did a marvelous job of entwining two parallel stories, set in different time periods, but sharing much of the emotion and struggle that comes from challenging situations such as those played out.

4622332,5,B0059XTV4Y,"Before I even get into discussing the product I have to declare that you better not hop on the ""Madonna is old so this automatically sucks,"" band wagon. The majority of critics and general public who dislike this movie solely judged this movie because Madonna directed it. So many reviews have unintelligently reviewed this movie saying, ""what, she can't write and direct a movie focusing on one story?"" It's unfortunate in our day and age that agreeing with the mass population because 'if so many people agree then they must all be right' is a fad, it's a shame people can't, or won't, think for themselves. I'm not even a fan of Madonna's music but I absolutely love this movie.
Watch this movie without expectations and with a desire to feel romanticized by the story, Andrea Riseborough and James Darcy's performances are absolutely stunning and mesmerising, wonderfully capturing what it must have been like for a King to fall in love with a commoner (an American one no less) and giving up his throne to be with her. The movie addresses what Wallis Simpson must have felt being a social pariah without warrant.
We have two stories intersecting simply because this retelling of the 'Romance Of The Century' stems from a housewife's need for some type of comfort and relation with her own maritial problems. If the haters of this movie paid attention Wally (Abbie Cornish) explains to her love interest (the handsome russian Oscar Isaac) that both her mother and grandmother were obsessed with Wallis' story, the character shares a common line having already known so much about the commoner turned Duchess. The stories wonderfully overlap because we are seeing the story through Wally's imagination/interpretation of the story (in a sense, not Madonna's interpretation!), which is why I'd like to believe explains the scene where Wallis dances for Edward with a modern song covering it.
I first watched this movie on Netflix where you can too if you need to see before you buy, but you'll find the soundtrack absolutely beautiful and captivating! Abel Korzeniowski did a 5 star job. There's wonderful cinematography and a kick ass costume set. Lots of recognizable actors. Watch this movie and try to not let others create your opinion for you until you do see it.

4622336,3,B0059XTV4Y,"Edward VIII reigned briefly as King of Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the British dominions, and as Emperor of  India, from January 20 to December 10, 1936  He then abdicated in order to marry the twice-divorced American, Wallis Simpson. He was the only British sovereign to voluntarily give up the crown.  Seemingly, this wasn't dramatic enough for Madonna (who produced/financed the film).  Inexplicably, she jammed in a secondary, modern plot starring an actress with a face as expressionless as a suet pudding.  As a result, what would have been an absolutely charming, possibly excellent, film was ruined.  The actress playing Mrs. Simpson is heartrendingly good, but she has a pitifully short time on screen -- being forced to share it with the dopey modern heroine.  Why do movie producers do this? A recent film about Julia Child was similarly ruined by just such a plot device.  What a waste of two of the most interesting female lives of the 20th century!

On the plus side, we do get some idea of Wallis Simpson's instinct for fashion and her scenes provide a visual treat for fashionistas..",1384992000,2,1107,4.940540540540541

The problem is that the story of Wallis and Edward is told through the irrelevant framing device of a contemporary woman desperate to get pregnant with a husband who grows steadily more abusive as the film goes on. It's hard understand why we should care about any of this when the focus should obviously be on the couple that the film is named after.

Wally Winthrop has two things in her life: an unhappy marriage and a strange obsession with Wallis Simpson. The latter leads her to do a number of vaguely creepy things such as dressing like Wallis, haunting the Wallis and Edward exhibition at the auction house, spending thousands of dollars on a pair of gloves that belonged to Wallis, lying her way into a meeting with Mohammed al Fayed in order to read Wallis's letters (how is this even POSSIBLE?) and carrying on a number of conversations with Wallis which I can only assume are meant to be elaborate delusions.

Whilst all this is going on she kindles a romance with an employee at the auction house who is described by another character as (I kid you not) ""a Russian intellectual slumming as a security guard"". He's handsome and charming and mysterious and sensitive. He makes an offhand comment early on that Wally reminds him of his wife, and sure enough, we learn later that he's not a divorcee but a lonely widower whose Bohemian apartment is filled with literature and art. Honestly, he's as much a fantasy as Wally's hallucinations of Wallis are.

When one gets hold of a movie called ""W.E."", one doesn't expect it to be about a rather strange woman's attempt to gain control of her own life by daydreaming about another woman. I think Madonna (co-writer/director) *may* have been trying to make a statement about how ordinary people can become too swept up in the love stories of celebrities, often forgetting to live their own lives in the meanwhile. Hey, if anyone could give us an insightful look on that theme it's Madonna, but what we get is the story of a woman living a life of wealth and luxury with an obsessive interest in Wallis Simpson and a sleazebag for a husband. Wait, wasn't this released at about the same time as Madonna's divorce? The whole thing comes across as an elaborate fan-fiction starring Abbie Cornish as Madonna's self-insert OC, making herself the focus of a film that's technically meant to be about Wallis and Edward.

It's with them that the interest truly lies, and it's a darn shame that they're so short-changed. Andrea Riseborough is beguiling as Wallis, capturing the woman's speech patterns and mannerisms, and James D'Arcy manages to portray Edward as utterly besotted without rendering him emasculated. Madonna also ensembles a wonderful supporting cast for the period half of the film: Natalie Dormer, Katie McGrath, James Fox, Laurence Fox and Judy Parfitt, but they only get a couple of scenes each before the story reverts back to Wally and her comparatively banal unhappiness.

Things like the courtship and secret love affair between Edward and Wallis are glossed over and there are simply too many gaps in their love story for it to have any resonance. Having watched the film, I gained no real understanding as to why Edward chose to give up his throne for Wallis. They meet, they flirt, and suddenly Edward is declaring his intense passion for her. Likewise, I never got a sense of the affair's historical impact or how scandalous it was at the time. Edward's reading of his abdication speech plays out with a lot of emotion, but it exists in a void. There's no sense of how it affects the country or the royal family on a larger scale. It just sort of happens.

The film also raises some questions concerning the happiness of the marriage and the couple's association with Hitler, but doesn't even try to offer any answers. Every time it begins to reveal some insight into how exactly Wallis felt about the constitutional crisis that she (partially) caused, we're treated to another twenty minutes of Abbie Cornish's curiously expressionless face.

But regardless of its problems, this is an exceptionally beautiful film to look at. Lavish attention is given to costumes, props, music, hair, makeup and other technical aspects, rendering this a feast for the eyes and ears. There are endless montages of the rich and famous dancing, feasting, socializing and enjoying themselves - and let's be honest, we all secretly love watching that sort of thing, even if it's just to complain about it. If you can focus solely on the period scenes it works well as a companion piece to ""The King's Speech""; in fact in some cases it's better. Andrea Riseborough completely embodies Wallis Simpson, and although Colin Firth walked away with the Oscar for his portrayal of Albert, I think Lawrence Fox bore a greater resemblance to the man.

It's a strange little movie really, and probably appealing only to those interested in the subject matter. Whereas ""The King's Speech"" was accessible even to those who didn't know a thing about the history and figures involved, ""W.E."" requires at least partial awareness of the historical context. Try and enjoy its visual flair and keep the remote handy for fast-forwarding the irrelevant stuff.",1370390400,5,5660,5.018104366347178

4622534,3,B0059XTV4Y,"The romance of King Edward VIII (James D'Arcy) and Wallis Simpson (Andrea Riseborough) has been retold many times before, most notably (for me at least) in the TV series EDWARD AND MRS. SIMPSON with Edward Fox in the title role.  Madonna's version of the tale juxtaposes the story with a present-day tale involving Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish), her violent husband William (Richard Voyle) and a Russian intellectual employed at Sotheby's in New York, Evgeni (Oscar Isaac).  The parallels are obvious enough: Wally identifies with Mrs. Simpson and contrasts her own mundane existence with that of the royal lover.  Eventually she comes to realize that she has the kind of life-choices denied to Mrs. Simpson.  Shot in rock-video style, with fast cuts preventing any real identification with the characters, W.E. actually seems like an attempt by director Madonna to make sense of her own life as a singer/actress/celebrity.  The settings are well drawn; the performances competent (even though D'Arcy looks nothing like the real Duke of Windsor).  However the narrative tends to drag a little as it moves towards its predictable end.

4622595,4,B0059XTV4Y,"A Valentine present for romantics: A review of the movie W. E. directed and co-written by Madonna.

Although panned by critics and burdened with dismal box-office receipts, Madonna's glossy ensemble drama of a young 1990's lonely New Yorker who juxtaposes her life with the famous American divorcee Wallis Warfield Simpson has several redeeming features.

After all the films about a gal from Baltimore and a future King of England-and all the books about the love affair of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor-a new and fresh look! W. E. has at its center the Sotheby 1998 Windsor auction in NYC...from the Al Fayed collection.

Wally Winthrop is not a typical housewife. A former employee of Sotheby's of New York, she has accepted a generous allowance from an abusive and philandering psychiatrist husband to stay at home. She is also obsessed by the ultimate love story of Edward VIII's abdication for a dark, beautiful, slight American beauty some six decades ago. On her almost daily visits to the Sotheby auction, she meets and falls in love with a Russian security guard. She also purchases a pair of the Duchess's white leather gloves for an astounding sum.

The film is well cast....especially the two Wally's. Abbie Cornish as Wally Winthrop and Andrea Riseborough as the Duchess give amazing performances. The costumes and jewelry are spectacular and the title song ""Masterpiece"" is haunting. ""Masterpiece"" won a Golden Globe and was short-listed for the Academy Awards' Best Original Song. Costume design was critically acclaimed and nominated for an Oscar. Two of the Fox acting dynasty family played important roles. Laurence Fox is Bertie and his father James Fox portrays George V. Although I was not too pleased with James D'Arcy's role as the former king of England...it's really coincidental...or is it?...that my favorite Edward VIII is Edward Fox (the brother of James Fox) in the 1978 British mini-series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Edward-Mrs-Simpson/dp/B0054DPLUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Edward & Mrs. Simpson</a>.

4622596,4,B0059XTV4Y,"Madonna has to be given the chutzpah award.  Not content to dodge the brickbats that she eludes for her musical and acting career  she has the audacity to assume the director's chair.  Credit where credit is due ""W.E."", though not perfect, is a good movie.  It's a handsome looking production.  Most of the criticisms I've heard were how Madonna transports the action of the film from time and place in breakneck fashion at the expense of the story.  I will admit that initially this is jarring and headache inducing but after a while you get attuned to the rhythms of the film.  If there's any fault to be found it's in the story which Madonna co-wrote.  The film's central conceit of a cosmic connection between Wallis Duchess of Windsor(Andrea Riseborough) and Wally(Abbie Cornish), an unhappy New York psychiatrist's wife circa 1998 doesn't completely jibe.  Regardless, ""W.E."" is an ambitious film and anybody who has reservations about it because it was helmed by a pop star should tuck such concerns away.",1360713600,5,1012,4.905882352941177

4622599,5,B0059XTV4Y,"By modern American standards, our modern-day heroine, Wally, married a prince. She's not yet thirty and married to a psychiatrist who keeps her in luxury--and behaves as if he owns her. He ignores her, abuses her, cheats on her, and won't let her spend his money or earn her own. He is wholly unsympathetic with her attempts at starting a family (she shoots up fertility drugs on the sly). And his name begins with a ""W""--as did that of the Duchess of Windsor's abusive first husband, Win Spencer.

Wally was named after Wallis Simpson, and has internalized the message that a ""great love"" will make life into a bowl of cherries. Wally is a former Sotheby's employee who, after a six-year absence, starts hanging around Sotheby's when they feature the Windsors' possessions in 1998. In the meantime, she rekindles a neglected work friendship. Her white-collar friend, Tenten, chides Wally about her desire to be back at Sotheby's, working for ""no"" money. Enter a new, BLUE-collar Sotheby's friend: a security guard. And his name begins with an ""E""--as did that of Wallis' loving and beloved second husband, Ernest Simpson.

Wally goes into daydreams (that just might have a psychic element) while admiring and handling the Windsors' possessions, and thus she lives though early 20th-century scenes in Wallis' life. A couple of times, Wallis Simpson talks to her. In due course, Wally secures permission to read some of the Duchess' unpublished letters, and learns that Wallis really loved and wanted to keep her second husband. (This is the belief of Anne Sebba, author of THAT WOMAN, a recent Wallis Windsor biography.) Wally starts to see parallels between her marriage and Wallis' disastrous first one.

Madonna, as director and writer, postulates that the premarital relationship between Edward and Wallis was chaste. Most people think this is preposterous, but it's what Edward claimed. Madonna runs with it. The relationship between Wally and her security guard is chaste, too, as long as her marriage really lasts.

There are errors of fact that I can't help believing are deliberate: A fake newsreel that refers to George V as George III and refers to Edward VIII as having been ""crowned."" But Madonna knows her material, and I think that in a fine-tuned labor of love like this, such errors are meant to show the deafness and crudeness of the press.

Most of us know something of the Edward/Wallis story, but too many know too little. Therefore, I should be less astounded than I am at the critics who don't get this movie. They literally don't understand what the auteur is trying to say. This is a symmetrical work of art with a definite point of view. Madonna does not HAVE to be right in all her facts; indeed, some can only be guessed at. She chooses her interpretation like a historical novelist.

4622700,2,B0059XTV4Y,"Following her ""Filth and Wisdom"" (2008), Madonna directs a film, this time about a life of ""W.E."" - Wallis Simpson and King Edward VIII. (Actually there is another ""W.E."" but about that, later). The story of ""the romance of the century"" is so famous that I don't think I have to repeat it here. Wallis Simpson is played by Andrea Riseborough; King Edward VIII is by James D'Arcy.

Somehow Madonna (who also co-wrote the script with Alek Keshishian, director of ""With Honors,"" ""Love and Other Disasters"" and a documentary ""Madonna: Truth or Dare"") thought that the subject matter needs an unconventional narrative style. As a result, about half of the film is spent on the story of another W.E. living in 1998, New York: two fictional characters Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish), wife of a successful psychiatrist, and Evgeni (Oscar Isaac), Russian security guard working for Sotheby's. Neglected and mistreated by her husband, Wally is obsessed with Wallis Simpson.

Though panned by critics, ""W.E."" is not that bad. Actors all deliver fine performances. Period costumes are beautiful (the film is Oscar nominated for the costume designer Arianne Phillips' brilliant work). The dynamic musical score of Abel Korzeniowski is impressive. Some of the songs Madonna chooses (including The Sex Pistols and Chubby Checker) are used in an unpredictable way.

But the film as a whole is a mess. ""W.E."" is ambitious, maybe too ambitious. The film struggles to fit two stories separated by sixty years into one narrative, but the result is not good. The editing is too busy and confusing; character of Wally is hard to connect with; camerawork (including too many close-ups) is hectic and intrusive, detracting from the story of the real W.E. we really want to know. Clearly there are so many good ingredients here, but somehow the film is overcooked.",1353974400,,1839,5.0627062706270625
4622701,5,B0059XTV4Y,"One receives according to the mode of the receiver, and, that being said, please allow me to attempt to interpret Madonna's interpretation. For starters, being that I am frequently scandalized by Madonna's crazy behavior, and moreover, well aware of her past failures in the movie industry I chose to ignore this film for the longest time, and, boy was I ever mistaken in doing so. In this film ""W.E."" Madonna has produced a most profound work of art in the manner in which she employed many various devices of communication in which to portray one of the most touching love affairs (emotionally speaking) involving incredible paramount sacrifice. Further, she effectively endeavors to excite insight into Wallace's feelings in regards to what she had to sacrifice as well. How does Madonna bring this off? She creates and utilizes a fictional character and story line in both communion and juxtaposition with the true story in order to let us see the true story through the eyes of the fictional character who seems to endure and be subject to similar plights and/or problems. That is to say, it is though the eyes, emotions and feelings of sadness and despondency of the fictional character that we see the actual true story of Wallace and Edward. Now granted, it is probably presumed that the viewer (for the most part) is familiar with the events of the past concerning Wallace and Edward (though there is enough substance provided in the film to articulate the story for those who may be unfamiliar with the events) and, therefore, sufficient time may be given to the development of the fictional character and her story. After about 40 minutes or so into this film I just could not stop saying: WOW!, WOW!, WOW!, WOW!...the entire time. This film is so well done! I absolutely loved it! Beautiful music score as well. The only caveat is that the film is rated R for two scenes of graphic domestic violence (and a total of five f-words in the two scenes). There are no sex scenes (though it starts to appear like one may happen but does not). Anyway, these two scenes can be quickly fast forwarded through (they are only a few seconds each). So, let me conclude by saying that I not only love this movie, but, I totally get it! I suspect many do not, however, and that is why it did not do very well. Please do not be deceived by the poor reviews from the critics for this film is a true masterpiece! A profound masterpiece! I give it 5 gigantic stars!!!!",1353369600,10,2460,4.670506912442396

The relationship between Wally Simpson and King Edward continues to draw interests to this day.

4622704,4,B0059XTV4Y,"The much maligned, brief theatrical film by Madonna - W.E. - fairs better on the small screen than it likely did in the movie houses. The stories are bifurcated, each one resembling a television creation - one a docudrama biopic, the other a contemporary soap opera. That Madonna, who directed and wrote the screenplay with Alek Keshishian, decided to mix the two stories is a bit daring but in some ways it works very well. In other ways the parallel stories seem like time traveling cars on the same highway that never quite travel at the same speed or quality.

The film mixes the notorious affair between King Edward VIII and American divorce Wallis Simpson with a contemporary romance between a married woman and a Russian security guard. The time is 1998 and at an auction of the estate of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor unhappily married ex-Sotheby employee Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish) becomes obsessed by their historic love story. Her own marriage to womanizing, abusive psychiatrist William (Richard Coyle) undermines her feelings of worth and as she learns more about the sacrifices involved in the famous affair, she gains her own courage to find happiness.

The film flips back and forth between the present and the 1930s and it is the historical aspect of the film that is almost flawless. We get to know Wallis Simpson (in a brilliant portrayal by Andrea Riseborough) and understand her failed first two marriages (at the time we meet her she is still married to Ernest Simpson played by David Harbour), and see the American sizzle that made her the talk of England. When Wallis wrangles her way to meet Prince Edward, better known as David, (James D'Arcy) there is a chemistry that develops to the point of passion and ultimately leads to Wallis divorcing Ernest to marry Edward - a deed that leads to Edward's abdication of the throne for `the woman I love', which he had assumed when King George V (James Fox) dies, to his stammering brother Bertie (Laurence Fox) and his caustic wife Elizabeth (Natalie Dormer). The paparazzi make their life miserable and the couple is not allowed to return to England until Edward dies, with the faithful Wallis supportively by his side through 36 years of marriage.

Wally - meanwhile - longs to be pregnant but sustains such abuse from William that she ultimately yields to the loving friendship the auction house Russian security guard Evgeni (Oscar Isaac) and begins her life again. The two stories are connected by Wally's obsession with the royal couple's notorious affair and at auction's end she is given access to private letters between Wallis and Edward that have been in the possession of Mohamed Al-Fayed (Haluk Bilginer) - a tacked on ending that feels ill at ease and redundant.

Everyone connected to the biopic angle of this film is excellent and Madonna shows that she knows how to direct affairs of the heart in a royal situation very well indeed. Both Andrea Riseborough and James D'Arcy are superb and the costumes and music and cinematography of this historical portion are exceptionally well done. Though the idea of the contemporary sluggish story is reasonable, Abbie Cornish seems uncomfortable with the script: Oscar Isaac shines as her new love. In all the film, though spotty, has merit and it not a bad debut for Madonna as director. Grady Harp, November 12",1352505600,,3345,4.883802816901408
4622705,1,B0059XTV4Y,"Wallis Warfield Simpson was one of the most controversial figures of the 20th century -- a twice-divorced American whose love affair with King Edward VIII led to his abdication.

So you would THINK that even Madonna could wring a decent dramatic movie out of the woman. Some passion, some intensity, some controversy... SOMETHING. But ""W.E."" ends up being a choppy, jumbled affair that leaves you desperately hoping for something other than total fluff. And you never, ever get it.

It's not actually the story of Wallis herself, but of Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish), the wife of a wealthy doctor in present-day New York. Wally's husband neglects her (he's obviously having an affair) and doesn't want to have a baby with her, so she wanders to Sotheby's to ogle the for-sale possessions of the legendary Duchess of Windsor.

She also falls in love with an attentive Russian guard after a savage beatdown by her husband. For some reason, she also starts... hallucinating? Seeing visions? Communing with the ghost of Wallis?

Well, whatever happened, she starts seeing Wallis' (Andrea Riseborough) past -- her introduction to the Prince of Wales (James D'Arcy), the affair that sprang up, the glamorous life they had together, and his obsessive love for her that led him to abdicate, even though Wallis was desperate for him not to do so.

Anyone expecting a semi-balanced depiction of Wallis and Edward should keep looking, because  ""W.E."" is basically a cinematic fanfic written by a starry-eyed Wallis fangirl. Wallis and Edward are shiny, perfect, idealized dolls who are everything noble and glamorous, and anyone who dislikes them is just a mean ol' hater who irrationally loathes poor wittle Wallis.

In fact, Madonna is so wedded to this depiction that she either ignores (Wallis' other affairs, her botched abortion) or dismisses (Nazi sympathies) every imperfection that either of them had. She tries to justify it with a cache of fictional ""secret"" letters, but it all rings hollow.

Sadly, the rest of the movie is all flashy, glamorous prettiness with no substance. Madonna's direction is a constant assault of choppy, fragmented edits -- for instance, an intimate kiss between Wallis and Edward is interrupted by a random pan right up a palm tree. The most surreal? A drug-fueled scene where Wallis hikes up her dress and does a suggestive dance with another woman... IN FRONT OF A CROWD.

And on the rare occasions when Madonna DOES try to give us a deep emotional moment, it comes across as artificial and clumsy (""People seem to only focus on what he gave up for her. But what about what she gave up?""). It's like a teenage ""Twilight"" fan directed this.

As the final indignity, Wallis' complex story is just window-dressing for the story of Wally. Madonna tries to ram the ""similarities"" down our throat (Wally's rotten husband is referred to as ""our own Prince of Wales""), but in the end there is almost nothing in common between these two women. So, they're alike because their marriages didn't work? That's all? Who CARES about Wally?

The actors... well, they do the best they can. Cornish is stiff and awkward, but Riseborough and D'Arcy do the best they can with their flimsily perfect characters. Unfortunately, the awful direction makes their dramatic scenes look ridiculous -- when Wallis runs into her bedroom to cry, Madonna manages to make the act of RUNNING look artificial.

""W.E."" was booed at Cannes, and rightfully so -- it's a clumsy, hackneyed story that shows that Madonna is as bad a director as she is an actress. Stick with ""Edward & Mrs. Simpson"" for a more skilled, nuanced depiction.",1352160000,4,3627,4.966996699669967

4622708,1,B0059XTV4Y,"Madonna has yet to direct a movie that entertains or enlightens or even just makes you want to see more from her. Granted she's only directed two but without the celebrity status she brings to a picture why would anyone hire her to direct when so many good directors are looking for their next project?

W.E. is the story of Wallis Simpson, the American divorcee, and Edward, the next King of England, and their romance. Well for most the story would be about that. Instead Madonna puts a new twist on the story that's been told time and time again. And of course that twist is more lurid than most films choose to use.

But rather than just stick with the one story we have another running first and alongside the famous romance. A young woman is trouble with her marriage to her husband and keeps coming back to an auction house selling off pieces of Simpson's past. What a great way to go back and forth in time and allow for some glimpses of newer lingerie.

Its been said that the point of this film was less about presenting an historically accurate telling of the same tale once more but more about discussing celebrity and people's desire to have that notoriety. In the way this story is told that seems to be the only thing that interests Wallis Simpson. In an unhappy marriage (on her part at least) she seeks fame and attention. She wants the hoi paloi to take notice of her, to talk about her parties and her friendships. Edward comes off as little more than a party boy who goes from one woman to the next. I could be wrong but I think there was more to their story than that and using them to tell a story completely foreign to their real lives seems a bit much.  Rather than do so why not just use a fictional couple instead? Using historical figures involves viewers bringing with them the baggage of knowing what they know about them already. To try and present them as something else just causes confusion.

But that's not the worst of it. The worst of it is that the film is completely boring. There are no characters to sympathize with, to care about or to feel involved with. Everyone is self serving and watching them prance about from one party to another is just tedious.

One thing will result from this movie. Those who are die hard fans of Madonna will rise to the occasion and defend it as a work of art. They will attack anyone who dares try to say different. Fortunately this is a minority from the look of the box office results for this film as well as DVD sales.

4622719,2,B0059XTV4Y,"This year seems to be the year of Wallis Simpson.  For some reason, there were many books nad movies made about the American woman who was twice divorced and yet managed to marry British King.  He had to abdicate his throne in order ""to be with the woman he loves"" and he did so probably without fully realizing the consequences of such decision.  Historians consider Edward as a kind of royal that would make an inadequate king: he liked to party, he was always surrounded by women and he had uncanny affinity towards Germans, that in late 1930s made many nervous.

Wallis on the other hand, was from humble background.  Growing up,she always depended on her rich cousins and her goal in life was to marry good, financially stable and reliable husband.  Her first marriage was tragic, because her husband, a professional soldier, turned out to be a drunk.  Her second husband who had business interest in England was boring yet well of and reliable.  It is through his social circles that she met british royalty.

This movie gives parallel stories of Wallis and Edward's affair compared to the modern day couple: a successful NYC doctor and his young and beautiful stay at home wife who incidentally bears the name Wallis.  Modern day Wallis is fascinated with the other Wallis woman and she ha romantic view of the relationship that many labled as the ""biggest romance of the century"".  Isolated, lonely and largely ignored by her husband she finds solace in researching the life and love of Wallis and Edward.  In her pursuit to learn more, she goes to the Sotheby's auction of Wallis Simpson's personal possessions.

Madonna directed this film and seems to have tried to make it an art film.  But other than realy nice costumes and make up I found movie disappointing.  There is no depth in any of the characters.

The cinema-photography in W.E. and the music score is academy award worthy!

I have no doubt that Wallis Simpson saw things this way but, as they say, I think there is more to this story. Her previous marriages had a great impact on this romance, for example, but they are not included. The fact that she fought him on the subject of abdication was glossed over. She certainly never expected to spend the rest of her life in exile but she entered history as a mean spirited gold digger. This movie doesn't change that.",1346889600,4,509,4.483870967741935
4622754,4,B0059XTV4Y,"W.E is an art film, in its essence. The style is, to me, more of French Cinema than perhaps a US film release, but comparisons such as this are for naught and are more suited to Siskel and Ebert styled reviews.

The fact that Madonna co-wrote and directed this film creates a weighted bias, and though I won't directly commit here to my thoughts on this, prior to viewing the movie, suffice to say I was quite surprised to see that Madonna has shown great depth as a director and has challenged her viewers.

This being said, I do think there is, again a bias as to what viewers are willing to accept as directorial genius when the director is not a ""whomever"". Even more so when a pop star with limited to no directorial experience has accomplished this. I think we've all seen movies wrought of ""the geniuses"" that have left us possibly shaking our heads at what the PR hype told us it would be, but such is one's individual take, or not.

The sets and costumes are magnificent. The score is beautiful and is presented in a more classic fashion, not resorting to the current trend of, say, overblown choirs stacked on top of big orchestration. Further, the score by Abel Korseniowski is often subtle and far reaching in heightening the film. It reinforces, yet again, for me, that obscure European film composers are far more reaching than what is produced for the majority of the US film industry (such as Wojciech Kilar's ( a student of Nadia Boulanger, hence the greatness) sumptuous understated scoring of Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"").  W.E is further juxtaposed by use of Pop material (as is so in vogue now to do). Hence a lengthy and varied set of song credits do accrue.

The movie is a dualism that compares the maelstrom of King Edward abdicating his throne because he is in love with an American woman, Wallis Simpson, who all of England, it seems, will not accept as a suited wife to the Crown.

The companion contemporary story deals with a young woman, Wally Winthrop (her mother  had named her after Wallis-Simpson), in an unhappy marriage and her gradual and ongoing psychological breakdown due to her loss of identity within a marriage which has denigrated to her being, essentially a de-valued trophy wife to a successful, but philandering and abusive husband. Her coping mechanism has been to escape into her inner world, which centers around her fixation of her namesake, Wallis-Simpson, brought finally to fruition in her daily visits to Sotheby's to view and personally interact with a collection of personal items of Edward and Wallis-Simpson to be auctioned.

It is a bit confusing, initially when periods change abruptly in the film, following the comparative presented, often done through use of touchstones, either tangible (as in the museum) or inner escapism fantasies of Wally. However, it is certainly no more far reaching as a transitional concept as was often a confusing Blockbuster, ""Inception"". However, ""Inception"" boasts a director, with let's say, an accepted reputation, where ""W.E"" has Madonna. My feeling is that Madonna accomplished many things very well in this film, but quite possibly her adventurous creative approach will be un-accepted by many simply because she is Madonna.

The movie is worth your time in watching, most certainly. It was filmed on a modest budget by Hollywood standards, and did not re-coup its expenses at the box office, but DVD's live on as a second and longer chance for films like this to be understood and gain audience.

The cast is great! Andrea Riseborough and James D'Arcy shine as Wallis and Edward. Abbie Cornish is wonderful as Wally.

It is well worth mentioning that Katie McGrath (who broke in first in a secondary role on ""The Tudors"" and was launched as ""Morgana"" in the BBC's ""Merlin"") as ""Lady Thelma"" here is an actress to keep watch on, as Katie is captivating on screen even in brief supporting. Great things lie ahead for Katie McGrath.

As a postscript, I have purposely avoided documenting specific content of the movie because I don't care for reviews which give too much of the movie away, so I would rather present less, than more in this regard.

W.E is well worth your time, and congratulations to Madonna for her success, irregardless of box office, as a director of surprising substance.",1344729600,6,4297,4.837874659400545

So you can imagine my amazement that somehow Edward managed to celebrate his June birthday in 1936 before his father died. Terrible!

I did not expect an historical retrospective, which this fim is not, but I also didn't expect the beautifully-crafted and expertly-acted film I watched. This is truly a beautiful film, with solid parallel stories, incredible costumes and, as mentioned, spot-on, wonderful acting. The two stories being played out were complex & compelling and the scenery and costumes were amazing, with no detail left unattended.

4622781,3,B0059XTV4Y,"Andrea Riseborough rescues this film, providing a portrayal of Wallis Simpson that elevates her storyline from two-dimensional melodrama to fine art. The historical part is well shot and for the most part quite engaging although doesn't really offer anything particularly new. The theme of the film is that the rich and famous aren't worth associating with and it's better to get connected with true salt-of-the-earth types which may be true but seems somewhat forced given the historical context.

The modern day B-story is a disaster. Abbie Cornish gets routinely beaten up by her husband, mirroring Wallis' opening scene, and there's little explanation about how these two women are connected other than their dismally abusive spouses. Supposedly an auction of Wallis and Edward's personal items provides the flashback opportunity for Cornish's character who's for no reason obsessed with their history. It's a weak plot device and might have worked if the modern story had any substance whatsoever. And the predictably feminist angle that Madonna injects feels out of place in the historical storyline and creates risably thin detestable men in the modern plot.

This isn't a bad film and has elements of being a great movie. The score is atmospheric if slightly overbearing at times. It's dressed up beautifully and looks every part as good as The King's Speech. Even the dialog is mostly very good and then occasionally stumbles with anachronistic terms that remind you that it's good but uneven. So ignore the fact that this bombed at the box office and try to forget that Madonna directed and for the most part it's still better than many of the films released this year.",1341705600,4,1679,5.124087591240876
4622782,4,B0059XTV4Y,"I had not even heard of this ""romance"" before the preview and then later watching this film. I was intrigued by the going back and forth between a modern day girl's struggle lacking love in her own relationship and this Duchess Wallis Simpson who lacked security in being with King Edward. Like ""The Iron Lady"" this story has opened doors to my wanting to learn more about the time period 1920s-1970s from the perspective of the people surrounding this event (i.e. the people of England).

I was also impressed by Madonna's undertaking of such a project.",1341619200,2,554,4.770833333333333
4622783,4,B0059XTV4Y,"W.E. is the story of socialite Wallis Simpson who possessed Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor enough that it prompted him to give up the throne of England to marry this woman.  This move caused quite a stir at the time for various reasons.  One of them was that Wallis left her second husband for him and she was an American.  She and this guy were celebrities, both immensely loved, vilified and ostracized by society all at the same time.  Who better to tell that story than someone like Madonna who is one of those rare people who has lived a life that most of the world will never have or experience.

The movie paints a portrait of this love affair that took place juxtaposed with another story in modern day time revolving around another woman, Wally Winthrop.  Wally is a fictional character who is an abusive relationship and fixates on this love story between Wallis and the Prince.  She fantasizes and obsesses over it to the point of hanging out in a museum that is dedicated to the historical artifacts of Wallis Simpson.  The subplot could've stood on its own in another film, but not this one.  The way the movie jumps from the subplot to the affair between the Prince and Wallis is disjointed and confusing.  It also stalls the momentum.  The same was done in the Meryl Streep film, Julie & Julia.  Focus on the main public figure and avoid creating a fictitious subplot as it rarely works.

W.E. does have a nice sleepy art-house feel to it and it will probably be more popular with Europeans who seems to have an appreciation for this genre.  I can't see very many Americans liking this film and then you have those who will simply ban, knock and criticize this movie after discovering Madonna is the Director.  You would never have guessed it watching this as it was pretty good.

The movie is watchable and the attention to detail with the sets, costume design and actors is top notch.  Aside from the disjointed subplot, the movie gets so lost in the detail to the point where scenes drag longer than they need to.  All in all I was still pleasantly surprised as the movie picked up about mid way through up until the finish line.",1341532800,2,2147,4.532467532467533
4622784,2,B0059XTV4Y,"This is not a film about Wallis and Edward but what little does cover the famous couple was lifted from historian Anne Sebba's book and the biopic film Edward and Mrs. Simpson. She lifted so much from those sources it was a little embarrassing to watch.  Then to top it all off she uses the formula from the film ""The Hours"", where the viewer was forced to jump back and forth between the life of Virginia Wolf and other women without rhyme or reason.  Madonna has some fascination with filming domestic violence since she insinuates that Wallis was somehow bashed around by her husband and so couldn't have children when all accounts of her first two marriages were that she was treated very very well...but social climbers will do as they do. This film is beautifully filmed but unfortunately doesn't have anything poignant to say about anything in particular, the story line is trite, she adds no new insight nor even a new vision or perspective on Wallis and Edward.  She rudely portrays the Queens mother and father in the worst light when they were known to be very low key family whom had the thrown pushed on them.  As with all things Madonna this film is self-indulgent with very little focus spent on the integrity of the storyline, its all beauty over substance with a dash of faux feminism.

If Madonna had focused on the story of Wallis and Edward I'm sure it would have been very good if she could have kept her ego out of it, unfortunately I'm not sure why she made this film.",1341273600,4,1491,4.548507462686567
4622785,3,B0059XTV4Y,"I had heard mostly negative reviews of this movie, so it was not my highest priority when selecting movies to watch on an 8 hour flight back from Europe.  I watched it after ""Young Adult""(very good) and ""Chronicle"" (stupid) and of course it was free to me.  I was glad I did not pay to watch.  I have to admit that from a visual point of view the part of the movie that revolves around Wallis and Edward, rather than Wallie and whatever her husband's name was, is visually stunning (particularly the costumes, makeup, hair).  The contemporary part is flat and monochromatic and frankly all I could think of through most of it was ""Snap out of it and leave him for Pete's sake!""  That was a marriage that was beyond dysfunctional.  I suppose Madonna was trying to send some message about smart women who nonetheless find themselves in controlling relationships, but it fell flat with me.  As for any historical interest in the Wallis and Edward part, you can forget about it - it is highly superficial (providing only a platform for the previously mentioned costumes, makeup, hair) and there were certain aspects that really bothered me (eg the height difference between the actors playing Wallis and Edward - in real life the difference was not that great and in the movie he towers over her).  As to whether the couple were fascist sympathizers or simply freeloaders who went wherever room, board and glamor beckoned is something I frankly don't care about - they certainly had poor judgment about where they went and who they were photographed with.

The real standout in this movie and what made it absolutely worth watching was the romantic soundtrack by Abel Korzeniowski.  After I got back home I bought the soundtrack & I highly recommend it (but I also recommend either seeing the movie free or with a cheap rental and low expectations).",1341100800,2,1845,4.7375

4622788,2,B0059XTV4Y,"I was looking forward to W.E. thinking it was a historical drama based on the love story of the 20th Century. The King of England renounced his throne to be with the woman he loved. What could make a better story?
Unfortunately, Madonna's version is scrambled between fact, fiction and fantasy. The first minutes were confusing as two parallel stories are running. It is the story of Wallis and Edward but it is also the story of Wally, a woman trapped in a loveless marriage in the late 90's dreaming of the romance her namesake enjoyed.

So much potential is missed in this story and often fascinating aspects of the royal love affair are glazed over. We are taken back and forth between stories as Wally connects items at the Duke and Duchess auction at Sotheby's. Wally looks at a tablecloth and that is the transition to the past as that tablecloth is being laid for a dinner party held by the Duke and Duchess.

Kudos should be given to the costume designer and art director of this film. They do take us back to an authentic feeling 1930's England. The detail is remarkable so it is disappointing that this film needs to tell two parallel stories without concentrating on one story. It would be beyond fascinating to be taken deeper into the mind of Wallis Simpson. Just as her king gave up his throne, she gave up all semblances of the life she knew to live a semi-nomadic life as an outcast. David, as he was lovingly known by his family, could not return to England and was all but banished by his family. It would have been intriguing to further explore his relationship with his German-born mother Queen Mary and his relationship with his brother and sister-in-law who ascended the thrown after his abdication. George VI, the current Queen of England's father, is portrayed as a weak and ineffectual man prone to stuttering while his wife, Queen Elizabeth (later to be known as the Queen Mother) is potrayed as rather vile, domineering and heartless. What was the real story?

The idea that once Edward (aka David) abdicated there was no turning back for Wallis Simpson. She was now forever tied to the ex-king. Nothing could be changed and she was destined to be his wife. How happy was the marriage? Was she manipulated by a needy husband who had literally given up the world for her?

Our modern Wally begins to unravel the truth in this not so fairy tale romance. She ""interacts"" with Wallis as if the two are one and she begins to understand Wallis in a symptathetic way that has never been seen before. Wallis is no longer the evil twice-divorced dragon who almost tore an empire apart. She did not want Edward to abdicate, yet he did and the rest was hisory.

Obviously, this film is visually stunning in its scenes from the 1930's. The elegate jewelry and clothing of the Duchess show that an ordinary looking woman can become an object of stunning beauty and inspiration. The film is just lost in its need to run a parallel story set in modern times. A potentially beautiful film is lost in a bad script.",1340064000,5,3025,4.594444444444444

4622833,3,B0059XTV4Y,"Let's get the title out of the way.  Wallis (The ""W."") Simpson (an excellent Andrea Riseborough, ""Never Let Me Go"") was the married American who King Edward (The ""E."") gave up the British throne for.  This film deals with their trials and tribulations but primarily from the perspective of Simpson.  We see this played out in numerous time jumps between the 1930's and the late 1990's as another Wally (Abbie Cornish, ""Limitless"") envisions the pair 6 decades earlier.

Wally has just married a successful clinical psychiatrist, but the marriage isn't going well.  She wants a child; her husband appears to want to just fool around on the side.  An auction at Sotheby's provides additional interest for Wally (named after Ms. Simpson) as many of the royal couple's personal belongings are being auctioned off.  There she meets one of the firm's security personnel played by Oscar Isaac (""Drive"").  This meeting will have consequences down the line.

I believe this is Madonna's first time as a director of a feature film and I do think she has promise.  She also co-wrote this film which is the biggest problem.  At times the movie plays like a Zalman King soft porn film but without the soft porn.  The soundtrack, while pretty, puts the scenes to sleep on occasion not to mention the audience.  But there are also some nice bits, mostly with Ms. Riseborough.  In one scene, she dances with a black woman at a party in France.  While not risqu, it was attention getting.  In another dance sequence she does Chubby Checker's ""The Twist"" for her dying husband in 1972.

The film has a nice look to it, both in the modern and flashback sequences.  This isn't a great movie, but isn't terrible either.  It would have likely gotten better press if not for Madonna's name being attached.

There is certainly nothing to complain about with the 1080p Blu ray transfer.  Shot with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio, the film is beautiful.

The truth about Edward VIII's Nazi links are based upon newly declassified FBI files.  The playboy prince and his relationship with Wallace Simpson, the twice divorced American he married, was a convenient pretext for forcing him into abdicating when the real reason had been deep establishment suspicion of his pro-German views. The British establishment was extremely forgiving towards Edward and deeply sympathetic to fascism.

Simpson had been the lover of German Ambassador von Ribbentrop, (who went on to become Hitler's foreign minister); and as Prince of Wales, heir to the throne, Edward was earmarked by Hitler as a potential puppet king after the Nazi victory.

Its a two folded story one of the famous British love affair  between the man who would become king of England and an american woman, twice divorced; that captured the imaginations and caused an uproar and the other story of an american girl, in modern time, caught up in a nasty marriage with a man that beats her on a daily basis. How would she deal with it, how does her fascination with the royal love affair tie in to the film? You'll just have to see it for yourself. One things for sure, you will enjoy it, its got an amazing eye for detail, the costumes are identical to the era, and the films score is magical.

I wasn't disappointed.  The film is visually perfect and demands repeated viewings.  The story and acting is also very good, however the flashbacks showing the duke and duchess is where it gets a little thin.  It skirts video territory instead of film, but still - extremely well done.

is or was lost to tragic circumstances.  Flashing forward to today, a young bride, ""Wallie"" played by the beautiful Abbie Cornish, is lost in an abusive marriage that flashes back and forth between her
and Wallice Simpson, and their similar lives with objects of desire, difficult decisions, regrets, etc.  Andrea Risebrough is so striking as Wallis Simpson you can't take your eyes off of her.  I was much more taken with the story of Wallis and Edward, even though I sympathized with Wallie, I wanted her to hurry up and leave her husband.  I kept thinking, let's get back to Wallis and Edward,

 The movie is full of dancing, beautiful costumes, and maybe one of the best original scores I've ever heard  in a movie, lots of heavy piano, and violin, 5 stars for that.  It's so romantic and yet tragic.  I recommend this film to everyone interested in Wallis and Edward as people and their romance, as well as costumes designers, interior decorators, and the like.  Believe me they left no stone unturned.  It's quite remarkable. This film is a new take on an old romance from the writers point of view, which was quite empathic.

W.E.althy people.  Beautiful people.  W.E.ary people.

The year is 1998.  Wally Winthrop, a rich, married and miserable New Yorker, finds solace in an exhibition recently opened at Sotheby's celebrating the circa 1930's romance of then Prince Edward and Wallis Simpson, an American woman for whose love he forfeited his throne.

And by that feeble thread hangs this hollow bauble of a film.  From Cartier jewelry boxes and bottles of Chanel No. 5 to repeated flashes of uncorked Mot, every frame is a page from Vanity Fair.  The present-day Wally seemingly exists for no other purpose than to justify these gratuitous advertisements: she once had a job at Sotheby's, yet even the unhappy marriage for which she gave it up has not dulled her eye for the finer things.  Indeed, when she's not moping about her impossibly posh apartment she's moping about in Sotheby's, bringing herself to tears as she covets the luxurious artifacts from Wallis's and Edward's life together.  And once their romance is (rather quickly) established as the excuse for Wally to indulge her predilection, it only takes one awful dialogue - there are many of these, but the one that follows is perhaps the most audacious (and therefore the worst) - to drag the film from rather absurd into quite absurd: a security guard from Sotheby's has developed a crush on Wally, and he approaches her one day after an auction:

Guard: So are you or aren't you?
Wally: Huh?
Guard: Going to bid on something?
Wally: Oh god no!
Guard: Why?
Wally: Too nerve-wrecking.

And that's as tense as it gets, I'm afraid.  No wait.  The next day Wally bids $10,000 on a pair of Wallis Simpson's gloves.  Some pantomime spousal abuse is then shoe-horned in to give Wally's story some gravitas.  As for Prince Edward, his devotion to Wallis Simpson becomes so slavish that it's embarrassing.  Historically accurate or artistic license?  I haven't bothered to check, but it's cringingly insipid either way.

In conclusion, this is an altogether pointless film in that, when it isn't advertising in its artistically artless way, it depicts improbable persons suffering unbelievable traumas.

Clearly intended as a stopgap for Sex and the City 3.",1336521600,6,2209,5.016483516483516
4622906,4,B0059XTV4Y,"The much maligned, brief theatrical film by Madonna - W.E. - fairs better on the small screen than it likely did in the movie houses. The stories are bifurcated, each one resembling a television creation - one a docudrama biopic, the other a contemporary soap opera.  That Madonna, who directed and wrote the screenplay with Alek Keshishian, decided to mix the two stories is a bit daring but in some ways it works very well.  In other ways the parallel stories seem like time traveling cars on the same highway that never quite travel at the same speed or quality.

The film mixes the notorious affair between King Edward VIII and American divorce Wallis Simpson with a contemporary romance between a married woman and a Russian security guard. The time is 1998 and at an auction of the estate of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor unhappily married ex-Sotheby employee Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish) becomes obsessed by their historic love story. Her own marriage to womanizing, abusive psychiatrist William (Richard Coyle) undermines her feelings of worth and as she learns more about the sacrifices involved in the famous affair, she gains her own courage to find happiness.

The film flips back and forth between the present and the 1930s and it is the historical aspect of the film that is almost flawless. We get to know Wallis Simpson (in a brilliant portrayal by Andrea Riseborough) and understand her failed first two marriages (at the time we meet her she is still married to Ernest Simpson played by David Harbour), and see the American sizzle that made her the talk of England. When Wallis wrangles her way to meet Prince Edward, better known as David, (James D'Arcy) there is a chemistry that develops to the point of passion and ultimately leads to Wallis divorcing Ernest to marry Edward - a deed that leads to Edward's abdication of the throne for `the woman I love', which he had assumed when King George V (James Fox) dies, to his stammering brother Bertie (Laurence Fox) and his caustic wife Elizabeth (Natalie Dormer).  The paparazzi make their life miserable and the couple is not allowed to return to England until Edward dies, with the faithful Wallis supportively by his side through 36 years of marriage.

Wally - meanwhile - longs to be pregnant but sustains such abuse from William that she ultimately yields to the loving friendship the auction house Russian security guard Evgeni (Oscar Isaac) and begins her life again.  The two stories are connected by Wally's obsession with the royal couple's notorious affair and at auction's end she is given access to private letters between Wallis and Edward that have been in the possession of Mohamed Al-Fayed (Haluk Bilginer) - a tacked on ending that feels ill at ease and redundant.

Everyone connected t the biopic angle of this film is excellent and Madonna shows that she knows how to direct affairs of the heart in a royal situation very well indeed. Both Andrea Riseborough and James D'Arcy are superb and the costumes and music and cinematography of this historical portion are exceptionally well done.  Though the idea of the contemporary sluggish story is reasonable, Abbie Cornish seems uncomfortable with the script: Oscar Isaac shines as her new love.  In all the film, though spotty, has merit and it not a bad debut for Madonna as director.  Grady Harp, May 12",1336435200,24,3346,4.873239436619718
4622907,5,B0059XTV4Y,"W.E. is an excellent drama about two parallel stories with similar themes.  Wally Winthrop is an upper class wife of a blue blooded psychiatrist in Manhattan who feels trapped in her loveless and abusive marriage in 1998.  She was named after Wallis Simpson whose scandalous romance with the future King of England Edward VIII rocked 1930's England when he decided to give up the throne for the love of this woman and to marry her. Wally becomes obsessed with the story of Wallis and Edward (W.E.) when their belongings are auctioned at Sotheby's.  The two stories transition back and forth between the two Wallys and one of the main questions in the story is what defines true love and what does one have to sacrifice for true love if it's found?  Why would King Edward give up being king and an entire country for a woman?  What did Wallis Simpson give up to be with the king and spent the rest of her life hated by the press and ostracized by so many?  Madonna wrote a very original and unique script and did an excellent job as director.  The sense of period is precise and every detail is right, even the fact that Wallis Simpson was left handed, now that's detailed precision!  The look of the film and production values and cinematography are beautiful and top notch and the musical score is excellent and appropriate for setting the mood.

4622960,4,B0059XTV4Y,"Like many people I know the story of Edward and Wallis.  And unlike many people I always saw it as a romanticized tale.  Edward VIII gave up a throne he never really wanted, but this film asks us to consider what Wallis Simpson surrendered.  Most histories see her as having gained advantage by her position, this film suggests otherwise, and rightly so. As for Wallis and Edward, watching him ask her to dance for his amusement, even in old age, says it all.

I had heard some of the negatives, but wanted to see Madonna's interpretation, and I found the film quietly effective. I'm not a Maddona fan, but as a director she was foreign territory.  She did well, intertwining the two stories, the overlay of emotions and the gentle stripping away of a veneer that's been so frequently painted over the story.  I followed the modern narrative with more interest than expected, and overall found the film very satisfying. The attitudes of George V and his wife are speculation, (they're portrayed as weak and shrewish) as the film overlooks how much they were forced to sacrifice when Edward VIII abdicated.  After all, the stress and pressure of the throne were serious factors in George V's early demise.

Perhaps Madonna is saying something about her own misery with fame (albeit, self inflicted) perhaps not, but forget she's there and enjoy the film.  It is fair enough to say that she has more talent as a director behind the camera, than as an actress in front.",1336262400,3,1466,4.7176470588235295

4622964,4,B0059XTV4Y,"There are two sides to every story, and in this carefully crafted biopic merged with fiction, Madonna tries to tell us the story of Wallis Simpson, the commoner a monarch left his kingdom to marry. Though maligned by the critics, W.E. is an exquisite film.

Young Wally (Abbie Cornish) has inherited more from Wallis Simpson than her name. Her mother and grandmother were obsessed with the American divorcee, and so is Wally. Once an employee at a world-renowned auction house, now an upper society housewife with too much time on her hands, she is in a marriage of convenience for security and longs for a romance like Wallis had. Her psychologist husband (Richard Coyle) spends most of his time at work... or with his cell phone off, leaving her to pace her beautiful upper Manhattan apartment and dream.

In the late 1930's, Wallis (Andrea Riseborough) is married to a good-natured man after a disastrous first marriage that ended in abuse and left her unable to bear children. Though suffering from a bad cold, she insists on being present at a party in which His Royal Majesty the Prince of Wales, ""David"" (James D'Arcy) to his family and friends, is in attendance. There are immediate sparks between them, but for a time Wallis merely ""looks after him"" for one of her friends. But when that friendship turns into something more, their love affair threatens to tear a nation apart on the eve of war.

Critics have slammed this film for everything from its directorial style to the script. I happen to think they are all wrong. For a debut film by a first-time director, this is a masterpiece. Madonna knows movement and how to use it. She knows how to tell a story through female protagonists. She knows how to tug on our heartstrings and make a woman overshadowed by scandal and rumors a likable figure. That is what she did for me: she took a scandalous, notorious woman and made me like her. Not just a little bit, but a lot. Films from this era take a position on the scandal, either in favor of it or against it. This one doesn't. It presents the relationship for what it was, a unique and at times absurd affair. Yes, it is somewhat soft on their fondness for socializing and does its best to gloss over their Nazi empathies, but never did it feel overly defensive or contrived. In the end, it is a film about normal people who just happen to have titles attached to their names.

The past setting is exquisite, with beautifully crafted costumes, jewelry, and a perfect cast that expands to include Laurence Fox, Natalie Dormer, and Oscar Isaac. If there is one fault with the script, it is that most of it revolves around present time and Wally, while her story is less interesting than that of Wallis. I raised my brow a bit to find out that the past and present characters would interact, but it works out well, with their lives intersecting and paralleling one another from time to time. I would have liked a bit more with Wallis and David, but there is enough. The musical score is also beautiful, ranging from passionate piano pieces to more modern pop songs. But rather than being jarring, they give us a sense of excitement and fun.

Either this is a movie you are going to love, or hate. Much like public opinion on the romance itself, there is no middle ground. It glosses over some of the unsavory aspects of this couple (such as David's meanness to his brother Bertie) but doesn't hesitate to show us the brutal truth about everything Wallis went through. David may have given up his throne to be with her... but she gave up everything else.

Parental Concerns: brief backside nudity, a scene in which a man drags a woman naked from a bathtub and beats her up (resulting in a miscarriage). 5 f-words, one abuse of Jesus' name.",1336003200,6,3749,4.604790419161676
4622965,5,B0059XTV4Y,"Madonna has been a superstar in the music world, and she will definitely remain so in the history books. She has also been involved in movies, and her career in Hollywood has not been as successful as she probably wished. So it was a surprise that she got green-lighted to direct W.E.,"" a period film, with a moderate budget - big risk, I would say. But the movie, I believe, works. It is an honest, passionate and elegant look at one of the most controversial romances of all time.

The film's main story is about the love affair between King Edward VIII (James D'Arcy) and Wallis Simpson (Andrea Riseborough). However, instead of telling the story as is, Madonna chose to include a parallel, contemporary story involving Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish) and William Winthrop (Richard Coyle). The film opens with Wallis Simpson waiting for her first husband, Winfield Spencer, to have dinner together. He shows up late and is unhappy that his dinner is not served. He beats Wallis, who is pregnant, causing a miscarriage. We then move to 1998, and meet Wally Winthrop, who is also waiting for her husband, to have dinner together, something that also doesn't happen. In this case, her husband was having fun with other ladies. In her lonesomeness, Wally (who was named after Wallis Simpson), visits an exhibition featuring King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson's memorabilia, which would later be sold in an auction. While viewing the objects, she daydreams about their famous romance, in which King Edward VIII surrendered his crown to marry Wallis, a twice-divorced American woman. It was a scandal at the time, which caused the couple to live in exile. The rest of the movie deals with Wally's problems with her husband, intertwined with aspects of the royal controversy.

""W.E."" is quite stylish and with a great, eclectic soundtrack. I found the comparisons of both couple's problems very interesting. And this is understandable, as Madonna Louise Ciccone has been known to be vocal on women's rights. This film, in addition of being about the King Edward VIII-Simpson sacrilegious romance, is also about courageous women and true love. I would venture to say that this film should be viewed together with ""The King's Speech,"" also a Weinstein production/Anchor Bay release, because it deals with the Duke of York, the brother that succeeded and inherited King Edward VIII's throne. The Blu-ray + DVD +Digital Copy edition of the film includes a making-of documentary (UK, 2011, color, 119 mins plus additional materials).

Madonna took the iconic figures for true love of the 20th Century - Wallis and Edward, and takes a compassionate look at the couple.  At the same time their love story is related to the present-day story of a woman trapped in marriage to a selfish and abusive albeit successful doctor.

The film tells the stories of being trapped inside of relationships, and women seeking emancipatory experiences, much like ""Eat, Love, Pray.""

Like JULIE & JULIA, the picture tells two parallel stories.  One deals with Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish) an unhappily married woman during the 1990swho is totally obsessed with Wallis Simpson (Andrea Riseborough), and even imagines having conversations with her.  Indeed, in one of these fantasy moments, Simpson turns to Wally and snaps, ""Get a life!""  The other story follows the path of Edward (James D'Arcy) and the woman who caused him to abdicate the throne of England.

The actors are excellent, as is Madonna's direction.  The problem with this film is that the modern story, which dominates, is really not as intriguing as the historical one, even though we know how that one will turn out.  Unfortunately, it's apparent from the start how the fictional Wally Winthrop's saga is going to end also.

The movie does, however, make some interesting points about the difference between the legendary ""fairy tale"" romance and reality.

Oscar Isaac, Natalie Dormer, Richard Coyle and James Fox co-star in the film, released in a 3-disc (DVD/Blu-Ray/Digital) set by Anchor Bay Entertainment.  The sole extra is a well  done ""Making of"" featurtette.

It might be tempting to use those extremes given that movie was directed and co-written by Madonna. It may be even more tempting to use the latter of those extremes, given that many people are not always inclined to love Madonna and her work, even more so when we are talking about cinema.

This movie has two stories: the story of WE and, more contemporary, story of Wally. Neither story is fully developed, and perhaps, at times, it seems that Wally's story is even better developed, or at least more salient, than WE's. For those who have a profound interest in King Edward VIII's biography, the movie might be just enough in terms of content.

In any case, despite the gaps, the two stories stimulate varied thoughts.  Both stories revolve around their views of womanhood and, perhaps, the place that a man may have in a woman's life, particularly in her happiness. A related question covered in the movie is that pertaining to the dimension of the sacrifice: which required the greatest amount of sacrifice, King Edward VIII's abdication or Wallis Simpson's loss of her personal life?

Finally, the camera rarely stays still, offering varied perspectives into the different scenes, and, almost always, offering varied forms of beauty. In fact this movie is a feast of visual and auditory pleasant stimuli.",1522540800,,1407,4.825726141078838

8463090,5,B0059XTV4Y,"An impressive piece of film making. The nuance in the characterization of Wallis Simpson has been a long time in coming. It's been too easy to demonize her due to her mystery and the context of her time. Andrea Riseborough as Simpson continues to mesmerize as she creates stand-out performances. The entire cast did a fine job and the direction was excellent. The timeline of the film is split between Simpson's prime in the 1930's and the auction of the Windsor Estate sometime after her death. Abbie Cornish plays the part of Wally Winthrop, a contemporary woman fascinated with Simpson who repeatedly visits the auction at Sotheby's. If you're only interested in Simpson's story, be aware Winthrop gets considerable screen time. Winthrop learns more about herself and the direction she wants in life, after vicariously living through Simpson. This isn't a safely narrated film, which it easily could be given the incredible attention to period detailing, jewelry and costumes of the 1930's. It takes risks and is a greater film for it.",1518652800,,1038,5.040697674418604

8463092,1,B0059XTV4Y,"Boring. I was looking at the time halfway through. It's pretty, but has no substance. It jumps so fast between Abbie Cornish's story in the 1990s and Wallis & Edward in the 30s, that you rarely get a significant amount of time in a scene to learn about the characters. It's hard to care about Wally because we don't know anything about her. She was named after Wallis and idolizes her; she wants to have kids; she liked working at Sotheby's. These are all things that she says aloud -- viewers don't learn anything about her through observation of her or her surroundings. The modern-day apartment doesn't look like a real home, but an advertisement -- a set for a photo shoot, and Cornish spends most of her scenes fondling antiques and daydreaming.

This film also skips over parts of Wallis and Edward's story that would be fascinating to learn about. At one point, Wallis leaves Edward and tells him they can't be together and won't make each other happy. It skips to Abbie Cornish daydreaming, then suddenly back to Edward abdicating the throne and leaving with Wallis. How did they get back together? That would have been an interesting story. Instead, this movie just strings highlights of W.E.'s life together without much of a narrative, and too much time is spent on the slow-paced story of Abbie Cornish. Oscar Issac is cute, though.",1516838400,,1344,4.743589743589744
8463093,5,B0059XTV4Y,"I give ""W.E."" 5 out of 5 stars.
The movie alternates between the present day and the past. Wally, a woman in our present day, has become infatuated with the love story of Wallis and David. The story of Wallis and David is told through personal objects from the Windsor estate which will be auctioned off at Sotheby's. As the story of Wally and Wallis unfolds, the characters of Wally and Wallis begin to interact with each other. In the end, Wallis's life story proves to be a cautionary tale for Wally.
I can honestly say Madonna is a better director/screenplay writer than she is a musician/performer. She is extremely knowledgeable about the topic of Wallis and David. Attention to detail was given to the entire movie, from costumes, to music, to the locations used for shooting, and even down to the type of film to shoot the movie in.
Andrea Riseborough should have won an Oscar for her performance as Wallis Simpson. She captured every aspect of Wallis beautifully. And then there is Abel Korzeniowski's musical score, which I can only say is perfection itself.
I would recommend watching the documentary on the dvd first because it will provide you with information which is helpful to the viewer.
""W.E"" is definitely worth your time to watch.",1512086400,,1251,4.7695852534562215
