183142,5,156158889X,"We bought it to introduce our grandson to wood carving. The video on CD discussed a wonderful variety of techniques and styles, along with a good idea of the range of tools needed for each.  As an overview it was wonderful.  If you want to learn each style and technique, you will most likely need to add supplemental material for each style and technique.",1357516800,2,356,4.546875

Chips fly as forms take shape before one's eyes.  Everything for a Forest Spirit (Cottonwood Bark) to a Duck Decoy.  Simple techniques - (taking a photograph and tracing over it with carbon paper to produce a pattern on wood) - turned into elegant works of art.,1408924800,,433,5.042253521126761
