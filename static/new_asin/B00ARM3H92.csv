8556963,5,B00ARM3H92,"I was very glad to see that a new (2012) video had been released on this topic, as I teach high school and college economics. The film covers a range of money topics, including footage of the design and printing of paper money, coinage, gold topics, the Federal Reserve and counterfeiting. It shows the ""Super Bill"" counterfeit from North Korea and how it inspired redesign of U.S. currency.  The video also includes information on virtual money such as BitCoin. A well-done informative video.",1358380800,,493,4.9397590361445785
