8330501,2,B001ODK3P4,"Munich is one of the great destination cities, and although the footage is accurate the narration is so stupid it boarders on ridiculous.  If you have visited Munich, and liked it, skip this.  If you are planning to go, watch something else, or view it without sound.",1492473600,,267,4.659574468085107

8330506,4,B001ODK3P4,"Having traveled to Bavaria 3 times now, I really enjoyed watching this DVD. I purchased it primarily to showcase the region to my parents (who are going to visit there in December). I highly recommend this video, however I am a bit surprised that the content does not include a mention of Nuremberg. Everything else is covered well, but this beautiful city is left out. Perhaps it was because the video was shot primarily in the summer. It would have been nice to see at least one Bavarian area covered during the Christmas season, and Nuremberg would have been the place to cover. Otherwise, this is a great product, worthy of owning.",1463011200,,635,4.678571428571429
8330507,4,B001ODK3P4,Interesting film of the Bavarian region of Germany. My wife and I have been to Europe but never to Germany.
