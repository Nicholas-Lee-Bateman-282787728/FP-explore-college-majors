8032489,4,B0002V7O2E,"Fina Episode (1974) is the last installment of Kinji Fukasaku's The Yakuza Papers: Battles Without Honor & Humanity. I like the fact that Jo Shishido joins yakuza stalwarts like Bunta Sugawara and Akira Kobayashi in the series. It didn't end the way I thought it would, I was expecting Hirano to get his justice, but he ends up walking away from the life  of a gangster after more than 30 years as a yakuza. It was an epic story with lots of realistic violence captured by hand held cameras setting a new standard for movie violence.",1393372800,3,533,4.552083333333333
