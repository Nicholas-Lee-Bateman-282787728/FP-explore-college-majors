Yes, a very important film to remind us what can and does happen when dictatorships occur and human rights are literally stripped away. The film is brutal, without question. It is very difficult to watch at times. It will make you think. Although what we are seeing in this film is frightful and disgustingly demonstrates what happens when your human rights and dignity are taken away. This is just a glimpse at these horrors. The tortures and depraved behaviours really do go beyond our ability to understand man's inhumanity and cruelty to man. How can one become so brutal and destroy another human being physically. mentally, and emotionally? If you truly do care about your fellow man, it will haunt you for days. That's guaranteed.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cronica-De-Una-Fuga-Chronicle-of-an-Escape-2-DVD-Special-Collectors-Edition-NTSC-REGION-1-4-DVD-Import-Latin-America/dp/B000QBV3BI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cronica De Una Fuga (Chronicle of an Escape) 2 DVD Special Collectors Edition [NTSC/REGION 1 & 4 DVD.

8195493,4,B000QBV3BI,"""Crnica de una fuga"" (=""Chronicle of an escape"", also called ""Buenos Aires 1977""), directed by Adrin Caetano, is one of those films that it is difficult to watch, but that you should see. Based on a real story, the cast is so good that you tend to forget that you are watching a movie, something that doesn't make for a comfortable evening, but that is necessary.

Caetano recounts what really happened during the 1976-1983 Argentinian dictatorship to Claudio Tamburrini (played Rodrigo De La Serna), a young man that had nothing to do with politics, but that was abducted by members of the Argentine military police engaged in a ""dirty war"" against terrorism. Claudio was taken to a clandestine detention center called ""Mansin Ser (""Ser Mansion""), where he was tortured along with other prisoners. ""Crnica de una fuga"" tells us what happened to Claudio and some of those prisioners at the ""Mansin Ser"", and how some of them finally managed to escape from certain death, running for freedom.

""Crnica de una fuga"" makes you have an idea of what many suspected left activists when through in Argentina during the 1976-1983 military dictatorship. However, even though this movie refers to what happened in Argentina in the '70 s, I believe that it can also serve the purpose of directing your attention to what is happening nowadays in countries without democratic regimes.

In a 2006 Cannes interview Adrian Caetano highlights that idea, saying that he didn't make this movie in order to start a debate specifically about what had happened in Argentina during the last military dictatorship of our history. From his point of view, ""It's about a crime against humanity, something totally unjustified,"" ""So the political message of the film is to defend human rights."" I think he more than made his point in ""Crnica de una fuga"". Recommended...
