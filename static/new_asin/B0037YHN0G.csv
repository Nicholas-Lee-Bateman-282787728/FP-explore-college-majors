Why buy it?  It is on tv for every anniversary of his life, death, announcement of of This is It, Memorial, etc.",1333324800,,307,4.169491525423729
8390881,1,B0037YHN0G,"Not worth the money as this is a repeat of past DVD's of Michael Jackson - I believe ""Life of a Superstar"" which I paid $5.00 for at wal-mart vs. $15.00 I paid here for the same thing!! They're just changing the looks to get us MJ fans to buy something we all already have. Now, I pay special attention to all the DVD's purchased here as anyone will do anything to make a $1.00.",1308787200,,378,4.053333333333334
8390882,1,B0037YHN0G,This DVD showed me that there are people who are only interested in making money off of the life of Michael Jackson.  This DVD is only a collection of video footage of MJ put together very poorly.  I was very bored watching the DVD and upset that those responsible with making the DVD would attempt to market such a terrible product to the public.  I would advice true Michael Jackson fans to avoid purchasing this DVD.  Of couurse you do not have to take my word for it just purchase the DVD and see for yourself.,1280188800,,514,4.322916666666667
8390883,1,B0037YHN0G,"I purchased this DVD from Amazon not knowing that it was a duplicate of one I already had. I had purchased this same DVD at Target for $4.99 and was disappointed at that price. Knowing that I ended up paying an additional $15.00 for the same DVD was a blow.

When it says unauthorized, it means it. The video quality was very poor. There were many inaccuracies in it as well relying heavily on biased media video clips. One of the worst statements in the video was in regard to the contract between Sony and Michael Jackson back in the early 2000's. It implied that Sony was disappointed with sales and terminated the contract. That is just not true. It was Michael Jackson who found a way to get out of the contract. When that announcement was made, Sony was no longer actively promoting the Invincible album.

Do not buy this DVD. You will be disappointed. I actually am thinking about throwing both of them in the trash.",1276473600,5,923,4.488095238095238
8390884,2,B0037YHN0G,"I just finish looking at the In Memory Of Michael Jackson 1958-2009 DVD it is the same Documentary of Michael Jackson Life of A Super Star.if you have this do not buy it.
