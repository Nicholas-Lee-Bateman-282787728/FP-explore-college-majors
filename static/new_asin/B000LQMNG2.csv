8163698,5,B000LQMNG2,"If you have never checked out Roger Eberts's ""Great Movies"" list go to his website wwwdotrogerebertdotcom there is a link on his homepage labeled Great Movies, these movies are also compiled into books which are a great purchase for any movie lover.  If you do actually look at the list of ""Great Movies"" and see the company that Moolaade keeps, it is very impressive for such a recent release of 2004.
I, however have never seen it and after reading Roger Ebert's review i am writing this not as a review of this movie (which i will do once released) but to bring attention albeit a small amount to it and hopefully with our votes and comments we can get an important film released.
I live in Central Massachusetts about 50 minutes from Boston so movies like this generally do not play in my area.  I believe theaters and executives in charge most likely think the general public doesn't want to see a powerful movie with a message, or perhaps they think the general public won't get it.  I'm guessing they do their homework, it's math, it's a business and their figures show that the vast majority of the American public want, to quote the great Sidney Lumet movie (also on Roger Ebert's Great Movie list) Network, ""a cure for their boredom"".  Sadly I would say in most circumstances they are right.  With 2007 being the year of the next installment in billion dollar franchises with Pirates of the Caribbean 3, Spider Man 3, Shrek 3, The Bourne Ultimatum, Live Free or Die Hard, The 5th Harry Potter movie, and Ocean's 13 to name a few.  Alot of these movies are great entertainment and some I'm sure are really good I've liked alot of the movies in the franchises I've mentioned also, but it would be nice to get a variety and instead of a cure for ADD and boredom for a few hours perhaps be inspired or learn something new.
Realistically and fortunately though people that love the cinema and look at it as an art form have dvds as an option.  Better yet with newer technology like Hd-dvd and Blu-ray we can see classics like The Searchers (also on Ebert's Great Movies list)in amazing transfers.  With affordable and not so affordable front projectors and screens above 100"" we can get that theater feel in our homes.  With Plasmas aesthetically pleasing to the eyes with amazing details and brights showcasing HD, pleasing couples everywhere.  With Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 and 7.1 sound we can make our living rooms, family rooms, dedicated home theater room equal or surpass that of a movie theaters sound.  If you are lucky enough to have a rare movie like this in your area you may hear the explosions from the theater next door going off.
So share your thoughts by commenting below and if you see a movie that you think has significance write about it, Amazon gives a great forum we should take advantage.  Also If you have never checked out Roger Ebert's Great movie series i would highly highly recommend it to anyone. He is not just a thumbs up guy on a t.v show and has won the Pulitzer Prize in criticism i believe the only one to ever do that.  Seeing the ""Great Movies"" has really opened me up to different tastes and experiences. Reading the reviews later really gives you a different perspective or helps you see something you may not have seen before.",1183248000,,3274,4.566552901023891
