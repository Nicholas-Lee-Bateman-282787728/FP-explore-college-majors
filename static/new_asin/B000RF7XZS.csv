8254235,2,B000RF7XZS,if you have seen ghetto brawls then don't waste your money on this dvd. it doesnt even come close to some of the fights on ghetto brawls and there are even a couple of the same fights. ghetto ass fight club is a waste of money the fights seemed staged and they are basically boring. you can see better fights at the neighborhood bar.,1257292800,,333,4.21875

The DVD only contains a few fights and the fact that the picture  quality was bad to say the least was only one blow below the belt. They felt the need to add insult to injury by adding the slow motion effects which only made the viewing experience longer and more painfull to sit through. I would have to say it was a flop, on a scale of one to ten I give it a two at best. They need to take a page out of the book of Felony Fights now thats entertainment.",1204329600,4,536,4.009345794392523
