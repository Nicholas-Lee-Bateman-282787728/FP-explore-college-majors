8604754,5,B00EEIJTTC,Haven't finished the whole DVD yet but it's taking me back!  Studying Hapkido back in 2007 learning different techniques.  This DVD is showing me more especially with slow motion replay as well as in depth positions of hands/feet.  Learning/relearning things whether they be new or old.  Miss the classes so much as I encourge anyone to learn the old traditional styles of martial arts as well as MMA.,1432252800,,401,4.852941176470588
