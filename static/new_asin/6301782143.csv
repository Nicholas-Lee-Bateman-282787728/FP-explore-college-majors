8551162,1,6301782143,"For anybody who's looking for the 1978 movie with Lauren Bacall - this is not it !  Actually it's a 12 minute CBS music video by a group called ""Perfect Gentleman"" with 2 titles on it: ""Ooh la la""  and  ""One more Chance"". This is not a rating of this video (I didn't bother watching it) but just of the fact that there's absolutely no information in the Amazon product details which could have told me this wasn't the feature film I was looking for before I ordered it. That's even more a pity as it was the fastest delivery I ever got from the US to Europe by Mail - a very short-lived joy.",1238025600,12,591,4.121739130434783
