8612133,5,B00F3ROFWE,"This is Kalk Samen Kuri no Hana-era Ringo playing with the immensely talented Tokyo Jihen and without any of the grandeur or (frankly amazing) stage production of her later Expos. Basically, this is the best Ringo, at least in terms of songwriting and live energy. Honestly, I'd rank most of these live performances way above their recorded counterparts, and I listened the crap out of those records. These musicians are just that insane. And as if the music wasn't enough by itself (it is), you get behind-the-scenes footage of rehearsals and just general goofing around. I feel unworthy just watching these clips.

If you think Shiina Ringo's first three records are her strongest, this will likely be the perfect concert DVD/Blu-ray for you. One word of warning about the Blu-ray edition: it definitely appears to be an up-scaling, and it looks like neither edition are widescreen, so there is that. Also, definitely get this at under 50 bucks. Paying 100 dollars for this is insane, no matter how good it is.",1432080000,,1012,4.918128654970761
