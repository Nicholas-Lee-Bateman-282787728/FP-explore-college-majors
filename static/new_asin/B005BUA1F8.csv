4647519,5,B005BUA1F8,The 3rd season had to be the best - Still having George Wilson (Joseph Kearns) as neighbor was great - it was sad to see that he died that season. It was great to have Gail Gordon take over as his brother John Wilson to finish out the series. Gail Gordon also a great actor as Mr. Mooney and Harry Carter in The Lucy Show and Here's Lucy. He also appeared in I Love Lucy as Ricky's boss at the night club. He was also a judge on The Lucy and Desi comedy hour. The final show that Gail Gordon did with Lucille Ball was Life with Lucy. Looking foward to season 4 of Dennis the Menace.,1317772800,22,582,3.982905982905983

Dennis was really a good kid, who tried hard to be nice to everyone and help his friends and neighbors.

4647597,5,B005BUA1F8,"I remember in the late 1980s,Nickleodean would air back-to-back episodes of Dennis The Menace on Saturday afternoons. I began taping and saving these episodes thinking that this may be the last chance to archive these shows. As it turned out it would be the last time these shows were broadcast for many years,so I was very glad I had my 4 VHS tapes of Dennis.
I still have those tapes,but I now have 3 of the 4 seasons on DVD.I'll always remember how precious those tapes and that show were to me. I remember Dennis being there in the earliest days of my youth in the mid 1960s. Probably at about 8 AM on Channel 10 in Philadelphia. Was it on sick days ? I remember the gloomy light of early morning and that theme song with the cartoon tornado that was to represent Dennis. It's this and so much more that always takes me back to being a small boy, and what a joy it was to watch this show back then. So often I wish that these shows,along with Leave It To Beaver,could have been rerun on Sunday nights ,when there were never any good shows broadcast in my area. I'm now my own station manager in charge of what goes on the air on Sunday nights here at my house. This is our latest addition,Season Three of Dennis The Menace. It's the last full season for Joe Kearns as Mr. Wilson. I've learned over the years what a versatile actor Kearns was in the days of Old-Time Radio. If you're curious, please do yourself a favor and do a little on-line research on him,then play some old Jack Benny shows,with Joe playing Jack's live in security guard Ed,who lives year round in Benny's basement,guarding Jack's fortune. Or maybe play an episode of Suspense where Joe was the main ""tour guide"" to the show for many years. He was probably the busiest man in radio. How strange it was for him to be replaced,after his sudden death.by perhaps the second-busiest man in radio history, Gale Gordon. Gordon was another of my all-time favorite caracter actors.
There's no need for me to analyze season three. It's just more of the same fun. The Chemistry  of Kearns and the frustrating Dennis is enough to keep us all smiling for years to come. Turn your kids on to it so they can pass it on to theirs'.",1405123200,,2190,4.394088669950739

It's good clean show and back when times were simplier and much more ""family oriented"" as I wish it still was today. Dennis seems to get in all sorts of funny situations and I personally love the entire series as Season 3 seems to be pretty good. I think my fave episode on Season 3 was the Drug Store shopping spree.

The one { 1 } thing that I Don't like to much is that they had Replaced Mr. Wilson with his brother { the Character, NOT in Real Life }, and there Wasn't anything explaining why he was Replaced, they just all of a sudden had Written Out the Original Mr. Wilson and in his place they had brought into the show his brother { in Character that is, NOT in Real Life }.  Why didn't they say that he was leaving the show because of illness, going to be with a Dying Family Member, or a Very Good and Close Friend or something like that?  At least that would make allot more sense then deciding to Drop him for the Remainder of the Season { if NOT for the Remainder of the Series }.

It is sad that Joseph Kearns, the man that played Mr. Wilson, died suddenly during this season.  I highly recommend seasons one through three.  I will get season four when it comes out, but am not sure if it will be as good as the first three seasons without Joseph Kearns and as Jay North gets older.  I was so glad when this series finally became available on DVD.  Highly recommended.",1323302400,,532,4.227722772277228
4647675,5,B005BUA1F8,"Once again let's all thank Shout Factory! for the fabulous job they've done with producing these sets, and getting them out in a timely fashion, here we are at the end of the year, and we already have the first 3 seasons, and the first season wasn't released until spring of this year, I've been amazed at how fast they've come out, and there is only one more season to go, and that will be released in January.

As for the contents itself, if you've already bought the first 2 seasons, you know what you're getting, all of the episodes uncut, which there are a whopping 38 of them just like season 2, now they haven't been remastered or anything, but these episodes look really good for something that is about 50 years old, the audio can be a bit low sometimes, but not to the point where you can't hear it, once again, these episodes are about 50 years old without remastering, so no complaints there, there are no extras on this season, would have been nice to get a couple of promos or something like seasons 1 and 2, but that's just nitpicking.

As for the season itself, I feel this is the best season yet, I can remember watching these shows when I was growing up in the late 1980's and early 1990's on Nick at Nite and Nickelodeon, it brings me back to my childhood, and they are even better today, like I said all 38 episodes which includes great one such as, 'Trouble from Mars' in which Mr. Wilson gets Dennis' space helmet stuck on his head, 'Mr. Wilson's Safe' in which Mr. Wilson locks something important in his safe, and can't remember the combination, 'Dennis and the Dodger' which features Sandy Koufax as himself, 'Wilson goes to the Dentist' and many more, also, this is the season where the original Mr. Wilson (Joseph Kearns) passed away near the end of the season, and thus introduces us to his brother John Wilson, played by (Gale Gordon) of 'Lucy' fame, and he was a perfect step-in, I like both era's.

So there you have it, season 3 in all it's glory, and now we just have to wait until January to get the final season, great job Shout Factory!",1323129600,8,2072,4.404699738903394

4647679,5,B005BUA1F8,"""Dennis the Menace"" is a sitcom you can be proud to share with your entire family. The episodes are wholesome and always packed with a lot of fun and mayhem. The season 3 set includes all 38 eps, in the original broadcast order on a total of 5 discs. These are the complete episodes and the video and audio quality is exceptional (Shout! always does a great job). Some of my favorite eps include the Christmas show and The Fifty-Thousandth Customer. Both Joseph Kearns and Jay North were always absolutely hysterical together. Each of the discs includes a color, silkscreen picture on it and an insert with an episode guide is also included (see scans of everything I posted). No special bonuses are offered, but at this price even Mr. Wilson would agree that it's more than worth it. If you're a fan of classic sitcoms of the '60s, family-friendly programs or have fond memories of growing up watching DTM (either during its original run or when it was on Nick at Nite) you're sure to love this set.",1319932800,14,1000,4.592178770949721
