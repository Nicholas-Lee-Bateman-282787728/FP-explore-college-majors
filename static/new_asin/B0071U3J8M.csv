8508632,5,B0071U3J8M,"Jose Aldo leads an action packed card with surprisingly good fights. Nine out of the ten fights end up with a knockout, submission, or with at least on fighter winning at least one of three rounds in losing a decision. The only real marquee fight on here is the Aldo vs Mendes main event but as I said pretty much all the fights are entertaining or close. There's no behind the scenes footage on this dvd that usually comes with the other event dvds.",1338336000,,450,4.369047619047619
8508633,3,B0071U3J8M,"The first card of 2012 was a good start, but I expected more. Vitor Belfort vs Anthony Johnson was expected to be fireworks, but Johnson once again failed to make weight and it ruined the fight because most people knew that he wasn't going to have much in his gas tank when it came time to fight, so the much anticipated fight turned out to be much less exciting than most had hoped for. There were a lot of finishes in the event, including a couple amazing knockouts that will be remembered for a long time, so it is still a good event and a dvd that you should buy.",1335225600,,567,4.163636363636364
8508634,4,B0071U3J8M,"Four months after UFC 134 the UFC once again returns to Brazil with the first pay-per-view of the year.  In usual fashion every fight had a native from Brazil battle it out with someone of another country, with the exception of one fight, and the hometown crowd was among the most rowdy crowds in history.

The main event starts off with a lightweight battle between Edson Barboza and Terry Etim, both of whom are known for being quick strikers.  While the first round starts off even enough by the second round it's pretty evident that one fighter is getting the edge over the other on the score card in terms of effective strikes landed.  Come the third round it's do or die and it ends with one of the greatest knockouts in UFC history.  Your jaw may drop to the floor once you see the finish and you'll be hitting the replay again and again just to catch what may arguably be Knockout of the Year on the first main event card fight of the year.  Awesome way to set the bar high.

Erick Silva vs. Carlo Peter starts and then, in very short and abrupt fashion, ends.  It's unfortunate because there's not really much to be gained from watching this fight due to the short amount of time actually spent fighting before it ends in a disqualification.  While the finish was a blitz of fury, so to speak, the shots landed were illegal so it might be worth keeping an eye out just to witness the early frenzy.

Mike Massenzio has had a tough two runs in the UFC.  After having a successful debut he went on to his next two fights and left the UFC.  On his return to the promotion he lost once again before finally beating Steve Cantwell by decision.  So, it was imperative that he continue this spring of luck against his next opponent in Rousimar Palhares.  Now, for those who don't know who Palhares is, he's arguably the most scary Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu fighter in all of the UFC.  He's got the same mentality as Frank Mir, which is not so much to submit someone as take home a piece of their victim and put it in the their trophy room.  The fight itself is short and sweet with a quick and devastating ending.  It's a brilliant finish so keep your eyes open.

Any hardcore UFC fan who hears Vitor Belfort may think of a number of things first.  The Phenom entered the UFC as 19 year-old somebody with a reputation as a Jiu-Jitsu fighter but went on to display the most lethal hands ever and quickly became known for his absolutely brutal TKO and KO finishes.  He's a living legend having fought the best of the best, knocking many of them out stone cold, and is currently fighting in the middleweight division having first started in the heavyweight division so many years ago.  Up to this point his current run has only been stalled by a prominent front kick to the face by one Anderson Silva, and since blitzing Yoshihiro Akiyama Belfort is looking to get his rematch with the Spider.  Belfort's opponent, Anthony Johnson, is making his debut in the middleweight division after years of difficult weight cutting at the welterweight level.  He's a wrestler with extremely dangerous power in his hands and feet but looked to tire out in many of his fights due to the large amount of weight he would cut.  With a lot more than just reputation on the line both fighters came out guns blazing looking to end the other fast and brutally.  Once it was determined who was winning the standup the other attempted to take it the ground a few times but eventually that worked against the person.  If you're like me, the finish was not what I expected.  A fun fight and, on a side-note, this fight had one of the most raucous crowds going.  It gave me absolute goosebumps listening to the crowd's energy.

In the main event Jose Aldo looked to defend his title in his home country of Brazil in front of many of his country men.  Stepping up to the plate is highly accomplished wrestler Chad Mendes.  It's been long disputed where Aldo fits into the pound-for-pound listing, whether he's above GSP or right behind him, and I personally feel that the two are tied with much of the debate laying on whether or not GSP's next fight can showcase a much needed finish.  Aldo, in his last two title defenses, has gone to the judges both times.  So, while not the most exciting fights he's continuously shut down each challenger that's come his way.  Mendes looked to solve the puzzle that is Aldo by asserting his wrestling in his first shot at the title.  Coming in undefeated, training partner of Urijah Faber and Joseph Benavidez, Mendes looked to be a pretty exciting wrestler with a strong chance at dethroning the king at featherweight.  The fight has a short feeling out process before each fighter starts to implement his game plan, and it becomes evident rather quickly that the other just simply cannot keep up.  With seconds left in the first round we are treated to an absolutely devastating finish that leaves little doubt in anyone's mind who the victor is.  The post fight celebration is absolutely incredible and, in my mind, is one of the best moments of the entire night.

All around, a successful return to Brazil for the UFC.  While not as much star power as the last time this card delivers on a number of matches and finishes, with only one match on the main card being a poor showing.  Even the prelims were decent, with two out of the three ending by finish in the first round.  Definitely a card worth checking out.",1331596800,2,5422,4.507676560900716
