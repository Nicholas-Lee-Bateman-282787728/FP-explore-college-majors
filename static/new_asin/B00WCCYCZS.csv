7130306,5,B00WCCYCZS,"The following review relates to the Blu-ray version currently available in the UK:

This recording from the 2014 Salzburg Festival offers a production that translates the action to a modern luxury hotel of indeterminate date where licentious on-goings are not uncommon and one where this modern Don Giovanni finds a natural home base. The production by Sven-Eric Bechtolf is therefore not a traditional one but it is nevertheless, on its own terms, completely convincing.

The action throughout is kept taut by means of slick stagecraft and forward moving tempi so that the drama is convincingly real. The cast are very well chosen for being of realistic ages. The three female leads, Lenneke Ruiten as Donna Anna, Anett Frisch as Donna Elvira and Valentina Nafornita as Zerlina, are all individually attractive women and likely to draw Don Giovannis attention. Zerlina is particularly flighty and likely to cause the strongly delivered Masetto of Alessio Arduini future heartache which makes the pairing more believable in terms of their own relationship and Zerlinas response to Giovanni.

The Commendatore of Tomasz Konieczny offers a particularly strong voiced delivery of his role as well as being less aged than in some productions so the part has suitable and essential strength. The weaker character role of Don Ottavio is convincingly portrayed by Andrew Staples who is, as expected, no match for the stronger male roles of Giovanni, Leporello, the Commendatore or even Masetto.

The Leporello of Luca Pisaroni is a suitably strong concept, offering rather more humour than many but still keeping within role. Ildebrando DArcangelo as Giovanni seems perfectly cast in a role that enables his sensuous persona full scope. He offers a powerfully libertine performance underpinned by an effortless and strong bass voice and instinctive acting ability.

All these singers offer excellent musical performances and acting within their allotted roles and the whole opera is conducted at pace by Christoph Eschenbach supported by excellent playing from the VPO.

The recording is crisply detailed with accurate colour and sharp focussing as one would expect from a modern HD recording. The sound is well captured in Master Audio 5.1, also available in PCM Stereo, with no suggestion of artificial boosting or, thankfully, of voice microphones. All of these singers are well able to fill the Mozart House theatre where this was recorded and the complete effect is that of a natural audio experience.

The extra feature of this disc is the Behind the Scenes commentary which lasts for more than the 3 hours of the performance. It includes occasional mini interviews with the director and some production staff as well as footage from the wings and backstage not possible to see from the auditorium. This feature can be accessed at any time during playback and can be viewed as a screen within a screen or as full screen. By clicking on the feature from the main menu and using the fast forward button one can also skip through to parts that may be of particular interest. The quality of the recording matches the rest of the recording visually and the sound is available as surround or stereo. This feature will appeal to some more than others of course.

Overall this is a believable modern setting, not to be confused with Euro-trash. The concept does not jar with the essential drama of the opera and therefore should not offend those who naturally favour more traditional productions. The musical and acting credentials of the individual performers are beyond criticism and the technical aspects of the recording are of an equally high standard. The sub-titles in English offer a slightly altered phraseology which is a touch more idiomatic and up-to-date. Other languages are German, French, Italian and Spanish but these were not followed.

In summary this is offers a significantly successful modern addition to the choices currently available of Don Giovanni.",1435363200,11,3966,5.174726989079563

7130310,3,B00WCCYCZS,"This is the most recent addition to my expanding library of DVD/blu-ray versions of Don Giovanni discs. Modern performances began with the 2002 director Joseph Losey's arrangement (and rearrangement as a film version with auspices of the Paris Opera) with Ruggiera Raimondi as the very regal Don, mischievous John Macurdy as Leporello, Edda Moser as Elvira and so beautiful of face and voice Kiri te Kanawa as Anna. I confess I played and re played that album dozens and dozens of times over the years. It was a beautiful film of a beautiful opera and I still play it. In 2008 the Royal Opera house did a version with Simon Keenlyside as an intellectual Don with a robust jovial Kyle Ketelsen as Leporello, Marina Poplaskaya as a truly regal Anna and Joyce DiDonato as a very human Elvira. Excellent performances by all. My favorite disc of the newer crop is the 2014 version of the Royal Opera house with Mariusz Kwiecien as a truly sexy Don and Alex Esposito as the best Leporello of recent memory. The exellent conductor was Nicola Luisotti and a super production by Kasper Holton. (My first Don was George London at the Met; I  was 14. That was sixty some years ago.)
Needless to say I was excited to see this new production  conducted by Daniel Barenboim. I remember him fondly from the years he conducted the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and his discs of Wagner operas.
Well, this production has some good points and some not so good. The best thing in it is Anna Netrebko's Donna Anna. Not only is she ravishingly beautiful but her singing is ravishingly beautiful also. I've never heard the Act one ""Or sai chi l'onore"" sung so dramatically or beautifully. It's the grandest moment in the opera. Whenever Ms Netrebko took the stage she dominated it.
I thought Anna Prohaska about the best ""peasant girl"" Zerlina I can remember. She has just the right demeanor and voice for the part.
Bryn Terfel was badly miscast. He is a good singer; sometimes a great one. He is not a Leporello; he lacks an innate comic demeanor such as has Alex Esposito or Kyle Ketelsen. Peter Mattei is also an excellent singer but he is about as sexy a warm jello. I've seen him do other things well but he is no Don. The production at La Scala was a chaotic mess. A forgettable experience except for Ms. Netrebko.",1462147200,15,2294,4.620098039215686
7130311,3,B00WCCYCZS,"Here we go again. I suppose opera companies around the world are too broke to afford sets. Here we have yet another sparse production mixed with a screwy interpretation.

The singing is great but the sound seems unbalanced. May be, as some have mentioned, it's the tempo of the production? It often feels like a ""numbers piece"". Wait for this song to finish, pause, next...

I confess, I'm a traditionalist and do not care for most modernized productions. This isn't going on my favorites list.",1457395200,9,494,4.8

Thats why this DVD is a 5-star choice for me, a rating I don't often give.  Value for money.  At DGs pricing of barely $20 it is difficult to conceive of reasons not to buy this.

This production, from La Scalas opening night in 2011/12, has received a considerable amount of international press.  Praise for its all-star principal castespecially Mattei (Don Giovanni), Netrebko (Donna Anna) and Terfel (Leporello)has been near-universal, and rightly so.

There are really only two areas of legitimate criticism. The first is Robert Carsens interpretation, which features Donna Anna in the first scene as a willing partner of Don Giovanni: on Carsens take she concocts the rape story to cover herself. Its not easy to reconcile with the libretto, but not outrageous (and not the first time its been done) either. I had far more trouble with the ending, which Carsen turns on its head.  Online reviews ascribe any number of theories and views to all of this. Perhaps it was all meant to be some sort of commentary about Silvio Berlusconi, who was Prime Minister of Italy up until only a month before opening night (to wit, the Commendatores (nay, Wobbledatore's) statute appears from the Presidents box in the opera house). Who in the hell knows.  As a far more trivial comment, it was disappointing that Peter Mattei, despite being vocally and physically suited to the title role, was dressed up like a career civil servant who had just blown a meagre inheritance on a fancy suit.

The second is Daniel Barenboims tempi (slow). Frankly it didn't trouble me at all.  Old school.  It only mattered to the extent that I felt that on occasion singers were wanting to push the tempo more than the conductor was prepared to allow.",1449360000,25,1863,4.754658385093168
7130316,4,B00WCCYCZS,"It is a plain production. The director manages to use the voice as the ultimate element of the opera. The actors are well matched, but I miss the greater elements in the opera, like it was in the production in the Mozart year in Salzburg. You can't say anything bad about the craftsmanship of the actors. I miss something special in the opera, to say that it is a good opera. In the  years before you are enchanted with an antique stage set, like it is on the DVD of Don Pasquale. Anna Prohaska and Peter Mattei can't gain back the lost territory. Anna Netrebko sings with her powerful voice. The best aria is -Crudele? - Ah, no, Mio bene!... Non mi dire-. A character she sings over the years with a constant intensity. Her voice is not so clear and pure as it was on her first CD production. The duettino -La ci darem la mano- is the second best highlight beneath the area of Donna Anna in the second act.",1449360000,4,907,4.273255813953488

I do not believe that this is what Mozart intended.",1517356800,,345,4.532258064516129

8712870,3,B00WCCYCZS,"Contrary to the librettist's and the composer's intention, in this production (as in some others), Don Giovanni 'gets the girl', here Donna Anna. Why is this done, since one of the big jokes (if not the biggest) in this opera is that the womanizer does not get any girl. Based on the libretto, he does not get Donna Anna; Donna Elvira sees to it that he does not get Zerline; Masetto and his friends (vowing to kill DG) interrupt the Don wooing Donna Elvira's maid; The night of the big party where DG goes after Zerline once more, she is no longer interested, and screams for help; (that, by the way, is the night where, as he tells Leporello in the Champagne aria, there will be ten more entries in his 'conquest log''. There is none).  The woman he is expecting (after the Donna Anna debacle) at his mansion that night apparently never shows up; the only one he could bed (Donna Elvira) he is no longer interested in.
The librettist even gives us a hint lest we should miss the joke: after Donna Elvira has led Zerline away, DG exclaims frustrated something to the effect: does the devil have a hand in this?  Am I not going to get any girl?
Stagings like that are unfortunate, because they deprive the audience of a very good joke (maybe much more than  that)!",1502236800,,1264,4.439655172413793

8712873,3,B00WCCYCZS,"Sven-Eric Bechtolfs second Mozart/daPonte for Salzburg was Don Giovanni which premiered in 2014. There are some similarities with his Cos fan tutte. He uses a symmetrical unit set again and shows a fondness for creating symmetrical tableaux vivants but there the similarities pretty much end. I could find a consistent, believable set of humans in Cos but not so much in Don Giovanni. The problem is really the man himself. Bechtolf, in his notes, seems to be arguing that Don Giovanni can make no sense in an age of pervasive accessibility and exposure to all things sexual. Da Pontes Don requires a climate of sexual repression for his essence; to Bechtolf a kind of Dionysian force (he cites Kierkegaard), to make any sense as a human. I think I get that but then, I think, the challenge becomes to create a Don Giovanni who does make sense to a 21st century audience as, in their different ways, do Guth (Salzburg 2008) and Tcherniakov Aix en Provence 2010). Bechtolf seems to treat the character not so much as a human rather thanas a kind of energy focus who exists by igniting aspects of the other characters; whether thats lust or jealousy or hatred. He caps off this idea at the end by having Don Giovanni reappear during the final ensemble as a kind of mischievous presence still chasing anything in a skirt, even if its, perhaps, from another world. Its an idea that I could not really buy into.

Other aspects of the production are sometimes quite interesting, if sometimes also a bit puzzling. The setting appears to be an upmarket hotel in, maybe, the early 20th century. The visual clues as to time period are contradictory. So, there are lots of bedrooms and waiters, porters and maids in abundance. The Commendatore is clearly the proprietor or manager and Don Ottavio some favoured and quite senior underling. This took a bit of sorting out as they wear fancier versions of the porters uniforms and I don't associate characters of that status with uniforms unless military. A Germanic taste for uniforms in general?There are some interesting touches. The knife that kills the Commendatore is actually in Donna Annas hand though Don Giovanni is directing it. Several scenes are highly sexualised, even when Don Giovanni is not about. Donna Anna is all over Don Ottaviowhile she is describing the attack by Don Giovanni and Zerlina and Masetto both end up in their underwear during Vedrai carino. There are some interesting devil waiters around during the party scene (they reappear at the end), the handling of the whole bit with the statue is neat and the final scene is visually arresting. A lot of thought has clearly gone into details but Im not sure its enough to overcome a basic conceptual problem.

In some ways the singing and acting parallel this. Obviously at the core is Don Giovanni, here played by Ildebrando DArcangelo. Its a polarising casting choice. According to ones tastes I think he could come off as virile and dangerous or coarse toned and one dimensional. I lean to the latter. I just don't like his voice and his relentless rather loud, very dark toned singing. Its interesting that Luca Pisaroni, playing Leporello, manages a pretty good vocal impersonation of DArcangelo during the Donna Elvira seduction but theres no change at all in the tenor of the latters voice. All round actually I liked Pisaronis rather nerdiy and well sung Leporello. I wasn't much taken with Andrew Staples Don Ottavio either. There are places where he sings quite elegantly but generally I found him a bit thin toned and uninteresting. Thomas Koniecznys Commendatore and Alessio Arduinis Masetto are both pretty decent though.

Lenneke Ruiten sings Donna Anna and shes pretty good. Shes easy to listen to and makes a really good job of the coloratura in Crudele! Anett Fritsch is a very good and sympathetic Donna Elvira. She manages a suitably desperate and put upon air and her rather breathy soprano is interesting and not too plummy. She does a great job on Mi tradi. Zerlina probably shouldnt be the star of a Don Giovanni but Valentina Nafornita comes very close. She has a lovely voice and that indefinable quality, stage presence. She steals just about every scene shes in and, to ice the cake, shes drop dead gorgeous. One to watch. Im not sure the Wiener Philharmoniker need conducting in this music but Christoph Eschenbach does an efficient job with tempi on the brisk side and sympathetic support for the singers.

On Blu-ray, the picture and DTS-HD sound are excellent. Even the dark scenes, and there are a few have enough detail. Video direction, by Andreas Morelli, is fairly conventional though, as almost always, with more close ups than I care for. Id also question using cameraswell to the side of the theatre when the stage director is clearly trying to create a symmetrical effect. Theres a most unusual extra feature on the disk. There are actually two video tracks; the normal one and a back stage camera. One can watch either or watch the back stage in a window while the main feature is playing. I used the feature for a few minutes and I really don't see the point. I want to watch the opera not someone swigging their water bottle or getting their make up touched up. The booklet has a detailed track listing and Bechtolfs production notes. Otherwise there are no explanatory materials. Subtitle options are English, German, French, Spanish, Italian and Korean.

I cant imagine going back to this production very often. Id much rather watch the Guth or Tcherniakov productions referenced above or even the older, and endlessly fascinating Kuej (Salzburg 2006) production.",1489190400,,5622,4.864300626304802
