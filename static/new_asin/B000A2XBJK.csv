8073029,4,B000A2XBJK,"A wonderful box set of some of the greatest silent classics ever. Cheap price for these DVDs, these are old pieces of cinema and one must realize that while watching. The transfers are not masterpieces, but that does not mean, it is a bad product, because for the price and the reality of these four classic silents, it's called perfection in cinema making. One should only have to look at the titles given, Golem itself is worth the purchase.",1427673600,,443,4.620253164556962
8073030,4,B000A2XBJK,"Regarding the Golem, this IS the original with the original musical score which is magnificent (the ""restored (KINO) Golem is not recommended because they replaced the music! -- which should never have been allowed. The Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a good classic. The Thief of Bagdad is one of the best movies ever made, however in this case, the restored (KINO DVD) is recommended.",1421798400,3,381,4.787878787878788

8073033,3,B000A2XBJK,"First I would like to say that this set is region free, so anyone should not have any trouble, I hope.

THE HEAD - This movie was made in 1959 and was the predecessor of ""The Incredible Two-Headed Transplant"", 9171 and ""The Thing With Two Heads"" with Ray Milland.

A scientist professor Able, was dying so his assistant, doctor Umm (?) decided to take matters into his own hands and to do the chop-chop on his head and kept it in working order mechanically, but the professor wanted to die.

The mad Umm then switched heads with a deformed Irene and the woman Lilly who Umm loved, but things didn't go the way he wished. She shunned her new body and Umm and escapes, but is recaptured by the crazy doctor and taken back to the lab. Umm goes mad as his transplant brain is going out of control.

When things start going pear-shape the mad doctor goes off the rails and starts to burn the place down. When the police arrive he voluntarily dies under the moon, and Lilly/Irene goes off with a friend to live a normal life hopefully.

I EAT YOUR SKIN - Made in 1964 this movie is set in the negro world of magic rituals, voodoo, finger-licking good human meat and zombies. What more could anyone ask for.

A playboy and a few friends head for Voodoo Island of a once in a lifetime trip.

There is talk of a sacrifice when they arrive, and all the mystery between the locals and the white people. The typical story of the locals eyeing off the new comers as a source of suspicion, food, and the way to practice voodoo.

The doctor is into creating his own zombies, and the newly arrivals try to escape with the help of the two remaining survivors, but the witch-doctor has other ideas for them. After they put an end to the fun and games the witch-doctor isn't very happy with the party crashers and goes on the warpath, but some escape, and a terrible thing happens to the inhabitants of the island.

MASTER - This is a Japanese film of 1970. A reporter (Larry Standford) is to interview the mad scientist Suzuki, but he is given a serum unknownly. With another creature growing inside him, he starts to develop another head which makes him leave a trail of murders behind him.

When his other head is developed completely Larry turns into a hairy manster and returns to undo everything doctor Suzuki has strived for. Near the local volcano things come to a head and after a fight they split apart. A fight between good and evil ensures. The usual end transpires with a few words of warning from Larry's boss.

THE SCREAMING SKULL - There is a warning at the start of this movie where the producers guarantee the viewer free funeral services if they die of fright while they are watching ""The Screaming Skull"". I was wondering if anyone has taken them up on the offer, as a coffin has always been at the ready.

Filmed in 1958 this movie is about a man (Harry), his new wife (Jenny), his dead wife, a grown son (Nicky) and of course a skull that likes to scream at night.

It is about a man who trying to sent his new wife crazy for his own purposes, a son who wants to save the damsel in distress, and an ex-wife who wants revenge on her ex.

By the time help arrives Harry is indisposed, Nicky is back caring for his dead mother and Jenny goes off into the dawn with the vicar and his wife.

These movies are not bad for the era, but out dated for people who do not like old movies, so I would not recommend them to everybody for that fact. If you have time to spend watching them you may enjoy them, but don't expect to scared to death, or get horse from screaming. I gave this set 3 1/2 stars because they will not appeal to everyone.",1365638400,2,3634,4.315712187958884
8073034,1,B000A2XBJK,"The movies featured are fantastic,yes, but the actual quality of picture and sound is the worst I have EVER seen.
It almost seems like someone filmed a tv screen playing a really bad vhs tape. How bad?  Let me count the ways...
If you love silent movies like me, do yourself a big favor, perish the thought of buying this set and spend a bit extra to get the titles individually. KINO VIDEO, IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT or CRITERION COLLECTION are terrific at restoration of vintage treasures such as these.",1346198400,,499,4.670454545454546
8073035,5,B000A2XBJK,"The half-dozen DVDs in ST. CLAIR's ULTIMATE SILENT CLASSICS set feature early Oz films, plus Pickford, Chaney, Barrymore, Schreck, Lang and lots of swashbuckling Fairbanks! Many of these are indeed very highly regarded photoplays. Extras include posters, pics and vintage radio transcriptions.

None here have undergone restoration, and music tracks seem randomly chosen-- for example, in one film a cheery organ cavorts while Mary Pickford cries for her dead father.

8073036,3,B000A2XBJK,"This set contains 11 movies, including some of the great films of the silent era (Nosferatu, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, Metropolis), an okay collection of the 4 Wizard of Oz films from 1914, and 4 of the Mary Pickford ""little girl"" roles (Poor Little Rich Girl (1917), Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917), Pollyanna (1919), Little Annie Rooney (1925). The quality of the transfer is ""ehh"" and some of the music is downright annoying (mute the DVD and put other music on as background music!). If all one is looking for is an introduction to the silent era, this is an acceptable collection, although it would be much better to pick it up as a used copy in the $6 to $8 range; $20 is definitely too much. These DVDs do NOT show any of the films off at their best. Much better versions of Nosferatu and Jekyll/Hyde are available at reasonable costs -- certainly the newly almost-complete, restored Metropolis released in 2010 is what a film buff would want to see. The other films, even the Mary Pickford ones, are quite hard to get copies of at all, so even though the versions here are not especially good, it is certainly better than no access to them at all. Slowly (too slowly!)restored versions of the Pickford films are being released, but in the meantime these offer a watchable introduction to some of her more popular movies. Pollyanna is especially interesting as it is clear where Disney pulled a lot of their ideas for the much later version with Haley Mills.",1235347200,18,1464,4.6130268199233715
