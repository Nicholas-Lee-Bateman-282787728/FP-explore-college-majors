3467119,1,B001ASQ9O2,The movie was skipping in spots. I purchased it for my 16 year old jockey player and it was not of good quality.,1389139200,,112,3.9130434782608696
3467120,5,B001ASQ9O2,I loved this dvd but I'm not sure if the autograph on the front cover is actually Sid's or not.,1359849600,,95,3.8
3467121,4,B001ASQ9O2,Great DVD but mine was scratched so that was a bummer. I had to skip scenes because it was too scratchy to enjoy. But I love me some Sidney Crosby so I might have to get another copy,1328745600,,182,3.8157894736842106
3467122,5,B001ASQ9O2,"There are many reasons why I love Sidney Crosby, all of which are displayed in this dvd. We get to know not only who Sid is personally, but we get Sid's interactions with teammates, game footage mic'ed up, doing charity events, accepting the Dapper Dan award, and playing in the Stanley Cup final to name a few. The special features are amazing, and include the Winter Classic from 2008. Spoiler: the last lines Sid utters is about not being a Stanley Cup winner, but he did win the Cup the very next year. Bottom line: Sid is an amazing player but also someone you can really look up to and respect. We need a sequel because I'm totally hooked!",1308009600,,645,4.428571428571429
3467123,5,B001ASQ9O2,"This is an awesome movie. All Sid fans out there need to see this if you haven't already. It's good because it's not completely about Sid (unlike Ovechkins which is all about him)it's about the team too. Definitely a must see!!!!

  GO PENS!!!!! #87",1296000000,,249,4.613636363636363

Could not be more satisfied.",1279843200,,134,4.625
3467125,5,B001ASQ9O2,"I am a huge Pittsburgh Penguins fan, and subsequently, I am a huge Sidney Crosby fan!  I love this DVD.  The extras are really wonderful, as well.  I enjoy watching the Winter Classic as I was not able to watch it when it was originally played.  Any Pittsburgh Penguins fan would love this DVD.  Let's GO PENS!",1279497600,,310,4.368421052631579
3467126,5,B001ASQ9O2,"Awesome, great insight into his career and how he is off the ice, great segment with team mates and singing 'slow motion'. Hope they do another one now because he has won a stanley cup and gold at the olympics!",1278288000,,210,4.275
3467127,5,B001ASQ9O2,This was a Mother's Day surprise -- and it was a huge hit!  The DVD is packed full of segments that any fan will find interesting!,1275177600,,130,4.0
3467128,5,B001ASQ9O2,I bought this DVD for my daughter.  She is a huge Pens and Sidney Crosby fan. She absolutely loved it!,1249689600,,102,4.1
3467131,5,B001ASQ9O2,"This is a great DVD highlighting the Pens '07-'08 season. What I especially liked about this DVD was the bonus material. In the bonus material it shows when Pitt got the #1 choice in the draft, and when Crosby got his ""C."" And you also get to hear Sid's perspective about when he felt he was ready to wear the ""C."" Also there's some great personal stories about the little things Sid does for the community and people such as a make-a-wish girl from Montreal. There's a section on how Sid is the face of the league but not only because of his skills but also because of his willingness to talk to the press, and just how he carries himself in general. And of course the Winter Classic game was just an amazing game in itself and it's nice to have the full game on this DVD.",1247875200,,773,4.22972972972973
3467132,5,B001ASQ9O2,This is a great DVD with some good behind the scenes footage (my favorite is when they're playing video games on the plane) and short interviews with Sidney's teammates and various reporters. If you like Sidney Crosby you won't be disappointed. Plus it has the whole 2008 Winter Classics game!,1247529600,,293,4.88
3467133,1,B001ASQ9O2,"This movie was not that suspenseful or climactic, pretty piss poor job.  not very happy, and in light of this new movie I am less of a Crosby fan.

Dragged on for WAYY too long, could have been under and hour to say all they wanted to.",1234396800,,235,3.978723404255319
3467134,5,B001ASQ9O2,"This is an amazing video.  If you are not a hockey fane before watching this video, you will be afterwards.  This video is well directed and follows Sid through his trials an tibulations on and off the ice.  Enjoy!",1232323200,,214,4.435897435897436
3467135,5,B001ASQ9O2,"""Sidney Crosby: On The Ice and Beyond"" is a documentary that covers a bit of Sid's life but mainly focuses on the Pittsburgh Penguins' run to the Stanley Cup Final in 2008. It is an extremely well-shot documentary and as a filmmaker myself, I can only say that I wish I had been a part of its production! Excellent hockey footage and a seamless storyline are integrated into this film about a kid that changed a city and is really the face of the NHL. With this film, you get a behind the scenes look at what it really means to be an all-star NHL'er and I'd recommend it to any hockey fanatic out there!",1225238400,,603,4.252173913043478
3467136,4,B001ASQ9O2,"The DVD is a good story on Crosby's 2007-2008 season (with a little build-up on the Penguins, then on Crosby himself).  The biography itself is good.  There isn't much as far as highlights go.  This is definitely more of a biography of Crosby than it is a highlight reel.  The feature runs about 80 minutes.

My complaints are with the production.  The DVD is shown in widescreen format, but it's not a true widescreen for those with widescreen TVs, it's like a matted picture.  Crosby's voice having the echo effect did not help present it well, but it wasn't too annoying after a few times of hearing it.

The other complaint goes to marketing.  The NHL Winter Classic game is included as an extra.  A game that DESERVED it's own DVD, and will surely help sales of this DVD is just an extra on this DVD.  It's (true) widescreen format, so it's a great picture of the game and worth the price for this extra alone.

I haven't gotten to see any of the extras which include: Captian Crosby, Crosby the Communicator, The Draft Lottery, Face of the League, Behind the Scenes - Gatorade Commercial Shoot, Personal Stories, Sid and the Kids, Sid's Super Skills, and the already mentioned 2008 Winter Classic game in it's entirity.",1223337600,,1225,4.62037037037037
8279576,5,B001ASQ9O2,"This was for my son, who is a huge hockey fan.  He says ""I love it"".  Crosby is a Center and Captain for the Pittsburgh Penguins.  The DVD is a biography.  Any hockey fan should check it out.",1507334400,,191,3.9473684210526314
8279577,5,B001ASQ9O2,"I LOVE this DVD!!! I had seen it on youtube, but it's so much better on DVD! I'm a huge Sidney fan, and I love the day in the life approach to this video, and that Sidney does the dialog. Great! Fantastic!",1490313600,,205,3.9047619047619047
8279578,2,B001ASQ9O2,The movie was interesting but the music was loud and annoying and made it almost impossible to hear the spoken word.,1488758400,,116,4.571428571428571
