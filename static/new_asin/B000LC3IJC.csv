8160722,2,B000LC3IJC,"JUDGMENT DAY 2007 looks like a pretty strong card on paper.  There is no reason this PPV isn't better than it turned out to be.  Most poor WWE PPVs are doomed from the start, but this one had a chance at greatness.  Then again, the event is called JUDGMENT DAY.  How fitting...

1) Carlito v. Ric Flair
---They had a decent match at UNFORGIVEN 2005, but I didn't expect as much this time around.  This grudge match should've happened weeks before this very night; the angle was your typical ""tag team breakup"" routine.  This was basically Flair getting his butt handed to him for an unbelievable amount of time, and frankly I just stopped caring long before it was over.  Just skip it.
""5.0 / 10""
_____________________________________________

2) 3-on-1 Handicap Match - ECW World Title
Shane McMahon, Umaga, & Vince McMahon (champion)
v. Bobby Lashley
---I thought their BACKLASH showdown was okay.  Why WWE booked a copycat rematch is beyond me.  Why it lasted only 2 minutes is even more puzzling.  Seriously, who thinks these little ""twists"" are worth PPV money?  Like most have said, on TV this might've been an acceptable presentation.  Plus, I admit that the whole match was pretty exciting while it lasted.  But c'mon, even on DVD, this feels like a slap to the face.
""4.0 / 10""
_____________________________________________

3) CM Punk v. Elijah Burke
---I'm gonna start calling these kinds of matches ""dark horses.""  Dark Horses are what I will describe as a match that is pointless, but still a remarkable wrestling presentation.  It's strange seeing an ECW singles match take place after the show's own title match!  Thankfully, this one is very worthy of a PPV.  Take a ROH veteran like Punk and mix him with an young commodity like Burke, and you've got some good stuff.  Even though the whole match took place because of an underdeveloped ""ECW's New Breed"" angle, I was entertained for the 17 minutes these two men competed.  It's nice to see these straight-up matches once in a while.
""7.0 / 10""
_____________________________________________

4) Randy Orton v. Shawn Michaels
---Their last PPV one-on-one faceoff was excellent.  Plus, we were in Orton's hometown.  I knew of HBK's injuries going in, but man, I didn't expect this ridiculous scenario.  Basically, HBK was ""attacked"" backstage, yet in his ""concussive state"", came out to wrestle Orton anyway.  Orton dominated most of the match, with HBK getting little offense in.  WWE really thought we would cast our sympathy votes, but even a hardcore fan like me didn't buy it.  I admit the storyline was effectively used, but couldn't HBK have like found a replacement who admired him, or something?  Never mind, I'll move on.
""5.0 / 10""
_____________________________________________

5) World Tag Team Championships
The Hardys (champions) v. Lance Cade & Trevor Murdoch
---This was another rematch from the BACKLASH PPV, but there's a reason that this one got included on the Hardys' ""Twist of Fate"" DVD.  Not only is this the best match from these two teams, it's one of the best of the year.  Their other PPV encounters were solid outings that never reached their full potential.  But this JUDGMENT DAY showdown is exciting and crisp from start to finish.  Cade & Murdoch should never have split, and The Hardys were very good for the tag division when WWE seemed to have forgotten about.  I think I'll go back and watch this one again, now.
""8.0 / 10""
_____________________________________________

6) World Heavyweight Championship
Edge (champion) v. Batista
---Even with the rushed booking, Edge has always been great, and Batista showed massive improvement working with Undertaker.  But there was clearly emergency booking written all over this one.  Thankfully, the match turned out better than I expected.  Edge was in control for most of the match, and for some reason, it worked pretty well.  Most reviewers have already said it, but Dave Batista really found his groove again wrestling Undertaker in Detroit.  This title bout isn't a great match, because it's a little too one-sided and shorter than a championship match should be.  It's entertaining, but these two didn't reach their peak until VENGEANCE.
""6.5 / 10""
_____________________________________________

7) Two-Out-of-Three Falls
United States Championship
M.V.P. v. Chris Benoit (champion)
---Very surprising in many ways.  Obviously, this match taking place after SMACKDOWN's main event is a huge compliment.  Montel Vontavious Porter winning after two falls was equally shocking, as Benoit came out on top more often when these two competed.  But the most unfortunate surprise is how average this showing from these two men.  I can't put my finger on it, but this match was rarely exciting, and was rarely slow in a good way.  When these two men mat-wrestled in previous matches, there was a great chemistry between them.  And when they picked up the pace in those earlier matches, it was great seeing them use a variety of suplexes, holds, counters, and near-falls.  But sadly, Porter's 11-month reign as U.S. champion began on a rough note.
""6.5 / 10""
_____________________________________________

8) WWE Championship
The Great Khali v. John Cena (champion)
---No, this is not a great match.  And no, it's not even very good by any other standard I can come up.  But, this main event was not terrible.  Even with Khali's limited abilities, there was a neat Andre/Hogan atmosphere.  The crowd made this match infinitely better than it probably was.  Cena barely got any offense in, and won after finally getting in a few signature moves.  However, even though I didn't exactly like this contest, I have to admit that it makes sense.  If you've seen Khali face Triple H at SUMMERSLAM 2008, then you might understand how sometimes when two wrestlers have to rely on a logical story rather than an exciting one.  Tell me, how else could Cena have possibly beaten The Great Khali other than what transpired on this PPV?  I won't watch this match again, but I admit that I can't come up with a better answer.
""5.5 / 10""
_____________________________________________

OVERALL
---This PPV had a lot of potential.  There was no way it was going to be a perfect PPV with the mix of injuries and rushed storylines.  But most  matches failed worse than any paying fan would've predicted.  I mean, a few bad matches on this PPV never interested you to begin with, but these shockers still make my head spin.

JUDGMENT DAY 2007 was not a disaster waiting to happen.  The WWE talent still could've delivered a worthy event, and just dropped the ball big time.  And it hurts deeper than most subpar presentations.",1225929600,,6646,4.990892531876138
8160723,2,B000LC3IJC,"if you thought Judgment Day 2007 was good, you have problems. Compared to other Judgment Day PPVs, this is offensive.

Ric Flair vs. Carlito

2/5

ECW Title Match
3 on 1 Handicap Match
Mr. McMahon, Umaga, & Shane McMahon vs. Bobby Lashley
Fast paced, and i mean REALLY fast paced. The match is under a minute long and a waste of space for the PPV card. Lashley spears Shane to get the pin but Vince says he has to pin him to win the title. It shows what garbage the new ECW has become.
1/5

CM Punk vs. Elijah Burke
I expected more and sadly this match was dull. If Paul E was running ECW, these two would have had an amazing match. Basically its all submission and punches. Punk wins after hitting the GTS
2.5/5

Randy Orton vs. Shawn Micheals
Not a match at all. Orton attacked HBK in a promo and HBK has a ""concussion"". HBK comes out and Orton beats him up and HBK is carried away. Would have been the best match of the night but no.

WWE Tag Team Title Match
Cade & Murdoch vs. Hardyz
GOD! How many times does this have to continue? Murdoch and Cade can't wrestle to save their lives. Nothing special in this match.

Edge vs. Batista
I was glad Edge was a champion again. First he stripped the title from a talentless man (John Cena) and he does it again but to a talented man (Undertaker). Nothing special here. Edge wins after a sneak pin.

MVP vs. Chris Benoit
This rivalry was already stale to the point I didn't care who won. MVP wins with a 2-1.
2.5/5

WWE Title Match
John Cena vs. The Great Khali
WWE hyped this like a dream match when the truth is, both of these two are god-awful in the ring. Completely horrible. Cena wins with the STFU on Khali which was a dumb finish.

Overall Grade = 1.5/5

If you really want this PPV, get another Judgment Day ppv (1998-2004) and save yourself from this garbage event. The wrong people are being pushed in WWE which is why WWE is garbage right now. This is probably THE worst ppv of all time.",1194825600,2,2161,4.248780487804878
8160724,2,B000LC3IJC,"Overall, this PPV came off like a 3 hour edition of RAW or SmackDown where most the major matches were either turned into angles (HBK/Orton & ECW Title match) or were just watchable (Cena/Khali & Edge/Batista).  This event looked good on paper but didn't live up to the hype whatsoever.

Ric Flair vs. Carlito - This opener did it's job in getting the crowd crazy as St. Louis usually always goes crazy for Ric Flair.  Carlito mostly did a mat-based style along with working on Flair's arm throughout of the match.  This was a good opener.

ECW Champion Mr. McMahon, Shane McMahon, Umaga vs. Bobby Lashley - I didn't know Goldberg was black?  Seriously, this match was a carbon copy of an old Goldberg match from WCW.  Lashley ran though Shane & Umaga in around a minute while Vince kept avoiding Lashley.  And Vince kept the title since he wasn't the one who was defeated.  They wasted so much on television for weeks for this match & this was the result?  Save this crap for RAW or ECW, not for a show people pay around $40 for.

C.M. Punk vs. Elijah Burke - This match was very similar to the opening match in that it went around the same amount of time &  Elijah worked on an injured body part thoughout various times of the match which in this case, it's Punk's heavily taped ribs.  The match itself was slow at times to the point where the crowd was chanting for ""J.B.L."" at one moment.  It was a good undercard match with nothing really noteworthy except for Punk perfectly selling his ribs throughout the bout.

Shawn Michaels vs. Randy Orton - Randy Orton came back to his hometown in another ""match"" that turned into a segment that should have been saved for RAW instead of a PAY-per-view.  Earlier in the night, Orton attacked HBK during an interview adding to the concussion he got from Khali two weeks earlier.  This was just Orton attacking HBK's head for around 5 minutes with a DDT & constant stomps to the head with HBK's only offense being his elbow drop from the top before his body gave out on him.  The match got stopped with HBK taking an RKO afterwards.  Just like the ECW title match, this should have been saved for RAW instead of a PPV because people don't pay to see glorified squash matches.

World Tag Team Champions The Hardys vs. Lance Cade & Trevor Murdock - A rematch from Backlash with J.B.L. & Michael Cole calling the match for some reason (since Matt's the only one on SmackDown).  This tag match & storyline itself was very similar ot the Eddie Guerrero/Batista one from back in 2005 where the heels were trying to play by the rules & not cheat.  It was a good tag team match but to me, was a step down from their Backlash match the previous month.  Besides seeing Trevor Murdock pull off the Canadian Destroyer, there really wasn't anything memorable here eventhough it was a solid contest.  This was the match of the night for me.

World Champion Edge vs. Batista - The match went around 10 mins. and it was a watchable match.  It came off to me as Batista doing exactly what he was doing at the Royal Rumble, just looking to get his spots while doing a poor job (compared to Flair & Punk earlier in the night) of selling his injury.  Edge as usual did work hard here but he's not Triple H & he's not Undertaker so we can't expect him to pull out that type of performance from Batista.  Again, the match is watchable but in no ways worth of being a ""World Championship"" match.

2 out of 3 Falls Match: United States Champion Chris Benoit vs. MVP - This match was my least favorite out of their 4 match series but their worst match together is still better than most of the card here.  Benoit sold his leg better than anyone else sold their injuries in the night with MVP targeting it thoughout the match.  It was a shock that MVP beat Benoit two straight CLEAN falls but Benoit did his job in this fued & elevate MVP & give him more credibilty as a performer.

WWE Champion John Cena vs. Great Khali - Cena was put into a no win situation here by trying to have an entertaining match with a wrestler who not even a man who nobody, not even veterans like Undertaker or Kane, can make look good...to the point where his match with Undertaker was taken off SummerSlam so it could be heavily edited to be watchable on SmackDown.  Cena was a spotmonkey non-stop by selling & falling to make Khali look like a monster while Khali did his usual punch/kick/repeat offense.  Cena again was put into a no-win situation & made the best of it.  The story here was for Cena to beat an unstoppable monster & the match served that purpose (ala Hogan vs. Bundy/Andre/Earthquake back in the 80's).  Bad match but again, it was a no-win situation & Cena did win again but he was the lesser of two evils in this situation.

DVD extras include a post-match interview with Randy Orton, MVP celebrating in Teddy Long's office, and the whole story behind the CM Punk/Elijah Burke fued.

The undercard here stole the show but there wasn't much of a show to steal here & this is one event that is passable and I only recommend this for a rental at best.",1184198400,4,5068,4.4155005382131325
8160725,2,B000LC3IJC,"1. Carlito vs Ric Flair *** 1/4 - Their best encounter yet. Very hot opener and the crowd was into it. Carlito did a great job in there.

1. Carlito vs. Rick Flair- I thought this was an okay match to start off the show. I was expecting this match to be a little better conxsidering carlito had just turned heeel again and I was expecting a little bit of a better performance out of him. This match was really slow with Carlito working on flairs arm a lot. Flair was able to fight back and get the win but this one was to slow for me and not enough action for a carlito match. Winner Carlito. Match Rating 5.5/10.
2. Vince McMahon and Shane McMahon and Umaga vs. Bobby Lasley for the ECW World Title- So we move on from a disappointing match to a match that sucked even worse. I was expecting a decent match but this was worse than backlash. The entrances were longer than the match itself. Also the ending was pointless because even though Lashley won the match McMahon said Lashley had to pin him so the match meant nothing. Skip this crap ECW has turned god awful. Winner Bobby lashley. Match Rating 1.5/10.
3. CM Punk vs. Elige Burke- So we finally get a match that is decent and go figure its an ECW match. These two had been fighting and feuding for a while. This was just a solid match with some hard hitting wrestling. Good match. Winner CM Punk. Match Rating 7/10.
4. Randy Orton vs. Shawn Michales- Here we go again. Another crap match. The thing is this one could have been good but Shawn Michales was hurt. So instead of taking this match off the card and putting on a smackdown tag match we leave this on the card and of course it sucks. This match was like 4 minutes long but there was no action at all. I was happy to see orton get the win in this hometown but another bad decision to book this match when Shawn was hurt. Winner Randy Orton. Match Rating 2/10.
5. The Hardy Boyz vs. Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch for the world tag team titles- This was a good match. In fact in my opinion this was the match of the night. I really liked the way this was set up. The card was doing bad so far and these guys steeped there game up. I think about a 15 minute match which was pleanty of time for these guys. Lots of high flying moves by the hardys which made this match fast pace. There were tons of near falls in this match including a spinebuster that I thought the hardys had lost there titles. Still a great match. Winner and still World Tag team champs the hardy boyz. Match Rating 8/10.
6. Edge vs. Batistia for the WHT- This match I was looking forward to considering this was coming off edges hot title win and just a lot of hype behind it. Unfortunately this did not live up to the hype. One reason is because this match was only given 9 minutes. That is smackdowns title match only 9 minutes. This was worked on mostly batistias leg. Batistia fought back hit a spine buster but out of know were Edge rolled him up for the win which was a huge shock. Winner and still WHC Edge. Match Rating 5.5/10.
7. Chris Beniot vs. MVP for the US title- This was another match that I was looking forward to this one was accualty not that bad. They had so many great matches coming into this one so I was expecting a match of the year did not get that at all but this was still not that bad of a match. MVP controlled this whole match which was the main reason it was hard to watch at times. MVP won the first and second fall which was why I did not like this match as much cause it was not competitive. Still a good match though. Winner and new US Champ MVP. Match Rating 7.5/10.
8. John Cena vs. The Great Kalih for the WWE title- This was the third main event title match that sucked. That's right I do not know why this was the main event or why Kalhi was in the main event. There were so many things wrong whit this match including that the match was only 8 minutes long. Kalhi controlled this whole match except for the very end Cena hit the steps in Kalhis knee and than brought him in and Kalhi tapped. This was a horrible ending considering cena never even affected Kalhi and Cena pulls out another BS win. Lokk I do not like Kalhi but I am sick of Cena winning every time. This ending sucked and so did the ppv. Winner and still WWE champ John Cena. Match Rating 5/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give Judgment day 2007 a grade of 42/80 which means this is a awful ppv. This is the first time in a long time that I have ever gave out that grade but when all of your main titles combine for a total of 20 minutes that is sad and just a poor booked event. Try and avoid to get this. If you can tell me if my review was helpful or not I would appreciate that. Thanks for your time.",1180483200,,4631,4.178970917225951

I don't think Carlito has ever beaten Flair in the past and he doesn't win here either. Carlito goes for the back stabber, Flair holds on to the ropes to avoid it. He then works on Carlito's legs and slaps on the figure four for the win. 7 out of 10

  C.M Punk vs Elijah Burke: this one was so good that it should've been for a belt! It was certainly way way better than the ECW match that was for a belt! There's a lot of reversals and risk taking and it's just a fun match to watch. It's even better than the disapoining Beniot vs MVP match. What you'd expect from that you get here really. C.M Punk eventually gets a hard fought win with his knee to the face move. 8 out of 10

  Murdock and Cade vs The Hardys (Tag Team Titles): The 2 teams once again have a solid tag team match that could've gone either way. Cade and Murdock are still obviously playing their little game about respecting the Hardys. The Hardys get the win with the Swanton Bomb on Cade eventually. Cade and Murdock play face again with a handshake but they'll obviously turn on them eventually.
7 1/2 out of 10

  Randy Orton vs HBK: There's not much of a match since Orton layed out HBK before the match. So HBK plays it like he's injured bad and Orton basically beats the crap out of him until the ref stops the match. I'm sure it's just HBK putting over Orton just like he put over the Khali so Cena can now go beat the guy who kicked HBK's ass. Anyway when HBK makes it to his feet after the match, Orton hits an RKO. HBK's hot wife who's probably 20 yrs younger than him..lol then hits the ring crying acting like Orton killed him.

  Batista vs Edge (World title): This matche ended quicker than I expected so I missed it up to the end. Batista walks in with an injured leg. Edge uses that to his advantage and wins with a roll-up.

  MVP vs Chris Beniot 2 out of 3 falls (U.S title): this one is pretty disapointing. Beniot is made to make MVP look way way too good here. MVP basically reverses everything Beniot does and just makes him look so weak. Which pisses me off since I'm a big Beniot fan. Of course Beniot is the only one to lose a belt at the ppv when stupid Cena's reighn goes on and on and on... Anyway it's supposed to be that Beniot wasn't 100% with an injured knee. So Beniot knee goes out from under him and MVP his leg swinging neck breaker to win the first fall. Beniot goes for the 2nd Fall with the crossface but MVP elbows his way out of it. When Bneiot goes for the sharpshooter, stupid MVP wrestles his way out of that too with some elbows to the knee. He then rolls up Beniot for the win and hopefully will just lose it right back! 7 1/2 out of 10

  The Great Khali vs Cena: This match contains a hell of a lot less wrestling than any other match on the card. It's just yet another match to make Cena look strong when he's over-pushed as it is. HBK should've gotten another shot and won the match but no Cena gets yet another match that was obvious from the start just so he could be the first to make Khali submit or be the first to pin him. As soon as Cena hurts Khalis leg and gets him on the ground...the match is over basically. He then slaps on the STFU for the win eventhough Khali's legs were under the ropes the entire time. It was still decent at least figuring Khali was in there and there's not much he can do but...stand there and look tall and strong. 6 1/2 out of 10",1179705600,,3754,4.136176066024759
