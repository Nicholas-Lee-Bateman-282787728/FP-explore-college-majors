Great source of information as to places you never knew existed. Comments and tips are useful.",1363737600,2,129,5.190476190476191
8408528,5,B003XU900K,"I studied French for six years, but have not yet been to France. My granddaughters, who have a French Canadian father, have been to France several times. This blu-ray, DVD and digital copy set looks at four regions: Burgundy and Loire, Champagne, Bordeaux and Dordogne, Carcassonne and the Pyranees. The French are gourmets and will take long trips to visit fine dining places.
The photography on the blu-ray is outstanding. I am waiting for Rudy Maxa's set on Greece and Spain.",1362614400,,478,4.91358024691358
8408529,2,B003XU900K,"The biggest disappointment was that it is sold as a two disc set with one disc a blu-ray and the other being the same but in DVD...I guess I'm at fault for not noticing the details but the publishers should more clearly identify this is not a two disc blu-ray!!  This is the main reason I ranked it only a 2 star.  Although the quality of blu-ray disc is great, the episodes certainly do not compare with the series ""Magnifica Italia"".  There's too much time spent on frivolous details in each short 25 minute episode vs. seeing more of the regions landscapes and significant natural and cultural features.  It's the first time I have seen a travelogue with Rudi Maxa and find him uninspiring (at least Rick Steves is a better host).  They really should find someone with a personality like Ian Stewart (""Earth Biography"" and ""How the Earth Changed History"") who shows incredible enthusiasm and excitement and draws you right into his work.  All in all, it's so-so but I'm hesitant to buy any more in this series as I don't see it as good value for the cost + shipping.",1344211200,3,1069,4.541666666666667
8408530,2,B003XU900K,"excellent program, but cannot play blue ray version, both the Greece and this France dvd.  My blue ray samsung player is four years old, so if you have one of the newer players, then BUY!",1339113600,,187,4.3428571428571425
8408531,5,B003XU900K,Superb photography!  Rudy Maxa's travel videos touch upon various highlights of the places covered.  He does not travel cheap and stays in quality hotels.  These videos are a great enticement to make you want to visit the various places.  This video should definitely be on the list to see by anyone planning a trip to France.  Great for the armchair traveler.,1296518400,8,360,4.836065573770492
