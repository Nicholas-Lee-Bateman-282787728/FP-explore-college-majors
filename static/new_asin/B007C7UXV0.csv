5076873,5,B007C7UXV0,"The Seminar gives the proof about the lie of the Evolution Theory.  I have studied different opinions from creationist and evolutionist finding that the Theory of Evolution is exactly what it states.  A theory.  I have found that it is not based on any scientific criteria at all.  Evolutionist seem to proclaim that the Evolution Theory is scientifically based, but I have personal found through my studies, that it requires more faith to believe evolution than creation.  I urge everyone to order this set.  A nice thing is that it also comes with a CD with the whole seminar that can be downloaded on an MP3 player.",1348963200,12,618,4.728971962616822

5076881,5,B007C7UXV0,"These are a great buy for anyone. Wonderful. Puts into perspective information explaining the Bible, dinosaurs, ice age and flood together. Spread them around.

5076884,5,B007C7UXV0,"Excellent series. The more I compare the evolution theory and creation theory, I think that, with all the evidence gathered, that creation is completely accurate. Also, Dr. Hovind has a great sense of humor.",1436918400,,207,5.117647058823529
5076885,5,B007C7UXV0,Kent Hovind was the man that solidified my belief in the bible. I cannot thank him enough. The age of the earth was the thorn in my side. No one  ever explained the bible with such scientific knowledge.,1436832000,3,202,4.315789473684211
5076886,5,B007C7UXV0,"This is a must-have for the dedicated Biblical Creationist who also understands that science and Christianity are NOT at odds with each other.  The heavens declare the glory of the Lord and also aligns marvelously with the physical attributes that we see with the Universe.  Despite his other controversial situations, Kent Hovind presents a plethora of Creationist topics in clear and well--footnoted, well-researched presentations.  The educated, science-background engineer, physicist, botanist, mathematician, micro-biologist, astronomer, etc., has nothing to fear with God's Word and the Universe we observe and explore and research.",1436054400,5,638,6.066666666666666

5076891,5,B007C7UXV0,"Kent Hovind is the most dangerous man to atheism. My opinion of this is simple, Kent Hovind explains why Evolution is a fantasy and completely fabricated to destroy Christian faith and the general idea of creation. If you're soul searching where you came from, this collection of Kent's seminars might save you to Christ. It did for me.

Earlier in my life, I had God removed from my soul. I had doubts. And I contribute the theory of evolution to me losing my faith. Later in life, I was desperate to find the truth to why Im here, what should I be doing? A friend of mine a few years ago, told me about this man named Dr. Kent Hovind who did creation seminars. I didn't even know what creation was. To me, it sounded like a waste of time. He told me his story. Dr. Kent Hovind was a science teacher in Florida for 15 years and eventually became a preacher. For 15 years he taught general science, but he started to have an awakening. But he learned he had a higher calling and wanted to get a message out to the kids. He got fed up with the lies the theory of Evolution used to support aspects of the theory. The word of Evolution is a complicated word, but in a nutshell, if you go back far enough, it says you all came from a rock. Do you see how that could be damaging to a faith? But what if you also knew that they used lies to get the point across? Trust me on this one, they have used lies in the text books to support the theory of evolution.

From the bottom of my heart, and I mean this with every breath I take, Kent Hovind, to me, is a modern day disciple and will show you what I was shown when I watched his word and the truth come into my heart. Kent Hovind wants one thing in this life, he wants people to be saved and wants to show you the LIES that are still in the text books today. And he wants the lies removed from the text books. I recommend getting these discs and sharing them with friends who need saved. Or anyone in your life who is lost in life. God bless everyone.",1425600000,5,1996,4.089285714285714

5076893,1,B007C7UXV0,"It's amazing people believe this stuff.  Won't trust the people who actually have scientific degrees who present strong evidence against this, but believe this, which isn't even backed up well at all, from a guy who is not a scientist.",1422489600,,235,4.875

5076896,5,B007C7UXV0,If you are a skeptic about the claims of creation or even evolution this would something for you to consider. Of course you must be an honest skeptic and go where the evidence leads you. That may be uncomfortable but I am sure you don't want to believe a lie. All of Hovinds claims are documented so that you can check them out for your selves.,1417305600,3,344,4.2272727272727275

5076899,3,B007C7UXV0,"I was a bit surprised to see the set come in loose sleeves instead of a box. There was no printing on the dvds or copyright info, so I'm wondering if they're copies that are being made and then sold. My husband checked out one of them, and it seems to be working correctly, so that's good.",1388016000,,289,4.087719298245614
5076900,4,B007C7UXV0,"You will see that it really takes more ""faith"" to believe in evolution than creationism. Kent had a lot of good points to consider, but I can see that someone in the mode of searching for truth may be put off by his negative attitude toward those he disagrees with. Other than that, it is worth taking the time to explore his points that may be life changing.",1387670400,10,359,4.294117647058823
5076901,2,B007C7UXV0,"If the disks would play, I would rate the seminar itself 5 stars, but when our ladies' Bible study group got into the third of the disks, it locked up and would not play, fast forward, or do anything. After that occurred, I went through the remaining disks and found that three more of them would not play properly. Thus the rating is not regarding the content which was very interesting up until the series disks would not playback for our group, but has to do with the poor quality of the DVDs themselves.",1383609600,4,507,4.404255319148936
5076902,5,B007C7UXV0,"If you need grounds for believing the Bible, this is it -- we need more seminars like this one !! Kent Hovind is right on!",1374624000,2,122,3.92
5076903,5,B007C7UXV0,"I purchased this set for my brother who is currently deployed. Because he enjoyed it so much with his family several years ago when I gave it to him for Christmas, he specifically requested this set be set to him at his location so that he might share the information with others. He never tires of telling me what a wonderful set this is and how it has changed and continues to change lives. A wonderful educational set for anyone who takes their study of Biblical Scripture seriously!",1373328000,6,486,4.534090909090909
8514297,5,B007C7UXV0,Kent Hovind purposely did not copyright these dvds so that they would be copied and spread the truth more quickly.,1528070400,,114,4.75
8514298,1,B007C7UXV0,These are not the original DVDs nor are they new.  No copyright information on the DVDs.  We have the actual series at our church.  This is NOT it.  I am reporting to Amazon.,1512691200,2,174,4.181818181818182
8514299,5,B007C7UXV0,"Dr. Hovind has made some questionable decisions as of late, but here he is at his best. Hovind in his prime using science, logic, and biblical exegesis to demonstrate not only the lack of logic and true science behind evolution, but the inherently evil results of an evolutionary view of life. Indispensable for any student of Christian apologetics.",1512604800,2,349,5.0344827586206895
