Very informative with lots of commentary and singing and dancing. If you're a fan, don't hesitate.",1287360000,5,246,4.25531914893617
3946529,5,B002LFPARA,"I've been waiting for this documentary to be made every since
her passing from brain cancer in 2003.
There was another one which I owned briefly that seemed pretty
good except it was all in spanish with no subtitles, so I regretfully
had to return it. But this one I saw tonight for the first time on PBS
and thought that it was fantastic!
Celia Cruz was and is forever an icon & worldwide
ambassador of salsa music, love, understanding and afro-caribbean culture in general!
Her rallying cry...AZUCAR!!--Was known by all who loved her amazing voice,
flamboyant & joyful personality as well as her huge infectious spirit throughout
her unprecedented 50 yr career!
Her voice was rich, deep, emotive and carried in it all the wisdom, joy, pain & ethos
of the african-cuban and carribean experience which she had lived in earnest!

I liken her to great african-american artists of the past like
Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Mahalia Jackson, etc., in that she
transcended just her music and was something much more on the world stage!
Like the aforementioned artists, Celia Cruz's music, voice, and personality
got down deep inside your soul irregardless of your race, language, socio-economic
background or education level!--Her funeral, like the funerals of Ella, Louis & Mahalia,
was attended by heads of state, her peers within the entertainment industry,
and of course her devoted fans, who filed past her open coffin in both Miami & New York City
100,000 strong to show their love for their ""La Reina"", who was such an integral part
of their lives!--Again, this is a must-have DVD for Celia Cruz fans and worth every dollar!

Rest In Peace Forever Celia ""La Reina"" Cruz!!---(October 21, 1925 - July 16, 2003)",1256083200,20,1715,4.951388888888889
