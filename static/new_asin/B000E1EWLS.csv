8103800,4,B000E1EWLS,"This is a fun compilation of Terrytoon animated shorts (my 2- and 4-year old kids watched it all the way through, even laughing out loud several times), which were mostly (all?) previously available on a number of really rare Magnetic Video issued cassettes under the various characters.

Included on this tape are 'Heckle & Jeckle: Out Again, In Again' (1948); the Oscar-winning animated short film 'Sidney's Family Tree' (1958); 'Heckle & Jeckle: The Lion Hunt' (1949); 'Astronut: Twinkle Twinkle Little Telstar' (1965); 'Sad Cat: Dress Reversal' (1965, directed by - of all people - Ralph Bakshi!); 'Heckle & Jeckle: Hula Hula Land' (1949); 'Possible Possum: Darn Barn' (1965); 'James Hound: Traffic Trouble' (yes, a James Bond parody - and also directed by Ralph Bakshi); and, finally, 'Deputy Dawg: Dog-Gone Catfish' (1960).

The contrast between the animation style of the Heckle & Jeckle shorts (all from the '40s) versus those of all the other shorts (almost all from the '60s) can be a little jarring at times, with the classic Terrytoons animation house style mashed up against the almost UPA-like abstractness of 'Sidney' and 'Astronut,' or Bakshi's stuff.

Still, again, fun to watch for classic animation fans like myself, and the kids should enjoy them, too.",1459123200,,1272,5.195121951219512
