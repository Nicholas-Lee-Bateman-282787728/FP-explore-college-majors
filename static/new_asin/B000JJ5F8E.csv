2672462,4,B000JJ5F8E,"In Los Angeles, California on November 4th, 1970, a young girl at 13 years old is rescued from her home by social workers.  What they found was that she was isolated for a decade in a locked room and tied to a potty chair.  She had virtually no human contact and no tactile interaction of any benefit and this helped to deprive her of any semblance of a normal life.  In effect, she was underdeveloped, unable to communicate, she could barely walk and she exhibited many unusual behaviors.  Due in part to a dysfunctional set of parents, it was difficult to get a proper history of all the horrible neglect that occurred here.

Eventually named `Genie' by the doctors and experts that worked with her at a children's hospital, so began a time of medical examination and analysis that lasted from about 1970 to 1975.  During this time, Genie was, for lack of a better word, juggled between many people and environments in an effort to rehabilitate and heal her.  At the end of this time period when these efforts were discontinued, Genie was shuffled between various foster homes which proved to be very detrimental in part because she was subjected to more abuse, punishment, and harassment in these different locations.

Because of additional difficulties caused by foster care, Genie was again returned to the children's hospital for further treatment.  To compound an already fragile situation, Genie's mother filed a lawsuit against the many experts and the hospital that worked with her citing `excessive and outrageous testing'.  This coming from an irresponsible and unconscionable parent that was, in part, responsible for this entire ordeal from the beginning.  The suit was eventually settled out of court and Genie is currently a resident in a care home in California to this day.

`Secret of the Wild Child', although not very long, seems to do a credible job in detailing the known facts and events that played a significant impact in Genie's life after her rescue.  There is a decent mix of interviews from various experts and a good portion of video footage showing Genie's therapy and rehabilitation and it makes for a worthwhile production in my opinion.",1184284800,51,2171,4.9150684931506845
2672463,5,B000JJ5F8E,"This is perhaps one of the most important stories in the field of Child Development.  Not only does it illustrate a story of unimaginable child abuse and provide unparalleled insight into the effects of social isoloation on the psychological and mental development of humans, but it also reveals the darker side of science -- a part so driven by notoriety and money that it ends up abusing Genie over and over.

All students of psychology, child development, linguistics, social work, and related fields should see this program and get to know it intimately.",1174176000,26,558,4.989247311827957
2672464,4,B000JJ5F8E,"I first became aware of the ""Genie"" story because the home where she was kept was a few blocks away from me in Temple City, CA.  Her story was front page news in 1970 as more and more details came out about how she had never left her bedroom for her entire life, and how dysfunctional the family was.  The father committed suicide less than a week after the headlines for hit.

The PBS documentary on Genie is excellent and must see for all psychology students, brain researchers, and anyone interested in the whole concept of how a child develops in the ""wild"".",1172448000,17,562,4.436893203883495
8150805,5,B000JJ5F8E,"The key scientific interest in the sad drama of Susan Wiley (Genie) is ""can an enriched environment make up for years of neglect and abuse?""

The NOVA program leaves the viewer wondering.

You'll have to make up your own mind, but do look for the EEG data discussed by Dr. Jay Shurley, and weigh it against the testing data offered by Prof. Susan Curtis.",1369094400,,354,4.515625
8150806,5,B000JJ5F8E,"This episode of Nova fascinated me and I think it will captivate most viewers. The story is of a real case; a young girl is rescued by social workers when she is 13; she has been brutally kept in solitary confinement by her father since she was 2 years old when he found out she may have been slightly developmentally disabled. The story tugged at my heartstrings and moved me deeply. Although the film is scarcely one hour long, Nova packs quite a bit into it and thus the story never gets boring nor is there anything to be edited out of this film. I also like how they mix archival footage of ""Genie,"" with more recent interviews and the narration.

The film begins with the discovery of a girl who is called ""Genie"" to protect her identity. Unfortunately, not much more about this poor girl gets protected. She had been imprisoned for over a decade by her viciously abusive father in a small back room of her parents' home in California, chained to a potty chair with no real human interaction. Apparently when her father would give her what little she had to eat he would actually bark or growl at her instead of using words! Worse yet, she was beaten for vocalizing or trying to say anything; she learned early on not to open her mouth for fear of being beaten. In addition, ""Genie"" had an odd way of walking that they described as a ""bunny hop"" type of walk most likely because of her inability to learn to walk normally when she was much younger. We'll never know the full extent of what the poor girl endured because her father killed himself just days after she was discovered and her mother was nearly blind and quite emotionally unstable.

And all of that got the ball rolling. ""Genie"" was taken to Children's Hospital where all of the staff wanted to help her; yet I think they were so unprepared for her case that they didn't truly think through the best way to handle her. For example, some scientists also functioned as therapeutic surrogate parents and bonded with her; this was not a good idea. Researchers and scientists, sensing an opportunity to make their mark in scientific history, wanted to experiment on ""Genie"" to determine a number of things including whether she could learn language when she was already 13 or 14 and even the best of them cruelly abandoned her when federal funding to study and heal her dried up.

I could tell you so much more but I don't want to ruin it for you with spoilers. Suffice it to say that you'll be amazed by the true story of ""Genie.""

Overall, ""The Secret of the Wild Child"" should be mandatory viewing for anyone in the helping professions and/or child development; this case raises ethical issues that deserve critical thought. Persons who like documentaries in general will not be disappointed.",1339718400,,2759,4.59026369168357
8150807,5,B000JJ5F8E,"Secret of the Wild Child tells the compelling story of Susan Wiley, a young girl who was rescued from a dysfunctional home during the 1970s by a system that ultimately failed her.  Nova explores her journey from Hell to Limbo in an unforgettable documentary that shows the darkest sides of humanity and the captivating innocence of a child.  You too will be haunted by this beautiful girl whom everybody simply referred to as Genie.

I would so love to own a copy of this DVD!",1327276800,,476,4.576470588235294
8150808,5,B000JJ5F8E,"This little autistic child's history of abuse is most heart wrenching, and therapists seem overwhelmed with the challenge of helping her grow up. This report may upset you!",1265587200,,172,5.178571428571429
8150809,5,B000JJ5F8E,"This episode focuses on the discovery of a child that had been abused and
secluded in a small room with little human contact until she was found at
13 years old. The seclusion had resulted in severely limited childhood
development, including the lack of acquisition of language. The documentary
tells the story of her rehabilitation, and the missteps that occur during it.

Ultimately, ""Wild Child"" Genie's rehabilitation was unsuccessful, and her
profound handicaps and doubtful rehabilitation leave a deep sorrow in the
heart. Very moving and an interesting glimpse into some of the issues about
childhood development.

There is also a good book on Genie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Genie-a-Scientific-Tragedy/dp/0060924659/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Genie: a Scientific Tragedy</a>

8150810,5,B000JJ5F8E,I watched this movie approximately 10 years ago.  And I have never been the same since.  This story will destroy the final thread that ties you to the belief that there is hope for humanity. If you are looking for a good reason to hate people (all people).  This is a good place to start.,1262649600,2,288,4.2
8150811,5,B000JJ5F8E,"As a professor teaching an Introductory Child Development course, I fully recommend this movie.  The students in my course were captivated and many chose to write about Genie for an open-ended project.  It is a great way to talk about topics such as nature vs. nurture, language acquisition, abuse, and research ethics.",1257379200,8,319,5.115384615384615
8150812,5,B000JJ5F8E,"Secret of the Wild Child tells the story of Genie, a 13 year old girl who was discovered by social workers. Genie had been raised in a small, featureless room since the age of 18 months--strapped into a potty chair by day and a crib by night, no one was allowed to talk with her, play with her, or give her the least sign of human affection and communication. This video shows the struggle of the psychologists and caretakers who tried to teach Genie the simple everyday things that we all take for granted--how to wear clothing, how to feed herself, and how to talk. Her struggle to learn language was a key issue for cognitive theorists who believed that there is a critical period for learning language, a period that Genie missed. Powerful and moving.",1239321600,6,755,4.5588235294117645
8150813,5,B000JJ5F8E,"I've found this to be the most professional, fair-minded summary of Genie's story yet. The footage of Genie is fascinating, although I do wish there were more details about the results of the tests on her. I was disappointed to find that half the movie is about a different feral child named Viktor, but the parts that are about Genie are excellent.",1185235200,15,349,4.645161290322581
