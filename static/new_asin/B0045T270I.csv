Absolutely superb. I am so glad that I have bought this. I actually felt very emotional listening to this Blu-ray and I highly recommend anyone to listen to this Blu-Ray. This Blu-ray offers brilliantly effective lossless audio tracks in DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 mix together with a LPCM 2.0 stereo fold-down. Fidelity is superb throughout all 14 performances, with gorgeously mixed orchestral sections that are well placed spatially and never overpower each other.",1321660800,5,632,5.59375
