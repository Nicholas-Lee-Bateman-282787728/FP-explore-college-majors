2736343,4,B000MKXEXI,"This is the best yoga DVD i have ever used.  I have been doing yoga at home for over 5 years, but never like this.  I am getting such a great work out.  I feel my body changing from all the movemets.  Eva has a great way of describing and showing all the yoga moves.  I would highly recomend this DVD.",1193702400,,301,3.8688524590163933
2736344,5,B000MKXEXI,"I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. It is one of the more light hearted, fun yoga classes I have tried on DVD. It made me smile, and I felt like i got a good workout. i highly reccommend it.",1191715200,,185,3.8947368421052633
2736345,5,B000MKXEXI,"I like Eva's approach to yoga.  I can do it in my living room!  In the market of highly stylized yoga dvds, filmed on beaches and in  meditation rooms, her down to earth approach is a breath of fresh air.  The actual living room portion of the dvd is something that can be done after coming home from a long day at work.  Just kick off your shoes, sit down on the couch, and begin!  The library portion of the disc is informative.  Eva works with two practioners, showing them multiple poses, and how to do them correctly.  The actual workout portion of the disc is intermediate, so if you're a novice like me, work from the bottom of the menu up.  I hope to be doing Eva's yoga workout in no time.  I recommend this dvd for beginners and experts.  It makes you feel fantastic no matter what your experience level is.",1184976000,4,817,4.2745098039215685
2736346,4,B000MKXEXI,"In Living Room Yoga, instructor Eva Barash offers a down-to-earth yoga practice set--where else?--right in her living room (well, in someone's living room, this one being quite modern, with chrome furniture and a flat-screen TV).  She describes her 45-minute yoga practice as being ""not for beginners,"" as some of the poses are a bit more challenging, and she does not provide a lot of detailed form instruction.  However, a separate section of the DVD, titled ""The Library,"" offers almost 30 minutes of more detailed breakdowns for many individual postures.  THe Main DVD menu includes the following options:  Play All-Introduction-The Workout-The Library.  There are also bonus materials, including ""Getting the Most Out of Your Living Room"" (see below), and a 6-minute interview with Eva.

As mentioned above, main yoga workout is about 45 minutes long, with Eva teaching live in a casual, laid-back manner (although surprisingly, she mostly uses Sanskrit names for the postures).  The practice begins seated on the floor for some opening poses, including down dog and locust, with Eva's sequencing continuing to be non-traditional throughout.  She does then move on to sun salutations, completing 10 total rounds:  4 modified, 4 full, and 2 with breathing only (no instruction).  Following this, Eva performs some standing side stretches and then moves to the floor to lie briefly in relaxation pose and to perform a reclined twist.  A standing series is next, starting with warrior 1 to warrior 2 to wide angle forward bend then side angle, triangle, and another standing forward bend.  Next the difficulty level increases a bit with side angle and half moon postures, and then Eva finishes the standing work with dancer's pose.  Moving to face-down on the floor, Eva performs half bow before moving on to full bow pose.  She does a simple straight leg seated twist before proceeding to some abs work in the form of single and then double knee hugs.  Bridge pose follows, adding a block under the sacrum for a supported inversion, and then the practice finishes with a brief savasana.

The Making the Most of Your Living Room segment is a shorter (12 minutes) stretching program that uses a couch for most of the exercises.  Seated on the couch, Eva performs modified fish, seated twist, seated forward bend, and wide-leg seated forward bend.  She then stands behind the couch for modified down dog, single leg lift, modified push-ups, and tadasana.  Moving back to seated, she does a seated backbend over the arm rest and then lies on the floor with her calves resting on the couch to finish.

This DVD would be best suited for those looking for a very down-to-earth, straightforward yoga practice which is more focused on the stretching than the spiritual aspects of yoga (in fact, the DVD case calls the practice a blend of core strength and ""yoga calisthenics"").  I'd say that it is appropriate for advanced beginners who have a solid foundation in yoga but are ready to experiment with a few slightly more difficult postures such as half moon and dancer's pose.  The bonus workout is intended as a means to de-stress without even having to change into your workout clothes, and it's certainly a nice addition for those short on time.  Overall a solid DVD that is likely to appeal to many casual yoga practitioners.",1183852800,20,3324,4.992740471869329
2736347,5,B000MKXEXI,"I've bought other dvds where I couldn't stand the personality/voice of the instructor and was really pleasantly surprised in this case. I just love Eva. She's totally sweet and down-to-earth and walks you through every move with some really refreshing commentary. I like the Rodney Yi dvds, but I prefer this one because she's not miles away on some fantasy island--she's in her living room and really guides you through the practice instead of just showing you how to do it and having there be all this dead silence while you wonder if you're doing it right! And for that reason too, I found the library to be really useful. It breaks down how to do all the main poses the right way. I'd definitely recommend the dvd.",1182902400,7,718,4.6171875
2736348,5,B000MKXEXI,Simply the best Yoga video I've encountered.,1182124800,2,44,5.428571428571429
2736349,5,B000MKXEXI,"This DVD was really great! I found it to be informative and the instruction was excellent. She gives a practice that anyone can follow. It's like she is right there in your living room working with you. I have taken many classes and have tried many DVD's/videos and she is one of the best I have ever taken.

I highly recommend this DVD!",1179792000,5,337,4.349206349206349
2736350,4,B000MKXEXI,One of the better Home Yoga DVDs you can buy.  Purchased the DVD from a magazine recommendation and my girlfriend and I have not been disappointed.,1216339200,,147,4.653846153846154
2736351,5,B000MKXEXI,"On her ""Strengthen and Lengthen"" Yoga DVD, Eva leads you through a focused, energetic, and spiritually uplifting practice that leaves you feeling refreshed, relaxed, and renewed.  The workout is simple, but thorough and relatively challenging, although I feel even a novice would be comfortable moving through poses with Eva.

She provides a wealth of resources to encourage movement and self-awareness - from the library section to the abbreviated living room workout, the interview, and the actual workout. The library section of the DVD is particularly helpful in regards to proper alignment and how the body should move or feel.

Eva's personality is utterly infectious, and she easily establishes a happy rapport with compassion and gentle leadership. Laughing is permitted, which makes the experience that much more joyful.  Of all the Yoga DVDs I've viewed, I believe hers is one of the best.  Anyone who values the mind/body/heart connection will enjoy this DVD.  Namaste, indeed.",1216166400,3,988,5.383116883116883
2736352,5,B000MKXEXI,"I love these videos.  Eva Barash's teaching style conveys a real joy in what she is doing and makes yoga feel more like something wonderful to do for yourself than any sort of exercise chore. In fact, I laughed ""with her"" a few times, like when she said to ""spread your toes"" and noticed she could not do that without spreading her fingers, too... etc. etc... Yes, such ""personality moments"" in these DVDs are charming and funny and make her sound real as she so generously shares her wide-ranging knowledge about the practice of yoga.

I was especially appreciative for the Library sections of the DVDs where she really breaks down the elements involved in achieving different poses. And though I am probably doing only a tiny fraction of them, I like the feeling of trying to do these postures, I like the thinking involved in the execution of them, and the non-thinking that occurs later during the relaxation parts. What a perfect way to start my hectic day.",1210204800,3,962,4.686390532544379
2736353,5,B000MKXEXI,"This dvd is one of the best I have done. I have been doing yoga for years and have done many Rodney Yee videos but I must say Eva really keeps you focused. Instead of lots of silence during the practice, Eva helps you to visualize what you should be doing and how you should be feeling. That is a major help for someone like me. I love this dvd and have already purchased the second dvd! I highly recommend them both!!",1207612800,2,418,4.109756097560975
2736354,5,B000MKXEXI,"I first tried the second DVD, Twist and Bend.  I just tried the Strength and Lengthen DVD.  I love it as much as the first.  It's the easy conversation and detailed explanations of Eva Barash. She is so patient yet thorough.  I got a great work out.  Just listening and following her direction made the workout enjoyable.  I felt so relaxed as if it was just she and I in my living room.  I definitely recommend this for everyone.",1201651200,2,430,4.367088607594937
2736355,4,B000MKXEXI,"Dr. Beth Chollette & Caravaggio38 both wrote insightful reviews on both the personality, pace & content of this yoga dvd so I won't be redundant here.
The fact Eva does it in the living room is great, she's sweet, like working out with a girlfriend. She's very encouraging, she gives both the Sanskrit & English pose names, she tells you how to move your body well, she uses great analogies, ""lift up your heart"" & even reminders on how not to move or what to watch out for on some poses which most don't give. She also gives a lot of rests in between poses except for during the sun salutations. The extra library tutorial is great. Because of that, I think this is fine for beginner yoga practitioners or even novices. She shows good body awareness, she isn't afraid to add a unique extra stretch during downward dog that really helps open you up that I've always done on my own that's made me relax tight areas.
I'd give it 5 stars except for several reasons:
She really races through the sun salutations, but luckily that's the only place she races, she spends a perfect amount of time on all other poses. When she did it with just breathing, you see her be more aware of her body & go a little slower. She admits she races after she's done.
She has a sweet voice, but she seemed very jittery, overly chatty, racing through words, unable to be quiet though I could see she can be relaxed especially in savasana. It was a bit distracting & I couldn't relax or be more aware of my body because of it. She is silent here whereas most keep talking during savasana which is refreshing. I think it would have been perfect if she did a voice over after so she can be aware of her body during filming & relaxed voice separately. It's probably her first time, so I will look forward to her more relaxed nature in future videos.
Eva's occasional choice of words. Though she means to be encouraging & say that she knows it's hard, she kept saying ""we're almost done"" or etc. to remind you that it can be hard. But like anything else, if you keep your mind on connecting or enjoyment, anything hard will not seem so, or even seem easy, if you're enjoying yourself. Constant reminders don't help or tell you something is hard when you don't think it is.
The rest after sun salutations bothered me, Yes, sun salutions are demanding, but having me lay down after I'm heated up seems to defeat the purpose. Yes, I'd love a rest & more simple stretches, but there were others I could do that didn't require me to lay down as if we were done.
These are minor quibbles, those looking to work out with a knowledgeable, detailed-oriented girlfriend with body awareness will love this. The second time I viewed this, I wasn't bothered at all by her instruction & I was able to relax & sense my body easily.
Those looking for a more relaxed narration even with the same amount of info during & body awareness should look to Rodney Yee, Rainbeau Mars, Seane Corn, Better Sex with yoga, Yoga w/Ateeka, etc.",1201219200,4,2985,4.4389799635701275
2736356,5,B000MKXEXI,"Eva gives a great class with fabulous down-to earth instructions. A great yoga class, and a great DVD to help me use my own living room as my very own  personal yoga studio/spa. A terrific workout and a fabulous de-stresser. I use this DVD more than all the others I have bought.",1200873600,,279,4.365384615384615
2736357,5,B000MKXEXI,"After years of trying (unsuccessfully) to ""get into"" yoga, I stumbled into one of Eva's real-life classes over 5 years ago.  Her challenging, honest, and joyful classes hooked me, and contributed to dramatically changing my body and lifestyle.  I've taken a lot of yoga in a lot of cities and places, and she remains my favorite teacher.  Ever.  She made yoga accessible (to a very straightforward, non-traditionally-""yogic"" person like myself), and has made me choose to make yoga a part of my daily life.

That said, this DVD is like one of her classes . . . it doens't feel stagey; it's authentic and challenging, and a really good workout.  One of my favorite things is that Eva has a real voice, not that annoying sing song that I think of as ""yoga teacher voice"", and doesn't take herself too seriously.  She really makes her classes and DVD about the fun of the physicality of our bodies in space and the awesomeness of our bodies, minds, and breath working together.",1198540800,3,974,4.694117647058824
2736358,5,B000MKXEXI,"This is by far the most accessible and friendly yoga DVD I have come across.  While I love to practice with beautiful beaches on screen, I found this DVD very refreshing.  I was immediately struck by the sense of familiarity, fun and humility of the video.  She was doing it in a living room!  You know Eva did not spend a lot to produce the video, but her sincerety, humility and sense of joy come through, and that makes her practice more enticing.

(1) Eva is so accessible - You can understand her and relate to her. Her explanations are simple and friendly. She tells you what to expect so you don't wonder in the middle of a pose whether you should be moving on to the next one. Even if you are a beginner, you will not be overwhelmed.  She looks like an ordinary person (I don't mean this in a dismissive way but as a complement), who does not do ""perfect"" poses.  Just watch when she transitions from upward facing dog to downward facing dog - she does it the way I and many other ordinary practitioners do.

(2) She seems to enjoy what she is doing. I rarely see yogis on DVD smile while practicing. In fact, I'm now trying to think of one who actually does smile while practicing.

(3) She gives instructions while actually doing the poses herself, so you know that her poses and sequence are doable. I also appreciate the fact that she doesn't do ""perfect"" poses.

(4) Her introduction to the DVD is very useful and practical (for example, she says that her sequence is not for complete beginners, and that if you are a complete beginner you should check the library for more explanation).

(5) Her short presentation on how to do poses using objects in your living room, while wearing jeans, is  very practical and useful.

I've tried it a couple of times since I got the DVD recently, and I have no doubt that I will use it often.  This is by far the friendliest, most accessible, most practical and most enjoyable yoga DVD I've had and I am glad I bought it!",1194912000,7,1972,4.381868131868132
2736359,3,B000MKXEXI,I guess i didn't realize that you can't follow the video and do the exercises at the same time because most of the poses make it impossible to watch the screen.  it's a great workout if you can memorize it,1194134400,,205,4.125
8169570,3,B000MKXEXI,"This is a nice home practice DVD for someone familiar with yoga and preferably strong.  Eva doesn't show modifications in the 49-minute practice.  It has lots of sun salutations.

The music is nice, but nothing extraordinary.

The setting looks to be like a real living room, but one that is spacious and airy, with modern furniture and a lot of natural light.

Eva's instruction is very good, as long as you're not a true beginner.

There's a 27-minute library that breaks the poses down, which is very good for someone not familiar with yoga.

It's definitely Iyengar influenced, with long holds and making use of props, such as blocks.

Eva seems very sincere, but her cheerful flippancy was too much for me, which is why I found the DVD to be just okay - but that's me.

I think this would be a great DVD for someone who has someone knowledge of yoga but would like to have a nice home practice.  It will definitely help with strength.",1407456000,,939,4.535714285714286
8169571,5,B000MKXEXI,"I LOVED THIS DVD! I made my children sit down and watch it with me and they definitely learned some new things. The yoga part was great but because my kids are such picky eaters, the nutrition segment was quite helpful. Lisa Cohn does a great job and makes a good point when she says that it is the parents responsibility to provide healthy foods but it is ultimately up to the child to decide what they will eat and how much. My kids now have smoothies frequently and vegetables are more tolerable with the dipping sauces she mentioned such as barbecue sauce which we had never tried before. I highly recommend this video to parents because it provides examples of healthy snacks as well as the effects that the different ingredients in the snacks have on your body. GREAT VIDEO!!",1339027200,,781,4.546099290780142
8169572,5,B000MKXEXI,"LIVING ROOM YOGA it's a great practice that I'm glad I discovered. I wasn't really expecting much because I'd never heard of this instructor and there are some minor audio problems in the beginning sequence however don't let that detour you Eva Barash is fantastic; her friendly laid back manner and live (not dubbed over) voice instruction makes you feel as if you're working out with one of your fun, energetic girlfriends in the comfort of your own living room. Eva is down to earth, encouraging, relatable and best of all happy giving us a balanced and somewhat challenging advanced-beginners workout. I've been using this for several months now and Eva always feels like a breath of fresh air and leaves me smiling.

Using Sanskrit and English pose names we begin our 45 minute practice in yes a living room; with some seated opening poses (Down dog, Locust) before performing 10 rounds of basic Sun salutations, moving onto Standing side stretches, a brief relaxation and Reclined twist. We move onto a 20 minute standing series which includes Warriors 1 & 2, Wide angle foreword bend, Side angle, Triangle, and Half moon finishing back on the floor with Half and Full Bow, Seated twist, Bridge and yoga sit ups concluding with a brief yet lovely savasana.

There is not a lot of detailed instruction provided here however the practice flows well and is easy to follow providing you have a basic knowledge of the poses. For beginners I recommend the bonus feature called ""the library"" which gives a 30 minute detailed breakdown of the poses. Also included in the bonus features is a short interview with Eva and ""making the most out of your living room"" which is a 12 minute stretching program  incorporating a couch into the exercises.

I really enjoyed this delightful, fresh Yoga practice and highly recommend it. Namas",1265587200,3,1828,4.868167202572347
8169573,5,B000MKXEXI,I have 3 of the 4 DVD's. I have taken yoga classes and enjoyed them. I have to say this DVD is as good or better because I can do it from home . Eva talks to you like she's in the room with you. I still laugh at some of the little jokes she makes on the DVD. I just can't say enough good things about all three DVD's. I am ordering the Prenatal DVD next. ENJOY!,1265328000,,361,3.641025641025641
8169574,4,B000MKXEXI,"I like this video and you really can do it in your living room. Eva is a little kooky, but that makes it fun and not so serious. The video and sound seem a little amateurish (her voice gets muffled if she's laying face down), but it's a good workout. I find myself picking it before some of my other yoga dvd's because it's a good yoga workout and makes me smile at some of the silly things Eva says.",1265241600,2,400,4.0125
8169575,2,B000MKXEXI,"This seemed like it would be basic Yoga. It is not. But like another reviewer said, you don't find this out until the intro. In the intro she said if you were a beginner to go to a specific section. So I did. That section (along with all others) were very heavy into downward dog and plank which I found to be hard on my shoulders and wrists.  How can you spend so long in those positions I don't know. The video is hard to do and watch at the same time but you must since there's no indication of when one section ends and another begins, it just jumps to the next. At one point I had my eyes shut and she jumped to the next section. Sloppy. The room she teaches in is echo-y, her mic goes up and down, and she does not have the calm voice which I was looking for. It seems like the first time the assistants have done the routine too as in at least one part she corrects them. There are few points she says funny hippy-ish things like feeling your self, or feeling your brain rest on the floor. One meditation was basically just laying on the floor and relaxing, you learn nothing by what she says. The one section which I did like was the making the most out of your living room. THAT I can and would do.",1263686400,,1207,4.050209205020921
8169576,5,B000MKXEXI,A little too strenuous for the beginner and too easy for the advanced.  This DVD gives a wonderful intermediate workout.  It's light and quick (relatively) and good stress relief at the end of a busy day.  This is NOT a slow & relaxing dvd - but it helps ME work out the kinks I have built up.,1242864000,2,293,4.105263157894737
8169577,5,B000MKXEXI,"I love this 45-minute practice. It's not too short and not too long. And, as mentioned, Eva Barash's non-traditional sequencing is a nice change of pace. I love that she doesn't start off with sun salutations. There's not much to add to Beth Cholette's excellent breakdown of the poses, but here are a few I want to mention:
- A nice hip twist in plank which is challenging but also a yummy stretch.
- In bridge, she has you place a block under your sacrum and then lift your legs up. I am a shoulder stand sissy and this is the perfect way for me to actually enjoy having my legs up in the air.
- In her yoga ""calisthenics"" portion she does one move, a combination of (Pilates) toe dips and a reverse crunch, which is pure candy.

Eva Barash has a playful, unpretentious attitude and her instruction is both delightful and reassuring. As for pacing, I consider the sun salutations to be just fast enough. They are nowhere near as fast as a Bryan Kest practice, but they will get your heart rate up. The standing poses are held for a good while so you can really dig into the pose. All in all, a well rounded and invigorating practice for the advanced beginner and beyond. (Note: I consider myself an advanced beginner and have been practicing yoga for 6 years.)

Although the filming appears to be independently produced, it's very high quality with only some minor audio difficulties when her mic gets muffled. I only mention this for those who are sensitive to sound. For me the practice is so enjoyable that the occasional audio quirks are easily overlooked.",1238112000,3,1562,4.535460992907802
8169578,1,B000MKXEXI,"This yoga session is not for beginners, the instructor mentions this during the introduction but there was no reference to it in the bio or reviews as being ""for those who have practiced for some time"".

The instructors voice is loud and constant throughout the workout, this really annoyed me as, I just wanted her to shut-up. I expected a soothing voice with long periods of silence which is what I had experienced a few times in actual yoga classes and was really beneficial to my enjoyment and concentration. Her voice and instructions jerk around, are disjointed and not seamless at all.
She also carried on with spiritual references like, get what you can from the earth, feel its energy, which sounded really airy fairy and made her sound like a band wagon yoga groupie.

I sat and watched the remainder of the DVD as I just couldn't keep up with the advanced postures which jumped straight into strong plank poses, with no alternative position for beginners, I could not hold the positions and I am in good physical shape and gym 3 times a week. The instructor bounced between difficult poses and wafted on.

I felt like this was a complete waste of money for me.
Hugely disappointing.

Try Jessie Chapman's Radiance Yoga, much better and worth the money.",1231459200,5,1263,4.7272727272727275
8169579,1,B000MKXEXI,The title is completely misleading. This is a very intense yoga tape paced far beyond what is traditionally done in most yoga classes. It is more like power yoga.  She moves way too quickly between poses. There is no instruction and it is very difficult to keep up.,1224547200,5,265,4.520833333333333
