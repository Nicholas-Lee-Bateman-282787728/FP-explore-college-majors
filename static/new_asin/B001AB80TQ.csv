I would highly recommend these videos to anyone looking to practice at home some specific techniques and want to know what Shotokan Karate is all about.",1360713600,,294,4.673076923076923
8276553,5,B001AB80TQ,"Sensei Richard Amos has done it again with the second in his Shotokan Mastery series. Clear and concise, this video embodies the essence of traditional Shotokan karate training. Just as the first video this one presents the basic, beginner level fundamentals of Shotokan Karate in a manner that makes it accessible for anyone. One could literally learn karate straight from this program. The production quality is top notch. Each technique is shown from various angles as Sensei Amos gives detailed explanations on proper form and muscle position. The music that plays in the background throughout lends a very traditional Japanese feel to the program. I would highly recommend Shotokan Mastery to anyone who has ever had any interest in real karate training.",1266710400,,759,5.229508196721311
8276554,5,B001AB80TQ,"Below is my review of the first Shotokan Mastery DVD. This second DVD builds on the first, demonstrating Heian Nidan & Heian Sandan and some bunkai. I feel the need to reiterate - this is the most beautiful martial arts DVD I have ever seen.

""I have been using martial arts dvds in other arts for over 15 years now. As I am new to Shotokan, I wanted to see what videos were available and Shotokan Mastery is the first DVD that I decided to purchase. The content is spot on with what I'm doing, and it is very helpful to me in training. What really impresses me is the amount of work that must have gone into such a production as this. It is a work of art in itself! I've never seen a martial arts instructional dvd like it and I look forward to more in the future!""",1223510400,3,766,4.1066666666666665
