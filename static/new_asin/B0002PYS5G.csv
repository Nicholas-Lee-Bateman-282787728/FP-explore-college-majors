2113841,5,B0002PYS5G,"What Happy Days did for the 1950s-60's, That 70's Show does expertly for the 1970's. Teenagers growing up in the decade of easy drugs and free love have to deal with their parents who are (ironically) a throwback to the 1950's themselves.

My favirote character is Donna Pinciotti, the tomboy living next door to 'All American' Eric Foreman (the 'Richie Cunningham' character of the series). The two families grew up together but hormones cause new feelings to emerge. As an inside joke, one of her 'hipster' parents is former Charlie's Angel Tanya Roberts (okay, Roberts joined that show in the early 1980's, but that show itself is considered a 1970's icon).

Also like Happy Days, the older sibling was dumped to add an older male 'rebel' houseguest who was on hand to dispense advice to the 'squares'.

My least favirote character is Michael Kelso (Ashton Kutcher). He's not as clownish as he became in the middle seasons, but it's hard to root for somebody who is intentionally made to be a buffon.

The only thing I am not crazy about is the psychedelic scene transitions in the show episodes. I don't think they add anything to the plot because we already know the show is supposed to be set in the 1970's.",1091750400,9,1213,4.7075471698113205
2113842,5,B0002PYS5G,This is a great sitcom.  I can't wait for the other seasons to be released!!!,1091404800,2,77,4.133333333333334
2113843,4,B0002PYS5G,"this is a great series 100% funness!

 btw, might i recommend getting ""Dorm Daze"" and ""Boy Meets World Season-1"" out August 2004?",1091318400,,129,4.818181818181818
2113844,5,B0002PYS5G,"I am so happy this show is coming to dvd. It's a funny, endearing, well written and from time to time touching television show. Topher Grace shines as Eric Forman, as does everyone else.",1091318400,5,186,4.5
2113845,5,B0002PYS5G,"It's about time!!!!! I'm SOOOOO psyched that That 70s Show is finally hitting DVD. It seemed like every other on earth was getting released except this one. I've been a fan of T7S since the very first season back in 1998 and I think it's one of the best shows to ever hit the air waves in recent years. The past couple of seasons of the show haven't been the best, but the first three seasons are absolutely awesome and season one happens to be my absolute favorite. Great music, great clothes, great characters, and great actors equal a great show. I hope all the original music is on there though. The one bad thing about having the show on syndication is that all the original music was changed. I have the episodes from when they originally aired on FOX and those are the songs that should be on DVD. Let's hope so!",1091318400,21,819,4.359477124183006
2113846,5,B0002PYS5G,I'm so excited for the DVD to come out!  I have to email all my buddies and let them know!  That 70's Show is the best thing to happen to TV and I can't get enough of it!,1091318400,2,170,3.4473684210526314
2113847,5,B0002PYS5G,"Frist, I would like to say that it is about time for ""that 70's show"" to be released on dvd. With seven seasons of ""friends"" and shows like, ""all in the family"", and ""MASH"" in second or third seasons, it's great to see a more recent show being realesed on dvd. I guess the producers have finally learned that people will pay for season to season of their favorite show's.

 The show is terrific, the first season has great episodes like 'eric's first job', and 'the pill', and who could forget the pilot, pass it this way, puff puff give. Nothing like network television finally acknowledging bud smoking in prime time.

 Even though I think the second and third seasons are the best; season one is a great start. Buy this dvd you will not be disappointed.",1091318400,26,756,4.4963503649635035

2113978,3,B0002PYS5G,"Mill Creek said on their site that ""most though not all the original music is intact"" but yet when I actually compared the set with the original DVD's Fox released back in the 2000s, the majority of the music replacements were still there. I was highly anticipating to hear all the classic 70s songs that were featured in the original run of this show (music has been missing since early syndication). I was also hoping for a completely unedited version of Celebration Day, but sadly it's not and is instead the same edited version seen since syndication and DVD. To put it in one sentence, Mill Creek lied to us and instead mostly just re-purposed the Fox DVD's except now in HD. I'm also reviewing their DVD counterpart release that came out only a couple years prior. So thank you Mill Creek for letting me down and several of us who were waiting for a proper set to be released. The only reason I haven't made the score lower is thankfully everything else in this set is very good. Visually this is the best I've seen the show look and I'm very pleased they at least treated the video with care. Plus all the special features are a treat for fans who want to buy this set.",1519689600,6,1176,4.423963133640553

It is a show tied together with clever writing, relatable storylines, Incredible actors and  fantastic character development. It follows the lives of a group of teens in the 70s, but it is easily relatable to more than just teenagers. It is a show long  adored by many, including myself. I strongly believe if you give That 70s Show  a chance, you most certainly won't regret it.",1513296000,,450,4.518518518518518
2114045,3,B0002PYS5G,"The packaging is bad, but I personally don't buy these for the discs. I buy them for the right to own the digital copy, which allows me to put them on other media. I like that they managed to put it in a very small box, but it arrived broken, probably because it's cheap plastic. But again, for the price you are paying, it wasn't all that bad.

Needless to say, the tv show is hilarious, so if you haven't seen this, you have to buy this.",1513296000,,439,4.045977011494253

2114069,5,B0002PYS5G,Best tv show I only wish it would have shown more Jackie and fez love life because they are my favorite characters. The tv show is very funny and brings you to laughter every episode. Cast of the show are the Best actors and actresses to feel in these loving characters shoes and yes I can't stop watching it. The style and production is just like the 1970s as well as the color but restored with excellent picture quality and best of all widescreen for the first time I believe.  The blu ray set is much cheaper and better made then the first the first blu ray release.  Plus the first is really crazy put together and much more money. The  only disappointing thing is this blu ray release doesn't have bonus features.  But this release is better release of the blu ray and also way better then the dvd release.  I would definitely say if you're looking for a widescreen version and picky about the blu ray set being in crapy condition  this is the version you should buy. I'm very happy with mine. I would give it 1000 stars if I could.  Best tv show. Very happy.,1512432000,2,1065,4.321608040201005

It is kind of like watching a channel with an antenna when you don't have cable!!! But, for the price you cant beat it.. There was no issues with the sound or any blank spots that I had seen. I was not much of a fan with the cheap packaging tho and the cardboard DVD holders. I was expecting it to be packaged with plastic like the individual seasons were back in the day.

I watched this when it first aired on Fox and watched it two more times on Netflix.  I figured if I watch it this frequently, I should just own it.  This show will make you laugh every time you watch it and won't get old for a very long time.  However, the few bad things that happened are, Lisa Robin Kelly (Laurie Forman) was let go after the fifth season due to alcoholism and was replaced by actress Christina Moore, (like we wouldn't notice) Topher Grace decided to leave the show alongside Ashton Kutcher to pursue movie roles, but both did return for the series finale.  lastly, the thing that bothered me most about season eight was the addition of Josh Meyers (Randy Pearson).  I really hated that character because it felt like they were trying to replace Eric Forman with him and it also seemed like they were trying to hard to make him fit where he didn't belong.  They also brought back Tommy Chong to try and replace Michael Kelso as the dumb goofy one.  Those were most of the bad things, but I still absolutely love this show and would recommend it to everybody!",1508112000,4,1228,4.4222222222222225

The episodes that are on the tv still are shown in fullscreen, it do see a little more of the scenes in widescreen. High quality, and I mean HIGH, that's the only way it should be since it is THAT 70's SHOW. Also, If you plan on buying the complete series, you must buy the series in the Blu Ray version. I see that some people who left bad reviews bought the DVD version. Blu Ray is way better!! Buy the Blu Ray complete series with the 6 main characters on the cover, also the cover is a take on a black light poster with the 6 ""kids"" in neon colors and the black part of the cover is felt-like, just like a black light poster. That 70's Show is one of my favorite tv series ever!! I just took a screenshot of the one I purchased and love!!",1496793600,7,856,4.101190476190476

Thankfully most shows these days have dropped the evil laugh track.  I watched a few minutes of 70's show the other day and couldn't believe how bad the laugh track was!  Horrible!!  That all being said, this show took awhile to grow on me when it was airing, but then I did become a fan, and mostly watched until the end of its run.

It was very nicely packaged and sits very neatly in my bookcase.  The whole cast was great and Ashton Kushner reminded me so much of my second son so it was nice to see.  The only complaint I have is they play the theme song before every episode.  After awhile, it takes away from watching more in the same set as the theme song gets annoying.  But, the price was very reasonable and the enjoyment of seeing the show again bringing back the memories of the 70's, that's a small complaint.",1491523200,,685,4.198473282442748

I would have liked more bloopers given it is a comedy show, but maybe they were just that good at their craft.

2114229,5,B0002PYS5G,"That 70's Show is a still one of the best sitcoms ever. It was deeply overlooked by the academy and critics when it should earned nominations and other accolades. The first season has several memorable episodes like the ""watchtower"" where Eric walks in on his parents having sex. One of the best and most memorable episodes in the first season.

There are plenty of other episodes like when President Ford comes to Point Place. The episode especially the scenes where the cast reenact the famous last supper scene in the cafeteria or the lightbulb a over their heads. I also enjoyed the episode where Kitty and Red end up at Phillies in the classic picture scene.

Guest stars include Marion Ross (Happy Days) as Red's mother and Katey Sagal (Married with Children, Sons of Anarchy) as Hyde's mother; Eve Plumb (The Brady Bunch) as Jackie's mother; Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Third Rock from the Sun) as Eric's new best friend; and more.

On three DVDs, you see all of the twenty five episodes with a couple of extras. The cast was first rate and the ensemble was impeccable. The casting and writing were perfect and under-appreciated by the television academy. The ensemble was first rate with a great cast. Too bad about Lisa Robin Kelly who passed away too young. You know that you never see her in any of the DVDs from the entire series. It's a shame because she was very talented but had her own demons.",1471824000,,1403,4.672064777327935

2114243,5,B0002PYS5G,"This series set in the late seventies is still one of my favorites to watch repeatedly. There was a lot of heart, warmth and soul in this series. Each and every character was developed to believable and relatable. I am enjoying watching Eric Forman mature into a young man. This Fox series never got the accolades that they deserved. Everybody in the cast should have earned Emmy nominations. The writing was always crisp, smart and clever. I enjoyed the fantasy sequences involving music, satire of seventies culture, and imagination. There are not that many series who do that today.

The Formans are the typical nuclear family with a father Reginald ""Red"" Forman (Kurtwood Smith); mother Kitty Sigurdson (Debra Jo Rupp) and their two teenage children, Laurie and Eric. Laurie (Lisa Robin Kelly) is away at college while Eric (Topher Grace) is home.  His friends include Stephen Hyde (Danny Masterson); foreigner Fez (Wilmer Valderamma); and Michael Kelso (Ashton Kutcher). Eric likes the neighborhood girl, Donna Pincinotti (Laura Prepon) who happens to be a feminist and aspiring writer. His friend Kelso is interested in Jackie Burkhart, a cheerleader and rich kid in school.

The Pincinottis had Bob and Midge in the beginning of the series. Don Stark and Tanya Roberts played Bob and Midge to perfection. Unfortunately, Tanya Roberts left the series due to her husband's terminal illness. She would return later on in the series. Unfortunately, Lisa Robin Kelly had personal problems and left and return to the series and left again before the end. She sadly passed away from a drug overdose.

The series poked fun at life in America in the late seventies. The series had several well known guest appearances like Marion Ross playing Red's difficult mother; Tom Poston and Betty White playing Kitty's parents; Mo Gaffney as Joanne; Brooke Shields as Mrs. Burkhart; Jessica Simpson; Erika Christensen, Andrea Bendenwald, Roger Daltrey CBE, Jamie Farr, Seth Green, Fred Willard, Tim Reid, Howard Hesseman, Eve Plumb, Valerie Harper, Mary Tyler Moore, Tommy Chong as Leo, Danny Bonaduce, Mike Gaffigan and others.

2114262,3,B0002PYS5G,"This is one of my favorite shows and it's nice to have them all in one small container instead of the old DVD packs I own.

For the Bluray, the episodes go from ""wow, that's clear"" to ""what's this blurry mess?"" in the same scenes which is really distracting to watch and pop out like a sore thumb. If you look close on some scenes, there's a tone of noise going on in the background and around edges of clothes and jewelry. The noise also looks like problems with deinterlacing. I don't know if that's an artifact from the original being NTSC and this is a 24fps transfer. I thought they were remade from the original film so I don't know where deinterlacing artifacts would come in.

There are quite a few things I noticed on the first and second season BluRays. Some are from the source material and some are maybe from the transfer.
- In the first episode (s1e1) when the kids are getting the car repaired and they're discussing who should give up their tickets, there's a scene where Hyde, Forman and Fes are out of focus, which you don't notice so much at SD or 480p. It looks like the camera was focused on the tires in the background more than it was on the actors. This is a source material problem which would be hidden more at a lower resolution.
- In episode 3 (s1e3) when Forman is about to streak there are scenes in slow motion and all those scenes have lights flickering. I'm not sure if this is a source material or transfer problem, but I don't remember ever noticing it in the broadcast or on the DVD, so I think some post-processing can be done to reduce or remove this.
- When Red is talking to his co-workers in the second season (s2e2) it keeps going from clear to noisy & blurry. It appears that they were shot wide and the zoom was done by zooming in to the film negative in editing. A lot of scenes in many episodes have this kind of thing. Which is all fine at SD, but looks very blurry and grainy when the previous cut was sharp.",1465776000,2,1956,4.269541778975741

2114280,5,B0002PYS5G,"Finally, 'That '70's Show' is given a release worthy of it.  The detail on the episodes is extraordinary, with the colors popping and the overall clarity of every scene unmatched by previous releases (or even most broadcasts).  The widescreen transfers are perfect.  Some have said that the show is 're-cropped' to simulate widescreen but this is not so.  Just look at the opening titles while the characters drive in their car - you can see beyond the car doors to the background beyond.  If this were cropped that wouldn't exist.  Plus, having owned several seasons on DVD I can tell you that there is definitely more picture on the screen, not less.

The extras are fun, with all those from the DVD boxed set ported over.  Plus we at last get 'That '70's Bloopers' episode (although this is not widescreen but in SD, it's still great to have).

The only slight negative I see is that the discs are placed unprotected in their respective cardboard season-holders.  Be careful pulling them out and putting them back in.  You might want to invest in some protective sleeves to go in there.

All in all this was an excellent purchase for me.  The price is very good considering how much you get (all 8 seasons plus the bonus stuff).  I've seen many, many shows of only a few seasons going for much more so this is quite a bargain.  So disconnect your princess phone, unplug the 8-track, stretch out in your bell-bottoms and enjoy 'That '70's Show'!",1461888000,5,1447,4.641732283464567

2114329,5,B0002PYS5G,"That 70s Show: The Complete Series (DVD)
By: bnperry

That 70s Show: The Complete Series is a must have for all That70s Show fans out there.  This set includes all 200 episodes from all eight seasons of the show on DVD.  Also included in this box set are hours of bonus features including: behind-the-scenes webisodes, a trivia game, and flashback featurettes.  The total run time of all the episodes and bonus features totals to approximately 74 hours and 37 minutes.

This show was very popular in its original run on television.  Though the show is set in the 1970s, the decade is just a backdrop for the show.  The episodes deal with regular coming of age situations that you can relate to, no matter what decade you grew up in.  It is also fun to see the little homages the show pays to the 1970s.  From the interior design, the outfits, the magazines, to the toys, there are pieces of the 1970s all through the show.

One thing that you should be aware of when purchasing this set is the quality of the discs.  The quality gets progressively better through the seasons, but the first two seasons can be a little fuzzy and grainy.  The episodes are still hilarious though.

A second thing that can be a little problematic with this box set is the packaging.  The outside case is very nicely designed and gives a good look at the cast.  Inside the case, all 24 discs are in individual paper sleeves and are stacked on top of each other in one big pile.  This can make it difficult to get to a disc of one of the later seasons.  You have to take all the discs on top of it out to get the disc you want, and if you want to keep your discs in order you have to dig through the pile a second time to put the disc away.  Though this packaging can be a little difficult, it does keep the discs nicely protected from scratches and breaking.

This show is a great show to watch for any older teenager or adult.  You cannot help but laugh at the hilarity that ensues in every episode.  Even though the main cast consists of nine actors, each actor brings something special to the show and the show would not feel complete if even one of them were missing.  As you watch the show, you will start to identify the characters with people in your life.  This box set is definitely worth buying.  You will be able to connect with these hilarious characters whenever you want.",1455840000,,2364,4.356979405034325

I'm giving 4 stars because when I contacted the company about the distorted picture I never heard back. It was just coincidence that I ended up using the Xbox and found out what the problem was.

2114353,3,B0002PYS5G,"First, this is one of the funniest shows ever made which earns it five stars.  However, it looses 2 starts for the following reasons: 1) The quality of the DVD image is poor with 200+/- minutes on each disc.  2) The box with loose sleeves is horrible; throw it away and put the discs in a book.  3) No subtitles; would be nice to know what Fez actually says.  4) I believe the episodes on the third disc are out of order.  But hey, what can you expect for about $1 a disc.  It is still one of the funniest shows ever!  Even with these shortfalls, I would recommend the DVD collection to anyone on a budget and everyone who wants to laugh excessively for more than 74 hours!",1451520000,2,673,4.170542635658915

But if its half way like this show I wish I was born ten years sooner!! I love this show have since I saw the first episode, the characters are great there isn't one I don't like. Its funny even after watching it as many times as I have. I saw the guy that plays Red Foreman in the first Robocop movie and couldn't believe it was him!! I have always loved Debra Rupp she is funny in everything she does. And each one of the actors that plays the kids is funny in their own way. All the characters are great!! Watching Tommy Chong play Leo is just  a bonus! If you want to watch a funny Tv show, Watch this one!! You will not be disappointed!!",1451260800,,772,3.948717948717949

2114359,4,B0002PYS5G,"While I do like this set as it's the best way to watch the show in widescreen & in mostly HD, there are a few cons:
-Some episodes feature Standard Def scenes mixed with HD scenes, so it will go back and forth in HD to SD, it's a little distracting but happens a few times.
-The musical episode is standard def, not one scene is in HD. Which should have been noted on the packaging.
-Season 6 episode 1 is sped up so it has a high pitch tone to the audio and is a little distracting

also all discs say ""EPSIDODE SELECT"" instead of ""EPISODE SELECT""

This is a little messy set but it's worth the low price tag of $60",1450742400,6,616,4.0

2114367,5,B0002PYS5G,If you came here you most likely are a fan of the show and so I'll spare you what it's about as that can be found on various other reviews here and elsewhere. Each season is presented on 2 50 gig Bluray discs as opposed to the individual releases of Seasons 1&2 that came out prior which were on 4 25 gig Bluray discs. The price for the set is great at $69.99. The main attraction for the purchase is the show being in 1080 HD Widescreen. From what I gathered the show was originally filmed in widescreen so there's no loss in what you see in the picture viewing area as you gain what you didn't see in the full-screen presentation. After watching the first few episodes I can see a huge jump in quality. It's worth picking up even if you have the prior DVD set.,1448236800,3,762,4.155405405405405
2114368,5,B0002PYS5G,"One of my favorite shows, So of course I had to get this now that it's finally all out on blu-ray.
Only Con:
The box is nice but theres 2 blu-ray discs that come in 1 sleeve, 1 on each side, per season. The only reason I don't like that is because I have to actually grab the disc and put a little effort to take it out which I don't like. I like the whole grabbing the discs by the edges and the discs being in those basic cases that the disc snaps in. I just hope in time it doesn't fade or rip by accident. Other than that. I love that they finally put the whole thing on blu-ray and the case shouldn't stop you from buying this great show.",1447804800,,643,3.878787878787879

2114370,5,B0002PYS5G,As described.perfect,1447718400,,20,9.5
2114371,3,B0002PYS5G,"So, a friend of mine told me about this show.  That is when it was first starting.  I did not like it at first.  Then, I got into it.  Oddly, the guy who told me of it would stop me from watching the end of it.  I was getting in his car one night and he took off.  Out I feel.  I died a bunch of times and was in a coma for 6 weeks.  When I finally got home, I don't even think I watched TV.  I remember that I liked the show and told myself that when it came out in a series set, it would be mine.  I already have the stash box version of this on DVD.  I got the blu-ray set a few days ago.  Here is my review.

It comes in a nice neat little box.  The front has their faces with this cool fuzzy feeling stuff all around.  I like textured things.  Since of that is the thing that has the disc s in it.  It is a black case with picture of various cast members on all four sides.  It feels sturdy enough.

This set has all 200 episodes on 18 discs.  Well, 16 I think.  Two are special features discs.  The discs are in the worst type of setting though.  They are just slid into the little cases.  Each case is a season.  Two discs.  If these were DVDs, they would more than likely be destroyed.

Each of the little things that are the season disc holders has pictures of the cast.  They are all different.  The little cases are very colorful.

Season one has 25 episodes and runs for a total of 9 hours and 24minutes.

Season 2 has 26 episodes and runs for 9 hours and 38 minutes.

Season 3 has 25 episodes and runs for 9 hours and 15 minutes

Season 4 has 27 episodes and runs for 9 hours and 56 minutes

Season 5 has 25 episodes and runs for 9 hours and 6 minutes

Season 6 has 25 episodes and runs for 9 hours and 5 minutes

Season 7 has 25 episodes and runs for 9 hours and 8 minutes.

Season 8 has 22 episodes and runs for 7 hours and 58 minutes.

As for the bonus discs, which there are two of, this is what you get.

Disc 1, making of featurettes (go behind the scenes to learn how the series is taken from page to broadcast), season overviews (recap each season with 8 special super trailers showcasing the gang), 70s flashbacks (join cast members as they take a look back at the decade that changed the world), that 70s blooper special (enjoy these hilarious outtakes with the cast and crew)

Disc 2 interactive trivia game (test your 70s knowledge in a new interactive HD game), groovy green screen watch the 70s inspired character transitions come to life), the fotohut (burn through a huge stash of photos from the archive), promo spots (over an hour of original promos).

All right, I wanted to see what the audio sounded like and what the video looked like.  Good news and bad news.  The audio sounded great.  I was happy to hear the theme song sound as well as it did.  As for the video, it just looks awful.  It is grainy and just looks bad.  I mean, I was sitting about two feet from my TV.  Everything has like dots on it.  It is for the fact, I am guessing, that they can only do so much from the original version.  As I said, I have the stash box version as well.  Ive yet to watch anything from it.  So, I really cannot compare it.  But it is kind of a letdown.

So, while it is great to have this on blu-ray, in such a cool looking package, that also feels well made, I am a bit let down.  First, I kind of feel like, if they are releasing this on blu-ray, they should load the hell out of it with special features.  Yet, we get two blu-rays worth.  I am sure that stuff is great.  But come on, could they not have done more?  Then, the video is really bad looking.  I am sure they did what they could.  But, it seems to me, if you can only get the original video looking to a specific point, then maybe DVD should be the only thing you do with it.  I am happy to have gotten this set.  But, after examining more into what I get and the quality, I sure am glad I got it when it was on sale.  It is for those two reasons that I give this set a three out of five.",1447632000,2,3982,3.960759493670886

2114379,5,B0002PYS5G,"Could this BLU-RAY set have had additional extras and is it missing some things in some peoples eyes? Yes! Although for me, there is enough here and the set is pretty cool looking, especially for the price point. The outside sleeve has a felt feel to it just like you would see if living the in the 1970's. After the sleeve comes off, the case opens up to each separate season. Each season feels as if you are pulling out a record to put on a record player. It's actually pretty cool looking and a nice look for the set. As far as the BLU-RAY's PQ and AQ this is the best release ever and you won't find better as of the year 2015. I don't see another release being done on this series but I guess it's always possible. For now, this is the only definitive collection to have if you are a fan of the series.

2114440,3,B0002PYS5G,"This is one of the funniest shows TV ever had.  A big hit for FOX back in their beginning days as a newtwork.  I remember those days like it was yesterday, and this show lets me relive those great times over and over.  The cast was perfect, the characters were perfect, the style and language was perfect for that era....  it's as if the show was actually made in the late 70's.  I liked that no one person was the star.  The entire cast were equal starts and shined brightly in their own ways.

I am reviewing the latest edition of the complete series package from Mill Creek Entertainment.  The packaging is horrible.  Each disc is in little paper sleeves and the discs all have tiny little scratches on them.  Fortunately they do not hurt the disc from playing normally.  But I am more disappointed with how the shows were transfered to the discs.

That 70's Show was produced in full stereo sound from the first episode through the entire 8 seasons.  Seasons 1 through 5 were originally done in the old 4:3 screen ratio, and seasons 6, 7, and 8 were done in full widescreen 16:9.
Season 1 and 2 on these discs are not in stereo sound.  Season 3 has most of the episodes in stereo, but there were a few holiday shows done in widescreen that were not in stereo.
Season 4 and 5 have some shows in stereo but most are not in stereo.
Seasons 6, 7, and 8 are all in widescreen 16:9 and many are stereo but have poor quality audio.  They sound like someone turned down the treble control a little to low, but they are fairly clean if you just use the sound from the little TV speakers.  And most of season 8 is not in stereo.

Mill Creek did very sloppy transferes at their factory in China.  I love the series a lot and all of the shows are watchable and clean looking.  So I will keep the series,  But I am very disappointed in the sound as I have a nice home theater system and like hearing the shows in surround sound.  But that is not possible with this package from Mill Creek.  I will just watch and listen to the series through the little TV speakers.  The sad part is I can watch this series on the FX TV network and they are all in top stereo sound quality.  So why couldn't Mill Creek do the same thing with this package deal?",1431820800,3,2234,4.226950354609929

Sound is incredible too, I love the attention to detail on the disc artwork which features the actors Ashton Kutcher (as Kelso on Disc 1) Mila Kunis (as Jackie on Disc 2) Danny Masterson (as Hyde Disc 3) and Wilmer Valderama (as Fez Disc 4). This is a really consistently funny show the episode where Red and his wife Kitty Forman go to a party hosted by his old war buddy played by Mitch Pellegi (AD Skinner from The X Files another Fox show) only to shockingly discover they are at a swingers party was hilariously funny. That scene had me in stitches I kept rewinding it it was that funny, extras are very good, only gripe I have about them is that they seem to be framed by set of flowers which is stupid as it makes the image look small when really you should be able to see the whole frame.

2114656,1,B0002PYS5G,"This set (referring to the actual one pictured above, and not any of the other That 70's Show box sets which are apparently fine) is a piece of garbage. Do not buy it. Do not let your friends buy it. Use a 10 foot pole to hit the back button on your browser and find a different version of this show. That 70's Show is a fantastic show, but the person/people who put this package together seem to actively hate the consumers who might be dumb enough to buy this box set.

This set has the feel of a shoddy bootleg. The discs are housed in paper(?!) sleeves, and every single one of them bears at least some level of scratching and scuffing. All in all, 5 of the 24 discs have multiple episodes (13 episodes in all) which won't play in any player or on my HTPC. Not only that, but my copy of Season 7 Disc 3 is actually a mislabeled Season 6 Disc 3, so I have two S6D3's and no S7D3. If you're the sort of person who would like to see every episode of this show (and by looking at this review, I'm assuming you are) do not buy this set.

Not only are the discs themselves of extremely poor quality, the audio and video on the discs that do work is very hit and miss. Some of the discs are clearly not de-interlaced, and you see jagged lines all over the screen. When the video isn't jagged, it suffers from the blockiness you see in a poor dvd rip. The audio levels may vary greatly from episode to episode as well, sometimes sounding like the characters are speaking into tin cans. This is without question the poorest quality I have ever seen in a commercially available DVD product. I can't believe they actually charge money for this. Bittorrent and a DVD burner can easily produce a better set than this....not that I recommend it. It's illegal. Anyway, buy the seasons individually and avoid the regret.",1400544000,8,1808,4.299120234604105

2114678,4,B0002PYS5G,"So, I was very wary because of all the negative reviews, but I decided to take a chance on this boxset anyway.

So here's what I got in the mail: The set comes in a large, plastic DVD box. When I opened them up, all 24 discs were stacked up on top of each other in individual paper sleeves, held in place by this square-shaped plastic thing on the inside. I checked each disc individually for the infamous scratches so many reviews talked about and there were none. I've watched about 4 or 5 of the discs so far and have had no problem with skipping, freezing, the sound was fine, the picture looked fine. Trying to get the DVDs out of the plastic holder thing inside the box can be a bit of a pain, though.

So while I do agree the packaging isn't the greatest, I'm personally satisfied with my purchase. For only $32, I feel this was a pretty great deal.

As for the show itself, it's a great show! If you're looking for something fun to watch, then this is definitely for you!",1395705600,68,979,4.224598930481283

The box itself is nice, in perfect condition, just not a collectors edition type set.  The discs are in individual sleeves.  For me though, I could care less how the discs are packaged or look on a shelf....I just want the content, the shows.
All of the discs are in pristine condition, they all work and play as any DVD should. Excellent quality, and price...not to mention it doesn't take up an entire shelf.",1394755200,3,669,4.533333333333333

Though the show started with a lot of '70's jokes, it is the characters that you come to love that really sell this as one of the better sit-coms in recent memory.  The last season without Topher Grace and Ashton Kutcher definitely struggles but is still worth watching.

2114758,3,B0002PYS5G,"it seemed like this set was ripped from the dvds already available, not that that's totally a bad thing, but with blu ray they should rescan the original to give us the more lines of resolution. While that is an issue with me, I will add that the colors (as the 70s were very colorful...good or bad, you decide) look great. but they looked the same on the dvd. and it may have been me but the audio on the menu screens seemed way too loud. blu rays usually are pretty even and sound great. The episodes themselves sound fine, but it's very irritating when you go to the menu and it's blaring. While I give this item 3 stars The show itself is worth 5 stars, but as an upgrade from dvd I can't really recommend it. I think there is a set of all the seasons called the secret stash or something to that effect, with the extras you get it may be better to just find that somewhere.",1387238400,4,878,4.140350877192983

2114776,5,B0002PYS5G,If your a person who enjoys comedy then this is the show for you. This show was probably one of the best and funniest of all time! well at least in my book it is. They could not of found a better cast for this show. Every actor plays their role extremely well and the characters are all unique in their own way. There literally isn't one show that disappoints me in the entire series except the finale episode of course. I was really hoping for many more seasons and episodes to come but as they say all good things must come to an end. This show is extremely hilarious and the more you watch the episodes the funnier it gets. I would recommend this show to many of my friends and family that enjoy a good laugh. I have watched every episode on Netflix and feel compelled to let others know the comedy filled show is a must have to own. The only thing I did not like is when they had to end the show after 200 episodes. It did have 8 successful seasons after all but I felt it could of definitely had a better ending. All in all this show is awesome to watch in your spare time although I'm not sure it is suitable for all audiences as it has some very wild humor if you know what I mean.,1386115200,,1188,4.059574468085106

I hope this helps anyone who is wanting to purchase this series.,1384992000,12,408,4.1125
2114781,5,B0002PYS5G,"I never watched the show when it was in prime time.  I starting catching episodes now and again in 2013 and could easily relate to the characters.  And I was happy going to bed with a smile on my face.  I  was going to college on the GI bill when this program plays out in the late 1970s.  I can dig all the scenes in the basement filled with smoke and some of the parties. My dad was somewhat like ""Red"".  He had expressions other than what Red said but similar in nature. One of the expressions Donna uses that my father used was ""Get Bent"". And I still use it today.

The chemistry between the actors is amazing.  Better then ""Seinfeld"" and ""Friends"".  These actor kids actually grew up together on the show which helped develop the characters.  The first two seasons did not have the spontaneous one liners as in later episodes.  The lines seemed a bit slow as though they were waiting for a cue from off stage.  But that doesn't mean it wasn't great.  I'm up to season 6 and it just gets better and better.  I think the characters that really made the show for me were Donna, Jackie and Hyde.  Of course I'm partial to redheads"".  The weakest character of the 6 kids for me was Eric.  I know it's a sitcom but his ""on line answers"" are just not what you would expect out of real life although funny.

The worse part of this DVD set is the fake audience laughter and reactions.  It becomes annoying after 3 or so seasons.  In earlier seasons the real audience responses are much easier to absorb.  But I believe this DVD set over shadows the fake audience responses.  Other than that I highly recommend this set for good time laughs and enjoyment especially if you lived through the 1970s as a teen or going to college.  The price is right and the number of DVDs is incredible.

I just completed the last three seasons since the partial review I left in Nov.  Each DVD is loaded with episodes and some have bonus features such as TV promos, director or actor commentaries.  I was very happy to see that foul language was rather limited and that regular cigarette smoking was eliminated. In the last season the word F*** was introduced by one of the characters and used a few times.

The ""dream skits"" and ""imaginary thoughts"" from the characters are great.  They play them out well such as in the Wizard of Oz. The home town is in Wisconsin, which I was surprised that there were not more winter wonderland scenes and very little holiday episodes.  But that is a moot point.  The entire box set is great and when I finished the last episode I was very sad thinking that I would not be with my friends any longer. Just like leaving my old neighborhood and college.

Now for some you dumb a**es out there who are doing reviews do a review about the box set or quality of the show. Something tangible rather that your order was delayed or the box was torn during shipment.  Get it right, or you'll have my foot up your a**.",1384905600,,2924,4.347504621072089

2114785,1,B0002PYS5G,"Amazon has combined the blu-ray and DVD reviews. There are is no option for separate entries for blu-ray and DVD, only one review category for both. (Skip to last paragraph for Season 8 show-content review.)

This review is for the 24-DVD Complete 8 Seasons set (not the Blu-ray). When I bought it is cost $32 (it has 3 DVDs per season).  I've read previous reviews that said the DVD's were scratched by the packaging.  The DVDs I got were not scratched, but they behave as if they were.  I purchased this set because the previous seasons 1-7 which I own were getting worn. I needed to replace a disk in season 3 that had been stolen, so I had planned to buy season 3 and season 8 (which I had not yet seen). I saw that this set all 8 seasons would costs about the same as just the other two alone, so I bought it!

I was sorely disappointed.  Firstly, some other reviewer said that due to scratches a lot of season 3 did not play.  My disks do not have scratches, and a lot of season 3 does not play.  Also the only other season I've watched on this set was season 8.  On season 8 there were places on most episodes were presumably digital error caused small freezes or missed small bits as unplayable bits were jumped over, but the episodes were at least viewable. I played these on a portable Philips DVD player.  It plays most everything I put in it.  However, on rare occasion I will get a DVD from the rental store that is damaged enough that it will not play on my player.  Sometimes a damaged disk that won't play on the player will  play on my computer. The computer is more friendly about skipping over damaged parts.  I tried season 3 on the computer, and the episodes were almost entirely unplayable there too.  Of this set I have only watched seasons 3 and 8 (or to be accurate ""I tried to watch"" ).  If you have a really expensive (i.e. more forgiving) DVD player you may get better results on it, I don't know.  That's my theory on why there are not more bad reviews for this product.

It seemed to me as if, in order to save money and get each season on three disks instead of four, perhaps they used less memory than the regular disks use?  I reason this, because the other versions I own (with the four disks per season),  have a fuller sound than these do. I can only reason that perhaps the good reviews come from people who might have more expensive DVD playing systems that are perhaps built to correct for scratches and poorer disk quality?  Some (not all) of the spots on season 8  that got jumped over on my Philips DVD player did play on my computer,  NOT SO for season 3.  To me this set was a total waste of money.

Now for my season 8 review, what I saw of it.  I'd never seen season 8, and had read so many reviews saying it is a waste and not true to the show. However,  It rocked!!.  It was great.  It was one of the better seasons in my opinion. My other favorite being season 3 (which is why  it needed replacing season 3 disk 3 was in a DVD player when it was stolen).  Season 3 disk 3 (of the four disk set) contains the Caroline episodes. Which, speaking of Caroline, was the one thing I didn't like about season 8, is that they made Caroline too over the top which detracted from the real psycho we know and love. Sad. The new guy however, was very plausible, and fit the show, he was a little more along the sidelines, and that worked.  A lot of changes happened, and that may be what bothers those who don't like it.  However, there are a lot of changes in most of the seasons, and my feeling was these changes told the story of the growing up of the group, while being very true to the spirit of the show.  I put in in my top three favorite seasons.

Good luck, I hope this review helps you.",1381881600,65,3732,4.1865357643758765

2114789,1,B0002PYS5G,"I bought this when I found out it was going to be taken off Netflix. Horrible packaging,  the collector box for the disks was broken when I opened it. The plastic was broken and cut me as I opened it. This could have easily been avoided if it was shipped in a cardboard box, but it isn't,  it is just shipped in a paper envelope with no bubble wrap or anything protecting it.

I decided not to deal with the hassle and just keep it and a bunch of the disks don't even work. Almost all of season 2 skipped through as if it were scratched, but it's not so there is no way to fix it.

I thought I would save money by buying the whole series, but it is not worth it. Buy them separately. It is frustrating to say the least. It is free shipping for a reason.",1381017600,8,753,3.966887417218543

So when I saw that this was on Amazon a few months later it was a must buy for me. The quality of the picture on the discs is outstanding.

The onlything that I don't like about this set is how the DVDs are placed in there. Instead of having a case where the DVDs snap into place, there are little paper/plastic sleeves to put them in. Which if you don't be careful you could loose a few discs.",1380758400,3,624,4.024193548387097

This rating is stricly for the packaging which is HORRIBLE.  The worst I've seen and really really surprised that Amazon would distribute.  I don't have the specific number of discs, let's say for arguments sake 26, included in the ""Complete Series Set"", but each disc comes in a black rough recycled paper cover smashed one on top of the other in a box.  So let's say you wanted to watch midway through the series, you'd have to plow through the discs to find your selection.  I could have made a nicer package with some scrapbooking paper and a glue stick, maybe I will!  If you are looking for a nice keepsake, look for something else.",1378944000,9,767,4.554744525547445

All the discs come in little paper envelopes, and they are all stacked in the middle. So, instead of like other box sets I own, instead of flipping through discs and each having their own section, they are all just stacked together. Whatever, it's about $25, you get what you pay for right? Well, this cheapness WILL scratch discs. Now, so far I haven't had any issues, but I did check every disc once I received it and did notice some had scratches. So, this is a cautionary review. I don't know how bad it can get but if you can get past the shoddy packaging and have something that can take care of minor scratches then it is worth the money. If not, then I would just recommend Netflix.

2114817,4,B0002PYS5G,"My middle and high school years were not the best for me. I was incredibly awkward and had a limited selection of friends come and go up to my Senior Year, where I felt I found my place. That 70's Show consisted much of my middle school years. I would watch reruns every night and chat about the show with my friend at lunch. It was really easy to get into and follow along with the simple stories and characters. This show was relatable and appealed to my young heart. Oh I would have done anything to live back in the 70's and have a gang of friends like this. But things do change over time. No longer do I catch this on television everyday but save the DVD's for long car rides or long summer days.

I own a few seasons on DVD but Season 1 is really the only one that I will watch, maybe along with Season 5, my second favorite season. I really feel like this show was our Happy Days. It started out a promising situational comedy with some nostalgia but slid downhill in quality right after the beginning. It works as a show about teenagers running into funny little problems but as it continued on the plots got stale and by the Season 8, it was an absolute mess that I like to pretend never happened. (Being a show we are free to do that... hehe.)

That 70's Show starts off presenting the gang. Eric (the good boy), Hyde (the bad boy), Kelso (the pretty but dumb boy), Fez (the perverted foreign exchange student) Donna (the girl next door), and Jackie (the cheerleader). They all follow simple stereotypes we have seen before but there is something strangely loveable about them. Eric and Donna's romance is interesting enough to follow, especially in this season, and Jackie and Kelso are humorous with their on and off relationship. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are absolutely adorable and one of the best side aspects of the show. Some other featured character's are Donna's annoying but good hearted parents and Eric's older sister. All what we would expect from a sitcom but nothing to complain about.

These Season 1 stories feel fresh, cute, and fun. They consist of many typical 70's culture such as Star Wars, disco, weed, Todd Rundgren, and feminism. The decade That 70's Show takes place in is the novelty of the program. Some of the episodes of this show still leave me feeling nostalgic and sentimental. My only real complaint is that the humor can be rather dumb and loud - but I do appreciate the creative imaginative dream sequences. It adds character to the show.

In conclusion, I really love this collection of episodes. The show did quickly go downhill, I will still watch the reruns for fun, but I will forever treasure the memories of this set. It has been interesting to catch on television after my introduction to Freaks and Geeks, a more recent show set in a similar time period, that handles the decade much differently. I appreciate both shows for different reasons. That '70s Show for sugar and fun and Freaks and Geeks for realism and maturity.",1373587200,4,2985,4.553072625698324

2114819,5,B0002PYS5G,"Even though I've watched repeat after repeat after repeat, I still LOVE That 70's Show!

The Show: All of the characters have great chemistry, they look their age & act how any kid from the 70s should act. Shows on TV lately aren't like this, the actors are always 5-10 years older than their characters & overall it's just not the same; I'm not saying everything is bad, there are some good ones, but overall it's different.

The DVDs: It was great watching this series again, I laughed just as hard the second time as I had the first, especially with some of the classics, such as, ""The Yard Sale"". There were a few episodes I hadn't seen before, so it was great to finally see all of them. The picture & sound quality is good!

The Package: I'm thrilled that the entire series is in one enlarged DVD case, what a space saver. The DVDs are all inside the box in their individual sleeves, my recommendation is to make sure you always put the discs back in the case in order to avoid a mix-up.

Overall: I'm so glad that I bought this, it was a great low price for the series & I couldn't go wrong. Highly recommend!",1373587200,,1116,4.3

It warms my heart to see my life again when I was young.  The producers of this show and the actors portraying these teens have done an excellent job of bringing me back to the past.

2114869,5,B0002PYS5G,"When I first heard the announcement of this release, I was immediately thrilled.  This opened up a new world of possibilities for a TV show collector such as myself.  I preordered it as soon as I noticed it was on Amazon.

Whereas many older TV series were shot in fullscreen, sometimes on videotape, That 70's Show was actually shot on film, in widescreen.  They just edited it to fullscreen for TV.  The public has never had the opportunity to see it like this before!  This is a show that we sometimes overlook when listing the great sitcoms of each decade.  Many forget that there was GREAT writing in this series - especially in the first three seasons.  I don't want to overstate it, but ""Eric's Birthday"", ""Career Day"" and season 2's ""Kitty and Eric's Night Out"" (which may be my favorite episode of ANY sitcom of all time) are SO GOOD, that I would put up against any other comedy - The Cosby Show, Seinfeld, Cheers, etc.

When I popped in the first episode, I was bit taken aback.  It didn't look great.  It was grainy, and there was a lack of consistency in the brightness.  Right away my heart sank in disappointment.  But the good news:  it's only like that for the first episode!!  Makes sense - it was the pilot, and maybe they didn't have the money at the time to make it look fantastic.  The rest of the episodes look crystal clear.  The widescreen is a great update, especially during dinner table scenes, where the extreme close-up shots get the characters really in your face, making it all the more hilarious.  The surround sound is great, too.

It's not very expensive, and yes, I did have the DVD, but personally, I'm glad that I made the upgrade.  It made me watch the season again from beginning to end, which I enjoyed thoroughly, and I enjoyed it even more in HD than I had in SD.  And my DVD copy?  I gave it to a teenager I know who has never seen it before, passing the proverbial torch to the next generation.  I haven't had a chance to watch the features yet, but it's good that it has all of the features from the DVD, plus new Blu Ray exclusives.

If I have one criticism, the volume for the menu (and the studio's logo sting before the menu) is WAY too loud.  I need to turn the volume down 50% each time I load it, or as an episode ends, or I will bother my neighbors.

Other than that, I would wholeheartedly recommend getting this.  Especially if you're like me - I was around the same age as the cast when the show first aired, so I when I watch it now, I get more out of it.  It's like going to Disney World as an adult - age and maturity give you a new level of appreciation.

Most of all, I thought it was important to purchase this collection because I want to encourage this and other studios to continue releasing older TV shows in HD.  As long as a show was shot on film like That 70's Show, the opportunity is there for a Blu Ray release, and as long as it's a show I love and the prices stay reasonable like this one, I'll keep buying them.",1336089600,5,2987,4.263345195729538
2114870,5,B0002PYS5G,"I'm not going to review the actual show- there's about a million other websites that are better for that. I'm going to focus on the quality of the BR transfer.

Overall, picture quality is excellent. Visuals are crisp and sharp. There's a little bit of grain in certain parts- but nothing out of the ordinary for a TV show. I can make out a lot of the finer details that I could not see with TV broadcasts (stitching on clothes, intricate detail on props, etc...). Audio is phenomenal with a 5.1 DTS-HD MA track (quite rare for a TV show circa 1999).

Don't pay any attention to the reviews saying picture quality isn't up to par. I own well over 250 bluray movies/TV shows. Considering how cheap the season costs, I'd say this is without a doubt one of the best blurays I've scored.

You can tell Mill Creek Entertainment really put some good effort into this release. I can only say that for about 25% of my bluray collection.

Looking forward to the rest of the seasons :)",1335052800,5,975,4.430167597765363

2114873,1,B0002PYS5G,"This series looked great when it debuted on DVD back in the last decade.  I've loved this show for years, and watch it regularly on reruns, in addition.  What they have done here, is repackage the ""HD"" transfers done for FX Network.  They have cropped a little off of the top of the picture, and a lot off of the bottom.  In some shots from the Pilot, in Eric's POV sequence, you can't even see the top of Bob's fro, which is the entire point of the gag.  I wish Fox had been more faithful to the creators, and kept the orignal 1.33:1 aspect ratio for SD television broadcasts.  Or even put both versions on the disc, it's only mega blu-ray storage.  Overall, extremely disappointed with this package, as it's the best season of the show IMO, crap presentation (yes the picture does look as nice as it did on FX but cropped).

But after watching it on blu ray I am blown away with how much time and effort was put into making a great show even better. You can read the games in the basement from a distance, you can read the warning labels off the water heater, I thought Hyde was wearing jeans in the pilot, it turns out they were stripped pants. Colors are brighter, the screen is clear and the detail is AMAZING! And that doesn't even cover the bonus disk with side by side comparison and other fun stuff. This is worth every penny, even if you aren't a hardcore fan, this is a must have for anyone. I cannot wait for season 2.

2114885,3,B0002PYS5G,"5 stars for the actual show which is one of my all time favorites and I highly recommend. I kind of grew up along side this show and it remains pretty much the only thing I can watch Ashton Kutcher in without instantly wanting to punch him in the face, so that must be saying something right there.

0 or 1 star for the packaging which is by far the CHEAPEST I have ever seen. Some might notice when searching that there are two versions of That 70's Show Season 1 (and Season 2 as far as I know): one for $15 and one for $40. Now you might be wondering why one is so much more than the other. Does anyone remember the little paper holders that computer restoration discs used to come in or that people made to hold CD's/DVD's because they were cheap and easy to make?? Well that is exactly why one is $15 full price, because the DVD case is simply a holder for these cheap pieces of paper. It's kind of sad that the company could have saved money and plastic by making the outer case smaller since it doesn't support any type of swivel/peg DVD holder and it is simply normal size to make you think you bought a normal DVD.

Basic rule of thumb in all my movie shopping is that the cheaper the price, the cheaper the packaging, and the higher the risk of the disc becoming damaged and needing to re-purchase it. This is especially true with movie bundles and TV series since the manufacturer can cram multiple discs into dirt cheap packaging.

I have also posted this same review for Season 2 because I was so surprised at how pathetic the packaging was when I bought the two seasons together.",1330992000,3,1593,4.285714285714286
2114886,5,B0002PYS5G,"They first wrote an EIGHT SEASON arc and STUCK to it.  In the real '70s sitcoms they rarely referenced past events and acted like each show was the first in the series.  This show would rely heavily on such references to the point that you HAD to follow it from the beginning to see how the kids grew and matured. Even the dumbest dill hole in Wisconsin, Mike Kelso, became a responsible father and they hinted that just MAYBE a responsible husband down the road.

Just when you thought there was  no hope left for Donna and Eric he quietly appears next to her on the hood of the famed 1969 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser as the '70s come to an end at midnight. It's all a little ""lady or the tiger"" but for the fans of  Eric and Donna as well as Fez and Jackie hope flickers. Even Steve Hyde becomes a responsible human being at the end.

But there are a few details I find impossible to overlook:

1. The laugh track is particularly grating. If you can ignore it, great. But once you realize it's there, you'll get a headache.

2. Sometimes they use slang that is much more modern than the 70's. Annoying.

3. This is unforgivable: Donna goes to Marquette and there are posters for the MU mascot, the Golden Eagles. I attended MU in the 1970's and our basketball team dominated EVERYONE ELSE....and we were the WARRIORS.  ""Golden Eagles"" is the new team name now that Warriors (and the little Willie Wampum avatar) have become un-p.c. But that's a recent change (and a dumb change: golden eagles are not indigenous to the Wisconsin area). So as a falconer AND a Marquette alum, shame on the producers.

So is ""That 70's Show"" really all that 70's? Maybe a little--if you turn the sound off and if college basketball is totally meaningless in your life. (Which probably means you attended a Loser school.)

The actors and characters are top notch (including appearances by some real A-List celebrities). The laughs just keep coming until the end credits. And we still don't know where Fez is from. Great show, if you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch it.

Now onto the packaging, which is no slouch in and of itself. The Ultimate Stash Box is a replica of the old 45 RPM record cases right down to the size and the boxes inside that hold each season. Each season comes in 4 discs with a total of 8 seasons. It's a pretty weighted box for 32 discs.

2114931,3,B0002PYS5G,"The packaging: very nice. It's organized very well, and the box is surprisingly durable. It's also a great space saver, as individual season box sets (1 - 8) would take up substantially more room than this all-in-one box set.

My one criticism of the packaging is that, included is the script for the last episode, which is bound with little brass rivets. The rivets unfortunately have a tendency to catch on the lip of the box when removing it or putting it back in. Also, the accompanying episode guide has a brown paper ""cover protector"" (like on high school textbooks) and that cover also has a bad habit of catching on the lip of the box, creating little tears. But these are minor inconveniences, and as long as you remember them, you can remove the items carefully and prevent any damage from being done.

I'm giving this 3 stars not because of the actual box set (which I was very impressed with) but because of the show itself. This show was a lot funnier when I was a teenager and I didn't yet understand all of the tired TV tropes that were used on this show - the token stupid foreigner, the token hot girl(s), etc. I loved the detail that was put in the show, especially how the sets were designed, and the guest stars they brought in (which were frequently 70's TV stars) was a great touch. I hate to say this, but it was the characters that spoiled the show for me; or rather, the main characters. Eric was too arrogant and treated everyone around him like some sort of servant; Michael was too stupid and slapstick to be likeable; Fez was less of a character and more just one long, racist joke; Jackie was just as annoying as Eric, but smaller in size; and Donna, like Fez, was less of a character and just one long, sexually-objectifying joke. Hyde was the only bearable character, and that's because he didn't have the requisite unbearably annoying personality ""quirk"" that every other character had. It was the supporting characters - the parents, basically - that were at all sympathetic as characters.

So I feel torn on the show, as I love the premise, and I greatly admire the detail that went into the show, but I felt so little empathy for the main characters that it was difficult to really engage with the storylines.",1304899200,3,2245,4.538271604938272

Plus, it was a little cheaper than buying each season separately. It took a little longer than usual to get here which sucked. The pictures don't really do it justicethough when you finally get it. The box looks awesome with the little pictures on it. And the cool thing is that they come looking like vinyl records. Each season is in its own little set, and then on the inside each disc is wrapped in a cardboard record cover, its so cool. And it also comes with like a replica of the script from the final episode signed by the cast. And there's this cool book that i think is supposed to be like a yearbook that has the cast and them talking about the show. And descriptions of each episode so it's easy to find which one you want to watch.

2114974,5,B0002PYS5G,"This show is so haliarious. When I first came into this show, I was eager to find it on DVD. This review is for the old box set and the new slim set.

The Boxed Set:
The Cover shows the cast in season one. The color of the set is yellow with 70s styled font. The inside has 4 different slim DVD holders with different cast pictures. The inside of the other cases inside all have more cast picutes. Each seperate disc has 2  cast members (usually the two that are on the front of the case) on them.
The special features are pretty good. This boxed set is very nice looking.

The Slim Set:
The front, back, features, discs, and colors are all the same. However, now you get a slim case, with clear plastic. It resembles a normal dvd case. There is hardly no interior artwork.

I would suggest that if you can get the boxed set get it. Mostly becaus eit looks nicer.

The box includes all of the episodes (of course), and the presentation is flawless. Each season is presented into a box resembling a worn-out 70's record album box.

The only thing I was a little disappointed was the amount of extra content. I was expecting a few more interviews with the cast, but all you get is director commentaries. Nonetheless, I think it's a great value for its price.",1277683200,,542,4.530612244897959

I was a child of the 60's and 70's and trust me,  the show is true to life!  The clothes,  the music,  the ""circle"".  Been there, done that and lived most of it and still able to tell it!  It is truly a blast from the past.  All the characters and situations are true to the decade,  quite enjoyable and ""highly"" (smile) recommended.

2115014,4,B0002PYS5G,"Like the characters in this show, I too was a teen during the 70s. The producers really nailed the whole zeitgeist, of being a suburban teenager in the 70s. The 70s fashions, cars, home furnishings, foods, and fads, are all very authentic in this show.

The show boasts a very talented ensemble cast, who all mesh together very well on camera. I really like the unique, psychedelic-style film sequences. No other show does camera tricks like this. These cutting-edge film sequences, really help to convey the campy hipness, that characterized the 70s era.

Overall this is a very funny sitcom. The one thing that bothers me about this show, is it's over-reliance on cruel humor, to generate laughs. In this way, I think that this show tries to be too much like Married With Children. While Married with Children is a great sitcom in its own right, it's tacky that the creators of That 70s show, keep trying to imitate it.

I do recommend That 70s Show, mainly due to it's nostalgia factor. It could be an even better show though, if the writers relied more on witty dialog, rather than bawdy, tasteless jokes and pranks.",1262044800,2,1120,4.704081632653061

2115020,5,B0002PYS5G,"This Giftset is great, it's tightly packed and takes up way less space than the regular Season DVD's. It doesn't include ""The Final Goodbye"" nor The Bloopers. It contains everything the regular DVD's had. Which is kind of disappointing. The show is hilarious, I've never laughed so much at a sitcom before. All the characters are great. The only thing disappointing with the series is Season 8. Without Eric and Kelso in the show it wasn't the same. It still had some very funny moments, but not enough. I didn't laugh like I did with the other seasons. Randy had only two or three funny lines. The series finale was good though. Hopefully they'll do a Re-union/movie/something else with That 70's Show somewhere down the road, it'd be great. It's one of the few sitcoms I really enjoy and can watch over and over again.

But this is a good set, All the seasons (1-8) all the extras from the older season dvd's, but in better packaging. (If it's too tight, I suggest putting the series finale script in Season 8, it makes it just tight enough, but still easy to pull the dvd's out.)",1254873600,3,1082,4.5487179487179485

If you began to watch the show in its later shows, this is also a nice way to ""catch up"" with where it all began.

2115040,5,B0002PYS5G,"This set is totally worth it. I sold off all my old individual sets to get this and it was so worth it. The box is incredibly well put together. I love the kitschy feel of it. The entire thing is made to resemble an old 45 record box and inside are all of the season sets in LP boxes. When you open up the boxes, the discs are housed in individual sleeves that resemble the old white record sleeves. There is also an awesome hardback (!) book with cast comments from the main crew and a synopsis of all 200 episodes. You also get a mini replica of the last script with (reprinted) signatures from the crew. When the box is all latched up, it fits quite comfortably on my bookshelf and takes up a lot less room than the individual sets. Plus it just looks totally awesome! This is most assuredly a must-buy for any fan of That 70s Show and for any fan of great tv. Oh, and thanks Amazon for the great Gold Box deal on it! Grab this one up today!",1238371200,,944,4.080645161290323
2115041,4,B0002PYS5G,"I was a slightly-more-than-casual fan of the show during its' initial run, but I phased out when the media decided to focus more on the antics of the celebrity cast members than the show itself (I call it the ""Friends Syndrome).

Amazon sold this collection for under $100 as a Gold Box Deal recently and it was too cheap to resist. After receiving the series and taking a good look at the packaging, I am glad I made the impulse purchase.

The box set itself is designed to look like a 45RPM Singles Box, complete with metal buckles on the sides to keep it ""locked"" and a plastic strap on top. The box is cardboard but the sides are printed with nostalgic-looking textured paper, complete with cheezy ""sticker art"" highlights. The front of the box has a plastic window that exposes the first season's promotional cover. All in all it feels solid and durable and MUCH higher-quality than I expected it to be in when I bought it.

Opening the box: each season has been sectioned off in individual boxes with promotional art on them. Each disc inside the box in in a paper sleeve that emulates the sleeves that you would keep your 45's in. Very well-done.

In addition to all 8 seasons, the box set also comes with a miniature yearbook-style retrospective (complete with doodled-on 'paper' slipcover) that pretty much sums up the contents of the box and covers your main characters' timelines within the series. The feeling of 70's nostalgia fades when you go from page to page inside the book, but I am being picky, and if the weakest element of the box set is that the interior of the supplemental booklet feels more 80's than 70's, I am digging pretty deep.

Finally, for some reason the box set includes a copy of the final script for the final episode of the show. They even went as far as to bind the tiny teleplay with brass rivets. The box advertises that this item is ""signed by the cast!"" which SOUNDS neat, but if you are looking for an actual penned autograph you are obviously out of luck. I'm not sure why they chose to include the FINAL script of the series (I would think that the FIRST episode might have been more interesting to read) but once again... I am probably looking for something to whine about.

All in all, I look forward to watching the entire series in-order and filling in the cracks where I tuned out during the show's actual run. I had considered getting individual seasons of the show in the past, as I am an avid collector of TV-on-DVD, but I never got around to it. I am very pleased that I waited as the kitsch value of this complete box set is so high. If you have the means and even a passing appreciation for the show, I recommend it.",1238112000,125,2673,4.456032719836401
2115042,5,B0002PYS5G,I waited for the boxset figuring it would be awesome. This set was beyond my expectations. The whole design is genius. You need to be careful with it though because it's not very sturdy but for a collector the album sleeves and doodling on the covers is truly timeless.,1238025600,2,269,4.510204081632653

But to summarize just in case, That 70's Show is a great show, a good 'sitcom' for lack of a better word, for the teens and young adults out there. It's funny and can be a family show between teens and parents. I hope you purchase this product.",1233446400,,513,4.298969072164948
2115054,5,B0002PYS5G,"I think That 70's show is very funny. It's a show that you'll love to watch over and over again because it is so funny and different. I just think Red is hilarious and every character adds a little something different to the show... Eric is the down to earth of the group, Donna is the sweet one and also the brains of the group, Kelso is the laughing stock of the group, Jackie is the all about me of the group, Hyde is the spacey one of the group, and Fez is the foreigner of the group and you can't forget about Eric's parents Kitty and Red.

I love that this show is in a cute little stash box that doesn't take up a lot of room on my dvd rack. If you are a fan of the show then I recommend that you add the complete series to your collection. There are some extras that come with the stash box including a collectible booklet and a series finale script that is signed by the cast.

Don't forget to check out Eric, Donna, Kelso, Jackie, Hyde, and Fez in this great new collecible set.",1233100800,5,988,4.061538461538461

2115057,5,B0002PYS5G,"I'm the perfect example of how this show is interesting to a wide range of people, regardless of their age. I was born in 1971, but actually ""grew up"" for the most part in the '80's. And I started watching this show in my latter 20's, yet I still connected with the kids of Point Place. I watched the show constantly from season 1 to about season 5 or 6, then getting a new girlfriend, I kind of quit watching and only watched most of the last few seasons after getting this box set. I'm surprised at how good the show is up until Eric and Kelso leave. I'm also surprised at how bad the last season is. And I know this is a sit com and the show never got too emotional or heavy throughout the entire run, but the last episode had the potential to be a real tear-jerker, but ultimately failed because they tried to still inject comedy here and there throughout the last half of the episode. Also, what was that nervous twitch that Fez started to have during the 8th season? That thing he did with his fingers? That 70's Show was in direct competition with Freaks And Geeks, both starting their runs at the same time. I like Freaks And Geeks a lot more, but I don't know why the shows were always compred to one another, they're entirely different shows. It was cool to see various cast members of Freaks And Geeks as guest stars on That 70's Show, though. Even though I didn't care for the last season or how the show ended, I still give this 5 stars because it was downright funny and brilliantly written for 7 seasons. In fact, the only episode I didn't like from the first 7 seasons was the musical episode.",1232323200,,1609,4.278688524590164
2115058,5,B0002PYS5G,"This show is awesome! Sure season 8 was a disappointment, but hey. It's not that bad. The funniest thing to do is to watch how the actors age through the show. Kelso (kutcher) gets more muscular, Donna goes blonde, Jackie (who started on the show at age 13) really grows into a woman, Fez gets a little thicker (he was so skinny when the show started). This is a show for all generations really. I was born in the 80's but the show holds easily identifiable themes for any decade. It's a lot how MASH was set in the Korean conflict, but it was a show about war universal. The box set is awesome. Each season comes packed in little cardboard LP boxes. A copy of the final episode's script and a book containing actor info and an episode guide is included. I highly recommend it.",1231632000,,777,4.328767123287672

2115063,5,B0002PYS5G,"I have to admit that I didn't really watch this show when it was on air, but just like most shows that I get into, it's when they are in re-runs.  I really got into this show when I started working at a TV station that aired ""That '70s Show.""  The problem was we nevered really aired all the episodes, so since getting the box set I started seeing episodes that I have never seen before and viewing the shows in the order that they originally aired, the shows make a lot more sence to me.  I find this box set to be exactly what I wanted when purchasing all the episodes.  I wasn't looking for a lot of thrills, just the DVDs containing all the episodes.  This box set is straight to the point and doesn't take up a lot of room on my DVD storage shelf.  I do find the interviews and the few extras very interesting and having a copy of the final script to the last episode was a nice little touch.  The only complaint I have is that the DVDs are packed a little to tight in the box.  Other than that I am very happy with this purchase and I would recommend this DVD box set to any person who is a fan of ""That '70s Show.""  My only question is what would have happened if the show went more than 10 seasons, because a decade is only 10, years long.  Just an after thought.

We were high schoolers in the same timeframe with the same group of personalities and somehow managed to survive to same ups and downs, trials and tribulations and joys, failures and triumphs, faced the same issues...very accurately portrayed. As an added bonus, Red Forman reminds me in many ways of my own dad, who sadly passed away in 1995, so I would have to say Red is my favorite of all the well-written characters on this gem.

I was a fan of this show from the first time it aired on network television and was a faithful viewer through every season.",1220659200,,635,4.619469026548672

2115066,5,B0002PYS5G,"I am about three years older than the kids portrayed in the series. Born in 1958, I learned to drive during the first gas shortage, and got my first post-college graduation job during the second gas shortage in 1979. The 70's were a truly dreadful time to be young - inflation, competing for after-school minimum-wage jobs with laid-off thirty-somethings, dreadful music, worse clothes.

The funny thing is, this series doesn't ignor any of that and still manages to make the 70's look fun, even for those of us old enough to know better. It manages to look the 70's directly in the face - complete with time-authentic clothing - and yet fill the show with the hopefulness of youth and the things that make the high school and college years both the best of times and the worst of times. Then there are the parents. The two young lovers in the show - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - truly have dreadful parents with the best of intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not exactly June and Ward although they are conventional for the decade. They represent what happened when the 60's finally reached the suburbs during the 1970's. Donna's parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960's to show up their whole lives in order to give their weirdness legitimacy. Eric's friends Fez, Kelso, and Jackie round out the group representing nerdiness, well-meaning incompetence, and snobbiness respectively. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a show about the suburbs, but he largely represents someone who has to play the cards he was dealt even when those cards are dealt by largely absentee and negligent parents. I highly recommend all eight seasons even though season eight does lag a bit due to the absence of Eric.",1215907200,30,1730,4.785953177257525

2115079,5,B0002PYS5G,"As a guy that graduated at seventeen in 1976 in a small town, I could so relate to very much of this very funny series. I didn't know anyone who was as promiscuous as the characters, or crazy enough to do things in their parent's houses while their parents were upstairs, but maybe that is because there aren't any basements where I come from. There were however lots and lots of parties.

The characters to me are amalgamations of people I knew. Almost every situation the group gets into, someone I knew managed to get into also.

So why is that so funny? Because it's good to look back at your own stupidity through the veil of years, enough time for it to be just funny and no longer painful.

Why does this show work for so many seasons? The cast has said it is because there is only one director for the whole series, making for consistent portrayal and story lines. The characters literally grow up on the show, though of course the weakness of any show about teens is that they try to have young looking adults play teens, it goes kind of sour by the end if you take things too serious.

So is a perfect show? Well not quite, the laugh track is annoying; the story is awkward the first season as the characters are being developed, like in ""Happy Days"" one sibling disappears after only one episode, in one season, (Like in ""Rose Ann"") a major character changes actresses, and changes back the next season, and by the last season the performances become stilted as the adult actors are getting too old to play the characters. Do any of those things keep my wife and me from watching the shows over and over? No they don't. We love this show and laugh every time.",1170979200,4,1670,4.394822006472492

2115081,5,B0002PYS5G,"I'm a pretty big fan of ""That '70s Show"". It's got some unique ideas, wacky humour, warmth and a great commeraderie between the cast. You can tell both the actors and the characters they play are friends. Though I didn't grow up during the decade, I like all things 1970s and enjoy seeing all the cultural references too.

The show, basically, is all about a group of teenagers living the 1970s in the fictional suburb of Point Place, Wisconcin. There's Foreman, the awkward and most mild mannered one, Donna, his pretty tomboy neighbour, Hyde, the rebellious one immersed in the counter culture of the time, Kelso, the handsome yet airheaded guy and his bossy girlfriend Jackie. There's also Fez, the misunderstood foreign exchange student. Together, they try and keep themselves amused. They hang around in Foreman's basement, they go out in Foreman's Vista Cruiser. They take a lot of advantage of Foreman, actually.

The first series is 25 episodes long, and is presented in this DVD set over four discs. It establishes the style and characters of the series, really well, I thought. Episodes within the series that are worth a mention include ""That '70s Pilot"", where Foreman first gets his beloved car, and the budding and breaking relationships are introduced, ""Streaking"", where the guys decide to streak at the Point Place stop of Gerry Ford's campaign trail, ""A New Hope"" where the gang all get to see Star Wars, which they start applying metaphorically to their life, ""Punk Chick"" where Hyde falls for a punk girl, ""Hyde Moves In"" where Hyde's mother runs off and he finds himself living a Foreman's house. A rather major plot point for the series, actually, as it changes the setup for the show a little.

All the episodes are great, though. It's fun, it's colourful, it's quotable, and it's interesting to watch the characters and relationships develop.

Special features include a featurette about the first series with interviews with the cast, a trivia feature, and a montage of TV spots.

For fans of comedy and of the 1970s, this is definitely worth a look. Recommended.",1155427200,,2088,4.920454545454546

2115083,4,B0002PYS5G,"That 70's Show was always clever even if it wasn't as funny as it thought it was in the first season. What kept the show going is that it got better and the cast has chemestry. It's funny that the show is still on though since it technically shouldn't be the 70's anymore. When the show started Eric (Topher Grace) saw StarWars and became a huge fan. So that would be 1977 and the show was on much longer than 3 years. They should be in the 80's by now lol.

  Also the show shouldn't even be on without Topher Grace. The first few seasons is a coming of age story about Eric and Donna, so who wants to see her with that new unfunny guy ?? The show should've ended once Topher left. Then Ashton Kutchner left as well thinking that he also has talent in hollywood. Topher is doing Spiderman 3 as a main villian and all Ashton is doing is making is bad comedies. So I could see why Topher left but not Ashton.

  The show still manages to get some laughs but with Topher gone the show has no soul left. It's lame how they hang-out in his basement still...when he's not even around. On  top of it Donna hangs with her new b/f in Eric's house and kisses him in front of Eric's mom. It should bug anyone who followed the show from the start. So although I always loved the show it shouldn't even be on anymore. You're better off just either buying the dvds of the earier Topher Grace seasons or just wtaching the re-runs on FX. From the start it was about Eric and Donna and now we have to suffer through Donna and....Randy ? Eric and Donna should've just got married...the end. The show has some life now but very little without Eric.",1146182400,7,1630,4.205128205128205

2115085,4,B0002PYS5G,"And nostalgia for the 1970s is in full swing. One could probably trace the nostalgia to the 1993 release of the movie ""Dazed and Confused."" Given the superb quality of that movie and the ensuing nostalgia for the ""me"" decade, it was inevitable that network television would attempt to cash in. The result was the superbly crafted ""That 70s Show."" Set in a Wisconsin suburb, T7S follows the life and times of Eric Forman, a high school junior. Though decade specific, T7S explores themes common to many adolescents: the first car, the first love, high school, overbearing fathers, overdoting mothers, overindulging, and underachieving.

The seasons progressed well and the show was at its zenith in seasons 2-4. That in and of itself speaks to the quality of the production and acting in that it is hard to maintain a peak for more than one season in episodic television and nearly impossible on a sitcom.

By season 5, the show started to lose some steam because the actors had all grown out of their roles: it's hard to play 19 forever.

As far as the DVD release is concerned, the episodes are all intact, but the music in many cases has been substituted. This is a disappointment, especially when one considers that Miami Vice in its first two releases went to the trouble of obtaining music rights to all its shows prior to the DVDs being burned.

For example: In the pilot for T7S, only one of the 6 songs used in the episode is utilized. As good as the show was on its own merits, this seriously detracts from the quality.

That being said, the show's writing and acting as well as the production and direction make the purchase worthwhile.

2115090,5,B0002PYS5G,"That 70's Show came out screaming at a point in my life when I needed it most. Eric Foreman and Donna Pinciotti, were my boyfriend, Terry and myself hanging out in the basement of his mom & dad's house with a variety of friends with personalities much like Michael Kelso, Steven Hyde, Jackie Berkhart, and Eric's naughty sister Laurie...Fez, however, did not exist but the rest of the first season was dead bang and more like a memory than a sit-com. In 1976, as the stage is set in season 1, I was 14 years old and seeing all the life-learning wacky, goofy experiences the characters live out is extremely humerous and more like a trip down memory lane.  Like Hyde, there was always somebody around with "" a whole big bag of love "". Without much more than Packman, pinball or foosball for entertainment, we had to change the channel on the tv by hand, too. The soundtrack of songs are true to the era, as well. I remember the drive-in theater, and my daughter, who is 20, only knows what a drive-in is from watching tv.  These are just a few examples but now that it's the end of 2005 and as the characters grow and change, NOW I find myself relating more to Red & Kitty ( Eric's parents ) and/or Bob & Midge ( Donna's parents )!!!  All I know is it's awsome to go back in time and experience the nostalgia and adolescent situations that bring back a time for me when things were so much simpler, the grass was greener and the sky so much more blue. With no disrespect intended for the rest of the season, which is so unexpected and fresh, I never fail to laugh no matter how many times I watch Season 1, disc 1, episodes 1 & 2, which are in my oppinion the VERY BEST of That 70's Show and the heart of what it was really like to grow up in the '70's!  :)",1134000000,33,1756,4.201780415430267

From Hyde moving in to Foreman's ""lost sister"", the parallels to 'Happy Days' are endless...yet this show is one of the greatest to come out and survive the nineties. Not only is the story great, thanks to geniuses Bonnie and Terry Turner, but the characters are so real and given so many emotional facets that even today, kids can relate.

Episodes from 'The Pilot' to 'Eric's Burger Job' showcase how generic the story can be, but how memorable they will always stand. 'A New Hope' brings in one of the best Star Wars homages, something almost mandatory in television sitcoms now a days. While 'The Prom Date' features some of the show's finest moments.

Eric Foreman is the youth today's Richie Cunningham, but he's also the youth of today's icon. He is everything any teen growing up can relate to and the writers, including the exceptional Topher Grace, carved him into such an interesting story.

'That 70's Show' is probably one of the greatest sitcoms to have ever come out, in my opinion. It's full of witty humor, snappy dialogue, and tongue in cheek scenarios that are both believeable and unreal.

2115093,4,B0002PYS5G,"""That 70's Show"" emerged on Fox in 1998 as an ensemble comedy set in Wisconsin in 1976.  As someone who was about the same age as the characters, in 1975's Minnesota, it piqued my interest and ultimately brought to America's attention as good an comedy cast as has been available in any sitcom in the last 20 years.  All 25 episodes, plus an overview are available on the DVD, but the makers were hoping against hope for another season, not realizing they'd made a franchise....thus the DVD extras for the first season are lacking.

The cast, all unknowns at the time, was refreshingly funny and eager to please.  Season One also had a number of cameos from past family sitcoms from the 70's (enter Danny Bonaduce, etc.).
Topher Grace and Laura Prepon, as Eric and Donna, are the most believable as young people who love each other.  Everyone else plays pure comedy, and their timing is delightful, particularly Don Stark and Tanya Roberts as Donna's parents.  The episode ""The Prom"" continuously tugs at your heartstrings and stands out as the best of the season.

What I also enjoy about this show is that when it comes to serious subjects, the writers are always careful to treat them lightly but with wit (Eric's father's unemployment and the death of Eric's grandmother).
Cultural references (especially to Woody Allen's early movies) are always greatly introduced, and again so funny.

2115098,5,B0002PYS5G,"I can still remember seeing ads for this show 7 years ago, and I can't believe that this show has been on that long.  Don't get me wrong, this show is hilarious, probably one of my favorite comedy shows (although based on what's out there, there aren't too many truly great comedies).  It's just that I never thought that a period show such as this could ever become so popular.

The show centers around Eric Forman (Topher Grace), a 17-year-old living in 1976 Point Place, Wicsonsin.  Eric, along with his friends Hyde (Danny Masterson) and Kelso (Ashton Kutcher), his best friend/girlfriend Donna (Laura Prepon), Kelso's on-again/off-again girlfriend Jackie (Mila Kunis), and a foreign exchange student nicknamed Fez (Wilmer Valderama) go around town in an Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser stopping at discos, hanging out at burger places, and going to see Star Wars.  Meanwhile, they try to avoid their quoirky parents.  Eric has Red (Kurtwood Smith) and Kitty (Debra Jo Rupp), two people who prove that there is truth behind the saying ""opposites attract"".  Red is short-tempered and conservative, while Kitty is a loving and passive woman.  And Donna has to deal with Bob (Don Stark) and Midge (Tanya Roberts).  Bob is an old-fashioned (read: somewhat mysogonistic) guy and Midge is a very dull (yet very attractive) girl who gets wrapped up in every fad just for the fun of it (she joins feminism groups to fit it, much to the chagrin of Donna, who truly believes in feminism and the Equal Rights Amendment).

The gang gets involved in a bunch of crazy situations, such as the time they decide to go streaking at a Ford for President rally, when they decide to throw a keggar in an empty swimming pool, their trip to Jackie's remote ski lodge, or their outing to a WWF match.  About half of the humor comes from the setting (there is a lot to poke fun at in the 70's), while the other half comes from the characters themselves.  Whether it be Kelso's stupidity, Jackie's shallowness, Red's curtness, or Eric's cluelessness, there's a lot of fun to be had with this group.

One of the cool things about this show was that a lot of big names from the 70's showed up to do guest spots.  This season, Danny Bonaduci shows up as Eric's boss in one episode, but as the seasons go on, we will be treated to Ted Nugent, Alice Cooper, and even Tommy Chong (who becomes a regular castmember).

This show is particularly strong for its first season; while it would go on to have some really great episodes, I had forgotten just how funny these early episodes were.  One of my favorite episodes of the series is ""A New Hope"", which is about the gang going to see Star Wars.  And while the show would definitely go on to become better, it was by no means bad this year.

As someone who's been a fan of the show since it came on, it was great to see the beginnings again, and to see how the show has changed.  While we get to see the origins of amazing running gags, such as the single camera panning around circular tables while characters were eating or ""relaxing"", we also get to see old gags that were discontinued at some point, such as the mock videos that parody educational and training tapes of the time.

The one problem that I do have with this boxed set isn't even the fault of the show; it is the fault of the producers of the DVD set.  For some reason, FOX aired a a few episodes from the middle of the season later in the year, and the episodes are in order of air-date on this set, as opposed to the order of production/continuity.  While this show isn't very arc-heavy, and for the most part can be seen out of order, there is a continuity to it, and the episode order on Disc 4 is a little off.  The last three episodes of the season were ""A New Hope"", ""Hyde Moves In"", and ""The Good Son"".  However, a few middle-of-the-season episodes were placed in between those three episodes on Disc 4.  Strangely, this is one of the few DVD sets that arranges episodes by air-date rather than by continuity's order.  Even shows like Arrested Development and Firefly (both of which are also FOX DVDs), which were aired out of order, have their episodes arranged correctly (although episode order is much more important for those two shows).  But while I would have preferred the correct order, it doesn't take too much away from the overall set, since the show doesn't depend too much on the arcs (at least not yet anyway).

As I said, this is a great show.  While it isn't as witty or clever as Arrested Development, it is far better than most of the comedy shows that appear on television.  If you've never seen the show before, you should consider checking it out.  Unlike certain shows, I could reccomend this as a ""blind buy"".  Enjoy.",1114646400,6,4729,4.546635182998819

2115107,5,B0002PYS5G,I cant seem to find the music video or the cast auditions in the special feutures am i missing something here?,1104192000,2,110,4.285714285714286
2115108,4,B0002PYS5G,"I think Season 1 was the best, with 2 and 3 coming in close.  They jumped the shark with the 100th episode that was a musical--paintful to watch.

Anyway, mainly wanted to comment that the special features listed here at Amazon are nowhere to be found on the disks as far as I can tell--No Cheap Trick music video, no Never-before-seen cast auditions, and the itneractive trivia challenge is NOT interactive...they just ask about 5 questions and give you the answer right away.  I was particularly disappointed that there were no cast audition clips as described.",1103932800,5,563,4.84375
2115109,5,B0002PYS5G,As a big 70's show fan from the very beginning it's nice to watch the show from the beginning again. I don't know how long I have waited for this release but I am very pleased to watch it without commercials. Once you watch one episode I swear you will watch the whole dvd. I can't wait until the second and third seasons come out!!,1102291200,4,332,4.123076923076923
2115110,5,B0002PYS5G,I've always loved this show since it first aired and all I have to say is that I can't wait for the upcoming seasons to become available!!!!,1102204800,2,140,4.222222222222222
2115111,5,B0002PYS5G,"The first season of ""That 70s Show"" is laugh-out-loud, hysterically funny! (I'm still laughing as I write this!)

I would be about 3 years older than the teens depicted in the show (I graduated high school in 1974), and, man, they've nailed the 70s' hair and clothes.  The writing of the show is clever, the humor of the show is applicable to any generation, and the ""look"" of the show is unique and creative.  But the show's strongest point is its wonderful ensemble cast -- I can't single out any individual cast member because they're ALL really, really talented.

I'm not much of a TV watcher, so I'm sorry I missed ""That 70s Show"" in its first run...what a bummer.  But I am anxiously awaiting the release of the remaining seasons.",1101427200,3,736,4.587786259541985
2115112,5,B0002PYS5G,"I remember seeing the ads for this show before it even aired & making sure I remembered to watch it!!

Being someone who actually WAS a teenager in the late 70s, I see a lot of myself & my friends in Eric's posse.

Our hangout was my friend Suzie's Grandmom's basement & we did some frighteningly similar things!!

Even though I watch it daily in syndication, I love owning it!!

Whenever I have a bad day, I can just pop it in the DVD player & laugh away my unhappiness.

A MUST HAVE for any fan of the GREATEST SHOW EVER!!!!",1100822400,3,526,4.1683168316831685
2115113,4,B0002PYS5G,"I love this DVD set. Not enough extras, but the show is great, and I had never seen the first Christmas episode. So that was a bonus! There appears to be some unedited parts and maybe even the original music. I also noticed that The Water Tower episode comes before The Punk Chick episode, but in the Punk Chick episode Eric tells Hyde if Hyde goes to NYC they won't be able to paint the pot leaf on the tower... But they already had... Anyways, love the show, can't wait for more. Peace!",1100563200,3,488,4.258064516129032
2115114,4,B0002PYS5G,"Alothough I was too young to get into That 70s Shows when it first aired, I got hooked immediately. All the insane situations the gang gets into will make your side rip open. Even those of us born after the 70s can understand the historical comedy in each episode. Though I find the third and fourth seasons to be the best, season one has its good points and lets you get to know the characters. I am so glad they finally released the DVD and hope the other seasons are soon to come.",1100476800,3,483,4.204301075268817
2115115,5,B0002PYS5G,"Everyone has been waiting for this. ""This"" has finally come. 25 episodes of the best show. Theres really not much you can say. They're probably ending it this year since they can't go into the 80's. The only thing I didn't like about it is, the Cheap Trick music video isn't on it. But they have about 10 minutes of promos and a question extra. 4 DVD's it'll take ya back, it's classic.",1100044800,2,386,4.301369863013699
2115116,4,B0002PYS5G,"I graduated high school in 1978 - this show is like watching my teenage years over which is why I LOVE it!  The DVD set is great but I wanted MORE - commentary by the actors on different episodes would have been wonderful, outtakes and bloopers, lots more on the ""extras"" side..............",1099785600,2,290,4.576923076923077

2115118,5,B0002PYS5G,"This is probably the best show that has ever been on TV.  I don't know why it took them sooo long to put them on DVD... I just hope that they pop out the other seasons on DVD ASAP!!! and they should do things like add commentary options.  that's the only thing that could make this any better.  Get it and watch them all!  you'll laugh so hard, and if you want roll up some Oregano and you know what to do!!!",1099267200,2,408,3.9390243902439024
2115119,5,B0002PYS5G,I'm so happy it's finally out! the first season of the worlds best show is finally out for us to enjoy anytime.,1099180800,3,111,4.090909090909091
2115120,4,B0002PYS5G,"Popular music faithful to the era in which this sitcom is set has always been a significant element of ""That '70s Show"", sometimes even playing a role in and guiding the plotlines.  Fans who have watched the show from its beginning on Fox will notice that the daily syndicated reruns often feature generic music in place of notable tunes that originally aired in weekly first-run episodes.  For example, the Big Star tunes ""Thirteen"" and ""I'm In Love With A Girl"" were featured in multiple episodes to punctuate poignant moments in Donna's and Eric's romance.  When those shows air in syndication, those brilliant tunes have been replaced with bland filler music that detracts from the affecting nature of the scene (an even more puzzling occurence, in this case, when considering that the show's theme song is based on the Big Star tune ""In The Street"").

Before I purchase this DVD set, I would like to know if the producers were able to license the same musical selections as featured in the original airings, and not their syndicated counterparts.  The show is about teenagers growing up in the hazy '70s and the music of that decade is as essential to their lives as the friendships they develop.  As such, the show could not possibly have the same impact without it.  So, can anyone who has seen or purchased this set offer any insight on this issue?  Thanks in advance.",1099094400,5,1376,4.776371308016878
2115121,4,B0002PYS5G,"15. 1-15 119 07-Feb-1999 That Wrestling Show was edited. During one of the begining scenes where Donna has Eric in a head lock and his face is buried in her chest, she goes ""Why aren't you fighting back??"" Hyde goes ""Why should he fight back"", then its cut to hit shakling his head and goes to a shot of them sitting on the couch. Well in the original airing on tv Hyde says ""Why should he fight back, look where you have his head"". Then Donna stops and shoves Eric back off her onto the couch.

I couldve sworn this scene was in the original airing. Sadly they cannot include unedited material. So for this I give this set four stars i wonder if anything else is edited.

2115122,5,B0002PYS5G,"I have yet to purchase this DVD Collection, I just wanted to let someone know how happy I am that they FINALLY put these funny kids on DVD. I was looking for this about 6 months ago thinking that it would already be on DVD and was disappointed that I could not find it!  SO I have to just say thank you!!!  I can finally watch these funny kids whenever I want to.",1098748800,2,363,3.958904109589041
2115123,5,B0002PYS5G,"It seems like after decades, T7S is finally on DVD! Great move Fox! This release is AMAZING! The packaging and menus are great! All 25 episodes from the first season are included as they were originally aired with a crisp look and great sound. A+ quality stuff you get here. This is the premiere season that kicks off the funniest show of all time and it's one of the funniest, if not THE funniest, seasons of the series.

There's only three bonus materials but they're worth it. A good yet short quiz, a great promo-palooza, which is very worth the watch, and the featurette. Bloopers are the only thing missing on this DVD and maybe some more interviews. But the DVD is AWESOME! I got it on the 23rd and I've been watching NONSTOP!

Not only is this a must-own for fans of the show but ANYONE will enjoy this show and love it to death. I don't know one person who doesn't like the show, from my 6-year-old cousin to my 50-year-old dad. It's perfect all around fun for all generations!

Can't wait for the next seasons to be released!",1098576000,6,1035,4.408376963350785
2115124,5,B0002PYS5G,"The first season of That 70's Show is a funny look at teenagers growing up in a small Wisconsin town in 1976/1977.  The cast was made up of virtual unknowns and the plots revolve around usual teenage situations like having sex, drinking, pulling pranks and getting high.  The show revolves around the Foreman family and most of the action takes place in their home, specifically the basement where Eric (Topher Grace) and his friends hang out. The friends are made up of Hyde (Danny Masterson) the conspiracy minded, juvenile delinquent, Kelso (Ashton Kutcher) the good looking one, Fez (Wilmer Valderama) the foreign exchange student, Donna (Laura Prepon) the next door neighbor and object of Eric's lust and Jackie (Mila Kunis) Kelso's annoying girlfriend.  The first uses the events of the time (President Ford making a campaign stop, the release of Star Wars, Todd Rundgren concert, going to a new disco) than later seasons, but the essence of the show hasn't changed.  All the actors are quite good especially Mr. Grace & Mr. Kutcher and Kurtwood Smith is a hilarious as Eric's stern father Red whose always threatening to put his foot in someone's ass.",1098316800,18,1158,4.953608247422681
2115125,5,B0002PYS5G,"I must say that That 70's show is easily the best show I've ever seen. I've seen some other good shows out there: Raymond, Friends, etc., but That 70's Show is the only show that I could watch 50 times everyday without getting tired of it. Literally, I think this show should be on more often, but I'm glad that it is finally coming out on DVD. I've been waiting since it first came out, and I'm sure that I won't be the only pleased person.",1097366400,7,441,4.1395348837209305

2115128,5,B0002PYS5G,"The long awaited release of the 70's Show on DVD (the 1st Season) has finally arrived. In recent years the sitcoms have been empty and shallow punching for laughs in a manner that lacks class or wit. This show is the exception. In fact this was the only show I found so engaging that it was hard to miss an episode, and then even the reruns. No matter how many times I see this show and even episodes I have already previously seen, the show remains fresh and incredibly funny. I find myself laughing out loud incessantly every episode sometimes to the point of tears and belly aches. This show is a true gem with intelligent writing, interesting characters played by very talented young actors (several of who have already displayed a wide range and high competence as actors in major motion pictures) and older ones as well such as Kurtwood Smith who is a riot as Red, Eric Forman's Dad. Most important the show has heart and soul. This show manages to touch who ever may be watching and take you to a fun and enjoyable place. For whoever grew up in the Seventies this flashback really takes you back and reminds you of the innocence and freedom that characterized the era (i.e. getting high and casual sex). For the younger generations it is just as accessible providing a template for new experiences and open mindedness in a playful and fun way. I am so glad this is finally being released on DVD and I eagerly await the other seasons as well. There are few shows as worthy as this one that merit being watched and enjoyed again and again. This trip was definitely worth it!",1095033600,12,1579,4.505226480836237

Fett's appearance on the special was in a cartoon adventure, animated by Nelvana. The following spring of 1979, Kenner Toys offered fans a chance to get a mail-order action figure of the new Star Wars villain. Fans, wondering who this new bounty hunter was and what his connections were to the Galactic Empire or the Rebel Alliance, would have to wait until May 1980, when Fett appeared on the big screen in The Empire Strikes Back.

8030487,3,B0002PYS5G,"This is a review of the complete series on Blu-ray (Flashback Edition), not the series itself.

Good:
 - Widescreen
 - Small packaging
 - Price (46$)

Neutral:
 - The video quality is OK but not great. I was expecting a big hit on video quality considering they crammed as much episodes as they could on a Blu-ray disc (each discs contain 12-13 episodes) so I was pleasantly surprised.

Bad:
 - No subtitles/CC.
 - No original broadcast music. This set contains the syndicated episodes, the same as the FOX DVDs set. Don't expect to find new songs.
 - Some episodes contain brief scenes in SD (Standard Definition) Video. It can be quite noticeable when viewing on a big screen.
 - That '70s Musical is a mess. Not only is the episode not in HD, it is not even in SD. Furthermore it is cropped from 4:3 source into 16:9, that means that every scene constantly feels ""zoomed in"".
 - The second half of the first season is using the broadcast order instead of the production order. Some episodes will not make sense if you watch them using the broadcast order.
 - There are mistakes in some episodes, the most notable examples:
  in the season 5 episode ""Bring it on Home"" during the man-pretty montage the narration is missing.
 in the season 7 finale ""Till The Next Goodbye"" the scene where Fez says goodbye to Eric in the kitchen is completely gone.

I haven't watched season 8 because it is godawful.

TL;DR: Worth it for the price but expect the same syndicated episodes as the FOX DVDs in widescreen minus the subtitles.",1524614400,,1524,4.602230483271375
