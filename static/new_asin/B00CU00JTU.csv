5740577,3,B00CU00JTU,"Evil Dead all over again except in Sweden. Basement investigation leads to the release of those who dwell underground (represented by one) and it's all downhill from there. It's a jolly old romp with blood and gore splattered everywhere. We could have slung it all around some fir or another and called it a Christmas tree.
As with the Evil Dead, suspend your disbelief. You're along for the ride.
Also, for what it's worth, my copy is called ""Cabin of the Dead."" That just gives it away.",1384473600,2,488,4.620689655172414

5740579,4,B00CU00JTU,"WITHER is a highly enjoyable little Swedish shocker with enough gore and violence to feed the fiends. The violence was over-the-top, the folklore the film is based on truly interesting and the homage to Sam Raimi's THE EVIL DEAD is respectful to the original source material and intelligently executed. Bottom line, super entertaining with a few white-knuckle sequences.

Many viewers have insisted it was a better remake than Alvarez's EVIL DEAD, to each his or her own. I enjoyed both. Recommended. Hopefully we get a Blu-ray release at some point in the future.",1383177600,7,564,5.064516129032258

5740583,5,B00CU00JTU,"If you are any kind of fan of horror, drop whatever it is you're doing, and go buy WITHER, right now.  Seriously.  If you're still reading this, then you must not like good horror.  This film is an amazing and visceral genre piece that EVERY horror fan and gore-hound should own.  If this flick is any indication of where Swedish horror is headed, then sign me up.

Man, this film blew me away.  It is a gore-soaked fright-fest that kept me on the edge of my seat.  It is definitely not what I was expecting, but that is such a good thing here.  I can't wait to see what the two directors do next.

WITHER is shot very well and the production value looks high.  The acting is good, although the Swedish dialogue did throw me off a bit here and there.  The story is intriguing, taken directly (if I understand correctly) from old Swedish folklore.  I particularly like this aspect, as it lends a certain credibility to the film.

But what really wins me over with this one is the gore and the special effects.  If you are squeamish in the least, do not watch this film.  It is a grand-slam of good old fashioned carnage.  There's more gore in this gem of an import than many domestic titles have here at home.  It is truly amazing.

I have to admit, too, that I am rather impressed with the homage that WITHER pays to Sam Raimi's EVIL DEAD.  This is not a remake, nor is it an attempt to outdo Raimi's classic.  This is simply a labor-of-love film that dedicates itself EVIL DEAD's groundbreaking excellence.

I highly recommend WITHER to any and all horror fans out there.  Gore-hounds will love the bloodbath and scare-freaks will love the thrills and chills.  The film is available now, so be sure and check it out for sure.",1379376000,21,1726,4.40952380952381
5740584,4,B00CU00JTU,"[...]

I grew up loving horror, actually desiring the films which were able to get under my skin. When I was too young for the bloodier films, I filled up on classic horror movies: creature films from Cold War paranoia, Depression-era Universal monster movies, all the way up to the beginning of the slasher films with Michael Powell's Peeping Tom and Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. The truly daring movies all have numerous copycats, though rarely are they as engaging as the originals. Wither does well not to attempt to reinvent the wheel, but as a Swedish take on the `cabin-in-the-woods' narrative it is able to offer an original style to that old familiar bloodbath.

  Made before the 2013 remake of Evil Dead, Wither could easily be an unofficial remake in many regards, though is a different reason for the demonic attacks on a group of viral young adults on a getaway in the woods, based on Swedish mythology involving a creature which lives underground. The storyline and its practical effects seem most inspired by Sam Raimi's cult classic and its sequels, as well as the Dario Argento produced Italian films, Demons and Demons 2. A group of friends find themselves fighting each other off once some sort of possession/contagion is spread after a creature in the cellar is disturbed.

  With plot simplified and narrative somewhat predictable, much of the film comes down to characters and the film's bloodier sequences. The effects are flawlessly done, never so flashy that they detract from the point of the sequence while always elevated to an extreme level. By the end of the film, the cabin walls are covered in blood from various battles between friends who have become possessed and those still trying to survive. There are many predictable characters in this film, though filmmakers Sonny Laguna and Tommy Wiklund throw a few unexpected twists in these caricatures, especially those you think may survive. The effect is not unlike the stoner's escape from death in Joss Whedon produced hit, Cabin in the Woods.

  Though there aren't more than a handful of Swedish horror films, those which do exist are compelling enough to anticipate more. Tomas Alfredson's Let the Right One In was solid enough for Hollywood to snatch it up as a remake almost immediately. Though I don't imagine Wither needs an American remake, I am certain we will be seeing more from Laguna and Wiklund in the future.

5740585,5,B00CU00JTU,"Really loved this movie. If you're an Evil Dead fan i recommend it highly...as long as you don't mind subtitles. As far as story goes, there's a legend of a creature that lives underground. It will possess anyone who intrudes on its territory. All it has to do is look you right in the eye. In come the friends on the usual weekend getaway.  The gore is plentiful. The acting is above average for a lower budget film. So if you're looking for a fun, gory way to pass 90 min..give Wither a shot.",1377648000,9,494,4.25531914893617
5740586,3,B00CU00JTU,"So this movie comes across as a sort of Swedish version of the Evil Dead. It's pretty low budget stuff with a cast of actors who, with one or two exceptions, have yet to hone their acting skills.

One of it's strengths is that it has no pretensions of being anything other than that, which might be argued is also one of it's weaknesses because there's really nothing new here. The image on the DVD cover pretty much sums up the movie.

It has gore aplenty, which is generally lingered on for longer than necessary, as if the filmmakers are saying ""Hey look at this, isn't this a really cool effect?""

That said, there are a few moment of genuine tension and dread, though which are often dispelled by characters doing stupid things.

If you enjoyed Dead Snow you will probably enjoy this, though it's a fairly humorless affair and the final confrontation with the Medusa-like Vittra is disappointing and anti-climatic.",1377561600,3,919,4.6894409937888195
5740587,1,B00CU00JTU,"I can appreciate Evil Dead being the inspiration for Wither but this film just isn't very good. There were too many ""come on now"" moments when things happened that just didn't make sense and totally missed the points of what made Evil Dead such a great horror film. Evil Dead took more time and care to set up the circumstances that led to the demon possessions, murder and mayhem that takes place in the cabin. It was also ahead of its time in some creative shot selection and editing. Wither doesn't do this as the film gives the basics of why the cast end up in the house in the woods, but clumsily starts the possessions in one of the dumbest scenes of the film. The only good thing about that scene was the eyeball distortion. Even the explanation for what's going on in Wither is weak. An old guy who had no business still being in the forest at that point (avoiding spoilers I won't say why), remembered a story from decades prior. As opposed to Evil Dead, where the cast finds the freakin necronomicon and plays a recording of a historian that actually recited one of the spells awakening the demons in the forest.

It becomes clear that too much emphasis was placed on the gore at the expense of everything else that could have made Wither a good horror film. The acting is terrible, the editing is heavy handed, shot selection is as basic as it gets as if a first year film student is behind the camera and the film simply isn't scary. It's just dumb. Areas in the film where things could have happened to genuinely cause scares brought nothing and scenes dealing with the possessed are laughable for all the wrong reasons. A bookcase and a toppled frig are the weapons of choice here and they actually worked? REALLY?",1515715200,2,1728,4.485714285714286
5740588,2,B00CU00JTU,"A decent attempt. I think it takes a lot away when there are subtitles, when you can't read the campiness in a particular line of dialogue, so I don't think subtitled movies really ever have a chance. Certainly allows you to appreciate the campiness of the original, since it is missing here. So I can only evaluate this on a limited few criteria. The creatures effects were good, scary and super-ugly. Gore was gory and in great quantity and just like a smorgasbord there really was too much of everything. I did have trouble maintaining interest, but mainly because of the inability to follow the dialogue, so I would have to admit that it was probably a good movie although I didn't like it.",1515024000,2,694,4.604838709677419
5740589,1,B00CU00JTU,"Horrible. There's no consistency in the story, actors just wander around aimlessly in scenes without action, and nothing about the story is scary. It had some decent practical and computer effects. But other than that it was super boring and lame, again NOT scary.

Even though this was a low budget movie, what really got me was the graphics! The kills, blood, makeup, gore...everything looked amazing. The story was decent and the acting was good and the tone of the film all worked really well. It did kind of remind me of the first Evil Dead movie but of course Evil Dead was a lot better.

There was a few parts of the movie (CG eyes especially) that kind of made me laugh a bit because it looked stupid but other than the minor ""errors"", I really enjoyed this movie. As an avid horror fan, I would recommend this one to watch.",1503014400,,720,4.217391304347826
5740594,1,B00CU00JTU,I wanted to believe the good reviews and watched with cognitive dissonance for a while. I got halfway through the movie and realized that this movie is a horrible waste. They should not be able to compare this to Evil Dead in any way. That was art. This movie is not art. There is nothing compelling about it. Nothing really happens except people getting their faces eaten off and zombies getting killed. Not scary.,1502064000,,415,4.621621621621622

5740597,1,B00CU00JTU,"This is the first time I have been moved to write a review for a film.  It was that bad. This was not a tribute to Sam Raimi! It was insulting to even put this in the same category as the first, or even the 2013 remake of Evil Dead.  How can you screw up a plot that was handed to you? None of the characters seem to want to escape or put up a decent fight.  And how is it easier to kill the ""monster"" in the basement than her proselytes.  I had so much hope for this Swedish adaptation.  Alas it was not to be... I actually sped through much of the end. Ridiculous.",1500940800,2,566,3.8448275862068964
5740598,4,B00CU00JTU,"The beginning of Wither dragged a bit, but after the people got to the isolated cabin things started to rock. The comparisons to Evil Dead are interesting. I didn't get much of the Evil Dead feeling with Wither other than it's an isolated and long unused unused cabin. Since isolation, the scary woods, and mysterious cabins are common themes in horror movies, I don't see a strong connection to Evil Dead. The biggest distinction between the two movies is Wither is less super natural and more possessed zombie gore.  Evil Dead spent way more time on the evil's back story.  The cabin in Evil Dead is also far more isolated.  The cabin in Wither is on the grid and has cell service.

Wither works in its own right because it's unrelenting and simple.  It doesn't bog down in needless character development, plot tricks, and cheap scares.  It does spend some time at the beginning with two of the characters, but that's done fairly efficiently by also providing some set up information.  Once Wither starts going, it just goes until the end.",1500768000,,1041,4.718232044198895

5740601,3,B00CU00JTU,"I gave it a three, but just barely. This is supposed to be a homage to The Evil Dead (the original, not the 'remake' mess), one of my two favorite horror cult classics of all time. It had all the necessary elements to be really good movie, but the timing was off. The first 'scary' scene made me laugh because it was telegraphed ahead. Some of the actions of the characters were not very smart to say the least: favorite 'we got to go now', open door, raining hard, nope raining too hard lets go back in (that's not exactly what the person said). I'd rather get wet, than dead. In Evil Dead, I laughed but because it was campy, not silly. Most persons would not get too hurt by a seven foot fall, especially when that was what the person was expecting to happen. Lots of gore, lots of blood and lots of wasted potential.

5740606,4,B00CU00JTU,"This movie is supposed to be a Swedish homage to Rami's ""The Evil Dead."" The plot is basically that several attractive Swedes go to an isolated cabin in the woods to party. They are possessed by an ancient evil which resides in the ground there, and are killed one by one. The evil is transmitted through body fluids, and so the movie gets sort of a ""Cabin Fever"" feel. It lacks the over the top special effects and the black humor which made the original ED so much fun. The special effects are really good. Even though a chain saw is not present, wood working implements figure prominently. There is a great wood auger through the head scene. Several of the reviewers have complained the movie is in Swedish, I actually liked that. The cultural nuances put a spin on a rather clichd horror plot. Its amazing the f bomb sound the same in Swedish as it does in English!  I didn't find the movie as terrifying as some of the other reviewers, but did thoroughly enjoy it. Only question was, if the ancient evil was so powerful, how could it not see in the dark and be killed so easily by an overturned refrigerator? Go figure.",1500076800,3,1124,4.429951690821256

So why does a nearly carbon-copy of something that was made over 30 years ago (the original Evil Dead) rate 5 stars to anybody? This is a been there, done that movie. Heed my warning: Every time a s***ty horror fan watches another s***ty horror movie they are bringing themselves closer to their own GRAVE! You can't get these minutes back. You would be better off buying the documentary of Orozco the Embalmer, so at least you'd be seeing something different and interesting. Or maybe you should reverse your tastes and try some older, more darkly comic things like the Abominable Dr. Phibes. Believe me, there is not a plot point, trick or gore effect that you have never witnessed before. If you think this movie is 4 or 5 stars, then your tastes are as narrow as your own coffin. If you think it has some type of alternate credibility because it's foreign, then go stream ""Sheitan."" At least that has the great Vincent Cassel and is morbidly fruity!",1419465600,,1742,4.5094936708860756

5740629,2,B00CU00JTU,"Terrible acting. Terrible directing and the worst crime of all: just not scary! The script and screenplay was poor too. If this is a homage to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead, then it fails miserably. *SPOILER*
The demons from the original are now basically zombies and zombies aren't really scary! The big difference is that Sam Raimi's demons could talk and said scary stuff. This movie, not so much.
*End SPOILER*
The lead character gives his best shot at acting and hence the extra star in my review, but, all in all, this movie isn't worth the purchase. Watch the original again instead.

Maybe something was lost in translation but so much of this movie made no sense to me. If I understood correctly, the father of one of the main male characters somehow knew of this abandoned cabin in the woods and thought it would be a great place for his son and friends to take a little vacation. The father works for the power company, so he was able to turn the power on. Once they get there, there's no key, so one guy picks the lock. Meanwhile, another of the guys talks a girl into sneaking in through an open window in the back to scare the others. The girl, who was initially afraid to go in to the dark cabin by herself, suddenly decides she wants to go explore the dark creepy cellar by herself. When it's down to the last couple, they finally decide to leave but decide not to try for the car because it's rainy, dark and muddy outside. Much better plan to stay in the cabin with one of the demons. I mean we're all used to a certain level of stupidity from the characters when it comes to horror movies, but this one really left me scratching my head.",1397952000,,1075,4.223300970873787

Not everyone needs to like the same things, or as intensely or lukewarm but man, the total s***e canning of perfectly good/well made flicks is just absurd. This Swedish flick kicks serious butt. Its well done across the board: production values, acting, effects, story line, plot, dialogue... No complaints to be found here. An excellent way to spend some time. I wasn't even going to bother posting a review for such an obviously good movie and one that should come to everyone's attention but I figure the filmmakers deserve to hear from everybody and not just the ""w"" crowd. And I disagree that its the Swedish Evil Dead. I mean, really? Evil Dead is 30+ years old now (man, that's depressing). Ya think they wouldn't have done it a while back? There is a cabin, there are  takeovers (some may say the z word, others the p word) but the similarities end there. There's no book of the dead. Its about a Swedish folk tale. There is no ""Ash""like character. The atmosphere is completely different, as is the delivery by the actors. No... ""Why have you awakened us from our ancient slumber?"" voice, which is my favorite line in ED. Just like every possession movie is ""an Exorcist rip off, bla, bla, bla"". Well, thank Dog for that because we horror junkies would have nothing to watch if every horror movie had to have a completely original premise.

Wither is the closest you will be to a modern Evil Dead.  What i found interesting is that many occurrences in this film mimic Alvarez's remake of the original Evil Dead.  Apparently this film was post production before Alvarez's film was released.  Wither proves again a male lead can work in horror film, it does not turn out to be a ""disaster"" A female lead is so staple, overdone, and boring.

After this it's the same tired and oft-repeated Zombie plot device: OMG-I'm Bit (Scratched, et cetera) / OMG-You're going to turn into a Zombie.

5740662,5,B00CU00JTU,Excellent fresh Swedish homage to the classic Evil Dea(mixed in with a bit of Quarantine) but without the dark humor of Sam Raimi. The gore is reminiscent of a grindhouse film which makes it fun for those of us that love zombie gore. The acting is quite good too which is not the norm of a grind house film. Wither has an eerie claustrophobic atmosphere and it will definitely spark interest in Walking Dead fans. The lighting is dark but you always see the dead coming! There is a gloomy score which is pitch perfect and the zombie make-up is outstanding and totally believable. Just goes to show you again that you don't need a lot of money and CGI to make a good horror film.  American horror should take a few cues from some of these Indie European films.

Since the Ring,  very few horror films have inspired any real dread or made me want to hide my head under the covers. Wither doesn't trot out the usual scares you see. No cats  leaping out on paths or bird flying out of a barn.  The creepy unease was palpable and once the mayhem starts,  it just doesn't ease up. Now, on to why I gave it four  instead of five stars.  Being wonderfully chilling, Wither still  defaulted to tired ole stereotypes -- Paper thin somewhat likable, disposable characters. Victims freaks. She runs into the woods. She falls...*sigh*  Loving couple  run UPSTAIRS instead of running the hell out of the house.  They seem not to have any kind of survival instinct, waiting waaaay too long to do anything in self defense.  In one scene,  an  undead actually just walks up to the hero and takes an ax out of his hand...I mean, just takes it, no muss, no fuss.  Really?  *sigh part two* I kept screaming at them to grow a brain or two. Still--the set up is great, the gore beyond fantastic and the scares fantastic.

There was a more interesting subplot involving a father who had lost his wife and daughter and kind of knew what was going on but it unfortunately wasn't explored. I know most horror movies have the characters doing stupid things but this movie was riddled with them so much so that is really bugged me. For instance.. one girl says she doesn't want to go into the cabin alone and then about thirty seconds later she is wondering down into a creepy basement by herself in the dark, One guy suggests a CLEARLY very sick friend may have rabies and yet decides to wipe his hands on a towel covered in the friends blood and even wipes it through his hair.
