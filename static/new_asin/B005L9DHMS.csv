For me it was as if the entire opera was a continuous brain orgasm. Better than drugs really. (Speaking metaphorically - of course). Packed with good humour and interest. Buy it, you won't regret it.",1420070400,,310,4.553571428571429

8477390,4,B005L9DHMS,"Born on the island of Burano in the Venetian Republic, Baldassare Galuppi (1706 - 1785) is another case of a composer who was highly popular and successful in his own lifetime, but whose work soon fell into obscurity after his death.  After a spell in London at the Kings Theatre, Galuppi, nonetheless served two terms as maestra di capella at St Marks in Venice, spent several years in Russia in-between as court composer for Catherine the Great, and left behind over a hundred operas, few of which have ever been revived.  L'inimico delle donne is therefore a welcome opportunity to hear performed one of the later works for which Galuppi was celebrated in his day, the opera buffa, a style that left behind a certain amount of influence that can be seen in the works of Haydn and Mozart.

Die Entfhrung Aus Dem Serail certainly comes to mind often in L'inimico delle donne when
Agensina is shipwrecked on the oriental land of Kibin-kan-ka with her father, escaping from rich noble suitors that pursue her, since she has a profound dislike for men.  Zon-zon, the prince of Kibin-kan-ka, is obliged by the law of the land to get married, but similarly he doesn't like women, finds their scent revolting and considers them about as attractive as toads.  Inevitably, Zon-zon begins to find Agnesina not quite as disgusting as the suitable women lined-up for him by his retainers, while Agnesina for her part finds herself strangely flattered by the attentions of this foreign prince.  I say inevitably, but clearly there's nothing inevitable about it except in terms of convention.  As characters, they are far from fully-formed or convincing, and the situations - for all the comic potential they hold - are likewise scarcely developed.  Surprisingly, the potential isn't really exploited in musical terms either.  The opera is spritely paced, with lively Baroque dance rhythms, but it's all fairly conventional and not greatly aligned to emotional expression other than through slight variations of tempo.  There's very little recitative and even arias are brief and restrained, with no high-flown sentiments or great displays of vocal dexterity, but this treatment seems well-suited to the light-hearted subject.

L'inimico delle donne is a modest affair then that in itself is not particularly funny, but there's a lot of entertainment that can be drawn from it with the right kind of staging, and every effort is certainly put into it in this rare 2011 production by the Opra Royal de Wallonie in Lige.  The stage direction by Stefano Mazzonis di Pralafera respects the period, the tone and the buffa conventions with its colourful Mikado-like Oriental setting, though it introduces a few twists of its own in the form of shadow projections in the background.  The music and the staging are well judged then, but what helps carry it all off are the performances.  The singing is terrific from Anna Maria Panzarella (who will be familiar from various Rameau productions) as Agnesina and from Filippo Adami and Zon-zon, who both enter into the spirit of it in their acting performances without over-egging it.  It's Agnesina's father Geminiano however who has some of the best lines and comic moments in the opera, and he's wonderfully played by Alberto Rinaldi.  There are no weak elements either in the Court ladies or retainers to the prince, with Liesbeth Devos standing out as the feisty Xunchia.

Released by Dynamic on DVD only, the quality of the image is generally good but not all that impressive.  It doesn't look like the production was shot in HD, but presented in Standard Definition NTSC it's still quite good.  Contrast is high, and there is some slight shimmering breaking up lines, but the colourful staging looks good and the camera work captures the occasion well.  Audio tracks are LPCM stereo and Dolby Digital 5.1 and there's a lovely tone to the orchestration and clarity in the singing.  There is a little bit of ambient noise and stage clatter and one or two pops on the recording, but nothing that detracts from the overall quality.  Subtitles are in Italian, English, French, German and Spanish.",1328572800,4,4125,4.982507288629738
8477391,4,B005L9DHMS,"Long before The Mikado (1885), L'Italiana in Algeri (1813), or Die Entfhrung aus dem Serail (1782), there was Baldassarre Galuppi's ""L'Inimico delle Donne"" (1771), a comic opera about two Italians shipwrecked in the imaginary Chinese kingdom of Kibinchinka. Prince Zon-Zon is a confirmed woman-hater, suspected by his courtier of not being quite a Man but compelled by the ancient customs of his realm to select a bride this month. By chance, a Italian woman Agnesina, who hates all men, arrives in Zon-Zon's palace with her scheming uncle Geminiano. Inevitably, the Prince and the Italiana will turn out to be a match made in ... no, not heaven, but with the spurious approval of the God Kanag. The libretto, by Giovanni Bertati, makes effective whackiness out of the culture clash.

There are three (3!) operas by Galuppi currently available on DVD! That in itself is something of a marvel, since it wasn't long ago that Galuppi was utterly forgotten. ""L'Inimico dell Donne"" is more stagey comedy than music; it scarcely compares to Mozart's or Rossini's crossed-cultural masterpieces. The musical composition is competent but not especially memorable. Galuppi was eminently capable of more thrilling music. If you want evidence that he deserves to be revived, choose L'Olimpiade first:

Or else listen to his psalms settings:

But this DVD is worth a look&listen chiefly for its historical interest. The production is extravagantly colorful, with gorgeously bizarre costumes and effective stage acting.  Filippo Adami is excellent vocally in the role of Zon-Zon; whether it's his singing or the composer's choice, Adami gets most of the sprightliest arias. Anna Maria Panzarella has a fine voice but, to my ears, fails to make the most of her arias, singing them with minimal elaboration and in a style that would better suit a later repertoire. No conductor alive could bring more insight to this era's music than Rinaldo Alessandrini, but his genius is wasted on the modern-instrument orchestra of the Opera Royal de Wallonie of Liege. The music just isn't furious enough to be funny in this ""hybrid"" scoring. I intuit that a bolder musical rendition might give me a totally different impression of the whole opera.",1325548800,10,2622,5.9338624338624335
