Spoilers

1. DOLPH ZIGGLER VS BARON CORBIN-this was a really good opening match that showcased Corbin really well. He dominated most of the match taking to the veteran in Ziggler. It was a strong showing for him but a rookie mistake as the broadcast team pointed out cost him the match. Ziggler picks up the win in a good opener.

2.[US TITLE]KALISTO VS RYBACK-this was an excellent match and very much deserved to be on the main card instead of the pre-show. Both guys looked great here with Kalisto pulling out all stops to get the win here. Ryback had one of his best performances here, he works very well with Kalisto. This was a great match.

3. ENZO & BIG CASS VS THE VAUDEVILLAINS-this match didn't even get a chance to get going. First the tag champs New Day come out and sit ringside, these guys are way to entertaining. Then we get our two teams who were competing for a shot at the titles. The crowd was so into this match, Enzo and Cass in particular. The match isn't too far in when an accident legit takes Enzo out of the match forcing the ref to stop the match. It was a scary moment when we were watching this live.

4. KEVIN OWENS VS SAMI ZAYN-probably the best match on the card and that makes perfect sense. Not only do these two guys put out great matches on a regular basis but with each other it seems even better. These guys have one of the best rivalries in WWE and this match adds to that legacy. This is a great back and forth match that the fans are really into. Owens ends up getting the win in a hard fought battle. He then throws Zayn from the ring and makes his way to the broadcast table to get Byron to interview him. He then joins the commentary team for the I-C title match, love it.

5.[I-C TITLE]THE MIZ VS CESARO-this was a good match for the I-C title and Owens was hilarious on commentary. Cesaro of course was dominant and at times almost rag dolling Miz. Miz though would make it competitive but Zayn would come out and attack Owens. This would lead to a distraction that costs Cesaro the win, Miz retains after a nice roll up.

6. CHRIS JERICHO VS DEAN AMBROSE-one of the best matches on the card as these two had a great rivalry going on. These two gave us a completive back and forth match with many counters that would see Dean Ambrose get the victory. This was a great match with two very fun performers.

7.[WOMENS TITLE]CHARLOTTE VS NATALYA-these two always have a great match and do their families proud every time. In fact family was at ringside with each for this match. Bret hart with Nattie and Ric of course with his daughter. This while not the best match the two have had with each other was still very good until. The until of course means that ending that was booked for them. Because Bret was there they went with the Montreal Screw Job finish that they always bring back from time to time. I did however love the Harts putting them sharpshooters on the Flairs.

8.[WWE TITLE]ROMAN REIGNS VS AJ STYLES-the match I was most looking forward to since I am a huge AJ fan. I knew that Roman was going to keep the strap but I was hoping. This was a really good match and AJ of course was great. It had a nice pace and plenty of back and forth. That phenomenal forearm that he nails on Roman that sends them threw a table was amazing. That leads to a count out victory for Styles, then the match is restated by Shane with no count outs. The match that follows is short but another good one for what it was. That is until Roman lands a low blow and gets DQd. This prompts Steph to come out and restart the match with no DQs. The final match is the one I actually expected from the beginning.  Hard hitting, high flying back and forth affair that would see interference from the Club and The Usos. The ending is expected as far as the winner, Reigns, but the way he won was cool looking. This was a really good match even though the restarts didn't really make much sense.

The event also was about Vince and his decision to let Shane and Steph run things together. With that said I thought that this was a very good event and worth the buy if you are a wrestling fan.",1465257600,,4137,4.284250960307299
8750046,5,B01BG7RLCA,"Got this recently, I enjoyed it alot. Thanks WWE",1465084800,,48,4.444444444444445
8750047,4,B01BG7RLCA,"The The Vaudevillains (Aiden English & Simon Gotch) vs. Enzo Amore & Colin Cassady tag team was short mainly because of Enzo's injury. So I can't really analyze the match. FYI Enzo's OK now. The Kevin Owens vs. Sami Zayn match was an outstanding match. Going into it I had high expectations for it and I think its fair to say they met those expectations. This was incredible to watch because they had a really competitive where both guys had several moments where they could have won. They also had the crowd eating out of their hands. In terms of mid-card matches, you don't see a crowd into a match as much as they were into this one. Thats an appreciation for the two guys in the ring. I loved so many things about the match like the intense brawl early on, then Zayn hitting a dive right away, Owens using his power throughout, Zayn with the high spots such as the DDT on the floor and Owens showing the resilience to come back for the win. I picked Owens to win because I figure there will be more matches where Zayn can get wins, so its important to keep the heel strong. It was one of the best matches of the year although not at the level of the Nakamura/Zayn match at NXT Takeover Dallas show that is my MOTY at this point. More Owens vs. Zayn matches please. Theyre so great together and Im so excited about their future in WWE. The WWE Intercontinental Title: The Miz (w/Maryse) vs. Cesaro was a very competitive match with a lot of cool moments. The crowd was really into this match too. Miz was on offense for the first half of the match, then Cesaro ceased control and was able to get several believable near-falls. It seemed like he might win. I liked the brawl by Zayn and Owens just because it shows that their rivalry isn't over yet. The win by Miz was cheap, which fits his character since hes a cheap heel anyway. He should have to resort to cheating in order to win matches. It seems like this was done to set up a four way feud for the IC Title, which is fine by me. Im sick of the ROLL-UP OF DEATH~! finish. I think you can probably tell that if you read my stuff regularly. Doing it at least once on nearly every show is too much and they did it twice on this show counting the Kickoff show. The Dean Ambrose vs. Chris Jericho match was a really good match that was given a lot of time and lived up to high expectations that many of us had for it. They were able to put on a very entertaining match although at times it dragged a bit. I just think they were pacing themselves a bit since they were given a lot of time. Sometimes when wrestlers get 20 minutes there might be some boring spots, but in this case they were able to build up to an exciting finish. Ambrose getting the win was the right booking decision because hes lost quite a bit in the last few months. Jericho doesnt really need wins, so Ambrose winning clean was the right finish. If they do the match again, Ambrose should win that too. Ive enjoyed heel Jericho so much since he turned. Hes doing a great job even at 45 years old. Not easy to do. The WWE Womens Title: Charlotte (w/Ric Flair) vs. Natalya (w/Bret Hart) could have been a pretty good match, but re-doing the Montreal Screw-job is groan inducing. Its been nearly 20 years. Why go back to it? Weak. I liked the story of the match with Charlotte working over the leg for much of it and Natalya did well in terms of selling the hold. When Natalya got the momentum back at the end, the crowd really got behind her and I thought that they might do a title change. I actually predicted a title change, but got that wrong. Theyll probably do the match again at Extreme Rules. The WWE World Heavyweight Championship: Roman Reigns vs. AJ Styles was a very entertaining championship match even with two false finishes leading to restarts. It was a long match at around 25 minutes and its not that easy to go that long, but they were able to tell a good story. The champ retains as expected although it took a while to get to that point. The two restarts were done as a way to ensure a rematch in the future, which is fine by me because putting Styles in main event matches is a smart move. There were no clear answers in terms of who Anderson and Gallows may be working with, but thats okay. They don't have to rush through things. What I really liked about the match was all the near-falls with Styles coming so close to winning several times. Reigns isn't nearly as bad as his haters think. Hes not particularly great, but hes capable of having really good main event matches like he did at Fastlane two months ago and also right here. This was better than his WrestleMania match, thats for sure. These Reigns matches have such an interesting dynamic since hes booed so much yet not acting like a heel. It makes for a fun atmosphere because the crowd is into everything he does even when they want to boo him. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10",1465084800,,4887,4.272923408845739
8750048,4,B01BG7RLCA,"Enzo Amore & Colin Cassady vs. Vaudvillians - The New Day kicked off the show & was at ringside for the finals of their tournament to determine the new challengers for their Tag Team Championship in a match that went back & forth between both teams but never really left first gear due to an injury caused the match to end very suddenly.  The announce team continued to give updates throughout the night which thankfully was only a concussion & not worse than what it could have been.

Sami Zayn vs. Kevin Owens - A rivalry that goes back over a decade through different names & promotions with this being their first WWE PPV singles match.  Both started trading fist right from the start with both men being very aggressive both in the ring & outside using the environment around them to their advantage as they traded momentum with impactful moves including delivering the same move back to back & having counters for their opponents signature offense as it literally came down to one man being able to catch the other in a match that J.B.L. on commentary said, ""someone call the sheriff, they just stole the show!""

Intercontinental Champion The Miz vs. Cesaro - There was a special commentator who had an interest in this match as Cesaro was dominate early with his power including catching Miz in mid-air & athleticism such as reaching him on the top rope for a dropkick while executing strong strikes & submission attempts but Miz was able to take advantage of distractions focusing on an injured part of the body & attempting to neutralize his opponent's power advantage in a good match that was overshadowed by others who had unresolved issues going on at the same time.

Dean Ambrose vs. Chris Jericho - They traded momentum early with Dean using his trademark punches & kicks along with taking a page out of Jericho's own playbook mocking him at one point while Jericho used his signature offense from different submissions to going aerial as they kept going back & forth using their opponent's momentum against them & taking high risk just to put their opponent down utilizing counters on more than one occasion resulting in a competitive match.

Womens Champion Charlotte vs. Natayla - Charlotte had her dad, Ric Flair, in her corner as usual only for Natayla to have her uncle Bret Hart in hers for what was his first public appearance since beating cancer months earlier.  Both women were even early on with each woman catching the other off guard at some point trading big moves & submissions as Charlotte heavily focused on the legs while Natayla had a more diverse style that effected different parts of the body with both women showcasing their athleticism throughout the contest in a very good contest with the only downfall being the ending.

Right around here was when Shane & Stephanie pleaded their case to Mr. McMahon over who should run RAW only to get the decision only for both to get what they want & what they didn't want at the same time.

WWE Champion Roman Reigns vs. A.J. Styles - Both men showcased their different strategies in the early moments with Styles utilizing his speed with a ""hit & move"" style along with repeated kicks to the hamstring while Reigns showcased his superior strength that caused Styles to be knocked out of the ring & turned outside out followed by executing the same move in different ways making a statement as they traded momentum with both men being able to counter each other's trademark offense in unique ways along with Styles going aerial in various ways including one that had such an effect on Roman that it effected the rest of the match in more ways than one with both men getting more aggressive as the match went on & taking advantage of their surroundings weather it was objects or other people around ringside resulting in what was a highly competitive match with the only downfall being the decisions that were made during the match that only served the purpose of further pushing another storyline from earlier in the night.

(Kickoff Show) Dolph Ziggler vs. Baron Corbin - Dolph attempted to take the fight to Corbin only for him to shove it off & completely dominate using his power focusing on a part of the body he injured in the previous weeks with his attacks while openly bending the rules to his advantage & continuing to embarrass Dolph in the process while Dolph was able to fight back hitting some big moves in a solid match that was more about telling the story of Corbin being dominate but was still a rookie.

(Kickoff Show) United States Champion Kalisko vs. Ryback - A WrestleMania rematch with Ryback doing something ""special"" for the Chicago crowd making his entrance to the ring & started the match strong with a knockout punch at the bell & continued to use his size & strength such as using it to easily reverse his opponent's offense or tossing him around in the ring or on the outside along with delivering impactful moves including one off the top rope that launched his opponent higher than we've ever seen him before while Kalisko relied on his speed by using Ryback's own momentum against him & using his lucha libre offense along with high risk maneuvers from different areas of the ring resulting into some moves with heavy impact of his own in a match that used the same formula of ""David vs. Goliath"" but a different performance than their previous ones.

This was one of those PPV that was strong from start to finish in regards to the storytelling & performances with the only thing negative I can say is just how the storylines & finishes were booked ended up in some cases taking away or overshadowing the match itself.  In the end, if your can get past that & focus on the bell to bell action then this is an event worth checking out.",1462406400,,5748,4.66238894373149
