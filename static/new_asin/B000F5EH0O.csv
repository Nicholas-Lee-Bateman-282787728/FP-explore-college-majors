8117703,5,B000F5EH0O,The pacing was extremely pleasant and the sweep of a previous time exhilarating. I'll be watching his one again.,1458518400,,112,4.947368421052632

8117705,1,B000F5EH0O,"There's nothing good in this movie, boring all the way thru.
nothing sexual at all, if there was nudity I missed it.",1396915200,,116,4.318181818181818
8117706,4,B000F5EH0O,"This film is very close to five stars for me.  It is exquistely beautiful and lusciously erotic. For more than half the movie I was mesmerized.  My reservation is that there are, probably deliberately, a lot of mysteries and unexplained bits that add up to some unnecessary confusion.  I minded them more after the film was over than while I was caught up in its spell.  Leconte has become a favorite director, and I also love The Girl on the Bridge, Monsieur Hire, The Hairdresser's Husband, and The Man on the Train.",1253836800,2,518,4.5978260869565215
8117707,2,B000F5EH0O,I bought this movie expecting some kind of nostalgia or sensuality but ended up feeling depressed. It didn't work for me and the picture quality was not all that great.,1250640000,2,168,4.633333333333334
8117708,5,B000F5EH0O,"I looked up Sandra Majani (who is Dutch, by the way, which is why she speaks French with a slight accent) at Imdb to see if this gloriously beautiful woman has made any more movies and came up dry. Apparently, when she disappears at the end of this story, it's for good in more than one way. What a pity! On the other hand, maybe a real nobleman made her an offer she couldn't refuse and she is now happily married with children living in a castle somewhere as the Countess De ___. My hat is off to Leconte for discovering her and casting her in this amazing and insightful movie and photographing her so beautifully. Insightful because it proves that when a woman of such astounding beauty crosses a man's path, it will be all about her so he better thank his lucky stars and pay attention, to everything. Be careful what you say and what you do, because Beauty is not on a level playing field with anyone. Fail to see that at your peril. (The fellow is advised in the movie to ""watch her,"" to which I would have added ""watch yourself too."")

Spoilers:

The ""boy meets girl"" part of the story happens by accident as is fitting.  The ""boy gets girl"" part is nature taking its course.  The mutual attraction is obvious and the two stars have excellent rapport.  The ""boy loses girl"" part happens because he gets it into his head that he can behave like a jealous, demanding, possessive jerk and she'll just put up with it.  Dude, what were you thinking?  As the movie ends, all he has left are memories.  Of course, a great poet like Baudelaire would have tranformed all that into glorious poetry (and did).  How many people like that are there?  Right ... none.  Cinema will have to do for the time being.",1246320000,7,1705,4.398089171974522

8117710,2,B000F5EH0O,"Le Parfum d'Yvonne is a rare misfire from Patrice Leconte that doesn't really work on any level. The main problem with this remembrance of love lost is the casting: Jean-Pierre Marielle is fine as the archetypal ageing queen and matchmaker-cum-chaperone, but neither Hippolyte Girardot or Sandra Majani bring much to the lovers, leaving us with fragments of a vague relationship between two people we don't care about. Not painful, but lacking purpose and capped off with an absurd ending that seems to be there simply to give the film an exclamation point.

Second Sight's PAL UK DVD has no extras but does offera good subtitled transfer in the film's original 2.35:1 ratio.",1183248000,2,675,5.026785714285714
