8685026,1,B00OUF4UCK,"I was terribly disappointed by his collection of war propaganda. One of the DVD's refused to play, which was a blessing after viewing the rest.
No doubt a Neo Con wet dream. It had no resemblance to what really happened. Don't waste your money on this BS.

Try Nick Turse's Kill Anything that Moves.",1428364800,6,299,4.537037037037037
8685027,1,B00OUF4UCK,"Content is fine.  Actual quality of the DVD is terrible. Momentary freeze frames throughout and a few freeze frames which could not be cleared and I had to turn off the player to get the disc to unload.  I didn't return the product for a refund from Amazon as I am almost certain this wasn't a problem with my set alone, but one that likely affected all of the DVDs produced.  Feel free to relay my comments to the producers.",1425081600,7,425,4.2875
