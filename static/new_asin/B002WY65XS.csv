4008467,4,B002WY65XS,"For those fans who know the story about ""The Water Margin"" might enjoy this prequel even more. While ""The Water Margin"" was based on chapters 66-68 from the sprawling epic novel OUTLAWS OF THE MARSHES & featured many of the Liang Shan bandits, ""The Delightful Forest"" centered on hero ""Tiger Killer"" Wu Sung (played by Ti Lung in both movies). ""...Forest"" was based on chapter 24 & focused on Sung's exploits/initiation into the Liang Shan bandits.  This was co-directed by Chang Cheh & Pao Hsueh-Li, but I have a feeling Chang Cheh was the mastermind behind this classic.  Thanks to Kenneth Woo's liner notes for ""The Water Margin"" DVD.

Expertly choreographed by the Lau brothers & Chen Chuan, highlights include the opening restaurant brawl between Ti Lung & Lau Kar-Wing (Liu Chia-Yung) and the finale where Lung's white oufit is practically drenched in blood. We get to see Ti Lung's character show off his Mandarin Duck kick technique from ""The Water Margin"".  Although here it's called in the subtitles the Yin/Yang Feet & the Jade Green Steps techniques.  Needless to say, Sword Masters got their transfer from the widescreen, remastered Celestial version so it looks & sounds great. Audio is in either Mandarin (with remastered subs) or a decent English dub. Not really for fans of ""wire-fu"" or New Wave stuff, but if you're a fan of the Shaws or Chang Cheh, purchase it - NOW.",1278720000,5,1386,4.8559322033898304
4008468,4,B002WY65XS,"I received my disc today and the bad news is that yes, there are some minor issues.  I watched this on a Sony BDP-S370.  Around the 1:55 mark I had a fluttering artifact on the screen for a half second.  I replayed that section to confirm it was there.  There was a also a kind of stuttering that lasted a second in a later  scene which I again replayed to verify.  Infrequently there was a tiny jerkiness but it didn't really detract from the movie; I only mention it in the interest of being complete.

The good news is that the colors pop and the detail is excellent.  The sound was very good as well.  Overall it is a solid disc but probably not up to the standards of people used to $25 blu-ray discs released by major studios.  If you watch older kung fu flicks and have suffered through washed-out colors and crappy VHS transfers and cropped frames you will love it.

This is a very inexpensive disc and my viewing experience did not suffer greatly from the minor imperfections. I'll probably keep the disc unless I can be sure of getting a flawless one in exchange. YMMV.

4008469,5,B002WY65XS,"(9/14/10 update!) This Blu-ray Disc of the Shaw Brothers classic ""The Delightful Forest"" (1972, directed by Chang Cheh and Pao Hsueh-li) is one of four Blu-ray Discs now available from Well Go USA for purchase at Amazon, and, initially, there were technical problems with this release. In the case of the first copy that was given to me, playback of the picture was hampered by brief moments of breaking up (pixilation of some kind) within thirty minutes of the viewing. The picture never froze, so I played it through with no further complications. Since then, Well Go worked out the bugs the best they could on the disc, offering consumers a new copy if they mailed in their bad copies right to the company! My replacement copy, and an additional one I bought for a friend (from Amazon), played well without any complications. With the  newer pressing, a copy you get now should be okay, but be on the alert if you DO get a bad one. (Go to Well Go's website for details on exchanging faulty discs.)

Well Go USA's BD of ""TDF"" is an AMAZING improvement over the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Delightful-Forest-SHAW-BROTHERS/dp/B002WY65XS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Delightful Forest **SHAW BROTHERS**</a>&nbsp;DVD! If Well Go got complaints about the doctored soundtracks on the DVD, they corrected them here with the English dub and the Mandarin dub BOTH in strong, UNTOUCHED mono! Yes, all the extra music and foley are GONE here, and they are NOT missed!

The picture is much sharper on the BD; it's 1080i (interlaced), NOT 1080p (progressive). Also, many visual issues that couldn't be resolved back in 1972 can't be corrected via the BD mastering (occasional blurriness due to the equipment Shaw's cameramen had to utilize), so the disc is a near-perfect visual experience. Regardless, after Tokyo Shock's BDs for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deadly-Duo-Blu-Ray-Blu-ray/dp/B002T08R7W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deadly Duo Blu-Ray [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heroes-Two-Blu-ray/dp/B003EAWH9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heroes Two (Blu-ray)</a>, it's my opinion this movie looks even BETTER than the BEST Shaw DVDs from Dragon Dynasty and Tokyo Shock do, and we know how GREAT they look! (This disc will likely be bettered with Well Go's 1080p BD of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Men-Are-Brothers-Dub-Blu-ray/dp/B003TVTRS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All Men Are Brothers (Dub) [Blu-ray</a>].)

The English subtitles are different from the DVDs in that they're done in another, smaller font that doesn't take up the space they do on the DVD. Beyond that, the BD subs have the same translation as on the DVD.

With my new and improved copy, I got MORE out of my viewing experience on the BD than the DVD because everything (especially the soundtracks) was ORIGINAL, which is how MOST enjoy seeing a classic Shaw Brothers martial arts movie (any ""old school"" classic, really)! Even if it's only 1080i, it's still one of the BEST reissues of a Shaw movie ever done, hands down! So it is I give this UPGRADE the maximum of five ""stars""!

An essential purchase, and one of Ti Lung's best movies EVER!

All the best, Brother Fang.

In 1972, three Shaw Brothers films featuring stories excerpted from the epic Chinese novel ""Outlaws of the Marsh"" (a.k.a. ""The Water Margin"") were released: the previously-mentioned epic, one-third of ""Trilogy of Swordsmanship"" and ""The Delightful Forest"". In terms of the book (according to Woo), the events depicted occur early in the story; in terms of MOVIES, ""TDF"" is a ""pre-quel"" to ""TWM"", centering on the Liang Shan bandit Wu Sung (""The Tiger Killer""), played by Ti Lung. If you liked his [limited] role in the latter movie, then ""TDF"" is a must-see!

Simply put, you get some backstory on Wu Sung (and how he wound up the way we see him in ""TWM"") in this well-executed film, co-directed by Chang Cheh and Pao Hsueh-li. (They're two of the three directors of ""TWM""--Wu Ma is the third--but as things go, we KNOW Cheh was the ""maestro"" for BOTH movies!) The combination of action and plot is strong with strategic placing of humorous bits adding to the whole mix; only a slight lapse in the script (by Cheh, Ni Kuang and Chin Shu-mei) before the finale crimps an otherwise solid story!

After Tong Gaai and Lau Kar Leung, Lau Kar Wing and Chen Chuan contribute fight choreography, and it's all dazzling as it is [often] brutal. The intensity of the violence (as it's captured by the cinematographer and presented by the film editor) does compare strongly with the best work of the ""Venoms""; I'd even go as far to say ""TDF"" seems MORE violent than ""TWM""!

Great performances are plentiful here with no ""clinker"" in this fine cast (not always the case with most Shaw productions). It's nearly hard to believe the same guy who was ""King Eagle"" is this variable of a ""drunken kung-fu"" master, that's how impressive Ti Lung's acting is. (If his role here is compared with the other ""wandering swordsmen"" like Jimmy Wang Yu and David Chiang, then he OBLITERATES Chiang and just EDGES out Wang Yu!) Chu Mu comes off more ROTTEN here as the main ""heavy"" Jiang Zhong (nicknamed ""Jiang Mun San"", or ""God of the Door"") than he ever did in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heroes-Two/dp/B0012R1R1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heroes Two</a>, and that INCLUDES his fighting! Of the two women in the whole feature (Chiang Ling is the other), Yu Feng's precious few minutes on-screen combine above-average acting with a PALPABLE sexiness in her small part as the wife of an ally of Wu Sung; it's too bad she didn't do many more movies after this. Of course, many familiar Shaw faces round up the rest of the players, too many to bring up in this limited space.

The DVD (remastered by Celestial Pictures) IS anamorphic 2.35:1, and the picture is pretty sharp. The Mandarin audio track (including good subtitles with few typos) is MORE enhanced here (that's music PLUS sound effects) than on most of Well Go/Shaw DVDs, and the English dub has limited tampering; still, for screwing up the soundtracks, I take a ""star"" off in my rating. As it went with Well Go's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heroes-Shed-No-Tears/dp/B002WY65YC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heroes Shed No Tears</a>, there is NO ""Original trailer"".

Those who enjoy Ti Lung and ""TWM"" will not regret buying this at all; as for the uninitiated, you need not get ""TWM"" in order to help you enjoy ""TDF"" as the movie's story works on its own merits. It makes for one GREAT first look, and repeat viewings will reinforce how well done this movie is! It's not a big extravaganza like ""TWM"" or ""The Heroic Ones"" are, but it IS another small, testosterone-fueled ""gem"" from the directing genius of Chang Cheh [and Pao Hsueh-li]!

All the best, Brother Fang.",1268352000,14,3997,5.245696400625978

The action was intense with plenty of blood for hardcore, die hard Kung Fu fans.  Ti Lung is lightning fast and shows off his skills as a martial artist.  On par with the ""Venoms"" for those of you in the know, not to mention incredibly handsome for the female Kung Fu fans out there in Amazon. I highly recommend this one to all fans of Kung Fu.

But...bad DVD. The transfer is fine, but due to concerns about the rights to the music (they lifted Morricone's score from OUATITW), perhaps, or just to make an easy transition to stereo, a synth track is inserted OVER the existing soundrack, making a horrible, distracting audio mess. It's brutal and renders the film almost unwatchable with the sound on.

4008489,1,B002WY65XS,"When Well Go USA originally released The Delightful Forest on Blu-ray in early 2010, all copies were unfortunately defective due to a bad glass master used for disc replication. Well go USA acknowledged the problem and quickly set up a replacement program. Also, all affected stock sent out to retailers was supposedly recalled. All should be well now, but over two years after being released on Blu-ray, even now defective copies of this title still exist on the market.

I recently purchased my own copy of The Delightful Forest from Amazon, assuming the disc would be fine after all this time, only to receive a copy that glitched and froze on my player. I tried to contact distributor Well Go USA through their website about obtaining a fixed replacement, but after two weeks have not received a response. They also took down their webpage detailing the replacement program, suggesting that the program has ended and they are no longer sending out fixed replacements. I ended up exchanging the title for a replacement through Amazon, but as expected received only another defective copy. It now looks like Amazon is selling old, unsold stock from other retailers that was never recalled as intended. Even worse, they probably received the old stock from distributor Well Go USA, which wouldn't be a big issue if only it was clearer whether or not the replacement program was still in place.

If you have any interest at all in this Blu-ray, DO NOT BUY from Amazon. You're better off taking a chance with other retailers who might have fresher stock, although with Well Go USA possibly sending out defective copies again to retailers, there really are no guarantees. Which is too bad, because the first few minutes of this movie that I was able to watch before it froze were actually pretty good.

Like most of Shaw Brothers' 1000 plus movies, this production was also staged in the company's various studios. The tired storyline and the lack of any jaw-dropping ku-fu actions really couldn't ease the claustrophobic feel that a lot of Shaw Brothers' movies frequently impact on the audience consciously and unconsciously.",1326412800,,534,5.068181818181818

Granted, they were very good and featured sometimes spectacular choreography, but in between those I found myself wondering what else I could be watching. Overall picture quality was excellent considering the age of the picture. A couple places I thought lost clarity and had downright blurry backgrounds, but overall a decent picture. The sound is what you would expect, some crackling but again very good and forgivable considering the age. I suppose if you are really into these types of movies its worth picking up, but I personally think only the die-hard fans of this genre will enjoy it. Personally, unless it's a really captivating story, I'm in it just for the fights, and this one didn't do it for me. One thing to note, a couple times during the movie the picture got REALLY bad just for a moment. If it was a VCR tape you'd have thought that the machine was eating the movie, but then it would clear up. Not sure what caused it but something to note. I'm very excited to see the old Shaw bro's films being released on BR and I hope to see more, just didn't really care for this one.",1303257600,,1234,4.488888888888889

After an encounter in one of the restaurants where the brute's wife is working, he draws out Chu Mu. And from there, there's confrontations & deception which leads to the bloody finish. Ti Lung is on top on his skills in this classic SB flick. Chu Mu is not nearly his equal but played his part as the town's antagonist.
