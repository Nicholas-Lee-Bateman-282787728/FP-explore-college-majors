3862677,2,B00277Q2UQ,"Tilda Swinton was great. For me,this thing went on far too long. Obviously inspired by Cassavete's Gloria. By the end I wasn't quite sure what it wanted to be,But I was falling asleep. Didn't care about any of these characters.",1250726400,3,227,4.7
3862678,5,B00277Q2UQ,"Wow. This is a dazzling performance in an unusual, disturbing and unforgettable film. I was fortunate to see this at a brief theatrical run in San Francisco. I haven't seen the disc but I'll update this review when I do.
Usually, I get the feeling that Ms. Swinton says ""I'll do anything!"" but that the people who make her films think she'll do EVERYTHING and show up without the ideas, structure or stamina to support her wild excursions into darkness and beyond. This film gives her a meaty role in a difficult story and gives it room to grow. The film is kind of a long shaggy dog story, rather like John Cassavetes directing a Sam Peckinpah film.
This JULIA is a nasty, promiscuous, unemployable black out alcoholic who ends up talked into a kidnapping scheme by the crazy unfit mother who lives in her building. If you think this might be your sort of film, be aware- she doesn't become a saint- or even much nicer- over the playing time. When most American films would be wrapping up, JULIA explodes into a new location, country, style and multiplies in ferocity and violence. Instead of softening into redemption, our heroine meets characters even nastier than she is and is forced to up the stakes.
This is the best female performance I've seen since Mimi Rogers in THE RAPTURE. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. I can't wait to see it again.",1249257600,67,1363,4.590163934426229

3862700,4,B00277Q2UQ,"Solid acting from the entire cast as Swinton has us following her around like a puppy waiting to see what she will do next.

3862702,2,B00277Q2UQ,"Hilariously bad. I've seen and enjoyed Tilda Swinton in other movies, so figured I'd try this one. Yikes. She does a whole lot of scenery-chewing from the very beginning. And, her scenes with the actress playing the kidnap victim's mother (who also overacts) are like a car wreck -- sad, but you keep watching anyway. This film is TOO long (2 1/2 hours). I kept watching to see how bad it could get (real bad), but then ended up fast-forwarding through a lot of it. Acting students should watch this as a study in over-acting. When acting: dial it back, dial it back, dial it back.",1474243200,,581,4.490566037735849

3862748,2,B00277Q2UQ,"Not even Tilda Swinton could save this poor excuse for a movie. Her presence is the only reason it gets two stars instead of one. LONG and boring and totally pointless barely begin to describe this turkey. Swinton's character is an alcoholic who couldn't tell the truth if someone had a gun to her head. I swear, every single word her character says in this movie is a lie. I was honestly hoping that her character would get killed at the end. I won't say whether she does or not, in case those who are reading this haven't watched the movie yet. But my advice - skip this movie and watch Swinton in We Need to Talk About Kevin. Now there's a movie that will punch you in the gut. Unlike this one, which simply bores you to death.",1473379200,,730,4.258992805755396

3862750,1,B00277Q2UQ,"Tilda Swinton, what were you thinking?  Telling this dreadful story is not a bad thing, but the small details should be believable, or why do I care? I'm amazed that there is always money in her purse to buy beer, drinks, etc. that is part of the challenge of this addiction, yet it just magically appears.",1473292800,,306,4.464285714285714
3862751,3,B00277Q2UQ,"This is a ""Mr. Toad's Wild Ride"" of a movie, lots of twists & turns at a frenetic pace.  A tour de force for Ms. Swinton, Bravo !  I would have given it more stars if it would have been more tightly edited.",1473292800,,206,3.7674418604651163

3862766,2,B00277Q2UQ,"Could have been a good movie, interesting plot, acting ability was there in spades.  But the plot just kept getting more and more absurd.  Remember the old gag about a giraffe is a horse designed by a committee?  I got the impression there were several writers involved, each of whom kept wresting control of the script so they could pursue whatever weird notion happened to pop into their brain at that moment.

I am glad to ""suspend disbelief"" to enjoy a story.  But I have no desire to just toss all reason and logic and everything else out the window.  I'm not familiar with the lead actress but I get the impression she could do a great job with a solid script... I'll keep an eye out for her.",1473120000,,698,4.372093023255814

The Brits must have some completely different way of training actors to end up with people like Tilda Swinton, Helen Mirren and Judi Dench.

Julia associates with s unsavory characters, spurns and really human associations and is so cruel that  I almost stopped watching . I thought  I would  let it the video play thinking that I would just getting a chore done but got hooked.  I had to go back and had to watch the movie to conclusion.  Turns out that the craziness and unlikeableness of Tilda Swanson's character, played by Tilda Swanson are necessary to the plot.

The movie is full of suspense and  dangerous situations, but the lead character of Julia is herself so evil that one does not really worry  too much what becomes of her.  That gives the mood a bit of a lift because no matter what evil character she encounters, Julia has already topped their act.

3862835,5,B00277Q2UQ,"This movie is spectacular!! Tilda Swinton should've definitely won an Academy award for her role in this, in my own opinion.  She plays this aging, washed up, hard-partying American woman (not even a hint of a British accent, and my hat's off to her for that too, because I imagine it's no small feat), who has a serious drinking problem.  While attempting to sober up and attend AA meetings, she begins a conversation with another woman at the meeting, an discovers this woman is also her neighbor.  This neighbor woman has gotten her son taken away from her, and offers Julia money to get him back.  Being the money hungry, selfish alcoholic that she is in this movie, Julia quickly takes the woman up on her offer, without really stopping to think about any details or plans.  I don't want to say anymore for fear of giving too much away, but this movie will make you cringe, cry, sit on the edge of your seat, lift you up and make you cry again.  It's definitely not for the faint of heart, and it WILL stick with you for many months, if not years, to come.",1405641600,,1061,4.415384615384616
3862836,2,B00277Q2UQ,"Julia is a ridiculously overlong movie for its subject matter - at almost 2 1/2 hours the movie could have easily lost 45-60 minutes without suffering at all. In fact, by the time you get half way through the movie you are earmarking entire scenes that are completely superfluous to the film (for example, the scene of the kid watching cockroaches in the bathroom of a Mexican hotel). As other reviewers have pointed out, there are many similarities to John Cassavetes' Gloria (although I'd stop short of saying that this is a remake), but in the case of Julia the screenplay just seems to get more and more absurd as it progresses, with situations that range from plain silly to completely unbelievable. What's left is a no-holds-barred performance by Tilda Swinton, and this may be enough for her fans and admirers. Unfortunately, she is done in by a character who not only is completely unsympathetic (which in itself is no crime - awards have been given for such performances), but also whose actions are so ludicrous that this viewer completely lost patience, and it was by sheer will power alone that I did not make use of the fast-forward button.",1387411200,4,1153,4.77

All of it played out to her to solve herself. And yes, it's indulgent. But plot and character conjoin to decide her- theme and plot and character become one. What does she decide? It could have been more dark to convince of her. Or, did she get bit by fate? Maybe I wanted her to be less terrible. All movies play with you.

3862840,5,B00277Q2UQ,"This was by far one of the most riveting films I have seen in 20 years. Mind you I didn't even know who Tilda Swinton was. Never even heard of her, so I am not making a review that is biased in any way. This film is tense, emotional, and simply powerfull. Swinton's performance was incredible, truly incredible! This was an oscar caliber performance every step of the way. The film is intensly realistic, often nail chewing, and simply solid exciting cinema. The film is so good that I feel complelled to call it a masterpiece. Maybe it's not that good but it's simply one of those films that grabs you by the throat and never let's you go. it's one of those films that comes along every decade that you will likely never forget. One thing that kept runing through my mind is that I kept imagining Uma Thurman in this role, and it's likely she may have been considered at one point or another. I think this film would have earned Thurman an oscar if she had taken the role, and if you know Uma's work, there is no doubt that you'll picture Uma in this role. In fact I am pretty certain Uma's bride in Tarantino's Kill Bill volume II was probably used as a role model to base this character on. Swinton even wears a leather jacket that is nearly identicle to the one Thurman wore in Vol II. The acting by everyone is way above average, the locations, directing, script, everything was way above average. I loved this film and consider it probably one of the best films of the past 15 years. I hope you'll see it and agree.",1367625600,,1521,4.340350877192982

3862844,1,B00277Q2UQ,"The film started out giving me some mild interest due to the craziness of Julia's life and what alcoholism can do to you. When the movie entered a woman going into such brutal treatment towards an 11 or 12 year old boy, the imagery was too sickening for me. I understand realism is important but I really don't want to watch an adult woman give a kid knock out pills saying, ""it's good for you"" along with other bizzare heartless treatment.

I started off hoping I would develop empathy for Julia but the film crashed and turned into a hideous mess. It might be considered a unique indie style endeavor and I suppose some enjoy these portrayals but it just isn't my bag and was quite a turn off.",1345161600,3,695,4.387596899224806

3862846,4,B00277Q2UQ,"This sort of thing has been done before: A woman is in charge of a child under extreme circumstances. This is one of the better ones and it really made me nervous to watch.

Here's the scoop. Tilda Swinton is Julia. She's an alcoholic spiraling out of control.  While at an AA meeting she meets up with a woman who tries to enlist her to try and re-connect her with her estranged child through a kidnapping. She figures she can do the kidnapping and get a huge amount of money. Of course, things don't go as planned.

This is a character driven movie. The plot elements come into being because of her. It's not as though the writer tried to jam the character into the plot. This is Swinton's movie. She has created, for my dollar, one of the all time great characters. She's smart and street savvy but her alcoholism keeps getting in the way. The entire scam could have gone much more smoothly were she not such an abysmal screw-up. I cannot recall seeing her play a character anything like this before and it's unsettling. The lying. The making excuses. The weaseling gave me white knuckles because I feared the worst on how it would all turn out.

This is an ugly movie. It deals with a class of people you want nothing to do with. Most are stupid, mean, violent or just plane nuts. You know the kind of doo-doo you're in for. But it's done well. It has a good look and feel to it. This doesn't have the ring of a slick Hollywood outing. You're down in the gutter with these people. The thing going here is Tilda Swinton. She gives the performance of a lifetime.

This is a gritty crime drama. If you like this sort of thing this is about as good as it gets.",1340323200,,1660,4.3076923076923075

She definitely should have been nominated for an Acadamy Award and probably should have won, although I liked Kate Winslet in The Reader also. Unlike some of the other reviews, I very much liked the ending, as it redeemed her character.  I do not necessarily care for movies about drunks, drug addicts and so on, but this one was so well-done, and shifted the focus to the hair-brained kidnapping scheme, such that it was more of a thriller than an addict story, although her alcohol addiction plays a prominent part in how she behaves.

3862852,5,B00277Q2UQ,"OK, Gloria is my favorite Cassavetes movie and the remake with Sharon Stone some years back is just plain awful.  Julia is an homage to the original but a ride so wild, so savage, so over the top, it just makes your head spin.  Gena Rowlands had some class (her clothes were gorgeous) whereas Tilda Swinton is about as unlovely as you can get. She stumbles, she is ugly, she is sloppy and guttery and you can practically smell the alcohol seeping out the pores of her skin.  She is the only one, the only unbelievably stupid person in an ongoing AA meeting to actually believe a nearly crazy Latina alcoholic who wants to kidnap her son from his father.  And so begins the journey.  Kidnap the kid and get rich quick.  How we can find any compassion in our hearts for this Julia--wicked, sly (but not clever), vulnerable only when sleeping, nasty piece of work--but we do. I would not say we are rooting for her but she touches our hearts against all odds and all evidence.

Zonca's earlier movie The Dream Life of Angels is one of my favorites, and I was thrilled when there was a new movie.  I loved it that he had a co-director and someone else billed as a collaborator--sure wish I knew the backstory to those credits.  Dream Life gets mentioned pretty often considering the short memory span of movie-goers so for some cinephiles, his work shines on despite limited theatrical release.

I waited a few years between viewings.  It is never like the first time but a few years with some thousands of films in between, the movie will have some freshness.  Aside from the Gloria aspects, I was reminded of Toback and his crazy-wonderful movies like Fingers and A Guy and Two Girls where the action is fast and furious and feels as if the words just flew out of the actors' mouths and didn't come from a script.

I've loved Swinton in several movies: The Deep End, Michael Clayton and the newest in Italian (which she produced) called I Am Love. I don't think there are too many leading ladies (not character actors) but leading ladies who will allow themselves to be photographed so unattractively, to show the ravages of an aging body and face, to give themselves over to the demands of a brutal script.",1291075200,,2205,4.537878787878788
3862853,5,B00277Q2UQ,"First of all, let me just say that the fact that Tilda Swinton was snubbed an Oscar nomination last year for her riveting and colossally brilliant performance in `Julia' just proves once and for all (well, it's been proven many times actually) that the members of the academy aren't watching the right movies.  I had heard all the raves and I was prepared for greatness, but she really is stunningly perfect in this role; completely void of all vanity and stripped bare boned, completely in the moment.  What I found so wonderful about the film though, was that it didn't simply rely wholly on Swinton to carry it.  Sure, there are some plot improbabilities that strip it of a little integrity, but overall this film itself works very hard to keep up with Swinton in deserving your attention.

You will never guess what happens next.

That is one rarity that I really enjoyed about `Julia'.  It kept me guessing the entire time.  It won me over with every plot twist and new development because it fit without being predictable.  Sure, the ending was a tad comparable to a `sellout' (the single worst component to the film outside of Kate del Castillo's inconsistently unbearable performance), but it really isn't the ending as much as the last line of dialog that kind of dampens the film impact.

Really, just know that while Swinton is the best thing about this film, she is not the only reason to watch it.

`Julia' tells the story of Julia Harris; an alcoholic who is uncontrollably selfish and completely reprehensible.  The first thirty minutes or so of the film simply introduce us to her lifestyle and help us to, well, dislike her.  I love the performance and the treatment of Julia so much because we are never given a single reason to sympathize with her (well, until the end which is kind of expected even if it was a tad disappointing).  We are basically told from the beginning that Julia is an awful person.  Swinton makes sure that we believe that.  When Julia is approached by a fellow AA member who is in dire need of some help, she finds herself neck deep in a LOT of trouble.  Before she knows it, Julia has kidnapped an eight-year-old boy and is holding him for ransom.

But, Julia keeps digging that hole of hers deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper.

The plot is so rich with originality (I mean, this material was so much stronger than I expected) that I'm just completely blown away that more people aren't campaigning this film.  Yes, some of the sequences in the film run a little improbable, and some of the films overall dynamic is lost in the endings attempt at humanizing Julia, but many of the films core aspects are remarkably unique.  Deciding to create a film that centers around a woman so despicable yet utterly human was a risk that I am SO glad Erick Zonca took.",1288742400,,2805,4.605633802816901

3862855,3,B00277Q2UQ,"Warning:spoiler alert in this review.

I'm very ambivalent about this film. Tilda Swinton is excellent in the part of Julia, an alcoholic woman who can't really make it from day to day. She has blackouts, goes home with a variety of men and finally hits a low point after being fired from her job. She is vulnerable and desperate enough to fall for a scheme to kidnap a woman's child. The woman wants her son back and meets Julia at an AA meeting. She promises a veritable fortune if Julia will find a way to get her son. Unfortunately, the mother disappears from the film as soon as the kidnapping takes place. At this point, Julia decides to pull off a ransom attempt,hoping to get some money from the kidnapping. As the film goes on, she goes from being a frightening figure to the boy (Tom) to a more nurturing woman. Meanwhile, the mother of the child has her face plastered all over the national news and is on the run.

Events aren't predictable for most of the film and it held my attention and was definitely suspenseful. Then came the ending. I'd have given this one a higher rating if that ending hadn't been so vague. I assumed that Julia was going to give Tom back to his grandfather, the rich relative with millions at his disposal, but this was not spelled out. Julia just walks away, holding Tom, promising him that she'd take him back to his ""mother"". This made the film disappointing on so many levels. Others may disagree. Perhaps the ""message"" was that Julia, a woman at loose ends, has found no answers to solve her problems and is resigned to giving Tom back to the authorities -and his loving grandfather- and then get turn herself in. Maybe she is never going to be able to make plans and have them succeed and her life will always go off track. But the interpretation is left to the viewer.",1285891200,,1815,4.463855421686747
3862856,3,B00277Q2UQ,This was not the best movie I've seen.  Tilda is a great actess - that is why I bought this DVD.,1276560000,,96,3.5714285714285716
3862857,4,B00277Q2UQ,"I have never really gone to see a movie because Tilda Swinton was in it.  She just happened to be in movies I went to see, and her performance were always excellent, and that is why when I saw this movie in the store I decided to get it on the strength of what she did previously.

I am glad I did because if there is any movie to see because Tilda Swinton is in it, Julia is it.

Even though this movie was never destined to be big, her performance is a wonder to behold.

The realistic portrayal of a lost alcoholic, who cannot tell the truth about anything starts out ordinary but turns into something compelling, as a woman she meets in AA convinces her to kidnap her son.  As the story unfolds and takes its dramatic twists and turns, we follow along incredulous and unbelieving at her impulsive behavior, and how everything just gets worse and worse.  To tell you more might spoil your enjoyment, but suffice to say you will wonder how it's going to end until the end.  I think this was one of the best female perfomances I have seen in the last year.

I appreciated how much she immersed herself in this character, casting vanity to the four winds.  There is a particular scene where she breaks the Hollywood leading actress convention of not fully exposing herself, as she lies in the bed in a house in Mexico and her 7 year old victim is looking at her with wonder and fascination, and we wonder what he is going to do next.  What does happen next is another surprising plot twist.

So, this movie does seem a little long, and the early part drags, but once it gets going it is great.

I love when an actress can play a truly yucky character but you still care about her. Bette Davis was often able to do this. And because it is an independent film you have no idea where the story is going to go...EXCEPT, that it won't have a phony hollywood ending...In retrospect I almost feel Tilda Swinton's 'character' wrote the plot so it seemed very organic...
 Rent it for Tilda!",1266451200,,501,4.693181818181818
3862859,4,B00277Q2UQ,"You might not find this movie very engaging at first, because Tilda Swinton's character is so sloppily amoral. It's hard to care about her odyssey through different binges, frantic street-corner drug deals, and the violent desperation she visits upon the young mother who asks for her help.

However, after Swinton launches off alone onto her largely improvised kidnapping campaign, she reveals new layers to her character, and the film becomes much more interesting. Swinton pulls off an acting tour de force. She creates a unique character that is the very definition of ""gutsy lady.""

The plot is a little messy, like the mean streets of Tijuana themselves where Swinton feverishly veers as the movie careens towards a conclusion. This adds another kind of grim realism to the action. But you'll get a good feel of what it's like to tour some of the more dangerous districts of that notorious border town.

After having gotten the viewer rapt in sympathy with Swinton's character, the bonus features on this disc drop us back down to some sense of disillusionment. Several of the deleted scenes seem to come out of another movie altogether. These tend to show that the writers/director of ""Julia"" didn't start the project with any consistent artistic vision - that they changed plans and veered as chaotically as the main character herself does in reaction to each new contingency. But I suppose as long as the end product has the satisfying momentum that it does - what difference do its beginnings make?",1262822400,,1508,4.976190476190476
3862860,5,B00277Q2UQ,"Ten years ago, I saw a relatively unknown/obscure French film made in 1998 called ""The Dreamlife of Angels.""  After seeing such masterful filmmaking, I eagerly awaited writer-director Erick Zonca's next film.  Ten long years later, he has come back with ""Julia,"" and I must say, it was worth the wait.  (He did make a film in between, but to my knowledge the film was never released here in the U.S.)

Clearly, Zonca has grown as a filmmaker since then.  He manages to keep the same raw, realistic, documentary style, but is now spreading his wings blending it with visual compositions that are highly expressionistic.

He still has the same strength in creating engaging female protagonists, and working with Tilda Swinton, who acts the heck out of the role, he creates a character that is at first, utterly unlikeable: she's an alcoholic on par with Nicolas Cage from ""Leaving Las Vegas.""  If you think this is going to be another tale of desparation, you'd be half-right.

Pretty soon a plot as twisty as anything Mamet has written, and as dramatically gritty as the Dardenne brothers, emerges and what starts out as a drama is merely the set-up for a thriller-drama that is really something special.

As a viewer, it's easy to be horrified by Julia's behavior (Tilda Swinton) but like Aaron Eckhart's breakthrough performance in ""In the Company of Men,"" she makes this horrific character so engaging I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, and at the end of the day, she emerges as sympathetic, changed, and most of all--human: flawed, but very human.

And if one stellar performance wasn't enough, Aiden Gould, a child actor, plays his character Tommy without an ounce of pretense or preciousness.  It's the kind of brilliant child performance that deserves awards, much like Swinton's.

One warning: this film is not for the faint of heart.  There are some very difficult scenes involving mistreating a child and it goes to some very (thematically and plot-wise) dark places.",1258934400,,1981,4.930722891566265
3862861,4,B00277Q2UQ,"Tilda plays Julia, an alcoholic who manages to scrape by day-to-day.

However, Julia has plans of her own and double-crosses her neighbor for more money.  As you might expect, things don't go as Julia planned, and she gets deeper and deeper in legal trouble.

Tilda accurately depicts the life of an alcoholic and the self-destruction and chaos that goes with that lifestyle.  Swinton is one of this generation's best actors, and it is a lot of fun to watch her become rabid in this role.  In this role she is at times extremely selfish, other times very tender in her interaction with her kidnapped victim.

She is also great in ""Young Adam"".",1257897600,,803,4.692857142857143

If she were a druggie/crack whore, so highly strung out, I could understand her going to extremes not to mention a white toothpick woman like Tilda would stick out worse than a sore thumb in TJ, Mexico.  I don't believe a simple alcoholic would stoop so low, so quickly, and so hard.  And if you're reading this review Tilda, my tongue is all yours.  I love you baby.",1257206400,,564,4.544554455445544

3862864,4,B00277Q2UQ,"In its opening scenes, ""Julia"" establishes itself as the tale of a drunk teetering between damnation and redemption.

As such, it carries some of the same tension and dread that 1983's ""The Verdict"" did.  In that movie, the task facing Paul Newman's drunken lawyer was to prove himself competent at winning a trial.  The task for Tilda Swinton, in her titular role as Julia, is to prove that her character can competently pull off a kidnapping, and protect a child.

I won't give a synopsis of the plot in this review, as others have already done that. I think it suffices to say that Tilda Swinton ""acts her buns off"" in this movie, and once again proves herself one of the best and most daring actresses of her time.  I can't think of another actress who could pull this kind of role off with so much panache, except perhaps for Susan Sarandon.

Swinton acts the role of the ""female desperado"" as effortlessly as Sarandon did in ""Thelma and Louise.""  Supporting roles are stellar, too.  Saul Rubinek, as Julia's friend and her sole moral influence, is particularly good.  Kate Del Castillo, as Elena, the flaky but affecting mother of the kidnapped child is also excellent.

Director Eric Zonca creates a loose slice-of-life drama with a lot of hand-held, up close and intimate camera work.  Many of the scenes have a semi-improvised feel to them, and Zonca shows a great eye for the telling detail, such as the long cigarette burns on Julia's bathtub or a child in a bus depot distractedly combing her hair.  The scenes in Mexico also are brutally honest in the depiction of a society where trouble will easily find the non-vigilant.

Because the movie is rather loose-knit (we are never informed as to what becomes of Elena, for example), and because Julia's behavior with an innocent child is so unhinged and erratic, most viewers will find this movie uncomfortable to watch.  Because it is overly long, I can't give the movie 5 stars...but ultimately this struggle between a corrosive, burnt-out drunk and her hidden maternal instincts will reward those who stick with it.",1256515200,3,2078,4.800561797752809
3862865,3,B00277Q2UQ,"That's ""The Lost Weekend"" to gringos, and what a weekend (give or take) it is!  Tilda Swinton is a force of nature in this 'Cassavetes-inspired' gritty road drama about an incorrigible alcoholic who kidnaps an acquaintance's child and goes on the lam to Mexico, intending to extort a huge ransom out of the boy's wealthy industrialist grandfather.  Swinton is uncomfortably brilliant as Julia, an out-of-control addict who will lie, cheat, steal and sleep with anyone she has to to get a fix or get cash, since her addiction has left her too erratic to hold on to a job.  Swinton is by turns shocking, repulsive, heartbreaking and winsome in her portrayal of a lost woman whose life came unravelled at the seams years ago, and all she's capable of truly caring about now is where she's going to score her next drink.  Swinton has a face that is fluidly changeable before the camera, so that she can appear as a wrecked angel one moment and a raging demon the next.  Here she's so good at playing a trashy, low-class addict, one marvels that this is the same actress who gave us the icily regal Winter Witch in ""Chronicles of Narnia"" or the polished high-octane career women of ""Adaptation"" or ""Michael Clayton"".  Like Cate Blanchett, Swinton possesses striking, unconventional looks and coloring that she harnesses to create a breathtaking range of characters.  My admiration for her is boundless.  I can't, however, rate the movie she's in as highly as I do her performance--this is a meandering mess of a movie that reflects the meandering mess that is Julia's life and psyche, but it would have benefitted greatly from a tighter script and more self-disciplined editing decisions.  2-and-half hours is self-indulgently long on the part of director Erik Zonca; turns out that it's just too long to watch a little boy get traumatized at the hands of an unstable, self-serving drunk and a bunch of Mexican mercenaries.  I understand what drew actor's actor Swinton to this character, but the story does not engage the viewer as much as it did those who made it, evidently.  I muscled all the way to the end, hoping for some glimmers of recognizable humanity or redemption in our antiheroine, and they were not forthcoming.  Honestly one of the more interminable film viewing experiences of my life that seemed as if it would never end.  In my experience, good movies fly by quickly and leave the viewer wanting more.  This bloated, low-budget descent into madness with a loco lady in the driver's seat left me completely dispossesed.  Tilda Swinton is a fantastic actress; unfortunately this project is too low-rent to garner her the acting accolades she deserves for it.  She's top-drawer, but I can only muster a lukewarm rating for a project that in the end feels exploitative of both its actors and its audience.  Worth a rental if you are a Swinton fan; if you are looking to purchase a DVD showcasing her range, however, check out her earlier work in ""Orlando"", ""The Beach"" or ""The Deep End"", all which this reviewer can heartily recommend.",1256342400,15,3046,4.838150289017341
3862866,5,B00277Q2UQ,"JULIA is one of those films that goes beyond being a story and production worth the viewers' attention: this is one of those experiences in observing the art of acting at its peak.  Tilda Swinton who continues to explore roles that challenge her and her audience, roles that few other actresses would considering making let alone making, and in JULIA she covers a range of emotions and mutations of a character that simply leave the audience in complete awe of her talent.  She is extraordinary!

Julia is a bright but flawed person.  She is an alcoholic who spends her nights drinking herself into oblivion only to wake up the next morning not recognizing her bed partner or the surroundings of her comatosed night of stupor.  Swinton makes us understand this character's 'way with men' in her grossly revealing clothes and her flirtations backed by a mouth of filth.  Julia loses her job over her drunken tardiness and has ruined a 'relationship' with ex-alcoholic Mitch (Saul Rubinek) and finally goes to an AA meeting where she meets Elena (Kate Del Castillo), a pathetic recovering alcoholic whose only goal in life is to retrieve her son Tom (Aidan Gould) from his wealthy disapproving grandfather.  Julia is so desperate for money that she buys into a bizarre 'kidnapping' of Tom for Elena, a decision that triggers all of the rest of the film's journey through crime and sleaze as Julia fails at every effort to 'play the game' of criminal to make a fortune. Traveling from Los Angeles through the desert to Mexico, along the way Julia encounters 'co-facilitators' in her new life of crime - portrayed by such fine actors as Bruno Bichir (Demian Bichir's brother), a new and fine young actor Horacio Garcia Rojas, and Eugene Byrd to name only a few of the standout performances.  Though a bit overlong at 2 1/2 hours, the script by Michael Collins and Camille Natta is spot on perfect and the direction by Erick Zonca makes the long film always richly colored and fascinating in attention to detail.

But the real reason to watch this film in the astonishing, multifaceted performance by Tilda Swinton, surely one of the finest actresses before us today.  Her Julia creates a new level of acting standard- even for Swinton!  Grady Harp, August 09",1251244800,8,2254,4.828571428571428

Swinton has no intention of turning the kid over to his mother, but plans to ransom him to the grandfather for two million dollars.  Unfortunately for her, Grandpa soon learns her identity and she is forced to flee to Mexico with the boy, who is soon taken from her by some professional kidnappers.
