7793220,4,0871273012,"Many years ago I studied at the Hawkins studio in New York.  I have missed the classes and was recently inspired to search for a means to reconnect.  These DVDs were what I needed to refresh my memory.  Unfortunately, one of the discs would not load.  I am in the process of returning them for a replacement. When it arrives I will be able to dance, again, in a way that is healthy and, I fear, about to be lost.  Thank you Dance Horizons for providing the DVDs.",1332720000,,462,4.204545454545454
