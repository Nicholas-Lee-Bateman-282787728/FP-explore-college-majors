5731375,5,B00CO9JPOC,"So happy for this DVD to come out. I love the direction this show is taking. It's the right amount of humour mixed with obsurcity. I am interested to see Jenna's change in direction in life based on this part of the season and the season 3 part 2 promo. I like how she is challenging what she thought was good, and unfortunately, is changing, not necessarily for the better. This show is not afraid to tell it as it is, and I must commend it for that.",1372723200,,451,4.136363636363637
5731376,1,B00CO9JPOC,"I enjoy this show.  I've purchased the first two seasons on DVD.  It is the ONLY DVD of a movie or of a TV program where they bleep words you can see the actors form with their mouths both on the tv program and on the DVD.  VERY STRANGE

Now they are taking this 13 episode Season 3 and making 2 DVD sets out of it?  UNBELIEVABLE!

No wonder the sales for DVDs are going down.  Just a few years ago DVDs were full of extras including booklets.  Now you are lucky if you get a working disc with  front and back art work.

Oh, and I forgot to mention that this 1/2 episodes of Season 3 (6 or 7 episodes) costs MORE that the 12 episodes of Season 1 or Season 2.

MORE UNBELIEVABLE!!!!",1372204800,18,681,3.9703703703703703
5731377,5,B00CO9JPOC,"This is the best show ever!! I cant wait until it comes back, until then i will watch over and over!!!!!",1392076800,,104,4.0
5731378,4,B00CO9JPOC,It is good and I really am enjoying it it sometimes breaks out though but it has only done it a couple of times.,1390867200,,112,3.7083333333333335
5731379,5,B00CO9JPOC,"I love this show, but I hate it when they do the part 1 & 2 stuff!!  It's a great way for them to make more money off
DVD sell, looks like MTV is making a habit of this like with Teen Wolf.  But with a show like this they know it will still
Sell!!! This season finds Jenna figuring herself  and her relationships out, and rebellion seems to be on her herizon!!
 It's about time Jenna loosened up, but she takes it too far and regrets come quick ly to her, leaving her with  no friends
Or family to lean on!! Hazards of a teenager for sure!!!
  All ends as it should. Lessons are learned. Can't wait for season 4, with a part 1 I bet!!",1388620800,2,634,3.9448818897637796
5731380,5,B00CO9JPOC,"Wonderful series absolutely adore it. Extremely funny show, love all the twists and turn plus of course the ""awkward"" parts",1388620800,,123,5.2
5731381,5,B00CO9JPOC,"Got this for my 18 year old daughter for Christmas, and she loves it! I can't believe how fast I got it! Super fast shipping and the DVD and case were in perfect condition! Highly reccomend!",1388361600,,190,4.305555555555555
5731382,5,B00CO9JPOC,"Amazing show, always keeps me on the edge of my seat. Season three is my favorite of all by far!",1388188800,2,96,3.85
5731383,2,B00CO9JPOC,I got my dvd today in the mail im a awkward fan but in the third episode on my dvd starts to glitch green :(,1386115200,,108,3.36
5731384,5,B00CO9JPOC,"Awkward isn't ""awkward"".  This is a sharply written, well acted comedy series.  While Season 3 wasn't my favorite season, it still was better than most comedies on TV.",1378252800,2,167,4.928571428571429
5731385,4,B00CO9JPOC,"The show changed, and that's even the slogan for the season ""change blows"". I was looking forward to seeing Jenna get caught up in many incidents, which didn't happen. Also, Sadie didn't deliver many laughs. This season was more serious/dramatic. I still love the show and will continue watching Season 3 Part 2 in the fall!",1373068800,,324,4.803571428571429
8583909,5,B00CO9JPOC,"I like this TV show very much and therefore I also like the appropriate DVD. The episodes are funny, clever and good entertainment. It is a fantastic distraction from the daily routine. I also think that Ashley Rickards looks really sweet.",1465948800,,239,4.853658536585366
8583910,5,B00CO9JPOC,LOVE the series; love the extras!!,1419724800,,34,4.833333333333333
8583911,5,B00CO9JPOC,"Granddaughter loves the shows, so it just is natural she gets the DVD to watch all the episodes when she wants. Will get the others too.",1403654400,,136,4.269230769230769
8583912,5,B00CO9JPOC,"Love awkward but there was a flaw in the movie,  it messed up, don't know why, I wonder if that happens in a lot of dvd's",1402790400,,121,3.6538461538461537
8583913,3,B00CO9JPOC,"The DVD did not work the DVD player, it only worked on the computer. I was very disappointed in buying this.",1401840000,,108,4.190476190476191
8583914,5,B00CO9JPOC,love it but wish it had the web shows on it. not for kids definitely.  but do recommend watching it.  reminds me of high school.,1401321600,,128,4.08
8583915,4,B00CO9JPOC,"Recently started watching this series, and it is super cute. A little over dramatic at some points, but that's the point. Good series.",1399680000,,134,4.869565217391305
8583916,1,B00CO9JPOC,"LOVE the show. I bought Season 3 Part 1 off of Amazon and it would not play on my DVD player or on my PlayStation 2. I wrote to Amazon, and they sent me a replacement. Much like the first one, the replacement would not work on my DVD player or PS2. However, I tried it on my sisters Xbox 360 and it worked fine. I do not personally own an xbox, so for me to keep the show would be pointless. What kind of disc only plays on an xbox? A disappointing waste of money.",1399507200,,464,3.84375
8583917,2,B00CO9JPOC,"When I received both of the DVD's of This one and Season 3 part1, my friend video taped my reaction when I was opening the boxes and you could hear a loose object rolling around. Yuppppp you guessed it a CD was flip flopping inside and scratched all over on the sensitive side. There is parts in the show where the screen goes green and also cuts out and you are still able to hear the voices but the image goes away. ALL IN ALL I LOVE THE SHOW AWKWARD WITH A 5 STAR ALL THE WAY, I would be more then happy to send you the video image since you can clearly hear the CD inside in case not properly secured. I work at a 5 star and 5 diamond hotel and its always busy and crazy trying to get to juggle my life with work life since I am always fully committed to my job. I don't always have time to do review's or anything like that because normally I am not one to complain since, working at a place like I do really changes your perspective on things but this time I was actually DISSAPOINTED when I received these. Poor packaging of securing the product could of been corrected but I assume poor packaging procedures could of caused the problem.",1398988800,,1144,4.134529147982063
8583918,5,B00CO9JPOC,product was exactly as advertised. was given as a christmas present and the recipent was very pleased thank you very much,1393977600,,121,4.809523809523809
