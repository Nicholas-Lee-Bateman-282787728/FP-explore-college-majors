5071541,3,B007AAF1FW,"I always get a giggle out of reviews that seem more interested in going to extremes that actually judging the material fairly (I do it myself sometimes). Mr. Curry seems determined to come across as a fair and balanced critic, who (pun intended) does not care what other people think BECAUSE if one is fair and balanced, critics of your criticism must be misguided.

Rather than a review of ""The Happiness Patrol"", what we have here is an attack on Liberal perspectives on unregulated Capitalism greed; a denunciation of the author's and producer's perspectives on what they see as a potential future if uncontrolled Capitalism reaches its ultimate end---a society wherein people are forced to be happy, no matter what their circumstances----or else. Certainly ""Orwellian"" in form, but not necessarily Socialist; rather REALIST.

Stepping away from a harsh judgment on political ideology and reviewing ""The Happiness Patrol"" itself: Is it the WORST (or second worst) Doctor Who ever? Well, since individual tastes vary widely, some people might consider it so. It is certainly not one of the best. However, it IS generally well acted. Sophie Aldred always charms and Sylvester McCoy (here's that darned old opinion again) was a consistantly better Doctor than, say, Peter Davison (ducks quickly). The story was interesting enough to watch, but perhaps not one to PURCHASE to watch time and again. I would rank it in the bottom ranks of the Who catalog, but, not being vituperative to the point of excess, I would not give it ONE star.

Any Doctor Who is better than a ONE star ranking. Simply the fun of it should rank a TWO, even if the story is not the best. I would give ""The Happiness Patrol"" a 2.81 if I could, but I can't. So in my humble opinion it gets THREE STARS (about a 'C').",1329696000,6,1787,4.814332247557004

5071543,1,B007AAF1FW,"If you want to see a prime example of why Doctor Who was cancelled back in the late 1980's than this ridiculous pantomime is exhibit A. The main protagonist is this Cruel-la-de-vil rip-off and her henchman is some insane villain made of what appears to be candy (are you kidding me?) The author tries to be clever by placing this roaming harmonica player who acts as a sort of narrator the  (completely bored ) viewer much in the way th DJ was in Revelation of the Daleks. The only difference is the DJ worked and this does not. The whole story is a silly George Orwell type story line that was so PLAYED OUT after 25 years for doctor who on TV (this story was sadly part of what should have been a glorious 25Th anniversary season...but was not). If I ever finish building a time machine I am taking a copy of this back to the BBC in 1985 to show them how wrong they were to tamper with the show in it's final years. No doubt after viewing this silliness they will instantly hire back Colin Baker (Or keep the GREAT Peter Davison) and keep Eric Saward as script editor.... to avert this nonsense (The Silliness patrol) from ever being made. In summary This is really, really bad Doctor Who/television. Save your money and borrow the DVD from someone first before buying it.

5071545,5,B007AAF1FW,"The Happiness Patrol is an OK serial, I haven't seen so many classic Doctor Who stories in years and years but because
of the 50th Anniversary I am making up for lost time and collecting my fav episodes and also renting them from my local library system to see if my memory jives with the story...
Everyone seems to think The Happiness Patrol was one of the best Sylvester McCoy stories, but having just watched it last night
it's not the story that is worth getting the DVD for it's the Extras, in particular the documentary about how political and anti-establishment Doctor Who really has been all this time. The writers were ingenious because instead of blatant stories about racism or class structure that Star Trek was famous for they were just trying to tell a good story and often enough political views and social commentary made its way into the fabric of the story. The Happiness Patrol is one of those more overt and as the then head writer notes it wasn't just about Thatcher who was Prim Minister then, it was also about what was going on in South Africa and raids on townships and the ""disappearances"" of non conformists. It's an intriguing episode, but if you get it really, seriously watch the documentary first or last, but do watch it because that's what makes this DVD worth the money!

Other than that I do admit that this is a great episode featuring Ace, Sophie Aldred. It showcases her acting talents nicely and seems to me more about her than the Doctor here. Also, as it's been said the Kandy Man... that's K A N D Y not Candy Man is probably one of the best monsters DW ever had had. And it really is much too bad he isn't in the show a lot more and you really don't get to see how he is defeated (they kind of skip that part) and just show him done in rather than exactly what happens between him running through the tunnels and turning out at the end of the shoot. The style and costumes and painting the TARDIS pink is a nice touch. I know many had said or think that the last season of the McCoy era is the best and darker but frankly I thought it was pretty boring. The Curse of Fenric is a big bore and not worth the $100.00 price tag currently on Amazon by 3rd party sellers. $16.00 for The Happiness Patrol is perfect, it should never go above that.

My personal feeling is that the BEST Sylvester McCoy stories were mainly at his beginning: Time and the Rani, Paradise Towers, Delta and the Bannermen, Dragonfire and Remembrence of the Daleks to me were the top of the crop. Of course The Brig shows up in Battlefield and I have yet to watch that one again... stay tuned.",1392940800,2,2606,4.371134020618556
5071546,5,B007AAF1FW,"You will not be disappointed with such great scripts, a believable monster and the brilliant Seventh Doctor...

5071547,3,B007AAF1FW,"I struggled with the rating for this.  The DVD is up to the standards of the usual Doctor Who offerings, and the included extras were interesting.

I confess that I dislike this time in Doctor Who -- I thought Sylvester McCoy had the potential to be a great Doctor... but the writing was, frankly, awful, and the stories didn't make a lot of sense.

The extras helped reveal why this was so... they new brood of writers (and script editors) brought on-board by JNT wanted to tell their views on things, and just used the vehicle of Doctor Who to do so.

When I first saw the show on PBS many years ago, I did not immediately think it was a satire of the Thatcher government; I just thought it was another disappointing show that didn't make sense.  The Kandy Man!?!  What kind of rubbish monster is this? You squirt lemonade at it, and it can't move?

Even the entire premise seems a little flawed... the Doctor tells Ace that he has been hearing reports of the planet not being run well, so he's going to look into it.  How does he hear these kind of things, and aren't there more important matters to ""look into""?

And then there's the blues harmonica player... what's he in the story for again?  He seems to be just a rebel type that no one can catch.

A disappointing, disjointed story... Story itself is 1-2 stars; DVD extras 3-4 stars; gave this a three overall.",1385337600,2,1368,4.410358565737051
5071548,5,B007AAF1FW,"This specific Doctor Who story was produced at a very difficult time for the show. The years in between the 1985 hiatus in the sixth doctor era to the cancellation of the show at the end of 1989.

After a mediocre 1st season for the seventh doctor, and the enirety of the sixth doctor era (although he is very underrated), the show started to find its path again in season 25. Remembrance of the Daleks, the premiere episode, was probably better than anything we had seen in 2 seasons. Silver Nemesis, the third story of the season, wasn't very good though. But it was better than anything in season 24. The final story, the Greatest Show in the Galaxy, was a pretty excellent story. And then there was The Happiness Patrol. And let me just say... it is the (second) most underrated serial in the history of the show!

The story has a dark, eerie feel to it. The plot itself is dark. If you aren't happy, you get killed quickly by the happiness patrol. Or get mauled by the leader of the happiness patrol, Helen A's, pet Fifi. Or, of course, there is the Kandy Kitchen where Helen A's psychotic henchman deals with you - The Kandy Man.

Many people hate the Kandy Man. And not just ""oh, i don't like that villian"" or ""man, that villian is kind of stupid"", I mean ""$@!/, that was the worst thing to ever happen to Doctor Who!"" And i just don't get it. I LOVE the Kandyman. So why all the hate for him? And why all the hate for this brilliant story?

Anyway, here's the list of the special features:

1. Audio Commentary by actors Sophie Aldred (Ace), writer Greame Curry, composer Dominic Glynn and director Chris Clough, moderated by Toby Hadoke.
2. Happiness Will Prevail (23 minutes) - Making of with Cast and Crew.
3. Deleted and Extended Scenes (23 minutes)
4. When Worlds Collide (46 minutes) - Analyizing the stories political ideologies.

5071549,3,B007AAF1FW,"Aside from all the no-longer relevant political speculation, I found that I actually liked the portrayal of the character of Hellen A. The girls of the Happiness Patrol were also pretty nicely done. However, the lame troglodytes, the not-dog Fi Fi, and the ridiculous and completely nonsensical Kandyman made this episode one of the worst of the Seventh Doctor's run. The basic premise and the set designs were OK, and the attempt to show the Doctor's darker side worked out pretty well.

5071556,5,B007AAF1FW,"This episode certainly is an interesting entry into the Doctor Who series. It has been a while since I last saw this episode but I remember it being on the lines of ""The Liquorice Allsorts"" man is the main villain (to my recollection).

This episode is the point of no return for Doctor Who.
The Doctor has dealt with the Daleks, shook off The Sontarans, clashed with the Cybermen and fought off the Ice Warriors (Also: A green bubble wrap alien). Now he goes toe to toe with a monster whose weakness is lemonade.

Next Episode: The Doctor fights the cool-aid guy. Can the TARDIS sustain his wall breaking attacks?!

But being a fan of Doctor Who, I kinda liked this episode. It brings back Nostalgic memories.
I was 13 when I watched this and I thought it was ridiculous back then. But, it has a certain charm to it which I feel that the post 2005 era of Doctor Who cannot capture. There's more to the storyline but I cannot quite remember. I know it was entertaining and certainly DVD Worthy.

Here's to the Oldschool Doctor Who. We'll love it no matter how ridiculous it gets...

5071557,1,B007AAF1FW,"In my opinion, this is the worst Doctor Who serial in the history of the program! The story is lazy and makes little to no sense in places, the candy robot is quite literally no threat at all, and the so called ""political message"" knocks you over the head so hard you would have thought that it was trying to knock you unconscience. if you want some good one's from Doctor Who's 25 Season then stick with ""Remembrance of the Daleks"" and ""Silver Nemesis"". You could easily skip this piece of crap and the later one of the season entitled ""The Greatest Show in the Galaxy"", and will litarally not miss a thing in the overall story arc that envolves the Doctor's companion Ace.

Like I said skip this one at all cost!",1336953600,10,714,4.368421052631579
5071558,4,B007AAF1FW,"""The Happiness Patrol"" comes from an unpopular and often-neglected era of Doctor Who -- the end of the original series, when ratings were poor and internal BBC support for the show was practically nonexistent. But in spite of all that, this is a pretty cool serial that deserves a charitable reassessment.

The basic premise is that the Doctor and his companion Ace arrive on a planet where sadness has been banned, and is punishable by death. The planet is ruled by the insane dictator Helen A, who is an obvious parody of Margaret Thatcher. (Amusingly, British journalists didn't notice the Thatcher parallel until 2010, when ""The Happiness Patrol"" was exhumed and re-examined by the media, and became briefly controversial.) Helen A's chief henchman is a robot, made of candy, who kills dissidents by drowning them in syrup.

Does all this sound a bit grotesque, perhaps even ridiculous? Well, it is ridiculous, of course. But for those who agree with the left-wing politics of this serial, and can enjoy its peculiar brand of dark humor, there is much to appreciate here. Indeed, I quite like the gutsy social commentary in the script, and I think it's still very relevant. Meanwhile, some of the serial's perceived weaknesses -- false-looking sets, over-the-top acting, and a general campy atmosphere -- become more acceptable, and perhaps even appropriate, when you view them through the lens of political satire.

As for the DVD itself, it's one of the best single-disc Doctor Who editions to come along in a while. It includes a making-of special that intelligently examines the serial's politics and production strengths/weaknesses, as well as an extensive collection of extended and deleted scenes (the highlight of which is a much better introduction scene for the character Susan Q). The DVD also includes a fairly long featurette on the politics of Doctor Who, which covers the show's entire decades-long history, touching upon all of the obviously political stories. This is a really interesting, substantive special feature of the sort that I particularly enjoy, since it goes beyond surface analysis of stuff like sets and special effects in order to unpack what Doctor Who is actually about. Good times.

So, in the end, I recommend both this serial and the DVD. This isn't exactly classic Doctor Who -- other serials have better writing and better production -- but still, this is an intelligent and underrated story, not a goofy camp-fest that deserves to be written off. The Kandyman alone makes this worth watching again; his costume is so demented that it must be seen to be disbelieved.",1336348800,14,2609,5.06046511627907

'The Happiness Patrol' is another example of the overly garish and campy (a relative term in Doctor Who, I know) tendencies that plagued some of the Colin Baker stories and all of the first season McCoy stories.

'Happiness Patrol' just grinds on and plays more like a pantomime than a fully realized story. The Thatcher allegory is  ineptly handled too. Bleh.

It's also a little odd that the BBC have decided to release 3 of the worst stories in classic Doctor Who history (this, Dragonfire and Nightmare of Eden) all on the same day with no truly good story to offset them.  Is this for the subset of masochistic Who fans who are taking a break from recreational root canals?

5071562,5,B007AAF1FW,"How can you go wrong when the bad guy is a robot made of different kinds of candy?

Well, Kandy Man is not the only bad guy on the planet Terra Alpha. He is only the executioner for the real power, Helen A., who rules with an iron fist. And a smile. Her first rule is that it is against the law to be unhappy. And if you are labeled a Killjoy, her secret police, the Happiness Patrol, will either kill you or haul to off to the Waiting Zone. There, you will either A.) undergo enough conditioning so you regain your natural state of happiness, or B.) be recruited to the Happiness Patrol, where killing people will restore you to your happiness, or C.) be taken to the Kandy Kitchen, where meeting Kandy Man will be the last thing you do.

There're other subplots, but for me the subplots are footnotes to the Doctor's dealings with Kandy Man, and the clever way he stops the sweet robot in his tracks.

This episode first aired in 1988. Helen A. was supposed to be a thinly disguised caricature of Margaret Thatcher. In 2010, Sylvester McCoy (Doctor Who) told the Sunday Times: ""Our feeling was that Margaret Thatcher was far more terrifying than any monster the Doctor had encountered.""  When the Doctor urges the workers of Terra Alpha to revolt against Helen A., it is intended as a reference to England's 1984-1985 miners' strike and the Iron Lady's repressive response.

There is a very brief gay rights reference that can be easily missed. Early on, we see Kandy Man execute a man in a suit, and the man is wearing a pink triangle.

From what I've read, most of Graeme Curry's original script's social commentary was toned down in production. I love the comedy and the seriousness of this episode.

This review is of the 2012 DVD release, the first time ""The Happiness Patrol"" has been released on DVD. BBC has released the extras to be included in this DVD release. .

1.  Audio Commentary. Toby Hadoke moderates, with commentary by Sophie Aldred (who plays Ace), writer Graeme Curry, script editor Andrew Cartmel, composer Dominic Glynn and director Chris Clough. Some of the commentary is about the script, and it's political points. Clough mostly talks about his extreme budget constraints, including how Ace and the Doctor had to make sloooooow getaways, because they couldn't afford vehicles with any umph!
2.  Happiness Will Prevail (23 min), a making of documentary. Includes commentary by Andrew Cartmel (script editor), John Pope (who played the Kandyman, a very uncomfortable costume), Sophie Aldred (Ace) and Sylvester McCoy (the Doctor).
(Added after my DVD was received and watched:) I thought this documentary was excellent. For one thing, they try to answer the unanswerable question of WHY did the Doctor hang from his umbrella over the ice abyss?  The subtle sub-themes are talked about, it goes deeper than Margaret Thatcher. Sophie Aldred talks about how she got the job, and lots more.
3.  When Worlds Collide (46 min) documentary. Presented by Shaun Ley, broadcaster, this takes a look at the times when Doctor Who scripts took on politics in the real world, in varying degrees. Many people contribute to this short, including people not involved with this episode, such as Terence Dicks. I have a feeling this documentary is going to be too short for me!
(Added after my DVD was received and watched:)  As I suspected, I really really enjoyed this documentary. They talk about the personalities of each Doctor incarnation, and how such personalities were reflected in any ""message"" in any particular serial. And there's the fact that they had to be careful about having TOO much message, and losing viewers. Or, more likely, getting lots of letters.
4.  Deleted and Extended Scenes (23 min)
(Added after my DVD was received and watched:) I think this is the very first Dr. Who Deleted Scenes that actually kept my interest!
5.  ""Blue Peter"", the children's show episode where Ace wishes Blue Peter happy birthday

8513220,5,B007AAF1FW,What's not to like. Its Doctor Who with Sylvester McCoy!,1464307200,,56,4.7
8513221,4,B007AAF1FW,"The Sylvester McCoy era, past and present as well as one can safely assume in future as well, has received a pretty bad rap from some fans. There are stories that have been criticized from production values, scripts, performances and other elements. Even as someone who is a proud fan of the Seventh Doctor and his era, I admit that some of that criticism is valid. There are stories from the era though that aren't quite as deserving of that rap though and The Happiness Patrol is a perfect example of this.

There's the script for example. Graeme Curry's script takes the Doctor Who clich of citizens vs. an evil government and turns it into something more. This story famously was the subject of a tempest in a teacup scandal back in 2010 for the fact that it was a satire of Thatcher's Britain with Shelia Hancock's Helen A being based on her. That element is present without a doubt and it's easy to detect for anyone familiar with Thatcher and her politics from Helen A's slogans to the drones being told to down tools (a reference to the infamous miner's strike of 1984-85) but there's more to the story than that. There's elements drawn from tyrannical governments from around the world including references to an entire village being raised to the ground and mass disappearances similar to events in Chile and Argentina. The titular Happiness Patrol, once you move beyond the colorful outfits, calls to mind elements of Soviet secret police and intelligence organizations from members turning on each other (including an informant being pinned with a medal only to be executed). All of this mixing and matching of elements forms only a part of the script though.

For into this, set on a colony world centuries in the future, Curry also throws in a larger moral message. It was this moral message that became the starting point for the story: a planet where the state of happiness is required to be a permanent one and that the penalty for being anything but is death. The choice of happiness as what's being enforced is an interesting one. It's an abstract one and by choosing it over a more obvious choice of ideology (be it communism, capitalism or whatever) it also  gives the story an originality it might not have otherwise. It also also for interesting discussions such as the scene between Ace and Susan Q or the final confrontation with Helen A in part three. As much as it is a political satire and commentary, The Happiness Patrol is about the need for real emotions (be they either positive or negative) are far more important than trying to maintain or force upon anyone the appearance of happiness or normality. It's a mix of commentary, satire and morality play that Doctor Who especially seems good at.

Yet for a story that tries to point out the importance of looking beneath the surface at what lies beneath, that seems to be what most people focus on. It isn't hard to blame them. Being the three part, studio bound story of Season 25, the story feels exactly that way. Old Who had been accused by some of looking cheap and, for all the pluses of this story, this could be a case where that was true. The studio bound feel shows the limitations of the story with cramped streets representing the city where much of the city takes place. Despite decent blasts accompanying them, the guns carried by the Happiness Patrol looks anything but impressive. Beyond the human characters in the story, the pipe people to the Kandy Man, neither of which are exactly impressive pieces of design (in fact the Kandy Man couldn't be farther from what Curry originally had in mind in his script). There's also some iffy performances including an over the top performance from Helen A that rather undermines the attempt to make her a villain. Yet look a bit further beneath the surface will you?

Beyond some of the cosmetic issues, The Happiness Patrol has more to offer. Some of Chris Clough's direction is excellent, especially scenes in the street scenes with a series of canted camera angles, which help to give the story a sense of menace and tension alongside the humor and satire. While Helen A is an over the top villain, her various minions (including the title ones) are actually highly effective such as Rachel Bell's Priscilla P. There's also a strong supporting cast including Richard D. Sharp as Earl Sigma, Lesley Dunlop as Susan Q and John Normington as Trevor Sigma. As cheap as the sets might look, they and the costume add to the atmosphere of the story by showing Helen A's world for what it is: a fake fascade. It's quite meta in a way but one that works quite well if one gives it the chance to. Then there's the moody and evocative score from Dominic Glynn with its blues influence as well that, like the story itself, mixes a dispearate amount to present an intriguing result.

Ultimately though, the star of this story is its Doctor. Sylvester McCoy, more comfortable in the role after a shaky first season, gets moment after moment to flex his acting muscles and show his not inconsiderable range as an actor. There's opportunities for McCoy to show off his comedic skills which, unlike in the previous season, get more of a chance to sit alongside his dramatic skills. It's those skills and McCoy's ability to play the serious and authoritativeness of the Doctor that gives the story some of its best and most powerful moments such as his speech to the rooftop snipers in part two and the aforementioned final confrontation with Helen A in part three.

For all of its reputation as a low point of Doctor Who's first television incarnation, there's more to this story than is apparent on first glance. It's a story that, once looks beyond the surface of its production values and a couple of questionable choices, has much else to offer. There's Graeme Curry's script mixes together political satire and commentary with a serious message. There's the better part of the production as well from the direction to its score and performances.

Or to put it another way: It's not quite as silly as its looks would make you think, is it?",1452988800,,6070,4.698308270676692
8513222,5,B007AAF1FW,"This story is so smart, culturally relevant and savvy, even by millennial standards. While the original episode may have been making commentary on 80s British politics, there are so many parallels that could be drawn to modern politics. There is something to be said about the standards humanity measure quality of life and happiness today. Similar to movies such as Inside Out, this episode reminds us that sadness is necessary in life. It also reminds us that standardized societal conformity is dangerous, even when framed in positive motives, for the betterment of world.
So many derided this episode in the early 2000s, focusing so much on production value and the decline of the show. However, looking past budget limitations, the metaphorical script and nature of the story are quiet refreshing. If a story like this had a modern budget and a few more large action moments, this story could easily be considered groundbreaking.",1450828800,,934,5.111111111111111

8513224,4,B007AAF1FW,"he Happiness Patrol is an odd story. It's a dystopian tale, but with bizarre elements such as the Kandyman and the pink-clad Happiness Patrol. Despite the bizarre nature of many elements, it never falls to the level of farce.

This is helped by a solid guest performance by Shelia Hancock as Helen A. This is also a great episode for the Seventh Doctor with an excellent scene in Part Two when he confronts a sniper in part two and then final confrontation with Helen A. While some of the bizarre elements didn't work, most of them gave the story it's own unique feel.

On the negative side, Ace isn't particularly well-handled, been given very little to do in the story. Whatever the intended context of the story, this does hold up as a thought provoking tale without understanding the political thoughts that led to its writing. It's not quite as good as prior great Doctor Who dystopian tales such as the Sunmakers or Vengeance on Varos, but it's a good story in its own right and a solid improvement over the prior year's dystopian adventure, ""Paradise Towers.""",1431475200,,1066,4.695187165775401
