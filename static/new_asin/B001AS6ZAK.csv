8279388,5,B001AS6ZAK,"I really enjoy the routine. There is a good balance of explaining both the positioning and the breathing for each pose. Even if they are a little cheesy, I really appreciate the visualization components they include in the narrative/instruction.",1421020800,,245,5.3076923076923075

8279390,5,B001AS6ZAK,I took their Yoga class (in person) for some time & bought the VHS tape (this was some years ago!) so I could do it at home as well. I got out of the habit of doing it & now wanted to start doing it again & was happy to find it in a DVD! I would recommend this DVD.,1355702400,,265,3.433333333333333
8279391,5,B001AS6ZAK,"This seller sent me the product at my p.o. box, but the post office never notified me it was here. I just found out, a couple of months later. I went ahead and ordered it from another seller back in February, but only because this seller did not have any other copies. I sent this seller's copy back today when I got it from the post office. This seller was very courteous throughout the process.

This is a great yoga video. I ordered it because I learned yoga from these teachers in Houston, Texas. It is very good for the beginner student, but can also be used by somebody who is more advanced.",1335398400,,597,4.283185840707965
8279392,5,B001AS6ZAK,"MT and Roberto teach a yoga sequence that is for EVERYONE....and they teach with gentleness, imparting peacefulness and relaxation.  There is no over-striving or forcing for the ""perfect pose"", as each person has their own perfection.  A great DVD for serious yoga practitioners that would like to have a ""standard"" routine to follow that affects every part of the body.",1228176000,4,370,5.15
