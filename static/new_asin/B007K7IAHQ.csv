5092292,2,B007K7IAHQ,"The Unlimited Blade Works route of the Fate/stay night visual novel is the best of the three routes, and in my opinion the best work of fiction written in a very long time. The themes and characters are perfectly integrated into a discussion on the nature of idealism, the story is tightly focused and everything is very engaging. It is also 20+ hours long, and when you try to cut that much content into a ninety-minute movie, things turn out very badly. The movie jumps from plot point to plot point without any of the exposition or subtle characterization the original story does so well. Certain scenes are thrown in just because they were in the game, even though there isn't enough space to adequately cover them. The ""Mana Transfer Dolphin"" scene, as it is colloquially known, is an incomprehensible replacement for a sex scene that was present in the original story, and without knowing what was there I would have been completely mystified as to the purpose of those few minutes. Worst of all, the epilogue is cut almost entirely, with a short explanation of unimportant things and a pan to a famous scene from the original. The actual scene is removed, because none of the exposition necessary for it to make sense is present in the movie, despite its great importance to the proper story. The only reason to watch this movie is to see action sequences which were not available in the visual novel, but a savvy viewer would simply skip to those and ignore the remainder of this movie.",1335225600,8,1494,4.684410646387833
5092293,5,B007K7IAHQ,"Fate/Stay Night Unlimited, is the second arc from the Visual Novel Fate/Stay Night. Back in 2006 an anime was made, concentrating on the Fate arc, which had the the same scenario, but differs much from the Unlimited Blade Works arc. It's heavy on fights,the story develops at the speed of light, The art and animation is superbly polished the detailed character designs in particular are gorgeous. The English cast is same they used in fate/stay night tv and doing dubbed is BangZoomEntertainment so that is a Plus+ original cast back!..Ah the movie every Fate Stay Night fan has been waiting for. I highly recommend watching the anime before committing to this movie",1334707200,5,667,4.964285714285714
5092294,5,B007K7IAHQ,"Unlimited Blade Works is an amazingly gorgeous movie detailing the battle of magicians and their servants over an omnipotent wish-granting device (the Holy Grail). It's recommended for any fans of action or the supernatural. Although it assumes some familiarity with Fate/Stay Night (it glosses over introducing the characters and jumps straight into the action for it's full running length), it isn't a rehash of the TV series (available on DVD). Rather, it tells a different version of events based on the ""official"" story path from the game (which is essentially a visual choose-your-own-adventure book).",1334102400,14,607,5.468085106382978

I've watched the online version and thought that it was gonna be like that, but when I watched it I couldn't take 20 to 30 minutes of it because it was so cut up. I hope the other sentai filmworks animes aren't like this, but I'm skeptical about them too now. This was my first anime by sentai filmworks and I'm disappointed.

I can't understand why the creaters made such a silly dicision. As a result , many important scenes that fans of Fate/ stay night wanted to see were
not depicted.
If you wanna real ""unlimited blade works"",I recommend watching remaked anime that was created by ufotable in 2014 ,2015 .
You will be able to know everything about the world of Fate after watching it.

5092355,2,B007K7IAHQ,Don't buy it and skip it.  This blu-ray is a big disservice to the series because it is super condensed.  By far my favorite series is the one from 2014 that is being streamed by Netflix.  Watch that instead because it is freaking epic.,1440633600,,236,4.318181818181818

This is the first anime series I want to collect merchandise for. So I went ahead and got this. I love how I have the option to watch it in its original language(Japanese), even though the English is actually pretty good. This won't disappoint if you are into supernatural, action, romance-type stuff with a bit of school life and comedic elements thrown in here and there. The artwork just blows me away as well as the story-writing of course, by the same guy(Kinoko Nasu) who wrote Tsukihime(another favorite, second to the Fate series imo). So if you have not checked this out yet go for it!^_^ I highly recommend playing/reading the visual novel also for the full experience of the story.

If you enjoyed the original anime you will also enjoy this movie.  Keep in mind that this is based off of a game (visual novel) that has multiple endings so this movie does not happen after the anime but is just another ending to the story.  Not only is the ending different but so is the story, such as character deaths, just because someone died in the first anime does not mean they will die in the movie, and vice versa.",1401321600,,702,4.2631578947368425

5092388,5,B007K7IAHQ,This is a movie based on the Unlimited Blade Works route in the Fate/Stay Night visual novel. It feels rushed because a lot of the important scenes that were in the visual novel weren't included in the film. They should have made the UBW route into an anime series just like they did with the Fate route. The animation is okay but that doesn't ruin the movie because the fight scenes are so awesome!

5092391,3,B007K7IAHQ,"WARNING: if you have not watched Fate/Stay Night or played the original Visual Novel, stay away from this!

This movie is an adaptation of Fate/Stay Night's Unlimited Blade Works route, a battle heavy story that centers around Emiya Shirou and Tohsaka Rin's servant Archer. The movie gives a quick overview of the Holy Grail War and goes right into the action.

Sentai Filmwork's dub isn't the best, but it works. Acting wise it's fine, but the script isn't great and they get a few things wrong, such as what the victor of the Holy Grail War receives (it's just the wish, not the wish and ultimate power). The subtitles are functional but ugly looking (large yellow letters), which isn't actually a knock against it, but that's just my own gripe (I watch Fansubs primarily, so I'm used to good looking subtitles).

This movie has great animation, music, and fights. The primary problems are it's pacing and it's execution. Some scenes just feel rushed, and other scenes do not have the same impact or feeling behind them (primary example is Archer vs Lancer outside of Kotomine's church). Also the final fight is not nearly as awesome as it was in the original Visual Novel.

3/5 stars. It's worth checking out, but only if you've seen the original series or read the visual novel.",1370563200,,1282,4.761261261261262
5092392,1,B007K7IAHQ,"What the hell is this stupid garbage anyways. I have the actual series, and this movie doesn't follow the series one bit. All this movie is doing is rushing through the series, and adding a bunch of extra junk that never should of existed to begin with. Makes me feel so stupid spending $25 on this damn thing. Rip off of Fate/Stay Night, and I don't recommend this movie to anyone. Saber becomes a servant of Caster which in my opinion is totally stupid garbage, and not only that, but even the actor for Saber has changed from Kate Higgins to Michelle Ruff in which it just doesn't sound the same anymore. So yeah total garbage. Just stick with the animated series instead of this junk. That's it for this review. Hope it helped.",1364601600,,731,4.462686567164179
5092393,4,B007K7IAHQ,"was attempted in one movie and I think for the most part pulled it off. Mostly.

The animation is movie quality, but the need to cram so much information tends to flatten out personalities. I suggest you watch the tv show to get a feel for the characters so you at least get a understanding of the characters before watching this movie.",1362873600,,336,4.419354838709677
5092394,4,B007K7IAHQ,"First off, This movie is vastly inferior to the visual novel scenario for Unlimited Blade Works. It is also even inferior to the Fate/Stay Night animation. But that is OK, and here is why.
If you are a fan of Fate/Stay Night and either cannot or would rather not deal with the visual novel format of this story, this is a must watch just to get into the Unlimited Blade Works scenario, which is the one most integrated into the plot of Fate/Stay Night. So if you really want to know what some of the symbols in that animation meant, even though some of them were pretty blatant in and of themselves, you need to see this.
Some people complain that this is abstract and hard to follow, and they are right. But this production pretty much presumes you have either played the visual novel or seen the anime series, and so most of the abstracted bits are repeats of details covered in these works. After all, this is another scenario of the same events rather than a separate distinct event, so retelling all the details would just be a waste of time. Also, even beyond this, the Fate universe is very complex and contrived and so outside the [very] long form of the visual novel difficulties are going to be natural. I suppose this is not really an excuse as much as a trade-off made in the production the animation to avoid making it excessively long and therefore expensive.
Regardless, It is just pretty plain cool to see some of the events from Unlimited Blade Works happen in full animation even if you are familiar with them. If you look at this disc as just being that it is still worth it.
I would not recommend this to someone who either hasn't yet been exposed to or doesn't care for other Fate works. Then the downsides outweigh any benefits this animation can offer. But then again, why on earth would you want to expose yourself to such spoilers to begin with?",1359849600,,1870,4.470760233918129
5092395,4,B007K7IAHQ,"here we have a great action anime that really are equal to the expensive hollywood movies out there..
great action, story and animation are combined and made another great anime.
as fan of the fate series i was really happy to get my hands on that bd, which is a separate route of the game and is not continuing on fate stay night.
only bad thing here is the packing so u might think it will get a hole if u poke some places too hard... so either be really carefull or exchange the packing with some other u might have (for example the ps network card box)",1359331200,,556,4.157407407407407
5092396,5,B007K7IAHQ,if your a fan of fate/stay night this is a must have -unlimited blade works is by far the best of the 3 route stories -and doesn't do lots of unessary combining of the different story arcs -im a little sad some things were cut but it would have been too long.  Overall the story is great the action great and the animation great a must have for any fan,1359072000,,352,4.0285714285714285
5092397,5,B007K7IAHQ,I loved the visual novel and immediately went search for other adaption. This was one of the many i found and i can picking this up on blu-ray is awesome if only the anime episodes was also on blu-ray.,1356825600,,201,4.17948717948718
5092398,4,B007K7IAHQ,A fate/ movie that has great action. As a Dan who has seen the animated series of Fate/Stay Night & Fate/Zero. Having this film connects perfectly to to Fate/Unlimited Blade Works.,1355270400,,180,4.838709677419355
5092399,4,B007K7IAHQ,"Fate Stay / Night is a 5 star series in my mind. It has excellent animation, voice acting, plot, action, and drama. This movie is an alternate retelling of the series. The animation is better, but that's the only thing I can think of that it has on the original show. The character introductions are rushed, many of the voice actors are different, and it's hard to sum up a detailed plot like this one in a movie. Even though it's pretty long, it needed more time. An hour and 40 minutes isn't enough. The movie is good in it's own way, but having seen the show first, it left me wanting more from it. I guess that if you want to get a feel for what the series is like this movie can give you a general idea. I think that if you're new to the show, I suggest buying the first volume of the series on DVD or Blu-ray.  It's an excellent series. I highly recommend it to any anime fan. The movie is really kind of unnecessary in my opinion.",1355011200,3,937,4.120218579234972
5092400,4,B007K7IAHQ,It has many action in it. Someone wants to be a hero and someone wants to have control to be a bully. Even love is in this one. The drawing isn't to bad either.,1352419200,,160,3.735294117647059
5092401,4,B007K7IAHQ,"This was my first viewing of anything Fate.  I have to say I was impressed.  Great animation, engaging story, compelling conflicts, and characters you can get behind.  No whiny anime kids for this show, no overdoing the angst.  My only caveat is that I'm coming in raw.  I can't compare it to other iterations of Fate/Stay Night, but the movie entertained me and made me want to check out more of this world.

5092402,1,B007K7IAHQ,"Even worse than Fate/Stay Night. The graphic quality is just plain horrible. The story plot is just all scrambled and poorly explained. Just when things start to explain themselves, they just simply throw you another unexplained plot before they finished the last one. It is also horribly directed. The story plot and scene changes are very jumpy and again unexplained. I have no idea why they released such trash. I was actually looking forward to this, but I find it extremly painful to watch. I guess this is what happens when you try to squeeze two season worth of material into a 2 hour movie. Highly recommended against.",1349568000,,626,4.805555555555555
5092403,2,B007K7IAHQ,"As it is said in the description, the movie is basically the entire Fate/Stay Night anime summed up in 100 minutes, although it is extremely rushed and only people who have actually seen the full anime will have an idea of what's going on. A ton is left out that would help in explaining the story and even the story itself is changed from the anime. If you have seen the anime, watch at your own risk, but if you haven't seen the anime, don't watch this movie because it won't make sense. Do yourself a favor and watch the entire anime and enjoy it. This movie does not do the anime justice.",1345334400,2,592,4.247787610619469
5092404,4,B007K7IAHQ,"While this movie is a rushed Unlimited Blade Works telling of the visual novel, it does skip out on a lot of stuff, but it does a good job of explaining the best it can while it goes. With that said, this is not the movie one should start with as one is getting into the Fate universe; having prior experience with at least the anime helps with some of the terminology and seeing how the holy grail war works.

I will dock on star because Sentai's subtitles did mess up on some of the terminology at time, bringing them up when they weren't even being said in the Japanese version. Sentai needs to brush up on their translations, but it's otherwise a very good release.",1344902400,,669,4.309523809523809
5092439,5,B007K7IAHQ,"This is a great movie.  While the introduction is brief and not all the relations ships are gone over with fine detail this is because this movie is an alternative path to the TV Anime, which has around 26 episodes.  The Japanese Visual Novel on which both are based has three main and very different story paths that focus more on certain characters and so the endings of each path and who was important in the story differ in each one.  Both the anime and the movie are canon since the tv series focuses on the Fate path focusing on Saber's identity and purpose while the movies focuses on the Unlimited Blade Works path which reveals the formerly unknown (to anyone who only watched the anime and didn't play all 3 paths of the game) identity of Archer and focuses more or shiro's development as a hero.  If you like memorable characters, awesome battle and heroes with real ideals and conflict get this show.  And the tv series and then get it for friends and maybe theyl take the time and do an mini season of the third path Heavens Feel.",1344816000,,1043,4.439790575916231
5092440,3,B007K7IAHQ,"This is a really great show, 5 stars, I think it was under-appreciated by most anime fans. It's well-directed and exciting, in my opinion it is far better done than its brethren Type-Moon shows these past couple years, such as Garden of Sinners which I found to be a huge disappointment. Being a movie, Fate Unlimited Blade Works is of far higher animation quality than Fate Stay Night and a lot quicker paced, yet retains the same feel as the anime due to having the same production crew. The story is not a repeat of the TV series, as others have explained, which is another bonus. The movie may not completely make sense if one hasn't watched the anime TV series, but I think it would still be fun to watch even so.

Unfortunately, Sentai Filmworks' (ADVision) Blu-Ray release is sorely lacking, 2 stars. There are no extras at all, only the ADVision trailers and the extremely annoying ADVision ads.

Most fatally, the subtitle translations are horrific. I'm one of the least particular people about translations, but the quality of this one bothers even me. As other reviewers have pointed out, sometimes the translations bear little resemblance to what is actually being said. I have seen Hong Kong bootleg anime DVDs with better translations than this. The subtitles are reminiscent of the bootleg phenomena where the Japanese is first translated to Chinese, then translated from Chinese to English. I haven't viewed the dub yet, but my guess is that the subtitles aren't dubtitles, just a plain rush job.

Still, at least we got this release! With the state of anime over the last few years I was absolutely certain by now that this gem of a show was going to end up in the anime black hole c. 2007 ~ present. Fate Unlimited Blade Works is a HD native anime and there are no issues with the video or audio quality of this release. I hope that someday we are able to get Fate Stay Night on Blu-Ray in North America as well, since Fate Stay Night was surprisingly also animated in native HD.",1344384000,,1997,4.635593220338983
5092441,3,B007K7IAHQ,"While Unlimited Blade Works is visually stunning, it is also lacking in areas of character development and explanation. If you are familiar with Fate/Stay Night from either the visual novels or the first anime series, then this is a worthwhile companion volume.
However, if you are not familiar with the source material, you have little reason to feel any sort of emotional investment in the characters or the story.
The dub producers were considerate enough to hire most of the cast from the anime series to reprise their roles. Mela Lee still shines with her crisp tones as Rin Tohsaka, and Stephanie Sheh (credited as Jennifer Sakiguchi) still delivers the obnoxious brattiness of Illya with delight. Liam O' Brien really stands strong as Archer. And we get a bit more of veteran Tony Oliver's reads as Lancer.
One key actress was replaced, however. Kate Higgins, who did an excellent job as Saber in the anime series, does not return, and is replaced with Michelle Ruff. Fans of Bleach will recognize the same intonations that she uses to play Rukia Kuchiki in that series. This is not, however, a terrible distraction, as Ms. Ruff has no small amount of talent, and the character of Saber is largely absent in the film as well.

Worth the effort for fans of the original material. Not a good jumping on point for those unfamiliar with the franchise.",1342137600,5,1354,4.8111587982832615
5092442,5,B007K7IAHQ,"Finally after more than 5 years we get another dub for the FATE series. In the past ADV dubbed the original 26 episode series Fate/ Stay Night and after going bankrupt, Funimation picked up the series only for distribution purposes (they only sold the series, not re-dub it) and the supplies were limited. Now after many years, Sentai Filmworks come out of nowhere and release the movie which follows the alternative route (Unlimited Blade Works) of the visual novel. Most on of the original cast of voice actors return and it does sound like the original (though personally I would have preferred if they got better VA for some characters). The script is slightly modified with less cursing and some changes to certain one-liners but the Jap. version is also on the disk so feel free to watch it with subs if you want a harsher language. The image quality is great, true HD 1080p on blu ray and looks fantastic. Not many extras on this other than some trailers of other shows from sentai though :(
Overall I'd say its a good movie, it is somewhat rushed at the start, but if you seen the original FSN, then you will feel right at home with this one. Me being a huge FATE fan, I cannot take points off for the voice acting since they went out of their way to gather most of the original cast back after so many years and I also cant deduct anything for the slight script alteration (since it happens with all the dubbed anime), plus you can always watch it in Jap. if you want. Therefore I give this release a 5 out of 5 stars and I hope that we see more future FATE releases from Sentai~",1340755200,,1588,4.386440677966101
5092443,3,B007K7IAHQ,"Got this within a few days of it's Blu-ray release.  I'd say it's a pretty decent and overall entertaining little flick based on the Fate/Stay franchise.  Since I have not played the Visual Novel game that this movie is based on, I can't comment on how well the adaptation is exactly or about the parts left out of the movie and how important each part was or may have been.  Suffice it to say it has some rather impressive visuals (this is not the ""Fate/Zero"" TV prequel series, so not quite to that caliber of excellence, but still rather stunning to view on one's big screen home theater TV - which is really what you're buying this Blu-ray for).  And it has some decent quality sound too.

Now as for the dub in English....well, it's by Bang/Zoom entertainment, and they have never really impressed me with their dubbing jobs to be honest.  I've honestly heard worse, but as with most sub-par dubbing jobs on most anime, the actors they hired to do the voicing tend to make the amateurish mistake of just ""throwing"" their voice instead of pouring out emotion.  This especially happens at times when they're supposed to be shouting or screaming but they instead sound like their just speaking with a raised voice.  The end result is the lines of dialogue sound more ""forced"" & artificial.  The one good part where this kinda works is when they're reciting command spells or chants, or calling out attacks.  Half the time it sounds OK, the other half of the time...meh.  One of the times it does work is when Archer is calling out his one great attack spell.  You know the one:  the one that starts off ""I am the bone of my sword...."".  On that one Junichi Suwabe did a pretty decent job of saying it with his Japanese accent so minimal you hardly notice it.  I was hoping in the English dub it would sound better, and when Liam O'brien says it, it sounds pretty good I must say.  But Sam Regal (English voice of Shirou) doesn't even do this one very well.

I partly blame Kristi Reed, the voice over director & ADR scripter for a big part of this, as her work on this movie flat out fails to impress me, so I can't put all the blame on the VA's, but even so there just seems to be a penchant for sounding too formal & even almost stoic when giving their lines.  I mean it's like they have an aversion to using contractions when they talk and they go out of the way to enunciate all their words when they don't have to.  And for some strange reason they even re-did the voice of the servant ""Berserker"" in this movie, and all he did in both versions was grunt & growl & roar.  Go figure. *shrugs*

All in all for about 17 bucks it's not a bad product to own, especially if you're a fan of the Fate/Stay franchise (or ""Nasuverse""), unless you're a purist who avidly plays the games all the time and nitpicks about what anime adaptations leave out.  But the visuals by Studio Deen are still pretty impressive, as are the character designs and just the overall look and feel of the movie.  So long as you're OK with that and you don't expect too much from the dub if you try to watch it with that instead of in the original Japanese, then I think it's worth picking up.",1340668800,,3168,4.350340136054422
5092444,5,B007K7IAHQ,"I've waited for the dubbed version of Unlimited Blade Works since the October '09 issue of Megami and I wasn't disappointed. I was especially pleased to hear the original voice actors and Saber's dialog was so minimal that the change from Kate Higgins was acceptable. Oddly, Saber is not listed in the English Credits, but my first thought upon hearing her was ""that's not Saber, that's Rukia""...yes Michelle Ruff. I was very pleased with this anime. The biggest drawback I could find was that it's ""approximately 105 minutes"", which doesn't leave much time for character (or plot) development--so, for any real understanding of the characters and story, watching the original Fate/Stay Night series is a must.
Great visual experience, wonderful plot, and good dialog...for those familiar with the original series, strap in and enjoy the ride, for those who aren't--well, I hope you don't get too lost.",1339632000,7,902,5.142857142857143
5092445,3,B007K7IAHQ,"This release looks like it was just slapped together, with little regard to accuracy and consistency. There are numerous errors throughout the movie. Numerous times in the Japanese dub, the subtitles show 'magus', when the characters are saying the English word 'master'. The subtitles show 'magic circuit', when Japanese speaking Gilgamesh says ""Reality Marble."" The subs are really basic in many scenes, and could have been treated better.

I will admit, it was pleasant to hear most of the English cast from Fate/Stay Night return. It isn't without fault, however. There is a different voice for Saber (she did a pretty good job), and she ruins the famous quote when she is summoned. Instead of ""Are you my master?"" she says, ""Are you worthy enough to be my master?"" Also, the English dub sounds awful when a character is to scream.

These are the the points that stick out in my mind, as I just watched it last night. I know there's more errors than what I listed. Would I have still purchased this movie, knowing about all the mistakes? Perhaps. I want to support the anime industry. But I think I'll stick with my downloaded version with better subs than this version provides...",1339459200,3,1185,4.803921568627451
5092446,4,B007K7IAHQ,"Fate - Unlimited Blade Works is alternative storyline to the visual novel Fate/Stay Night, so basically it opens exactly the same as the original anime and branches off at some point (Stay Night-original anime; Unlimited Blade Works-this movie; Heaven's Feel-final path/unanimated).  Unfortunately this movie can only make perfect sense if you are at least familiar with the original story, as it merely glosses over many of the character introductions.  This is both good and bad.  It's good if you don't want to see some parts all over again, but bad if you are completely new to the series.

The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumia proved that an anime movie can succeed as a long epic tale (3 hours!), so I wish they took the same process and made this movie longer as well.  As the beginning is rushed you might think this could be your run-of-the-mill anime movie/retelling, but it's not.  Taking all the negatives into consideration, I can't rate this film any less than 4 stars, as the story and action are just that great.

This isn't some movie where the main cast are merely co-stars to the main plot (FMA, Bleach, Naruto, I'm looking at you), but a fully engrossing tale that tells you many new things about everyone in the Fate world that you may not already know.  If you are wondering if you have to watch to original anime to understand this movie, then yes, somewhat, but do you have to watch it to make it enjoyable, heck no!  The anime and the movie compliment each other, making the other that much more enjoyable by watching both.

I'd love nothing more than to rate this movie 5 stars, but I have to cut it down by one for it's rushed opening. Still, a solid 4 out of 5.",1338854400,25,1688,4.578073089700997
5092447,5,B007K7IAHQ,"For those wishing to dive into the Fate/ franchise, this film assumes that you at least have the basics down.  So freshening up on the basic story is highly recommended.  Unlimited Blade Works is a much darker take on the Fate/Stay Night storyline introducing new perspective to the Paradox that becomes ""Fate/Stay Night"".  Within just a few minutes the film breaks into non-stop action that carries itself throughout the duration of the film.

Fate/Stay Night is the perfect story for any Super-Action hero maniac in love with the constant struggles of their favorite Superheroes.  Fate/ brings to life many different personalities that reside inside the various historical ""Heroes of Legend"" that become the ""Servants"" that fight for the epic Holy Grail (apparently not the chalice from the Judeo-Christian religion, but from the Babylonian mythos... though I didn't catch this until the recent Fate/Zero TV series).

This film does not fail to deliver a gorgeous level of detailed backgrounds and colorful characters, and smooth animation (however there is one scene in the beginning after the opening title that seems to be a bit less animated than it probably needed to be.  But that's just me nitpicking a little.)

I probably wouldn't recommend this film to the youngest of children.  Due to its violence and excessive bloodshed (I realize it's 2D animated blood) the film most likely would earn a PG-13 if it were rated according to the American Film standards.

For those who enjoy this movie I highly recommend the latest installment of the Fate series ""Fate/Zero"" which does a marvelous job of explaining details about Fate/Stay Night and gives a powerful insight into how everything happened the way it did.

I hope you enjoy this film as I have.
This review is written before the English Dub release- so = I hope this film proves to have good voice acting
Also, should this film do well, I hope Sentai Filmworks takes great consideration into licensing and dubbing Fate/Zero as that series seems to be even MORE breathtaking than this film was.",1336435200,5,2057,5.002932551319648
5092448,5,B007K7IAHQ,"I have recently become a very big fan of all the adaptations of The FATE/Stay Night series. I would even go as far as to say that it is the best Action/Fantasy story I have read/watched in the last Ten years. With that said, This movie Doesn't explain KEY Story points very well to make the time constraints of a Theatrical picture. In order to understand the movie entirely without Torrenting the original game (Which I don't feel is a bad idea, but it does contain sex scenes, you are warned), I suggest looking up the original Anime and watching that first. It explains almost everything that is relevant to the this movie.

With that said, I still give this movie FIVE stars. It is one of the best anime films I ever seen. Unlimited Blade Works is my personal favorite of the three story lines. The Action is beautifully animated and flawless in every aspect. The story is still gripping and very through despite the time constraints. I don't know how the dubbing will turn or if they will bring back the original cast for the dubbing, but It will well be worth the money regardless.

In short, It is not perfect, but you will not be disappointed. If it is a random buy, You will love it. If you are a fan, You will love it.

8518698,3,B007K7IAHQ,"Visual novels and anime can seem quite similar, but this movie is a perfect example of how they are different.  Add a star if you are at least familiar enough with the game through other sources to follow this movie, add another if you love it, but everyone else is going to spend an awful lot of this movie going, ""What?"" because 105 minutes is not time enough to understand what the heck is going on no matter how beautifully animated the fight scenes are.

Essentially seven magic users assisted by seven great heroes are battling it out for the Holy Grail which will grant the winning pair a couple of wishes, and this movie depicts the ""Unlimited Blade Works"" arc.  That's pretty much it, though the movie tries to take you in a straight line at a dead run through the plot.
