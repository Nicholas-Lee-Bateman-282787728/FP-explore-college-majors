3161812,5,B0016MLILG,"A set of four movies:

-Hotel America
The beautiful Helene (Catherine Deneuve) works in a hospital as an anaesthesiologist. She accidentally hits Gilles (Patrick Dewaere) while driving her car.

The two of them go back and forth in a cat-and-mouse game until Helene tires of going nowhere and decides to leave for Paris.

Gille's attraction to a friend of him makes him rather dull than real.

-J'embrasse pas (I do not kiss)
Young, naive and innocent, Pierre (Manuel Blanc) has dreams of becoming an actor.

He gets a job as an orderly at a hospital and is further supported by an older woman (Helene Vincent), a nurse he has met there, in return for his sexual favours.

However, in his acting class, he quickly discovers that he is not overflowing with talent and becomes a full-time sex worker.

He has the poor judgement to fall in love with a high-class prostitute (Emmanuelle Bart) and earns the antagonism of her pimp.

-My Favourite Season
Family matriarch Berthe (Marthe Villalonga) is advancing in years and developing health problems, so she goes to live with her daughter Emilie (Catherine Deneuve).

When Christmas arrives, Emilie's troubled brother Antoine (Daniel Auteuil) arrives at the house for a visit. He and Emilie have not spoken since their father's funeral three years ago. Despite his attempts to maintain control, Antoine quickly comes into conflict with Bruno. Painful emotional realities from the past return and cause violent conclusions.

Incest motives.

-Wild Reeds
This is a nostalgic French coming-of-age drama set in a Provence deeply divided over the war for independence being waged against French colonialism in Algeria of 1962.

A class master is attracted to a former pupil-a soldier having arrived from Algeria for getting married and deserting from army, while at boarding school brother of him spent a night with a fellow school lad happened to be the best friend of a class master's daughter-young communist.

In addition, a daughter shared her favours with a pupil of the same  class-a French-Algerian radical twenty-one y.o. man having his own plans on her gay beau, as a soldier was being killed in Algeria on his return and his young wife was looking at possibilities with his younger brother  searching between partners in and out a school.

3161817,5,B0016MLILG,"Ive been a fan of Andre Techine for a few years now.  His string of films in the early 90s were just incredible, and so when I saw that three of those films were together in this DVD collection, I was excited.  I also liked the fact that a film from him from the 80s was included, especially since I had never seen it before.

Im not sure why Hotel America is here.  Thematically, it doesnt come up to the power found in My Favorite Season, Wild Reeds or I Dont Kiss, and chronologically, it is very far removed (there are four films and an entire decade between them).  I would have much rather had the collection include Thieves, which would have been the next in line (it was released after Wild Reeds) and would have fit the themes presented in these films (sex, violence, adolescence, family).  Hotel America just feels kind of flat, despite having a very nicely layered performance from Catherine Deneuve.

Wild Reeds and My Favorite Season are exceptional films though, especially Wild Reeds, which covers the sexual turmoil of a group if kids really well.  I Dont Kiss is easily the heaviest of the four films here, and it covers some very controversial stuff (prostitution and rape) and yet handles it with a keen and sharp eye.  Its not the best in the group, but it shows Techines strength as a director.

I wish this had Thieves attached, which is one of my favorites, but alas, you cant have everything.  Still, for the price this is WELL WORTH IT and a collection I highly recommend!",1391990400,,1497,4.5278810408921935

3161823,4,B0016MLILG,"The five motion pictures in this collection are Manon 70, Le Sauvage, Hotel des Ameriques, Le Choc, and Fort Saganne. The best is probably Le Choc, co-starring Alain Delon as a hired killer anxious to retire; his performance rivals that of Deneuve. Le Sauvage is a romantic comedy, which Deneuve does quite well, helped by the superb acting ability of Yves Montand. Gerard Depardieu co-stars in Fort Saganne, and his acting ability certainly helps the realism of this picture. The other two are somewhat lesser in quality, but interesting in that they reflect the odd mores of the French from 1968 to 1981. I enjoyed them all, but Le Choc is definitely my favorite among the five. In any case, five Deneuve movies for such a low price is certainly a bargain.",1379116800,,758,4.75
3161824,3,B0016MLILG,"It's a French film. That says most of what needs to be said about the story. There is lots of smoking. Lots. It's almost humorous how often people smoke, and where. And of course, there's lots of Catherine Deneuve, who of course is why the film was made. By ""lots,"" I don't mean nudity. The barest the French beauty ever gets is bare shouldered in a bathtub with her man. There's lots of her face, her perfect, mesmerizing, beautiful face. And there's lots of long, blonde hair that needs to be swept out of her face every few seconds. It's distracting how much she does it. It simply illustrates how impractical hair styles of the period were.

The color of the film was also typical of the period, rich and suggestive of Kodachrome saturation in still photography, and people wear clothes that normal people never wear. Except maybe in France.

Manon 70 is short on a real sense of story. It's hard to develop any great sense of sympathy for its mostly shallow characters, who are mostly concerned with who is going to have sex with whom.

Ok so you don't get Belle Du jour, the last metro, repulsion, or even the hunger in this one but it is still worth checking out. For that reason, I would say that's what sets Catherine Deneuve apart from all the other actors even at their worst.

Allow me to discuss briefly most of the films included in this collection.

Manon 70: It's a fun movie to watch. Perhaps it drags a little but you get to see Catherine portray a playful vixen.

Le sauvage: Catherine makes a great pair with Yves Montand in this one! Seeing the film being shot in Caracas Venezuela in the 70's was especially a treat for me personally.

Htel des amriques: I think this one is considered the best one in this set by most people. I think it was a good film. Dramatic and icy at times. The story is definitely intriguing and has a fine ending.

Le choc: Many would argue that there is a better film of Catherine with Alain Delon out there called Un Flic directed by Jean Pierre Melville. While I'll agree with that notion, I'll also say that Le Choc wasn't necessarily bad. It's a gangster story with a dramatic romantic flair.",1350259200,4,1247,4.475770925110132
3161829,5,B0016MLILG,"Foreign films seem to be few and far between because of limited distribution and we have companies like Lionsgate who have acquired the negatives and rights of some great rare gems.  This collection not only highlights the talent and beauty of Catherine Deneuve but also gives us a great insight on basic French filmmaking.  With a diverse series of titles, this collection shows how Deneuve could light up the screen in every thing she was in.  This set is represented by comedy: Director Jean Paul Rappeneau's 'LE SAUVAGE'-1975 starring Yves Montand playing Cary Grant to Denueve's Katherine Hepburn character with a cameo appearance by American actress Dana Wynter, Swinging Sixties Op Art utilizing the Manon Lascout legend and upgrading it to a sexy affair in Director Jean Aurel's 'MANON 70'- 1968 also cameoing another American actor Robert Webber and gorgeous color photography by Edmond Richard, Crime thrillers such as Director Robin Davis's underrated 'LE CHOC'- 1982 with a great performance by Alain Delon playing an assassin wanting to quit the business, Psychological pot boilers such as Director Andre Techine's off beat 'HOTEL DES AMERIQUES'- 1981, and lastly Epic films as in Director Alain Corneau's three hour opus 'FORT SAGANNE'- 1984 where Catherine is reduced to a 20 minute cameo and giving another shattering beauty Sophie Marceau in an early performance much more screen time sharing things with actors Gerard Depardieu and Philippe Noiret.  They also boast great music scores by France's lead composers Michel Legrand for 'LE SAUVAGE' and Philippe Sarde who does 'LE CHOC' , 'HOTEL DES AMERIQUES' and the magnificent score to 'FORT SAGANNE'.  Each film is presented in its original aspect ratio in French with English Subtitles but no extras.  Kudos to Lionsgate for resurrecting these fine titles for American audiences and showing the rare beauty of an exceptional woman.",1346025600,8,1900,5.254125412541254

While this collection contains some of her more conventional performances, her beauty & her talent cannot be denied. I have an upscaling blu-ray player which renders these movies into better quality than I would have seen at my local cinema in the '70's/80's which will satisfy me until they're released on blu-ray.",1269907200,2,484,5.139240506329114
3161832,5,B0016MLILG,"The only Techin film I've seen before is ""Wild Reeds"". I've been trying to buy it on DVD, which proved either virtually impossible or cripplingly expensive. Then I saw the listing for this compilation, which was not only cheaper than other copies of the film, but contained four films in total!

In addition to giving a broad idea of Techin's career, the collection allows one to see the wonderful Catherine Deneuve twice (in ""Hotel America"" and ""My favourite season""), as well as other familiar French actors, like Daniel Auteuil (""My favourite season"") and Philippe Noiret (""I don't kiss"").

""Hotel America"" shows how obsessive love can construct and destruct lives. As the film is understated in the European way, it is useful to see it more than once to begin sensing the attraction of the protagonists to each other.

""I don't kiss"" portrays the life journey of a young man who has fallen out with his family and works hard to rebuild his life in the seedy underworld of Paris. The young Marcel Blanc was awarded a Csar as Most Promising Actor for his role.

In ""My favourite season"" an estranged brother and sister (Auteuil and Deneuve) have to decide what is best for their ageing mother. The subtle complexities and interplay of interpersonal relationships are wonderfully depicted.

""Wild reeds"" is often regarded as Techin's masterpiece, and the intricate complications of young people coming of age, especially within a difficult period of French history (the years just before Algeria's independence), make this tale particularly enjoyable. Interesting to see the young Gael Morel as an actor - he became a strong director in his own right, making searing and violent films like ""The Clan"". His co-stars in ""Wild reeds"", Stephane Rideau and Elodie Bouchez, have made good careers for themselves and have later acted opposite each other for Morel. The film shows some scenes which most people would be able to identify with: unrequited love, the loss of a family member, attraction despite ideological differences, the tension before exam results are published. The scene with Serge(Rideau) and Francois (Morel) on the motorcycle is one that has haunted me for years now.

This collection is surely a solid introduction to Techin's cinematic tales. Like the best directors he shows us stories that are familiar and strange at the same time, forcing us to identify, evaluate and grow.

The set is presented well, with the first two films on one DVD. The three discs are tightly packed in a container of the same size as an ordinary DVD holder.

A final tongue-in-cheek comment: I wonder when European movies, especially films from France, are going to reflect the new vogue of curtailing smoking. Has there ever been a French film with a main character who doesn't smoke?!",1251936000,8,2782,5.0064935064935066

Le sauvage: Catherine makes a great pair with Yves Montand in this one! Seeing the film being shot in Caracas Venezuela in the 70's was especially a treat for me personally.

Htel des amriques: I think this one is considered the best one in this set by most people. I think it was a good film. Dramatic and icy at times. The story is definitely intriguing and has a fine ending.

Le choc: Many would argue that there is a better film of Catherine with Alain Delon out there called Un Flic directed by Jean Pierre Melville. While I'll agree with that notion, I'll also say that Le Choc wasn't necessarily bad. It's a gangster story with a dramatic romantic flair.",1350259200,4,1247,4.475770925110132
3396326,5,B0016MLILG,"Foreign films seem to be few and far between because of limited distribution and we have companies like Lionsgate who have acquired the negatives and rights of some great rare gems.  This collection not only highlights the talent and beauty of Catherine Deneuve but also gives us a great insight on basic French filmmaking.  With a diverse series of titles, this collection shows how Deneuve could light up the screen in every thing she was in.  This set is represented by comedy: Director Jean Paul Rappeneau's 'LE SAUVAGE'-1975 starring Yves Montand playing Cary Grant to Denueve's Katherine Hepburn character with a cameo appearance by American actress Dana Wynter, Swinging Sixties Op Art utilizing the Manon Lascout legend and upgrading it to a sexy affair in Director Jean Aurel's 'MANON 70'- 1968 also cameoing another American actor Robert Webber and gorgeous color photography by Edmond Richard, Crime thrillers such as Director Robin Davis's underrated 'LE CHOC'- 1982 with a great performance by Alain Delon playing an assassin wanting to quit the business, Psychological pot boilers such as Director Andre Techine's off beat 'HOTEL DES AMERIQUES'- 1981, and lastly Epic films as in Director Alain Corneau's three hour opus 'FORT SAGANNE'- 1984 where Catherine is reduced to a 20 minute cameo and giving another shattering beauty Sophie Marceau in an early performance much more screen time sharing things with actors Gerard Depardieu and Philippe Noiret.  They also boast great music scores by France's lead composers Michel Legrand for 'LE SAUVAGE' and Philippe Sarde who does 'LE CHOC' , 'HOTEL DES AMERIQUES' and the magnificent score to 'FORT SAGANNE'.  Each film is presented in its original aspect ratio in French with English Subtitles but no extras.  Kudos to Lionsgate for resurrecting these fine titles for American audiences and showing the rare beauty of an exceptional woman.",1346025600,8,1900,5.254125412541254
3396327,1,B0016MLILG,"I have seen Catherine Deneuve in over fifty films and this collection brings together what must be the worst of her career.
In fact, my friends and I watched over half of FORT SAGANNE and she failed to even appear!  In HOTEL DES AMERIQUES she looked, as usual, stunningly attractive but her character was poorly scripted and even cartoonish in LE SAUVAGE.  So much for an ""Amazon recommendation""!",1310601600,4,396,4.8088235294117645
3396328,4,B0016MLILG,"Catherine Deneuve is one of the most beautiful & (given her status) adventurous actresses in the history of cinema (Belle de Jour, Repulsion, La Syrene du Mississippi). While this collection contains some of her more conventional performances, her beauty & her talent cannot be denied. I have an upscaling blu-ray player which renders these movies into better quality than I would have seen at my local cinema in the '70's/80's which will satisfy me until they're released on blu-ray.",1269907200,2,484,5.139240506329114
3396329,5,B0016MLILG,"The only Techin film I've seen before is ""Wild Reeds"". I've been trying to buy it on DVD, which proved either virtually impossible or cripplingly expensive. Then I saw the listing for this compilation, which was not only cheaper than other copies of the film, but contained four films in total!

In addition to giving a broad idea of Techin's career, the collection allows one to see the wonderful Catherine Deneuve twice (in ""Hotel America"" and ""My favourite season""), as well as other familiar French actors, like Daniel Auteuil (""My favourite season"") and Philippe Noiret (""I don't kiss"").

""Hotel America"" shows how obsessive love can construct and destruct lives. As the film is understated in the European way, it is useful to see it more than once to begin sensing the attraction of the protagonists to each other.

""I don't kiss"" portrays the life journey of a young man who has fallen out with his family and works hard to rebuild his life in the seedy underworld of Paris. The young Marcel Blanc was awarded a Csar as Most Promising Actor for his role.

In ""My favourite season"" an estranged brother and sister (Auteuil and Deneuve) have to decide what is best for their ageing mother. The subtle complexities and interplay of interpersonal relationships are wonderfully depicted.

""Wild reeds"" is often regarded as Techin's masterpiece, and the intricate complications of young people coming of age, especially within a difficult period of French history (the years just before Algeria's independence), make this tale particularly enjoyable. Interesting to see the young Gael Morel as an actor - he became a strong director in his own right, making searing and violent films like ""The Clan"". His co-stars in ""Wild reeds"", Stephane Rideau and Elodie Bouchez, have made good careers for themselves and have later acted opposite each other for Morel. The film shows some scenes which most people would be able to identify with: unrequited love, the loss of a family member, attraction despite ideological differences, the tension before exam results are published. The scene with Serge(Rideau) and Francois (Morel) on the motorcycle is one that has haunted me for years now.

This collection is surely a solid introduction to Techin's cinematic tales. Like the best directors he shows us stories that are familiar and strange at the same time, forcing us to identify, evaluate and grow.

The set is presented well, with the first two films on one DVD. The three discs are tightly packed in a container of the same size as an ordinary DVD holder.

A final tongue-in-cheek comment: I wonder when European movies, especially films from France, are going to reflect the new vogue of curtailing smoking. Has there ever been a French film with a main character who doesn't smoke?!",1251936000,8,2782,5.0064935064935066
