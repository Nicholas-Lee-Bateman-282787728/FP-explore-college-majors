3730028,5,B001OD8E2S,Really enjoyed these fantastic talented song birds.  Singing such a variety of music in one concert impresses me in the highest.  Can hardly wait until they record the next dvd (don't wait too long and this is a must).  Money well spent and I highly recommend.,1253059200,4,260,4.608695652173913
3730029,5,B001OD8E2S,"I caught the last end of this performance on PBS in Flint, Mi and am I happy I did. I had never heard of these ladies until then. I called the university and then went on line to see how I could obtain this video and ordered this, but another two. I am definitely happy I did. the DIVAS are the ""bomb"". Great entertaining. I recommend these videos to persons of the ""baby boomer"" generation who are not into the rap scene. Enjoy -- I still am.",1248739200,4,443,4.103448275862069
3730030,4,B001OD8E2S,"The divas were very good. Actually better than when I saw them live. I'm giving 4 stars because the editing was choppy and some of the best performances were put under the 'extras'.  The performances were haunting, funny, energetic, majestic...I could go on. There is something there for everyone.",1246752000,2,297,5.061224489795919

8330464,5,B001OD8E2S,What a blast!  These ladies are wonderful.  They are so talented that I can't believe they are not as well known to the public.  They are the female version of The 3 Mo' Tenors.  I'd love to see them do a show together!,1425772800,,219,4.023255813953488

8330466,5,B001OD8E2S,"I bought this because I had watched ""3 mo Tenors"" .  I enjoyed this show but it wasn't the same kind of orchestration.  I still enjoyed the show though.",1363824000,,152,4.206896551724138
8330467,5,B001OD8E2S,"These ladies are highly recommended. If you're a music enthusiast,then this is for you. They draw you in with their melodic harmonies from all genres and times. I'd love to be in the audience to take them all in....and looking forward to their next release.",1297036800,,257,4.733333333333333
8330468,5,B001OD8E2S,"We thoroughly enjoyed these ladies.  Not only was there wonderful concert footage, but it was interdispersed with some interviews and film of the ladies practicing. We had never heard them before. They have excellent voices, are classically trained but can sing anything.  Their songs ranged from blues to opera and each one brought their own distinct personality and style to the song. Each week we take out a concert video and have concert night and believe me these ladies are absolutely amazing and their voices will thrill you.  I especially enjoyed the Billy Holiday songs, and at times it was easy to forget you were watching this on tv and not in a club or theatre. Fabulous.",1286409600,,683,4.82051282051282
8330469,5,B001OD8E2S,"Excellent music and fun to watch these versitile ladies perform with style, diginity and poise",1268870400,,94,5.333333333333333
8330470,5,B001OD8E2S,"what beautiful voices they have,i was so excited upon watching this concert, there ability to attempt any category of music took me by surprise and left me looking and hoping there was more dvd's of them, oh well looks like i have to pray and wait, i'm sure there are lots more like me doing the same, makes one sit on the edge of your in anticipation. it truly floored me, never being fond of opera these three women made me feel ashamed, they sing it and everything with grace and passion, yes it makes you emotional and even fonder  of music and the singers and musicians who perform it for us all, my only regret with life is that i was never blessed with this beautiful ability, so folks- are we all waiting for there next dvd? i hope so",1263254400,,742,4.26241134751773
8330471,5,B001OD8E2S,"Thesewomen are very talented, with NO technical manipulations needed to ""help"" their voices. The world needs to be reminded of how there are talented, educated, positive Black women (and men, in the band!) out there doing things WELL and uplifting the world, one audience at a time. PLEASE buy this and show it to your friends and children-- it really is inspiring!",1256601600,6,365,4.903225806451613
