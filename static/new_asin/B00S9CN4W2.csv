8697829,5,B00S9CN4W2,"I love classic movies, especially from the 30s and 40s, and I first discovered the comic duo of Wally Brown and Alan Carney in a Turner Classic Movies broadcast of their hard-to-find 1944 movie, Seven Days Ashore. I remember watching that film and alternately blinking and laughing at the surprises. Of course, one of the goofiest moments in that movie is a no-holds-barred performance of novelty musician Freddie Fisher as Colonel Corn. This truly was nutty comedy at such a wild-and-woolly level that I was hooked.

So, when this four-film set of Brown and Carney movies became available, naturally I wanted to see these movies, too. And, to set this in context, it is true that Brown and Carney were often dismissed as being like Abbott and Costello. Yes, thats a valid critique and, in fact, some of the B-budget movies they made were mirrors of other popular comedies. But Brown and Carney did have a charm all their own.

In their debut pairing, the 1943 Adventures of a Rookie that is included in this set, we have standard 1940s silliness about guys who find themselves thrown together in boot camp. This particular plot is complicated by a public-health quarantine that locks GIs in a home with an equal number of young ladies. You can imagine how that idea goes down with the girls parents! But the real gem in this movie is when rotund Alan Carneyout of the bluebegins performing impressions of other movie stars from the era. The scene comes out of nowhere, but it steals the show!

Their antics continue through the other three films in this set. And, like a lot of the B-budget black-and-white movies of this vintage, they're all just a little over an hour long. Short and sweet. If you can appreciate the general sense of humor in this era, theyll definitely make you smile.

Im hoping that the producers of this DVD set will soon release more of their movies and, in particular, the zany Seven Days Ashore. Yes, as Ive written here, its true that Brown and Carney were teamed in these movies because they were similar to other, more popular, comedy teams. But they had a charm all their own and most of their films have these moments of inspired, break-through creativity that make this a cant-miss set for viewers who love classics from this era.",1489017600,,2263,4.707070707070707
8697830,4,B00S9CN4W2,Not as bad as some have had us believe over the years.  I rather like Brown and Carney.  You get Bela Lugose AND Lionel Atwill in the last one on here.  I'd get a volume 2 if there ever was one.,1443225600,,194,3.682926829268293
8697831,5,B00S9CN4W2,"Its so great to finally see the comedy team of Wally Brown and Alan Carney get their own DVD set after so many years.  The picture quality is excellent.  Brown and Carney had both worked for RKO Pictures and appeared in three films together before they were made into a comedy team beginning with Adventures of a Rookie.  They were considered RKOs answer to Abbott and Costello.  This DVD set includes four films they made together at RKO:  Adventures of a Rookie, Rookies in Burma, Girl Rush, and Genius at Work.  The duo play characters Jerry Miles (Brown) and Mike Strager (Carney) in these four films.  Adventures of a Rookie and Rookies in Burma have some similarities to Abbott and Costellos Buck Privates films.  Girl Rush also stars Robert Mitchum.  Genius at Work was their last film together as a team.  It also stars Bela Lugosi and was a remake of Wheeler and Woolseys The Nitwits.  Its a shame they didn't include their other films as a team: Step Lively (a remake of the Marx Brothers Room Service that also stars Frank Sinatra), Seven Days Ashore, Radio Stars on Parade, and Zombies on Broadway (which also stars Bela Lugosi).  After their RKO contract ended in 1946, Brown and Carney continued to work separately in films.  The two did appear in Disneys The Absent-Minded Professor in 1961.  Promos for the film originally listed them as ""the comedy team of Brown and Carney"" but unfortunately they shared no scenes together.  Hopefully Warner Archive will release another DVD set of the rest of Brown and Carneys films at RKO.",1438128000,4,1543,4.7481203007518795
