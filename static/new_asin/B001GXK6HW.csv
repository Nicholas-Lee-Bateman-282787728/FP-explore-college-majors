3621824,1,B001GXK6HW,"Destiny (Millena Gay) is a successful advertising exec. who is going through a painful divorce with Will (Byron Marc Newsome) a man who verbally berates her. On the rebound she meets Troy (Rich Paul) who is an extreme player, although I never got the impression either men were ""thugs."" Troy opens Destiny sexualLY as they go to a sex club. Destiny works suffers a little, she talks to a shrink, and sits in a church. Roll credits.

The acting was poor and the writing horrible.

Sex, no nudity",1341705600,2,494,4.6022727272727275
3621825,5,B001GXK6HW,I heard that this is a great movie so i order it for myself i want it to add to my collection so i would have it to watch for eyes only,1326844800,,135,3.25
3621826,4,B001GXK6HW,"I watched this movie out of the sheer randomness of it, and I can't say I was disappointed. Of course going into it, you have to know that it's going to be bad. It looks like it was made in someone's basement, and no one really cared too much about the quality of the filmmaking and the acting is somewhat atrocious. That said, it was actually a fun viewing, because I was laughing at it the whole time. I was confused and interested at the same time, I simply could not look away. And for that, Thug Love is the mini-masterpiece that it deserves to be. Title rightfully given.",1307318400,,577,4.302752293577981
3621827,5,B001GXK6HW,This item has been passed around throughout my Women's group. We had a good time going back down memory lane for some . For others lessons learned early.,1294617600,,153,4.5
3621828,1,B001GXK6HW,"This was probably one of the lowest buget film ever.  The wife is unbelievable with the worse weave that even the projects would produce.  The plot...what plot.  The gf's, give me a break!!!  Troy is fine but ignorant and no class!

BTW It's apparent there wasn't a clothing budget because the wife is seen in the same dress repeatedly throughout the film.",1293408000,2,356,4.67741935483871
3621829,3,B001GXK6HW,it was ok i liked it not something i would by though but does anyone know the name of the song that plays at the end of the movie and who it's by if so please tell me so i can try to pull it up to put it on my upod,1279929600,,214,3.1346153846153846
3621830,1,B001GXK6HW,"I was not expecting a lot from this movie, the plot already seemed predictable. This movie is such a waste of time. If it wasn't to the fact that I have to finish watching the movie regardless how bad it is, I would have switched it off from the start. The acting was so so poor. It feels as if this movie was a college project made by 15-year-olds not buy adult professionals. The sex scenes were ridiculous, for example, how was one meant to have sex while having pants on? If you are looking for some good drama/romantic movie then keep on looking, cz this won't be the right choice. I so regret watching it! No substance at all! Truly feel for those, who wasted their money on it.",1271808000,5,684,4.269230769230769
3621831,1,B001GXK6HW,"I don't even know where to begin on this one. From the start of the movie the plot was suspect. The character development was nonexistent as one character that was loosely referenced (a daughter) was never seen.
The husband was a total cornball and seemed to repeat the same few lines throughout the entire movie.
The wife is a total airhead and just puts all her personal biz on blast to her gf's, who by the way added absolutely little value to the plot.
This brings me to the ""Thug Love"" Troy. Never was it established what actually did for a living. Only at the end did we find out he was living with his gf, who gave the green light for him to have this affair with the wife-again poor character development.
The movie looked like it was shot with a camcorder as the filmed looked grainy at times and the sound quality was poor.
This movie should have been part of buy one get ""Thug Love"" free promo.
This is definitely one you watch on Sat night, when you have no other options and the weather is bad !",1269043200,3,1008,4.282722513089006
3621832,1,B001GXK6HW,"THIS MOVIE IS ONLY WORTH A DOLLAR! AND I DO MEAN $1.00! The movie is clearly a indie, low budget film so I didn't expect anything ""spectacular"". But I was expecting to watch a good, romantic, thug movie. I was hoping for drama and suspense. Instead I got a boring product that was a waist of money. If I had paid $1.00, I wouldn't feel so cheated, because that's all it's worth.",1267401600,5,378,4.263888888888889
3621833,4,B001GXK6HW,"I enjoyed this movie because it really tells a story about how easily it is for a woman to get herself involved with men who really have no real purpose in their lives and mean them no good ..AT ALL!! The film could have been shot a little better but the point throughout it tells a great story. It spreads out a lot of pain and very questionable actions on the part of a couple who has lost their way in their marriage and how without compromise, there is nothing else except hopelessness between the two of them. The fight between them is all mental and serves absolutely no purpose to either one of them in the end. In this movie you do not have to search for any answers on your own because the film makers tell it all loud and clear. Very entertaining and your mouth will be wide open on some parts throughout it.",1263081600,8,818,4.2165605095541405

8307349,1,B001GXK6HW,"Thank God for Amazon Prime and not having to pay to watch. Only reason I kept watching bid because I hate starting something and not finishing. Terrible actors, Troy was a typical street n**** with no job, class, or goals. Destiny is just plain dumb. Will needs to kill himself because he was NOT what he thought he was. This movie was a waste of my precious time. Couldn't write my review without giving at least one star. I give the movie itself 0 stars but the cover was catchy so, there's your one star.",1515628800,2,507,4.347368421052631
