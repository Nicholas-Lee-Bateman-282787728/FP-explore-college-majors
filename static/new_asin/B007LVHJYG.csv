We learned a ton and got so many great ideas for our basement.  We have a basement that is not completed yet and now we have a couple of ideas of what we want it to look like.  Thanks Basement Dave! You do amazing work!",1363305600,,390,3.825

8519472,5,B007LVHJYG,"I'm not your average guy when it comes to tackling a home project, but I know from owning many homes and doing it myself or bringing in a professional, that it's always great when you get some advice from someone who has been their. Most of the time after a few minutes you can tell who knows thier stuff and who's blowing smoke.
This video is worth every penny and more, if your thinking of a basement project this video will empower you to know what to do and what to look for. It's filled with years of doing it advice. If you get just one thing out of this video you will say it was worth it, I walked away with tons. Most guys like Dave won't share what they know but this guy gives it all and more. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone. Thanks Basement Dave",1360972800,,775,4.105263157894737
8519473,5,B007LVHJYG,"""Create a Beautiful Basement"" is simply the best novice remodeling DVD I've seen to date.  You can easily find basement remodeling books, but to have material presented in a video presentation is fantastic.  This production takes what can be often dry, droll information, and makes it interesting.

The focus of the DVD is around a main basement remodel project, with information broken down for various projects as the main project goes along.  It's important to note that this is NOT a DIY how-to guide to doing a basement remodel by yourself.  The DVD IS intended to advise the novice about what things to consider and what options are available when it comes to doing a basement remodel project.  What you can take away from the presentation is what projects you will be capable of by yourself, and which you would be best to leave to professionals.

The best part of ""Create a Beautiful Basement"" is that the presenter (""Basement Dave"") starts with an empty existing space (right down to the concrete), and turns it into a fully functional living space by the end of the program. This includes design, tools, framing, insulation, plumbing, electrical, finish carpentry, flooring, appliances, etc. Practical advice is offered, as opposed to the theoretical jibberish in most how-to books.  In one example, Dave deals with the realities you may face in older homes with uneven concrete floors and crooked studs; problems that don't arise in a perfectly square world but can be a nightmare if overlooked.

The online content free trial included with the ""Create a Beautiful Basement"" DVD is really useful to help you visualize your ideal basement living space.  Full of hundreds of pictures and layouts you're bound to find several examples to fit your personal tastes and desires.  The bonus wealth of information available online is worth more than the selling price of this DVD in my opinion.

Overall, ""Create a Beautiful Basement"" is presented for the novice, or even those who don't know what they want to get out of their subterranean space.  If you are planning to finish a basement in the near future, it's well worth your time to check out this DVD program.  You will gain great ideas for creating a modern looking impressive basement and help avoid the wasted time and money of not thoroughly planning your basement remodel.
