Unlike the movies Dudley Do-Right (1999) ASIN: B00004RFB2, you will find that Nell has an unnatural attraction to Dudley's horse. Or she just prefers intelligence.
An outstanding part of this series is the narrator, William Conrad who was the original Marshall Matt Dillon on the ""Gunsmoke"" radio show.
This film contains:
The Box Top Robbery (Boris & Natasha)
Snidely Prevents Dudley Do-Right from Marring Nell
An Enchanted Frog-Prince (Fractured Fairy Tales)
A Well-Learned Lesson is Taught (Aesop And Son)
