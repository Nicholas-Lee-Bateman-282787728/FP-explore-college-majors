5691731,3,B00C6F60QA,This movie was so-so.  I only watched it once.  It didn't make a big impact on me although there were good actors in this movie.,1391990400,,128,4.08
5691732,1,B00C6F60QA,I bought this based on the reviews that I read and it was terrible.  We threw it in the trash after watching it.  Not even worth selling at a garage sale.  The acting is terrible and the storyline isn't great.,1388102400,,209,4.175
5691733,5,B00C6F60QA,"Ok.  Have not seen movie yet, but I am sure it will be good.  Rockmond Dunbar is a very good actor.",1384300800,,99,3.6666666666666665
5691734,4,B00C6F60QA,I liked this movie.  It was a great plot of what we see in the real world.  Thanks for creating this movie.,1379116800,,107,3.8181818181818183

5691736,3,B00C6F60QA,"This play was a little too slow for me. I understand where they were going with the story, but I feel that they could have gotten there a little quicker. Rockmond Dunbar and Letoya Luckett are great and I will continue to support their work.",1376179200,,241,4.377777777777778
5691737,5,B00C6F60QA,Something good to sit and watch with a friend or family members ... People say for Richer or Poorer .. The title is what got my interest and the actors that are in this play also..,1375920000,,180,4.027777777777778
5691738,4,B00C6F60QA,This was a really good play. I thought it taught the importantance of marriage. If you don't get your way you shouldn't always try to run home to mom and dad.,1375228800,2,158,4.129032258064516
5691739,4,B00C6F60QA,"Aubrey (Rockmund Dunbar) and Kya (LeToya Luckett) have been married less than five years. Everything is going well financially until Aubrey loses his high paying job. Now, adjustments must be made and Kya is not pleased. A marriage tested. Will they be able to work things out or will they go their separate ways?

GMC TV (now called UP, meaning Uplifting Entertainment) airs stage plays - For Richer or Poorer is one of the best I've seen. Talented cast (Dunbar, in particular, and it was nice to see gospel music artist, Karen Clark Sheard, who made her television acting debut), thought-provoking and funny at times. It became a series and I watched, but I enjoyed this play much more.",1370131200,3,688,4.781512605042017
5691750,4,B00C6F60QA,I  really  enjoy the  play and  that  I  received my  DVD  in the  time  promised.  I  believe  Amazon  is  a very good  sure  to order merchandise.,1438300800,,148,4.076923076923077
5691751,4,B00C6F60QA,My wife and I like this movie. It is a typical movie and predictable but the acting was pretty good and somewhat believable.,1426464000,,124,4.434782608695652
5691752,3,B00C6F60QA,A little boring,1423526400,,15,4.333333333333333
5691753,3,B00C6F60QA,Mediocre. I had this title on another DVD and decided to see if they matched in any way. They were totally different. It's good to have them both though.,1419984000,,153,4.310344827586207
5691754,4,B00C6F60QA,"very entertaining,nice story line,has meaning",1416009600,,45,8.2
5691755,5,B00C6F60QA,This is a great movie at a great cost.  The delivery was fast too.  The packaging was good too. I absolutely love the actors in it. It's funny too. I highly recommend purchasing this item.,1403308800,,188,4.3428571428571425
5691756,5,B00C6F60QA,"I first saw this on Netflix. I am impressed with it's clean, yet very funny humor. It gives you a good look at how men and women think and how to be realistic in a marriage.",1402358400,,173,3.8333333333333335
5691757,3,B00C6F60QA,"if your into real stage plays for the story line, you won't like this one. but its a play that should just be a titled to let you know its a short not so comical movie. But its cute if your really bored and need something to do",1399852800,,227,3.75

8577703,5,B00C6F60QA,Love this movie with Rockmond Dunbar,1529798400,,36,5.166666666666667
8577704,5,B00C6F60QA,Just goes to show that money is the root of all evil. Latoya Luckett was really getting on my nerves at first being so spoiled and uppity. I'm glad she finally came to her senses. The worst time to kick a man is when he's down. He was a really good husband to her. All he ever thought about was making her happy even when he knew he couldn't afford her lavish lifestyle.,1520294400,,370,4.082191780821918
8577705,4,B00C6F60QA,Pretty good and very funny..  Chris Spencer was a pleasant surprise.,1516233600,,68,5.181818181818182

8577707,4,B00C6F60QA,"This was a really good play. It had a message in it and it was very motivational. It was not a stupid play where they make a lot of unfunny jokes and it's just lame. This play was actually well thought out and the actors were good actors. It was almost like a movie but done as a play. Although there are only two scenes in the play which is the barber shop and their home, i really enjoyed watching it. It was even funny at times and I have to admit, i passed this play up a couple of times because i thought it was going to be your typical play but I'm glad i decided to watch it. It is not depressing either, this play actually leaves you with a good feeling after you watch it. You can be married, single or in a relationship and learn something from the play. And what i like about the play is you can be in love or not in love and still watch it without getting depressed. It focuses more on the message being presented than it does on presenting just a love story.",1489708800,,971,4.010309278350515
8577708,3,B00C6F60QA,"I was expecting more out of the film, but it's alright for what was performed.",1487894400,,78,4.266666666666667
