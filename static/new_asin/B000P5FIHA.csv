8188948,5,B000P5FIHA,"One of the most anointed worship DVDs I've ever seen. Amazing. This is the 3rd copy I've purchased (I end up giving them away to people I want to bless, but need to always have one for myself!)",1428969600,,193,4.105263157894737
8188949,2,B000P5FIHA,"i LOVE this CD. it's a powerful worship experience every time i listen to it. but this DVD is horrible (again, in pure video quality not in the music quality). the video is extremely choppy and almost makes you dizzy because it flashes from scene to scene so much/fast.

i'm a big fan of worship DVDs as a whole, but this one just isn't worth the money in my opinion.",1357171200,,367,4.242857142857143
8188950,5,B000P5FIHA,This DVD is for all who loves the praise and worship music... the heart of this recording is just lift on high the Name of Jesus!!! the unique style from New Life Worship made from this recording a great resource for all worshipers...,1233878400,,234,4.465116279069767
8188951,5,B000P5FIHA,"This DVD gives so much great music. The recording has lots of movement from one view to another so it is interesting to watch. The music will get you dancing and also bring you to your knees. If you get the DVD, you'll want the CD so you can hear it in your car - it's that good! I hope they come out with more stuff like this!",1189382400,2,327,3.823529411764706
