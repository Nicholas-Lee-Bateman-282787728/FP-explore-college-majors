7902625,5,B000003K9Z,"I thought that this was a great episode, and it did alot to develop the characters of Tom Paris and Neelix.  I was very pleased when Tom stood the test and did what was right instead of simply taking what he desired.  Tom shows us here once and for all that he does have a tremendous amount of integrity...something that was in question at the beginning of the series.
I also thought the alien baby was pretty cute....I don't remember any other ST episodes that used an alien baby in quite this way, and I thought that Berman & Co did an effective job of combining plot lines in this episode.",995328000,,592,4.324324324324325
7902626,5,B000003K9Z,"This is one of my very favorite episodes ever!  It's like one laugh after another.  I quote:  #1
Tom: Can I make a suggestion?
Neelix: Your the commander of this mission, you can make any suggestion you want.  And if you make it an order, I'll even have to obey it.  #2
Tom: Harry, I'm in trouble.
Harry: So what's new?
Tom: I think I'm in love.
Harry:  So what's new?
Tom:  With Kes.
Harry: Kes!  #3(while physically fighting in the mess hall)
Neelix: I'll kill you!
Tom: Too late.  I'm betting your hair pasta already did the trick.
  He he!  You've got to see this episode!",970272000,,576,4.280373831775701
