4172567,5,B003R0MEZ4,"This series gets better and better - love it and can't wait for the next chapter. I think the characters are great but I must admit I would love to see Jason Gideon (Mandy Patinkin) brought back in some way without taking anything away from Joe Mantegna who plays Rossi.
There is one thing that may seem to be trivial - it seems that the packaging and presentation of all the CBS series gets poorer with each series available in DVD format. I include with Criminal Minds all the CSI series and NCIS. They all started with pictures on each disc and far superior box sets. Does anyone else think, like I do, that once hooked one will take the view that anything is better than nothing in order to buy the next chapter?",1314230400,,716,4.350746268656716
4172568,5,B003R0MEZ4,It states only 1 disc and only 42 minutes long for CM season 6. It has to be typos. Love the show.,1312070400,2,98,3.5
4172569,5,B003R0MEZ4,Criminal Minds has been for six seasons a great TV show.  The cast is unique and the writers are still doing a great job.  The changes in the cast on season six were only temporary because on season seven Prentiss and JJ will be back (and agent Seaver fortunately says goodbye).  I'm sure that this is the best crime TV show and I hope it will last for a long long time.,1309046400,6,370,4.111111111111111
4172570,3,B003R0MEZ4,"First of all, I love this show. I've never missed an episode and re-watch all five previous seasons on a regular basis. That being said, season 6 was a bit lackluster. This is due to the major casting changes that took place during the summer. Both AJ Cook and Paget Brewster's contracts were cut, and during season 6 both were written off the show. While the writing in those episodes were top notch, the rest of the season left a bitter taste in your mouth. After episode 2 (appropriately titled JJ), JJ's absense left a gaping hole in the fabric of the BAU. It was almost as if the heart of the show had been ripped away, leaving writers, cast and fans scrambling. Just when we began to settle into the new JJ-less reality, in comes Agent Seaver, played by Rachel Nichols. This was a horrific decision. This is nothing against Ms. Nichols, who did the best she could with what she was given. However, fan response was not positive, as Ms. Nichols bears a striking resemblance to AJ Cook, who we had just lost. Also, the writers and producers truly did Ms Nichols little justice with weak storylines and weaker impact to the team dynamic. Finally, Prentiss' ""death"" was long and drawn out. It was compelling to watch, but it was with a sense of dread, knowing that she, too, was about to leave us. ""Lauren"" (the episode where Prentiss left) was the highlight of the season. It was full of drama, angst and action- a fitting tribute to an actress who had entertained us all for years. Finally, the finale was just simply ""eh"". There was a decent case, but none of the cliffhanger endings that CM is known for. This could be in part that at the time of filming, producers and writers were not sure who would be returning, as Paget Brewster was in negotiations to come back, as was Shemar Moore (Morgan), and Thomas Gibson (Hotch). As of June 22, all three will be returning, as will AJ Cook, who returned briefly in the finale. Here's to hoping that with the cast back intact, Season 7 will be the kind of quality show we have come to expect.",1308700800,114,2042,4.477211796246649
4172571,1,B003R0MEZ4,"I have bought all the Criminal Minds sets up to the sixth season when they started getting rid of all the good people on the show. I refuse to watch the new episodes (or buy the box seasons) and the new people don't even come close to filling in the shoes. Criminal Minds WAS the s%^t but now it sucks. I highly do NOT recommend watching or buying past the 5th season. I know I am not the only one who feels this way. Do a search for: ""Criminal Minds Fanatic Blog"" [...]; everyone is ranting about these horrible changes.",1306281600,11,521,4.22
4172572,5,B003R0MEZ4,"In its sixth season, ""Criminal Minds"" continues to be an outstanding police procedural about the agents of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit.  The show offers intense weekly drama as the agents track various serial killers and kidnappers.

A strength of the show is its superb ensemble cast, featuring Thomas Gibson as team leader Aaron Hotchner, Joe Montegna as veteran Special Agent David Rossi, Paget Brewster as Special Agent Emily Prentiss, Matthew Gray Gubler as Dr. Spencer Reid, Shemar Moore as Special Agent Derek Morgan, A.J. Cook as Special Agent JJ Jareau, and Kirsten Vangness as computer whiz Penelope Garcia.

This season brought cast changes.  JJ Jareau was involutarily reassigned from the BAU at the beginning of the season, then helped out in a mid-season case involving Emily Prentiss.  Her brief appearence in the season finale suggests she will return.  Rachel Nichols joined the cast as young Ashley Seaver, a new agent plucked from the FBI Academy for her specialized personal knowledge of serial killers.  At season's end, a burned-out Penelope Garcia was contemplating a less traumatic career choice.

The highlight of the season may have been the series of episodes involving a man from Emily Prentiss's past.  The charming, vicious arms dealer Ian Doyle, formerly the target of a Interpol undercover operation, stalked Prentiss over three episodes, in the process endangering the rest of the team.  In a shocking climax, Doyle kidnapped and tortured Emily while the team raced to the rescue.  In a stunning conclusion, a fight to the death caused the loss of a team member.  The BAU dealt with that loss in the remaining episodes.

""Criminal Minds: The Sixth Season"" is very highly recommended to its fans.  As of mid-May 2011, ""Criminal Minds"" had been renewed for a seventh season.",1305849600,29,1812,5.139931740614334
4172573,5,B003R0MEZ4,is this the complete season 6? why does it say it only has 1 disc and 42 minutes? Is this an error cause I don't want to order it and then finding out it has only one disc let's hope its an error the amazon people should fix this mistake,1303862400,2,237,3.76

is a production of extreme genius.  I have highly
recomended this program to all friends and family !!!

Can't wait to obtain Season 6 when it becomes available.",1302480000,8,274,4.571428571428571
4172575,4,B003R0MEZ4,"Spoiler Alert: There are casting changes which take place this season which were heavily reported online even before the season began.  If you missed those articles and also do not want to know who is being eliminated then do NOT read this review.

CRIMINAL MINDS had protracted ways of getting rid of cast members this season.  When networks do this, the members leaving are not pulling in enough favorable ratings to make the network offer them lucrative staying options.  So the solution is to then get rid of those members.  Thus two female members of the team were given very plot heavy exits which went on and on over many episodes.  I could have completely done without this and found both stories boring as they were of little to no forensic interest.  It seems that CM knows which characters to keep for the long haul and those are all of the guys and Penelope, the computer whiz gal.  Anyone else who comes in may be there only a short while.  All of these ""exiting cast member episodes"" were barely watchable.  Ironically, if you are a really good looking person, you are almost certain toast for remaining in this show.  These actors who look like movie starlets are the ones being let go, not the ones who might pass as real FBI agents.  So I suppose that at least is refreshing.

The other episodes were business as usual and delivered the same high quality law enforcement and forensic cases we've gotten used to over the past six years.  Perhaps my favorite one was a serial killer with Alzheimer's who has been ""retired"" for many years who comes out of retirement for one last killing spree.  That was a very unique episode.  When the show sticks with the team flying off to go help local law enforcement solve a very complex murder case, the show is first rate.

So I hope this season sees the end of the musical chairs.  There is a British show called MI-5 about UK spies.  Whenever a cast member leaves that show, typically the cast member is just blown up in one episode and that is that.  It is a bit jarring but I will take that approach rather than these protracted leavings.

4172576,5,B003R0MEZ4,"CRIMINAL MINDS grows and grows and this season is an exceptional one. While if continues to bring us smart television, the secondary subplots that continue through this season, plot that focus on the lead actors  and their private lives or personal involvement with some of the created characters takes a major role in this season.  While some may find this a bit disconcerting - as though emphasis on the diagnosis and capture of the criminal minds disconnects the viewer form the point of direction of the story. But at least for this viewer these subplots make us identify more with the agony of coping with the types of criminals these people must deal with every day. The dialogue may at some points seem like a roundtable dissertation on aspects of abnormal psychology, passing from one character actor in the investigative team to the next, but the information they disclose in these sessions is fascinating and makes sense to the viewer. Each segment begins with a significant quote and each ends with one and this seemingly small technique shows respect for the viewer. The cases more often than not are those of serial killers, showing us how these criminal minds are created by their background, what constitutes their behavior, and how examining that studied behavior as each new case develops leads to their capture.

The cast still includes the magnetic Shemar Moore, Paget Brewster, the intense Thomas Gibson, A.J. Cook, Matthew Gray Gubler as the would be nerd but brilliant thinker, Joe Mantegna and Kirsten Vangsnes (often the brains behind the breaks!). What a team - with enough chemistry to keep us all involved over the weeks of each season. And then there are often surprise guest stars as the Unsub (Unknown Subject of an Investigation) to keep us entertained. This is a thinking person's show and a well produced one at that.

4173033,4,B003R0MEZ4,"Compared to the first five seasons, this one is pretty weak.

CONS:
- JJ and Prentiss being written out just so the producers could save money on a spin-off series. A big waste, I must say, for getting rid of two valuable cast members. I definitely felt for Reid when he grieved the loss of the two of them. I haven't seen the spin-off but I have a feeling I wouldn't care for it, seeing that one of my least favorite episodes is ""The Fight"" where they introduced the cast for that particular one.
- Agent Seaver. Replacement for JJ/Prentiss. The problem with her? She's dull as a rock.

PRO:
- Some good episodes like ""The Thirteenth Step,"" ""Coda,"" and especially ""Lauren,"" with JJ returning to help the team once more and Matthew Gray Gubler returning as director!

All in all, this season was a semi-disaster. But on the bright side, JJ will return next season (for good hopefully), and Prentiss would be back too (but not for long sadly).",1443052800,,942,4.529411764705882

I love the cast, the writing and photography.  l love how each episode has a way of drawing you in right from the start. Some of the episodes are graphic and gruesome and I would not recommend watching them with small children or even young pre-teens present. Season 6 is excellent, except that JJ and Prentiss left. I don't know why this decision was made, but it was not a good one, as apparently they came back later. One star less is for the sound quality of the DVD. The background music gets incredibly loud at times, so that I have to work with my sound control all through the episodes, which is annoying.

""25 to Life""/D3/Ep. 3. ""Valhalla""/D5/Ep. 1. ""Lauren""/D5/Ep. 2. Some others would be attractive to me if the violence meant less than the profiling. I could've loved ""Big Sea"" (D6/Ep3), especially for Morgan and his aunt, but for that sadistic fisherman! Readers of this review should bear in mind that the more you like gore & violence, the more you'll like what ""Criminal Minds"" is in the process of becoming. You have that right and so do I.

The plots are always interesting, you learn facts about real serial killers, and the character development has been great.  If you're a new viewer you would get probably 90% of the show.

The one negative about this set is that there are few extras.  You might see one deleted scene per 4-episode disc.  There's almost nothing from the writers or directors.

Despite this I recommend adding this series to your collection.  It's only available on Netflix on disc and it's twice the price on Hulu, so buy it here.",1339545600,,656,4.643478260869565

I even went out and bought a new DVD player, thinking that might be the problem and I wasted several hundred dollars to do that.  I am very dissatisfied and I want a refund.  Also, the DVDs were out of order, so this tells me that the set was NOT new, as promised, but rather, it was used.  I'm very upset by this because I have always been a good customer of Amazon.

4174100,5,B003R0MEZ4,"I've always said that one of the true benefits of DVDs is the chance to see your favorite TV series whenever you want to. Not only that but it gives series a chance to be seen, especially when one series is programmed against another. Series that at one time might have died off because no one watched their second season gain viewers when people see the first season on DVD and realize what they were missing. After 6 seasons that might not be the case with CRIMINAL MINDS, but for those who've never been exposed now is the time with the release of season 6 on DVD. Don't worry if you're starting here, the series is easy to get into.

If you've never seen the series it follows the BAU (Behavioral Analysis Unit), a specialized group of profilers at the FBI that tracks down serial criminals, usually killers. A profiler is a trained agent skilled in the psychology of the criminal mind, a person who attempts to track down the killer by getting in their head. And this team is the best there is.

The BAU is led by agent Aaron Hotchner (Thomas Gibson),  a dedicated individual who guards his team as well as possible. The team also has David Rossi (Joe Mantegna), an ex-agent turned author who came back to join this team. Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore) is the most physical of the team while also the most emotional. Jennifer Jareau (A.J.Cook) is the team's press liaison and case organizer. Emily Prentiss (Paget Brewster) is an effective thinker and effective interrogator. Dr. Spencer Reed (Matthew Gray Gubler) is a young genius with an analytical mind that sees patterns where others can not. And rounding out the team is  Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness), a computer whiz who stays in constant touch with the team where ever they are, finding information for them when in need.

The thing about this team is that not only do they seem like a working group of agents, there is a closeness about them as well. If you continue to watch the series you'll get a sense of family about them. Each one has his role, though not in the sense of father or sister. Instead you get the feeling of familiarity between characters and once hooked on the series with viewers as well. That was seen in this season when one of the characters left and viewer outcry resulted in her return this year.

So you have the set up of the series, agents tracking down criminals, flying here and there ready to take on any and all bad guys. So what happens this season that hasn't before? It opens with the second of two parts, finalizing the cliffhanger from season 5. The Prince of Darkness killer has returned for some unknown reason and takes the life of a policeman before the team can take him out of play. This results in the daughter of the policeman becoming the responsibility of Derek which comes into play in several of the episodes.

As I stated, one of the agents is forced to move up in the FBI though she'd rather not. This results in several situations for the team; having to deal with her departure, trying to take over her responsibilities and eventually finding another member for the team. Again, this takes place over several episodes but contributes to the sense of loss for the team and for viewers.

Various cases offer bloody situations and extreme violence not usually shown on TV. Then again we're talking about serial killers for the most part and their actions are almost always violent. So a word to the wise when choosing who should and shouldn't be watching this show. Adults will have no problem but younger children might.

The acting is unbelievable for having a cast this size. Each member is given equal opportunity to shine and not one stands above the rest. They all form believable characters that long term viewers grow to care about. Should you choose to watch you will too.

The season ends with a twist that few saw coming. Will it result in the loss or return of a character? What actually happened? And will we find out the answer come next season? No one knows except the writers who will let us know at their leisure. Until then we'll have to content ourselves by having the chance to watch this season over and over again, viewing our favorite episodes and enjoying those not quite on our list. It doesn't matter because there isn't an episode that isn't done well.

With the frightening fact that there are at any time dozens if not hundreds of potential serial killers out there, its nice to know that a team like this actually exist. Let's hope for two things. The first, that they're as successful as the team here is. The second, that those killers remain only ""potential"" knowing that the team is out there. This is a series not to be missed and one of the best TV has to offer right now.",1332201600,,4727,4.5625
4174111,5,B003R0MEZ4,"Let's face it ' Criminal Minds ' is one of the best fast paced crime dramas ever to show up on prime time TV. Great acting and believable story lines combine to give an hour of great entertaiment. You might even learn something about law enforcement too.  This episode , part 2 of the story line ends in a much more realistic way than some of the others. We get to 'get into the mind' of the killer, and with this knowlege  he becomes so much more that what we think he is in part one. Although he has committed terrible acts of violence to people, including dismemberment and murder,we are shown that he is also a victim of terrible circumstances. As  we get a glimpse of the ""WHY""  of his actions and not just the ""HOW, we can see that what he had to endure as a child helped to set him on his path ,of becoming a sociopath. Maybe by becoming more aware of our own neighbors, and their circumstances we might all be able to help improve our society as a whole. As the  show points out sometimes all people need is someone to listen and try to help and we could avert a terrible tragedy.",1332201600,,1088,4.186602870813397

4174114,5,B003R0MEZ4,"Criminal Minds just keeps getting better!
Change is not always easy to adapt to especially if the change means losing favorite characters in a series.
And in the past, Ive not adjusted well to the change of cast members.
(Ex: Jag S10 another new lawyer& NCIS when Kate was shot. Even with CM when Gideon left.)
But the writers on CM do a very great job in taking the viewers through the whole process, at least for me it did.

I have all CM S1-6 because:
1) Thomas Gibson fan since D&G
2) great writing, great casting, great cast
3) love the balance of FBI/BAU storylines, humor among the characters & action/suspense

Its nice to know JJ & Emily characters are back in S7.

4174117,3,B003R0MEZ4,"I liked (four stars) all other seasons of Criminal Minds; however, I could only give three stars on this one.  Shows/cases were interesting, but when talking about crime shows (such as CSI, Law&Order, etc...) they are always interesting.  So, question is the storyline and casting.  I believe getting rid of JJ was a mistake.  She brought normalcy and realism to the show.  While other profilers/agents could be replaced (such was the case in NCIS and not to forget Gideon from this show), JJ was different.  And the new girl was useless.  On top of that, I believe JJ was fan favorite.  Also, storyline was weak.  They tried to give each character a story of their own, but failed. Especially, I found Prentiss' sub-story to be ridiculus and uninteresting.  Her story ran through three plus episodes and I fast-forwarded good 25% of her story (I didn't miss anything).  For other characters, their stories were irrelevant and unnoticeable.  However, if you stick to each case per episode, then the show is worth watching, but definitely NOT WORTH Buying.",1327276800,,1055,4.931818181818182

4174142,5,B003R0MEZ4,"With this new and outstanding Season 6 on DVD, Criminal Minds continues to impress with consistently excellent acting, writing, production and an unbelievable variety in its fascinating stories which somehow remain riveting, fresh and unique.  The actors who play the members of the FBI's elite Behavior Analysis Unit who track and catch serial killers and occasional terrorists are very believable.  In fact, part of the attraction is they seem to be a close-knit family of friends.  Anyone who watches a few episodes of the series will begin to feel close to those in the BAU team.

Each episode in any season will stand alone as a gripping story and an outstanding short movie well worth seeing.  Season 6 is no exception, even as JJ (one of our favorites) leaves and new agent-in-training Seaver comes on board.

We discovered Criminal Minds a little over a year ago watching reruns on cable TV and quickly became fans.  We went back and bought Season 1 on DVD and loved it, and have continued through each season, now through Season 6, and we feel this is one superb TV series.

As we went back and started from the beginning, we were surprised to see how much more about each character we learned by watching the shows in order during the course of a season.  Each show reveals a little bit more about the members of the BAU and their personal histories, backgrounds, personalities, and the more one learns, the more familiar and human they become.  One is drawn in and comes to like them, in spite of their flaws and foibles which are also exposed.

After watching the show through 5 complete seasons, and now Season 6, we are amazed that the show continues to be extremely believable, exciting and intriguing.  Somehow, the writers seem to draw from a well of serial killers with an endless supply of singular plots and interesting local venues.  Shows are shot on locations from major U.S. metropolitan areas to gorgeous rural landscapes, from LA to Detroit to D.C. and Miami, to Las Cruces New Mexico and rural Iowa.

The realism of the show is one of the keys to its success.  It can be shocking, and parental caution should be exercised, but it is one reason the show is so believable (along with great writing, production and acting).

One last thing about this series is the way the show looks at some of the hardest questions in life - why do bad things happen to good people?  Is the supernatural real (either supernatural good or evil)?  Are our worst criminals born with genetic coding they are helpless to overcome, or are they shaped by their environment and life circumstances, or do they freely make evil choices? What things are most important in life?  How does one be a good father or mother and still have a demanding professional life, or can that even be done?  How can one ever overcome horrible setbacks in life?

So, the show has a lot of things going for it.  At the end of the day, it is first and foremost extremely enjoyable entertainment that never fails to leave one wanting more.

Five stars are well-deserved for the whole series and for Season 6 alike.",1325462400,,3092,4.6642066420664205

4174287,1,B003R0MEZ4,"(There are -extremely mild- spoilers in this review.)

First off, the casting of season 6 was a fiasco. Dropping two of the strongest women on TV (to fund that terrible spin-off?) was the biggest mistake CBS execs made this year. The addition of of Ashley Seaver (Rachel Nichols) wouldn't have been terrible if the writers had time to give her a more in-depth look at her backstory or even just a personality.

But worse than the execs messing with a winning and beloved cast? The characterization of almost the entire cast is off all season long. The writers take Reid's five seasons worth of growth and regress him to someone even less confident, less socially aware, and generally less able than he was in season 1, which makes no sense at all. Garcia becomes a wilting flower who needs her hand held after every little thing after five seasons of being shown as very capable and strong. Morgan gets portrayed as a big black thug who is only good for kicking down doors (and, alternatively, holding Garcia's hand). Rossi and Hotch have next to no personality and as mentioned, Seaver doesn't either. Prentiss goes back and forth. JJ is the only character who is decently written and she's only in FOUR EPISODES.

Also, character interactions and team ups are lackluster. Hotch and Reid hardly even talk to each other. The writers have spent two seasons forgetting that Morgan and Reid are bros. You'd think that Reid had been pulled from field work with how often he gets relegated to maps and such. And pretty much, the only pair ups we get are Morgan/Prentiss, Rossi/Hotch, and Reid/maps, with Seaver randomly thrown in.

Then you've got the unbelievable storylines/moments that make no sense whatsoever in the context of the show. Like Hotch coaching Jack's soccer team when it's blatantly canon that the man has no time, is always on the road, etc. To add insult to injury, he picks Rossi, who will be out of town on all the same days as he will, to help him? That just defeats the purpose of having an assistant coach. I also can't understand how Garcia has the time to be a tech analyst to not just Hotch's team, but also the spin-off's team, and counsel victims' families AND rehearse for a play in which she has the main role. The Reid headache storyline was completely ridiculous (I've edited the next few sentences to be clearer on what I mean by that). They play it like he's got some BIG and SCARY issue going on (schizophrenia/mental illness, a mystery disease, demons/ghosts weighing him down, etc) when there's a very simple and obvious explanation that no one even mentions - migraines. Anyone who's had a migraine knows that they are triggered by not sleeping well and foods (such as dairy, which is specifically mentioned in an episode when he reaches for Tums because he ate too much dairy) and made worse by stress AND he exhibited all of the ""classic"" migraine symptoms, including auras, which only 20-30% of sufferers get. Reid knows a lot of things and I have a hard time believing that he doesn't know anything about migraines and I have an even harder time believing that his doctor didn't bring them up. Also, apparently Doyle has good enough aim that he can shoot a guy's wrist from a moving van.

And as someone else mentioned, the show has started ""degenerating into cheap shock writing."" The sad thing is they only watched the first two episodes, which are far less violent than later episodes. The Thirteenth Step is the perfect example of how the show has been sliding on the psychological aspects and relying on graphic violence instead. Worse yet, that episode sexualizes the violence, which is against everything the show is about.

Finally the season finale was boring. No cliffhanger, no drama. I get that they didn't know if they'd be able to bring Paget Brewster back and so they didn't quite know how season 7 was going to go, but c'mon. Look at the first five season finales...in three of them, we don't know if one of the teammates is going to die.

Don't get me wrong. I am in love with Criminal Minds, but this season suffered greatly from having the cast jumbled about and good writers fired and replaced with people who just don't understand what made the show successful in the first place.",1316131200,13,4240,4.690860215053763
4174288,2,B003R0MEZ4,"Just watched the second episode of Season 6.  I have been a big fan of the show all through season 5 (own all the dvds) and was looking forward to this season.  What a disappointment to start off with the first two episodes filled with cheap ultra violence against the defenseless to make it more ""entertaining"" but really just a way to avoid the true subtlety and suspense that good writing creates.  It appears its not just some of the actors that are being let go to save money, but writing talent to.  I found it very disappointing and really don't want to have to take the chance of viewing another episode 2 on the chance that they might have made a turn around.",1315526400,,668,4.362903225806452
4174289,5,B003R0MEZ4,"I cannot think of any series that has managed to hold onto my interest and surely millions of other people interest as Criminal Minds has for the last 6 years? Just how the writers continue to come up with the different stories one after the other is a tribute to their capabilities. This series includes the added tensions of Emily Prentice becoming a 'victim' in more ways than one. (actress Paget Brewster and A J Cook were summarily sacked from the series as the Producers thought it was a good idea? Where exactly do they get their brains from??)

New actress Rachel Nicholls was brought in to fill the gap before the Producers realised what a boo-boo they had made and had to eat vast amounts of humble pie and go crawling back to TRY to re-sign Paget Brewster who already had another project lined up as did A J Cook? Also Thomas Gibson was sticking out for more dosh, reasonable in the circumstances as everyone was being treated like something the Producers had stepped-in rather than a hard-working, team of actors that had earned the series Multiple Awards.

Gibson got his dosh, and a new 2 year contract as did AJ Cook and I believe Brewster. Rachel Nichols was for her sins paid off. She was the innocent victim in all of this.
The series itself as far as the storylines, acting, etc was as usual faultlessly brilliant which only goes to show how the old adage of ""if it ain't broke don't mend it"" applies even to this? I only hope the Producers have learned a lesson from their collective stupidity?",1315440000,,1514,4.542124542124542
