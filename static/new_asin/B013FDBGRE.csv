8727527,5,B013FDBGRE,"Of course it isn't perfect but it is well worth the money, and when you have nothing else to watch or want something different or truly noir this fills the bill!  To see Barbara Stanwyck, Kirk Douglas and Van Heflin in a movie that was Oscar nominated in 1946 makes it worth the price alone.  I'm old and never saw this movie on tv!  Now I have!!!  Sure they have Dragnet buy they have Mr and Mrs. North, Bulldog Drummond (alas only one episode) and Richard Diamond (2 episodes), wonderful.  The Adventures of Ellery Queen (1 episode) is just awful but actually funny and shows how far tv and movies have come.  I highly recomment it and think Mill Creek did a great job considering the age of most of the entertainment.",1493078400,,720,4.416666666666667
