2351722,5,B000A2R4X4,"Having attended a couple of Rolando's workshops, I was very pleasantly surprised that I was able to pick up even more new information and techniques from this DVD.  The quality of both the information and production is first-rate.  Rolando's presentation of the subject matter is professional, clear & concise, and relayed in a very informal and personal manner.  I felt like I was actually in attendance at one of his workshops.

  Rolando is an outstanding glamour photographer! He freely shares his techiques, methods, and insight to help you achieve excellent results in your own work.

  I highly recommend ""Glamour Made Simple with Rolando Gomez"", and look forward to his future productions.

8072540,1,B000A2R4X4,"Much like everyone else says, Rolando should focus on instructions, and not just having a conversation filmed.

If you really need/want a good instructor, go with Kelby's photo training. His DVDs are much much better and actually worth the money. You can skip Rolando's stuff unless you're really into his work, but personally, I think Kelby and the photogs he hires for his tutorials are light-years ahead of Gomez.",1334448000,,416,5.028985507246377
8072541,5,B000A2R4X4,"The world is full of excellent photography publications that teach technique but few that teach philosophy. Rolando Gomez, however, has created a masterpiece with his DVD `Glamour Made Simple"" by effectively combining the history, technique as well as the philosophy of glamour photography. Rolando's undeniable artistic passion for creating beautiful images permeates the entire presentation. His clear and simple explanations of his photographic techniques and philosophy truly do make his DVD title ""Glamour Made Simple"" accurate. My portraits now clearly fall into two categories, pre and post Rolando Gomez. In my opinion this DVD is a must for all photographers regardless of their subject matter or level of expertise.",1147478400,,725,5.660550458715596
8072542,1,B000A2R4X4,"If you want to learn from Rolando save your money and attend one of his live workshops.  This DVD set is useless.  As others have pointed out, it's just Rolando talking.  No examples to illustrate waht he's discussing, no video of setting up lights, etc.  The one segment where he actually attempts to illustrate a point with a live model, he ends up standing between the camera and model so you can't see anything.  Boring content, bad production make this one a loser.",1146268800,6,470,4.614457831325301

studied Rolando's techniques...put out a mailing card with some of my results--meaning my new pictures using his techniques...and I'm making more money on weekends than during the week...and about to change and shoot full time.  Thanks Rolando.

8072544,1,B000A2R4X4,"Rolando is a great photographer,I'm sure, but this video doesen't show it. In fact, this video doesen't show anything but Rolando enjoying himself talk. If you delete all the war stories he tells in the video there may be some instruction. I think! I'm proposing that the title be changed to ""Conversation made Simple with Rolando Gomez"". I will sell you mine if you want it at a great bargin!",1131926400,13,393,4.628571428571429
8072545,1,B000A2R4X4,"This DVD comes in a set of two, approximately an hour long for each.  #1 starts off with a head and shoulder shot of Gomez talking, apparently for you cannot see them, to some students.  He drones on offering Glamour Homilies a person could learn for free from any library boasting even a moderate photography section.  Some of his comments are inaccurate.  Sometimes he mumbles and cannot be heard properly.  That is ALL of disk 1.  Surely you think, Disc 2 will actually show HOW some of the Glamour shots are made.  Not so.  He is STILL droning on answering a question here and there coming from the still unseen audience.  Later, you do get glimpses of the ""students"".  Finally, in about the last 10 minutes, you get to see a few models and some students aiming their cameras at them.  There is NO attempt to show lighting, direction, how anything is being done in any way.  I guess Gomez feels that with a DVD cover where a cute model appears to be getting ready to pull her bikini bottom off, is all you need to sell the thing.  Anything inside is irrelevant.",1131580800,10,1065,4.455958549222798
8072546,1,B000A2R4X4,"I bought my copy from Rolando's website but wish I had bought it from Amazon instead so that I could have returned it.

Not only is this THE most boring talking head DVD I ever had the frustration of watching it also has very poor production values overall in my opinion. The sound is so spotty that it's difficult to make out the audio at times. Additionally, there were video difficulties and breakups as well. I literally fell asleep watching this DVD.

I wish I could have given 0 stars instead of the minimum 1 star Amazon has available. Yes, it's that bad. :-(

If you're truly interested in a well-made video on good glamour photography you'd be much better off tracking down and buying a used copy of one of Ken Marcus' videos. He was a long-time Playboy photographer and not only does it show in the end result but the production quality, and more importantly, the *content* is fantastic compared to this one amateurish DVD production by Gomez. Save your money.",1125705600,12,970,4.595375722543353
8072547,2,B000A2R4X4,"A Sleeper!

Photography instruction  is information. Lets convey it in an upbeat way!

This was drudgery. Camera on Rolando,and that was it! Another boring lecture! I Expected to see just a little bit more of Rolando with a model, some interaction, a shoot segment, or something that would want to hold you to the tv.

I've packed mine up to ship it back to Amazon. This is not what I had expected at all. The supplemental disc, from  a shoot, well, that is  bogus! Rolando, plese go back and re-make this entire dvd.

You have information to get out there, but its gonna put everyone to sleep! Comparing your attempt to those dvd's made by WILL CROCKET, his are outstanding, and lively,a nd demonstrations are well planned and executed. I am totaly disappointed in this dvd set.",1125187200,10,779,4.642335766423358
8072548,5,B000A2R4X4,"This is the DVD every photographer needs. I was looking for a clear and complete guide to lighting, posing, and post production and this is it. I had seen Rolando online and was impressed by his down to earth way of dealing with the subject matter. The DVD did not disappoint me.

So much of what you see on photography is way too complicated or too technical. This is the first DVD I have been able to follow from start to finish and learn things I really need to know and can use immediately. After wasting my money on so many books and other videos it is nice to finally get more than I paid for.

Highly recommended.",1120867200,5,620,4.245762711864407
