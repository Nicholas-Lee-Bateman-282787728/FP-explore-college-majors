1821995,2,B00007M5IX,"If I hadn't gotten these DVDs for free, I would have been _really_ disappointed. As a previous reviewer stated, even the ""advanced"" DVD was pretty basic, and the things that are taught don't have a lot of detail - just a few demonstrations. I'd definitely recommend a decent Coerver class over these DVDs.
In addition, all of the ""extras"" on the DVDs are the same on all three. I also got tired of the sappy planted questions from the girl demonstration teams.
If your kid is a Mia Hamm fanatic, and just likes to hear her talk, this is fine, but don't expect a lot of exciting Mia Hamm demonstrations, or a great learning experience/inspiration.",1077235200,3,646,4.626086956521739
1821996,3,B00007M5IX,"I purchased the set for help with coaching a U14 team.  I was somewhat disappointed in the actual technical content of DVDs.  This is definetly for beginner coaches, even the advance tape was on the simplistic side.  I purchased the Coerver and Vogelsinger series prior to buying this collection and those two are hard acts to follow.  If you want some mildly inspirational and simplistic technical instruction buy Soccer Secrets.  But I feel there are much better options out there Coerver/Vogelsinger).  Good for the girls not so good for coaches!",1059264000,14,549,5.044444444444444

7978323,5,B00007M5IX,"As a new to the sport family, we liked the approach of three dvds, one per level. The skills and drills were well thought out and developed as the series progressed. Well worth the money and learning experience.",1308096000,,211,4.578947368421052

7978326,1,B00007M5IX,"If you are looking for a video where the instructors do way more talking than instructing, this video is for you.  Even the young players in the video look bored.  Every so often a ball gets kicked, but there's to much time in-between.  Bad purchase.",1114992000,3,250,4.511111111111111
7978327,1,B00007M5IX,"These instructive DVD's forgot to put in the instruction. Sure Mia and other members of the women team know how to play, but after watching the video's I can honestly say they cant coach. Don't waste your time or money on these DVD's. My 11 year old daughter even thought they were boring.",1083283200,3,289,4.471698113207547
