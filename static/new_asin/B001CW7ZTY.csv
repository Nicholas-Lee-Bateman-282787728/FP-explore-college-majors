8290220,5,B001CW7ZTY,"A fantastic collection of 10 classic, indispensable European movies representing the best work of 10 different directors.  The Criterion Collection has published all but one (Murderous Maids) of these titles, but many of those DVDs are now out-of-print and are available for purchase only at exorbitant prices.  There are no bonus features in this collection, but who cares?  The film's the thing! Unless you already own all of these movies, this box set is a necessary addition to your film library.",1368144000,6,500,5.148148148148148
