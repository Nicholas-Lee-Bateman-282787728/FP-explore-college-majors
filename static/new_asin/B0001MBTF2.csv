8014629,3,B0001MBTF2,"Make Room For Daddy starring Danny Thomas is one of the seminal situation comedies. The superb scripts transcend time and still deliver quality entertainment. This disc from Cascadia Entertainment of Canada features four episodes: Weekend with a Star; Birthday Surprise; Big Nose; and, Loverboy. Picture quality ranges from fair to good with Loverboy being the best episode.

Other companies have released better quality episodes. But, these are not as bad as the other reviewer states or those from Alpha. This disc sometimes appears at $1 stores and is worth a dollar. If you can buy it for less than $2 on Amazon plus shipping, you will not be disappointed if you like old, classic, black-and-white sitcoms.

In spite of the other reviewer's opinion regarding Cascadia, some of their Western film releases are decent and again better than Alpha. I am not defending or endorsing poor quality programs on DVD, but the problem is simple economics for all these companies releasing old, public domain programs. None of the retail outlets pay more for good quality programs and there are too many companies releasing similar product. So, there is little incentive to spend money on quality source prints, wet-gate film transfers and digital restoration. Would you pay $14.95 for four or five episodes of Make Room for Daddy?",1215820800,,1322,5.1157407407407405
8014630,1,B0001MBTF2,"The classic 1952-61 CBS series MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY (later THE DANNY THOMAS SHOW) helped change the art of the American family sitcom and taught us good old-fashioned moral values,unlike today's television shows and launched perhaps one of the greatest TV sitcoms of all time THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW !!! Sadly,I definitely can't say the same for this DVD release,produced by Cascadia Entertainment,which contains several episodes of the classic series that are in the public domain as often with other low-budget releases. But this is perhaps one of the worst-looking and poorly manufactured DVD's I ever bought and thankfully gotten rid of as all of the episodes look very,very much like a poorly made copy off a videocassette release of the same shows as there are appearances of video glitches and sound dropouts ! To make matters worse,the episodes are not complete as they are often missing their original openings and closings which makes it very frustrating to know which episodes are which AND the episode titles that are listed on the cover are NOT the actual episode titles,but so-called ""alternate titles"" to slap onto the disc just to make a quick buck ! What a big rip-off and a group of lazy cheapskates those people are !! I definitely suggest avoiding this and all other Cascadia DVD releases of public domain television classics as there are better companies such as Diamond,Platinum Disc Corporation,and Digiview,which I purchased a very nice collection of this classic series at Wal-Mart for only $.88 !!!,that do an amazing job putting out very good quality DVD releases of public-domain television shows. Danny Thomas doesn't deserve this kind of poor treatment of his shows being tossed around on DVD by such a money-slapping company such as Cascadia !!!",1116633600,4,1774,5.078767123287672
