8333677,5,B001PLIWQC,"Our 5 year old does this little dance video almost daily. I have all the songs memorized, lol! She doesn't have the map or the wand, but that does not slow her down! I think those extras are not needed to enjoy these little dances. This is not an educational video designed to teach ballet, it is an entertaining dance-along for preschoolers and Kindergartners with a Disney princess theme. At the end of it your little princess will not necessarily  know how to Pirouette, lol! But she will be exhausted and giggling.",1459123200,,518,4.630434782608695

8333679,5,B001PLIWQC,"I bought this for my daughters who are 3 and 5 years old. They love the music and the easy dance moves.  Even though we didn't get the wand and the mat, they still have lots of fun, and the music is pretty well done so it doesn't drive me crazy either!  That's important to a stay at home mom... :-)  This is my favorite Bella Dancerella yet.  It's probably a little better for my 5 year old than my 3 year old, since she is more able to imitate the dance moves.",1388707200,3,462,3.935483870967742
8333680,5,B001PLIWQC,My 4 year old loves this! She ask's everyday to dance with this DVD. If your daughter is into ballet and princesses then she will love this!,1387411200,,140,4.222222222222222
8333681,2,B001PLIWQC,"I can see how some children could be smitten with this, which is why I was generous and gave it a 2. My daughter got this as a Christmas Present, so we tried it out.... having a mat with it is ridiculous to say the least, because although there are ""foot prints"" on it, there's never an explanation of how they should be used. It's nice.. they can make believe the foot steps matter, but for the ""older child"", say 5ish, it's noticeable that you are just parading around the mat. And it comes with two of the worthless buggers. I think the mats are intriguing for the kids, but in the end even they get 'bored' with it because there's no structure. Much better ways to get your kids grooving in my opinion. It's kind of cheesy as well, as with many kids things, but I found it to be extra terrible in this department.",1382313600,2,817,4.243589743589744
8333682,1,B001PLIWQC,This toy doesn't 'teach' anything. It has girls just dancing and singing and expects viewers to follow along. The moves change too rapidly without instruction and is hard for a 3 yr old to follow. Probably more for an older child.,1356480000,,230,4.634146341463414
8333683,5,B001PLIWQC,"We had this dvd set but the dvd got broken.  My 2 yr old was heart broken but we found it here.  It is a must have in our house, not only does she know all the dance moves, but she sings along too.  It is great for exercise and usually makes her tired enough for quiet time.  Well worth it!",1235260800,5,290,3.7049180327868854
