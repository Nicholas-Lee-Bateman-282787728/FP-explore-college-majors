927985,5,630473784X,"A very nice break from the ""for the masses"" movies that keep coming from Hollywood. If you appreciate the art of writing and filming, have a healthy sense of humor and can at least except that there are some people that have a darker senses of humor, then you can digest this movie. It's well worth a rental, in my opinion. Caution, a sense of humor is mandatory as well as intelligence to ""get it"".",1257811200,,399,4.333333333333333
927986,5,630473784X,"A classic Quentin style film with ending ecclipsing True Romance.  Diverse character profile.  Advice: don't sell a vacuum to Tilley, look at the mother,and sometimes driving a Caravan may yeild the American dream.",1202169600,2,214,5.454545454545454
927987,4,630473784X,"AMERICAN STRAYS is a disjointed, sometimes frustrating movie, but it is outrageously funny at times, and the cast is superb.  Sure, there are a lot of unanswered questions as to how these guys all end up in the same cafe; why and when did they do their respective crimes, etc., etc., and ultimately, why the suicide storyline is needed at all, since it doesn't tie in with the remaining storylines.  But it has some unusual storylines, and as they all kind of mesh toward the end, we can see writer/director Michael Covert's assessment of violence and how easily it has become such a ""normal"" thing in our society.  Luke Perry is the suicidal young man who hires the Exterminator (Flash Gordon's Sam Jones, still a strong force in this film) to help him commit suicide.  Vaccum cleaner salesman John Savage (in one of his best performances) is scouring the desert looking for ""lonely"" people he can bump off under the pretense of selling his wares.  He meets his match in the seductively flaky Jennifer Tilly (superb) as a lonely woman who bumps off traveling salesmen; James Russo and the late Joe Viterelli play a couple of hitmen who have a cop in their trunk and who argue about Viterelli's family lineage; Carol Kane plays the accented owner of the cafe who has little to do but as always does it well; Scott Plank and Melora Walters are bank robbers who are planning to get married since she is pregnant with his child; Anthony Lee and Vondo Sweet as two ""bruthas"" whose past we don't know a whole lot about, but it is Lee whose assessment of the Star Spangled Banner resonates in the final shootout; and finally, we have Eric Roberts and Toni Kalem as a married couple with two obnoxious children who are obviously moving to a new home since he has somehow lost his job and has no money.  His attempts to feed his family are tragically noble and hilarious when the shootout begins.

AMERICAN STRAYS is not your average movie, but it kept me highly entertained and that's what I look for in any kind of movie.",1112313600,5,2015,4.580555555555556
927988,1,630473784X,"Using elements from several other more popular films, American Strays brings together six different stories with the meeting room being a cafe in the desert. In one story we have Luke Perry as a man who cannot cope with his life and hires an ""Exterminator"" to help him end his existence.  The second story is about two hit men who are driving through the desert. One is cut up really bad and is wearing band-aids, the other is an overweight gentlemen with stomach problems. They really don't have much plot other than they provide the ending with some more bodies.  The third story is about two people who are driving through the desert. They have a moment in their car where you question their friendship. Nothing becomes of this moment, and eventually they make it to the cafe.  The fourth story is about a vacuum salesman. For more than half the film, we follow the path of Dwayne, a salesman who is willing to try any pitch to try to get his vacuum sold. Interestingly played by John Savage, this is the best story of the film. He travels from door to door in the desert demonstrating to potential buyers the effectiveness of his vacuum at a ""killer"" price.  The fifth story is about two lovers on the run from the law. Constantly in some sort of sexual embrace, these two have just robbed something, and are driving around and having sex whenever they want.  The sixth and final story has to do with just a random family. Eric Roberts plays a man who is lost in the desert with his family in a minivan.  All of these stories interweave together when they should all be going in separate directions.

What happened in 1996? This film made no sense at all. I felt like I began the film in the middle of the actual movie. There is no discussion at all, there is not even a hint, as to how all these characters happened to be in the same desert.  All this film is meant to show is violence can happen to anybody.

While other are happy with comedic lines, I actually needed some pre-story to bring this film together. Literally, we jump right into the middle of the robber's story. We have no clue how he got the cash, or how long him and his lady friend have been together. We have no history of Roberts family. No clue what happened to him prior to entering the desert, or where they are headed to. All that we know is that they are as lost as I was in this film. What was the point of the train that Luke Perry kept seeing? Was it to symbolize that his life was about ready to arrive? How did the hit men get the cop in the back of their car, and why were they still carrying it? Who were the gangsta's and what was their part in this film?

QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS, QUESTIONS......I NEED ANSWERS ANSWERS ANSWERS!!!

There were some decent ideas in this film, but without building a story it is hard to develop these ideas. My feeling is that perhaps the director made this film, and found that he only had the budget to release the second half. If that was the case, here is my advise to the director...scrap the project...there is no reason to beat a dead horse. A self-conscious, contrived gallery of oddball characters are simply derived from  parts of David Lynch, and the Coen brothers, with some sub-Tarantinoesque dialogue thrown in.

Unless you, as a viewer, enjoy picking out odd character actors, then I suggest slowly backing away from this film because ""there is nothing to see here folks....""

Grade:  * out of *****",1095811200,3,3431,4.441082802547771
927989,4,630473784X,"I thought this movie was hilarious.  I love the guy w/ the dolls: ""Hey girls, brought you a new little sister.  She's a little different, let's try to get along.""  Of course, offbeat dark humor is my thing.",1077840000,5,206,4.368421052631579
927990,5,630473784X,"I read the reviews on [this site] and was surprised they were mixed. ""American Strays"" is only for offbeat viewers who have experienced the wierd side of life along with David Lynch and Robert Rodriguez. Don't take it serious but as an everyday dry humor flick. The bungling frustration of Eric Roberts and pseudo naievity of Jennifer Tilly make this a GREAT film for those who take life very lightly. I liked it enough to make the purchase.",1043366400,8,441,4.666666666666667
927991,5,630473784X,This is a really terrific movie. It's somewhat of a sleeper having never really gained the respect it deserves. It is a multi layered ultimately 'Good News' story with subtle humour and great acting performances. I think for sure someone should have been nominated for academy award for this 'underground cult classic'. It sure beats the likes of Jerry Maguire and American Beauty.  I enjoyed this movie more than any other. My tastes run to LA Confidential..Pulp Fiction...Red Rock West..Cat Ballou..Clint Eastwood...  Cameron Diaz...so if you enjoy any of those... you'll love American Strays.,1005696000,8,595,5.319148936170213
927992,1,630473784X,"This movie was absolutely pointless. It follows several different people throughout 1 day, and ends up with them all meeting at a diner, and having a shootout.

7877534,5,630473784X,"I've heard that American Strays is one of Tarantino's favorite movies. I can see why. It's a quirky movie, with quirky characters. The vacuum cleaner salesman is my favorite. Without calling a spoiler alert, the scene with him and Jennifer Tilly is a cinematic classic.",1370131200,,269,5.0
7877535,4,630473784X,"American Strays is a strange movie.  You may find it hilarious, vulgar, in poor taste, should not have been produced, but just maybe you will find it as a movie not to be missed and purchaed for your collection.

7877537,1,630473784X,"This movie was so stupid and boring! I wanted to see it because Eric Roberts was on the cover but he was hardly even it. You would think him being on the cover he would be one of the main characters,not so. They just had him on there to lure people with a big name to watch this trash. I don't if I just don't get this movie but all I know I barely sat through it. I recommend this movie only to your enemies as a torture device. Don't waste your time on it!",1305158400,,458,3.831578947368421

Short & sweet, do you like Luke Perry? Do you like Jennifer Tilly? Do you like Eric Roberts? How about John Savage, James Russo & Melora Waters? This may be the best freak desert picture around.

1 diner, 10 people with nothing in common culturally. Add stereotypes plus unique characters & mix with one similarity in personality. What's the vacuum salesman's problem & will the female homeowner solve it for him?

Everybody wants something & some people all want the same thing. You can get it here in the desert.",1265241600,,618,4.651376146788991
