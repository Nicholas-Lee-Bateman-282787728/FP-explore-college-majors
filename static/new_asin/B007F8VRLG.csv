5080491,3,B007F8VRLG,It was not funny. The main character's humor became annoying half-way through. I did gain some wonderful insight and tools for success. I think this movie planted a seed as opposed to changing my life. But in my experience planting a seed is slowly but surely changing my life. They said the same things that I (and maybe you as well) have heard/read in many similar movies and books. But overall it was a decent way to spend 1&1/2 hour of my day. I suggest renting it. I feel like they could've went into detail a little more. But yes I would recommend you renting it.,1379980800,2,569,4.377358490566038
5080492,4,B007F8VRLG,"Definitely worth the watch.  I enjoyed the humor and ""flip"" attitude of the main character.  But some may find this mechanism of telling the story to be distracting.

Worked of me though, providing a good way to communicate the essence of Jack Canfield's splendid ideas and inspirations.",1362268800,2,287,5.0638297872340425
5080493,5,B007F8VRLG,We enjoyed the wise snippets that were shown / discussed with the student. But the student was not particularly funny. His dry humor did not distract from the learning and overall messsage - which was beautiful.,1359849600,,211,4.888888888888889
5080494,5,B007F8VRLG,"I am excited to share with Amazon readers and shoppers that ""The Keeper of the Keys"" has won the Las Vegas Film Festival's competition award for BEST INDEPENDENT FILM! It has also won ""The INDIE Fest"" award for feature documentary. Thanks to everyone who has enjoyed and reviewed this film. My intention in writing and producing it was to empower viewers ... and I see from the comments that viewers are enjoying the movie and are able to take away nuggets of wisdom they can implement immediately to improve their lives. The movie is fun, but it is also very moving. I hope if you love it, you will share it with everyone in your circles. ~ Robin Jay, Writer/Producer, ""The Keeper of the Keys""",1343606400,3,694,4.56
5080495,5,B007F8VRLG,"""The Keeper of the Keys"" is instantly and surprisingly funny but it is also so beautiful in moments it may bring you close to tears. I find when I encounter truth I have an emotional reaction.

This movie is basically a story about a man who loses his girlfriend and his job and appears to be a victim of his circumstances. He is then led to a gorgeous mansion where experts speak to him from mirrors and frames. It is sort of like in the Harry Potter movies where the pictures are alive and people can communicate with the characters. That made this very intriguing and helps to keep your attention so much that you will literally feel a sense of loss when the film ends.

So many great things are said that could change your life. Basically what the experts try to explain is that you have to change your thinking and beliefs in order to become more successful. The experts also explain that everything happens for a reason and that you have the ability to change your reaction to issues you face in your life, therefore changing the outcome.

Some of the keys discussed involve courage, empathy, appreciation, harmony and faith.

I thought that John Gray was brilliant in this film. I really felt his ideas could change your relationship with your significant other.

The only issue I had was with Jack Canfield implying that God and ""The Universe"" were the same. Jack must not have a personal relationship with God. God is far more generous than any ""The Universe"" could ever be. I say this based on my own experiences. Let's give God credit where credit is due. He made everything and can guide your life in amazing ways.

Now if I was to compare this to ""The Secret"" movie I'd say I enjoyed this much more. While it was pretty funny at the beginning and at moments in between I will say that it got a little more serious at the end. ""The Secret"" was a bit more magical and this movie was much more practical. It gives you ideas you can really put into practice. You don't just think of what you want, you think in ways that change your life. There is much more of an emphasis on changing the world. This film is not just about making more money or getting more things it is about changing lives and being a gift to the world.

5080496,5,B007F8VRLG,"I must admit I didn't know what to expect. A funny documentary? Sounds like an oxymoron. But when I popped it into my DVD player, I was pleasantly surprised. For an independent movie lacking a multi-million dollar budget, it was very well done and the special effects were nothing short of amazing. No matter what your age, what stage of life you are in, or what obstacles you have, there was a bit of advice for everyone. The stories were touching and made you realize how everything works out for a reason. And, it was actually funny!  ~ R. K. Avery - Author of Be Careful What You Wish For and Not My Mother's Son",1343260800,,616,4.356521739130435
5080497,5,B007F8VRLG,"The Keeper of the Keys is a funny yet deeply moving movie.  The fifteen experts that are featured alongside Jack Canfield, Marci Shimoff and John Gray, share touching stories about how the seven keys changed their life.  Every person that sees this movie will relate to at least one of the stories.  Very powerful.

Watch this movie, you will NOT be disappointed.",1343088000,,363,4.806451612903226

8515581,4,B007F8VRLG,"Upbeat and inspiring. The lead actor is pretty funny and seems to be riffing a lot. He has good chemistry with the woman who plays the guru (who seemed to be genuinely giggling at him). I'm glad this film cast and focuses on people my age and not kids just out of college. Yes, middle-aged people struggle with love and life too! I'm going through an incubation period and trying to flood my mind with positive information. I will keep this in my toolbox for future viewing.",1481846400,3,474,4.459770114942529

Even though he is horrid to try to get a positive message through- he is really funny. His girlfriend is adorable and I loved her enthusiasm for life. Great stories within this story! Well done! Loved the music too! I suggest families watch this with their teenagers as well as anyone who wants to get centered in their attitude, wants a lift in their life, or just wants a check up from the neck up! Great fun!",1431129600,2,509,4.3125
