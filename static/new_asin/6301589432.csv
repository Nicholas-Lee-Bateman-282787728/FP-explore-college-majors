While it's true this might be a 'b' movie, it was entirely a Kay Kyser vehicle, name above the title and everything. It was a fun WW2 era musicomedy. Kyser was on top and Barrymore washed up. The desired demographic was 18 and under. Many bemoan that THIS was JB's last film, and 'oh how horribly he was treated'. Bull. Barrymore didn't 'know' it was his last movie unless he was psychic, any more than you know when you're going to die. He wanted the money and didn't give a s*it about his reputation at this point. i've heard some interesting stories from the Kyser family about the making of this movie. After the Hamlet scene, when the director yelled 'cut', JB made a crack about his tears tasting like vodka. Perhaps he was 'in the moment' while the camera was rolling, perhaps not. Only JB could tell you. Several really good songs in this-one being 'Humpty Dumpty Heart', sung by Harry Babbitt and Ginny Simms. This was Ginny's last movie with the KK band (she made 3), after which she struck out on her own, to moderate success. My favorite scene is where Ish Kabibble is trying to impress Barrymore by reciting his inane poems. Barrymore's exasperation is priceless. Here's a sample:
Ish- Some fish are short and some fish are tall
  Some fish are fat and some are thin
  They cant walk and they cant talk
  But they can stay underwater longer than anybody!
Barrymore steams and rolls his eyes.
His teaming with Lupe Velez is inspired and worked well. Worth seeing all the way through, 'mr. reviewer'! For more on kay Kyser, go to my page kaykyserdotnet or myspacedotcomslashofficialkaykyser",1210896000,4,1855,4.674846625766871
7813891,3,6301589432,"A run-of-the-mill B&W ""b"" movie of little value... BUT there is a moment shining through that moved me to tears!  I viewed this VHS during a visit with John Barrymore, Jr.  He fast-forwarded to a fleeting instant where his father, John Barrymore,  stopped acting his self-effacing film role and became his onstage Hamlet.  You could actually see him ""trip"" into character and then return to the film image.  Perhaps his last great performance.  John and I wept together.  For me, it's worth watching again and again, not only for the film performance, but also for the fond memory of a departed long-suffering friend.",1105142400,2,617,4.932038834951456
