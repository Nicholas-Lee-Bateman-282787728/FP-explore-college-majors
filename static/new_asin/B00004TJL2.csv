1350621,5,B00004TJL2,"I am NOT a flexible person, so you can call me a beginner. I am 24 years old, but my doctor saw me and said to me that I'm too young to not be able to touch my toes and such. So after reading the reviews I decided to purchase this yoga DVD. I'll be honest, on my first run through of this DVD I was clumsy and confused here and there (he is extremely detailed and gives a ton of instructions for each movement, so you have to pay very close attention or else you'll miss something). By the second run through my moves were smoother because I had a better idea of what to do. And then by my 3rd run I can feel myself growing stronger, especially with push ups. I normally struggle so hard with push ups, but this DVD really helps to strengthen your arms in so many ways that I was able to do it no problem.

I can only imagine how my 10th and 20th and 50th session will go. For those who don't know this DVD is an hour long, so if you're like me and have a very busy schedule I sometimes cut it in half (half hour one day, the other half the next day but that's only for my crazy work schedule).

Overall, Alan Finger is a great yoga instructor who gives detailed instructions and great movements for flexibility. My body usually is sore the next day, but I take that as a good sign that the yoga is working to stretch me out and make me more flexible and strong.",1391385600,,1362,4.0036764705882355
1350622,5,B00004TJL2,this is my favorite yoga workout. i stumbled across the vhs tape 11 years ago. i am so happy to have found the dvd on amazon. it gives me an hour of gentle and peaceful alone time. the meditation sequence at the end provides a perfect finish to the workout.,1373760000,,257,4.16
1350623,5,B00004TJL2,I stress a lot so using this twice a week keeps me from paying the massage lady. I love how he warms you up and gives very specific ways to hold your body to stretch. I get an all-over-body stretch without compromising stability which sometimes leads to injury (according to our physical therapist friend). I follow the lady doing the modified positions but there is an advanced lady showing the harder variation too.,1373328000,,417,4.726027397260274
1350624,5,B00004TJL2,"Alan's voice is so soothing and the end meditation is so wonderful. I love that Alan really explains every pose not only on a physical level but also how each pose affects each chakra. I will be buying the whole series of yoga zone dvds.

They women in the vidoe are real women not barbie look alikes. It is not intimidating and by the end of the dvd you feel stretched and relaxed.",1361923200,,382,4.232876712328767

1350626,5,B00004TJL2,"A very intense yoga workout for me! I couldn't even finish the whole disc since it's intermediate & I haven't done yoga in a while! The instructor is very good at explaining everything step by step- breathing techniques, positioning & etc. Also a great stress reliever! I felt so relaxed after doing this session, although my muscles were sore from not doing yoga in a while.",1353456000,,375,4.696969696969697
1350627,2,B00004TJL2,Suppose this might be a good video for some to try Yoga with but definitely not for beginners and for someone that has a hard time kneeling or sitting Indian style. Not made for bigger people.,1341792000,2,192,4.361111111111111
1350628,4,B00004TJL2,"Even though this was filmed many years ago, the practice is timeless and the video transferred well to DVD format.  Beautiful setting, clear instructions, great sense of humor.  Nice to have each asana demonstrated in a full and also a modified pose.  Great reminders throughout that each body is different each day, so do what you're able this day and let go of the rest.  Really great video.",1320105600,,393,4.735294117647059
1350629,5,B00004TJL2,"I like all the Yoga Zone products- and I have my favorite teacher- Lisa Bennett.  I have a old VHS that Alan Finger does and I did not like that one at all, and really hesitated getting this one. But it is REALLY  good. He has a lot of good poses, and he doesn't have you do them over and over again. I am glad I got it.",1254787200,,320,3.6911764705882355
1350630,5,B00004TJL2,"This is one of the best yoga dvd's I own. Alan Finger has been practicing yoga since he was 13 and is a very good teacher. He focuses on breathing and form, and his prompts come at the appropriate time so you can follow the moves easily. I own several yoga zone dvd's and think they are among the best for real yoga. I'm a beginner at yoga, and I think the beginning and intermediate levels are appropriately named. The poses are moved through slowly and thoroughly, and he encourages you to push but not strain yourself, to work at your level. One assistant performs the poses fully, while another performs them at a limited level for those who are less flexible or have physical problems.",1197331200,,690,4.484126984126984
1350631,5,B00004TJL2,"I enjoy doing this yoga tremendously.  It's perfect for days when I want a real workout but one that's gentle at the same time.  Alan Finger does a wonderful job of integrating the spiritual side of yoga, which often gets left behind in many teachers presentations.  His corpse pose is one of the best I've ever done.",1186444800,,317,4.526315789473684
1350632,5,B00004TJL2,"I purchased several other Yoga Zone DVDs before disccovering those with Alan Finger conducting the practice, and found them excellent.  Alan Finger's sessions, which include meditation, did not disappoint.  Beginners and experienced practitioners alike will find Alan's instruction easy to follow and extremely informative.  One of the ""hazards"" of gaining experience is the tendency to get sloppy in poses.  It never hurts to be reminded -- esp of alignment or proper breathing technique.  At 60 minutes, this practice is just the right length, and again (as in my Power Yoga review) reflects what you would experience in a yoga studio class.  I loved the Chakra meditation -- found it very soothing and inspiring to imagine the different energy centers of the body being energized while I ""let go"" in Corpse Pose.  Alan also includes a bit of OM chanting at the end, something not inlcuded on the other Yoga Zone DVDs I've tried.  Admittedly, this type of meditation may not be for everyone.  But after practicing for about a year, I've noticed that I'm  the most ""in the zone"" after a practice that incorporates all of these elements.  Try it yourself and see what you think!",1174867200,5,1178,4.959183673469388
1350633,5,B00004TJL2,I really enjoyed this DVD; I liked the teacher's voice and yoga directions as well as comments on the effects of yoga on the body and health.  Especially liked the ending savasana/meditation sequence.,1174262400,,200,5.0606060606060606
1350634,5,B00004TJL2,"I have never owned a yoga tape in the past.  I mainly do total body weight training and cardio on alternating days.  I got this tape through a trade mostly because everyone says you ""should"" do yoga.  I have done yoga-type classes before at the gym, but not on a regular basis.

When I first got this tape about a month ago, I previewed it and was not overly impressed with Alan Finger.  I thought he talked a little too much and didn't like the that he wasn't actually doing most of the exercises on the tape.  So I put it away and didn't use it.

I finally pulled it out last night.  I didn't have a lot of energy for cycling, but I didn't want to do nothing, so I decided to do this one albeit begrudgingly.  Boy, what an attitude adjustment I had.  The poses were relaxing but very thorough.  I have a long ways to go in terms of flexibility, but I can see how using this tape regularly would really be beneficial.  I absolutely LOVED the ending.  I was totally spaced out.  I remember feeling thoroughly relaxed after certain yoga classes at the gym, but this was great...totally zoning out in the privacy of your own home without a care in the world.  Next time I will shut off the lights before this relaxing ending.

This one is a keeper for sure and I may even do it once per week from now on!",1171324800,6,1302,4.189516129032258
1350635,5,B00004TJL2,I have used this yoga workout for years and find it one of the best.  Alan Finger does a great job of explaining and encouraging along the way.  It designed for strength building as well as flexibility and stress relief. You work up a sweat as well as letting go of tension. When I use it at night it puts me right to sleep.,1162857600,6,324,4.046875
1350636,5,B00004TJL2,"I've been practicing yoga for 3 years and once a week go to a yoga class with an excellent instructor.  These Yoga Zone DVD's are the very next best thing to a live teacher.  The instructions are very explicit, the pacing is excellent, the variety of poses work all body parts and the final meditational pose is really relaxing and enjoyable.  I would recomment all the beginning and this intermediate DVD to anyone.",1143244800,10,416,4.671232876712328
1350637,5,B00004TJL2,"I recommend this DVD to anyone interested in learning yoga. I started learning yoga with Yoga Zone on TV six months ago. I have tried other yoga programs, but for me, Alan Finger and the yoga zone instructors are the best. The demonstrations by the presenters are excellent as is the verbal instruction, done by Alan. One person demonstrates the more advanced variation of the poses and another demonstrates the easier modified version for less experienced practitioners. This is an intermediate class and lasts about an hour. The class ends with a Chakra meditation. Any Yoga Zone program is a worth while investment, in my opinion. Good Luck with your yoga practice.",1142294400,6,668,4.973214285714286
1350638,5,B00004TJL2,"This video is not power yoga. In fact, it is the polar opposite.

If you want to focus on the purpose of asanas, this video is the answer. In my opinion, this video is what yoga is all about. I am sore after this video every time I use it, and I am in fairly good shape, both in yoga and aerobically. It moves slowly through each posture, and you discover the meaning of the poses, both physically and mentally. I have been practicing yoga for four years. I still consider myself a beginner, because there is so much yet to learn!

People who have a hard time slowing down long enough to investigate yoga asanas and then meditate afterward will find this video torturous. Go back to your ""Crunch Yoga""! But I think Alan Finger is a wonderful guide, his remarks throughout each pose keep me aligned and balanced, and in the end completely relaxed and refreshed.",1140220800,13,860,4.436708860759493
1350639,5,B00004TJL2,"Ive been doing yoga for 1 1/2 yrs almost everyday via dvd videos.  I've had this one most of that time and still have not tired of it.  It's an hour workout, and I almost never go all the way through it.  I love the first 3/4, last part is too slow for me.  I prefer to do a workout everyday and need to shorten them a bit in order to have time to do that.

It's challenging enough for intermediates but novices shouldn't be afraid to purchase this one.  I would not make this your 1st workout ever.

Yogazone seems to make quality videos from my experience.",1139356800,7,558,4.111111111111111
1350640,5,B00004TJL2,"Searching for a routine that is challenging, total body, good for all skill levels, and relieves stress? This is it! This is the best Yoga DVD that I own. The relaxation session at the end is your reward for finishing the practice. This workout could be used everyday and I love the soothing voice of Alan finger. I highly recommend this DVD and plan to wear it out.",1126569600,8,366,4.397058823529412
1350650,1,B00004TJL2,"A painful workout- not because of the exercizes, but because of the narration.  Despite being labeled an intermediate workout, the first part of the video is for the absolute novice in yoga.  This video seems geared for someone who is unfamiliar with yoga- the instructor takes time to define the ""sit bones"", breathing through the nose and vinyasa.  The poses do not flow well.  The instructor gives a great deal of verbal instruction with each of the poses being described in painstaking detail instead of simply using the name of the pose.  For example, after describing Down Dog the first time, he would continue to describe this pose each time instead of just saying the name.  One good thing about the incessant talking of the instructor is that you do not notice the cheesy music in the background.  He also does a prolonged relaxation where he encourages you to visualize colored lights with each of the chakras. This is the first Yoga Zone video I have tried, and probably the last.  If you are new to yoga, I recommend any of the Crunch videos, and any of the beginning Gaiam videos.  For intermediate yoga workouts, I recommend Bryan Kest's Power Yoga series or any of the intermediate Gaiam videos.",1118620800,8,1210,4.751196172248804
1350651,4,B00004TJL2,"This is a great yoga DVD for the beginner who is looking to move up to intermediate and for anyone whose goal is flexibility and stress release (as the title of the DVD states). The moves present enough of a challenge that I feel like I've done something when I'm through, yet are arranged in such a way that the final goal, stress release, is very much achieved.  Alan Finger talks through the entire program but that is the format I prefer since it helps me stay constantly aware of my form.  His voice is pleasant enough and  his comments appropriate to what is taking place.",1115683200,2,578,4.433962264150943
1350652,2,B00004TJL2,"I borrowed this from the library hoping I would love it enough to purchase it after reading the other reviews here.  I'm glad, after veiwing it, that I didn't buy it first.

As a beginner, I do need instruction on proper breathing, posture, etc.. but I found this program involved too much instruction!  I kept thinking, ""Ok, I get it.  Now be quiet so I can concentrate!""",1097193600,13,372,4.507462686567164
1350653,4,B00004TJL2,"Flexibility & Stress Release is a nice, full-hour yoga practice aimed at releasing tension from the muscles and fostering relaxation.  It is lead by master Yoga Zone instructor Alan Finger.  Alan is assisted by two female yoga instructors, one of whom is his wife, Greta, and the other of whom always displays modifications.  Alan himself demonstrates only some of the poses, as most of the time, he focuses on talking and teaching.

The practice begins with breathing instruction in a seated position and moves on to hands and knees for a cat stretch series.  There is a brief vinyasa (flowing poses with breath) which requires quite a bit of arm strength and is fairly challenging.  You will also perform down dog and then move to standing.  At this point, you will do a warrior series, moving through several poses on each side, and then Alan leads you through three slowly-flowing sun salutation series, the third of which includes extended lunges.  You will then practice some balancing postures, including eagle and a challenging arm balance, raven (aka crane or crow).

Next, the workout continues on the floor with an extended stretch in child pose.  You will also perform seated forward bends, simple back bends (locust and bow), reclined twists, and scale posture (aka boat pose).  The practice ends with a really nice, lengthy (10+ minutes) relaxation pose; to deepen your relaxation in this posture, Alan leads a guided meditation focusing on color and energy centers in the body.  At the end of the practice, I felt completely stretched and refreshed.

I enjoyed this routine and felt that it provided a nice combination of challenge and relaxation.  I have been practicing yoga for several years and am at an intermediate level; I would not recommend this video for beginners, and it might not be enough of a challenge for more advanced yogis.  Overall, a very solid yoga practice.",1092873600,59,1895,4.9525316455696204
1350654,5,B00004TJL2,"I spent the last few months reviewing yoga video tapes from friends and the library, hoping to find 'the one.'  Well, this is it!  From Bryan Kest to Chakra Yoga, Rodney Yee to assorted other Yoga Zone tapes, I have to say that the combination of Alan Finger's well-thought out practice, the variety of poses, the beautiful locale and the absolutely relaxing end of tape have pushed 'Flexibility and Stress Release' to the top of my list.
As a beginner, there was one pose I was unable to do (I believe the 'Raven' pose), but most of the poses are do-able, some quite challenging.  I liked the medium speed of the workout -- he doesn't shift too suddenly from one pose to the next, nor does any pose grow tiresome.
The women in the tape are both instructors in their own right, and one is his wife.  They both do a great job at demonstrating the poses, both in advanced and modified positions, and neither is distracting from the focus of the practice.
Again, the relaxation portion of the tape is outstanding, utilizing some creative chakra mental imagery. After this workout, I feel so content, flexible and relaxed.  I think the tape clearly achieves its title's goal...",1076457600,25,1173,4.647342995169082
1350655,3,B00004TJL2,"Of all the Yoga Zone DVD's that I own, this has to be the worst.  I like a video where there isn't a lot of talking.  Alan Finger does not stop talking throughout the entire video.  As well, some of the postures were too basic.  Since it's a DVD, you can choose to skip parts and make your own workout, which is a good thing because the beginning of the video is enough to turn anyone off.
If you can get past Alan Finger talking all the time, some of the poses are actually challenging.  He spends a lot of time on inverted postures, which I find are the most difficult.  While it's not a favorite, I'll still keep it in my collection.. for now.",1071619200,12,646,4.128
1350656,5,B00004TJL2,"This tape by Yoga Zone is really perfection.
I've been doing Yoga daily for about 7 years and now have close to 70 videos (and study with an amazing teacher) and I really loved this program.
 Though I have about 10 Yoga Zone tapes in my collection, this is the first one that features Alan Finger as an instructor that I have practiced with. He is a really special teacher. His instructions are crystal clear and he exudes a real open and friendly presence that comes thru the tape. There is a wonderful and open realness that he radiates along with his genuine love of yoga.
This particular program is a longer tape than the other shorter Yoga Zone tapes that I have. This program is about an hour or so long compared to the others which contain 2-20 minute programs (which are also quite excellent and easy to fit in for those who have schedule constraints).
It's paced beautifully, never rushed and you really have a chance to explore the postures and breath.
While I found this tape to be mostly on the gentle side, it certainly has some challenging poses (such as Raven (aka Crow), Twisted prayer side angle pose and a series of not too intense Sun Salutations (the last one though is pretty tough where you have a lunge with your arms over your head). Of course, you can always modify poses to accomodate either your level or experience or energy (The modifications are demonstrated by one of the teachers on the tape). In fact, you can even modify the Sun Salutations by using the Sivananda plank (in which you come down to knees, then chest, then head) rather than lowering straight down. This variation opens up your body without putting tremendous strain on your arms.
There is a long guided relaxation at the end with focus on the different chakras and the tape finishes in a seated position (first with a gentle crossed legged forward bend which is a wonderful way to adjust into sitting).
This is a very thorough practice that I will certainly use to alternate with more intense practices (check out the Yoga Zone ""Power Yoga for Strength and Endurance"" if you want to get a very challenging practice, also an hour or so long and it's pretty intense).
I highly recommend this program (and as someone else had mentioned in one of the previous reviews of this program) I will certainly be getting more programs with Alan Finger as the main instructor, he is exceptionally knowledgeable, clear and even has a subtle sense of humor which I found very refreshing:)
Namaste --This text refers to the DVD edition",1069286400,22,2518,4.633109619686801
1350657,5,B00004TJL2,"Ok, I admit it. I didn't think i' like this video as well as I do! I've got many yoga video, but I never owned one with Alan Finger instructing. I have other Yoga Zone videos with Lisa and Charles and the other guy whose name escapes me at the moment. I like them all, but this vieo with Alan is superb!! His instruction is like no other. No lie, he put my daughter, dog, and cat to sleep at the end with the relaxation. He is very calming. Because of this video I am buying other YZ video that have him instructing right now!!",1063497600,4,527,4.0285714285714285
1350658,4,B00004TJL2,"I didn't think I'd like Alan Finger because he seems so odd, but I think he's actually a really good instructor--leading you through the poses very clearly and well, and offering a good philosphy for practice.  The only thing about this DVD is that it's one workout only, so you don't feel like you're getting much value for your money.  That being said, everytime I do this workout, I'm suprised how much I enjoy it.  It's a good supplementary DVD, but you'll definitely need more just for variety's sake.",1061769600,,506,4.662921348314606
1350659,5,B00004TJL2,"Alan Finger is a true Yoga Master and this workout is perhaps one of the best yoga workouts out there for flexibility and stress release. Alan takes you from tense shoulders and emotional stress to a state where you literally feel like you are floating in total bliss.

The workout is outside in a beautiful natural location. Alan acts more like an instructor, focusing on the specifics while you really focus on what he is saying. I did eventually put a mirror in a location so I could see the TV while I was upside down. I laugh, but when you are looking down and your TV is way up on the wall, it can be difficult to follow along with a workout. Once you have done this workout a few times, you can put the mirror away, close your eyes and just listen to the instruction. Which is excellent and the best I've ever found in a yoga workout.

Even when Alan is not actually doing the exercises, his wife and another instructor are showing you all the variations and advanced moves. There are two VERY advanced moves on this video that I would not recommend even to intermediate students of yoga. You will need a lot of strength in your arms to balance in two of the exercises.

The first time you watch this video, you might not be able to do the exercises to their completion. Fear not. Do the video at least three times and you will be amazed at how fast you progress. Moving table was difficult at first, but by the third time, I could actually almost do this move.

If you are looking for strength, flexibility and relaxation, this workout will completely calm your nervous system and clear your mind. There is an interesting ""chakra moment"" at the end while you are flat on your back. You visualize colors and move relaxation from your toes to the top of your head. It was very interesting and healing.

You really do many of the yoga postures you are already familiar with, but with this video, the instruction is so superior, you move into new levels of stretching and flexibility. Even while doing downward-facing dog, I learned new ways to do the posture more correctly. There are some interesting sequences I'd never tried before.

The movements are well organized, fluid and move in perfect timing from one to the other. When you want to rest, you rest, when you feel you want to be challenged, you are challenged. The breathing instruction is also excellent and as your body flows with the breath, you literally feel empowered.

Upon completion of this video, you might feel freedom from emotional turmoil, have no discernable desires you can recognize, feel happy and want to do this video again!

This is a true Yoga escape! It does everything yoga is supposed to do. For days afterwards I felt focused, creative and happy for no reason. I handled emotional conflicts much more effectively and while I let other things go in my life so I could do this workout, it was so worth the utter feeling of peace I felt at the end.

In my TOP TEN of Yoga workouts.

I look forward to trying the four workout set called Yoga Zone Premiere Collection and anything by Yoga Zone or Alan Finger. His voice is so calming and he has a cute accent. He also has a great sense of humor and even made me laugh a few times.

If you are looking for additional self-esteem information that actually has encouraged me to exercise more: Caroline Myss Self-Esteem: Your Fundamental Power has been very helpful.

1350669,3,B00004TJL2,I bought this video looking for a relaxing/stretching routine.  I found it more challenging than I would expect for a relaxation sequence and the tape seemed to focuss more on the scenery and philosophy than actual practice.

1350674,5,B00004TJL2,"""Yoga Zone: Flexibility and Stress Relief"" was the first yoga DVD I ever purchased and I liked it so much that I decided to purchase 5 or 6 others. Much to my dismay, none of the others, even those by Yoga Zone, are as good.
Alan Finger, the founder of Yoga Zone, is very explicit in his descriptions of each of the different postures. His commentary on each is enriched by his wisdom and years of practice. Yoga is an ancient eastern philosophy, designed to enhance the health of body, mind and spirit as a whole, through the development of single-minded concentration on the individual asanas, or postures, accompanied by correct breathing. I found that none of the other instructional DVDs conveyed these principles as well as Alan Finger.
""Yoga Zone: Flexibility and Stress Relief"" will provide the serious student hours, days and months of satisfying yoga practice that will result in increased physical strength and flexibility, mental clarity and spiritual awakening. I will be first in line to buy future DVDs by Alan Finger.",1034035200,17,1033,4.908571428571428

you will feel that the muscels all over body became stronger and you feel better and is in a better mood.",1000771200,5,269,4.09433962264151
1350677,3,B00004TJL2,"I hesitate to say anything vaguely critical of Yoga Zone material,  but.....this tape seems less complete than their others. On the plus side,  the relaxation segment at the end is excellent, and the poses are well  described. There are some strong poses, but it's not a strength  workout--good for days when you're not quite up to a power yoga session. I  recommend their Condioning and Stress Release (the best I've ever seen)  over this one, especially to those new to yoga. I'll probably use this  occasionally for variety.",965260800,3,527,4.920454545454546
7922676,4,B00004TJL2,"This is from 2000, but it still feels fresh.  I'm a fan of the Yoga Zone productions, and they are one of my ""go to"" home yoga practices when I want to move, but I'm not for high energy exercising.

This is filed outside, somewhere in the Caribbean, I think, and it is really pleasant.

The music is a soft instrumental and pleasant.

It's taught by Alan Finger, who has a South African accent, I think.  I find his voice soothing, and his instruction is excellent.  He's one of the founders of Yoga Works, and teachers I've had through that program have always been excellent with their cuing for alignment, as he is.

Two women demonstrate the poses, with one showing modifications.

The pace is slow, making it great for a beginner or someone wanting a light day. Poses are held, and Alan says to use the breath.

The most challenging pose is crow, and I was surprised that it was in this practice since it's not something most beginners can do.

Yes, there are a ton of yoga DVDs and videos out there. However, if you are a beginner, or someone seeking a gentle yoga practice, I highly recommend this Yoga Zone practice - Flexibility and Stress Release.",1471219200,,1157,4.492822966507177

Most people can probably do this much better than me, I happen to be very physically inflexible, so it is extremely challenging.

For someone new to yoga and not knowing the correct way to hold postures, this DVD is perfect.
