8499265,2,B006J6CE12,"In his early days before the advent of Full Moon Features, Charles Band was responsible for distributing countless cult-classics to the home audience through video cassette. With the help of the legendary Forrest J. Ackerman and Horror host Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, Band now presents all of the most gruesome scenes from THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE, THE DRILLER KILLER, THE ASTRO-ZOMBIES, BLOOD FEAST, 2000 MANIACS, CARNIVAL OF BLOOD, SNUFF, DRIVE IN MASSACRE, DR. JECKYLL'S DUNGEON OF DEATH, and FIEND back-to-back in a killer compilation of blood-soaked cinema. Gore fans, rejoice, as FILMGORE features two straight hours of hacked-off limbs, disembowelment, drilling, killing, and much, much more! Anyone who may be looking to this as a historical reference with critical insight into the genre that H.G. Lewis helped to spawn will be sorely disappointed, however. This is just a lazily edited clip show taken from poor transfers to showcase Wizard's entertainment library. Elvira only pops in occasionally to drop a few bad puns with her signature brand of humor. One would be hard-pressed to find more gore in a single sitting however, and if nothing else, FILMGORE trims all of the fat from films like BLOOD FEAST to deliver non-stop murder and mayhem!
