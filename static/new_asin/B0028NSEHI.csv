8356470,4,B0028NSEHI,"These informational films covered quite a few topics. I especially liked the film on counterfeit gas ration coupons and one on the labor shortage in Dayton, Ohio. While there was a lot of patriotism for America during the war there were also a lot of individuals who didn't believed rationing should have to apply to THEM and so there was a black market for gas coupons. It's interesting to see the measures taken to identify counterfeit coupons and how it was REALLY bad business for gas stations to take them. The film on Dayton is especially of interest if you are from that part of the country... the committee formed to address labor needs included several well-known personalities of the times.

Overall, well worth watching if you are into this period of history.",1303344000,7,770,4.7894736842105265
