8548718,4,B00A99BGYQ,World Cycling Productions does an excellent job of covering the Tour (as always).  The digital quality is excellent.  This dvd set is perfect for those who missed the Tour on OLN or need something for all the time on the trainer in the winter.  I think the coverage is just a bit better than the 2001 Tour.  You'll love it!,1044576000,6,323,4.333333333333333
