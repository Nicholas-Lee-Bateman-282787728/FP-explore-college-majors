Responded to my question immediately and shipped my item just as fast!  It's always a breath of fresh air to come across sellers like this :)  I was also very pleased with the dvd! It was exactly what I was looking for.  My husband and I are taking our son to an upcoming circus.  He has autism and does much better with things like this when he knows what to expect.  This dvd consists of live footage of the circus experience and was perfect!  My son loves this dvd and would watch it on repeat all day long if I let him. Lol  He's also now in love with elephants ;)",1428019200,,707,4.303030303030303

I don't usually post reviews but wanted to tell other parents about this great combination of action-packed video photography and story-telling in videos that keep my kids' attention and make me feel good knowing they're learning so much that they're already curious about. Great stuff.",1304985600,,421,4.702702702702703
