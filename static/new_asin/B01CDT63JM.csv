7673470,5,B01CDT63JM,"Dr. Kildare: The Complete Fifth Season is a 7-Disc DVD set containing all 58 episodes of the shows final season. If this seems like a lot of episodes for one season, its because the show was no longer a once-weekly one-hour drama but a twice-weekly half-hour series with storylines stretched over multiple installments. It is also the first season the show was broadcast in color.

The season opener, Behold the Great Man, stars James Mason as Dr. Becker, an arrogant physician who becomes vindictive when Kildare (Richard Chamberlain) openly disagrees with him. The Bell in the Schoolhouse Tolls for Thee begins a six-episode story in which Kildare takes on a teaching assignment to three difficult third-year medical students. The Life Machine is about a potentially life-saving new treatment at Blair General available only for a limited number of people; Kildare and Gillespie must choose from dozens of possible patients.  Other episodes focus on the diagnosis of a mysterious disease, a doctor deciding whether to give up his practice in the slums for a well-paying specialty, and a patients change in outlook on life after a near-brush with death.

Guest stars in Season 5 included Dean Stockwell, Cloris Leachman, Fred Astaire, Audrey Totter, Kim Hunter, Darren McGavin, Basil Rathbone, James Earl Jones, Ricardo Montalban, Martin Balsam, William Shatner, John Saxon, and George Kennedy.

Dr. Kildare, which came to TV after having been a successful series of movies in the 1940s, focused on a young intern in a large metropolitan hospital trying to learn his profession, deal with the problems of the patients, and win the respect of the senior Dr. Gillespie (Raymond Massey), Kildares mentor and father figure. By Season 3, Kildare was promoted to resident.

The series offered a realistic portrayal of hospital life and the life-and-death reality of the work. The show premiered on NBC on September 28, 1961. Its last episode aired on August 30, 1966.",1460419200,7,1962,5.1572327044025155
8752681,5,B01CDT63JM,"Dr. Kildare is my all-time favorite medical tv series.  I have wonderful memories of watching it with my family Thursday nights on NBC.  The only season that I was not so enthused about was its last season, season 5, when they turned it from an hour weekly series to two half-hour episodes per week.  Supposedly this was due to the popularity of prime time soap operas like Peyton Place.
I had bought and watched the previous 4 seasons on DVD and I loved them.  I was curious how I would enjoy season 5 however.  I shouldn't have worried as I am enjoying season 5 as much as the previous four seasons.
The stories run for as little as two episodes to as high as six.  Most of them have been thoroughly engrossing.  Like so many other shows I have purchased from the 1960s, the guest stars are quite amazing, many of whom really did not do much tv.  Some of the great guest stars here include James Mason, Fred Astaire, Basil Rathbone, Jack Hawkins, James Earl Jones and others.
The stars, Richard Chamberlain and Raymond Massey, are still great.  They are joined this final season by an actress named Lee Kurty as nurse Zoe Lawton.  Apparently she joined the cast as a potential love interest for Kildare, although for most of the episodes they appear to be just friends.  She is very good and is a welcome addition.
Finally, the show is now broadcast in color.  When I originally watched it, we only had a black and white tv so it is nice to see the series in color.  I have always preferred the color of the shows broadcast during this period to the color today, it was richer and more enjoyable to look at and this series is no exception.  The picture quality of these discs is great.
As stated, Kildare is my favorite doctor show and watching these episodes on DVD just reinforces that decision.",1490659200,,1799,4.461773700305811

8752683,5,B01CDT63JM,"I was sad at the end of Season 5.  I wanted more!  What happened to Nurse Zoe?  Was Dr. Kildare made chief resident?  As with all other seasons, this was top notch.  Creative ways of dealing with topics that make the viewer think.  As a RN, it was doubly enjoyable.",1485043200,,265,4.2

8752688,4,B01CDT63JM,"This final season is serialized and watching the episodes becomes rather addictive...a la ""Peyton Place"". Stories are quite good...and format does work well. Color episodes are a bit grainy and washed at times...but undoubtedly these are the best masters available and this is certainly the official studio release so we'll never get better!  Overall...recommended for fans of the series.",1468022400,,388,5.576271186440678
