So, what's the holdup? Never mind, I don't care. Just make the box set, for crying out loud.",1159228800,75,258,4.285714285714286

1557208,5,B00005JOXU,Why has this show never been released.  It was a great show with great actors.  The story lines were so good.  Not like everyday stuff.  More like what I think it would really be like in the court room setting.  Please Please Please release this series.  I loved it so much.,1391299200,,274,4.2745098039215685
1557209,1,B00005JOXU,"Be very careful if trying to buy any or all episodes of Judging Amy. It is one of my favorite series but several years ago I ordered the complete set from a company in Canada, like but NOT Amazon, and paid $100.00 for the complete set. I did receive the set in CD form. The only problem was, the CD's had been purchased blank and recorded, very poorly, from someone's TV, which of course we could all do ourselves if done while the series was actually on the air. They even included the commercials and the CD's were flawed and it hopped, skipped and jumped throughout. Evidently the creators of the series have not yet released it. I'm not sure why, and the question is who is holding things up. I contacted the Canadian Company (I think just a go-between) and they gave me instructions to send the set back for a full refund. I did send it back and that was the end of that. No refund. Hard lesson learned, research, research. Funny that most new series, the seasons are out on DVD almost before the show actually airs. I hope this info is helpful and no-one else has had the same experience.",1389052800,20,1094,4.367647058823529
1557210,5,B00005JOXU,"I too, have been watching Judging Amy on GMC and have been enjoying it again and again. But they are not showing ALL episodes. I found a site that sells the entire set for about $50.00 but.......it is taped from TNT, edited with no commercials, not great quality, but you get to enjoy the shows. However, the DVD's are flawed. Some episodes did not tape correctly, some episodes ""stick"" and a few episodes were repeated and some episodes left out. I purchased the set, watched every DVD but I sent it back because I want all the episodes and about 5 episodes are flawed. There is another site where you can purchase the set and I think it is still from TNT but it is a different company. I haven't tried it yet because it is more expensive and you have to pay $15.00 shipping because it comes from Europe and if I choose to buy it, then I am dissappointed, it will cost me another $15 to send it back. So I will be out $30.00. I am not ready to do that. So.......I wait.
I have read the reason why there are no DVD's has to do with the music in each episode. Probably something about copyrite or royalties. Not sure, but I did read it was about music.",1384387200,7,1151,4.212669683257919

1557213,5,B00005JOXU,This show is wonderful! I don't know why it's not on DVD yet (almost everything else is). GMC is showing all the episodes BUT they edit some of the episodes that are less than family (GOD) friendly and sometimes they skip certain episodes so it's not as complete as I'd like. I guess it will have to do.,1350518400,5,303,4.241379310344827
1557214,5,B00005JOXU,"There are so many god-awful shows out there that seem to go to dvd immediately that you have to wonder why this wonderful show is still not available after so much time has passed.  The storylines, the writing, the incredible, perfectly cast actors (including one of my all time favorites, the incomparable Miss Tyne Daly)--it is great to at least be able to watch it on GMC network, but I must thank the other fans who commented on the fact that the channel, for whatever reason, is completely skipping over crucial episodes and that really does damage to the continuity of the show.  It is nice to know that I'm not losing my mind after all!  That said--please, PLEASE release this show on dvd",1348617600,6,695,4.588709677419355

I watch it with alternating smiles and tears.
I have been trying to buy the complete series in DVD that is for Norway (Europe)
but have not been able to do that.
Why is it not in stock at the moment and when do you suppose we can buy it.
At any rate I need to say that very few series have been so interesting for me and my friends.

Bought a bootleg version of the whole ""set""- BIG, BIG mistake. I foolishly thought it was a legitimate set of the show and half of the homemade discs would not play- the others were bad recordings with the TNT logo on the screen! I hope no one else goes through that situation. Judging Amy was one of the very best, feel good, down to earth, put a smile on your face shows ever produced! I hope someone with some say so reads all these posts and does something about it. It's great to hear all the wonderful comments about this wholesome show and to know people appreciate it instead of all the other crap out there they mass produce on ""tv on dvd"".

The show should never have been cancelled, but the most recent mistake belongs to TNT for taking it off of the air. Amy & Maxine were the last two redeeming female characters on television.  TNT lost perspective when it decided to replace strong, smart women with the vapid sex symbols on Las Vegas, the show that replaced Judging Amy on TNT afternoons.

1557428,5,B00005JOXU,"The company responsible for producing Judging Amy should pay attention to what viewers want to purchase.  Although I have grown tired of waiting, I will continue to search for this series on DVD.  I LOVE THIS SHOW!  IT IS FANTASTIC!  The entire cast was perfect and interacted in the most believable way.

 Like many others, I was extremely disappointed when the series was cancelled.  There are few shows that are available for intelligent people, with values, who need a great escape from the stresses of world news and the daily grind of life.  This program compells the viewer to feel an affection and empathy for the characters, especially the family.  PLEASE MAKE THE SET AVAILABLE!  IT WILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE CORPORATION THAT SELLS IT.  That, alone, should be an irresistable incentive.

The cast wanted the show to continue. There are many new viewers from the re-runs on TNT.  Why not add a few more seasons?  At least, make the series available on DVDs.",1178064000,41,973,4.748502994011976

1557432,4,B00005JOXU,"I totally agree with many of the reviews I've read. This was one hellava series and deserves a quality DVD release. It clicks on all cylinders writing, dialog, acting, pathos, humor ... But my specific attarction is that although like most TV & Movies these days, it leans to the left of the political spectrum. It is far more balanced. Certainly the newer TV series and motion pictures take every oportunity to bash the right, and sometimes deservidly so. Shows like Boston Legal, and ER make no bones about where their loyalties lie, but at least Boston Legal does it for laughs... But with others, it's gotten to the point of propaganda while demonizing the right by only portaying the extreme view points, verse the left is always portrayed as thoughtful, compassionate, and condisendingly SUPERIOR. Anyone honestly paying attention, knows both sides have their fair share of sinners and saints. Another show that deserves release for much the same resons, Picket Fences is among the missing. It also did a fair job of showing both sides without painting extremes. True, Picket Fences fell apart toward the end, but the first few seasons were quite well done, with all the atributes noted for the JA series.

1557553,5,B00005JOXU,I think Judging Amy was (is) one of the finest TV shows of our time.  I was truly disappointed to see it cancelled.  The characters were so real and down to earth and the storylines were heartwarming and believable. The actors were terrific as well.  This is the type of show where you can easily become acquainted with the characters and feel as if you actually have a bond with them even after just a few episodes.  A show where you can laugh and cry at the same time.  I saw every episode thanks to TNT and was not disappointed in any of them.  I don't understand why this quality show has not been brought to DVD.  I see so many other shows not nearly as good on DVD out on the store shelves and just can't figure it out. I'd love to know who the fans could contact to get this out on DVD.  I would buy the entire box set in a hearbeat!!,1172188800,69,841,4.054545454545455

  I wish I knew what the problem was with it not being released on DVD in a boxed set. There are so many frivoulous shows out there available,this one is truly meaningful and heart warming.

7941513,5,B00005JOXU,"MY family absolutely LOVED the show ""Judging Amy"" is is still one of the best shows on TV.  The acting was excellent and the story lines well handled and relevant today.  I would so like to purchase these.  To whoever is holding this up please, please make this show available for purchase.  This was quality TV at it's best.  We now have 300+ channels and nothing to watch but crazy role models (NOT) of ridiculous people turning over tables, doing despicable things to one another.  Don't think for a minute that TV  and what people see doesn't influence their mind and behavior.  Why not release something positive?  A show that might make even one person better for having watched it?",1396224000,15,688,4.666666666666667
7941514,5,B00005JOXU,"I would preorder and purchase this entire set if it ever became available....and I cannot figure out why it hasn't been!  This is a great show and noone has ever told the viewing public why it won't be released. The last time something like this was withheld, it was Three's Company supposedly because Suzanne Sommers was causing chaos and so they ""punished"" her by not releasing the sale of tapes/dvds for a certain LONG period of time.  I did read somewhere that Tyne Daly was allegedly causing issues and that is why this hasn't been released, but there was nothing else to prove that.  I am tired of waiting for it!  I hope the people at Amazon are able to look into this and somehow figure out how to get the series on dvd format for us!  It would be wonderful to buy have!  :)",1395705600,6,782,4.358620689655172
