8147946,3,B000IZJR3I,"For curiosity purpose only !!! If you want to watch a Bollywood movie from the 60's with an opening dance scene that will stick to your mind forever, go for it ! Otherwise, don't expect it to be the find of your life. The image is so damaged that you get a snowstorm from the begining to the end. You can even see that the film had broken and was glued back together with Scotch Tape 3M !!! ha! ha! ha!, but hey, it never was mentioned nowhere that Eros Entertainment had made a restoration of this film of any kind. And why no backcover image?, because there is simply nothing to show!, all you can read is the synopsis just as described here on the product description, that's it!
The only point that makes this version preferable is that you don't get a stupid logo on top left as Ultra released, and the colors are maybe a little bit less washed out. I won't say not to buy it, but if you do, don't spend too much money on it, buy the cheapest priced item, you'll get the same fun at the end!",1428105600,,996,4.139175257731959

8147948,5,B000IZJR3I,"If you've only seen the Ultra version of this movie do yourself a favor and buy the Eros Entertainment release. The colors, the sound, everything is so much better, especially the interior shots. Some of the Ultra versions are blurry and the colors are washed-out. Also, every Ultra version I've seen runs faster than the original. It isn't cut, you get the entire movie, but it is shorter (by about 6 minutes) because it runs faster than the Eros version. Worst of all the Ultra logo appears constantly in the frame (which is the only thing that's really colorful).

I ordered my copy from flixflow and it was exactly as described. There are some really beautiful scenes in this movie but you'd never know it if all you've seen is the Ultra product. Get the Eros version - you won't regret it.

some highlights -

Nanda (Sharda) and Manoj Kumar (Mohammed Rafi) in the rain performing ""Jaane Chaman Shola Badan""
the wet leaves and forest floor, Nanda in green, Manoj wears a red shirt, lust and desire, love and romance. this number is worth the price of this dvd imho.

Helen ""Is Duniya Mein Jeena Ho To Sunlo Meri Baat"" - Helen on the beach

Nanda and Helen drunkenly performing ""Peeke Hum Tum Jo""

Laxmi and the dancers doing ""Jaan Pehechan Ho"" - nothing like it on film anywhere

no subs for the songs but they're easy to find online. the movie is based on an agatha christie novel ""And Then There Were None"" - suspense and spookiness on a deserted island. the story wrings out all the suspense that's possible and the twist at the end is a good one. in between are all these great songs. highly recommended if you like Hindi films.",1356393600,,1636,4.52542372881356
8147949,1,B000IZJR3I,"I was sent the Ultra edition, and not the Eros, as was described.  The Ultra is a very poor print, with washed-out color, and missing minutes.  Even worse, the Ultra logo keeps appearing on the film, that is, on television screen, while trying to watch it.  Maddening. Unfortunately, I removed the packaging and inspected the DVD too long after delivery for a return.  The buying page said that the DVD was manufactured on demand.  If this was true, it was manufactured from a different source than described.",1353628800,2,509,4.804597701149425
8147950,5,B000IZJR3I,This is a must have for any Bollywood film collector. The soundtrack alone is worth the investment. The film is also very interesting and should bring a smile to most anyones face.,1320105600,,180,4.65625
8147951,4,B000IZJR3I,"Odd Movie. Need the English Subtitles to follow it. Kind of a 60's Musical, Murder Mansion Mystery. With India themes and actors. Some say it is a cult classic. Some say it represents the best of India Cinema (Bollywood). I can't say I would have even looked this up if it wasn't for the opening Dance-musical number that was made famous in the opening of the movie Ghost World. This movie has the complete original version of that fun, catchy Dance Tune, that is also recently used in the latest Hienikin Beer Commercial. This is a very unusual movie, not for all tastes, and the majority of the tunes are India 60's style Romance and Pop type tunes. Kinda whiney, as they go. But, boy oh boy, that great Opening Dance Tune alone will be worth the cost of the DVD. I'm sure you'll play it again many times.",1318118400,4,807,4.422818791946309
8147952,2,B000IZJR3I,"Gumnaam (Raja Nawathe, 1965)

One wag, reviewing this film for IMDB, called it ""the Plan 9 of India"", and I can't say he's terribly far off in that. While it was obviously meant as a mystery/thriller (IMDB also reports the script was based on Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians, which would bring new latitude to the definition of the term ""loose""), watching it forty-five years later, Gumnaam has all the hallmarks of a classic unintentional comedy. This would have been great fodder for MST3K. (Note to self: get ahold of the Cinematic Titanic team....)

Plot: at the beginning of the movie, we see a man murdered. The guy who seems to be behind it contacts a series of people by phone before being murdered himself. Cut to the Princess Club, a dance joint where we get the first of those oddly inappropriate musical numbers germane to Bollywood flicks. The dance is great, and if you're a Bones fan, the lead dancer could pass for Michaela Conlin's mom. (That alone might be reason enough for you to catch this. Mrow!) Afterwards, the MC gets up and announces the winners of a lucky draw, who will be sent on an all-expenses-paid vacation to... well, we're never told where. Not that it matters; after a spat of ""engine trouble"" (we see the pilot obviously fiddling with the controls), they all land on an island somewhere in the Indian Ocean (I think, may have been the South Pacific). Everyone gets out to stretch their legs, including the co-pilot, Anand (Manoj Kumar, already a superstar by 1965; he played the title role in Shaheed earlier that year). Once everyone's clear, the pilot suddenly takes off, leaving his hapless charges on what seems to be an abandoned island. Among them is Asha (Prem Rog's Nanda), the niece of the murdered man from the opening scene, whom mastermind-guy had called to offer his condolences (and gloat?) just before being shot. We also have a lawyer named Rakesh (Bobby's Pran, who gets the Best Beard in Bollywood award); a doctor, Acharaya (Pyaar ka Saagar's Madan Puri); a party girl, Miss Kitty (Bombay 405 Miles' Helen--the only member of this cast to still have a career, appearing in the upcoming Dunno y na Jaane Kyun..., which opens October 22, 2010); Dharamdas, who may have another job but passes his time on the island indulging in his passion for fishing (Brahmachari's Dhumal); Madhusudan (Benazir's Tarun Bose), who... um, I never quite caught what he did; and Kishan (Kathputli's Man Mohan), an alcoholic who's got a thing for Miss Kitty. The party eventually stumble upon a large mansion in the middle of a jungle, where they're greeted by a Hitler-hairstyle-wearing butler (Dev Anand in Goa's Mehmood) who tells them he's been expecting their arrival...

It's a lot of characters to throw at you in rapid succession, and one of the movie's greatest successes is that you get to know who's who pretty quickly, and they all have distinct personalities that shine through rather than being a muddle of interchangeable serial killer fodder. On the flip side of this is the plot, which is outlandish from the beginning, but truly begins to fall apart about forty-five minutes before the end of the movie, and really comes unglued during the climax. There's a certain type of ending to a mystery that is, to be blunt, a complete cheat, and this one utilizes it. And then there are the oddly inappropriate musical numbers; while they're not as oddly out of place here as they are in, say, Rain: The Terror Within (nothing like a musical number during an attempted rape!), it doesn't matter how awesome the scenery and how warm the rain, breaking into a song about frustrated love just doesn't seem right when you've discovered a dead body, you know? Still, despite its serious shortcomings (and I rush to add the bulk of the movie's rating comes from that very, very severe plot defect mentioned above), there's a lot to like about this flick. It's very easy on the eyes, the dialogue is witty, the butler is the intentional part of the hilarity (and does his job well every time he's onscreen), and if you're a smoker, you'll wax nostalgic for the days when everyone pulled out cigars and pipes at the dinner table. Oh, and the peer pressure in this movie is great (while, again, nothing as outrageous as in Rain, some of the interplay between Kitty [""I like alcoholics, but I don't like alcohol!""] and Kishan [""Just drink this one little one... for me...""] could easily be construed as coercive; the easily-triggered should take note).

In short: if you're a bad movie connoisseur, this is must viewing. Others, take or leave at will. * ",1287532800,4,4592,4.78562421185372
