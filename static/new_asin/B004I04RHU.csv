8429784,5,B004I04RHU,"I bought this DVD because I thought it would be good and I was not disappointed.  I have a collection of historic air race videos and it was good to watch them and to see Jimmy Doolittle, Roscoe Turner etc. flying the cutting edge racers in the ""Golden Age of Air Racing"" in the 1930s.  I fly in SARL cross country air races and I was on Bob Mills pit crew at Reno in 2012.  This is real!  It is so thorough, so personal and so well done it is like you are there witnessing the development of the sport class racer ""Nemesis NXT.""  I have done a lot of drag reduction on the airplane my wife Jeanine and I built to increase the speed so I know the ideas, the implementation details, the experiment failures and successes and the emotions are authentic.  It is amazing to me how the creator of the full movie length video was able capture the very real events and put them together in such a way that is as entertaining for anyone as it is for avid air racers.  The technical risks of Jon Sharp and his wife Tricia to create this super fast Reno Sport class airplane from scratch are beyond comprehension.  Jon dominated the Formula 1 class for years with his smaller, lower powered, fixed landing gear and slower airplane ""Nemisis"" but the ""Nemesis NXT"" is different.  It is bigger, more powerful, has retractable landing gear, is much more complex and is a totally unrelated clean sheet of paper design for a relatively new race class that is around 100 miles per hour faster than what he flew before.  There is a lot of agony in the development process and the emotions and support are real life natural with a very classy team - especially Jon and Tricia.  It is both painful and inspirational to watch.  No one could act the part of Jon Sharp and capture the feeling that he himself communicates.  I have watched it many times and I have bought several copies for friends - yes it is that good!

I am a Reno Air Race fan, have been going to the races for over 25 years.  If you like air racing, Formula 1 class, and the Nemisis of John Sharp, this video gives a bit of the history on the beginning of Nemisis NXT.  Good story, shows that even the ""best"" don't always get everything right the first time, or the second<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Air-Racer-Chasing-the-Dream/dp/B004I04RHU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Air Racer: Chasing the Dream</a>.",1311120000,,553,5.974683544303797
