8459165,1,B00563TR82,"Unbelievably idiotic and racist. The entire premise of this movie and movement stems from the ignorance that all Muslims are extremists. These people are the exact reason there is hate and tension between American and Middle Eastern countries. You're fighting a misinformed and uneducated war. This was a waste of time, but a great laugh.",1443484800,,338,5.163636363636364
8459166,5,B00563TR82,"The truth hurts, which is why you see the 5 star truthful ratings opposed by the Islamic apologists reviews.  The Islamists could have named their proposed mosque the ""Peace, Love and Kumbaya Brotherhood Center"".  Instead, they tried to name it after territory lost in Europe after their failed occupation of Spain. Guess why?",1382659200,34,326,5.132075471698113
8459167,1,B00563TR82,"This is another steamy one to add to the massive pile of nonsense and fear mongering that has been put forth regarding 9/11.  There has been so much misinformation surrounding the ""ground zero Mosque""... starting with the fact that the location wasn't at ground zero.

There are definitely a bunch of Muslims in other countries that I don't trust and have good reason to be fearful of, but all of the Muslims here in America that I have met are good, honest, and hard-working.  This type of crap is divisive and attempts to make a quick buck by playing up the fears of the ignorant.

If you are reading this, don't buy in to loony propaganda,",1381795200,7,642,4.508620689655173
8459168,5,B00563TR82,"I must say this was an eye-opening documentary. Far from building bridges, this victory mosque, consistent with Islamic fundamentalism, burns every last one of them. But remember, this is for YOUR betterment. I cannot believe the insensitivity of muslims on this critical and touchy issue. This film deepened my insight on the subject matter and I now better see the motivations of Muslims for doing so: Historically, they always build a victory mosque on top of conquered lands and territories.",1353110400,42,495,5.2
8459169,5,B00563TR82,"As a 9/11 survivor who had to run for my life on 9/11, I have a different perspective. This was not in fact the first time I had to run for my life from muslim terrorists. The first time was on a Friday evening on my way to prayers at the Wailing Wall in the 1960's when a bomb was deliberately detonated with the purpose of killing as many Jews as possible. I also know the history of muslim attacks on the non-muslim infidels. You need to do some historical checking as to why they originally called it The Cordoba Center. You need to further study who the Muslim Brotherhood are. Contrary to what obama's director of the Office of National Intelligence James Clapper told a House Intelligence Committee hearing in February 2011, that the muslim brotherhood is ""largely secular"", that was simply a lie. The muslim brotherhood worked with the nazis in their goal to annihilate the Jews. Their cited goal is to create a global islamic, radical caliphate, forcing sharia on the world, destroying the US from within. You think this should be ignored? Do so at your own peril.",1313625600,95,1073,4.59375
8459170,1,B00563TR82,"This is ridiculous paranoid nonsense.  Anyone who promotes division, as the authors of this nonsense do, is responsible for conflict, war, and the killing of human beings.  They are just frightened, unconscious people unaware of their own fear and how it distorts their minds.",1311552000,12,276,5.25
