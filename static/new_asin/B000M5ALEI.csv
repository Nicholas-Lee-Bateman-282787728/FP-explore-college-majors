8166400,1,B000M5ALEI,"This book is excellent for Honors or AP English classes.  The commentaries are very informative.  I was actually looking for a DVD that simply told the story so that average students would clearly understand the story.  I provided literary comments like theme for my students so they really did not need the othere commentaries.  They did not have the patients to listen to the comments; however, I found them very helpful.",1171843200,,423,4.915492957746479
