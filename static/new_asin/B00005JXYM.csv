The best is the second episode, in which Ranma, Ryoga, and Mousse get a possible cure for their curses.  It is so funny!  They're constantly worried about what they could turn into if they get the wrong cure, and some of the ideas they have are off the wall.  The funniest scene is when Kasumi imagines what it would be like if everyone was a panda.  I couldn't stop laughing at that!",1072483200,,501,4.344086021505376
7942548,4,B00005JXYM,"It is nice to finally see the TV series appearing on DVD. The movies and OAV's have been out for a while on DVD and now Viz is putting out Random Rhapsody (the sixth season) on disc as well.  There is not a lot of extras on this DVD nor is the transfer quality all that high (this is why I gave it a 4 instead of 5)but the durability of DVD and the quality of the episodes themselves still recommend this. Episode 1--Dear Daddy Love Kodachi This epsiode finally gets rid of easily the most annoying Ranma character, Principal Kuno. His leaving plus a litttle Kodachi and Tatewaki (always funny characters) make for an above average episode. Episode 2--Enter Gosunkugi This episode introduces Gosunkugi, an annoying but funny loser who is obsessed with Akane and who wants to remove Ranma. He is going to be in many more episodes so this is a good one to see. Episode 3--Ranma's Calligraphy Challenge Mostly a useless episode with another weird character with another wierd martial art style to challenge Ranma. Weakest of the three",994377600,4,1031,4.633879781420765

Principal Kuno wants him off the grounds, but this is one feisty merchant that won't go without a fight. Then, Ranma, Ryoga, and Mousse travel into the mountains in search of the legendary Spring of Drowned Man in an attempt to restore their original forms. Will the three martial artists be successful, or will paranoia tear them apart? Plus, what is Genma thinking when he names Ryoga as the inheritor of the Anything Goes School of Martial Arts!?",992476800,,541,4.705263157894737
