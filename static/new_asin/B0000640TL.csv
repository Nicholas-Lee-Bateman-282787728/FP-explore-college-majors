7960248,5,B0000640TL,"Excellent Period documentaries. The Road Racers will appeal to anyone who is,or who has been,a club level
road racer,no matter what their period or time was. It was very real for the grass roots 1970's,even more so
being in Ireland/Western Europe,as the race culture is so markedly different in all those everyday details of
life ""over there"".If you have had road race experience in your blood,then watch this-you won't be disappointed.
VFour Victory is the Honda GB film,taking the viewer into the 1980's,On board camera and the running of the
additional commentary is wonderful-you feel like you are in the seat. Highly recommended for any hard core
motorcycle race history fan.",1426032000,,680,5.135135135135135
7960249,4,B0000640TL,A good watch. I particularly liked the film he made with the camera strapped to the bike as he went round the Isle of Man Course. Brought back very pleasant memories.,1289088000,,166,4.387096774193548
7960250,5,B0000640TL,I love this DVD its fantastic. It shows you what what road racing is all about and the sacrifices these incredible sportsmen go through in order to race. Even though its older footage if you like road racing you won't be disappointed.,1274659200,,234,4.595238095238095
