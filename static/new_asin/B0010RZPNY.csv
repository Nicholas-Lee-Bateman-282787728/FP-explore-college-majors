8238235,1,B0010RZPNY,"I rated 1 star but would rate zero if I could.  This is a completely amatuer production with a weird ""plot"" and the most wooden dialogue imaginable.  It looks and sounds like it was made by a bunch of third graders except many third graders would do better.

""PLOT"": Supposedly thirteen year old kid (looks at least fifteen) for unclear reasons won't stand up to bully.  For this reasons his ""friends"" talk to him about every three seconds but won't ""hang out"" with him - who knows why.  He finally (for no discernable reason) punches the bully and is immediately kissed by the girl of his dreams and now gets to ""hang out"".

His grandmother (who he lives with) has no bingo partner one day so kid goes with her to bingo (yeah, that would happen in real life).  Kid wins $700 bingo pot.  Kid, whose hero is Donald Trump, plans to invest $700 and become Donald Trump II.

Grandmother is grandmother to kid and older brother or perhaps to the entire neighborhood of boys of various ages who appear out of nowhere and live who knows where.

Three fourths into the film and time suddenly flips to years later.  Kid has now somehow parlayed $700 into a multi-million fortune that enables him to donate his current office building to charity and build a multi-story office building and open offices in Iraq (who knows why).  Problem here is that current office looks like the lobby of a cheap motel.  Kids ""business partners"" are same kids he used to hang out with and none have apparently matured even a year.

""ACTING"": The most wooden I have ever seen.  Everyone sounds like he/she is doing a bad job of reading this very bad script.

I bought this piece of junk directly from Amazon - no the Amazon marketplace.  Amazon should be truly ashamed to offer anything this bad.",1199836800,5,1769,4.5474683544303796
