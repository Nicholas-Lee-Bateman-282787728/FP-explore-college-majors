8316182,5,B001KVVPBQ,Love the series wish it would've lasted another season,1497139200,,54,5.111111111111111
8316183,5,B001KVVPBQ,This is the dvd that shows how it all began.  Includes a cameo by David Hasselhoff.  I definitely recommend this if you want the new series to make sense.,1479427200,,154,4.275862068965517
8316184,5,B001KVVPBQ,Loved reminiscing.,1456185600,,18,8.5
8316185,2,B001KVVPBQ,"If you watch this for the Car, you'll be disappointed as Kitt doesn't do much in the later episodes. The transforming abilities are cool, but if you are a fan of turbo boost , forget it. Unlike the hasselhoff series, Kitt can go many episodes without the boost, and the boost themselves are horrible underbelly shots, not side shots. Worst of all, it was just plain boring. Regardless of kitt's  abilities, I couldn't force myself to watch to glean out the cool special effects. I'm glad I didn't buy it, but rented it.",1438560000,,519,4.580645161290323
8316186,5,B001KVVPBQ,I love the movie! I just hate that it was so expensive - not sure why it is so hard to find and get a decent cost. Oh well I have my copy now.,1394409600,,142,3.2058823529411766
8316187,4,B001KVVPBQ,Thank you for sending this. I'm a fan of Knight Rider. I really like KITT because he has his own personality and is very skillful,1364169600,3,129,4.2
8316188,4,B001KVVPBQ,"I was glad to see one of my favorite shows from the 80's return to the small screen with a new look for the younger generation. I grew up watching Knight Rider and the way the show ended left me with a feeling we as the fans got robbed. With the new Knight Rider movie(which was better than the one back in the late 80's; Knight Rider 2000) it seemed to put the final touches on the orginal show. Of course, by now David Hasselhoff was to old (but very wise) to continue with the newly foundation as Micheal Knight so he had a love child son(Which could have happened for anyone who remembers what a player he was) who eventually seem to take over for the father he never really knew. Of course with the new K.I.T.T. being a mustang (which back in the day I had two of those) made it more cool to watch. Watching the movie made me feel like a kid all over again.",1335312000,7,862,4.106508875739645
8316189,5,B001KVVPBQ,"i watched the entire series when it was on, to bad they cut it short. the dvd is pretty good especially when david hasselloff made a apperence to boost the ratings up.",1328832000,3,167,4.25
8316190,4,B001KVVPBQ,"Having found and watched Knight Rider (2009) TV show for free online, I was happy to buy the movie that started it only wishing for more than one season of the show. The movie was worth it and I am glad I got it. I like this KITT show better than the original,
Alex",1304380800,2,265,3.925925925925926
8316191,5,B001KVVPBQ,I was skeptical about this DVD considering I loved the original Knight Rider series! But this one is so very worth it! Too bad they only did 1 season of this one but this one is a must for your collection! I loved the Mustang too!,1261180800,7,230,4.021739130434782
