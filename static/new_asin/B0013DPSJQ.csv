8250364,5,B0013DPSJQ,"It's not very often that one can get hold of a 45 minute documentary (without ads) about the development of the U.S.Army's Armored Warfare from just after World War-I to the end of World War-II. This documentary does it and does it well.  It follows the development of modern tanks with emphasis on the Light M3 Stuart (a light tank used primarily for recon), the M4 Sherman (a 'Medium' tank that is the main focus of the story) and finally the T-26 Pershing (America's first 'Heavy' tank, heavily armored and armed with a 90mm gun that could easily defeat the German Panther and Tiger-1 tanks). This documentary also focuses on the great price that tank crews paid during World War-2. When a tank's armor is penetrated by enemy armor-piercing shells, and the tank's ammunition stars to 'cook off' or 'brew up', the odds of crew survival drops horrendously.
  This documentary features interviews with veteran Stuart, Sherman and Pershing tank crewmen, an accurate but brief history of the U.S. Army's tanks and it's development of the 'combined arms doctrine' during the push across Europe. There is also some color film footage. The music soundtrack is in stereo. This is a great documentary to have on your shelf. Even tankers of today would appreciate the historical value of this dramatic documentary. A big thumbs up!",1349308800,,1323,4.923766816143497
