8513481,5,B007ANCSFA,"This short documentary is great because blackness and African heritage is valued and sets the standard for what is beautiful which is not typical in a country that valorizes white standards of beauty and plastic surgery. It's warming to see black women love themselves, their roots, and offer less commonly presented criteria for what nationally defines beauty. It inspires young girls of color in Brazil to embrace their own beauty, not stereotypical,artificial,sexualized images.",1361059200,,481,5.602739726027397
8513482,5,B007ANCSFA,"The film ""Ebony Goddess: Queen of Il Aiy"" is a new look at the black women's universe in Bahia state. Instead of the usual party-like images of women, objectified by the foreigner's point-of-view (foreigner here being the ones outside their lives), this film shows beautiful women proud of their own skin, comfortable in their own skin, with a strenght and a beauty rarely portrayed by filmmakers. Carolina Liu has a clear feminine approach in this film and that allied to her sensitivity was able to translate their rich and deep lives, the contradictions, the unusual.
""Ebony Goddess"" is a true story, but not only that: it is true to the real story of these women. In addition, I believe this film should be shown in every venue possible during the Black History Month, to show a different angle of a black woman's life.",1329868800,,823,4.7622377622377625
