3965839,5,B000035Z3U,"What more could you ask for in a dvd collection.....humor and love with Ed TV, action and drama with apollo 13, and nonstop action with Backdraft.  Ed TV makes me laugh all the time, and there is a love story inter-twined  within it.  I don't care what anyone says either....it is totally different  than ""The Truman Show"" and just as good, if not better.  Apollo 13 is one of my favorite movies ever, and all the extra features on  the dvd make it well worth the money for the movie just for all the history  and stuff of the space mission.  Backdraft is just a great action  movie, i don't want to talk to much about it, cuz i don't wanna give the  movie away or anything, but no one can not like a movie that is filled with  fire and burning and pyro-technics.  All-in-all, this dvd collection is  one of the best and Ron Howard has a gift, and it is shown best in this  collection of dvd's!",962064000,7,894,4.21301775147929

3965849,5,B000035Z3U,"I hadn't seen any of these movies before. I am reading a book called ""101 Movies to See before you Grow Up."" All three of these are on the list. For less than it would cost to rent them on Amazon digital streaming, I now own all three.

Apollo 13: Tom Hanks is amazing in this epic drama that a is a step back in time and a dramatic depiction of a bygone era.

Field of Dreams: If you build it, he will come. I went to college one town over from shoeless Joe's hometown. I felt this movie moved kind of slow at first, but then it picks up about 30 minutes in. Great film.

Seabiscuit: I grew up a horse oriented small town in SC. This movie was all the rage when it came out. I went to see it, but it was sold out at the small town theater. And I see why. This movie was also an excellent period piece. You won't believe the ending, Tobey Maquire is outstanding.

Great deal for three great movies!",1463443200,2,898,4.0
