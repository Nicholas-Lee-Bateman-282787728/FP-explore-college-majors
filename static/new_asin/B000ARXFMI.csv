2390874,5,B000ARXFMI,"This very interesting DVD is unfortunately a bit dated.  From the details given about the Royal Tournament it seems to be from about 1995.  Nonetheless, there is some interesting behend the scenes perspective about Tattoo production here.  The video is UK centered, as it does not cover emerging tattoos in North America or elsewhere.  Major Parker and Col. Ian Fraser of the Royal Tournament provide some interesting tidbits about how this world famous show was produced.  Sadly the last run was just a few years later in 1999.

The DVD seems a bit confused as to which direction it should go.  One moment its talking about how the Edinburgh Tattoo and Royal Tournaments came about, and next its spending extended amounts of time discussing various acts of the show.  The Royal Navy Gun Run and the King""s Troop Royal Horse Artillery get the lion share of attention it seems.  While this is ok, I would have preferred more attention spent on actual Tattoo production and where the producers think its all going today.  These Royal Tournament acts were covered quite extensively in the last video prodcution of that show in 1999.  It seems reduntant here to discuss them again.

The DVD is spot on when you have people like Melville Jameson and Ian Fraser talking about their shows.  Parker goes on about the Royal Tournament being the granddaddy of all modern tattoos, yet it is called a tournament!  Things are interesting when you have actual bandsmen and directors of music talking about how they put the show together, and again the emphasis is on the 1995 Royal Tournament production.

Another interesting part is the distinction made between different types of tattoos and how they might be produced.  The traditional format and staging of a tattoo whether its a big show like Edinburgh, or a smaller local venue provides interesting perspective.  More of this would been interesting.  The origins of the evening hymn and how it remains a center piece in most tattoo finales is also quite interesting.

All in all a very interesting DVD which could have been made even more so.  There are no extra features which might have shown other tattoos, and no additional interviews with tattoo producers.  A more up to date work still needs to be done which could show where things stand today.  In the UK in particular the tattoo scene has undergone a lot of chnages since 1995.  Only Edinburgh and a few other smaller productions remain today.

The reduction of British army bands has also changed how tattoos can be produced there.  The emergence of the tattoo in Canada, and the USA also deserves note.  The Nova Scotia Tattoo has brought about a lot of popular changes to the traditional tattoo format which needs to be discussed in order to provide a fuller perspective of where tattoo production is going today.  The creation of an International Tattoo Organization (IATO) means that almost all tattoo productions now are starting to have similer format as each shares info. together.  All of these are important aspects of tattoo proudction today which this DVD really does not discuss.  A follow-up work someday will hopefully address these issues.  I give this DVD four stars simply because it is a bit dated and not as comprehensive as it could be.  Still, what's here is interesting enough.  Recommended for tattoo fans.",1181952000,19,3331,4.882352941176471

8079245,4,B000ARXFMI,Somehow missed that this was really not cuts from various tattoos and tattoo like tournaments so there really isn't a lot of full military music.  However it was good background info that I enjoyed learning.  Trouble is that you might watch this once or twice to understand the event but then its bascially retired or re-gifted.,1313280000,,328,4.839285714285714
8079246,4,B000ARXFMI,"I found it very interesting, samples of other events, would like to get more individual Tattoos, from various countries. Put together quite well. So I hope to get more DVDs of such.  Planned to collect more ofTattoo/Tournaments DVDs.  I have a love of Scottish pipes and drums.

Kindest Regards

8079247,3,B000ARXFMI,The cover gives the impression of much more pomp and pageantry that is to be expected. The DVD focuses too much on the history of the tattoo and makes too much of small-scale tattoos. Anyone thinking it is a tattoo all-in-one will be disappointed.,1251504000,9,247,4.636363636363637
