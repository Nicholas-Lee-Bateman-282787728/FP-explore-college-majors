7883820,3,6305121826,"Their are 2 reasons why you Should purchase these films. (their are about 20 reasons why you Shouldn't) Reason 1. Ginger Lynn Allen... she is Quite a Good Looking Woman, I Could Embellish, but I fear ... may Object. Reason 2. Hey, They are Better than the Police Academy films, as many other reviewers have already pointed out.
I am a Bad movie fan, so Don't let the 3 stars fool you, these films are far from ""Shakespeare"", but they do have a Dumb Charm that I (as a Bad Movie Freak) find Very Appealing. The Virtally All-Female cast are Funny, there's no denying that. Weather you are laughing With them or At them.. Your Laughing, and They're making you do it.
The Scripts are... The Dialogue is... Well, who are we Kidding, The Scripts and Dialogue are Sub-Par, at best, but even if you are Laughing in a ""I Can't Believe They Made This Junk"" way, your still Laughing, that seems to be the Point of these films.
The Acting is Adequete, Ginger Lynn Allen and Linnea Quigley and Funny enough to Sustain Interest. (maybe not enough so to warrent 3 sequals) Dawn Wildsmith is only in the Original, which is a Shame as she is Quite Hilarious.
Technical Credits are also Adequete, (meaning I've seen alot worst) at least the Sets arn't Cardboard and all the Sound Effects and Dialogue can be heard. (unlike Crap Classics like ""The Toxic Avenger"" and ""Tromeo and Juliet"")
And Finally, to Answer the Big Question.. Yes, there is Partial Nudity in the film, but is is Very tame by todays standards, see the film to laugh at the Production Values, the Bad Jokes and the Sub-Par Acting.",988588800,,1579,4.543859649122807
