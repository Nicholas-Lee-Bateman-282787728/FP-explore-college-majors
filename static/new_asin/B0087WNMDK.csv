8526054,5,B0087WNMDK,"I loved the Almost video 'Round 3' back when it first came out and when I saw an advertisement about a new Almost video I knew I had to check it out. The only con is that Rodney Mullen doesn't have a part. The positives are that the video is fun, the editing isn't distracting or annoying, the skating is great, and the dvd is only $5. Haslam's part alone is worth $5. If you like the Almost team, you know what your getting into. If your into hardcore skaters hitting stair set after stair set, you might want to look elsewhere though.",1356220800,,536,4.213592233009709
