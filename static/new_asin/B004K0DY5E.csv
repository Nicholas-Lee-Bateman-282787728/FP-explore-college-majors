8432078,5,B004K0DY5E,"I bought this set through Ebay, because it was quite a bit cheaper.

I came upon this series & Life on Mars recently through Hulu. Sadly, at the end of January, they removed it, so I've been on the Hunt for the DVD's of both.

I've become smitten with both series. So unique, fascinating, excellent characters, acting & stories. Surprised I had not come across it sooner, since I love British TV shows much more than US shows.

I ended up buying a region free dvd/blu-ray player just to play this & LoM. (although it plays just fine on a computer & VLC player)

Highly recommended series.",1455235200,,588,4.4672897196261685
8432079,3,B004K0DY5E,In my opinion not as good as Life on Mars but still quite good and most entertaining. Note you need a region free DVD player to watch these UK disks in the US.,1423958400,,159,3.8484848484848486
8432080,5,B004K0DY5E,"It was extremely hard to put this great series box set down ..I now have completed my goal to see what happened to Life on Mars detective Sam Tyler and of course how all the characters of Ashes especially D I Drake. made out in the finale....brillantly acted , a plot that finishes as it should in grand and emotional fashion ..I would recommend this series most highly ,,,,  it is only on PAL so you will need a region free dvd player......Cheers Guv.",1419984000,,452,4.380952380952381
8432081,5,B004K0DY5E,"We relaly like this series.  I had to buy a special DVD player so we could watch it because it only comes in the PAL region.  We needed a new DVD player anyway and we got one that plays everything.

As usual with the BBC, wish the series had gone one longer.",1417910400,,258,3.923076923076923
