The movie was a little unusual in that in incorporated Charllie Chan's Number One Son, Jimmie into the plot. Key Luke is always fun to watch.",1533513600,,290,4.017241379310345
8758593,5,B01EGQ7KRO,"This is the first of the three Mr. Moto films made in 1938, after the two made in 1937. While quite old, the film is very clear. I enjoyed it. Unlike the prior two films, Mr. Moto is a teacher in a US University teaching police how to solve crimes. During the initial lesson, he shows his skills in fighting, a skill he uses later against a killer. Lon Chaney, Jr. has a small part in the film, very small, as a bodyguard. Ward Bond has a slightly larger part as a boxing champion. Much humor is added to the film by a kleptomaniac detective and by the fumbling of the police lieutenant. Mr. Moto looks on at the foolish talk and actions by virtually everybody in the film and smiles. The plot focuses on a death following a boxing match caused by poison, and by bets that are made. Mr. Moto does not gamble but bluffs.",1511740800,2,819,4.222929936305732

8758598,3,B01EGQ7KRO,"Mr. Motos Gamble, 1938 film

Mr. Moto explains why the dead body can either be a murder or suicide. Science can determine the differences. Wellington explains his taking ways. The son of a detective attends his course. Then they to a boxing match. Somebody is putting up big money on this contest. Is it fixed? We see a knock-out. Moto explains the danger of gambling. Will Bill Steele win? The audience identifies with one of the boxers. Wellington takes a seat. [Are they nailed down?] Very exhilarating. Steele wins in the third round. A doctor looks over the loser, but he is dead. A concussion? Moto corrects the doctor. Was it the collodion? A man goes to collect his winnings. The loser did not lay off the bet off. Why did people in six different cities make the same long shot? Steels is indicted for manslaughter. Was he just a patsy to take the blame?

Steele is bailed out by a newspaper (to sell newspapers). Motos class studies the boxing glove of the winner. They have different explanations for the murder. Then Wellington drives away! Moto reads the label on a coat and finds a clue. Can the Sheriff stop a car with nails? Crude but effective. Stanton show he is ready for his next bout. Lt. Riggs has a clue to the murderer, if he can find John Howard from Detroit. Does Gabby know something about the fight? Who put big money on that fight? Other locations tell about John Howard. They find John Howard but he won't talk. Moto has a scheme. That night he disposes of a threat. Can a pistol be rigged to shoot by a timer? Can you remember now? Biff Moran will fight Steele. The fight begins. Steele is winning! Mr. Benton shows his hand, Can he get away? There is a payoff. Moto finds another body. The case is solved. There is a final joke for the audience.

This story has a warning against gambling on events that could be fixed. It tells about the culture of that era. The idea of a water pistol squirting poison on a boxers glove is ridiculous! Dont referees check gloves before each round? Shouldnt the police have searched that fight manager when there was a question of murder? Somebody could have tampered with its contents to affect the fight. Wellington is played by Maxie Rosenbloom, Stanton is played by Ward Bond.",1488412800,,2245,4.538271604938272
