1979887,5,B00019075S,"What happens when you have a dream, you go for it...and you come up short?  This film is a realistic portrayal of the nitty-gritty, dark underbelly of the rock scene.  Jacki (Gina Gershon) is an aging rock star with real-life problems...should she keep pursuing the dream and be a 60-year old wanna-be rock star?  Or is it time to stop?  The movie also shows the consequences your decisions can have on your friends.  Gina Gershon give a powerhouse performance hear, even signing all the vocals, and is just flat-out spectacular.
As for the quality of the DVD...the movie appears to have been filmed digitally and the picture quality is excellent for a small-budget film such as this one.  The sound is great as well.  I just wish there were more extras on the making of the movie & perhaps some raw footage of Gina singing.",1079308800,22,824,4.641379310344828

1979923,3,B00019075S,"Based on the autobiographical play by Cheri Lovedog, Prey for Rock & Roll is episodic and ultimately unsatisfying as a narrative, but makes up for it with a lot of heart and energy.  The question being explored is a difficult one: what about all of the artists who are talented, dedicated, and who aren't going to make it?  On the eve of her 40th birthday, Gina Gershon's Jacki re-examines her life and her choices as her girlfriend walks out on her.  She's put her career, such as it is, ahead of their relationship one too many times.  Her band, the Clam Dandies, has been playing LA's rock clubs for years without ever getting a record deal, and the fact that the opportunity has largely passed them by weighs heavy on all of them.  The club scene rogues' gallery includes Laura Petty's Faith, a guitar teacher by day; her much-younger girlfriend Sally (Shelly Cole); and Drea de Matteo's Tracy, a trust-fund kid on the rapid decline.  The music they make together is fun and energetic but it isn't going to make anybody famous, though that seems like it's almost beside the point.  As Jacki puts it, she can either be a bitter rock chick who's in a band, or be a bitter rock chick who's not in a band, and that's not a hard choice at all. The performances throughout are solid and the tech specs (this was an early entry in the Digital Acquisition trend) are where they belong.  If you know the rock n' roll club scene (in probably any city in America, at least), this will probably resonate.  Whether or not you enjoy it will probably depend on where you are, in that scene.",1357776000,2,1579,4.493006993006993
1979924,3,B00019075S,"It is a fun rock movie for chicks! Nothing special, nothing horrible. Gina Gershon and Drea DeMateo are both not hard on the eyes!",1353888000,2,130,4.458333333333333
1979925,2,B00019075S,"Prey for Rock 'N' Roll tries hard to be a gritty docudrama about the emotional fallout of aging in the music industry when you haven't come close to succeeding in the first place.  Instead the film falls into forced melodrama. From the graphic violence, to the stereotypical lesbian band members, to the end on a high note climax; Prey For Rock 'n' Roll is horribly formulaeic. The viewer knows what to expect from beginning to end, and that's not why I go to see films.

Sure Gina Gershon looks the part as the tattooed biatch in motorcycle boots. But one listen to her and her band, and one can see why they never made it big. Derivative punk, mediocre lyrics, and ""playing"" that lacks innovation will stymie the efforts of any wanna-be ( which is what Gershon and her band are).

Honestly, I can't remember the name of the band or any of the characters in the film as the film fails to create characters that we, the audience, might actually care about. We are given stereotypes to identify with, not people.  The only glaring exception being Gershon's character, a character so unlikable you hope fervently that she gets her richly deserved comeuppance. Then again maybe life has already done that for Gershon's character; by failing to make her the rock star she so desperately wants to be.

All in all, Prey For Rock 'N' Roll is a trite and mediocre film you watch when you're bored and there's nothing else to watch or to do.",1334707200,,1432,4.578125
1979926,5,B00019075S,"If you are a fan  of Gina Gershon{and who isn""t} you will love this movie. It is an iteresting story of four young women  a rock group known as the ""Clam Dandys"",trying to ""make it"". The story is very interesting,and I found the acting superb. Although I am not a Rock fan, I enjoyed the music. I consider this film one of the multi-talented Gina Gershons best films. She is not good in the film,she is great. I believe everone that views this very entertaining movie will love it.",1324080000,2,481,4.393258426966292

1979928,4,B00019075S,"I liked the movie but punk music it was not even close. Only one song did it for me. But I guess that's why one of the girls said ""faster and louder."" I agree. But even twenty years ago punk music was faster than what they played, they were almost like a biker version of The Go-Go's. HA! But yeah, I absolutely LOVED Gina's hair in the movie! Anyway, the story line was pretty good. I liked it and I liked the message.",1263168000,,419,4.0602409638554215
1979929,4,B00019075S,"Gina Gershon stars as Jacki, a woman who has devoted her whole life to becoming a rock star. Jacki leads an all female Punk rock band, who have been struggling to make it for years. The band are like a family, and have gone through hell and back together. Jacki is closing-in on her fortieth Birthday, and she's weary of trying to get a break. She begins to wonder if it's worth it, to keep up the quest for rock stardom.

This flick is cutting-edge, in many ways. First of all, Gina's character is a lesbian, who's involved with with a woman of color. Then there's the gritty, no holds-barred look at the down-and-dirty world of Punk rock. Plus, this film made a of point of portraying a female band, that's just as grungy and devil-may-care, as any male Punk band.

Punk rock has always been an equal opportunity genre. That's part of it's charm. The Punk rock movement has been deeply influenced by many female rock icons, such as Patti Smith, Tribe 8, Wendy O. Williams, Team Dresch, and many others. Some of these female Punk rockers, are also lesbian and/or bi. Like them, Jacki's band also freely expresses their right, to defy sexual conventions.

This film has lots of heart, soul, and anguish. It shows that rock stardom, can be more elusive than ever. Punk rock especially, is anything but glamorous. It's actually anti-glamorous. Jacki and her band, certainly fit this anti-glamor mold. Those who have ever sought to become rock stars, can identify with all of the heartache that can be a part of pursuing a career, in rock music. This isn't the greatest rock film ever, but it's damn good. It's edgy, contemporary, exciting, and above all, very moving.",1261958400,2,1665,4.675767918088737
1979930,4,B00019075S,"If you have a youngster interested in a career in rock 'n' roll, have them watch this movie to show how incredibly difficult it can be and what to expect.  I enjoyed the interactions between the band members and Gina Gershon was terrific.  There's nothing terribly exciting about this movie as it hits too close to reality for those musicians who don't hit the big time (which is just about all of them).",1261180800,2,404,4.52054794520548
1979931,4,B00019075S,This movie is a realistic story and the acting is very good by all the cast. It is very believable the events that take place and how the characters handle them it has an almost documentary feel to it. The music is so raw and emotional a  most see especilly if you are a fan of Gina Gershon or Lori Petty. you will smile cry and really feel while watching this movie.,1260316800,,367,4.097222222222222
1979932,2,B00019075S,"This movie is a below average movie.  You can tell that the budget was limited for this movie.  Don't get me wrong, Gina Gershon does a good acting job, but some of the others actors just don't pull it off.  The best thing about this movie is that it shows how unglamorous being in a band can be, and what hard work it is.
It's too bad that this movie had such a limited budget.  Gina does an OK job in singing, but the movie is titled incorrectly.  The band that this is about is a punk band, not a rock & roll band. So, the title is very misleading. Punk and Rock & Roll are not the same genre, so it should have been titled ""Prey for Punk"".
Gina is a good singer when she sings slower melodies, but she doesn't know how to sing punk or rock & roll.
She is incredibly attractive though.  So, if you just want to see her looking hot, then buy this. If you want a good quality film, skip this one.",1234656000,,897,3.983240223463687
1979933,3,B00019075S,"If you're a Gina Gershon fan, you're likely to give PREY FOR ROCK & ROLL a higher rating. She's the best thing about this clichd musical drama.

The Clam Dandys are four female punk rockers (Gershon, Drea de Matteo, Lori Petty, Shelly Cole) who have been struggling to eke out a living as professional musicians. Just when looks as though they'll finally get their big break, relationships begin to implode as they learn how exacting the price of fame can be.

Although it's based on a semi-autobiographical play by co-scripter Cheri Lovedog, PREY FOR ROCK & ROLL is essentially the same old cautionary tale that the movies have been selling us for years. In fact, if you take away the punk rock milieu and the lesbian love scenes, what's left is a plot Elvis Presley used in about a dozen films. And like far too many Elvis movies, the songs in PREY FOR ROCK & ROLL are uniformly forgettable, making a convincing case that the group's obscurity really is deserved.

But Gina Gershon makes an extremely believable rock & roll chick (Gershon really has done live concert tours) and gives the film a credibility it otherwise wouldn't possess.",1226361600,,1140,4.747474747474747
1979934,4,B00019075S,"Caught this on cable & was totally enthralled - as a member of a rock band
(altho the only female) I can say with honesty this film has some of the seamier sides that are the reality of this business as well as the lifestyle some have fallen under. Gina Gershon is completely believeable
as are Drea, Shelly and Lori Petty (making for one hell of a performance);
to know Gina also did the vox etc as well? This IS the rawk-life kids!

I wish there were more films that told it like it is instead of the plasticized fantasies than some reviewers seem to have expected.",1165622400,4,466,4.626506024096385
1979938,4,B00019075S,"An excellent movie, well cast, with a reasonable and easy to follow storyline.  It really was reminiscent of Joan Jett's early days (in Philly)(I really expected Gershon to belt out 'I Love Rock and Roll').

It tells the story of the 'wanna be' groups playing clubs and wishing for a break. (There has to be at least 50 bands that are good that don't make it for every band - good or bad - that does and this is their story.

It deals with the gritty part of life trying to 'make it' as an artist.

-""What do you REALLY want to be when you grow up?""

-""When are you going to get a real job?""

-""When are you going to pay the rent?""

-""How are you going to pay the rent?""

-""You spent HOW much on a d#$@ guitar?""

There are touching and tragic moments as well as some good music all presented equally well.  You won't finish this movie with a smile on your face - but you'll be wrung out - as if you are the one that just finished a club set...  All in all, an entertaining movie (I have to admit the 'street justice' hammered out got my applause).

For those playing the club scene, or related to anyone struggling to make it - this is a must see.  For everyone else - see it, then go support your local bar band.",1163203200,4,1248,4.061475409836065
1979949,4,B00019075S,"To Quote the rock band KISS, ""Rock and Roll All Night, Party Every day""...if you believe that, don't watch this movie.

Put together a cast of modern B-rated female actresses (Gina Gershon, Lori Petty, Drea De Matteo and Shelly Cole) in a film about a female LA club band trying to make it big and watch this film cook.

Prey for Rock & Roll is a small indy film and draws you into the story. Based on Cheryl Lovedog's plaY, This is not a female Hard Day's Night or Spice World. This FILM  is a taste of real life with its darker side. Its raw filmmaking with a driven story of success and failure mixed with death and life. This is NOT American Idol, this is real life Rock & Roll 101. This is not hype, but it does get heavy handed in spots. This R rating this film has is earned, but it is needed to move this story. You can smell the darkeness of one's soul from this movie

Now to the acting.... Gina Gershon is amazing, best since her role in Showgirls. The part of an over 40 year old rocker  is taylor made for here. She sings the Cheryl Lovedog songs with so much passion and heart, you wonder when her album is coming out. And in their what happened to them department, Welcome back to filmmaking Ms Lori Petty--this is not a League of Our Own, but you blend well in this film. Drea de Matteo , i see why you won your Emmy, too bad not many in the Oscar area saw this film...you would have  had one of those too!

If you are seeking a nice cute, clean rock & roll film, rent A Hard Day's Night. Help, Spice Girls or Sgt Pepper...If you want a real slice of what it means to live, breath and love what Rock & Roll is and its not so pretty underside, THIS IS YOUR MOVIE.

If you're looking for a cheap softcore porn film or lots of nude scenes, this isn't for you.

Like sports movies, I'm tired of the less-than-realistic and cheesy rock movies. You don't always make it to the big time. In fact, you don't always catch a break and get a gig playing simply in a club. This movie is the story of one band, Clam Dandy, that did not make it. A true story, by the way, for those of you who complained about the rape and other dramatic elements.

I'm not going to bother reviewing every sequence, you'll just have to watch the movie. I liked it. Period. If Gina Gershon isn't reason enough to see this movie, here's another: she sings both the songs and plays the guitar. Now that's sexy.",1140739200,11,910,4.378698224852071
1979953,3,B00019075S,"...I can't make up my mind how I feel about this rock 'n' roll flick.  On the positive side, Gina Gershon and Lori Petty are the two best reasons for watching this little epic which I suspect is more true for the average band than not.  They both put in very good, gritty performances, and Gershon's hairstyle is really cool!  It is obvious the cast and crew really believed in this story that I even bothered to rate it this high.  Not familiar with the punk scene, I noticed that Gershon's vocals are very much on par with those of Chrissy Hynd's, and the band themselves reminded me of Joan Jett's old band the Runaways if they were still together now.  The story, gratefully, doesn't have the phony-balony happy ending of so many of this persuasion, and I am grateful to see something that tells a story about the average band with a bit more truth than the usual rocker flick.

Now the bad stuff:  Too many tragedies, too many lesbians, and really awful music.  In fact, it was as if this film was taking itself way too seriously, so it got out of hand in its over-the-top plot quickly.  Gershon was overly tattooed until she resembled a wall of display art in her character's parlor, and her own character had really bad artwork all over her body, like some kid drew on her when they ran out of paper.  Everyone in this film also needed a friggin' bath, because it looked like a carnie convention.  All that was missing were the corndogs and the tilt o' whirl.

With such mixed feelings about a rock movie whose heart I feel was in the right place, I still can't help feeling something is amiss and, no, it isn't the fact that Jacki peed on that contract in the end because of her ""integrity.""  (Integrity?  Is that when you're gay at first and then start slobbering all over your drummer's brother in the end?)  ""Every Six Minutes"" is a really lousy song about rape.

If they hadn't messed with the character of Faith, I would have been with this movie completely, but they lost me there. Still, 7/8 of a great movie is still pretty great. If you like rock movies, or tough chick movies, then definitely check this film out!",1123545600,6,624,4.621621621621622
1979969,2,B00019075S,"The opposite of love is not hate, it's apathy and that's how I feel about this movie. It's not great, but it's not terrible, it's just so...mediocre. Gina Gershon's Jacki is not a has-been because, at 40, she never was. The rest of her band is equally as flat and why was 3/4 of the band gay? An honest bore",1122163200,6,307,4.133333333333334
1979970,5,B00019075S,"I am tired of the films that show the person making it big in the end. This is a more realistic picture of the rock world.  The characters are well scripted, and acted.  From Girshon's lead to Blucas' Animal, every character lets you understand their view of the world.  Possibly too many tragidies, but I understand this was based on a true story.  Definately would recommend this to the educated viewer.",1119830400,4,405,4.661971830985915
1979971,1,B00019075S,"This poorly written, poorly acted movie has so many flaws I don't know where to begin.  It's chock full of rock and roll stereotypes and the usual, predictable plots.  An aging lead singer of a chick rock band, overplayed to the hilt by Gina Gershon, is suffering a rock and roll midlife crisis in her forties.  She doesn't know if she wants to keep the band together.  The band consists of a bass player portrayed by the gorgeous Drea De Matteo, who is the coked up loser in the band who resorts to servicing her dealer in the bathrooms of the clubs the band plays in when she can no longer support her habit.  (Yawn)  Lori Petty plays the lesbian lover of another band member I cared so little about that I didn't even bother to find out the name of the actress who portrayed her. (!)  (Another yawn.)  Gershon remains true to type: Strong, willful, tattooed, bisexual and confused about love.  The bands songs are depressing and whiny, very L7 on smack, and the movie culminates with Petty's character being killed when she is struck by a car while running across a street to catch a pair of punks who have just made off with her guitar and her amps as she's loading them onto her truck.  (Oddly enough, the guitar shows up at her funeral a few minutes later in the movie, propped up nicely next to a funeral wreath and a picture of Petty.)  Hmmmm.  Petty's death scene was played out so ridiculously that I found myself laughing during the funeral scene, and I'm not an insensitive person.  But this movie was just too over the top and stupid to take seriously.  There are other meaningless sub plots involving a rape, a paroled ex-con and a cheesy record exec that try desperately to save this ailing rock flick, but to no avail.  Definitely brain candy that will rot your gray matter if you take it too seriously. You'd be better off renting an old Janis Joplin concert video and settling in with a bottle of Southern Comfort.",1118534400,9,1932,4.48
1979972,5,B00019075S,"I saw this movie in an independant theater and it was brilliant. Lori Petty and Gina Gershon are hot! Good acting and great music. To bad that Lori Petty's character had to die. The guy deserved what he got for raping her girlfriend,such a pig.

1979974,3,B00019075S,"Well, I really wanted to like this film. The premise is good and we need a film like this but unfortunately this one didn't do it for me. Gina is good in it - she's sassy and tough, with smartass comeback lines and cool hair but her singing was forced. In fact, the IFC documentary ""Rocked! With Gina Gershon"" (in which she really tours with a real band to promote PFR&R) had her singing much better and believable. The energy of  the band was exciting too. As one of the reviews above noted, there is much ""forced melodrama"" here and cliches abound. Even her fake tattoos look fake. (If she's suppose to be a tattoo artist she wouldn't have ones that look like they were just stamped on with no style or connection to each other) What she does to Tracy's boyfriend is pretty cool though...

All in all, the actors were good but they didn't have much to work with. Too bad...",1100563200,11,875,4.361963190184049
1979975,2,B00019075S,"While I'll give Gina Gershon credit for trying to come up with a new way of telling the rock dream, I have to say that this piece of product comes up short on original ideas. I know she spent a long time getting to this realization, but more time should have been spent on writing a decent screenplay. The heroine/madonna, herion addict, lesbian couple seems played out.

The energy is there, but when you add awful lines about addiction and why these women have stayed so long in the business, not to mention that if they have been prey to to this lifestyle called Rock N Roll, I just don't buy it. Give me something to beleive in.",1100304000,6,632,4.3559322033898304
1979976,4,B00019075S,"Ok, this is one of those movies that I saw on the wall in Blockbuster and thought, hmm... I bet this will be good in that awful way. I was wrong

This is a great movie!

Seriously, If you liked Hedwig and the Angry Inch, chances are you'll dig this flick.

4 struggling rock chicks try to make it in this empowering tale of drugs, sex, and rock and roll. Rape, abusive boyfriends, dysfunctional families, and the problem of getting older add a layer of realism and depth to this punk rock gem studded with hardcore performances and music by Gina Gershon herself, Cheri Lovedog, Sara Lee, and Samantha Maloney. Even the ever fabulous Stephen Trask (of Hedwig fame) lends his genius to this portrait of the band that never quite makes it, but rock til the end.

""We'll play as long as theres an audience. And when theres not an audience, we'll play for the bartender.""

Rock on.",1093132800,5,876,4.484276729559748
1979977,5,B00019075S,"Gina Gerhson absolutely incredible.  Do you remember the first time you heard (take your pick) Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, The Ramones, Patti Smith, White Stripes.......well, here it is again - that same feeling - rock and roll guts.....so it doesn't matter what the other reviewers say...this one has it and the only way you will really know is if you listen to it yourself.  If you like real rock and roll, real intensity, no holds barred.....get it.
The band - actually playing (versus the movie band) is Gina Gershon vocals, Gina Volpe guitar piano backup vocals, Cheri Lovedog guitar, Sara Lee bass, Samantha Maloney drums (on all songs except Studiostar).  Studiostar was done by Gina Gershon, Linda Perry, and Patty Schemel.  All songs were written by Cheri Lovedog (with help from Grace Chapman on Every Six Minutes and Stephen Trask on Bitter Pill).....except Studiostar, which was written by Gina Gershon and Linda Perry.
The band in the movie is Gina Gershon (Jackie) vocals & guitar, Lori Petty (Faith) lead guitar, Shelley Cole (Sally) drums,  and Drea de Matteo (Tracy) bass.
At least this is the info on the CD linear notes and on the web movie sites.  If the truth is different, it doesn't seem to be out there yet.",1090195200,3,1234,4.8246445497630335

I really do believe that this movie has that kind of potential!!*---*also of note is the cable IFC channel is showing several weeks of shows that are kind of like a MAKING OF+BEHIND THE SCENES look at this movie.  you may have to order the channel it is not offered unless you pay more for it here--columbus, ohio.  also of noteworthy notes is a mention to record promoters---the really good track in the movie is a song called EVERY 6 MINS.  if the world can tolerate JANIES GOT A GUN and multiple songs of such---then this song should be played.  PUT IT ON THE RADIO or release it as a single.  my expertise in this area---I know when something sounds right!!  any time I get to see GINA grrrr!  with strutting, snarling, posing, frenchkissingfu,  and general (...) on screen and stage.

I hear she was even asked to direct her career toward music after this movie was made, and I can see why.
