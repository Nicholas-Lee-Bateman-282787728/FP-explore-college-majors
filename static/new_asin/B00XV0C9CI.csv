The narrator is virtually undetectable though over the background music that is played too loudly.

The thing about sound affecting people in "" unknown ways "" is very true...even government science agrees. Scary thought that.

7199721,5,B00XV0C9CI,Thoroughly enjoyed this documentary and fantastically put together. Heard many ghost experiences from travelling the tunnels but it was great to hear from random amount of people their experiences.,1434844800,5,197,5.827586206896552
7199722,3,B00XV0C9CI,"It's like hanging out with random people who have a lot of ghost stories. Also you're in the subway a lot. Basically Britain has WAY more dead people under & around their tunnels than America. Some bodies have been dug up. Also some photos people have taken are eagerly shown about.

It kept me involved the entire time. Usually if I am watching something that does not hold my interest my mind wanders and I start to think about something I need to be doing etc. I didn't loose interest at all during ""Ghosts of the Underground"".

7199737,4,B00XV0C9CI,Interesting film. Lots of creaks and groans down in the bowels of London but I remember my dad telling me about the haunting's and he was a historian so I found it all very validating and somewhat creepy to hear his stories repeated on the film. Not scary enough for a October ghostfest just a few chills is all !,1474243200,,313,4.233333333333333

7199748,3,B00XV0C9CI,"Somewhat interesting although not as much as I had hoped. The underground tunnels were cut through areas of what you might describe as a vast archeological digs waiting to happen with graveyards, plague pits and thousands of years of history all of which have been disturbed and revealed by the excavation works from 1863 to the present day. However, despite all the foregoing, ghostly experiences seemed to be sparse and vague.
As a Brit having worked for many years in London I was very familiar with all the locations involved which added to the interest I'm not sure if it would hold the interest for very long of anyone who had never been there.",1469577600,,650,4.7105263157894735

7199757,4,B00XV0C9CI,"I loved this documentary. The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is the sound quality.

7199765,5,B00XV0C9CI,"Great paranormal documentary. Well produced and a perfect cerebral soundtrack which adds to the ambience - not cheesy and over the top like many others I've seen. FYI - Mostly anecdotal encounters, so don't be disappointed if you don't see any video/audio recordings of paranormal activity from a ghost hunting team. Only other critique is that the sound mixing was a bit off and the narrator's voice would fade down at times. But otherwise a good watch.",1460592000,,454,4.909090909090909

7199771,3,B00XV0C9CI,"Overall this was OK.  It has some nice footage of the underground tunnels, which is pretty neat if you are like me and have never seen them.  It also has people talking about their personal experiences.  Kind of boring, certainly nothing that I would run and tell my friends or family to watch, but it's not too terrible.",1450915200,,321,4.5

7199777,4,B00XV0C9CI,Excellent presentation!  I love history and ghost stories and this combined both with the telling of the numerous disturbed graves and tragedies that have happened over the centuries.  The audio was an issue as the music was louder than the narrative and interviews at times.  Would recommend.,1447027200,,293,5.191489361702128
7199778,4,B00XV0C9CI,"This is an interesting series presenting eyewitnesses telling their own stories. Each one is a common occurrence which happens in an unexplained manner, then at the end each event is tied to a place with an incredible history. My major criticism of this work is that for those of us unfamiliar with these tube stations is that the explanation of the significance of each place waits until the last ten seconds or so of each place of occurrence and then is not fully explained--leaving us to have to research the place in order to truly understand its significance.",1446854400,,564,4.76530612244898

7199782,3,B00XV0C9CI,Appeared to be a series of TV episodes strung together and wasn't terribly comprehensive in either presentation or storyline. I think it would have worked better as a series.,1444867200,,174,5.0344827586206895

7199784,4,B00XV0C9CI,"I always prefer British ghost/paranormal documentaries over the US ones.  The US ones are generally over-the-top sensational, goofy and embarrassing.  This was a classic UK ghost doc which had a great production value, realism, historical info and was reserved in drawing conclusions.  It was also quite short and appears to have been a television special.",1442707200,,356,5.4363636363636365
7199785,2,B00XV0C9CI,It's ok not that amazing. It's mainly just eye witness testimony. Not that interesting.,1442361600,,87,5.285714285714286
7199786,4,B00XV0C9CI,"Stunningly shot, tastefully-executed documentary among the very best of its kind, but unfortunately they changed the original soundtrack, which for me is what really made the film. The original had music from Sigur Ros and Mogwai, among others. It added a beautiful, haunting soudntrack, which was replaced (I assume because they couldn't obtain the rights) with a more generic, less moving set of backing songs. It's still fantastically well-done, but I really didn't get the same haunting, eerie impact as I did from the original soundtrack. This might also explain why the sound is so off in this version, the too-loud music and too-quiet speaking.",1442188800,3,651,5.20952380952381

7199790,5,B00XV0C9CI,Really enjoyed  this documentary. It was interesting to hear the different experiences.,1440892800,,87,6.25
7199791,3,B00XV0C9CI,"OK. I'm a bit ambivalent with this documentary. On the one hand, it's got some very interesting stories that are spooky when you place yourself into the place of the people who experienced them. The whole gas lamp guy and long-haired blonde lady stories especially spooked me out. So good there.

But this documentary had some serious editing issues. Other reviewers have made note, but I just gotta put my two cents in. The sound editing! Oy vey.... There are parts of this where the music is too loud, to the point of drowning out the narrators and speakers. And for a documentary that relies so much on oral stories, that's a tragedy.

Also, some of the evidence and points the documentary put forward I've got to question. The whole sound guy part made me rolling my eyes. He never seemed to really come to a point and the points he did come to seemed to have no relevance to the REST of the documentary. Also, the whole man in the electric chair.... My mind was coming up with multiple explanations for that one. Commercial poster on the wall behind the train? One of those transparent commercial window coverings (think they had those in the 80s). Being just like the display in the wax museum is very suspicious.

So interesting to a point with some good creepy, oral stories. But sound editing and flaky evidence besides the oral make this a D-rate documentary. Enjoy for the stories but don't use this one for actual research purposes.",1440547200,7,1444,4.6328125
7199792,2,B00XV0C9CI,"I do not like this documentary. I like to some proof. They mention CCTV cameras everywhere. Well, can we see some footage? I have the impression that the documentary is meant to be spooky. I wonder if the loud music and very low narration has something to do with it. Finally, without bringing down the work of the scientist and his infra sounds, I think a more thorough investigation is needed. More equipment, night cameras perhaps, EVRs... Anyway: I think the idea is worth something. The stage is certainly first class (that's why I don't hate the documentary), but it needs a lot more to look convincing (that's why I do not like the documentary). 2 stars it is.",1440374400,,667,4.61344537815126

7199800,2,B00XV0C9CI,"Bad audio - same complaint as everyone else. The music is too loud, the narration too low.

They have some guy with a microphone measuring sound frequencies, the theory being that frequencies too low to hear might cause uneasy feelings. Fine, but in one ""experiment"" he's recording at the completely wrong time. You see, someone had an experience when there were no train runnings and everything was closed. The experiment was done when trains were running and there were people about.

It's a shame - it could have been an interesting program with faster pacing and the exclusion of the man with the microphone. As it is, it's boring and even someone like me, who has watched some of the worst that paranormal television has to offer, could not finish watching.",1436054400,,762,4.809160305343512
7199801,4,B00XV0C9CI,"This documentary was subdued, without any theatrics, and I especially enjoyed the calm voice of the narrator. However, for those of us not familiar with the London underground, a bit more background information would be helpful. The stories seem randomly presented, rather than either organized chronologically or organized by station layout.
