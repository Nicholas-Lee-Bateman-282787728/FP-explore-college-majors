These thirty-three episodes were produced in France for television. They speak English but some actors have a slight accent. These lower budget productions have humor not found in earlier stories. These mostly original stories are serious, not a parody. Their quality varies, but all are worth viewing. Can you spot the ones from the original stories? The actors are Ronald Howard as Sherlock Holmes, Howard Marion Crawford as Dr. Watson, and Archie Duncan as Inspector Lestrade (and others).

There were originally thirty-nine episodes for this series, each 25 minutes long. The number after each episode denotes their original sequence. Some stories were taken from the stories by A. Conan Doyle and have an *. Other products contain the complete thirty-nine episodes.

This DVD contains the unrestored (i.e., lesser quality) versions of three movies with Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce - Dressed to Kill, Sherlock Homes and the Secret Weapon, and The Woman in Green.  MPI recently released the fully restored (by UCLA) versions of these movies on DVD.  The difference in quality is like night and day.  These are good movies (I'd rate them 4 stars), so do yourself a favor and get the restored versions instead of buying this DVD.  The restored versions more expensive, but well worth it.  I've rated this DVD 2 stars only because it's not overpriced - you'll get your money's worth, but that isn't saying much in this case.",1091318400,18,754,4.674242424242424

Sheldon Reynolds gets major credit for this fine series. He is always credited as Producer and sometimes also the Director and/or Writer. Charles Early (amoung others) are sometimes instead an episode's author.
Strongest point: Most of the scripts are completely original, and all are very good!",1079395200,7,728,5.813084112149533

However he still makes a credible Sherlock. The cost/value is a real plus and makes for many entertaining evenings.",985392000,4,288,4.8979591836734695
7841680,4,6303244092,"Four episodes from the entertaining 1954-1955 ""Sherlock Holmes"" TV series, starring Ronald (son of Leslie) Howard as an excellent, if too young, Sherlock Holmes, and H. Marion Crawford as a convincing and unusually competent Watson.  These aren't exactly PBS, but if you don't mind the light touch, the revolving cast of actors, and the rather unsubtle humor, you're in for a vintage-TV treat.  Some scripts are by ""Outer Limits"" story consultant Louis Morheim, and there is unusually good theme music by French composer Paul Jules Durand.

Overall, a very entertaining series, not as good as the Brett  series or the Rathbone/Bruce movies, but it is well worth your time to buy  it, I really like the Watson character and Lestrade, but Howald as Holmes  takes a little to get use to.",948153600,6,472,4.379310344827586
