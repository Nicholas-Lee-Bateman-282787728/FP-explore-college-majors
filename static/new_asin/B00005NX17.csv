1637869,5,B00005NX17,"One of my favorite war movies, and one of the more accurate, realistic ones in my opinion. I have this on dvd, and this Blu-ray is definitely much better quality. I disagree with another reviewer who claims this isn't remastered. If you like this movie, you need it on Blu-ray.",1440720000,8,277,4.56

1637871,3,B00005NX17,"I really do like this movie for the story it tells, the cinematography and the actors. That being said this version of the movies is obviously a forge in country LOW def recording put on Blu Ray disc. There has been no remastering of the picture quality or the sound quality that I can notice from my DVD copy. I will continue to wait for this great movie in a truly high def version.",1431648000,11,384,4.202702702702703

1637874,4,B00005NX17,Both of these movies are very true to what actually happened. I enjoyed them very much.,1093132800,,87,4.5
1637875,4,B00005NX17,"The Eagle Has Landed is a good movie,especially for those who like historically based action/thriller yarns. This is based on the premise of a crack SS unit landing in England dressed as Free Polish paratroopers in an attempt to kidnap Winston Churchill and return with him to Germany to broker a negotiated peace. An all star cast that is well acted and a story that moves along quite well.",1093046400,,391,4.681159420289855

1637883,4,B00005NX17,One must be a bit of a Vietnam knowledge person and understand the gore and blood of war to enjoy this film. A basically fairly accurate tale of what or guys were up against in the Vietnam war.,1495670400,,193,4.105263157894737

1637893,2,B00005NX17,"Not a review of the movie, but a review of the quality of the Blu-ray release. This is not a remastered movie. I can tell no difference in resolution between the Hamburger Hill DVD I've had for years and the Blu-ray version. The soundtrack is a bit better, but not much.

The movie itself is one of my favorites about the Vietnam War.  While it didn't receive the accolades of other Vietnam movies of the time, but it is very entertaining. I've even spoken to Vietnam vets who say it represents what they went through in combat.

If you own the DVD, don't bother buying the Blu-ray version.",1492992000,11,590,4.444444444444445

1637920,3,B00005NX17,"Not a bad war film, the acting is pretty good but the film can drag at times. It does a good job of showing the gritty of being soldier even outside of combat. The combat scenes are well done, but are dated. Worth a look, but not one of the best war films out there.",1477094400,,266,3.8545454545454545

7947996,2,B00005NX17,"Yes. The battle was certainly real enough but the characters in this particular film are fictional. Well acted enough (1980's style performances).
Why in the title to my review I refer to the 1950's is because one has to remember (while watching Vietnam-themed films like this) is that due to Ho Chi Minh's tremendous slaughter of North Vietnamese landowners in 1956 the US deemed his NV government stoppable.

PS read about the '56 mass-murder of Ho's in book ""Vietnam"" by Ken Burns.",1512172800,,484,4.902439024390244

7947998,4,B00005NX17,"This was a tough movie for me to watch; if the real battle was like the movie, then this was one of the most expensive hills in terms of lives spent.  i just hope it was worth the cost.

this movie has a lot of war killing in it, a lot of gore, a lot of death; more than most war movies.  The plot is easy to deduce, and the cast is faithful to their roles.",1509321600,,357,3.6710526315789473

7948000,5,B00005NX17,"Awesome movie that has a very realistic, documentary style. Could have beneffitted from a better musical score, not cheesy synth music that's glaringly out of place in the couple of battle scenes in which it is used. No score at all would been better and would have heightened the gritty, documentary feel of this movie, which makes stunning use of napalm and phosphorus ordnance special effects.",1508025600,,396,5.015151515151516
