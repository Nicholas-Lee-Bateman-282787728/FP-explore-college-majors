5572449,1,B00BC1UPQU,"A waste of Olivier Gruer martial talents. They should have just put a hocky mask on call it Jason kills. Story line sucked , the other actors were not convincing. I don't this would have made syfy.",1441065600,,197,4.351351351351352

5572451,1,B00BC1UPQU,"Discombobulated story telling, could have been done so much better with all the resources they put into it. What a waste",1440460800,,120,4.761904761904762

5572453,1,B00BC1UPQU,"Mr. Karr (Brad Potts) tells the story of the re-generator to a reporter at a restaurant. The scene highlights the problems low budget productions have in filming indoors, mainly sound, awkward close-ups, and bad writing. The Re-generator (Olivier Gruner) is a military killing machine that can re-generate itself in twenty seconds. When a plane carry him crashes in Juniper Point, Colorado he becomes a killing machine on the local teen campers.

This film is part sci-fi, part slasher with neither one being good. The killings are not graphic. The plot was boring and the characters dull due to terrible trite dialouge and sad acting.

Not worth viewing.

Parental guide: F-bombs, clothed sex, drug use. No nudity.",1382313600,2,715,5.146551724137931
5572454,1,B00BC1UPQU,"Imagine two movie freaks had the idea to combine the elements ""escaped super-soldier running wild"" and ""slasher killing off wasted teenagers in the woods"". They get drunk on a weekend and write a story on two pieces of paper. Each one writes on one piece of paper without consulting the other one. Nothing fits together but they still combine everything they wrote. After hiring Olvier Gruner they realize they don't have enough money for real actors, gore or even enough of Gruner's time to have him choreograph just one single fight scene.
Bottom line: Abysmal directing, camera work, sound (sounds as if dubbed by actors even worse than the ones you see), no real action and fights and a ""story"" that's more of an idea than a real story.",1375401600,,740,4.744186046511628
5572455,5,B00BC1UPQU,"This movie totally lived up to my expectations...while it won't be nominated for any Oscars soon it served it's purpose which was to entertain me for almost two hours.
If you like movies with action and suspense then this would be worth watching.",1366934400,2,246,4.744186046511628
5572456,1,B00BC1UPQU,"what can i say? this movie was hilarious! its so hilarious i couldn't finish the whole thing! its hard to believe someone sat there directing this movie and allowed it to reach shelf's. geuss they wanted a money . the funniest thing was when each person is carrying a keg up a mountain......... the acting sucks,most scenes are unintentionally funny. what more do you need?",1366848000,5,373,4.753846153846154

5572461,1,B00BC1UPQU,"I could not watch beyond about 20 minutes. The production quality was very low par. Possibly an Independent production? The acting (besides Olivier Gruner) was horrible. And the story just didn't grab me.

I am a long time fan of Olivier Gruner, and was really wanting to like this.",1465084800,,282,4.755102040816326

8565752,2,B00BC1UPQU,"I didn't like this movie.  The concept was very interesting, but Oliver Gruner just didn't pull it off.  For a dude with mad skills (the FIRST French World Kick-boxing Champion of the World) and a whole lot of French Foreign Legion military experience, you'd think he'd at least made the movie a bit exciting.  When I read about the movie and then saw who was going to be the Re-Generator, I thought I'd ignore the bad reviews.  Surely some action scenes from Oliver Gruner would hold the movie up to at least a three.  Well, there were no action scenes.  No martial arts.  No nothing.  It looked like they tried to rip off the Friday the 13th movie series without including the SFX of the gore.",1503619200,,695,4.4603174603174605
8565753,3,B00BC1UPQU,"Well it is what it is escapist crap, but not that bad of crap. The parts were well played, it was somewhat interesting. But what bothered me most  ( here where  you learn about my weird thinking) the chain they used to chain him up was some cheap crap you could get at Wally-World on sale.",1490486400,,289,4.142857142857143

8565755,3,B00BC1UPQU,2.5 stars with a steady tail wind.  I'm a long time Oliver Gruner fan and have enjoyed his martial arts skills in other movies.  This one pretty much degrades into a teen slasher movie but with some decent military hardware tossed in.,1489276800,,234,4.5476190476190474
