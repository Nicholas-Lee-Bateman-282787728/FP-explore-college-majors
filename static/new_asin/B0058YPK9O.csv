4607771,5,B0058YPK9O,"CSI:NY continues to amaze its avid followers with the uncanny brilliance of mixing science and criminology. The characters grow and mature as personalities instead of tropes. Gary Sinise remains at the helm, and his trusty associates are Carmine Giovinazzo (in a wheelchair this year after a gunshot wound to the spine), Anna Belknap, autopsy expert Robert Joy, funky A.J. Buckley who adds much of the humor when necessary, the every bright Hill Harper, and the amazingly handsome and trustworthy actor Eddie Cahill. Now Sela Ward has stepped in to attempt to fill the shoes worn for so many seasons (2004 - 2010) by the beautiful and talented Melina Kanakaredes, who is a very much-missed member of the team for many reasons. The scripts remain tight and intelligent and the pacing of the show never misses a beat. This is television series at the highest level. Nice to know it has been picked up for another season. If only Melina Kanakaredes could slip back in from missing persons....Grady Harp, July 12",1342915200,5,1008,4.935294117647059

4607774,5,B0058YPK9O,This episode was well written. I really thought that it was good to bring Claire back in the limbo to talk to Mac about going back after being shot. I loved the scene at the end when Mac went to the crime scene and everyone went up and hugged him. I really liked this episode.,1341878400,,276,4.036363636363636
4607775,4,B0058YPK9O,"This episode of CSI New York is an interesting combination of video games and science a couple of scenes were off
checking game controllers for DNA or prints and Adam playing computer games in the lab  otherwise a good episode",1339200000,,226,4.65
4607776,5,B0058YPK9O,"The 8th Season of CSI:NY returns with only 18 episodes!! Mac Taylor was taking a little time off so Jo Danville filled in for Mac at the time. CSI:NY is one of the most successful shows along with CSI:Las Vegas, and CSI:Miami ever!!",1338940800,,232,4.4186046511627906
4607777,5,B0058YPK9O,"In response to the previous reviewer, DS Thurlow, CSI NY has been renewed for season 9, today,5/13/12. Thank goodness!!! This is my favorite  CSI, not only because  I am a New Yorker,but also for the great cast of actors, so strong & charismatic together. Season 8 was a powerful & wonderful season. Geat scripts, so imaginative. Thank God, for another year of Eddie Cahill-Don Flack and all of them. Keep going CSI NY- WE  LOVE YOU!!!!!",1336867200,3,437,4.723684210526316
4607778,5,B0058YPK9O,"The eighth season of ""CSI: NY"" opens with Detective Mac Taylor (Gary Siniese) absent from the CSI Lab, on a DNA ID project associated with the 9/11 attacks, while Jo Danville (Sela Ward) is acting head of the CSI lab, and newly-promoted police sergeant Danny Messer (Carmine Giovinazzo) is working the streets as a uniformed cop.  However, viewers need have no fear; the CSI Lab crew will be reunited within a few exciting episodes.

An early highlight of the season was a tasteful tribute to the 9/11 anniversary, as the characters discuss where they were when it all happened.  Mac Taylor sheds some light on the fate of his long missing wife, while assisting an emotionally-damaged fellow public servant to face the day.  A mid-season multi-episode thriller involves a case from Jo's past with the FBI, a serial rapist who resurfaces in NYC with disturbing consequences. In late season, Mac Taylor will hestitantly consider a relationship with a woman from his past as a police officer.

""CSI: NY"" continues to provide its exciting blend of case-of-the-week criminal investigation in the unique environment of New York City, while delving into the lives of its characters.  Mac Taylor will have to make a difficult decision on returning to the lab, displacing Jo Danville, who will find an ocassion to tell Mac that she adores him.  Danny Messer runs afoul of Internal Affairs while on the streets, and wonders if he can remain a cop at all.  Detective Don Flack (Eddie Cahill) will try to reconnect with a troubled sister.  Medical examiner Dr. Sid Hammerback (Robert Joy), Detective Lindsey Monroe (Anna Belknap), Detective Sheldon Hawkes (Hill Harper) and lab rat Adam Ross (A.J. Buckley) all get a little time in the spotlight as the season wraps up.  The season finale, a highly effective and moving episode, was filmed before the cast and crew knew they had been renewed for a ninth season.  Highly recommended to ""CSI: NY"" fans.",1319328000,16,1938,4.932307692307693

4607972,2,B0058YPK9O,"The series is really in the downward spiral by this point. Everyone just seems tired and spent. I will admit that the 9-11 intro episode was well done, but as for the rest of the season its just feeling dry and exhausted, with the same level of implausible ridiculousness you've come to expect (a deer hunter in central park(!?) is in a tree, about to shoot, sneezes, throws off the shot and then accidentally kills another guy (!?) who was himself about to be killed by someone else???  Seriously?)  The NDE season finale was ultra-cheesy (and I understand Mac chatting with dead people, but how is he having huggy encounters with living people?)  Well, whatever, the finale was fitting as you can tell the end is getting close here, and I couldn't help but feel that the production felt more and more Hollywood, like we get a bunch of stock footage from NYC but the rest is all filmed in California somewhere. Great series but needs to wrap up soon.",1461110400,,951,4.58235294117647

4608190,5,B0058YPK9O,We started watching CSI NY from the pilot show and it was sometimes right on sometimes not so much. Pretty much like any tv show.  Great actors can take a so so plot and make it at least acceptable.  My husband and I found CSI  NY to be one of the shows that really showcased the actors ability to do just that.  We had watched season 8 when it was on prime time and wanted to see them again.  We are glad that we did.  Lots of little details that we did not catch the first time.,1405900800,,480,3.8969072164948453

4608192,5,B0058YPK9O,"I love this series (CSI:NY) and in my opinion this Season is the best one. It was very powerful to begin the series with the 9/11 disaster. It was also good to put a face to Mac's wife as it helped to understand their relationship and how Mac had to let it go and move on. I love each and every character on the show and feel that Jo has really cemented her place as a dominant member of the cast.

4608246,5,B0058YPK9O,I think that this series did a good job of balancing between the tech-heavy original CSI and the character/style/Horatio driven CSI Miami.  Gary Sinise remains an underrated actor in my opinion.  (See The Stand by Stephen King),1376006400,,227,5.108108108108108

4608506,4,B0058YPK9O,I can't always watch CSI: NY when it is broadcast on TV.  I like the DVD set so I may watch whenever I choose.  I also like taking it to our second home in Canada.  We are in a remote area and only receive 2 channels from the TV.  On those evenings when we would like to watch something  CSI is great.

4608573,1,B0058YPK9O,CBS on a season that marked the 10th anniversary of 911choose to honor it buy using 4.68 GB DVD's instead of Duel Layer for better quality.

4608625,3,B0058YPK9O,"Season 8 has it's flaws creatively, but it is definitely one of the better seasons for sure.

However, the one thing that bothered me about this DVD set was the image quality. Compared to past seasons of CSI:NY and even this year's releases of CSI and CSI:MIAMI, season eight of CSI:NY has a noticeable dip in quality, possibly due to excessive image compression. Some images are blocky (artifacting) and some jagged images (aliasing) appears in some of the action/tracking shots. I know that this problem isn't because of my equipment, as I own (and tested) the other CSI shows and seasons on the same gear with no other problems.

A curious problem to an otherwise great DVD set.

If this sort of thing doesn't bother you (and admittedly, after two episodes or more, your eye adjusts) by all means get the this set; CSI:NY is a wonderful show. However, its image quality does hurt the overall presentation.",1351123200,6,908,4.770700636942675

The cast also makes the show Great. When they picked Sela Ward to step in for Melina Kanakaredes, they picked a Good Actress.
