7864100,1,6304141246,"This film seems promising, but does not go anywhere. There is no story. There are some fights, chases, and shooting, but nothing you have not seen before done much better and with believably. The female assassin is unconvincing; though Lundgren fumbles and bumbles about like a wimp trying to make her look credible. She has a lesbian haircut and wears men's clothes, and thus, is unconvincing as a love-interest seducing Lundgren. Some on-location filming early in the film; leads you to believe the producers cared about making a good movie, but no...; once they signed Lundgren; the producers spent 5-minutes writing a script..",1509235200,,630,5.12621359223301

7864102,3,6304141246,"The film is well done in most respects, setting is a definite plus, very good-looking and appealing feminine interest, typical action scenes, car chases, and the like and a gloss one does not expect from what appears to be a minor (B) movie. I've never heard of the star; of course, never saw him act, and have no prior reason to pick on him. His performance here is really a lead weight cancelling out most of the virtues of film. Too  bad. It has many virtues. If you want to watch a movie late in the evening, when you might want to turn it off and go to bed, this would be a good choice. I can attest to that since it was what I did.
I don't  like to criticise actors when one cannot tell how much of their performance is due to the script or the Director, so I hope this one has gone on to fame and fortune despite this knock.",1376697600,,831,4.060975609756097
7864103,3,6304141246,"I feel bad writing this review, since my less-than-perfect rating mostly reflects my disappointment in having expected a different kind of movie. By most accounts, ""Hidden Target"" is a pretty good film from Dolph Lundgren's early DTV career...if you're looking for a spy thriller. The film is directed by the maker of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Blood/dp/B0004Z33EG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Blood</a>&nbsp;and co-written by one of the scribes behind&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/State-of-Play/dp/B002DU39GW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">State of Play</a>; and contained within a low-budget sphere, the quality is there, but it just doesn't deliver the kind of thrills I want to see from the Swedish Superman. This is definitely a movie you'll have to check out for yourself to get the full gist of it, unless you're looking for a genuine action film like me - then you can save your money.

The story: CIA agent Michael Dane (Lundgren,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Expendables/dp/B002ZG999U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Expendables</a>) is assigned to apprehend the prime suspect in an ambassador's murder (Maruschka Detmers,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mambo-Kings/dp/B0009S4IGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mambo Kings</a>) in Prague and bring her to America, not knowing that he's about to be thrown into a web political intrigue and treachery.

Considering that the film was made for a slim $7 million and as a cooperative effort among five countries, it looks admirably good. There's one embarrassing instance early in the picture where the filmmakers had to fudge a laser pointer, but otherwise, director Ted Kotcheff's capabilities shine through - not only by successfully filming scenes you wouldn't expect to find in a cheap film, but also by making the East European filming location fun to look at. Authentic Czech is spoken throughout, which is pretty nice, and the film maintains a sense of gravity and importance that'd be exceedingly rare in Lundgren's subsequent career.

The movie isn't bereft of action - there's even a piece I particularly like, when Lundgren has a shootout with a sniper while clinging to the ledge of a high building. The problem is that very little of the action is the kind that I like. It's almost all shootouts and car chases, which leaves exceedingly little room for martial arts and fistfights. Lundgren once claimed to have injured himself before he could complete all of the scenes, which might explain the lack of more hand-to-hand action, but it's still disappointing. Additionally, however good the writing might detail the progression of the whodunit-style mystery, I have to take it to point for its truly forced romance between our two leads. Apparently Dolph's charms are so great in this picture that not even a lesbian character can withstand him!

This film was recently re-released in the version you see here, but apparently only to capitalize on Lundgren's recent mainstream resurgence, since there are no special features or anything new about it. For most fans, I'd imagine it's at least worth a look, unless you're on the same page as me and would miss the almost-nonexistent fisticuffs.",1332288000,3,3358,5.975051975051975
7864104,4,6304141246,"Hidden Assassin is one of my favourite Dolph movies. In fact, I visited this website after I realised I could not find my worn out copy...(if you have a suggestion as to where I might have misplaced it, please leave a comment). Since I can see the film has not been reviewed in quite some time, I thought I would contribute my three cents.
Anyway, first things fist:

Things I hate about it:
1) the haircuts (Dolph's and the two female leads') - whoever is responsible, should not be allowed to work in movies again...
2) some parts of the dialog, especially those spoken by the bad guys - too cartoonish...

Things I love about it (other then the fact that Dolph is in it, of course):
1) the setting - Prague is charming, no matter how bad the cinematography
2) the story - there is a love triangle, an assassin, a traitor, two countries on a brink of war; almost like a shakspearean tragedy...almost...Still, the story is far better then anything you would typically associate with a Dolph flick...
3) the low key (read: budget) approach to the chases/special effects - in this case, it actualy makes the entire story much more credible...
4) the two female leads - Detmers and Serna are sexy, each in her own, surprisingly different way (at least to this straight female)...

A four star rating is rather high, but I am awarding it based strictly on the value of other movies in the same genre. This film was never an Oscar contender, but sure did what a good movie was supposed to do: for a while, it pleasantly transported me out of the mundane reality and into the exciting world of spies and heroes.",1243814400,2,1606,4.512027491408935

7864106,3,6304141246,"Some people considered this as a good effort from Lundgren..i still prefer Pentathlon or Joshua Tree better then this one. This film can actually be a good one if it only has the right script..
It's a typical assasination story, where Dolph Lundgren as an american marshall was ordered to apprehend an assasin who want to assasinate a cuban ambassador.  It lack the necessary twist to make it alive..maybe the directing is not sharp enough to capture, or even to elevate the mood.  There are some dialogue and character that felt silly...like the comnmander that likes to boasting around and harassing his man if he consider it necessary to save his image, and well, i don't feel that the dialog wenth smooth...you can just feel it that it was made.  Not alive enough..thus it doesn't shape the character deep enough.  In this kind of movie, If you don't want to play with the character, then you would need to give a good plot on the story...like some 'existensialist' movie in 60's-70's that concern more about what happen instead of the character. The Day of the Jackall is a good example...there is a lot of suspense created from what the jackall did..the viewer is grasp on how the jackall would make his next step. Other good example is the Package..it's a trully high octane thriller and you just get very uptight watching Gene Hackman striving hard to save the president from being shot.
Other thing that annoyed me, the music score.  Is really-really-really improper..it tries to create a fast and tense situation but what happen is you feel that the music doen't really go into the scene, like it was taken from some other movie and forcefully paste into this movie.  It's just not there..
As for the action, Kotcheff did pretty well with a fast paced scene...the fighting scene in the wine cellar, the chasing on the train are good examples,the editing is fast and proper, the angle is just right.  Although not exactly John Mc Tiernan, Kotcheff does have a chemistry on this kind of thing (considering his previous experience in movie such as First Blood, this isn't surprising).  Too bad this chemistry isn't supported with a good script (or a good score for that matter).
Thanks for the proper directing on the action sequence, and the good background of Prague, this movie is still something that is watchable...and that's why i still tend to vote it for 3 star instead of 2.",1058832000,2,2390,4.756038647342995
7864107,4,6304141246,"Dolph decided he wanted to make the transistion from action hero to well respected movie star, so he dedicated himself to acting on broadway in an attempt to relearn his trade, this was his first film afterwards, and you can notice the change, Dolph makes the jump from bare chested shenigans to silk suits and his acting stands him at head and shoulders above the rest , this film has at all, set in the beautiful city of prague, it has great scenery, action scenes(including the traditional groping for a gun, while hanging off the edge of a building), love scenes(dolph manages to turn a lesbian onto men) and great cliches, buy it, you'll love it...",1006905600,5,653,4.637931034482759
7864108,4,6304141246,"This wasn't a bad cardboard  action movie. Plenty of brawls, gun battles, and road chases.  It wasn't a bad plot either. Even if the cardboard action doesn't hold your interest, watching Maruschka Detmers is worth the effort to spend 89 minutes with the film.  Great location scenes. Dolph Lundgren is not Dirty Harry, but he comes off well as a Swedish souped-up Gary Cooper.  I knocked off one star because of the .45. Hitting a bad guy with a .45 at 30+ yards was too much to swallow.",987638400,5,487,4.5
7864109,4,6304141246,This is actually a movie with a decent plot.  Starts out with a bang and keeps on going just like the energizer rabbit.  Lungren plays a US Marshall who goes with his mentor to Eastern Europe to abduct Maruska Detmer and bring her back to the US for trial.  To be honest this movie has a better plot than Mission Impossible but not as flashy.  I first caught it on cable but liked the movie enough to buy it on video tape.,984614400,6,422,4.109756097560975
