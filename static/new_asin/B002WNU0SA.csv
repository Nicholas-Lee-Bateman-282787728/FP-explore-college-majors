8383322,2,B002WNU0SA,"This DVD is not what I was expecting at all. Some Death metal bands are represented but not nearly enough. Too much Black metal for a Death metal Documentary, i just don't see the point of it,You have inerviews from Mayhem,Cradle of Filth among others. No talk about Death or Obituary or any other main bands save for Cannibal Corpse and a little by Immoltion. Very cheaply made too,pass on this one. The short movie also included is a load of very tasteless and stupid crap.",1270512000,5,475,4.534883720930233
