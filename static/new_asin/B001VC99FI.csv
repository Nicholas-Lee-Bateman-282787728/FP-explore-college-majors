8345945,4,B001VC99FI,"The first thing that needs to be pointed out is that this is a CBS production narrated by Dan Rather and as such it presents the story of Desert Storm from the perspective of a news agency and what it considered to be newsworthy events. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Most Americans participated in the events surrounding the conflict by watching on TV. This is a very long documentary that takes various hours to see. In many ways it is very complete. It begins with the issues that started before the war and has a fairly lengthy section on the period between when Iraq invaded Kuwait and the war proper began. There is a lot of footage of important events and interviews with key characters at the time. Once it gets to the part where the war started, you get the impression that there is a lot of re-used footage and repetition of similar themes. One of the things that was very big in the news at the time was the accuracy of the modern weapons that were used and this is a big part of the documentary. Towards the end of the show, there are a number of press conferences by General Schwarzkopf and President Bush that are shown almost in their entirety. Although they are interesting and informative, they sort of bog down the flow of the documentary somewhat. Overall, this is a good documentary if you view it as a documentary of how Americans saw the war on TV.",1329696000,2,1376,4.421259842519685
