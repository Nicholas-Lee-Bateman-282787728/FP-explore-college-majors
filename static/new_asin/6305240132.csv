Pontchartrain Center

New Orleans, Louisiana

This event would host the first ever UFC lightweight tournament. The UFC is picking up momentum steadily. It is becoming more and more accepted in the mainstream at this point. This event is another step in the right direction for the organization that is The Ultimate Fighting Championship.

Mike Burnett vs. Eugenio Tadeu:

This fight is fast-paced and somewhat evenly matched. Burnett, being a Lion's Den fighter, digs deep and eventually takes control of the fight. Tadeu, having a true fighter's will, fights while basically being out on his feet for a few minutes. It is eventually stopped, with the fighter's safety in mind.

Pat Miletich vs. Townsend Saunders:

This is the debut fight in the UFC fot ""The Croatian Sensation"", Pat Miletich, who would obviously go on to UFC stardom. This fight in particular wouldn't go down as one of his best performances, yet Miletich fights a technically sound fight and takes the decision.

Kevin Jackson vs. Jerry Bohlander:

I was somewhat excited to see this fight take place. Both fighters had impressed me with past performances. Jackson had just lost to Frank Shamrock in embarassing fashion after an impressive start to his UFC career. Jackson somewhat controls the fight with his grappling skill. He simply doesn't seem to know how to finish the fight. He is not well-versed in submissions. Guess who is, though? Bohlander trains with Ken Shamrock and the Lion's Den, who specialize in submissions. Jackson and Bohlander go around and around until Bohlander is finally able to secure an armbar. Good fight.

Mikey Burnett withdraws and Pat Miletich fights Chris Brennan. These two fighters have met before, with Miletich winning a hard-earned decision. Miletich had a lengthy fight earlier in the evening and so whether or not fatigue would set in became a factor in this fight. The answer is no.

Kimo vs. Tsuyoshi Kohsaka:

Tank Abbott sits in and gives some guest commentary for this fight. There is some good action early on and Kimo uses his power to control TK. The fight turns into a standing battle late in regulation, giving TK the upper hand. Going into overtime, TK lands two solid knees and wins the overtime round convincingly. It goes to a decision after a hard-fought bout.

Frank Shamrock vs. Igor Zinoviev:

Zinoviev is the Extreme Fighting champion. He comes over to the UFC to take on the middleweight champion, Frank Shamrock. This was probably a bad idea in hindsight. This is an amazing fight for Shamrock and the ending to the fight (coming only 20 seconds into the round) would be on highlight reels for years to come. Spectacular...

This is a very good UFC event. I recommend it to any fan of the UFC or mixed martial arts in general. Very entertaining.",1154044800,,2795,4.917021276595745
7885869,5,6305240132,"Before the last UFC(Japan), folks weren't too familiar with Frank  Shamrock. They knew of him,(mostly being the younger brother of Ken) but  not of his fighting and his skills. After this show we wouldn't learn much  more other than he works quickly.
The show featured a 4-man  lightweight(175lb and below) tournament to crown the first champion of that  weight class. The field was loaded with talent, (Pat Miletich, Townsend  Saunders, Mikey Burnett, and Eugenio Tadeu)and all the participants were  eager to become champ. The fights were fast and furious, many strikes,  lightning quick reversals, and no holding back by any of the fighters. A  truely entertaining tournament, the strongest in many UFC's.
The rest of  the card was comprised of three individual fights. The first bout saw an  interesting battle between Kimo and Tsuyoshi Kosaka. The fight between  these heavyweights would be an intense one with a suprising winner. Fight  number 2 would see an excellent battle between Kevin Jackson and Jerry  Bohlander. This had the makings of a classic, and did it ever deliver. Both  men displayed their strengths in this technical war. I personally thought  this was the best fight, but it was overshadowed by the Main Event. The  Superfight would pit Middleweight Champion Frank Shamrock against the  Extreme Fighting Middleweight Champ Igor Zinoviev. The fight was very  anticipated, and a long battle was expected. In the end a broken  shoulder(Zinoviev) and another fast win for Shamrock. This was the  beginning of more defenses for Shamrock, who was stepping out of big  brother Ken's shadow.",965692800,4,1607,5.171206225680934
