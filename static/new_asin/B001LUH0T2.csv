8319837,4,B001LUH0T2,"The production value is good and the instructor seems friendly enough. Though be warned, even though it's for beginners, you will be hitting that pause button a lot. As that is the only way to keep up. At least that's the case for me.",1472601600,,234,4.340909090909091
8319838,5,B001LUH0T2,"This reviewer is not the most coordinated.  In fact, this reviewer is just barely inching past the absolute total pre-beginner abilities in belly dance.  Finding appropriate choreographies, as you might guess, is incredibly difficult.  I want to be able to learn how these isolated movements can be fit into music.  I want to develop my ear for the beat/melody and how my body can address that beat/melody.  I want to be able to learn something that is challenging enough that I have to work for it, but not so challenging that I feel defeated before I even got started.

Finding Bahaia's 1-2-3 Belly Dance was good fortune in the form of the shiny silver DVD.  As soon as I popped it into my player, I went 'Eureka'.

First things first.  This isn't an instructional DVD - though she does a fine job of introducing the basics of each movement used in the choreography.  Expect to see breakdown of moves for hip slide, shoulder shimmy, hip drops, hip circle, hip push, vertical 8s and mayas; expect to do some simple traveling with these moves including a simple walk side to side, the rocking step, three step turns, and expanded 3 step turns; expect to be introduced to moves (again some with traveling) using the veil  such as flourish,  bolero, toreador, and neck drape.  If it sounds like a lot - it is.  But Bahaia has successfully broken them down to make them available to a beginner.  Each breakdown is followed by a short drill session.

Please note, I didn't say 'simple' in that above last description.  The opportunity to transition the basics into a choreography is that now I notice the importance of form, of foot placement, of loose moves, of drooping hands and non-pointed toes.  Not to mention that boy-oh-boy is it arm work to fling that veil around!  What I love about this dvd. . . it's just going to take practice and I know that I can do it.  In fact, on that note, if you want to avoid re-listening to the same movement explanations while practicing, this DVD includes an section that has cut out the talking to have you just work with each drill, back to back.  It's a nice feature that I would like to see in more DVDs.

And what about the choreography you might ask?  Well, the drill and practice is a true foundation for the choreography which uses many of the previously drilled small combos and music.  It also follows the same basic pattern with Bahaia slowly guiding you through each step with explanation.  Then, you get to follow those steps in time to the music.  The full choreography is broken down into several smaller choreographies so that you can work to your hearts content on each one before combining to perform the entire dance which involves enough repetition to help you develop body/muscle memory for the music and movements but is also divided up  by cute - and dare I say cheeky - accents using the hip drops, slides, etc.

I'm nowhere near completing the choreography.  But I feel I get a good drill practice and I get the opportunity to work towards a real belly dance choreography.  In fact,  Bahaia illustrates the choreography in full costume which is inspiring to someone like me.  This is a DVD that I have already used multiple times.  Without a doubt, I'll use it many more.  For a beginner, this DVD is well worth the price and for a less than coordinated beginner, could be worth its wait in gold.  An intermediate dancer may not find this all that challenging but may enjoy using it as a base to develop a more complex choreography.  I'm looking forward to purchasing her 1-2-3 Drum Solo and will no doubt keep an eye out for future productions by this particular talented artist, dancer, and instructor.",1315008000,4,3667,4.604938271604938
8319839,5,B001LUH0T2,"Great DVD to start with for the beginner or one who has never danced before, and would like to try it out. 1-2-3 Bellydance is exactly as titled, it's very simple, step-by step. Those new to bellydance, will not feel overwhelmed by this choreography. Bahaia combines some basic bellydance movements and basic veil--to create a fun, flirty little dance.

What is covered:

Posture
Warm-Up
Hip Slides
Shoulder Shimmies
Hip Drop
Hip Circle
Hip Push
3 Step Turns
Verticle 8's
Maya
Basic Veilwork-
Flourish
Bolero
Toreador

Posture is thoroughly covered, and very detailed, with lots of visuals & examples.- Including a smart little exercise that helps you get the ""feel""of where your body should be, through weight transfer and balance.

Next is the Warm-Up. The Posture section was covered so well, I was a little let down here. Music starts and she starts moving around, no verbal or screen cues, just ""follow me"" with the music. Though a little confusing at first, after you have watched the dvd a few times, it will be easy to follow.

The next sections that follow give step-by-step instruction of all the movements that will be included in the choreography. Bahaia teaches the complete break-down in detail and then you practice (or drill) the movement.

Then there are the choreography sections. The choreo. is broken into sections and then drilled or practiced. All of this is done with her back to you, while she stands facing a mirror. This is actually what it would be like if you were taking an actual class. I get it, but the mirror they used wasn't big enough and our view of her seems positioned a little too far back. As a result, it was not easy to see what is happening in the front the whole time (especially when she is whipping the veil arround). It was better, when she was teaching facing the camera, like in the break-down sections. Luckily, In the ""extras"" section there is a complete practice section with all these movements shown facing front. So no harm done.

And finally, there is a Full Choreography section that gives you the chance to dance the complete choreo. all the way through. As a really nice bonus, they also included the Full Choreography as a Costumed Performance, so you can see what it would look like at a show.

Bahaia persona seems very sweet & open. She is pleasant, speaks clearly, and moves gracefully. I love that she always has the glamour and poise turned ""on"". She also does a costume change which is nice. And there is an extra live performance of Bahaia that is just exquisite. She is such an amazing dancer & performer....so much fun to watch!

I liked this dvd, and had fun working with it. I would absolutely recommend it. It would be a nice introduction for someone who has never bellydanced and would like to try it out, or a newbie dancer who would like to try a choreography.",1311033600,2,2836,4.667334669338677
8319840,5,B001LUH0T2,"I am very new to belly dance and I have several Belly Dance DVDs. I belly dance for fun and as a fun exercise.  I like thsi DVD becasue it is very instructional.  I also personally like the instructor. This is probably becasue I am a plus sized woman.  Bahaia is a ""thicker"" lady (but not fat by any means). A lot of the moves look differnt on thinner women than they would on me.  So for me it helps to see them performed by a lady who is not super thin.  The instruction is very good and is very basic although it picks up at times.  Great for beginners too.",1294358400,,560,4.0
8319841,5,B001LUH0T2,"This is an excellent DVD, with clear instructions, that can be used by beginners and more advanced dancers. Bahaia starts by introducing the steps she will use in the drum solo, then drills them, and finally puts them all together to make a lovely and easy drum solo. There is also a performance of this drum solo and a bonus performance at the end. I recommend this DVD to dancers who want to learn a drum solo but who can't dance like Sadie.",1238198400,2,443,4.349397590361446
