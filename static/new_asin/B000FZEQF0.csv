8128032,5,B000FZEQF0,It's been a few yrs since I've seen this film but I can still feel its dampness and twilight. While the subject matter is perverse ... it is never depicted in a vulgar manner. I can't put this film into words. There are no American/Chinese/Thai films that evoke a similar mood. This film transformed me and made me love Nippon even more. Director's underrated.,1351814400,3,360,4.640625
8128033,5,B000FZEQF0,"El universo cinematogrfico de Shinya Tsukamato se vuelca de lleno en ""Una serpiente de junio"" donde la sensualidad, la electrnica generadora de cyborgs, erotsmo, paraonia y esquizofrenia dan lugar a una obra compleja llena de atmsfera y suspenso.
Del mismo director de ""Tetsuo, el hombre de hierro"" y con la joven revelacin plena de belleza y sensualidad Asuka Kurosawa.
Una obra de culto ms de su realizador.
Con una trama ms sencilla que el resto su de su filmografa, pero ms efectiva dentro de la generacin de realizadores del llamado Terror Oriental.",1200873600,6,554,5.032608695652174
8128034,4,B000FZEQF0,"Just as twistedly brilliant as Tetsuo, though slightly less hyperkinetic, Tsukamoto's A Snake of June explores similar themes of repressed sexuality and contrasting worlds, but with a far more linear plotline. Though metallic phallus imagery and psychosexual encounters do make an appearance.

When suicide hotline counselor Rinko (Asuka Kurosawa) receives explicit photos of herself from a mysterious caller, she is thrown into a depraved game of hidden fantasies and unrestrained sexual desire. As the voyeuristic stalker becomes determined to alter her passionless life, Rinko's compulsively clean husband Shigehiko (Yuji Koutari) attempts to hunt him down and the three disillusioned soul's paths will inevitably intertwine.

Tsukamoto's visual style is unmistakably daring and A Snake of June is no exception. Bathed in blue to suggest the unrelenting presence of water, the images created are painstakingly crafted and unforgettably bizarre. Close-ups of snails, drains, and circular windows mix with frantic shots of action and nightmarishly surreal dreams pepper reality. Far more linear than some of Tsukamoto's previous efforts, there's still plenty of hallucinatory imagery to comprehend, most memorably the sex show dream sequence accenting the themes of voyeurism and the contrast of viewing the organic through circles. Frenetic editing and dizzying camerawork also strive to keep this thriller from ever slowing down, and even during extended single shots on a stationary subject, the camera refuses to stay put, heightening the sense of voyeurism and paranoia. Even in the chapter breaks Tsukamoto's maddeningly creative artistry is at work as curious symbols denote the passing of time and the gradual joining of figures.

To match the delirious visuals is a fantastically diverse array of sound effects and music from composer Chu Ishikawa. Unending rain echoes in every scene and foreboding strings alternate the mood from morose to morbid, yet there's always a calming satisfaction from the violins. Percussive tribalistic music heavy with the sounds of clanging metal enhances the tense scenes of violence and operatic tones waft through the more surrealistic segments.

With disturbing imagery reminiscent of David Lynch's Eraserhead (but with more meaningful parallels and less unexplained randomness), A Snake of June is a brilliant examination of voyeurism, buried desires, and suppressed passion through the looking glass of a twisted genius. Tsukamoto again proves he is the master of the sadistically surreal and has long since passed his American counterparts in both style and presentation.
