8411648,5,B00402FGKS,"I already owned three of these movies, but had to purchase the collection for ""Lilies of the Field"" which I have been looking to buy for a long while.  Good collection of movies; if you haven't seen them it's a good choice.",1439683200,,223,4.309523809523809
8411649,3,B00402FGKS,"We purchased this set mainly to replace our deteriorating tape of ""Lilies Of The Field"", which is a favorite movie of ours. This particular production turned out just fantastic. We were unfamiliar with ""Arrowsmith"" and ""Made For Each Other"", which I can't really comment on as this was the first we had viewed these movies, but they seemed fine. An added plus for this disc was ""Marty"", which is another favorite. Again, we have the movie on tape and were anticipating being able to replace it. This version, unfortunately, was a great disappointment. A whole series of scenes have been cut having to do with interactions between Clara and her parents. These scenes have a lot to do with the development of the characters and the story-line, so removing them greatly distracts from the enjoyment and understanding of the film. Thumbs up for ""Lilies"", A huge four thumbs down (from the both of us) for ""Marty"", and neutral on the other two.",1436486400,10,939,4.802469135802469

8411652,5,B00402FGKS,"My reason for selecting this product was for the movie: Lilies of the Field. The movie has been a favorite of mine since I was a youngster. I've since shown it to my own son, and it's a favorite of his (as well). A young Sidney Poitier stars the leading role, and is superb. A film that should not be missed merely because it's filmed in B&W.",1409184000,10,342,4.119402985074627
