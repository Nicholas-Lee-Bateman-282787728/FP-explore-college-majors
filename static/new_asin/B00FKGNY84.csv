8616354,5,B00FKGNY84,"Best TV Series ever. Seldom shooting, occasional car chases always a crime or two to solve. This is more about the personalities that make up a small rural village in Yorkshire. The interaction between characters is fantastic. Some you love some you hate, some shows make you laugh some make you cry. All of these people become like friends. I watched this show faithfully for 15 years and I'm now collecting them all to watch again.",1423526400,,433,4.7105263157894735
