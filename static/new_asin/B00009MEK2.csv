1885291,4,B00009MEK2,"Anyone accustomed to the sober atmosphere of science writing will be rather shocked by Nova's treatment of ""The Elegant Universe"". Zany examples, intentional facetiousness and dazzling imagery a serious science discussion does not make. However if you're familiar with Brian Greene's writing style you'll immediately recognize that tounge-in-cheek is par for the course.
Greene's book is at once an intellectual excercise and a lightweight science review, and for that we are all grateful: much of the 19th & 20th century science leading up to the 'discovery' of the String Theories is poorly understood by educated Americans (most definitely including me), and the brushing-up is well deserved. And while some equations are included and some (light) mathematical work required, for the most part Greene realizes that most people will require some help visualizing those things which can never be visualized; quantum mechanics, strings, 11 dimensions.
Which is why it should not come as a suprise to many familiar with his books that the Nova treatment is so lighthearted, or contains so many simplistic visual examples again and again. This new math is inaccesible to most and challenging to the rest, so the eye candy is warranted.
And what eye candy! The visual elements, while at times capricious and overwhelming, are expertly done and do serve to provide further understanding of the subject. The visual effects team at Edgeworx has provided entertaining, educational visual material that should hold up to scrutiny over time.
Greene himself is generally an engaging host. While he has but one on-camera trick (pause, put hands together, glance at floor, then BANG back at the camera), he works it, all the while clearly explaining the subject.
One last thing that can be said about Nova's ""The Elegant Universe"" is that it is =responsible=. There is a large cast of scientists, mathematicians and others on both sides of String Theory. It is continually brought into question as untested, untestable, and possibly dead wrong. The closest to proselytizing that anyone does is to explain that Quantum Physics, the set of mathematical ideas that give extremely good approximations of what happens to sub-atomic particles, has never made an incorrect prediction. Not so with String Theory; no one is willing to say, on-camera, that String Theory is the truth, and in so doing, the piece retains a certain respectful distance from the subject.
Nova's ""The Elegant Universe"" is up-to-date, expertly made and provides a reasonably accessible overview of the various ideas known as String Theory as to be approrpriate for an audience of any age. I would like to live in the alternate universe in which ""Stephen Hawking's Universe"" and ""Nova - The Elegant Universe"" were shown back-to-back to school-age children as a comprehensive introduction to modern cosmological science.",1078444800,259,2874,5.291028446389497
1885292,4,B00009MEK2,"I don't claim to be a master of physics, nor do I have much understanding of the universe at the molecular level, but after watching this DVD I feel I now have a basic understanding of both.  What I enjoyed the most were the historical referrences about those great men who came before and how their theories gradually revealed other avenues of higher thinking.  But this DVD is certainly not for the casual viewer.  My advice for the average citizen (like me) is to put on your thinking-cap before the program begins.  There is plenty of knowledge here that has been proven absolutely that is well worth retaining.  By the end of the program, ""String Theory"" remains just that, a theory.  It is nonetheless an intriguing hypothesis that had me thinking about the fabric of the universe for days afterward.  But I should mention the problems with the actual show.  While there are plenty of visually impressive moments and intellectually stimulating phrases strewn throughout, there is some repetition by the end.  At first, I appreciated the review of the more difficult ideas earlier in the show (including visuals), but later on the statements and theories become second-hand knowledge for those who were paying attention.  Like how radical the ideas are, and how none of the theories may ever be proven, thus reducing the possibility of hard science into unprovable philosophy.  But don't get me wrong, there is a lot of interesting material here to be pondered and discussed with like minds.  But in the end, it still remains theory.  Perhaps it is revolutionary to physicists, but to the common man, until it is proven, it may as well be The Twilight Zone.",1077321600,37,1662,4.851063829787234
1885293,5,B00009MEK2,"Because I loved the program on PBS, it was clear that I would buy the DVD, too. The DVD comes with the audio descriptions that you can turn on: in that case, a woman uses every second of silence to tell us what's going on. She says, for example, ""Brian starts to talk with the other Brian."" The DVD contains 3 hours of the string theory show as well as 5 minutes or so that sketches the events that happened ""behind the scenes"". It is interesting to learn and see how some of the computer effects were created. There are no subtitles, as far as I see.
Well, it has been revealed in the newspapers that more than 3 million U.S. dollars have been spent to create this NOVA show and most of the money went to computer graphics. The story starts in a house in Princeton, New Jersey, the actual house where Einstein spent the last decades of his life. The main task for the actor who plays Einstein is to die, but Brian Greene certainly shows his skills in more difficult contexts!
String theorists continue Einstein's quest for the final theory of the Universe. Strings are vibrating everywhere. Brian Greene jumps from the skyscraper to show how weak gravity is. Identical women playing the cello represent the different versions of string theory, but Brian eventually climbs the ladder to see that there exists one woman (M-theory) only whose image is reflected in five mirrors. A quantum elevator shows how weird physics becomes at the very short distance scales. Five Brians Greenes drink different beverages in the quantum caf where everything is uncertain. Dozens of famous theoretical physicists and Nobel prize winners have their say about string theory, and Steven Weinberg disagrees with the slightly narrow-minded, but nevertheless elegant (and critical) viewpoints of Sheldon Glashow who shared the Nobel prize with Weinberg. Obviously, 1000 words is not enough to describe all interesting points in the show. For us, physicists, it is of course amusing to see so many colleagues of ours.
The show covers a large fraction of the most important moments in the history of physics - Newton's and Maxwell's discoveries, Einstein's relativity theories, and the breakthroughs brought by quantum mechanics. The key ideas of these theories are explained using very amusing video effects.
Nevertheless, the focus is on the incompatibility of quantum mechanics and general relativity, and especially string theory - our hottest candidate for a theory to unify all forces and matter in the Universe. We learn about Gabriele Veneziano whose formula started the whole industry. We also learn from Lenny Susskind - who was among the first people who realized that Veneziano's formula described strings (but he was not the only one, as the show suggests!) - got drunk when his paper was rejected (I guess it was not the only time). :-) John Schwarz and Michael Green work on a theory that none is interested in, but once they discover the anomaly cancellation in 1984, most of the theoretical physics community is taken by storm: the first superstring revolution starts. The different versions of string theory are unified during the second superstring revolution, initiated by Witten (well, this is also a bit simplified picture and the contributions of many other important people are not acknowledged, but 3 hours is clearly not enough to do everything perfectly). The braneworlds (and even the controversial ekpyrotic - born out of fire - Universe) are among the very recent advances that are covered. Brian Greene travels through the wormholes and calls his extraterrestrial friend, living on another brane, who is just watching the Simpsons.
PBS has not forgotten to show the existing as well as the future accelerators that are meant to verify these new ideas - for example to find the superparticles or the extra dimensions. No one tries to pretend that string theory has been proved, and many physicists admit that the theory can be wrong at the end. There are many other fascinating things in the show that make it comparable to the Matrix - except that you will never feel sick if you watch The Elegant Universe.
While this show is a lot of fun, I would still recommend everyone to read the book (""The Elegant Universe"", and perhaps also the very new book by Brian Greene called ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"") because many subtleties just could not be included in the DVD version. The book explains how and why the fundamental things in relativity and quantum mechanics (and string theory, of course) work the way they do, and these things are missing on the DVD. Perhaps, you will be so excited that you will buy a technical textbook about string theory, too.",1076112000,33,4661,4.9012658227848105
1885294,4,B00009MEK2,"I got this DVD set and the box's cover looks exactly like the one sold here.  There is no subtitle and no closed caption for the DVD set, although the spec on Amazon, on the DVD box, and on the DVD's language option screen says there is.  I tried using the TV, and on the PC using  WinDVD and PowerDVD.  Both software can't show the closed caption either.  So am I buying a faulty version of the DVD set? [update: I can see the closed caption if I use the old-style yellow video cable instead of S-video cable or the component video or DVI cable.  But of course the yellow cable isn't great for video quality].

Related is also... I suspect if the closed caption was already created on PBS broadcast, the work it takes to add real DVD subtitle is like one to at most three days?  How come it isn't done for the sake of every viewer in the world?

I need the closed caption because English is my second language.  And especially, all the physics terminologies and names of physicists would need some help of subtitle or closed caption even for the average people.

Update: for some reason, the subtitle won't show using the S-video cable, but using Composite video cable (the most basic one), then the subtitle will show.",1075939200,,1220,4.426008968609866

I watched the entire 3 hour show and liked it so much I bought the book, which is excellent as well. Of course the book is much more informative than the program. It was a Pulitzer Prize Finalist. The show is hosted by the author of the book. It's very high quality programming, like all NOVA's programs. Even if you don't like string theory you will enjoy this. It's an INTRODUCTION to string theory, quantum mechanics, and relativity. We need more high quality science programs like this. It's worth every penny.

1885333,3,B00009MEK2,"""The Elegant Universe"" is a three-part educational video series by Nova from 2003. The series is based on the book ""The Elegant Universe"" by Brian Greene and Brian is the host for each video. So it seems strange that Amazon gave credit to Michael Duff and others when Brian should have been credited first.

The videos included are:

Part 1: Einstein's Dream - 55 minutes
Part 2: String's the Thing - 55 minutes
Part 3: Welcome to the 11th Dimension - 55 minutes

Parts 1 and 2 are provided on the first DVD and Part 3 is provided on a second DVD.

The focus of the series is String Theory (M Theory) and I highly recommend it. It is as much a history lesson about the theory as an introduction to it. In spite of the ""heady"" nature of the subject, it is presented at a level for the novice and is informative and entertaining for the average person.

Sadly, the quality of the video transfer leaves something to be desired. The series was shot in widescreen but I don't know if it was shot in high definition (HD). Every time that I've seen it on an HD PBS channel, it has been broadcast in widescreen---but only in standard definition (SD).

The DVD transfer preserves the widescreen aspect ratio, but it is NOT anamorphic. Therefore, a letterbox format is used which reduces the vertical resolution and gives the videos a grainy appearance. What a waste! This is why I rate it 3 stars instead of 5. If it were available in HD on blu-ray, that is what I would have purchased.

In terms of video quality, Brian Greene's 2011 4-part Nova series ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" is available in 1080i HD on blu-ray. It reuses some of the material from ""The Elegant Universe""---it looks spectacular in HD and is highly recommended (I have a copy of it also). However, ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" takes a broader perspective, making it a good companion but NOT a replacement for ""The Elegant Universe"". Since the latter is not available in HD on blu-ray, we're stuck with these DVDs. Too bad.

Still, the content of ""The Elegant Universe"" is the main thing and I recommend it.",1323129600,8,2066,4.505347593582887
1885334,4,B00009MEK2,"I read Brian Green's The Elegant Universe and bought this NOVA DVD to help further explain certain parts of String and M Theory. The DVD was entertaining and the book was just as good. Either separately would of been sufficient. There are lots of good, pretty artwork on the DVD but the artwork really does not help a lot in String and M Theory explanation, but its entertaining. Learned no new information from the DVD after reading the book. The Nova DVD is a little less dry and may keep a casual String and M theory observer interested longer.

I rate the DVD a 4 star and Brian's book The Elegant Universe  a 3 star. If you prefer watching a movie, plus Brian keeps it a little simpler get the NOVA DVD. If you like reading ( a little harder to understand String and M theory , the 11 dimensions, branes and alternative universes) get the book.

1885336,4,B00009MEK2,"I rarely write reviews, but the amazing discrepancies between the past reviews on this DVD compelled me to write this one, so that the future patrons may not feel as confused as I did when first trying to make a decision based on the reviews.
The most important point is to get your expectations straight: NOVA DVDs are meant for GENERAL public. This doesn't mean that they are for grade school kids or for people who are unable to follow logical reasoning. They are quite useful for people who do not have much knowledge in a certain domain, even though they might have a PhD in another (e.g. a historian who wants an update on what's going on with physics these days).

If you are a physicist or an avocational scholar of physics, are already informed about the fundamentals of the String or M theory and are hoping to get the latest updates, you're obviously in the wrong place. This video is an INTRODUCTION for general public. You should instead read conference papers, journal articles and books. So, I find the low ratings given by this group of viewers to be due to their misguided expectations rather than the low quality of the film.
There were low ratings from a second group, who declared themselves ""lay people"", but thought the DVD was ""void of content"". Although I agree that there is perhaps too much repetition and in some places overuse of special effects (that's simply a matter of taste), it is far from void of content. The film delivers all the fundamental concepts of the theory at the level understandable for a non-academic, in a visually seductive package, which dupes you into thinking it's all so easy! Among these are rather high-level ideas of multiple dimensions, parallel universes, possibility of multiple big bangs, and ultimately convergence of general relativity and nuclear forces into one framework. If you've already had a good grasp on all these concepts, then perhaps you're not as much of a ""lay person"" as you thought you were.

In summary, I think this DVD delivers what it promises: a general, but by no means detailed, account of String theory in a simple and engaging language.

1885340,5,B00009MEK2,"I have all the secrets of infinity in my hands,
i really want to spread it to as many scientists
as possible. so here i go.

here's a simple scientific test you can experiement
with.

wear black clothes and go to a busy mall
you will notice your mind really hurts, this
is because black colors ( or dark colors )
are pulling other humans imagination and bringing
them to close to you and you read it.

this causes stress especially when you are
surrounded by religious people or something.

but when you WEAR WHITE CLOTHES..
the opposite is true, you reject everyones idealogy
and you get to feel free with your own science.

your own imagination is not disturbed.

you can optimize and re-test this if you want.
you can even wax the body hair you have
and dye your hair to yellow or white.

trust me, this is extreme science like no other
and i have it cracked, this can be used to
stop aging, reverse aging,

we can use this to time travel, be immortal
and make money too

because infinity's law suggests the more people
you spread this truth to of, the more money
you are likely to make. ( it's the reward you
get from infinity for giving people the secret )

so tell people to wear white ( be nice, by force
is prohibited by federal law of infinity ).

or just wear white clothes and walk around
shopping malls, you become a role model
and your influence alone will earn you money.

WHITE as you know is a color that pushes
while BLACK is a color that pulls light.

so imagine if you were made up of light
and you were wearing black clothes.

you'd age faster than anyone else.

if you were wearing white, because it pushes
the light back, you could stop yourself
from aging.

try experiementing this with luxury places
because there is a competition going on, on earth.

it's as if everyones soul has some jealousy
inside them and they do not like it when
someone is about to spread the truth and rise
into power.

so keep yourself safe, experienment around
luxury stores where your safety is not jeapordized.

if you are a highly scientific person, try avoiding
conversation with highly religious people.

my own great parents are religious, so i am not
talking to them not even on the phone.

their voice and the way they think can interfier
with my imagination and distort the science
i am working on.

please feel free to ask me for more information
i am on youtube right now

youtube.com/summertimedancings
post comments on my channel i'll respond 24/7
to every question you have.

on my youtube page i found david's video wow
i really want to give this guy all the secrets i have
he can put it into media, become a billionaire
and spark a revolution that can save us all.

i mean all of us, we are all about to become
immortal supreme beings.

all we have to do is wear white clothes
and be obsessed with white stuff.

very simple.

this is no joke, i am about to get this party started

1885341,5,B00009MEK2,"NOVA - The Elegant Universe (2003)- This DVD did a great job of presenting string and membrane theory deserving of a full five stars as well as our attention. My only question is has string theory progressed on the issue of providing some testable new predictions which would prove the existence of strings and membranes? I am rooting for string theorists but at the same time can't turn my back on scientists who point out that physics is an empirical science. Until the string theory community produces some predictions which can be tested in the lab or by telescope, we must reserve some measure of healthy doubt. See Lee Smolin's book THE TROUBLE WITH PHYSICS.

As far as this great DVD production was concerned I can't recall seeing such beautiful animation work on strings, membranes, and the beautiful curvature of space time in close proximity to gravitating bodies. If you look closely at the animation of the moon orbiting the earth as the earth orbits the sun you will see the modest space-time curvature produced by the earth as well as the primary curvature produced by the mass of the sun.

Review of related book by Lee Smolin, THE TROUBLE WITH PHYSICS

I am a mechanical engineer, so my mathematical understanding of physics doesn't go much beyond special relativity, introductory quantum mechanics and just an appreciation for what general relativity has to say about mass telling space how to curve.

Lee Smolins book is written for the lay public as well as physicists and was a very interesting and eye opening read on the great number of string theories which abound. According to Smolins, string theory is very likely just a beautiful mathematical ""bookkeeping"" system which can relate current observations to each other and unify some of the forces of nature.

The author is a onetime string theorist who has since left the field and insists after 30 years there have been no breakthroughs and certainly no predictions of any new particles or phenomena which can be tested. Based on what Smolins is saying it sounds to me like string theory amounts to a multi-dimensional curve fitting spline whose coefficients can be calculated and precisely tuned to rationalize just about everything we already know, but makes no new and testable predictions.

He also says that it scarcely has the needed properties to call it a ""theory of everything"" and that far too much time is being spent on it by too many people caught up in its mathematical beauty and elegance, something he admits it has a great deal of. The idea of subatomic vibrating, open and closed rubber bands being the ultimate component of particles and energy is very appealing to many people.

He also says that the string community spends time calculating these potentially infinite (""fit"" coefficients) universes and the only test of their work is that it fits known prior phenomena. Furthermore, the only critical test a new string theory receives is peer review from a specialized community that is starting to believe that predictions of any new observations are not in the cards and we shouldn't be looking for them anyhow. When we stop requiring a theory to anticipate new observations we are no longer following the scientific method.

Until I read this book I believed, based on my faith in physics, physicists and the scientific method, that string theory was the answer to everything and only required time for it to provide some testable predictions. It has had over 30 years time and research by a disproportionate percent of the physics community. I am now not so certain that it is a valid theory, especially after some of the strongest string theorists are telling us not to look for testable predictions.",1242777600,3,3702,4.902555910543131

Absolutely recommended",1220400000,,828,5.616
1885345,2,B00009MEK2,"I bought this DVD because of an unquenchable interest in Quantum Physics.  As an engineering student who has taken three semesters of undergrad Physics and four semesters of Calculus, I was looking for more information about String Theory.  I thought a NOVA produced documentary would be great because I've been a big fan of NOVA for as long as I can remember.  Unfortunately, I found that this DVD misses the mark for someone looking for some real information and not just a glancing overview.

The DVD is mostly well done, though I find Dr Brian Greene too ""zany"" and informal for my tastes.  From many articles I've read by and about him, he's apparently a leading professor and physicist but has a penchant for being silly.  Nothing against him and those who like him, but that's not really my thing.  I'd much rather just hear an entire program explained by Burt Ovrut personally.

As far as content, I feel like the DVD is lacking.  A lot of really interesting concepts are brought up, and the history behind String Theory is fascinating, but there is absolutely no in depth information explaining anything.  It's as though they're expecting the viewer to just watch and not question or ask for explanation.  A great example is when Dr Greene describes the quantum sized world as ""chaotic"" and unlike the world we typically observe.  Well, why is it?  There was no explanation for why this is, or why it's important.  There was a great CGI scene and background music to evoke the mood, but any real information wasn't there.  Even more frustrating is that they don't describe what String Theory actually is at all.  They keep saying over and over again that String Theory is the idea that all matter is made up of ""little, tiny, vibrating strings"".  Well why is this?  What does this solve for us?  Where did this idea come from?  Why is a vibrating string responsible for all matter in the universe?  The audience, if they're curious, are left dangling to just accept this theory with no explanation at all for why this is so important.  We get flashbacks to the history of the discovery, and then the ""five theories"" problem that mathematically equates to the same equation but in different terms, but absolutely none of the real information beyond a general ""pub explanation"" is shown to the viewer.  It's like they assume the information is too hard to understand and explain, and they're scared they'll bore viewers.  Instead they use ridiculous carnival-themed CGI scenes to explain gravity and black holes...Carl Sagan just used a bed sheet and a basketball in Cosmos.

Now, I do know that the vast majority of those watching this show likely have zero calculus or calculus-based physics under their belt, and that the show is not designed nor written specifically for scientists or physicists.  That's fine, though.  I've seen non-calculus based explanation for physics all the time, and when the information is complete, it's still fascinating.  This DVD just seems incredibly scared to show the audience anything remotely thought provoking (and thusly interesting).  A great example is when the idea of the equations for string theory come out with disparity, and Dr Greene shows this with a ""1+1=2 but 1+1=1"" example.  Please.

I'm not going to say I don't recommend this DVD because those without several semesters of Physics and Calculus under their belt will likely find this DVD interesting and a good casual glance with no equations and is easy to follow.  If you're like me, and interested in the Physics and Calculus of String Theory, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed at the lack of real information because all the information they present won't be new, because you will have already read the ""casual glance"" stuff long ago.

Though not really the same subject matter, I would suggest Cosmos by Carl Sagan over this DVD if you're interested in the Einsteinian theories of Relativity and time travel.  Something about Sagan is just more enjoyable to watch and listen to, at least for me.

If you're the sort who downloads torrents, I'd suggest looking for a BBC production called ""Parallel Universes"".  It's not available for purchase at all, but easy enough to find a torrent for.  It's a one hour program about String Theory, has Burt Ovrut and Michael Duff and others also featured in The Elegant Universe, and even though it doesn't go into any more detail than The Elegant Universe I still enjoy watching it because it's presented in a way that I much prefer.",1219968000,7,4500,4.850589777195282
1885346,5,B00009MEK2,"I am an engineer by education and experience.  Like many engineers I am fascinated with the subject of quantum mechanics, superstrings, hidden dimensions, the quest for the theory of everything, parallel universes and more.  Much of it isn't easy to understand, but it sure is fun!

For years I had been hearing about superstrings.  I have read In Search of Schrdinger's Cat, Schrdinger's Kittens, books on Einstein's theories, and more. I have also read articles on these subjects, watched several amazing TV shows and movies.  Some teased the idea of superstrings, but I never came away with a feeling that the concept had been explained properly.

Brian Green's book the Elegant Universe, and the subsequent PBS show does just that!  It gives the best explanation of superstrings I have read (and seen) to date.  Green also does  a great job explaining parallel universes, hidden dimensions, quest for the ultimate theory and more.

The subject matter in the Elegant Universe is tricky to explain.  Green has to do a balancing act to present the concepts in a way that are easy enough for the educated layman to understand, but complex enough to preserve their richness.

Fortunately, Green does an exceptional job at presenting the material.  And, he does it with great insight, passion and humor!

My head hurt when he talked about some of the concepts such as 12 dimensions instead of the 4 we know about...but it was a good hurt.  Overall a fantastic book and PBS show!

1885354,2,B00009MEK2,"The Elegant Universe is psycho physics - nothing a layperson can use.  It was about the theory of ""everything"".  Einstein tried to develop the theory of everything: gravity, electricity, and magnetism.  However, when looking at the atom and how it is structured, it was discovered there are at least two other forces to unite.  This was the beginning of the string theorists.

Gravity bends space and time. However at atomic level it is not discernible. So the program discusses gravity, the relationship between space and time of Einstein's theory and string theory.  Because the string theory is still untested and untestable, and it may need 20 more years of examination, I wondered why I was watching this several times.  I felt like I was watching a science fiction movie where there are 11 dimensions, parallel universes, time warps, and gravity dispersed to invisible but alternate universes. The visual aid was a loaf of bread where they cut slices of parallel universes we hope to contact some day by ""gravity messages"".

String theory is supposed to close the gap between Einstein's theory of relativity and quantum mechanics through quantum gravity.  There is no way to explain or prove this.  From what I understood, it is merely a mathematical equation.  String theory is proven by math - no direct observations or measurement.

Again, it comes down to gravity.  Quantum gravity is ""The Theory of Everything"".  If it is, I am disappointed. The donut and coffee demonstrations confused me.  Space tears are likened to a bite out of the donut.  The donut's hole and the coffee cup handle are to represent looped gravity.  I was hoping the everything theory would be simple and clear.  No lay person can understand it - it is complicated and hard to visualize. The Nova program presents it like Sesame Street on LSD.

When the big bang theory was discussed I was astounded when it was theorized two big brains hitting together and then the big bang explodes.  It is psychotic - you still don't know where to start!",1192233600,,2024,4.879765395894428

Greene is goofy but for non-scientists like me he simplified everything enough that by disc 2 I was deep in thought, now considering the myriad of images that string theory (and M theory) presented to me, and I was fascinated.  I still am.

Sure it's very simplistic, but that's what I was looking for.  I don't think most physicists need to watch a NOVA special to understand string theory.  The graphics are amazingly complex for a NOVA budget and he injects humor into a lot of it, which makes it easier.  It's hard not to like the guy.

1885359,3,B00009MEK2,"I watched the ""Stephen Hawking's Universe"" series (which introduced String Theory in the last episode) before this program, and one common theme struck me. In the previous program, A String Theorist made a statement to the effects of ""Monkeys are not smart enogh to understand calculus or physics, so maybe humans are not smart enough to understand String Theory"". In this program, Brian Greene went one step further. He was actually shown teaching Einstein's equation to a dog, before finally gave up with the conclusion: ""Dogs are just not smart enough to get it"".

But here's the problem: If String Theory is so advanced that the majority of physicists can't ""get it"", then how can you understand it by watching this TV series?

Answer: You are not supposed to understand it. You just have to BELIEVE it.

""The Elegant Universe"" is made more like a flashy informercial for the purpose of selling/promoting String Theory. It made effective use of movie-grade special effects (Brian jumps off a tall building and lands on his feet, for example) and dazzling computer graphics (such as tiny strings swimming around, swallowing up rips and tears in the universe). It repeatedly mention that Theory of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics cannot co-exist in Black Holes or during the Big Bang, and that only String Theory has the power to unite all forces and explain everything in our universe. Yet by the time you reached the end of this series and look back, you'll realize that nothing new was actually proven using String Theory - not the Black Holes, not the Big Bang, nothing! Even the way it expalins gravity (as a special, closed-loop string that drifts between parallel universes) is extremely clunky. Yet the promise remains to be: ""Some day, String Theory will be able to explain everything"".

Unfortunately, there is not a shred of physical evidence that can prove String Theory is valid outside of its own 11-dimension mathematical space. String Theory claims to be able to explain everything in a self-consistent manner, therefore it can never be proven wrong. On the other hand, it makes no predictions that can be measured in the labs or observed in the stars, therefore it can never be proven right either. It is essentialy a faith-based theory that says ""everything can be explained - if you believe in higher planes of existence"".

So we have to ask: Is String Theory science, or is it religion?

1885362,5,B00009MEK2,"Brian Greene, Prof of Physics and Mathematics at Columbia and PBS NOVA have come together to present the best possible case for the theory of everything using Greene's bestselling ""The Elegant Universe"" as a bases for the presentation.

The Elegant Universe (TEU) the miniseries by PBS ran on the 28th October 2003 in three parts on the science series NOVA. This DVD contains all three one hour episodes. The series starts with classical physics and then moves on to the big controversies in unifying two major disciplines in science, relativity and quantum mechanics. It does this by combining Brian Greene in lecture form with cutting edge computer graphics. The outcome makes this an essential talk on understanding modern thinking for an explanation of the cosmos.

Hour 1: Einstein's Dream
Hour 2: String's The Thing
Hour 3: Welcome to the 11th Dimension

TEU covers the biggest conflicts in physics. String theory becomes a solution. It explains logic of probability in the world and how the standard model (TSM) has come to be (unifying electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force) but without incorporating gravity. Newton is covered with his mechanical physics and Einstein's relativity is easily absorbed.

Quantum topics are the trickiest to understand but TEU the miniseries does a good job of explaining Quantum theory, its mechanisms and how things breakdown when we go further into the quantum world.  This breakdown is resolved in the unification of Einstein's theory of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics through string theory.

The remainder of the miniseries is about how string theory works and what it predicts and where we are in scientifically proving it today (they can't but they have the core math work done). Much like Hawking's approach to educating people about physics, Greene explains it all in layman's terms.

While this is nowhere near as good as Greene's book of the same name it does help to visualize what he is saying and so as a companion is well worth getting but it has greater values other than just as a compliment to his work.

The best thing this miniseries has going for it is the list of superstars in physics who comment on the TOE. These big names include Michael Duff, Brian Green, Michael B. Green, Walter Lewin, Joseph Lykken, Amanda Peet, John Schwarz, Maria Spiropulu, Leonard Susskind, Cumrun Vafa, Gabriele Veneziano, Steven Weinberg and the highly acclaimed Edward Witten who is the real reason for watching this.

The bottom line is that string theory is still highly theoretical and it is even questionable if there are any experiments that exist to show to it but the maths is there for it and the search for the supersymmetry circumstantial proof is underway at CERN. Also if the fact that scientists haven't provided scientific proof of strings isn't bad enough, ST produced not just one TOE but five different ones! It is obvious that the existence of five realities poses the big questions of which of the five is our universe and where are the other four? This problem was eventually resolved by Witten's M-Theory which discovered that the 5 realities were just a reflection of 1 and established the 11 dimensional superstring model that has the ability to become one big large membrane (as big as the universe) and for these various branes to float around as alternative dimensions. However none of this has been verified.

Greene's detractors claim that ST is pseudoscience... and they have a point but what these people don't tell you is that ST is extremely hard to disprove.

 How ST produced a TOE is not mystery. It is not a bunk pseudoscience. A mathematician can reproduce and verify the results of ST without any anomalies and makes some predictions which fit quite well with what we know today (especially with particle spins). Strings are mathematically explained from an equation called the ""Euler-beta function"". Michael Greene and John Schwarz resolved gravity with the quantum mathematically using strings in 1984 after twelve years of work. Strings also explained why known particles have their known masses. It is extremely difficult to ignore the data yet the idea of not being able to observe it is problematic.

The TOE as per ST is solved. Even if we never detect strings somehow, we still have the question of 11 dimensions and how they work. The software is there but it's a highly detailed and complicated one. It runs the hardware but there are all these extra fuctions and buttons that scientists can't explain yet. Quite simply put, ST is a whole lot more than what we need to explain everything! Scientists just don't like that, and right fully so.

For the record Hawking has already stated that this is the course that his work has taken after admitting that information cannot be destroyed [see laws of thermodynamics] nor is it destroyed by a black hole in response to the Hawking Paradox.

Overall TEU suggests one huge powerful thing for everybody and one detrimental thing for modern science. The power of ST is unquestionable. It can do anything and is absolutely logical. ST just needed to unify the principles of physics and it has done its job. The detrimental part is that like the death of classical physics with Einstein, a lot of scientists may be gambling instead of doing things scientifically. If you can't prove it scientifically then it isn't science. Yet again, imagination and experimentation is what science is all about. It is not that we have given ST too much imagination... we probably haven't given it enough as M-theory shows! However when you find out that ploughing nearly all the brain power of new physics grads into it (1 in 10 students choose ST), this is either a very positive thing for ST or a harmful thing for science if it turns out ST was wrong. Still who wants to sit on their laurels with ST waving?

ST feels right... in fact, very right. Baring this in mind it was Carl Sagan who when asked about gut feelings said ""I think with my brain not my stomach"". If ST could replace the gut instinct drive with verifiable experiments then we would know for certain that ST is definitely how the universe works.

Until you see the headlines ""Supersymmetry Found"", taste the very real possibility of knowing everything by watch Nova's The Elegant Universe presented by Brian Greene.

(If you like this I highly recommend Carl Sagan's Cosmos on DVD and for a deeper understanding of physics try finding the 52 parts of The Mechanical Universe series)",1176163200,6,6504,4.897272727272727

I found the biographies of Einstein very well done as well, (only watched them twice).  Even though I am a physician, I have always had an interest in nearly all the ""arts and sciences"" ever since I can remember, and I am also a big science fiction fan as well.  (Got my start at age 10 when I saw the movie, ""2001: a Space Odyssey"".)  I find this DVD set to be so well done that I have bought extra copies as gifts for other people.  It explains fascinating new concepts of how our universe is put together in a very ""user-friendly"" and creative/artistic way, and does it so well that you might just consider taking on a new hobby/career/college degree!!!  A very provocative and inspiring production!  The negative reviews that I read here sound like they come from people who are conceited know-it-alls who like to shove that fact into people's faces, and are NOT giving an accurate and fair representation of this collection of DVDs.

1885365,5,B00009MEK2,"Though I've always been interested in our solar system and universe, I don't have a background in astronomy, physics, or higher mathematics.  In fact, I barely passed math when in college.  That, however, hasn't curbed my curiosity about the mysteries of our known universe.  I just have to stick with books and documentaries that I can comprehend.  The Elegant Universe with host Brian Greene is the perfect documentary for a lay person like me.  Dr. Greene has a way of explaining the most complicated theories and making them simple to the average person.  After watching this very entertaining and knowledgable series, I now have a better grasp of Newton's Theory of Gravity, Einstein's Theory of Relativity, quantum mechanics, and the String Theory.  Don't ask me to write out a mathematical formula.  It won't happen, but at least I now have a limited understanding of the different theories that have made such an enormous impact on our study of the stars.  The one surprising thing that The Elegant Universe showed me is that the majority of scientists appear to be too self-immersed within their own theories and beliefs.  They often refuse to even take a look at a new theory by someone else, until it can actually be proven by experimentation and observation.  My opinion is that what we know about the universe is just the tip of the iceberg.  In the next hundred years all of todays theories may end of being irrelevant and obsolete.  I think that all scientists should be open to new thoughts and opinions about outer space even when they can't be proven at this point in time.  The goal should be to work together in discovering new answers to age-old questions, rather than worrying about who's going to win the next Nobel Prize, or who will be the next Einstein.  We need to get ego out of this and to concentrate more on working with each other to solve the great mysteries.  I have to say that though there's no obvious evident to support the String Theory, it does seem logical to my mind.  I mean everything in the universe is made up of energy.  Why can't there be more than four dimensions, or multiple universes?  Just because we can't see or feel them doesn't mean that they don't exist.  We have to be open to all possibilities.  Though mankind has come a tremendously long ways in the last hundred years, we're still in the infant stage as far as scientific knowledge is concerned.  Think about how vast the universe is.  There has to be a way of travelling to other solar systems and galaxies that far exceeds the speed of light.  The speed of light is simply too slow for space travel.  In my mind, I can't see a universe this large and not being able to travel it.  We just haven't found the solution, yet.  From the tiniest quark and string of energy to the farest galaxy billions of light years away, the old Zen saying still rings true--""As above, so below.""  The Elegant Universe is a must for viewers like me who look at the stars in total awe, knowing that the mind of God is still out of our reach.  Take a fun journey into the cosmos with Brian Greene that's filled with food-for-thought and will have you questioning the theories of today's leading scientists and maybe about life itself.

1885371,5,B00009MEK2,"BRIEFLY STATED - 'THE ELEGANT UNIVERSE' DISTILLS & SIMPLIFIES AN INFINITE TOPIC AND MAKES IT UNDERSTANDABLE

'The Elegant Universe' takes the 'THEORY OF EVERYTHING' as it has been recently popularized into, and distills it down to something simple enough for anyone to understand. On the minus side, it takes three hours of going through the same subject matter before we get the entire overall picture.

There are those that can absorb this material faster and deeper than others. For those people, this video may seem a little watered down. Having said that, 'The Elegant Universe' provides the broadest possible audience with an overview that does help to make sense out of a very complex and controversial theory in Physics.

'THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING' - BUILDING ON EINSTEIN'S THEORY OF GENERAL RELATIVITY

Einstein's 'General Theory of Relativity' explained the laws of large objects like planets and suns, but was useless in the field of 'Quantum Mechanics'. This 'Theory of Everything' or 'String Theory' tries to make Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity not only co-exist, but come together synergistically to aid in explaining much of what still remains a mystery in the physical world.

HOW THIS NOVA VIDEO PRESENTS THE SUBJECT - -

Very clever animated examples and analogies truly help to maintain viewer interest and help to advance the viewers' grasp of the 'Theory of Everything' as only a video can. It is a simple presentation, too simple for some, and too long for others. Nevertheless, almost everyone that could possibly understand this topic will grasp it after they watch this video attentively. In this way, the Nova video presentation brings a vast and complex theory in Physics to the broadest possible audience in a manner that is most comprehensible and entertaining.

OVERALL - THIS NOVA VIDEO HAS ME WANTING TO READ 'THE ELEGANT UNIVERSE', BY BRIAN GREENE

Brian Greene, Professor of Physics and Mathematics at Columbia University has written a best-selling book, about the Theory of Everything, titled, 'The Elegant Universe', which I have been anxious to read since viewing this video last year.",1160870400,11,2132,5.1773255813953485
1885372,4,B00009MEK2,"I liked this very much, the book gets into greater detail BUT that made it harder for me to get through! Some facts are over-whelming and I had to read many pages over. If you are more visual get this over the book. The visuals help you grasp the concepts better, and Brian Green's humor keeps things light. If your appetite has been sparked by this, THEN get the book. If you don't buy into the String Theory or are familiar with space and wormhole concepts, I think you would view this as a ""beginners"" set. As far as any conclusions, nothing is proven. Just like global-warming, some experts say this and some say that...who's right? Green explores Einsteins work but really...what did that high school drop-out Einstein know anyway? ;-)",1156636800,9,740,4.656488549618321

While many scholars might hesitate to expound some of the concepts as confidently as presented here as fact, credit must still be given for presenting these theories in ways that most audiences will be able to grasp.  Visually, I don't think it could have been better, and it's the liberal use of computer graphics that simplifies comprehension for the viewer.

There was little to no useful information & constant repetition of the same interview pieces, historical perspectives & even the exact graphics throughout all 3 programs. I have no more knowledge of any facts behind String Theory than I did before. At best this could have been one glitzy & mostly pointless program .. instead, NOVA gave us 3 full hours that said the same things over & over & over again. With Brian Greene trying his best to be the second coming of Carl Sagan & failing miserably. Clearly a case of the producers stretching out limited content to fill 3 commercial time slots. I expected so much more & will look deeper next time before I buy.",1150675200,19,707,4.574803149606299
1885378,5,B00009MEK2,"For me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is the book that started it all. Then came the video with its vivid graphics and a more expansive look at the future of strings theory, and the concept lept from the page and into my living room.
Greene has an astoundingly smooth manner of easing the novice into the complexities of string theory, the reader feels almost acquainted by the time the science is introduced. Never boring or tedious, Greene deftly guides us through the basics of relativity, explains the importance of frames of reference, and eases us into the almost magical world of gravity and timespace.
Like Einstein, Greene presents the science through simple visuals - balls and bicycles, donuts, slices of toast and wormhole traveling cabs. The reader will never feel as though he sits in a classroom with a boring professor droning away the afternoon. Instead, Greene describes the physics in a real world way and in doing so, prepares even the most casual student for the truly strange world of strings. It was that way in printed form and the video brings it to a new level. Rather than repeat the lessons from the book, ""The Elegant Universe"" on DVD only enhances the malleability the science.
String theory appears to be the road to a unified theory, the long sought Theory of Everything that will unite relativity and quantum mechanics. Along the way is a wonderous world of possibilities, with extra dimensions, parallel worlds, and all the while, tiny strings vibrating the symphony of the universe.
I read this book with a zeal normally reserved for action novels. Each night was a new lesson and a new glimpse at a different part of the universe. Greene's gift is a clear and friendly writing style that makes this heavy science accessible to those of us without a string of initials at the end of our name.
Many physicists came before Greene and others have followed suit. But for me, ""The Elegant Universe"" is what opened my eyes to the mind blowing world of strings and the possibilities they present. And I've been hooked on string theory since. I recommend this video to anyone who has thought to read the book but never felt up to it. Both are recommended to anyone who had ever looked at a sky full of stars and wondered what it's all about.",1146182400,8,2261,4.712121212121212

However, a person who is not somewhat familiar with these concepts may be completely blown away and may have a hard time believing let alone understanding them. I have read many books relating to the material so it painted a much clearer picture of what I already know. With that said, I recommend this DVD to anyone who has ever questioned the laws governing the existence of everyday natural phonomena as well as the existence of the universe itself, or just curious about physics in general.

1885381,3,B00009MEK2,"The January 13, 2004 spotlight review hits the target, where the other reviews don't.  There are problems with this video.  I don't want to keep being told that this is ""a theory of everything"".  It all comes off as so glib and empty.  It's a stupid meaningless phrase to me.  Where's the beef?

I'm left with the impression that the creators of this video decided that string theory is just way too complicated for anyone to understand, so the best they can do is treat us like babies and coo at us ""this is a theory of EVERYTHING, isn't that great, kiddies?""

My response being - what the hell are you talking about?

And maybe they are right.  Maybe it is too complicated for me to understand.  One thing is for sure.  It is too complicated for me to understand if I don't get a comprehensible explanation of it.  But then again, so is a tricycle.

Let me bring it down to earth for you.  They say that string theory requires 11 dimensions.  Why?  Am I allowed to ask why?  Can you give me a clue as to why the math requires 11 dimensions?  Can you at least try?

Things seem awfully complicated, and I'm sure they are, but in my experience it all depends on who the teacher is.  I'm thinking that a really great teacher can explain to a layman why the math requires 11 dimensions.  A lot of thinkers are like chess players, their heads way off somewhere, reaching for ideas from all over the place, and it's hard to follow their communication because it is so specialized and removed.  But there is such a thing as a great teacher.

Put it this way.  Give me a high school student who is utterly lost in his math classes.  After one lesson I can turn him into an A student.  I've done it just that way.  Kids came to me failing math, and after one or two lessons they walk away full of confidence that they understand the stuff, and they get 100s on their tests.

It's just a question of building the foundation for them, starting with what they know and are comfortable with, and showing how the rest falls neatly into place, well within their comfort zone.

So I was hoping for a nice clear explanation of the whys of string theory, from someone who is as good an explainer as I am.  Instead, for the most part all I got from this video was ""Hey, kids, this is a theory of Everything, whoooo, ain't that fun?""

It is easy to explain the history of the development of the theory.  But who cares.  The point is the theory itself.

When I sat in on college lectures, regardless of the topic, I had the reaction that it would be a lot better if I could interrupt the lecture and ask questions rather than just sit there listening to the meanderings of this guy's brain.  I could direct the lecture into areas that I felt were more worthwhile and interesting, and shut him up when he's boring or annoying me.

Anyway, it's always nice to learn something.  When I was six years old my mind was photographic.  I can still remember every lyric to every song I liked on the radio from back then.  Now, I can't remember any song lyrics from the past few decades.  That is because all the slots in my brain have been taken up, there aren't any more, and I'd have to free up a few to cram some more things in there.

It would be nice to be able to buy an add-on, a plug-in.  Then I'd be able to learn something new.  While I'm at it, I'd like to buy an additional stomach so I can eat whatever I want and have somewhere to put it without blowing up like a balloon.

Later - I've just seen the material on disk two, and there is more meat on it than the prior material, so I have no complaints with it.  The one point I agree with most is that 100 years from now the theory will have a lot more to it than it does today, and our knowledge, as it exists today, will appear quaint by comparison.",1142035200,10,3786,4.218967921896792

THE ELEGANT UNIVERSE AND BEYOND is a compliation of three different NOVA programs that have already aired. They are listed below with synopses on each one:

1) The Elegant Universe (WG36779)

Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory Join host Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and the best-selling author of The Elegant Universe, for an in-depth exploration of the groundbreaking new string theory that will excite scientists and non-scientists alike. If string theory proves correct, the universe we see obscures a reality that is far richer and more complex than anyone ever imagined--a universe with numerous hidden dimensions, a universe in which the fabric of space can rip and tear, a universe that may be but one of many parallel universes

2) Einstein's Big Idea (WG38889)

Everyone's heard of it, but what does E=mc2 really mean? With brilliant period recreations, discover how an obscure patent clerk, Albert Einstein, came up with his shattering 1905 discovery that the realms of matter and energy are inescapably linked. Starring Aidan McArdle (Ella

Enchanted) as Einstein, and Shirley Henderson (Bridget Jones's Diary) as Einstein's first wife, Mileva Maric.

3) Einstein Revealed (WG26479)

Journey into the mind of a genius in this penetrating profile of the world's most renowned physicist, who contributed more than any other to our modern vision of physical reality. Andrew Sachs (Fawlty Towers) stars as Albert Einstein.

Such learning experiences are not only enlightening but highly entertaining and excite my imagination.  Sadly, The Elegant Universe is not one of these programs.

Instead of treating its audience with a bit of respect, it continually talks down to the viewer by repeating things over and over again.  Not only do we have to endure the non-stop flashy CGI graphics that explain nothing, but the basic principles of string theory are not even explained fully.  Sure we're told how wonderous and strange it is (multiple times) and we learn a bit about how the theory came to be as well as those scientists whos ideas helped germinate it, but somehow the basic principles of the theory are glossed over.  It's as if the producers of this DVD have decided that we're all to dumb to understand it or something, so they'll just amaze us with cool graphics and statement after repeated statement about how cool the theory is.  Sorry, but that just doens't cut it.  I except much more from a show with a history such as Nova.

One of the biggest unification study is String Theory is covered in this documentary. String theory says that the universe is made of tiny vibrating strings and we need extra dimensions for explaining this theory. Also little bit information about M theory is given.

It seemed like every other sentence was some variation on ""String theory says that the universe is made of tiny vibrating strings."" That's a good start, but when it's the only direct fact presented over the course of a three-hour series, we've got problems. I thought my DVD was skipping.

1885399,5,B00009MEK2,"How many of us have only vague ideas about General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, and the evolution of the string theories?  How about the M theory?  How many can handle the math required to really get into these subjects?

I'm a collage graduate with degrees in chemistry, and I know very little about most of the concepts mentioned above.  Anyone who has not taken advanced level courses in chemistry or physics probably understands less than I, if that's possible.  I was therefore extremely grateful to find such a great tool as Brian Green's Elegant Universe to help me gain a basic knowledge of some of these things.

Greene does a splendid job of teaching the basics of these concepts to those of us who lack the tools to really grasp them.  He uses as teaching aids the formidable computer technology possessed by the makers of the Nova science series.  Nova produces some of the best scientific material to be found on television or on VHS and DVD.  The computer illustrations in the Elegant Universe DVD are amazing, and Brian Greene is personable, funny, and very good at making complex subjects understandable to people with weak scientific backgrounds.

Greene goes back to some of the great scientists like Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein, who, while they of course made some mistakes, worked miracles with the knowledge upon which they had to build.  Once the audience has been exposed--in a very entertaining way--to Newtonian and Einsteinian physics, he or she is introduced to Bohr and the extremely counter-intuitive science of quantum mechanics.  Such concepts as electro-magnetism and gravity are introduced and discussed along the way, and brilliant examples and computer illustrations are used to help the viewer gain a real if basic understanding of these subjects.

Later in the program Greene takes the viewer into the string theories, and how they tie into the theories of Einstein, Bohr, and other earlier researchers.  By the end of the bonus DVD that comes with the set, the layman is familiar with string theory, and the concepts of 11 deminsions, the M theory, ""branes"", and multiple universes.  There is even some speculation concerning the relationship between strings and the Big Bang.  The viewer comes away with a much better and more thorough understanding of modern theoretical physics than he or she probably had before watching Elegant Universe.

No one tries to tell the viewer that these concepts are written-in-stone truth.  Greene and some of the world's most brilliant physicists, who appear as guest commentators in the program, make it quite clear that the string theory and everything associated with it could be completely wrong.  They do explain that the small amount of evidence we have suggests that at least parts of the theory may represent reality, however.  The whole presentation is commendably objective and honest.  There are--oh how refreshing--no hidden agendas that I could detect.

There are at least two very important talents needed in the field of academics--the brilliance to understand complex concepts, and the ability to communicate and explain those concepts in a way that they can be grasped by the non-expert.  If one majors in science in a college or university, he'll almost certainly come into contact with brilliant scientists who cannot teach very well.  If she's lucky, the student will also probably come to know some great and gifted teachers who lack the ability to be great scientists or reasearchers.  A few professors possess both talents in great abundance, but they are quite rare.  Both talents are essential in an institution of higher education, if that institution is going to fulfill its purpose.

I don't know to what depth Mr. Greene's understanding goes, as I lack the expertise to judge that.  I do know, however, that he is a gifted writer and teacher, and as such, he provides an important service to his viewers and students.  Just as importantly, he presents these things in such an affable and entertaining way, that the program is rendered more entertaining then all but the best fiction.  The three-hour program--really two one and a half hour programs--goes by very quickly, leaving the viewer wishing for more.

I'm glad Greene has seen fit to write his books and to participate in such great programs.  I highly recommend the DVD set, Elegant Universe.  I am ordering the book as I suspect that it will go into detail impossible on the DVD.  Greene's contributiion is particularly valuable to those of us who are less than astute in math and the physical sciences.",1121558400,9,4576,5.025198938992043

If you are looking to get a gist of what string theory is broadly about, then this could be a good buy. But if you are looking for something with more substance, this will disappoint you. More effort is made on emphasizing special effects & how cool string theory is as opposed to understanding the science behind it.

If you are looking for something with more substance, I would recommend the following dvds:

1885406,5,B00009MEK2,"From the earliest humans to walk upon this planet, mankind has contemplated not only his own origins, but the origins of the Universe in which this planet all the stars are a part.  Mankind's first attempts at explaining these questions involved various mythologies that often placed the Earth and mankind at the center of the Universe.  This included the works of the ancient Greek philosophers Ptolemy and Aristotle, which were then incorporated into early Christian beliefs.  However, this naive geocentric view began to give way in the 16th century C.E. when the heliocentric model of Copernicus and Galileo became known.  Sadly, the Catholic Church imprisoned Galileo for his views, but Johannes Kepler later confirmed the heliocentric model mathematically.  Then, Isaac Newton (1642-1727) made the remarkable imaginable stretch that the same force that makes things fall to the Earth, gravity, is the same force that keeps the moon in its orbit, as well as the other planets in orbit around the Sun.  Newton's laws of motion and gravity became the cornerstone of physics for the next 200 years, but then another force was discovered: electromagnetism, which was realized to be the combination of the electric and magnetic forces as theorized by nineteenth-century physicist James Maxwell.

It was then early in the twentieth century when the brilliant Albert Einstein turned physics and man's understanding of the Universe first with his Special Theory of Relativity and later with his General Theory of Relativity, which demonstrated that gravity is the result of the curvature of 4-dimensional space-time.  Physics was also turned upside down with the discovery that atoms are not the hard bits of matter that everyone had once thought that they were.  Instead, as demonstrated by Einstein's contemporary Niels Bohr, atoms and the electrons that orbit them cannot be explained by simple Newtonian mathematics.  Instead, they can only be understood by the very complex and probabilistic quantum theory.  Though Einstein did not agree with quantum theory, he spent the remainder of his life trying to unify gravity with the much more powerful electromagnetic force.  Unfortunately, he could not succeed because quantum theory (the theory of the very small) and general relativity (the theory of the very large) are incompatible; but the dream of unification was resurrected in the 1970's when a rarely-used mathematical theory was suddenly realized to hold the key for what early proponents termed string theory.  If string theory is true, then all matter (all particles) and energy in the universe are nothing more than strings vibrating at specific frequencies and amplitudes and within never-before-seen extra spatial dimensions.  Initially, string theory fell on deaf ears within the scientific community, but when proponents were able to solve some of its extremely complex 10-dimensional mathematics, the scientific community quickly took notice.  However, fanfare again died when not just one, but five separate 10-dimensional string theories came into being.  When it seemed as though string theory was headed into oblivion, another physicist, Edward Witten, proposed an 11-dimensional superstring theory which encompassed the previous 5 10-dimensional theories and string theory was alive again.

In the 2003 PBS-produced series ""Nova"", the three-part episode ""The Elegant Universe"" is hosted by the well-known physicist and string theory proponent Brian Greene.  Though a very complicated subject for the lay person, Mr. Greene does a superlative job of explaining the history of physics and the development of string theory (as summarized above) using language, analogies and computer graphics that most people can probably understand.  The series is based upon Mr. Greene's 1999 book ""The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory"".  Overall, I rate the PBS-produced, three-part ""Nova"" episode ""The Elegant Universe"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone interested in understanding the origins of the Universe and ourselves.",1110672000,13,4120,5.499207606973059

1885408,5,B00009MEK2,"Although a science aficionado, I will admit that I knew precious little about String theory prior to seeing this documentary.  In many science books it was always an idea that would be referenced, but not really explained.  The theory was briefly examined in STEPHEN HAWKING'S UNIVERSE, but that documentary didn't go into a whole lot of depth as it was one of many theories cited.

After viewing THE ELEGANT UNIVERSE, it is perhaps fair to say I still don't know a whole lot about String theory.  However, I DO understand it much better than I did.  And, it's not so bad to admit one's ignorance when it comes to String as even the greatest physicists in the world are compelled to admit their limitations in mastering the theory.  Timothy Ferris of the university of California, Berkeley once said it best when he compared physicists trying to comprehend String theory to the Wright brothers attempting to fly a B2 Bomber.

Brian Greene of Columbia university is the guide on this journey, and the DVD is based on his book by the same name.  While I own the book as well, it's still sitting on my bookshelf, waiting to be read.  In Saganesque ways, Greene does a good job of invoking common & everyday things in explaining what is perhaps the single most complicated scientific theory ever devised by man.

Greene glosses over the realm of theoretical physics as well as Einstein's theory of Relativity.  However, he does so primarily with the efficacy of demonstrating  how both domains of physics relate to String theory.  People who are interested in inquiring into either quantum mechanics or Relativity exclusively would do well to check out other science documentaries.

On the topic of String theory, however, I don't know of another inquiry that can compete with this one.  Greene summons some of the best physicists in the world to assist in the quest; names such as Stephen Weinberg, Ed Witten and Alan Guth.

If you have a curious mind about science, this is an almost must-have DVD.  While some of the notions presented are radical (if not totally out in left field?) the ideas are nevertheless worth pondering.  To their credit, the scientists interviewed many times go to great lengths to expatiate that the whole theory maybe dead wrong.  At present we may not have the technology necessary to determine as much.

In the interim may we and our future generations continue to test String theory and constantly apply the concept of Occham's Razor whenever necessary.

This program is based on the best-selling book ""The Elegant Universe"" (2000) by Dr. Brian Greene (of Columbia University) and is hosted by Greene as well.

This program, originally shown on PBS's ""NOVA"" television series, is in three one-hour parts.  Below I shall state the title and what I see as highlights of each part:

(1) Einstein's Dream

Isaac Newton; his theory of gravity; James Clerk Maxwell; his theory of electomagnetism; Albert Einstein; his theory of General Relativity; the telegraph; unification; Niels Bohr; Quantum Mechanics; parallel universes; strong and weak nuclear force; nuclear bomb; black holes; string theory (technically called superstring theory).

(2) String's the Thing

Big Bang, unification; the world of quantum mechanics; how relativity and quantum mechanics differ; the brief history of string theory; what string theory is and how it works; particle physics; the ""standard model,"" graviton; mathematical anomalies; extra spatial dimensions; the five types of string theory.

(3) Welcome to the Eleventh Dimension

string theory explained; wormholes; the tearing of the fabric of space; extra spatial dimensions; parallel universes; ""M"" theory; ""the greatest living physicist,"" ""branes;"" eleven dimensions; closed-end vs open-end strings; Big Bang; the creation of the universe by branes; the ""riddle of the Big Bang;"" how to test string theory?; graviton; supersymmetry; sparticles; ""Could string theory in the end be wrong?""

Now that you know the contents of each part, why should you bother viewing this program?  In other words, why is string theory so important?  The answer is provided by Greene.  He explains that the goal of string theory is ""to unify our understanding of everything, from the birth of the universe to the majestic swirl of galaxies in just one set of principles -- one master equation.""

I read the above book first before I viewed this program.  The book is much more detailed.  However, the program has two major features that the book does not:

(1) Brief commentary from many theoretical physicists (those mainly from the US but I noted one from the UK and one from Canada).
(2) Fantastic moving graphics that illuminate the theories discussed thus making them more comprehensible.

Some people see this program as too simplistic and meant for children.  They also see it as being too repetitive.  I disagree on both counts.  Considering the amount of material Greene has to present without any mathematics, I think he does an excellent job.  If there was no repetition, the viewer would easily get lost.

As I said above, I read the book first on which this program is based.  This is not necessary.  You can simply view the program only.  But remember that if you do this, you will get only important highlights of the book.  I think the best thing to do is view this program first and then read the book.

The DVD extras or ""features"" are worth exploring.  I found them interesting.

Finally, the only minor problem I had was that each one-hour part is preceded by the same NOVA commercials and the same summary of the entire program.  Once I saw this for the first time before the first part began, I simply fast-forwarded when I came to these for the second and third part.

In conclusion, this is a fascinating program that explores a promising new theory called String Theory!!

This programming is intended to spark an intrest in those who have never heard of string theory and run from the hazy world of quantum.  This program is about as effective as it can possibly be for a broad overview of a subject that can not easily be explained in a broad manner.  If you are new to the ideas of quantum or string theory, this may help encourage you to learn more.

1885413,5,B00009MEK2,"I started this video expecting to be confused and turn it off within the first 10 minutes.  An hour and a half later I blink my eyes forcibly as the credits go by, blown away by equal parts of information and surprise of actually being able to understand the information.  I majored in computer science and math in college, so I have a natural attraction to science films like this, but, before watching this video, string theory was lumped into a very large category of things I don't have the background to understand and would do nothing but give me a headache.  Greene's narration was so overly animated it came off rather cheesy to me, but this isn't even worth mentioning compared to the quality of the presentation of information and the use of visuals throughout the video.  The video gives an animated portrayal of everything that is being said, and (my favorite aspect, but which few science videos use) gives periodic synopses of all the information that's been presented in the video up to that point.  I'm guessing these recaps were intended to act as refreshers to follow commercials, but they were a welcome transition even without commercial interruptions in my opinion.  The recaps allow the information to solidify in the brain before being bombarded with another aspect of this perplexing subject.  I was so excited about what I had learned, that I set out to start explaining it to family members before the credits had even finished.

Any human with patients can read a dictionary and unless an idividual has the I.Q. of a breakfast sausage, most people should figure out how to use the words.)

As a matter of fact, it goes beyond Cosmos, since it deals with unification of the basic laws of the universe on both the scale of the very large (general relativity) and the very small (quantum theory) by use of string theory- actually ""M"" theory (the M stands for Magic, Mystery, or Matrix- take your pick.)

 Now, I had a rudimentary understanding of general relativity, and a shaky understanding of quantum physics, but even though I had heard of string theory for the last 20 years, I really had no clear idea of what it was all about. This documentary cleared it up for me- I at least have an inkling of what all the excitement is about. I feel like I did as a boy when I had the folding of space graphically explained to me with a sheet of paper. This truly is mind-expanding stuff.

 I remember once hearing that if you couldn't explain the basic idea of a theory to a layman in a short paragraph, then your theory was probably humbug. Well, this presentation explains things clearly, with minimal repetition, in a manner just about anyone can understand. First of all, the fundamental particles that make up everything in the universe are made up of tiny strings of vibrating energy. These strings are a billion, billion times smaller than an atom. It is their vibrational frequency (in 11 dimensions) that determines whether they appear to us as photons, electrons, or whatever. Now after this it gets a little complicated with parallel universes, super symmetry, and dimensional membranes in the ""bulk"" of the multidimensional totality of existence- but that is where the excellent computer generated illustrations prove so useful.

 Now that I've seen this program I always turn to the science section of the local paper first to see if they have finally come up with experimental verification of the theory (like the detection of those closed-ring gravitons.)

 The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that the special features are really DVD-ROM special features. I was really looking forward to the interactive Multidimensional Math activity- but it crashed my PC and now I can't get it to recognize my D drive. And I almost never have crashes or software problems....",1091404800,11,2331,4.724137931034483
1885421,3,B00009MEK2,"Starts great, goes into endless repetition. The whole frame of reference is silly and boring: the great man view of history, no explanation necessary of their feats, all build up, no beef. Most of the hard questions here are ultimately ducked or served cold. The buildup to the genius coming in and solving the five models problem was so drawn out I thought the show had looped back on itself. And then the genius' conclusion is that the five models are all reflections of one reality. Ah, I see.... Hello? Are we that dumb? If so, why are we watching? A little more detail please.",1089504000,5,581,4.542857142857143
1885422,1,B00009MEK2,"{APOLOGIA:  A review as damning as what follows will inevitably seem hyperbolic and unkind.  Yet ""The Elegant Universe"" is such a singular case, and egregious misexample to both the science-documentary profession and public, that I have only said here what was accurate, condign, and the duty of any conscientious, technically knowledgeable commentator.}
What a vapid production!  Terribly, almost moronically, edited, taking forever to say anything, endlessly repetitious.  Narcissistic.  Precision and key details missing everywhere.  No profound development of ideas.  Images and props constantly get in the way of meaning and exposition, and most of what IS said will surely already be known to the majority of the literate public.
Ironically, ""The Elegant Universe"" is the least elegant of science productions.  It could be skillfully cut to a third or a fourth of its present length without substantive, persuasive, or artistic loss, but much dramatic gain.
Absurd platitudes fairly trip over one another's feet.  Why is Isaac Newton supposed to be the ""greatest scientist of all time""?  In point of fact, he is a most unlikely choice.
This is the worst science film I have ever seen as a scientist, at least for its length and melodramatic ambition.  Although kindergartners might like it.  Certainly the ingenious visual and musical simulation of the jittering Dirac vacuum is magnificent!
With respect to superstring theory itself, this supposed documentary is more like an advertisement than an honest examination of what to date remains a charming but sterile scientific theory, a theory that could easily be joined by a thousand other ideas, neither less nor more plausible, on the same shallow pond of data, where they could all figure skate together.  A scientific theory never ""proclaims"" anything about the universe; only its exponents - physicist Greene, in this instance - can be guilty of THAT.
Although I found much to enjoy, and more than a little enlightenment, in Brian Greene's superb book of the same title years ago, and strongly recommended its purchase to sophisticated lay friends, in this extraordinarily bathetic television tutorial there is little or no trace of his expository genius and style.  I am afraid that in the making of this program the youthful Prof. Greene allowed himself to be badly misused by his handlers.
The universe is not a cartoon, and science - as publicly understood and professionally pursued - can only be degraded and perverted by such undignified, unintellectual drivel.
Final impression:  Revolting!  Literally an embarrassment to watch.",1087689600,28,2598,5.330882352941177
1885423,4,B00009MEK2,"The whole concept of the string theory is fascinating. If this theory holds true, and is ever provable, it will be like the DNA of all life.
'The Elegant Universe' offers an interesting collection of perspectives. All in all it's quite credible, even though they're talking on a subject where many assumptions have to be made. But the fact that our species can even talk about it is something to think about. We're kind of like the mirrors and instruments revealing the inner hidden side that cannot be revealed except through the human experience of mind and senses. That alone is fascinating to me.
I agree that this dvd is sometimes on a grade school level in its delivery. One perspective could be that it loses some credibility because of this approach. But then again, the complexity and technical aspect could easily overwhelm the viewer, so some comic relief might help us keep our attention peeked. I highly recommend this dvd along with 'Stephen Hawking's Universe."" I very much look forward to future dvd's on this subject.",1087171200,16,1034,4.8474576271186445
1885424,4,B00009MEK2,"The basis for most of the unjustly negative reviews in the site is that it's too simplistic and deconstructed to a gradeschool level. This series is not for physicists or physics enthusiasts - they should already know this stuff. This series is for the public, who remain largely unaware of the concepts underlying string theory, as well as the path which led to the generation of that theory.
This series does an excellent job of presenting difficult concepts in easily digestible portions. It uses a healthy dose of visual effects to illustrate what Greene narrates expertly using anecdotes and examples.
This series is designed to introduce and interest the average Joe in the larger concepts of the physical rules which govern all things, and it does that extremely well. If you're looking for deeper answers, you're not going to find them on television. For those who find this series sophomoric, enroll in a PhD program. For those looking for an entertaining, educational introduction to string theory, this is just right for you.",1084838400,14,1036,5.02906976744186
1885425,1,B00009MEK2,"Brian Greene has no greater fan (except maybe his mother), and his magnificent book The Elegant Universe is phenomenal.  I expected this tape to discuss some of the perplexing issues relating to superstring and M theory.  Instead I ended up with something made to appeal to grade school children--lot's of goofy special effects and only the most cursory treatment of the subject.  If you expect to learn anything from this video, you'll be bitterly disappointed.  The only reason I gave it even one star was because it was nice to actually see and hear the author--a truly brilliant scientist who possesses the rare gift of illuminating complex subjects for the general public.  Get the book instead.  After you read The Elegant Universe, get his next book, The Fabric of the Cosmos.  Forget about this ridiculous, juvenile video.

1885426,5,B00009MEK2,"I was struggling whether I should spend $35Cdn (I bought this from amazon.ca) on this 'String Theory' that I have no clue of what it is but only aware of the interesting sound of 'Theory of Everything'. I was also worrying my limited education background and brain capacity for such complex concept. I took the risk and completed my order. Two days later, I got my dvd delivered to my door, couldn't stand finishing my dinner, I opened it and watched it right away.
The first 3 minutes was the trailer/intro of this 3 hours DVD. It really drew my attention with interesting topics and high quality special effects & CG animation. I knew my $35Cdn was very well spent. The first hour talked about the ground concepts of basic forces: Gravity & Quantum Mechanics. Don't worry, you don't need a science or physic degree to understand these concepts. The beauty of this DVD is that it uses various scenarios, via pictures, animiation, & special effects to depict the complex concepts to you in a very simple & understandable way. Trust me, even your grade 6 children are able to comprehend the elegant universe theory from this DVD. The first hour was focusing on these basic forces, what Albert Einstein wanted to do with unification, and what the problems were. The second hour talked about how the String theory evolve and help to solve the puzzle of Einstein's unification problem. And the last hour will take the String theory to realize the possiblilities of 11th dimensions, the impacts to our world, and the future of this 'Theory of everything'. If you still find difficulties to understand those concepts, don't worry, you will find lots of interactive education materials from the second DVD. There's an initeresting demo let you to build from 1 dimensional line to a 4-dimensional hypercube visually. I absolutely found those extra goodies were very helpful.
The only picky thing I disliked was there're quite lengthy advertisings at the beginning of each episode. However, you can always skip it using fast forward. Honestly, this is a true FIVE STARS DVD. It's entertaining, it's simple, visual, excellent three hours programme. You and your kids will sure benefit from this amazing 'Theory of Elegant Universe' --- String.",1080432000,11,2233,4.925729442970822
1885427,3,B00009MEK2,"Let this miniseries be a testament to the old adage: When one cannot have substance, at least have style. Okay, maybe that's not an old adage. But it certainly applies to NOVA's attempt to televise ""The Elegant Universe."" It was so repetitious with the same generally campy (and overly computerised) animations and graphics that rather than actualy conveying any information, the audience gazed upon branes and entropic loops.
It seems to me that Superstring Theory has become a recent fad among those physicists who actually leave their houses. Championed by Columbia University professor Brian Greene, the theory (in my mind, at least in this NOVA set, more accurately an over-glorified idea) has become popular and given way to some rather interesting ideas.
Throughout this, as well, I couldn't help but get the impression that most of the scientists really thought string theory was a cool idea - but couldn't support it for the life of them. It's difficult (as a logical thinker) to believe a bunch of rambling about how cool something *could* be, but without any facts to support it. The concept is interesting to throw around, but there's no real support to be found in the NOVA series: Again, another reason to pick up the book. The professors can wax poetic about string theory to the point of excess, but eventually one has to ask: Am I actually learning anything?
This series aired in late October of 2003 during two or three weeks of NOVA on PBS. I witnessed it then, and subsequently witnessed it at a later date (and upon my completion of the pre-first-viewing-begun ""The Elegant Universe""). If NOVA had actually decided to be economical with the repetition of the basic ideas, this three-part series could have quite easily been shrunk to two, or even one.
Truth be told, it really wasn't as hideous as I may be impressing. I would most definitely recommend watching this series before actually reading ""The Elegant Universe."" If you have literally no knowledge of superstring theory, this is an excellent starting point: Greene manages to make quite complicated ideas clear via parallels he draws to ""real"" circumstances. It seems, too, that NOVA would recognise that the folks who stay home and watch television shows on theoretical microsphysics might not be so interested in watching a repetative, overly-simplified three-hour discussion, explanation, and theoretics of string theory.
If you're genuinely interested, but not sure where to start, this DVD set can be an excellent starting point. It is a gentle ease into the world of string theory. However, you should most definitely continue your interest with the book by Brian Greene of the same name, or his book ""The Fabric of the Cosmos"" (it's the new one). Overall, a valiant effort to bring a rather esoteric idea to the masses...But also, the impression that it's been so unashamedly watered down that it alienates exactly who is enticed.",1079913600,13,2917,5.016494845360825
1885428,4,B00009MEK2,"This a very interesting and extremely dynamic documentary that will give you all the basics of physics in order to understand what the string theory is all about.
It is adequately focused on the general public but without taking us for dummies, just as it happens on most astronomy related dvds. The explanations and examples are just great, easy to understand and cognitively challenging enough for the average public.
On the other hand, maybe Greene is overexposed and the interviewed scientists are way too static compared to the narrator. There are many scenes where people are writing formulas on a blackboard but wether they are simply not related to the topic being discussed or they are not adequately explained. For instance, when Greene was finally leading us to the main equations of the string theory, the ""gamma"" statistics distribution function was presented on a blackboard over and over again but without telling us if it is a central part of the string theory or is just a weird equation that looked good on the screen. Besides these minor defects, overall this is one documentary to be kept in my collection and I would certainly encourage anyone interested in science to buy it.

1885429,2,B00009MEK2,"There is maybe 20 minutes of unique interesting footage in 3 hours of video here.  It was unbelievably repetitive.  There are definitely some interesting explanations, and the animations were great, but how many times to do we need to see the same animation or quote from a physicist?

I kept waiting for it to get into the meat of string theory, and it never did.  Obviously the math is very complex, so there's a limit to what they could get into on a TV show.  However, all the information given here on the actual theory could be easily summarized in about 5 sentences.  3 hours is a lot to watch for that much information.

** Edit: **  To be fair, I watched this on PBS, not the DVD.  The PBS version was probably much more repetitive because of segment lead-ins and other promos (""Next time on Elegant Universe..."").  This is probably why I saw the same clips over and over.  Still, I stand by my statment that there is very little informaton here.  This is nothing more than a teaser on string theory.",1079654400,13,1009,4.453551912568306

7991793,5,B00009MEK2,"Depending where you are coming from and where you are going to, there is something for everyone. There are people that keep up with the latest information on the universe; for those people this is a great program to show where the public is. It also is nice to have what you already know restated so you can look at it from a different angle. For people that slept through school or attended in the Stone Age this is may be a shocker for the last time you looked. Then there are people that see this as a wakeup call for the first time.

The program is designed to give you basic information about the latest theories on how the universe works and goes beyond Einstein to attempt to tie all the theories up into a single elegant bundle (Superstings.)

The visuals help and having a different media allows one to retain information better. However the format leaves something to be desired. The redundancy goes beyond reinforcing to boredom. The sound byte format leaping from one person to another, when it is just as possible to stay with one person for a completed thought, is like watching a used car commercial. Any one concept could be a whole program in it's self (and probably is.) They show a formula and say here it is; two seconds later it is gone and they are off on another subject.

In any event you will not look at the universe in the same old way.",1503360000,,1363,4.400793650793651

The style is lively to the point of being humorous, which helps in making the issues understandable to non-physicists.  To its credit the documentary gives a good account of how string theory developed over a period of several decades, and how the ideas evolved.  Also to its credit, it repeatedly acknowledges that there is no empirical evidence to support the theory, which has up to now been an exercise in pure mathematics.  Since it was based on the popular book of a leading proponent of the theory, however, there is a certain degree of bias in the presentation.  There have been some powerful critiques of string theory, notably in the book Not Even Wrong, by physicist Peter Woit.
