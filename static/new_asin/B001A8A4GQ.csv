8276491,3,B001A8A4GQ,"Neither of these films are worth having unless you can get them in a box set like this for very cheap. I don't think you'll watch either of these more than twice. So if you can get this box set for the price it costs to rent them, then go for it. If not then don't worry about it.",1354147200,,280,3.76271186440678
8276492,5,B001A8A4GQ,"I never knew Silent Hill was a game before it became a movie. With that said, if you've never played the game, Silent Hill is an awesome movie.  Does that mean I would be disappointed in the game since I saw the movie first? I should test this theory.",1351036800,,251,4.122448979591836
8276493,1,B001A8A4GQ,"They call this pack Dreadtime Stories...mostly because it contains one horrible movie and one just ok film.  The only real connections between these two films is that Sean Bean is an actor in both of them and both stories revolve around a missing child.  Most people are familiar with the Silent Hill movie, while most have never even heard of The Dark...and theres a reason why.  The Dark is one of those films thats best left in the dark, it's terribly long, boring and unfulfilling.  The most frightening thing about The Dark is how long it is.  Sean Bean does a mediocre job in the movie but the whole story utilizes a lot of Celtic mythology and spiritual aspects that are foreign to most people.  The basic plot is that Sean Bean's daughter goes missing, simply disappearing and as it turns out she is now taken into a spiritual world.  As the movie progresses nothing really happens, Sean Bean discovers a few clues about where his daughter went but nothing concrete or remotely interesting.  By the end of the film he gets rather close to finding his daughter and then the movie simply just kind of decides to change its mind and have an ending where nothing really ends up happening.

I bought this film set because I love the Silent Hill game series and it was actually cheaper to buy these two movies together than just Silent Hill.  I thought I was getting a deal!  Well, I did save a few bucks and I can assure you that I'm never going to watch The Dark ever again as it was such a bland, slow and painfully long movie.

The other film in this bundle, Silent Hill attempts to remake the story from the first Silent Hill video game with some pretty drastic changes.  It has its creepy moments and will scare some people but die hard fans of the series might end up being a bit disappointed by a few things.  It's not a bad movie, I'd give it maybe a 2.0/5.0 since its not as bad as The Dark which is a 0/5.  The story begins with two parents having concerns over their adopted child's recent nightmares and sleepwalking and screaming ""Silent Hill!""  To try and help their child the mother, Rose, decides to take her to Silent Hill.  Things begin to go bad for Rose as a cop begins to pursue them and she ends up crashing her car only to wake up and find her daughter missing.  Rose decides to hunt for her missing daughter by wandering around the town of Silent Hill only to discover things aren't as they appear.  There are a few scary images but mostly poor dialogue and stupid interactions between other characters.  As Rose makes her way around town she learns some dark secrets about the town and its dark history and even a few things about her adopted daughter.

Don't buy this movie pack.  If you do, don't bother with The Dark.  Of course, you could always watch it and then wish you had taken my advice instead.",1299888000,2,2833,4.426640926640927
