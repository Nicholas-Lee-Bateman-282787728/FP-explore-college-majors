1648441,5,B00005QFE0,"This video helped my autistic son learn his alphabets. After engaging in this vhs purchase my mom got thirteen years ago for my younger siblings, my son starting singing for the first time in his four year old life. Simply amazing and tearfelt.",1338249600,,244,4.6976744186046515
1648442,5,B00005QFE0,"This dvd is great!  I did alot of investigation into learning videos for toddlers/preschoolers before buying this several years ago and all the rave reviews do not lie.  I showed it to my daughter almost every day when she was 2/2.5 (I had it on VHS) and then had to buy the dvd for my son when he turned 18 months.  When I began showing it again, my now 4 year old daughter absolutely loved it and learned the songs after a few times of watching it and she sings them from time to time on her own...finding the shapes and identifying which thing is ""different,"" are the things she likes most because she can now do that easily and feels very smart about it.  It is the perfect mix of cute and innocent with a little silly mixed in.  My 18 month old is just beginning to enjoy the songs, and I quite like them as well.",1291766400,,818,4.151898734177215

1648444,5,B00005QFE0,My 28 month old absolutely loves this video and I feel great knowing he's learning.  The songs keep his attention from start to finish.  I would recommend this to any parent of a curious and rambunctious toddler.,1218240000,,212,4.702702702702703
1648445,4,B00005QFE0,"I recently purchased the following videos: Best ABC Video, Best Counting Video, Best Learning Songs, Best Silly Stories & Songs, Best Busy People.  These videos are all about 15-20 years old (release date) and I had my reservations as to whether my 3 year old would like them, as he is very stuck on his LeapFrog letter and words videos (which I also love).  When I first viewed all of these, I realized that they are made with very simple animation, similar to when I was young.  These videos are extremely charming and sweet.  My son instantly loved them and has asked to view them repeatedly.  It was nice to have a video with the actual alphabet song, as the LeapFrog letter factory does not have it.  The counting video is also helpful in that it counts to 20 rather than 10 as other videos do.  He enjoys the silly stories and laughs at all the videos.  It is nice to know that kids can still enjoy classics such as these.  I am very pleased with them.  I also paid less than $1 or $2 for each of them (plus shipping).  A bargain!",1206057600,,1036,4.316062176165803
1648446,5,B00005QFE0,"Following four DVDs from Richard scarry series I found very good.

My 2 year old loves it.",1198627200,,147,4.25
1648447,5,B00005QFE0,"We have Baby Einstein's and Disney movies but this is the video my son asks for every day when Dad brings him home from day care.  He watches it over and over, reaches for the TV screen to touch the circles and triangles during the ""shapes"" song.  Claps when the audience is clapping, and says ""Nana!"" everytime Bananas Gorilla steals someone's banana.  Too cute.  (And Bananas Gorilla gets a lesson in manners at the end).  My husband and I have the ditties in our heads all day, but at least there are no purple dinosaurs.",1186617600,,524,4.473684210526316
1648448,5,B00005QFE0,"My 18 month old LOVES this video.  Up to now, he has only shown interest in Baby Einstein videos.  This is a cute video with a handful of songs teaching things like shapes, body parts, and manners.  We definitely recommend it!",1174176000,,226,4.463414634146342
1648449,5,B00005QFE0,"I got this dvd for my niece, and though she is still a bit young it seems that this dvd is an excellent learning tool. It has songs to learn numbers, colors, shapes, and etc, and I think to involve the learning with a song is the best way to do it.",1173312000,,248,3.7884615384615383
1648450,2,B00005QFE0,I liked them but our 2 & 5 yrs olds didn't find them interesting,1170201600,,64,3.642857142857143
1648451,5,B00005QFE0,"This is by far the BEST video I ever purchased for my two children, ages 1 and 3.  It's got a great learning value. It teaches numbers, letters, shapes, opposites, manners, etc.  The songs are so entertaining that my children are just ""glued"" to the TV once I have this video on, which gives me half an hour to get dinner on the table. Most of the time, my 3-year old begs to have the video repeated after it ends! The songs are so entertaining that even I enjoy watching!  I would recommend this video to any parents with children ages 1 - 5.",1168473600,,543,4.201923076923077
1648452,5,B00005QFE0,"This is a very simple video that stimulates and engages my toddler very much. There is no super excitement or cliche adventure going on, but the music and characters are truly enjoyable. Let your little one have fun with it !",1168300800,,225,4.512195121951219
1648453,5,B00005QFE0,My daughter is 22 months and I popped this in about a month ago and it has been her favorite since.  It is animated with cute songs and it's all educational.  I probably wouldn't recommend it for under a year and a half. It's my personal favorite video because it doesn't have annoying characters and songs like some of the other videos we have! Highly recommend!,1159315200,,363,4.484848484848484
1648454,5,B00005QFE0,"My kids 18 months and 2.5 yrs LOVE this video. They especially enjoy the ""if you're happy and you know it......."" and "" Heads and shoulders, knees and toes..."" Highly recommend this creative video.",1156809600,,197,4.823529411764706

1648457,5,B00005QFE0,My 2 year old son absolutely loves loves loves this DVD. He learned all the songs quickly and loves to sing and dance along with the characters. I highly recommend this to anyone with a toddler!!,1153008000,,195,4.444444444444445
1648458,5,B00005QFE0,"I purchased this DVD when my kids were twenty-two months old.  They love it!  Previously they showed no interest 'acting out' the songs.  (clap your hands, head and shoulders, etc.)  After watching the DVD they began imitating the movements and dancing to the songs.  My kids have more interest in the calmer DVD's like Kipper and Clifford.  If your kids like Dora, Elmo, etc. this may not be enough excitement.

I'm online ordering ""Best Learning Songs Video"" for my niece.  She visited yesterday and also loved the DVD. She is [...].  We can't wait to get the rest of the Richard Scarry series.",1150761600,,596,4.70873786407767
1648459,5,B00005QFE0,A++++ Video! My kids love this video & as a matter of fact so do I. They enjoy singing along with the songs & interacting with it too. I even have a few favorite songs! The music is very good & gives you a happy feeling and I think it's an EXCELLENT video children would love.,1143244800,,276,3.9464285714285716

1648461,5,B00005QFE0,My grandson listens to every word.  He is 2 and loves music so this is a perfect vehicle for him.,1140825600,,97,3.85
1648462,5,B00005QFE0,"I had gotten the vhs tape as a gift with my first child, and when he was about 5 months old, I would sit him in front of the tv to watch it as a would clean the house. I would rewind it and let him watch it again just to keep him occupied while I finish my work. After his 2nd birthday, I was washing dishes as he played, and I heard him singing his abc's! A couple of months later, he knew how to count to 10, and he could recognize some shapes! I realized later on, that during the times that I would park him in front of the tv to keep him quiet as I worked, that he was actually learning. I am not trying to advocate using tv as a babysitter or a teacher, because I spend most of my day playing with my children, without television. But if you need a few minutes out of the day to yourself, this dvd is perfect to let your kids watch, or even sing along with them! I liked it so much, that when I recently had my daughter, I immediately searched for and purchased this dvd! My baby laughs every time I play it for her.",1138665600,,1022,3.8714285714285714
1648463,5,B00005QFE0,"I bought this for my son who had a few of the Richard Scarry books.  He loves Huckle and Lowly!  The DVD arrived on a Friday and he was watching it over and over.  He loved the songs about shapes, the ABC, manners, opposites, and all the songs in the video.  He started singing it in the car and when he goes to sleep.  It is a great DVD.  It is only 30 minutes, but it is worth it.  I even like the songs... they have a very catchy tune!",1138320000,,438,3.8
1648464,4,B00005QFE0,Became our 2 yr olds favorite cd. Gentle action and great original sing along tunes.,1137283200,,84,4.666666666666667
1648465,5,B00005QFE0,My son absolutely loves this dvd! He is 16 months old and he loves dancing to the music and tries to sing along with the characters. Its a really cute video. I highly reccommend this for your toddler.,1137110400,,200,4.2894736842105265
1648466,5,B00005QFE0,We just got it for my 2 year old son and he loves it.  He knows his ABC's and 123's so he sings along with them.  The characters are all so adorbale I will have to get some more from this collection.,1136764800,,199,3.7142857142857144
1648467,1,B00005QFE0,"I had some high expectations after reading many positive reviews.  But my kid had no interest after 5 minutes of viewing.  Furthermore, the bad sound quality really bothered me so much that I had to throw away this DVD.  For young children, good quality audio (music, verses, etc.) is a must, and this DVD doesn't deliver that.  There are alot of noise from the start to finish.  I think the songs are ok (not good), but it's hard to hear the exact words because of the noise problem.  I think this DVD was a straight transfer from VHS.

I think people should avoid this DVD.",1131408000,,575,4.419047619047619
1648468,5,B00005QFE0,My daughter Maddy first watched this video when she was 6 months old and she still absolutely loves it three months later.  It really holds her attention... and I'm not sick of the songs yet either!  She rocks back and forth to the music and laughs at her favorite characters/scenes.  Highly recommend this.,1131235200,,307,4.754716981132075
1648469,5,B00005QFE0,"My twin toddlers love this video and sing along with it.  The voices of the animated animal children in the video are quite nice, not too brassy, and very clear.  The mild ongoing storyline makes the video fun as well.  I wish I could find more like it.",1129248000,,253,4.229166666666667
1648470,5,B00005QFE0,"My son Tyler still watches this video. It is one of his top five videos and well worth the purchase.  The production value is good and such a sweet show that will keep the wee ones occupied while us moms get other things done around the house.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1124928000,,263,4.346938775510204
1648471,5,B00005QFE0,this dvd is a great learning tool for our children and we don't mind listening to it either!,1124582400,,92,4.166666666666667
1648472,5,B00005QFE0,"I LOVE this video.  Honestly, this is the first item I've ever purchased from Amazon that I have felt strongly enough to write a review.  I am so tired of mind-numbing gibberish for kids- THIS video is sweet, entertaining and has some educational value.  I love the old-fashioned cartooning- much more than the modern computer-animated videos.  Really a worthy purchase.  If I am going to let my daughter (1 1/2 yrs) watch T.V.- its going to be this video- I'm ordering the 123 and the ABC video today!",1124409600,,502,4.659090909090909
1648473,5,B00005QFE0,"First let me say, I never met a 'Best of...Richard Scarry' video I didn't like.  Make that love.  My grandchildren like them all, but this one seems to be the most requested.  The video is nicely paced; the kids are not bombarded by constantly changing scenes as in so many of the childrens' videos and programs, which, according to studies, serve to reduce a child's attention span and lead to learning problems later. This is a great video - gentle and fun but never boring.",1124409600,,476,4.576470588235294
1648474,5,B00005QFE0,"Both my daughters loved this one at ages 2, 3 and beyond. It has the classic songs (like the ABC song) that teach as well as entertain.",1123977600,,135,4.037037037037037
1648475,4,B00005QFE0,This is a really cute video and I'd definitely recommend it. My kids love watching it and sing all the songs. We have several of the Richard Scarry books and watching these videos have made them love to read the books even more. I have to say they love this one and the Richard Scarry ABC video.,1123027200,,295,4.192982456140351
1648476,5,B00005QFE0,"My daughter loves it!!!!!  Very educational, and our all around favorite.  My 16 month old tries to sing along with the songs.  This DVD covers all the basics a toddler needs to learn from counting and the abc's and counting to shapes and opposites.  It is really reviews all the basics in one fun DVD.",1093392000,,302,4.4363636363636365
1648477,4,B00005QFE0,"This is my 2nd Richard Scarry DVD - I also have the ABC DVD.  Of the two, I think the ABC is better, but this one is quite good too.  It covers a series of concepts with a song each, like counting, shapes, prepositions, alphabet, opposites etc.  Of the songs, I don't find any of them memorable except the one teaching the alphabet, which is super (A is for apple, B is for bed, C is for crown that you wear on your head etc).
The DVD is about 30 minutes long, which I find ideal - you can get a bit of housework done without making the TV too much of a babysitter.
Be aware that the Richard Scarry DVDs look a bit low-tech, they are not flashy and polished like Sesame Street DVDs.",1078272000,,682,4.037037037037037
1648478,5,B00005QFE0,"I'm a huge fan of the Richard Scarry DVDs and videos, and this one is certainly amongst my favourites.  It is delightful to learn and sing some new songs with my 15 month all that can teach her about opposites, the alphabet, counting and shapes.  The tunes are catchy, the music is appealing and the lyrics are well sung.  Very sweet and simple, perfect for toddlers!  I don't see myself getting sick of this video any time soon, whereas if I hear ""Wheels on the Bus"" and ""Old McDonald"" one more time....",1065139200,,504,4.445652173913044
1648479,5,B00005QFE0,"I started out by buying Richard Scarry's counting DVD.  I loved it so much, I bought all the rest (minus the nursery rhymes DVD).  My 2-year-old son really enjoys watching the movie, as does my 6-month-old daughter. I personally enjoy the DVD and its innocence. I like that it is simple yet captivating for them. It really holds their attention. I tend to be pretty particular when it comes to movies for my children, making sure they don't teach any bad habits and that it doesn't teach anything contrary to the Bible. I was very pleased to see there wasn't any reference to magic, fairies, etc, as many things tend to include such references these days.  The DVD gave more than one example for each letter (F is for Firetruck, etc), and I was so glad to see that all of them were positive examples.  What a great learning tool!",1052006400,,829,4.506666666666667
1648480,5,B00005QFE0,"I don't rely on the television to entertain my 20-month old, but when I absolutely have to get things done around the house, I put in this DVD.  She LOVES it and is mesmerized for the entire 30 minutes.  It isn't fast paced like most cartoons and has beautiful music and lyrics.  I even find myself humming the songs as I work.  Because of the quality of this DVD, I've purchased other Richard Scarry books and DVDs and have been just as satisfied.",1051574400,,448,4.36144578313253
1648481,1,B00005QFE0,"Whatever the content (not bad), this has to be the worst value kid's DVD I have bought. Less than 30 minutes is what you get. A major [cheat.]",1048550400,,142,4.107142857142857
1648482,5,B00005QFE0,"I have a 16 month old boy.  He's been enjoying this since he was 12 month old.  All the songs are beautifully composed both melodically and harmonically.  I can enjoy these songs, too.  Now my son started imitating everything form this video.",1044662400,,242,4.690476190476191
1648483,5,B00005QFE0,"Both of my toddlers are engaged by this video.  We don't play cartoons often for them, but this video is the exception. Children don't need state of the art cartoons, and this one is not, adding to the charm. The songs are catchy, and simple.
We have the abcs and 123s as well.  All are entertaining.  For parents who like educational videos that are exceptional, I would also recommend the Baby Animals series and Baby Know It All series for live action videos, and the There Goes A... series if you have boys, or girls, interested in everyday things.",1042848000,,552,4.555555555555555
1648484,5,B00005QFE0,"This is a great video for children and parents.  It is very entertaining and educational at the same time.  It keeps the childs interest the whole time.  It covers shapes, numbers, letters, directions...and so on.  My first child received this as a gift and now my 2nd and 3rd watch it as well.  This is by far my favorite video of my children's.  It's a must.",1039651200,,360,4.378787878787879
1648485,5,B00005QFE0,"My sixteen month old daughter loves this video.  We borrowed it from a friend who's son is 4 to help our daughter with learning her ABC's & 123's.  Not only has it helped her in this regard, but she recognizes shapes and sings the ""up & down"" song throughout the day.  It's so wonderful I had to get it for our own collection.",1037404800,,326,4.142857142857143
1648486,5,B00005QFE0,"We ordered this as a result of a review I read.  This is by far my favorite kids learning video!  My daughter just turned two and has been enjoying it for about a year.  She has learned so very much from this.  Shapes, numbers and ABC's.  One day out of the blue, she counted to ten!  A couple of weeks later, she receited her ABc's and I believe that this one video had the greatest impact on this learning. Plus , it is enjoyable for adults to watch/listen to.  Songs are sweet and melodies are pleasant.",1035763200,,506,4.208333333333333
1648487,4,B00005QFE0,"First of all, it's useful to know that there are two sets of ""Richard Scarry"" videos available, each produced by a different company:  Cinar/Polygram/USA Films offers a video series called ""The Busy World of Richard Scarry"", and Sony/Random House has a set of videos named like ""Richard Scarry's Best (fill in the blank) Video Ever"".  There are notable differences between them.
The ""Busy World of...."" series consists of episodes from an actual television series, although I don't know what network originally carried it.  It's kind of bland and generic kids TV, and it sorely lacks the Richard Scarry charm.  Not recommended.
Our family much prefers the ""Best...Video Ever"" home video series. This series features simple storylines and really sweet, catchy songs that both preschoolers and parents enjoy even after multiple viewings.  ""Best Learning Songs"" is probably our favorite because it covers such a variety of subjects.  The story is extremely simple:  Huckle and friends put on a show in their backyard. Their show consists of gently educational songs about the alphabet, counting, shapes, opposites, common courtesy, etc.
On the downside, the animation is pretty primitive, the image quality doesn't improve from VHS to DVD (we now own both), and the price could be better for a 30-minute program.  But those charming, educational songs really carry the day, and both of our kids were completely entranced by this series of videos while they were preschoolers.",1035763200,,1472,5.260683760683761
1648488,5,B00005QFE0,"Our son was approximately 2 when a family friend passed this video down. I remember the Richard Scarry characters from almost 30 years ago. This video brought back all the wonderful memories for me while passing the characters onto our son. It is about the tamest video out there for content for toddlers. Our son can recite the songs, sings along and it keeps his attention. I highly recommend it.",1018137600,,398,4.7
1648489,3,B00005QFE0,"I bought this DVD for my 2-1/2 year old son.  The content is very useful for the children of his age.  DVD provides concepts such as shapes (squares, triangles etc.) as well as ABC's, 123's and up/down, between, under/over ideas.  Despite, the very good content, I feel the tempo is slightly slow and does not capture a child's attention for a longer duration.  I find my son is always more attentive to videos with some what faster moving action.
Overall this is a good program, and parents will find it useful teaching/learning tool for their children.",1011052800,,554,4.739583333333333
1648490,5,B00005QFE0,"Parents know that once you buy a video for your child, you will probbaly have to see it yourself at least 12,000 times. While Barney and the Teletubbies make me want to bury an ax in my own skull, I actually look forward to seeing this inventive, wonderful, whimsical video.
The songs are first-rate, with funny, engaging words and gentle melodies. And they do actually impart educational information about, among other things, shapes, body parts, numbers, manners, and the alphabet. The art is utterly charming, and the voice actors give every character an appealing and vivid presence. There is really nothing not to like about this video. Even the length is right for a child's attention span, and for limiting daily TV time. What I like about it most of all is that, while many kids videos are overbearing and insistent, this one is low-key and laid back.
We tried one of the other Richard Scarry videos (the counting one) and it was okay, but the magic of this one is unique.",1008201600,,980,4.703488372093023
1648491,5,B00005QFE0,"This is a really cute, fun video that my preschooler loves watching.  This video has been very helpful in teaching her several major concepts; such as shapes and opposites [as well as please and thank you!].  She enjoys the characters and loves to sing the songs over and over.  This Video is far and above better than most of the ""teaching"" videos available, and I'm really glad we got it!",988761600,,390,4.542857142857143
1648492,5,B00005QFE0,"I have tried to limit our videos to educational ones only and this is the best one we have purchased yet.  My 20 month old has watched it at least 15 times and still laughs, dances and sings with the kids for the entire tape!  I am going to start buying the rest of the Richard Scarry collection.  It's great to see that these characters haven't changed much from the books I had when I was growing up.",983232000,,402,4.128205128205129
1648493,5,B00005QFE0,"My 3-year-old daughter watches this video as often as 3 times a day! She's had it since she was 2 and hasn't tired of it yet; *nothing* else has captured and retained her attention the way it has. She's learned a lot from it, including some phonics, same & different, and those hard-to-teach prepositions. The songs aren't as nauseatingly cutesy as the usual kids' videos; they're actually kind of catchy...we even sing them in the car :)Richard Scarry has done an *excellent* job of combining learning and fun, and even made it interactive with ""find the shape"" and ""which one is different"" games. I wouldn't be without it!",970099200,,624,4.787037037037037
1648494,5,B00005QFE0,"Richard Scarry's Best Learning Songs video brings together catchy songs, both familiar (""Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes"" for instance) and new.  Huckle and the gang are putting on a variety show for family and friends which highlights all the things they know. (This implication that a kid can be an expert on a lot of subjects is a nice confidence-booster.) The material is illustrated and sung in a very clear way.  A song about shapes has the viewer identifying circles, squares and triangles in Busytown storefronts, and then those shapes are isolated and outlined so your child can see a direct correspondence between objects and geometric shapes.  All the songs are done in a similarly clear manner without a lot of overload.  The children's voices are robust and refreshingly non-professional.  Well, I guess they must be professionals or they wouldn't be on this video--but none of them sound like they're auditioning for ""Annie.""",970012800,,939,5.111111111111111

The content is perfect - shapes, alphabet, basic counting, head-shoulders-knees and toes -- for starting at  about 18 months and up!",952646400,,247,5.024390243902439
1648496,5,B00005QFE0,"In an era of increasingly ""in-your-face"" hyperactive productions for children, it's refreshing to see a video that teaches, entertains, and doesn't use the editing style of a ""Mountain Dew"" commercial. PBS  could learn a few things from this (to say nothing of the other networks),  but that's a different story. :-)",915321600,,316,5.176470588235294
