8511565,5,B0058DMFSY,"Old Tyme mountain music with Carl and Betty Ross provides a homespun touch of Southern Appalachian music which it isn't easy to find in Michigan's U. P.  I enjoyed the explanations of the area history, the music and how the instruments were made and used.  I especially enjoyed the segment of dulcimer music as Im learning how to play my own. Kate Marshall Graphics included some of their beautiful Smoky Mountain photography along with several historical photos from the area. This is a very entertaining and informative DVD, Ill enjoy watching and listening whenever I want a touch of the music of the Great Smoky Mountains.",1402876800,,626,4.89622641509434

We enjoy the DVD...getting to hear them talk about the songs they perform...was a little disappointed that there is not much scenery shown of the mountains.,1355270400,,327,4.839285714285714

The scenes of the Smoky Mountains, wildflowers and wildlife are beautiful.  The songs are entertaining, interesting and very well performed.  I especially enjoyed Carl and Betty's comments about the history of the songs and their instruments.",1315180800,,312,5.479166666666667
