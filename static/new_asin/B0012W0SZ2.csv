8248001,5,B0012W0SZ2,I loved this show as a child and am so happy I found it. Brings back many fond memories and is still a great show to watch with my kids.,1369008000,,136,3.566666666666667
8248002,5,B0012W0SZ2,"This is safe viewing for even the youngest toddlers and preschoolers, and is an exceptionally well-written children's collection, packed with timeless moral themes. There are many wonderful ""takeaways"" to be gleaned from the adventures of Davey and his big, goofy dog, Goliath -- humor, love, learning, music, friendship, simple examples of God's hand in our everyday life, honor, philanthropy, integrity, stewardship, servitude, and even some real-life lessons in the School of Hard Knocks.

I am no expert, but I believe this is what was commonly referred to as Claymation. Despite having originated in the 1960s, these renderings are of decent quality and have been very well received by my children. We have the set of four DVDs and enjoy watching them over and over again. In total among the four DVDs, there are (22) 15-minute episodes, and (4) 30-minute specials.

Highly recommended; watch them together and be blessed!",1295308800,,927,5.256756756756757
