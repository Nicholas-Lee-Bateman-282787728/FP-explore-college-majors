8447279,2,B004XNNV2Y,I cannot imagine what these reviewers saw as redeeming qualities in this movie other than getting to watch Clive Own. Good grief.,1524614400,,129,4.909090909090909

8447281,4,B004XNNV2Y,love anything Clive Owens does. This is like a a cool BMW ad.,1493596800,,61,3.769230769230769
8447282,3,B004XNNV2Y,"1988 (not 2016) B minus film drama in which two losers in a grim British industrial town take cross-country joyride with an older divorce. The film features a 1950's ""classic American car"" with right-hand drive. The plot is basically a round trip to nowhere, back to grim reality. Big deal for Clive Owen fans: his first feature film.",1482364800,2,334,4.775862068965517
8447283,4,B004XNNV2Y,"This is the first feature film that Clive Owen and David Thewlis ever made. It's finally available on DVD and my copy from Amazon is region 1 (So there were no issues with the DVD player and region codes).  The quality of the picture is good, but very old (film is from 1988). The sound is okay.  But we're dealing with a long-forgotten low-budget film so you have a very dark picture and flat sound. I don't think that Film4 restored the film before putting it out on DVD. The story goes by quickly. It's filmed up in the Blackpool/Burnley area of Northwestern England, by the way.  IMDB makes no mention of that.  If you're a Clive Owen die-hard fan, like me, you'll be happy you bought the movie.",1401235200,3,699,4.395348837209302
8447284,5,B004XNNV2Y,Was looking for this movie on DVD as I had the VHS only. David Thewlis is a wonderful actor and I have most of his movies. highly recommended.,1396915200,2,142,4.107142857142857
