956400,4,630506685X,"One of the scarriest movies I personally have ever seen.  Black Sabbath is three stories, all being introduced by Karloff himself, and finally staring in the Last and most terrifying segment The Wurdlack.  Each story has its  own moments, such as the stare of the dead witch in A Drop of Water, or  Karloff holding his grandchild in The Wurdalack.  So dim the lights and be  prepared to be scarred out of your wits...",962755200,,417,4.5675675675675675
956401,4,630506685X,Black Sabbath was the first horror movie I ever saw & still scares me today. Three stories with Boris Karloff as narrator & vampire in the third tale. You should see this more for the first part though in which a  nurse steals a ring from a dead patient. What happens still makes me  shudder!,961804800,,292,4.290909090909091
956402,5,630506685X,"I once saw this movie on late night TV, complete with commercial breaks.  It was long before I heard of Argento or Bava.  This film, particularly the last segment with Karloff, literally gave me nightmares.  I've been looking  for it everywhere, and am so glad it's coming out on DVD.  I shall never  forget the scene of Karloff looking in the window with the entire Vampire  family at the end.  It is simply incredible.  I've since become a Bava fan  and love LISA AND THE DEVIL (a masterpiece) and SHOCK (which I saw as  BEHIND THE DOOR 2)--another eerie and unforgettable film.  But do NOT miss  BLACK SABBATH if you care about artistic and downright scary horror films!",961718400,,673,4.601694915254237
956403,4,630506685X,"Boris Karloff tells us three grim stories and manages to send shivers down  your spine with each one.
In the first, ""Wurdelak"", he plays  the so-called east-european Vampire, that keeps on turning his whole family  into bloodsuckers. The scenery of this story is wonderful, as is the  decoration and the acting of everyone included.
In the next story  ""The Waterdrop"", a Nurse steals a ring from a crazy old woman.  Unfortunately, the old woman died during an okkult celebration and has no  ambitions to enter the afterlife without that ring on her finger. The  make-up of the corpse is one of the scariest I have ever seen. It kept me  not-sleeping four weeks when I saw the movie for the first time. ( I was  six years old )
The last one ""Telephone"" isn't all that, quite  unlogical and not as memorable as the first two. You won't find any ghosts  or supernatural beings here, you could rather imagine it to be sent on  ""X-Factor"".
The first two episodes are both worth five stars,  while the last one lets the movie down, but perhaps you I got that  impression because I was blown away by the second one. I recommend it to  all of you cliche-addicted, monster loving and Hammerfilm-loving fans out  there. Of course, Boris Karloff fans should check it out to.",961200000,,1263,4.591928251121076
956404,4,630506685X,"Though he dosn't appeal to me as much as Dario Argento, Mario Bava's direction remains stylish and influencial. Though many of his movies are badly dubbed into English and a few of the basic story-lines are just plain  stupid, many viewers find it hard to resist his scary techniques. BLACK  SABBATH was one I really enjoyed, the atmosphere really jerked around with  my mind. Bored looking Boris Karloff is fun as the narrator who tells us  three stories. The first one focusses on a woman who steals a ring of a  corpse; the corpse strikes back. The second one (perhaps the best) is about  a hooker who gets an unexpected phone call from a dead friend. The third  one stars Karloff as a shaggy vampire who comes in from the cold. It's all  good fun really; one to watch with a bunch of people, I guess.",956448000,,804,4.458904109589041
956405,5,630506685X,"I was 7 when my mom took me to see this movie. It scared me so much, I never forgot the look on the dead womans face and dripping water always has me looking over my shoulder.....",933206400,3,179,3.864864864864865
956406,5,630506685X,"I was born in 1970, New Jersey, and the last time I saw this was with my brother and to this day, he's 32 and I'm 29, we still are constantly referring to it and it's magnitude of horror! The only other mortifying  movie to us in those days would have been Burnt Offerings (sp?) with the  coffin being slammed up the stairs. I personally thought the little doll in  Trilogy of Terror was amusing, while my Mom and brother hugged and clawed  each other in fright.",932601600,2,462,4.275862068965517
956407,4,630506685X,"Black Sabbath is one of those movies that made a horrifyingly-indelible impression on me when I first saw it.  In ""The Drop of Water"", I can still see the contorted visage of the dead spiritualist as she fixes  her malevolent stare on the woman who has robbed her in death.  ""The  Telephone"" was the weakest of the trio.  But the third segment--The  Wurdalak--gave me insomnia for days.  As a lover of the vampire genre, I  was struck by the twist in the old legend:  a Wurdalak returns from the  dead to attack those whom he loved best on earth.  Boris Karloff plays the  title character, a paterfamilias who sets out to destroy a local  bandit-turned-Wurdalak.  If he has not returned in exactly three days, the  family will know that he has been victimized, and must be destroyed.  Of  course, he returns just after the three day mark.  The sheer horror comes  from the fact that the family knows the truth, but can't admit it.  The  scene of Karloff cuddling and stroking his young grandson is enough to make  you want to call Child Protective Services!  Really good stuff, and a  clarion call to those who insist that one needs massive special effects or  blatan, on-screen gore to succeed.  Kudos!",926726400,54,1203,4.636363636363637
956408,3,630506685X,"I enjoyed this movie when viewed in 1963 or 64 and  enjoyed it almost as much when I recently saw it again. You have to place youself back into that time period to really enjoy it since today's movies are so full of  violence, sex and terror.  The first and third tales in this movie are a  little better that the second tale (The telephone) though I always  remembered all three tales as being scary. If you enjoyed the old sci fi  movies such as Kronos, The Crawling Eye, The Giant Behemoth, etc., you will  enjoy this movie with the great Boris Karloff as both narrator and  appearing in the third tale.",918518400,,606,4.348214285714286

956536,4,630506685X,"4/5 for the movie, 3/5 for the HD transfer. Bava offers up a enjoyable series of horror shorts introduced by Boris Karloff. There are many scenes that suffer a lot of graininess and not just the typical dark shots, but also quite bright colorful scenes as well which is unfortunate. Bava is a master cinematographer but there are some shots with jerky/wobbly camera movement.

Overall enjoyable, but I think I'll try the Kino version... I wish I'd noticed it prior to buying this version.

956776,4,630506685X,"Mario Bavas horror anthology boasts beautiful colors and set design, but loses some points in the story department.  (Im reviewing the US edit.  Apparently, the Italian version is quite different--especially the second story--and superior by most accounts.)  The first two installments amount to lot of foreplay before a murder.  I found them a bit dull, relying for the most part on the spectacle of terrified women staggering around a room for their thrills.  I will admit that there is a very startling death mask in the first story; Im glad I didn't see it as a child.  The final story, The Wurdalak, is the best.  Boris Karloff is terrifying as an undead creature come back to haunt his family, and his introductions to each section are fun.",1456531200,,746,4.826771653543307

But anyways, well made film with 3 stories. And the stories well made if they don't scare you they will at least show you some creepy moments that make you ponder back at times. This is the ""English Dub"" version so you hear Boris' actual voice which is nice.

956785,4,630506685X,"Three tales of terror and the supernatural.  Or.  Two hits and a complete miss (The Telephone).  These three short films are strung together with an overly ""cute"" narration featuring Boris Karloff supposedly affecting a menacing manner.  The first film is The Drop of Water.  Boris asks the audience ""do you believe in ghosts?""  In this tale of petty theft, things to not end well for a nurse (Jacqueline Pierreux) who steals a sapphire ring from the cold dead finger of a vengeful medium.  This one slowly builds suspense through a single character being ""attacked"" in her apartment by the sound of dripping water from multiple sources, a persistent fly, the banging of an open window, the sudden loss of light, and a frightening apparition.  The second film is The Telephone and it suffers from too much tampering (the original meaning of the story is greatly altered from the Italian version to the English version).  In this version, a woman is or isn't being haunted by a ghost who later invades her apartment but he's quite substantial in form and function!  How can you be haunted by someone alive?  The third film is The Wurdalak and it's a story about living cadavers who feed on human blood.  It stars Boris Karloff as the head of a family besieged by a wurdalak.  Daddy returns home after vanquishing the evil wurdalak but he's not entirely right, in fact, he's downright peculiar.  Into this melodrama steps a passerby (Mark Damon as Vladimir Durfe), who falls for sister Sdenka (Susy Andrsen).  When the members of this family start to turn, Vladimir and Sdenka try to flee.  The rest of the family is obliged to give chase.  And thus, the very first family owned fast-food chain was developed.

In turns, these short films are creepy, confusing, and filled with dread.  It's almost a perfect set.",1445990400,3,1810,4.799352750809062

The great Boris Karloff introduces three creepy stories, where the last one he portrays a vampire which was the only time he did in his whole screen career.  The first segment ""A Drop Of Water"" is my personal favorite, a fly-by night nurse steals a ring from the hand of a female medium's  corpse, after an aftermath of  a seance that didn't go so well, then strange things begin to happen to the nurse.

Ozzy Osborne claims that he & his band mates were watching this film in their hotel during a tour; making such an impression that they changed their band name, to Black Sabbath. Originally in Itallian, the subtitled versions don't sync up very well, due to editing & scene chronology differences; plus, it's just crazy~wrong that Karloff is speaking dubbed Italian.

Even though the actors spoke English, purists seem to prefer the Italian language dub version because it also preserves Bava's original edit.  Too bad they couldn't do a compromise using Bava's edit with the English dialogue. The most unfortunate cut in this version is the loss of the humorous coda revealing the low-tech trickery used to make Karloff appear to be riding horseback through the forest (it's really just stage hands running in circles holding fake trees!)

957021,4,630506685X,"Finally the AIP version of Mario Bava's  THREE FACES OF FEAR retitled BLACK SABBATH is available in a digital medium This new Kino Lorber Blu-Ray showcases the film in a high quality transfer but it is not quite fully restored. No matter, it is the English version and what a relief it is to hear Boris Karloff speaking in his own voice. If you own the previous Image or Anchor Bay editions which are in Italian and have never seen the AIP version, there are numerous changes. Aside from being in English, the order of the stories is rearranged. In the original it is 1) THE TELEPHONE, 2) THE WURDALAK, and 3) THE DROP OF WATER. The American version is 1) THE DROP OF WATER, 2) THE TELEPHONE and 3) THE WURDALAK.

There are also a number of different inserts as Karloff's narration was altered to make it seem more like his old THRILLER anthology series which was then at its height. The Italian segments are longer, more colorful visually, and more humorous in nature. The original ending to the Italian version involving Karloff riding a fake horse inside a movie studio is cut entirely. In addition to rearranging the order of the stories, the AIP version makes a number of vocal alterations to THE TELEPHONE changing it from a giallo type story to a supernatural one and disguising some lesbian overtones.

The plot summaries are as follows. In A DROP OF WATER a nurse steals a dead medium's ring only to have her reanimated corpse come back for it. THE TELEPHONE has a woman tormented by the ghost of her former lover through phone calls until he comes-a-calling. Finally THE WURDALAK (the longest segment) features Boris Karloff and Mark Damon in a period tale of a family stalked by its patriarch who has become a vampire. WATER is definitely the scariest with the face of the dead woman hard to forget while THE WURDALAK is the most atmospheric. THE TELEPHONE now seems little more than filler as it has been so altered that it makes no sense. The original Italian version of this story is definitely superior.

I used to have this version on VHS  and later a DVD-R taken from that video but now having this Blu-Ray means I can throw those away. My one complaint with this Blu-Ray release is that it contains no subtitles for the hard of hearing. Both BLACK SUNDAY and THE CRIMSON CULT do have them so this seems an unnecessary oversight on Kino Lorber's part. Still it's easy to follow and Karloff's linking segments tie it all together. 2 out of 3 stories isn't a bad average and the American music track gives it a different flavor. If you're a fan than you must have this disc. It also comes with commentary from Mario Bava specialist Tim Lucas.",1437436800,23,2657,4.573529411764706

He is even in one of the stories.  Great atmosphere and two of the stories are rather creepy, The Wurdulak and especially The Drip of Water.  I've seen both the Image Entertainment DVD release which is about 96 minutes long, and the Kino Lorber DVD release which is about 92 minutes.  Both versions are very good quality but the Kino version seems somewhat brighter and clearer and slightly sharper.  My only issue is that neither version has the English dubbed version included.  THAT version would be the one to have.  Hopefully someday that one will be released one day, with good cover art from one of the posters of the time.

957026,3,630506685X,"If you are considering paying the inflated price necessary to acquire the Kino Blu-ray of Black Sabbath/Black Sunday The US Release Versions, here are my thoughts specifically about Black Sabbath. (For those interested in Black Sunday, I apologize. I prefer the International Version of this film released by Anchor Bay on DVD titled The Mask of Satan, and so haven't watched this Blu-ray US version.)

If you are primarily or exclusively interested in the segments The Drop of Water and/or The Telephone, by all means purchase the Kino Blu-ray. When compared with the Anchor Bay DVD, the images are sharper and with more definition, and the colors are better IMO because they are somewhat cooler (for example, flesh tones are more on the pinkish side rather than on the yellow/orange side). Also the soundtrack is perfectly synchronized with the video on both of these segments, and that includes Karloff's introductions. And Karloff's introduction to the entire movie is also without flaw.

If you are primarily or exclusively interested in the vampire segment called The Wurdalak, you may want to pass on this release. Even though the images are again better than the Anchor Bay DVD (granted, a huge plus when talking about the cinematography of Mario Bava), the soundtrack is noticeably out of synch with the video, on both Karloff's introduction and the segment itself. This is truly a shame because Karloff's voice is so distinctive and it is sorely missed by fans of classic horror on non-US versions. For some perhaps the positives here may outweigh the negative. For me this synchronization problem definitely detracts from the overall viewing experience of The Wurdalak.

One final thought, just personal preference. My favorite segment of Black Sabbath has always been The Drop of Water, and I think Les Baxter's US version score during the climax (where the corpse of the dead medium rises out of bed and terrorizes the nurse) works better to convey the dreadful shock of what is happening, as compared to the subdued organ music on non-US versions.",1428364800,5,2061,5.055882352941176

957070,3,630506685X,"I have been awaiting the release of the U.S. versions of Black Sunday and Black Sabbath, with Les Baxter's score, for years!  For whatever reasons, the British seem to have either obtained the rights or bypassed the rights to market this item, while the American market lags behind.

In the U.K., Arrow Video has produced a dual format (DVD and BD) release of Black Sunday that includes two versions of the film: the European version with score by Roberto Nicolosi and the re-edited and re-dubbed AIP version with Les Baxter score, three audio versions: Italian, European English, and AIP English re-dub and re-score, English SDH subtitles for both English versions and a new English subtitle translation of the Italian audio, a deleted scene from the Italian version, and three trailers: the International, the U.S., and the Italian trailer, in addition to a number of other extras.

Arrow Video has also produced a dual format release of Black Sabbath that includes two versions of the film: the European version with score by Roberto Nicolosi and the re-edited and re-dubbed AIP version with Les Baxter score, English SDH subtitles for English Audio and a new English subtitle translation of the Italian audio, and three trailers, in addition to a number of other extras.

The only drawback with the Arrow releases is that they require a region-free multi-format DVD and/or BD player because they are in PAL (European) rather than NTSC (U.S.) format.

That said, I looked forward to getting the KINO release on BD so that I could watch in NTSC.  Unfortunately, the KINO release was pulled, except for a limited number of copies.

I was able to obtain a copy of the KINO.  Unlike the Arrow releases, the KINO does not include all the visual and audio variations of the two films.  It is also not packed with commentaries and other extras.

In its favor, the BD transfers (b&w for Black Sunday and color for Black Sabbath) are crisp and clear.  There does appear to be some audio synchronization problem on the KINO during the Wurdulak segment of Black Sabbath, but it did not bother me all that much.  It was somewhat noticeable at first, but less so than the extent that a foreign film spoken in Italian would have been noticeable if dubbed into English.

So, on balance, I give the KINO release three stars because it is welcome to see these films on BD in NTSC format, but it did not include variants and extras and it had a slight audio synch problem.  The question will be how high a price you may be willing to pay to obtain one of the limited copies that managed to get into circulation.",1415491200,4,2596,4.7272727272727275

Boris Karloff has a voice that is distinctive and it really is hard not to want to hear his English speaking voice in his part as emcee of the three tales told here, in which Boris plays the leading part in the second, ""The Wurdalak"" based on a Tolstoy story that Italian director Georgio Ferroni re-made in 1972 called ""The Night of the Devils.""  The other two above average horror stories are ""A Drop of Water"" and ""The Telephone.""  What Cheezy presents is an Italian language, good quality transfer with English subtitles for their usually low price, but for a few dollars more I could have had the Kino Blu-ray with a better quality if I wanted to fore go hearing Boris say his lines in English.  Very disappointing.  But then Baba made up for it with an exemplary production.  Bava also had a hand in the script with Ivan Chekhov and Alberto Bevilacqua and the cinematography with Ubaldo Terzano.  The excellent make-up was by Otello Fava and Art Direction by Giorgio Mercuri.  Also starring Mark Damon and Michele Mercier.  Actually, ""The Wurdalak"" is the one most cited as most shuddery, but I liked Ferroni reboot much better as a serious attempt to bring the story, probably on a lower budget than even Bava had to deal with, into the ranks of one of the most horrific horror films and realizing that.

Boris Karloff introduces three stories about horror. Do you believe in ghosts? They are not as good as the classic horror movies from the 1930s-1940s. It takes a good story to make a good movie. The last story comes from an Ivan Tolstoy story Vyrdolak. It is the best, but barely average. Or is it this adaptation? The word vampyr is of Slavic origin, the Rumanian word is strigoi. Bram Stokers work of fiction has been translated into every European language except Rumanian. Vlad Dracula is a national hero there. He was praised by the Pope for being the only European ruler was not defeated by the Turkish Sultan.

1) This story begins on a stormy night. A woman winds up a Victrola to play music. She takes a drink. The telephone rings with a call for her talents. She arranges a dead body for burial. Miss Dorrie is told she died in a trance. Dorrie removes the ring from her forefinger. Were finished. At home Dorrie admires this ring. Where did that insect come from? She hears water drip from a faucet, then noise from a loose shutter. How did that body get into her room? She acts frightened and screams! The landlady called the police. That ring is gone! There is a look of terror on her face. [Does this remind you of some Edgar Allen Poe story?]

2) A telephone rings, the caller hangs up. Then he talks to Rosie. Are you listening? Later it rings again, a man talks to her about her appearance. She turns off the lights, the telephone rings again. The mans voice tells her nothing can help her. She hears a man and his dog walk past her door. There is a letter under her door. She dials a number to call Mary about Frank. Later she has a nightmare. Does it foretell her future? Can anyone kill a ghost? Can a ghost make a telephone call? [What about long distance charges?] This reminds me of some story from Outer Limits.

3) Do vampires only leave their coffins at night? Vladimir rides his horse in a mountainous area. He sees another man on the ground with a knife in his back. He finds a cottage nearby. He tells the occupant where he found it. Who was that Turkish bandit? Ali Bek was a Vyrdolak. He is warned to leave this house before their father returns at 10PM. [A Vyrdolak is a corpse who seeks the blood of the living.] Night falls, they hear someone approach. He is hungry. Tell people that Ali Bek is dead. Why does that dog howl? Kill him! The head of Ali Bek will be displayed for all to see. The old man walks around at night. There is bad news for Xenia. Should she leave this house? The other woman grieves. That night they hear child call. Who is at the door? That couple stop at an abandoned house for the night. Will they be safe there? Xenia cries. Will they be followed? Gregor watches. Why did you leave us? asks Gregor. Vladimir searches for the missing Xenia. I would rather die than lose you. Kiss me. Vladimirs horse runs free.",1384041600,,2896,4.377323420074349

957194,5,630506685X,"Those of you who think the American version is better have no idea what you're talking about. This original Italian version is far superior in every way to the edited, dubbed American version. First and foremost: the sequences are in the right order. The American version opens with ""The Drop Of Water"", then plays the heavily altered ""The Telephone"", and then ends with ""The Wurdulak"". This completely alters the essential flow of the movie. The original version is: ""The Telephone"", ""The Wurdulak"", and finishes strong with the brilliantly horrifying ""The Drop Of Water"". Secondly: ""The Telephone"" is edited and re-written by the obviously homophobic AIP to not include the lesbian angle in the plot. Rather than have the jealous lover be the voice on the phone, they wrote in some nonsense about a ghost calling! This twist completely changes the story from sub-par to good. Thirdly: they cut out the hilarious tongue in cheek ending with Boris Karloff hamming it up. Then they re-shot his opening introduction, and included more dialog in the middle. This original director's cut is much better in every sense to the Hollywood censored version. An absolute must see for any fan of Bava or any fan of horror in general.

The film, originally titled ""Three Faces of Fear"" is an anthology of three horror stories, filmed by Mario Bava. A woman is terrified by threatening phone calls from a man she sent to prison, a vampire feeds on the blood of those whom he loved the most when alive, and a nurse is haunted by the spirit of a patient from whom she stole a ring. All are well done. The problems I found were with the Blu-ray itself.
The film image seems flat, with thin washed-out colors and a slightly cool bluish tint -- skin tones are pinkish. Some of the dark scenes in ""The Telephone"" segment have green-looking  shadows, unlike the earlier DVD which had solid blacks and rich warm colors. Some of the film has dust speckles and the sound has pops and crackles in places.
Kino has done a disappointing job of bringing this popular Bava film to Blu-ray. The film itself is a treat for Bava fans, but I am giving only four stars because of the poor technical quality.",1374451200,3,989,4.398907103825136

Their last offering was ""Black Sunday"" which like this one DOES NOT include the American Version of the Film!! The version we all grew up on playing on TV and before that at the drive-in was a recut, rescored, and most importantly ENGLISH version which included Boris Karloff's real voice. This version will ONLY feature the Italian Version of the movie WITHOUT Karloff's inimitable intonation AND SUBTITLES (unless you speak Italian). Now, admittedly the Italian Version is the stronger of the two - the 3 stories appear in a different order and slightly different cuts than they do in the American Version, which softens the horror and dumbs things down a little for the US Market. But for the Bluray release BOTH versions should most definitely have been included. A very small label from the UK recently released this title with BOTH versions as well as a SLEW of mouth-watering extras that are also not present in this lame release!

Black Sabbath (1963) is a Mario Bava Italian horror anthology consisting of three separate short stories - The Telephone, The Wurdalak, and The Drop Of Water.  This anthology stars Boris Karloff, Michele Mercier, Mark Damon, and Jacqueline Pierreux, among many others.  To sum up, the overall atmosphere of these stories is dark, shadowy, creepy, and macabre.  The sets do wonders as well.  That is the main strength of these stories.  I've seen scarier movies, but the creep factor and macabre atmosphere is very good.  The story called The Telephone is quite predictable and its modern setting is oddball compared to the other two stories, but it's a good story that is worthy of being included.  This is one of those movies that's good to watch while sitting back on a recliner in the middle of winter or on a stormy night.

The British hard rock band Black Sabbath named their band Black Sabbath after seeing this movie.

I highly recommend seeing this anthology.",1359158400,,1101,4.929347826086956

Picture quality and sound are superb. I don't remember seeing any lines blips or artifacts. There are three short stories in this collection, Boris Karloff is in the second one. He plays a great character. The first story, ""The Telephone"", was pretty weak and did not belong with the other stories. I can't believe they actually put it on there. The second story involves a vampire from eastern Europe called a Wurdilak and is very good. The last story was equally good, involving a witch come back from the deathbed for some revenge.

957355,3,630506685X,"Mario Bava (1914-1980) is celebrated as Italy's master of ""giallo film""--a term that derrives from the Italian term--""yellow""--for pulp fiction. He began work as a cinematographer in the 1940s and in the 1960s became noted as the director of semi-erotic, sado-masochistic horror films that typically found sexy women writhing helplessly in the hands of a vicious tormentor. Released in 1963, BLACK SABBATH (known in Italy as I TRE VOLTI DELLA PAURA) was an anthology film, presenting three different stories: ""The Telephone,"" ""The Wurdalak,"" and ""A Drop of Water.""  And yes, the film did inspire the name of the band Black Sabbath, which the band lifted when they saw the movie's heavy attendance.

In the original filming, actors seem to have spoken whatever language best suited them--Boris Karloff is clearly speaking English.  For the original European release, all non-Italians were dubbed into that language.  When American International Pictures released the film in the American market, however, the reverse occurred and all non-English actors were dubbed into English.  AIP also made several other significant changes, knocking out and replacing much of the original score, adding light-moment intros to each episode performed by Boris Karloff, re-ordering the stories, and most particularly recutting and dubbing ""The Telephone"" in such a way as to erradicate lesbianism, a subject that was still was greatly tabu in the United States.  Both versions were extremely successful.

This DVD release is of the original Italian version, not the later American version.  In ""The Telephone,"" Rosy receives a number of increasingly disturbing telephone calls and ultimately realize that they are coming from a man she sent to jail some years ago and who has now escaped.  Terrified for her life, she calls her ex-lover Mary to stay with her for the night.  Mary treats it as a lark and uses it as an opportunity to get back into Rosy's good graces--but there is more going on here than either Rosy or Mary suspect.  In ""The Wurdalak,"" Boris Karloff stars as the patriarch of family that has been plagued by a vampire-like creature he claims to have killed.  But has he in fact become of the dreaded wurdalaks in the process?  ""A Drop of Water"" finds an impoverished nurse tempted to steal a valuable ring from the hand of a corpse, but she soon finds she must pay a terrible price for it.

None of the stories can be described as ""horror"" per se, they are really more in the ""weird tales"" tradition, and while none of them will make you jump in your seat all three are effectively creepy.  ""The Wurdalak"" has many fans, and truly Boris Karloff looks quite unlike his usual self--and gives quite a good performance, if you can get past the dubbed Italian issuing from his lips!  But my own favorite was the third and final ""A Drop of Water,"" which builds from nothing and has one of the most disquieting conclusions you can imagine.  Regardless of the episode, the real attraction here for fans of director Mario Bava is the way the thing looks.  Bava was a master of surreal lighting, and the movie pulses with unexpected minglings of blue-green, red, and amber that flicker through very atmospheric shadows on very atmospheric sets.  It's an exceptionally interesting style.

The DVD offers the film in very good, if not actually pristine, condition, and it contains a number of extras--trailers, a commentary--that fans will enjoy.  Recommended to those who enjoy Bava in specific and Italian horror in general.

957405,3,630506685X,"I saw this in the theatre upon its original release and liked it quite a bit. I thought I'd revisit it and, though not bad, it didn't quite hold up.

Here's the scoop. This trilogy of tales starts with the story of a woman who has to help prepare the body of a recently deceased medium for burial. She steals a ring off the medium's finger. Not a good idea. Things go bad for her. In the second tale, a woman begins receiving phone calls from a man who should be dead. A man she helped double cross. He's not in a very good mood. The third and best directed stars Boris Karloff. It involves a Verdulak which is a vampire who likes to keep things in the family.

Things change. They evolve. Films, even at lower levels, have gotten more sophisticated over the years. The tools are certainly better, but so is the storytelling, acting and essentially everything else. The director, Mario Bava, has secured his place in film history and he does a decent job here. The first two stories are a bit claustrophobic but he still does a decent job handling a tight area. The stories are Okay but of an age gone by. The second, particularly, with its ""Twilight Zone"" type ending, seems a bit naive by today's standards. The third piece is directed much better. Bava has more room to move. The sets and lighting really help set a mood. But the story itself is more of a mood piece. There aren't a lot of scares. The average viewer should be able to see where this is going.

This is very watchable. It probably gave the creeps to the audiences of that time. It's just that that time has passed.",1337644800,,1583,4.359322033898305

The first The Telephone (**1/2 of 5) is a thriller with no supernatural elements.  Its also a bit dull and predictable.  It takes its own twists far too seriously.

But the other two stories The Wurdulak (starring Boris Karloff seeming like he's having a great old time, his tongue firmly in cheek.  Karloff also does terrific bookend pieces to the film) and A Drop of Water (both **** of 5) have a real sense of fun and playfulness along with Bava's usual stylishness, and over the top lighting (which can, admittedly, get annoying at moments  in Drop of Water light from every window keeps rising and falling.  It may be that its supposed to suggest lightening, but its mostly just distracting).  When Bava has fun with the hoary clichs of vampires and revenge of the dead, its a lot easier for us to have fun too (and, ironically, I also found it more tense).",1322265600,,883,4.579617834394904

She calls up her ""friend"", her lesbian lover, the woman she has spurned and said she'd never see again, to come help her, since the police will never arrive in time. The woman comes, and we feel sexy all over. The final confrontation is an interesting surprise that I shouldn't give away here, but it's good.

In ""The Telephone"", the deliciously sexy Michele Mercier is consistently called by a madman proclaiming he will murder her by dawn. Next is ""The Wurdalak"", which is basically old school Italian for vampire. A family awaits the return of their father, who had been on the hunt for one of these nocturnal nasties. At the stroke of midnight, our warrior of the Wurdalak arrives claiming victory... but can one take those words without worry when uttered from Boris Karloff? Last is ""The Drop of Water""; the title gains symbolic significance after a nurse decides to steal a ring from a recently deceased patient. Perhaps not considered that big a deal to some, until it is realized that the newly dead used to talk with the dead when alive... Horror legend Karloff also lets his legendary presence be known as host of this anthology, which actually turned out a bit more uneven that I had expected. While the first and last segments are entertaining, I personally would have liked to see a full length feature of ""The Wurdalak"", which is full throttle Bava Gothic Horror all the way. Thankfully, it is the longest segment, at least. While not able to put Black Sabbath (aka The Three Faces of Fear, or I Tre Volti Della Paura in Italian) on a pedestal like others may, it is nonetheless required viewing for classic horror fans and among the best of Bava's work. Note: This Anchor Bay release has the film in its original Italian language with English subtitles only.

957481,4,630506685X,"This review is of the European dubbed version (in Italian). ""Black Sabbath"" was directed by Italian horror master Mario Bava, and it's Italian title is ""I tre volti della paura"" or ""Three Faces of Fear"" (released in 1963). I have to say that I loved this trilogy of horror movies - highly atmospheric, chilling and superbly acted and I will definitely add this title to my modest but growing collection of classic horror movies.

In this Italian-dubbed version, horror icon Boris Karloff not only acts but makes an introductory appearance as well as at the end, spouting some tongue-in-cheek lines to great comic effect. What I truly missed here was the original English dialogue, as I did not really fancy listening to Karloff's dubbed over performance. The three stories featured here are supposedly inspired by the works of Maupassant, Chekhov and a certain Alexei Tolstoi. The first story is ""The Telephone"" featuring an attractive woman, Michele Mercier who finds herself hounded and terrorized by sinister phone calls threatening her life. There is a predictable twist in this story and obvious lesbian overtones. The only thing I liked about this first offering was the credible performance of the lead actress. Her portrayal of fear is real and credible, but the plot is wanting, and all too predictable to sustain my interest.

The second offering is ""The Wurdulak"" which is actually my favorite of the three ( I notice most of the other reviewers liked the third story the most). A unique twist on the traditional vampire tale, this story portrays the wurdulak as a vampire which thirsts for loved ones who are still living. Boris Karloff plays the role of patriarch of a peasant family in the countryside who has slain a feared wurdulak and who returns to his family after several days in a strange state. The family suspects he has turned into a wurdulak but find themselves unwilling to act. I found this genuinely creepy especially when the wurdulak goes about claiming his victims, one of whom is a young child.

The final story in this DVD version is ""The Drop of Water"", and yes, it is creepy. In this story, a nurse goes to prepare a recently deceased patient for her funeral, and whilst dressing the dead old lady, finds herself tempted by the beautiful ring on the deceased's finger. The nurse (played convincingly by Jacqueline Pierreux) pockets the ring (well actually she slips it into her blouse) and goes home...but given that the old lady who died was also a practicing medium, well...things don't go too well for the thieving nurse. Many have commented about the creepy-looking corpse, and I agree to some extent... perhaps I've watched too many creepy movies. But the second story still stands as my favorite - the wurdulak as portrayed by Karloff sent chills down my spine, especially in one scene, where he grabs his young grandson and embraces him, there's a certain look of hunger and eagerness there that was almost ghoulish!

""Black Sabbath"" is a great trilogy of horror stories, and dare I say, a must-have for fans of horror classics. It has everything a fan desires in period horror - atmosphere, assured direction, engaging plots, and credible acting. Highly recommended!",1256860800,4,3209,4.926062846580407

It was a wonderful film and played out in three parts featuring the great Boris Karloff. As soon as I noticed it would be showing at a midnight opening I went out to see it that very evening by myself.  Karloff introduced all three stories and starred in the ""Verdilact"" which concerned vampires in Europe.

I remember enjoying two out of the three stories tremendously and my solitary walk home when the LUXOR opened its doors to the dark windy streets of New York City.  I enjoyed every minute of my walk in the dark relishing every minute I had spent with Karloff and company.",1246233600,,735,4.343065693430657
957484,5,630506685X,"Boris Karloff narrates this film which features three fantastic tales of the macabre. In fact, he even plays a vampire (gasp!) in the third tale.

Black Sabbath is colorful, entertaining, & downright frightful. What more could one ask for in a horror film? Many could even argue this is the best film of Mario Bava's career. I wouldn't go that far as of right now but I do think it's definitely one of the best films he made.

For those looking for a spooktacular flick, look no further. This one is very light on gore & violence but delivers on the suspense level. There is even a tad bit of dark humor displayed in fleeting moments making this one a sure keeper in your dvd collection. From the opening scene to the final clip, you won't be able to keep your eyes off the screen nor will your friends or family. Don't even try.

The first tale ""The Telephone"" basically is a short Giallo film about a beautiful, young woman receiving menacing phone calls from a man who just recently released from prison. The suspense in this yarn is definitely a great beginning & you would almost believe it to be the greatest although two more tales of terror have yet to reveal their secrets.

The second tale is also near classic. ""The Wurdulak"" is a gorgeous filmed story about a family whose elder has just become a vampire & is compelled to feast upon the ones he loves. Boris Karloff really took this role as the vampire & ran with it easily making this tale simply amazing.

The last tale is entitled ""A Drop of Water"" & may very well be the creepiest entry of the trilogy. This one involves a nurse who steals a ring from a recently deceased woman only to be hanuted by her vengeful spirit. As with the other entries, the color here is brilliant & the stories are well-written.

These were usually classics like BRAINIAC, HORROR OF PARTY BEACH, or INVASION OF THE SAUCERMEN. One night I crept down only to witness Bava's BLACK SABBATH w/ Boris Karloff. This movie terrified me! I was haunted by it's images for literally years afterward! Now, I was only a kid, so some allowance must be made. Well, I just watched it again last night, and though it didn't scare me, it did bring a huge smile to my face. SABBATH is a perfectly ghoulish horror anthology in 3 parts, introduced by Boris. In THE TELEPHONE, a woman (Mich&eacute;le Mercier) is plagued by a sinister caller who threatens her life. This one has a bit of an ironic twist. THE WURDULAK is a vampire tale w/ a rather surprising level of dread and doom! It stars Boris Karloff and Mark Damon. Finally, THE DROP OF WATER has a sticky-fingered nurse (Jacqueline Pierreux) who steals a saphire ring from the hand of a dead medium. Not a smart plan! The medium returns in unforgettably terrifying fashion, causing the nurse to regret her actions in the extreme. This third segment was the one that really got to me as a youth. I kept seeing that dead medium's face w/ it's glaring eyes and clenched teeth. Brrrr! BLACK SABBATH belongs among any true horror-fiend's fear-gear...",1232755200,,1403,4.684210526315789

957566,3,630506685X,"Mario Bava's entry in the Cormanesque compilation horror stakes, The Three Faces of Fear aka Black Sabbath suffers the format's common problem - the variable quality of the individual stories. In this case, in the Italian cut at least, that's somewhat exacerbated by having the best of the three in the middle of the picture, leaving it somewhat anticlimactic. The stories' heritage isn't in doubt, based on stories by Chekhov, Tolstoy and Maupassant, but neither opener The Telephone, about a woman harassed by phone calls that may be from the lover she betrayed to the police, or A Drop of Water, about a nurse who finds herself terrorized by her imagination after stealing a ring from a dead woman she laid out, offer much in the way of surprise or chills. Neither, it's true, does the central and longest story, The Wurdalak, yet that tale of a family gradually picked off by vampires cursed to drink the blood of those they love most in the world is executed with enough panache, striking visuals and unexpected nastiness (a child is the first to die) to keep you intrigued even though you know exactly where it's going.

A dubbed Boris Karloff provides the star power for this sequence as well as the introduction and epilogue, which features an initially inept shot that turns into a truly delightful in-joke by the time the end credit is ready to appear (the new intros he filmed for the US version of the film are not included on Anchor Bay's DVD of the original Italian version, although they can be glimpsed in the disc's US trailer, part of an actionably misleading US advertising campaign that included a poster of a headless horseman that doesn't appear in either version of the film!).",1209340800,,1700,4.762711864406779

 Good, now that I got that out of the way. I really like this 3 tales of suspense and horror flick. I remember seeing this film on a Friday late-night TV show called Creature Feature back in the late 60's. My Dad would wake me up minutes before Midnight to watch the movie of the night and ""Black Sabbath"" would be the regular film in the weekly rotation of Horror and/or Monster movies. So, this film made an impact on me and has sentimental value as well.
  The first tale ""The Telephone"" was my least favorite of the 3 stories in this film. Since the U.S. version was heavily edited for American audiences, I found this story more fasicinating with the vengeful Lesbian twist in the original Italian version. Of course, Michelle Mercier is a delight to watch and easy on the eyes. Boris Karloff plays a Wurdulak (vampire who drinks the blood of his loved ones) in the second tale of the film called ""The Wurdulak"" - of course. Even though there are no graphic scenes of biting or blood spurting everywhere (like todays vampire movies), this story still has some eerie and chilling atmosphere and Mr. Karloff does a wonderful acting performance as a vampire hungry for blood. The last story ""The Drop of Water"" is the one that made the most impact on me. For the time when this was filmed, it really scared me as a child. The face of the dead medium was enough to give me nightmares and make it hard for me to fall asleep...I was 8. I never forgot that pale, scary and frightening look with the wild white hair floating across the room to kill the woman who stole her valuable Jeweled Ring near the end of the film.

957569,4,630506685X,"It's Black Sabbath!  And I'm not talking about those crazy hippies who play that heavy metal devil music either-Mario Bava's Black Sabbath!  It's considered one of the high points in Bava's career, and easy to see why.  It's an anthology horror film made up of three seperate stories.  The first is about a woman alone being terrorized by threatening phone calls.  The second story with Boris Karloff is a slight variation of the vampire myth with a stranger meeting a family in the woods who are involved in some spooky stuff.  The third is another great example of why you should never attempt graverobbery if you're in a horror film.  A woman steals the ring off the hand of a dead woman and soon comes to realize that the dead woman is dreadfully attached to it.  The story with Karloff is the best of the bunch, and I'm sure most would agree.  Bava really shows us how good he is with visuals.  It'll remind you of a Hammer film, but with some of Bava's trademark wacky colors.  The first story isn't bad, but you'll have that ending figured out long before it happens.  The third story is quite short and it's easy to see why.  It'll remind you of a Tales From The Crypt story.  Nothing too earth shattering, but the corpse of the old woman looks kinda creepy.  Alot of Bava's flashing, colorful lights set the mood in this one.  A movie definitely seeing if you like, or are interested in Bava's style.  Yes, this is the Italian version as so many have said before me.  Most horror fans don't mind(or just downright prefer) films with subtitles.

957636,5,630506685X,"Terror and horror, are two distinctly different things. And sometimes you experience both together. The body doesn't know the difference between stagefright, joyful anticipation, dread, and waiting at the top of a roller coaster to go 75 miles per hour down that big hill.

In ""Black Sabbath,"" mild as it is in comparison to later films, has some true fear-inspiring moments. But, as an American English-speaking  film watcher, I urge people to watch the European release. The actors spoke their lines in English, but the dialogue was wiped and dubbed in Italian, only to be subtitled in English. This is a distraction, as it takes away from paying full attention to the on-screen goings-on, but it still is the superior version. The American release toyed with the running order of the three stories, putting the hardest-hitting first, making the ending sort of an anticlimax, and changing the story and background music of one of the stories, ""sanitizing"" it for what the producers believed their target audience. And, effectively ruining it.

I like the look of movies from this period (1963). Even though we have state-of-the-art production values now, the way ""Black Sabbath"" looks, from way back when, is simply beautiful. The design of the sets, and the coloring of such. So vibrant, real life looks dull in comparison.

The first of the three stories, called ""The Telephone,"" is a very real scenario; a woman hears a man has broken out of prison, a man she helped put away, and she is convinced he's coming after her. Over the phone, he's telling her what clothes she's wearing and so on, he's watching her, and this would be completely unnerving, no matter who you are. Of course, there are several plot twists, keeping the viewer's attention, and as it unfolds, there is an ironic plot twist, the message being  ""Don't mess with other people's lives!"" Considered too racy for us dumb, gullible Americans, the English-speaking release has the voice coming from the grave, a ghost's voice, and there is an element which, at the time, was a little too cutting-edge for mainstream entertainment's standard of decency. The stalking victim's friend, also a woman, obviously had some kind of sexual(?) relationship with the protagonist, and a reference to lesbianism, must have been too ""out there"" to market here. NEVER censor a movie, unless it is in pre-production, and YOU are the writer yourself!!!!! I can't put enough exclamation points here. It dumbs down the narrative, no matter what the subject matter, and it interferes with the film makers' original vision. And for whatever reason, the soundtrack music was replaced with something that sounds like Henry Mancini. I like Mancini just fine, but I don't want to hear ""Pink Panther"" music while watching a story about someone being terrorized. But luckily, the version I bought is the European release, story and music intact.

The ""Wurdulak"" is, to me, anyway, the least gripping of the three stories. It is good, for all it's worth, a twist on the classic vampire story, but it seems to be  a tale of devotion. Would you leave your family with someone you have just met? Would you let your little child freeze in the Winter weather, knowing it's not him, even though he looks and sounds just like him? The same effect used is on ""The Exorcist,"" where the possessed girl imitates the one priest's dead mother's voice. He knows she's dead, and he feels guilty over it, but hearing her plead with him, is emotionally destroying him. This is what is happening in ""The Wurdulak."" These things.

The one thing that compromises this story, at least to me, is the howling dog outside. It's plainly obvious it's someone off-camera howling, and not very convincingly, at that. They used real horses, why couldn't they get a real dog howling? Maybe I'm being too nit-picky, but this could have been better. Although, this little chink in the armor isn't SO bad as to ACTUALLY RUIN the story and film. It's just the one thing I would have done differently. I sound critical, I know, but I am just telling why this is the least of the stories. It would be nice if it were a three-way tie.

And now...

The crowning jewel. Naively titled, ""The Drop Of Water"" is by far, the most memorable of the segments.
A woman, one interested in the occult, dies during one of her seances. Officially, it was a heart attack. The owner of the house is too frightened to prepare the body for removal, and calls the nurse for help. She comes over, and is helping and so forth, but notices a very expensive-looking ring on the decedent's finger. Five-finger-discount. She steals the ring, but to her detriment, she has a conscience. A glass of water spills, and a housefly repeatedly lands on the corpse's finger. It won't go away. Back home, all of her spigots keep dripping, and that same huge fly won't leave her alone. Shades of Poe's ""Telltale Heart"" become apparent, the victim's heartbeat driving the murderer insane.

Describing what happens next doesn't necessarily ruin the film's impact, as describing it only plays it down. Let's just say, that face is one you will see in your head for years to come. Did the medium actually come back? Was she a hallucination? I can say, without reservation, especially given how old this movie is, certain images can scare one to death. And in the case of the story here, literally. Ghastly, absolutely ghastly.

The epilogue was omitted from the dumbed-down version, just a funny parting message from Boris Karloff, a way of saying, ""Hey, it's just a movie...Or is it?""

This is what classic horror is. It doesn't run out and yell ""BOO!"" like so many do; it gets inside your head, and especially in the case of ""The Drop Of Water,"" it just won't leave.",1192406400,3,5735,4.8101522842639595
957637,4,630506685X,"First of all, let me tell you that this is not the definitive release I'd have hoped for. Had the original Italian version been included, this would be a five star review and then some.  The original, un-fu#*ed-with version is out of print and I'd have hoped that a two DVD set with both versions and a slew of bonus features would have been the way to go for this new release.  There is a commentary track and interview along with the usual trailers and stills, but I expect better for such an underrated classic.  That is the only thing stopping me from giving this movie the five stars it so richly deserves.  Now that that's out of the way, I do have fond memories of this English-language version, which shows the three short films in a different order and edits them a little bit because that's just what we did with foreign films back then.  The dubbing is top notch, however, and any way you cut it, ""Black Sabbath"" is still among the greatest horror anthologies ever made.  At least in this version you get to hear Boris Karloff's real voice, right?

""The Drop of Water"" is largely considered to be the best of the three vignettes that make up ""Black Sabbath"".  The story is about a woman who steals a ring off of a dead woman's hand and then begins experiencing odd phenomena, most notably a constant drip of water that reappears elsewhere in her home as fast as she can tighten the leaky faucets.  It is certainly the most atmospheric of the three and the climax is indeed terrifying, even if the special effects aren't what they once were.

 ""The Telephone"" is the weakest of the three and the one that suffers the most from the editing.  In fact, the entire premise of the story itself is changed through manipulation of the dubbed dialogue and the ommission of a few key shots.  What remains is a straightforward story of a woman being stalked via phone by her psychotic ex-lover, recently escaped from prison. The Italian version was an extremely ironic tale of a jilted lesbian lover that censors must have thought would either offend American audiences (Oh no, it's the gays, hide!) or fly over their heads.  What remains is still an engaging little film that probably inspired&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scream-Dimension-Collector-s-Series/dp/630521610X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scream (Dimension Collector's Series)</a>.

Last in this cavalcade of the macabre -and my personal favorite- is ""The Wurdalak"", a chilling vampire story that stars Karloff himself in the title role.  A wurdalak is an corpse come to life that seeks the blood of those he loved most.  It opens with a family awaiting the return of their father, who has left strict orders to kill him if he is gone for longer than three days.  After the stroke of midnight on the third day, the dog begins to howl and Boris Karloff, looking every bit the part of the ghoul, slowly shuffles home to his terrified family.  It's an awesome scene and the story only gets better from there, but I won't spoil the rest.

If you've never seen this film and you're a fan of classic horror do not hesitate, pick it up ASAP.  Mario Bava never was a fan of gore, but that doesn't mean he didn't know how to scare an audience.  Each of the three short films that make up this feature are more than worth your while and at least two of them are stone classics as far as I'm concerned.  If you can't secure the Italian version, this one is more than adequate, although the original version of ""The Telephone"" is far superior.  I'll finish this review with a bit of music trivia.  This is the film that inspired four men in Birmingham, England to create a new, dark style of music designed to frighten people the way this movie frightened them.  The name of the band?

I first saw this film in 1966 when I was 17 years old (do the math if you must).  I went to the theatre with my best friend, and it scared the mortal hell out of both of us.

Later the same year, sitting around in a college dormitory swapping stories with my dorm-mates (all female--it was 1966, after all), I actually made one shriek by imitating the corpse's face from ""Drop of Water.""

""Drop of Water"" especially frightens me to this day each time I recall it.  I fully intend to buy the DVD.  I just wonder if I will have the nerve to unwrap it!",1153094400,3,741,4.205673758865248
957684,4,630506685X,"Most people know ""Black Sabbath"" from the American version released in 1964 by AIP.  This, though, is the original Italian version (""I Tre Volti Della Paura""), with Italian dialogue, subtitled in English.  Many of the actors were clearly speaking English as they are filmed, but overdubbed.  At the time this was made, all Italian films were shot without production tracks and post-dubbed, though it is a little disconcerting that the Italian voice looping Karloff sounds nothing like him.

The main differences between the Italian and American versions are the order of the stories and the Karloff introductions.  The Italian wrap-arounds are highly entertaining, particularly the closing one which shows Karloff riding a hobby horse, emphasizing the artificial quality of film in general (this alone is worth buying the tape for).  In the Italian original, the order of the stories goes roughly from the most prosaic (""The Telephone"") to the most terrifying (""A Drop of Water"").  The AIP version puts ""Water"" first (and if ""A Drop of Water"" doesn't creep you out no matter what language they're speaking, you're uncreepable).

Within the episodes themselves, ""Water"" is virtually unchanged between the two versions, while ""The Wurdlak"" has a few more shots of blood and gore.  More than the other episodes, ""Wurdlak"" also benefits from being presented in wide screen (the AIP version on tape is full screen).  ""Wurdlak"" also changes the name of the leading lady between the Italian and American versions.  In this, the original, it is ""Sdenka,"" which in an Italian accent sounds uncomfortably like ""Stink.""

The middle episode in both versions is ""The Telephone,"" and here the two version differ considerably.  In the Italian version, there is nothing supernatural going on, but there is an intriguing lesbian sub-plot that was clearly out-of-bounds for the youth-oriented American release.  The AIP version uses several cuts and some newly-filmed inserts to imply that something otherworldly was behind the action of the story.  While the Italian version makes more sense, it is not as creepy as the American version (and Les Baxter's score for the AIP version is better than the original music).

Not only is this rendition of ""Black Sabbath"" fascinating from a film buff point of view, but it's a fine print of one of Mario Bava's best films.  Definitely recommended for anyone wanting a chilly good time.",1138147200,5,2410,5.186046511627907

of the trilogy escalates to climax, 'The Drop of Water' being the

crown jewel.

It is beautifully shot, and color plays a significant role as

warm hues and cool blues coexist in a nightmarish landscape.

Exceptional story-telling makes sub titles seem incidental.

And, a playful ending after the most horrific tale is a welcomed

treat.

It's still scary, only now, an adult's eyes can see the elegance

of it's unfolding.

In short...Bravo...Bava!",1119398400,2,822,4.948529411764706
957687,5,630506685X,"I first bought this film because it was the inspiration for the band name Black Sabbath. As it turns out, it was more than I expected. This is one of the greatest horror movies of all time. Very few modern horrors can compare to this one. Boris Karloff really outdid himself in this film. It really freaked me out. It really makes you marvel at the innovation that early horror movie directors had. Even by today's standards, this movie is frightening.

So whether you're a Sabbath fan or a horror film connosieur, you'll love this movie.",1119225600,2,538,4.604166666666667
957688,3,630506685X,"We can all say now that we've done right by our foreign-film-watching, Criterion-Collection-hoarding consciences, having seen the DVD of Bava's phenomenal ""Black Sabbath"" in the so-called 'original' version.  We can also say, if we're honest, that there's nothing original about the DVD, because it's an English-speaking print (just watch the mouths, especially Karloff's!) with the English track removed, and Italian dubbed over it!  Even the subtitles don't accurately translate the easily-read mouthings of the characters, and whoever the soggy-voiced paisano was that they hired to dub Karloff's stentorian tones, he's pure vocal manure.  What a travesty, rendered in the name of supposed service to Bava and Karloff, two true artists of horror.

  I dare to suggest that AIP actually improved the Bava original, adding the 'ghost' fillip to ""The Telephone"" in place of the absurd lesbian twist (""I'll be talking to you every night"", the ghost says in the English version, as he yet again calls the faithless Rosie from beyond the grave, and the whole theatre chilled over in l965, when I first saw it).  They also improved Roberto Nicolosi's mordantly unexciting music by replacing it with Les Baxter's colorful and creepy score as well, although Baxter's ouevre utterly lacks subtlety.  But hey--you want subtle horror, watch ""The Innocents"".  Baxter's music itself beautifully augments several visuals, most notably Karloff's first entrance, the revealing of Alibeck's head, and the utterly haunting childlike strains as the vampiric baby kneels before the door, calling to his mother--another theater-chiller.  The jazzy stylings (a Baxter specialty) of ""The Telephone"" are splendidly in tune with that urban nightmare as well.  And how about Mme. Zaina, the manniken-medium of ""A Drop of Water""?  Baxter captures the mood of her magnificent ugliness perfectly, as well as the shock and fear of the victim she stalks after death, in an horrific spectral appearance.

  Finally, who in his right mind would swap Boris Karloff's marvelous original vocals, in his last true performance as a monster (the vampirish Wurdalak grandfather) for the atrocious dubbing-on-dubbing of this DVD?  Karloff captured intonations that seem to echo from a hellish netherworld, whether ordering the death of his favorite dog, or promising the 'present' of vampirism to his sleepy grandson.  He was utterly superb, and his performance, as he spoke it, deserves to be heard.

  How about it, MGM?  Couldn't this beauty stand a reissue, maybe with the American version (also scored by Baxter) of ""Black Sunday"" as well?  Slap it onto a double-feature disc; I'd sure buy it, and it certainly wouldn't be my blackest day!",1119139200,5,2705,5.3451536643026

Anyways, i am just glad to own this wondeful film, despite the fact its all in Italian.

Mario Bava is truly genius to come up with these REALLY scary tales, and this only adds to his long list of GREAT CLASSIC horror films. His films have something special about them... they arnt gorry, just really SCARRY in an either psycological or visual way. Black Sabbath may be his best work, and inspired many other of his films as well as the telephone horror genre.

957690,5,630506685X,"Well it,s almost Halloween,and i broke out my vhs copy of  the AIP re-cut of this film. I said let's go on amazon  and see if the dvd is available yet. And what do i  see?-the dvd version is not the A.I.P.I'm still  interested in procuring the Italian version,but after  reading all the really wonderfull reviews by fans of  this film,i concur that it's a drag the American and Italian versions are not paired together in one package.  Again,due to the large number of excellent (and very detailed) reviews-regarding plot,scenes,Bava,and the breakdowns of the three stories within,here are just a few impressions i have on the film.  ""The Drop of Water"" has haunted me since childhood. And from what i have read by others here-it seems they feel the same way about it. Now on to Madam Zaina(pronounced zay-na).Half actress?,half dummie,ALL NIGHTMARE.She is without a doubt the scariest visage ever captured on celluloid(2nd is a tie between Chaney's Phantom and Reagan Mcneal{Linda Blair in The Exorcist}-3rd is the ""floating on air"" basement hag in the original ""house on haunted hill""the same effect was used in this film with Madam Z-with roller skates-wheels- i think).Any way she is the gold medal crown,numero uno, A #1 Specter,Ghostie,Corpseie of all time. And when i hear the word Ghost,it's her face that i see in my mind first. I can just imagine Bava in pre -production meetings beseeching his artisans and make-up man to come up with a face for his dummie/actress star that would ""emblazen"" it's aspect for all times upon the visual cortices and collective unconsciousnesses of all those who beheld her(wow that was a mouthfull-hope i got all the spelling right).I have also wondered, what studio werehouse or private collection in Italy her ""dummie""half resides in(if in fact she's still around at all, and was not given the ""Rosebud""treatment.i.e. BURNED after production,or the ""Mussolini"" treatment i.e.hung upside down by the feet and pelted and beaten senseless-or just maybe she's still around ,and is available on ebay).I read one review, that referred to her as ""magdalena. Is that her name in the italian version? No matter, to me, she'll always be, Madam Z.There is just somthing about ""female"" ghosts that male specters just don't hold a candle to. Bava was a genius with atmosphere,and (my god)lighting.also, sets and props. The scene where the maid makes her way down the hall to answer the door for the nurse as she arrives at Madam Z's Manor. A far away shot that reveals the hallway in all it's unkempt splendor-cats galore,dead rats on the floor,drapes, pillars,urns with dead flowers,and those lit up colors- deep purple hues,oranges and blues-Resident Evil game designer's were inspired for their game's interior's by this film i'm sure-flickering old fashioned light bulbs-the lamp with a mind of it's own-or madam Z at work?,And once in Madame's creepy room,the dolls all over the place.lying on open chest'o drawers, and floors.tarot cards on the round table,fire place shadows reflected on the closed curtains of that grusome bed, as Madam Z is first revealed(this is where she looks like an actress and not a dummy),when the nurse pulls the curtains open-puncuated by eerie Les Baxter Piano stabs(in the american version only).All this conspires to provide a major dose o'the WILLIES for the viewer. I can't imagine any other music to all of this then Les Baxter's wonderfull(woodwind-low string heavy)and creepy Stravinsky-Berg""tinged score(again only in the American vhs version-also available in the vhs file here at Amazon-get both-the AIP vhs and the Italian DVD).Quite a change from all the ""beach"" movies with Annette and Frankie,he would score soon after with his partner Al Simms. I hope the american version will be forthcoming in DVD format soon. A final comment about Karloff-i can't imagine the Italian dubbing of his line (in the vampire story-tossing Alibek's head to the camera-zoom in on his face with that dead icy glare)""HANG IT ON THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE FOR ALL TO SEE""!!!Head swinging on post outside as we hear Les Baxter's falling minor thirds. The ""Drop Of Water"" is the ultimate in ghothic horror cinema,the high water mark in creeps and scares,and even camp. The greatest achievement of it's kind in film history.",1098748800,5,4275,5.0625
957691,5,630506685X,"Italian director Mario Bava (1914-1980) is one of the giants of the horror film genre. Bava's big break into the field came with his 1960 black and white classic ""Black Sunday"" starring Barbara Steele. This was only the beginning, as Bava churned out a series of gruesome shockers over the next seventeen years; his films always promised great style mixed with scenes of murder and mayhem. Perhaps Mario's biggest contribution to the horror genre was his 1972 picture ""Twitch of the Death Nerve,"" also known as ""Bay of Blood."" It doesn't take too long to realize ""Friday the 13th"" shamelessly cribbed from this slasher bloodbath. At least two of the murders in the film appear almost unchanged in the first installment of the Jason Voorhees franchise. That's right-- Mario Bava gave birth to the modern slasher film. But he also dabbled in non-horror films with projects like ""Four Times That Night"" and the immensely entertaining peplum classic ""Hercules in the Haunted World"" starring Reg Park as the muscle bound hero. After watching many of his films, I have to express further admiration for this amazing director; he could make an entertaining motion picture no matter what the subject.
""I trevolti della paura,"" known on these shores as ""Black Sabbath,"" is a great contribution to horror cinema. In 1963, Bava filmed three short stories and packaged them under one title with Boris Karloff introducing each segment. The first tale, ""The Telephone,"" is a claustrophobic tale of horror that takes place in the apartment of Rosy (Michele Mercier). Strange and horrifying phone calls begin streaming into the apartment at the same time Rosy's ex-husband Frank leaves prison. Alarmed that her hubby will try to hurt her, she dials up her pal Mary (Lidia Alfonsi), asking her friend to come over and comfort her. There's an interesting subtext to Mary and Rosy's phone call that the American version apparently cut out of the picture before releasing it that this Image Entertainment DVD restores. Watch to see what it is. Anyway, Mary arrives and, when Rosy falls asleep, writes something down on a piece of paper for her friend to read later. When Rosy wakes up, she learns a few painful truths about both her friend and her ex-husband.
The second story, ""The Wurdulak,"" stars Boris Karloff as Gorca, the patriarch of a well to do Russian family in the eighteenth century. Wurdulaks, what we would call vampires, plague the countryside. Gorca sets out to slay one of them, a fellow named Alibeq, but leaves strict instructions to his family to destroy him, Gorca, if he returns any later than the stroke of midnight five days hence. Gorca reasons that he will be a vampire himself if he has not returned by that time, and his family agrees. Predictably, Gorca returns late and acts very, VERY weird. The family knows something is wrong but agonizes about doing what they know they must do. Their hesitancy has unfortunate results for several members of the family. This story is the best one on the disc; check out the scene where Karloff thunders around on a horse. Very creepy!
The final tale of woe, called ""The Drop of Water,"" finds Nurse Helen Corey (Jacqueline Pierreux) receiving a weird phone call late at night. It seems an old medium died and her servant is too scared to move the body. Corey agrees to help the superstitious assistant but makes the mistake of stealing a valuable ring off the corpse. What follows is classic chills and thrills as a fly follows Corey around wherever she goes, continually alighting on the ring on her finger. The nurse tries to hide in her house where the sound of dripping water drives her to the point of insanity. Again, no reason to spoil the film for you, but wait until you see what happens to Nurse Corey as the tale winds to a close. Note to self: never steal anything from a deceased psychic.
All I can say here is that Mario Bava has done it again. While I still think ""Black Sunday"" is a better film, ""Black Sabbath"" nicely delivers the shocks. Getting Karloff to do double duty as the narrator and the star of one of the segments was a nice touch, too. Including this great actor in the project gives ""Black Sabbath"" a sort of homage feel, a nod to the earlier horror movies of the 1930s and 1940s. It's no mistake that Karloff's segment is the best one of the three. The weakest is ""The Telephone,"" although even this tale works quite well in the suspense department. In ""The Wurdulak,"" you know what's going to happen, but not so in ""The Telephone."" Plus, Michele Mercier is extremely easy on the eyes. I couldn't help but think of the seminal ""Black Christmas"" and ""When a Stranger Calls"" after watching ""The Telephone."" I wonder if Bob Clark and Fred Walton took Bava's creation as the inspiration for their own, later films. As for ""The Drop of Water,"" well, it's a scary film that doubtless inspired its own imitators years later.
Horror fans would be remiss to pass up this delightful collection. They're not gory in any way, just as ""Black Sunday"" wasn't gory, but they are nicely done pieces well worth watching. A big thanks goes out to Image Entertainment for releasing the film in its original format. I am slowly working my way through all of Mario Bava's film, and ""Black Sabbath"" was a huge step towards completing my journey. After watching the movie, check out the production notes assembled by Bava historian Tim Lucas, the trailer, and the Bava biography. If you like horror, you will definitely want to give this one a few hours of your time.",1086480000,3,5521,4.752083333333333
957692,5,630506685X,"With out a doubt, the best horror film ever made.  Bava's Black Sabbath, is without question the most complete horror experience ever filmed. With atmosphere like I've never seen, this trilogy starts off with a classic giallo, and progresses to sheer terror by the last installment.  Words alone cannot describe  ""The Drop of Water"", a dark, eerie, and ultimately terrifying experince.  If the face of death does not make you cringe, nothing will ever affect you!  Do yourself a favor and buy this film(the Italian version), shut the lights off and let the terror begin.",1079654400,5,570,4.957894736842105
957693,4,630506685X,"One of the best Italian horror films ever made, director Mario Bava's 1963 movie BLACK SABBATH (Italian title: I TRE VOLTI DELLA PAURA) is actually a delicious trilogy of stories, each different in timbre and texture, but each a masterful atmospheric study in unmitigated fear.
In the first short, entitled ""The Telephone,"" a contemporary (circa 1960s) woman is taunted by a series of bizarre and alarming phone calls.  But things get really interesting when she learns who it is that's been calling. (Warning: Some viewers may be put off by the lesbian subtext of this story.)
""The Wurdalak,"" the second entry, is an eerie variation on the vampire legend that is based on the Aleksei Tolstoy novella THE FAMILY OF THE VOURDALAK (SEM'YA VURDALAKA). The action takes place in what appears to be medieval Europe, and the celebrated Boris Karloff (alas, with his dialogue dubbed in Italian) turns in an excellent performance as Gorca, the patriarch of a peasant family.  When Gorca returns from assisting in the pursuit and destruction of a Wurdalak--a vampire of sorts that is compelled to feast only upon its own loved ones--his family suspects that he's not quite the man he used to be....
Purportedly an adaptation of story by Chekhov, ""A Drop of Water"" is the last entry of the trilogy, and it is unquestionably the creepiest.  Set in a Victorian manor house, it involves a private nurse who steals a ring from her recently deceased charge and is subsequently haunted by the vengeful corpse.  Or is she?
The acting is good, the sets are sufficiently eerie, the stories are well written and creepy, and the women are pretty. But first and foremost, BLACK SABBATH is a superior horror film due to Bava's great vision and direction.  He knows what it takes to scare people, and it is his use of stark yet simple imagery, unusual juxtaposition of sounds, and sometimes tenebrous lighting that generates genuine goose bumps and psychological jitters.  (Your skin will crawl every time you remember the image of that corpse with the empty, unblinking stare from ""A Drop of Water."")
Extant copies of the film are in one of two forms.  One presents the film as originally intended (and released in Europe) by the filmmakers.  The dialogue is completely dubbed in Italian (with English subtitles available), the stories have not been edited by anyone other than the director and his crew, and the three stories as a whole are vignetted by a Boris Karloff preface and epilogue.  However, the other version presents the film after it was vitiated by its U.S. distributor, American International Pictures. In that one, the stories have been edited (one to the point of being unintelligible) and their relative order rearranged, and inappropriately witty intros (featuring Karloff) have been tacked on to each.  Also, an English soundtrack has been added, one that was not created with any input from Bava or the original scriptwriters.
Until recently, the AIP re-dubbed re-cut was the only version of the film readily available to American audiences.  Though not a totally un-watchable film in AIP's butchered format, it is simply not the masterpiece that Bava's original is.  With that in mind, it is recommended that, if at all possible, viewers avoid the AIP version altogether and watch only the original Italian version. And please note, then, that this review refers to that original release--with English subtitles--which IS the version now being offered on the Image Entertainment DVD.
And speaking of the DVD, it is a bit short on true bonus features, and it is possible to see some signs of wear on the print that was used.  Still, this widescreen digital transfer looks good overall, with rich and vivid colors and crisp focus.  Most importantly, it is fantastic opportunity for American horror fans to finally see--and own!--this excellent scary film in the form in which its creators intended.",1069113600,27,3896,5.001545595054096
957750,5,630506685X,"This trilogy of terror stars and is narrated by the late Boris Karloff.  It would be tame by today's standards; some younger people might say ""lame"", but this was pre-""Jason"" (Friday the 13th), pre-""Freddy"" (Nightmare On Elm Street) and relied more on ""suspense"" than gore.  Interesting for those who like ""suspense"".",1062979200,2,317,5.196078431372549
957751,4,630506685X,"""Vampires look perfectly normal... except they have a strange habit of drinking blood, especially the blood of those they love.""  So says Boris Karloff, who appears in front of a set with reddish rocks and a sky that has blue swirling patterns. Presumably, his Italian dialogue was dubbed in, and well so, I might add.
These three brief tales of terror and the supernatural are based on stories by Anton Chekhov, Guy de Maupassant, and Count Aleksei Tolstoy.  The first, Il Telefono, is about Rosy, played by the lovely Michelle Mercier, who is being repeatedly threatened over the phone by her ex-lover, who intends to kill her.  He seems to know her every move, as he identifies what she's wearing and what she did inbetween calls.  Frantic, she calls for her friend Mary, with whom she had a falling out, to come over.  This one's more a suspense one, with elements of Hitchcock.
I Wurdalak is based on Tolstoy's most famous short story, ""The Family of Vourdalak"" (1847).  In the dark evening out on the moors, Count Vladimir d'Urfe comes across a headless body with an ornate dagger in its back.  He comes to a household whose members are awaiting the return of their father with dread.  According to them, the father went out hunting for a Turkish mass murderer, Alibeq, who happened to be a wurdalak, i.e. a vampire.  Vladimir falls in love with one of the sisters, the icy blonde Sdenska.  Then, the creepy aged father, played by none other than Karloff himself, returns, and after that, things start happening.  Eerie, down to the lightning and thunder, creaking lanterns and steps, and a dramatic, perhaps a bit overly so, score, this isn't at all bad.
La Goccia D'Acqua (The Drop Of Water) is probably the best of the three, as it is conventional horror.  A trained nurse is dragged out of her house in the late evening by a housekeeper whose mistress, an aged countess dabbling in fortune-telling, has died.  The disgruntled nurse, who is sent to dress the corpse in a burial gown, then sees a ring on the corpse's finger and steals it.  Once back at her house, she slowly goes mad--think of how a dripping sink can make one go around the bend.  The Countess's corpse is one of the scariest I've seen in movies, not bad for 1963.
Karloff then comes back in his costume from the second story and signs off, -- this really deserves a groan -- ""Dream about me.  We'll become friends."" COR-ny!  Yet, Bava really works at gaining a haunting, suspenseful atmosphere in each of the stories.",1058745600,2,2494,4.670480549199085
957752,4,630506685X,"Yes, as a trilingual, it is quite clear that the main actors in this film were not even originally speaking in Italian (from their lips I see French and English) so therefore we are actually hearing a ""dubbed"" italian dialogue.

Having grown up with the ""beefed up"" AIP version in the States-I now think I prefer that version just for the loss of the English voice track and introductions by Boris Karloff.

As it turns out, however, the ""bastardized"" American version previously available on tape is the superior one.  In fact, just about every decision AIP (American International Pictures)made when they proceeded with their tampering was the right one.  First, they put the episodes in an order that worked better for the momentum of the picture. ""The Drop of Water"" is a short, scary, atmospheric shocker.  Next up is the weakest segment, ""The Telephone"", giving audiences a breather. Saving the best for last is ""The Wurdalak"".  Some cinephiles also berated the American's for subsituting a new score by Les Baxter.  Though admittedly lacking in subtlety, Baxter's score at least feels like it belongs in a horror movie.  The anemic Italian music feels like it could have strayed in from some mediocre historical drama.  Most reprehensible about the DVD, however, is its failure to preserve Boris Karloff's glorious voice.  I know his voice was dubbed for Italian audiences, but would it be asking too much to loop in his voice on an alternate audio track---especially when so many other quality DVD firms (Anchor Bay Entertainment for instance)would surely do so?  As for the transfer, technical credits are good.  And this may be the only way to see a pristine print of this marvelous film.  Still a big disappointment and definitely a BARE BONES DVD.

 This is, IMO, the best horror anthology ever. It is beautifully shot by Mario Bava (Mirroring the Poe/Corman productions of the time), has effective tales (""The Telephone"" was hugely ripped-off by movies like ""Scream"" and ""When A Stranger Calls"", and ""The Drop Of Water"" is scary as hell, even for today), and nice music (Which is basically a reworked version of the ""Black Sunday"" music.
  Image presents this gem in it's original European version, which is 10 times better than the terrible American version that A.I.P released in US teathers back in 1963. Altrough the American verion IS a good movie, it had the following list of ""What you should not do while editing  a movie"":
  -Gore and shocking images were cut.
  -The stories were rearrenged, making the movie start with the strongest tale (In anthologies, the stronger tale should always be the last one).
  -The ""Telephone"" segment was turned from a sensual suspenseful short thriller to a cheesy ghost story because it had some lesbian sub-plot (Coudn't they just change the lesbian thing on the dubbing?).
  Now, it did have some good points:
  -Extra-footage in ""The Telephone"" segment involving a man and his dog.
  -Extra introductions by Kalloff.
  Kalloff fans will be disapointed to know that the movie is presented in Itallian only, but I prefer it this way than with the poor English dubbing (See the ""Black Sunday"" DVD to see how ""good"" Italians dubbed their films in English). Besides, the american version of this movie should have never existed. It's just like removing nudity from Rodan paintings.
  Picture: Good. There is a lot of spectacles, but the piscture looks great with very strong colors and detailed fragments.
  Sound: Average. It's 1.0, but I wasn't expecting Dolby Digital 5.1. Good for a 40 year old movie.
  Extras: Good for such a forgotten film.

957757,4,630506685X,"Back in '63,when i was 9 years old, mommie dearest dropped me off at our neighborhood theater to see BLACK SABBATH. About 10 minutes after the picture started I mad a frantic dash for the exit; I had never been so frightened by a movie in my life. The movie opened with Boris Karloff introducing three tales of terror. The first one was called ""A Drop of Water"". It concerned a woman who gets a phone call late at night; she is asked to go prepare a corpse for burial. When she arrives, she is greeted by a spooked housekeeper who is bababling about a witches, evil and dying while in a trance. The coprse is an awful looking thing that resembles a cheap doll with most of it's substance sucked out; and it grins with an evil, knowing smile. On the corpse's finger there is a ring the woman wants. After she steals it, the coprse's glare seems to be saying to the woman that ""YOU REALLY SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT"". During all this a glass of water is overturned and Mario Bava's camera focuses on the dripping water. Once she gets home she is bothered by the sound of dripping water which creeps her out because it sounds like the water in the witches apartment. Then the lights go out. When she catches a glimpse of the corpse in her apartment I ran for the exit as fast as my legs would carry me. Last night I was able to watch the rest of the movie. Although the movie didn't scarce me as bad this time, I was able to appriciate how well it was made. IMAGE entertainment presents the origianl Italian version with English subtitles. (It's strange to see Boris Karloff dubbed into Italian). The order of the movies have changed. The picuture is widesreened and sharp; audio is excellent. ""A Drop of Water"" by far the best story of the trio. It's full of atmospheric mystery with images that are the stuff nightmares are made of and is the best thing Mairo Bava ever did. There are two other stories which are good but not as effective. The first has a hot looking Italian babe in plauged by threatening phone call.

957758,3,630506685X,"Aaah, it's a Mario Bava movie! That's always a guarantee for visual pleasure. And that's
exactly the way with this film. ""The Wurdalak"" is one of three stories from his well-known film ""Three faces of fear/Black Sabbath"".
The two other episodes aren't of any interest by vampiric means, but this one is great!! Featuring horror legend Boris Karloff
(Frankenstein), dimmed in blue colors, it tells a tragic tale about love beyond the grave. Very stimulating snack for more!...",1016150400,,475,5.102564102564102
957759,3,630506685X,"This DVD is rated 3 stars because the soundtrack is very, very low in volume.  The picture is very good -- not superb, but it's a very good presentation by Image Entertainment.
Be sure that you take note:  this film is in Italian language only.  That did not bother me nearly as much as having to blast my speakers up at full volume in order to hear the DVD.  I would have given the DVD 4 stars, possibly 5 stars if it had better sound and if all three episodes were top notch.
What I really like about the Bava films are the women.  Once again, he has sexy, beautiful women that are very provocative.  Their costumes are usually revealing which is more sensual than today's nude scenes.  If you don't get excited by the way Bava films women, check your pulse.
""The Telephone"" and ""The Drop of Water"" are both excellent episodes.  ""The Telephone"" is the sensual one, a short movie that will make you smack your lips.  ""The Drop of Water"" is horrifying and you'll shrink back during the conclusion of this DVD.
""The Wurdulak"", alas, is my least favorite of the three as it has only one absolutely chilling scene.  Again, the women look splendid but that is really the only benefit.
I'm really glad I purchased this DVD [...].  I will probably play ""The Telephone"" and ""The Drop of Water"" to death, so it's a good thing DVD's last forever!",1012003200,,1337,4.438524590163935
957820,1,630506685X,"The American version besides being absolutely the best version of BLACK SABBATH is also the original. Despite what the editorial reviewer says this movie was originally filmed in English. Don't believe me? Turn the sound down and read their lips. Taking a movie that was acted in one language and then dubbing it into another language is what I call ""butchered"". And Boris Karloff just doesn't seem the same dubbed and subtitled. And the butchering doesn't end there... They also changed the music and sound effects taking away much of the film's classic horror atmosphere. (BIG MISTAKE!) They changed the order of the stories which didn't seem to work as well. And they chopped out all of the funny Twilght Zone type intros that Karloff did for each story.  I like the intros and missed seeing them. For all these reasons I don't recommend buying the widescreen Italian version. Get the real one. That's the 5 star Black Sabbath.",1007683200,5,930,4.849056603773585
957821,5,630506685X,"I don't think that we are fully aware of the luck we have today to rediscover the movies of Mario Bava in the DVD standard. Only Jackie Chan and maybe Jean-Claude Van Damme have had until now the honour to see their almost complete filmographies being digitalized. I still remember the numerous hours I've spent in fly markets in order to find horrible VHS copies of the movies of the italian maestro.
So thank you Image and Tim Lucas for presenting today BLACK SABBATH aka THE THREE FACES OF FEAR in a sumptuous copy. Just look at these scenes filmed under a psychedelical lightning, really astonishing. Each three segments is a pure marvel. "" The Telefon "" is a lesson of cinema by a director with no budget but with thousands of ideas. You will discover how to create uneasiness and terror in a locked room with the sole power of sound and images. Great job of french starlet Michle Mercier also.
The second segment - The Wurdulak - is a little gothic masterpiece with Boris Karloff as a hungry father looking for blood. Count how many scenes or ideas have inspired today horror director who - one must admit it - haven't invented anything. In the last segment - The Drop of Water - , Mario Bava used a mask created by his own father that is really very disturbing. Beware, Rob Bottin and others...
In short, this movie is essential for any serious movie lover's collection and I don't think that the italian version presented could be an argument to avoid this DVD. With the movies of Mario Bava, you can't speak of an original version and dubbed versions that are less authentic. Bava used in the same movie italian, french and american actors who didn't understand each other and spoke their own language during the shooting. So, in my opinion, the italian version is as much interesting as the american version. OK, Boris Karloff is dubbed in italian but in "" The Telefon "", Michle Mercier was clearly dubbed and nobody is arguing.

957823,5,630506685X,The Drop of water is the scariest Segment. The story was scary and the dead Womans face was so scary and horrible.

957825,4,630506685X,"IMAGE has done a fine job with this DVD release of the orignal italian version of Bava's horror masterpiece, but it is still lacking in a few  important aspects (at least in my opinion).  First of all, the film looks  absolutely INCREDIBLE -- the colors are completely vibrant - reds, greens,  blues, oranges, purples - if you thought ""Suspiria"" was colorful,  you ain't seen nuthin' yet!  You can easily see where Argento was  influenced by this and other Bava works.  It's great to have the film with  it's original score, with the stories in the correct order, and without the  changes AIP made to it in the US.
However, my problem with the DVD is  related to just that.  Because the film is only presented in the italian  version, we lose all of the real english-speaking voice of the great Boris  Karloff (not to mention Mark Damon).  Maybe with other actors it would be  more forgivable, but Karloff's voice is sorely missed (especially in the  Wurdalak story) and the dubbing of him almost feels sacriligious.  The  prologue and epilogue (new to the US) features the dubbed Karloff, but the  old AIP inter-segments featuring him are now missing completely (shot later  by another director).
OK, I understand why it's not all  here...AIP-ORION-MGM must own the American version and these segments, but  it sure would have been nice to have them on this as an extra.  And even  if the extra Karloff segments couldn't be used, an English track with  Karloff's voice should have been included.  So it's a great DVD of this  version of the film, but I'm still holding on to my old VHS of the US  version for Karloff and his voice.",965865600,11,1632,4.667844522968198
957826,4,630506685X,"Mario Bava's BLACK SABBATH (original Italian title--THE THREE FACES OF FEAR) is easily one of my favorite DVD releases this year, both in terms of  the new transfer and the film itself.
Like Bava's earlier BLACK SUNDAY,  this film was re-edited by AIP for its American release, and it is that  version which we've always seen in the US. The original Italian version  plays the episodes in a different order: ""The Telephone,""  ""The Wurdalak"" and ""The Drop of Water."" The lesbian  content of ""The Telephone"" was of course toned down for American  audiences. It also has a prologue and epilogue which are different from  those shot for the American release. You may find that the comic epilogue  doesn't fit with the rest of the picture, but I enjoyed its  self-deprecating humor. The original score by Roberto Nicolosi supports the  mood of the film better than Les Baxter's AIP score and it subtly ties the  three episodes together through recurring thematic material. If you've only  seen this film in the AIP version, you really owe it to yourself to see the  original Italian version-there IS a difference.
The letterboxed DVD  transfer looks beautiful. The print is worn in places, but the colors are  vivid and the rich details of the set design come through. Having known the  film only from a cropped VHS transfer, watching the DVD was like seeing a  new film altogether. Indeed, Bava's masterful use of lighting, color and  camera movement, his eye for dramatic detail, only confirms what a  brilliant director he was. From a purely stylistic standpoint, this is one  of the great horror films. Tim Lucas, as usual, provides informative liner  notes.",965174400,8,1657,4.906137184115524
957827,4,630506685X,"This one was on television when I was just eight or ten years old. I haven't seen it in a long time but I can still remember nearly scene. It starts off with Boris, introducing himself and telling me about Ghosts  sitting next to me in the cinema.(Why not?) Then ""Wurdelak""  begins, a classic vampire tale, settled in eastern Europe ( I think so  because the name ""Wurdelak"" comes from there ). It has a great  atmosphere and the design and the photography are all wonderful. ""The  Waterdrop"" is a Ghost Story about a Nurse that got the bad idea of  stealing a ring from the corpse of a dead Spiritualist. I had nightmares  for the next half year - and now I got some questions: who's the person  that created the mask on the dead woman's face ? why hasn't he won an oscar  for one of the scariest designs ever? who can tell me this? However, this  one really got me hiding under my bed. ""The Telephone"" is why I  haven't rated this one with 5 stars. It isn't as scary and creepy as the  two others, maybe they should have started the movie with this story. It  isn't about ghosts, there aren't any supernatural beings in there, it could  have been on ""X-Factor"" or something like that.
