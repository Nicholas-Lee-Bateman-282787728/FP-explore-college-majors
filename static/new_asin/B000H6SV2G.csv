8137290,2,B000H6SV2G,"I enjoyed the training, however have had run ins with Dan over the years and he has proven to me to be a total jerk. When I purchased the Lightwave course ware he promised there would be an upcoming free upgrade with all kinds of new content. After about 6 months I wrote him and he basically wrote back that he was busy on other projects. Subsequent emails have not been answered. I had a similar experience a few years back with a magazine that he had. I purchased a subscription and half way through they went out of business. I tried calling, and when they answered and I asked about a refund the whole room full of people started laughing and hung up on me. Emails again were never returned. While Dan is a good teacher, and the courseware is decent (although limited in scope), just know when you are buying from him that the customer service will be abhorrent, and don't believe any promises for future benefits. I would give the training a strong three or even a weak four, but the service makes it hard to give any rating over a two.",1268956800,,1042,4.348717948717948
8137291,5,B000H6SV2G,"After viewing about 20 mins of these videos I felt completely engulfed by not only the content presented, but the way it was presented. Dan is a true peoples teacher, who 'right from the start' keeps you interested in the material. Most importantly he also shows you in a way where you understand what he's saying completely and you feel yourself getting motivated to get into the program right away to do what he just did!!!!
I just purchased Inside Lightwave V9 and I'm looking forward to watching the rest of this DVD along with going through the manual to become a master Lightwave Artist. Thanks Dan! I can't express how much appreciation I have toward you for sharing your expertise.",1186099200,2,689,4.702479338842975
8137292,5,B000H6SV2G,"I'm giving Dan's spectacular courseware a 5 star review, as the final verdict in anything here is obviously the content.  While he covers the basics of the the interface with lightwave in the first 7 or 8 movies before actually getting us into a project, he makes it seem just so much fun. Dan is a charming, witty teacher that can make looking at the different settings of Lightwave a blast to cover. There's a raw, very live feel to his presentations, as he calls out when he's making a mistake, when his computer is hanging, or some random comments.  However, it gives it that vibe of being taught in a J.C. Night course, because those things would obviously happen in real life. In the end, you get a lot of information that is pretty critical in understanding the software, but would have been skipped over due to it being boring to read about in the manual (and trust me, Lightwave has one of THE most boring Manuals I've ever read).",1171411200,4,939,4.485380116959064
