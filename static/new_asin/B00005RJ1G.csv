1655902,5,B00005RJ1G,"This is a challenging power yoga workout.  Baron warms you up with a long standing forward bend.  Then you jump right into a series of upward and downward facing dog poses which will quickly raise your heart rate and warm you right up.  Later you move into some other challenging poses like the eagle pose, tree pose, camel, and crescent moon.  Baron's cueing is very good.  He walks you through the poses and always reminds you to only go as far as you can go.  The only pose I could not do at all was the backward bend where you go all the way back and only have your hands and feet touching the floor.  The workout ends with floorwork (but you still won't get a break until you reach the final relaxation pose).  The cobra pose is included in this section to work your back, and a slow motion bicycle exercise works your obliques.  This workout moves quickly.  It requires a lot of balance, and you will feel your leg muscles working throughout the workout.  Many of the poses incorporate lunges, squats, and balancing on one leg.  I definitely think that this video will increase both your strength and your flexibility.  This video was originally produced in 1998, and it does not have the highest production quality (the picture is not as crisp or clear as it could be).  The only other minor detail that I did not like was the fact that everyone was wearing white, I prefer a little color or a more exciting background.  Other than that I think this is a great workout for intermediate/advanced exercisers.",1053216000,11,1513,4.531365313653136
1655903,3,B00005RJ1G,"This is a good challenging workout, but a little fast-paced, and not always sufficienttly explained.
The balancing series was a particular problem, and could have been slowed down to help explain the moves and improve your concentration.
The students in the tape were also falling down.  Not surprisingly from viewing his other tapes, he would use these episodes as an opportunity to touch them in areas generally considered a bit personal (which may be the reason that they all looked so tense).
And, (although I know reviewers aren't supposed to get personal)  does his really need that silly get-up he's wearing on his head?
He could also drop the yogababble to make time for some practical information on beginner's modifications of the more difficult positions, so that people don't get hurt.",1026000000,8,797,5.076335877862595
1655904,5,B00005RJ1G,"First of all - thank you to the reviewer who wrote a review for Power yoga 3 - that's what made me finally buy this - once she didn't say it was blurred!  To everyone out there who thinks these tapes are blurred and are bad quality - ie who read the same article I did on another site - yes, it's a Goodtime tape, but no, it's not blurred at all.  The quality is just fine!
Now - workout.  Phew.  this must be his toughest, it'/s definitely his longest.  At just under 70 minutes it's longer than soul of strength at about 53 mins and Power and PRecision at about 63 including breathing exercises.  46 minutes standing poses followed by 18 minutes floor poses.  Intense.  After the usual sunsalutation A and B opener - which seems to go for ever - he goes on to warriors, side angles and so on - and intersperes sun salutes in between.  It never lets up.  Definitely more intense than Soul of Strength - also has some different asanas - like sideways stretch, lots of standing backbends, a tiptoes pose I found quite challenging and so on.
In a way i understand the reviewer on another website who said she prefers his newer series - He is smoother, in a good way - his whole attitude is more relaxed, more philosophical perhaps - the music is MUCH better - and even though his new series is tough, the feel is more relaxed - overall  (plus I love those lunge prayer twists which are not in this video).  Although that sounds wierd, because it is a tough tape.  However this is fabulous to alternate with - for days with more stamina - and is more challenging, and a satisfaction when you finish!",1021593600,25,1596,4.315436241610739

Will purchase a third for another daughter",1360540800,,120,3.84
1655936,3,B00005RJ1G,"Not in love w/ this workout. I pulled this one out after many years, thought I'd give it another crack. There are many balancing poses, so if that's your thing, you'll like it. I wish there was more of a flow/standing poses. Tons of isometric work. No plow, no half moon, no twisting triangle, not many twists at all, and the standing poses that are done are held for a VERY short time. YAWWWWN. Yeah, so it's okay, but I might be selling mine or giving it away to make room for another DVD. Oh, the only reason I sweat at all was because I turned up my heat (IN HOUSTON SUMMER) to 86 degrees.

Wasn't annoyed w/ Baron or the participants...it's totally 90s! I wish one of them had rocked a thong bodysuit with some spandex shorts like I did back in the day.",1342828800,,758,4.227586206896552
1655937,5,B00005RJ1G,I love it.  I am a fan of Baron Baptiste Yoga and this is no different. I love it!,1293148800,,82,3.3157894736842106
1655938,2,B00005RJ1G,"i absolutley love baron baptiste power yoga. i didn't like this particular video at all, though. this is formatted like an old style workout where everyone is dressed the same and very conforming. i much prefer the more recent videos where it is more like a true class you would attend. i will definately stick to my other 3 videos i have of his!",1271894400,2,346,4.421875
1655939,5,B00005RJ1G,"I have all three of the Baron Baptiste Power yoga DVD's.  I especially love the Level 1 and Level 2 DVDs.  The initial Challange is a great all body workout and is only 45 minutes which makes it easy to fit into a busy schedule.  ""The next Challange"", level 2 is 90 minutes and is similar to a ""hot yoga"" studio workout.  I love these DVD's so much I have several sets that So I can have access to these workouts wherever I go.  I have also recommended these videos to numerous friends.  I think these yoga workouts are every bit as good a work out as going to a Yoga studio with the benifit of never leaving your home.",1251936000,2,619,4.116666666666666
1655940,4,B00005RJ1G,"I really like this DVD. The routine is very similar to the yoga studios that I prefer. However, it is very long and I usually choose it when I don't have 1-2 hours to dedicate to a real yoga class. I would give it 5 stars but I wish that I could skip through the beginning and turn down the lame music.

I would not recommend this for a beginner. Viewers should be familiar w/ all the  vinyasa/ashtanga poses. I highly recommend beginning at a studio w/ an experienced teacher that can adjust your form for the safest, most efficient stretches. Otherwise, you could seriously hurt yourself.",1247875200,,590,4.5046728971962615
1655941,1,B00005RJ1G,"I was very dissappointed with this tape, this was not the power yoga  I was looking for. Pretty boring, sorry.",1247011200,,110,4.5
1655942,4,B00005RJ1G,This dvd offers a very well rounded yoga practice for beginner + enthusiasts. After 2 years of yoga I found Baron's cuing and approach enabled me to begin mastering the balancing poses. Good warm up and flow holding the poses for an appropriate length of time.  The 70 minutes goes by very quickly.,1234828800,,298,4.622641509433962
1655943,4,B00005RJ1G,"Great video. I first discovered the video at my library but it's great as a reintroduction after a few weeks off and as a variation to maintaining my practice when I'm consistent.

I do think Baron could do a better job with holding sides for the equal amount of time which doesn't always happen, but that's what the pause button is for.

Work out for the yoga lover that wants a cardio blast and enjoys building heat for a more fluid practice!",1226275200,2,444,4.402439024390244
1655944,4,B00005RJ1G,"the videos are easy to follow, they helped my low back pain, gave me peace of mind to start my work day, didn't see any weight loss",1187913600,,131,3.888888888888889
1655965,4,B00005RJ1G,"Simply one of the best complete yoga programs out there. It is tough and you will see results! If you can keep up and commit. Its is just a bit long, well over an hour. you will be totally workedOUT when you are done! Its great, the time limitation is the only reason I dont' use it as much as the others that I have.",1177027200,,317,3.8923076923076922
1655966,5,B00005RJ1G,"In order to understand this set, one must know the origins of how Baron Baptiste developed this classic hatha/power yoga fusion.  There is no randomness in this sequence.  Realize, Baron studied under Bikram Choudhury, the man who has set up ""hot yoga"" centers across America.  The exact sequence of 26 poses Bikram uses came from his teacher, Bishnu Ghosh, the younger brother of Paramahausa Yogananda (author of ""Autobiography of a Yogi"").  In classic hatha yoga, there is a theory of perfecting the diamond body in order to perfect the clarity of the mind.  What Baptiste did was take the Bikram system and link it to vinyasa in order to give it fluidity.  In the Bikram system there is an emphasis on will, focus, and concentration which occurs through the mastering of the single leg standing poses.  There is also a theory that these poses should be done twice to be effective. Baptiste precedes this sequence with three A salutations and four B (using a crescent lunge) to generate strength and heat before the classic hot yoga set begins.  He also modifies the sitting poses by adding crunches and wheel.  Somehow he knows intuitively how to pace a workout.  Whereas his ""Long and Lean"" or ""Journey into Power"" DVD's are slower, more suited to power yoga poses, this tape moves quickly to fuse an aerobic quality to an emphasis on pure concentration and focus.  What is amazing about this workout are the results.  My endurance and ability to handle all or any daily pressure or activity is amazingly increased.  Instead of merely pumping the body with hard lunge combinations or anti-gravity poses, strength is being simultaneously enhanced while the mind must focus on balance and maintaining proper form.  Bikram understood the power of this in his set, but only Baron Baptiste evolved this principle with the fluidity of the Astanga style vinyasa to make this the most unique and significant DVD money can buy.  Aesthetics aside, this is truly a magical sequence.",1162512000,23,1975,4.924471299093655
1655967,5,B00005RJ1G,"I am a personal trainer and owner of a fitness studio who has tried many yoga classes and dvd's, and I love Baron Baptiste's style of teaching more than any class or dvd I have tried.  This is definitely not a beginner level workout, and it's not going to give you the ""new age zen yoga experience"" that many do.  But if you are a ""type A"" exerciser like myself and many of my clients, and you love a hard workout that makes you sweat, such as kickboxing, running, or weight training, Baron's style will appeal to you more than other teacher's styles.  Yes, he does talk thru the video, however, he is giving excellent form and cueing advice that is necessary to achieving correct alignment and form.  I recently purchased a yoga video by Shiva Rea, who came highly recommended to me by several yoga instructors, and was quite disappointed, as I felt the workout wasn't quite athletic enough and too ""zen"" for me and she did not give enough instruction and moved thru the posed quickly.  Baron's workout level 2 and level 3, which is the primary series of ashtanga yoga, move at a good pace, are challenging, but do not include arm balances and several of the more difficult poses that one finds in an ashtanga workout.  Beryl Bender Birch, for example, has a wonderful ashtanga power yoga dvd, but it moves at a fast pace, without as much instruction, and includes very challenging arm balances and headstands, which are definitely for the advanced yoga practitioner.  This is a great workout for those who have done beginning yoga and are looking for a great stretch, and the next step in power yoga.  I use power level 2 as a workout on my off days from running and weight training, as it provides a great stretch for my muscles and joints.",1102982400,75,1743,4.546325878594249
1655968,5,B00005RJ1G,"This is a 70 minutes workout, it's actually a re-release of the ""hot yoga"" series , I bought level 2 because I've read it's more advanced than level 3 which I haven't tried. It is a little bit challenging and reminds me his ""soul of strength"" video except there are  50 minutes of standing poses!
Some reviewers said this is a bad quality video which is not quite true, but I agree it's not the best production, the music is a little bit chessy but if you're focusing in your practice it's shouldn't bother you!",1078963200,2,511,4.378947368421053
1655969,4,B00005RJ1G,"I am an advanced beginner and just love yoga.  I borrowed this from a friend and I thought it was great!  It was a bit over an hour, it allowed me to push myself to the edge, and most importantly, covered a lot of poses that will help me to the next level.  My weaknesses are the standing balancing poses and I was very glad to see a segement on this.  Yes, I would much rather watch him doing it rather than the students, but I did find his talking actually helped me with proper form and to maintain the form.  Just like they do in a real class. There is no doubt you will build your strength on this one.  To me that is important so I can progress.",1076025600,19,651,3.9692307692307693
1655970,3,B00005RJ1G,"I needed a yoga dvd quick and grabbed this one, without investigating him. While I do feel peaceful after, and stronger, I would've felt more peaceful if he was quieter. He chatters nonstop, even during the corpse posture! Everything constantly goes back to the Sun Salutation constantly. Some of the asanas are too easy, and some too hard. While he does tell you there are variations, they are never demonstrated, so you can only imagine. He also calls plank asana ""the push-up position."" He does not even demonstrate the asanas, but tells a group of fit, slim Yoga students (and occasionally adjusting them) while walking around in just white shorts. He also claps often to signal that the position is over. While it is a decent workout, I have a feeling that after owning this DVD for a while, it will sit on my shelf for only occasional use.",1075075200,7,845,4.677852348993288
1655971,1,B00005RJ1G,"I purchased this because I had viewed the PBS Journey Into Power program and was intrigued.  The DVD is a Goodtimes production and the first  part of the ""program"" is a commercial for their other products. You can't just skip to the workout, which I found annoying. The actual practice begins with Baron explaining how yoga will improve your life,etc. Again, you can't skip ahead here, either. When the practice actually starts, it turns out to be a set, with everyone ( all under 25 yrs. and very fit)  in white Danskin yoga-gear.  The music is eighties - ish and as loud as Baron is, so it's distracting. No one appears to be doing any modifications so those just beginning may injure themselves trying to keep up.
 If  you're looking for a 'power yoga'  practice that you can grow with, I highly recommend David Swenson's Short Forms tape or DVD (also available at amazon) as the best to begin with. It has three workouts that are suitable for the beginner and the advanced practitioner, and a great guided relaxation. His book is a must have, too. The Flow series, featuring Tracey Rich and Ganga White, is also an excellent production that is beautifully produced, can be tailored to your level and never gets 'old'.",1068163200,20,1221,4.677570093457944
1655972,5,B00005RJ1G,"This is the longest of the three-part Baptiste ""Power Yoga"" series, and the most challenging.  It starts with a warming flow series, moves into some twisting, balancing and lunging poses and ends with some core power and relaxation work.  It is fairly intense, but not quite as leg-burning as Bryan Kest's tapes.  There is more emphasis on balancing poses rather than muscle power poses, but it will still work your entire body thoroughly.  The tape may feel long to some people, especially those new to yoga, but this is a great tape and a joy to practice.",1062633600,6,557,4.711340206185567

I started this video 9 months out from having a baby, and it got me into pretty good shape. I was strong. I couldn't even get thru 15 minutes for a week or two. I finally worked up to about 3/4 of the video. It was intense for me.

7952518,5,B00005RJ1G,"I have all three of the power yoga series dvd's. My 1st introduction to yoga was level 1 ""the initial challenge"". in the beginning, not being used to the sun salutation, and standing poses sequence, I would get fatigued. I was always able to finish though. Level one was a nice way to prep for the next level. The flow, pace, and length of the routine is a nice change that gives me a challenge. I love the level of fitness I have attained through yoga practice. I consider my self to be athletic and in better than average shape, playing sports, running, biking, and weight training. Yoga practice has enhanced the quality of everything else I do. I feel more sharp at work, and in dealing with others. My posture has improved greatly. Learning to synchronize breath with the movements, gaining strength, and endurance while holding poses, and postures. Learning to be in control of the flow, through mind, and body is a challenge in every practice. I'm not interested in taking an actual class (at this time), because I like the comfort, and concentration I get being at home. This is a dvd I would recommend only after practicing yoga for a long enough time that your ready to take a new step. I also, would recommend Rodney Yee's videos as well. Between him and Baron, I have two master teachers at my finger tips. They both have there own style and flow, that make for challenging, yet fun workouts.
