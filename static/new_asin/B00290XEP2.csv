3875521,5,B00290XEP2,"Not sure why this only has one review on Amazon. I thought this driving DVD was excellent! It's not boring like a lot of the driving videos you watch for health class since it requires user interaction. It contains over 100 video scenarios which ask the viewer to either scan the scene (practice being aware of surroundings & using mirrors effectively), spot potential hazards, act (make good decisions), and drive (bring all skills together). The viewer accumulates points for driving errors and the goal is to end up with zero points (as per the DVD name, ZED = zero error driving). Wrong choices are followed up by brief explanations and videos of the consequences of those wrong choices. The videos are divided into 4 sections (highway, town, country, work zones) and there are about 20-30 videos in each section which the viewer has to work through in numerical order. Student progress is saved & automatically bookmarked if you exit and there is also the option to setup a user database for multiple users. Additional DVD features include instructor/parent/student guides, and a ""Perceptual Driving Module"" which appears to be for classroom teaching (slideshow).

There are some technical things to be aware of. Even though this is a DVD, you need a computer with a DVD-ROM to set up the program because it prompts you to install software. Min requirements are: Intel Pentium III 400 mhz processor, Windows 2000, 128 MB RAM, 120 MB free hard disk space, 1024 x 768 resolution at 24 bit, 1x DVD-ROM drive. You can see the AAA Foundation website or the Driver ZED website for a more complete manual with screenshots for installation and there is also a product demo so you can try the program out before you buy it.",1312848000,4,1719,4.827118644067797
3875522,4,B00290XEP2,"Bought for my daughter to view after she earned her driver's license. Can't just guess, she took her time to work through the videos and questions. Items on the work zone were especially helpful. After viewing the AT&T video on texting, this was well worth the cost.",1296950400,,266,4.680851063829787

8357289,4,B00290XEP2,"This DVD program was very helpful to me in driver's ed when I went, so I got it for my sister. It's probably not the most hi-def thing out there, but it's fairly instructive, and I really enjoyed it :) granted, it might not work for everyone, and it's definitely not going to guarantee that you pass your driving test, but it's kind of a fun way to learn about driving.",1393891200,,369,4.211267605633803

8357292,2,B00290XEP2,"Reviewed the system requirements before purchasing it and read the reviews. Despite this, it still is problematic on my son's modern PC. Have not been able to use all of the CD-ROM features due to these problems. Still problem-solving the issue but much of it has to do with screen resolution. Son is no stranger to computers so I am surprised we are experiencing these difficulties.",1384128000,,383,4.818181818181818
