8176149,2,B000FUTV32,"This weird little filmic exercise by ultra low budget schlockmeister Bill Zebub owes much of its' inspiration, I would imagine, to the (vastly superior) puppet epic ""Team America"" by the South Park crew.  Following a lengthy comedic 'disclaimer' at the outset of the flick the 'plot' essentially attempts to parody many mainstream Hollywood-isms, politics & religion, and to inject as many disturbing images of sexually mutilated Barbi dolls as possible. The 'actiing' is provided by a variety of 'action figure' toys that are manipulated (clunkily) by hand and via green screen superimpositions.  A 'little of this'  is amusing, but ultimately the concept runs out of gas and Zebub's ghoulish pre-occupation with the vilolent S&M imagery perpetuated on female dolls gets kind of creepy.  Still, there is some cleverness in the base concept which makes this satirical flik more engaging than many of Zebub's ostensibly more 'serious' efforts. I would recommend only buying this (if at all) at a minimal discounted (used) price as the content wouldn't likely stand up to multiple viewings.",1296777600,3,1088,5.308139534883721
8176150,1,B000FUTV32,"The movie is supposed to be a parody of the Italian cannibal jungle films ala Umberto Lenzi. It will probably amuse those who can't get a date and are stuck in their dorm, or cave but you'd be using your time more effectively if you counted out of town license plates in the mall parking lot.",1156636800,6,292,4.232142857142857
