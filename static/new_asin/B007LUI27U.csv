It starts out OK, then gets kinda boring, then later starts to pick up some pace, but then loses it with some cheesy pyrotechnics and boring over dramatization.",1345766400,,317,4.213114754098361

There was some good actor in the movie. I would say that this movie was above low buget so it's worth watching for $3 bucks. Three *** is about right.,1345593600,6,302,3.9672131147540983

This movie was boring, the cinematography stunk, and with about 15 minutes left I fell asleep. Oh yeah- I have never been so motivated to write a review. This is my first. A warning to you all!

Avoid.

5099044,5,B007LUI27U,Hey Everyone. I'm a huge Zombie fan and search all the time for great movies.  It's hard to find them!  This one is written well.  It has great acting and action and a good plot.  This one is not the average B film.  It is definitely worth watching. Watch it Zombie lover! You'll like it!

5099045,3,B007LUI27U,"3 stars = you probably won't love it, but it's not a total waste of time either.

Basic premise from 28 Days Later, Walking Dead, etc etc... survivors of a recent viral zombie apocalypse find each other and try to stay alive. Various interpersonal issues & secrets & accidents complicate things. This one doesn't try to be comedic or hit you over the head with some sociopolitical message, which is a nice change. It's not overly gory or violent (for a zombie movie, that is), and there really isn't even much in the way of jump scares.

The acting is hit and miss (the heavier the accent, the better). Some of the action sequences are hard to follow - there's a particularly poorly lit fight scene near the end. On the other hand, the sense of emptiness and desolation is pretty well done. When everything comes together, you can feel the lonely dread.

This is sort of an all-ages made-for-TV zombie film, extremely bland and unoriginal, but it's good enough to keep your interest and never bad enough to get frustrated with it. Ironically, it should be most satisfying to two opposite types of viewers: fans of the genre who just want a zombie movie they haven't seen yet, and non-fans who don't have much to compare it to.",1474848000,,1226,4.589041095890411

In this one, Luise Bahr maintains near perfect makeup all the time despite trying to stay alive, which is fine because she is very pretty. Similarly, the men manage to stay shaved all the time. Kudos to the gymnastic extras who were the fast zombies. At one point they were basically jumping over 6 foot fences. Pretty amazing skills, and it looked realistic.

5099125,4,B007LUI27U,"I love the way ""Extinction: The G.M.O. Chronicles"" starts out - making a phone call while driving, a man suddenly hits a person who darts out into the street. When going to help her, she attacks him. He escapes, but very quickly, notices violent mayhem all over the place. ""WTF"" is written all over his face. It reminded me of the early scene in the 2004 reboot of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" when Ana, after escaping her husband, is shocked by the insanely violent chaos which has broken out all over her neighborhood. Although on a much smaller scale in this film, it's still effective.
  After that, it slows down to become a serious, somber character study about a variety of survivors who gradually discover each other & band together to stay alive. It will be too slow for those who are expecting intense action horror & gore. There is some, but I doubt it will excite the adrenaline junkies. It is primarily a bleak film, sprinkled with glimmers of hope, yet no humor, intentional or not.
  The situation & characters are interesting. It's the kind of film that makes me wonder what I'd do in such a situation. I love movies that involve my mind. Several characters are dealing with their pasts, as well as their losses from the outbreak & the stress of bleak survival. The main character is particularly appealing. Even though it's an overdubbed German film, it's well acted by both the original cast & the overdub actors, so even though the mouths don't match the words, it works well enough.
  The cinematography is well done, emphasizing the grim circumstances. Most of the CGI is obvious & not very good, & the zombie makeup is mostly very poor, but I can forgive those things. The editing doesn't linger on those shortcomings, & because I'm not a nit-picker, it's not a big problem. I enjoyed the soundtrack, as well.
  I noticed a few scenes that are similar to some I've seen in other zombie flicks, but that, I think, is to be expected in such a heavily saturated genre.
  This is not a great film nor would I expect it to gain cult status, however I might consider it among the top 100 zombie films. Considering how many there have been in the last decade alone, that ain't bad.",1463529600,,2187,4.5561224489795915

5099133,2,B007LUI27U,"First of all, this review is for the European 2012 movie by Daniel Buder, not the 2015 American movie of the same name, by Miguel ngel Vivas. Amazon mistakenly has the credits for that film in place of the ones that should be there for Extinction v2012. With that cleared up...

This ""Extinction"" is your typical ""government screws up and unleashes virus that destroys humanity by turning people into zombies"" film. The plot is pretty standard: Those few people who are immune must try to survive the ever-growing (and in this case, ever-evolving) horrors, figure out what's going on, and find somewhere safe to live out the rest of their days. The group includes most of the ""sure, you'd find them anywhere"" folks always seen in horror movies: There's the reluctant, tortured hero; the man harboring a dark secret; the hero's potential love interest and her jealous boyfriend; the medical student who is smarter than she should be; the ""yes, we need his help but can we trust him?"" felon; the comic relief; and the antagonist who wants things done his way. The only ones missing are the token dummy or scared-to-death guy/gal who usually gets killed off in the first 20 minutes, the pothead who lasts about 21 minutes, and somebody who lives to drop their clothes or see that others do the same, and dies about 40 minutes in.

The fact that ""Extinction"" was made for a European audience is what caught my attention, as many of the movies from that continent tend to be better thought-out than what passes for horror in the U.S. these days. And in some ways, I was right. Some high points:

* Despite a now-cliche ""recorded for posterity"" opening, the first half hour of ""Extinction"" holds your interest. Even though you know what's coming next scene to scene, the pacing is just fast enough to where you still jump out of your seat from time to time.
* The film goes beyond just being a ""run for your life/blow everything up"" movie. There's enough character development to where you find yourself bummed whenever one of the central figures buys it. (I'm not giving anything away -- name a zombie-type movie from the last 20 years where at least one of the principal characters does not get killed off.)
* There's no sex, no nudity -- heck, not even any gratuitous ""what, now?"" kissing -- bogging down the story. There's also very little swearing. You're convinced of characters' anger toward each other without the use of four-letter words.
* The survivors face more than one type of danger as the movie progresses, which keeps you from getting too bored.
* Certain real-world details -- such as what happens to the world's energy sources during an apocalyptic disaster, or the mass depression that this whole thing can cause, or the fact that not everyone in the world speaks English -- are brought up in a much more intelligent, realistic fashion than in most films.
* None of the actors are household names (in Europe or the U.S.), but they can definitely deliver their lines in convincing fashion.
* The movie's not dubbed; everyone actor actually is speaking English. Even if that really shouldn't be happening.
* Some of the other reviewers complain about the movie's poor 3D imagery. The version I saw was straight 2D, and it was fine.

On the other hand, ""Extinction"" has its downsides, most of which are problems with logic or overfamiliarity:

* The characters' accents are inconsistent. There's a British guy with an American accent, an American who sounds British, a father who sounds American but has a daughter with a Russian accent, a Middle Eastern gal from Belgium who sounds American...
* Nearly every zombie's head explodes, no matter what kind of gun is used.
* Some of the zombies are killed with a knife to the back. Others take a dozen shots to the body before they go down. Others get run over but still keep crawling after you.
* There's a brief scene ripped off from ""The Hunger Games"" involving a bow and arrow.
* The virus supposedly is causing more and more things to mutate. But it stops doing so about midway through the movie. Or, we're just not seeing everything that's been impacted by this outbreak.
* Despite the obvious dangers of the ever-changing zombies during the night, the characters decide to party outside in the dark anyway.
* There's a reference to some type of creature-more-dangerous-than-a-zombie that we never see, and never hear about again.
* The movie appears to be set in Germany...yet nobody speaks German or has a German accent.
* Another ""This is God's will"" speech. Sigh.

I can still ignore these shortcomings. But there are a few that I can't overlook because they're ridiculous:

* My biggest gripe: How does a woman who's been walking dead for at least 2-3 weeks happen to have a perfectly healthy 2-3 month old infant?
* Major gripe number two: This movie appears to have been made in this decade, based on some of the ""right now"" comments made by characters. But then there are references to things like satellite phones and telephone books. Whatever happened to cell phones? And the Internet?
* Third: How does someone manage to survive for more than two weeks, locked in a jail, yet look perfectly healthy? And, how is it that the first thing he asks for upon rescue is...a cigarette?
* So...only one person is getting sick at the end, despite the fact that every character has been exposed to the same ""contaminant""?

""Extinction"" had a lot of promise. The first half of the movie steamrolls along. But it runs out of gas in the second half. It goes, pacing wise, going from ""Dawn of the Dead/28 Days Later"" to ""I Am Legend/After Earth."" It's about a half-hour too long. It's not worthy of a sequel, but we're left to think there's going to be one (and, strangely, it sounds like the non-related 2015 movie could work as one).

My final tally would be 2 1/2 stars if possible, but since it's not worth an ""I Like It"" of 3 stars, I'm forced to say, ""Nice try -- better luck next time"" and give it 2 stars.",1458604800,,5973,4.670152091254753

5099155,4,B007LUI27U,"Now maybe it is the fact that the last half dozen ""zombie / infected"" movies I have watched in the past few months have been so -so average to just plain crap, but I really liked this movie! It's German, but the actors actually speak English, and they do so very well! There are a few bumps in the story, and some slow areas, especially at the beginning, and the ending is slightly cheesy, but over all, I think Extinction is a re-watchable / keeper infected / zombie movie for me!
The infected range from slow stumblers, to ""Hulk"", to full tilt, back flipping acrobats. There was no explanation for why there were different types of infected. The infected were similar to the infected in Steve Nile's Remains in that some of them ""sleep"" at night and some eat fellow infected!
What this movie has is a cast of actors that can act. The characters are not the stereo-typical band of survivors and they are pretty well fleshed out and developed. The script was thought out and well written and joy of joy, the characters were given realistic dialogue, instead of  shallow chit chat and f-bomb diarrhea of the mouth! There is no mindless Hollywood action hero crap in the action nor heaps of gore for gore sake. The CGI that is used is not over the top. And the fact that this was a budget film didn't stand out at all. The film makers really took their time when coming up with a good story, they had great actors and found great locations to film in. The running time was just under 2 hours which I thought was perfect. ...
It is a worth while and enjoyable movie!",1371513600,10,1563,4.408304498269896
5099156,3,B007LUI27U,"This is a rather long film in need of editing. It centers on Tom (Daniel Buder) who has survived a zombie outbreak. He holds up in a safe watchtower with a secured perimeter. He does everything correctly. Tom searches for survivors and answers. Through the course of the film he gets both. The zombie infestation is caused by a mutant virus, for which a small percentage of the population is immune.

They really had a golden opportunity as the virus effects people differently. They could of had more fun developing stranger zombies. Likewise the characters in this film were stiff and devoid of personality that would cause interesting internal conflict. A drab film. 3 stars is pushing it.

This movie has a lot of talent put into it.  The acting is fine, the camera
was handled well.  The make-up effects were fine, and the gore action scenes were
for the most part computer generated.  This movie was more like 28 Days Later than
Night of the Living Dead.  A virus has mutated humanity into violent killers that
look somewhat zombie-ish.  We have a rag-tag group of survivors that are immune
to the virus and develop a plan to grow and be safe and secure from the mutants.
When they travel and explore, they find
more survivors along the way.  This is not a spoiler review.  There is enough
plot to keep the story interesting.  There is not a lot of zombie action, but
the story makes up for the difference.  Much of the film is filmed at night or
in dark buildings. (electricity is toast-it's a given!)  Worth the $ to rent,

Plenty of action, though no big explosions or anything and not very gory.
