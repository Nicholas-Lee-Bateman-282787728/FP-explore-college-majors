8181063,4,B000NQQ4JW,"Jerry Warren is(in-)famous for taking bad foreign films, re-dubbing them and adding or re-shooting or re-arranging or whatever to produce a totally incomprehensible film that is always much worse than anything he ever started out with!!!
That said, these films always have a brain dead fascination about them that leave your jaw dropping in amazement. Other examples are TEENAGE ZOMBIES, INCREDIBLE PETRIFIED WORLD, INVASION OF THE ANIMAL PEOPLE and CURSE OF THE STONE HAND. You've probably seen some of them, or all of them if you're a fan of bad cinema.
TERROR OF THE BLOOD HUNTERS(1962) stars Robert Clarke (HIDEOUS SUN DEMON, BEYOND THE TIME BARRIER and MAN FROM PLANET X, the last two directed by cult favorite Edgar Ulmer) as a political/psychological writer/artist imprisoned on Devil's Island who escapes with the warden's daughter and a fellow inmate only to be tracked through stock-footage jungles by the guard who wants to marry the girl. It's all really pretty bad, yet still bad in a fascinating unexplainable way.
For a Jerry Warren film this one makes more sense than most and even progresses in a somewhat normal fashion once the actual chase is on, but it's still a stinker.
Buy this, it's real cheap, cheaper than that six-pack of beer you'll need to get through this, but by the fourth beer it'll all start making sense, at least it did to me.
...oh yeah, the print isn't too bad either.",1214092800,3,1407,4.891213389121339
8181064,1,B000NQQ4JW,"The cover of this DVD is rather mis-leading as it looks like a 70s ""B"" movie.  In fact, the release date was in 1952 and it's not even filmed in color.  Black & White films are alright IF they're really good.  However, few things are worse than a really bad B & W movie.  That's precisely what this one is.

The film supposedly takes place on a prison island off the coast of Brazil.  All the inmates want to escape to Brazil, and the daughter of the warden is willing to help 2 do precisely that.  Uh oh:  they have to brave jungles & nasty natives to get to a ship(?) that will take them off the island.

This is the epitome of those movies which try to get melodramatic over rather silly things.  Obviously, ""shock value"" in the 1950s meant something entirely different than what it means these days.

It's great that they've put out a lot of old movies on DVD.  I've no problem w/that.  However, I have no idea who thought putting this film out on DVD was a good idea.  I'm probably the only one who has ever purchased it, and I regret that decision.",1208649600,7,1054,4.231155778894473
