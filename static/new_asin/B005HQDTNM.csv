8473467,5,B005HQDTNM,"This movie was funny without making fun of the subjects of the documentary. It was also very serious in its subject matter - what makes us human, our dreams, losing our dreams, having everything fall apart. However, it shows all of this together with humor and a little wrestling action and you come away from it thinking about the world and people in a different way. The subculture is a little ""out there"" yet the film comes across as genuinely caring for and respecting everyone in front of the camera.",1439164800,,505,4.622222222222222
8473468,2,B005HQDTNM,Not as good as I had hoped for.  Sort of boring and sad.  They could have spiced up the action a bit more.  In my opinion.,1368403200,,122,3.6153846153846154
8473469,5,B005HQDTNM,"My wife and I went to see Wrestling For Jesus at the Rappahannock Independent Film Festival in order to support my friend Nate Clarke.  I grew up watching the WWF on Saturday mornings so I was intrigued by the ""wrestling"" aspect of the film.  I've never really been interested in documentaries, but I have to say that Nate's film has left me hungry for more well told stories using this vehicle.

My wife doesn't like wrestling, nor did she know Nate before we saw the film.  She had me order the DVD soon after it was available on Amazon and is already in the process of setting up a few screenings for friends and family.  That's how much she enjoyed it.",1318377600,,656,4.3884297520661155
8473470,4,B005HQDTNM,"You'll enjoy this film far more than the title suggests.  Unless, of course, you're the type who searches out lo-fi, indie documentaries in which case you're already intrigued.  Ostensibly a film about Christian wrestlers in South Carolina whose matches are part WWF and part revival meeting, Wrestling for Jesus tells the story of faith gained and lost. I cringed repeatedly while peaking into this odd Christian subculture but director Nathan Clarke ensures that no person in his film becomes a caricature.  The film masterfully avoids all forms of cynicism and condescension.

Timothy Blackmon is the compelling and fractured character who heads the Wrestling For Jesus organization, wrestling under the name of T-Money.  Haunted by his father's suicide and driven to use his passion for wrestling to evangelize, Blackmon is forced to navigate an increasingly perilous world, including a difficult marriage and competition with another wrestling league.  The staged wrestling in the ring begins to pale next to T-Money's real life troubles.

Wrestling For Jesus can serve as a case study for a common tendency among certain evangelically-oriented Christians.  For Blackmon and his fellow Christian wrestlers, wrestling is a means to an end.  Each match ends with a preacher standing in the ring issuing a heart-felt invitation for the small crowd of spectators to accept Jesus.  The altar call is the real hook; the wrestling, as entertaining as it may be, is simply the bait.  This bait and hook tendency can be found throughout much of American Christianity and the film shows some of its significant deficiencies.  Even so, the way the story is told, we cannot judge Blackmon or his companions.  His passion and pain invite us into his world, whether or not we relate with his faith or circumstances.

Find this film, watch it with some friends, and enjoy the conversation that is sure to follow.",1318291200,4,1902,5.153094462540716
8473471,4,B005HQDTNM,"""Wrestling for Jesus"" begins as a kind of cultural side-show, introducing you to a small circle of enthusiasts where Christian evangelism intersects a grassroots form of what WWE calls ""sports entertainment.""  But although the wrestling action may be overscripted, the evangelistic mission rings true as the traditional altar becomes an invitation to meet Jesus at the edge of the ring.

Nevertheless, the faade of sports entertainment becomes a metaphor in the false-front marriage of one of the couples involved. When that marriage breaks up, so does the Wrestling for Jesus team.  The air of unreality is capsulized first in an early scene in which one wrestler shows off the trophy he won for being the most Christlike wrestler. Behind him is a poster of a scantily clad female model draped across the hood of a sexy car.  The unreality is capsulized again near movie's end when a morose little girl uses a home karaoke machine to sing herself a sappy little princess song.

And yet, and yet, there is a genuine good-heartedness that permeates all this unreality: the divorced father becomes more attentive and nurturing than ever. The leader of the fractured team pulls them back together for a benefit exhibition to support a fellow wrestler who has broken his neck.  These things tip the balance of human experience in favor of hope.

Filmmaker Nathan Clarke (whom, full disclosure, I count as a friend) has a wonderful eye for detail and for metaphor.  In ""Wrestling for Jesus,"" he helps us see human imperfection with compassion and hope.  --David Neff, Editor in Chief, Christianity Today.",1316131200,,1599,5.026515151515151
8473472,4,B005HQDTNM,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie. It looks at a slice of life that I was completely unfamiliar with (small town wrestling in the South). With a title like ""Wrestling for Jesus"" I was afraid it would poke fun at genuine faith in an unusual setting. I was wrong. It's worth seeing to watch a respectful treatment of real people who want to make a real difference doing something they love.
