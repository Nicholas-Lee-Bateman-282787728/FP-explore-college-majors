8408400,4,B003XMG1ZK,"Pretty good Italian-made, English-dubbed sword-and-sandal adventure.  This time Maciste (not Colossus) joins a group of professional gladiators on the undercover to find out what they're up to.  Seems they've been hired by a baddie to oust a queen from her throne so he can take over.  Some amusing moments and Mark Forest as Maciste flexes nicely.  Scilla Gabel as the dethroned queen is, as always, beautiful.  She looks better as a blonde though.  The DVD-R has a crystal clear picture, the color is great, and the overall quality is extremely good.  Credit titles are in Italian.  No extras.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1442188800,,631,4.990384615384615
