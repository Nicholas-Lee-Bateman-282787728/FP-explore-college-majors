8178707,5,B000NJMJJS,"This is such a simple ABC production ... with great photography (lots of simple contrasting colors), catchy music, and a really winning ""mascot"" in Inky.  My 16-month-old twins, who won't sit still for Baby Einstein, are huge fans of this DVD.  I found it randomly at my local public library, and I've since purchased a copy for ourselves.  Check out the company's website at [...] for how to purchase, if Amazon doesn't have any available (looks like they have just used copies right now).

Another reviewer mentioned that the traditional ABC song isn't part of the movie ... and they're right, it's not a part of the main film, but there is an ""extra"" on the DVD that includes the simple song.

One more thing ... I REALLY appreciate how this DVD just starts playing.  No extra preview junk, just straight to what the kids want to see.  Thanks, Baby Inklings!",1247443200,,861,4.662251655629139
8178708,5,B000NJMJJS,"My daughter learned her ABC's through the video...although they don't ""sing the song"" this dvd is designed to recognize letters and associate letters with objects in everyday life.  Music is also very upbeat and a fresh variety of international sounds.  Very pleased with this product...it won't be a bore for a long time coming.....",1197331200,,333,5.148148148148148
8178709,5,B000NJMJJS,My 2 years old and 7 months old girls love this CD.  They love the Inky Starr especially with the I alphabet and the Saint music. The 2 y/o has been asking us to turn it on for her every single day even though we had so many other DVDs for her to choose from.  She could sing the ABC song and read the alphabets after 2 weeks of watching it!!  It is worthed every single dollars spent on this DVD.,1180569600,,397,3.876543209876543
