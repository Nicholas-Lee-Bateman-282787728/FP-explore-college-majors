7995353,4,B0000A0DTO,"This reminds me of Troma Movies. Low budget, but fun to watch. I'm a huge Ken Russell fan so my review may be a little jaded. The movie is a bit hard to follow at times, but I love the feel of this movie!",1356652800,,204,3.659090909090909
7995354,5,B0000A0DTO,"For starters, this is a B film purposefully made to entertain and make people laugh. Those joyless critics expecting the ""Music Lovers does Poe"" with big budget flair are missing that.  The film is non stop fun for adults and teens 17+ though most of it is far tamer than a CSI episode. Ken, the world class director shows the audience that even with a small budget you can still have great camera work, sound and colours. Music is wonderful (great moody industrial, post punk stuff) as are the sets and costumes. Ken Russell may be in cinematic heaven and flying through a different universe as of late but with Louse he proves that no one need stop being creativity and fun simply because they don't have a huge budget to work with. ALL Indie filmmakers should own this to see how it is done for less than 20K.",1323820800,,812,4.449664429530201
7995355,5,B0000A0DTO,"for those of whom don't understand Mr. Ken Russell? are not very perceptive of docufilms. Ken Russell is a unique director making cinematic classics by his own
set of rules, NOT YOURS. Mr. Ken Russell has here a gothic-punk rock style
burlesque horror/drama with Ken Russell portraying Dr. Calahari himself and reciting satirized key parts of edgar allen poe' poetry through-out the film.

i will admit i did not find this film as much a scarefest as i did an entertainingly
odd stageplay. the perceptive will no doubt enjoy this masterpiece which remains
very loyal to the original story while be a little ribald for the sake of counter-culture styled humor.  i do believe Mr. Ken Russell is a very intellegent hippy
and never bowing to the puritanical sacharrine obsessed standards of mainstream
holyweird(hollywood). before you judge Mr. Ken Russell or me do yourself a favor
and get a copy of this film, right here at amazon, if it is still available.",1284249600,,955,4.888888888888889
7995356,1,B0000A0DTO,"""The Fall of the Louse of Usher"" is a zero budget adaptation of Poe for insufferable self-absorbed film school dropouts. It is unspeakably wretched, and shows the delirium of a once hot box office property in the throes of professional ruin. Ken Russell made and stars in this vehicle that redefines the phrase ""low production values."" It is stylistically over the top, which is one of Russell's prime appeals, but is self-indulgent, vapid, and incoherent.

Frequently resorting to shock for shock's sake, the film is ostensibly about a rock star, Roderick Usher (James Johnston), who is incarcerated in an asylum after being suspected of murder. The details are unimportant, as they just serve as a platform to allow Russell to overact deliriously as Dr. Calahari. Don't miss such great cinematic moments as the banana eating scene, inflatable Tyrannosaurus Rex therapy, Dr. Calahari's interesting choice of eyewear and nasal appliance, and my personal favorite scene, which involves a talking fish channeling a deceased Egyptian deity, a slinky, and a Ouija board. The only entertainment I got from the film was reading the credits on the DVD box. While the film says the character of Nurse A. B. C. Smith was played by Marie Findley, the box credits ""Tulip Junkie,"" and notes that Gory the Gorilla was played by Alex Alien.

The film begs to be fast forwarded, but if you stick it out you will also be rewarded with some of the worst failed attempts at music video production ever released on DVD. I am normally quite interested in novel and independent films, and frequently decry the lack of talent and originality in Hollywood and elsewhere. Going into this, therefore, I expected to conclude that it's a shame that Russell can't get funding for his films anymore. After watching it, however, I'm just relieved.",1234310400,2,1817,4.993399339933993
7995357,4,B0000A0DTO,"Filmed in his garden on a digi-cam, Ken Russell's 'FOTLOU' is a bonkers, inventive charmer guaranteed in no way to re-endear him to the likes of David Puttnam, Bryan Forbes and all the other unimaginative prigs in the hallowed halls of the British Film Industry.

He may be shorn of budget but the plus side of that of course, is there's no studio interference. No restraint being yelled by BFI yes-men which allows Ken free reign to deliver a lesson in guerilla film-making.
Grueling and unpleasant but mind-bogglingly entertaining, Russell is having a picnic to remember with his neighbours, family members and clapped-out UGLY rockers pillaging and plundering Poe til only entrails remain.

Ken himself plays the obviously looney psychiatrist/patient Dr Calihari. Who, when he's not eating lumps of his own ear-wax or trying to grope the excellent Nurse ABC Smith, is attempting to 'cure' rock-star Roddy Usher of his own insanity and also find out if he's murdered anyone or not.

Ok, as plots go it's a bit basic, but this slight premise allows Russell cart-blanch to go rooting and digging in man's darkest extremes, stopping to absorb deliriously each atrocity as he passes it by, giving the viewer a lascivious glimpse before dashing off to the next one.

Aided and abetted by the magnificent Nurse Smith, lucky old Ken somehow makes it to the end of the flick intact, though rambling and ranting in abject response to his own failures and punishments. Clever and funny, in a lewd, peep-show sense, 'FOTLOU' is admirable and satisfying BECAUSE of it.

Obviously it can't compare to 'the Music Lovers' or 'the Devils', but it does show the maniac Russell is still the most mind-rippingly, coarse-humoured, garishly coloured loose-cannon in town - and where's his MBE? (That'll be the day. Not enough sucking up!)

Wicked, profane and elatedly perverse, 'FOTLOU' is acid medicine to the saccharine excesses of mainstream cinema not only in dusty old Blighty, but also narcoleptic Hollywood and across the world.

We'll be sorry when he's gone.",1205971200,5,2049,5.044378698224852
7995358,1,B0000A0DTO,"Save yourself.  Do not rent, purchase, or otherwise obtain this film.  Do not view it, it will kill brain cells and make you sterile; it is so bad.  Even if you are the biggest Ken Russell fan in the world, do not see this film.  In fact, if you are the biggest Ken Russell fan in the world, you have every reason NOT to see this film.  Remember the man for his 'triumphs' (if they can be called such), like THE DEVILS, WOMEN IN LOVE, MAHLER, or THE LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM.  I would not see this film even if you just want something awful to giggle at at one of your little parties with your special friends.  Nope.  It's the cinematic equivalent of moldy spam.",1143936000,9,661,4.149606299212598
7995359,1,B0000A0DTO,"I'm a fan of both Ken Russell and Edgar Allen Poe and as such, waited with.....anticipation for Ken Russell's version of Poe's horror stories to work their macabre magic.  Well I was definitely shocked: not in horror, but by the fact I wasted money on such a bad film.  Calling the film amateurish would give it a redeeming value.  All the performances were appalling: what's with all the BAD accents?  Actors with teeth that bad should never show them, much less get a close up (and no it wasn't special effects makeup)!  Now I know why I couldn't find this film to rent first--it's that bad.  ...",1079395200,9,598,4.542056074766355
7995360,5,B0000A0DTO,"I was super curious waiting for this one. How was Ken Russell going to pull off his newly found freedom, that of taking digital camera in hand and filming friends and cohorts in his back garden in loosley structured ten minute bits, stringing it all together, finding wide release and perhaps regaining the acclaim that has been missing him all these years?  How?  With skill, as simple as that.  There is, as Russell-ites know, more skill in this man's pinky toe than all of Hollywood.  And beginner film makers should take note.  There is a world of possibilities in cinema.  They are as limited as your imagination.  ""Louse"" is wildly inventive and has all the great Russell trademarks:  shock editing, surrealistic sets, costumes and make-up.  And I'll be darned if their aren't some fabulous music videos with soulful music and classic Russell-ian touches:  lovers by the sea side, a dancer on a gravestone to name a few.  And since this is a horror movie, don't forget, be prepared for some pretty unsettling images.  The humour is droll and Ken Russell acts through out. I was, quited frankly, impressed by the quality of the images.  There may be some noticeable budgetary restraints, but after you settle in to the movie, you'll be back in Russell land.  Ahhhh.  It's been a long time.",1063929600,18,1294,4.791855203619909
