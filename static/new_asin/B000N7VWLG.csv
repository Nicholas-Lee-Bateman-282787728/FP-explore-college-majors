The `Perry Mason' show lasted for nine seasons, a record then. Out of its 271 episodes 120 were used for sixty VHS tapes published around 1994. Later 108 of these were used for twenty-seven DVD discs in four volumes. In 2006 they started to release the whole series on DVDs, a half-season at a time. The First Season was the best as most of its stories came from Gardner's novels. A [year] identifies the original novel.
