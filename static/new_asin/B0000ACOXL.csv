1904876,5,B0000ACOXL,"Selamin Aleykum...

David Letterman once said to Morgan Freeman to the effect: Any movie you're in you make it better. This is also true for Don Cheadle.

Don Cheadle's character Samir Horn is a Sudanese, who grew up in the United States. He is a devout Muslim. His actions most of the movie, however, make one wonder if he's a good Muslim.

1904878,4,B0000ACOXL,"There have been quite a good number of espionage thrillers and undercover police films. ""TRAITOR"" is equal parts detective story and equal parts terrorist thriller. The direction and screenplay by Jeffrey Nachmanoff is taut, gripping and well blends together elements from the Hong Kong hit ""Infernal Affairs"", the ""24"" TV series and the Bourne franchise, but it is also filed with social and theological undertones and messages.

After an arms deal in Yemen had gone awry, Samir Horn (Don Cheadle, Hotel Rwanda) is arrested and imprisoned with the same men that he has been accused of sabotaging the deal, by contacting the authorities. Samir is under fire from both sides, as the F.B.I. is putting pressure on him to reveal his contacts. When Omar (Said Taghmaoui) orchestrates a jailbreak, has little choice but to join the terrorist leader in his quest to wreak havoc in the United States. But who is Samir really working for?

The big draw of ""Traitor"" is its foreshadowing of Samir's intentions and motivations. The dialogue is kept at a pace to reveal only the minor details as the screenplay goes along, it makes the viewer work to figure out what Samir is really all about, and the script efficiently plays its cards right. Director Nachmanoff deals with certain factors to keep the tense atmosphere, and slowly leaks out more and more information about Samir's beliefs and character It was quite clever to show both the F.B.I. and the terrorist group going through his background. Samir is an ex- U.S. soldier and a very devout Muslim and much of the film focuses on him. There are some integral plot points as Agent Clayton and Agent Archer (Guy Pearce and Neal McDonough respectively) to illustrate some of Samir's political beliefs and the intricate ""motivational"" speeches as Omar recruits new ""martyrs"" to their cause. There are also some disagreements between Fahid and Samir that give the audience some idea as to how different followers of Islam interpret the Qur'an. All these doses of dialogue are integral to the script as it manages to keep the viewer interested and intrigued.

The film also has a lot of emotion and the building tension almost never stops. It is the manner of which the film builds suspense through dialogue and significant scenes that helps the film's pacing and story telling. I liked the fact that there doesn't seem to be any political motives in the film although it does promote some parallels and contradictions in government practices to the terrorist organization. Political ideas and theological teachings are shown being misinterpreted to further extremist goals. But Nachmanoff instead focuses on the evils that men do, that all men's deeds will have to answerable to God. I suppose this is a subtle way to say that extremists are using theological beliefs to intentionally misdirect or ""brainwash"" their followers. The film isn't very ""family-friendly"" and definitely not for mainstream audiences with its dark tones of government, radicalism and Islam.

Now, the film's biggest credit would have to be Don Cheadle's terrific performance. Samir is a man of Allah and Cheadle bears his soul in his portrayal. Samir is also a skilled soldier, arsonist, bomber but above all, he is a man of God. Cheadle fills his character with an unorthodox sort of appeal, which makes his character all the more compelling and interesting. Guy Pearce (Memento) also does a good supporting performance as Agent Roy Clayton, in a way, he is a man of God but from a different belief--a son of a Baptist preacher. It was quite smart to have such a character dissect another's action. The film has a good pace and the cat and mouse game between Samir and Clayton make for very good entertainment.

The film does pay off in the end but I am sure there will be some viewers who may say that the film doesn't offer anything original and I do partly agree. However, the film proved very interesting to me and this time around, the ""journey"" itself is rewarding. The film's great cinematography (by J. Michael Muro) is full of tense atmosphere that accentuates its mood. Those who are looking for an action-packed film may be a little disappointed as this one doesn't rely heavily on explosions and action scenes; rather it depends on its screenplay to slowly unravel to its revelatory final act. The film does rely on the frightening idea of another terrorist attack on American soil that may turn off some viewers.

However, the film is highly-engrossing, a great film with a sensitive subject matter but doesn't dwell on political preaching but instead tries to go into the mindset of a man while using espionage-thriller elements. It is a nicely-shot, tense thriller with some food for thought and the strong performance of Don Cheadle just seals the deal .

Recommended! [4- Stars]

Video/audio: 1.78 ratio anamorphic widescreen that diverts from its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35. But it is a nice transfer, natural colors and the overall transfer appears pretty nifty. The 5.1 Dolby Digital track is clear and powerful, but sadly there is no DTS track on the Dvd.
Bonus Features: Commentary by the director and Cheadle and a 10 minute behind the scenes look. The disc is pretty bare-bones.",1229817600,4,5234,4.946530147895335
1904879,4,B0000ACOXL,very good interesting movie i would recommend it to anyone who is into suspense. of course don cheadle delivers another good performance.,1229731200,,137,5.2727272727272725
1904880,1,B0000ACOXL,"Remember when Steve Martin used to be funny? Yeah, it seems so long ago. Nowadays he's expanding his horizons, going into more dramatic territory, but I'd never pen him to write a story about terrorism and double-agents. Unfortunately, when Neal McDonough appears within the first five minutes of the film, I could tell this was going to be less than fun/good/watchable.

Neal is awful as always, Don is understated, but good, Jeff is in the film for all of two minutes, and Guy Pierce (not Ritchie), actually gives the best performance of the film, which isn't saying much. However, it might not be the fault of these actors, but instead their terrible characters. The movie gives no reason to like 99% of the characters, and when stuff happens to them, you're more like, 'Oh well, when is this going to be over?'

But mainly, the main problem this movie suffers from is lack of a cohesive point. Is it entertaining? Not unless you find a fictional view into the life of terrorism entertaining. Does it make you think? What's there to think about? If it's about conflicts between Islam, the merits of terrorism and stuff like that, then I frankly don't give a crap. Is it a political movie? It certainly has enough politics to turn anybody off, and a general sense of uneasiness not seen outside most horror films. And it certainly isn't a thriller, so what is it? A Jason Bourne knockoff? Hardly. While Don Cheadle's character is touted as being this great soldier, only one brief instance of this is shown. The rest of the time he gets the crap kicked out of him. I care about the character even less, as he can't even fight.

It would have been much more watchable if it had better direction and editing. First off, the first thirty minutes of the film has Don Cheadle undercover in a Yemen prison full of terrorists. Complete bore, and useless. Easily could have been cut to 5-10 minutes. Hour's gone by, nothing of real note has happened. Easily could be 20-30 minutes at this point. The point is, this movie should have been no more than an hour and a half. Then there's the direction, which is expected considering the only major credit the guy had before this was writing the global warming disastor movie, ""The Day After Tommarow,"" which spell trouble right there. For example, there's an important scene on a bus, which done properly, would have been a great ironic moment, somewhat changing my negative opinion of the movie. As is, the scene is a confusing mess where you can't tell what the heck is going on.

In summation, it's a thriller that doesn't thrill, a drama that isn't that dramatic, and a movie that wants you to think, but isn't worth thinking about. What movie these positive reviewers were watching, I don't know, but this movie suffers from bad direction and lack of a basic point. However, even with multiple trips to the editing room, and better direction, it's still a 3.5 effort at best with its drab subject matter. This movie was a traitor of my time. Don't let it betray yours.",1229731200,11,3013,4.647279549718574

1904882,5,B0000ACOXL,"This movie is a great suspense and action thriller that should have drawn more acclaim. It involves alot of insight to the Qur'an and the beliefs of legitimate muslims not to be misconstrued with terrorists. May be sensitive to some viewers because of our current war in Iraq, but will definitely increase your knowledge of how faith in any religion can drive ordinary people to commit drastic crimes.",1229472000,6,401,4.911764705882353
1904883,4,B0000ACOXL,"There are some excellent reviews here for film content and story so once again I will stick with the BD type review.

I thought this was an excellent film from start to finish with plenty of technical tests for an HD display. There are a multitude of night shots and action scenes in dark places, with a spattering of desert, city and urban sequences. I watched this on several LCD and plasma displays and the film easily shows the shortcomings of the displays that are less than a 120 refresh rate.

In watching the 2 short docus accompanying the BD (which are the same as the DVD features) there are different styles of cameras used which shows through on some of the night shots; Some grain and artifact appear infrequently but it does not detract in any significant way. The sound and music are mixed adequately to test the high ranges and mids. But for a BD presentation, it cannot compete with 5 star BDs, especially with the special features being overlooked almost entirely. There is some nice locale footage in the 2nd docu, but both total less than 10 minutes.

This is one of those titles that stands alone on the film content/production. I think this was an overlooked film that deserves more coverage/pre-release placement.",1229040000,,1236,4.712962962962963
1904884,2,B0000ACOXL,"""Traitor,"" is a crime/drama/thriller starring the talented, Oscar-nominated Don Cheadle, in the title role as ""the traitor,"" former United States Special Operations Officer Samir Horn, of Chicago.  The production moves around a lot, to Washington D.C., Chicago, of course, France, but most of the action is concentrated in the Middle East.

The picture is based on a story by comic actor Steve Martin; the script was written by, and directed by, Jeffrey Nachmanoff.  I don't think I can be accused of giving the plot away if I say it concerns the undercover doings of Cheadle's character, Horn.  Guy Pearce plays Roy Clayton, and Jeff Daniels, Carter, intelligence figures with whom Horn apparently interacts.  Cheadle does strong work, and seems to be particularly good at suffering in silence.

But, you know,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spy-Who-Came-in-from-the-Cold-Criterion-Collection/dp/B001EOQCJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spy Who Came in from the Cold - Criterion Collection</a>, an epochal film  based upon British spymaster John LeCarre's novel of the same name, starring the great Welsh actor Richard Burton as cold war spy Alec Leamas, and directed by Martin Ritt, came out in 1965.  LeCarre, had, of course, actually been a British spy, in the field, and was familiar with the secrets and craft of the trade. The film, as the novel upon which it was based, explained all about how Leamas had to go to jail in order to go back into the active spy business undercover.  Now we have ""Traitor.""  Steve Martin knows no equal as a comic actor, but I doubt he knows much first-hand about the spy business.  I know nothing whatever about Nachmanoff, but somehow I doubt he is grounded in the spy business. And sorry folks, but ""Traitor"" plays like a blurred 15th generation copy of ""The Spy."" Is it too much to ask that, somewhere in the making of a spy picture, there should be someone who actually knows something about the subject matter?",1227916800,7,1995,5.301587301587301
1904885,4,B0000ACOXL,"Don Cheadle did an intense character study for this part-- a la Forrest Whitaker-- and it shows.

No movie can be 100% plausible, and this one was no exception. But one thing that they showed us are facets of terrorism that we could interpret as explaining things that actually exist in reality-- and consistent with what we expect. Among them:

1. While terrorism is a heavily Arab dominated enterprise, trouble spots could come from any type of people. The people that were recruited into sleeper cells were not Arabs.

2. The movie beautifully illustrated the REASONING that many of the terrorists used. These people blend in with the mainstream population very convincingly.

3. There was attention to detail in presenting the plots to the viewer.

On the bad side:

1. It would not have taken much more effort for the director to give us a bit more detail about the non-Arabs that were recruited as sleeper agents. What other type of motives might people who go into sleeper cells have?

2. The amount of fortuitous events that would have been necessary for Cheadle's character to become positioned in the terror cell in the way that he was stretched the limits of imagination.

3. It is hard to believe that any Muslim would go against other Muslims *just* because they disagreed about whether killing infidels was a betrayal of Islam. And this is exactly what Cheadle was doing-- and it was not easy to imagine.",1227744000,,1418,4.782786885245901

1904899,4,B0000ACOXL,"Ambiguous Intent of Lead Character Fascinating

Don Cheadle (Samir) gives a nuanced performance in this convoluted drama of a Sudanese-born Muslim.  Samir later moves to the U.S whereupon he becomes an expect in explosives during a military stint.  As a pre-teen in Sudan, he had watched his father killed by a terrorist.
Later, a interesting clue into Samir's character is revealed during a interview between the prime FBI agent, Clayton (Guy Pearce) and Samir's Muslim mother,  Clayton tries to determine which side Samir is on.  She answers by telling the agent her son has seen too much bloodshed to ever be a fanatic.
A second clue is given when Clayton corners Samir (after Samir is suspected of a U.S embassy bombing) and asks why his strength of character doesn't measure up to his father's.  This suggests 1)Samir was raised in the ""help not harm"" tradition most Muslims practice and 2)Samir's father was not engaged in terrorist activities since Clayton had obviously read his file.  Which begs the question:  Why did Samir wish to get explosives training in the first place?  To avenge his father's death?  Avenge against whom?
As the story unfolds, the viewer is allowed private glimpses into Samir's character.  Does he value or de-value the lives of others?  By the end of the film, the answers to the above questions becomes clear.",1469836800,,1346,4.959821428571429

While it is somewhat unrealistic in that most spies normally limit their activities to information gathering, nevertheless the film does cast at least degree of light on the frequently murky world of modern espionage, in which it is often never entirely clear where the ""assets"" true loyalties lie, as best illustrated by the tale of Ali Mohammed, a spy sent by American intelligence to infiltrate Al Qaeda who actually penetrated the U.S. military upon behalf Bin Laden, or Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, a Jordanian physician thought to have been recruited by the U.S. to spy on Al Qaeda, who ended up taking a prominent CIA officer's life in a suicide bombing.

It should fit into the spy/conspiracy thriller genre but it doesn't; there are few set piece action sequences and it doesn't build to an all-loose-end-tidied-up explosive climax.

1904954,4,B0000ACOXL,"In the interest of avoiding spoilers, let me just say about the plot that it's of a fairly familiar kind in the thriller genre: there's a terrorist plot to wreak havoc on US soil on a major national holiday.  Can that plot be discovered and disaster averted?  It's well worked out, with plenty of twists and with location work on three continents, and with Don Cheadle as Samir Horn doing a fine job as a rather Hamlet-like character, spiritually sensitive, full of moral seriousness, and weighed down by thinking a lot (too much?) about kinds of action that seem to him both obligatory and detestable.  Cheadle has a great face for presenting such a character in the movies -- soulful, heavy-looking for all its leanness, a face that has supped full of horrors and that effortlessly expresses the burden of complicated moral consciousness.  It's a very good performance.  As his antagonist, Guy Pearce's FBI agent Roy Clayton shares some of that quality, although in his case we recognize it more by contrast with his fellow agent Max Archer, played by Neal McDonough.  Samir's friend Omar (Said Taghmaoui) is the parallel character to Archer, so it's clear how symmetrically the movie is structured.  There's much more to say about the plot and other characters that I won't go into so that, if you're interested, you can savor the movie's suspense.

I found the movie troubling, and perhaps in an interesting way.  For one thing, it goes out of its way to humanize people who engage in terrorism and killing.  This isn't to say that it excuses them, but these characters are not faceless horrors: they can be quite sympathetic and they can articulate reasons for what they're undertaking that require reasoned responses, and perhaps other kind of responses too.  They are also conflicted in a fairly familiar way that can be summed up thus: my religion seems to require that I do not kill and yet I have obligations to kill, it seems, that are not unrelated to my religious beliefs.  That kind of moral or spiritual conflict is presented as understandable within both Islamic and Christian contexts, and in Samir we have a devout Muslim and in agent Clayton a confessed Christian who are aware of such conflicts both within themselves and in others.  So again, we see an element of symmetry in the disposition of the characters.  All of that, however convenient for thematic purposes, is not what I find troubling: rather, the source of my uneasiness is the movie's assumption that that kind of conflict manifests itself in Muslim characters in pretty much the same way that it is articulated in what we might call ""Western"" terms.  Perhaps I'm needlessly troubled -- after all, Samir is a Somali-born Muslim who has spent most of his life in the United States, but when he talks to other, non-American, Muslims, they seem to know what he's talking about.  The result, I think, is to efface cultural and historical differences that might make Christians and Muslims see their internal conflicts of conscience rather differently but which might be difficult to make comprehensible in a ""mainstream"" film.  So the generally ""Western"" terms are the ones that the conflicts get couched in, and the result is, I think, that that decision allows the viewer a rather cheap sympathy with spiritually sincere people who contemplate and carry out horrible acts.  I call it ""cheap"" because it seems to offer such sympathy as ""understanding"" when it seems to me doubtful, from what the movie presents of Islamic culture, that we have enough information to base understanding on.  All of this is not to impugn the motives of the film-makers or the actors; the refusal to make cartoon villains of Muslims is surely a step in the right direction, even though I doubt that it goes (or CAN go, in a movie that aims to entertain) far enough.

The movie-makers, however, are not content to have no clear-cut villains.  In a fairly conventional move, we have characters who are willing to put serious people in harm's way while obviously keeping themselves well out of it and whose religious convictions are, shall we say, more flexible than those of the characters we come to care about.  Some readers of these comments might not be as bothered as I was by what is represented of the Islamic world and might well know more than I do about it.  I recommend that you watch the movie -- it's a thriller, but it's soulful, and Don Cheadle and his fellow-actors do good work.",1420416000,,4454,4.8086500655307995

With his standout performance in Devil in a Blue Dress, that really sealed & solidified him as an actor that you would never have to concern yourself with letting you down once the movie started. His portrayal here in Traitor once again gives us a powerhouse portrayal of a spy who ultimately becomes conflicted with doing the 'right' thing when opposing ideologies suddenly become different sides of the same coin. Don Cheadle makes it gut-wrenching to watch as his ability to decide which way is better is essentially strangled with a bitter cold from those in command, and to survive means casualties, something both parties welcome without any reluctance. Traitor demonstrates just how much enemy and friendly are truly relative terms like poor and rich, words that can only be accurately explained within the context of the subject matter. It's as much about the head as it is the heart. If have never seen Traitor or any movie with Don Cheadle, this is a superb way to discover him.",1408320000,2,1198,4.820388349514563

I would probably ultimately rate this movie 4+1/2 stars, since there was, for me, a sense of having seen vaguely similar movies before. Don Cheadle does a great job acting, having to hold his cards tight as to which side he is on, the FBI or the terrorist group. (It seemed weird at the beginning that the FBI, not the CIA, raid the terrorist group in a Middle Eastern country, but I guess since the plot ends with an attempt in the US to blow up buses, the writers needed to rationalize the FBI's involvement at the outset. I'm also not any expert on how or whether the FBI operates around the world.) The best part of the movie for me was the notion that a person of God (in this case, Islam) would follow principles of his religion that are in alignment with the knowledge of his heart, requiring contemplation of ways to minimize damage to humans, while standing up against oppression, and (hopefully) enlightening the FBI agent at the end.",1393372800,2,1028,4.502673796791444

1905016,5,B0000ACOXL,"- Were my exact words to myself after seeing the surprise ending to Traitor! - I usually avoid Americans-as-victims type movies like the plague! But Traitor is not your typical terrorist/war porn movie. While there's some violence it is never gratuitous, gruesome or exploitative. What you are going to see is an intelligent story, granted it's a fantasy, but it makes many important points.

First, and foremost, Islam does not condone the the killing of innocent civilians anymore than Christianity does. And we are reminded, by example, that the Klu Klux Klan perverted Christianity by striking fear in the hearts of thousands of people by burning crosses on their property, and by committing other very serious acts of violence against innocent civilians in the name of God and country!

Another message we hear clearly is that killing innocent civilians is never justified, and the ends don't justify the means! Since this film review has a world audience, I would like to point out that the United States government has not learned this lesson either! The American fire bombing of Tokyo, Japan and Dresden, Germany during World War 2 are war crimes, plain and simple! The horrendous treatment of Native Americans during the 16th - 19th centuries are war crimes. The deliberate and/or reckless dropping of napalm on civilians during the Vietnam War is a war crime, too.

The United States support of oppressive dictators, monarchs, and other assorted thugs is also criminal! But two wrongs don't make a right. And one not need become a thug, killer or terrorist to thwart thugs, killers or terrorists!

One of the biggest problems facing the world today is a lack of education concerning what governments around the world do in their citizen's name. We all like to focus on the other country/person as the bad guy, while never owing up to our own government's sins. It so incredibly easy to point the finger!

If all the crimes that the American government committed in its 232 year history were listed back-to-back, it would be a mile long. But the same could be said about many other governments around the world. So it begs the question - when will we (the Human Race) ever learn? Innocent civilians are the vast majority of the world's population. Don't we have any say in this? In my humble opinion, if you really want long-lasting change shove a mirror in your opponent's face, instead of of some weapon! As Albert Einstein once said, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome!

Cheadle is a decent enough actor, brave in going after the movies that has a pretty depressing message, but his range is limited and he never seems comfortable enough when he's serious giving off a flat affect that reduces his aura. Pearce is the most interesting as a decent ""religious"" FBI agent who acts as counterpart to Cheadle's ""religious"" double agent.

Unfortunately the pacing was too slow for my taste. The were going for a realistic feel so I understand it was more of a character / social commentary film as opposed to a Rambo type feel where the good guy goes in guns blazing ready to take out every terrorist with a bow and arrow and a .50 calabur machine gun.

While I have tried to get past the negative aspects of the film, it becomes quite apparent that the film just isn't anything special. Traitor leaves a lot of strings untied on its way to an unsatisfying, Hollywood-ish ending.

1905035,3,B0000ACOXL,"""Traitor"" is a thriller against the background of the present political climate in the world. Jeffrey Nachmanoff's political thriller is slick, well-acted and mostly riveting, but the film's convoluted (some may say incredible) story requires a considerable amount of suspension of disbelief.

At the center of its globe-trotting story is two characters: the chased and the chaser. They are Samir Horn (Don Cheadle) and Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce). Samir is a former soldier selling explosive devices to radicals. Roy is a tough, straight-shooting FBI agent hunting down the culprits involved in multiple terrorist attacks in Europe.

Samir and Roy had once met in Yemen. When arrested, a devout Muslim Samir is offered a deal from Roy, but he refuses. Later Samir escapes from a Yemeni Prison with another inmate Omar (Sad Taghmaoui). By the end of the 114 minute film, Roy and his no-nonsense partner Max (Neal McDonough) will know what Samir is heading for.

""Traitor"" keeps the viewer guessing right up to a certain moment, when the fifth major character steps in. From then on, things start to look a bit familiar, if not predictable, and its resolution is too unbelievable. Some may be reminded of ""Body of Lies,"" released only two months after ""Traitor."" Like Ridley Scott thriller ""Traitor"" describes high-tech aspects of modern-day warfare, explores inner conflict of characters, and wraps up the complex storyline with a too-neat conclusion. ""Traitor"" is an effective thriller, but a second viewing will make you notice some major plot holes in it.",1285372800,,1555,5.187250996015936
1905036,4,B0000ACOXL,"In Traitor, Cheadle plays a Sudanese-born U.S. army specialist who infiltrates terrorist organizations.  Throughout the movie you are not sure where his loyalties lie.  I recommend going into this movie fresh without reading a lot of reviews.  The twists and turns of the plot - as well as Don Cheadle's performance - are what make this movie 4 stars.  Heavy content and violence; while this is rated PG-13 I don't recommend for those under 17.  This movie can be disturbing at times, powerful at times - it will definitely make you think.",1280275200,,539,4.815217391304348
1905037,5,B0000ACOXL,"Don Cheatle has always chosen interesting roles that hold great potential for social and human commentary. This is certainly no exception. His performance here was magnificent.

Being an American born convert to Islam, I am familiar with the conflicting feelings a Muslim has to face. ironically, the answers are simple. But implementing them in our daily life is never simple. ""Traitor"" shows this perfectly.

Cheatle's character illustrates this perfectly. From his childhood, he was exposed to political violence. Yet at heart, all he was interested in was living as a pious Muslim. Which brings us to the crux of the matter; politics. When a social structure arises that is based on ANY ideology, inevitably, a point will come when those in leadership positions will have to chose between adhering to their ideological principles at the expense of their political power, or ""adjusting"" their principles for the sake of political and / or economic expediency. All too often, human beings make a very poor choice in this. The whole of human history will provide an excellent model to study this phenomenon.

So, getting back to the movie, we are left with a great many open questions, or so it would seem. Was Cheatle's character the traitor, or did he truly adhere to the principles of Islam and chose the lesser of many evils? How does one explain Fareed, who drank alcohol and ate pork with the justification that he was simply blending in: something easily avoidable (which I can personally attest to)? Did the terrorist organization that Horn worked for betray Islam by turning their religion into a political agenda, and adapt methods that have no justification in Islamic spirituality? Did FBI Agent Clayton betray (or casually abandon) his family's Christian principles - and was Horn's devout Islamic beliefs responsible for exposing him to what he'd lost, or walked away from?

There are no easy answers to this, either in art or in real life. We make choices every moment and must live with the results and consequences of these choices. Samir Horn was an object lesson in this.

Finally, I want to say that I see in this movie not a single shred of anti-Islamic or anti-American rhetoric. People who accuse ""Traitor"" of either of these  are missing the point. There is no political agenda here; only a human agenda; the agenda of coming to terms with what's within one's heart.",1272153600,8,2391,4.950124688279302

Also shows that the line between the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"" gets very blurred at times.  Very thoughtful film.",1266710400,,452,4.670886075949367
1905040,3,B0000ACOXL,"""Traitor"" tries to plow through the viewers' assumed ignorance or lack of understanding when it comes to Islamic terrorists and suggest a more nuanced explanations of motives beyond the simplistic ""they want to kill us all"" or ""unless we don't fight them there will have to fight them here"" or ""they are going to follow us home and do unspeakable things to our defenseless families"". Clearly, we have a much better understanding of terrorists movements such as the nationalist IRA or the various past and present Marxist or Maoist Red Army Brigades than we do of today's super-radical and super-desperate Islamic suiciders. It's difficult to 'get' what motivates young men and women, often well educated and sometimes coming from affluent families to blow themselves up for the dubious (at least to us) reward of taking 'some of us' with them in the process and the few no longer front page newspaper headlines and Tweets. What makes ""Traitor"" troubling is not its largely successful attempt to show us that there's a lot more than the promise of 72 virgins in Heaven that recruits 'suiciders' but its inability to go beyond hinting at what that might be - to borrow a famous line from 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'... Anyone? Anyone? The possible explanations provided by dedicated terrorist Omar - who attended finishing school in Switzerland - that tend to come down to 'they killed many of us so we should kill many of them' may be part of the motive, especially when a family member was tortured or imprisoned or lost but individual revenge can't account for a movement and a cause.

With the understanding that ""Traitor"" is maybe a baby step forward toward an open discussion of what makes 'them' hate 'us' so much and how can 'we' justify us voluntarily surrender so quickly our personal and civil liberties when facing a relatively small threat and in exchange for some largely illusory 'security', it is a tense, generally well acted movie. It's not clear what made Samir, a native of Sudan, join the US Army Special Forces - we see his father dying inside an exploding car but from that to an elite US Army career and then deep cover agent - before or maybe after having fought side by side with the Afghan freedom fighters (now known to us as terrorists) against Russian invaders? Omar, Samir's Islamic Brotherhood terrorist best friend meets him in a Yemeni prison and it's not clear how he ended up there either after completing finishing school in Switzerland. We do hear from Omar that he resents 'the West' for killing and humiliating his brothers and sisters but... from Switzerland to Yemen? Yemen is one of the least likely place to find Westerner targets. The US government agents, especially the FBI, get a more realistic treatment - arrogant, brutal, unable and unwilling to comprehend or adjust to an unfamiliar reality, all too willing to forget about the niceties of actually following our laws when the opportunity to brutalize a US citizen abroad presents itself, sloganeering when there's a need to defend or explain less then honorable activities.

As far as the plot goes, it's the expected spy thriller action movie. People are not always who they say they are, there's a lot of deception, a reasonable body count and, in the end, even though 'our side' seems to get the better of it, poor Samir is left trying to figure out for himself if whatever he did was right or even necessary while under intense bombardment from slogans and clich&eacute;s thrown at him by Special Agent Roy Clayton.

""Traitor"" is not easy to watch. Even hinting at what might be ""the other side's"" views and motivations tends to make us uncomfortable and, while not really coming close to touching the root causes and motivations for today's Islamic terrorism, it comes close enough to make watching difficult. Sadly, because it only hints at possible causes and motives without fully exposing them, most viewers discussions about what they just watched aren't likely to deviate from the standard, often repeated, short, simplistic, depressing sound bites fed to us by big and loud talking heads that our valuable mass media likes to squeeze between male enhancer pills and diet plan or abs commercials.

Since I watched ""Traitor"" on a Blu-ray disc, it's probably worth noting that there's little in the image where the Blu would offer a significant advantage over a DVD. The dark subject is appropriately painted on the screen with dark shades of brown, gray and yellow and the viewer attention is likely to focus more on the plot and characters interactions than on the largely non-existent vistas. The same can be said about sound - Dolby TrueHD - it's adequate but this story does not call for tremendous surround sound performances. Explosions, even when they happen, are integrated into the context of the story. The Blu-ray package comes with a second digital copy disk which is quite appropriate because watching the movie on a computer screen should be as good an experience as watching it on a home theater.

I hesitate to recommend ""Traitor"" as an outright purchase even though the current Blu low price (8.99) should make it tempting. I did buy my copy and I am probably going to keep it. However, if in doubt, you're probably better off renting it and HD vs. DVD resolution won't make a big difference.",1265846400,6,5319,4.86644591611479
1905041,3,B0000ACOXL,"The modern world is pulling at its own stitches -- religious differences, political conflicts, and crisscrossing loyalties. So it's an appropriate time for a movie like ""Traitor,"" a brilliantly acted and morally murky tale that was written (weirdly enough) by Steve Martin, but which is also held back by its twisty narrative and a narrative that sounds better in theory than in practice.

Sudanese Samir Horn (Cheadle) was born in Sudan, but after his father was killed in a terrorist attack he was brought to the United States and eventually became a part of the army -- a specialist who infiltrates terrorist organizations. But it seems his loyalties are no longer to the US army -- he's become entangled in a group of terrorists and imprisoned in Yemen. And, of course, his special skills and knowledge come in quite handy when it comes to terrorist plots.

But something is not quite right in this equation. A pair of FBI agents, Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce) and Max Archer (Neal McDonough), are sent after Samir.... but soon discover that his loyalties are not so easily identified. Just who is he a traitor to? At the same time, a plot is being put into effect that would kill countless people on Thanksgiving Day, and Samir seems to be involved...

""Traitor"" is pretty clearly a movie meant to make you very, very uncomfortable, especially since it does some heavy delving into Muslim beliefs, divisions of loyalty, and the corruptions of text and belief that drive fanatical extremists to kill others. It gets too slanted at times -- the Muslim agent is portrayed as far more devout in his faith than the Christian one -- but it's a powerful piece of work, and a sympathetic look at the people torn between their personal beliefs and outside forces.

Director Jeffrey Nachmanoff handles this in a more intelligent manner than your average action thriller, allowing the plot to seep and unfold gradually, and throwing new kinks into the storyline along the way. The violence is genuinely harrowing, and the script is pretty solid. The problem is that the complexity itself turns into confusing knots, and the ending falls rather flat compared to the tense, sleek movie that precedes it. I was left thinking, ""... that's it? That's what happens?""

Cheadle is, quite simply, one of Hollywood's most underrated actors -- and he gives a quietly compelling, intensely powerful performance as Samir, able to convey all the division and confusion that his character feels. Pearce is a good if slightly less nuanced counterpart, far more conventional in his thoughts and approaches, but who learns a certain appreciation for Cheadle's character and the knowledge that the truth is not simple or straightforward. Assuming you can find ""the truth"" at all, rather than someone's personal approach.

""Traitor"" leaves you feeling confused but exhilarated, and tackles the near-impossible questions of modern Islam and some of its fanatical followers. An intelligent movie, if a flawed one.",1262822400,,2980,5.022267206477733

- Any gospel can be used to justify anything, but all affirm God, as the one who gave us all, regardless of religion, ethnicity, political affiliation the most precious gift of all, the gift of life.

The messages implicit (and sometimes fairly explicit) in the movie are that good guys aren't all good, bad guys aren't all bad, we often can't sort out the good and bad guys, and innocent people are routinely caught in the crossfire (tragically, sometimes en masse).  To solve the problem, we need to address its root causes, since this back and forth exchange of blows won't resolve anything and may well escalate the problem.  Don't we all want a world in which our children and grandchildren don't have to worry about these kinds of dangers?

1905058,4,B0000ACOXL,"I love a good thriller, and Cheadle is a superb actor.  And while this movie was enjoyable, it's not one I'll rewatch.  I think perhaps the modern terrorist theme is just not good entertainment for me; like so many people who aren't interested in movies about the war in Iraq. It's too real.  And Islam always ends up looking bad (regardless of what side Cheadle is actually on).

Cheadle's character is devout Muslin - and that is the only thing that is certain about him.  What his true intentions are, he may know but not even understand.  I think maybe the film tried too hard  (as evidenced by some reviewers saying it's difficult to explain the plot). In an effort to keep the audience guessing which side he is on, there is a lot of back and forth.  He's helping the terrorists (but isn't that how you gain their trust?); he's refusing to come clean with the FBI (isn't that just to maintain his cover?).  Every action could potentially be explained either way.  While this kept the suspense high, it also made the film slow if not a little boring.  Do I really care anymore?

Overall, this is worth watching at least once.  Cheadle is a great actor and he carries this movie as well as he can with a somber/depressing topic.  This movie requires a viewer to pay close attention.  This isn't James Bond, or even Jason Bourne, (which are fun popcorn flicks) but it's worth seeing.",1250726400,2,1386,4.532258064516129

You can no longer count the number of movies about the global threat of Middle Eastern terrorism on one hand.  It is a topic that gets headlines around the world, and movie makers must salivate over the screenplays.  I have admitted my bias, and maybe that is what made this movie mediocre for me.  I thought the Americans were portrayed as ruthless, witless cowboys.  I'm not saying I agree or disagree with that viewpoint, but only that I grow tired of it.

Don Cheadle is my saving grace.  He is one of the finest actors of this time.  He has a seriousness about him that makes everything he says worth hearing.  This movie followed him through some very difficult decisions and you feel torn in two directions almost more than he is.  He is a talent worth keeping an eye on.

He is arrested in Yeman as a terrorist, but subsequently breaks out of jail with several other terrorists bent on wreaking havoc against the United States.

The most interesting part of the plot, however, is that Cheadle's character Horn, isn't a true terrorist. He's been planted there as an off the books operative of a U.S. government agency. Only one person knows of his whereabouts. Horn struggles with conducting terrorist operations which cause death and destruction even as he is helping the government.

Unfortunately, half of this plot is not fulfilled. The plot line of his involvement with the U.S. government is cut off halfway through the movie for no apparent reason. The entire story is simply left to die and never addressed or explained again. The result is a run of the mill movie that leaves the viewer wondering what caused the director to end the most interesting element of the plot. At the end of the movie I simply couldn't believe it was over. There was so much more that could have been done with this movie.

Anyway, I figured Samir had somehow sabotaged the simultaneous bombings by wiring the explosives incorrectly on all the bombers.

1905070,4,B0000ACOXL,"Don Cheadle stars as former U.S. Special Ops Officer Samir Horn and Guy Pearce plays the FBI agent hot on his trail in ""Traitor.""  The film opens with Horn as a child in Sudan learning his Muslim faith from his father.  Then we see Horn witness his father's death via a car bomb.

Hurtle forward into modern times and we find Samir trying to cut a deal with Muslim terrorists.  He is captured in a raid in Yemen and soon finds himself offered assistance by the FBI in return for crucial information on terrorist cells all over the world.  When he refuses to help, he is left to rot in a Yemeni prison where he forms a close bond with a fellow Muslim named Omar (Said Taghmaoui).

The pair, along with a number of Omar's cohorts, escape the prison and meet up with the Islamic Brotherhood.  From there, the film goes across the globe, allowing the viewer to witness a number of terrorists acts that are headed up by Samir's knowledge of weapons and of the Qu'ran.

Meanwhile, FBI Agent Clayton (Pearce) and his team are trying to find out who is pulling off all of the terrorists bombings.  Soon enough Clayton pegs Samir as a prime suspect and the chase is one.

The viewer is forced to question the motives of Samir from the very beginning.  Is he truly a terrorist?  Perhaps he is just a loyal fanatical Muslim who believes that glory awaits those who strike down the infidel?  Maybe he's doing this all to bring down the real bad guys?  You'll have to watch the film to find out, since saying too much more will spoil the film.

Cheadle does an excellent job as the mysterious Samir Horn.  Guy Pearce is wonderful as the minister's son-turned-lawman, Clayton.  Said Taghmaoui is brilliant as the highly intelligent and near-fanatical Muslim believer, Omar.  The supporting cast, which features Jeff Daniels, the always reliable and completely underrated Neal McDonough, Alyy Khan, Archie Panjabi and Hassam Ghancy, give solid performances as well.

What I personally found enjoyable about this film is that Islam is dicussed by fanatics, loyalists and outsiders who both fear and respect the faith.  Samir's interactions with Omar and Clayton on Islam are brilliant, and show the viewer that there's a whole lot more to Islam than blowing up the infidel and declaring Jihad on everyone.

While the film does run a bit slow at times it is, overall, a tight suspense drama with just enough action to keep it interesting.  It is an intelligent film and I highly recommend it to people interested in the subjects of espionage, terrorism and religion.  Highly recommended.",1237420800,,2570,4.725842696629213
1905071,2,B0000ACOXL,"**This review contains spoilers**

Samir Horn (Don Cheadle) is an African-American Muslim who was born in Sudan and witnessed the death of his father in a car bombing when he was nine. He's raised by his mother in Chicago and spends some time in the Army in Special Ops. Eventually he sees action in both Afghanistan (with the Mujahideen) and fellow Muslims in Bosnia. Samir shows up in Yemen posing as an arms dealer and trying to infiltrate a terrorist network for a rogue CIA operative. Through the recommendation of a mutual acquaintance, Samir hooks up with a terrorist named Omar but before you know it they both wind up in prison after being captured by Yemeni government soldiers working in conjunction with the FBI.

After Samir and Omar escape from the prison aided by terrorist sympathizers, they escape to France where Omar introduces Samir to Fareed Mansour, Omar's boss in the terrorist network. Fareed is no Mohammed Atta (fanatic ringleader of the 9/11 terrorists) but rather an urbane yuppie-type who thinks nothing of drinking alcohol in front of Omar and Samir (supposed devout Muslims). Fareed justifies drinking of alcohol (a sin in the Muslim religion) by stating that it's necessary to blend in to achieve victory as the ends always justify the means. Somehow Aly Khan, an actor of Indian Muslim ancestry, seemed more like a stock Hollywood villain than a representation of an actual terrorist.

Even less convincing is Samir's ideological disagreement with Fareed while they're having dinner at an outdoor caf. Samir makes it quite clear that he feels that Fareed has misinterpreted the Koran to justify violence. It's obvious that the film's screenwriters are trying to make the point that Samir represents the MAJORITY of Muslims--that is, they are peaceful people who reject the methods of terrorists. Nonetheless, would Samir have risked blowing his cover by getting into an argument with the very man who he must prove his allegiance to? Omar ends up making excuses for Samir so he gets by--but the screenwriters cannot help but continually remind us (in the character of Samir) that the majority of Muslims reject violence (whether you agree or not with that idea, it just feels the point is made ad infinitum throughout the film perhaps in order to 'soften the blow' or 'balance things out' since the films' antagonists are indeed Islamic terrorists!).

Samir is depicted as a man who totally abhors the killing of innocents. However (and here is the big problem with the movie), he is willing to hook up with a lone rogue CIA operative (an intelligence contractor as he is referred to in the movie), a person who he knows virtually nothing about, and plants a bomb in the US consulate in Nice at the behest of this shadowy figure, which accidentally kills eight innocent people. It just seems that there are too many action-thrillers today that trot out the tired storyline of inter-agency government squabbling, especially between the FBI and the CIA.

How does this CIA guy pull off the bombing of the US consulate in France no less? To my recollection, most US embassies and consulates are pretty well-guarded. And why Samir would even take a chance in conducting an operation such as this when he knows that something could go wrong is beyond me.

While the rogue CIA operative must end up getting bumped off precisely because he is amoral and unprincipled, the FBI fares better here. The two agents, Clayton and Archer, are your typical good cop-bad cop characters. Archer is the bad cop and punches Samir a few times in an early interrogation scene in Yemen. But Clayton (Guy Pearce) is the 'sensitive' good cop--he majored in Arabic studies as an undergraduate and ends up receiving important information from Samir via email at a critical point in the film's story.

I'm not sure exactly how Samir pulls it off--and this is probably a first in the history in the fight against terrorism--he manages to arrange for 50 would-be suicide bombers to be on the same bus and they all blow themselves up at the same time. Then he also manages to shoot the two terrorist masterminds without any bodyguards being present (Note that the main boss, Nathir, again is no scary Mohammed Atta-type--but rather an ordinary businessman).

Traitor does a disservice in the fight against international terrorism. It makes it look all too easy with the good guys easily outwitting the bad guys. But in reality, terrorists such as the 9/11 conspirators were no pushovers; to remind everybody: they beat us--we didn't beat them! Some say that Cheadle's performance here was excellent. I would have to disagree. He comes off as too middle-class, too intellectual to be a former Special Ops guy who is able infiltrate a gang of terrorists. All the preaching throughout the movie reminds me more of a college professor trying to convince a bunch of undergraduates that his cause is just.

In the end, 'Traitor' tries hard to be as politically correct as possible, arguing that the war against terror is not antithetical to the teachings of the Muslim religion. But it makes its argument in such a heavy-handed and obvious manner that the film becomes overly didactic. Coupled with a wholly implausible plot, 'Traitor' fails to convince us that we're watching a story that mirrors something that could have come close to happening in reality.",1237161600,4,5355,4.934517203107658
1905072,5,B0000ACOXL,"You have to wonder if Cheadle is making more and more movies that he has a passion for the message?  Thinking Hotel Rwanda and Traitor.

In this movie, you are left to question where he is coming from.  To whom is he a traitor to?  Is he a traitor at all?

What you get is a sense of the good side of Islam. Cheadle quotes the Quran through the movie, even quoting the opposite views that extremists quote.  My favorite:  ""Mohammed said, 'if you kill one man, you kill all of humanity.""""  Wow, how powerful.

What I like about this movie juxtaposed against movies like 'Body of Lies' or 'Syriana' is that you see Cheadle and the men who are trying to catch him.  Not a lot of back and forth and three story threads at one time.  This movie is one straighforward, intense story.

Cheadle is one great actor, he is believable.  You like him, even when he is playing the 'enemy.'  It is a movie that reflects courage and in this confusing world we live in, gives us a sense of balance that must be sought out as we relate to our fellow man.",1236643200,,1037,4.224489795918367
1905073,5,B0000ACOXL,Traitor: well - the Bourne series - for one - has nothing on this film. This film has so many twists and turns - a seemingly conventional beginning with a shocking end. This film action packed - but stands above its counterparts in film through it's inclusion of rich and dynamic relationships and characters; and - by the film's end - you're left really thinking on what the main character was all about. This is a classic thriller - completely underrated. I highly recommend it.,1236384000,,480,4.658823529411765

The story was kind of predictable but still good.",1236297600,,315,4.163934426229508
1905076,3,B0000ACOXL,"This is a typical American action flick in the sense that it features a really smart and tough hero character, in this case Don Cheadle, who is able to outsmart and outfight just about anybody, good guys and bad guys alike. Maybe one reason this film didn't do so well at the box office is because it doesn't have quite as much action as most action movies, for which I give it credit. Also unlike most action movies it doesn't have any super evil villains. There are terrorists, of course, but you see them as people and not just as cardboard bad guys. Then again, a movie portraying Muslims only as evil terrorists and Americans only as good guys would stir things up, wouldn't it?

At the end of the movie there is some preachiness about Muslims being used, misguided, and misled, and there is no serious effort to explore the roots of terrorism. One could just as well examine the motivations of homegrown terrorists like Timothy McVeigh. The end of the movie also sets up the obvious sequel, but perhaps there will be no sequel after all.

Even with its redeeming qualities, Traitor suffers the same flaw as other action films: implausibility. But that doesn't bother fans of action films. The only reason it bothers me is because I'm not a fan of action films. True action fans may want more action and special effects than this film dishes out.",1236211200,,1351,4.601659751037344
1905077,3,B0000ACOXL,"""Traitor"" is one of the many movies about the ""war on terrorism"" that completely tanked at the box office.  People just didn't want to watch movies about Iraq, Afghanistan, terrorism, rendition, torture - any of it.  Some of those movies were actually pretty good, some were acceptable/OK, and some were just bad movies.  ""Traitor"" is in the middle.  Not a great flick, but definitely worth at least a rental.

The director had to thread the eye of the needle with a story like this.  How to depict Muslims and Arabs in all their humanity, from good to bad?  This was a tight rope act and it appears, at least to this reviewer, that the director succeeded even if the final product wasn't a stupendous movie.  It shows that some people are bad and some are good and they exist on all sides.

Don Cheadle does a superb job as the guy torn apart in the middle, the witness to atrocities and hypocritical extreme ideology on both sides.  There is tension throughout the film as viewers have to guess which way he's going to ultimately go and if the side he decides to join will accept him or kill him.

Still, the film falls flat in part to its lack of budget.  The final explosion is perhaps the biggest example.  Not that big explosions make a great movie!  Far from it.  It's just that the specifics of the story indicated that this explosion would consist of multiple sources (possible spoiler - I'm trying to be vague) and the one they show is just too tiny for that.  That kind of approach is seen in much smaller touches throughout the film. You can tell that they've passed off certain streets as foreign locales when it was probably just Vancouver, Canada.  That a big chunk of the film ends up in Nova Scotia (about as non-descript as you can get) says something.

Still, it's worth a rental and could possibly lead to some interesting conversations afterwards.  It's definitely food for thought even if it's not a classic.",1236038400,,1930,4.558139534883721
1905078,4,B0000ACOXL,"Samir Horn: The truth is complicated

This movie is the brainchild of Steve Martin, who switches comedy for more serious fare as executive producer of this gripping spy thriller that goes behind the scenes of a terrorist organization known as the Islamic Brotherhood.

As intense as he was in Hotel Rwanda, Don Cheadle gives a first-rate performance as Samir Horn, an explosives expert trained by the US Army Special Forces, who becomes deeply involved with the group.  Cheadle plays a devout Muslim and his character battles personal conflicts and principles all the way through the movie.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS)

1905081,4,B0000ACOXL,"I enjoyed the film, Traitor, as a suspenseful drama written around a serious and challenging topic. The film is held together by a great performance by Don Cheadle as Samir Horn, a Sudanese born Islamic American citizen. Guy Pierce gives a great performance as an FBI agent on the trail of Horn. The film also uses the story of Samir Horn as a character study of a complex individual. The FBI agent played by Guy Pierce serves as a proxy for the viewer for as Pierce fits the pieces of the puzzle together, so also does the viewer. Pierce is the proxy for the viewer unraveling the actions, loyalties, and deeper motivations of a complex man who may or may not be suffering from conflicting values and cultural systems.

Much of the action revolves around the cat and mouse dynamics of terrorism and counter-terrorism. However, it is the character study that balances the action that makes this film get 4 stars. The film presents us with the ambiguity as to whether Samir is a rogue secret agent who has become a terrorist or whether Samir is a double agent who is out on a thin limb as he infiltrates an organization of terrorists with little if any back-up. Thus the concept of 'traitor' is part of the dynamics for we are not certain as to whether he is a traitor to the US or whether he is a traitor to Islam. The resolution of the conflict could be viewed as contrived Hollywood wrap-up, but give the film a break for even though it tries to explore complex issues working inside the mind of a complex mind, the film must also deliver entertainment with no strings left hanging. On this account it certainly delivers.",1235174400,,1623,4.539249146757679

The end was perhaps one of the best and least suspected endings you could imagine.  It was well acted and fit nicely into current world events.  It demonstrated what heroes we have in our covert operations and some of the things they are willing to do for their country.  At the same time, you have feelings that the entire storyline could be heading in another direction.... you sometimes think the hero is a villian, and then, just when you see what's going on, everything seems to change.  All hope seems to be lost, and the hero seems to be doomed.  At that point you just wonder how many innocent people he will take with him... how far will he go to seemingly protect himself.  With hundreds of lives on the line you find yourself sitting on the edge of your chair waiting for the end to reveal itself... and that final twist is what makes this a very nice experience to watch.

It kept me interested from start to finish. But what I like most about this movie is Don Cheadle's performance. He's believable in every shot he's in, especially when he interacts with the FBI and the Agent Clayton (Peaarce) and Omar (Taghmaoui). His acting as a whole is what makes this film a whole lot better. Jeff Daniels was a bit underused in my opinion, but he does a decent job playing his part. And finally, the minimal Middle Eastern music creates the perfect atmosphere for this film. Kudos to Mark Kilian for the score. In fact, kudos to the entire cast and crew for making this movie.

1905086,4,B0000ACOXL,"The tagline for the '08 film `Traitor' is ""The truth is complicated"". After viewing the movie I can only compliment the filmmakers for picking such a wise and appropriate phrase to encapsulate what unfolds before its audience. The occidental mind has yet to come to grips with an Islamic mindset that encourages its most fanatical followers to strap explosives to their bodies and detonate themselves in crowded buildings, transportation centers or any high traffic venue that will best unsettle the security of its adversaries. It is ""terrorism as theatre"" and all the world is its stage.

In `Traitor' Don Cheadle delivers a marvelous performance as Samir a Islamic, Sudanese born American immigrant who after spending years in U.S. military intelligence apparently has a change of conscience and joins an extreme terrorist organization after being recruited by Jihadist and future best friend Omar (Said Taghmaoui). Said is also magnificent, the on-going conversations between Omar and Samir discussing the Jihadist mindset and mission and how they compare with past and present acts of aggression by America are searing, thought-provoking and nuanced. For me they make this movie worth the time and effort. That's not to say that there isn't anything else worthwhile in this film, but it is there relationship and intellectual debate that raises the film to a higher level.

As for the rest of the film, well this isn't one of your typical fast paced action films. The storyline unfolds rather slowly, too slowly at times. But it does build momentum about halfway through will firmly hold your interest to the end. `Traitor' offers the viewer great performances, intellectual stimulation and political relevance. There is in my opinion two flaws that keep the film from receiving a -5 Star- rating. The `Big Moment' at the end is rather unrealistic for reasons I can't discuss without spoiling the surprise and secondly, the ultimate decision made by Samir was a little too black and white for a storyline focused on exploring the gray areas of faith, conscience and choosing sides.

After Hotel Rwanda, I wanted Don Cheadle to be a good guy but, throughout the film, it was often hard to gauge. Thank goodness the camera was there so I could look into his eyes at just the right moment. The tiniest eye movements and pained expressions sustained the hope that he was a good guy. Cheadle's face can express more in a couple of seconds than many actors can in a monologue.

It seems that the title could have been less descriptive. I was dwelling on the ""traitor"" concept and on whose side he was, rather than watching the film and then realizing it was about a traitor. Again, I just didn't want Don Cheadle to let me down and go to the dark side.

Based on the limited knowledge I have of extremists, mostly gleaned from films, the supporting actors portrayed their roles to a tee. The FBI agents were as hard-nosed as any I've seen, and it's always nice to see Jeff Daniels in anything.

1905099,4,B0000ACOXL,"It seems as though many people in the US have forgotten what happened on September 11th. Sure, the date remains fixed in our memories, but as the days progress beyond that point, we drift further and further away from the fact that an attack was launched on American soil that left 3000 dead. We feel complacent that another attack will never happen. It is such an attack that lies at the center of TRAITOR.

The film begins with a slow buildup that delivers a final punch worthy of great thrillers. The action is used sparsely but the story is more full than most films of this sort. And the acting of Don Cheadle shows just how good he truly is.

Cheadle stars as Samir Horn, born in the Sudan but now a US citizen. Having served in Afghanistan during the first initiative there, he made the decision to stay and to look deeper into the religion of his youth. This led to his becoming and explosives expert as well as an arms dealer.

Involved in a major deal, he is captured along with the group's ringleader, Omar (Said Taghmaoui). During their confinement to the typical movie style Middle Eastern prison, Omar begins to see that Samir is not your typical mercenary. Samir believes in the Koran and its teaching as witnessed in his defense of a poor prisoner by the jail yard bully.

The two become close and when the time comes for Omar to escape, he takes Samir along with him. Using his knowledge, expertise and ability to get the explosives needed for a major project they have planned, Samir becomes part of the group.

Running concurrently with this story is that of FBI agent Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce). Straight laced all the way, Clayton has been trying to stop terrorists abroad when his path crosses that of Samir. That ended when Samir went to prison. It begins anew after an explosion in Spain where Samir was sighted.

The film deals with the life of a terrorist as he plots out the next major attack. It also runs into the spy thriller mode when it shows that this group has infiltrated the US with spy cells just waiting for the command to do damage.

A major twist in the story presents itself late into the film that turns the whole story around. If you paid attention while watching the preview for the film you guessed it already. *SPOILER*  It turns out that Samir is actually working for the US government in the form of official Jeff Daniels, the only person to know this fact.

The twists add to the story as Samir is conflicted in what to do. He lives to serve God and country and yet feels that to serving his country he has abandoned God. Driven to desperate acts to protect us from the terrorists, Samir does things against the teachings of God. Keep in mind we're not talking Christian/Judeo God, we're talking God from the Koran.

And that's what makes this film good on another level. It looks at the beliefs of the Koran and how the terrorists use that belief to foment the youths that they gather to die. At the same time, the sentiments of the Koran for peace are discussed.

The main plan that the terrorists have concocted is one that could happen. It involves numerous explosions all over the country at once. And the chances of Samir to stop it grow slimmer with each moment as he attempts to cover both ends of the spectrum on this plot.

Cheadle is fantastic, showing the acting skills needed to make this believable and not just making Samir another James Bond suave, sophisticate attempting to blend in. No, in Cheadle's performance we see a man conflicted who believes strongly in his religion but who knows that evil is not defeated easily.

Guy Pearce does his usual stand up job as the more by the book agent trying to protect his country at all costs. The rest of the casts do a great job as well with Neal McDonough as Pearce's more violent prone partner and Alyy Kahn as the nefarious leader of the terrorists group.

Thrillers today seem more intent on gadgets and tricks than on the gut level approach to real problems in today's world. Make no mistake, the ideas seen here seem more real than most. And those who would do this country harm remain out there. While this movie might offer entertainment, action, adventure and a great performance, it is also a sobering reminder of where we are at today.

1905101,4,B0000ACOXL,"As someone who dislikes spoilers, it is hard to understand why the people behind Traitor would name it as such.  It is easy to assume that with that name in big bold lettering above a picture of Don Cheadle (Traffic) that he would be playing a traitor.  Yet for the first third of the two hour film it is ambiguous who the title refers to and you just wait for Cheadle to show his hand even though early in the film he is imprisoned for terrorist act.

His arrest raises the eyebrow of the FBI, Guy Pierce (Memento) in particular.  Playing the bad cop to Pierce's good is Neil McDonough who is always a solid go to humongous tool even if he is on the right side of the law in this movie, but he does get the best lines.  Also entangled in the storyline, and the keeper of who is the traitor, is Jeff Daniels (Dumb and Dumber).

There is a big plot twist in the second third of the movie, but it has been done numerous times before so it shouldn't be that shocking as once the scene begins, it isn't hard to see what's coming.  But Cheadle pulls another twist later that more than makes up for it.  With that said, and the spoilerish title aside, Traitor is a solid film that you can tell was well research and as you can tell by the cast, it is well acted with all the actors bringing their A-game.

Don Cheadle plays a Sudanese man who is a devout Muslim with Special Forces army training who appears to be helping terrorist groups with ""random"" bombings in the name of Allah, a bit like September 11. Guy Pearce plays the FBI agent also versed in the Koran and Arab studies looking to find and put a stop to the bombings and the terrorists behind them, including Cheadle. It's difficult to summarize the plot without spoiling it but that is the jist of what happens without ruining the movie.

The acting in the film is excellent. Cheadle gives his usual phenomenal performance and his grasp of the language (what dialect I am not sure) seems to be well rehearsed, as if he has been speaking it his entire life. Pearce, who I have seen only once before in The Count of Monte Cristo, also does a great job as a stoic and confident FBI agent. The box says Jeff Daniels is in the movie also, but his role, while important, is quite small.

Traitor is about a terrorist plot to wreak havoc in the heartland of America.  At the heart of the terrorist group is an Sammy (Don Cheadle).  He saw his father get blown up in the Sudan. He was raised by his American mother until he was expelled from school and joined the Army.  But he became disallusioned in the Gulf War and has fallen in with a group that has been terriorising Europe and is now ready to strike at America. Hot on his tracks are two FBI agents (Guy Pearce and Neal McDonough)

pursuing the adult Samir who appears to be moving closer and closer to the center of a terrorist cell.  Throughout the movie Samir is portrayed as a devout Muslim, intent on living out his faith.

1905106,4,B0000ACOXL,"Without Don Cheadle, ""Traitor"" would be just another international thriller about Islamic terrorists and the Americans desperate to thwart them.  Cheadle's Samir Horn, a conflicted man born in Sudan but now an American, manages to quietly charm and thus challenge preconceived notions of what it means to be a Muslim, what it means to be a terrorist, what it means to care so deeply about an issue that you are willing to risk everything, and what it means to assume you know what lies underneath.  That Cheadle can convey all this in an otherwise impassive expression is impressive.

The film opens first with Samir as a boy witnessing his father's death in a car bomb, and then with him as an adult in the midst of a secret arms deal in Yemen interrupted by a surprise police raid.  When Samir earns the respect of fellow Muslim convicts, the film starts down the labyrinth of terrorist cells, motives, and subterfuge, followed step by step by two eager FBI agents (Guy Pearce, memorable as Agent Clayton, and Neal McDonough).

When the film started, I was worried that it would play into all the stereotypes that put Muslims into a neat box labeled ""terrorists,"" but Samir's girlfriend, whom he leaves behind, is an intelligent professional outraged  that the man she loves has dirtied the name of their faith.  And even some of the terrorists have doubts about what they are doing.  The behavior of the Americans isn't always ethical, either.  At the core of the movie, however, are two men, Samir and Clayton, who believe deeply in the line between right and wrong and who rely on their separate faiths.  Cheadle is more memorable in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hotel-Rwanda/dp/B0007R4T3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hotel Rwanda</a>, and Pearce more memorable (ha!) in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Memento/dp/B00003CXZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Memento</a>, but both do admirable jobs in this film.

Traitor is one of those movies that's gonna leave you thinking.  The start of the movie some may think it's a bit slow, but it gives you the upbringing of the main character (Don Cheadle), thus leading to his beliefs during the film.

The movie is right up there with the Bourne movies (and in many ways the two main characters are alike), but I think Traitor leaves you thinking about the ending and your beliefs.

1905111,5,B0000ACOXL,"Jeffrey Nachmanoff's ""Traitor"" is a tense, well-paced thriller that keeps us on the edge of our seat, at the same time aiming for our most visceral and human emotions.  It challenges us to consider the border between political and religious extremism and sincere, deeply held patriotism and faith.  I was a little surprised that Kennedy Center Honoree Steve Martin, better known for Wild and Crazy comedy, wrote the story Nachmanoff adapted into a taut screenplay.

Don Cheadle should receive an Oscar nomination in the lead role of Samir Horn.  Samir is not a one-dimensional character and Cheadle embodies him with a focused yet larger than life performance.

In the opening scene we see a young Samir in Sudan, in a room praying with his devout Muslim father.  Then something happens that we have no trouble understanding colors Samirs thoughts and beliefs and motivations for the rest of his life.

We see Samir in modern times dealing sophisticated explosives to an Islamic terrorist group in Yemen.  Government agents burst in on the deal, taking Samir and the terrorists into custody.  It is implied in Yemen this involves frequent beatings and long imprisonment.

We are introduced to a pair of FBI agents.  Max, the hot-headed one is played by Neal McDonough.  The thoughtful one, Roy Clayton, is played by Guy Pearce, who grew up in Australia but once again immerses himself in the role of an American so well I had no difficulty believing Roy is the son of a Southern Baptist Minister. (I'm the son of a Roy and a Southern Baptist myself.)  Roy is the second most important character in the film.  He became interested in Arabic culture in college, and now works for the FBI combating terrorism.  Astute and perceptive, he understands that Samir has a sincere muslim belief and is not simply interested in blowing up all things not muslim.

We find later that Samir is deeper still.  Jeff Daniels plays Carter, a U.S. Intelligence officer, the only person alive who knows that Samir is a double agent sent to infiltrate a secret Islamic terrorist organization.

Much of the suspense in the film is generated because Carter (and by extension the audience) doesn't know if Samir has ""gone to the other side"".

Said Taghmaoui plays Omar, a member of the secret terrorist group who brings Samir into the fold, and in another fine wrinkle of the textured screenplay, we get to see many shades of gray even among the terrorists.

The film asks difficult questions and does not imply that there are easy - or any - answers.  If you have the most sincere patriotism or faith, how many innocent people can you kill in the name of your country or faith?  Fanatics may answer ""however many it takes"", but Samir and Roy both have doubts, and you believe that their personal faith informs their decisions.

This is a thoughtful thriller and if you're interested in such things - you should see it.  The Lord bless and keep you: As-Salamu `Alaikum.",1231027200,3,2945,4.809145129224652
1905112,3,B0000ACOXL,"I'm torn about my review of this movie.  On the one hand, ""Traitor"" is certainly not without its merit.  Though I guessed very early on what was going to happen, there were still exciting moments in the film.  I thought the acting was good.  As with any movie of this type, you have to ""stretch your imagination"" here and there.

On the other side of the coin, why?  Why another movie that does nothing but show Muslims in a negative light?  Another Muslims = terrorists movie?  If Hollywood wants to produce such movies, then why not have a ""good"" movie about brave Afghan fighters (who are Muslim) going after the Taliban?  If you want to throw-in some U.S. Special Forces, then be my guest. ;-)  If this movie had been about one or two rogue Muslims, and the rest of the Muslim world (along with the Americans) fight against them. . .then again, perhaps I would feel differently. .  .. but certainly this movie does not do anything to improve American ideas about Muslims, and I expect it does just the opposite, feeds the hatred.  FYI, I'm not a Muslim, but I think it's unfair to characterize / judge or stereotype a certain group of people as has been done to Muslims, especially since 9/11.

From beginning to end, Don Cheadle comes across as being VERY uncomfortable.  I wonder if he is really questioning whether he should have made this movie or not.

I'm still giving this movie three-stars, because I didn't hate it.  I for one can certainly look past the stereotypes and it was an entertaining film.  But I challenge Hollywood to have more ""positive"" Muslim rolls.",1230854400,2,1577,4.594982078853047

1905120,5,B0000ACOXL,"Indeed, as the tagline for ""Traitor"" states, the truth is complicated.  As the film progresses, it becomes ever more complicated.  Soon Samir Horn, the traitor, is unable to tell anyone the truth about who he really is.  He is trapped in many prisons, both physical and spiritual, and is being pulled in many directions.

  I am reviewing the Anchor Bay release of ""Traitor.""  Normally, I don't watch the DVD's special features; however, ""Traitor"" was so intriguing that I couldn't resist.  The commentary provided by director Jeffrey Nachmanoff (screenwriter of ""The Day After Tomorrow"") and lead actor Don Cheadle (who portrayed Samir Horn) was outstanding.  During many commentaries, the actors and production crew reminisce about past events that have nothing to do with the film.  Not so with ""Traitor.""  I soon learned that the Yemen scenes were filmed in beautiful Morocco.  Nachmanoff foolhardily didn't get a permit to film in London's subways.  Cheadle was clipped by a car while being filmed crossing a street.  Many of the Moroccan extras used in the prison scenes couldn't speak English but were fine actors in their own right.  Several Muslim actors gave advice on Muslim customs and beliefs that were incorporated into the film.  Nachmanoff's younger brother, a lawyer, gave him legal jargon for the film.  I also learned that Cheadle and Guy Pearce are very athletic and did a lot of their own stunts.  Most importantly, Nachmanoff stated how he wanted to focus on the journey that Samir Horn undertakes rather than the ultimate act of terrorism at the film's finale.  Don Cheadle so aptly describes his character as being "". . . Caught between a rock and a hard place.""

  The commentary was also educational.  I learned that Nachmanoff distinguished certain scenes from others by using the bleached bypass process which gives a scene a lighter, bleached-out look.  (Personally, I didn't care for this effect.)  Some buildings were extended by using CGI.  Cranes were used to create unusual overhead camera angles.

  In order to give ""Traitor"" an international flavor, the film was shot in Morocco, London, Toronto, Marseilles, Chicago, and Washington D.C.  The viewer will appreciate and learn more about these locales, especially those in Morocco, if they watch the DVD`s special feature:  ""International Espionage:  An In-Depth Look at Traitor's Exotic Locations.""  (Morocco is gorgeous; I'd love to go there on vacation.)  It was interesting to learn that few sets were built.  Most scenes were filmed by small crews on location.

  The viewer will see Cheadle train for the prison fight scenes in ""Action!  The Stunts and Special Effects of Traitor.""  This short feature was exceptionally fun to watch.  We learn that Cheadle has a background in fighting.  We witness cars and buildings explode.  We also learn how the stunt is performed when a young terrorist is thrown off a bridge and onto the train tracks below.

  Overall, the features for the Anchor Bay release of ""Traitor"" are excellent.  My only complaints was that there isn't a special feature that provides the deleted scenes.  Cheadle and Nachmanoff spoke about them, making me wish I could view them.  Also, the print for the names of locations was very small.  I had to scoot closer to the television to see them.  Same with the subtitles for those speaking in Arabic.  You had to look hard and pay close attention because they were small and were soon gone.  Also, Anchor Bay's release didn't have a reproduction of the movie poster like so many others have had.  However, I am thankful that there are English subtitles for the hearing impaired, like myself, and the film is presented in anamorphic widescreen with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1.  Inside the DVD jewel case, there are two $3 coupons that can be used towards the purchases of ""Righteous Kill"" and ""Surfer, Dude.""  (I have scanned and posted the DVD jacket, the coupons, and the disc.)  Also, the trailers included on the disc are for the following features:  ""Righteous Kill"" (looks like an excellent police saga starring Al Pacino and Robert Deniro), ""The Visitor"" (great drama, which I have already reviewed), ""Henry Poole is Here"" (looks bizarre but warmhearted), and ""Sleepwalking"" (another sweet drama I'd like to see.)

  As far as the film itself, I have not seen a more emotionally charged story dealing with terrorism since ""The Siege.""  Everyone gave excellent performances, especially Don Cheadle who deserves an Oscar.  His facial expressions were incredible.  I felt a lot of sympathy for his character, Samir Horn.  He is torn between his loyalty towards Islam and loyalty towards his country.  Most everyone thinks he's a traitor, including himself.  He begins to think that he has betrayed Islam for the innocent lives that have been lost.  To make matters worse, he virtually has no one to turn to but Allah.  Horn's mom, however, seems to have faith that he is still a good man.

  Anchor Bay`s release of ""Traitor"" is highly recommended viewing for those who enjoy political espionage thrillers.  You will be on the edge of your seat for the last fifteen minutes, as I was.  My heart was pounding in my chest.  The ending was a shocker.

1905124,4,B0000ACOXL,"Premise: Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce) and Neal McDonough (did not catch the character's name) are FBI agents who are investigating several suicide bombings around the world. Their main suspect, Samir Horn (Don Cheadle)- an American citizen, seems to be clearly connected to the extremist group claiming responsibility for the bombings. As Samir masterfully evades the agents, Clayton comes to realize that everything is not as it seems and evidence is not as clear-cut as he first believed it to be. (I don't think I can say much more without giving away the whole movie)

My main gripe with the 'Traitor' was the muddled beginning, - it was not very clear what was going on, who was doing what. Once I got past the first 10-15 minutes (and they dragged on), I found the movie to be quite interesting. Suicide bombings and extremist Islamic groups have become popular topics in recent years, but 'Traitor' does a great job at delving further into the operations of a terrorist group, and the thought process of a suicide bomber. I am not an expert and cannot judge the accuracy of the movie, but I feel that the 'Traitor' gave be a better understanding of how such groups may work. Furthermore, I think the director and writer of 'Traitor' took the dangerous step of creating characters who are terrorists, but whom many people will sympathize with. Normally, terrorists are bad guys with no ifs and buts about it; in 'Traitor', some terrorists are deeply religious individuals whose faith is used against them.

I found 'Traitor' to be a very enjoyable and insightful movie, but I agree with other reviews in that the PG-13 rating is not appropriate.",1230508800,2,1647,4.836879432624113
1905125,4,B0000ACOXL,"A good movie that makes you think, as other reviewers have indicated.  From the beginning I was drawn to trying to figure out Cheadle's character (Samir Horn - the main character) - a devout Muslim clouded in ambiguity.  In one of the first scenes, we observe him as a boy in Yemen witnessing his Sudanese father's murder via a terrorist attack - then we quickly jump to the present where for the first chunk of the film Horn is seemingly drawn into the terrorists' world and planning/executing major attacks on civilians.  During this time we also find out that Horn's mom is American, and that Horn is a veteran of the U.S. Special Armed Forces, as well as witness flashes of his character, which is grounded in his Muslim beliefs - i.e. his concern for other, belief in non-violence/murder.  While being drawn in by the depth of his character, you start to wonder if you're being made to sympathize for a terrorist - perhaps this is the statement of the movie.  Just before this happens however, clues begin to appear about Horn's true intentions - though up until the end of the movie you are kept to wonder how it will all ""work out"".

Even after discovering how Horn fits into this whole mess, the ambiguity of his character remains; one divided between loyalties to his faith, his country, and to the greater good.  For example, his faith is against murder - yet for Horn to accomplish his ""mission"" he has to keep pushing deeper and deeper into a terrorist network, even as more innocent people are murdered or threatened during the course of his actions.  In doing so, he seems to be going for the greater good - but having trouble fitting that into his faith's ideological framework.  All the while his country looms in the background - partly on his side, partly the enemy.

Other points I liked about the movie - I thought it did a good job of portraying aspects of the true Muslim faith - and showing a division between this and the ""extremists"" who claim the same faith.  To some degree - and I hesitate to say this - it also showed aspects of the other side by humanizing parts of the ""terrorists"" - such as the Omar character.  Yes - terrorism is terrible - but I think its needs to be understood that these individuals do not just sprout out from Satan, but are drawn into what they do by complex factors that - the more we understand the more we can move closer to ridding our world of such actions/murder.",1230508800,3,2424,4.5091324200913245

1905127,1,B0000ACOXL,"Weren't we past this?  I really thought we were.  When are people going to get past this whole ""black bar"" issue?  Growing up as a fan of widescreen was not easy for me.  Having to deal with VHS, for many years I couldn't watch movies any other way except for the 1.33:1 aspect ratio (full screen), when some of my favorite films were filmed in 2.35:1 (cinemascope).  Then DVD came along, as well as some informative sites, and widescreen was finally getting some much needed attention.  Now we live in the year 2008 (soon to be 2009).  People are educated.  We know the difference between full screen and widescreen.  Widescreen TV's are almost common now.

This whole ""black bars"" complaint nonsense should be behind us.  Yet it's not.  Here I sit with a new movie, ""Traitor,"" staring Don Cheadle, and the movie starts with the dreaded words I hoped to never read again: This film has been modified from it's original version. It has been formatted to fit your screen.  When the title starts it's in it's 2.35:1 aspect ratio, but once the titles are over and the movie starts it switches to 1.78:1, the size of a widescreen LCD/plasma.  I couldn't believe.  We're finally at the point where most studios are refusing to released cropped and modified DVD transfers, and here we have a movie that's been released on DVD in a cropped only version?  Not only that, it's cropped for widescreen TV's, an audience who likely knows what the black bars are for.

This is offensive on so many levels I can't tell you.  I have no idea if the BluRay edition has this problem, but if it does, then buyers should return it and demand a refund.  Altering the image, even when it's altered 25% as opposed to 40%, is not allowed under any circumstances.

Opps, it appears I forgot to review the movie.

Well, the movie stars Don Cheadle as an FBI agent who's accused of being a traitor to the United States.  And the movie...well, the movie pretty much goes on from there.  Depending how early you figure out the secret will determine how much enjoyment you get out of the film.  I found it pretty predictable myself, but your millage may vary.  Sadly, even if this was Oscar worthy material I couldn't recommend this DVD with it's cropped image.  I suggest you stay away and let studios know that we, as true movie fans, will not accept cropped transfers, widescreen or not.  We want the original images, the way they were supposed to be seen.",1230422400,4,2429,4.575406032482599
1905128,1,B0000ACOXL,"Some might not agree, but I thought this movie was one of the most boring movies of the year.  Every movie I have ever seen with Don Cheadle has been terrible.  I turned Traitor off about halfway through as it was like watching paint dry.",1230422400,3,238,4.266666666666667
1905129,3,B0000ACOXL,"The cast, while not exactly box-office gold, is impeccable. Not one of them could give a bad performance if they tried. And, the film has some important things to say about stereotyping, racial profiling, and jumping to conclusions that, in today's climate, NEED to be said. So it's more than a little disappointing that the writing and direction are so, basically, pedestrian. Is Cheadle's character a terrorist? Or a patriot? Are terrorists monsters or, if you're on their side, patriots? Does the end justify the means? What if the end is vile to us, but not to others? Don't worry, I'm not going to answer any of these questions. The problem is, neither does the film or, more accurately, the answers it offers are either glib or non-responsive to the bigger picture it tries to present. Nevertheless, it is a far more worthy use of any thinking person's time than a whole slew of bigger, more successful at the box office, flicks. An honorable failure... but, yes, a failure, nonetheless.",1230422400,3,993,4.847058823529411

1905131,3,B0000ACOXL,"Throughout both 2007 and 2008, moviegoers saw what seemed like an endless string of movies focusing on or around the ongoing War on Terror. For a majority of these films, which ranged from character dramas (""Stop-Loss"" or ""Grace is Gone""), political thrillers (""Lions for Lambs"" or ""Rendition""), to just good ol' fashioned action films (""The Kingdom""), the response from audiences was far from welcoming. Most of these titles, along with a few others I didn't mention, suffered through a rather brief stint at the box office and didn't enjoy much more success on DVD. To me the lacking success for these films would seem to be enough to get the studios' attention, and make them aware that audiences just don't want to go to the movies to watch something that involves a topic that can be seen daily on any news channel known to man.

Regardless of all of this, the political thriller ""Traitor"" starring Don Cheadle and Guy Pearce was released to theaters this summer. If memory serves me, this is merely the latest film released in the War on Terror genre; I'm calling it a genre due to the surprisingly large number of movies based on the subject that has been released thus far. I personally question the reasoning behind even releasing this movie in the first place, especially in light of all the losses the studios have accrued over the previous films; but I guess the various studio executives share a sort of ""It only takes one to make a difference"" mentality. So, does ""Traitor"" have what it takes to win over audiences even with the touchy subject matter or does it fall prey to the same general lack of interest that has befallen the rest of the genre?

After a series of terrorist attacks in various locations around the Middle East and Europe, along with a prison break in Yemen, the U.S. government is desperately seeking answers as to who is responsible, especially in light of a new threat targeting the country's heartland. Assisting in the investigation is FBI agent Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce) who finds himself with a rather short list of suspects, and one man on his list is raising his suspicions more than the others. The person of interest is a former U.S. Special Operations officer named Samir Horn (Don Cheadle), who appears to have become involved with the very group that may be responsible for the attacks. However, appearances may be deceiving as the further agent Clayton digs, the more evidence he discovers to suggest that perhaps the truth is much more complicated than it initially appeared to be.

What are the key components that are vital to a movie for it to be considered a thriller? Is it a great story, terrific actors and actresses, a hefty dose of the unexpected, or a general sense of uncertainty that will cause the audience to be on the edge of their seats at all times? The answer is that it's not just one of these items, it is all of them. Each of these components are key to creating a top-notch thriller that will keep audiences entertained and enthralled from start to finish, and possibly creating repeat business if all goes well for the film.

In the case of ""Traitor"" many of those items were present, but not all of them. For the ones that made it into the film, there didn't appear to be any emphasis on consistently maintaining the quality of these components throughout the duration. What I mean by that statement is when there were genuinely thrilling sequences or moments of the unexpected, they would either end in a way that made them feel unoriginal or be followed shortly thereafter by something so obviously tired and clich that you would have to be a fool not to notice. Basically just when the movie seems to be heading in the right direction it falls apart prematurely.

The story for this film is intriguing, and the fact that we are delivered a viewpoint from both sides, lends the film some credit for trying to flesh out the how's and why's of the ongoing war. However, writer/director Jeffrey Nachmanoff (writer of ""The Day After Tomorrow""), fails to create a completely engaging film due to falling prey to numerous movie pitfalls; such as, an overuse of character stereotypes for both the terrorists and the government agents, predictability within the story, and essentially becoming too trite and generic in the end. Perhaps if the screenplay had been more polished and willing to go even deeper into the more unexplored areas of the war, which it drifted in and out of throughout the film's duration, and not been so overbearing with its various messages it was trying to get across; then perhaps the final product would have been better received, at least by this viewer.

Even if the movie's storyline did run into its fair share of problems, one aspect of the film that cannot be slighted is the generally high-caliber cast, led by the talented Don Cheadle (""Hotel Rwanda""). Cheadle gives a terrific performance as Samir, a man who has sacrificed so much in this war, to the point that he wonders if it will ever be enough; especially in light of the regret he feels over some of the decisions he's had to make along the way. In the role of the closest person Samir has to a friend, and one of the terrorist group's masterminds, is actor Said Taghmaoui (""Vantage Point""). Said brings a fresh, new approach to the terrorist type of role, not allowing him to be portrayed in a hackneyed, cookie cutter cut-out sort of way that I had expected. At times he almost gives his character a sense of morality (twisted as it may be), while providing some form of reasoning and motives for why he is willing to do and plan the horrendous acts his group will commit.

As far as the quality of the characters goes, the two listed above is where the truly developed characters meet their end, and the stereotypical ones begin. Leading the way are actors Guy Pearce (""The Count of Monte Cristo"") and Neal McDonough (""Walking Tall""), who are both very talented actors in their own right, yet find themselves misused in this film. The two actors portray your typical, garden variety FBI duo; one of the agents is a level-headed, eternal optimist (Pearce) who believes in a suspect until he or she is proven guilty, and the other is a hot-headed pessimist (McDonough) who would rather lock a suspect up and throw away the key than actually get to any answers. Alongside them is Jeff Daniels (""Gettysburg"") as your typical government handler who knows much more about what is occurring than he is letting on, and for the sake of his mission and secrecy (and the storyline), he keeps the facts from everyone.

Lastly, the various actors portraying the many members of the terrorist group were given the least to do in the entire storyline. Aside from Said's character, the other terrorists were nothing more than a bunch of nameless, evil men with no rhyme or reason to their apparent madness, who want nothing more than wanton violence and destruction to engulf the ""evil"" United States and its allies. Please, spare me the same old semantics I've seen and heard so many times before, it's beginning to grow tiresome. It's a shame that more wasn't done to capitalize on the talent at this film's disposal. At least, the entire cast did the best they could with the material they were given, so even at its most predictable and unoriginal moments, the film remains better than average.

While ""Traitor"" did manage to keep me moderately interested from start to finish, albeit to varying degrees of interest; the movie's various pratfalls causes the film to devolve into being just another generic political thriller with high aspirations, yet poor execution.

""Traitor"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",1230336000,7,7673,4.753753753753754
1905132,4,B0000ACOXL,"The movie was very good but some may not like it due to the subject matter. It isn't as much an action movie, more about beliefs and convictions of those associated with terrorism. Don Cheadle gives an amazing performance as usual. The ending is especially satisfying. The blu-ray video quality was good, nothing special. The audio is TrueHD but I don't think it added as much compared to other blu-rays with lossless audio. Surrounds were not prominent even during some of the action sequences.",1230249600,,495,4.904761904761905
1905133,3,B0000ACOXL,"Don Cheadle is one of my favorite actors, and one of the best in Hollywood. His role as Paul Rusesabagina in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hotel-Rwanda/dp/B0007R4T3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hotel Rwanda</a>&nbsp;is breathtakingly good. So despite mixed reviews, I knew I'd be watching TRAITOR. I'm very glad I did.

The War on Terror, the Iraqi occupation, and America's role in foreign affairs has been a popular topic in film of late. While most of these films were of poor quality (not the material just the films), and few had commercial success, these movies have intrigued me to no end. Weather the examination of extremism in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Mighty-Heart/dp/B000VBB6F6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Mighty Heart</a>&nbsp;or the guns&grit of a film like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jarhead/dp/B001FFBI82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jarhead</a>, I find these movies captivating for the simple reason that much of what takes place in them is as hard to quantify as the real events on which they are based. Aside from those on the the extremes of both political parties who see only in black or white, the majority of what has happened post 9-11 falls into a variety of shades of gray. Traitor is no exception.

Formulaic at its core (how far will the protagonist push to achieve the 'greater good,' combined with an over taught story with loose ends galore) the film does ask valuable questions, usually through the experience of the protagonist Samir Horn, a former operative, now major suspect in a terrorism case. Cheadle gives Samir a depth and resonance of character that a lesser actor would turn into a mere stereotype. Cheadle proves once again that good acting can elevate marginal material.

The questions surrounding Samir are counterbalanced by Guy Pearce's character Roy Clayton, a by-the-book FBI agent with seemingly no imagination who is responsible for tracking down Horn. The more Pearce searches, the more information and leads he discovers, the more Horn appears guilty. Of course things are never that simple, and its here where Pearce is strangely unable to anticipate other outcomes than Horn's ultimate guilt.

About the lengths that an individual may go to provide 'security' for his country, it is only Cheadle's nuanced portrayal of the enigmatic Horn that makes this movie more than a popcorn spectacle. In his adept hands, it becomes a character study posing as a spy thriller, and a movie well worth watching. 3.5/5 stars.",1230249600,,2610,5.824607329842932
1905134,4,B0000ACOXL,"This was an excellent movie, a very intriguing and topical story involving terrorism with the basic message that there are good and bad people everywhere, of all races, religions, sects, whatever.  The question in this film, for at least half of the movie, is: ""Is Samir (Don Cheadle) a good guy or a bad guy?""

I don't want to say too much in fear of spoiling anything because that could easily be done while discussing this film. Suffice to say that this will keep your interest for the full running time and is a thinking person's movie more than most.

Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Neal McDonough, Said Taghmaoui and Alyy Kahn are all fantastic in the lead roles. The direction and photography also is top-notch.  Those who pick apart this movie nit-picking because it's a very entertaining film while not overdoing the action or the stereotypical characters.

Like any undercover person the job is a rough one that takes a terrible toll on the infiltrator.

The supporting cast is excellent as well  and this is a A list movie with A list talent all the way. What makes this story interesting as well is the focus on the decent Muslims who feel that terrorists have hijacked their religion and then fight back against them. Sadly there are too many silent voices in that regard accross the world.  Like most modern movies this movie just shines on blu ray, there isn't a line or smudge in site.
