8483316,3,B005QD7YC8,The film arrived on or about 18 February which was reasonable given Tasmania is fairly isolated. When i opened the plastic container splinters of plastic fell away from the sides. I did not get around to playing it until last night 26 February and all went well except for a two blank short scenes which I put down to the age of the film. Bur the last five minutes of the film was incomprehensible due to the fact it obviously had a severe bash in the post. .,1361836800,,459,4.2272727272727275
