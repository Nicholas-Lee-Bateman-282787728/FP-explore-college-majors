6477900,5,B00L9KN1TM,"In the American movie ""7500"" aka ""Flight 7500"", a supernatural force terrorizes airline passengers. The movie was originally slated for an August 2012 American theatrical released date. Each year since 2012, the released date continues to be pushed to the next year. Not sure when, if ever, this movie will be made available to the American audience. Fortunately, you can purchase a German Blu-Ray copy of the movie from Amazon.com that plays in ""All Regions"" worldwide. You can choose the audio in English or German. After waiting to see this movie since 2012, I finally got a Blu-Ray copy from Germany on April 1, 2015. I must say that it is one of the best American airplane supernatural movies ever! Thank you Germany.",1428364800,8,722,4.878048780487805
6477901,5,B00L9KN1TM,The ending surprised me.  I liked the characters and the idea of the movie.,1426809600,,75,4.357142857142857
6477902,5,B00L9KN1TM,Excellent movie with a great twist ending!!!,1423785600,,44,5.428571428571429
6477903,3,B00L9KN1TM,"Worth adding to your horror collection.  The story revolves around several crew and passengers with issues they need to resolve.  It ends up becoming a ""message film"" about letting go of the things that hang you up.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but there is something awkward about the blocking which makes it look like a made for tv film whenever there is more than two people involved.  I liked it, though.  It grips you and holds your attention to the end.  There is a very cheap jump scare at the end but don't let that way you down.",1417996800,3,544,4.284313725490196

8664663,4,B00L9KN1TM,"This German import Blu-ray lists the running time at 88 minutes but states that it's uncut? However, IMDb lists three running times for this film: 80 mins, 85 mins and 97 minutes. The recently released DVD is actually 80 minutes, although Amazon incorrectly lists it at
1 hour 37 minutes.

This Blu-Ray offers no special features except the trailer. There is also no option for closed caption subtitles. You do have the English and German language option only.

As for the film, flight 7500 is certainly creepy. It builds it's suspense by creating an atmosphere of dread, and If you're afraid of flying, the impact of this film might make it even more frightening. The film is reminiscent
of an old Twilight Zone episode called ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"" which it even pays a quick homage too.

As the overnight flight makes its way over the Pacific Ocean, the passengers encounter what appears to be a supernatural force in the cabin. Flight 7500 is well acted and directed, but not for those who prefer their horror in a more rapid fire style. This is a creepy supernatural ghost story with a strong, capable cast and solid direction.",1454371200,3,1136,4.756345177664975
8664664,4,B00L9KN1TM,Nice and seller highly recommended,1450396800,,34,6.0
8664665,1,B00L9KN1TM,"I love horror movies, if their done right, this one wasn't.
I coughed up a whopping $31.00 for this movie based of the following : The movie trailers make it seem scarier than it is and this was a import from Germany because although it was an American movie with well known American actors was never released for sale in America.
If your thinking of purchasing this movie, don't !
Rent it, stream it whatever first you'll be glad you did and not feeling taken like I did.",1442275200,3,472,4.375

8664667,3,B00L9KN1TM,"Takashi Shimizus 7500 follows the story of the crew and passengers on Flight 7500 from Los Angeles to Tokyo who experience strange things onboard after a person dies in a bizarre way. Is there any supernatural power going on behind this? Or are they seeing things that are not simply there?

Though a feature film, 7500 looks more like an extended episode of a TV series like The Twilight Zone. The film keeps us waiting for what we expect to see  what it is depends on you  but, in spite of the atmospheric photography of David Tattersall (The Green Mile), the wait is long (and pretty boring) and the payoff is not big enough.

Director Takashi Shimizu is best known for his Ju-On series (that was remade as The Grudge franchise in America). Here clearly he attempts to do something different, with characters whose back stories are explained in lengthy dialogue, but these weird things they experience do not add up to one big mystery that should keep the viewers intrigued.

The result is a series of details of strange events most of which are left unexplained or explained in an unsatisfactory way. Some of those events are scary, to be sure, but once the film is over, we find ourselves thinking to ourselves: Is that all?",1438646400,3,1229,4.645161290322581
8664668,5,B00L9KN1TM,great movie. Don`t know why it won`t release in the US.,1434672000,,55,4.090909090909091

8664670,5,B00L9KN1TM,Saw coming attractions on TV.  Movie didn't appear in local theaters.  Watched for it but nothing.  Finally a few years later saw an ad for the English version.  Bought it and it was very good.  Came from another country.,1433980800,3,221,4.564102564102564
