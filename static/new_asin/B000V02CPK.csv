An absolutely useless dvd.  50% of the dvd is pre-race, with useless statements a la NASCAR (""our frito-lay buick ran good, and we hussled hard"").  the driving sequences are way to brief to analyse driver errors, and some are cut off!!.",1203465600,,404,7.375
8216039,5,B000V02CPK,"I bought this to watch the debut of the Peugeot 908.  The DVD really captured the hype of Peugeot w/ their stunning qualy lap, all to go to waste at the first corner of the race.  The Corvette vs. Aston battle is still there, along with all the Porsches and Ferraris in the GT2 class.

They finally got rid of the repeating sections (the latest Le Mans DVD I have is 2003), which was a total waste of space.  I'm glad they added the onboard laps from the Audi and Peugeot; next review maybe they can add one from each of the classes.  I would also like to see more footage about the lesser known cars, like the JLOC Lamborghini.  I recommend this DVD",1201478400,,650,4.201612903225806
8216040,3,B000V02CPK,"I have ordered every Le mans 24hrs dvd since 2002. I have all of them since the year 2002 as well as 1998 and the 1999 race. I must admit that the 2007 le mans dvd was shorter in length than the previous 5 dvd races. It is ironic because the 2007 le mans 24 hrs was reduced by an hour or two due to rain, the dvd goes through the race quickly and does not give detail information as the previous dvd's. Over all the race is exciting but the dvd should have been better!",1197072000,4,469,3.8958333333333335
