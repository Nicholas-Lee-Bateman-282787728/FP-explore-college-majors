956950,4,6305052212,If you want some good old comedy then this is it. Stephen Chow is a master at making you laugh. Over the top to say the least. It is really good to have around to cheer me up. So pop some corn and enjoy a good laugh.,1238976000,,216,3.617021276595745
956951,3,6305052212,"Dragon Dynasty finally releases something from Stephen Chow. What we get is the Royal Tramp films which are really just one long film.

Chow is young and charming and Sharla Cheung(the queen mother) is a stunning beauty but the films are all over the place. The first film is an enjoyable, early 90's Chinese comedy. The second film gets messy with too many new characters continually being introduced and confusing plot twists. The second film gets pretty stupid and is not near as funny or entertaining.

Not a bad release from Dragon Dynasty. They certainly have done worse.",1232668800,6,577,4.877551020408164
956952,4,6305052212,"I've enjoyed Stephen Chow in Kung Fu Hustle and Shaolin Soccer, so I figured I'd give The Royal Tramp Collection a try, and I wasn't disappointed. The pair of stories about a conman who inadvertently befriends the emperor of China (and beds and marries his spoiled sister!), while simultaneously defusing multiple competing plots to overthrow the dynasty, is hilarious in its zany unlikelihood. The films combine excellent kung fu action and slapstick comedy in an entertaining package. Be sure to watch them with the English language track. The voice acting is nothing special, but the translation captures a lot more of the humor than the lackluster subtitles.",1216684800,2,662,5.196261682242991
956953,3,6305052212,I watched this and enjoyed the fun of it. Wasn't to serious but I got to relax. Thanks,1206835200,,86,3.8333333333333335
956954,5,6305052212,Great deal for movies that are fun to watch with lots of interesting twists and turns.  I've been keeping a watch out for new DVDs for him especially after watchin Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle. I'm happy to have these in my collection.,1205107200,,240,4.454545454545454
956955,5,6305052212,"This is a classic Stephen Chow movie and one of the funniest. No doubt he is the king of comedy. He is great in the role of the hapless but cool guy (just watch the castration scene...). He is really skillful and has a vast range of expressions (well, I think you can compare him to Jim Carrey... in some ways but not in total). Though the movie has lots of sexual spoof, I think is not insulting; I read that Cantonese comicality is difficult to understand to foreign... well, I don't find it so different from the Italian one!
Some unavoidable presences in the movie: Ng Man Tat (Hoi Tai Fu) that is (I think) in 90% of SC's movies (and this is good, they are GREAT together) - Chingmy Yau (Princess Kim Ning) - Sandra Ng Kwan Yue (Sister Bond) -  Man Cheung (Empress Dowanger/Lone-er).
And remember: always watch a SC's movie in the ORIGINAL language or you'll miss the best...",1054684800,3,880,4.398773006134969
956956,5,6305052212,"This was one of the first DVDs I bought for my collection after getting a DVD player.  The plot is engaging and extermely well-written, and the brilliant physical comic performances of Stephen Chow and Ng Man Tat work wonderfully even for someone like myself who needs the subtitles to follow the story.
Be aware, though, that ""Royal Tramp"" and ""Royal Tramp 2"" are a single story split into two parts, rather than just a movie and its sequel.  Be sure to get both.
Also, this movie is based in the only story by Louis Cha that is currently available in translation.  The title of the book is usually translated as ""The Duke of Deer Mountain"", but the English translation (in 3 volumes) is called ""The Deer and the Cauldron"",  Volumes 1 (ASIN 0195903234) and 2 (ASIN 0195903250) have just recently been reprinted, and Volume 3 (ASIN 0195903277) is due out in September 2001.",995500800,10,873,4.686274509803922
956957,4,6305052212,"This movie was loose based upon the 80'HK tv series starring Andy Lau and Tony Leung. This is probably Chow Sing Chi best movie. I've seen some of  his film's including the sequel. But this one is better. Royal Tramp is  about Wai Siew Po, a nobody who tell stories in a whorehouse where his  sister works. He becomes a member of the royal staff and is appointed to  Hoi Kong Kong, while he still remains a rebel against the Chings. The story  is redecules, but that's what we aspect from a Chow Sing Chi movie. The  action is marvelous, with lots of wire works. The kung fu is absolutely  fantastic. My favorite is the Fa Kwat Yu Mien Teung. Which means as much as  ""bone-melting-palm"".",969408000,8,687,4.396825396825397

7881626,3,6305052212,Good Stephen Chow film but the picture quality is quite below average for a bluray and the subtitles like Chinese Odyssey have a number of grammatical errors. Still this is the best the film has looked and sounded. I'd give it 3 1/2 but Amazon won't let me.,1464566400,,257,4.375

but by disc #2  it was hilarious.  heart warming, and funny as hell.",1365033600,3,154,4.275862068965517
7881629,5,6305052212,I remember watching these movies from when I was kid and it is awesome to know that I finally own it!!! I love Stephen Chow and you won't be disappointed by his comedic ability!!,1337558400,3,178,4.264705882352941
7881630,4,6305052212,I received the DVD on time and there weren't any problems when it came to watching it. The movies were pretty good if you are into Kung-Fu/Action movies like that.,1334620800,,163,4.466666666666667
7881631,5,6305052212,this movie is great and Stephen Chow is a crack-up. i will watch this movie many times along with all the rest of my collection. Thanks for the hook up Amazon.,1312243200,,159,4.161290322580645
7881632,4,6305052212,I reviewed several lists of best Stephen Chow movies.  These two came up consistently in top five.  Have not heard from recipient yet.,1294444800,,134,4.782608695652174
7881633,4,6305052212,"I picked this up more out of curiosity related to dragon dynasty movies than an actual knowledge of the work of Stephen Chow.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  The movie is very entertaining, but more so for its comedy than for its fight sequences (though those are pretty good as well).  I must say that after watching the first, I instantly watched the second.  Watching the second picked up almost exactly where the first one left off, making both movies being in the collection much better for fans.  As to the plot, fairly basic, an emperor, plot at assassination, and someone caught in the middle.  The real reason to watch this is the comedy, a very old school style, slapstick, physical comedy, and some low brow jokes, but all very funny.  While I wasn't aware of Stephen Chow before, I must say this makes me interested in pursuing his other work.  Recomended!",1267488000,5,877,4.64935064935065
7881634,5,6305052212,"I love these movies, they are so funny!! Much better than the Shaolin Soccer in my opinion. If you enjoyed the movie Kung Fu Hustle you should love these movies. Personally I think they are funnier.",1261180800,,198,4.527777777777778
