Even grandma enjoys it! The reason I am giving it 3 stars is because our copy had major issues with it ""sticking"".  Very disappointing and frustrating.  I should have returned it but didn't end up doing so.  My granddaughter loved it so much that I bought another copy from a different company.  However that one ""sticks"" terribly as well. (No, it's not my DVD player as I don't have this problem with any other dvds.) I was going to throw it away but my granddaughter still tries to watch it. When it gets stuck she pretends she's pausing it!",1426118400,,699,4.568

8414792,5,B0043EFAKO,"This is fantastic.  See my other review on the other Jungle Beat DVD for more info.  But these are great shorts.  They are hilariously funny.  Our son just laughs and laughs watching these things!

Keep in mind that this one is the *same* DVD as the one with just the monkey on the front.  They came out at different times - several months apart - but the shorts are exactly the same.  The only thing I think is different is that the other one might have different language choices for the titles and stuff (I don't think there's any talking on the DVD's themselves if I'm remembering right.

Great gift!",1331337600,,604,4.427272727272728
