8511038,3,B0076OB98A,The quality of these DVD's has gone down quite a bit from when we first started ordering them.  Plus the one announcer is quite annoying.  But mainly it is the quality of the sound plus the action.,1363651200,,197,4.297297297297297

8511040,2,B0076OB98A,"I love rodeo, and attend many of them. I also have a great collection of the NFR rodeo videos. I can tell you without reservation that the rodeo and the cowboys / cowgirls are great --- but I am really disappointed with the quality of the 2011 NFR video! First, just like all of the previous editions, it asks you which event you would like to watch? Let's say, like me, I want to skip down to the fourth event ""Saddle Bronc Riding"", so I select that one. After SBR is over, the other videos take you back to the main menu so you can select the next one of the seven event that you want to watch --- not this one, it automatically goes to the next event on the DVD and starts that one up, just as if you had selected ""Play All"" at the beginning. Also the sound quality is lacking. Announcers voices way back in the background, and unlike the previous videos where the announcers give you a little history of the horse / bull/ and the rider, in this one there is a lot of DEAD AIR --- many times the horse and rider or bull and rider or Barrel racer is out, finished with their run BEFORE THEIR NAME IS ANNOUNCED OR THE ANIMALS NAME THAT THEY ARE RIDING HAS EVEN BEEN ANNOUNCED. But what really ticked me off was when they panned the audience and stopped on the 5 time World Champion Saddle Bronc Rider, Billy Etbauer ---- AND NEVER ANNOUNCED TO ANYONE WHO THE MAN WAS OR WHAT HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED! WHAT AN INSULT TO BILLY --- AND TO US VIEWERS!",1344988800,,1443,4.17562724014337
