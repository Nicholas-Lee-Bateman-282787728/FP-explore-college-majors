Chock full of color, kink, and strangeness. No spoilers about the plot, but it's about the weird situations an upscale hooker finds herself in. A great film!",1473033600,,329,4.593220338983051
7728421,3,B01E04ZW1S,"Kathleen Turner's slow disappearance from the big screen after burning it up with Body Heat and Romancing the Stone is almost inexplicable.  Like most actresses she was unfairly judged by her looks, her weight and her fading sex appeal, but it seemed like it all ended far too soon.  Or maybe she just never aspired to be an empty Hollywood starlet, forever in the shadow of her Lauren Bacall-esque image.  To judge by her role in Crimes of Passion, Ken Russell's 1984 twisted relationship drama, in which her character rapes a police officer with his own nightstick, it's safe to say Turner had her own career path in mind.

Joanna Crane (Turner) is a designer by day and a dirty whore by night.  Working under the alias China Blue, complete with platinum wig, crotchless panties and a purse full of sex toys, Joanna keeps a room at a sleazy motel and lords over her loyal clientele.  But her secret identity is revealed by a part-time private investigator, Bobby (John Laughlin), and the two wind up with genuine feelings for one another after a night of paid-for passion.  Bobby's marriage to Amy (Annie Potts), which was already on the rocks, is now nothing but an inconvenience as he attempts to prove his love to Joanna...who has commitment issues of her own.  Meanwhile another threat waits on the fringes under the guise of Reverend Peter Shayne (Anthony Perkins), a perverted street preacher who sees his salvation in ""curing"" Joanna of her sinful addictions.

Crimes of Passion desperately wants to say something meaningful about '80s relationships of the emotional, physical, marital and uncommitted sort.  But Barry Sandler's script reeks of that desperation.  Even given a cinematic enema highlighted by Russell's exuberant visual signatures, the movie still feels like a puerile 13-year-old trying out dirty words for the first time.  And it's to Kathleen Turner's credit that salacious dialogue plays as well as it does.  Who else could pull off a line like, ""I never forget a face.  Especially one that I've sat on.""

Try putting those words in Jessica Rabbit's mouth!

Turner gives the role everything she's got, even if there's not much there to work with, spitting and swallowing every filthy phrase in the book.  The film simply wouldn't work without her.  And her scenes with Anthony Perkins, who's surprisingly game to suffer through not one but two Psycho references, are like twisters of torrid dialogue pulled from a failed one-act avant garde production on Beverly Boulevard.  Crimes of Passion may be nothing more than a novelty now (""See the former A-list actress give head and take names!"") but it also proves that Turner might just always have been a little too daring for the mainstream.

Arrow Video's blu-ray presentation is a tremendously colorful affair, offering the first real glimpse at how Russell's film probably played on the big screen.  A big selling point is the inclusion of the theatrical version and a longer unrated cut created by splicing in sequences from a videotape master. The extras give everyone a chance to make their case in defense of the film itself, starting with screenwriter Barry Sadler who sits down for a lengthy interview.  I'm not sure I buy his justification for the film itself, but his career history is interesting enough all on its own.  He's joined by the late Ken Russell for an audio commentary that sports some great anecdotes and info as well.  And composer Rick Wakeman, whose keyboard score dates the film more than any of the big hair or fashion choices, is given his 30-minutes of screen time.  There are also about 20-minutes of deleted scenes with commentary from Sadler as to why they were left out of the film, a music video, trailers, essays and liner notes.",1470614400,5,3744,4.904761904761905
7728422,5,B01E04ZW1S,"Its really been 32 years since I last saw Ken Russells 1984 erotic thriller Crimes of Passion but  like Body Heat which introduced me (and many others) to Kathleen Turner, there were a few scenes that were still lodged in my subconscious. With this new, beautifully restored HD, release of the film  with hours of bonus features  I got to experience it all over again and now realize how damn erotic Turners scenes were.  I also now realize that it was not as violent as I remember. Eerie, yes, but really only one or two graphically violent scenes. I also didn't remember how much full nudity there was (no frontal nudity below the waist however). Theres nothing left to the imagination as to what the , then thin, Turner looked like naked.
This film cant be taken too seriously. The acting, with the exception of Turner as hooker China Blue  a role she really plays for laughs as well as eroticism  and Anthony Perkins eating up the set as a fanatical religious sermonizer, is really stiff. Bruce Davison looks  and acts  like he just stepped out of a Beach Party movie with his hair immaculately coiffed.

The BLU ray contains TWO versions of the film, neither of which was seen in theaters. The first is the Unrated Cut which runs 112 minutes. This includes scenes that were excised by Film Company. There is also the slightly shorter Directors Cut at 107 minutes. I watched the first 15 minutes of both to compare and notice no difference to that point. I then continued with the longer one (so I cant tell you the difference). The new Transfer was made from the original film materials. There is a full length commentary by Russel and his Producer/Screenwriter Barry Sandler. (BTW, Sandler wrote some of the sexiest dialogue for Turner that I can remember in films Ive seen. There a 20 minute-plus interview with Sandler about working on both this film and his previous project with Russell, Altered States. There are seven extended or deleted scenes (almost 28-minutes) with option of hearing Sandlers commentary. (he seems flustered during these  not as composed as the straight interview  and found this hard to listen too.

Some of the scenes which were cut really would have changed the direction of the film.  The score was composed by Rick Wakeman and we get a 20 minute interview with him. He wrote the song Its A Lovely Life, whose theme plays so often in the film that it became irritating. Thankfully, there was Turner to watch (well, most of the time  When she or Perkins were not on the screen the wooden acting became very apparent). Finally there is the trailer and a music video of the Wakeman song.

If you want to realize how much the restoration helped, you have only to look at the deleted scenes. They were not restored and lack color and sharpness.

This is the second of two cult films that Arrow Home Video (distributed by Music Video Distributor)  a video company specializing in horror films - has released this summer in deluxe restored editions with hours of bonus features. I  for one  am anxious to see what else is in the pipeline from them.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

I already had a pretty good feeling I'd like it but its still a nice surprise. This was back when Kathleen Turner was sexy and she gives a great performance along with the great late Anthony Perkins. Its fun, stylish, sexy, thrilling, disturbing and funny. Arrow's blu ray is excellent with a stellar transfer and the director's cut. I got worried when I heard that the extra director's cut footage was from a videotape master and that there was a drop from quality in those scenes but I am glad to report that I didn't notice at all. The entire transfer looked incredible. Another great sexy Kathleen Turner noir film that is a must see is Body Heat. Its one of the best films ever made.",1469232000,6,829,4.3896103896103895

As another excellent review mentions, this has both versions (and as a fan of course I went right to the Unrated), and the transfer and sound are both awesome.

About the subtitles, I have to say to the person/people involved with those: whoosh, you know what that sound is?  I was shocked at how many things that were inaccurate in such a way that they apparently missed many of Kathleen Turner's funny little quips.  I hope they understand the line about TWA tea.

In the early eighties British enfant terrible Ken Russell travelled to America and placed his unorthodox imprint on a pair of US movies. The first was the Altered States, so out-there its screenwriter disowned it. The second was the equally crazy CRIMES OF PASSION, starring Kathleen Turner [Body Heat and Serial Mom] at the height of her powers.

Fashion designer Joanna Crane [Kathleen Turner] leads a double life. By night she is China Blue, a prostitute who s attracted the unwanted attention of two men. One is a sexually frustrated private detective hired by her employees. The other is psychopathic priest [Anthony Perkins] in possession of a murderous sex toy.

With its outr screenplay by Barry Sandler and over the top score by Rick Wakeman, and CRIMES OF PASSION may just be the most outrageous Ken Russell film ever made and that is quite some feat!

FILM FACT No. 1: Rock musician Rick Wakeman performed the synthesizer-heavy score, the majority of which is made up of melodies directly lifted from Czech composer Antonn Dvok's ""New World Symphony."" Rick Wakeman has an uncredited role in the film as a wedding photographer.

FILM FACT No. 2: DIRECTORS CUT: Ken Russell prepared the Directors Cut for the film CRIMES OF PASSION for the LaserDisc edition. It has been recreated for this release using standard definition inserts, resulting in occasional dips in quality.

FILM FACT No. 3: URATED CUT: The Unrated Cut is the version Ken Russell prepared for the theatrical distribution in 1984. Cut by the censors in both the UK and USA. The film played in British and American cinemas different and heavily edited and partially re-dubbed. In order to bypass this censorship, New World Pictures released a VHS tape in the USA labelled Unrated version, which contained Ken Russells intended theatrical cut.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Ken Russells 1984 film CRIMES OF PASSION is one of those films that is so barking mad and very thought provoking, that it is difficult to know where to begin when it comes to analysing what it is all about, let alone how you begin to recommend it to somebody, but at the heart of it there is an exploration of sex and relationships, that had it been handled by another director, apart from possibly David Cronenberg, it probably wouldnt be quite so thought-provoking and out there.

For all of his extravagance, Ken Russell's films have never lacked exuberance or humour, which makes the flat, joyless tone of CRIMES OF PASSION a wonderful surprise. Much of this is attributable to a screenplay by Barry Sandler and is filled with wonderful rude double-entendres and weighty ironies. Only intermittently does Ken Russell break through with the kind of over the top manic flamboyance that is so singularly and rudely all of his own doing as usual and of course the film's craziest moments, but CRIMES OF PASSION is best off when it makes the least sense. There is plenty of sexually explicit material to go around, from the stridently sexual dialogue to the lurid peep-show atmosphere in which most of the story takes place.

Kathleen Turner plays Joanna Crane, a successful sportswear designer by day but at night she becomes China Blue and the most popular hooker on her particular patch. Bobby Grady [John Laughlin], who owns a home security store but takes an extra job investigating Joanna as her boss believes she is involved in industrial espionage. Bobby Grady is married to Amy Grady [Annie Potts], his high school sweetheart, but the spark has gone right out of their marriage and is fed up trying to please his sexually frigid wife, Bobby Grady begins to develop feelings for Joanna Crane/China Blue as he discovers her secret and wants that level of excitement in his life.

This world is frequented by a woman calling herself China Blue by night, and working for a clothing manufacturer by day. China Blue attracts the fanatical attention of a deranged minister who claims he is determined to save her. This man of the cloth, Reverend Peter Shayne first seen sweaty watching a beat-up looking erotic dancer and then hysterically preaching a sermon right afterwards, is played by Anthony Perkins, who also sings ''Shout hallelujah, c'mon, get happy!'' before attempting to murder someone, which is perfect casting for his character in the film.

And whatever that means is anyones guess, although if you want to cast a sexual deviant with a perverted sense of religious righteousness then Anthony Perkins is probably the obvious choice, if not a little too obvious. However, despite the dark and seedy undertones of CRIMES OF PASSION that is a neon-lit celebration of sexual liberation and emotional disconnect as we follow China Blue on her nightly adventures satisfying all of her regular customers and seemingly enjoying it. Of course, there is a briefly mentioned of Freudian reason why China Blue is the way she is but the film never  goes too deeply into the psychology of her character, instead focusing more on the relationship between Bobby Grady and Amy  Grady, a pair of performances from John Laughlin and Annie Potts that veer from heartfelt confessional to looking like they can barely contain their laughter whilst trying to deliver some truly absurd dialogue and giving us plenty of a raving mad Anthony Perkins finally succumbing to the fact that hell always play weirdos despite his obvious range and talent; even the ending of the film echoes Anthony Perkinss better known screen persona and that characters eventual downfall, and the clarity of the CRIMES OF PASSION 2K restoration does give it away before it happens if you look.

In a bit that summarises the whole film in a nutshell, where Ken Russell filmed a music video of song Its a Lovely Life, which is just the same bit of the New World Symphony with Rick Wakemans lyrics. The video is bright and garish and gave Ken Russell a chance to give his daughters Molly and Victoria roles as well as a cameo by the musician Rick Wakeman. The music video shows a bride and groom on their happy day as the groom seeks out material wealth, in the form of silverware, while the bride seems entranced by love and or beauty, symbolically represented by doves. The conflict between which is more important, love or money, right from the beginning of the marriage leads to the quick death of love as the doves drown in the pool while the bride and groom are left as skeletons on poolside chairs, together with their wealth. The video, which Amy Grady would rather watch than engage in friskiness with Bobby Grady, is a mirror image of whats going on in their relationship in a quasi-literal sense as the bride and groom roles are reversed in Bobby Grady and Amy Grady.

CRIMES OF PASSION is a very special and definitely one of a kind film that is rich in the religious metaphor that fills most of Ken Russells work and the sexual content is as comically over-the-top as the two lead performances, full of nonsensical smut such as Anthony Perkinss Reverend Peter Shayne brandishing a huge razor-sharp dildo (it must be, as he manages to cut through ropes with it), and even the stiff turn from John Laughlin doesnt manage to bring down the air of mischievous glee that Ken Russell seems to be sprinkling liberally throughout the madness. Despite some of the places it goes to occasionally it isn't a downbeat film and it is easy to see why Arrow Video chose it to go through their restoration process as it does sit quite comfortably amongst their titles of cult oddities and looks absolutely great, but is it actually a good film? Still that is up to you to decide, but ever since I saw it in the cinema, it has been one of my all-time favourite Ken Russell film and is now pride of place in my Blu-ray Collection.

Audio Commentary with producer/screenwriter Barry Sandler and director Ken Russell: Here we are introduced to Barry Sandler, who is sitting next to Ken Russell and commenting on the film CRIMES OF PASSION with this audio commentary. They talk about the group therapy at the start of the film, which of course goes sort of full circle right at the end of the film. Ken Russell points out the composed music by Rick Wakeman, who Ken informs us that he thinks Rick Wakeman is the greatest British composer/musician ever. They both talk about the main male character John Laughlin, who at first is the uptight sexual character, who has been set up to be living the American suburban lifestyle, and especially living with his middle class frigid wife and children, and he wonders why his life is so unfulfilled, and of course eventually meets the woman that changes his life forever. Ken Russell gives great praise about the actor Anthony Perkins, in being a sort of street priest and points out his clothing looks like it has been slept in, and in fact Ken informs us that Anthony Perkins went home every night and slept in those clothes. When we see Kathleen Turner for the first time, Ken and Barry said they wanted to call her Miss America, but because of copyright infringement, they instead had to call her Miss Liberty, and they also inform us that Kathleen Turner really relished her character in the film, and Ken and Barry says that Kathleen was a great spot, but one big surprise we hear is the guy in that scene where Kathleen does her final sexual act on him while standing up, well that guy was for a while in great demand in other sexual explicit films. When we see the private sex booth with the naked dancer being watched especially with Anthony Perkins, Ken informs us that he got the idea of the sex booth when he visited one in Munich in Germany. But when Anthony Perkins stands outside the sex booth, this was actually filmed in downtown Los Angeles and all the people walking past were all extras. Ken and Barry talk about that the film was edited five times because of the censors before it was allowed to be seen in the cinema, but of course what we are viewing is now the complete film and the Directors Cut and on top of all that Ken really praises Barry for his brilliant script and at the same time Barry praises Ken for respecting his screenplay. When we see the music video, Ken talks about the material world that relates to the theme of the music video and how people even today cannot do without their obsessive material world and Ken also points out that in the music video he mentions that you view his two daughters, where it was actually filmed and of course points out Rick Wakemans brief appearance as the photographer. Barry asks Ken why this film has been such a massive cult following, and ken replies by saying, I think some of my films are ahead of their time and if The Devils film was released again in its original form, that would become a cult following, especially previously it had serious ratings problem and especially with films relating to religion and sex over tones always gets the X certificate, and of course being a lapsed catholic, cannot get it out of my system, as it is all about redemption, especially when Kathleen Turner gest dressed as a nun. Ken also points out the character of China Blue is a faade of covering up past misfortunes in her life, but at the same time is an intellectual, especially with her Eastern erotic books. When we get to 51 minutes, Barry informs us that Ken had to rush off to catch a plane, so from now on Barry is on his own talking about the film. When we get to the scene where the reverend pays China Blue $50 and gets dressed in her habit outfit, well Barry informs us that this is Barry and Kens favourite scene in the film, especially as it represents a power scenario. When we see China Blue driven to the house by the wife of the husband who has not long to live, we finally get to see that China Blue has a compassionate nature. As we are getting to near the end of the film, especially when Anthony Perkins bursts into Kathleens apartment, Barry points out that Anthony Perkins really brings out of his character into so many different emotions and really shows off his talent as an actor, with especially so may impulses and reactions, the point of trying to guess his real motive in this tense scene, which of course all is revealed in the final shocking scene. When we get to the final part of the film, where Bobby is back with the group therapy, we are told this was an extra scene added after the first film preview, as people who saw the film wanted closure and Barry felt it was the perfect ending to the film, as he felt the character of Bobby finally realises that things at the beginning were wrong in his life and now wants to move on to a much better future, and we now have all the loose ends tied up and the film ends. As the credits roll up the screen, this is where Barry stops his audio commentary and I suppose he felt he had given enough information towards revealing all aspect about the film and also he involvement in the process of working on the film, despite this, it was still a great informative audio commentary and was also fascinating hearing both Ken Russell and Barry Sandler imparting their words of wisdom on working on the film CRIMES OF PASSION, and was well worth a listen and definitely get a five star rating from me.

Special Feature: Barry Sandler: Life of Crime [2016] [1080p] [1.78:1] [22:07] Here we have a Brand-new interview with Barry Sandler recorded especially for this Blu-ray release. Here Barry Sandler gives us some very personal views and we are informed he has been a Screenwriter for 19 years and talks about his personal involvement with director Ken Russells film CRIMES OF PASSION. Barry informs us that when he moved to Los Angeles and went to the University of California, Los Angeles, he was a massive fan of the actress Raquel Welch and did a sort of stalking business to find out where the actress lived via those maps that informs you where all the stars lived, but of course Barry says you could not do that today, as security is very high and would not allow any kind of personal contact with these Hollywood stars. But the reason for wanting to contact Raquel Welch is that when he was around 19 years of age wrote a screenplay especially for Raquel Welch to be the leading actress in the film, and the film was Kansas City Bombers, but when doing lectures for students today, he warns them not to do the stunt in trying to contact stars that he tried to do when he was younger, as they could get into very serious trouble and probably be arrested. Another film Barry was involved in the screenplay was Making Love [1982] at the age of 30 years of age and then went onto do other films like The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox [1976] and The Mirror Crackd [1980]. But in particular with the film Making Love, Barry was very keen to be involved with the screenplay, because it was all about coming out and especially at the time he was a closet gay and with the help of 20th Century Fox Executives at the time gave the film the green light and of course went to great success and on top of all that Barry got hundreds of correspondence from gays and lesbians thanking Barry for his involvement with the film and for me personal it was also one of my favourite film to come out in 1982. Barry also informs us that in the early 1980s he noticed around him lots of friends in lots of gay and straight relationships, and especially the sexual revolution and the Free Love movement, but of course eventually things didn't work out and eventually we got AIDS, which of course had a devastating consequences and eventually Barry experienced a great loss of friends. When Barry was at the University of California, Los Angeles, there were directors that he was desperately wanted to work with the likes of  Stanley Kubrick, Mike Nicolls, Roman Polanski and of course Ken Russell and because Barry had the same agency ICM Partners [Entertainment agency in Los Angeles, California] and because of the screenplay for the film CRIMES OF PASSION he had done and they asked Barry if he would allow his screenplay to be sent to the director Ken Russell and of course gave then the green light to do so instantly and of course Ken Russell responded back immediately with great enthusiasm, especially after a very bad experience on working on the film Altered States [1980] where he had very serious problems with the studio, and especially with Paddy Chayefsky who wrote the screenplay, but with the film CRIMES OF PASSION he felt everything would be alright and a great success. When Barry finally met Ken Russell, who at first was very guarded and suspicious after the debacle with the other film, but after a lengthy chat about the process towards making the film, Ken let Barry into his inner circle with a lot of trust and of course Barry was so thrilled to be working with the director, and Barry had a wonderful experience and really became a good friend and confident to Ken Russell, because the director had great respect for the screenplay. Barry then goes onto talk about the three main actors that appear in the film and why Ken Russell thought Kathleen Turner and John Laughlin were totally ideal for their part in the film, as Ken Russell thought the chemistry between the two actors was perfect. Barry then goes onto why Anthony Perkins was perfect for his part in the film in being an over the top manic preacher. But most importantly, everyone knew it was a totally over the top outrageous film and were all totally 100% enthusiastic towards the project. As we come to the end of this very special feature, it was really great hearing Barrys personal views and comments on working on the film CRIMES OF PASSION, and to me he sounds like a really nice guy and it would be a great honour to meet him in person, as I bet he would have lots of other fascinating anecdotes and insights into working in the film industry. This definitely gets a five star rating.

Special Feature: Rick Wakeman: Composing for Ken [2016] [1080p] [1.78:1] [28:54] Here we get a Brand-new interview with composer Rick Wakeman recorded especially for this release Blu-ray release. Here we find Rick Wakeman being interviewed in a private cinema, and talking about two books written by Ken Russell that he read about kens personal thoughts on Rick Wakeman, and one comment gives great praise on Rick 100%, but another comment was very scathing about Rick Wakeman and what terrible musician he was and then one day Rick met Ken at the BBC and asked Ken about his contradictory comments about him in his two books and Ken admitted both comments were correct and says it is all according how he felt on certain days when working on his books. But despite these two opposing comments on Rick, he still likes Ken very much and loves him being an out and out rebel in the film industry, especially telling people what he thought of them. Whenever ken and Rick had their 6:00am meeting to discuss about the music for the film, they would always sink a couple of bottles of wine, but what Rick found out from Ken is to always look and learn, and especially if you are not sure of anything, always ask questions, and over time Rick learnt so much knowledge from Ken Russell. Rick also learnt something really special, especially with words of wisdom from Ken Russell, where he said to Rick, by saying, I am different from other directors, and I believe that a film should stand up on its own, without any effects and without any music. It should stand alone, it won't be right, it won't be finished, but it should stand alone, and so therefore I do not do what most other directors do, which is put scratch music on a finished rush or on a first edit. I give it to you with nothing, because too many directors put scratch music on and they think it will be good to edit to and to work to, and it becomes so engrained in their heads, that they cannot get it out and when the composer gives them the proper music, that they are so used to the scratch music, oh it is not like we had before, because with that familiarity has breed acceptance and it is wrong and that is why I won't do it. Ken Russell also says that there is another line you will hear over your career when composing music for films and you will hear from the director discussing where the music is supposed to go and you will hear the famous lines, Ah, now this bit, really needs music, and that really means the director has messed very badly and is trying to get out of the horrible mess the director has done to his film, and of course Rick says, How right he was. But when it came to the composed music for the film CRIMES OF PASSION, Ken Russell wanted the music to be based on DVORAKs New World Symphony, and Ken wanted different themes for different scenes in the film, and for China Blue, Ken wanted a particular piece of music, but that same music was used for a very famous British TV Advert for the HOVIS loaf and Ken did not know this, as he had been living in America a long time, and when Ken went to the UK to play the music to the British public and every time the public would mention the HOVIS advert and of course ken was very indignant and upset. About two years before Ken Russell passed away, wanted a long chat with Rick about his life and his frustration with the film industry in general, as Ken tended to frighten people off, but ken felt he still had a lot to offer to the film industry, but Rick felt Ken was very maligned, whereas Rick really got on well with the director, and in the end people would not give Ken the financial backing to make more films, which again frustrated Ken a great deal, because ken would always come in budget when making a film. So ends another very nice interview with Rick Wakeman and especially his working with the director Ken Russell. This was also a very interesting interview.

Finally, for all their extravagance, Ken Russell's films have never lacked exuberance or humour, which makes the tone of CRIMES OF PASSION a massive and exciting surprise. Much of this is attributable to the brilliant screenplay by Barry Sandler that is filled with smutty double-entendres and weighty ironies. Only intermittently does the director Ken Russell break through with the kind of manic flamboyance that is so singularly and rudely his own validation. That reversal is part of what makes the character of Bobby tick though: he is more interested in love and happiness than just sex than most men, especially in the erotic thriller genre of CRIMES OF PASSION. CRIMES OF PASSION is fairly frank and explicit in its depiction of sex acts and sexual references and is a film which is rich in the religious metaphor that fills most of Ken Russells work and the sexual content is as comically over-the-top as the two lead performances, full of nonsensical smut such as Anthony Perkins Reverend Shayne brandishing a huge razor-sharp sexual object and of course the air of mischievous glee that Ken Russell seems to be sprinkling liberally throughout the madness of this awesome film. In the end, it is a brilliant fine film, with tones of strange atmospheric to keep you mystified, and it is Ken Russell's meditation on society's artificiality sexual obsessions. From casual, thrill-seeking perambulators of the red-light district to yowling 'performance artists' at group therapy to those who prefer plastic flowers to real ones, because they don't die, Ken Russell takes aim at your synthetic lifestyle and fires a nutty salvo of eye-candy, genius performances, social commentary, and random freaky nonsense that always hit homes, and is a film that is bold and will keep you on your toes throughout the film and you will never ever get bored and I think it is one of Ken Russells best film ever and I love it, especially now seeing the Directors Cut. Very Highly Recommended!

Perkins shyly accepted the compliment and we moved on.
Here, 30+ years later, I still love this film to my core. Daring, colorful and jaw-dropping, the hit-and-miss Ken Russell delivers a mystery that no A List actor today would touch with a 20 foot pole.
Discover this film... I'm not giving away more!",1476921600,8,549,4.555555555555555
