8124303,5,B000FKPEFG,"Magical Twilight is a cute story about a boy and the three witches that need him in some way to complete their examinations.  Please note: THIS IS FOR ADULTS ONLY.  There is a good plot involved in the story, but it is apparently a hentai (adult animated film.)  It was not over the top, as there is more plot than sex (the sex scenes are very short).  There is no penetration shown because of the angling used, and when the erection is in the shot, it is censored by basically being invisible with saliva outlining it.

The plot surrounds the protagonist who is trying for the third time to pass his college exams.  Two witches from the white witch world have to make a ""Favorable impression"" on him.  One is gentle and understanding.  The other is pushy and essentially forces sex on him by using magic (which backfires somewhat).

There is also a witch from the dark magic world whose exam is to kill the main character.  There is an awkward scene where his friend basically knocks the dark magic witch out and starts sex with her.  I suppose that because she enjoys it, the creator of this series thinks the viewer will not see it for what it is.  That being said SPOILER: she likes the guys ""magic wand"" enough to quit being a black magic witch.

Overall, this is a fun anime.  Certainly not for those under 18, not really for those who are looking for a lot of sex in a hentai.  More like a really fun anime to watch with a significant other who does not mind that there is some sex.

Finally, this DVD has a lot of good bonuses for those who like storyboards, character designs, trailers (for the actual anime on the disk), and image galleries.",1355702400,,1651,4.399339933993399
8124304,3,B000FKPEFG,"I really enjoyed the first episode of this hentai series. Here you have something that is cute and enjoyable while also not skimping on the sex. There's nothing really kinky here, but the sex is well-done and sexy enough. More importantly, the main couple here are more than just sex partners: they actually care about each-other, a relative rarity in the world of hentai anime. The plot concerns two witches attending some kind of magical university who need to ace a practical exam by living with a young man for awhile. One of the two witches, Irene, is a voluptuous and utterly amoral tart who sleeps with men in order to manipulate them to her own ends. Predictably, she thinks all she needs to do is provide the young man with sexual favors in order to ace her exam. The other witch, Chipple, a real cutie, believes in fairness and treating others right. Understandably, she is the one who is able to form a real bond with the young man, and the real story of the three episodes mainly concerns the attempts of Irene to break the two up so that she can manipulate him, which he is having none of. In a refreshing twist for a hentai title, the young man initially wants nothing to do with either girl, and they have to work to gain his trust (Chipple does, anyhow; Irene never gains his trust). This resembles a harem anime more than it does a hentai, sex scenes put aside.

The last two episodes mainly take place at a hot spring resort, where it largely loses focus. The young man, until then being faithful to Chipple, cheats on her, and wounds her deeply. Had the final episode of this resolved their relationship adequately, I would have given this four stars, but it really just kind of forgets about the character drama and focuses on the sex in the last episode. The two come back together at the end, but there is never a satisfying explanation for how Chipple comes to trust him again and act like nothing bad ever happened. For this narrative slip I can't in good faith give this hentai more than three stars.

The animation is typical 90s hentai quality. As said, the sex is all fairly traditional, but I enjoyed it. There is something to be said for the satisfying physicality of person-to-person sex without weird devices or supplements involved.

All-in-all, it could have been better, but I still enjoyed it.",1296777600,8,2329,4.580335731414868
