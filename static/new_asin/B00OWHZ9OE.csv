8685201,5,B00OWHZ9OE,"When brothers Mutta and Hibito were children, they both dreamed of becoming astronauts. Fast forward to adulthood and we see younger brother Hibito getting ready to become the first Japanese person on the moon, while older brother Mutta finds himself fired from his dead end job after head-butting his boss. Lucky for him, his interfering parents help him get a second chance at achieving his dream when they submit his resume to JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) and he is accepted into the first round of the astronaut selection interviews.

I heard nothing but good things about this series while it was airing, but I waited until it was completed before jumping in. I was looking forward to it, but a little worried about it being over hyped. My fears were quickly erased.

Space Brothers is an excellent series for adults (and anyone else of course) and for anyone who enjoys learning about space. It is really interesting to hear about many, many different requirements needed to become an astronaut and all the cool space stuff (that is, cool moon scenes :).
I didn't know anything about the astronaut application process, but apparently (going off of a review of the series) it is surprisingly accurate (for JAXA anyway). The series is definitely well researched and feels very realistic.

But no show is complete without good characters, and Space Brothers has those in spades. Mutta enjoys great character development and growth as the series progresses. He also becomes surrounded by a group of smart and interesting people who get their own backstories and motivations painted out for us. Habito, while getting less screen time than his main character brother, is also a very enjoyable character. He is the kind of guy who sticks with his dreams despite the likelihood of failure and manages to achieve said dreams through hard work and self confidence. He is a very happy go lucky sort of character, which can be a nice break from Mutta's near constant fretting.

The series has a rather slow pace (the application section alone goes on for ages), but it is really exciting. I watched with my sister and a friend and every time we had to stop there was a groan of disappointment. Many times there was the plea for ""one more episode"".

The series is 99 episodes and this set contains 1-12. Crunchyroll has the entire series available at this time, so once you get to episode 13 and realize you need to see it RIGHT NOW, then at least you don't have to wait for the next DVD set :)",1424649600,11,2500,4.764434180138569
