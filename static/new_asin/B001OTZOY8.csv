It lasts a total of about 45 minutes long. At the end he says ""these strategies are described in detail in the segments that follow"".  Problem is, nothing follows,..it is the end of the DVD.  Weird??  This is a bad investment.",1335916800,,383,4.323943661971831

I wouldn't say so because you can find the info elsewhere for free but as far as the quality, it was pretty good. My advice - find this and more detailed info on youtube and investopedia for Free!",1305417600,2,357,4.264705882352941
