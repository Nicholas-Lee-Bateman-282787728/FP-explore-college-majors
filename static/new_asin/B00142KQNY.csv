8469068,1,B00142KQNY,"When I got this video I was very excited.  Finally someone did a video for all of us who are interested in learning how to make our own Lace Front Wigs.  What I received was FAAAAAARRRR from that.  Basically the DVD is just an advertisement for the business.  The video had NOTHING at all to do with making a lace front wig.  It was basically an very overpriced application course-- how to glue on your lace front once you purchased it from their company.

What I really don't like is the deceptive product description:

""Lace Front Weaving with Barbara Lagazzele DVD Learn the most ingenious art of LACE FRONT Weaving ever created"". That statement leads you to believe you will be learning how to make an actual wig.  Also the statement:

""From this creative, never seen before technique for full and partial Lace Fronts, to the non-traditional tools that are used, the art of Lace Front Weaving is explored and instructed like no other""  leads you to think it's going to cover the actual art of lace front weaving, like cap construction, ventilating, and application, but it's all hype.  Nothing was explored either, unless you call seeing someone getting their hair cornrowed an exploration.  Anyone interested in Lacefronts knows that your hair is braided under the wig- not rocket science.

After they have deceived you they backhandedly try to give you a lil tidbit truth with the statement ""With the unique (finishing techniques) created by Barbara Lagazzele"" but it's still deceptive because it's followed by ""you will learn to create a weave on your client that is as close to perfection as you will ever see.""  Huh-- How can I create the weave if I don't know the technique?

This video is VERY overpriced at $149.99 plus shipping.  There is a seller on ebay with a comprable video for 12.50 plus 8.00 dollars shipping for a total of $20.50.  There are also numerous video's on youtube and yahoo videos that offer the ""art of Lace Front Weaving"" (or gluing your wig on as I call it) for free.  Believe me this video had no info that you couldn't get on youtube instantly for free.

Most of us don't have 150.00 to throw away so I wrote this review so others can be clear on what they are buying.

DO buy this video 1. if you want to learn how to glue your lace front wig on. Or 2. if you want to learn how to sew your lace front to tracks.

DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN:
1. cap construction  2. ventilating or 3. actually making a wig.
Save your money!",1204156800,17,2469,4.525959367945824
