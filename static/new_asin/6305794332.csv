8194751,4,6305794332,"Once again, star Carter Wong and director Joseph Kuo team up to bring us this second of three installments of the 18 Bronzemen.  This movie is very consciously fashioned after the first film, though the plotline and characters are different from the first.  As a sequel, the production goes for the bigger and better product, and, indeed, the result rivals the original film.  The film wastes little time in development, efficiently setting up the plot and characters --- so much so that Carter Wong is entering the chamber of Bronzemen probably within the first 20 minutes.  His trials and battles are excellent and spectacular, as good if not better than the first film.  He must enter the chamber on several occasions, and the multiple trials occupy the bulk of the film --- to the delight of the viewer.  Carter Wong plays a villian here which creates some moral dilemmas late in the film.  The film ends somewhat abruptly and clumsily such that the final payoff is unclear.  But this can be easily overlooked by this fine follow-up that does not disappoint.  If you liked the original, you will definitely love this sequel.",988675200,,1128,4.833333333333333
