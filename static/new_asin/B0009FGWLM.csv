I have, however, seen these movies on T.V. before I bought them and obviously they left that much of an impression on me to make me want to purchase them. The Kid is so cute...it has it's sad moments, funny moments and happy moments. I still cannot believe that ""the kid"" is Uncle Fester from the Addams Family T.V. series. Very cool. Also, Tillies Punctured Romance is great! I enjoyed seeing Charlie play a different role other than the one he's known for (""The Tramp""). He does very well playing a sneaky, two timing rat. LOL. Anyway, don't hesistate to buy this! It's worth it! :-)",1420934400,,661,4.516666666666667
8060096,4,B0009FGWLM,You laugh out loud during this movie.  Marie Dressler as always the bubbling comedian. Charlie Chaplin the quiet clown. Great entertainment.,1381190400,,140,5.666666666666667
8060097,5,B0009FGWLM,"I saw the end of this movie really early one morning. I've always been interested in black and white movies from the silent era. I never saw anything with Charlie Chaplin though. This was one of his earlier films. He was absolutely hysterical in this film! The quality of film and dvd, are both pretty impressive. The shipping wasn't long at all.",1294099200,,346,4.596774193548387
8060098,4,B0009FGWLM,"This Charlie Chaplin double-feature DVD includes spoken instructions on how to access films or menus. Audio levels are quite high yet distortion-free.

THE KID has a full-range recording of the symphonic score, written by Chaplin himself. Video quality of this transfer is quite good, free of edit breaks or scratches. It runs at normal speed, which may confuse those who expect silent movies to be overly fast-paced.

TILLIE'S PUNCTURED ROMANCE doesn't fare as well. There's shakiness to the frame and dubbing is from a well-used 16mm print. Soundtrack provided by a pop and tick-infested LP of generic ragtime piano. Despite these limitations, ""Tillie's"" does run it's full 70-plus minutes, which is rare for these budget label releases.

Historical note: Intertitles for ""Tillie's"" are newer than the film itself. There's mention of Prohibition, near-beer and Bevo, a non-alcoholic brew that wasn't available until the partial banning of alcohol sales in 1916, some two year's after this comedy's release (full Prohibition didn't take effect until January of 1919). They're poor explanation for why Miss Dressler acts so intoxicated.

This one's worthwhile for THE KID alone. Consider the second movie a placeholder, or an opportunity to preview something you may wish to purchase later, on a restored edition.
