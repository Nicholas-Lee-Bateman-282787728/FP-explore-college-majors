812229,3,6304233655,"Despite one or two sterling performances, anyone wanting Nicholas Nickleby in a permanent form should buy either the 1980s RSC perfromance or the 2001 DVD. The RSC version may be overlong and contain some unnecessary scenes and characters but in David Threlfall's portrayal of Smike it has an all-time great performance. The parts of Nicholas and Kate in this early film are more suited in age than the 1980s version, but Nicholas is not up to James Darcy's toucing portrayal in the 2001 version. Nor does Stanley Holloway's worthy attempt at Crummles compare with the masterly one by Freddie Jones in the 1977 version.

Indeed to have a completely perfect cast in this panoramic story, one needs the luxury of the five available versions.",1175644800,2,739,4.959677419354839
812230,5,6304233655,"Charles Dickens was the social surgeon . His eye focuses on the misfortunes  of a penniless boy who will fight hard , so hard against a money mad scheming uncle. This familiar portrait , obviously is a reflect of the English social body in those years where the opulence was in the edges .

The proud is the reason to live to many people !

Excellent film and one of the most remarkable movies of the last forties though it lacks the punch of the Great Expectations, to be fair .

This is by far , the best version you can get of this superb social portrait.",1103155200,6,558,4.186915887850467
812231,4,6304233655,"This is a good movie for adults,teens,and mature kids. Some of the things they do are adult such as, call people bad names(real bad)or harrass people or, in one particular scene, a boy gets beaten most ferociously with a reed  cane. It is a sad but good movie and it tell of real things that happened  then. I enjoyed it but they talk in old english and really fast so be  prepared..",961459200,5,383,4.291666666666667

7865362,2,6304233655,There is very poor video quality on this DVD.  It seems to be a quick transfer from film with no attempt to clean it up.  Even the quality of the black and white varies at different parts of the movie.  Different reels?,1382659200,2,219,4.166666666666667
