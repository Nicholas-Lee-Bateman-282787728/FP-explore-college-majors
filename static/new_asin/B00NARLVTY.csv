6622955,5,B00NARLVTY,Hilarious!! I absolutely love this show,1489363200,,39,5.666666666666667
6622956,5,B00NARLVTY,"Been hooked on this series since it premiered, but Seasons 1 and 2 are still the best.  What a wacky, warped way to enjoy American History.  You'll also actually learn something.  The shtick: really drunk comedians and actors narrate the event, and then the Drunk History actors re-enact the story and lip-synch with the drunken idiot telling the story.  It's hysterical.
My teenage son and I really enjoy watching these episodes together, we laugh our heads off, and we've both been inspired to read books about the events they're covering.  Kudos to them for selecting some of the more obscure historical events that haven't gotten their due in our classrooms or history books, and introducing us to new heroes.  Especially love the stories about the Lincoln assassination, Al Capone, the FBI vs. Martin Luther King, and the invention of Coca-Cola.",1486857600,,850,5.035714285714286

6622979,5,B00NARLVTY,"OMG! I love history<3 This show is so funny, with drunk people telling true stories from history. The historical events they speak about are generally less known history. So, you get to learn some fun history while you laugh! :)  (It's not for kids, because of the bad language.)",1465603200,2,279,4.6938775510204085

6622982,5,B00NARLVTY,"Do you want to laugh your butt off and learn something at the same time?
If so, then this show is for you. Drunk History combines the ramblings of a fully intoxicated narrator with a literal word for word reenactment.  It's chock full of recognizable guest stars and it will leave you fully entertained and educated.

Invite your friends, crack open a cold one, a bag of popcorn and kick back for a night of lesser known historical facts as told by the chemically impaired. You will not be disappointed.",1462492800,,503,4.5777777777777775

6622995,4,B00NARLVTY,"Saw a snippet of this series on TV in the break room and had to have the DVDs! I think I learned more history through Drunk History than I have ever done in all my years of college! What makes it funny is the voice-over's in the story teller's voice, the cussing and the scenes of the story tellers barfing in the background or passing out. If my son was older, I'd let him watch it. I wish there was a PG-rated version but if that were the case, it would probably not be as funny. I also wished they had more American history vs historical events, such as the creation of Kellogg's cereal.",1461196800,,590,4.184210526315789
6622996,5,B00NARLVTY,"When I first heard of Drunk History, I disapproved of a series that glorified drunkenness. Then I watched it and I was addicted.

6623067,5,B00NARLVTY,"This show ran on Comedy Central for a total of 3 seasons, and a two-season set has come out on DVD, which I just completed.  Id never even heard of it before seeing the two-season set.

The show is exactly what it is named: history [specifically, AMERICAN history] recounted by actors or writers who seem very interested in the subject they're narrating, but are totally drunk as they narrate the story.  Visually it cuts back and forth between other actors re-enacting the events described (including precisely lip-synching conversations as recounted by the narrator), and watching the narrator accompanied by Derek Waters, the sort of master of ceremonies for the show who goes to each narrators location, pours them drinks (and imbibes with them), brings them back on-topic if they start to wander, etc.  For lovers of crude comedy theres plenty to laugh at: the slurred speech, vomiting, staggering, falling onto the floor, and much worse.  But waitwhile they watch it they are also LEARNING HISTORY.  Whats more, even if you AREN'T interested in crude comedy, it is STILL interesting.  Youll hear pieces on sort of well-known bits of history you thought you knew, but didn't know all the details (like where our national Anthem came from), to really obscure but interesting parts of American history.  Considering the target audience for Comedy Central (which is probably between roughly age 18 to 30), theres still much of interest for anyone over age 30, though I would not recommend it for those under age 18, as the drunk part might just sound too appealing.  I think most readers might find somethingno, many things interesting in the series if they gave it a view.  Plus there is an impressive cast of actors and actresses who do the re-enactments.  And yes, watching John Lithgow or Jack Black lip-synching the lines from a drunken young female narrator is amusing but somehow, fascinating as well.",1428796800,4,1910,4.9748427672955975

**Update: We've watched the entire DVD set twice over now and it still proves hilarious. We don't even drink when we watch it. It's one of those shows that maintains its entertainment factor and/or increases said factor after multiple views. Another feature I really enjoy is the geographical construct the show applies. These aren't just drunk actors in a room reading history books -- They're on location! Interacting with the community! A relevant community at that! Aw.

6623127,5,B00NARLVTY,"Drunk History is flat-out hilarious, and what was already one of the funniest shows on TV is now even more so because this dvd set (containing the first 2 seasons) is uncensored, so theres a ton of profanity.  The concept is that interesting historical incidents are told by people who are completely drunk, so they embellish the stories with their own takes on what the historical figures may have said.  Meanwhile, some pretty famous actors & comedians act out the stories and lip synch the dialogue perfectly (said dialogue may include extraneous comments, and storytellers feeling the effects of the booze).  This is one of the more clever shows on tv right now, and while they probably don't always get everything right facts-wise 100% of the time (like, I don't think John Adams and Thomas Jefferson actually told each other to f-off in quite those exact words), youll get the gist of the stories and can fill in the blanks using Wikipedia.  But its enormously entertaining, frequently educational, and there are some pretty generous extra scenes & interviewee footage included in the set (mostly on the 3rd disc).",1418601600,3,1120,4.941489361702128

6623129,5,B00NARLVTY,"What a show. Learning History was NEVER so entertaining!!  And you don't have to be Drunk to enjoy it, but a little Buzz Will ad a little extra kick to the lessons. The different Hosts are familiar Stars in the industry and you get to see them in a different light and enjoy their sense of humor in each episode, while being taught an off the wall lesson in history. If you don't find this show to be Hilarious, then you'd better check your pulse!",1417651200,,447,4.258823529411765

6623132,5,B00NARLVTY,"I don't consider myself immature, but the difference between this DVD set and the show being seen on Comedy Central is simply the language being heard exactly as mumbled and slurred by the drunk narrators versus the the edited and bleeped words being heard on the network.  I have seen every episode on T.V., but watching the same episodes without a filter of the censor made every minute like I was seeing these shows for the first time.... and yes, the un-bleeped F-bombs cracked me up.

As stated, this show has a great concept and is very original.  Do get this box set, whether you have never seen the show, or even if you have.  The unedited episodes are better than what you saw on Comedy Central.",1417046400,22,704,4.519685039370079
6623133,5,B00NARLVTY,"I watched the first season on instant video. I haven't laughed so hard in a lot of years. I'm definitely buying both seasons. Its such an original concept and so well executed.  I love history too but this show is for anyone who wants see and hear both really stupid and hilarious story telling of historical events. Guest actors include comedians, actors and musicians like Chris Parnell, Kristin Wiig, John Hader, Will Forte, Kevin Nealon, Rob Riggle, Jason Ritter, Jack Black, David Grohl, Fred Willard, Winona Rider, Luke and Owen Wilson, Lisa Bonet, etc.  Some of the history covered are Watergate, The Alamo, Lewis and Clark, Elvis meets Nixon, Hoover vs. MLK Jr., Patty Hearst, Kellogg Brothers, Ralph Nader vs GM, Lincoln the Lawyer, Lincoln Assassination, Al Capone, Billy the Kid, Houdini, Dolly Pardon, KKK and more. Between the slurred words, falling off chairs, throwing up and crazy dialogue in the story telling it is just the funniest thing ever.",1413504000,5,962,5.00625
6623134,5,B00NARLVTY,"This show is an Original Concept that is Brillianty Executed. The Concept is easy... Get someone who knows a story about history, get them SMASHED on alcohol, then have them tell the story while being fed more alcohol. That alone would be funny, but as the person is slurringly telling their tale, a 5-STAR group of actors is acting out the story while Lip Syncing to the audio of the story teller. This results in some of the funniest TV in recent times. The cast is made up of everybody who's anybody and they all do a perfect job of Lip Syncing while acting out the history lesson in full costume. The sets and surroundings that all this goes down in look legit and all of this gels together to make you believe this big scruffy cowboy has the voice of a cute girl who is drunk and cussing a lot.
