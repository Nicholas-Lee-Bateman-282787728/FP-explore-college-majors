6473452,2,B00L6AW1V4,This was a boring movie to me it has nothing to do with Halloween and everyone dies the story line is so dumb its about a girl with her friends trying to find her mother grave and the mother killed herself but then that not what really happen the girl had a sister and the mother killed the sister and everyone dies and so so I don't like the acting with some of the actors in this movie not good,1414281600,,396,3.9625

6473465,3,B00L6AW1V4,"It was an entertaining horror movie. I won't say it was really a supernatural movie, since there was so much slice and dice it pretty much ruined any atmosphere that could have been generated. I will say it was typical teen horror flick without the alcohol and soft porn. I also found the lead actress irritating and I didn't much care for the plot revolving around negative energies who resembled characters out of a zombie movie. I guess I have to much respect for the Japanese culture to really get into the story that was portrayed in this film. Beautiful scenery though. Just don't forget this is an American horror film and as a person who really likes Asian supernatural movies there is a world of difference between the two. Trying to mix the two just doesn't work. But, like I said; it is entertaining.",1473897600,2,811,4.6

6473467,2,B00L6AW1V4,"Seriously? Did these guys actually think the movie works?
I can just imagine the creative bull session the filmmakers had.
Doh, um, now let's think, how can we separate half a dozen people from each other?
Like we'll have them run off in different directions for no reason. Run away from something we won't actually show on camera, and run to stuff they can barely see.
Then we'll have the Japanese actors say stuff in Japanese. No one understands it so it won't matter.",1465084800,,470,4.607142857142857

6473469,5,B00L6AW1V4,"I LOVED this movie. No, it wasn't super scary, but the strength of this movie lies in the plot. It had several little unpredictable twists and solid acting. I found myself retelling the storyline to several of my friends several days after watching this movie; I was THAT impressed. If you want blood/gore/jump-scares, this is not for you. If you generally want to be creeped out and want a lesser-known movie to use a conversation-starter sometime in the near future, begin here.",1464220800,,480,4.865853658536586

6473479,3,B00L6AW1V4,"Not the best movie - sort of disappointing with such a creepy idea that had loads of potential.  Derivative of so many other scary movies and it never rises to a level of scariness, suspense, or even personality. I didn't care about the characters and I looked forward to the end - not because I wanted to know what was going to happen (you get the gist if not the outcome pretty easily in the first few minutes of the film) but because I was ready for it to wrap up and conclude.  I had rented it so didn't want to turn off b/c I am a annoyingly cheap and felt I should watch till the end.",1438646400,,590,4.034188034188034

6473499,3,B00L6AW1V4,"While the acting and storyline was interesting, especially when a jaded Horror film fan doesn't catch the few plot twists that appear in the story, the actual genre was less horror and more in the realm of slasher thriller.

6473503,3,B00L6AW1V4,"So what happens after a decade of J-Horror influence in the Hollywood market? You get films like Grave Halloween.

In fact, Grave Halloween was a Syfy original movie that attempts to fuse J-Horror with American actors in a ""Japanese"" forest. The result is a mixed bag.

In the film, Maiko travels with a documentary team into a forest, near Mt. Fuji, known as Suicide Forest. It was given that name by the public because many people go there to commit suicide. This all comes about because Maiko received a mysterious box from her birth mother before she committed suicide. Maiko wishes to get closure with her mother, but she also wants to perform a ritual where she releases her mother's spirit from the forest, before she becomes a Yuri, or angry ghost. The group enters Suicide Forest where they encounter the Yuri. And what starts off as a harmless film project, becomes a recipe for trouble and death. The film takes several twists and turns until it reaches a conclusion, I won't spoil it for you.

Well I have to say, this movie had an interesting premise to it. But what I found  annoying was the fact that it used American International students as the main characters instead of just using Japanese actors. I would have preferred it if only a couple of the  characters were American. That would have made more  sense. But as it turns out, all the students were American, except Maiko who was supposed to Amerasian or Hapa.

What the film gets right, is it creates an interesting story. Going around a forest where you occasionally come across dead people, because of recent suicides, was a good idea. And having the forest infested with Yuri  helps give the viewer a sense of anticipation before the horror comes. Also Maiko, having the bigger issue of wanting to have closure with her mother works well.

But this is all done with international students. Half of whom are throw away characters. While the story with Maiko and her group was OK,  the other three characters were basically annoying fodder for the forest.

There were a few redeeming points however, like when the group meets the mysterious man, Jin, in the forest, who supposedly knows his way around. They also come across two Japanese police officers who spend their day looking for dead people that they carry off to a storage area. We also get some creepy Yuri action, although it's not done as well as the Japanese can do it. It has a Hollywood flare to it unfortunately.

In addition, the reference to Halloween seems to be coincidental at best and really has nothing to do with the story. It was mainly used to get people interested in the film around Halloween time. There is a point made about how Maiko has to find her mother by October 31st and perform the ceremony in order to save her. But I was mainly interested in the film  due to the J-Horror references.

Overall, I'm giving the film a three. It did have a few jump scares in it. It also incorporated an interesting idea, a forest that attracts suicides. But I'd say the story would've been better off making most of the cast Japanese.  In fact, if this was remade in Japan with a Japanese cast, it might be a better film altogether. As is, it's mostly a horror movie that borrows  from J-Horror while leaving out the vital Japanese source elements.  Seeing a Japanese cast going through the forest would have been a lot more interesting than watching a bunch of dumb exchange students fumbling around, who don't even realize they're ticking off the Yuri. As a result, the film wasn't as sophisticated as it could have been.

Worth a possible watch only if you're interested in it. But don't expect to be blown out of the water by it. It's not a J-Horror film, however it has some J-Horror elements in it.",1414972800,7,3749,4.620481927710843
8664107,5,B00L6AW1V4,"This is an expertly crafted horror movie. If you have an appreciation for a good old-fashioned scary movie, this is it.

8664112,1,B00L6AW1V4,"A young Amerasian woman who never met her biological Japanese mother comes to the infamous Japanese suicide forest where her mom killed herself to try and find her body and perform a ceremony that is supposed to give her mother's soul peace and allow it to move on to the next life.  Despite the fact that this would seem to be a very private thing she allows her BFF to film the whole thing for a documentary she is shooting as a class project.

As insensitive as the idea of filming the search seems, the two male members of the crew are such sarcastic, disrespectful, unbelievable jerks you not only end up really hating them but you wonder how the girl making the documentary or the girl looking for her mother's body could possibly put up with them.  Given what the documentary is supposed to be about their behavior goes way beyond being insensitive and feels wildly offensive.  This movie makes American exchange students look like the biggest jackasses on the face of the earth.  The two female students are bearable at least but the guys are thoroughly repugnant.

As if two unbelievably obnoxious American dudes wasn't bad enough a third turns up to pull a prank--because, hey, that's what you do when a classmate is looking for the dead body of her mother who committed suicide, right?  So now the movie has three guys that you hate.  The only upside really is that it gives the movie more characters to kill.

One of the annoying dudes steals a Rolex off a dead body.  Who knew that being disgustingly insensitive could also jeopardize your life?  Apparently, there is some justice in the world--or at least in the world of this movie.  Stealing stuff off corpses and mocking the dead makes the spirits of the dead angry and vengeful.

Unfortunately, nothing about this movie is even remotely scary. The characters are obnoxious and the movie is completely idiotic.

There have been at least two other movies about the Japanese suicide forest that I know of--there's a Gus Van Sant movie called Sea of Trees starring Matthew McConaughey which got booed at its premiere in Cannes and the American horror movie The Forest starring Natalie Dormer which was decent but not entirely successful.  The latter movie at least made the suicide forest look atmospheric and creepy but in Grave Halloween, it just looks like any other sunny forest.  Beyond the lack of atmosphere, the annoying characters and the fact that it isn't scary Grave Halloween can't even come up with a mildly plausible reason for how the characters manage to get separated.  This one is so bad it actually manages to make the pretty spotty The Forest look like a masterpiece by comparison.  Do yourself a favor and don't waste a moment of your life watching this.",1496016000,,2740,4.732631578947369
8664113,3,B00L6AW1V4,"It's watchable, but there's just something overall about Grave Halloween that just doesn't work or make a great horror film.  I'll point out this is not a found footage movie, as one of the other reviews indicates.  There is a character with a video camera, but we watch events like a normal movie.  Occasionally we'll see through his viewfinder (or screen) where another character swears there was someone there, and of course nothing is seen on screen as was the case through everyone else's eyes. But the majority of the film is normal movie style.  The film is supposedly set in Japan, but you get the feeling we're not actually there.  The dumb teen characters who go to the Suicide Forrest, are from an international school, all are American. Shouldn't there be at least a couple of other country's represented here?  Maiko one of the Americans is adopted, and of mixed caucasian/asian heritage, who is the driving point for them being in the forest since she wants to perform a ritual for her biological mother's soul who killed herself in the forest at the foot of Mt Fuji when she was six or something like that.  The rest are caucasians, except an Indian (the country) heritage American who carries around a long handle boom mike the whole time. You've got your token blonde girl, and your standard new addition to the group, a guy who will be the cameraman since the guy supposed to come got sick and has issues with some aspects of the group's normal behaviour. Then throw in three bully class clown types who are also in the forest to scare the main group that are filming Maiko's ritual as a class assignment.

You can see a lot of the surprises in the story coming a long way off. For a forest with so many paths and areas where you go off the paths where Japanese people obviously go to kill themselves, it's a bit of a coincidence that the class clowns know what tree the filming group will walk past to plan their prank. You can buy the fact the forest has these angry spirits trapped in the forest who torment the living who aren't respecting them or stealing from them, since that's what the main group is going there to release the mother from being trapped there for eternity, but people walking together and everyone else but one just disappears isn't really plausible or seem in the capabilities of trapped spirits.",1495497600,,2339,4.605769230769231
8664114,1,B00L6AW1V4,"This wretched piece of refuse is an insult and a travesty. Even if it were good horror it would be awful - but it is not. It's a lame, overtired story filled with largely unlikeable characters all balanced in an incredibly flimsy premise, filled with cheap ""scares"" that monopolises the pain of real people.

Anyone with ANY kind of knowledge of the culture of death and dying in Japan, as well as the actuality of Aokigahara should find this entire movie repugnant in the extreme. Hollywood needs to STOP making movies about something they clearly don't care enough about to bother to understand. Stop using Japanese bodies to tell stories that do nothing but exploit and use things that should never be touched by Hollywood in the first place.

Also, whomever used google translate to come up with most of the Japanese dialogue in this movie needs to be fired and banned from any future projects.",1491004800,,898,4.75
