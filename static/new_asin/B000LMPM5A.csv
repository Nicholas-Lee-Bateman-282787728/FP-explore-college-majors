8162379,4,B000LMPM5A,"The other ratings for this set are questionable at best as they describe a DVD of this title and are several years old.

I have purchased several of the Finley-Holiday Blu-rays of National Parks and have determined that they are recent productions with first rate videos of the subject matter.

While I don't yet own this particular item, my guess is that it merits a four or five star rating based on my experience with other recent productions.

Information from Finley-Holiday indicates that this is a 2014 production.

Thus, Amazon should probably remove the previous three star ratings for this item as they do not address the current production.

I intend to order this product inasmuch as a first rate Blu-ray production of Arches should be excellent.",1402531200,,758,4.937007874015748
8162380,3,B000LMPM5A,"I'm planning a trip to southern Utah and was anxiously awaiting this video so that I could see what was in store for me. I was disappointed in this video, however. Besides the poor quality of the DVD itself, there were many blank (dark) spaces of varying lengths between chapters. The video did not flow well. There was adequate coverage of the geology of the area but inadequate coveraqe of the flora and fauna. There was bare minimal coverage of the actual sites to see. Much of this was done from an aerial view, which most of us will not be doing. It's almost like the scenery was covered just in passing. I'd save your money and buy some of the excellent books and guides available if I were you.",1209340800,2,701,4.4
8162381,3,B000LMPM5A,This dvd was more simple than we had hoped and felt like a college project as opposed to professionally done informative work.  It is pleasent but not what I had hoped for in a more comprehensive look at the park.,1209340800,2,213,4.325
