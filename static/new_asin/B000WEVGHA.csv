2967789,4,B000WEVGHA,"As you can tell by the cover, this workout is led by the three Biggest Loser trainers, Bob, Jillian and Kim.  They are all outgoing and motivating and in this 50 minute workout, you will definately burn calories.
You can play any segment in any order which I like to avoid boredom, or you can choose some of the challenging premixes.  Bob leads a bootcamp segment where you can do the moves with or without weights to make it tougher if you want.  Jillian doesn't mess around with her high intensity drills.  They are tough, but stick to it for a while and it will get easier.  Then at the end, Kim does kickboxing (which really gets your heart rate up).  Some of seasons 3 and 4 are here too and they look great.
I like this workout because it's tough and yet fun and I've only done it once so far, but I'm still feeling it and can't wait to try it again because I know it will get easier and it's a definate calorie and fat burner.",1198454400,123,933,4.184357541899441
2967790,3,B000WEVGHA,"Coming from an athlete who works out 6 days a week I have to say that the first routine with Bob Harper was a good burn but quite a few of the moves involve twisting of the knees and lower back.

2967798,3,B000WEVGHA,"The workouts are ok and definitely effective. I just wasn't totally wild about the routines and I got bored with them pretty quickly. It's just a personal preference issue, which is why I didn't want to give it any lower than 3 stars. I will say I did love that Bob had people with ""real"" bodies working out with him. Considering I have 30 lbs. to lose, it served as an effective motivator to get through the workout when I saw people my size or larger going through the routine, too. Jillian, as per usual, had super-fit trainers appearing with her. I don't find that to be as inspirational.",1470873600,,592,4.440366972477064

So far I've only done levels 1 and 2 (well and the warm up and cool down of course) and they are both great workouts. Even though I love Jillian and most of the workout DVDs I do are hers, on this DVD I prefer the Level 1 workout with Bob. I do pretty advanced workouts and am in pretty decent shape after losing 93lbs and after I did this workout the first time I was so sore the next day. I was sore in places I didn't even knew I could be sore in from a workout! I definitely think this DVD will help me lose the last 10-12 pounds I want to lose.",1470787200,,651,3.7941176470588234

2967804,3,B000WEVGHA,"I just completed the entire six week of Cardio Max. I did Cardio Max 5 days a week. My thoughts on the video are as follows:

The video: I actually enjoyed this video. I did not find it to be difficult. The first time I did the video, I did not need to pause at all and I am about 60 pounds overweight. However, every single time I did the video, I was drenched in sweat shortly after starting. It is nice that one can make this video as easy or as hard as they want. Bob reminds viewers that if it's too hard, it's okay as long as you don't stop moving. I personally did not do any modified versions of the exercises, but for those who have difficulty the option is nice. But, I found it frustrating that there was little attention given to form. This is very different from Jillian videos, which explain well how to do each exercise.

Effectiveness: I am completing one video at a time and then reviewing it. I began with the 30 Day Shred, which I absolutely love. With the 30 Day Shred I lost many inches and a few pounds in just 20 minutes a day. Over the six weeks I did Cardio Max, I only lost 2 pounds,1/2 inches off my calves, 1/2 inch off my arms, and 1 inch off my waist. I do not consider the results to be good considering that I gave up soda, drank tons of water, and watched what I ate. In the past week I have went back to the 30 Day Shred, which takes half as long to do as level 3 of Cardio Max. I have lost a couple of pounds and an inch off my waist already. Also, I have much more energy and my knees stopped hurting. When I do an exercise video, I judge it mostly on results and Cardio Max does not deliver results for me. I put this video away after completing the entire 6 weeks. I doubt I will ever get it out again.

On the video, they recommend doing this video along with the power sculpt dvd, but I chose to do this video alone in order to accurately measure results. Moreover, it takes 40 minutes to complete the entire video, who has time to do another one on top of it?",1465776000,2,2000,4.0201005025125625

2967841,3,B000WEVGHA,"I was super excited about getting this DVD. I had heard a bunch of great things about this series and really needed something to get me motivated and moving. After receiving it though, I was expecting some serious cardio work out sessions, but was a bit disappointed when I finally watched the video. I had done the Jillian Michael's 30 day shred in the past and thought it may be similar, with the different levels of intensitiy, but this didn't have that like I thought. The dvd has one main workout that is 20-30 min long and it does get you moving, but I need more than just 20-30 min. They also have (2 separate) 10 min sessions that you can do by themselves or had it to the main cardio workout. Perhaps I was just expecting too much, or I should just do all of them in row to get the workout I need (which I have done) but I was thinking you'd be able to start on level one beginner for a awesome workout and then be able to build up, but that is not so on this dvd. Still a good workout and change of pace for me, just not exactly what I thought it was going to be. I liked that they had a very good warm up session about 10 min and that you could mute the trainers voice if you wanted, they get annoying sometimes. Received the video quickly, that part I had no problems with at all!",1430784000,,1292,4.090551181102362

2967849,5,B000WEVGHA,"I bought Cardio Max because I liked the At Home Challenge so much. Cardio Max keeps you moving and your heart rate up to get you sweating within 10 minutes! Even the warm up section gets you sweating. I like the variation of moves in this DVD and how there is a bit of kickboxing. Another good workout that involves working lower and upper body simultaneously. Light hand weights are used in this DVD, but not necessary. This DVD has 3 levels: Level 1 is 20 minutes, Level 2 is 10 minutes, and Level 3 is 10 minutes. You can customize/choose which sections you want to do.

2967852,3,B000WEVGHA,"This is the 1st workout DVD I ever purchased. I have had it for many years, & continue to use it once every other week. There are aspects of this workout that are great, & other parts that are not so great.

The DVD has a 5 minute warmup with Bob, then a 20 min cardio segment with light weights incorporated with Bob, next a 10 min workout with Jillian, then a 10 min segment with Kim, & lastly a 5 min cool down with Bob.

I gave this DVD 3 stars because Bob does not count down the reps or cue the next moves well. Also, if you count yourself you'll notice the Reps are not even. Bob gets a bit annoying at times, but it is not unbearable. I also find Kim slightly annoying. Jillian's workout is great & really effective. I'd like to add that her segment in this DVD is what turned me on to her solo movies, which are AMAZING!

If you do all 50 minutes of this movie with focus & good form, you'll get a great workout. While its nice they used contestants from the show, it's also unfortunate because as other reviewers have mentioned, everyone is all over the place & form is sloppy. The trick is to focus on yourself & your own form.

It Is also worth mentioning that you can customize your workout, meaning you can choose what order each segment plays & which ones you want to play.

In conclusion, this is a good beginner workout as long as your form is correct. Personally, I have moved on to bigger & better workouts, but this DVD will always be able to take some credit for starting me on my path to fitness.",1422057600,,1518,4.149659863945578

2967863,4,B000WEVGHA,"I'm a yo-yo exerciser. I get motivated, start working out, get fit and stick with it for six months to a year. Then I slack off, return to the couch, and gain fifteen pounds. Typically when I can't button my pants anymore and am faced with either losing weight or buying new clothes, I get motivated and get back on the exercise wagon. Just so you know where I'm coming from.

This workout is my 'go-to' when I need to kick my butt back in gear. It's hard, it makes me sweat buckets, and for some reason gets me back in the workout mindset.

That said, this workout is a hot mess. I love Bob Harper, and over the years I've only ever done his segments (Warm-Up & Level 1). I tried the other two levels but couldn't stand either instructor. But for those who haven't tried this workout, here's my two cents on the pros & cons:

Pros:

It's challenging. It makes me feel like I'm actually accomplishing something, and I think that's why it helps get me back in workout mode. I see results very quickly, which helps keep me motivated. But even though it's challenging, I can actually DO all of the exercises (with my own modifications when necessary).

Cons:

Oh my, there's a lot. First of all, Bob just makes it up as he goes along. It's unprofessional. The workout obviously isn't structured or planned out. My biggest problem with that is that it makes SO much of the workout unbalanced. The sets and stretches aren't always the same for both sides, which really bugs me.

Second, Bob's cueing is awful. The BL contestants are often confused as to what they're supposed to be doing, and the first few times through so was I. Bob calls a side lunge a front lunge, mixes up jumping jacks with jumping rope, and isn't consistent with his counts. After you've done the workout a few times you can correct some of this yourself and keep counts in your head as you go along, but the first few times through are highly annoying.

Third, the instruction is AWFUL. I appreciate that *real* people are doing the workout, but Bob NEVER corrects or instructs them in proper form. That means everyone is all over the map, and if you're just starting out you can easily injure yourself by following the wrong person.

Fourth, it's high impact. There is a lot of jumping, hopping, and popping up. When you combine that with the horrible form demonstrated in the video, it is very easy to get hurt. When Bob says ""jump"" I ignore him, no matter how fit I happen to be, because I have bad knees. Instead I add hand weights where he doesn't to keep the intensity up. **For those with bad knees and backs, be VERY careful with this workout.

Fifth, the cool down is NOT a real cool-down & stretch. It's a mini-yoga workout with challenging poses. I don't do yoga and I'm not very flexible, so his yoga poses are too challenging for me.

So, with all that, why do I keep coming back to this workout over and over again? Because it works. No matter what fitness level I'm at it still makes me sweat buckets. I feel it in my tush and legs the next day. I've done it so many times that I can keep my own counts and make sure it is safe and balanced - and that means I get a great workout. And there is just something about it that keeps me coming back. When I need to get back on the exercise wagon, this is always where I start.",1409356800,2,3306,4.333333333333333

First of all, Bob, the instructor, doesn't even give you cues or do a countdown so you don't even know when it's almost time to switch to another move. There is so much jumping around -  you go from being still to jumping around like crazy, which wasn't a warm up at all! You go from 0 to 100 in 10 seconds and then to 0 again, so for me, the lack of gradual increase in cardio rate to gradual decrease was HORRIBLE and I felt like I was going to pass out. I don't think it's the healthiest way for your heart to exercise. Aside from feeling like I was going to faint, all of the extras in the video were totally out of sync with the cues and all at different fitness levels from each other so it's impossible to follow along or know the proper form. They seemed like they didn't even know what to do!

One word sums this up: JUNK. Save your money and get a real choreographed, proper cardio DVD. Basically, this went in the trash.",1407715200,,1083,4.07981220657277
2967868,5,B000WEVGHA,"this is my favorite workout video. I have others by Jillian, like 30 day Shred and Ripped in 30. i love the routine of this video and get great results from it (even my husband noticed the back of my legs getting more shapely). i think the others by Jillian are a little more challenging but this one is more fun. i love it so much that i was doing it daily last summer (big mistake to do the same of any exercise activity everyday cuz it doesn't give your muscles time to heal). i bought the complementary disk, Power Sculpt, that they recommend doing on alternate days as this video. It's pretty good and mainly uses combo moves and ones I haven't tried before.  i just wish there wasn't so much squatting and lunges involved in this video since i have tight hip flexors that caused problems with these repetitive movements. guess i just have to keep stretching till i can get back into this routine.",1407715200,,902,4.401197604790419

2967870,1,B000WEVGHA,"After doing some light cardio 5 days a week, I decided to give this DVD a try.  To my surprise it was pretty difficult and I could not complete the first level.  The former Biggest Losers contestants do the workouts along with the trainers, and I did not like that at all.  The contestants look lost half the time and complete the moves in a sloppy manner.  I would rather watch professionals so I know the correct form.  I never used it after the first time.",1407283200,2,459,4.290697674418604

2967875,5,B000WEVGHA,"I love this DVD. It is not for begginers who are extremely out of shape. There are a lot of different moves and even pushups/crawls, It is definitely Cardio Max.",1402444800,,161,4.4
2967876,4,B000WEVGHA,"I am a fitness DVD junkie - I have tons of Jillian Michaels' videos and several others that I try and rotate between. Upon picking my dvd for the morning, I realized that I didn't have any good cardio workouts. I had the kick boxing one from Jillian and I was less than impressed and got bored quickly so after searching Amazon, I found this gem.

I will be honest in saying I've only done it twice now, but so far, it's pretty darn good! It's not quite what I was expecting, but in some ways, I appreciate that. I like that it's not all fitness models that you will never look like with just an at home dvd being done for 30 minutes a day. I like that everyone is a different size a shape and in some areas, they're having just as hard a time as you while doing it. Bob is adorable. There have been a couple of times, where I want to shush him, but otherwise, he's a great motivator!
I finished the workouts initially thinking ""was that it?""  Granted, I was sweating and my heart was definitely up, but I am used to Jillian's sculpting workouts with weights and honestly struggling through most of her routines. That was when the light went on: I didn't struggle in the same way because I'm not doing strength. I am getting my heart rate up and having a pretty good time doing it. That's the BEST part. I also became sore quickly and realized that I was working muscles that I don't usually focus on and the best part for me was that my glutes were sore. I am trying to build a booty and the workouts that I have that say they are for legs and butt don't make my rear end sore like this, so I know it's working already!
The only downside is the last routine is just ""meh"", hence the 4 stars, but otherwise, I highly recommend this for anyone needing good cardio in their life! I will continue to buy The Biggest Loser workouts. :)",1401840000,7,1831,4.198863636363637

I always thought seriously I am just not disciplined enough or I can't do those moves or .... excuses, excuses, excuses....  Eventually I ran out of excuses and an automatic gym membership which I occasionally use.  After watching a few episodes of the Biggest Looser I was encouraged.  After trying this DVD with the Power Sculpt, I was motivated as the pounds start dropping.  I no longer have a gym membership but what I do have is a fabulous body in progress.

I only did the warmup, the first cardio segment, and the cool down.  I'd forgotten how many lunges Bob does.  I have a hard time with lunges and my knees so I tend to substitute either side lunges or squats for them.  The pace is quick, which I like.  Some others have complained about the ""all over the place"" aspect of the contestant participants but I actually find that sort of funny - it's a nice departure from the hard bodies that I have to watch when I'm using my other Jillian Michaels DVDs.

I hate to criticize a product based on it not being good for the target market - but they've made a killing on this franchise of tv shows with very obese people using their guidance. I think the assumption was warranted.
So I bought this a while back and not only couldn't even begin to get through most of the exercises. I also disregarded their coaching to push harder as I already felt like I was going to injure myself.
Since then, I have lost about 45 pounds and am active and in much better shape so I thought I'd give it another try. Turns out I don't really like the exercises and I really don't care for Jillian MIchaels. I know this is a subjective evaluation. I don't like it and you might not either. Denise Austin is a great one for beginners who need to get to moving more and Cathe Friedrich specializes in high-intensity but low impact and is awesome to work your way up to after some time with Denise.",1390089600,2,1020,4.345549738219895
2967891,5,B000WEVGHA,"I was given this dvd and started my weight loss journey on Dec 23, 2014.  I like to watch workout dvd's before I use them so I can see the basic concepts.  With my first workout I was very tired by the end of the warm-up lol but I told myself to press on. By the yoga cool down each day my core is on fire and the balance required of the yoga poses really gives me that final core burn.  This really is all cardio and boy can you feel it.  I love that they make a point to tell you to do what you can and modify as needed but to go as hard as you can.  I just started my 4th week and I am down 14 lbs. I use the dvd 5-6 times a week.  I like that I get to add another workout and change up the trainer as well as the moves.  I really like that Jillian sticks with most of the workout for level 2, it helps to see she thinks its hard too and to see the proper form.  I like how Bob has me laughing and smiling through most of the level 1.  I have not started level 3 yet but I will update here when I do.  I only use the weights 1-2 workouts a week as I get too sore to use them everyday for now.  I have already noticed my flexibility grow, my stomach is flatter, legs firmer and I am able to most all the level 1 moves now with fewer modifications and I am working on level 2.  I will most likely repeat this after the first six weeks and add the power sculpt dvd to tone up while I continue to burn fat.",1389744000,,1405,3.6778523489932886

I had no trouble following it even up to the hardest level well into my 7th month.  I had to stop only because the jumping jacks felt weird after that.",1388620800,,410,4.355263157894737

2967902,3,B000WEVGHA,"Several years ago I lost the baby weight by doing the JIllian MIchaels 30 Day Shred. It was a painful 30 days but the results were pretty decent. Since then I have moved on to Ripped in 30 and some of her other titles, LIke No More Trouble Zones, Banish Fat and Boost Metabolism and the last one which is titled Extreme something or other. I find the last 3 titles to be the most difficult. I still do a workout 4-7 days a week. I'll do one level of 30 day Shred then go for a 2-3 mile run. Or I'll do one of the more difficult workouts I mentioned without the run. So now you can imagine that I'm in somewhat decent shape. However, I always have 5-10 lbs to lose and enjoy eating so I definitely don't look like Jillian or one of her workout buddies.

I got this Cardio Max mostly because in the beginning of 30 Day Shred there's an ad for it and I became curious.

The pluses are that you can customize your workout. You can do one or all of the workouts which is great for people at different levels. At first when I read some of the reviews, I was scared so I only did the warm up and Bob's first workout. I didn't break too much of a sweat so I moved on to the last two and the cool down. At the end I didn't feel challenged enough. That was my minus. I suppose I can up the ante by using heavier weights in the first level. As others have pointed out the last workout by Kim isn't very strenuous and should be in the beginning or something like that.

Overall, I would say this is an ok workout. IT's not the most strenuous but it provided a decent cardio workout when I couldn't go for my run.",1383264000,2,1600,4.009404388714733

2967916,4,B000WEVGHA,"I received this video as a gift a couple years ago. I tried it at first, but soon it got pushed back into the lost DVDs. I pulled it out again 3 weeks ago, and have been trying to do it at least 3 x week. Let me tell you a little about myself. I'm a 35 year old female with 4 children ages 17 to 11. I'm not terribly disciplined. I work full time. I am 5'9"" and when I started this video I weighed 184 lbs. The level 1 is definitely tough when you first start out, but you will notice that that the more you do it gets easier. When I started it, I had a tough time getting through the level 1, and my muscles were quite sore. After a couple days, I decided to add 3 lb weights (I have noodle arms) and adding just that little bit, I thought I was going to die. I did it another week and even though I still found it challenging, I no longer thought that I was going to die. I will admit that I can not do the push up parts with my noodle arms, but I try. After 2 weeks, I decided to add the level 2. I made it though, but had wobbly legs at the end and was gasping for air. I've done the 2 levels together twice now, and my muscles are still sore, but not ""OH MY GOD I CAN'T MOVE SORE!"" My weight after 2.5 weeks is 179. Not too bad. I have to add that I also bought a pilates video to do in between this video, and I have tried to eat better. I will confess that in these last 2 weeks I ate some Mexican food with chips and salsa, pizza, and cake and ice cream. I also still eat cheeseburgers occasionally (just skip the fries).

2967937,3,B000WEVGHA,"I see in a lot of reviews, people mentioned that they like the use of ""real people."" While I like this in theory, I have to say - not all contestants are from current seasons and I found myself thinking, ""you've been doing this for how long?"" Also, the trainers (particularly Bob) did not keep everyone in sync or in proper form, so it felt extremely chaotic and disjointed. I sort of felt like I was witnessing a class for a new trainer who couldn't keep people together.

My biggest complaint is the form used in demonstrating exercises. Bob barely does any of the exercises and then you are left to watch everyone else stumble through their own version, and none of the trainers look like they've ever been taught to punch or kick properly.

If you can get past these annoyances, you do end up getting a decent workout that burns a respectable amount of calories.",1363737600,4,866,4.509554140127388

2967942,4,B000WEVGHA,I would consider my self in decent shape. I attend group fitness classes and weight train at the gym about 5 times a week. I have 2 young children so I can't get outside in the winter for a run or can't always make it to the gym. I started this dvd with (2nd level) weeks 3-4 and it was a decent 30min of good cardio and small amount of strength training. The week 5-6 cardio seems to be a little more intense and definitely a decent cardio workout.  I am not usually motivated by looking at the contestants of the biggest loser but after doing the work-out I do admire those overweight individuals for taking it up a notch and doing these workouts. It is a challenging fitness routine.  The instructors are motivating.,1360886400,,719,4.358208955223881
2967943,1,B000WEVGHA,"This is a total waste of time and money! I work out regularly, about 4-5 days a week and in the cold months, look for indoor workouts opposed to my preference of running.  This is a very beginner workout.  Even though the people doing the workout are sweating buckets after the warm-up, I barely dropped a bead of sweat at the end of 50 minutes.  The ""real"" people doing the workout look like uncoordinated zombies wondering why they signed up for this ridiculous workout.  The trainers seem bored, wanting everyone to look interested but seemingly throwing new steps at you like they just thought of them.  Totally unchoreographed routines.  In the level 3 workout, Kim does a bob-and-weave boxing move for 2 minutes straight without changing anything up.  All the while, the poor people doing this workout look confused, dazed and unable to keep up.  Although I love Jillian and recommend her personal workout DVD's (I have several)she looks ready to scream and make a run for it.  Gritting her teeth, she tries to encourage these poor fools who don't know what hit them. She changes up her routine after realizing they can't keep up.  The ""cool-down"" is a series of random yoga poses that Bob pulls out of nowhere.  He can't even do the ones he's asking everyone else to do, stumbling and then pretending to ""help"" others with positioning.  It was comical.  So, yeah, don't bother.  I also have The Biggest Loser Cardio Max Weight Loss which is better but you have to put up with Bob frequently doing close-ups at the camera.  I keep the volume off for that one.

I like that its customizable and I can do any combination of the 3 workouts (1-20 minute and 2-10 minute options) and I like that I can program it to play through however I want it. The 3rd workout actually seems the weakest (even though its level 3) but its still good in combination with the others. I definitely sweat when doing this workout, my heart rate goes up and I'm not bored because there's good variety.

2967961,5,B000WEVGHA,"Hello... I'll try to be as direct as possible.

I tried to follow a few workout videos including P90X, 10 Minute Trainer, some exercises by myself and even tried the Boot Camp by The Biggest Loser. I couldn't keep up with them.

I don't know if it was because this time I really wanted to do something but I started to follow Cardio Max.

Let me tell you, I did the warm-up ALMOST without problem.. but after the first 5 minutes of the real work-out I fell on my back trying to catch a breath and I thought "".. it's impossible to do this! "" but what made me try again was that I saw a few guys on the video even heavier than me trying to do it and actually doing it.

The second thing that motivated me was that the work out (the first level) is only 25 minutes long (20 really because the first 5 is warm up).

Anyway.. I did some effort and was able to complete the first level after around 3 times.. then I did it for about a month resting 1 or 2 days a week.

I loved it because it really made me sweat and yes, I saw results on the mirror.

One last thing.

I don't really follow a diet or watch my calories intake besides I drink a few beers almost everyday. So...

If I was able to see results without watching my diet and drinking a lot of beer.. Imagine the results you will get by watching your diet a little bit.!!!!

Rigth now I'm doing the Biggest Loser workout Boot Camp and this time I was able to do it I believe that thanks to Cardio Max..

The results are even more notorious I feel muscles on almost every part of my body and my friends at work have started to tell me how different I look.

Yes, I would start with Cardio Max Level 1 for at least 1 month and then The Boot Camp which I think helps to define mucles even more.

I do the first level on each video because I'm very busy and these 25-minute workouts are ideal for me but if you have the time do the 3 levels of each video I'm sure you'll see results even faster.

Thanks",1342828800,2,1953,4.0
2967962,3,B000WEVGHA,"I will start out by saying that I am a little above average as far as fitness level.  I have tried all of Jillian Michaels DVD's and some of Bob's and thought maybe this cardio workout would be a good edition.

But for me, this workout was not challenging enough. I found Bob and Kim's sections to be really easy, even when I tried the more advanced moves Bob suggested. I also didn't like Bob's style at all in this video. I wanted a pure cardio workout.  I liked Jillian's because it was basically all really heart pumping moves one after another. Bob's had a lot more strength moves that didn't get my heart rate up as much.  I think this workout is best suited towards someone just starting out/beginner fitness level.

I also found Bob's section to be a little cluttered. There just seemed to be so many people. I definitely preferred when only four others were in the background. Not that this is really a huge deal but less people made it easier to see the moves.  I also noticed that some of the contestants just looked miserable and like they were barely trying.  That also just kind of turned me off and made me laugh.

I think this video is on the same difficulty level as 30 Day Shred or Ripped in 30.  I think for a more difficult cardio workout I would try Banish Fat Boost Metabolism (it is like Jillian's section the whole time but with more types of moves).  Or try Turbo Jam workouts.",1342310400,,1402,4.357692307692307

2967964,5,B000WEVGHA,I really like this workout.  There are three separate workouts and the DVD allows you to choose which ones you want to do.  Normally I do Bob's and Jillian's and skip the other girl's workout because I just can't get into her's.  The work outs are moderately intense.  There are definitely both harder and easier DVD's out there.

2967969,3,B000WEVGHA,"I'm pretty overweight and though it's a good workout I was looking for something harder.  I'm now not a big fan of the Biggest Loser workout DVD's that feature some of the contestants doing the moves.  It looks more like the Keystone Cops as no one is doing the same exercise at the same time which would be funny if it weren't so annoying.  Jillian's workout (2), though only 10 minutes, is the toughest so I usually start with that one. She does a nice job of explaining the moves and does about 90% of the workout with you so she's just as tired as you at the end. Then I move to Bob's (1) which is 20 minutes with 6 completely disorganized goofball contestants doing halfa$$ed moves.  Bob doesn't do a terrific job explaining the moves - he does it once and then walks around the contestants of which maybe one is doing it correctly.  I actually pulled my hamstring because of incorrect technique for one of the exercises. Then I do Kim's (3) last since the first 3 of her 10 minutes are just doing simple ""bobbing"" boxing moves as a kind of cooldown.  She also does 90% of the workout with you and demonstrates the moves very nicely, but it isn't that intense for me.  If you have been doing something like Jillian's 30 Day Shred for a month or two, this will be a step down.  I'm waiting for Jillian's Kickboxing DVD to come out because I did enjoy Kim's kickboxing part of the DVD. I also prefer when the helpers are professional trainers who know how to do the moves like in the 30 Day Shred.  I think if you are really overweight and out of shape and haven't exercised a minute in the last 10 years, this is for you.",1330041600,,1625,4.284313725490196

Level 2 with Jillian is my favorite, out of all 3 sections, hers is my favorite because I find it the most challenging since your constantly moving and the cardio is more challenging. Level 3 with Kim is pretty challening, but still easier than level 2 with Jillian.

These workouts definitely get your heart pumping. What I like most about this DVD is that the contestants are working out with you, which helps me to push myself further since I feel like I'm not doing the workout alone. I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to get in shape fast. It takes determination to stick with it, but if you do and you eat right, you will see results fast!",1324944000,,1051,4.33502538071066
2967975,3,B000WEVGHA,Did this for a couple of days and got bored! Don't think I could do it for 6 weeks straight like they suggest. I am mixing it with other DVDs and it's a good workout.,1324425600,,166,3.7714285714285714
2967976,2,B000WEVGHA,"I thought this video would be a good way to start boosting the cardio. I'm in the process of getting back in shape, and I figured that:

1) I could handle this -- and even if I couldn't do it all, I was glad that the sections were customizable.
2) Being a product of ""The Biggest Loser"", the trainers wouldn't be the standard narcissistic jerks that turn into P.E. teachers and gym trainers.

And both of these were true -- I don't think I could have made it through the entire 50-minute workout the first time. And Bob was offering encouragement and beginner alternatives a lot.

But I still couldn't do more than 20 minutes of this because Bob does each exercise only once and then the camera goes to the students WHO DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT THEY'RE DOING while Bob wanders around and talks. So every move that he wanted me to do, if I didn't pick up how to do it the first time, I was lost, because I couldn't follow the students' bad form.

I understand -- and greatly appreciate -- the fact that the students are ""regular"" people. It's very encouraging to see people like me reaching for the same goal. But the trainers need to do the exercises a lot more, or the students need to be more familiar with the exercises.

I'll come back to this DVD once I've found one from which I can actually learn.",1323216000,,1302,4.319672131147541

The first day I did this I did the warm-up and about 15 minutes of the workout and at the end my legs were jelly and I was sweating all over the place. Over the course of the next few days I was able to go longer and longer into the video but still have those jelly legs and face covered in sweat...the sign of a good workout. I have that mommy tummy and I am just trying to get back into shape after having my youngest 7 months ago and this is deff doing the trick. I would recomend it to anyone!,1318896000,,569,3.871794871794872
2967981,5,B000WEVGHA,"The difficulty of this workout pales in comparison to that of Jillian's Boost Metabolism, however, that said it is still an effective and challenging cardio workout. I consider myself and advanced exerciser and I plan to use this as my cardio workout when I want something less challenging. I still end it pretty sweaty and tired but I definitely don't feel like I'm gonna die like some plyo DVDs. I highly recommend it as a cardio DVD for maintenance or for someone who is overweight and needs to get back in shape. Someone who has some weight to lose will find it challenging and will find that the DVD will give you room to grow. For instance, it can be done with or without weights. The broken up segments also make it seem like it goes by faster.",1318032000,,751,4.449275362318841
2967982,4,B000WEVGHA,"I purchased this video because it was cardio and not interval training like most of my other videos. While I enjoy Level 1 of this video, Bob Harper teaches this one there are a few issues I have with it.

There are 3 levels and there is a different trainer for each segment. One is 20 minutes, the other two are only 10 minutes long. {kind of a let down}. While I am in pretty good physical condition, and  workout 6 days a week someone who is not so informed or who is very overweight could have trouble with this video. The 10 minute section Jillian teaches recycles some moves from her Boost Your Metabolism video,(high knees and a few others).The other ladies portions seems like a waste of time to me.

There is a decent amount of lunges in this video. If you do not use proper form, i could see you having knee issues. Also while I commend them on using actual contestants it is distracting to watch them while exercising. A lot of them seem to be doing their own thing so its confusing. I know some people need to modify for their fitness level but they should use people who can at least do the workout somewhat in correct form.

Overall Bob Harpers section is the only one that I like, and most days I just do his twice then cool down. I like his section enough to ignore the flaws in this video.",1317772800,2,1306,4.254032258064516
2967983,5,B000WEVGHA,"WoW will this make you sweat! I have tried lots of different in home/on the treadmill/elliptical cardio workouts and I can never seem to make it through because I am not pushed, or I'm to busy thinking how much it hurts, or I have to do it for way to long each day so it gets boring. I really enjoy this workout because I can feel it working, I felt like I really accomplished something in a short period of time each day, and they don't give you time to think about how much you are sweating and hurting. By the time I started thinking ""Oh my gosh, what if I can't.."", they were moving on to the next move, or kicking it up a notch! I agree with the review that says the levels seem to be in reverse, the lunges in level one certainly whooped my butt into shape...Literally! I liked how even the first time I did this dvd on level one, they make you feel great about it even if you can't do it with the weights yet, and you can't get as low as they do on their lunges, etc.

The Point: great cardio workout in 20-30min, 4-5days a week, that makes you feel good enough (about yourself) at the end to keep coming back to it every day (even though your legs and butt are feeling the burn)!

Also, if you are feeling it super tough in those first few days like me, I greatly advise hot baths. ;)",1316649600,2,1292,4.0627450980392155

The last segment with Kim was pretty easy too.  The only segment that was good and only reason why this video even deserved 1 star was Jillian's segment.  And even that was her ""Fat Boost Metabolism"" video.  Totally skip this if you're not a beginner.  I'm glad I borrowed this from the library.",1316563200,3,448,4.525
2967985,5,B000WEVGHA,"My husband has the P90X AND the INSANITY WORKOUTS which, don't get me wrong, kick your butt BUT THIS IS ONE HARD VIDEO and I have done MOST all (or at least tried) the P90X videos.  I'm not saying it's harder or better, but for ME and my desire to do pure cardio for fat burning, this does the job!!

I am a typical 40 something woman who has gradually packed on the weight over the years and I need good ol' fashioned pure fat burning cardio.  I am a Mom with little time to work out and I want to KILL it in 50 minutes and get the most I can from a DVD.  This dvd does the trick!!  Jillians middle segment never gets easier and pushes me to the limit.  Bob's segment is awesome and rips up my glutes and thighes with a LOT of lunges.  The final segment is just OK BUT it is great for the gradual cool down.

There's no way if you are doing this 5x a week and eating smart that you will not melt the pounds off.  BEWARE if you havent' worked out in a while, your behind and thighs will be SUPER SORE the next few days but that is a good thing.  Bob really focuses on building up the larger muscles in your body, more muscle burns more fat so you might as well build up those large glute and leg muscles!!

Weight training is important too, I bought the combo DVD set with the sculpting DVD as well.

My husband has never had an interest in doing this DVD with me until yesterday. He didn't think it would be challenging compared to his uber-extreme videos.  Well, he is SORE today and soooo impressed with the cardio workout he got. He's hooked.",1316217600,4,1546,4.079470198675497

As far as the workout itself, I broke out a sweat and my muscles were definitely sore the next few days.  But even if you can get past how boring it gets, Bob's *constant* talking through his whole segment might drive you crazy like it did me, as well as Jillian's harsh commentary that didn't sound encouraging at all.  You can play the dvd with music only but then its hard to do push ups and stare at the tv screen to know what to do next.  Its a good workout but it lacks that fun energy some other workout dvds have and the instructors talk way too much.",1315267200,,720,4.121428571428571
2967987,5,B000WEVGHA,"This program is excellent as long as you take it seriously and really do what they are telling you to do. Some people can't stick with in-home workouts or DVD exercising, but if you really do these workouts and stick to the program you will definitely see results! My husband doesn't like doing DVD workouts, he much prefers going to the gym and lifting weights or doing his cardio outside, but even he says that this DVD really tests your endurance. I particularly like it because it is motivational and I don't have to worry about what other people think or who is staring at me as I'm working out because I'm in the comfort of my own home. I can really feel a difference when I am doing this program and I can tell it is working and building my stamina. I really get a full body workout with this, which is great in a cardio workout! I think this will be a great benefit to my overall health. I was over 200 pounds when we bought this DVD and I was able to do the workout pretty well, so it doesn't matter how big your are, anyone can do this! It's all about knowing your body and your limits and not pushing yourself past them, but doing your best to keep up. You have to have the personal drive for this to work for you, otherwise you will end up quitting and you won't see any results. There are no trainers to tell you to keep going, so you have to have the drive to make this worth the money. If you have that then this will be a great deal for you!
I am currently 170 pounds, but feel it necessary to note that I have also drastically changed my diet and I am taking supplements (hydroxycut) to help my weight loss.

A warm-up is supposed to gradually prepare your body for working out, not tire it out before you even get started.  Seriously!  Jumping jacks for warm-up?!  I was sore before I started the main cardio routine.  The Level 1 cardio is unevenly paced, and the moves are too quick for the average viewer to keep up with.  And Bob-whatever-his-name-is is kind of a jerk.  Sure, he acts all nice and chummy, but I can't stand his smug face and the way he doesn't participate in the workout himself.  He's like a motivational speaker: telling, not showing.  And I have trouble being inspired by that.

Bottom line, this workout was too much, too fast.  Definitely not for beginners.  I'm not the most fit person in the world, but I've done my share of workout DVDs and can keep up with most of them.  But this one was ridiculous.",1311033600,6,891,4.453416149068323

At first, I thought, ""no big deal.""  But, it kept doing it for the next 5 minutes.  I had to stop working out due to this.  I am upset because I took the time to pay for this DVD.

Second review:  Received replacement in less than 48 hours!  I think this is a great workout to really increase your core movements.  When I write core, I mean movements involving working out.  I am trying to enable my body to do more, so that I can condition it to do more of my future goals - running, karate and dancing.  My goals are to be more fit.  I am hoping weight loss comes along with that (I am a size 14/16).

Enough about me, I think that this DVD will be very difficult for someone who never works out.  The first time I tried this video (last year via youtube video), I got really hurt and I was sore for about 4 days.  This time, I am able to actually cool down during the cool down.

I read a review that talked about how the last 10 minutes are nothing compared to Bob & Jillians workouts.  I agree.  HOWEVER, I like that the last 10 minutes aren't quite so intense.

The DVD is packed with three different levels with different times and is programmed to be an intense cardio workout.

It's a great alternative for someone who cannot afford at a gym at the time, or an add-on to whatever it is you are doing. I usually add brisk walks along with doing the DVD - walking is a great exercise in itself. Focusing on being active, wanting to be healthy, losing weight, this DVD is a great addition. If wanting great results eating properly and getting nutrients helps along with exercise. The DVD gets you going, and will sweat a LOT which is nice. The lunges will get you in the beginning. I have a somewhat ""old"" injury on my knee and hip but gradually I'm working it off and am careful. Yoga and some stretches are included in the DVD which is nice, and helps with that. The first level for one to two weeks is somewhat brutal, and the second one is up there. I've started week 3 with the second level now added. I remember I couldn't even get started the first time I popped the DVD in. They do get you going. It's OK if you are a little off - or do things differently - they even mention that - and they are encouraging.

2968008,5,B000WEVGHA,"Wow!  Talk about RESULTS!  I have been exercising on and off for the last 17 years and recently put on some weight.  On a routine trip to buy a Brita water pitcher, there was a coupon attached for $5 off the purchase of a Biggest Loser workout DVD.  Always up for a deal, I chose to buy this DVD.  I am completely amazed with the fast results!  I have been working out with this DVD and following a low-fat, low-sodium diet for four weeks now.  So far, I have lost a total of 17 inches, 10 lbs., and a jeans size!  This is the most weight I have ever lost in such a short period of time and I contribute most of it to this workout.

It is a tough, highly intense, cardio workout.  I really dislike cardio, but truthfully, it is the only exercise that will burn fat off your body.  It consists of a warm-up, 3 levels of intensity, and a cool down.  It is customized to put you on a 6 week exercise program; however, I chose to make it a 9 week program since I consider myself to be a beginner again.  Level I consists of a 20 minute aerobic workout with Bob Harper, who is truly gifted and amazing when it comes to fitness and weight loss.  In addition to Bob, the other people doing the workout are former Biggest Loser contestants.  This keeps me motivated because when I see how far they have come, and that they are not stopping, it encourages me to continue on, too.  Next, you add in Level II, which is an additional 10 minutes of aerobics with Jillian Michaels.  This is where I am at right now.  You are so tired by the time you're done with Bob and then Jillian pops in and kicks the intensity up a notch.  I haven't gotten to level III yet, but that consists of Kim Lyons doing another 10 minutes of kickboxing.  By the time you complete this workout, you will look like one of the Biggest Loser contestants; by this, I mean you will have sweat pouring off of you in sheets.  There is some jumping involved on this DVD, but you can definitely modify the moves yourself to get rid of the jumping if you have joint problems.

The only drawbacks that I see with this workout is that they could have picked better music, for starters.  The Biggest Loser people are not always in sync, but what do you expect?  It's not like they are exercise physiologists.  And, last... the cool down is somewhat lacking.  There should be more time spent bringing down your heart rate before you jump right into the yoga.  It is somewhat difficult to be standing there huffing and puffing and trying to stretch immediately.  Also, the stretches are minimal.  Therefore, after the workout ends, I usually do an additional 15 minutes or so of stretching to prevent muscle cramping the next day.  If you don't, your legs will definitely be hurting later on.

Best weight loss workout I've ever done in my entire life!  I highly recommend it.",1300060800,10,2827,4.33587786259542

I almost gave up and thought that this was not a DVD to get for people who have not been exercising regularly. However, after a couple of weeks of working out, 2-3 times a week, I've been able to follow it to the end and now going on the next level. I agree with the other reviewer who said that it can be boring (lunges, lunges, and more lunges). But it works, it makes me sweat and my heart rate is certainly up when I'm doing the exercises. One thing that annoys me is the comment/conversation that Bob makes. I find them very distracting. I would prefer him to give a general encouragement and not engage in a joke/conversation in the session. (ex: Julie, how are you doing? Julie, are you going to stop? Oh look at Julie, she's working real hard, Oh look at Eric sweating, etc). As a person who is not very fit, I need all the concentration and energy that I can muster to do the exercise. And those jokes distract me. There is an option for music only, without trainer instruction. But I constantly have to look at the TV, which is hard since you constantly have to look up to the TV when doing exercise (instead of fully engrossed in your position).
All in all, this is a good work out DVD to have. Just be prepared, you may not be able to follow the whole thing from the start and will probably be sore for a couple of days after.",1299196800,,1604,4.160771704180064
2968010,4,B000WEVGHA,"I just bought the Cardio Max && several other Biggest Loser DVD's. After skimming through all of the workouts, I decided to start w/ the Cardio Max && Power Sculpt combo for the first 6wks. Today was my first workout using Cardio Max Level 1 (warm up, level 1 w/ Bob, cool down). I have to give Biggest Loser credit, it's definitely a high energy workout. I really didn't know what to expect from their DVD's, as I've only seen a couple episodes of the program, but I was very pleased w/ what I found.

I read tons of reviews w/ people complaining about none of the competitors being in sync && was shocked to read reviewers commenting on how fat, gross, && uninspiring the competitors were. Personally, as someone who has been overweight && @ top condition, I find anyone who gets off their butt to do any type of exercise inspiring. It didn't bother me that none of them were in sync, as I am rarely in sync w/ cardio workouts anyway. I'm not sure what gym those reviewers go to, but it's a rare occasion @ my gym when everyone in a cardio class are completely in sync w/ the instructor. But, I suppose some people have to find something to complain about...&& if this is ur only complaint w/ this DVD, count urself lucky.

Personally, I enjoyed the options that Bob gave u for lower or higher intensity workout. I only used 3lb weights today, because who knows the pain that tomorrow will bring, but I always enjoy the options of a tougher workout so I can push myself once I'm used to the routine. I didn't sweat as much as some reviews commented about (&& I think, right now, I'm in very poor shape), but Bob really did push my limits w/ the moving plank push-ups. Oh em gee! For most of the section I just stayed in plank position. :) && I'm not ashamed to admit it.

I love that u can completely customize ur routine if u don't want to use the previously set weekly routines. I will say that I am a little disappointed that there's not more of an ab workout anywhere on this DVD. I love to work on my abs && I'm a sucker for a good tummy burn the next morning. But, if u're like me, I'm sure u have ur own ab routine u could do separately.

Overall, I'm very pleased w/ this buy && look forward to upcoming weeks as I push myself further into the Biggest Loser workout routines. I would have given this routine 5 stars if anyone had worked on abs for any length of time, but I still don't think that u would be disappointed if u bought this DVD. Good luck! :)",1298851200,,2466,4.229299363057325
2968011,3,B000WEVGHA,"This workout video definitely gets me sweating and gets my heart rate up. The only thing is that I find this video to be a bit boring because there is so much repition! In the weeks 1-2 workout with Bob, be prepared for a heavy emphasis on leg workouts, specifically LOTS of lunges. Lunges to the front, lunges to the side, lunges with weights, lunges without weights. Then add in ""jumping rope"" a few times in between all that and you've got his workout. I want a total body workout in a DVD that claims to be ""cardio max"". I prefer the Jillian Michaels DVDs.

2968013,5,B000WEVGHA,"I recently bought a calorie counter/heart rate monitor watch because I was curious how good of a workout I was actually getting with this. I was really getting my heart rate up during the whole workout, but was only figuring maybe a couple hundred calories. I couldn't have been more wrong. During the 1st and 2nd level workouts (Bob's and Jillian's) I burned 674 calories. Sure, it's not as many as I need for my daily caloric deficit, but it's a heck of a lot more than I thought I was burning, and that was with me having to slow down a few times due to side cramps. I have no doubt that when I do this again tomorrow morning at full capacity (as much as I can muster at 7am...), I'll be able to burn at least 1000, half of the calories I need to burn daily to get to my deficit. I absolutely recommend this video. It gets your heart pumping and the calories burning without a lot of hard or high intensity moves. It's definitely a keeper for me.",1295654400,2,949,4.21978021978022

After one week, doing it each morning and night, I noticed my stomach actually getting flatter! if you want a workout that will BURN FAT this is it.

It's a bit tedious to get used to how to maneuver around the DVD for each workout but, once you've learned its format.. it's way easy. You have a few options for music and workout pace.

I found it to be challenging, and even though I'm at a pretty high fitness level (running, spinning, kickboxing, etc), I was out of breath and sweating profusely with this one. Bob's 20-min section was the toughest to get through. Once you get through those first 20 minutes, just keep going; Jillian's 10 minutes will keep your heart rate up, but you can stick with it. And Kim wasn't as annoying as I thought she'd be; her 10 minutes were doable as well. I do agree that this is not a workout for beginners, but then nothing I've seen on the Biggest Loser show would lead me to believe that THOSE workouts are for beginners, either. I like that the people in the DVD are real people who sometimes struggle with the workout themselves. This one and Bob's Biggest Loser Boot Camp are the best exercise DVDs I've found so far.",1288051200,,1000,4.352941176470588

2968027,5,B000WEVGHA,"I bought this DVD back in Dec 09 because it was annoying to run in the cold and rain in the great NW.  After the 1st workout, I was super sore for a whole week.  I never knew it would make feel so sore especially when I was jogging 3x a week for 30 minutes.  Seriously, my legs felt wobbly and butt muscles were hurting.  After a week of soreness, I continued with this dvd 3x a week and followed the instructions.  First 2 weeks do level 1 and then gradually add the other 3 levels.

I have to say I am impressed.  In less than a year I lost 16 lbs without going on a strict diet. My metabolism is at its highest, I consume about 2200-2300 calories a day and I have not gained a single pound, infact I think I'm still losing weight.  My legs, stomach, arms and butt are very toned.  (I have a flat butt and I thought this workout would make my bum even flatter but it turned out to be the opposite.  I have more muscles and it is shaped pretty nicely :0) ) And it feels great to be able to fit into my highschool clothes.  I recommend this anyone who seriously want to get back in shape.  The only thing I did in conjuction to this workout is drink at least 8 glasses of water a day, sleep more and eat home cooked meals more often.

I also recommend Jillian's ""Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism"" dvd.  This one is good for intermediate to advanced people.  If you can finish her whole routine without stopping on this DVD, then congratulations, you are super fit.  I still have to work on it.  I have to stop and take a 5 minute pause near the end of the video.  But one of these days I will complete it without stopping!",1285200000,5,1618,4.082539682539682
2968028,5,B000WEVGHA,"WOW!!!  I finally ordered this DVD and am so glad I did.  I've been exercising regularly for a year and a half starting out with Tony Horton 10 min trainer and then adding to my collection of DVD's as I found ones that interested me.  I recently got ""hooked"" on watching Biggest Loser on TV thus purchasing my first Biggest Loser DVDs, Yoga Meltdown & Power Sculpt.  I like to keep things interesting so I change up the workouts often so that I don't get bored and in a rut/plateau if you know what I mean.  So needless to say, I thought I was in pretty good cardio/strength health until this morning when I pressed play on Cardio Max Level 1 with Bob.
He kicked me right to the ground.  It was great!  Now I wonder if I was really getting the cardio workout that I needed in the 50 minute workouts I've been playing.  It's been just 6 short hours since I finished his level 1 and I'm really starting to feel it in every part of my body.  I already want to go home and try level 2 & 3 just to see if I can do it to my body again today.  As with the power sculpt dvd with bob, he's very motivating.  He really makes me feel like I can do this! I'm strong, think positive and just do it!
Again, I just have to say, ""WOW!""  If you don't have this DVD already, you should.  Even if it's the DVD you put in only once in a while it's worth it.  I can't wait for Levels 2 & 3.  Yeah!! to the Biggest Loser DVD's  I love them.",1283385600,,1418,3.9575971731448765

I am a personal trainer that, for many reasons, has been out of commission for over a year and was looking for a beginner dvd to help motivate back to shape.  I already know proper form and most importantly how to modify so I could do the moves and not re-injure myself so I was able to get a decent workout out of it without hurting myself.

In fact, I find it kind of refreshing that these are real people who have made amazing progress in losing weight, and are working out at their own pace.  No matter what levels I do, I am sweating from head to toe after this workout!  Plus, Bob is GREAT!  This is my first workout of Bob's that I have tried and I find myself saying, ""I get to workout with Bob today!""  He's funny, encouraging, doesn't intimidate you, and he gives you a great workout!  I find myself laughing out loud sometimes by what he and the others are saying (not very many workouts I can say that about).  Although I'm not a big fan of Jillian, her workout is good at level 2, and Kim's workout is also good (probably could be considered more a level 1 or 2 than a level 3 workout, imo).

It reminds me of a cardio kickboxing class that I took in college that got me in the best shape of my life.  I like it a lot better than other workout videos that Biggest Loser has come out with as the people are relatively normal size rather than in super great shape and it's almost more casual and less perfect.  More like a real workout class.  The first time I did this workout (the low level portion with Bob only) I was in pain for 3 days.  It was fantastic.

2968038,5,B000WEVGHA,"This is actually my fiancees review:
I have been in search of the PERFECT workout DVD! Ive tried gym memberships only to get bored and not push myself and end up giving up and quiting the membership.  Ive tried going for long walks and get even more bored and end up fumbling around with my MP3 player more than walking.
For the past 5 years the only type of physical activity was at my job.  I was on my feet,moving,walking,lifting pushing for 8-10 hours a day sometimes wit out sitting down for even a lunch break.
I ended up staying home this entire summer, not working and got pretty lazy and had decided to start to get in shape for our upcoming wedding. Im in no way a svelt, trim lady and I was starting to gain even more weight from not working anymore. I tried different workout dvds and even tried a few on youtube. Again with the boredome!!
I picked up this Cardio-Max DVD, some 5 pound hand weights, crossed my fingers and laced up my sneakers!
The 5 minute warm up is pretty intense, but I enjoyed it.  Then came Bob...Our little friend Bob! I managed to complete Bobs 20 minute section, and WOWWWWW its a workout! To some, 20 minutes may not seem like a lot, TRUST me and the other reviewers when I say...its a workout.  I typically do not sweat and will only manage to get my HR up a little bit.  I have just completed my 4th run thorugh this week of the same routine (warm up,Bob, then cool down) and Im not bored AND I noticed the last time was slightly easier for me to finish!  I do however have to curse my way through the last 5 minutes of Bobs section and voice out loud how much I disslike Bob for making me work so hard, but then I forgive him!

I have not managed to make it to level 2 or 3, I feel I need to be able to get through level one with some comfort.
**The one downside of this DVD is the ""cool down"".  I don't think that this is much of a cool down at all, while I do enjoy the yoga poses and the breathing..I stay put after and do stretches for my legs and back.  I highly recomend incorporating your own ADDITIONAL cool down after the workouts.  Otherwise this is a FANTASTIC video!

I work out at least 4 times a weak with cardio and weights, and I run frequently. Still, the beginning level on this DVD worked me harder than I regularly do at the gym. It's great because you can do it with or without weights and they modify some of the moves for those that aren't as advanced.

I popped the CardioMax DVD in a few months ago and was reminded what a challenge it is, even for someone who wasn't a stranger to working out.  I've been sticking with it pretty regularly and have discovered that my lower back pain has significantly decreased and I feel stronger and more energetic.

I was pretty much starting to breathe hard before I even got through the warm-up, and my heart rate stayed up throughout the whole 20 minutes of Cardio Level 1.

I really enjoyed having some of the actual Biggest Loser participants doing the workout behind Bob, and I also enjoy the different cardio levels of intesity that the various participants show. And Bob is motivating and still light, which for me works better than a ""drill sargeant"" approach. I've heard that's how Jillian can be, so I'm a little nervous of moving up to Level 2... not going to be able to put that off forever, though.",1271894400,,856,4.558441558441558

Plus it has all 3 trainers from the biggest loser on there- Bob, Jillian and Kim from season 3 or 4 I don't remember. Bob's workout uses weights and aims at different areas of the body while Jillian and Kim focus on the cardio without weights. Good for variety.",1271808000,,385,4.287671232876712
2968048,3,B000WEVGHA,"There were a couple of sequences in this workout that I thought were tough, but in general this wasn't a very hard workout.  The warm up didn't seem enough.  The first 20 min cardio session was a combo of weight exercises with a little bit of cardio.  A decent workout, but most didn't get my heart rate up (except the plyo lunges).  The level 2 workout with Jillian leading felt like just a lot of jumping.  the level 3 workout, which was supposed to be kickboxing, seemed to be mostly punching and twisting when I was hoping for a high intensity kicking routing.  I broke a sweat and burned some calories, but I won't be doing this workout again.",1271721600,,648,4.4033613445378155
2968049,4,B000WEVGHA,"Bob (Level One) is a little nerdy for me but I guess that doesn't effect the workout, right?  I prefer to do the Level Two and Level Three workouts together anyway, although I don't feel that they are really progressively harder than Level One.

2968050,4,B000WEVGHA,"I've been working out with the Cardio Max DVD for the last couple months in addition to my other DVDs (Jillian Michaels, Jackie Warner). I use it when I'm looking to take a break from strength training and just sweat it out... and this works! The DVD has a 5 minute warm up led by Bob, then a 20 minute Bob segment, 10 minute Jillian segment, and 10 minute Kim segment. Lastly, there is a 5 minute yoga cool down led by Bob.

I find Bob to be a little annoying so I tend to skip his segment, but I enjoy Jillian and Kim and I think that Jillian has the best cuing of the three. I think that if you have bad knees/hips then you're going to have a hard time with this DVD because there is a lot of jumping.

Another annoyance is that sometimes the Biggest Loser contestants don't have proper form.

Overall, I find the Biggest Loser DVDs in general a little sloppy, the Cardio Max workout included. BUT! I still think it's fun and it is an effective cardio workout. This has been my favorite Biggest Loser DVD yet and I think it would be a fun addition to almost anyone's fitness dvd libary",1270425600,,1088,4.196172248803828
2968051,4,B000WEVGHA,"One of the things I really like about BL videos is that they use ""real"" people rather than models, etc.  That being said, this is a great video for those days when you don't have time for a long cardio workout.  I really enjoy all three workouts.  I do agree with other reviews that state that workout #3 really isn't that difficult in comparison with the other two workouts. I assumed the workouts would be harder as they went - this isn't the case.  I personally thing Jillian's workout is the hardest, with Bob's next, then Kim's.

The only drawback is that it is very difficult to follow the BL contestants.  They often are out of sync with each other.  There's times where one person is punching right while the person next to them is punching left, or one is stepping to the right and the other is stepping to the left, etc.  Or they are out of sync with the beat of the music.  They do fine when the trainer is doing the moves with them, but when the trainer stops to explain or whatever, the contestants all switch to doing their own thing.  Sometimes it seems like they are competing to be the fastest or something.  It's very distracting.",1270080000,,1148,4.393364928909953

2968054,4,B000WEVGHA,"Great for getting your heart rate up!

Pros:
1) There are modifications available for most of the exercises for those that are just starting out.
2) It is nice to see the ""normal"" people in the background struggling to do the exercises too. Makes me feel a little better :)
3) Jillian and Bob do a good job of keeping you motivated by telling you why they were doing certain exercises and reminding you of why you are doing them at all. I am one of those people that do well with the ""boot camp"" style. No bubbly smiliness here.

Cons:
1) Can be very hard on knees and wrists. Much easier if you have a thick mat to work out on. Carpet was not enough for me.
2) Level 3 (with Kim) was not even close to the intensity of levels 1 and 2. Some of her moves were difficult to follow and I did not ""feel the burn"" like the other two levels.

Overall, I would recommend for beginners/ intermediates.",1267920000,2,893,4.180232558139535

I am trying the warm up, level 1 and cool down.  On first attempt, I got the warm up and 7 minutes of level 1 then had to quit.  Today, I was able to complete the exercises.  The exercises don't seem very challenging until you try it out. :-)  Got a good sweat going.  I think this is a great investment - just buy the DVD and get a pair of hand weights (or just grab 2 cans from the kitchen) compared to joining the Gym.  More efficient to exercise at home instead of wasting time driving to/from the gym.

Update: I am now able to do all 3 levels. :-)  Here's some interesting stats from my heart rate monitor... Level 1: 335 calories in 30 minutes... Level 2: 475 calories in 40 minutes... Level 3: 610 calories in 50 minutes.",1267833600,13,899,4.056818181818182

After not having an exercise routine for 9 months while carrying my baby, I found going to the gym and getting back into the routine difficult. The workouts on this DVD are perfect and easy to fit in while the little one is taking a nap. It's definitely challenging after having not worked out in such a long period of time, but you can feel the results after just one workout. What I like best about this DVD is that they have workouts for weeks 1&2 3&4 and 5&6 which gradually increase in difficulty. Bob is so great, he doesn't make you feel bad for not being able to keep up all the time, and emphasizes to just keep moving. Funny and relaxed atmosphere, while working really really hard! You will definitely break a sweat, and will not feel like the fat chick doing a workout video with a bunch of super skinny people. Its regular people, which is why I love it so much! and it's okay if you don't have the weights, you don't need them to get a good work out.

2968059,5,B000WEVGHA,"I usually like to run outside when I want exercise, but that can be kinda hard to do in the winter in Chicago when there's snow and ice piled up on the sidewalk. I don't like going to the gym because I find treadmills too boring and it's too much hassle driving, parking, getting changed in the locker room, etc. Then I thought I might try using a home workout DVD, and I got this one because of the good reviews on Amazon.

Bottom line: Best seven bucks I've ever spent. This DVD is _awesome_. I never knew it was possible to get so much cardio in 20 minutes without leaving a 20-square-foot space in your living room, using no equipment except for your own body. 10 minutes into the level 1 video, after doing the push-up routine, I'm sweating and panting like a pig. Bob is a good motivator, and I like that there are ""real"" people in the background who look just like your average Jane & Joe making an honest effort to lose weight. The workout seems quite thorough, working both my lower and upper body. The first time I tried the Level 1, I was sore for three days. I did eventually buy a pair of weights, and they help a lot.

If you're like me and want a workout you can do at home with minimal hassle, this is the DVD for you. And with a DVD like this, there's really no excuse for not exercising. Don't even think of saying you're ""too busy to work out."" You don't need to leave your house, you don't need to pull out your running shoes, you don't even need to get changed if you're alone at home -- just pull down the blinds, strip down to your underwear, and you're good to go! 20 minutes with this DVD is all it takes, and then you can hop straight into the shower. No locker rooms, no driving & parking, no slippery ice, no dogs chasing you, nada.

Like I mentioned before the workout is broken down into three levels. Level 1 is 20 minutes with Bob. Level 2 is 10 minutes with Jillian and Level 3 is 10 minutes with Kim.

Level 1 is led by Bob Harper and he does a great job of teaching the movements and encouraging you along. The cast's form isn't always the best--watch Bob not them!--but its nice to know there are other people working alongside you. Level 2 is a quick 10 minutes with Jillian Michaels. Its tough because she moves FAST, but the exercises get changed up quickly so the time flies by. I gave the DVD only 4 of 5 stars because Level 3 wasn't really a Level 3 to me. Compared to Jillian's Level 2, Kim Lyons' Level 3 was like a cool down. Its nice to add 10 more minutes to the workout, but it isn't any harder than the other two levels.

2968068,3,B000WEVGHA,"I bought this dvd because I already have all of Jillian Michael's videos and love them.  I have been doing her Banish Fat Boost Metabolism for about a week and lost 4 pounds.  So I bought this and was going to do the above plus one of the levels from this video.  There's no way this workout on it's own, doing the levels as instructed on the dvd is a good enough workout. Unless you are completely new to exercise, you're going to have to do more than the levels as they are.

Both Bob and Jillian's segments are good. Jillian's is more intense and feels harder even though it's only ten minutes and half the time of Bob's. The other one, what's-her-face (sorry, I don't watch the show that much and did not watch when she was on it), her workout is utterly pathetic. Skip it and just do Jillian's twice. Seriously, it's terrible. Her workout is a mess. There is little direction, her exercises are rather pathetic. She does not really tell you any proper form, so it was killing my back. (There is also a part of Bob's that hurts my back, but at least he tells you what to do if your lower back is hurting.) I have no idea how they think this woman's workout should be a level three. If it has to be included at all it should be level two, and Jillian should be level three.

The third trainer, and the fact that the levels being set up like they are...not very challenging, is why I'm giving it three stars. When I do this video, I go through the whole thing, except I do Jillian's segment twice.  Most times I only do Bob or Jillian's segment as a supplement to doing something else.

I think this video is okay for people just starting out, and may even be too hard for people who are older or very out of shape or have arthritis or other conditions. If you've been exercising for awhile this isn't going to cut it if you do it as instructed, do yourself a favor and buy one of Jillian's dvd's instead.",1261008000,,1907,4.236914600550964

There is no transition from one movement to the next, not even a small one. The cueing is terrible and the past contestants look as if they could care less about being there. Owning the majority of the Biggest loser workouts, even quite a few of Jillian Michaels workouts, where the cueing is superb, there are safe transitions and motivated contestants/exercisers, and safe directions and great info to get the most out of your workout, I can not recommend this workout to anyone.

I mostly wanted to write this to give a tip I've found useful with the cool down:  I've found that I can't go from the intense workout directly to deep breaths for yoga at the end.  My heart is racing and I can't get my breathing under control while standing.  Now after I'm done with the cardio before the cool down starts I drop into a ""Child's Pose"" and focus on deep breaths for a while.

It's a jumbled mess in my opinion. Bob's segment (level 1) is harder than Kim's level 3 segment. Jillian (level 2) is the best at being more organized and not just throwing moves in off the top of her head like Bob. Bob's segment spends too much time on squat-related moves, which could be hard on the knees for beginners. He also doesn't take enough time to make sure the biggest loser contestants have proper form, or are careful about certain injury prone areas, like lower back and knees. So, they all look really sloppy doing the work out, Bob and Kim don't do much of the moves with you, so Jillian's segment is the only one that's easier to follow.
They could have done better editing, it's a bit unprofessional in parts. There are a lot of Tae-bo wanna be moves. The flow and pace is jumbled and not smooth to follow. I'd rather stick to the real Tae-bo.",1253232000,2,1009,4.315789473684211

I was disappointed for a few reasons: Bob's workout (during the first weeks) is effective and makes you sweat, but his cuing is not good and he doesn't provide enough guidance about form. He's doing one thing while everyone else does another and he's not very focused. I'd like a bit more instruction. The dvd goes from high heart rate activity to standing cool down. I am in fairly good shape, but I need a gradual transition to cooling down. Bob starts the yoga stretch right after the cardio.
Jillian's workout is high intensity, but it's not interesting or fun. Her tactic is to motivate people by being tough on them, but this doesn't work for me. I am already motivated. I would like to enjoy the process, and not feel like I am forever doing the football run.
The third trainer, whose name escapes me, is by far my favorite. Her section is fun, enjoyable and the one I prefer to do repeatedly. She's great and I wish the entire dvd was devoted to her workouts. Bob is super cute and funny, but that's not gonna make me use the dvd repeatedly. I use it when I need a change up from the Get Ripped dvds, but BLW is way down on my list.",1252627200,3,1217,4.2956521739130435
2968086,3,B000WEVGHA,"As everyone else states, this dvd is a complete workout--that part is true. However every time I do Level 1 with Bob, my back HURTS afterwards. This is the only dvd/segment I have found that hurts my back. Im sure its the lunges using weights. I have tried to change it up a bit to, but the end result is always the same. I will not be doing level 1 anymore despite the fact I love Bob and his workouts. The pain isn't worth it! The rest of the dvd though, really good--especially Jillian's portion!",1252281600,2,499,4.2631578947368425
2968087,5,B000WEVGHA,"This has quickly become one of my favorite workouts! Its difficult and I get to change things up!  I tend to think level 2 is the hardest, you don't stop moving the entire time, but level 3 is my favorite, because I'm a fan of boxing and kick boxing, so its right up my alley.  I'm less of a fan of level 1, but I like to do a warm up, level 3, level 2, level 3 and cool down.  And I like that I can do that with this workout.

It does have some draw backs, my boyfriend tried it and it was entirely too difficult for him with his asthma, which I told him he should just not do things ""all out"" and just do some modified moves that are shown until he can do them completely.  Which I think would have helped his situation, and would help anyone else in the same situation.

Overall it is a kick ass workout, and is a great option for those of us who like to get a great workout from home spending much less than we would at a gym with the same results!  I have now lost 12 lbs thanks to both this dvd and a few others, and I'm proof that a gym isn't necessary.  Good luck to all, and I definitely recommend this!",1251158400,,1112,3.8893805309734515
2968088,5,B000WEVGHA,"For about a week now, I've been alternating the Cardio Max Workout with the Power Sculpt Workout.  Honestly.... I'm 27 years old and since I was 17, after high school sports were over, I've been looking for a workout that I can actually LOVE... and I never found it.  I tried everything.  I really really did.  I finally finally FINALLY found one I love!!  Maybe it's because I just started going back to school and have found a new sense of competitiveness inside me- not for others, but for myself, or maybe Biggest Loser is just awesome.  Regardless, I have found that I have so much motivation to do this DVD... and clearly competing with myself to see if I can make it through the whole workout today, or make it to the next level tomorrow.  Sheesh!  Who needs a workout partner!

I know people have complained that the Biggest Losers in the background are distracting because they are doing things wrong, but I actually like it, because I can correct myself by looking at them, knowing they are doing it wrong, then looking at myself and thinking- crap I'm doing it just like they are- I'm doing it wrong!  So then I correct myself.

The first day I wasn't able to get through the whole workout, in fact I only made it 10 minutes out of 20.  I was sore for... well.... I'm still sore from it!!  I could barely walk the next day- I LOVE that feeling- just knowing it's working!  After 4 times of doing it, I can get through the workout, and am so anxious to move on, but I know there is a reason for why this level is harder than the higher levels, and why it needs to be done for at least 2 weeks.  You've really got to jumpstart your metabolism and shock those muscles into action!  Then you really need to maintain it for a few weeks before moving on, otherwise your results may not be what you were expecting.

I'm thinking about purchasing Boot Camp for after my 6 weeks are over on these two DVD's, and possibly alternating it with the Yoga one..... any thoughts on that combo??

As for eating- I am TRYING to eat healthy, but I'm more of a ""natural"" dieter, and natural doesn't mean less calories, so I'm working on it.  I'd rather not eat fake foods.  I'm a honey over splenda kinda girl.

Anyways, I've taken my measurements (but not my weight- bc I don't care for that frustrating number as inches count way more than pounds and it's just discouraging when you don't see the number you want so fast) and took my before pictures, and I can't wait to *hopefully* see results in a few months!!!",1250899200,3,2506,4.369330453563715

I mean really you get a workout and then at times I thought he was crazy for pushing for more...so it is great.  However, i couldn't help but be distracted by the ""biggest losers"" competitors who were not always doing the moves correctly...so if you can see past the men and women in the background and focus on the moves and technique that he's giving you then you will love this dvd.  it is really intense and if you want to sweat and really get a great workout you will not be disappointed.",1250208000,3,573,4.1441441441441444
2968090,4,B000WEVGHA,"I love this workout, I've added it to the Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred.  The only comment is it feels as though the levels, one, two, and three should be reveresed. I just do one when I really want a burn and two and three together. I also really like that you can customize your workout program.  You just add a warmup, as many of the levels as you want, and a cooldown. Mix and match, change it up like you like.  And once you get really familiar with the workouts you can do it just to music, no instructor audio, if you'd like.  I like the options.",1249516800,,553,4.092592592592593
2968091,3,B000WEVGHA,"This isn't one of my favorite workout DVDs, but I do it once in a while, with modifications, for variety.

Pros:
- The steps are easy!  This can't be underrated; as someone who has trouble with more complicated aerobics, and won't go near a step class because my left and right get confused, it's good to do a workout where coordination is not an issue.  Also because no one is doing the workout in time to the music, you can just go whatever pace you want and it's fine.
- Good cardio.  There's a 5-minute warmup, then three main workout segments of 20, 10, and 10 minutes accordingly, then a 5-minute stretch.  My heart rate went up even during the warmup and stayed up for the three main workouts.  Of the three main segments, the first two were more high-impact and the third is lower impact (almost all cardio kickboxing stuff) and somewhat easier.
- Basically because lots of it is high-impact, you get a lot of bang for your buck in terms of calories burned in a short amount of time.

Cons:
- Too many lunges in the first main segment.
- Jillian's segment (2nd main one) not very adaptable for pre-natal use.  It should be avoided altogether after 1st trimester--there's no one doing low-impact modifications in this segment and it's way too jostly jumping around for 10 minutes.
- Kinda boring, unless you like boot-camp type workouts, which I don't.  I'm glad the segments are short because during the first two main ones, I kept wondering when they'd be over.  I enjoyed the 3rd one more--the cardio kickboxing one--in terms of being more fun and a little dance-y.
- Didn't really like the yoga stretch cooldown--a bunch of inhaling the arms up and down into prayer, then a warrior series with a triangle thrown in.  If I wanted yoga I'd do a different DVD.  Why I didn't like it?  It seemed tossed in because yoga's ""in""--it didn't seem to flow with the rest of the material.  I thought it should have more conventional stretches, particularly addressing the hamstrings--which aren't really stretched that well by triangle pose.  With all the work gastrocs and hamstrings get from the high impact nature of this DVD, they really need to be stretched more; if I don't my body really complains.  It's better actually to repeat the warm-up than do the cool-down here, as the warm-up stretches the needed areas.

Basically, if I'm short on time but want to have a cardio workout, I might pop this one in.  But I really prefer other workout DVDs--particularly Tae-bo or Ravi Singh and Ana Brett's kundalini yoga series.",1249257600,5,2526,4.663656884875847

2968095,5,B000WEVGHA,"I'm a busy student who doesn't have the time or the money for a gym membership, and as summer approached, I realized that working out OUTSIDE in the oppressive Miami heat was just not going to work. I've been wanting to shed about 8-10 lbs before school starts back again. I began my search for workout DVDs with some skepticism, thinking that it was going to be difficult to get a good workout from a DVD.

Oh, how I was wrong! I've watched The Biggest Loser show a few times and liked the favorable reviews on this DVD, so I decided to try it out. WHOA! What a workout! It is TOUGH and I sweat like crazy from doing this. My heart rate gets up very high, and I'm a 24 year old who is not overweight by any means. The first time I did this, I was sore for two days. You can really feel it all over your body. It is a challenging workout, and I'm having to work up to doing all three cardio sections. As of today, I can only do Bob's section (section 1) and about 3/4 of Jillian's (section 2). I haven't even touched Kim's section yet (section 3). Those jumping lunges in Bob's section are KILLER. If that doesn't get your heart rate pumping then you must be Superman.

The biggest plus is the fact that you don't need any equipment except for maybe a couple of small weights (but even those are optional as Bob states on the DVD), AND you don't need a lot of space AT ALL for this. I live in a small apartment and can easily do it there with no problems whatsoever. I've even been able to do it in my bedroom at my parent's house which is cluttered with furniture. I would recommend, however, doing this on carpet rather than tile. There is one part where you need to get down into pushup position, and that just hurts on tile, especially if you get tired and need to drop down to your knees for a bit.

Also, one last comment, some folks have complained about Bob being annoying in the DVD, but I like him. I like the talking and the motivation. I need that to keep going otherwise I get lazy and start slacking off. ;) In addition, it's nice to see the biggest loser cast on the DVD. It's nice to see women who are not 100 lbs with six-pack abs. It's nice to see normal women just fighting the good fight when it comes to losing weight. That's refreshing to me.

All in all, a great DVD and I am pleasantly surprised at what a great workout I'm getting. I've already lost two lbs!",1247356800,10,2383,4.162689804772234

Besides, the cues and the motions of the participants are constantly out of sync. Or I should say there is no rhythm in this DVD, particularly in level one.

The people working out in the video are biggest loser cast members: they are not models who look perfect.  I tell myself if they can do it so can I.  I have stuck with the video for two weeks and have been working out at least 3 times per weeks and I have already seen physical results.  My butt and legs have firmed up, and my biceps are toned.  I feel stronger and my endurance is enhanced. I also purchased Jillian's 30 day Shred and do that one at least twice per week.

I workout regularly and by the end of this workout, I am drenched (I also like to turn up the heat in my apartment before starting).  Bob's 20 minute workout is probably enough for anybody, but if you have more in the tank and want to step up the intensity, hop right into Jillian's workout. It is only 10 minutes, which is the perfect length after Bob's tough 20, and it is an intense, quick hitting session.  The final 10 minute workout is supervised by Kim.  It's primarily kickboxing-like activities, probably the easiest of the 3 and provides a good closing session.  If any of the workouts ever get to be too difficult, almost all have lighter variations (pushups on knees, low impact jumping jacks, etc).  All three are very good instructors.  Again, like all of the videos in this series, it is very time efficient.  Just blow it out and try your hardest for 10-20 minutes and you're done.",1244160000,,1026,4.508108108108108

I am still on beginner and trying level two on the cardio, the level two on the body sculpt isn't as hard for me. I am still getting a workout and sweating. I love that the people aren't fit/skinny and they aren't like a happy robots making every movement look easy. I love and respect all the sizes. I look at them and think if they have come that far and can do it, so can I. They are more real to me. I still have to stop and catch my breath. I will get there. All I can say is, if you want to start working out and like the series, then go for it. I like it. I haven't seen body changes but I haven't been doing it long. The point is, is to make time to workout for you. No dvd or gym membership is worth anything if not used.

I've always been active and a healthy weight, but I bought this because I had just given birth to my third child, and after having ""taken it easy"" for a few months, I wanted to tone up and feel stronger.  Reading the reviews for this, I decided I could take a chance.

Wow.  This will really work you hard.  Considering how much the cast members of ""TBL"" have lost, that shouldn't be a surprise.

I could feel myself getting stronger with each workout, and everyone commented that I was in great shape within just a few months of having given birth.  That was a year ago, and last fall, I started going to the gym, running and working out on the elliptical.  I really like a challenge, so when you read that, don't think for a second that I was going easy on myself.  But I recently had to drop the running due to back problems, so I started adding this workout back into my routine once or twice a week.  And every time I do it, I wish I'd never stopped. You just get real definition and visible results from it.

I feel like I can confidently recommend this for people of all fitness levels because of the ""customizing"" workout options.  I will say that I'm not a huge fan of the cool-down (I usually skip and do my own stretches).  It's called ""Yoga"", but there just isn't enough real honest-to-goodness stretching, just focusing on your breathing, which is nice and all, but...  I also think that there are some gaps between the different exercises -- usually I can squeeze in a couple extra before they start doing it.

2968121,4,B000WEVGHA,"I have been working out for 6 weeks, and just incorporated Cardio Max (and Power Sculpt) into my routine.  I had to get used to not having a formal instructor to follow along with because Bob starts the instructions, does a few (sometimes all) of the reps and then walks around before coming back to the front to give the next instruction.  It is non-stop with very little downtime between each exercise.  I had been doing the 30-Day Shred and while I was used to the intensity I was used to a few seconds between each move.  I alternate this video with Power Sculpt, which follows the same style--6-8 week program that increases every 2 weeks or when you're ready to move on to the next level.

I have never done so many lunges in my life--but if you want to round the corners off your backside, this video accomplishes that for sure.

However, if you have lower body injuries this video may not be the best choice for you.

I recommend keeping track of your progress with a measuring tape instead of a scale.  You'll be more modivated by your results.",1239321600,3,1053,4.447916666666667

I started cardio max using 2lb weights and really felt it. I never sweat so much even when I did the 30 day shred. I felt beat after the workout but nothing hurt. I got up today and my butt, back and sides hurt for sure. Taking today off from the workout. Will do it again tomorrow but without the weights maybe I rushed it. But I will definately keep doing the workout. Just need to lose about 15-20 lbs. This is definately a keeper.",1238457600,2,554,4.138888888888889
2968125,4,B000WEVGHA,"This is a challenging workout!  I agree with the other reviewers that said level 3 is more of a level 1 and vice versa.

I couldn't master the beginning when you can customize your workout so I gave up and just went in order of the exercises.  I liked Bob on the BL show but he was awful in this video.  No real instruction, all the exercisers were going at different speeds and different directions it was too hard to follow.  Bob was trying to talk all ""street"" I couldn't stand watching it anymore.  I hope the segment with ""just music"" is better.",1237507200,7,501,4.4021739130434785

Nearly 90% of those reviews recommended the Biggest loser Cardio Max DVD so I bought it. I'm 18, 5 foot and 1 inch and weighed 137 pounds. I've been on a diet and going to the gym for about a week and a half and lost 8 pounds! I got this video today and started with level 1... Let me tell you, I usually do about an hour at the gym on ellipticals and treadmills but that gets SOOO boring, plus I'm in college and I don't have time. This video is PERFECT, you can customize it and everything. I got it for 9$ so you really can't beat that!

It is short, but you are constantly moving and they really get your heart pumping!  The first time I did this work out I couldn't make it all the way through, but was very impressed at how good I felt after finishing it finally.  It is nice that people from past seasons are in the video because you can see modified ways of doing the exercises as well as get motivated that if they can do it so can you!  My only problem with the dvd is the cool down...it is yoga stretches and I don't always enjoy those, but it is effective.",1235433600,,649,4.168

This exercise routine finds all those muscles that I don't use often and lets me know where they are.  The first time I did this, I was thinking.. ""bring it on, I can do this!""  I did everything.. high intensity.  I was sore for 3 days.  The first day everything hurt. My quads, glutes, outsides of legs, inside of my legs and a little of my back. I could not even sit on my butt. It hurt too bad.  I just wished Bob left one or two muscles that were not sore so I could move or sit, as I could do neither.  I was bummed that I physically could not do ANYTHING the day after. I wanted a work out but not one that makes it so I can't continue my routine.
The 2nd time and from then on nothing hurt that bad.  I can still exercise every day now.  THank god. It is not a wimpy exerise video.  I felt like I actually did something afterward.",1235433600,,946,3.9523809523809526

2968142,5,B000WEVGHA,"This is a good dvd.  Sometimes I just don't feel like getting on the treadmill. LOL

I really enjoyed Bob. He's funny and engaging.  I found myself laughing along. Especially when one of the girls said, ""I wanna kill you Bob!""
I think she meant it. LOL  I used the 10 lb weights with him.
His workouts were good.

The next girl was pure cardio and she was all business. Lots of jumping, plyometrics and bouncing around. I actually broke a sweat with her. I'm no beginner but that was pretty intense.

The last lady, I didn't enjoy her workout as much. I just don't like lots of punches and kicks. I like to move around. I didn't feel as if I was getting enough of a workout. Her workout should have been the first.

Usually I only do Bob and the lady after him. It's a good 30 minute stretch.",1235088000,,792,4.2052980132450335

I will say that if you have weak or bad knees this workout is probably not for you as even the Level 1 workout with Bob consists of alot of lunges.  I love this workout though.. I followed the maximum results guide on the dvd and started with Level one the first 2 weeks and added levels 2 and 3 in 2 week intervals.. Have been doing all three levels plus the warm up 4 days a week and it definitely works! Combining this with healthy eating (lots of fruit, veggies and smaller portions!) I have lost 15 pounds in a little over 2 months.. Started at 150 pounds and now down to 135.. It works you just have to be consistent and stick it out! I have been raving and recommending this dvd to all of my friends... Get it!",1235088000,2,824,4.15

Let me say this, level one (20 mins) just kicked my butt!! I was sweating and could feel every muscle in my body being worked! This was without even using the weights (which I did not know this video incorporated).

I am beyond satisfied with this workout DVD and can only imagine what level 2 and 3 are going to bring. I will definately be purchasing more biggest loser DVD's!!",1234828800,,620,4.245762711864407

I didn't think I was completely out of shape as I have been working out consistently since January, four times a week at least, jogging and Pilates. I felt my work out regime needed a boost so I bought this DVD based on all of the good reviews I read here on Aamazon. Those reviews were not kidding. I did my first work out on Saturday and my muscles were still sore this morning (Tuesday). Bob does get a bit annoying once in awhile and I think he just might be a sadomasochist, but he really makes me sweat and curse and sweat and curse. I recommend this. I am on the maximum results program so I let them do the choosing for me. I can't wait to see the results in my body.",1234828800,,705,4.00709219858156

It is easy to follow and the instructors know their audience may be new to the workout and let you know to slow down if you need to do so. ""Just keep moving!"" is what you will hear. If you follow the suggested workout plan, it does help. You can wait longer than 2 weeks, though, to move onto the next level. Give yourself time. I have taken aerobics before, so I figured this might be high intensity from the beginning, but it is graduated. You don't need a step or weights. Weights are great if you have them, but not necessary.",1234137600,,597,4.292035398230088
2968147,5,B000WEVGHA,"This is by far one of the best cardio workouts I have tried. I am 112 pounds and so I don't have much weight to lose, but I barely could keep up with them. So If you have a nice amount of weight to lose I am sure this will be very challenging. I was almost stunned when I was at the end and they said ""Ok, you just finished Level 1"" I thought for sure I had done all the levels by then because it was that challenging for a cardio workout.  A+  Loved it.",1234137600,,454,3.71875
2968148,1,B000WEVGHA,"the ""warmup"" bothered me to the point that i didn't even get to the actual workout.  beware, all the jumping around as a warmup can hurt you...i go from complete slug to workout fiend, and i have tried many types of workout dvds.  what really bugs is how the trainer is so busy bouncing you around that you don't have a chance to do the proper forms and alignments.  if you are already in shape, it isn't too bad, but for a beginner you may find yourself flailing about and may fall.  typically the instructor gives you a clear explanation on form and its importance, in this dvd you just go, and if you don't have a strong sense of balance you will find yourself jerking around trying to not fall on your face.  if you want quick results and a flatter belly immediately post workout try the Lotte Berk Method series, the ""Basic Essentials"" one is perfect.  the Crunch series are pretty good as well, especially the ones with Ellen Bartlet, Super Slim Down Pilates....i get bored easily so i love to try new dvds...this one blows, i always go back to the Lotte Berk and Crunch dvds to really tone up and challenge my muscles.",1233964800,17,1125,4.4106280193236715
2968149,3,B000WEVGHA,"Level 1 by far has the longest routine and it is about intermediate level, but it does not contain enough cardio moves to get your heart rate up.  Personally I found Bob Harper spent too much time trying to impress with his social skills and not enough time in giving instructions on proper forms and techniques.  I found his conversation annoying and I'm glad I have the option to tune him out with the selection of ""music only"".  Out of all 3 levels, the best one by far is level 2, instructed by Jillian Michael, she means business and her routine can really make you sweat. The only complaint I have is that it's only 10 minutes, which is way too short. As for level 3, the instructor does not provide enough variation of moves and I found the routine very unimpressive.  To get my money worth, however, in the future I think I will combine Level 2 and Level 3 to be used as one workout routine.",1233792000,,899,4.333333333333333

Nice that the video could be customized to your level.  You can choose how many and which workout session you want to do in the menu.  Nice to see ""real"" people in the background with the instructor (past Biggest Loser contestants).  Very intense workout.  You will be sweating and your legs will be trembling.

I quickly realized just what I have been missing from my regular routine. This dvd will challenge even the most seasoned workout gurus. You really get a full range workout and work up a good sweat. The one feature I like most is that the instruction is clear and concise. They are not all over the place making it difficult to follow. Very easy to follow. And yes you will be sore the next day, it is a guarantee. I am very pleased with this workout. Very good purchase.",1233619200,,730,4.006849315068493

I know there have been some comments noting the others are off sync, but I think there is nothing wrong with that-- They note as long as you are trying and moving that is all that matters, everyone is going to move at their own pace.rate so its more realistic that they are not in sync.

I will admit, it may be tiring if you first try this and are not in excellent shape, but its worth it because the more you do it, the better off you will feel.

I must say though that I agree with those that said that this is way too tough for people that are overweight and/or completely untrained. For those, the first Biggest Loser workout DVD is a lot more manageable, so master that one first and then move on to this one. Lindsay Brin's Moms into fitness boot camp DVDs are also excellent and combine cardio with strength training, even for those who are not moms.",1232150400,2,650,4.336065573770492

2968166,5,B000WEVGHA,"This dvd has three great workouts to choose from. Each one will get your heart rate up quickly. Bob's 20 minute workout uses some weights (if you choose--there's also the option to not use weights). His workout is my favorite as it is longer than the other two and more challenging overall because of the weight use.
Jillian's workout is good, but I actually think Bob's is harder. Maybe it's because of the length? Jillian's workout is 10 minutes, and you will find yourself doing jumping jacks and a few higher impact exercises along with punches and uppercuts.
Kim's workout is also 10 minutes and incorporates some kickboxing. I feel like the first 5 minutes of hers is fairly easy as you will be doing bob and weave with some punches for half of that time. Around the 5 minute mark, the exercises will definitely get your heart pumping though!

However, for a beginning level, I think the first workout has too much emphasis on lunge and knee bend movements. If you have sensitive knees, I'd pick another workout video. And, I thought this was going to be a workout for beginners where the Biggest Loser participants were still heavy -- but no, they have lost almost all of their weight and have been conditioning for a while, so it really isn't beginning at all. I didn't feel like I could relate to the people in the video like I thought I would. Also, this one is shot inside an aerobics room -- so it's not as pleasing as one shot on a beach or in the mountains. The workout will keep your heart rate up, but I don't think they picked a good workout to make into a video -- there are some small slip ups in instruction from Bob in this one. Overall, Bob did a good job, but I didn't feel like the video was top quality -- it seemed like the makers of the video didn't care to film a few workouts and pick the one that was the best or had the fewest slip ups to make into a marketed video.",1231459200,7,1130,4.117647058823529

I work out on a regular basis with the treadmill and doing some kickboxing, but never really got anything out of the workouts. When I got this dvd I just wanted a change of pace and didn't really figure it would be any different than the other 50 videos I had already. The first night I did this workout it kicked my butt. I'm excited about this workout and I'm going to share my find with all my workout buddies. I can see why these guys have such great success on the tv show. The workout is not just for the advanced exerciser either which is great. It is set for you to work at your own pace with your own intensity level and the moves don't really seem difficult. The best part is the option to pick and chose which workout segment you want to do. Makes it great for the beginner to start out slow and work your way up. I love this dvd and I may even buy more of their dvds.",1231286400,3,971,4.036269430051814

Bob is very motivating and makes the workout fun. I'm still on level one after a week and will stay there until I can master it...and I haven't even started using the weights yet.

The workouts are awesome and you know for sure that you've done something good for yourself once you're done! One tip is to make sure you buy some hand weights for this dvd.

He really likes to do side-to-side moves while reaching to your shins/toes.  My advice is to really listen to his instructions and keep your abs in tight because if you don't (like I didn't the first time) your back will be really sore for a couple days and that's a bit scary.  I did go back and do it again, keeping my abs in tight, and the back pain never happened.  So just be a good listener as he instructs you how to do the moves.

Great instruction on how to do the moves correctly so you get the best results...a must for your dvd library.

I always feel as though I've just paid a thousand bucks to get the top trainers to train me in my own livingroom when I turn this on. It's easy to see how these trainers were handpicked to become so well known...their cueing and instruction is just the top of the line. Their motivation is fabulous.

2968185,4,B000WEVGHA,"I love The Biggest Loser show, and like most people struggling with weight loss, I wish I could be on the show. The BL workout videos give you as close of an experience at the Ranch and working out with the trainers as you can get without being there.
Cardio Max is amazing. There are three levels of intensity, allowing you to workout with Bob, Jillian and Kim. The workouts themselves are not boring, they keep you moving and most importantly, keep that heartrate up! If you are completely new to working out, this may be a shock to your system. In that case, I'd recommend starting with the first BL video (all workouts with Bob and the contestants from the first couple seasons), then moving up to the Cardio Max workouts. If you are ready for a bit more for your workout, these workouts won't disappoint. And, working out with the contestants really is fun. These people are just like you and me, and aren't just some skinny fitness experts. They struggle through and sweat just like you will.

I think most can agree that with Jillian it's been a process, her videos have solid content to get you in shape but lack the motivation to get you there. This can be said for Jillian Michaels for Beginners - Frontside/Backside (2-Disc DVD Set) I found it to be plain. Basically if you're a beginner and you want a fun and exciting exercise DVD don't go with any of the Biggest Loser. These trainers lack the ""know how""(on how to make a fitness video) and the charisma to motivate you, if your just beginning go with other videos made by trainer who have been around a while like: Kathy Smith, Tamilee Webb and Denise Austin.

I think this is a wonderful DVD for all fitness levels.  Since I typically exercise 5 days a week to other workout DVDs (sometimes incorporating the other 2 Biggest Loser DVDs), I just opted to do the entire workout from warmup to cooldown incorporating all 3 cardio levels in between.

I am 23 years old and bought this dvd for me and my mom to get into shape.  Since we are on such different physical levels, normally we can't work out together.  However, this dvd allows us to work out together by including all different levels in the dvd!  Also, I am a huge fan of Bob from the biggest loser, but after this dvd, I love him even more.

Or you can choose another combination for it to go up to an hour.

We have each lost over 10 pounds in the past 6 weeks, and if anything, we have increased what we eat.  We were just not going to the gym (out of laziness and time constraints) we needed something easy that we could do at any hour of the day.

2968200,5,B000WEVGHA,"I really like this DVD. I'm 31 and weighed 291 lbs. when I started it. When I first started doing it I could only do the 5 mins. warm up and I was already sweating. The next day I did 5 mins. warm up and 10 mins. of the actual level 1. I stopped when Bob started doing the push ups. The 3rd day I only did 8 mins. worth. However, the 4th day I felt guilty for not giving it a decent chance and pushed myself to do the entire level 1. Level 1 is tough, but if I did it being 5'2 291 lbs. then anyone should be able to do it. I mean seriously! I personally don't like doing push ups so when they all hit the ground I do something else, but still keep working out. I still haven't gotten to level 2 or 3 and probably won't for a while. I'm taking it slow. I just recently started using dumbbells for more of a cardio workout like they suggest. All in all, I've been using it for 1 month straight with weekends off and now I'm weighing in at 278.2 lbs. I've been eating healthy and not starving myself. Those 30 mins. of work out have really helped. I do the 5 mins. warm up, then the 20 mins. cardio and lastly the 5 mins. cool down.

But, if you have 40 minutes, it also allows for a longer workout. I would recommend it for both beginners and for those who have been working out and are looking for a DVD that will allow you to get in an intense workout when time is an issue.",1220227200,,409,4.125
2968203,3,B000WEVGHA,"Bob's workout is by far the best of the three, as it is short enough to get it out of the way, yet long enough to get results if done consistently.  Good variety of exercises, and you could use this as a strength/cardio component to add to a Callanetics or yoga workout.

What I didn't like about this workout:

Few form pointers:  Bob briefly performs each exercise, and mentions form pointers, but out of all the exercisers, only 1 or 2 are even approaching proper form, which is not good as the camera is usually focused on the others who are nowhere near it.

No indication of the correct pace or cadence at which to perform the exercises when you do get up to speed--it is very easy to overwork one side at the expense of the other. He seems to be working in 30-second segments at times, but not all the time. He also counts backwards, which is fine except you don't know where you're starting from.

If you have knee problems and/or are in similar physical condition to the BL contestants on the DVD you will want to modify the movements somewhat. There are a lot of squats, knee bends and some jumping.

The other two workouts with Jillian and Kim have the same problems with lack of proper form pointers and a lot of squats and knee bends, and some jumping. They are only 10 minutes each, so it may or may not be an issue for some people. Bob's workout uses light weights, the other two do not. You can do most of the workouts on carpet if you have to, but be careful.

The cool down did not have nearly enough stretching in it to be worth doing.

When they come out with the next DVD they need to have a short section where Bob demonstrates proper form (both from the front and the side), include some exercises which can get your heart rate up without being so hard on the knees, and put more actual stretching into the cool down.

Some people don't like that the people aren't in sync or that there is kind of a lack musical beat, but I love that fact because you can slow down and speed up to meet your bodies needs.  The workout is harder if you work harder.  But coming from child birth I found I still got a good workout following it at a slower pace.  The workouts can range from 20 to 50 minutes depending on what you have time for (or what your kids have time for).  I really love this workout.",1219622400,,638,4.023809523809524

Not only does Bob, Jillian and Kim make me sweat...I could feel every muscle being worked after the first workout with Bob on level 1.

Most of the time when watching a workout dvd everyone is fit and personally does nothing for me.  They are not feeling the strain that I am...so it makes me ask myself, why is it so hard for me?

No boring and stale background with a soothing voice talking you through the steps or an overly peppy woman in a skin tight leotard bouncing around telling you that ""You can do it!"". Most of us who buy these videos are overweight and while I can appreciate an athletic person, it's hard to really get into a group of perfectly fit people who appear to be aerobic instructors. I like the ""real"" feel of the Biggest Loser crew and seeing Bob in just a shirt and shorts. It's also refreshing to see part of his crew who are out of sync because usually I am! Bob's continuous talking through the moves about how to make them harder (or easier) is also of great benefit - you can step it up if you're up to it and if you're dying, you can tone it down for a second without stopping.

Definitely NOT easy.  I do enjoy this video for several reasons.  First, they do offer lower impact options for each movement, which is nice if I seem to be lacking in energy on a perticular day.  Second, I get to work out with people who are struggling the same way I am with the routines (breathing heavy, losing balance, etc.).
The only thing that I was disappointed with was the fact that Bob doesn't actually do the workout with you.  He gives you instructions and pointers but seems to just walk around and observe.  I'd prefer to see him working out as well.

Not only can you follow their program for maximum results in 6 weeks, but you can also mix and match the various segments to your liking.  I've found success with this video and the companion video.  After two weeks I noticed muscle tone in my legs, abs and arms.  The trainers are motivational without being sicky sweet or annoying after watching them for 6 weeks straight.  I've loved this video and think you will too!",1216080000,,461,4.573170731707317

2968219,5,B000WEVGHA,"I really enjoyed this dvd. I love the ability to customize the workout. You do the 5 min. warm up, then you can do level 1 cardio with Bob which lasts for 20 min. or level 2 with Jillian which is 10 min or level 3 with Kim which is also 10 min. and then the 5 min cool down. I thought that the level 2 workout was actually a little more challenging than level 3 but thats just me. You can gradually build up to doing all 3 levels at one time or break them up so they fit your fitness level or time constraints. It gets your heart going and you will sweat no matter how you break it down.",1215129600,2,587,3.819672131147541
2968220,4,B000WEVGHA,"I love the people in the background. I like the style of the leading, not so much choreography to keep up with as with some cardio DVD's. You see the people in the background going at their own pace,and everyone is still sweating. You can move slower or faster if you want to, and you really feel like you are controlling your own workout. The first workout is very challenging, and the hardest one is probably level 2. To do the first two is to get a really solid work out in- the third workout is not level three challenge- wise, but it is an extra ten minutes tacked on when you already are feeling pretty exhausted. I would reccomend doing the first two workouts, and then  half an hour of strength training from some other DVD to really balance it out.",1215129600,,757,4.330985915492958
2968221,5,B000WEVGHA,"You guys. For real. This DVD is GREAT. Like many of the other reviewers I am in very good shape (cardio/yoga/Turbo Jam 5xs/wk). I was excited to try this and I was not disappointed. Bob's section is DEFINITELY the most challenging and not just for the length (20 mins). It will kill you the next day but stick with it! Jillian's section (10 mins) is good too and Kim's (10 mins) is the simplest. I actually incorporate some Turbo Jam moves into her kickboxing routine to maximize my results.

How they've structured the DVD is that Bob is easiest, then Jillian, then Kim. But it should be the opposite. So for someone starting out maybe they'd be more comfortable doing Kim, Jill, then Bob. I did all three the first time and lordy was I glad to get to Kim's easier section!

You will NOT be disappointed with this DVD. IT ROCKS!!!!",1214956800,,832,4.467105263157895

The trainers are very motivating and the Biggest Loser cast works out with the trainers, too, so it's quite inspiring.  I bought this DVD because I wanted a good cardio workout and trust me, it's one of th best I own and I work out with it every other day and it's still challenging.  I recommend this product to anyone just wanting to get their program jump-started and to work off those extra pounds.

You can also do 2 or all three workouts in a row. You just get so many options this way. My family loves it along with the Power Sculpt that works the same way. Bob's workout seems the hardest but most motivating. We will do all 3 workouts when were feeling strong and need the extra calorie burn.

We own all the Biggest Looser dvds and they are all good workouts, just in different ways. It's great to have alot to mix and match. But I'd have to say, if you just starting your collection. This one and the Power Sculpt will be a good choice. You'll really melt the fat! If your fitness level is very low, start with The Biggest Looser Workout Vol. 1.

I am yet to try level 3. I like that Level 1 works my thighs and buns like nothing else and I like the variety as the exercises change every 10-20 seconds.

The workouts together are pretty solid.  I feel that Level 1 is the only that could stand alone as a good heart pumpin interval workout; and even better when paired with Level 2. The last installment, the boxing one, was kinda weak, even as a cool down set.
Overall, a great low impact workout, especially for those who are just starting out, whether for the first time or after a long hiatus.  If you exercise regularly and have for many years, I cannot recommend this one.",1212019200,,703,4.608

As other reviewers have noted, I found the Level 1 to be a pretty good workout. One of the participants uses low impact techniques while others do some higher impact work so you can customize the workout somewhat by choosing who to follow.

2968241,4,B000WEVGHA,"I love this DVD!!! Let me first say I am not by any means excessively overweight (I am 5'2 and 146lbs). I used to be 120lbs until I had my son and I never lost the weight. Im tired of being big so I bought the dvd thinking that if these people are over weight then this would be a good pace for me.
  I like that the people in the videos are people from the past seasons. One thing I hate seeing in a workout video is people who are already in shape. They make me fee like I wil never get to where they are. Seeing the sturggle that these people have gone through give me assurance that I can do this too. I also like the way that it breaks it down in to seperate weeks. Also no one is ever together in the workout and the instructor is really funny.
  The only thing I think is negative about the video is, as I said I am not too terribly big but I am out of shape. These people on the dvd may be bigger but since they were on the show they are in better shape than I am and when you pick up the dvd your thinking it will start you out with baby steps.... DON'T think that because you are wrong!!! Even the first weeks exercises are brutal, I poured sweat and had to take a couple breaks to shake off the muscle burn.

Now I mix it up and do 2 of the levels, but I'm about to start the PowerSculpt DVD.",1210809600,,370,3.6125
2968244,4,B000WEVGHA,"I am a little over weight for my height and hate going to the gym. I was told I needed to exercise daily... and OH I hate working out...

I bought the dvd and tried it. It's been 3 weeks and I think the difference I see is endurance. I could not keep up for the life of me when I started. I basically did the warm up, straight to the cool down. (You can laugh but I am weak!) Little by little I was able to follow with the program and I like that you can add the level as you go. I am still at level 2... I am actually trying to keep up at that level.

I think this dvd would be perfect if you want to work out at home. The first level is very hard but just work at it everyday and you'll see a difference.

The only thing I don't like is that there is no stretching exercises and if I don't stretch on my own, my muscles tense up. Also I with there was a  longer cool down... it doenst feel good when the cool down starts right after a very intense work out.",1210550400,2,959,3.756218905472637
2968245,4,B000WEVGHA,"I think several of the excellent reviews have established that this is definitely a challenging workout even for those of us who think that we are in relatively good shape. I think this is a great workout if you've hit a plateau--it's definitely helping me and inspite of the negatives I'm going to list, I still am using it because the positives definitely outweigh the negatives. You will feel parts of your glutes and quads for several days!!
The reasons I didn't give it 5-stars are as follows.
Cardio level 1: Bob is great with the routines--they are definitely challenging.  Just like the previous Biggest Loser workout, there's no sense of 'being in sinc'--I just choose my pace and stick with it because nobody keeps up with the music--not that the music is much to begin with.  I am also used to the 'mirror image' concept, i.e, when the trainer says got to your right they are actually going to their left so both the viewer and participants are going in the same direction.  Not so here--you have to pay attention if you want to stay somewhat syncronized.
Level 2:  Jillian is quite relentless and you get no breaks for 10 solid minutes. No major problems here.
Level 3:  This is the disappointing one. As noted in other reviews, it's not harder than the other two levels--I am honestly a little grateful for that because I don't think I could do it if it was harder--after the first two levels, my legs are protesting big time.  It does get a little hard towards the end.  I found Kim irritating.  She appears unnaturally happy.  I counted 6-8 times that she repeated, 'This is your cardio session/workout'--it gets very annoying.  I am a big Turbo Jam fan so I found the kickboxing routines somewhat awkward at times.  In one of the routines, you have to watch your knees if you are on carpet otherwise you could twist them causing injury.
All in all, definitely worth buying.",1210550400,31,1889,4.625748502994012
2968246,5,B000WEVGHA,"I have always been disappointed with workout videos, and I love this one.  It's a great workout, and I love that it packs a lot of cardio into a short amount of time.  Bob is great and I am seeing results.",1210204800,,205,3.975609756097561
2968247,5,B000WEVGHA,"I absolutely love this video!  I've used MANY workout DVDs and this is the first one that really kicks my butt.  I alternate this video with the Power Sculpting one, and I've lost 10 lbs and lots of inches in two months.  I feel fantastic!  Every time I put it in the DVD player I know that I am going to get a great sweat going.  Plus, the DVD gives you something to work up to, so don't feel bad if you can't do the all of the moves or levels at first.  I couldn't either, but I'm getting there now!

Bob's section is level 1, and make sure you have at least a pair of 5 lb weights for this.  It involves a lot of squats and push-ups and jumping.  Jillian has level 2 which was incredibly difficult for me to do after level 1 at first.  It's basically 10minutes of plyometrics, or jumping exercises.  The third section by Lyons is kickboxing.  I personally don't think it should be level three, it isn't as difficult as the other ones, but it is somewhat difficult after doing the first two levels beforehand.

You can also customize you workout.  So you can choose to do Level 1, skip Level 2, and do Level 3. Also on the DVD are inspiration stories from the Biggest Loser cast, which workout in the DVD. I loved that they were the ones working out and not some stick thin actors.  They were sweating and grunting right along with me! :)

2968255,5,B000WEVGHA,"I ordered this expecting it would kick my butt and I have not been disappointed!  I have yet to make it all the way through level one and it is very hard!  For those reviewers who say it's not for beginners, I would say ""You're right, if you're a beginner who has never seen the show and have no idea what to expect!"". This video is cake compared to what those folks on the show go through.  You will hurt, you will sweat, you might even swear, but you will see results if you keep with it!  I am not discouraged that I can't make it through Bob's level one because he is constantly reminding me that I am doing my best.  I appreciate that I am not the only one struggling as I watch the real people in the background sweating and huffing and puffing.  While it can be a tad distracting that they have problems with timing, I find it a comforting reminder that they are not toothpick skinny Barbies and have really struggled to get where they are. They are giving 110%.  I can't say this is a FUN workout, but is effective and I am proud of myself when I collapse on the floor in a puddle of sweat because I have gotten just a little farther than I did last time and blasted some nasty fat!
I really like that you can customize your workout, though Kim's 10 minute cardio left me cold when I previewed this.  I don't care for her personality, but that's just me.  I like that you can add levels as you work up to them and don't have to try for it all at once.  There is even a maximum results feature that tells you about how many weeks into the program to add the next level.  I am one of those who can do the same thing forever, even if I am no longer getting any benefit, just because I'm finally comfortable with the moves, so this is great for me!  A reminder that it may be time to move on.
Bob does level one and he is great, very motivating and always free with encouragement.
Jill is your level two instructor and she's a bit rougher on you.  She is encouraging, but also quick to tell you to get your rear in gear.  If you've ever seen the show, she is much nicer here!
Kim is level three and, as I've stated above, she leaves me a bit cold.  Her workout flies by, and may be the most fun of the three, but she's a bit perky and artificial for me.  Sorry Kim!  Again, that's just me.
Bob's yoga cool down is wonderful, though I would love more there.  You work yourself silly no matter how much you do, then the cool down doesn't quite stretch and relax enough.
All in all, a great DVD for the price, I highly reccomend this if you have any clue about the show and know what to expect!",1208476800,2,2595,4.0848126232741615

I loved it though.  And even if you are a beginner exerciser, don't despair. The tape is so encouraging and motivating and the actual movements are very easy to follow so you just can do what you can and slowly build up endurance.

A great video mixing cardio and muscle toning. Bob's section (the bulk of the workout at 20 min) is the MOST intense. Jillian's 10 min segment is not a breeze either. Kim's 10 min of cardio kickboxing is the easiest though if you do that section last, it's still hard! GREAT DVD",1208390400,,670,4.21875

I was in a small apartment when I first started using this &  unlike other DVD's-space  was not a problem. This moves were choreographed away from walls and furniture - a refreshing bonus!

I can now do the whole 30 minute level 1 work out. Next week I am going to be adding level 2. In only 2 1/2 weeks I have lost 14 inches and 12 lbs. Now I still have 80 to go, but it is a good start. Bob does the level 1, and he keeps me motivated thru the whole work out. Right when I think I am about to die, he starts counting down, and tells me I can do it, and I believe him. Rather than sitting on my couch hoping the Biggest Loser comes and casts me, I decided that the more logical option would be to bring the biggest loser trainers to me. I would recommend this to everyone, from those who only have 10 lbs to lose to people like me who have 50+.",1207612800,312,833,3.659217877094972
2968262,5,B000WEVGHA,"A little background; I've been working out religiously since the second week of Jan 08 combining 3 days of cardio with 3 days of circuit training with weights.  My cardio consisted of 30 min of interval training on my elliptical and 30 min on my bike.  Weights are a total body workout with dumbbells.  With a combination of working out and eating right, I've managed to drop 15lbs but just recently I've noticed I hit a plateau.  I was talking to my sister about my recent stall in weight loss so she let me borrow the Cardio Max DVD to give me a change of pace.

Last Friday, I pop the DVD in, strap on my heart rate monitor (because I wanted to make sure I was working out intense enough) and arrogantly decide to jump into the the ""Week 2-4"" intensity level (which is Level 1 and 2).  I think I was about 10 minutes into the Level 1 workout with Bob and I was dying.  My heart rate was reaching 170 bpm and my legs were burning; and I wasn't using any weights!!  After the warmup and Level 1 I had to quit.  I woke up the next morning and my legs, hind end and abs were sore!  It was great!

This is a great workout but will require someone new to the world of fitness to work up to fully being able to complete the levels (which is the whole point).  The DVD is mapped out for a 6-8 week timeline.  The instructors make it very clear if you can't keep up, then somehow move to keep your heart rate up and join back in when you're comfortable.  There's one specific girl in the video (sorry don't know names) that does an alternative version of the exercise for someone less athletic (i.e. push-ups on your knees, fake jump rope, no weights).  Trust me, if you keep up with this DVD you will see results and feel better!",1207526400,30,1724,4.181818181818182

2968267,5,B000WEVGHA,"I have never seen the TV show and I'm not overweight.  I lift three times a week here at home and since I canceled my gym membership I haven't been doing any cardio (I used to use the elliptical machine for that).  I hate cardio and since I'm pretty lean to begin with, I didn't mind dropping it from my routine.  But then I noticed a teeny bit of a spare tire beginning to form which freaked me out so I figured I better buck up and find a cardio workout.  I didn't want to have to get all kinds of new equipment and I didn't want an overly-perky, irritating instructor barking orders at me.  I went through a couple of other DVD's (which sucked) before reading the reviews here and since they were generally all very positive reviews, I decided to give it a go.

I have not been disappointed so far.  The exercises are simple to learn but are also extremely challenging.  Bob's warm up and level one workouts really get me sweating.  Even though one of the cast members demonstrates a low-impact version of the workouts, I would definitely not recommend this for complete novices.  You should already be familiar with your body and what it can take.

The other two workouts might not seem that challenging by themselves, but all three are supposed to be performed in a row (eventually).  You start with the warm up and level one workout, then add level two, and finally level three.  There is also a cool-down workout so in the end you'll be doing five workouts in a row for a total of about 50 minutes.  That's a tough workout!  I'm only on level one and I can't wait to get through the whole thing.

The instructors are fairly tolerable and not over-the-top Barbie dolls, but I find that the cast members make the workouts more fun.  Being a pretty cynical kind of guy, I was ready to ""make fun of the fatties"", but they're clearly having such a good time and I can really appreciate that they've done something to get themselves into shape without slavishly trying to become ""skinny"".  A section called ""Inspirational Stories"" showcases some of their success stories from the show and their journeys are quite impressive.  So I liked that rather than robotic fitness clones, there were some real people with different body types and goals all there having fun and working up a sweat along with you and sometimes goofing or falling behind.  It lets you know that this isn't a choreography lesson, it's a workout, and that it's more important to keep your heart rate going than worry about staying in lockstep with everyone else.

The coolest thing about the DVD is that you can design your own workouts.  You can select the pre-set workouts for weeks 1-2, 3-4 and 5-6 that take all the guesswork out and play the workouts in the appropriate order.  But you can also create your own workout kind of like a video jukebox.  If you have your own warm up routine and want to skip the one on the DVD, you can, then select level one, or levels two and three together, or levels one and three, etc.  This makes it very flexible and keeps you from getting too bored with the same workout.  I do yoga after cardio, so I generally skip Bob's cool-down workout.  At some point I might want to replace the level one workout and do level two twice, plus the warmup.

You can also play the workouts with or without the instructor's voice track and have just the music, which leads me to my one quibble...  the music is NOT very energetic.  It's got a tempo you can use to keep time, but it's just ""dramatic"" instrumental reality show music, not really something to get you moving.  I prefer high-energy dance music or at least something fun that I know the words to, but this is easily fixed since I just turn down the video volume and play my own cardio playlist on itunes.  But still, I think a good cardio workout should have some high energy music behind it.

I haven't given it five stars because of the music and because I'm too new at it to see if it really yield results, but if my first two weeks are any indication, I'm sure it will work great and I'll be back soon to change the rating.",1207180800,2,4086,4.427041499330656

I love how quickly the workout goes by and the ability to change the levels for your workout. I hate doing cardio and this is so much fun and much better than being stuck on a treadmill - with the same results - getting your heart rate pumping! I also love the yoga cooldown because I am a yoga fantatic. This boot camp style workout is fast paced and hardcore! It does not bother me that it is not in sync like the other people mentioned - I am hardly coordinated myself! You can follow the different people for modified versions of the workout.

2968274,4,B000WEVGHA,"This is a great DVD for those of us who need an effective workout in a hurry.  I love the fact that I can customize the program to fit my needs.  Most days I play Bob's 5-minute warm-up and Jillian's 10-minute cardio routine.  On really busy days when the kids just won't leave me alone I'll just do the 10-minutes of cardio.  If I have more time I can do Bob's 20-minute level I, which is not as easy as one might think!

This DVD takes away any excuse I have to skip exercise.  Surely I can find 10 minutes to work out.  Heck, even the 5-minute warm-up would do me good if I were that crunched for time.  There may be better workouts available, but if they are 40+ minutes long, I know I will NEVER do them.

I agree with previous posters that Kim's ""Level III"" workout is probably the easiest one on the disc.  My heart rate goes higher and stays higher during both Bob's and Jillian's workouts than this one...even when I push myself to expend maximum effort.  I use her segment for days when I don't feel well and am not up to jumping around and getting out of breath.

Unfortunately my brand-new disc was damaged and I am unable to view the cool down or the ""Inspiring Stories"".  I just kept it because of the cost and inconvenience associated with exchanging it.",1206057600,,1269,4.281512605042017

i was pretty out of shape before jump starting my exercise routine with this dvd, and it's definitely helped me feel better about myself, i'm definitely more toned already than i was almost two months ago (but i'm no jillian yet!), and i just recently combined this workout with the power sculpt dvd (which i really love as well!)

i'd agree with some of the other reviewers, in that bob's workout (level 1), some of the exercises were definitely pretty tough for being a ""level 1"", but that was all the more reason for me to push myself to do them well, and with correct form.

For some reason, the producers of these DVDs must think that's a plus, because it's even worse here, where they're all *obviously* out of sync and all over the place. ""Do I have my arms up or down on this beat? The woman in front has her arms down, but the guy right behind has his up...' It looks sloppy and it's harder to follow than it should be.

2968295,5,B000WEVGHA,"When I bought this workout it was more for the people in it than what I thought the workout would actually contain.  I workout atleast 1.5 hours
a day , every day, and this was tough.  I realized later though, that with this workout, they don't warm up, they don't stretch beforehand, so you just jump into very intense cardio which just about killed me.

Warm up and stretch on your own before you start, this was a good buy.",1202860800,5,426,4.3
2968296,5,B000WEVGHA,"I work-out avidly using other body sculpting routines and running. I bought this DVD in conjunction with the sculpting DVD. ""Ouch, WOW!, Man is it over?"" are the only thoughts that came to mind during this work-out. I worked up quite a sweat and was out of breath after level I and level II. However, I did not find level III with Kim very challenging at all, perhaps because my other work-outs incorporate the moves already. I am sore after completing the 50 minute work-out, but I did do it back-to-back with the sculpting DVD (yesterday). Unlike the sculpting DVD, I found the instructions on this work-out to be much better. My back does not hurt after completing the routine, but weights were not used as much either (plus I only used the 5lb weights today). Bob does the level I, 20 minute work-out and he regularly reminds the participant to consider the core to prevent back injury. He is very thorough and quite tough. Of course, Julianne also kicks butt. Kim was all right, but I am not a huge fan of hers anyways. I do feel the warm up is intense, but the cool down using Yoga feels great after the work-out. I like the ability to select the order and levels to include for your work-out (I did maintenance). I do recommend this work-out DVD for all levels. The trainers do indicate how to keep the intensity lower if you are not in great shape. All you have to do is watch Julie during the work-out and follow her. It is important to remember that if it was not difficult, then there would not be a benefit to doing it. I purchased these work-out DVDs to help mix up my rountines a bit, since I think my body has become stagnant at the moment. It is an awesome work-out that you should give a try, only if you are really serious.",1202601600,4,1741,4.3765432098765435

After reading all the reviews, I also thought it would be really intense and would give me a good workout.  I was disappionted.  First of all, there are WAY too many strength moves.  Too many squats and Bob has you using weights.  I wanted cardio, not strength.  Secondly, I don't think that it gets your heartrate up enough.  As someone who runs several times a week, I was barely breathing hard.  Out of all the workouts, Jillian's is probably the best in this DVD for doing what is advertises-Cardio and Max.  If you are new to exercising or looking for a challenge from your moderate workouts, this is probably for you.

If you are a beginner though, you may want to skip the light weights that several people are using, and modify some of the movements. Bob is really good at cueing you though and encouraging you to just keep moving. Jillian leads level 2 and in her usual style really keeps it ramped up, but still fun. I haven't done level 3 yet even though I work out often, because I want to really have the first 2 levels down first. Very challenging, fun workout.

What I love about this...  You have options and control.  I am in shape and this thing gave me a run for my money.  I LOVE this DVD.  It is so great because you actually get multiple workouts in one DVD - more value for the $.

My usual criticism of other workout DVD's is they jump right in with poor instruction and move way too fast to even learn the routine.  You won't get that here.  The moves are ""reasonable"" and it is easy to follow the instruction.  Great camera work.

Another gripe of mine about other workout DVD's is poor cueing.  All of the workouts here are WELL cued.  You won't find your head spinning wondering how you missed the switch to a new move.

They do a great job of having real people with real weight loss needs actually doing the workout.  This also does a very nice job of keeping you motivated to start and finish it.  I actually look forward to doing this video.

Finally, each work out can easily be modified to decrease or increase the intensity.  You can choose to use hand weights or not.  You can also increase the strength training this offers by increasing the weight you use.  For this reason I think that this ""aerobic fat burn workout"" could easily give you some good strength training as well.",1201478400,4,1354,4.34

The whole level one workout (which includes warm-up, cardio, and yoga cool down) is about 40 minutes. Just the cardio part is 25 minutes. You can choose to do it without trainer instruction and just music, but the one down side is that the  music is AWFUL! But if you use your mp3 player or play your own music it doesn't really matter anyway. Overall I love this dvd. I will be using it for a very long time!",1201219200,,646,4.007751937984496

Over this past summer I was able to lose my pregnancy weight (60 lbs) in part by doing the Biggest Loser Workout - Vol 1 (which I also love). So, I was excited when the new DVD workouts were released.  After having done Cardio Max several times, I would recommend this DVD only to individuals that have been exercising for a while.  If you are new to exercise, you may want to start with Biggest Loser Workout Volume 1 (lead entirely by Bob). The workouts in that DVD are very demanding but not as vigorous as the Cardio Max DVD.
  The only complaints that I have with Cardio Max is that the cueing is sometimes off and as other people have mentioned the cast is not usually in sync with one another and that can be distracting. Otherwise, I highly recommend this DVD if you have been exercising for awhile.",1201132800,,930,4.335260115606936

All I can say is: OW. The ""Level 1"" work out and even the warm up are very hard core. In fact, all I could think about was the thought of whether or not some of my friends in average shape could even do these work outs without falling over. Like someone noted earlier, there is pretty much NO warm up...it is basically an intense mini work out.

My main reason for writing this review is to warn people about the push up exercise that Bob has you do in the Level 1. Seriously?! I found that to be more for someone in the higher-end moderate to advanced level of fitness. After doing that workout, I pulled something in my chest and it hurt for a good 2 days.

The style is nice and not too cheesy, and I did like the Yoga cool down. However, for a show that caters towards helping obese people become fit, I was disappointed in what I saw as unrealistic expectations for a beginner.",1200787200,155,1144,4.2626728110599075

2968316,3,B000WEVGHA,"I was surprised by the ""warm up"" section. It's more like a mini workout! Bob has you jumping up and down immediately. I wonder, if someone was really overweight, if they could even get thru the warm up. The Level 1 workout was harder than I expected from the perspective of a tape that caters to overweight, out-of-shape people. I would hope it wouldn't turn people away from working out with this tape a second time!

I was disappointed by the cool down. I am a stretch class teacher, and would have liked to see a longer cool down, with more actual stretches rather than a standing yoga class. During the workout segment we worked our quads heavily, but didn't stretch them at all during the cool down!",1200700800,13,704,4.5

I lost and have kept off nearly 100 pounds for the past 5 years.  I am a competitive runner, enjoy workouts from The Firm, TaeBo, and Cathe F., and I also jump rope for at least 1 workout session per week.

I purchased Cardio Max to add a bit of variety to my routine over the winter months and because the contestants are so inspirational.  I was not, however, expecting such a heart pumping workout.  I enjoy that you can customize the workout into various combinations of the 3 levels.  I thought Jillian's session was the most intense.  A suggested ""hour of power"" is the Warmup, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Level 2, and then the cool down.

I could probably talk my boyfriend into trying Cardio Max with me one day.  The workout is not dancey--at all--and there are equal numbers of men and women.",1200268800,14,846,4.4

With 155 pounds to lose I am on a good start. Working out and eating correctly is the biggest key. The DVDs will not help you trim up and loose weight. You have to work out and manage your food intake as well.

On a personal note, I believe in a few months i will look back on this experience and say they (the Biggest Loser Club DVDs) saved my life. You have to get these if you want to see some at home changes in your life.",1200182400,6,856,4.213414634146342
2968321,4,B000WEVGHA,"I liked the first Biggest Loser Workout DVD. This one has a few improvements.  First the customizable option is truly customizable. If you want to do the the first 20 minute workout (lower intensity) 3 times in a row you can.  You are able to truly choose your workout level and time.
The first 20 minute aerobic section includes some strenth training (with light weights) which I like.  I don't like doing Push-ups in the middle of aerobics.  I think lowering to the ground while your heart rate is up, is detrimental.  This is easily fixed, but just doing the other moves while the TV group is on the ground.
The second and third sections are higher impact and intensity 10 minute sessions.  Again you can do these once, twice, or three times if you want.

What's also great is that you can tweak the workout easily to your own level  with weights or no weights etc. It was definatley worth the purchase.

For someone who hasn't worked out regularly for the last year, the Cardio Max DVD has been one tough workout! I have a deeper respect for the contestants who can do workouts like this all day long for three to four months.

Level 1 with Bob has been difficult enough to make me doubt whether or not I could advance to Level 2 after the first two weeks -- and this is coming from someone who likes to be challenged. I did move on to Level 2 with Jillian, and can now tell a big difference in overall strength, muscle tone, and energy. The trainers really keep your heartrate up with the use of weights and by moving quickly from one thing to the next. You don't have time to notice how hard you're breathing, but you do notice how badly your muscles burn, especially during all those lunges!",1199491200,2,903,4.311764705882353

I also love the fact that you can cater pretty much any of the moves to what you can handle. You can make it super easy or super hard, depending on how you feel. And Bob the trainer is great. I've never watched the show (Biggest Loser) but he really makes you feel comfortable and motivated regardless of your level of fitness. I haven't done the female trainers parts yet (levels 2 and 3), but just based on Bob's warmup, 20 minute level 1 cardio and yoga-stretch cool down, I give it 5 stars.",1199491200,6,606,4.278260869565218
2968325,4,B000WEVGHA,"All of the workout sections of this video are great... quick, effective, and  will always provide a challenge regardless of your fitness level.  The only negative I would add, is that the ""cool-down"" section is not much of a cool-down.  Instead, it is a mini yoga session that doesn't stretch many of the muscles used in the work-out, and which does NOT sufficiently bring your heart rate down.  Additionally, the workout sessions themselves don't include any sort of cool down.  It's work, work, work, boom, ""cool-down"" (mini-yoga) session.  I have to pause the DVD, bring my heart rate down on my own, complete the yoga cool-down, and THEN do my own cool-down/stretching.  If you are new to working out, this may be a problem if you don't know how to manage your own heart-rate, etc.

I own the first Biggest Loser workout and noticed that in this one, they make no effort to keep the participants in the background synchronized.  I'm just anal enough about a musical beat that this bugs me a bit, but fortunately, the music is non-descript enough that it doesn't really matter.  The non-descript music does allow you to fairly easily set your own pace if needed.

Last, but not least, for the ladies...  Bob's a babe, and you get to see plenty of his smiling face. :)",1199318400,11,1270,4.671171171171171

2968327,4,B000WEVGHA,"Let me preface this by saying I have lost and maintained a nearly 40lb weight loss through eating and working out.  I've completed a half marathon, run 20 miles weekly and have done numerous workout DVD's...including the original Biggest Loser DVD and even Jillian's separate workout DVD's.  I don't say this to toot my own horn, but to give you a gauge as to how someone who's in good shape views this DVD.

At least I thought I was in good shape until I popped this DVD in.  This is a crazy hard workout that will workout every fiber in your body.

Bob starts with Level 1 and gives you 20 minutes of heart pounding, lunge screaming and weight lifting cardio...at Level 1??

Jillian is next and she doesn't fail at delivering a 10 minute, high intensity level 2 cardio workout.  Like I stated earlier, I've got her whole collection of workout DVD's and this 10 minutes with her, is just as bad (good) as a few of the 20 minute DVD's I've got with her.

Bringing up the rear is Kim...and this one is a let down.  For a level 3 cardio workout, she barely breaks even with Bob's Level 1.  Now, if you do all 3 in a row like I do, then it does get a little tiring at the end with her, but if you just pop in her section for 10 minutes, I don't think you'd be pushing yourself very hard.  In my own opinion, the workout difficulty would have gone Kim, Jillian and then Bob...do those jumping lunges and tell me that's not Level 3 cardio!

All in all, this is a great workout DVD to add to your collection.  The ability to customize your workouts is great and the some of the moves are new and I've never done them before.

Start 2008 off right and lay down the cash for this.  You won't be disappointed in the workout it gives you.",1199059200,433,1728,4.2097264437689965

I love feeling like the Biggest Loser trainers are right in my own home. It's also very motivating to see the Biggest Loser contestants from this season and season's past. The trainers allow for variations in the exercises for easier to hard. Another thing I loved about it was that there were real people doing the exercises, even they screwed up once in awhile which made me feel more comfortable when I was off beat or didn't move along when everyone else did. Make sure you keep your eyes on the trainers as real people also don't always have the correct form, so you don't want to get injured. It was just nice to see the different stages different people were in also, in case there was an exercise I didn't feel comfortable with. Another plus to the DVD is that you have the option to either listen to the trainer talk through the DVD (which I listened to the first time) or you have the option to just listen to music (which I did the second time). The music was pretty motivating :) Can't wait to do this again and I'm going to get the Powersculpt DVD today to mix it up a little!

You can play any segment in any order which I like to avoid boredom, or you can choose some of the challenging premixes.  Bob leads a bootcamp segment where you can do the moves with or without weights to make it tougher if you want.  Jillian doesn't mess around with her high intensity drills.  They are tough, but stick to it for a while and it will get easier.  Then at the end, Kim does kickboxing (which really gets your heart rate up).  Some of seasons 3 and 4 are here too and they look great.
I like this workout because it's tough and yet fun and I've only done it once so far, but I'm still feeling it and can't wait to try it again because I know it will get easier and it's a definate calorie and fat burner.",1198454400,123,933,4.184357541899441

It's just a personal preference issue, which is why I didn't want to give it any lower than 3 stars. I will say I did love that Bob had people with ""real"" bodies working out with him. Considering I have 30 lbs. to lose, it served as an effective motivator to get through the workout when I saw people my size or larger going through the routine, too. Jillian, as per usual, had super-fit trainers appearing with her. I don't find that to be as inspirational.",1470873600,,592,4.440366972477064

I do pretty advanced workouts and am in pretty decent shape after losing 93lbs and after I did this workout the first time I was so sore the next day.

3202301,3,B000WEVGHA,"I just completed the entire six week of Cardio Max. I did Cardio Max 5 days a week. My thoughts on the video are as follows:

The video: I actually enjoyed this video. I did not find it to be difficult. The first time I did the video, I did not need to pause at all and I am about 60 pounds overweight. However, every single time I did the video, I was drenched in sweat shortly after starting. It is nice that one can make this video as easy or as hard as they want. Bob reminds viewers that if it's too hard, it's okay as long as you don't stop moving. I personally did not do any modified versions of the exercises, but for those who have difficulty the option is nice. But, I found it frustrating that there was little attention given to form. This is very different from Jillian videos, which explain well how to do each exercise.

Effectiveness: I am completing one video at a time and then reviewing it. I began with the 30 Day Shred, which I absolutely love. With the 30 Day Shred I lost many inches and a few pounds in just 20 minutes a day. Over the six weeks I did Cardio Max, I only lost 2 pounds,1/2 inches off my calves, 1/2 inch off my arms, and 1 inch off my waist. I do not consider the results to be good considering that I gave up soda, drank tons of water, and watched what I ate. In the past week I have went back to the 30 Day Shred, which takes half as long to do as level 3 of Cardio Max. I have lost a couple of pounds and an inch off my waist already. Also, I have much more energy and my knees stopped hurting. When I do an exercise video, I judge it mostly on results and Cardio Max does not deliver results for me. I put this video away after completing the entire 6 weeks. I doubt I will ever get it out again.

On the video, they recommend doing this video along with the power sculpt dvd, but I chose to do this video alone in order to accurately measure results. Moreover, it takes 40 minutes to complete the entire video, who has time to do another one on top of it?",1465776000,2,2000,4.0201005025125625

3202338,3,B000WEVGHA,"I was super excited about getting this DVD. I had heard a bunch of great things about this series and really needed something to get me motivated and moving. After receiving it though, I was expecting some serious cardio work out sessions, but was a bit disappointed when I finally watched the video. I had done the Jillian Michael's 30 day shred in the past and thought it may be similar, with the different levels of intensitiy, but this didn't have that like I thought. The dvd has one main workout that is 20-30 min long and it does get you moving, but I need more than just 20-30 min. They also have (2 separate) 10 min sessions that you can do by themselves or had it to the main cardio workout. Perhaps I was just expecting too much, or I should just do all of them in row to get the workout I need (which I have done) but I was thinking you'd be able to start on level one beginner for a awesome workout and then be able to build up, but that is not so on this dvd. Still a good workout and change of pace for me, just not exactly what I thought it was going to be. I liked that they had a very good warm up session about 10 min and that you could mute the trainers voice if you wanted, they get annoying sometimes.

Another good workout that involves working lower and upper body simultaneously. Light hand weights are used in this DVD, but not necessary.

3202349,3,B000WEVGHA,"This is the 1st workout DVD I ever purchased. I have had it for many years, & continue to use it once every other week. There are aspects of this workout that are great, & other parts that are not so great.

The DVD has a 5 minute warmup with Bob, then a 20 min cardio segment with light weights incorporated with Bob, next a 10 min workout with Jillian, then a 10 min segment with Kim, & lastly a 5 min cool down with Bob.

I gave this DVD 3 stars because Bob does not count down the reps or cue the next moves well. Also, if you count yourself you'll notice the Reps are not even. Bob gets a bit annoying at times, but it is not unbearable. I also find Kim slightly annoying. Jillian's workout is great & really effective. I'd like to add that her segment in this DVD is what turned me on to her solo movies, which are AMAZING!

If you do all 50 minutes of this movie with focus & good form, you'll get a great workout. While its nice they used contestants from the show, it's also unfortunate because as other reviewers have mentioned, everyone is all over the place & form is sloppy. The trick is to focus on yourself & your own form.

It Is also worth mentioning that you can customize your workout, meaning you can choose what order each segment plays & which ones you want to play.

In conclusion, this is a good beginner workout as long as your form is correct. Personally, I have moved on to bigger & better workouts, but this DVD will always be able to take some credit for starting me on my path to fitness.",1422057600,,1518,4.149659863945578

3202360,4,B000WEVGHA,"I'm a yo-yo exerciser. I get motivated, start working out, get fit and stick with it for six months to a year. Then I slack off, return to the couch, and gain fifteen pounds. Typically when I can't button my pants anymore and am faced with either losing weight or buying new clothes, I get motivated and get back on the exercise wagon. Just so you know where I'm coming from.

This workout is my 'go-to' when I need to kick my butt back in gear. It's hard, it makes me sweat buckets, and for some reason gets me back in the workout mindset.

That said, this workout is a hot mess. I love Bob Harper, and over the years I've only ever done his segments (Warm-Up & Level 1). I tried the other two levels but couldn't stand either instructor. But for those who haven't tried this workout, here's my two cents on the pros & cons:

Pros:

It's challenging. It makes me feel like I'm actually accomplishing something, and I think that's why it helps get me back in workout mode. I see results very quickly, which helps keep me motivated. But even though it's challenging, I can actually DO all of the exercises (with my own modifications when necessary).

Cons:

Oh my, there's a lot. First of all, Bob just makes it up as he goes along. It's unprofessional. The workout obviously isn't structured or planned out. My biggest problem with that is that it makes SO much of the workout unbalanced. The sets and stretches aren't always the same for both sides, which really bugs me.

Second, Bob's cueing is awful. The BL contestants are often confused as to what they're supposed to be doing, and the first few times through so was I. Bob calls a side lunge a front lunge, mixes up jumping jacks with jumping rope, and isn't consistent with his counts. After you've done the workout a few times you can correct some of this yourself and keep counts in your head as you go along, but the first few times through are highly annoying.

Third, the instruction is AWFUL. I appreciate that *real* people are doing the workout, but Bob NEVER corrects or instructs them in proper form. That means everyone is all over the map, and if you're just starting out you can easily injure yourself by following the wrong person.

Fourth, it's high impact. There is a lot of jumping, hopping, and popping up. When you combine that with the horrible form demonstrated in the video, it is very easy to get hurt. When Bob says ""jump"" I ignore him, no matter how fit I happen to be, because I have bad knees. Instead I add hand weights where he doesn't to keep the intensity up. **For those with bad knees and backs, be VERY careful with this workout.

Fifth, the cool down is NOT a real cool-down & stretch. It's a mini-yoga workout with challenging poses. I don't do yoga and I'm not very flexible, so his yoga poses are too challenging for me.

So, with all that, why do I keep coming back to this workout over and over again? Because it works. No matter what fitness level I'm at it still makes me sweat buckets. I feel it in my tush and legs the next day. I've done it so many times that I can keep my own counts and make sure it is safe and balanced - and that means I get a great workout. And there is just something about it that keeps me coming back. When I need to get back on the exercise wagon, this is always where I start.",1409356800,2,3306,4.333333333333333

3202364,1,B000WEVGHA,"I work out at home and am always trying to vary my workout DVDs so I don't get bored, so I was really excited to try this. Well, what a disappointment! First of all, Bob, the instructor, doesn't even give you cues or do a countdown so you don't even know when it's almost time to switch to another move. There is so much jumping around -  you go from being still to jumping around like crazy, which wasn't a warm up at all! You go from 0 to 100 in 10 seconds and then to 0 again, so for me, the lack of gradual increase in cardio rate to gradual decrease was HORRIBLE and I felt like I was going to pass out. I don't think it's the healthiest way for your heart to exercise. Aside from feeling like I was going to faint, all of the extras in the video were totally out of sync with the cues and all at different fitness levels from each other so it's impossible to follow along or know the proper form. They seemed like they didn't even know what to do!

I have others by Jillian, like 30 day Shred and Ripped in 30. i love the routine of this video and get great results from it (even my husband noticed the back of my legs getting more shapely). i think the others by Jillian are a little more challenging but this one is more fun. i love it so much that i was doing it daily last summer (big mistake to do the same of any exercise activity everyday cuz it doesn't give your muscles time to heal). i bought the complementary disk, Power Sculpt, that they recommend doing on alternate days as this video. It's pretty good and mainly uses combo moves and ones I haven't tried before.  i just wish there wasn't so much squatting and lunges involved in this video since i have tight hip flexors that caused problems with these repetitive movements. guess i just have to keep stretching till i can get back into this routine.",1407715200,,902,4.401197604790419

The former Biggest Losers contestants do the workouts along with the trainers, and I did not like that at all.  The contestants look lost half the time and complete the moves in a sloppy manner.  I would rather watch professionals so I know the correct form.  I never used it after the first time.",1407283200,2,459,4.290697674418604

3202372,5,B000WEVGHA,"I love this DVD. It is not for begginers who are extremely out of shape. There are a lot of different moves and even pushups/crawls, It is definitely Cardio Max.",1402444800,,161,4.4
3202373,4,B000WEVGHA,"I am a fitness DVD junkie - I have tons of Jillian Michaels' videos and several others that I try and rotate between. Upon picking my dvd for the morning, I realized that I didn't have any good cardio workouts. I had the kick boxing one from Jillian and I was less than impressed and got bored quickly so after searching Amazon, I found this gem.

I will be honest in saying I've only done it twice now, but so far, it's pretty darn good! It's not quite what I was expecting, but in some ways, I appreciate that. I like that it's not all fitness models that you will never look like with just an at home dvd being done for 30 minutes a day. I like that everyone is a different size a shape and in some areas, they're having just as hard a time as you while doing it. Bob is adorable. There have been a couple of times, where I want to shush him, but otherwise, he's a great motivator!
I finished the workouts initially thinking ""was that it?""  Granted, I was sweating and my heart was definitely up, but I am used to Jillian's sculpting workouts with weights and honestly struggling through most of her routines. That was when the light went on: I didn't struggle in the same way because I'm not doing strength. I am getting my heart rate up and having a pretty good time doing it. That's the BEST part. I also became sore quickly and realized that I was working muscles that I don't usually focus on and the best part for me was that my glutes were sore. I am trying to build a booty and the workouts that I have that say they are for legs and butt don't make my rear end sore like this, so I know it's working already!
The only downside is the last routine is just ""meh"", hence the 4 stars, but otherwise, I highly recommend this for anyone needing good cardio in their life! I will continue to buy The Biggest Loser workouts. :)",1401840000,7,1831,4.198863636363637

I always thought seriously I am just not disciplined enough or I can't do those moves or .... excuses, excuses, excuses....  Eventually I ran out of excuses and an automatic gym membership which I occasionally use.  After watching a few episodes of the Biggest Looser I was encouraged.  After trying this DVD with the Power Sculpt, I was motivated as the pounds start dropping.  I no longer have a gym membership but what I do have is a fabulous body in progress.

I only did the warmup, the first cardio segment, and the cool down.  I'd forgotten how many lunges Bob does.  I have a hard time with lunges and my knees so I tend to substitute either side lunges or squats for them.  The pace is quick, which I like.  Some others have complained about the ""all over the place"" aspect of the contestant participants but I actually find that sort of funny - it's a nice departure from the hard bodies that I have to watch when I'm using my other Jillian Michaels DVDs.

I hate to criticize a product based on it not being good for the target market - but they've made a killing on this franchise of tv shows with very obese people using their guidance. I think the assumption was warranted.
So I bought this a while back and not only couldn't even begin to get through most of the exercises. I also disregarded their coaching to push harder as I already felt like I was going to injure myself.
Since then, I have lost about 45 pounds and am active and in much better shape so I thought I'd give it another try. Turns out I don't really like the exercises and I really don't care for Jillian MIchaels. I know this is a subjective evaluation. I don't like it and you might not either. Denise Austin is a great one for beginners who need to get to moving more and Cathe Friedrich specializes in high-intensity but low impact and is awesome to work your way up to after some time with Denise.",1390089600,2,1020,4.345549738219895
3202388,5,B000WEVGHA,"I was given this dvd and started my weight loss journey on Dec 23, 2014.  I like to watch workout dvd's before I use them so I can see the basic concepts.  With my first workout I was very tired by the end of the warm-up lol but I told myself to press on. By the yoga cool down each day my core is on fire and the balance required of the yoga poses really gives me that final core burn.  This really is all cardio and boy can you feel it.  I love that they make a point to tell you to do what you can and modify as needed but to go as hard as you can.  I just started my 4th week and I am down 14 lbs. I use the dvd 5-6 times a week.  I like that I get to add another workout and change up the trainer as well as the moves.  I really like that Jillian sticks with most of the workout for level 2, it helps to see she thinks its hard too and to see the proper form.  I like how Bob has me laughing and smiling through most of the level 1.  I have not started level 3 yet but I will update here when I do.  I only use the weights 1-2 workouts a week as I get too sore to use them everyday for now.  I have already noticed my flexibility grow, my stomach is flatter, legs firmer and I am able to most all the level 1 moves now with fewer modifications and I am working on level 2.  I will most likely repeat this after the first six weeks and add the power sculpt dvd to tone up while I continue to burn fat.",1389744000,,1405,3.6778523489932886

I had no trouble following it even up to the hardest level well into my 7th month.  I had to stop only because the jumping jacks felt weird after that.",1388620800,,410,4.355263157894737

3202399,3,B000WEVGHA,"Several years ago I lost the baby weight by doing the JIllian MIchaels 30 Day Shred. It was a painful 30 days but the results were pretty decent. Since then I have moved on to Ripped in 30 and some of her other titles, LIke No More Trouble Zones, Banish Fat and Boost Metabolism and the last one which is titled Extreme something or other. I find the last 3 titles to be the most difficult. I still do a workout 4-7 days a week. I'll do one level of 30 day Shred then go for a 2-3 mile run. Or I'll do one of the more difficult workouts I mentioned without the run. So now you can imagine that I'm in somewhat decent shape. However, I always have 5-10 lbs to lose and enjoy eating so I definitely don't look like Jillian or one of her workout buddies.

I got this Cardio Max mostly because in the beginning of 30 Day Shred there's an ad for it and I became curious.

The pluses are that you can customize your workout. You can do one or all of the workouts which is great for people at different levels. At first when I read some of the reviews, I was scared so I only did the warm up and Bob's first workout. I didn't break too much of a sweat so I moved on to the last two and the cool down. At the end I didn't feel challenged enough. That was my minus. I suppose I can up the ante by using heavier weights in the first level. As others have pointed out the last workout by Kim isn't very strenuous and should be in the beginning or something like that.

Overall, I would say this is an ok workout. IT's not the most strenuous but it provided a decent cardio workout when I couldn't go for my run.",1383264000,2,1600,4.009404388714733

3202413,4,B000WEVGHA,"I received this video as a gift a couple years ago. I tried it at first, but soon it got pushed back into the lost DVDs. I pulled it out again 3 weeks ago, and have been trying to do it at least 3 x week. Let me tell you a little about myself. I'm a 35 year old female with 4 children ages 17 to 11. I'm not terribly disciplined. I work full time. I am 5'9"" and when I started this video I weighed 184 lbs. The level 1 is definitely tough when you first start out, but you will notice that that the more you do it gets easier. When I started it, I had a tough time getting through the level 1, and my muscles were quite sore. After a couple days, I decided to add 3 lb weights (I have noodle arms) and adding just that little bit, I thought I was going to die. I did it another week and even though I still found it challenging, I no longer thought that I was going to die. I will admit that I can not do the push up parts with my noodle arms, but I try. After 2 weeks, I decided to add the level 2. I made it though, but had wobbly legs at the end and was gasping for air. I've done the 2 levels together twice now, and my muscles are still sore, but not ""OH MY GOD I CAN'T MOVE SORE!"" My weight after 2.5 weeks is 179. Not too bad. I have to add that I also bought a pilates video to do in between this video, and I have tried to eat better. I will confess that in these last 2 weeks I ate some Mexican food with chips and salsa, pizza, and cake and ice cream. I also still eat cheeseburgers occasionally (just skip the fries).

3202434,3,B000WEVGHA,"I see in a lot of reviews, people mentioned that they like the use of ""real people."" While I like this in theory, I have to say - not all contestants are from current seasons and I found myself thinking, ""you've been doing this for how long?"" Also, the trainers (particularly Bob) did not keep everyone in sync or in proper form, so it felt extremely chaotic and disjointed. I sort of felt like I was witnessing a class for a new trainer who couldn't keep people together.

My biggest complaint is the form used in demonstrating exercises. Bob barely does any of the exercises and then you are left to watch everyone else stumble through their own version, and none of the trainers look like they've ever been taught to punch or kick properly.

If you can get past these annoyances, you do end up getting a decent workout that burns a respectable amount of calories.",1363737600,4,866,4.509554140127388

3202439,4,B000WEVGHA,I would consider my self in decent shape. I attend group fitness classes and weight train at the gym about 5 times a week. I have 2 young children so I can't get outside in the winter for a run or can't always make it to the gym. I started this dvd with (2nd level) weeks 3-4 and it was a decent 30min of good cardio and small amount of strength training. The week 5-6 cardio seems to be a little more intense and definitely a decent cardio workout.  I am not usually motivated by looking at the contestants of the biggest loser but after doing the work-out I do admire those overweight individuals for taking it up a notch and doing these workouts. It is a challenging fitness routine.  The instructors are motivating.,1360886400,,719,4.358208955223881
3202440,1,B000WEVGHA,"This is a total waste of time and money! I work out regularly, about 4-5 days a week and in the cold months, look for indoor workouts opposed to my preference of running.  This is a very beginner workout.  Even though the people doing the workout are sweating buckets after the warm-up, I barely dropped a bead of sweat at the end of 50 minutes.  The ""real"" people doing the workout look like uncoordinated zombies wondering why they signed up for this ridiculous workout.  The trainers seem bored, wanting everyone to look interested but seemingly throwing new steps at you like they just thought of them.  Totally unchoreographed routines.  In the level 3 workout, Kim does a bob-and-weave boxing move for 2 minutes straight without changing anything up.  All the while, the poor people doing this workout look confused, dazed and unable to keep up.  Although I love Jillian and recommend her personal workout DVD's (I have several)she looks ready to scream and make a run for it.  Gritting her teeth, she tries to encourage these poor fools who don't know what hit them. She changes up her routine after realizing they can't keep up.  The ""cool-down"" is a series of random yoga poses that Bob pulls out of nowhere.  He can't even do the ones he's asking everyone else to do, stumbling and then pretending to ""help"" others with positioning.  It was comical.  So, yeah, don't bother.  I also have The Biggest Loser Cardio Max Weight Loss which is better but you have to put up with Bob frequently doing close-ups at the camera.  I keep the volume off for that one.

The 3rd workout actually seems the weakest (even though its level 3) but its still good in combination with the others. I definitely sweat when doing this workout, my heart rate goes up and I'm not bored because there's good variety.

3202458,5,B000WEVGHA,"Hello... I'll try to be as direct as possible.

I tried to follow a few workout videos including P90X, 10 Minute Trainer, some exercises by myself and even tried the Boot Camp by The Biggest Loser. I couldn't keep up with them.

I don't know if it was because this time I really wanted to do something but I started to follow Cardio Max.

Let me tell you, I did the warm-up ALMOST without problem.. but after the first 5 minutes of the real work-out I fell on my back trying to catch a breath and I thought "".. it's impossible to do this! "" but what made me try again was that I saw a few guys on the video even heavier than me trying to do it and actually doing it.

The second thing that motivated me was that the work out (the first level) is only 25 minutes long (20 really because the first 5 is warm up).

Anyway.. I did some effort and was able to complete the first level after around 3 times.. then I did it for about a month resting 1 or 2 days a week.

I loved it because it really made me sweat and yes, I saw results on the mirror.

One last thing.

I don't really follow a diet or watch my calories intake besides I drink a few beers almost everyday. So...

If I was able to see results without watching my diet and drinking a lot of beer.. Imagine the results you will get by watching your diet a little bit.!!!!

Rigth now I'm doing the Biggest Loser workout Boot Camp and this time I was able to do it I believe that thanks to Cardio Max..

The results are even more notorious I feel muscles on almost every part of my body and my friends at work have started to tell me how different I look.

Yes, I would start with Cardio Max Level 1 for at least 1 month and then The Boot Camp which I think helps to define mucles even more.

I do the first level on each video because I'm very busy and these 25-minute workouts are ideal for me but if you have the time do the 3 levels of each video I'm sure you'll see results even faster.

Thanks",1342828800,2,1953,4.0
3202459,3,B000WEVGHA,"I will start out by saying that I am a little above average as far as fitness level.  I have tried all of Jillian Michaels DVD's and some of Bob's and thought maybe this cardio workout would be a good edition.

But for me, this workout was not challenging enough. I found Bob and Kim's sections to be really easy, even when I tried the more advanced moves Bob suggested. I also didn't like Bob's style at all in this video. I wanted a pure cardio workout.  I liked Jillian's because it was basically all really heart pumping moves one after another. Bob's had a lot more strength moves that didn't get my heart rate up as much.  I think this workout is best suited towards someone just starting out/beginner fitness level.

I also found Bob's section to be a little cluttered. There just seemed to be so many people. I definitely preferred when only four others were in the background. Not that this is really a huge deal but less people made it easier to see the moves.  I also noticed that some of the contestants just looked miserable and like they were barely trying.  That also just kind of turned me off and made me laugh.

I think this video is on the same difficulty level as 30 Day Shred or Ripped in 30.  I think for a more difficult cardio workout I would try Banish Fat Boost Metabolism (it is like Jillian's section the whole time but with more types of moves).  Or try Turbo Jam workouts.",1342310400,,1402,4.357692307692307

3202461,5,B000WEVGHA,I really like this workout.  There are three separate workouts and the DVD allows you to choose which ones you want to do.  Normally I do Bob's and Jillian's and skip the other girl's workout because I just can't get into her's.  The work outs are moderately intense.  There are definitely both harder and easier DVD's out there.

3202466,3,B000WEVGHA,"I'm pretty overweight and though it's a good workout I was looking for something harder.  I'm now not a big fan of the Biggest Loser workout DVD's that feature some of the contestants doing the moves.  It looks more like the Keystone Cops as no one is doing the same exercise at the same time which would be funny if it weren't so annoying.  Jillian's workout (2), though only 10 minutes, is the toughest so I usually start with that one. She does a nice job of explaining the moves and does about 90% of the workout with you so she's just as tired as you at the end. Then I move to Bob's (1) which is 20 minutes with 6 completely disorganized goofball contestants doing halfa$$ed moves.  Bob doesn't do a terrific job explaining the moves - he does it once and then walks around the contestants of which maybe one is doing it correctly.  I actually pulled my hamstring because of incorrect technique for one of the exercises. Then I do Kim's (3) last since the first 3 of her 10 minutes are just doing simple ""bobbing"" boxing moves as a kind of cooldown.  She also does 90% of the workout with you and demonstrates the moves very nicely, but it isn't that intense for me.  If you have been doing something like Jillian's 30 Day Shred for a month or two, this will be a step down.  I'm waiting for Jillian's Kickboxing DVD to come out because I did enjoy Kim's kickboxing part of the DVD. I also prefer when the helpers are professional trainers who know how to do the moves like in the 30 Day Shred.  I think if you are really overweight and out of shape and haven't exercised a minute in the last 10 years, this is for you.",1330041600,,1625,4.284313725490196

I've seen a huge improvement with my endurance level. I can now do all three levels in one workout, though I'm very exhausted by the time I'm done. Level 1 is pretty easy, Bob is great, as always. He's lively and encouraging. Level 2 with Jillian is my favorite, out of all 3 sections, hers is my favorite because I find it the most challenging since your constantly moving and the cardio is more challenging. Level 3 with Kim is pretty challening, but still easier than level 2 with Jillian.

These workouts definitely get your heart pumping. What I like most about this DVD is that the contestants are working out with you, which helps me to push myself further since I feel like I'm not doing the workout alone. I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to get in shape fast.

3202473,2,B000WEVGHA,"I thought this video would be a good way to start boosting the cardio. I'm in the process of getting back in shape, and I figured that:

1) I could handle this -- and even if I couldn't do it all, I was glad that the sections were customizable.
2) Being a product of ""The Biggest Loser"", the trainers wouldn't be the standard narcissistic jerks that turn into P.E. teachers and gym trainers.

And both of these were true -- I don't think I could have made it through the entire 50-minute workout the first time. And Bob was offering encouragement and beginner alternatives a lot.

But I still couldn't do more than 20 minutes of this because Bob does each exercise only once and then the camera goes to the students WHO DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT THEY'RE DOING while Bob wanders around and talks. So every move that he wanted me to do, if I didn't pick up how to do it the first time, I was lost, because I couldn't follow the students' bad form.

I understand -- and greatly appreciate -- the fact that the students are ""regular"" people. It's very encouraging to see people like me reaching for the same goal. But the trainers need to do the exercises a lot more, or the students need to be more familiar with the exercises.

I'll come back to this DVD once I've found one from which I can actually learn.",1323216000,,1302,4.319672131147541

The first day I did this I did the warm-up and about 15 minutes of the workout and at the end my legs were jelly and I was sweating all over the place. Over the course of the next few days I was able to go longer and longer into the video but still have those jelly legs and face covered in sweat...the sign of a good workout. I have that mommy tummy and I am just trying to get back into shape after having my youngest 7 months ago and this is deff doing the trick. I would recomend it to anyone!,1318896000,,569,3.871794871794872
3202478,5,B000WEVGHA,"The difficulty of this workout pales in comparison to that of Jillian's Boost Metabolism, however, that said it is still an effective and challenging cardio workout. I consider myself and advanced exerciser and I plan to use this as my cardio workout when I want something less challenging. I still end it pretty sweaty and tired but I definitely don't feel like I'm gonna die like some plyo DVDs. I highly recommend it as a cardio DVD for maintenance or for someone who is overweight and needs to get back in shape. Someone who has some weight to lose will find it challenging and will find that the DVD will give you room to grow. For instance, it can be done with or without weights. The broken up segments also make it seem like it goes by faster.",1318032000,,751,4.449275362318841
3202479,4,B000WEVGHA,"I purchased this video because it was cardio and not interval training like most of my other videos. While I enjoy Level 1 of this video, Bob Harper teaches this one there are a few issues I have with it.

There are 3 levels and there is a different trainer for each segment. One is 20 minutes, the other two are only 10 minutes long. {kind of a let down}. While I am in pretty good physical condition, and  workout 6 days a week someone who is not so informed or who is very overweight could have trouble with this video. The 10 minute section Jillian teaches recycles some moves from her Boost Your Metabolism video,(high knees and a few others).The other ladies portions seems like a waste of time to me.

There is a decent amount of lunges in this video. If you do not use proper form, i could see you having knee issues. Also while I commend them on using actual contestants it is distracting to watch them while exercising. A lot of them seem to be doing their own thing so its confusing. I know some people need to modify for their fitness level but they should use people who can at least do the workout somewhat in correct form.

Overall Bob Harpers section is the only one that I like, and most days I just do his twice then cool down. I like his section enough to ignore the flaws in this video.",1317772800,2,1306,4.254032258064516
3202480,5,B000WEVGHA,"WoW will this make you sweat! I have tried lots of different in home/on the treadmill/elliptical cardio workouts and I can never seem to make it through because I am not pushed, or I'm to busy thinking how much it hurts, or I have to do it for way to long each day so it gets boring. I really enjoy this workout because I can feel it working, I felt like I really accomplished something in a short period of time each day, and they don't give you time to think about how much you are sweating and hurting. By the time I started thinking ""Oh my gosh, what if I can't.."", they were moving on to the next move, or kicking it up a notch! I agree with the review that says the levels seem to be in reverse, the lunges in level one certainly whooped my butt into shape...Literally! I liked how even the first time I did this dvd on level one, they make you feel great about it even if you can't do it with the weights yet, and you can't get as low as they do on their lunges, etc.

The Point: great cardio workout in 20-30min, 4-5days a week, that makes you feel good enough (about yourself) at the end to keep coming back to it every day (even though your legs and butt are feeling the burn)!

Also, if you are feeling it super tough in those first few days like me, I greatly advise hot baths. ;)",1316649600,2,1292,4.0627450980392155

The last segment with Kim was pretty easy too.  The only segment that was good and only reason why this video even deserved 1 star was Jillian's segment.  And even that was her ""Fat Boost Metabolism"" video.  Totally skip this if you're not a beginner.  I'm glad I borrowed this from the library.",1316563200,3,448,4.525

I'm not saying it's harder or better, but for ME and my desire to do pure cardio for fat burning, this does the job!!

I am a typical 40 something woman who has gradually packed on the weight over the years and I need good ol' fashioned pure fat burning cardio.  I am a Mom with little time to work out and I want to KILL it in 50 minutes and get the most I can from a DVD.  This dvd does the trick!!  Jillians middle segment never gets easier and pushes me to the limit.  Bob's segment is awesome and rips up my glutes and thighes with a LOT of lunges.  The final segment is just OK BUT it is great for the gradual cool down.

There's no way if you are doing this 5x a week and eating smart that you will not melt the pounds off.  BEWARE if you havent' worked out in a while, your behind and thighs will be SUPER SORE the next few days but that is a good thing.  Bob really focuses on building up the larger muscles in your body, more muscle burns more fat so you might as well build up those large glute and leg muscles!!

Weight training is important too, I bought the combo DVD set with the sculpting DVD as well.

My husband has never had an interest in doing this DVD with me until yesterday. He didn't think it would be challenging compared to his uber-extreme videos.  Well, he is SORE today and soooo impressed with the cardio workout he got. He's hooked.",1316217600,4,1546,4.079470198675497

As far as the workout itself, I broke out a sweat and my muscles were definitely sore the next few days.  But even if you can get past how boring it gets, Bob's *constant* talking through his whole segment might drive you crazy like it did me, as well as Jillian's harsh commentary that didn't sound encouraging at all.  You can play the dvd with music only but then its hard to do push ups and stare at the tv screen to know what to do next.  Its a good workout but it lacks that fun energy some other workout dvds have and the instructors talk way too much.",1315267200,,720,4.121428571428571
3202484,5,B000WEVGHA,"This program is excellent as long as you take it seriously and really do what they are telling you to do. Some people can't stick with in-home workouts or DVD exercising, but if you really do these workouts and stick to the program you will definitely see results! My husband doesn't like doing DVD workouts, he much prefers going to the gym and lifting weights or doing his cardio outside, but even he says that this DVD really tests your endurance. I particularly like it because it is motivational and I don't have to worry about what other people think or who is staring at me as I'm working out because I'm in the comfort of my own home. I can really feel a difference when I am doing this program and I can tell it is working and building my stamina. I really get a full body workout with this, which is great in a cardio workout! I think this will be a great benefit to my overall health. I was over 200 pounds when we bought this DVD and I was able to do the workout pretty well, so it doesn't matter how big your are, anyone can do this! It's all about knowing your body and your limits and not pushing yourself past them, but doing your best to keep up. You have to have the personal drive for this to work for you, otherwise you will end up quitting and you won't see any results. There are no trainers to tell you to keep going, so you have to have the drive to make this worth the money. If you have that then this will be a great deal for you!
I am currently 170 pounds, but feel it necessary to note that I have also drastically changed my diet and I am taking supplements (hydroxycut) to help my weight loss.

A warm-up is supposed to gradually prepare your body for working out, not tire it out before you even get started.  Seriously!  Jumping jacks for warm-up?!  I was sore before I started the main cardio routine.  The Level 1 cardio is unevenly paced, and the moves are too quick for the average viewer to keep up with.  And Bob-whatever-his-name-is is kind of a jerk.  Sure, he acts all nice and chummy, but I can't stand his smug face and the way he doesn't participate in the workout himself.  He's like a motivational speaker: telling, not showing.  And I have trouble being inspired by that.

Bottom line, this workout was too much, too fast.  Definitely not for beginners.  I'm not the most fit person in the world, but I've done my share of workout DVDs and can keep up with most of them.  But this one was ridiculous.",1311033600,6,891,4.453416149068323

At first, I thought, ""no big deal.""  But, it kept doing it for the next 5 minutes.  I had to stop working out due to this.  I am upset because I took the time to pay for this DVD.

Second review:  Received replacement in less than 48 hours!  I think this is a great workout to really increase your core movements.  When I write core, I mean movements involving working out.  I am trying to enable my body to do more, so that I can condition it to do more of my future goals - running, karate and dancing.  My goals are to be more fit.  I am hoping weight loss comes along with that (I am a size 14/16).

Enough about me, I think that this DVD will be very difficult for someone who never works out.  The first time I tried this video (last year via youtube video), I got really hurt and I was sore for about 4 days.  This time, I am able to actually cool down during the cool down.

I read a review that talked about how the last 10 minutes are nothing compared to Bob & Jillians workouts.  I agree.  HOWEVER, I like that the last 10 minutes aren't quite so intense.

The DVD is packed with three different levels with different times and is programmed to be an intense cardio workout. I'd started with the DVD in the middle/end of March and so far have lost 7 Ibs. from doing this. It's a great alternative for someone who cannot afford at a gym at the time, or an add-on to whatever it is you are doing. I usually add brisk walks along with doing the DVD - walking is a great exercise in itself. Focusing on being active, wanting to be healthy, losing weight, this DVD is a great addition. If wanting great results eating properly and getting nutrients helps along with exercise. The DVD gets you going, and will sweat a LOT which is nice. The lunges will get you in the beginning. I have a somewhat ""old"" injury on my knee and hip but gradually I'm working it off and am careful. Yoga and some stretches are included in the DVD which is nice, and helps with that. The first level for one to two weeks is somewhat brutal, and the second one is up there. I've started week 3 with the second level now added. I remember I couldn't even get started the first time I popped the DVD in. They do get you going. It's OK if you are a little off - or do things differently - they even mention that - and they are encouraging.

3202505,5,B000WEVGHA,"Wow!  Talk about RESULTS!  I have been exercising on and off for the last 17 years and recently put on some weight.  On a routine trip to buy a Brita water pitcher, there was a coupon attached for $5 off the purchase of a Biggest Loser workout DVD.  Always up for a deal, I chose to buy this DVD.  I am completely amazed with the fast results!  I have been working out with this DVD and following a low-fat, low-sodium diet for four weeks now.  So far, I have lost a total of 17 inches, 10 lbs., and a jeans size!  This is the most weight I have ever lost in such a short period of time and I contribute most of it to this workout.

It is a tough, highly intense, cardio workout.  I really dislike cardio, but truthfully, it is the only exercise that will burn fat off your body.  It consists of a warm-up, 3 levels of intensity, and a cool down.  It is customized to put you on a 6 week exercise program; however, I chose to make it a 9 week program since I consider myself to be a beginner again.  Level I consists of a 20 minute aerobic workout with Bob Harper, who is truly gifted and amazing when it comes to fitness and weight loss.  In addition to Bob, the other people doing the workout are former Biggest Loser contestants.  This keeps me motivated because when I see how far they have come, and that they are not stopping, it encourages me to continue on, too.  Next, you add in Level II, which is an additional 10 minutes of aerobics with Jillian Michaels.  This is where I am at right now.  You are so tired by the time you're done with Bob and then Jillian pops in and kicks the intensity up a notch.  I haven't gotten to level III yet, but that consists of Kim Lyons doing another 10 minutes of kickboxing.  By the time you complete this workout, you will look like one of the Biggest Loser contestants; by this, I mean you will have sweat pouring off of you in sheets.  There is some jumping involved on this DVD, but you can definitely modify the moves yourself to get rid of the jumping if you have joint problems.

The only drawbacks that I see with this workout is that they could have picked better music, for starters.  The Biggest Loser people are not always in sync, but what do you expect?  It's not like they are exercise physiologists.  And, last... the cool down is somewhat lacking.  There should be more time spent bringing down your heart rate before you jump right into the yoga.  It is somewhat difficult to be standing there huffing and puffing and trying to stretch immediately.  Also, the stretches are minimal.  Therefore, after the workout ends, I usually do an additional 15 minutes or so of stretching to prevent muscle cramping the next day.  If you don't, your legs will definitely be hurting later on.

I had to stop half way and couldn't finish it. It was very hard for someone who's not used to working out. I almost gave up and thought that this was not a DVD to get for people who have not been exercising regularly. However, after a couple of weeks of working out, 2-3 times a week, I've been able to follow it to the end and now going on the next level. I agree with the other reviewer who said that it can be boring (lunges, lunges, and more lunges). But it works, it makes me sweat and my heart rate is certainly up when I'm doing the exercises. One thing that annoys me is the comment/conversation that Bob makes. I find them very distracting. I would prefer him to give a general encouragement and not engage in a joke/conversation in the session. (ex: Julie, how are you doing? Julie, are you going to stop? Oh look at Julie, she's working real hard, Oh look at Eric sweating, etc). As a person who is not very fit, I need all the concentration and energy that I can muster to do the exercise. And those jokes distract me. There is an option for music only, without trainer instruction. But I constantly have to look at the TV, which is hard since you constantly have to look up to the TV when doing exercise (instead of fully engrossed in your position).
All in all, this is a good work out DVD to have. Just be prepared, you may not be able to follow the whole thing from the start and will probably be sore for a couple of days after.",1299196800,,1604,4.160771704180064

Today was my first workout using Cardio Max Level 1 (warm up, level 1 w/ Bob, cool down). I have to give Biggest Loser credit, it's definitely a high energy workout. I really didn't know what to expect from their DVD's, as I've only seen a couple episodes of the program, but I was very pleased w/ what I found.

I read tons of reviews w/ people complaining about none of the competitors being in sync && was shocked to read reviewers commenting on how fat, gross, && uninspiring the competitors were. Personally, as someone who has been overweight && @ top condition, I find anyone who gets off their butt to do any type of exercise inspiring. It didn't bother me that none of them were in sync, as I am rarely in sync w/ cardio workouts anyway. I'm not sure what gym those reviewers go to, but it's a rare occasion @ my gym when everyone in a cardio class are completely in sync w/ the instructor. But, I suppose some people have to find something to complain about...&& if this is ur only complaint w/ this DVD, count urself lucky.

Personally, I enjoyed the options that Bob gave u for lower or higher intensity workout. I only used 3lb weights today, because who knows the pain that tomorrow will bring, but I always enjoy the options of a tougher workout so I can push myself once I'm used to the routine. I didn't sweat as much as some reviews commented about (&& I think, right now, I'm in very poor shape), but Bob really did push my limits w/ the moving plank push-ups. Oh em gee! For most of the section I just stayed in plank position. :) && I'm not ashamed to admit it.

I love that u can completely customize ur routine if u don't want to use the previously set weekly routines. I will say that I am a little disappointed that there's not more of an ab workout anywhere on this DVD. I love to work on my abs && I'm a sucker for a good tummy burn the next morning. But, if u're like me, I'm sure u have ur own ab routine u could do separately.

Overall, I'm very pleased w/ this buy && look forward to upcoming weeks as I push myself further into the Biggest Loser workout routines. I would have given this routine 5 stars if anyone had worked on abs for any length of time, but I still don't think that u would be disappointed if u bought this DVD. Good luck! :)",1298851200,,2466,4.229299363057325
3202508,3,B000WEVGHA,"This workout video definitely gets me sweating and gets my heart rate up. The only thing is that I find this video to be a bit boring because there is so much repition! In the weeks 1-2 workout with Bob, be prepared for a heavy emphasis on leg workouts, specifically LOTS of lunges. Lunges to the front, lunges to the side, lunges with weights, lunges without weights. Then add in ""jumping rope"" a few times in between all that and you've got his workout. I want a total body workout in a DVD that claims to be ""cardio max"". I prefer the Jillian Michaels DVDs. They kick my butt but keep me more interested.",1297555200,,607,4.333333333333333

3202510,5,B000WEVGHA,"I recently bought a calorie counter/heart rate monitor watch because I was curious how good of a workout I was actually getting with this. I was really getting my heart rate up during the whole workout, but was only figuring maybe a couple hundred calories. I couldn't have been more wrong. During the 1st and 2nd level workouts (Bob's and Jillian's) I burned 674 calories. Sure, it's not as many as I need for my daily caloric deficit, but it's a heck of a lot more than I thought I was burning, and that was with me having to slow down a few times due to side cramps. I have no doubt that when I do this again tomorrow morning at full capacity (as much as I can muster at 7am...), I'll be able to burn at least 1000, half of the calories I need to burn daily to get to my deficit. I absolutely recommend this video. It gets your heart pumping and the calories burning without a lot of hard or high intensity moves. It's definitely a keeper for me.",1295654400,2,949,4.21978021978022

This is a very good workout for over weight people i weighed 320 pounds when i started using it.
Three months after, i lost a total of 60 pounds and gained muscle all around my legs became stronger,
i have more stamina,more strength, more energy, best of all i can wear my size 36 jeans again.
But im warning you stretch your thighs alot more then the video stretch does becouse u will be usin them the
most and will stretch them out and have that pain. Well i loved it i recommend this vid to anyone exept athletes this will not be enough for you guys!",1294790400,4,645,4.168

I have had a small pudge since having my son and evey workout DVD I bought, I could feel the muscle developing underneath but the fat would not go away. After just doing the workout ONCE (the week 1-2 workout) I noticed that afterwards my belly had sweated of some fat. FINALLY! After one week, doing it each morning and night, I noticed my stomach actually getting flatter! if you want a workout that will BURN FAT this is it. Although I was trying to target only my tummy I lost weight all over. It is a tough workout but it is worth it!

3202519,4,B000WEVGHA,"Perfect video for beginners to pros. You can choose your levels and swap out workouts. some how they've incorporated new video technology into this DVD. It's a bit tedious to get used to how to maneuver around the DVD for each workout but, once you've learned its format.. it's way easy. You have a few options for music and workout pace. It's a really good beginner workout or for those folks who are more physically advanced who want to swap out cardio workouts.",1288569600,,464,4.602409638554217
3202520,4,B000WEVGHA,"I checked this out from the library, and I really like it. Well, I didn't necessarily like it WHILE I was doing it. It's not a quick and easy work out, which is a good thing. I found it to be challenging, and even though I'm at a pretty high fitness level (running, spinning, kickboxing, etc), I was out of breath and sweating profusely with this one. Bob's 20-min section was the toughest to get through. Once you get through those first 20 minutes, just keep going; Jillian's 10 minutes will keep your heart rate up, but you can stick with it. And Kim wasn't as annoying as I thought she'd be; her 10 minutes were doable as well. I do agree that this is not a workout for beginners, but then nothing I've seen on the Biggest Loser show would lead me to believe that THOSE workouts are for beginners, either. I like that the people in the DVD are real people who sometimes struggle with the workout themselves. This one and Bob's Biggest Loser Boot Camp are the best exercise DVDs I've found so far.",1288051200,,1000,4.352941176470588
3202521,5,B000WEVGHA,I love the biggest loser dvds! This one gives you a great cardio/strength workout! Levels 1 & 2 were great! Level 3 was not all that creative or difficult but I guess it makes it a well rounded workout since the first 2 levels are so intense!!!

So far I'm still on workout 1 and Bob harper is the best..he literally makes you want to keep moving and I like that.

3202524,5,B000WEVGHA,"I bought this DVD back in Dec 09 because it was annoying to run in the cold and rain in the great NW.  After the 1st workout, I was super sore for a whole week.  I never knew it would make feel so sore especially when I was jogging 3x a week for 30 minutes.  Seriously, my legs felt wobbly and butt muscles were hurting.  After a week of soreness, I continued with this dvd 3x a week and followed the instructions.  First 2 weeks do level 1 and then gradually add the other 3 levels.

I have to say I am impressed.  In less than a year I lost 16 lbs without going on a strict diet. My metabolism is at its highest, I consume about 2200-2300 calories a day and I have not gained a single pound, infact I think I'm still losing weight.  My legs, stomach, arms and butt are very toned.  (I have a flat butt and I thought this workout would make my bum even flatter but it turned out to be the opposite.  I have more muscles and it is shaped pretty nicely :0) ) And it feels great to be able to fit into my highschool clothes.  I recommend this anyone who seriously want to get back in shape.  The only thing I did in conjuction to this workout is drink at least 8 glasses of water a day, sleep more and eat home cooked meals more often.

I also recommend Jillian's ""Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism"" dvd.  This one is good for intermediate to advanced people.  If you can finish her whole routine without stopping on this DVD, then congratulations, you are super fit.  I still have to work on it.  I have to stop and take a 5 minute pause near the end of the video.  But one of these days I will complete it without stopping!",1285200000,5,1618,4.082539682539682
3202525,5,B000WEVGHA,"WOW!!!  I finally ordered this DVD and am so glad I did.  I've been exercising regularly for a year and a half starting out with Tony Horton 10 min trainer and then adding to my collection of DVD's as I found ones that interested me.  I recently got ""hooked"" on watching Biggest Loser on TV thus purchasing my first Biggest Loser DVDs, Yoga Meltdown & Power Sculpt.  I like to keep things interesting so I change up the workouts often so that I don't get bored and in a rut/plateau if you know what I mean.  So needless to say, I thought I was in pretty good cardio/strength health until this morning when I pressed play on Cardio Max Level 1 with Bob.
He kicked me right to the ground.  It was great!  Now I wonder if I was really getting the cardio workout that I needed in the 50 minute workouts I've been playing.  It's been just 6 short hours since I finished his level 1 and I'm really starting to feel it in every part of my body.  I already want to go home and try level 2 & 3 just to see if I can do it to my body again today.  As with the power sculpt dvd with bob, he's very motivating.  He really makes me feel like I can do this! I'm strong, think positive and just do it!
Again, I just have to say, ""WOW!""  If you don't have this DVD already, you should.  Even if it's the DVD you put in only once in a while it's worth it.  I can't wait for Levels 2 & 3.  Yeah!! to the Biggest Loser DVD's  I love them.",1283385600,,1418,3.9575971731448765

If you don't already understand proper form or are completely out of shape, DO NOT DO THIS DVD!  I am a personal trainer that, for many reasons, has been out of commission for over a year and was looking for a beginner dvd to help motivate back to shape.  I already know proper form and most importantly how to modify so I could do the moves and not re-injure myself so I was able to get a decent workout out of it without hurting myself.  A true beginner will at the least be set up for failure as most of the moves are too difficult or at the worst actually attempt this and hurt themselves.",1282348800,2,682,4.1679389312977095

On the other hand if your just starting out it is something that you really have to work yourself into so don't be discouraged if you can't do every move, there's alot of jumping and squatting so if you have knee or joint problems I would not recommend this",1281398400,2,384,4.260273972602739

I think in order to get a good workout you need to do the whole video (10-20 minutes alone is not going to do it), but I was already active so although it was challenging - I definitely was glad I did the whole thing. I did not do it with weights so its nice to know I can still grow with this video. I liked the yoga in the end. So much so that I might buy the BL yoga DVD.",1279324800,,524,3.6875

I workout to it a couple times a week and I am already starting to see results.  Now granted, there are probably more 'organized' and harder workout dvds out there, and if you are someone who prefers all of the other exercisers to be in sync, you may not like that some of the people aren't, but I don't mind that at all.  In fact, I find it kind of refreshing that these are real people who have made amazing progress in losing weight, and are working out at their own pace.  No matter what levels I do, I am sweating from head to toe after this workout!  Plus, Bob is GREAT!  This is my first workout of Bob's that I have tried and I find myself saying, ""I get to workout with Bob today!""  He's funny, encouraging, doesn't intimidate you, and he gives you a great workout!  I find myself laughing out loud sometimes by what he and the others are saying (not very many workouts I can say that about).  Although I'm not a big fan of Jillian, her workout is good at level 2, and Kim's workout is also good (probably could be considered more a level 1 or 2 than a level 3 workout, imo).

3202532,5,B000WEVGHA,Initally I was surprised at the intensity of these workouts. Skipped Level 2 as did not like the look of all the jumping - not good for my back. However level one and level 2 together gives me a really good cardio workout. Plus you have options for low impact moves. I feel fitter and have noticed a difference in the important butt and thigh area. Would recommend this.,1277683200,,370,4.3768115942028984

They are the contestants from past BL seasons so they are not all skinny.  Some are still overweight (but still looks good since I watch BL and saw where they started from) and pretty much in our shoes.  It's nothing like those other videos you buy where everyone is extremly toned, flat stomach, making it look easy with a huge smile on their face and look as if they wear a size 2 and making it look so easy while your struggling to even breathe.

It reminds me of a cardio kickboxing class that I took in college that got me in the best shape of my life.  I like it a lot better than other workout videos that Biggest Loser has come out with as the people are relatively normal size rather than in super great shape and it's almost more casual and less perfect.  More like a real workout class.  The first time I did this workout (the low level portion with Bob only) I was in pain for 3 days.  It was fantastic.  I could feel the muscles actually working even though the steps were not that difficult.,1275350400,3,728,4.301470588235294
3202535,5,B000WEVGHA,"This is actually my fiancees review:
I have been in search of the PERFECT workout DVD! Ive tried gym memberships only to get bored and not push myself and end up giving up and quiting the membership.  Ive tried going for long walks and get even more bored and end up fumbling around with my MP3 player more than walking.
For the past 5 years the only type of physical activity was at my job.  I was on my feet,moving,walking,lifting pushing for 8-10 hours a day sometimes wit out sitting down for even a lunch break.
I ended up staying home this entire summer, not working and got pretty lazy and had decided to start to get in shape for our upcoming wedding. Im in no way a svelt, trim lady and I was starting to gain even more weight from not working anymore. I tried different workout dvds and even tried a few on youtube. Again with the boredome!!
I picked up this Cardio-Max DVD, some 5 pound hand weights, crossed my fingers and laced up my sneakers!
The 5 minute warm up is pretty intense, but I enjoyed it.  Then came Bob...Our little friend Bob! I managed to complete Bobs 20 minute section, and WOWWWWW its a workout! To some, 20 minutes may not seem like a lot, TRUST me and the other reviewers when I say...its a workout.  I typically do not sweat and will only manage to get my HR up a little bit.  I have just completed my 4th run thorugh this week of the same routine (warm up,Bob, then cool down) and Im not bored AND I noticed the last time was slightly easier for me to finish!  I do however have to curse my way through the last 5 minutes of Bobs section and voice out loud how much I disslike Bob for making me work so hard, but then I forgive him!

I have not managed to make it to level 2 or 3, I feel I need to be able to get through level one with some comfort.
**The one downside of this DVD is the ""cool down"".  I don't think that this is much of a cool down at all, while I do enjoy the yoga poses and the breathing..I stay put after and do stretches for my legs and back.  I highly recomend incorporating your own ADDITIONAL cool down after the workouts.  Otherwise this is a FANTASTIC video!  Im already feeling results and and my fiancee said he noticed my waist slightly narrower!",1275350400,2,2211,4.191037735849057

I work out at least 4 times a weak with cardio and weights, and I run frequently. Still, the beginning level on this DVD worked me harder than I regularly do at the gym. It's great because you can do it with or without weights and they modify some of the moves for those that aren't as advanced. I also use The Biggest Loser Yoga for Weight Loss and I can say without a doubt that The Biggest Loser series so far has not failed me.

Bob puts you through some tough lunges and loves to work your abs and obliques. Jillian does her 10 minute intense session with you. She puts you through many jump ropes, squats and push ups. I don't like Kim's portion of the DVD though. I don't find it challenging enough so I mainly stick to Bob and Jillian's sections.  This DVD will help you burn some calories! I love it!

Over the last 9 months I've dropped 45 pounds by walking, jogging, portion control, weightlifting, and calorie counting.  I'm trying to get to the point where I can do P90X.  I popped the CardioMax DVD in a few months ago and was reminded what a challenge it is, even for someone who wasn't a stranger to working out.  I've been sticking with it pretty regularly and have discovered that my lower back pain has significantly decreased and I feel stronger and more energetic.

I haven't seen the weight loss results yet but I'm healthier and that is more important to me.  The weight loss will happen.  I could continue to wax effusive about this program but you just have to try it.",1271894400,2,889,4.444444444444445
3202543,5,B000WEVGHA,"So far I've only done the Level 1 workout (along with the warm-up and cool-down) with Bob, and I found it very, very challenging. I've been exercising fairly regularly, so I figured the Level 1 would be comfortably do-able - boy was I surprised! It was tough! I was pretty much starting to breathe hard before I even got through the warm-up, and my heart rate stayed up throughout the whole 20 minutes of Cardio Level 1.

I really enjoyed having some of the actual Biggest Loser participants doing the workout behind Bob, and I also enjoy the different cardio levels of intesity that the various participants show. And Bob is motivating and still light, which for me works better than a ""drill sargeant"" approach. I've heard that's how Jillian can be, so I'm a little nervous of moving up to Level 2... not going to be able to put that off forever, though.",1271894400,,856,4.558441558441558

3202545,3,B000WEVGHA,"There were a couple of sequences in this workout that I thought were tough, but in general this wasn't a very hard workout.  The warm up didn't seem enough.  The first 20 min cardio session was a combo of weight exercises with a little bit of cardio.  A decent workout, but most didn't get my heart rate up (except the plyo lunges).  The level 2 workout with Jillian leading felt like just a lot of jumping.  the level 3 workout, which was supposed to be kickboxing, seemed to be mostly punching and twisting when I was hoping for a high intensity kicking routing.  I broke a sweat and burned some calories, but I won't be doing this workout again.",1271721600,,648,4.4033613445378155
3202546,4,B000WEVGHA,"Bob (Level One) is a little nerdy for me but I guess that doesn't effect the workout, right?  I prefer to do the Level Two and Level Three workouts together anyway, although I don't feel that they are really progressively harder than Level One.  Regardless, this workout DVD will get your heart pumping and that's what it is all about.",1271203200,,335,4.566666666666666
3202547,4,B000WEVGHA,"I've been working out with the Cardio Max DVD for the last couple months in addition to my other DVDs (Jillian Michaels, Jackie Warner). I use it when I'm looking to take a break from strength training and just sweat it out... and this works! The DVD has a 5 minute warm up led by Bob, then a 20 minute Bob segment, 10 minute Jillian segment, and 10 minute Kim segment. Lastly, there is a 5 minute yoga cool down led by Bob.

I find Bob to be a little annoying so I tend to skip his segment, but I enjoy Jillian and Kim and I think that Jillian has the best cuing of the three. I think that if you have bad knees/hips then you're going to have a hard time with this DVD because there is a lot of jumping.

Another annoyance is that sometimes the Biggest Loser contestants don't have proper form.

Overall, I find the Biggest Loser DVDs in general a little sloppy, the Cardio Max workout included. BUT! I still think it's fun and it is an effective cardio workout. This has been my favorite Biggest Loser DVD yet and I think it would be a fun addition to almost anyone's fitness dvd libary",1270425600,,1088,4.196172248803828
3202548,4,B000WEVGHA,"One of the things I really like about BL videos is that they use ""real"" people rather than models, etc.  That being said, this is a great video for those days when you don't have time for a long cardio workout.  I really enjoy all three workouts.  I do agree with other reviews that state that workout #3 really isn't that difficult in comparison with the other two workouts. I assumed the workouts would be harder as they went - this isn't the case.  I personally thing Jillian's workout is the hardest, with Bob's next, then Kim's.

The only drawback is that it is very difficult to follow the BL contestants.  They often are out of sync with each other.  There's times where one person is punching right while the person next to them is punching left, or one is stepping to the right and the other is stepping to the left, etc.  Or they are out of sync with the beat of the music.  They do fine when the trainer is doing the moves with them, but when the trainer stops to explain or whatever, the contestants all switch to doing their own thing.  Sometimes it seems like they are competing to be the fastest or something.  It's very distracting.",1270080000,,1148,4.393364928909953

3202551,4,B000WEVGHA,"Great for getting your heart rate up!

Pros:
1) There are modifications available for most of the exercises for those that are just starting out.
2) It is nice to see the ""normal"" people in the background struggling to do the exercises too. Makes me feel a little better :)
3) Jillian and Bob do a good job of keeping you motivated by telling you why they were doing certain exercises and reminding you of why you are doing them at all. I am one of those people that do well with the ""boot camp"" style. No bubbly smiliness here.

Cons:
1) Can be very hard on knees and wrists. Much easier if you have a thick mat to work out on. Carpet was not enough for me.
2) Level 3 (with Kim) was not even close to the intensity of levels 1 and 2. Some of her moves were difficult to follow and I did not ""feel the burn"" like the other two levels.

Overall, I would recommend for beginners/ intermediates.",1267920000,2,893,4.180232558139535

I am trying the warm up, level 1 and cool down.  On first attempt, I got the warm up and 7 minutes of level 1 then had to quit.  Today, I was able to complete the exercises.  The exercises don't seem very challenging until you try it out. :-)  Got a good sweat going.  I think this is a great investment - just buy the DVD and get a pair of hand weights (or just grab 2 cans from the kitchen) compared to joining the Gym.  More efficient to exercise at home instead of wasting time driving to/from the gym.

Update: I am now able to do all 3 levels. :-)  Here's some interesting stats from my heart rate monitor... Level 1: 335 calories in 30 minutes... Level 2: 475 calories in 40 minutes... Level 3: 610 calories in 50 minutes.",1267833600,13,899,4.056818181818182

After not having an exercise routine for 9 months while carrying my baby, I found going to the gym and getting back into the routine difficult. The workouts on this DVD are perfect and easy to fit in while the little one is taking a nap. It's definitely challenging after having not worked out in such a long period of time, but you can feel the results after just one workout. What I like best about this DVD is that they have workouts for weeks 1&2 3&4 and 5&6 which gradually increase in difficulty. Bob is so great, he doesn't make you feel bad for not being able to keep up all the time, and emphasizes to just keep moving. Funny and relaxed atmosphere, while working really really hard! You will definitely break a sweat, and will not feel like the fat chick doing a workout video with a bunch of super skinny people. Its regular people, which is why I love it so much! and it's okay if you don't have the weights, you don't need them to get a good work out.

3202556,5,B000WEVGHA,"I usually like to run outside when I want exercise, but that can be kinda hard to do in the winter in Chicago when there's snow and ice piled up on the sidewalk. I don't like going to the gym because I find treadmills too boring and it's too much hassle driving, parking, getting changed in the locker room, etc. Then I thought I might try using a home workout DVD, and I got this one because of the good reviews on Amazon.

Bottom line: Best seven bucks I've ever spent. This DVD is _awesome_. I never knew it was possible to get so much cardio in 20 minutes without leaving a 20-square-foot space in your living room, using no equipment except for your own body. 10 minutes into the level 1 video, after doing the push-up routine, I'm sweating and panting like a pig. Bob is a good motivator, and I like that there are ""real"" people in the background who look just like your average Jane & Joe making an honest effort to lose weight. The workout seems quite thorough, working both my lower and upper body. The first time I tried the Level 1, I was sore for three days. I did eventually buy a pair of weights, and they help a lot.

If you're like me and want a workout you can do at home with minimal hassle, this is the DVD for you. And with a DVD like this, there's really no excuse for not exercising. Don't even think of saying you're ""too busy to work out."" You don't need to leave your house, you don't need to pull out your running shoes, you don't even need to get changed if you're alone at home -- just pull down the blinds, strip down to your underwear, and you're good to go! 20 minutes with this DVD is all it takes, and then you can hop straight into the shower. No locker rooms, no driving & parking, no slippery ice, no dogs chasing you, nada.

Like I mentioned before the workout is broken down into three levels. Level 1 is 20 minutes with Bob. Level 2 is 10 minutes with Jillian and Level 3 is 10 minutes with Kim.

Level 1 is led by Bob Harper and he does a great job of teaching the movements and encouraging you along. The cast's form isn't always the best--watch Bob not them!--but its nice to know there are other people working alongside you. Level 2 is a quick 10 minutes with Jillian Michaels. Its tough because she moves FAST, but the exercises get changed up quickly so the time flies by. I gave the DVD only 4 of 5 stars because Level 3 wasn't really a Level 3 to me. Compared to Jillian's Level 2, Kim Lyons' Level 3 was like a cool down. Its nice to add 10 more minutes to the workout, but it isn't any harder than the other two levels.

3202565,3,B000WEVGHA,"I bought this dvd because I already have all of Jillian Michael's videos and love them.  I have been doing her Banish Fat Boost Metabolism for about a week and lost 4 pounds.  So I bought this and was going to do the above plus one of the levels from this video.  There's no way this workout on it's own, doing the levels as instructed on the dvd is a good enough workout. Unless you are completely new to exercise, you're going to have to do more than the levels as they are.

Both Bob and Jillian's segments are good. Jillian's is more intense and feels harder even though it's only ten minutes and half the time of Bob's. The other one, what's-her-face (sorry, I don't watch the show that much and did not watch when she was on it), her workout is utterly pathetic. Skip it and just do Jillian's twice. Seriously, it's terrible. Her workout is a mess. There is little direction, her exercises are rather pathetic. She does not really tell you any proper form, so it was killing my back. (There is also a part of Bob's that hurts my back, but at least he tells you what to do if your lower back is hurting.) I have no idea how they think this woman's workout should be a level three. If it has to be included at all it should be level two, and Jillian should be level three.

The third trainer, and the fact that the levels being set up like they are...not very challenging, is why I'm giving it three stars. When I do this video, I go through the whole thing, except I do Jillian's segment twice.  Most times I only do Bob or Jillian's segment as a supplement to doing something else.

I think this video is okay for people just starting out, and may even be too hard for people who are older or very out of shape or have arthritis or other conditions. If you've been exercising for awhile this isn't going to cut it if you do it as instructed, do yourself a favor and buy one of Jillian's dvd's instead.",1261008000,,1907,4.236914600550964

There is no transition from one movement to the next, not even a small one. The cueing is terrible and the past contestants look as if they could care less about being there. Owning the majority of the Biggest loser workouts, even quite a few of Jillian Michaels workouts, where the cueing is superb, there are safe transitions and motivated contestants/exercisers, and safe directions and great info to get the most out of your workout, I can not recommend this workout to anyone.

I mostly wanted to write this to give a tip I've found useful with the cool down:  I've found that I can't go from the intense workout directly to deep breaths for yoga at the end.  My heart is racing and I can't get my breathing under control while standing.  Now after I'm done with the cardio before the cool down starts I drop into a ""Child's Pose"" and focus on deep breaths for a while.  From a kneeling position I join Bob in stretching my arms out and into a prayer position.

It's a jumbled mess in my opinion. Bob's segment (level 1) is harder than Kim's level 3 segment. Jillian (level 2) is the best at being more organized and not just throwing moves in off the top of her head like Bob. Bob's segment spends too much time on squat-related moves, which could be hard on the knees for beginners. He also doesn't take enough time to make sure the biggest loser contestants have proper form, or are careful about certain injury prone areas, like lower back and knees. So, they all look really sloppy doing the work out, Bob and Kim don't do much of the moves with you, so Jillian's segment is the only one that's easier to follow.
They could have done better editing, it's a bit unprofessional in parts. There are a lot of Tae-bo wanna be moves. The flow and pace is jumbled and not smooth to follow. I'd rather stick to the real Tae-bo.",1253232000,2,1009,4.315789473684211

I was disappointed for a few reasons: Bob's workout (during the first weeks) is effective and makes you sweat, but his cuing is not good and he doesn't provide enough guidance about form. He's doing one thing while everyone else does another and he's not very focused. I'd like a bit more instruction. The dvd goes from high heart rate activity to standing cool down. I am in fairly good shape, but I need a gradual transition to cooling down. Bob starts the yoga stretch right after the cardio.
Jillian's workout is high intensity, but it's not interesting or fun. Her tactic is to motivate people by being tough on them, but this doesn't work for me. I am already motivated. I would like to enjoy the process, and not feel like I am forever doing the football run.
The third trainer, whose name escapes me, is by far my favorite. Her section is fun, enjoyable and the one I prefer to do repeatedly. She's great and I wish the entire dvd was devoted to her workouts. Bob is super cute and funny, but that's not gonna make me use the dvd repeatedly.

I tend to think level 2 is the hardest, you don't stop moving the entire time, but level 3 is my favorite, because I'm a fan of boxing and kick boxing, so its right up my alley.  I'm less of a fan of level 1, but I like to do a warm up, level 3, level 2, level 3 and cool down.  And I like that I can do that with this workout.

It does have some draw backs, my boyfriend tried it and it was entirely too difficult for him with his asthma, which I told him he should just not do things ""all out"" and just do some modified moves that are shown until he can do them completely.  Which I think would have helped his situation, and would help anyone else in the same situation.

Overall it is a kick ass workout, and is a great option for those of us who like to get a great workout from home spending much less than we would at a gym with the same results!  I have now lost 12 lbs thanks to both this dvd and a few others, and I'm proof that a gym isn't necessary.  Good luck to all, and I definitely recommend this!",1251158400,,1112,3.8893805309734515
3202585,5,B000WEVGHA,"For about a week now, I've been alternating the Cardio Max Workout with the Power Sculpt Workout.  Honestly.... I'm 27 years old and since I was 17, after high school sports were over, I've been looking for a workout that I can actually LOVE... and I never found it.  I tried everything.  I really really did.  I finally finally FINALLY found one I love!!  Maybe it's because I just started going back to school and have found a new sense of competitiveness inside me- not for others, but for myself, or maybe Biggest Loser is just awesome.  Regardless, I have found that I have so much motivation to do this DVD... and clearly competing with myself to see if I can make it through the whole workout today, or make it to the next level tomorrow.  Sheesh!  Who needs a workout partner!

I know people have complained that the Biggest Losers in the background are distracting because they are doing things wrong, but I actually like it, because I can correct myself by looking at them, knowing they are doing it wrong, then looking at myself and thinking- crap I'm doing it just like they are- I'm doing it wrong!  So then I correct myself.

The first day I wasn't able to get through the whole workout, in fact I only made it 10 minutes out of 20.  I was sore for... well.... I'm still sore from it!!  I could barely walk the next day- I LOVE that feeling- just knowing it's working!  After 4 times of doing it, I can get through the workout, and am so anxious to move on, but I know there is a reason for why this level is harder than the higher levels, and why it needs to be done for at least 2 weeks.  You've really got to jumpstart your metabolism and shock those muscles into action!  Then you really need to maintain it for a few weeks before moving on, otherwise your results may not be what you were expecting.

I'm thinking about purchasing Boot Camp for after my 6 weeks are over on these two DVD's, and possibly alternating it with the Yoga one..... any thoughts on that combo??

As for eating- I am TRYING to eat healthy, but I'm more of a ""natural"" dieter, and natural doesn't mean less calories, so I'm working on it.  I'd rather not eat fake foods.  I'm a honey over splenda kinda girl.

Anyways, I've taken my measurements (but not my weight- bc I don't care for that frustrating number as inches count way more than pounds and it's just discouraging when you don't see the number you want so fast) and took my before pictures, and I can't wait to *hopefully* see results in a few months!!!",1250899200,3,2506,4.369330453563715

I mean really you get a workout and then at times I thought he was crazy for pushing for more...so it is great.  However, i couldn't help but be distracted by the ""biggest losers"" competitors who were not always doing the moves correctly...so if you can see past the men and women in the background and focus on the moves and technique that he's giving you then you will love this dvd.  it is really intense and if you want to sweat and really get a great workout you will not be disappointed.",1250208000,3,573,4.1441441441441444

I just do one when I really want a burn and two and three together. I also really like that you can customize your workout program.  You just add a warmup, as many of the levels as you want, and a cooldown. Mix and match, change it up like you like.  And once you get really familiar with the workouts you can do it just to music, no instructor audio, if you'd like.  I like the options.",1249516800,,553,4.092592592592593
3202588,3,B000WEVGHA,"This isn't one of my favorite workout DVDs, but I do it once in a while, with modifications, for variety.

Pros:
- The steps are easy!  This can't be underrated; as someone who has trouble with more complicated aerobics, and won't go near a step class because my left and right get confused, it's good to do a workout where coordination is not an issue.  Also because no one is doing the workout in time to the music, you can just go whatever pace you want and it's fine.
- Good cardio.  There's a 5-minute warmup, then three main workout segments of 20, 10, and 10 minutes accordingly, then a 5-minute stretch.  My heart rate went up even during the warmup and stayed up for the three main workouts.  Of the three main segments, the first two were more high-impact and the third is lower impact (almost all cardio kickboxing stuff) and somewhat easier.
- Basically because lots of it is high-impact, you get a lot of bang for your buck in terms of calories burned in a short amount of time.

Cons:
- Too many lunges in the first main segment.
- Jillian's segment (2nd main one) not very adaptable for pre-natal use.  It should be avoided altogether after 1st trimester--there's no one doing low-impact modifications in this segment and it's way too jostly jumping around for 10 minutes.
- Kinda boring, unless you like boot-camp type workouts, which I don't.  I'm glad the segments are short because during the first two main ones, I kept wondering when they'd be over.  I enjoyed the 3rd one more--the cardio kickboxing one--in terms of being more fun and a little dance-y.
- Didn't really like the yoga stretch cooldown--a bunch of inhaling the arms up and down into prayer, then a warrior series with a triangle thrown in.  If I wanted yoga I'd do a different DVD.  Why I didn't like it?  It seemed tossed in because yoga's ""in""--it didn't seem to flow with the rest of the material.  I thought it should have more conventional stretches, particularly addressing the hamstrings--which aren't really stretched that well by triangle pose.  With all the work gastrocs and hamstrings get from the high impact nature of this DVD, they really need to be stretched more; if I don't my body really complains.  It's better actually to repeat the warm-up than do the cool-down here, as the warm-up stretches the needed areas.

Basically, if I'm short on time but want to have a cardio workout, I might pop this one in.  But I really prefer other workout DVDs--particularly Tae-bo or Ravi Singh and Ana Brett's kundalini yoga series.",1249257600,5,2526,4.663656884875847

3202592,5,B000WEVGHA,"I'm a busy student who doesn't have the time or the money for a gym membership, and as summer approached, I realized that working out OUTSIDE in the oppressive Miami heat was just not going to work. I've been wanting to shed about 8-10 lbs before school starts back again. I began my search for workout DVDs with some skepticism, thinking that it was going to be difficult to get a good workout from a DVD.

Oh, how I was wrong! I've watched The Biggest Loser show a few times and liked the favorable reviews on this DVD, so I decided to try it out. WHOA! What a workout! It is TOUGH and I sweat like crazy from doing this. My heart rate gets up very high, and I'm a 24 year old who is not overweight by any means. The first time I did this, I was sore for two days. You can really feel it all over your body. It is a challenging workout, and I'm having to work up to doing all three cardio sections. As of today, I can only do Bob's section (section 1) and about 3/4 of Jillian's (section 2). I haven't even touched Kim's section yet (section 3). Those jumping lunges in Bob's section are KILLER. If that doesn't get your heart rate pumping then you must be Superman.

The biggest plus is the fact that you don't need any equipment except for maybe a couple of small weights (but even those are optional as Bob states on the DVD), AND you don't need a lot of space AT ALL for this. I live in a small apartment and can easily do it there with no problems whatsoever. I've even been able to do it in my bedroom at my parent's house which is cluttered with furniture. I would recommend, however, doing this on carpet rather than tile. There is one part where you need to get down into pushup position, and that just hurts on tile, especially if you get tired and need to drop down to your knees for a bit.

Also, one last comment, some folks have complained about Bob being annoying in the DVD, but I like him. I like the talking and the motivation. I need that to keep going otherwise I get lazy and start slacking off. ;) In addition, it's nice to see the biggest loser cast on the DVD. It's nice to see women who are not 100 lbs with six-pack abs. It's nice to see normal women just fighting the good fight when it comes to losing weight. That's refreshing to me.

All in all, a great DVD and I am pleasantly surprised at what a great workout I'm getting. I've already lost two lbs!",1247356800,10,2383,4.162689804772234

Besides, the cues and the motions of the participants are constantly out of sync. Or I should say there is no rhythm in this DVD, particularly in level one.

The people working out in the video are biggest loser cast members: they are not models who look perfect.  I tell myself if they can do it so can I.  I have stuck with the video for two weeks and have been working out at least 3 times per weeks and I have already seen physical results.  My butt and legs have firmed up, and my biceps are toned.  I feel stronger and my endurance is enhanced. I also purchased Jillian's 30 day Shred and do that one at least twice per week.

Bob's 20 minute workout is probably enough for anybody, but if you have more in the tank and want to step up the intensity, hop right into Jillian's workout. It is only 10 minutes, which is the perfect length after Bob's tough 20, and it is an intense, quick hitting session.  The final 10 minute workout is supervised by Kim.  It's primarily kickboxing-like activities, probably the easiest of the 3 and provides a good closing session.  If any of the workouts ever get to be too difficult, almost all have lighter variations (pushups on knees, low impact jumping jacks, etc).  All three are very good instructors.  Again, like all of the videos in this series, it is very time efficient.  Just blow it out and try your hardest for 10-20 minutes and you're done.",1244160000,,1026,4.508108108108108

I am still on beginner and trying level two on the cardio, the level two on the body sculpt isn't as hard for me. I am still getting a workout and sweating. I love that the people aren't fit/skinny and they aren't like a happy robots making every movement look easy. I love and respect all the sizes. I look at them and think if they have come that far and can do it, so can I. They are more real to me. I still have to stop and catch my breath. I will get there. All I can say is, if you want to start working out and like the series, then go for it. I like it. I haven't seen body changes but I haven't been doing it long. The point is, is to make time to workout for you. No dvd or gym membership is worth anything if not used.

3202612,5,B000WEVGHA,"Let me preface this review by saying I am not someone who needed to lose weight. I've always been active and a healthy weight, but I bought this because I had just given birth to my third child, and after having ""taken it easy"" for a few months, I wanted to tone up and feel stronger.  Reading the reviews for this, I decided I could take a chance.

Wow.  This will really work you hard.  Considering how much the cast members of ""TBL"" have lost, that shouldn't be a surprise.

I could feel myself getting stronger with each workout, and everyone commented that I was in great shape within just a few months of having given birth.  That was a year ago, and last fall, I started going to the gym, running and working out on the elliptical.  I really like a challenge, so when you read that, don't think for a second that I was going easy on myself.  But I recently had to drop the running due to back problems, so I started adding this workout back into my routine once or twice a week.  And every time I do it, I wish I'd never stopped. You just get real definition and visible results from it.

I feel like I can confidently recommend this for people of all fitness levels because of the ""customizing"" workout options.  I will say that I'm not a huge fan of the cool-down (I usually skip and do my own stretches).  It's called ""Yoga"", but there just isn't enough real honest-to-goodness stretching, just focusing on your breathing, which is nice and all, but...  I also think that there are some gaps between the different exercises -- usually I can squeeze in a couple extra before they start doing it.

I had to get used to not having a formal instructor to follow along with because Bob starts the instructions, does a few (sometimes all) of the reps and then walks around before coming back to the front to give the next instruction.  It is non-stop with very little downtime between each exercise.  I had been doing the 30-Day Shred and while I was used to the intensity I was used to a few seconds between each move.  I alternate this video with Power Sculpt, which follows the same style--6-8 week program that increases every 2 weeks or when you're ready to move on to the next level.

I have never done so many lunges in my life--but if you want to round the corners off your backside, this video accomplishes that for sure.

However, if you have lower body injuries this video may not be the best choice for you.

I recommend keeping track of your progress with a measuring tape instead of a scale.  You'll be more modivated by your results.",1239321600,3,1053,4.447916666666667

I started cardio max using 2lb weights and really felt it. I never sweat so much even when I did the 30 day shred. I felt beat after the workout but nothing hurt. I got up today and my butt, back and sides hurt for sure. Taking today off from the workout. Will do it again tomorrow but without the weights maybe I rushed it. But I will definately keep doing the workout. Just need to lose about 15-20 lbs. This is definately a keeper.",1238457600,2,554,4.138888888888889

No real instruction, all the exercisers were going at different speeds and different directions it was too hard to follow.  Bob was trying to talk all ""street"" I couldn't stand watching it anymore.  I hope the segment with ""just music"" is better.",1237507200,7,501,4.4021739130434785

I've been on a diet and going to the gym for about a week and a half and lost 8 pounds! I got this video today and started with level 1... Let me tell you, I usually do about an hour at the gym on ellipticals and treadmills but that gets SOOO boring, plus I'm in college and I don't have time. This video is PERFECT, you can customize it and everything. I got it for 9$ so you really can't beat that!

It is nice that people from past seasons are in the video because you can see modified ways of doing the exercises as well as get motivated that if they can do it so can you!

This exercise routine finds all those muscles that I don't use often and lets me know where they are.  The first time I did this, I was thinking.. ""bring it on, I can do this!""  I did everything.. high intensity.  I was sore for 3 days.  The first day everything hurt. My quads, glutes, outsides of legs, inside of my legs and a little of my back. I could not even sit on my butt. It hurt too bad.  I just wished Bob left one or two muscles that were not sore so I could move or sit, as I could do neither.  I was bummed that I physically could not do ANYTHING the day after. I wanted a work out but not one that makes it so I can't continue my routine.
The 2nd time and from then on nothing hurt that bad.  I can still exercise every day now.  THank god. It is not a wimpy exerise video.  I felt like I actually did something afterward.",1235433600,,946,3.9523809523809526

I really enjoyed Bob. He's funny and engaging.  I found myself laughing along. Especially when one of the girls said, ""I wanna kill you Bob!""
I think she meant it. LOL  I used the 10 lb weights with him.
His workouts were good.

The next girl was pure cardio and she was all business. Lots of jumping, plyometrics and bouncing around. I actually broke a sweat with her. I'm no beginner but that was pretty intense.

The last lady, I didn't enjoy her workout as much. I just don't like lots of punches and kicks. I like to move around. I didn't feel as if I was getting enough of a workout. Her workout should have been the first.

Usually I only do Bob and the lady after him. It's a good 30 minute stretch.",1235088000,,792,4.2052980132450335

I will say that if you have weak or bad knees this workout is probably not for you as even the Level 1 workout with Bob consists of alot of lunges.  I love this workout though.. I followed the maximum results guide on the dvd and started with Level one the first 2 weeks and added levels 2 and 3 in 2 week intervals.. Have been doing all three levels plus the warm up 4 days a week and it definitely works! Combining this with healthy eating (lots of fruit, veggies and smaller portions!) I have lost 15 pounds in a little over 2 months.. Started at 150 pounds and now down to 135.. It works you just have to be consistent and stick it out!

Let me say this, level one (20 mins) just kicked my butt!! I was sweating and could feel every muscle in my body being worked! This was without even using the weights (which I did not know this video incorporated).

I am beyond satisfied with this workout DVD and can only imagine what level 2 and 3 are going to bring. I will definately be purchasing more biggest loser DVD's!!",1234828800,,620,4.245762711864407

I didn't think I was completely out of shape as I have been working out consistently since January, four times a week at least, jogging and Pilates. I felt my work out regime needed a boost so I bought this DVD based on all of the good reviews I read here on Aamazon. Those reviews were not kidding. I did my first work out on Saturday and my muscles were still sore this morning (Tuesday). Bob does get a bit annoying once in awhile and I think he just might be a sadomasochist, but he really makes me sweat and curse and sweat and curse. I recommend this. I am on the maximum results program so I let them do the choosing for me. I can't wait to see the results in my body.",1234828800,,705,4.00709219858156

It is easy to follow and the instructors know their audience may be new to the workout and let you know to slow down if you need to do so. ""Just keep moving!"" is what you will hear. If you follow the suggested workout plan, it does help. You can wait longer than 2 weeks, though, to move onto the next level. Give yourself time. I have taken aerobics before, so I figured this might be high intensity from the beginning, but it is graduated. You don't need a step or weights. Weights are great if you have them, but not necessary.",1234137600,,597,4.292035398230088
3202644,5,B000WEVGHA,"This is by far one of the best cardio workouts I have tried. I am 112 pounds and so I don't have much weight to lose, but I barely could keep up with them. So If you have a nice amount of weight to lose I am sure this will be very challenging. I was almost stunned when I was at the end and they said ""Ok, you just finished Level 1"" I thought for sure I had done all the levels by then because it was that challenging for a cardio workout.  A+  Loved it.",1234137600,,454,3.71875
3202645,1,B000WEVGHA,"the ""warmup"" bothered me to the point that i didn't even get to the actual workout.  beware, all the jumping around as a warmup can hurt you...i go from complete slug to workout fiend, and i have tried many types of workout dvds.  what really bugs is how the trainer is so busy bouncing you around that you don't have a chance to do the proper forms and alignments.  if you are already in shape, it isn't too bad, but for a beginner you may find yourself flailing about and may fall.  typically the instructor gives you a clear explanation on form and its importance, in this dvd you just go, and if you don't have a strong sense of balance you will find yourself jerking around trying to not fall on your face.  if you want quick results and a flatter belly immediately post workout try the Lotte Berk Method series, the ""Basic Essentials"" one is perfect.  the Crunch series are pretty good as well, especially the ones with Ellen Bartlet, Super Slim Down Pilates....i get bored easily so i love to try new dvds...this one blows, i always go back to the Lotte Berk and Crunch dvds to really tone up and challenge my muscles.",1233964800,17,1125,4.4106280193236715
3202646,3,B000WEVGHA,"Level 1 by far has the longest routine and it is about intermediate level, but it does not contain enough cardio moves to get your heart rate up.  Personally I found Bob Harper spent too much time trying to impress with his social skills and not enough time in giving instructions on proper forms and techniques.  I found his conversation annoying and I'm glad I have the option to tune him out with the selection of ""music only"".  Out of all 3 levels, the best one by far is level 2, instructed by Jillian Michael, she means business and her routine can really make you sweat. The only complaint I have is that it's only 10 minutes, which is way too short. As for level 3, the instructor does not provide enough variation of moves and I found the routine very unimpressive.  To get my money worth, however, in the future I think I will combine Level 2 and Level 3 to be used as one workout routine.",1233792000,,899,4.333333333333333

Nice that the video could be customized to your level.  You can choose how many and which workout session you want to do in the menu.  Nice to see ""real"" people in the background with the instructor (past Biggest Loser contestants).  Very intense workout.  You will be sweating and your legs will be trembling.

I quickly realized just what I have been missing from my regular routine. This dvd will challenge even the most seasoned workout gurus. You really get a full range workout and work up a good sweat. The one feature I like most is that the instruction is clear and concise. They are not all over the place making it difficult to follow. Very easy to follow.

I know there have been some comments noting the others are off sync, but I think there is nothing wrong with that-- They note as long as you are trying and moving that is all that matters, everyone is going to move at their own pace.rate so its more realistic that they are not in sync.

I will admit, it may be tiring if you first try this and are not in excellent shape, but its worth it because the more you do it, the better off you will feel.

I must say though that I agree with those that said that this is way too tough for people that are overweight and/or completely untrained. For those, the first Biggest Loser workout DVD is a lot more manageable, so master that one first and then move on to this one. Lindsay Brin's Moms into fitness boot camp DVDs are also excellent and combine cardio with strength training, even for those who are not moms.",1232150400,2,650,4.336065573770492

3202663,5,B000WEVGHA,"This dvd has three great workouts to choose from. Each one will get your heart rate up quickly. Bob's 20 minute workout uses some weights (if you choose--there's also the option to not use weights). His workout is my favorite as it is longer than the other two and more challenging overall because of the weight use.
Jillian's workout is good, but I actually think Bob's is harder. Maybe it's because of the length? Jillian's workout is 10 minutes, and you will find yourself doing jumping jacks and a few higher impact exercises along with punches and uppercuts.
Kim's workout is also 10 minutes and incorporates some kickboxing. I feel like the first 5 minutes of hers is fairly easy as you will be doing bob and weave with some punches for half of that time. Around the 5 minute mark, the exercises will definitely get your heart pumping though!

However, for a beginning level, I think the first workout has too much emphasis on lunge and knee bend movements. If you have sensitive knees, I'd pick another workout video. And, I thought this was going to be a workout for beginners where the Biggest Loser participants were still heavy -- but no, they have lost almost all of their weight and have been conditioning for a while, so it really isn't beginning at all. I didn't feel like I could relate to the people in the video like I thought I would. Also, this one is shot inside an aerobics room -- so it's not as pleasing as one shot on a beach or in the mountains. The workout will keep your heart rate up, but I don't think they picked a good workout to make into a video -- there are some small slip ups in instruction from Bob in this one. Overall, Bob did a good job, but I didn't feel like the video was top quality -- it seemed like the makers of the video didn't care to film a few workouts and pick the one that was the best or had the fewest slip ups to make into a marketed video.",1231459200,7,1130,4.117647058823529

I'm excited about this workout and I'm going to share my find with all my workout buddies. I can see why these guys have such great success on the tv show. The workout is not just for the advanced exerciser either which is great. It is set for you to work at your own pace with your own intensity level and the moves don't really seem difficult. The best part is the option to pick and chose which workout segment you want to do. Makes it great for the beginner to start out slow and work your way up.

3202669,1,B000WEVGHA,"I bought this because I am a big fan of the Biggest Loser.  But this exercise dvd was a big disappointment to say the least.  The only way I got anything out of it was to ONLY watch Bob, Jillian, and Kim on how to do the exercises.  The contestants didn't know what they were doing and it made it really hard to follow.  Big waste of money!!!  I will stick with Jillian's dvds from now on.",1229040000,8,389,4.0
3202670,5,B000WEVGHA,"I'm really enjoying this DVD. Above all, I love that the people in the video are not these slim, toned and gym-oholics you see in most workout videos, but rather are people who are in the process of losing weight! Bob is very motivating and makes the workout fun. I'm still on level one after a week and will stay there until I can master it...and I haven't even started using the weights yet. However, I feel better and I can tell that my body is getting an excellent workout from this DVD.

It's nice to see some old faces and the different levels that each of them are at and be able to not feel pathetically out of shape. You know how most workout videos have these perfect background people that do everything perfectly? Well not this dvd. They struggle right alone with you, it's wonderful! And the trainers rock!",1228089600,,431,4.538461538461538

This video is easy to follow and very energizing!  Obviously the people are real and not perfect so it's much more appealing for me!  The workouts are awesome and you know for sure that you've done something good for yourself once you're done! One tip is to make sure you buy some hand weights for this dvd.  I have two-five pound weights and for now that does the trick!  I also have the Power Sculpt version of the DVD set and that one is equally as good!,1226448000,3,604,4.300884955752212

Other than that, it was a good video which included testimonials which I found were unbelievable. I'm no where near that out of shape, but to watch the contestants get into shape, and drop that much weight is inspiring to anyone.",1226361600,,491,4.3478260869565215

He really likes to do side-to-side moves while reaching to your shins/toes.  My advice is to really listen to his instructions and keep your abs in tight because if you don't (like I didn't the first time) your back will be really sore for a couple days and that's a bit scary.  I did go back and do it again, keeping my abs in tight, and the back pain never happened.  So just be a good listener as he instructs you how to do the moves.  You'll definitely work up a great sweat with this DVD!",1225411200,,636,4.172131147540983

Great instruction on how to do the moves correctly so you get the best results...a must for your dvd library.

I always feel as though I've just paid a thousand bucks to get the top trainers to train me in my own livingroom when I turn this on. It's easy to see how these trainers were handpicked to become so well known...their cueing and instruction is just the top of the line. Their motivation is fabulous.

I totally recommend.",1224806400,,325,4.03125
3202682,4,B000WEVGHA,"I love The Biggest Loser show, and like most people struggling with weight loss, I wish I could be on the show. The BL workout videos give you as close of an experience at the Ranch and working out with the trainers as you can get without being there.
Cardio Max is amazing. There are three levels of intensity, allowing you to workout with Bob, Jillian and Kim. The workouts themselves are not boring, they keep you moving and most importantly, keep that heartrate up! If you are completely new to working out, this may be a shock to your system. In that case, I'd recommend starting with the first BL video (all workouts with Bob and the contestants from the first couple seasons), then moving up to the Cardio Max workouts. If you are ready for a bit more for your workout, these workouts won't disappoint. And, working out with the contestants really is fun. These people are just like you and me, and aren't just some skinny fitness experts. They struggle through and sweat just like you will. You will feel like you are in the company of fellow ""Biggest Losers.""",1224547200,,1068,4.538860103626943

I did the biggest loser cardio max video yesterday evening and used the maximum results setting so the video started me off training with bob for my first workout session.  The lunges are KILLER!  I woke up this morning and can't feel anything from waist down.  I now walk like a penquin.  Totally worth buying.,1224028800,3,386,4.457142857142857

I started out with the cardio for two weeks and then started using the sculpting dvd every other day.  I was losing weight with the cardio alone, but the sculpting really sped up the process.

3202687,2,B000WEVGHA,"Ok so I love the show and the trainers but just because they are good on the show does not mean they know how to make a great fitness video. I think most can agree that with Jillian it's been a process, her videos have solid content to get you in shape but lack the motivation to get you there. This can be said for Jillian Michaels for Beginners - Frontside/Backside (2-Disc DVD Set) I found it to be plain. Basically if you're a beginner and you want a fun and exciting exercise DVD don't go with any of the Biggest Loser. These trainers lack the ""know how""(on how to make a fitness video) and the charisma to motivate you, if your just beginning go with other videos made by trainer who have been around a while like: Kathy Smith, Tamilee Webb and Denise Austin. They know how to get you moving. If you don't mind a solid uninspiring workout then this is for you.",1222646400,2,866,4.254545454545455
3202688,4,B000WEVGHA,"I love this cardio workout. It is lacking a warm up and cool down, but if you're imaginative and work out regularly you probably already have your favorite warm up and cool down routines. This video is great, whether you're just beginning, or you just want some decent cardio before moving on to weight or ab training. You control the intensity by increasing the weight which makes it great no matter what your mood. This video will definitely lift your buttocks a couple of inches.",1222560000,,482,4.682352941176471

I agree with some other reviews that Cardio Level 3 is a bit of a letdown with Kim but quite honestly, by the time I get to Level 3 after doing the other 2 levels with Bob and Jillian, I'm bushed.  I think this is a wonderful DVD for all fitness levels.  Since I typically exercise 5 days a week to other workout DVDs (sometimes incorporating the other 2 Biggest Loser DVDs), I just opted to do the entire workout from warmup to cooldown incorporating all 3 cardio levels in between.

Usually I will do one routine since they are so effective, but on some days I will double a section or mix the sections up between the instructors. Really enjoy the weights section.

I am 23 years old and bought this dvd for me and my mom to get into shape.  Since we are on such different physical levels, normally we can't work out together.  However, this dvd allows us to work out together by including all different levels in the dvd!  Also, I am a huge fan of Bob from the biggest loser, but after this dvd, I love him even more.  He is so motivational and helps you to get through the workout and back in the next day!!",1221436800,,613,4.058333333333334
3202693,5,B000WEVGHA,"I love this DVD, I work out with it pretty much every night.  I like that you can customize your work out by selecting from different 5 - 20 minute segments.  Then you can put them in the order you want.  Choosing to do a warm up, 20 mins of level one, cool down, for a quick 30 min workout.  Or you can choose another combination for it to go up to an hour.

I have bad knees so there are a couple thigs I'm unable to do, but I just altered what they were doing, so that I'm still moving and get a great workout! :) Also, you gotta love looking at Bob! ;)",1221350400,,556,3.8

Since then, we have done this almost every night, and we swear by it. I am leaner than I have been in years (I'm only 24) and I have more abs than I thought I was capable of attaining! We have each lost over 10 pounds in the past 6 weeks, and if anything, we have increased what we eat.  We were just not going to the gym (out of laziness and time constraints) we needed something easy that we could do at any hour of the day. It is great, 30-50 minutes and we have an amazing workout and are pouring sweat.

3202696,5,B000WEVGHA,Bob Harper really gets the blood pumping and the sweat flowing. I use this workout with the Biggest Loser Power Scuplt on alternate days for a total body workout.

3202697,5,B000WEVGHA,"I really like this DVD. I'm 31 and weighed 291 lbs. when I started it. When I first started doing it I could only do the 5 mins. warm up and I was already sweating. The next day I did 5 mins. warm up and 10 mins. of the actual level 1. I stopped when Bob started doing the push ups. The 3rd day I only did 8 mins. worth. However, the 4th day I felt guilty for not giving it a decent chance and pushed myself to do the entire level 1. Level 1 is tough, but if I did it being 5'2 291 lbs. then anyone should be able to do it. I mean seriously! I personally don't like doing push ups so when they all hit the ground I do something else, but still keep working out. I still haven't gotten to level 2 or 3 and probably won't for a while. I'm taking it slow. I just recently started using dumbbells for more of a cardio workout like they suggest. All in all, I've been using it for 1 month straight with weekends off and now I'm weighing in at 278.2 lbs. I've been eating healthy and not starving myself. Those 30 mins. of work out have really helped. I do the 5 mins. warm up, then the 20 mins. cardio and lastly the 5 mins. cool down. I am sweating like crazy and I love it.",1220313600,11,1170,3.858921161825726
3202698,5,B000WEVGHA,"This was by far the hardest workout I have done.  I was sweating like crazy and was definately sore the next day.  I think this video does a great job of keeping your body working, although it's hard to follow Bob's segment as many of the Biggest Losers are off sync or not doing the full movement.  But, if you just put your own effort into it, you'll do fine.  I highly recommend this video!",1220227200,,393,4.2
3202699,5,B000WEVGHA,"This DVD is really great to build your cardio. It allows you to costomize your workout. So, if you only have 20 minutes, you can still squeeze in an intense workout. But, if you have 40 minutes, it also allows for a longer workout. I would recommend it for both beginners and for those who have been working out and are looking for a DVD that will allow you to get in an intense workout when time is an issue.",1220227200,,409,4.125
3202700,3,B000WEVGHA,"Bob's workout is by far the best of the three, as it is short enough to get it out of the way, yet long enough to get results if done consistently.  Good variety of exercises, and you could use this as a strength/cardio component to add to a Callanetics or yoga workout.

What I didn't like about this workout:

Few form pointers:  Bob briefly performs each exercise, and mentions form pointers, but out of all the exercisers, only 1 or 2 are even approaching proper form, which is not good as the camera is usually focused on the others who are nowhere near it.

No indication of the correct pace or cadence at which to perform the exercises when you do get up to speed--it is very easy to overwork one side at the expense of the other. He seems to be working in 30-second segments at times, but not all the time. He also counts backwards, which is fine except you don't know where you're starting from.

If you have knee problems and/or are in similar physical condition to the BL contestants on the DVD you will want to modify the movements somewhat. There are a lot of squats, knee bends and some jumping.

The other two workouts with Jillian and Kim have the same problems with lack of proper form pointers and a lot of squats and knee bends, and some jumping. They are only 10 minutes each, so it may or may not be an issue for some people. Bob's workout uses light weights, the other two do not. You can do most of the workouts on carpet if you have to, but be careful.

The cool down did not have nearly enough stretching in it to be worth doing.

When they come out with the next DVD they need to have a short section where Bob demonstrates proper form (both from the front and the side), include some exercises which can get your heart rate up without being so hard on the knees, and put more actual stretching into the cool down.

3.5 stars, but rent it first.",1219795200,8,1871,4.2897727272727275

Some people don't like that the people aren't in sync or that there is kind of a lack musical beat, but I love that fact because you can slow down and speed up to meet your bodies needs.  The workout is harder if you work harder.  But coming from child birth I found I still got a good workout following it at a slower pace.  The workouts can range from 20 to 50 minutes depending on what you have time for (or what your kids have time for).  I really love this workout.",1219622400,,638,4.023809523809524

What truely made a difference was just getting outside and walking everyday.  Now that I have three kids, I find it harder to get out to walk everyday.  Love the biggest loser show and really like the trainers.  Decided to try their workout dvd and absolutely love it.  Not only does Bob, Jillian and Kim make me sweat...I could feel every muscle being worked after the first workout with Bob on level 1.  Really had me sweating and I love the encouragement you get from the trainers.  Not to mention, it is great to see the contestants form biggest loser on the video.  Most of the time when watching a workout dvd everyone is fit and personally does nothing for me.  They are not feeling the strain that I am...so it makes me ask myself, why is it so hard for me?

I never realized that you actually do have to work ever harder to LOSE weight! So,I ordered this dvd and its awesome! If you do all 3 in a row,including the warm up and cool down,its 50 minutes and you will feel it.

No boring and stale background with a soothing voice talking you through the steps or an overly peppy woman in a skin tight leotard bouncing around telling you that ""You can do it!"". Most of us who buy these videos are overweight and while I can appreciate an athletic person, it's hard to really get into a group of perfectly fit people who appear to be aerobic instructors. I like the ""real"" feel of the Biggest Loser crew and seeing Bob in just a shirt and shorts. It's also refreshing to see part of his crew who are out of sync because usually I am! Bob's continuous talking through the moves about how to make them harder (or easier) is also of great benefit - you can step it up if you're up to it and if you're dying, you can tone it down for a second without stopping.

Definitely NOT easy.  I do enjoy this video for several reasons.  First, they do offer lower impact options for each movement, which is nice if I seem to be lacking in energy on a perticular day.  Second, I get to work out with people who are struggling the same way I am with the routines (breathing heavy, losing balance, etc.).
The only thing that I was disappointed with was the fact that Bob doesn't actually do the workout with you.  He gives you instructions and pointers but seems to just walk around and observe.  I'd prefer to see him working out as well.

3202716,5,B000WEVGHA,"I really enjoyed this dvd. I love the ability to customize the workout. You do the 5 min. warm up, then you can do level 1 cardio with Bob which lasts for 20 min. or level 2 with Jillian which is 10 min or level 3 with Kim which is also 10 min. and then the 5 min cool down. I thought that the level 2 workout was actually a little more challenging than level 3 but thats just me. You can gradually build up to doing all 3 levels at one time or break them up so they fit your fitness level or time constraints. It gets your heart going and you will sweat no matter how you break it down.",1215129600,2,587,3.819672131147541
3202717,4,B000WEVGHA,"I love the people in the background. I like the style of the leading, not so much choreography to keep up with as with some cardio DVD's. You see the people in the background going at their own pace,and everyone is still sweating. You can move slower or faster if you want to, and you really feel like you are controlling your own workout. The first workout is very challenging, and the hardest one is probably level 2. To do the first two is to get a really solid work out in- the third workout is not level three challenge- wise, but it is an extra ten minutes tacked on when you already are feeling pretty exhausted. I would reccomend doing the first two workouts, and then  half an hour of strength training from some other DVD to really balance it out.",1215129600,,757,4.330985915492958
3202718,5,B000WEVGHA,"You guys. For real. This DVD is GREAT. Like many of the other reviewers I am in very good shape (cardio/yoga/Turbo Jam 5xs/wk). I was excited to try this and I was not disappointed. Bob's section is DEFINITELY the most challenging and not just for the length (20 mins). It will kill you the next day but stick with it! Jillian's section (10 mins) is good too and Kim's (10 mins) is the simplest. I actually incorporate some Turbo Jam moves into her kickboxing routine to maximize my results.

How they've structured the DVD is that Bob is easiest, then Jillian, then Kim. But it should be the opposite. So for someone starting out maybe they'd be more comfortable doing Kim, Jill, then Bob. I did all three the first time and lordy was I glad to get to Kim's easier section!

You will NOT be disappointed with this DVD. IT ROCKS!!!!",1214956800,,832,4.467105263157895
3202719,1,B000WEVGHA,"I really wanted to like this video since I love the show and use DVD's for my home workouts. My major problem with this video is that you go from working out at full speed to just standing there stretching. It really makes me feel like I am going to pass out.

There are 3 levels of workouts (1, 2 and 3), but I think all are equally tough!  :)  The DVD has a program that puts you on a plan for 6 weeks, but you can change the workouts as you prefer, so it's really interactive.  The trainers are very motivating and the Biggest Loser cast works out with the trainers, too, so it's quite inspiring.  I bought this DVD because I wanted a good cardio workout and trust me, it's one of th best I own and I work out with it every other day and it's still challenging.  I recommend this product to anyone just wanting to get their program jump-started and to work off those extra pounds.  I was just looking to get back in the routine, not lose anything crazy, but I really think it's effective.  And it's fun, which is the most important thing!",1213056000,2,880,4.259036144578313
3202726,5,B000WEVGHA,"This is great because you can customize you workout. You can choose as many or as few of the workouts depending on your fitness or endurance level. There is the warm-up, Bob's level 1, Jillian's level 2, and Kim's level 3, and the cool down. You can do just one or repeat one of your favorite 3 times if you like. You can also do 2 or all three workouts in a row. You just get so many options this way. My family loves it along with the Power Sculpt that works the same way. Bob's workout seems the hardest but most motivating. We will do all 3 workouts when were feeling strong and need the extra calorie burn.

We own all the Biggest Looser dvds and they are all good workouts, just in different ways. It's great to have alot to mix and match. But I'd have to say, if you just starting your collection. This one and the Power Sculpt will be a good choice. You'll really melt the fat! If your fitness level is very low, start with The Biggest Looser Workout Vol. 1.

Now I alternate this DVD in conjunction with Tracey Anderson's Dance Aerobics as a 5 day a week routine. Level 1 does not raise my heart rate above 120 bpm however level 2 gets me up to 150 bpm. I am yet to try level 3. I like that Level 1 works my thighs and buns like nothing else and I like the variety as the exercises change every 10-20 seconds. I really like Bob and Jillian, they have a natural ability to push you to your limits with understanding and humour. Well worth the small amount it cost me.",1212537600,2,607,3.9836065573770494

The workouts together are pretty solid.  I feel that Level 1 is the only that could stand alone as a good heart pumpin interval workout; and even better when paired with Level 2. The last installment, the boxing one, was kinda weak, even as a cool down set.
Overall, a great low impact workout, especially for those who are just starting out, whether for the first time or after a long hiatus.  If you exercise regularly and have for many years, I cannot recommend this one.",1212019200,,703,4.608

I think of myself as in pretty good shape, but the Level 1 workout left me more sore after a workout than I have been in a long time! Clearly it is targeting different muscle groups. As other reviewers have noted, I found the Level 1 to be a pretty good workout. One of the participants uses low impact techniques while others do some higher impact work so you can customize the workout somewhat by choosing who to follow.
For those with Comcast cable, the level 1 workout for both this DVD and the Power Sculpt DVD are available On Demand in the exercise/fitness section so you can get a preview of what the DVDs are like.",1211414400,2,760,4.435714285714286

3202738,4,B000WEVGHA,"I love this DVD!!! Let me first say I am not by any means excessively overweight (I am 5'2 and 146lbs). I used to be 120lbs until I had my son and I never lost the weight. Im tired of being big so I bought the dvd thinking that if these people are over weight then this would be a good pace for me.
  I like that the people in the videos are people from the past seasons. One thing I hate seeing in a workout video is people who are already in shape. They make me fee like I wil never get to where they are. Seeing the sturggle that these people have gone through give me assurance that I can do this too. I also like the way that it breaks it down in to seperate weeks. Also no one is ever together in the workout and the instructor is really funny.
  The only thing I think is negative about the video is, as I said I am not too terribly big but I am out of shape. These people on the dvd may be bigger but since they were on the show they are in better shape than I am and when you pick up the dvd your thinking it will start you out with baby steps.... DON'T think that because you are wrong!!! Even the first weeks exercises are brutal, I poured sweat and had to take a couple breaks to shake off the muscle burn. All in all a very good buy!!",1210896000,5,1247,3.840466926070039
3202739,4,B000WEVGHA,"This was a good workout, and easy to navigate. Some of the exercises, even in the beginning section, are very hard. I'm betting that the cast probably couldn't do anything like it when they got to the ranch.",1210896000,,207,4.473684210526316
3202740,5,B000WEVGHA,"This one is a must have! I love it! Level 1 is hard but can be completed by beginners. Level 2&3 are good, but I think I'm still worn out from level 1 by then.  I have never seen such amazing results from a 20 min workout. When I started, I lost 7 lbs my first week just doing Level 1!  Now I mix it up and do 2 of the levels, but I'm about to start the PowerSculpt DVD.",1210809600,,370,3.6125
3202741,4,B000WEVGHA,"I am a little over weight for my height and hate going to the gym. I was told I needed to exercise daily... and OH I hate working out...

I bought the dvd and tried it. It's been 3 weeks and I think the difference I see is endurance. I could not keep up for the life of me when I started. I basically did the warm up, straight to the cool down. (You can laugh but I am weak!) Little by little I was able to follow with the program and I like that you can add the level as you go. I am still at level 2... I am actually trying to keep up at that level.

I think this dvd would be perfect if you want to work out at home. The first level is very hard but just work at it everyday and you'll see a difference.

The only thing I don't like is that there is no stretching exercises and if I don't stretch on my own, my muscles tense up. Also I with there was a  longer cool down... it doenst feel good when the cool down starts right after a very intense work out.",1210550400,2,959,3.756218905472637
3202742,4,B000WEVGHA,"I think several of the excellent reviews have established that this is definitely a challenging workout even for those of us who think that we are in relatively good shape. I think this is a great workout if you've hit a plateau--it's definitely helping me and inspite of the negatives I'm going to list, I still am using it because the positives definitely outweigh the negatives. You will feel parts of your glutes and quads for several days!!
The reasons I didn't give it 5-stars are as follows.
Cardio level 1: Bob is great with the routines--they are definitely challenging.  Just like the previous Biggest Loser workout, there's no sense of 'being in sinc'--I just choose my pace and stick with it because nobody keeps up with the music--not that the music is much to begin with.  I am also used to the 'mirror image' concept, i.e, when the trainer says got to your right they are actually going to their left so both the viewer and participants are going in the same direction.  Not so here--you have to pay attention if you want to stay somewhat syncronized.
Level 2:  Jillian is quite relentless and you get no breaks for 10 solid minutes. No major problems here.
Level 3:  This is the disappointing one. As noted in other reviews, it's not harder than the other two levels--I am honestly a little grateful for that because I don't think I could do it if it was harder--after the first two levels, my legs are protesting big time.  It does get a little hard towards the end.  I found Kim irritating.  She appears unnaturally happy.  I counted 6-8 times that she repeated, 'This is your cardio session/workout'--it gets very annoying.  I am a big Turbo Jam fan so I found the kickboxing routines somewhat awkward at times.  In one of the routines, you have to watch your knees if you are on carpet otherwise you could twist them causing injury.
All in all, definitely worth buying.",1210550400,31,1889,4.625748502994012
3202743,5,B000WEVGHA,"I have always been disappointed with workout videos, and I love this one.  It's a great workout, and I love that it packs a lot of cardio into a short amount of time.  Bob is great and I am seeing results.",1210204800,,205,3.975609756097561
3202744,5,B000WEVGHA,"I absolutely love this video!  I've used MANY workout DVDs and this is the first one that really kicks my butt.  I alternate this video with the Power Sculpting one, and I've lost 10 lbs and lots of inches in two months.  I feel fantastic!  Every time I put it in the DVD player I know that I am going to get a great sweat going.  Plus, the DVD gives you something to work up to, so don't feel bad if you can't do the all of the moves or levels at first.  I couldn't either, but I'm getting there now!

Bob's section is level 1, and make sure you have at least a pair of 5 lb weights for this.  It involves a lot of squats and push-ups and jumping.  Jillian has level 2 which was incredibly difficult for me to do after level 1 at first.  It's basically 10minutes of plyometrics, or jumping exercises.  The third section by Lyons is kickboxing.  I personally don't think it should be level three, it isn't as difficult as the other ones, but it is somewhat difficult after doing the first two levels beforehand.

You can also customize you workout.  So you can choose to do Level 1, skip Level 2, and do Level 3. Also on the DVD are inspiration stories from the Biggest Loser cast, which workout in the DVD. I loved that they were the ones working out and not some stick thin actors.  They were sweating and grunting right along with me! :)

I HIGHLY suggest this video if you want a tough, challenging workout that delivers fast results.  I reccommend doing it with the Power Sculpt DVD, too!",1209600000,2,1493,4.2562277580071175

3202752,5,B000WEVGHA,"I ordered this expecting it would kick my butt and I have not been disappointed!  I have yet to make it all the way through level one and it is very hard!  For those reviewers who say it's not for beginners, I would say ""You're right, if you're a beginner who has never seen the show and have no idea what to expect!"". This video is cake compared to what those folks on the show go through.  You will hurt, you will sweat, you might even swear, but you will see results if you keep with it!  I am not discouraged that I can't make it through Bob's level one because he is constantly reminding me that I am doing my best.  I appreciate that I am not the only one struggling as I watch the real people in the background sweating and huffing and puffing.  While it can be a tad distracting that they have problems with timing, I find it a comforting reminder that they are not toothpick skinny Barbies and have really struggled to get where they are. They are giving 110%.  I can't say this is a FUN workout, but is effective and I am proud of myself when I collapse on the floor in a puddle of sweat because I have gotten just a little farther than I did last time and blasted some nasty fat!
I really like that you can customize your workout, though Kim's 10 minute cardio left me cold when I previewed this.  I don't care for her personality, but that's just me.  I like that you can add levels as you work up to them and don't have to try for it all at once.  There is even a maximum results feature that tells you about how many weeks into the program to add the next level.  I am one of those who can do the same thing forever, even if I am no longer getting any benefit, just because I'm finally comfortable with the moves, so this is great for me!  A reminder that it may be time to move on.
Bob does level one and he is great, very motivating and always free with encouragement.
Jill is your level two instructor and she's a bit rougher on you.  She is encouraging, but also quick to tell you to get your rear in gear.  If you've ever seen the show, she is much nicer here!
Kim is level three and, as I've stated above, she leaves me a bit cold.  Her workout flies by, and may be the most fun of the three, but she's a bit perky and artificial for me.  Sorry Kim!  Again, that's just me.
Bob's yoga cool down is wonderful, though I would love more there.  You work yourself silly no matter how much you do, then the cool down doesn't quite stretch and relax enough.
All in all, a great DVD for the price, I highly reccomend this if you have any clue about the show and know what to expect!",1208476800,2,2595,4.0848126232741615

I loved it though.  And even if you are a beginner exerciser, don't despair. The tape is so encouraging and motivating and the actual movements are very easy to follow so you just can do what you can and slowly build up endurance.

A great video mixing cardio and muscle toning. Bob's section (the bulk of the workout at 20 min) is the MOST intense. Jillian's 10 min segment is not a breeze either. Kim's 10 min of cardio kickboxing is the easiest though if you do that section last, it's still hard! GREAT DVD",1208390400,,670,4.21875

This DVD delivers! It's fun, the moves are easy to do and very effective. What I particularly appreciate is that they're great for any workout space. I was in a small apartment when I first started using this &  unlike other DVD's-space  was not a problem. This moves were choreographed away from walls and furniture - a refreshing bonus!

It's also made me a better runner - my quads and core have gotten much much stronger!

3202758,5,B000WEVGHA,"So I am hugely overweight, and just had a baby. I thought that I would give this video a try, and I LOVE it. I am still on the level 1 work out, but am getting better every day. I can now do the whole 30 minute level 1 work out. Next week I am going to be adding level 2. In only 2 1/2 weeks I have lost 14 inches and 12 lbs. Now I still have 80 to go, but it is a good start. Bob does the level 1, and he keeps me motivated thru the whole work out. Right when I think I am about to die, he starts counting down, and tells me I can do it, and I believe him. Rather than sitting on my couch hoping the Biggest Loser comes and casts me, I decided that the more logical option would be to bring the biggest loser trainers to me. I would recommend this to everyone, from those who only have 10 lbs to lose to people like me who have 50+.",1207612800,312,833,3.659217877094972
3202759,5,B000WEVGHA,"A little background; I've been working out religiously since the second week of Jan 08 combining 3 days of cardio with 3 days of circuit training with weights.  My cardio consisted of 30 min of interval training on my elliptical and 30 min on my bike.  Weights are a total body workout with dumbbells.  With a combination of working out and eating right, I've managed to drop 15lbs but just recently I've noticed I hit a plateau.  I was talking to my sister about my recent stall in weight loss so she let me borrow the Cardio Max DVD to give me a change of pace.

Last Friday, I pop the DVD in, strap on my heart rate monitor (because I wanted to make sure I was working out intense enough) and arrogantly decide to jump into the the ""Week 2-4"" intensity level (which is Level 1 and 2).  I think I was about 10 minutes into the Level 1 workout with Bob and I was dying.  My heart rate was reaching 170 bpm and my legs were burning; and I wasn't using any weights!!  After the warmup and Level 1 I had to quit.  I woke up the next morning and my legs, hind end and abs were sore!  It was great!

This is a great workout but will require someone new to the world of fitness to work up to fully being able to complete the levels (which is the whole point).  The DVD is mapped out for a 6-8 week timeline.  The instructors make it very clear if you can't keep up, then somehow move to keep your heart rate up and join back in when you're comfortable.  There's one specific girl in the video (sorry don't know names) that does an alternative version of the exercise for someone less athletic (i.e. push-ups on your knees, fake jump rope, no weights).  Trust me, if you keep up with this DVD you will see results and feel better!",1207526400,30,1724,4.181818181818182

3202764,5,B000WEVGHA,"I have never seen the TV show and I'm not overweight.  I lift three times a week here at home and since I canceled my gym membership I haven't been doing any cardio (I used to use the elliptical machine for that).  I hate cardio and since I'm pretty lean to begin with, I didn't mind dropping it from my routine.  But then I noticed a teeny bit of a spare tire beginning to form which freaked me out so I figured I better buck up and find a cardio workout.  I didn't want to have to get all kinds of new equipment and I didn't want an overly-perky, irritating instructor barking orders at me.  I went through a couple of other DVD's (which sucked) before reading the reviews here and since they were generally all very positive reviews, I decided to give it a go.

I have not been disappointed so far.  The exercises are simple to learn but are also extremely challenging.  Bob's warm up and level one workouts really get me sweating.  Even though one of the cast members demonstrates a low-impact version of the workouts, I would definitely not recommend this for complete novices.  You should already be familiar with your body and what it can take.

The other two workouts might not seem that challenging by themselves, but all three are supposed to be performed in a row (eventually).  You start with the warm up and level one workout, then add level two, and finally level three.  There is also a cool-down workout so in the end you'll be doing five workouts in a row for a total of about 50 minutes.  That's a tough workout!  I'm only on level one and I can't wait to get through the whole thing.

The instructors are fairly tolerable and not over-the-top Barbie dolls, but I find that the cast members make the workouts more fun.  Being a pretty cynical kind of guy, I was ready to ""make fun of the fatties"", but they're clearly having such a good time and I can really appreciate that they've done something to get themselves into shape without slavishly trying to become ""skinny"".  A section called ""Inspirational Stories"" showcases some of their success stories from the show and their journeys are quite impressive.  So I liked that rather than robotic fitness clones, there were some real people with different body types and goals all there having fun and working up a sweat along with you and sometimes goofing or falling behind.  It lets you know that this isn't a choreography lesson, it's a workout, and that it's more important to keep your heart rate going than worry about staying in lockstep with everyone else.

The coolest thing about the DVD is that you can design your own workouts.  You can select the pre-set workouts for weeks 1-2, 3-4 and 5-6 that take all the guesswork out and play the workouts in the appropriate order.  But you can also create your own workout kind of like a video jukebox.  If you have your own warm up routine and want to skip the one on the DVD, you can, then select level one, or levels two and three together, or levels one and three, etc.  This makes it very flexible and keeps you from getting too bored with the same workout.  I do yoga after cardio, so I generally skip Bob's cool-down workout.  At some point I might want to replace the level one workout and do level two twice, plus the warmup.

You can also play the workouts with or without the instructor's voice track and have just the music, which leads me to my one quibble...  the music is NOT very energetic.  It's got a tempo you can use to keep time, but it's just ""dramatic"" instrumental reality show music, not really something to get you moving.  I prefer high-energy dance music or at least something fun that I know the words to, but this is easily fixed since I just turn down the video volume and play my own cardio playlist on itunes.  But still, I think a good cardio workout should have some high energy music behind it.

I haven't given it five stars because of the music and because I'm too new at it to see if it really yield results, but if my first two weeks are any indication, I'm sure it will work great and I'll be back soon to change the rating.",1207180800,2,4086,4.427041499330656

I love how quickly the workout goes by and the ability to change the levels for your workout. I hate doing cardio and this is so much fun and much better than being stuck on a treadmill - with the same results - getting your heart rate pumping! I also love the yoga cooldown because I am a yoga fantatic. This boot camp style workout is fast paced and hardcore! It does not bother me that it is not in sync like the other people mentioned - I am hardly coordinated myself! You can follow the different people for modified versions of the workout.

3202771,4,B000WEVGHA,"This is a great DVD for those of us who need an effective workout in a hurry.  I love the fact that I can customize the program to fit my needs.  Most days I play Bob's 5-minute warm-up and Jillian's 10-minute cardio routine.  On really busy days when the kids just won't leave me alone I'll just do the 10-minutes of cardio.  If I have more time I can do Bob's 20-minute level I, which is not as easy as one might think!

This DVD takes away any excuse I have to skip exercise.  Surely I can find 10 minutes to work out.  Heck, even the 5-minute warm-up would do me good if I were that crunched for time.  There may be better workouts available, but if they are 40+ minutes long, I know I will NEVER do them.

I agree with previous posters that Kim's ""Level III"" workout is probably the easiest one on the disc.  My heart rate goes higher and stays higher during both Bob's and Jillian's workouts than this one...even when I push myself to expend maximum effort.  I use her segment for days when I don't feel well and am not up to jumping around and getting out of breath.

Unfortunately my brand-new disc was damaged and I am unable to view the cool down or the ""Inspiring Stories"".  I just kept it because of the cost and inconvenience associated with exchanging it.",1206057600,,1269,4.281512605042017

i was pretty out of shape before jump starting my exercise routine with this dvd, and it's definitely helped me feel better about myself, i'm definitely more toned already than i was almost two months ago (but i'm no jillian yet!), and i just recently combined this workout with the power sculpt dvd (which i really love as well!)

i'd agree with some of the other reviewers, in that bob's workout (level 1), some of the exercises were definitely pretty tough for being a ""level 1"", but that was all the more reason for me to push myself to do them well, and with correct form.

I had the original Biggest Loser workout DVD, and as I said in my review then, it was distracting that everyone was off-rhythm. For some reason, the producers of these DVDs must think that's a plus, because it's even worse here, where they're all *obviously* out of sync and all over the place. ""Do I have my arms up or down on this beat? The woman in front has her arms down, but the guy right behind has his up...' It looks sloppy and it's harder to follow than it should be. Using real people is fine, but they should cast people who have a sense of rhythm.

My back does not hurt after completing the routine, but weights were not used as much either (plus I only used the 5lb weights today). Bob does the level I, 20 minute work-out and he regularly reminds the participant to consider the core to prevent back injury. He is very thorough and quite tough. Of course, Julianne also kicks butt. Kim was all right, but I am not a huge fan of hers anyways. I do feel the warm up is intense, but the cool down using Yoga feels great after the work-out. I like the ability to select the order and levels to include for your work-out (I did maintenance). I do recommend this work-out DVD for all levels. The trainers do indicate how to keep the intensity lower if you are not in great shape. All you have to do is watch Julie during the work-out and follow her. It is important to remember that if it was not difficult, then there would not be a benefit to doing it. I purchased these work-out DVDs to help mix up my rountines a bit, since I think my body has become stagnant at the moment. It is an awesome work-out that you should give a try, only if you are really serious.",1202601600,4,1741,4.3765432098765435

This DVD delivers what it promises, a heart pumping cardio workout. With dynamic moves and the encouragement of Bob, Jillian and Kim you really work up a sweat with each session.

After reading all the reviews, I also thought it would be really intense and would give me a good workout.  I was disappionted.  First of all, there are WAY too many strength moves.  Too many squats and Bob has you using weights.  I wanted cardio, not strength.  Secondly, I don't think that it gets your heartrate up enough.  As someone who runs several times a week, I was barely breathing hard.  Out of all the workouts, Jillian's is probably the best in this DVD for doing what is advertises-Cardio and Max.  If you are new to exercising or looking for a challenge from your moderate workouts, this is probably for you.

If you are a beginner though, you may want to skip the light weights that several people are using, and modify some of the movements. Bob is really good at cueing you though and encouraging you to just keep moving. Jillian leads level 2 and in her usual style really keeps it ramped up, but still fun. I haven't done level 3 yet even though I work out often, because I want to really have the first 2 levels down first. Very challenging, fun workout.

3202804,5,B000WEVGHA,"I have several work out videos and of course have my favorites.  This raced right to the top of my favorites list.

What I love about this...  You have options and control.  I am in shape and this thing gave me a run for my money.  I LOVE this DVD.  It is so great because you actually get multiple workouts in one DVD - more value for the $.

My usual criticism of other workout DVD's is they jump right in with poor instruction and move way too fast to even learn the routine.  You won't get that here.  The moves are ""reasonable"" and it is easy to follow the instruction.  Great camera work.

Another gripe of mine about other workout DVD's is poor cueing.  All of the workouts here are WELL cued.  You won't find your head spinning wondering how you missed the switch to a new move.

They do a great job of having real people with real weight loss needs actually doing the workout.  This also does a very nice job of keeping you motivated to start and finish it.  I actually look forward to doing this video.

Finally, each work out can easily be modified to decrease or increase the intensity.  You can choose to use hand weights or not.  You can also increase the strength training this offers by increasing the weight you use.  For this reason I think that this ""aerobic fat burn workout"" could easily give you some good strength training as well.",1201478400,4,1354,4.34

The time flies by really fast and when you are done you feel as though you have had a good work out. There are three levels to choose from. The whole level one workout (which includes warm-up, cardio, and yoga cool down) is about 40 minutes. Just the cardio part is 25 minutes. You can choose to do it without trainer instruction and just music, but the one down side is that the  music is AWFUL! But if you use your mp3 player or play your own music it doesn't really matter anyway. Overall I love this dvd. I will be using it for a very long time!",1201219200,,646,4.007751937984496
3202807,5,B000WEVGHA,"I love this workout.  It is tough!  The sweat factor is very high.  Bob Harper is very motivating as are Jillian and Kim!  Over this past summer I was able to lose my pregnancy weight (60 lbs) in part by doing the Biggest Loser Workout - Vol 1 (which I also love). So, I was excited when the new DVD workouts were released.  After having done Cardio Max several times, I would recommend this DVD only to individuals that have been exercising for a while.  If you are new to exercise, you may want to start with Biggest Loser Workout Volume 1 (lead entirely by Bob). The workouts in that DVD are very demanding but not as vigorous as the Cardio Max DVD.
  The only complaints that I have with Cardio Max is that the cueing is sometimes off and as other people have mentioned the cast is not usually in sync with one another and that can be distracting. Otherwise, I highly recommend this DVD if you have been exercising for awhile.",1201132800,,930,4.335260115606936

The only thing I skipped on it was Jillian (because her bully style of training isn't for me and I end up annoyed watching her and it takes away my focus).  But even without that, just the Bob workout alone is intense and the end with Kim is effective too.  If you are just beginning, it's still a good workout, just use common sense and adjust the exercises you aren't comfortable with to fit you.

3202811,2,B000WEVGHA,"As someone with weight issues, I have bought several DVDs over the years with moderate difficulty. So, when I saw this DVD was coming out, I was excited to get a workout that would be challenging, yet in line with the needs and abilities of someone overweight.

All I can say is: OW. The ""Level 1"" work out and even the warm up are very hard core. In fact, all I could think about was the thought of whether or not some of my friends in average shape could even do these work outs without falling over. Like someone noted earlier, there is pretty much NO warm up...it is basically an intense mini work out.

My main reason for writing this review is to warn people about the push up exercise that Bob has you do in the Level 1. Seriously?! I found that to be more for someone in the higher-end moderate to advanced level of fitness. After doing that workout, I pulled something in my chest and it hurt for a good 2 days.

The style is nice and not too cheesy, and I did like the Yoga cool down. However, for a show that caters towards helping obese people become fit, I was disappointed in what I saw as unrealistic expectations for a beginner.",1200787200,155,1144,4.2626728110599075

3202813,3,B000WEVGHA,"I was surprised by the ""warm up"" section. It's more like a mini workout! Bob has you jumping up and down immediately. I wonder, if someone was really overweight, if they could even get thru the warm up. The Level 1 workout was harder than I expected from the perspective of a tape that caters to overweight, out-of-shape people. I would hope it wouldn't turn people away from working out with this tape a second time!

I was disappointed by the cool down. I am a stretch class teacher, and would have liked to see a longer cool down, with more actual stretches rather than a standing yoga class. During the workout segment we worked our quads heavily, but didn't stretch them at all during the cool down!",1200700800,13,704,4.5

I lost and have kept off nearly 100 pounds for the past 5 years.  I am a competitive runner, enjoy workouts from The Firm, TaeBo, and Cathe F., and I also jump rope for at least 1 workout session per week.

I purchased Cardio Max to add a bit of variety to my routine over the winter months and because the contestants are so inspirational.  I was not, however, expecting such a heart pumping workout.  I enjoy that you can customize the workout into various combinations of the 3 levels.  I thought Jillian's session was the most intense.  A suggested ""hour of power"" is the Warmup, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Level 2, and then the cool down.

I could probably talk my boyfriend into trying Cardio Max with me one day.  The workout is not dancey--at all--and there are equal numbers of men and women.",1200268800,14,846,4.4
3202817,5,B000WEVGHA,"Early December 2007, after watching the amazing results from the Biggest Loser Television show, I decided to purchase both the The Biggest Loser Workout: Power Sculpt & Cardio Max.

They came in the mail later December so since January 1st of 2008 I have been working out with both DVDs and have since lost a few pounds and my friends have noticed a difference in my performance in sports and walking and thinning around my face. With 155 pounds to lose I am on a good start. Working out and eating correctly is the biggest key. The DVDs will not help you trim up and loose weight. You have to work out and manage your food intake as well.

On a personal note, I believe in a few months i will look back on this experience and say they (the Biggest Loser Club DVDs) saved my life. You have to get these if you want to see some at home changes in your life.",1200182400,6,856,4.213414634146342
3202818,4,B000WEVGHA,"I liked the first Biggest Loser Workout DVD. This one has a few improvements.  First the customizable option is truly customizable. If you want to do the the first 20 minute workout (lower intensity) 3 times in a row you can.  You are able to truly choose your workout level and time.
The first 20 minute aerobic section includes some strenth training (with light weights) which I like.  I don't like doing Push-ups in the middle of aerobics.  I think lowering to the ground while your heart rate is up, is detrimental.  This is easily fixed, but just doing the other moves while the TV group is on the ground.
The second and third sections are higher impact and intensity 10 minute sessions.  Again you can do these once, twice, or three times if you want.

It's not your ""typical Cardio"" workout. I love the fact it has increased levels for your progress, and level one isn't easy. I am in pretty good shape but I want to tone and maintain my weight. What's also great is that you can tweak the workout easily to your own level  with weights or no weights etc. It was definatley worth the purchase.

For someone who hasn't worked out regularly for the last year, the Cardio Max DVD has been one tough workout! I have a deeper respect for the contestants who can do workouts like this all day long for three to four months.

Level 1 with Bob has been difficult enough to make me doubt whether or not I could advance to Level 2 after the first two weeks -- and this is coming from someone who likes to be challenged. I did move on to Level 2 with Jillian, and can now tell a big difference in overall strength, muscle tone, and energy. The trainers really keep your heartrate up with the use of weights and by moving quickly from one thing to the next. You don't have time to notice how hard you're breathing, but you do notice how badly your muscles burn, especially during all those lunges!",1199491200,2,903,4.311764705882353

I also love the fact that you can cater pretty much any of the moves to what you can handle. You can make it super easy or super hard, depending on how you feel. And Bob the trainer is great. I've never watched the show (Biggest Loser) but he really makes you feel comfortable and motivated regardless of your level of fitness. I haven't done the female trainers parts yet (levels 2 and 3), but just based on Bob's warmup, 20 minute level 1 cardio and yoga-stretch cool down, I give it 5 stars.",1199491200,6,606,4.278260869565218
3202822,4,B000WEVGHA,"All of the workout sections of this video are great... quick, effective, and  will always provide a challenge regardless of your fitness level.  The only negative I would add, is that the ""cool-down"" section is not much of a cool-down.  Instead, it is a mini yoga session that doesn't stretch many of the muscles used in the work-out, and which does NOT sufficiently bring your heart rate down.  Additionally, the workout sessions themselves don't include any sort of cool down.  It's work, work, work, boom, ""cool-down"" (mini-yoga) session.  I have to pause the DVD, bring my heart rate down on my own, complete the yoga cool-down, and THEN do my own cool-down/stretching.  If you are new to working out, this may be a problem if you don't know how to manage your own heart-rate, etc.

I own the first Biggest Loser workout and noticed that in this one, they make no effort to keep the participants in the background synchronized.  I'm just anal enough about a musical beat that this bugs me a bit, but fortunately, the music is non-descript enough that it doesn't really matter.  The non-descript music does allow you to fairly easily set your own pace if needed.

Last, but not least, for the ladies...  Bob's a babe, and you get to see plenty of his smiling face. :)",1199318400,11,1270,4.671171171171171

3202824,4,B000WEVGHA,"Let me preface this by saying I have lost and maintained a nearly 40lb weight loss through eating and working out.  I've completed a half marathon, run 20 miles weekly and have done numerous workout DVD's...including the original Biggest Loser DVD and even Jillian's separate workout DVD's.  I don't say this to toot my own horn, but to give you a gauge as to how someone who's in good shape views this DVD.

At least I thought I was in good shape until I popped this DVD in.  This is a crazy hard workout that will workout every fiber in your body.

Bob starts with Level 1 and gives you 20 minutes of heart pounding, lunge screaming and weight lifting cardio...at Level 1??

Jillian is next and she doesn't fail at delivering a 10 minute, high intensity level 2 cardio workout.  Like I stated earlier, I've got her whole collection of workout DVD's and this 10 minutes with her, is just as bad (good) as a few of the 20 minute DVD's I've got with her.

Bringing up the rear is Kim...and this one is a let down.  For a level 3 cardio workout, she barely breaks even with Bob's Level 1.  Now, if you do all 3 in a row like I do, then it does get a little tiring at the end with her, but if you just pop in her section for 10 minutes, I don't think you'd be pushing yourself very hard.  In my own opinion, the workout difficulty would have gone Kim, Jillian and then Bob...do those jumping lunges and tell me that's not Level 3 cardio!

All in all, this is a great workout DVD to add to your collection.  The ability to customize your workouts is great and the some of the moves are new and I've never done them before.

Start 2008 off right and lay down the cash for this.  You won't be disappointed in the workout it gives you.",1199059200,433,1728,4.2097264437689965

I love feeling like the Biggest Loser trainers are right in my own home. It's also very motivating to see the Biggest Loser contestants from this season and season's past. The trainers allow for variations in the exercises for easier to hard. Another thing I loved about it was that there were real people doing the exercises, even they screwed up once in awhile which made me feel more comfortable when I was off beat or didn't move along when everyone else did. Make sure you keep your eyes on the trainers as real people also don't always have the correct form, so you don't want to get injured. It was just nice to see the different stages different people were in also, in case there was an exercise I didn't feel comfortable with. Another plus to the DVD is that you have the option to either listen to the trainer talk through the DVD (which I listened to the first time) or you have the option to just listen to music (which I did the second time). The music was pretty motivating :) Can't wait to do this again and I'm going to get the Powersculpt DVD today to mix it up a little!
