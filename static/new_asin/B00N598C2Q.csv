The spiritual message is always timely. I would definitely recommend to friends and family. We enjoyed watching Toxic People.. looking forward to the next production!!!

8676340,5,B00N598C2Q,I must say that nothing happens by chance when it comes to how GOD works. I was thoroughly pleased with the story and cast from start to finish. I was totally invested in each character and the authentic they brought to each moment. This film made me think twice on who I should allow in my personal space and how discernment is what spirit we should operate in daily. Minister Forte took a vision and brought it to life and I promise you that you will be glued to your seat watching this one. SCANDALOUS IS ALL I CAN SAY! LOL LOVE IS GOD! P.S James Da Clay Owens and Cheniel Danqua were my all time favs :),1410825600,,607,4.1525423728813555
