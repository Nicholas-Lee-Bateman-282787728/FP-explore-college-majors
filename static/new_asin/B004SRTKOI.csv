8440198,5,B004SRTKOI,"After hearing Boulez conducting the first movement of the Mahler Tenth as beautifully at is done here, we can cry out ""why cant we get a  vision by Boulez as he would see this unfinished work"". Surely with his scholarship and intellect we could get a new study of Mahler's music.  The Knaben songs are well done by all involved.  (food for thought).",1427328000,2,349,4.507936507936508
8440199,5,B004SRTKOI,"To my regret, Pierre Boulez eschews any of the various ""performing versions"" of Mahler's Tenth. I am sure he, like other conductors, has his good reasons. Still, and especially after hearing what he does to the first movement with the superb Clevelanders, I feel quite deprived of the symphony's rest. As my friend Clive points out, this is the most breath-taking reading of the Adagio one could imagine: searing, utterly moving, multi-layered in the different string sections, heart-rending in the quiet moments and other-worldly at the end. Enough said: you must hear it in order to believe it! In comparison, the early songs from Des Knaben Wunderhorn (after a collection of romantic folk poems by Achim von Arnim and Clemens Brentano) are entertaining, light fare, a testament to Mahler's youthful infatuation with German Romanticism. They are brought off with great gusto by the fine soloists and the brilliant Clevelanders with minimal directions from Boulez. Sound and video are perfect. An impressive interview with Pierre Boulez is included. This disk is a treasure, not only for Mahlerians.",1308009600,13,1100,5.255681818181818
8440200,5,B004SRTKOI,"Hot on the heels of the complete Mahler 10 by Lan Shui/Singapore Symphony comes this Adagio only from Boulez. As much as I admire the Lan Shui disc, this Boulez is in a different class altogether. The Cleveland Orchestra is a much better orchestra, the string choirs providing string sonorities I'm not sure I've ever heard before. Boulez, in the included interview, notes that Mahler left no tempo markings other than Andante - Adagio, so most conductors play it straight. Boulez has elected to use a lot of rubato, and to great effect! It's pure magic, as is his use of portamento (string slides).

Boulez' Mahler has developed a lot over the years, proving that at 85, you're not too old to change. I always liked his interpretations, but they were a bit clinical, allowing every strand to be heard clearly. Lately, his Mahler is warmer, and more emotional, without losing the clarity.

If you are not moved by this performance, there's no hope for you! The huge outburst towards the end of the piece is devastating in its impact - truly scary music. But it's the quiet moments that will leave you stunned - this is a very moving work, written by a dying man in the throes of emotional agony.

The other work, the Wunderhorn songs, were picked as an early juxtaposition to Mahler's last work. They are very well done, the two singers acting out the parts in each song, not just standing there. Kozena was used in Abbado's Mahler 4, and Gerhaher was excellent in Rattle's Carmina Burana.

Video is very well done, although I could have done without the cutaways to the interior of Severance Hall, pretty as it is. Boulez' conducting style is very economical, but he obviously gets what he wants, and then some.

Apparently, Abbado is due to put out a Mahler 10 Adagio with Das Lied von de Erde, with the Berlin Phil., not the Lucerne Festival Orchestra - a bit surprising, since all his latest efforts with Mahler have been with Lucerne. I can't imagine Abbado topping Boulez in this Adagio, as good as he is.

All in all, a must have.",1307577600,12,2037,4.613259668508287
