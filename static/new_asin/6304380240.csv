877446,5,6304380240,"Kids for Character is one of the best kids videos we've ever bought.  Six leading children teach us that ""There are six simple words that you can use, to be a better person, if you choose.""  Those words are the  pillars of character:  trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness,  caring, and citizenship.  Six different kids shows do a short segment on  each of the six pillars, which is a good introduction to a particular TV  show if you've never seen it.  If your child already likes a certain TV  show, the familiarity is there, and if the show annoys another family  member, the segment doesn't last very long anyway.  Noteworthy is the  terrific ""fairness"" segment presented by Shari Lewis and Friends.  The segment on ""responsibility"" presented by The Magic Schoolbus  seems to stray from the point, but the other segments are great.  Quick  clips of comments from real kids keep the pace up, too.  Sponsoring  organizations include teaching groups, sports groups and public service  organizations, rather than a specific religious organization with a  religious message, which is why I can recommend this video to any  household.",913593600,8,1145,5.108695652173913

7871311,5,6304380240,"I had this VHS video 15 years ago when it first came out...All the kids loved it.. I loaned it to someone who never returned it  (sad). I am sooo happy that I was able to find another, in great shape,for my granddaughter to enjoy, along with young neice's and nephew's.  This is the greatest show any child could ever watch...They love it!!!!
Thanks!!!!!
PS  Wondering if it could be put onto a CD at some point, so MORE people with kids could watch it.  Kids learn from this....Just wonderful!!!!!!!!",1291075200,,501,4.533333333333333
7871312,5,6304380240,"I purchased this video for my 3yr old granddaughter because she had seen the previews on on older Barney video.  She absolutely loves it and will sit and watch it repeatedly.  She refers to the personality characteristics being taught and proclaims herself as a Kid for Character.  Although it was in a used VHS format, it was in excellent shape and will receive good use.  I highly recommend it for young children.",1242518400,,415,4.722222222222222
7871313,5,6304380240,This is a great video to go along with your Kids for Charachter curriculum at the preschool/kindergarten age level.  I don't think it is age appropriate for children over the age of six.  Charachters that preschoolers and kinderfarten children know and love help to introduce the six pillars that make up good charachter in terms they can understand.  As a preschool teacher I highly recommend this video.,1187136000,,405,5.014925373134329
