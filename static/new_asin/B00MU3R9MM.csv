6601889,4,B00MU3R9MM,GOOD MOVIE. LOTS OF ACTION. ONE OF THOSE MOVIES YOU NEVER SEE ON T.V.,1433894400,,69,4.0
6601890,5,B00MU3R9MM,"A classic Sarafian film from the early 70s with a stellar cast--Rod Steiger and Robert Ryan as family patriarchs, Jeff Bridges and Randy Quaid in what must be close to their first onscreen appearances, Joan Goodfellow playing a memorable ""Sister E.,"" and Season Hubley, dewy as a Tennessee knoll on a humid summer morning, playing Roonie Gill, mistaken as Lolly Madonna.  Many of us saw this film on UHF channels starting at midnight on Saturday through the 1970s, never available to my knowledge on VHS or DVD until now.  Some dated screenplay language and flat acting at times, but overall, what a gift to have this on a DVD!",1433289600,,627,4.743119266055046
6601891,4,B00MU3R9MM,"Overlooked, offbeat rural drama echoes Hatfields and McCoys, boasts fine performances. Maybe too grim for some, but well-worth a look.",1433030400,,134,5.75
6601892,4,B00MU3R9MM,"I'd never seen this movie until I purchased it here. It's a little dark and moves back & forth a bit too quickly, but other wise it is entertaining. Character development could have used a bit more development but overall, for an older piece it is fine,",1432598400,,253,4.404255319148936
6601893,5,B00MU3R9MM,"Set in Tennessee circa 1972 the film concerns the feud between two rural clans, the Feathers and the Gutshalls, over a piece of desirable land.  The patriarchs of the respective clans, Laban Feather (Rod Steiger) and Pap Gutshall (Robert Ryan), exploit their offspring in continuing the squabble starting with petty vandalism which then escalates to rape and murder.  This is a smoking powder keg on the verge of exploding and there's no apparent civil law to impede it.  The theme of blood wars on display here has its American precedent in the famed Hatfield and McCoy feud.  The patriarchs instigate the war illustrated in the film using their offspring as cannon fodder and the inevitable  outcome is there are no winners leaving the respective parties to oversee the body count.  This is a gut wrenching film almost Shakespearean in its level of tragedy that also uses the then ongoing Vietnamese conflict as a parallel. It is also a good showcase for then fledgling talent that includes Jeff Bridges, Gary Busey, Randy Quaid, and Season Hubley.  ""Lolly-Madonna XXX"" is another unsung gem from the Seventies when American filmmakers took chances and challenged their audience.",1430611200,9,1181,5.0880829015544045
6601894,5,B00MU3R9MM,"This movie was just as good today as I remember it.  I saw it years ago and loved it.  Also, it contained a great surprise, Scott Wilson is in it and I watch ""The Walking Dead"" and realized he was in the movie. If anyone likes great actors and would love to see Scott Wilson when he was younger. get this movie!",1428278400,,311,4.0
6601895,5,B00MU3R9MM,"interesting old film, very good quality DVD.",1428278400,,44,5.428571428571429
6601896,5,B00MU3R9MM,"Saw this TV movie in the early 70s and loved it. Tried to find a VHS copy, but failed, then was able to tape it off television a few years later. Finally, it is in DVD form for everyone to enjoy. Hatfield and McCoy themed, the story pits two hillbilly families against each other over piddly quabbles and eventually ends in a hail of bullets and tragedy. The actors and settings are superb and the storyline keeps one screwed to their seat in anticipation. Only wish there could have been a sequel or sorts. All in all, I'm giving this movie five stars, simply because of the realism and the fact the characters are flawed yet lovable.",1423353600,5,635,4.435897435897436
6601897,5,B00MU3R9MM,"I couldn't believe it when I saw that this movie was out on DVD.  I have been waiting for it to be on VHS or DVD for 30 years.  I own a bootleg copy that is barely worth watching, the quality is so bad.  The dvd is very good quality and I am so happy Warner Brothers finally decided to release it.  Many fans who have been waiting for the dvd release will be happy.
This movie hauntingly takes you back to 1974.  The music, the references to the war in Viet Nam, the actors' youth, all take you back to that time.",1420156800,10,513,3.941747572815534
6601898,5,B00MU3R9MM,"I was pleasantly surprised at how good this movie is. There are several well known actors in the film including Rod Steiger, Jeff Bridges, Gary Busey and an impressive premiere by Season Hubley as a young woman caught up in a feud between two neighboring families. While waiting for a transfer bus she is mistaken for the fiance of a member of one of the feuding families. This misconception was aided by a fictitious post card ""accidentally"" found by a member of the other family who decides to kidnap the girl who signed the postcard as Lolly Madonna. From this one event the fighting escalates to destruction of property, rape and murder.",1413244800,4,641,4.732142857142857
8674610,1,B00MU3R9MM,No it did not it ended up being a trailer only. I felt like I got ripped off. I bought it for my father-in-law and made me look bad.,1520553600,,132,3.586206896551724
8674611,5,B00MU3R9MM,Another Great DVD,1508371200,,17,5.0
8674612,5,B00MU3R9MM,"a wild ride from the 70's with a very young (& so sexy) Jeff Bridges/ interesting tale of a family who kidnaps a girl from a bus stop, due to a feud with another family, and the deadly aftermath",1479600000,,194,4.0
8674613,5,B00MU3R9MM,"An excellent saga about two feuding hillbilly families and the resulting tragedies.  Early roles for Jeff Bridges, Gary Busey and a few others. Can't believe this hasn't been played more on TCM or other classic movie channels.
Loved it. Recommend if you enjoy obscure, underrated 70's movies!",1474070400,,292,5.212765957446808
8674614,5,B00MU3R9MM,"""also a must see""",1472256000,,17,3.5
8674615,4,B00MU3R9MM,"The film benefits from a very authentic setting. With the story one most question if the violent feud between neighbors is somewhat outdated, even by the films real time early 70s setting. The conclusion leaves the viewer wondering what happens to the surviving characters and what the disposition was. The vintage film making technique is greatly appreciated showing a real world view of the setting without modern gloss or glamorization or the gritty enhancement that makes it reality less real.",1464652800,,497,5.225
8674616,5,B00MU3R9MM,"My husband loved the movie, it was for him.",1464480000,,43,3.888888888888889
8674617,5,B00MU3R9MM,Saw this on the 1970s and have been looking for it for years. Finally!! I just ordered it. Thank you Amazon and those who decided to make it into a DVD.,1463702400,,152,3.935483870967742
8674618,5,B00MU3R9MM,"I wish they would stop linking this movie with porno just because it has XXX after the title, which actually means love, hugs and kisses. This movie is not X rated. I thought it was an excellent story with great actors.",1451520000,2,219,4.365853658536586
8674619,5,B00MU3R9MM,"I was in the Navy, and stationed in Long Beach California, and downtown Long Beach had in those days (1970's) about 8 movie theaters within a 6 block radius.  This is where I first saw this movie, and thinking how different and raw this movie was. The story line somewhat intriguing, the acting top notch and music...oh that music, haunting.  Only really familiar with Robert Ryan and Rod Stieger actor star power, man little did I know the actors that were on the horizon soon to become house hold names, Jeff Bridges, Scott Wilson, Gary Busey, Randy Quaid, to name a few. It would be another 40 years, and countless hours of trying to find this movie like so many other's (Murder He Say's The Court Jester) that for some reason never was released to DVD. This is one of those movies that I can introduce to my friends at a social gathering, and get at the end of the movie, where did you get this movie, how long ago was it done, where can I get a copy?  And with hearing that as far as its star rating....nuff said.",1439683200,3,1018,4.347368421052631
