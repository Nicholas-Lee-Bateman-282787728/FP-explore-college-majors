8235445,3,B000ZHDBCC,"This is good video to show the extent to which Cheney wanted to expand the power of the presidency throughout his political career. I used it in my senior government class after a chapter on the executive branch to reiterate terms like executive privilege.  However, my students enjoyed the PBS Frontline video ""Bush's War"" much more and it covered much of the same material anyway.",1297123200,6,382,4.876923076923077
8235446,5,B000ZHDBCC,"This video is outstanding, if you have just a little bit of understanding of the government and how it function, not according to the news media.
I show's that our government do not run by public opinion, but with in the confines of the constitution. When it comes to protecting our country the president and the vice president have a obligation to uphold and defend
the constitution according to article 2 of the constitution of the U.S.
Vice pres cheney took and active role in fighting the war on terror, instead of sitting on his rear end. the legislature was beefed and they also funded the war and approved every thing the bush admin did and then come in front of the media and lie in front of the american people. this
video upset people that are clueless about the government and how decisions are made, and the checks and balances. People think the president is a dictator. Cheney law points out that the office of legal counsel proved legal opinion that is based presidential constitutional powers, the legislature can challenge the president in court if the disagree. The video show'd that they took every effort to protect to protect our country and fulfill his oath, it showed that it is not always pretty but needed to be done, Justice sara o'conner stated if people in this country learn more about civics instead of having useless knowledge
like who are the judges on american idol. But president john f kennedy
stated; Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill. that we
shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and success of liberty;. this video lives up to these words, country first, without it we have no liberty.",1242086400,,1732,4.6819672131147545

8235448,4,B000ZHDBCC,A truly exasperating tale of political greed and corruption. It is a shame that Cheney has not been impeached for all of his unconstitutional shennaningans. This would be a perfect documentary if only there were more interviews with higher level insiders. It is a great story none-the-less.,1213056000,5,290,5.191489361702128
