Adapted from the Zane Grey novel and directed by Charles Barton (he later worked extensively with Abbott & Costello), THE FIGHTING WESTERNER (aka ""Rocky Mountain Mystery"") is a low-budget PARAMOUNT programmer that effectively combines the western and who-dun-it genres and offers a few casting surprises, namely Ann Sheriden and Randolph Scott at the beginning of their careers. Also appearing is 19th Century stage actress Mrs. Leslie Carter as the family matriarch.

THE STORY--
A mining engineer (Scott) investigating the mysterious disappearance of his brother-in-law joins forces with a crusty deputy sheriff (Sale) who is himself looking into the murder of a mine owner. When two more people die, all the suspects have alibis.

The story begins with a rider who visits a house. Two ham steaks are on the grill in this empty house. Larry Sutton meets an old man, the Deputy Sheriff Tex Murdock. Larry has a letter of introduction (to replace Parsons). Mr. Borg is dead, a mining ""accident"". Parsons was accused of murder, but he disappeared. ""What noise?"" Larry wants to learn more about this crime, and visits the Ballard's house. Two huge dogs guard the house. Relatives talk about their presumed inheritance. Larry knows about radium mining, for medical use. One gram of radium sold for $37,000! Mr. Ballard is incapacitated, confined to bed. Larry meets Rita Ballard. How valuable is the mine? Who wrote that warning note? The stamping mill makes a noise; Fritz was murdered! Ballard tells about his will; if an inheritor dies his share will not be divided among the others. We learn about the people there.

Rita dreams of moving to Hawaii to raise cattle. Who shot at John Borg? Who stole Borg's body? Larry advises building a new factory; Ballard disagrees. Will the Black Rider strike again? Is a girl in danger? Will a search of Mrs. Ballard's rooms reveal anything? Is a hoofprint as individual as fingerprints? Was that Jack Parson's horse? What happened to Rita? The former Mrs. Ballard arrives, she wants to see Mr. Ballard. ""He's not my husband!"" The masquerade is over. A murder for inheritance? Larry figured it all out. Borg makes a deal with Larry - can he be trusted? Larry tries to rescue Rita from Borg. Justice triumphs. Rita and Larry will be sitting on top of the world.

This story was adapted from a Zane Grey novel ""Golden Dreams"". It is basically a murder mystery set in a mansion, where heirs to a fortune are eliminated so someone will inherit a fortune. Other stories used a similar plot. It could just as well take place in a mining town like Scranton, Penna. Near the end I had a hunch: it reminded me of Dashiell Hammett's earlier short story ""Night Shots"". ""Eyewitness evidence is most credible when it is supported by circumstantial evidence."" [This was also titled ""Rocky Mountain Mystery"".] Note how the valuable mineral was changed to radium.",1345507200,,2187,4.78042328042328

8132614,1,B000GI3KCG,"Imagine my disappointment when ""Fighting Westerner"" (my hero Randolph Scott) arrived, dubbed by Front Row Entertainment Video of New Jersey who should be ashamed of the product they produced. I would keep away from anything this company does. My video was incredibly scratched and grainy and impossible to adjust let alone watch! This is the second time I have been caught out by this company. Wouldn't it be nice if Amazon Com could print the name of the company on the films web page so that the buyer has all the information! If I could have rated this product by Front Row Entertainment I would have given its true value at minus 5000! Perhaps Amazon Com should develop a blacklist of poor video/DVD suppliers.",1069372800,,714,4.766129032258065
