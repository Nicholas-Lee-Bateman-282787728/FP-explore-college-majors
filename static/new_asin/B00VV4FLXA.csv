Try to listen to two person speaking at the same time and with the same sound volume, one speaks her/his own language while the traductor in French speak at the same time, very chaotic. Also at times the music level takes over the commentary? Can't hear the comments clearly? Really dissapointed especially for the price paid.",1477612800,,420,4.929577464788732
