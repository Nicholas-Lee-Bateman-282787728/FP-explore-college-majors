5740290,4,B00CTWBPQ0,"Bergdorf Goodman is the ULTIMATE place to shop in the US!
great to see the history of BG as well as the people who contribute to the fantastic shopping experience there!",1377820800,,169,4.483870967741935
5740291,4,B00CTWBPQ0,"The world we see in ""Scatter My Ashes..."" is one that I grew up in, so I was very interested to view the movie.  But after watching an hour and a half of such intense, silly, self-centered, deliberately self-insulating and alienating behavior, I was (sorry, our side)kind of sick.  One speaker in particular summed up the callousness that is required to live that way...you'll catch it if you watch the film...but many, many voice ""the concupiscence of the oppressor.""
Certainly, you can see it, and be amused. It has lots of ""pretty.""  The music is often, but not always, good.  Thematically, however,it is not strong or very cogent.  For example, the periodic return to the process of windows being created for one year's Christmastime display was, overall, not enough to hold repeated interest.  But  - rent it. You meet many  personalities already known to you by name; and as a saving grace for BG, you can get a sense of Linda Fargo's pure heart; she really just loves beautiful things.",1377388800,3,992,4.794117647058823
5740292,4,B00CTWBPQ0,"This was an entertaining documentry.  I would have liked it to explore more of the hitorical orgins/aspects of Bergdorf Goodman, though.  I really appreciated the ""Barbra"" ending.",1376784000,,179,5.592592592592593

5740294,5,B00CTWBPQ0,"Wow!!!  I have been waiting for this film since I heard about the book.  This is for every fashionista out there.

It is stellar as a production and the behind the scenes look at this emporium of luxury and glamour is so exciting.

I have shopped here years ago without ever knowing how much of a unique experience being there really was; I was not
overwhelmed but rather rejoiced in all the beauty surrounding me there.

This film is gorgeous!!!!  BG is gorgeous as a store!  And as they say in the film, you need not be rich to shop there.

Funny thing, the window displays were heavily emphasized in this film and like the famous personal shopper, Betty, I as
a patron never looked at them, just opened a door and entered a world filled with luxury that made me joyous.

Bravo to all who took part in this film.  Can't wait to own it as a DVD.  It is a very delightful experience.",1376006400,4,883,4.290909090909091

5740310,2,B00CTWBPQ0,"This was yet another boring documentary. I'm not sure why I gave it 2 stars rather than 1. I guess it's because I simply felt generous or maybe I hit the wrong star.

We might as well have been in Sears for all the clothing, shoes, jewelry, and hats that we were able to see. Had I been the film's director, I would have gone to salesperson after salesperson and had them show the camera the most beautiful thing in his or her department. Instead, we got treated to a dull lovefest with designer after designer kissing the bottom of the store. I can understand this. After all, each one of them wants to keep their line in BG. It's a cutthroat business.

PS  Those $6000.00 shoes looked tacky and unwearable and the store windows looked like a bunch of dizzying junk thrown together. Marshall Field's windows were much more beautiful. There. The emperor has no clothes.",1453766400,,869,4.522292993630574

And how they create the Christmas windows is worth the ticket price - a sneak peek into the chic and fabulous world of Bergdorf's.",1450656000,,372,4.920634920634921
5740313,2,B00CTWBPQ0,"i was so disappointed in this.  I read the book first and I also read Betty Halbrecht's memoir and was anxious to get a virtual tour of the store.  The most they showed of the actual store was the window display process, which I did love.  But most of this was about the designers.  (I realize clothing designers provide the clothing that the store sells.) But I just wanted to see the store.  it's enormous, I'm sure it would have made for ample footage.  Show me the fancy restaurant!  Show me more of the architecture.  etc.  Did not feel like I'd ""been to"" Bergdorf's after watching",1447632000,4,586,4.452830188679245
5740314,4,B00CTWBPQ0,"Here we get an insight into the incredible history and workings of the prestigious landmark store Bergdorf Goodmans in New York. There are interviews with Directors and store staff along with A list international celebrities, super star fashion designers and the fashion cognoscenti.

Of particular note are the efforts the store takes to be exclusive and offer customer a sublime experience. We see top designers talking about their initial struggles to have their collections accepted and other designers who are hoping to get their collections accepted. You get a slight glimpse of the designer clothing on offer in the store, but I would have liked to have seen much more.

Of particular interest were interviews with the personal shoppers one of them being the famous Betty Halbreich, and also the window display team who are amazing creating incredibly enchanting displays.  You also get to see the vast props department they have for use with the window and in-store displays. It is like a magical emporium and must itself be worth a fortune.

My final thought was to get the most out of your experience at Bergdorf Goodmans you would most certainly need a very big bank balance, because this kind of luxury does not come cheap.",1445558400,,1235,4.980582524271845

5740335,5,B00CTWBPQ0,"Black leather gloves - my Bergdorf's memento.  Decades old, but that's not the point.  Elegance never grows old & out-of-date.  New Your - what a city.  (from CA & San Francisco will never match up).

""Sex & The City"" was mentioned.  I learned about ""Manolo Blainik"" (spel?) shoes from Carrie.  Expensive (""expensive"" isn't an adequate description).  I've always been enthralled w/shoes...be they from Goodwill or Bloomingdale's.

Stanford CA - Macy's is the Woolworths.  Tucson AZ - it's high-end.  No more Macys for me after hearing they wanted to appeal to the masses.  Isn't that what Wal-Mart's for?

p.s.  is that snotty enough?  BTW you can shop online at Bergdorf's

Just enjoyed the h--l out of this film.  Nothing at Bergdorf's I could afford to look at - let alone buy.  Who knows what leather gloves are now?

5740350,4,B00CTWBPQ0,"SCATTER MY ASHES AT BERGDORF'S looks at the interior workings of Manhattan's famous store, interviews some of their most celebrated employees and talks to a series of fashion designers and customers who have enjoyed an association with the store over the years.  Divided into a series of sections - for example, looking at how designers get accepted, the business of selling, or the planning that goes into the Christmas window-dressing campaign - the documentary shows how the store maintains its aura of exclusivity, not just because of the outrageous prices it charges, but because of the way it treats its customers.  Star salesperson Betty Halbreich tells her clients the truth about themselves, while persuading them to spend fantastic sums on clothing.  In the shoe salon, staff take a conscious pride in selling what they perceive as top-of-the-range models.  Running throughout the film is a narrative concentrating on Bergdorf's iconic window-displays for 2012 - entitled ""The Carnival of the Animals,"" they are quite simply mind-boggling in their detail and richness, creating a never-never land of their own that draws customers as well as tourists and window-shoppers.  The interviews with the fashion designers are perhaps the film's least interesting aspect; it is much more instructive to look at the way in which hard-edged buyer Linda Fargo both nurtures and directs potential designers; she knows what she wants, and is prepared to get it at any cost.  While Miele's film celebrates the store's durability - it even managed to weather the 2008 economic crisis - it perhaps lacks a sense of historical background: we could have found out more about how and why it attained its prestige in the first place.  It remains highly entertaining nonetheless.",1397865600,,1768,5.226148409893993

I'm from Sydney, Australia, have never been to New York and have never heard of this store, it just seemed like one big advertisement for this store when I am really interested in the thinking of stylists and their artistic flair. From this angle it was a miserable 93 minutes of viewing.",1392336000,2,422,4.552631578947368
5740361,3,B00CTWBPQ0,"This was a great documentary at first - very informative, but a little long-winded.  Very excited at first and takes off w/ a bang - then peeters out.  I'd say the last 30 mins were boring and unnecessary.  They lost me at that point, and I lost interest.  Had to rewind the next day and finish.

Lots of interesting facts about how some of the major designers were discovered though.",1391385600,,384,4.428571428571429
5740362,2,B00CTWBPQ0,"The most impressive part of the documentary Scatter My Ashes at Bergdorf's is the names of people who agreed to be interviewed. The list is quite long, including fashion designers like Marc Jacobs, Karl Lagerfeld, Isaac Mizrahi and Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, and actresses like Joan Rivers, and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. Unfortunately, what they have to say before the camera is mostly not very interesting, except for a few amusing episodes.

The film consists of a series of loosely thematically connected segments, each of which deals with several aspects of the Manhattan department store, such as aspiring designers trying to get in or the backstage of window display design. The film has lots of visuals and some interesting people like delightfully sharp-tongued personal shopper Betty Halbreich.

But to me, the film does not seem to know what it really wants to say about the potentially intriguing subject matter. What is worse, each segment of the episodic film is not really revealing.

So, what do we learn about Bergdorf Goodman after watching the film? Sorry, but we learn not much. Scatter My Ashes at Bergdorf's tells us a bit about its history (not enough), a bit about celebrity customers (interesting but not enough again) and how business is done (not enough). The film shows a lot about the New York high-end department store, but not much about what makes it a special place.",1390435200,3,1409,5.012820512820513

5740364,3,B00CTWBPQ0,"This movie was okay.  If I were a true Bergdorfs fan I probably would have rated it closer to 5 stars.  It had interesting material in it.  But, it also got a bit tedious.  After seeing several prop rooms for windows, I didn't need to see even more.  Also, when one realizes what they spend on windows (granted they are exceptional) you realize how much less they could charge for their merchandise.
If you are a shopper, and love Bergdorfs, then  by all means see it.  If not, there's better films out there.",1389657600,,509,4.408602150537634
5740365,4,B00CTWBPQ0,"This was a tres fun documentary about NYC stalwart Bergdorf's. How I enjoyed it! How I wanted to book a flight from the hideous redneck hellhole I'm currently stuck in, order a glass of champagne on the flight, all the while cooing into my cellphone ""Make me an appointment with your best personal shopper, STAT!"" Then put on my dark sunglasses and flee undercover of night, my two kitty carriers my only betrayal as to identity as I board my private jet to my new life of glamour and rich lover(s).

Anyhoo, if you enjoy following high fashion as I do, this is the documentary for you. Isaac Mizrahi is particularly bitchy, and it's really funny. I enjoyed the whole darn thing, and it was hilarious, as are the incredibly stupid reactions some people have had to it in the comments. Ahhhh, Bergdorf's.

5740371,5,B00CTWBPQ0,"As someone who appreciates fashion as art and who has worked in the retail world, for now, 28 years, this is a documentary that captures what true fashionistas find passionate in the stratosphoric levels of fashion.  For those who don't get it, this is a perfect vehicle that explains it.",1387324800,,288,4.76
5740372,2,B00CTWBPQ0,"I found this to be a very slow, fairly dull documentary.  The store looks beautiful and you do learn some interesting things about high-end retail and the people who work there but that's about it.  You don't really learn why Bergdorf's is more special than other high-end retailers.

The film was separated into different themes (each with it's own title) but this meant a scene didn't always logically flow into the next.  The camera work seemed a little off-kilter.  Most noticeable, everyone on screen seemed to lack energy, even some of the celebrities who were interviewed.",1386547200,,579,4.989583333333333

5740375,2,B00CTWBPQ0,"The movie should have been a 10 minute short and not a 2 hour full length feature.  While parts of it were interesting, especially some of the sound bites from famous designers, it was a big fat bore.  There is not much fashion in the movie - it is more about designers talking about how fabulous it is to get into Bergdorfs and how that changed their careers.  And, of course, since everyone here is extremely aware of the fact that whatever they say may be used against them, nothing but the most glowing things are said.
Save your money.  There are a lot better fashion films out there.",1384473600,5,589,4.376146788990826

5740378,5,B00CTWBPQ0,"This is a great documentary full of the inside scoop! The focus is on a behind the scenes look at what goes into creating Bergdorf's famously magical windows. I watched this two days before traveling to NYC, I couldn't wait to get to Bergdorf's and see it through different eyes now that I know so much more about the history. Great peek inside old New York society as well.",1383091200,,374,4.434782608695652
5740379,4,B00CTWBPQ0,"We learned a lot about the store.  Have lived and been to NYC many times and somehow missed this store - probably because it is way out of my price range!  Great information, great interviews, and fun insight to this store and vendors.",1382832000,,235,4.441860465116279

5740385,3,B00CTWBPQ0,"Although the documentary had some interesting tidbits, I don't think that Bergdorfs was worthy of a documentary. No question it is a great store, with a long history, but there just wasn't enough to say about it.",1380499200,,212,4.756756756756757
5740386,5,B00CTWBPQ0,"The fabled Department Store Bergdorf Goodman is profiled here, and this is a behind the scenes look at it, and it is fascinating. If you love fashion, as I do, and labels, as I do, you will LOVE this video. I've shopped there before, and had personal shoppers before, but had NO IDEA the amount of money they make, nor the amount of money these big moneyed customers drop at a single shopping trip (amazing!).

Even though I could never afford to buy anything in Bergdorfs it is still a fascinating place to visit and see how the other half lives.

The people in this documentary were fascinating and the film does a good job moving from subject to subject in a quick pace.  I thought this film would bore me, but it was quite the opposite due to the skill of the filmakers.  Great documentary for anyone who is into fashion or people who love New York history.",1378512000,14,604,4.3097345132743365
5740390,4,B00CTWBPQ0,"For the fashion lover, this is a treat as it delves into:

a few fun historical facts
a quick ""who's who"" on the fashion side of the business
a behind the scenes look at their holiday window set up

sprinkled with designer and customer service anecdotes

A very well made and entertaining Bergdorf Goodman Orientation Video.

As a documentary, ""Scatter My Ashes at Bergdorfs"" is a mixed bag.
For better or worse, there is no narration. While there is visual segmentation of each ""chapter"" of the documentary, the documentary jumps around quite a bit and thus falls short on making any cohesive point(s).....other than that ""Bergdorf is amazing"".

What I did enjoy was the authenticity in Linda Ford's assessment of aspiring designers wanting to sell at Bergdorfs. It is certainly edited but is authentic in conveying that not every promising designer gets their foot in the door at Bergdorf's. (However it conveniently conveys how exclusive and awe inspiring Bergdorf's is).",1378425600,,974,5.0625
5740391,5,B00CTWBPQ0,"This was a great documentary about a part of New York City history and fashion. My only critic is that the store's history was glossed over too fast.
