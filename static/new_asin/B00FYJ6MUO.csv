8619472,5,B00FYJ6MUO,"This combo pack for these two hillarous movies would make a great holidays gift. The Watch and Dodgeball are movies that you should definitely own yourself or give to people you care about for a fun holiday gift. The Watch was a sneaky funny movie that I think you will enjoy from this past year, while Dodgeball was a hit from 2004, that grossed over $100 million dollars.

The Watch features Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill and Richard Ayoade.  The plot centers four guys who form a neighborhood watch group as a way to get out of their day-to-day family routines find themselves defending the Earth from an alien invasion.  I found this movie to be very funny and actually the special effects were very good in the film.  I think you will enjoy this film and the plot makes some fun twists and turns.

The second movie from this combo pack is Dogeball. This movie features Vince Vaughn, Christine Taylor (wife of Ben Stiller), Ben Stiller, Justin Long, and a hilarious Rip Torn as Patches O'Houlihan. The movie is directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, who was behind the sneaky hit ""Were The Millers"".  The movie is funny and has some great scenes in it that will have you laughing even after the movie is over.

I feel this combo pack is a good deal and that it would make a great gift for yourself or a holiday gift, and I would definitely recommend it.

Thank you for reading my review.",1386115200,,1397,4.515873015873016
