2199920,2,B00074DXEY,"Wonderful idea, great team work, good intention, but not quite enough. I had hoped for a broader educational tool, something to help support the parents & families involved with these children.  The story was stilted and 'not real'. The connection of these children was glossed over. The film left me concerned about exploitation of these kids and also about unrealistic expectations. Neale's best gift is writing, not acting. It ultimately left me disappointed and angry.",1108857600,17,472,5.293333333333333
2199921,2,B00074DXEY,"I saw this movie in a local church not very long ago, and was hoping to have seen a documentary about the indigo children. What I saw was a poorly strung together and acted out drama about an indigo. Nobody attemps to explain anything about the children except that they seem to have something special happening around them. The fact that child can predict things in the future and knows things that she ""shouldn't,"" is about all that you get from this movie. I wanted information on the subject, not some soap opera story with soap opera rate actors.",1108339200,17,551,4.575757575757576

2199927,5,B00074DXEY,This movie makes you stop your busy day to sit down and pay attention to the wisdom and sage of a child. Indigo children a real life phenomena. They are wise old souls with the innocence and trust of a child. Able to see thru the veils of illusion that we have all grown blind to. They cut to the chase and know what is and is not important in life. And this movie does exactly that also.,1393804800,,388,3.9871794871794872
2199928,5,B00074DXEY,"Absolutely loved it! It so happens, that i am directly involved in everything, pertaining not only to what people call ""indigo"" children, but also much-much more in that same respect. The only thing i can say to all these, who rated this movie poorly, is that some time ago everyone on the planet believed that the Earth is flat. Do i need to say more?",1384992000,,352,4.430769230769231

2199931,4,B00074DXEY,"Persons, who are familiar with the psychic side of Man, mysticism and metaphysics will definitely find this film interesting and a confirmation of what they already know. For many,who are not given to such knowledge, they are likely to view it with trepedation. Some will classify it miraculous.

If I had not read The Indigo Children by Lee Caroll before I watched this film, I would not have enjoyed it as I did. I felt that the way the subject of Indigo was introduced in the film was a little forced. There are valuable lessons to be learnt about choice of partners, the ignorance of business owners and the need to listen more to our children. The film will assist one raise ones level of awareness and consciousness about life and living by attempting to answer questions like: Why should someone go to jail for the offence of another? How judicious is our justice and judicial system? How are marriages contracted? Are there more to relationships? What purpose(s) if any do they serve?

In sum, I would recommend this film to all. - by Ileri Thomas.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Indigo-A-Film-Of-Faith-Family-An-Extraordinary-Child/dp/B00074DXEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Indigo: A Film Of Faith, Family & An Extraordinary Child</a>",1367107200,,1280,5.459595959595959

2199935,1,B00074DXEY,"I am a fan of Neale, but this movie is completely baffling as to what they are trying to say.. it was painful to watch honestly.. I was cringing with embarrassment for NDW ..oops ! ..we (5 of us )as a group were VERY excited to drive two hours to see it being that we have done much work on the subject with Drunvalo (wonderful video) and others..but this story never got past an annoying and rude ""indigo"" brat and NDW toting a gun around with children in hand .. huh ??  these positive reviews can't have much to do with the actual movie, that's for sure !

2199936,2,B00074DXEY,"This film was a huge disappointment.  The actors that I work with in community theater are better actors than the ones in this movie.  I'm not a spiritual person, and was not at all familiar with the indigo children concept. The movie Indigo certainly made the concept  laughable.

If the intent of the film was to introduce people to the idea of Indigo children, it failed.  If the intent of the film was to entertain, it also failed.",1278288000,5,435,4.5256410256410255

2199940,5,B00074DXEY,"Now, I do not for one second believe any of the hokum surrounding ""Indigo Children"". It's a bunch of New-Age-nonsense that is probably going to cause some serious issues for the unfortunate children of True Believers. That said, this movie is one of the most hilarious I have ever seen. From the over-serious tone to the laugh out loud dialog, this movie will have you rolling with laughter! Exchanges like this: (after the Lil' Indigo touches a woman with breast cancer) Gramps: ""Are you telling me that she cured your cancer?"" Woman: ""I wouldn't be surprised."" Priceless! The honesty! The pure emotion! The insanity of the whole damn idea! Bloody brilliant!

The production quality is pretty high, the pace of the film is good, and the unique combination of melodrama, spiritual wackiness and unintentional humor will satisfy even the most critical viewer.

If you're a believer, well, then maybe you'll enjoy the film as a serious exploration of an incredible phenomenon. Good luck with that. If you're not, then you will love the laugh-out-loud earnestness of this charming bit of woo cinema. Rent it today, you'll be glad you did!",1229299200,11,1135,4.968421052631579
2199941,2,B00074DXEY,"Okay,

First off let me start by saying that I'm a HUGE fan of Neale Donald Walsch. I have pretty much every book, newsletter, audiobook, email, podcast, youtube video, etc he has anything to do with. It was with much excitement that I found a copy of this movie at my local library. Boy am I glad I didn't fork over any money on this! I won't bore the reader by re-hashing too much of what has been written here by other reviewers but I just had to weigh in about this film.

I knew this was supposed to be an independent and even a little of a ""low budget"" project but everything from the story to the production and even (especially) the music were so unflattering, calling it amaturish would be a gross understatement. Yes, all of the bad reviews are true with the final ten minutes being particularly bad.

Don't get me wrong. I really wanted to like this movie. Again, I'm a HUGE fan of NDW and I really do believe this subject has a basis in reality. However, given the talent and resources of the creative team behind this project, I feel they could've made a much better film. It would be great to see the filmakers go back and revisit this subject matter in the form of a documentary similar in style to ""What the Bleep Do We Know"" or ""The Secret"".",1228608000,2,1258,4.29957805907173
2199942,4,B00074DXEY,"Overall I liked the movie and it did contain some information I didn't know, so I did get something new out of it, however the storyline revolves around the mother of the Indigo girl going to prison after being caught during a drug deal, so I don't think is a movie to watch with your Indigo child, however this could be debatable, since I did watch it with my 10 year old Indigo/diagnosed autistic son (I didn't know what the story was about) and he did watch the whole movie with me, something that in itself is rare, he mostly likes to watch childrens movies, in the beginning of the movie they showed some of the Indigo girl's drawings and there was something in this drawings that got his attention and made him interested in the movie.  I think in general you could expect to get some helpful information about Indigo children, unless you already know everything there is to know about this children.  I have to add, that there was no drug ussage or violence shown in the movie, there were guns but nobody actually used the guns.",1197590400,,1035,4.470899470899471
2199943,1,B00074DXEY,"... I don't know any better word to describe it.  This DVD is just plain dumb, an insult to the intelligence and spirituality of even the ""average"" person. It completely lacks any sense of spirituality and wisdom.  It is completely void of providing any real explanation for this so-called ""phenomenon"".  And, on top of that, it is just made poorly:  poor story line, poor acting, two-dimensional characters, just plain dumb.",1192838400,8,425,5.0285714285714285

It's about time there are people who aren't afraid of the nay-saying masses to bring us films which bring some enlightenment to those of us who are open-minded.

Films like this one can take all of us a step further to understanding what is really happening to these children, who need our loving and unconditional support, not drugs and humiliation.",1189296000,2,482,4.962962962962963
2199946,4,B00074DXEY,"While the movie was OK from my perspective, my 10 year old loved it.

After watching it she said ""so that's why I think that way - I AM normal!"" She has had a few movie play dates so she can show her friends the movie and whenever she is feeling different I have noticed that Indigo is selected for her portable DVD player. This is usually the sign of a good movie for my kids.

It was great to find a movie that normalises differences Indigo kids can sometimes feel.

2199947,4,B00074DXEY,"Everything Was great ..  i even bought a book about indigo children :) .

What i did not like though is the fact that they see dead people and that is something can never happen.",1173744000,3,178,4.057142857142857
2199948,5,B00074DXEY,"""Indigo"" was co-written by and starring Neale Donald Walsch, author of bestseller ""Conversations with God,"" and also co-written by James Twyman, author of ""Emissary of Light,"" and was produced and directed by Stephen Simon ""Somewhere in Time"" and ""What Dreams May Come.""  Sounds like an awesome team to me.

The story begins with Grace/Gracie, obviously a different child with interests and capabilities beyond that of most people. Very early in the movie, Grace speaks of beings that live in the trees, draws pictures of an energy grid in the sky, and ""sees"" things psychically.  There is obvious animosity between Grace's mother (Cheryl) and her mom's rich father (Ray).  Ray does not like or accept Grace's father (Alex). Ray's business has financial problems and he is a business-first, family-later guy. Ray gets a call from the police, when Cheryl gets arrested on a serious charge just at a time when people are protesting and blocking his next business venture involved with cutting down trees.  Of course, Cheryl has to wait in jail while Ray tends to business first, but the business goes belly-up.

Fast-forward to 5 years later, and Cheryl is about to come up for a probation hearing. She is expecting to be released. Ray doesn't visit Cheryl in jail and he has no money. Alex is still evading the law.  Gracie is in a foster care home. Cheryl hears that Gracie may be in trouble, and calls Ray for help. When Ray goes to see Gracie, she tells him about being connected to other children by the ""web"" (NOT the internet), later referred to as the grid. Gracie continues to see into the future. It was too cool when she called her grandfather ""dimensionally challenged,"" because he only believed what he saw with his eyes. Anyway, Ray takes Gracie away, to protect her from danger. This is where Ray's journey with Gracie begins, and where you begin to understand what an ""Indigo"" child is.

For some reason, the special features in the DVD wouldn't work, but that's OK.  I loved the movie.  There is also some beautiful high-altitude Oregon scenery in this video, combined with a beautiful story.  It may raise your consciousness a bit, or, if this energy-psychic business is not in your belief system, then you can just enjoy this as an uplifting story with beautiful scenery---but, it's so much more than that. There is also healing and spirituality in the story-line.  What a beautiful story!--and what a great time to be alive to watch it.",1170547200,6,2454,4.83054892601432
2199949,4,B00074DXEY,"this movie shows us a lot of how we as a people seem to ignore the little things that children seem to know. I found the movie very enlighting because I see the same things in my child as they showed within the movie, How she seems to know thinigs that most of us have forgotten or how just by being next to you when you are feeling sick seems to make one feel better and even better the next day. I would recomend this movie to anyone who see things with thier child that most belive not to be reality.",1162512000,4,503,3.99009900990099
2199950,4,B00074DXEY,"Although this is a fairly well-done movie, it is obvious that many of the actors are 'acting' - that is, they have not done enough acting to forget that they are acting instead of 'being the character.' It also raises some important spiritual issues, especially for families of faith.  To understand this movie, one must believe in what most people call the spirit 'world.'  [In this movie, they sort of likened it so some kind of Cosmic Internet.]  It is also important to understand that in that realm there are both good and evil spirits.  [We could not know what good spirits are if there were no evil spirits.]  In Judeo-Christian culture, God is the leader of the good spirits; Satan or the devil is the leader of the evil spirits.

While I commend the movie makers for addressing such an issue, I think they should have made clear that there is both a good and dark side of human interaction with such spiritual forces.  I also think it should have been shown through some kind of established religious institution; it is through the experience and spiritual wisdom of one's spiritual body that one learns to recognize the good from evil spiritual forces.  The absence of such a foundation may leave one exposed to forces of evil they may not recognize if they try to 'play' with these spiritual forces.

Within that context, it is a pretty good story.  It probably would have been better if the plot had been simplified and focused more on how little Grace was able to tap into the spirit world and even why she was able to do it.  Still, this movie should provide lots of discussion for traditional values families, especially families of spiritual faith.  There should be lots to talk about for families that don't believe in such spiritual forces, as well.",1154044800,5,1767,4.664516129032258
2199951,2,B00074DXEY,"Nobody could call me a sceptic, or one who dismisses new concepts at the drop of a hat. However, this film just did not ring true. The ultimate intention of the film is to display the much talked about psychic awareness of the so called 'indigo' children. This, however, is not done convincingly enough, the main message of the film appears belaboured at best. The indigo children in this film are idealized to unnecessarily impossible proportions. They are made to look like angelic beings, unsullied by the ground they walk upon. This picture of children just did not fit in for me. All children have a bit of a brat inside them, thank God for that. Any accurate representation of children must include something of their devilish component, in some way.

Having said this, I must add that the basic idea behind this film is worthy of praise. It focuses on a situation where the protagonist is compelled to focus attention on his little granddaughter and her exceptional cognitive skills, after having avoided doing so for many years. Neale Donald Walsch springs a pleasant surprise with a virtuoso performance as the peppery grandfather. Indeed none of the actors can be discredited in any way for not doing a good job. The photography was excellent and one got to see some really breathtaking scenery. If it had not been for the trite, made-to-fit manuscript, the film would have been quite entertaining, even educative. As of now, it seems like a step in an exploration of a concept. Perhaps a step in the right direction, but yet too rough a diamond, needing more cutting and polishing.

The quality of the production may not be what we are used to, but the story is one that we will all have to get used to pretty soon, as I too have born witness to some of these phenomenon in our children.

2199953,5,B00074DXEY,"Originally, I wanted to see this film because some scenes were filmed in our friends town of Ashland Oregon. Even some of the scenes were filmed in their house. When I heard the stories about how creative they were on this low buget of $500,000 to make the film, I just had to see it. One of the interesting behind the scenes facts of this film is a story my friend told me about the ""bed scene"" in the middle of their street. She said that the props guys went to all the local thrift stores and spend lots of time and creativity to make this happen just right. She said they were so precise on every detail of how everything had to look. I thought it was interesting then to see the film after knowing some of the background things that happened.

I thought the film was great. Weather of not you believe in Indigo children or not. It has a great story line and some of the outdoors scenes are just beautiful. I also am giving this film a 5 star to combate those low ratings some viewers gave it, Geesh!

2199954,1,B00074DXEY,I am a mother of an indigo and crystal child and i was so looking forward to a movie about them that would educate the public and validate what i was going thru and this was just horrendous.  i was embarassed that i dragged my mother to see it with me.  i was hoping there would be some enlightenment about how every day indigos struggle at home and especially in school and out in suburbia.  it was just plain terrible.,1131408000,14,420,4.225
2199955,5,B00074DXEY,"Indigo is a very moving movie, speaking from an extremely intuitive, young, beautiful child who sees the world in a holistic way.  While I would say the movie is a little dramatized (yet without the dramatization, how would we start paying attention?), it brought me an eye-opening perspective about our gifted kids.  It is a movie attempting to bring awareness to our gifted children; therefore, it is impossible to bring every struggle, every perspective of the ""Indigo"" children into the lens of the movie.

Isn't it so weird that nowadays, people have all kinds of names naming people's abnormal ways of seeing, sensing and feeling as some sort of an illness?  Schizophrenics, depression, bi-polar disorder, ADHD, ADD, etc.  You name it, and this list is expanding.  But the medical community, as well as the ""normal"" (who I would refer to as completely closed-minded people who are full of fear - cannot handle the thought of viewing the world in a different perspective) people use these as labels, illness to blame some of the most talented kids.  Mental illness, you might blame on it ... and chemicals in the brain is the part to blame.  But if you think deeper, this is not entirely true. How can we blame someone who has ADHD, ADD, depression if our community have been closed minded, distant and refuse to be loving and supportive?  Depression?  What is it?  What if I tell you while it can be an indication of a brain disorder, it could be the most important trigger for a person's spiritual/inner transformation.  And now, why are we naming these gifted kids as ADHD, ADD just because they are seeing the world in a different way ... having an inner sense of knowing?  Labeling is not even an option.  Indigo children, while it sounds way better than a disease, are still boxing our precious children in a box.  When will we be able to understand that every human being brings their natural talent and ability to the world, I ask?  Ever ask yourselves why you hear about the word psychic and intuition and many get freaked out?  Indigo, while it has the basis that it is the color of the gifted ones' aura, is still a word boxing human race, human minds.

We as adults have a different role on our children nowadays.  We are no longer parents, big brothers, sisters who have absolute authority to make the kids to do things according to what we think the world should be.  We as adults need to be open, loving and connected to others and to our dearest kids.  Kids teach us so many things.  Just because we live in this rock long enough has no indication we are more spiritually evolved than our kids.  Kids can be great teachers, just as the elders.  Every human being's life has a lesson behind for us to reach out and to understand with an open heart.

I used to live in that box.  I used to get very freaked out with kids, adults who are psychics and who have intuition.  I used to find lots of weird explanation - possessed by daemons, they are terribly sick; they are crazy as a way to explain who these people are.  But only to realize the above explanations I have are all rationalizations without any basis.  Why are we judging these kids?  Yes, maybe they need more special love and care.  Yes, maybe they are a little different.  Yes, maybe they are little more delicate for ""normal"" human beings to mold them and to coach them for success.  But it is also time for us to open our precious heart and be compassionate.  Listen to them without judgment; invite unconditional love, joy, peace and serenity for ourselves and to our wonderful kids.  Let us don't try to suppress their unique senses and gifts.  Please ... help them exceed their potentials and help our souls to be evolved to a more loving, compassionate stage.  Yes, it is going to be a little bit weird and hard to learn and to understand them.  But human brains have a great capacity for new learning and understanding; we just need to open our minds and hearts for it.",1130025600,16,3958,4.561702127659575
2199956,2,B00074DXEY,"I'm an indigo transitioned to Crystal (whatever that means, I'm still trying to fully understand). I'm also a kindergarten teacher and have taught grades 5-8. I was very hopeful about this film.

The plot, acting and presentation were nice. I also enjoyed the depiction of the abilities the children had (for the most part anyway).

However, I did not at all resonate with the flippancy, disregard and put-downs of adults written into the script for the little girl's part. Nor did I care for the portrayl of her as some kind of ""woman-child"". Are Indigo's often more mature and aware than most? At times. But they are also very much CHILDREN...

Nor did I care for the depction of the children's exclusionary ""special place"" they meet one another. Is such real? Surely not as depicted.

The interviews with Doreen Virtue (could she be any more botoxed?) and the writer (seemingly a fawning hollywood queen?) left me wondering if I was watching the home shopping network by mistake.

The writer is supposedly the one who was taken to a ""secret monestary"" in Eastern Europe, by a ""secret order of monks"" to meet and interact (again, in secret) with super psychic Indigo children, so he could ""bring their message to all humanity""... (Which supposedly prompted his first book on the kids and which he recanted later btw). The whole thing just creeped me out.

Overall, it could have been so much more, and so much better... Just my two cents worth. For a much better take on the subject I'd say forget this movie and see ""Millions"", ""Pay It Forward"", or ""The Last Mimzy"" instead.",1129507200,9,1577,4.758241758241758
2199957,3,B00074DXEY,"This is a low budget film, produced and directed by high budget, veteran film producer Stephen Simon, who is a co-founder of the Spiritual Cinema Circle, because he is interested in being involved in films that ask who we are and why we are here. The Spiritual Cinema Circle is intent upon paving the way for films that provide inspirational messages that uplift the lives of its viewers.

This film is one such film. It revolves around the relatively new phenomena known as ""indigo children"". Indigo, a color that falls somewhere between blue and violet, is said to be the color of the life aura that emanates from those with psychic ability. It is the color used in connection with children who have heightened sensitivities and emotional complexity. They are said to be able to communicate telepathically with others like them,  and foresee events. Hence, the use of the term, ""indigo children"" has come into play when referring to these children.  These indigo children, for the most part, have been born over the last ten years or so. Due to their psychic gifts, they are often misunderstood by others. Some believe that they have been sent by God to help right what has gone wrong in the world.

The film was co-written by self-styled Peace Troubadour James Twyman, the executive producer of the film, who is also the author of ""Emissary  of Light: A Vision of Peace"", which chronicles his 1995 life defining experience in the mountains of Croatia. He co-wrote the  ""Indigo Children"" script with Neale Donald Walsch, author of the best selling book, ""Conversations with God"", which spent about three years on the New York Times Best Seller List. Walsch also has a starring role in the film.

The film focuses on a family in crisis. Ray (Neale Donald Walsch) is the patriarch of this totally dysfunctional family. He appears to be a well-to-do real estate developer of some sort for whom environmental concerns are low on the totem pole of his priorities. He also appears to be under a great deal of pressure from his financial backers. When his business eventually goes belly up, Ray is estranged from both his son and his daughter. So, when his daughter gets herself into some trouble and eventually entrusts her special daughter, ten year old Grace, to his not so tender mercies, Ray will begin a spiritual journey that will take him full circle.  Ray will not only learn that his granddaughter, Grace, is an ""indigo"" child, he will discover more about himself in the short time that he spends with her than he has in a lifetime.

This is a film that is conceptually interesting. The problem with its deficiencies lies primarily with the script. The story is simply not really well-fleshed out. The viewer may know that Ray's children are estranged from him, but the reasons later proffered in flashback somehow seem too insubstantial to account for the intense animosity. There are a number of subplots, as well, none of which are developed to the point of being particularly meaningful. Moreover, the way that the viewer is given an explanation of the phenomena of indigo children is terribly contrived. There is little finesse in the way that the film delivers its message. Moreover, there is an amateurishness about the film, overall.

Still, I thought Neale Donald Walsch was surprisingly good in the role of Ray, as he looked quite patriarchal. He infused the role with a great deal of credibility and was totally believable. The viewer cannot help but feel for him, which is why it is hard to believe the animosity that his son, daughter, and former wife harbor for him. The actress who plays ten year old Grace, Meghan McCandless, does what she can with the way that her pivotal role is written. It is a very two dimensional portrayal, as she exhibits none of the complexities often associated with indigo children. This lies more in the way in which her role was written, however, rather than any deficiencies on her part.

Notwithstanding some of the film's shortcomings, it is a film that has its interesting moments. The concept of psychic gifts is not grounded here in science fiction but rather, in spirituality, which is an intriguing way to look at such. The film also does have some life affirming moments,  as Ray engages in self-realization about some of the choices he has made in life.  This is a film that was an Official Selection of the Durango and the Ashland Film Festivals. It was also an Official Selection of the Santa Fe Film Festival, where it received the Audience Choice Award. This is a film that is worth a rental, if one is interested in the concept of ""indigo children"".",1127606400,84,4615,4.789937106918239
2199958,2,B00074DXEY,"This was an attempt to bring the Indigo Children into mainstream awareness and without having read the other reveiws, I can say that for myself, I was very disappointed by this film. It relies on Old Paradigms in order to describe the New Paradigms. This was so 'formula'....'Hollywood' that the real power of these children was trivialized and contrived.

So much potential wasted. Sad. I don't know if it was a lack of money, focus, or pure intention...but so much was lost here.

Hoping for a better attempt later by another team.",1127260800,6,533,4.782608695652174

2199961,4,B00074DXEY,"Knowing about this movie for a few years, I was dreading the moment I would be able to watch it.  I feared that the attempt would be too horrible to bear, that it would fall in the 'Warm and Fuzzy' experience generated by a popular Indigo Children book, maybe even move into New Age.  While it was released in my area, I decided to wait for the DVD.  I just discovered it made it to that medium this week.  I am happy to report that my fear was unfounded, for the most part.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that I did enjoy the film. Yes, as other reviewers have pointed out, the story was weak with some acting that may not have been up to par.  But for an independant film producing an introduction to a very confusing subject, I thought it was fantastic.

So why the Four Stars instead of Five?

* The weak story DID take away from the message.  I have to tell people to ignore the carrying story and focus on the message.

* It only described a few Indigos and their styles without mentioning that there is a new set of circumstances for each and every child born.  NOT all can see and hear angels, for example.

* They do not explain that not everyone sees the connection as a net or web or grid.  Although a grid is a good visual, I know some who see the connection as more of a kind of well.

* While Indigos can and do know each other, and yes there is an odd inside language at times, the representation in the movie was a tad exaggerated... for effect, I assume.

Over all, this is a must see for several reasons.  It brings into the consciousness the Indigo Child and their oddities. It is a good use of media and should be supported.  It should also encourage others to show THEIR own version of the idea.

On a more personal note, it did not represent my own experiences for the most part, however I am a forerunner, which isn't an excuse, just an explaination.  When I have interacted, even before I understood what was happening, it was a wonderful fantastic feeling.  Grace and Nicolas in the film meet each other smiling like they were best friends meeting after a long time apart, that is how I feel when I meet another.  Although I don't know what they whispered to each other, it COULD be just a representation of the spiritual connection.  As to that language... once, before I understood, I had a conversation in front of a woman with someone I found later was also an indigo forerunner.  Later, I talked with the woman we were talking in front of, she asked us what we were talking about, she couldn't understand a word of what was said... it amazed me.  Apparently we didn't speak in just words, it was the most satisfying conversation I have ever had, btw.

To sum up my commentary, it is an excellent step in the right direction.  I would like to encourage other filmmakers to attempt to represent their versions of Indigo Children. Some things are meant to be a mystery, the existance of Indigo Children should not be.",1123804800,12,2949,4.345521023765996
2199962,1,B00074DXEY,"I have to disagree with those viewers who enjoyed this movie.  I thought it was the worst movie I had ever seen.  It was so bad that I was laughing thru most of it.  I am talking about the story, the writing and the acting.

I am a person who thoroughly enjoyed ""What the bleep do we know.""  They did a great job!!!

However, the INDIGO movie was a huge disapointment.  I am so glad I did not see it in the movies.  Personally, when Neale first started talking about this movie -- I (as well as many others) thought he was going to give INFORMATION about indigos. I am very interested in the topic -- I believe in them -- and I have one myself.  However, this movie was not informative.  It gave NO information except that there are some ""psychic"" and ""gifted"" children out there.  This movie was NOT about TRUE indigos.  There are a zillion indigos out there who are misdiagnosed with this and that -- this movie gave them NO justice.

Instead of researching about TRUE indigos and making a documentary (like many of us thought he would) he created a very stupid story about a bratty psychic girl.  It's like Neale decided to go ""hollywood"" and create a story he thought we would like.  YUCK!

I would not recommend anyone getting this movie unless you want a good laugh.",1123459200,12,1272,4.371794871794871
2199963,4,B00074DXEY,"First of all, I wish to state that I am a big fan of Neale Donald Walsch. His books have changed my perception about life and God completely. He was born into this world for a purpose - to show humanity that God talks to all of us. However, he is no born actor and I really wish that this would be the last movie he will act in! (But he MUST continue to write more books!) Neale IS an American prophet of our present time. (Even God told that to him).

Coming back to the subject on ""Indigo"", this movie shows all the viewers the possibility of other planes of existence. The central theme of this movie contains a great Truth about pure minded souls. These souls have the ""natural"" ability to communicate with angels and other souls from the astral world. Adults must NOT hinder their ability to do this as it would hamper the spiritual growth of the child. These Indigo souls will bring up the human consciousness of our planet and they are not to be feared. Those skeptics who doubt the existence of life beyond our physical universe are shutting themselves out from the Inner Voice which everyone actually hears but hardly listen to. Thus they view every spiritual phenomenon with contempt and disgust.

The message this movie gives to the world deserves a 5-star rating. But on insight, the acting was not great (but NOT terrible) and the movie fails to state the reason why some children have this capacity of talking to angels and why most can't even think deeply about spiritual Truths. Other than that, this is a very touching movie which will definitely melt every heart which is pure and soft.",1119139200,15,1604,4.527586206896552
2199964,4,B00074DXEY,"I felt that this movie was a decent first attempt at opening up the subject of Indigo Children for discussion. The movie in my opinion focused on a psychic child and not all Indigo children are psychic. I wish that the child was a better representation of an Indigo Child which Jan Tober and Doreen Virtue have done such a great job explaining in their books.  Many people in the audience brought their children to see the movie and it was not a children's movie. This was a brave first attempt to bring this information mainstream.

The movie sponsors were selling a CD called Indigo Dreams at this event. I was already familiar with and using this CD with my son. This CD has been a fantastic addition to my childs life.  All children would benefit from the meditation and stress management techniques presented in story format on this new CD.  This is something that can actually help Indigo and all children.",1118448000,8,912,4.611111111111111
2199965,3,B00074DXEY,"I rented this despite my skepticism and I really did want to like it. I do believe in Indigo children who are appearing more frequently as a desperate heavenly mandate to correct the growing problems of our world. The producers of this film set out on a noble goal to bring attention to this phenomenon. What they forgot was the story. From watching it, it was obvious to me that the writer created a story from an idea that he wanted to write about Indigo children, instead of developing a plot/story that features an Indigo child. There is a difference, and it clearly shows. The scenes were flat, the delivery was flat, the dialogue was stilted and the film as a whole lacks an emotional pull. Its a shame and I do hate knocking this film because of its important message...but sometimes making a film that is so focused on a message, it comes across as propaganda or didactic instead of an inspirational story that works. I would give it one star, but because this is a first attempt to bring attention to Indigo children and that the efforts of everyone involved is noble, I can't fault them for failing to deliver a more polished story.

What we have is a story about an older man (in his 60s?) who has failed at being a good family man (though most of what we see is in flashbacks and still not compelling enough to convey just why his family dislikes him so). Somehow, his daughter gets mixed up in something and gets arrested, and its up to the father to look after her child, a precocious Indigo child. He's all logic and set in his ways, but she's mysterious wisdom who teaches him a few things. A bit hokey, especially when they meet up with another Indigo child with his mother, who's job in the script is to explain to the audience via a dialogue with the man just exactly who Indigo children are. Its a weak moment in the story and obviously contrived for our benefit.

What I did like about the film was when the grandfather and Indigo girl get a ride with a group of teenagers on a road trip. Surprisingly to me, the teenage girls were the best actors in the film and had the best dialogue...not to mention that they were cute and funny. The other aspect of the film I enjoyed was the cinematography, all those beautiful shots of Oregon's great outdoors.

I do agree with the intentions of the filmmakers and the Spiritual Cinema Circle to create spiritually minded films designed to uplift and inspire moviegoers. Unfortunately, they still need to work on their story development. I simply didn't find the plot of this film to be original, inspiring, realistic, or necessary. Until they release another one, there are better made spiritually-minded films to watch: ""Dragonfly"", ""Field of Dreams"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"", ""The Others"", and ""I Heart Huckabees"" to name but a few. Supposedly ""The Celestine Prophecy"" movie has just finished filming and the ""Embraced by the Light"" movie is currently under production. Until then...we have to find inspiration in better crafted Hollywood productions.",1118275200,24,3018,4.67984934086629

I persume that these harsh reviewers may be a bit discontented from their hearts and want to keep everything everso logical. Well, guess what, the time of reason is a'changing, and even though this movie does not boom with celebrated movie stars or a famous director, it has a sweet innocense that is rarely seen in mainstream movies. Made with a modest $500,000 budget, I feel that the creators behind this work wanted to do good and I am glad someone finally tried to do something on the topic of indigo children. For those who simply DON'T BELIEVE in these kids, I have personally seen many of them and don't doubt at all. And no, they don't all have attention deficit disorder.

Mr. Twyman is an informed and interesting spiritual leader and has produced several important courses involving sppirituality and now his experiences with actual Indigo children. He wrote the film to introduce people to these remarkable kids and their message to mankind.  Not a wealthy man, many of the subscribers to his writings donated much of the money to get the project started. He was fortunate to have a Director of the caliber of Steven Simon to work on this and another spiritual giant - Neale Donald Walsh"" to be a part of this undertaking.  It is a film that everyone should see to have in idea of what these children represent.  Their message is for the good of all people and whether you believe it or not, maybe it's time to look at the message and not the messenger.  Twyman laid everything he had on the line to produce a work to carry an important message, regardless of sacrifice and should be applauded.  If a couple of million dollars more were available it could have been a little fancier, but not better.  The film was (I believe) the most viewed opening world premier of any independent film this year - Certainly worth another look by the skeptics.

It was rather mysterious for those of us who were not familiar with the term ""indigo children"" & who have not read the books on this topic. The connections to help us understand were sadly missing. I realize this was a low-budget film but lack of money doesn't necessarily correlate with lack of clarity or point of view (as short movies by almost indigent film students can demonstrate). The acting was stiff, including that by Donald Neale Walsch who was basically the lead actor in the film. Despite his character having quite undesirable qualities for much of his life, and being post-middle age, he managed to have a rather tolerant, together, young, & attractive female partner in the film. This is a stereotype already found in mainline films & I was surprised to see it appear here as well. I think the filmmaker(s) could have done a better job of ""connecting the dots"" for those of us not in the know so we could come away with enough understanding to explain to others who & what these indigo children are - and why we should care about them.

""Indigo"", the movie, does no more than use the ""spiritual"" as a commercial hook -- it's the same dramas we've seen redundantly. Nothing enlightening going on with this movie. We all have ""attention deficit disorder"", as Indigos are claimed to have. Most of us can't look at a candle flame for ten seconds without a thought entering our mind.  Lee Carroll will probably continue pacifying his audiences with lies, when the truth may possibly be that some children are agitated from serious, unconscious psychological problems, albeit from past lives. People know the truth when they hear it.  That's why Kryon flops and ""What the Bleep"" is a phenomenon.",1111363200,16,762,5.08
