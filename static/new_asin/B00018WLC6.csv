8617359,4,B00018WLC6,"I knew that this issue of ""Yo Tambin Soy De Jalisco"" by Producciones Albarran B & M was not a restored copy of the original movie, so I was not expecting much. Indeed, although the image is reasonably sharp and free of blemish almost all the way through, the sound is poor in places. As for the content, it is not a masterpiece; it is just an entertaining movie for those of us who enjoy the old ranchera genre leavened with a little comedy and are fans of Luis Aguilar and Chicote. As such, it delivers in all counts, plus an amusing tidbit. One of the interesting things about D. Luis was his great versatility and willingness to venture into challenging territory (like when he danced a charleston with unexpected virtuosity in ""El Gallo Giro""). This movie has one of those ""against type"" moments, unfortunately marred by a degraded sound track. Nevertheless (SPOILER ALERT!!), it is still a treat to hear Luis Aguilar, who was a powerful baritone, doing a credible tenor as ""Edgardo"" in a tongue-in-cheek representation of the sextet from Act II of Donizetti's ""Lucia de Lammermoor"". A priceless moment.

Incidentally, absolutely contrary to the blurb on the back cover of this DVD, this is NOT a story about a psychiatrist or an insane asylum at all. There is one scene that takes place in a psychiatric hospital, but Luis Aguilar plays a rancher from Jalisco -- not in any way, shape or form a doctor of any kind. It is totally incomprehensible why the publisher would attribute a completely bogus storyline to this motion picture.",1361404800,,1537,4.735074626865671
