I just hate that I can't watch the next two, Amazon put it on instant video. I am sure it would be popular because of Jay Ryan's Beauty and the Beast,",1410912000,,286,4.125
8566918,5,B00BE4YCSW,"I also purchased this season because Jay Ryan is in it from Beauty & the Beast,I was not real happy when I received it & it wouldn't play on my laptop,I played season 1 & 2 on my computer & they played fine,I looked on the packing slip of season 1 & it said that If I didn't have a player other than US or Canada that it wouldn't play,well it plays so I went ahead & ordered 3rd season,keeping my fingers crossed that it would play but it doesn't. I 'll get it replaced hopefully whenever Amazon get's some more in.",1402790400,,515,4.0588235294117645
