8653931,3,B00JV054CO,"OK, filmed in the Philippines, Corman film.  A woman is bitten by the last of its kind cobra, turning her into a long-living ageless human appearing human-cobra hybrid.  She ends up having to have sex with men to keep young.  Marlene Clark as the Cobra Woman is beautiful, but the film, being a Corman low-budget endeavor, does not show any worthwhile Philippine scenics.  The quality of the DVD is excellent but I bought a used one and it had a glitch.  The chance you take, buying used.  The DVD has some extras, interviews with Clark and Corman, and a lot of trailers from the 70's and 80's.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1443312000,,630,4.522123893805309
8653932,3,B00JV054CO,"Filipino horror film that bears a striking resemblance to DEVIL WOMAN (1973) and BLACK MAMBA (1974) and even features some of the same actors. Oddly, this film came first and is the least interesting of the trio. Nurse Lena Aruza (Marlene Clark; BLACK MAMBA) and nurse friend Francisca (Rosemarie Gil; DEVIL WOMAN) are in the jungle looking for plants to use in medicine, when they spot the ""herb of long life"". Francisca doesn't believe in such nonsense, but since they are both nurses during World War II in an area of the Philippines that is teeming with enemy Japanese soldiers, Lena figures she can chew the herb to stay alert during the long hours she works at the mobile hospital where she and Francisca assist doctors patching-up injured soldiers. Lena finds a cave next to the rare herb and decides to explore it while Francisca keeps a lookout for the Japanese. The cave is full of paintings of snakes and Lena is bitten by a rare Firebrand cobra (it has a red diamond-shaped marking on its neck), while Francisca is attacked and raped by a Japanese soldier (played by Filipino genre vet Vic Diaz; SUPERBEAST - 1972). Lena transforms into the Cobra Woman (complete with red diamond marking on her neck) and suddenly becomes one with the snakes, while the Japanese soldier shoots Francisca once he gets his rocks off and throws branches over her body. Lena uses her newly-gained snake powers to heal Francisca and the film then switches to the present day (well, 1972, anyway), where Dr. Terzon (Vic Silayan; DAUGHTERS OF SATAN - 1972) is explaining to his UNICEF medical students the unknown qualities of snake venom enzymes. UNICEF student Joanna (Joy Bang; MESSIAH OF EVIL - 1973) wants to study the venom of the Firebrand cobra, but Dr. Terzon tells her that species of snake is probably extinct, except for rumors of a ""woman in the hills"" (care to guess who that is?) who may have one. Rumors also say that anyone bitten by a Firebrand cobra (combined with chewing on the ""herb of life"") will stay young forever, so Joanna sets out to find Lena to see if the rumors are true. Joanna finds Lena's jungle house rather easily and when she knocks on the door, she is greeted by an old-looking Francisca and is chased away by Francisca's obviously retarded son, Lope (Vic Diaz again, only this time he's a mute and slightly hunchbacked, with big buck teeth and a deformed right eye). Joanna heads back to he apartment, eats a box of Cheerios (!) and satisfies herself in her bed, fantasizing about her boyfriend Duff (Roger Garrett), who is about to arrive in Manila to keep her company. When Duff arrives (and steals an eagle off the streets, which he names Dirk!), he decides to visit Lena on his own and is bitten by Lena's pet Firebrand cobra, Movini, on his way to her house. Lena (who hasn't aged a day in 27 years) saves Duff, but when he wakes up, it is Francisca who is by his bed and she explains that her son Lope became deformed when he made love to Lena. It turns out that Francisca is not the biggest fan of Lena and she agrees to go get Joanna and Duff's pet eagle and bring them back to the house (It would seem eagles and Firebrand cobras are mortal enemies). Trouble ensues when Lena wants to keep Duff for herself and sends Movini to kill Francisca (successful) and Joanna (unsuccessful). When Dirk kills Movini (turns out that Lena needs to be bitten by Movini on a regular basis or she will grow old), it sets off a chain of events that puts everyone's lives in danger (Lena is forced to suck the life out of several locals and tourists to remain young). Can Joanna and Dr. Terzon come up with an antidote to Lena's youth-sucking powers before she sucks all the life out of Duff?  NIGHT OF THE COBRA WOMAN is a fairly cheap and badly acted horror film (the usually dependable Joy Bang [who had a short, but memorable acting career] looks like she is reading off of cue cards and everyone else seems like they are walking around in a hypnotic trance), complete with crappy time-lapse transformations and lots of female nudity. Director/screenwriter Andrew Meyer (an Andy Warhol protg who directed an obscure film called THE SKY PIRATE [1970], then directed the U.S. insert footage [featuring Lorne Greene] to a Japanese disaster film that was released here as TIDAL WAVE [1973/1975] and then disappeared from view, until his death in 1987) moves this film at such a slow pace, it's almost sleep-inducing (I really believe he had someone hypnotize the actors, because most of them talk in slow, monosyllabic tones). The only time the film picks up steam is when Marlene Clark drops her top or when Vic Diaz is on-screen. Diaz manages to give Lope a soul (I'm still trying to figure out the symbolism of why he carries around a hat made of feathers, though), even if he does look ridiculous in his hunchback getup. There's also a tasteless scene of monkey experimentation, skin peeling (Lena sheds her skin when she sucks the life out of her victims) and some pretty poor old age makeups, but that doesn't detract from the fact that 85% of the film is a bore. Also starring Slash Marks (the worst actor in the film and that's saying a lot!), Bert Rivera and Logan Clarke. Released theatrically by Roger Corman's New World Pictures. The VHS tape released by Embassy Home Entertainment is an edited, though still R-rated, 76-minute version of the film that is missing nearly nine minutes of footage shown in the theatrical release. Most of the missing footage is exposition, so count your blessings (although Joanna's self-satisfaction and a hotel room attack scene [with a cameo by the director] seems to be missing some footage). Available on DVD in its original aspect ratio by Scorpion Releasing. It's the only way to watch it, even though it is the same 76 minute version that is on the tape, only in widescreen. Also included on the DVD are on-camera interviews with Producer Roger Corman and star Marlene Clark and the original trailer. Rated R.",1408406400,2,5978,4.6717267552182165

Night of the Cobra Woman

The first Filipino horror film from the Roger Corman-founded New World Pictures, Night of the Cobra Woman is one of the earlier entries in the snake-themed Night of the Cobra Womanhorror cycle of the 1970s (which also includes such favorites as Jennifer, Killer Snakes, and Sssssss). This one's pretty strange and ratty even by drive-in standarsd of the time, which of course accounts for all of its charm today.

The fun starts during World War II as two nurses approach a cave on a tropical island. Lena (Ganja and Hess's Marlene Clark) goes inside to explore it and gets bitten by a mystical snake in the process, while her companion is raped and shot by a pudgy soldier (Filipino exploitaton legend Vic Diaz). Lena immediately transforms into a sensual half-snake creature who can use the venom of her slithery friends to heal her wounded friend. Flash forward to the '70s as venom researcher Joanna (Messiah of Evil's Joy Bang) arrives on the same island with her boyfriend, Stan (Roger Garrett), and his pet eagle(!). Not surprisingly, Stan soon falls into the arms of Lena, who's stayed eternally young thanks to her magical snake mojo and the local snake god, Movini, but needs sex to keep herself beautiful. Oh, and occasionally she sheds her skin, and the deformed Diaz is still lurking around for comic(?) relief. On the downside, her male lovers are drained of their vitality and age instantly, with only snake venom able to restore their vigor. That means Stan's also helping her find more victims to keep himself intact, with only Joanna offering a possible permanent solution.

Obviously the main attraction here is seeing two '70s starlets at the start of their careers, with Clark making for an intoxicating presenceeven if the role itself doesn't demand a whole lot. Already a veteran TV and film actor (fresh off of Hal Ashby's The Landlord), she would soon go on to a string of odd cult films like Switchblade Sisters and Beware! The Blob. Ms. Bang (and no, that wasn't her real name) didn't stick around as long but managed to make an impression Night of the Cobra Womanon fans, even turning up opposite Woody Allen in Play It Again, Sam. Given its brief running time of 76 minutes (which still feels about right given the material), rumors abounded that (in typical Roger Corman fashion) a longer cut existed at one point, though if so it doesn't appear to exist now. In any case, what's here certainly feels complete enough and should satisfy B-movie '70s fanatics of all stripes. Night of the Cobra Woman

Following its theatrical run in a seris of double and triple bills, this film turned up on VHS from Embassy in an unbelivably murky transfer that made sitting through more than five minutes a major chore. The film then sat out the entirety of the '90s and '00s on home video, popping up eventually on Amazon as a streaming title from that same nasty, ancient master. Fortunately the 2014 DVD from Scorpion manages to wipe away decades of murk and neglect, featuring much more stable colors and a brighter, far more detailed appearance. It still looks like an ultra-cheap production, of course, but watching it is now an enjoyable diversion instead of a painful strain on the eyeballs. Roger Corman appears for a typically sweet interview (just under six minutes) in which he runs down the history of this film including the possible subconscious influence of the classic Cobra Woman, the ""really weird"" story, his thoughts on Joy Bang's stage name, the kinky poster art (""you could say it was a phallic symbol, and you'd be right""), and lots more. Then there's a truly fantastic 22-minute interview with Clark, who's been an enthusiastic presence on past DVD releases and seems to love this one quite a bit. Cobra wrangling, cockfighting, black candles, making The Beast Must Die, and other topics make for a lively chat from start to finish. The spoiler-laden theatrical trailer wraps up the set along with bonus previews for Screamers, Stripped to Kill, Sorceress, Seizure, Space Raiders (hey, you'll sound like a snake if you say all these titles in a row), Dogs, Grizzly, Sorority House Massacre, The House on Sorority Row, and Mortuary.",1403740800,3,4245,4.857734806629834
8653935,4,B00JV054CO,"""Night of the Cobra Woman"" is one of the more obscure of Roger Corman's low budget pot-boilers and it gets a nice reprise in this recent release onto DVD for the first time. There are a couple of good 'extras' on the disk: interviews with both the Afro-American serpentine star of the piece Marlene Clark, and Mr Corman himself - both recalling anecdotes about the film's original production.  Corman reveals that the Cobra Woman concept evolved from the fact that his company was shooting several pictures in the Phillipines back in the 1970's (mostly some of his infamous women in (jungle) prison flix) and things were going so well that he figured he should also try making a 'horror' film there.  Thus he flew a few American actors down to Manila and hooked them up with a bunch of cobras - resulting in the titular snake-woman vehicle.

The film itself is typical low-budget Corman fare featuring minimal production values and relatively clunky performances by the ingenue cast members but it is sorta fun to watch none-the-less.  Much 'suspension of disbelief' is helpful in buying the plot line that involves the lead character being bitten by a magical cobra which somehow grants immortality (rather than death) but requires the bitten individual to 'infect' others with her 'venom' in order to remain youthful.  Into the cobra woman's realm stumble a cute young female student (played by the awkwardly named: Joy Bang) who is doing her thesis on (appropriately enuf) snake venom! and her boyfriend who is coming to visit her.  The boyfriend gets fanged by the mysterious 'snake lady' who lives in the mountains and he develops what appears to be sorta a bad case of acne unless his new snakey lover gives him another dose of her particular brand of 'love juice'.  The cobra woman herself must regularly put the bite on people in order to maintain her youthful beauty and she starts to develop some disturbingly scaley skin disorders until she gets her next 'fix'.

In classic Corman fashion the film features a bit of nudity on the part of the cast's 2 female leads and there is new meaning given to the term 'skin-flick' as the snake-ish lead actress (literally!) sheds her skin a couple of times during the movie. Kinda creepy - but thatz all part of the fun and there are cobras-a-plenty slithering over everyone throughout.  The quality of the DVD transfer is excellent - despite the B&W box cover art the film is in color- and the run-time does match to the original 85 minutes (despite some conflicting info on the Amazon page).  Over-all I found this to be an amusingly quirky little flik with a nice DVD presentation... perhaps a good addition to one's Corman Collection.",1402876800,4,2688,4.811279826464208
