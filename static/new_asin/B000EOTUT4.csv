Because this presentation is from television it has that format where each step in the project has been set up ahead of time and you do not have to wait the whole time through each process.

The theme is summer favorites; however the projects can actually be year round. Well it may be a tad difficult making a sand castle in a hurricane.  In any event it is worth a watch.

It may take a tad of effort to navigate the menus as there is a hierarchy of project sections requiring you to start form the top menu to get to the sections you want.",1319241600,,730,4.268115942028985
2525469,2,B000EOTUT4,"Previous review gives excellent listing detail on what to expect in terms of projects and tips.
I bought the dvd set sadly to get a recipe for the scrumptous looking drink and dessert pictured on the cover. It's nowhere to be found in either of the 2 dvds.
Overall, as an intermediate level do it yourselfer and crafter i am glad i did not pay full price for this Dvd.

I liked some of the projects eg, making a bag out of a beach towel, the showercurtain game and the sponge waterball, as well the tips on grilling.
Overall though some of the projects are alittle too ""simple"". For example, making ""iced coffee"" literally shows Martha pouring already made hot coffee into a cup of ice and adding suger and milk to taste...to me it was bordering absurd.",1182729600,11,753,4.456521739130435
2525470,3,B000EOTUT4,"This is one of Martha's latest DVD's that she is presenting with a seasonal theme to it. It is good but not her best, mainly because it is being compared to her other DVD contents and offerings. The compilations are episodes from her previous TV show format ""Martha Stewart Living"". The problem is they are mostly from episodes taped within the past 6 years, therefore there is much missing from the early and middle years.

What is here is good, with Disc Two being the better of the set, because of the recipes. But I can recall many other summer episodes from the early and middle years that would have been welcomed. Also, this is a rather short offering of projects and decorating and recipes. I think the problem is that they wanted to keep it as up-to-date as possible, and rather than reach into the archives of a different time and place, they tried to stay within the episodes of the new millenium. The price is good, and so are some of the sections.

Disc One:

BEACH PROJECTS: beach bags/ sarong tie dye/ flip flops/ sand castle sculptures and tools kits/ superhero cape towels

KIDS PROJECTS: lemonade stand/ toy sailboats and motor boats/ bean bag toss/ sponge ball/ pitching tents/ map and compass skills

PICNIC PROJECTS: picnic flatware roll/ striped picnic blanket/ hankerchief pitcher cover

OUTDOOR DECORATING: oilcloth place mats/ tablecloth weights/ citronella candle/ button napkins

CLELBRATE AMERICANA: fireworks apron/ red, white, and blue garland/ red, white, and blue tarts (which was quite good)/ patriotic votives

Disc Two:

BBQ FAVORITES: ribs and sauces/ chicken, ribs, and macaroni salad/ leg of lamb and grilled veggies

GRILLING: asado sausages/ grilling seafood/ grilled fennel and onions/ charcoal vs. gas grills/ grill tools

SIDE DISHES: corn-on-the-cob/ pink gazpacho/ potato salad/ corn relish

REFRSHING DRINKS: iced tea/ iced coffee/ papaya lime cooler/ southern drinks

DESSERTS: sand dollar cookies/ summer berry cobbler/ ice cream brownie bars/ bananas foster

You will find things to do, and make, on your own or with family and friends. The sand sculpture section would be great with kids. Enjoy the summer compliments of Martha.",1151971200,23,2178,5.1158192090395485
