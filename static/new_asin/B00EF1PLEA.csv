5911040,5,B00EF1PLEA,"Zetman is an excellent example of a great superhero anime. Next to Guyver and Devilman (in my opinion), Zetman gives out lots of intense action sequences, an amazing storyline, romance, morality, and great character development. I'm not going to lie, I've never read the manga but, the anime adaption gave me a chance to see this hero in action. I was thankful for getting this anime for christmas and had time to watch all 13-uncut episodes (seems short but, its amazingly good) which gave me much enjoyment. If you ever get the chance to watch this amazing superhero anime; watch it, rent it, or buy it because its worth every penny.",1389052800,4,635,4.72972972972973
5911041,4,B00EF1PLEA,"Be patient with Zetman and it will grow beyond the sum of its parts.  The animation is gorgeous and I don't throw that around with every review.  The fights are over the top and highly stylized.  I can't remember the last time I audibly said, ""Hell yes!"" during a fight.  The fan service, nudity and violence is there in the beginning, but politely steps aside to make way for an actual story.
In Zetman, the super rich, in their infinite wisdom and bloated boredom, paid scientists to create a race of combat prone monsters to fight to the death in an arena for amusement.  The monsters got smart, fed up, and killed their way out of captivity and up to the streets.  They found a way to mask their powers and appearance and now lurk in the shadows wearing a human disguise.

The two heroes of the show are made to be polar opposites to invite an interesting contrast.  One is literally homeless, being raised and passed around between hobos and strippers.  The other is a rich kid.  The vagabond kid is our hero, Zetman, and his powers are organic.  The rich kid uses his money (Batman/Iron Man) to make a suit with which to dispatch monsters.

 It's an adequate premise that paves the way for some great fights and some even greater animation.  The contrasting philosophies of our two heroes keep the narrative intelligent and the credibility of the show above mindless violence.

The ending brings a conversation about racial genocide to the table that completely comes out of left field.  It takes this entertaining slug fest to a very serious place and as a result, it graduates into a great anime.  It couldn't get 5 stars, because it's not groundbreaking work, but when compared to all the anime out there claiming action and depth, it easily bumps them aside demanding to be taken seriously.",1387670400,7,1800,4.6455696202531644
5911042,5,B00EF1PLEA,"I have not read the associated manga upon which this anime is based, so this is an unbiased review of the DVD not based on comparing the storyline of both versions. That said, this is a highly interesting take on superhero tropes by creator Masakazu Katsura (TIGER & BUNNY). While obviously greatly influenced by elements from earlier examples of the genre like Yoshiki Takura's BIO-BOOSTER ARMOR GUYVER and Go Nagai's DEVILMAN, along with Katsura's own earlier WINGMAN, there is a nuanced subtext here beyond the action and violence that explores what it means to be a hero, or what motivates someone to become a hero. The relationship between the two main characters, Jin Kanzaki (Zetman) and Kouga Amagi (Alphas) is reminiscent of the relationship between Akira Fudo and Ryo Asuka in DEVILMAN. The ""Players"", genetically created monsters who masquerade as humans in this series, remind me of the Zoanoids from GUYVER. As in Katsura's TIGER & BUNNY, the entire series revolves around the relationship and contrast between the motivations of the two main characters. In fact, the motivations of Kouga Amagi for becoming a ""hero of justice"" as he calls himself, go back to Katsura's WINGMAN from the 1980s, in which the main character is inspired/obsessed with becoming a hero based on a childhood love of anime and tokusatsu heroes. This tale is a much darker exploration of those themes than seen in either WINGMAN or TIGER & BUNNY. It makes you ponder the underlying assumptions behind the whole superhero genre in a way similar to WATCHMEN or KICK ASS. While there are no definite conclusions to be gained for these probing questions, the very fact that it makes you consider these ideas makes it worthy of inclusion among the most insightful takes on this genre. Is ZET destined by his own genetic origins to betray humanity to the Players? Although he seems sincere in his desire to serve justice, is Alphas really only seeking personal glory? In the end, despite the darkness of the story, it does deliver an inspirational message: ""Keep your head up. You won't find hope lying on the ground!""

Animation and characterization here, as well as character design, are all pretty much top-notch throughout. There are many supporting characters in the story, perhaps a few too many to explore all the relationships in the depth they deserve in this 13-episode condensed version of Katsura's original manga (which has been running for 11 years in Japan - currently with 19 tankobon collected volumes). I hope that VIz will make an English language translation of the manga available soon if the anime is well-received by western audiences.

One side note: the series is complete on 2 discs in the DVD format, not 3 discs as listed in Amazon's product description. I own this DVD set.",1386460800,5,2784,4.946581196581197
5911043,5,B00EF1PLEA,I saw this on Neon Alley and was hooked. Great story and anime. Truly recommended. Why be long-winded in the review. I believe you will like it.,1385769600,3,144,4.37037037037037
5911044,3,B00EF1PLEA,"Under normal circumstances I would give this a 4 rating but for a release in 2013 I would expect better than 2.0 audio on a bluray release.  The story is fairly original so I don't think I can describe this one without spoiling it for others, it's a good story albeit a bit predictable.  I'll be honest, I purchased this item somewhere else that was a bit cheaper so given the shortcomings I think this title is worth picking up when it hits around 30 bucks.  The series is 13 episodes long.",1384560000,4,491,4.315217391304348

8604961,2,B00EF1PLEA,"I don't know about anybody else, but for me Zetman was like X-men meets Batman ... on crack lol. The anime had a great set up but, it wasn't executed very well and at times was just down right corny as hell. Zetman had a good start but then it kinda tailspinned and eventually came crashing down in flames. A damn shame really as it could have been great. Instead, it was mediocre and forgettable. The animation was pretty good, but that was about it. The soundtrack sucked, the VA's did a mediocre job, the plotline went down hill fast and got way too cliche, and there was little to no character development.

Disappointed really...",1488758400,,634,4.51304347826087

8604963,4,B00EF1PLEA,"Zetman is pretty good. I saw the partial preview on the Neon Alley segment at the beginning of most of the Viz releases recently. Out of all the show ciips shown that I wasn't familiar with, this one caught my attention. The action sequences are pretty radical and the various color transformations of Zet are interesting. I have only watched half the series so far, but am happy with it. I am hoping the next half is just as good if not better. I am not super into the giant-robo or mobile suit anime (although there are some exceptions), but after seeing this, I am becoming interested in the bio-transformation-man type anime. I will likely explore similar type concepts in anime. I'll probably buy Guyver next.",1471737600,4,714,4.674603174603175
8604964,3,B00EF1PLEA,To people who haven't read the manga the show would seem like its missing parts but that's what they can only show for 12 episodes. I recommend finding it used with a cheap price tag.,1450742400,3,183,4.257142857142857
