It also loses any minimal semblance of suspense when you can see the technical operators and microphone boom equipment reflected in any and all surfaces.

5373030,4,B009YQJ33G,"This movie was absolutely terrible. There were continuity errors in practically every scene, no plot, and I'm pretty sure one of the actors only agreed to be in it if he got to be drunk the entire time.

That being said, watching this lead to one of the best nights of the summer. My dad and I went into this expecting Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. We quickly realized our mistake, but we couldn't stop watching the train reck that is this movie. We made sarcastic remarks the entire time, laughing our butts off. The best part was reading the reviews once we were done. We found reviews all over the internet that put our utter shock and horror into words, and only made the entertainment last longer.

I would 100% recommend this movie if you're with sarcastic, witty friends, and you really need a good laugh.",1432252800,3,816,4.54421768707483

5373034,1,B009YQJ33G,"The cover caught my attention while at the library so I decided to check it out. I thought it was going to be like Hansel & Gretel:Witch Hunters but it was far from it. This was one of the worst low budget movies I've seen. The special effects were horrible. Scenes were repeated. I've seen many low budget or B movies but this was a first with repeated scenes.

5373038,3,B009YQJ33G,"I didn't hate this film because I very quickly started a game of spot the mistakes with my family and this kept away the boredom that would otherwise have consumed us. To say it was badly made and poorly acted would be an understatement, never has Eric Roberts looked so bad from playing peak a boo behind the walls to the poor copy of the training scene in buffy (we are expected to believe the girl learnt martial arts from Eric Roberts throwing balls under arm at her head). There are so many mistakes in this movie you could make a rather good drinking game out of it if you got friends round. I was however pleased to see that our heroin didn't not kill the mistress of all evil whilst wearing a hoodie as this would have been beyond awful but did look that way, but instead did it in a open checked shirt with a continuously changing top underneath much more in keeping with the films continuity issues. There are no woods, ginger bread houses, weapons with the exception of a rather pathetic looking knife which both sides seem to have position of when they need to kill people, and barley Hansel and Gretel until our lead characters get a name change in the last few minutes. The final battle is no existent and the all powerful witch has about as much power as a fish on a bicycle. All in all this film is great if you don't take it seriously and borrow it off someone else but do not waste money on it as you will feel you have been robbed!",1394236800,,1450,4.276363636363636
5373039,2,B009YQJ33G,"I thought the acting was pretty good by the main actors. Sadly that was the best thing about this movie.

Let me first start off by telling you that there is no wardrobe like what you see on the cover. The twins do not wear black coats or do they have the same weapons. In fact, the girl doesn't even have magic fireball and the guy does. The girl has a small dagger and the guy doesn't have no long sword. I don't know what or where they got that cover from. Also, the cover shows a black spooky castle, there was no such thing inthe movie. It was at a private school the whole time!

Okay, now moving on with the rest of the movie. The story was somewhat good, but there were a lot of drags in the move. The directing could had been much better and didn't need to have extra scenes to speed up the movie. The stunts were pretty bad and props and CGI were terrible. But, that's what they had to use for a low budget film. So, in most youtube videos' effects were the same effects you would see in this movie.

If you love to watch these two twins than you wouldn't mind anything and still somewhat enjoy it. Their acting skills are great, so that part is pretty well set. If you're not fans of these two, then you probably wouldn't like this movie very much. I give this movie a below average grade.",1384819200,,1300,4.130434782608695
5373040,1,B009YQJ33G,"WARNING!!!!!!!! Whatever you do, do not watch this movie. Its is so slow,cheaply made and just plain awful. The special effects could of been made by a small child.

The opening monologue (which gives the impression that it was shot in one take) sets the tone for the whole thing.  The young girl is obviously reading her lines off a paper, and undoubtedly was never coached.  Every actor in this film is just awful, and the poor attempt at special effects made it even more obvious that the movie budget was practically zero.

5373061,2,B009YQJ33G,"What is the best thing I can say about Hansel and Gretel: Warriors of Witchcraft (2013), oh yeah, it was only 83 minutes long, instead of 90+ minutes.  Fivel Stewart and real life brother, BooBoo Stewart play - wait for it - brother and sister witch slayers, Ella and Jonah.  It was good to see Vanessa Angel again, sorry it had to be in such poor movie and one of my all time favorite ladies, Cherie Currie who does get a couple of scenes teaching one of the smallest classes I have ever seen, but at least it is outdoors and under a shade tree.  A couple of other decent players, none of whom I ever remember seeing before are Tyne Stecklein as Megan, Courtney B. Turk as Reiko, Kathryn Collins as Kristen and I felt she should have been given a much bigger role.  Then there was the BMOC played by Niclas Gillis as Landon and a brief role going to Judy Norton as Allyson.  Finally one of my least favorite actors Eric Roberts as Mr. Sebastian.

The whole thing takes place at one school, but they try and make you think it is two schools, but the opening scene at the first school is the same scene they use over and over in the movie.  The whole thing is a rush to make money on the coat-tails of the real Hansel and Gretel - Witch Hunters.  I won't spoil your fun and or give anything away, as if there were anything to give away.  You might watch this to see Fivel Stewart as I think she could go far in the movie business, as long as she doesn't get too many roles like this one.",1366675200,,1486,4.149825783972125

5373079,2,B009YQJ33G,"Having absolutely LOVED the ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" movie in the theater, I thought I'd check out this low budget knockoff, knowing full well in advance that it would probably be quite awful. But that's where things start to go awry, is the fact that it really isn't even the ""mockbluster"" it presents itself as, but rather a completely misleading and totally different kind of film altogether. The cover art would no doubt lead one to believe it's some sort of action-packed fantasy adventure, but the truth is it's more of an after school special geared towards teens and at the end of the day is just plain boring more than anything else. (They don't even wear the outifts they are pictured in, and there sure as heck ain't no castle!)

I won't rehash the plot as many others here have done already, but suffice it to say that any connection to Hansel and Gretel, the fairy tale or otherwise, is stretched pretty thin, and their idea of ""witches"" is simply putting the popular, stuck-up, mean girls in cheap hoods and calling it a day. No makeup special effects or anything to indicate they might be evil or otherworldly. I was almost tempted to double check that I hadn't stumbled across a set of 90210 outtakes or lost Saved By the Bell footage. The sets are okay, if not a bit sterile - the whole thing takes place on a small college campus - but there's only maybe three of them and it can get tiring looking at the same thing over and over again. I suppose the only aspect of this movie I can defend with a clear conscience, and the reason I'm perhaps being overly generous with a 2-star rating, is Fivel Stewart, who I actually found to be quite likeable in the lead role but has a tough time holding her own when all the other actors around her might as well be cardboard cutouts.

I admit I love my share of ""bad"" movies, and the fact a film is low budget shouldn't necessarily be a dealbreaker. But slapping the Hansel and Gretel moniker on any random teenage nonsense with the sole purpose of cashing in on a popular big-budget release struck me as pretty tacky. If ""Warriors of Witchcraft"" wasn't a total snoozefest in and of itself to start with I might be a little more forgiving of its blatant misrepresentation, but as it is, I'd advise leaving this one on the shelf.",1361145600,5,2296,4.490430622009569
5373080,3,B009YQJ33G,"This movie is a mockbuster and if you don't know what that is, it is basically a low budget film that comes out near the same time as a film that is hitting the theaters in order to increase the profit of the low budget film.  It's a bit of a manipulation tactic.

Anyways, I don't really pay much attention at what is hitting the theater because frankly, the theaters overcharge.  My wife and I were looking through Netflix for something to watch and came across this.  My wife said, people keep asking me if I have seen this and the description sounded interesting.  It did warn that it was a mockbuster but I never heard of the term so my brain probably read it as blockbuster.

It ended up being a B or C rated movie with weak acting, showing the same scene several times.  I was like, ""seriously, this movie made it to theaters?""  It was easy to figure out who the great witch was and who the witch hunter was.  The fight scenes were weak and lacking.  Why do I even give it three stars?  Because it did have some potential.  I kept a person wondering what is going on and was able to hold my attention.  There were good ideas in it, these ideas just needed to be taken further...a lot further.  I haven't seen the one in theaters yet but hopefully it is much better than this one.

At this school there is a circle of witches who feed the souls of students to the Great Witch. Seriously. Eric Roberts, who was in the worse production of ""Snow White"" is fittingly in this film. I won't say much more about the plot, not to ruin the film, but it just isn't worth talking about.

This is a film for young teens or younger, i.e. those who can't as yet identify bad acting or bad writing. The special effects are extremely cheap and includes a voice enhancer used in films with budgets under $1,000. When you get to the end, you have the feeling, ""That's it?"" Not worthy of an adult rental.

Parental guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. A girl comes on to Jonah. Kissing. She lays on his bed. They say ""Number 2"" instead of the ""S"" word, but do say ""kick-ass."" PG-13 for fighting and some killing. In many ways the Asylum knock-off was better.",1360022400,4,956,4.426136363636363

Story line was ridiculously simple, you knew what the entire story would be about 30 mins into the film, really bad acting on all parts, and the resolution of the film/battle was like child's play. Even if there was a lack of a good quality story line, the imagery, action or acting would've helped but there was none of that. There was no real suspense or drama.

Now that I've admitted to that, I'll say that ""Hansel & Gretel: Warriors of Witch Mountain"" or, wait, ""Witches of Warrior Street,"" er...this movie is terrible, even for a B-Movie. The box art is absolutely the best thing about it, but since I watched it on Netflix, I didn't even get that. This movie is actually about 2 siblings (Fivel & Boo Boo Stewart) going to a new school and running afoul of a ""coven"" of witches and an Abercrombie & Fitch model. To make a long story short, they find out that their real mother was a witch hunter, discover a knife with the magical properties of an ordinary knife, in that it makes things die when you stab it into them, and destroy the witches by deflecting their Adobe After Effects magic and using said knife.

For being directed by David Decoteau, this movie is severely lacking in rock hard abs and unnecessarily long shower scenes with naked men. I thought for sure that Niclas Gillis (the aforementioned model) would inexplicably get his shirt blasted off with ""magic"" and suddenly begin writhing around while it rained baby oil. Come to think of it, that may be the entire plot of Decoteau's next opus.

5373115,1,B009YQJ33G,"Although it cost about a million to make, ""Hansel & Gretel: Warriors of Witchcraft"" amounts to low-budget rubbish from fade-in to fade-out.  The cover art on the DVD is calculated to deceive.  Neither hero nor heroine ever are attired in the leather outfits that they wear.  They never wield swords, just knives with elaborate handles.  ""Final Stab"" director David DeCoteau started helming this kind of shoddy nonsense as far back as 1985, and he has called the shots on over 100 straight-to-video features.  The only celebrity actor in this supernatural nightmare is Eric Roberts, and he must have done it for the paycheck because ""Hansel & Gretel"" breaks no new ground.  This lackluster yarn follows a pair of real-life twins after they are expelled from one school and enrolled in another.  It seems Jonah (Boo Boo Stewart of ""Twilight"") cannot keep out of trouble.  Jonah's sister, Ellen (Fivel Stewart), has the brains of the family.  They wind up at an elite academy where the headmaster (Eric Roberts of ""The Expendables"") boasts about how some of their graduates when on to be presidents.  Suspiciously enough, Larson Tretter's shallow screenplay sounds like ""The Skulls.""  The incomprehensible plot unfolds with Jonah getting mixed up with the wrong types and participating in a ceremony where witch wannabes conjure up gilded swirling balls and launch them.  Ellen isn't invited into this inner circle.  She discovers an old piece of paper wrapped around a knife and concealed in a dresser.  It seems that their parents attended the same school and she learns that she is a slayer of witches.  The headmaster prepares her for her predicaments by slinging baseballs that she catches with relative ease.  Meantime, Jonah's friends try to convert him to their cause, but everything falls through for them.  One-dimensional characters cavort throughout this lethargic 83 minute silliness.  Nothing memorable or cool occurs.  There are no quotables lines.  DeCoteau would be great directing movies about clouds floating through blue skies.  The first half of the action--getting the protagonists from their first school to the present schoo--takes over a half-hour!  DeCoteau lingers endlessly on second unit shots of the dorm buildings and signs far longer than required.  The performances--with the exception of Eric Roberts (I'm no relation)--is abysmal.  Everybody blurts out their lines without feeling.  Similarly, everybody brushes their hair out of their eyes.  Apparently, the ability to groom themselves during action and dialogue qualified these stiff, mannequin-like thespians for this synthetic crap.  Foremost, ""Hansel & Gretel: Warriors of Witchcraft"" has nothing to do with the big-screen ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters.""
