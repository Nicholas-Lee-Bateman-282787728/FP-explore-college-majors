4388402,4,B004ITYDT8,"I received my copy yesterday, and browsed through it.  I didn't expect to find any flaws, but ... brace yourself ...

I found that shows #6-#8 (Mucho Loma) are all TIME COMPRESSED, with frame blending and a pitch increase throughout the whole program.

Thankfully, this does not apply to the rest of the episodes on the set.

I have not seen this on any other R&B release; I suspect the episodes appear this way because Classic Media is trying to save space on their discs when authoring and/or save money (yet they can fit ten episodes on one disc at the correct speed).  I hope a DVD replacement program will be offered.  For this so-called ""defect"" I give the set four stars instead of five.

In the meantime, this is still a good set, especially for the bonus feature: an unedited recording session from ""Goof Gas Attack"" (well, not completely unedited -- there are a few bleeps).  Also, at least I now have the complete series.",1301616000,20,932,4.572289156626506
4388403,5,B004ITYDT8,"The fifth and final season does not /quite/ match the image quality of earlier seasons. Though it's better than what I saw on TV -- the colors are brighter and there are more /of/ them -- there's more dirt, plus occasional color streaking along the sides. Yet some episodes are near-perfect. Go figure. Regardless, we finally have the complete series at what is probably the highest-possible quality level, barring a frame-by-frame restoration. (Disney's editions of 20 years ago attempted such a restoration, but were marred by Disney's editing down R&B's adventures to produce 60-minute tapes and disks.) It's taken ""only"" 30+ years to get the complete ""Rocky & Bullwinkle"" on home video in good transfers.

Given the need to churn out something every week, it's amazing /any/ TV series is of consistently good quality, let alone ""high"". * ""Rocky & Bullwinkle"" was written and performed by highly talented people, and was never less than ""very good"".

Of course, some adventures were better than others, and the chef d'ouevre of R&B's five seasons is the 12-episode ""Wossamotta U."". College athletics was and remains a ripe target, and though all the jokes are obvious, they're also funny. I particularly like the way the team's coach -- one Rocky Knute -- is a pot-bellied cigarette smoker (with a holder, yet). The climactic game is played with battle plans from the Civil War. (""Tha's War between the States!"")

There's also a classic moment when Fearless Leader shoots (and presumably kills) a player who made a mistake during practice. (""You were right. He got the light reprimand."") This would probably be unacceptable today. (It's hard to believe these shows are 50 years old!) Italian anti-defamation groups would object to the school's name, which parodies the English speech of Italian immigrants (qv, Chico Marx).

We also hear Wossamotta's thrilling fight song...

""Wossamotta, hats off to you!
To thy colors, ochre and Alice blue,
We will e'er be faithful and true!
Hail, Wossamotta, hail!
(Better we should be in jail!)
Hey, Wossamotta U.!

This adventure alone is worth the price of admission. You will watch it again and again. And again. You will be pestered by friends to play it. Don't say I didn't warn you.

* The British have the right idea, with series comprising only six episodes per season. Ditto for HBO, Showtime, and other premium cable networks, who give the producers time to create something of quality.",1301011200,33,2437,5.032258064516129
4388404,5,B004ITYDT8,"Before Sponge Bob Squarepants, the social commentary and play on words that are contained in the Rocky and Bullwinkle set the standard for comical sarcasm  of the government, fads, and insanity that existed.  The older I get (and I watched the original broadcasts)the more depth I find in Jay Ward's creation.  Rocky and Bullwinkle give sage wisdom that surpasses the ages.  The insights to the political system of the 1960's still apply for today. (Senator speaks in ""Goof Gas"" episode, ""I move that we spend a million dollars to see why we spend so much money!""
[sound familiar?]) This is why the episodes stand the test of time.  People are crazy in any era.
Personally, I was going through a rough time in the 1960's, as my parents were seperated and going to get a divorce. (Not so common in the 1960's)  As a child I found solice in Bullwinkle's optomism and never give up attitude.  Here was a ""person"", not too bright, not too aware, knocked about by circumstances, and he still kept trying to do the right thing and live life to the fullest. I found a calming peace from Rocky's loyality and, yes, love for his friend, Bullwinkle.  In today's society, Rocky would consider Bullwinkle a drag on his career, a social outcast, but Rocky stuck by his pal.
If parents want good roll models for their children, to instill loyality, love, duty, they could not find better examples than Rocky and Bullwinkle.",1300665600,63,1409,4.699186991869919
4388405,5,B004ITYDT8,"This is the first Amazon review for this product, which at this writing has not been released. All I have to offer is a shameless copy/paste listing of Rocky and Bullwinkle stories that were broadcast during the fifth season of the series, courtesy of toontracker.com. I plan to purchase this collection and might offer more information at that time.

4388421,5,B004ITYDT8,"It is a bitter-sweet day for pun lovers everywhere.  Season 5 of Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends has finally come out on DVD.  Since I got season 1 years ago, I've been waiting for a long time.  However, this also is the final season of the show filled with more groan worthy puns than you can even begin to count.  (And I'm an accountant, so I should know.)

As always, each of the 33 episodes included in this set features multiple features.  But the opening and closing segments are always devoted to Rocky the Flying Squirrel and Bullwinkle the Moose.  These two friends always find themselves in deadly situations no matter what they set out to do, usually at the hands of Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale.  On these discs you'll find the following stories:

Bumbling Brothers Circus - Boris has trained a lion to kill Bullwinkle on command, only Bullwinkle seems to have a knack for lion taming by playing - the comb?
Mucho Loma-Much Mud - Rocky and Bullwinkle must stop the masked bandit Zero or face 99 years in a Mexican jail.  (Boris and Natasha don't factor into this story).
Pottsylvania Creeper - Boris gives a desperate Bullwinkle a seed to enter in a flower show.  Unfortunately, the plant seems to like to eat people.  (Shades of Little Shop of Horrors anyone?)
Moosylvania - Bullwinkle gains trouble when he enters Boris' contest, ""I like evil because.""  Of course, Bullwinkle thought it was ""I like weevils because.""
Ruby Yacht - Bullwinkle's toy boat is actually a good luck piece from a Middle Eastern country, and they will stop at nothing to get it back.  (Again, Boris and Natasha sit this one out.)
Bull's Testimonial Dinner - Bullwinkle is going to be recognized at a formal dinner, so he tries to get his shirt cleaned in time - by sending it to China to the laundry that Boris is trying to use to smuggle a bomb out of the country.
The Weather Lady - Rocky and Bullwinkle's home town finally gets a reliable way to predict the weather - a fortune telling machine that plays four of a kind.  Naturally, Boris thinks this is a great way to make money and steals it to use in poker games.
Louse on Ninety-Second Street - Bullwinkle becomes the only living person who can testify against a mobster who just happens to be Boris' hero.
Wossamotta U - Bullwinkle's arm wins him a football scholarship to college.  Things are going well until Boris decides to fix something - a game.
Moosylvania Saved - Boris sets out to replenish the Pottsylvania treasury by sinking Moosylvania.

Since Boris and Natasha are obvious soviet spies, some of the references are a bit dated.  However, the puns are still funny, and that's what I love about this series.  They manage to turn just about anything into a pun, and every cliffhanger gives us two great puns based on what is happening.  If you're a punny person, you'll absolutely love it.

And I have to give a shout out to Wossamotta U, probably my favorite storyline of the entire series.  It's the earliest story I remember watching when I caught some rerun on TV.  But what I love about it is that is foresaw political correctness by introducing a secondary character who corrects anyone who refers to The Civil War as anything but The War Between the States.  Heck, you can't even talk about a civil discussion with him around.

The other segments in each episode are filled in with the usual suspects.  There's a Fractured Fairy Tale or Aesop and Son, Bullwinkle's Corner or Mr. Know-It-All, and Dudley Do-Right or Peabody's Improbable History.  Some of these segments seemed familiar to me, and I found confirmation on-line.  The only things new in season five of the show were the Rocky and Bullwinkle stories.  Everything else had aired in previous seasons.  While disappointing, at least the discs aren't missing new material.  Honestly, I didn't remember most of them, so I still got to laugh at the antics.

The animation is fitting for TV of the 50's and 60's.  It's enough to get the job done, but it's not outstanding by today's standards.  When I sit down to watch, it's not long before I am lost in the puns and not even noticing the animation quality.

All 33 episodes are here on 4 discs.  The final disc has some outtakes from the voice recording of ""Goof Gas Attack,"" one of the stories from the last season.  That's all you get in the way of extras, and its not that great.

But the episodes themselves are still fun all these years later.  If you love groaning at puns, you need to check out Rocky & Bullwinkle & Friends.  Season 5, just like any season of the show, will have you laughing before you know what hit you.",1432080000,3,4601,4.583843329253366

It's just as good as the others (which is to say, brilliant), but it's a bit poignant at the end.

4388437,5,B004ITYDT8,"It's been said that the 5th season of Rocky and Bullwinkle was on the air at inconvenient times, for both kids AND grownups, when it debuted in 1963 and '64, causing it to be cancelled. Even though this is their final season, we still have tons of witty, wacky, and punny humor here, like all the other seasons that preceded it, courtesy of Bill Scott and Jay Ward! There's a record-breaking 10 story arcs in this season, in 33 whole shows, 66 R&B segments, and 99 segments (all repeats, mind you) of Fractured Fairy Tales, Aesop and Son, Bullwinkle's Corner, Mr. Know-it-all, Peabody's Improbable History, and Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties, with and without bridging sequences; all restored and remastered, on a 4-disc set in a single DVD case, courtesy of ClassicMedia! But there's one major boo-boo in this set, that being the story arc Mucha Loma (Much Mud) is high-pitched via time compression, right down to the repeated segments between each episode, AND the show's theme and ending! Don't ask me how or why that's happened, if only this boo-boo could be fixed with a disc replacement program, for all who own this set OR the 100% Bull set, as my copies of seasons 1 to 3 of Digimon had noticeable glitches of their own (luckily none of that show's contents on DVD are time compressed, the glitches were mainly for recaps, end credits, freezing, or the picture and sound being off-kilter in a combined few episodes in those sets), but were never resolved when I sent Cinedigm e-mails about said bugs. Other than Mucho Loma (Much Mud) being messed up, the rest of season 5 is presented at normal-pitch-and-speed, including the famous Wossamatta U. story, and the final story Moosylvania Saved, where Rocky and Bullwinkle are marooned on Moosylvania and so much emergency supplies were sent to them that the island was sinking! When Rocky and Bullwinkle finally ended in the summer of 1964, so did the Looney Tunes' Golden Age for the big screen, with False Hare & Senorella and the Glass Huarache. That was also around the time Walt Disney's beloved live-action/animated classic Mary Poppins came to theatres, which would later be nominated for 13 Oscars, and won 5 of them! And afterward for Woody Woodpecker's Spook-a-Nanny (Halloween) Party (his only original short made for TV), and most of all, Rankin/Bass' #1 Christmas classic (in more ways than one); Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer! But I digress, the only bonus feature here is an almost-unedited outtake for season 4's Goof Gas Attack, called The Longest Laugh in History, where you'll hear what the actors went through, in a nutshell, to give us the Moose and Squirrel we know today! For unknown reasons, ClassicMedia never bothered to add the Puppet Bullwinkle bits from all the ""best of"" DVDs, into these season sets, aside from Rocky and Bullwinkle's first ""best of"" volume. Other than that, what a way to wrap up one of the greatest TV shows in history, especially on DVD, even without the original theme music for most of the segments in the show! If only ClassicMedia took better measures to make sure all 18 discs in the 100% Bull set weren't messed up, especially the double-sided ones for season 2 (and they have lately; putting them in plastic pages instead of cardboard sleeves)! Too bad it's now 2015 and the 5th season set STILL ain't below $15 here on Amazon! You won't be sorry with Rocky and Bullwinkle, in any and every season set, especially with your kids and elders! ""Well, I guess that about wraps up another Rocky show."" ""Certainly hope you enjoyed it; I did. Bye, I always say."" ""By George, he's right; it IS the end!""",1421971200,5,3610,4.796147672552167

But that is not a knock on the DVD release itself... I assume this is what was originally release.  All R&B are great.  Although I am curious as to why the Fourth Season is so short... only 19 episodes.

But this (5th) season contains a full 33 episodes.  If you like Rocky and Bullwinkle, this DVD set is worth getting.",1355270400,2,524,4.531914893617022

4388496,5,B004ITYDT8,"My two boys (ages 12 & 10) cannot stop speaking in puns!

Over the past year they have watched with their dad (age 47) every episode from all five seasons of Rocky & Bullwinkle.  (And in their dad's opinion they laugh at it as much or more than they do at Spongebob, which we also love.)

Overtly, the series is as silly as Monty Python.  Subversively, the shows are more educational than anything on PBS.

If only you could join us at the dinner table and hear my boys begin to unleash the puns and bad jokes after each meal.  You'd be able to see the gears turning in their heads by the looks on their faces, as they try their best to listen politely while coming up with another one of their own after another, after another, after another...

God bless Jay Ward, Bill Scott, June Foray, Paul Frees, William Conrad, Walter Tetley, Daws Butler, Hans Conried, Charles Ruggles, Edward Everett Horton, ""and a host of others"" for their playful devotion to making this treasure trove of cartoon wit and humor for generations of viewers to enjoy!",1309996800,6,1042,4.51063829787234

Puns, non sequiturs - you name it - it's all here, and done without the potty humor that seems so prevalent today. Thank goodness we are able to enjoy these episodes again today!",1303257600,2,365,4.462686567164179
4388502,5,B004ITYDT8,"The Spongebob of the 60s and pioneer of cartoon satire went out on a high note with these episodes in 1964. These last episodes of R&B retain the high quality of previous seasons, with wacky puns and outrageously inventive tales galore. Among other bits of Moosical Madness, we have the tale of Zero, who ends up working for the scoreboard for the (then) terrible New York Mets. Then there is the infamous RUBY YACHT OF OMAR KHYYAM (Literature loves will have a field day with this). Much political satire is to be found in the GOOF GAS tale.

And then...(trumpets please) There is the MOTHER of Moosism, WOSSOMATTA U. This is perhaps the most imaginative, pun filled, and utterly ridiculous episodes in cartoon history. You will laugh yourself SICK from this foolishness about a school so desperate for a winning football team that it fires its English dept. and hires the brainless Bullwinkle to play. This story has so many wild, insane, and outrageous twists and turns that you will not believe your eyes and ears! The lynch mob scene at the end (as is the case for the ending of the final MOOSYLVANIA episode-more on that in a minute) will get the politically correct Barneyfied New Zoo Revue Free to be You and Me tiptoe through the tulips crowd (who destroyed children's television in the 70s and 80s with their sickening pap) panties in a twist, but if you want Mr. Rogers, you're in the wrong neighborhood here!

The final episode, MOOSYLVANIA, for some reason stands out in my childhood memories, but watching this again nearly 4 decades later makes it even more foolish than I remember. Here, our heroes go to MOOSYLVANIA, perhaps the worst vacation spot on earth, in order to appreciate their existance in Frosbite Falls. This leads to some off the wall encounters with Boris, Natasha, and the Fearless Leader (what he does to Boris near the end of this grand finale is truly shocking, but I didn't find it offensive and most children have seen this kind of thing on teleivision before). However, Moose and Squirrell's final words to the camera indeed leaves an odd aftertaste, as does the final Dudley Do-Right. Also, the frog (who ""wants to be a people"") in one of the last Fractured Fairy tales bears an uncanny resemblance to Bullwinkle's Saturday morning successor HOPPITTY HOOPER, that would debut that fall.

Incidentally, nitpickers will note that the opening and closing themes are not those of the dancing Bullwinkle and exploding lightbulbs of 1964. Instead, we have the original 1959-60 openings with slightly altered theme music. Also altered in the opening parade scene is where Bullwinkle explains he is writing to their sponsor (then General Mills cereals, followed by a commercial of R&B touting the varying brands of kiddie breakfasts). This explains the obviously altered dialogue during the parade and the fade out (where the cereal commericals were cut) that resumes where Boris misleads them into the tunnel. A minor issue since the rest of this is so much FUN FUN FUN!

Okay, now if the Jay Ward menagerie would release the HOPPITY HOOPER series on DVD, I'd REALLY be a happy camper.",1303084800,,3118,4.855263157894737

There are 33 episodes of R&B plus all the side bit and other character-driven chapters. I checked the contents of the 5 Complete Seasons against the listings in two books about R&B, and I thank the distributor for finally releasing the final two seasons after making us wait 5 years between season 3's release and the release of the final two seasons.

Excellent quality of picture and sound. Nice little boxes. Not a lot of extras, but after the extras on the first two season sets, there wasn't much left to include on these.

Hoorah, Hokey Smokes and thanks so much for restoring the original order and availability of this unbeatable series!",1302912000,2,783,4.618705035971223
4388504,5,B004ITYDT8,"It had been decades since Disney (Buena Vista) released the gala Moose and Squirrel VHS tapes, to much hoopla and shabang. Then came the long-awaited fourth season from Classic Media and Vivendi Entertainment. When the box set of all five seasons appeared in 2011, viewers despaired that the fifth season might never make it out on its own. But despair not, gentle viewer, for here they are, all 33 episodes of the climactic final season of Moose and Squirrel, on four one-sided discs, somehow in one DVD case.

The packaging falls a bit short of the deluxe presentations of the other seasons, but then again, the fourth season only held 19 episodes on two discs. The only extra on the fifth season set is ""Goof Gas Attack"" audio outtake, AKA ""The longest laugh in history"", but keep in mind when we say episodes, we mean entire shows, including the various well-known bumpers, like ""Eenie Meenie Chilibeani, the spirits are about to speak!"" from Bullwinkle gazing at a crystal ball, with Rocky's reply, ""Are they friendly spirits?"" and Bullwinkle's retort, ""Friendly? Just listen!"" as an imaginative segue into a cereal ad, sometimes continuing the look of the series, as Cap'n Crunch ads were also designed by Jay Ward Studios.

Anyone unfamiliar with the series, which ran on Cartoon Network, as well as numerous other places in syndication, and was named third in TV Guide's ""Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time"" list, topped only by Bugs Bunny and Homer Simpson, in their 50th anniversary, 2002 issue, can have the great good luck of acquiring the box set. Those already collecting by season will be cheered to find this last season available separately.

""Rocky and His Friends"" first premiered on ABC in 1959. In 1961, it was retitled ""The Bullwinkle Show"" and ran on NBC until 1963. Following which it was a hot property, rebroadcast under various monikers and packages on ABC, NBC, and CBS (then the big three networks), and as cable came into play, on Nick and Cartoon Network. By the fifth season, the writers and animators had a corral of characters to work from. Each show opens and closes with an R and B ""cliff-hanger episode; an episode of either ""Dudley Do Right (of the Mounties)"" or ""Peabody and Sherman (and the WABAC machine)""; an episode of either ""Fractured Fairy Tales"" or ""Aesop and Son""; and Bullwinkle in either ""Bullwinkle's Corner"" or ""Mr. Know-It-All"".

4388505,4,B004ITYDT8,"It was a long time waiting for season 4 & 5, but now they are both finally out. There are 2 things I wanted to point out about season 5 in case you don't know about this set; the first one was mentioned in another review that the 3 entire episodes of Mucho Loma are time compressed. They are a minute shorter and you can tell everything is sped up. The other thing is that in this season only the Rocky & Bullwinkle episodes are new, everything else gets repeated. That's the way season 5 originally happened when shown. I take a star off for both of these things, but otherwise I'm happy to finally have this set. I've read reviews of the Complete set and have heard of awful packaging. Get the individual seasons. The first 3 seasons you can find pretty cheap.
