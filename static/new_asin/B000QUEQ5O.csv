2840326,5,B000QUEQ5O,"Yep, I am NOT afraid to admit I have always loved this show.

Silly, a cheesy story line.

But, it was funny.

Of course, the beginning of Hanks career.

More scenes & lines I remember.  Love Dot.

For then future TV references the makers of the show were the makers of ""Full House"".  You will note any ""Full House"" fans in the episode where Danny & Joey go back to college in a prank they are dress just like Tom & Peter wore.  Cue the wardrobe department, same dresses?  ""Not The Last Picture Show"" showing the cast in  the future.  They did that on ""Full House"" as well.

And, on the DVD, where is Billy Joel's ""My Life""?

I still remember scenes & can quote lines.  Episode one ""Macho Man"".

To me, just as funny today as when first aired.",1298592000,,743,4.207142857142857
2840327,3,B000QUEQ5O,"Been a fan of the show since its debut on television: It's witty and silly at times, but quite funny.

Unfortunately, this DVD release is a major disappointment: the opening theme has been changed for some inexplicable reason and some of the episodes have been edited... Why???

Didn't realize this until after my purchase... The Amazon description makes no mention of this, but the back of the DVD packaging does in fine print:

""Some music has been changed for this home entertainment version. Some episodes may be edited from their original network versions.""

Again, Why????

Needless to say, I'm going to email Paramount Home Entertainment and try to find out why they did this hatchet job on the show.",1279929600,4,707,4.907563025210084
2840328,4,B000QUEQ5O,"I absolutely loved this show when it originally aired in the 1980's and I have fond memories of it even still. But as is so often the case things aren't always as wonderful as we remember them. Watching the show now I do find it to be a bit dated, and even some episodes aren't as funny as I'd remembered them to be. With that said however the chemistry between Tom Hanks and Peter Scolari is timeless and still great fun to watch. They seem to have a limitless energy on screen and appear to be genuinely enjoying themselves. I will also say that despite the fact that season two is somewhat disjointed and the show seemed to be shifting direction from it's original premise, it is also the season that contains many of my favorite episodes. Worth mentioning is that like season one the original opening theme song by Billy Joel has been changed to something totally generic. Also, and again like season one, some episodes have scenes omitted that were shown in the original broadcasts. Admittedly though I only noticed this myself in one episode, where a sing along between Kip, Henry, and their two cellmates was omitted from a jail scene. When all is said and done I have great nostalgia for the show and I still enjoyed watching it. If only the powers that be had let the show go for more than two seasons and allowed them the time to develop and grow... who knows how great this little show might have eventually become?",1200268800,2,1426,4.5096525096525095
2840329,4,B000QUEQ5O,I enjoyed watching this show when in was on the air.  It was fun to revisit the show with all it's silliness. I found it as sweet and humorous as when I first saw it.,1198972800,,166,3.742857142857143
2840330,5,B000QUEQ5O,"What Bosom Buddies always wanted to be was somewhere between Dick van Dyke and Friends-- a show about people of a certain age and station in life, their friendships, their loves, and not really too much else.

For one season, the network didn't have the nerve to let it happen and the show stayed hung on the peg of its high concept. And then, to kick off the second season, TPTB tossed the whole concept out the window. The cross-dressing some-like-it-hot gag went out the window and the two leads went into the ad business.

If I had never seen the dresses again, I wouldn't have cared.  I was entertained to see people my age, going through the business of getting their young lives started, and there really wasn't much of that happening at the time on tv.

Yes, some episodes are kind of, well, dumb. And some were inspired fantasy-- if you were that age at that time, you got it. But what held the show together was a group of characters who really liked each other, anchored by the comedy team of Hanks and Scolari who, particularly when it came to physical gags, were a well-oiled machine.

Had the show stuck around, I think it could have morphed into something as fun and special and of its age and time as Friends would later become, but it was too late. It had changed so radically from its initial conception that only a handful of people ever uncovered this little gem. But in this second season you can see some great moments and the promise of what might have been. Not the greatest sitcom ever, but far better than its reputation and far more than a simple training ground for Tom Hanks.",1195862400,2,1604,4.460750853242321
2840331,4,B000QUEQ5O,"I don't really have any special thirst to review this product, but that being said, I do think I can come up with one or two points, now that I own this DVD.

This season of Bosum Buddies is a shambles. Things are going in all kinds of directions, plots are picked up and then lost, with little or no ramifications. Wether or not the people knew this was going to be the last season, I don't know. Tom Hanks character also goes from lovable to pretty much a complete tool at such a relentless pace, you wonder if the show was being written by two groups of writers who had no idea what the other group was up to.

For those of us who are used to the sit-coms of the nineties and naughties, a show that doesn't plan ahead for their characters might seem a bit unresponsible, but remember, shows are still being axed, leaving characters in perpetual limbo (Joey).

And just one more thing before the good news, this is very dated. Shows from the 60's and 70's kind of work now, because the 60's are always cool, and brown being the new black, again, 70's shows also work pretty well now.

80's shows tend to be pretty cheesy to watch now. The music just sounds so cheap and out of place, and the way people are dressed, not to mention their hairstyles? Puh-lease!

Now, the 4 stars. Tom Hanks, pretty much, he is the alfa and omega of this show, and why he succeeds to this day is easy to see. From Bosom Buddies to Alex uncle on Family Ties, Splash via Man With Red Shoes, to Big, A League of Their Own, even duds like Vanity of the Bonfires, this man delivers again and again and again. We just like him is all, and as long as he shows up and is Tom Hanks, it doesn't matter if he is tearing Joe Nazi a new one or talking to a volleyball.

The friendship is another thing about this show. It is like a warm hug, like Joey and Chandler, only in pastel colours and pumps.

Oh, and finally, there's Donna Dixon. Yum-ee!

So, do I think you should get this season two of Bosom Buddies?

For sure, it's tv and ultimatly Hollywood history this.",1192579200,2,2038,4.218508997429306

2840343,5,B000QUEQ5O,"Not a big fan of show just a casual one.  However, I bought it as gift for someone who was recording the reruns.  He loved it. It was obvious in this sit-com that Tom Hanks was going be a huge star.  Even Peter Scolari had moderate success.  Most of the other cast members did go on the other shows.

2840344,5,B000QUEQ5O,"This 1981-82 Season was when this sitcom about 2 roommates Kip(Tom Hanks, Henry(Peter Scolari) struggling to make ends up, living a double life by living in a ladies only apartment was cancelled after its 2-year run on ABC, due to weak ratings, but this show still takes me back to memory lane to when I watched it as a kid every Thursday night on ABC until it was cancelled in the Summer of 1982 when Ronald Reagan was president and we had all those budget cuts from the recession we had going on from 1981-1982, but it was brought back on the air temporarily to NBC in reruns on Saturday nights back in the Summer of 1984.

I also used to watch this show in reruns on ME-TV, TV Land, and USA too.",1421712000,,698,4.2481203007518795
2840345,5,B000QUEQ5O,"I liked watching this series when it was on tv. Now that I have this season on dvd, I have the complete series. I like watching Tom Hanks make a fool of himself on this show.

2840346,3,B000QUEQ5O,"Clearly I would never have made it as a Hollywood producer! When I first saw this show, I developed an instant crush on Peter Scolari and thought Holland Taylor was wonderful. For me, Mr. Hanks was always the capable tertium quid. Go figure. I still adore Ms. Taylor and am delighted that she finally got worthier material in TWO-AND-A-HALF-MEN and recently I enjoyed her turn on Broadway as Ann Richards. The show itself was never well-written. The plotting was so lame, in many episodes the actors actually seem to be struggling just to fill in the 20-minutes of air time. Also, the show's lessened impact on DVD also suggests that Billy Joel's now-replaced theme song probably drew in more viewers that the show itself. But it's still worthwhile watching Holland Taylor overcoming often mediocre material with such panache!",1377043200,,826,4.992753623188406

8197482,3,B000QUEQ5O,"The show gets five stars!  One of my favorite shows of the 1980's, and all-time, for that matter!  Tom Hanks got to show who he really was to become here.  His comic timing was impeccable, and his acting skills are truly showcased here.

The DVD though, gets three stars for a very typical reason - music rights.  This show didn't use a lot of original music, but when it did, it was nearly always essential to the plot.  This means some entire scenes have been edited out, which makes for a bit of confusion, especially for anyone who hasn't seen the original version.  So, for those particular episodes, we're getting the syndicated version, which I'm sure you know means a lot is missing and takes a lot away from these episodes.  Most of these instances they didn't actually use the music or the song, but the characters sang it themselves, and usually only a small portion of the song.  I think that an exception should be made for these instances, as far as music rights payments are concerned.  By that I mean, making the rights fees more reasonable, or allow for ""fair use"" in these instances.  On the other hand, I don't think the producers of this DVD even attempted to get the music rights.  They just cut the scenes out.  They even got rid of the original Billy Joel theme song, My Life, and replaced it with a simply horrid substitute song, which completely ruins the intro of the show.",1449187200,,1399,4.52589641434263
8197483,5,B000QUEQ5O,"I used to love this show. It's fun to watch Tom Hanks working his magic in his younger years and Peter Scolari playing his best buddy wearing women's clothing to stay in their women's only building. This series didn't last very long but both of these wonderful actors deserved most of the credit. I'm a woman and I understand how uncomfortable it is to wear pantyhose and heals..lol Somehow, these incredible actors were able to pull it off..lol",1445904000,,445,4.717948717948718
