3475029,5,B001AYWY7M,I really liked the way the video is set up in 10 minute segments. It has a variety to select from so you can mix and match depending on your mood. The directions are fairly easy to follow. I use this one several times a week and I am getting results from the exercises.,1234569600,,269,4.0
3475030,4,B001AYWY7M,"I love these 10 minute workout dvds, not only because of the short workouts, but the fact that I can customize the program that I want to do.  (I usually do 20 minutes in the morning).  With the exception of the Yoga abs section, I really like this dvd, especially the Ab and Waist definer workout (there were some moves there that I'd never done before and they were very effective - incorporation strength and pilates moves).  I also especially enjoyed the Bikini Belly workout - it's cardio combination is great!  And last but not least, I really dig the instructor.  Before purchasing these dvds I like to check out little video clips to see if I feel like I can be inspired by the instructor as well (there were some other dvds that I'd wanted to purchase from this series, but was turned off by some of the instructors' aura - I don't know why that was).  Anyway, this is now my second favorite worksout series (Yoga Zone being my first fav).",1234483200,4,948,4.4508670520231215
3475031,4,B001AYWY7M,"I already had another ""10 minute solutions"" video and loved it so I decided to try this one targeting the abs.  I can really feel it's working.  Some of the workouts are more intense than others.  You can start with something easy and then switch to other workouts for variety and progression.  I like that you can choose which 10 minute workouts you want and how many you want to do, so you're not stuck with 30 minutes of same ol' same ol'.  Instructor is motivational and effective.",1234396800,3,485,4.465909090909091
3475032,4,B001AYWY7M,JESSICA SMITH IS VERY GOOD INSTRUCTOR AND IT WORKS FOR THE ABS BUT I LOVE BIKINI BELLY WORK OUT. I LOST 4 INCH in 2 weeks.,1234051200,,122,3.730769230769231
3475033,5,B001AYWY7M,"This DVD has a nice selection of 5 different types of ab workouts.  They range in difficulty, so if you are more beginner or starting out, I would recommend the Yoga Abs, especially if you do yoga (this still my favorite ab routines on the DVD) and the Definer. Perhaps the Definer first if you have not done yoga, but you should try both to see how it goes for you. Working with this a few times a week is a definate help with toning up the abs. The instructor is great in the presentation of the material.",1232150400,4,507,4.173469387755102
3475034,5,B001AYWY7M,"I'm a beginner, and I really like this DVD.  The cardio section ""bikini belly"" is too advanced for me right now, but I really like ""crunch free abs"", ""ab & waist definer"", and ""sexy, sporty abs"".",1232150400,3,195,4.416666666666667
3475035,5,B001AYWY7M,"I must admit that part of the appeal of this DVD was the fact that I couldn't fathom what 50 minutes worth of ab exercises could look like.  I was pleasantly surprised.  There's a bit of everything in this workout--yoga, cardio, and of course, lots of ab exercises--plenty of variety to keep the workouts interesting.  This is my first DVD with Jessica Smith as instructor, but I like the way she explains things and encourages me through the workouts.  I'll try other videos by her in the future.  My favorite way to use this DVD is to supplement other workouts--a quick jog and one or two 10-minute routines or free weights and a few of the Tummy Toner routines.  I've been very pleased with the results.  This one is a new favorite!",1230163200,16,735,4.5227272727272725
3475036,4,B001AYWY7M,"So far this video tape is fantastic!  I may not physically see a difference yet, (I've only been doing it intermittenly for a few weeks), but when I did not do the tape for one whole week I felt as though I could feel a ""loosening"" of my abs.

Some of the exercises are very difficult, but they say ""no pain, no gain"". What I like very much about the video is that as hard as the exercises are...they are over quick enough that it makes it all bearable.  I would highly recommend this video, especially for the price!!",1226707200,3,518,4.212121212121212
3475037,5,B001AYWY7M,"I really love the new addition to the 10 Minute Solution series, Quick Tummy Toners.  Each section tones in different ways, which is great.  It ensures that you will never get bored.  There is a little bit of everything included to work every area of your tummy, even cardio which I think is great!  I could really feel and notice a difference after each workout.  The instructor, Jessica Smith, is very friendly and motivating without getting irritating.  This would be a great dvd to do all by itself or to add on a section or more to the beginning or end of a workout.",1220572800,29,571,4.4423076923076925
3475038,5,B001AYWY7M,"I already got my copy and have done this once through and really love it.  It is another great workout that like all the others, can be done in the shortest of time or in 50 minutes if you want.  I really love in particular, the standing rotational moves because they really work your obliques and doing these standing up makes a great change and makes you work a little harder to feel it.  There is even a 10 minute cardio segment to burn the fat that lies over your ab muscles and this is essential to shrinking your abs.
The instructor is Jessica Smith and she is motivating and cues quite well.  She gives you different ways and positions to try the exercises so you work at your own level.  She also goes through the usual pilates and crunch type moves, but overall there is heaps of variety to attack your stomach and help shrink it and burn off the fat around it.
Like the other 10 Minute dvd workouts, you can do these routines in any order and that is always a help to keep it feeling new and fresh.  I've done three segments already two days ago and I'm still feeling it a little today.  This is a new favourite of mine and after work this afternoon, I plan on doing it again.  I think that exercisers of any level will love this too and highly recommend it.",1219708800,13,1268,4.232365145228216
3475059,5,B001AYWY7M,"I was put off by the covers of these DVDs, but the actual workouts are very good. I find I can squeeze in 10 minute to do something and am occasionally motivated to do two routines (20 minutes).",1472428800,,194,4.131578947368421

3475061,4,B001AYWY7M,"This is one hard work out. I love this dvd. I wasn't able to do the bikini belly yet. It was just to hard on my out of shape body.

This has become one of my favorite 10 minute solutions.",1470700800,,187,3.675
3475062,5,B001AYWY7M,"Jessica Smith is my current favorite workout guru. Her instructions are clear and her form is excellent. I need to strengthen my core badly and these exercises are by no means easy, especially if you are just starting out or have been neglectful as I have been.  Thankfully, there are levels of difficulty with each exercise.

My only comment is I wish workout videos came with an explanation of proper form and its significance. Most of the workout DVDs I have purchased over the years do not adequately explain this and if you're just starting out it's important to be aware. Good form helps protect against injury and gives you optimal results.",1468540800,4,647,4.767857142857143

I purchased this expecting to like some routines more than others, but was surprised that I prefer the ones I thought I would dislike over others.  The yoga segment is definitely my favorite. Now the cardio routine is terrible. I mean, it's horrible to watch and I laugh so hard I can't really get through it... not that I could do better myself, but I just end up needing to skip this one.

This DVD is really not ""crunch-free"" per se because there are few crunches thrown in there, but the five 10-minute workouts all concentrate on the ab area with lots of twist and turns, which is very good for your oblique muscle.  I use this DVD, along with Suzanne Bowen's ""Blast Off Belly Fat"", to keep my midriff from becoming barrel shaped.  As with any exercise, the hardest part is getting started.

She gives excellent instruction, detailing the moves before you do them, not just jumping into something new and expecting you to follow blindly. I LOVE the ""yoga abs"", I do it almost every morning when I get up. Really stretches my stiff morning muscles out and wakes me up. This is my first go at yoga so I can't critique her on that. I just really like it, and love that it doesn't incorporate the spiritual stuff I've always thought yoga to be. The ""sporty abs"" is one of my favorites to really get my abs working. It is some of the same moves you've probably seen everywhere else, but also some different ones I haven't seen. All in all, very good video.",1370390400,,706,4.396946564885496

You will see some new moves which you might not have encountered before in any other workout video.

I wasn't crazy about the ""Yoga Abs"" section, but loved the rest of them. ""Bikini Belly"" was my favorite. I choose these when i am short of time, but like any other ""10 Minute Solution"" DVD, time flies fast and i find myself doing more than one segment at a time.

Crunch free abs- its the first workout session on the disc. This one went by fast. I didn't care for it because she would teach you move and the next minute had moved on to a harder version of the move, then on to a while different move.
Yoga abs- I hated this session. Unless you have experience with yoga you will probably hate it to. I have bad balance maybe thats why.
Bikini belly- this its super fast pace and tested my endurance limit. I loved it. I couldn't do it perfect but I felt like I accomplished something. Ill probably customize it to use this session last. I was super tired after it.
Abs & waist definer- this is a great warm up. Its not fast paced. most of the exercises were on your back.
Sexy, sporty abs- this is also a good session to start on. Its a med pace and I felt like I made progress.
So will I continue to use this work out dvd, yes. I'm not in love with it but it did have the sessions I liked. I liked the instructor she want irritating or overly perky. Ill probably try other ten minute solution work out dvds at some point.",1367366400,2,1291,3.9692307692307693
3475176,4,B001AYWY7M,"Jessica Smith does it again with another wonderful DVD. This has quickly become one of my favorite concentrated abs routines, because it is just so diverse.
The segments include:
Crunch free abs--a good basic introduction to proper ab ""engagement,"" that won't leave you sore so you can repeat it day after day
Yoga abs--I love this routine. Yoga is actually a great abdominal workout but often doesn't get enough credit for that. Smith takes you through some very basic poses, postures and flows that will leave you feeling balanced and rejuvenated.
Bikini belly--this is the ""cardio"" segment. It's not intense but it will get your heart pumping for sure, and it's good for getting a mild endorphin rush.
Ab & waist definer--this one focuses on the oblique muscles and your lower back. As I said this makes the workout very well-rounded and it truly targets every muscle in your abdominals.
Sexy, sporty abs--this one is your ""back to basic"" moves (with crunches, bicycles etc). A strong way to end the DVD.
Overall, every time I finish this DVD I really feel like I have accomplished what Smith talks about so often--creating a ""muscular girdle"" to hold in your abs like spanx but without the actual spanx! This is not the most intense ab routine out there but it is effective and I've already noticed significant improvements in flattening my stomach and making me feel more confident after going through it around 4 times.

3475199,5,B001AYWY7M,"This is the most innovative, original collection of ab exercises I've ever seen.  It's not just a Pilates rip off or a bunch of variations on crunches.  It's a great mix of standing and floor exercises, with Bikini Belly also providing a good ab/cardio workout.  Most of the exercises also engage other muscle groups for a better overall workout.

The only segment I couldn't do was the Yoga one; it uses Yoga positions that my bad knees and hip replacement can't handle.  If your knees and hips are healthy, it would also be good.

I can see myself wearing out this DVD. :-)",1358208000,2,575,4.533980582524272

3475204,5,B001AYWY7M,"I cannot say how great this DVD is - mostly because of the ""Bikini Belly"" workout.

I originally discovered bikini belly in a promotional DVD I found in a box of Special K. I used it so much the disk became damaged and I had to replace it...

I decided to replace it with the workout DVD it originally came in, as opposed to buying someone's secondhand Special K DVD.

I can't say how much I like this workout. It's fun and easy and quick and I actually SAW how it cinched in my waist. Other people noticed and remarked about how small my waist looked. Alone, it's probably not enough (I combine it with running and weight training), but it's a good supplement to my other workouts and helps with an area I have a hard time working on otherwise.

I dislike crunches and I don't really think they work all that well anyway. Bikini belly doesn't require any weights or other equipment, and you don't have to get on the floor or strain your neck!

Now, I just have to try the other workouts on the disk, but honestly it's worth it for that one alone.",1342742400,2,1047,4.267676767676767
3475205,5,B001AYWY7M,"I bought this video recently on Amazon.  My whole life I've been one of those women who has that awful ""apple"" shape""... where most of my weight falls in my middle, even when I'm at a healthy weight my belly is always bigger in proportion to the rest of my body.

Well, I decided that I was sick of having a big belly and bought this video as a beginner to abs exercises.  I liked this video from the beginning, because the excercises are simple enough to understand and get started right away, but its not so easy that you feel like you are not getting a good workout.  I did get my heart rate up and broke a sweat!  I felt like the bikini belly section of the video really works my abs.  I especially liked the  crunch free abs because I really don't like breaking my neck or injuring my back trying to work out my abs, and this video was great for that.  I loved the fact that the video was not complicated and overzealous, because I felt motivated to do come back and do it again and again.

The other thing I liked about the video is that you really can jump right in and it doesnt take a whole lot to catch on like some workout videos, where you have to keep rewinding to perfect a step and get it down right.  This video was energetic, simple, and effective.  I thought Jessica did a great job and I would recommend this for someone trying to get their abs into shape!

Lastly, I think there is only one portion of the video where I didn't really get as good of an ab workout, and that's in the YOGA ABS section, only because it felt more relaxing than workout.  But  it was still good, and if you really want to get a good YOGA AB workout, then I recommend 10 minute YOGA solutions (the all Yoga one) and you will get a really good yoga workout for your abs on that one, but overall, this video was great.

Good luck!",1326326400,2,1825,4.1303116147308785

3475227,5,B001AYWY7M,"This is my favorite ab workout dvd. The trainer is adorable and does a good job both explaining the moves and motivating you (without being *too* cheesy--I like she calls me a ""rock star""). All the workouts are excellent (my favorites are the waist definer and the bikini belly cardio session), and I love mixing them up on different days. There's a lot of variety in moves among the workouts, so it isn't boring, even after several weeks. I also love that a single workout is only 10 minutes, so there's no excuse not to do at least one every day.",1312588800,3,548,4.435643564356436

The ""Mommy Belly is decreasing in SIZE its AMAZING!!  The workouts are challenging & fun.  I customize my workout in the order that I think is hardest to easiest.  I start with Bikini Belly (awesome cardio to wake up those abs), Ab & Waist Definer, Sexy Sporty ABS, Crunch Free ABS and wind down with Yoga ABS which is very relaxing.

I liked the workouts in that there was quite a bit of variation to the moves but most of the workouts were simply too easy for me so I got somewhere between a minimal to negligible workout.

Don't get me wrong, I definitely got a decent workout, but a lot of the exercises were repetitive and just so-so.

I have yet to do all 5 segments consecutively because I'm not in that great shape.  I think when I reach my goal of doing the whole 50 minutes, I will really feel a great sense of accomplishment.

I do some part of this workout almost every day. The Bikini belly workout is a great cardio-ab exercise section. There is one small section that is a little rough on the knees but it is over rather quickly.

3475261,5,B001AYWY7M,Jessica is an amazing instructor- I love every one of her dvd's and I am very particular. I love that the workouts are broken down into 10 minute segments but the best part is that each 10 minute segment is fresh and new. You don't feel like you are doing the same old exercises over and over. I have a ton of exercise videos but hers are always refreshing- she seems to have such great strength in every area of fitness from kickboxing to yoga. This is my fav. ab dvd because even if you are tired and don't feel like working your abs that day the yoga ab section is great. I will always put this dvd in after my cardio and will typically do 2 segments. I always include the yoga abs last as it not only works your abs but it is calming and provides a nice ending to my fitness routine.,1247616000,2,787,4.083870967741936
3475262,5,B001AYWY7M,"This is the first 5 star review I've ever given to a workout DVD, but I loved this one.  Jessica is an excellent instructor, she talks enough to give instructions and be motivating without getting obnoxiously perky and over-the-top.  Also I thought all the sections are effective ab workouts, although differing intensities, and I often use them to replace ab sections on other 10 minute solution DVDs.

Section Breakdown:
Crunch-free abs: this first section is just what it claims to be, an ab workout with no crunches. It's a nice change from the usual crunch filled routines, however to make it effective you have to be consciously engaging your core muscles the whole time (unlike in a crunch where your core muscle have to engage to do the move at all) or else you're not really getting an ab workout, you're just moving.  It's nice because it takes strain out of your neck and back and it can be done multiple days in a row without straining the muscles.  I thought it was medium intensity.

Yoga Abs: this is probably the easiest workout on the DVD.  I enjoyed because she really makes you focus on how you hold your abs in different yoga poses.  Being someone who pratices some yoga I thought it added an interesting new dimension to what I'm doing with my abs rather than just letting them go.  However, I think this is an easy core workout and mostly use it as a stretching cooldown.

Bikini Belly: Here Jessica uses cardio to get an ab workout that I would say is moderately difficult.  It'll get your heartrate up (especially if you get into it) and the moves are not hard to follow and jessica cues well.  Here again you've got to think about engaging your core but if you do it right its a moderately difficult abs workout and a good cardio.

Ab & Waist Definer: This is a hard ab workout focusing on the obliques.  The idea is to workout on twisting and building a belt of muscles that will pull in your waist.  This is high intensity abs.

Sexy, sporty abs: This is another high intensity ab workout and probably my favorite on the DVD.  She focuses on strengthening the muscles in the abs to improve balance and athletic performance.

Overall, I loved this DVD and highly recommend it to everyone.",1247529600,50,2214,4.547979797979798
3475263,5,B001AYWY7M,"I like these ab workouts not only are they short but they are also effective. There are five different workouts each 10 min- one focus on Cardio that helps with Abs and it is pretty exhausting, and then another one focuses on yoga other than that the rest are basic ab moves but they all work great!",1246838400,,299,4.2631578947368425
3475264,4,B001AYWY7M,"I have to admit, I was a little concerned about purchasing this because I had loved Blast off Belly Fat with Suzanne Bowen so much and I was afraid it wouldn't measure up or would be too similiar, but not so!  This is a great video!  The only workout I don't like is ""Yoga Abs.""  I, personally, found it not so challenging.  I've really only dabbled in Yoga, though, so it may have some benefits I'm not really aware of.  As for the rest...

Crunch Free Abs- Don't be fooled by the title, just because there's no crunches, doesn't mean it's easy... on the contrary, it's quite difficult. Some twisting, turning, and variation on pilates moves.

Bikini Belly- I love this one!  It's a standing cardio segment, which helps to burn fat.  This is great because it's actually fun to do, and while it gets your heart rate up, you don't feel like your going to die.

Waist Definer- It's all about twisting here!  Some very innovative twisting and rotational moves that really help to pull your waist in.

Sexy Sporty Abs- some of your more basic crunch style moves and also some side plank raises.  Very good.

The whole video is a good combination and it's not just a bunch of moves you've already seen.  Jessica is pretty and perky.  I liked her, even though she seemed just a tad too enthusiastic at times.  You can tell she knows her stuff.

Oh, and I always try to include this:  you don't need any equipment or even much space to do this workout.  A mat would be preferable, but really not necessary as long as you have carpeting.  Enjoy!",1239494400,107,1537,4.437275985663082

3475266,5,B001AYWY7M,This is one of my favorite exercise DVDs. I bought it right after Christmas and do some of the segments every day or every other day and can really tell a difference.
