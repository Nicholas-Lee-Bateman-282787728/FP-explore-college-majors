933182,1,6304810830,"To continue the same thread, this movie was edited to the point where it can be viewed on Late Night Cable.  Please try to obtain a copy of the True-NR version - Athena would make the search worth it.  I saw the unedited version on Cinemax or The Movie Channel, one of them, anyway, my lady and I really enjoyed imitating the scenes.  Fantastic.",998092800,11,345,4.359375

7878094,5,6304810830,"I remember seeing this movie on HBO. Athena Massey plays a tomboy type of police woman. When some prostitutes at Madame V's start turning up dead,Athena goes in undercover(hence the title). While undercover she starts to fall into their world with sexy results. FIrst...,we all know what type of movie this is. A erotic thriller. The question is,does it deliver? I think it does.

Most of these movies have idiotic plots and boring dialogue,but this one doesn't. Athena is smoking hot and isn't afraid to show off her body. The sex scenes are erotic,but not over the top. There's been comments that customers have ordered the unrated version and haven't gotten it,or that they can't play it on an american dvd system. I'll answer both those questions as best as I can.

First one. There is an unrated dvd version of this movie. It is sold by DaaVeeDee. This IS the unrated version that I saw on HBO. If you're ordering it from somewhere else,then it may be the one that's been heavily cut up. Second question. When I ordered this dvd,it said that it's a pal region and won't play in american dvd players. I have a 3d blu rap player and it played fine. I'm not too cray about the letterbox format,but it's worth it to see Athena in all her glory!

If you're haing problems viewing it you can watch it on your pc,just change the disc format. You can google it and it'll tell you how,or you can buy a pal dvd player. You can get a good one for under fifty dollars. You also may be able to play it if you have the old ps2 game system. Another option would be to buy the vhs version,but I'm not sure if that one's been edited to? Bottom line. Great movie for this type of genre. If you're looking for Athena's best film in which she's naked,Undercover Heat is it. She has at least six nude scenes,one is a threesome with a man and his wife. Plus the supporting cast is pretty good too. Meg Foster,from They Live and a young Jeffery Dean Morgan,from Watchmen. Hope this helps",1399766400,,1969,4.433701657458563
7878095,2,6304810830,"Amazon advertised the film at 93 minutes - that is the original running time and what I expected.
The copy sent was 82 minutes (written on disk). This is what the producer is sending to your suppliers.
They had no knowledge of the difference until I questioned them.  After the first order came an I noted the difference I ordered from another of your service with a different supplier and the same thing occurred. I returned the second one keeping the first as the best that can be done unless I go to a VHS copy - which they can't seem to find.",1373328000,,546,4.300970873786408
7878096,5,6304810830,This is a great movie! I seen it back the day. Its an adult movie with nudity scenes. The guys are smokin hot! And Athena is a freak! She played that role really good!!  This messege is for Tim from Ventura. I read your review from the movie undercover it was very interesting. Im thinking about buying the movie and buying it from the same vendor that you the movie. But Im alittle undecided because I don't if the movie will play on my magnovox dvd /vcr player. I looked in the back of my dvd/vcr player and didn't see the Pal /region:0 that you mention on the review. I have a laptop with a cd rom. i was thinking of buying the movie to watch it on my computer.  Write me back and please give some feedback.,1354752000,,710,4.13768115942029
7878097,4,6304810830,"I just received this DVD in the mail.  I thought it was coming from the UK because the seller information from DaaVeeDee says ""Brand new official United Kingdom DVD edition of this film. This is a PAL/Region 0 DVD WHICH WILL NOT PLAY ON STANDARD US DVD.""  The DVD shipped from DaaVeeDee LLC in Voorhees, New Jersey.  It is the unrated version that I saw in high school back in 1997.  The DVD jacket says that it is PAL, but it works fine in my Dynex Blu Ray player (even though the instructions for my Blu Ray player say that it can play NTSC only).  It is a Region 0 DVD so as long as a player can play PAL (which most modern American DVD and Blu Ray players are able to play, the video will work fine.  The only negative thing that I have to say about this DVD is that it is in letterbox instead of widescreen.

A viewer under the name Bruce M. Causey Jr who left a one star comment said that the DVD would not work on his DVD player.  I don't know from which seller he purchased this DVD so it could be due to two possible problems: he has an older DVD player which will not play PAL or he purchased it from a different seller than I did and it is coded for Region 2.  If this video were coded in Region 2, I would suggest ripping the DVD to a computer hard drive using DVD Shrink 3.2 and burning the video to a blank DVD with ImgBurn (both of which are free programs).",1334620800,3,1372,4.014705882352941
7878098,4,6304810830,"The movie itself is bad, but Athena is hot and pretty much naked for most of it.
The threesome scene is epic and well worth the price of admission.",1280275200,6,147,4.103448275862069
7878099,1,6304810830,I received this from England.  I could not use it in an American DVD player.  I think it is inexcusable to sell something which is useless.,1259280000,5,139,4.3076923076923075
7878100,5,6304810830,"This comments refer to the VHS, unrated copy, not to this DVD. There is no unrated DVD for this movie, as far as I know.

If I wanted to watch something steamy, I would favor soft-core or erotic movies. Hard-core pornography is so idiotic that one either falls asleep or may risk dying of boredom. Dialogue is reduced to moaning on the part of male actors and the immortal line ""oh yeah"" on the female side. (Yawn.)

""Undercover"" is a real gem of a movie, provided you watch the Unrated version. The sanitized copy is worthless. I will never understand those people who go out of their way to protect me and my immortal soul so I will not end up in Hell for eternity, or some such nonsense. Thanks anyway, but please, let me make up my own mind and decide if I want, should, or could watch one thing or another. And, please shut the door without slamming it on your way out.

""Undercover"" portrays Athena Massey as a police woman who visits a bordello, disguised as a prostitute, in order to find a killer. It is a monument to devotion to a worthy cause and that is great, especially because she is very generous showing her beauty. Acting is good, plot is great, cinematography and direction are superb. Director Gregory Hippolyte handles his craft in a flawless way.

If you want to know what was cut off the unrated version, for starters, a three-way scene was completely deleted. I watched the movie twice on the satellite, the first time Unrated and then the version approved for children and toddlers and was appalled. Immediately I ordered the unrated copy on VHS and was happy ever after. So much for the results of censorship by well-intentioned a-holes. Other scenes were trimmed as well and everything was a mess.

This DVD, which I have not watched, is 93 minutes long. The Unrated version is 93 mintes long. So, who is lying to you, the lecherous consumer? You figure. Do not fall for the R-rating, because it will show a censored movie.",1102896000,31,1950,4.544159544159545
