8406649,5,B003VC6F6M,"If you buy this, remember that it's a DVD, not a CD. It's mostly footage of the band playing with acoustic instruments (unplugged). There is also footage of the band during the ""warm up"" rehearsal time. Interesting to watch. Even more interesting when it is narrated by Rick Wakeman. A magnificent musician with a unique sense of humor. Very funny man. It's a lot of fun to watch.",1337731200,,380,4.602941176470588
