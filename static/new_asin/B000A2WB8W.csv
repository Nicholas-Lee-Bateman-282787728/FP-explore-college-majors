8073181,5,B000A2WB8W,"I first saw this gem on commercial TV years ago  and was immediately captivated. I later found  it in a 3 DVD set titled INVITATION TO MURDER (long gone) and purchased it. As the video quality was a bit wanting, I ordered this one in the hope that there would be an improvement. There is. It's not perfect (it could be a bit more sharp)  but decent enough, especially considering that it's from an old TV movie.
This is a truly excellent  and brilliantly conceived  mystery. Comparisons to Colombo by other reviewers are ludicrous and sadly uninformed. Colombo was fine but this is an entirely different animal worthy of comparison to Agatha Christie. If she'd been listed as the author I think few people would know the difference. Further, I suspect that only the most capable mystery writers or buffs will be able to figure out who the culprit is. It's a real twister and a most refreshing delight. Add Robert Preston who was one of our greatest actors supported by an excellent cast and you have a film that should be far better known. DO NOT take seriously the poor boobs who panned this film. They wouldn't know a high quality creation if they ate it for lunch. it's for them that the old saw about TV being a vast wasteland or brain shrinker applies. There is great stuff out there for those capable of appreciating it  and who know where to find it. Miss this one at your own peril.",1487635200,,1390,4.496031746031746

8073183,5,B000A2WB8W,"Great classic TV movie from 80's that they can't and won't make anymore! Great writing and acting too! Stars Preston, Redgrave, McGee
and a young Jeff Goldblum all give great performances. The movie is written much like a Columbo episode. If you like the old mystery shows
and TV movies you will enjoy this one.",1437955200,,311,4.672727272727273
