She's especially good at showing you how to help your body heal itself and makie it stronger so that it's less prone to muscle and tendon injuries. The importance she places on helping to keep posture in correct placement through stretching all the involved muscles is key to it all. Many years at a sedentary occupation (software engineer) caused lots of back and joint pain for me that seemed to worsen over the years. My daughter introduced me to some of the Esmonde programs she had recorded from PBS, and, voila!!! ... The hip, foot and back pain went away!! All I can say is, Wow!!  And I didn't even have to lower my old carcass down onto the floor! Buy this DVD!",1411516800,3,709,4.496124031007752
8370247,5,B002HEEU8U,There is only a few things that really work. I fell down 13 steeps when I was younger and injured my back. Even though it has been many years I still have trouble with most exercise videos.  This is the only video that really works you out and doesn't get you injured. Because of her training and knowledge this teacher was able to bring me to a place where I could dance again. I now have the strength and ability to  do most normal activities with out back pain. It was worth the money and it is worth your time. Remember the workout is for you and your future.  We all want good quality of life and quantity.,1393459200,5,611,4.161016949152542
8370248,5,B002HEEU8U,These exercises are great to start a new program of stretching for posture and flexibility.  Esmonde is easy to follow and her explanations keep you confident about what they are supposed to do.,1283817600,8,194,4.878787878787879
