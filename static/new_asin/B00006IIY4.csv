7969415,5,B00006IIY4,Billy Connolly has always been one of my favorite comic story tellers which is much more than just a comedian. His insights and stories are stunning and with his travelling to parts of Britain and telling the stories of its history as well this was another surprise in just why Billy is the best.,1479600000,,296,4.5
7969416,5,B00006IIY4,"It was fantastic to see the places he visited. His commentary is right on-spot. These DVDs include highlights of his shows, which I enjoyed, also. However, his humor is raunchy--not for family viewing with young children.",1464048000,,221,5.166666666666667

After a break of 6 years Billy Connolly brings his hugely popular World Tour series back to the British Isles. Filmed during his 2001 tour this is a personal travelogue taking in the people, places and history of England, Ireland & Wales interwoven with live footage from his sell-out shows.

Starting in Dublin and ending in Plymouth, with his custom built trike in tow, Billy's journey takes in a Shakespearean playhouse in London and follies in Wales, his Irish ancestors and farting dead people, he even comes across fairies in Belfast and angels in Tyneside. Billy's original views, love of the places he visits and humour shine through to leave you with a totally unique view of England, Ireland and Wales.

This boxset contains all eight episodes of the BBC series Bily Connolly's World Tour of England, Ireland & Wales.

DVD bonus features - audio only.
Contains seven songs from the series performed by Cara Dillon, Ralph McTell, Tommy Sands and Billy Connolly.",1291334400,,1006,4.8654970760233915
