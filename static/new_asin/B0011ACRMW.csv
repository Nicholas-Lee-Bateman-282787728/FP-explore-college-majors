8241210,1,B0011ACRMW,"I got this DVD and thought I give it a try. It is not only extremely basic information but horribly created. The author talks as if you are in slow slow slowwwwwwwwww motion. takes forever to say a phrase. could not even finish it.
I understand this might have been done to address customers who have no or little knowledge of ebay, but the slow motion in which is done, goes to a level of customers who can not comprehend even basic english language. Would not view it even for free. Terrible tutorial.",1327104000,,503,4.419354838709677

Eventually the tape provides the ebay information listed, again in a very complete way.
