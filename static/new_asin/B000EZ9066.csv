2547067,5,B000EZ9066,"Not being an ""action"" movie buff, I was somewhat surprised that I was hooked on this film.  Everything about it was superb.  Well acted, very well directed and kept my interest right up to the final credits.  The description of this film as a gay ""Bonnie and Clyde"" was apt, although I still look forward to the day when we don't have to use ""gay"" to describe a film as anything other than what it is, a great film.",1156291200,11,415,4.227848101265823
2547068,5,B000EZ9066,"This is an excellent movie!  It has nothing to do with being gay... like sometimes it is classified as!  It is simply a very strong story about the Nazi regime and how it tried to brain wash young men to be simply killers of anyone that was not perfect in looks and that wasn't from the German race.  But it shows through a pure friendship of 2 young men that they stood for what was right although some of them had to loose their lives... in the end the main character knew what he did was right!  It is a very very touching story!  Once again... sometimes people want to think that just because 2 young men are close, that they are gay, that is not the case in this story, so just because Amazon classifies it with the gay section, it is not homosexually oriented at all!  Great moving, touching film!  It is worth the money to buy!",1155254400,7,834,4.2075471698113205
2547069,5,B000EZ9066,"This movie is the real deal! Fine story telling, convincing plot, excellent cinematography. In short, a film that would do well in a movie theatre as well as home entertainment.

2547070,5,B000EZ9066,"I so ENJOYED this movie. The acting was superb, and the direction was crisp and sharp. The film-makers and actors had consulted with people and experts who had actually lived during the that ravenous Nazi era for authenticity and correctness of dress, speech, and the attitudes that prevailed.

I thought I would be bored with the boxing sequences, but they were great; the friendship between the two leading actors was very strong and very poignant; the micro single-mindness of the Nazi regime of Napola certainly expressed the macro megalomanical mind of the German government at that time.

I suggest that anyone who sees this movie also looks at the making of this movie to see how thorough the director and staff were to make this movie come alive. I was more impressed than I can convey.",1153872000,14,794,4.830882352941177
2547071,5,B000EZ9066,"I found Before the Fall, to be an outstanding, beautifully filmed story of what happened to young boys and teens under Nazi Germany, when they were chosen for the special schools. Even though the film is sub-titled, you forget about that soon after the film opens. It is told in sensitive tones with dramatic edge.  Highly recommend the film as a historical period piece. The actors did their job well.",1152835200,4,402,4.742857142857143
2547072,5,B000EZ9066,"In the German-made ""Before The Fall (NaPolA)"" (2004), set in 1942, Friedrich Weimer is a young man of lower working class parents whose boxing ability catches the eye of a visiting officer from a NaPolA, a training academy for elite Hitler youth. Defying his father to accept the invitation to attend the NaPolA, Friedrich learns to supress any hint of pity or humanity in his boxing, which is encouraged to an extreme degree in the competition against similar insitutions, in line with the Aryan supremacy propoganda that is part of his daily education. He does make one close friend, Albrecht, a somewhat bookish classmate who happens to be the son of the local military government official. Albrecht has already become somewhat disenchanted with the ""win at all costs"" mindset at the school, obviously designed to turn them into unquestioning fighters for the accelerating war. At first, Friedrich questions his friend's seeming disloyalty, but, after an incident in which the class is brought out into the forest to help capture (and shoot)a group of young and unarmed escaped POWs, he also rebels against the prevailing Nazi mindset, in two especially stunning scenes in the final half hour of the film.

In German with English subtitles, very easy to follow. Winner of several awards for photography, direction and acting (the handsome and very talented Max Riemelt, who played the physically and emotionally demanding role of Friedrich), the film has no real gay content (I didn't notice any ""gay vibes"" in Friedrich and Albrecht's friendship, but it is being marketed as gay interest in the US), although lots of eye candy and significant homoerotic imagery. The acting, photography, direction, and musical score are all excellent, as are even the DVD extras (A lengthy and informative ""Making of"" featurette, interviews in English with the director and star Riemelt during the film's US premiere in NYC, deleted scenes, a toryboard/film comparison and two trailers.) Contrary to some negative reviews, calling it ""the Nazi 'Dead Poet Society'"", I really thought it was an exceptional effort (which I award five stars out of five), and especially a must-see for those interested in that infamous period in history.

2547073,4,B000EZ9066,"BEFORE THE FALL ('NAPOLA') is a brilliantly made film that addresses the blind hopes of youth in becoming a success as a man, a factor that allowed and allows dictators to entice young men into the realm of warriors under the guise of applauded  bravery and the golden promise of achieving glory for a great cause. This story just happens to be about Hitler and his 40 Napola (training camps for the elite German youths in 1942) and the young boys and men who trained in these National Political societies. It could be found in many places and in many times...

Friedrich Weimer (handsome and talented young Max Riemelt) comes from the lower class in Germany (his father is aiming him toward factory work) and is a fine young boxer.  His talents are noted by some representatives from the Nazi party and he is asked to report for enrollment in a Napola, an important means of education and training that Friedrich sees as being his way to become something special, someone important.  His father is anti-Nazi and refuses to let Friedrich go, but Friedrich is determined and runs into the night to join the Napola.  Once there he is admitted, groomed as a boxer for the Napola, and introduced to the Hitler's youth movement.  His fellow classmates vary from the very wealthy to other fine Arian lads.  They are trained, observed, and brainwashed as to the glory of the Thousand Year Reich.  Problems begin to arise when Friedrich gets to know his fellow classmates: Siegfried (Martin Goeres) is a  bedwetter and is humiliated publicly for his problem; Albrecht (Tom Schilling) is a poet and writer whose father is one of the governors of the Napola and Albrecht is anti-war; other lads seem on the surface to be obedient yet most have hidden reservations about what they are doing.

Being 1942 some changes are occurring in the Nazi dream and the Senior class is sent out on a mission to fight the enemy. And one night Friedrich's class is called out of bed and sent into the woods to find Russian soldiers who are 'threatening' their security.  The boys open fire on the Russians only to find that they have killed a number of unarmed Russian boys.  This profoundly disturbs them all, but Albrecht in particular.  Friedrich continues to observe the manner in which he and the other boys are used and slowly his best friends find ways to martyr themselves and ultimately Friedrich does the same in his only way - by changing the way he approaches the Napola expectations of his boxing.

Max Riemelt as Friedrich is outstanding: not only does he have the solid extraordinary good looks but he also can act, satisfying every nuance of this challenging role. The remainder of the cast - both young boys and the adults running the Napola - are superb.  The cinematography is subtly beautiful, ranging from the tough interiors inside to the vistas of a Germany before it was destroyed by the not too distant fall.  Director Dennis Gansel, who co-wrote the script with Maggie Peren, is a young man (the featurette with the DVD has an enlightening conversation between Gansel and Riemelt) knows exactly how to capture both the wide-eyed innocence of youth and the slowly crumbled ideals of young men.  This is an outstanding film to see and experience. Its lessons are terrifying and intense. In German with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, June 06",1150243200,57,3339,4.767361111111111
2547074,2,B000EZ9066,"""Before the Fall"" is an extremely well-made film that suffers from a cliche-riddled and simple-minded script.  Boy goes to Nazi school.  Boy witnesses the evil of the Nazi system.  Boy fights against the Nazi system.  I've seen this movie before.  And so have you; it was called ""Dead Poets Society.""  The problem with movies like this is that they are predictable, relying on formulas to propel the story forward. Despite its beautiful cinematography and good acting, this movie falls over and never gains the strength to get back up.",1149638400,8,535,4.955056179775281
2547075,4,B000EZ9066,"It's a shame this film didn't get a wider release in the U.S. I saw it by chance on a rainy Sunday afternoon, and found it engrossing, intelligent, and thought-provoking.

""Before the Fall""'s strengths are not those of groundbreaking formal style or especially original narrative. Rather, the film uses a familiar device (people of different backgrounds coming together for a common purpose) in an unfamiliar context. Set in a prestigious academy for training the elite of what was to prove a very curtailed Nazi future, the film depicts the relationship between two young men - one working-class and one whose family is already a member of the Third Reich's ruling class - and their slow, unlikely discovery of a common resistance to fascism and its inhumane demands.

Unlike, for example, Volker Schloendorff's ""The Tin Drum,"" which portrays Nazism as a creeping cancer on civil society, ""Before the Fall"" puts the viewer in the interesting and compromised position of initially sympathizing with the fascist order - via the young boxer who sees the Napola school as his ticket to a more comfortable life.

Taking this a step farther, what's remarkable about ""Before the Fall"" is its general interrogation of masculinity and its discontents, a concern that, in the first half of the film, marginalizes the treatment of Nazism. From the get-go, this could easily be a film that simply addresses militarism and machismo regardless of specific historical context.

The film's predictability almost becomes a strength in this regard. The boys' growing realization of their tragic bond, despite their vast differences, has all the implacability and inevitability of a meteor. They, and you, can see it coming, but there's no way they can escape. Their newfound humanity prevents them from trying to rationalize or compromise with the vast evil that surrounds them. To the previous point, did pathological hypermasculinity beget Nazism, or vice versa?

""Before the Fall,"" along with ""Downfall,"" another excellent recent film about the Nazi era, together serve perhaps as evidence that German cinema seems to be moving toward a more nuanced depiction of the country's infamous past. This depiction acknowledges the horrors but, by fostering a certain kind of sympathy for its characters, also reminds us that the impulses toward genocide and fascism are unfortunately not limited to any particular people or historical epoch. ""Before the Fall""'s equation of a cult of (hyper) masculinity with state-sanctioned brutality should give all of us pause in a time when militarism seems to be on the rise.

Finally, I found it interesting that one critic remarked, disparagingly, that the general setup and character delineation resembled a recent American film, ""Annapolis,"" set in the U.S. Naval Academy. (Whether or not that film represents a critique of its setting I can't say.)

For those interested in the relationship between the aesthetics of Nazi cinema and those of Hollywood, I would recommend Eric Rentschler's ""Ministry of Illusion: Nazi Cinema and Its Afterlife"". For everyone else, this film is simply an absorbing and thoughtful entertainment.",1146960000,25,3148,5.296593186372745
2547076,5,B000EZ9066,"Escape from brutal control by any means whether strong or sensitive, young boys loose their innocence and trust but defy immoral German authorities.

2547077,4,B000EZ9066,"Short & Sweet: This is a very well done tale of two young men in Nazi Germany.  Despite coming from different social classes and having very different outlooks on life, they form an unexpected bond. As the story unfolds, the main character endures hardship, experiences tragedy and ultimately discovers truth.",1268870400,,309,5.18
2547078,4,B000EZ9066,"Although this kind of perspective on the suffering of Germans in the Third Reich could be considered questionable, I did enjoy this movie for its emotional intensity.  The film explores the brutal and atrocious nature of the Nazi regime almost exclusively from the viewpoint of Germans--in particular, two adolescent boys, Friedrich and Albrecht, who attended one Hitler's elite boys' schools--, and the victims of this dark time in German history do not come into view (Jewish people, Sinti and Roma, homosexuals, other ethnic minorities).  There is a brief but decisive sequence that shows the murdering of young Russian POWs.  What the film does attempt to portray--and, successfully, in my opinion--is the seductiveness of the Nazi's ideology of strength to young Germans, and the powerful effect that the illusion of being part of a greater community can have.  I also felt that the film showed convincingly at a number of moments how people can be coerced into acts of violence.  Certainly one of the core achievements of Gansel's movie is the subtlety with which it presents the development of the friendship between Friedrich and Albrecht, and the homo-erotic undertones can hardly be overlooked.  The performances of both lead actors, Max Riemelt and Tom Schilling, are outstanding, if not stunning.  The structural organization of the film around recurring boxing scenes is quite compelling, and cinematographically astute.  My reservation against this film is that it may allow for some questionable conclusions, namely that Germans were the victims of ""their"" regime just as much as everyone else involved, or that the lack of resistance among Germans against the vile regime is entirely understandable.  But the film kept my interest from the first until the very last minute, many sequences are quite gripping, and the visuals are extraordinarily well executed.  The film is provocative in a very unexpected way, and deserves more attention.",1244505600,,1955,5.318181818181818
2547079,5,B000EZ9066,"This movie is a very realistic portrayal of the Nazi machinery that showed no sympathy for anyone.  One scene demonstates this when the boys are all awaken to capture some ""Russians"" who supposedly escaped and killed guards in the process. The boys succeed in finding them and shooting them, but discover that these were only harmless children.  The school instructors are hard on these boys, and simply have no sympathy for what is perceived as weakness in them.  The acting is very convincing and well done.  It is by no means a gay movie.  There isn't even a hint of homosexuality between the two main characters.  They are only good friends who have come to trust each other, even while once spying on a woman who is getting undressed.  No nudity is featured in this film, at all.",1234828800,,784,4.63768115942029
2547080,4,B000EZ9066,"This is a revealing insider's take on life inside the Third Reich from a Hitler Youth / young adult perspective.

A dashing young boxer is recruited by a Reich official to fight on behalf of an elite boy's school.  The adventure of school life begins when the Governor's son is introduced as a newly arrived student.

The glorified Nazi exterior is contrast to a much more sinister reality that neither boy can accept. Inhibited love and frustrated compassion drive the film to its untidy conclusion.

Except for the bed-wetter who is forced to pull his pants down in the courtyard, this is not a homoerotic film, but instead, a testament to social engineering gone wrong.",1225584000,2,672,4.817391304347826
2547081,4,B000EZ9066,This is a great drama showing how the misleading enticements of the Hitler regime to the German youth to join their training camps doesn't work when the two lead youth reveal that they do indeed have hearts with compassion for each other and their fellow mankind.  It is very captivating and unpredictable with a very emotional ending.,1216598400,2,335,4.87719298245614
2547082,5,B000EZ9066,"I wouldn't call this a specifically gay-themed movie.  The relationship between the two main characters is definitely headed in a homoerotic direction but it was a strong friendship more than anything else. The plot ends in tragedy before the relationship can mature.  That they shared some highly emotional moments was mostly due to the experiences they shared in the NaPolA (National Political Academy).

Napola (Before the Fall) focuses on the indoctrination of young minds into the marshal, fascist cult of German nationalism.  So if you want a strictly gay movie then go see something else.  What was much more striking was the story of what German military academies used to be like.

None of my ancestors were in the Nazi schools but my grandfather, his brothers, and most of his ancestors were in some form of military academy during their childhoods and most were Prussian military officers or government officials.  Based on the stories that have been passed down through the generations in my family this movie seems fairly accurate. At the military academy my grandfather attended he was ""taught"" to swim by being thrown into a pool when he was 5 years old. He managed to get out of the water but the next boy who was thrown in drowned while the older students stood around and laughed. The older students once broke up a fight between two of the younger kids long enough to give them both loaded revolvers, then told them to continue the fight. One of them died.

One day when my grandfather was 9 he complained of pain in his abdomen.  He was punished for showing weakness and then told to go sweep and mop a flight of stairs.  When he collapsed and started vomiting he was kicked and struck.  Eventually he was taken to the doctor and it was discovered he had appendicitis.  Another time a soldier visiting the school pulled the pin on a grenade and tossed it into the yard where some of the students were playing.  They fought over it until it exploded.  The movie shows a somewhat similar scene.  This sort of sadistic, brutal environment is bad enough for kids but the movie tries to show how much worse it can get for the two of them who are gay, one of whom is also an anti-Nazi dissident.

In Germany, being a ""Man"" used to be something that needed to be continually proved. This mindset has been passed along through every generation of my family. Looking back, my upbringing was fairly psychotic. When my father would try to insult his sons he would say we weren't strong enough to be German and that we took after our American mother. If I ever experienced pain and made a noise I would be hit. If I made a noise when I was hit I would be hit over and over until I was silent. Almost every day in the freezing German winter I had to make a hole in the ice of the local farmer's duck pond and tread water for one minute. There is a similar scene in the movie.  My first 20 mile ""march"" in July with no water took place when I was six years old.  What was the point of all this? I had to learn to be a MAN! Why did I have to learn to be a man? Because I am German!  These old-school Germans are completely crazy!  If you don't believe me then watch this movie. Somewhere along the way I came to my senses and realized that all that macho crap was pointless.  That was probably right around the time I realized I am gay, which is the most un-German thing that some one can ever be.

The eye candy alone is reason enough to watch this movie.  Max Riemelt is like a blond Jake Gyllenhaal, except that he has a much sexier smile!",1204934400,2,3547,4.423076923076923
2547083,5,B000EZ9066,"Why some consider this movie to be a gay movie is a total mystery to me.

Set in 1942 WW II Germany, we follow the story of two young men who come from totally different backgrounds, joining Hitler's ""Elite"" school the NAPOLA (Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalt).

After being discovered as a great boxing talent by a NAPOLA teacher, Friedrich who is 17 years old and coming from a lowly working class family, sees NAPOLA as the only way to better himself; even if it means to forge his father's signature and ""break"" with his family.

Then there is 16 years old Albrecht, who is the son of Gauleiter Stein and grew up in luxury. Unlike Friedrich, Albrecht has no desire to join the NAPOLA but is forced by his father to do so.

Friedrich, strong, with the ""aryan looks"" stands for the ""perfect"" young NAPOLA man. Much like most back than, he is blinded by promises and yearlong Nazi-Propaganda, willing to ""follow"".

On the other hand, lanky and sensible Albrecht has formed his own opinion and despises violence, the war, the NAPOLA and the whole ""system"" in which his father is one of the ""key players"".

Friedrich and Albrecht, although different in- and outside soon become friends. Each seeing something in the other.

As the story continues, Friedrich, associating with Albrecht slowly begins to have his doubts what the NAPOLA does and represents.

The story ends with a tragedy and a triumph; Albrecht taking a final stand against his disapproving, unloving father and Friedrich (because of Albrecht) being able to ""see the light""...

Everybody, who likes WW II related movies should watch this one. It's a time in a cold, difficult, frightening and wartorn 1942 Germany and two young men caught up in it...

The story was wonderful and touching. Outstanding performances by Max Riemelt (Friedrich) and especially Tom Schilling (Albrecht).

2547087,5,B000EZ9066,"The German title of this film is ""Napola"". Napola's were ""National Political Institutes of Education"", or Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten. They were community education sites that appeared when the National Socialists came into power in 1933. (Not 1942 as another review indicates.) They had very strict entrance exams. The blind and deaf need not apply, and racial purity was of prime concern. Indeed, when Friedrich (Max Riemelt) enrolled, measurements of his head were taken, his eyes were ""sized"", and his hair was color coded. When finished, he was declared ""Nordic Class One B"". One glance at Friedrich, and the first word that would pop into most people's mind, especially when watching a German film, is ""Aryan"".

He had received attention while boxing, and his prowess gains him an invitation to the ""community"" Napola, even though it is unusual for students his age to be accepted. I'm guessing that he is about seventeen; I don't recall the film specifically giving an age. His father strictly forbids him, as he does not want to be associated with the Nazi's. He wants Friedrich to become an apprentice and work in the factories. But Friedrich has grander plans for himself. Departing silently in the middle of the night, he leaves two notes behind for his parents. To his mother, he is apologetic. To his father, he tells him that he forged his father's signature, and that if his father tries to take him out of the school he will tell the Gestapo what his father said about the Napola's. His father doesn't take this well, and unleashes his anger on Friedrich's bicycle.

Arriving at the Napola, Friedrich is awed by its physical beauty - the school is housed in a gorgeous castle - and by how smart and purposeful he looks in his uniform. In the opening day speech, the headmaster states that everyone here is equal, regardless of where they came from. Farmer's son, whatever, it doesn't matter. He also says that when final victory is achieved, Germany will need Governors - not only for herself and Austria, but also for Washington, London, Moscow, and Cape Town. It's clear that they are grooming these boys not only to be soldiers, but also to be good little Nazi's. Friedrich's genuine smile and excitement is difficult to miss, and on such an innocent face it's difficult to see when looking back with the benefit of hindsight. One can't help but wonder how many students, like him, perfectly normal, became the Fuhrer's fools.

Instruction at the Napola is rigorous, both physically and academically, although when discussing evolution they don't so much discuss the theory of evolution as it pertains to science, but how it applies to Hitler's beliefs: the culling of the weak. Physically, they go through many of the same drills that we see our own Marines go through during training camp.

Friedrich meets a smaller boy, Albrecht (Tom Schilling), whom he immediately befriends. Throughout the film, Albrecht serves not only as Friedrich's conscience, but also as the film's moral center. Albrecht's father, Heinrich, is the Governor, and is firmly in Hitler's corner. Albrecht is his father's antithesis. Albrecht is an aesthete - and we are told at a memorial service for someone who committed suicide, but is hailed instead as a hero, that there is no room for aesthetes in Hitler's army - indeed, Friedrich is blunt force. We see the differences between Albrecht and Friedrich when Albrecht invites Friedrich to come home with him for his father's birthday. Friedrich impresses Heinrich as he has heard much about his boxing. In, perhaps, drunken stupidity, the Governor has the two boys box down in the cellar. Friedrich has no desire to hit his friend, but Albrecht must impress his father and mounts a rather ineffective offensive. When one or two of his punches land, Friedrich puts him down with two punches. Heinrich and his friends are proud of Friedrich and ignore Albrecht.

The entrance of Heinrich serves as the introduction of the harsh realities of Nazism and Hitler's regime. The school itself has so far been but a tool for Hitler, and the children, remote and removed, know only their studies, themselves, and their training. One night a group of Russian prisoner's escapes into the woods surrounding this Napola, and Heinrich comes to them asking for help. The prisoners, he says, are ""armed and dangerous"" (so to speak), and sends the students into the woods after them, for the students know the woods better than anyone.

In the woods, the boys become men, in an initiation most of us will never see; we can be thankful for that.

""Before the Fall"" works very well in everything that it does. The boxing scenes are good and the strong friendship between Albrecht and Friedrich is believable. They are very different people. Albrecht comes from privilege, and doesn't necessarily want it, and Friedrich looks at the Napola as something that can give him access to privilege that his poor family could not. They are drawn together, perhaps because Friedrich senses that he has something to learn from Albrecht.

Both Schilling and Riemelt put in excellent performances. It would be easy to portray Albrecht as simply weak, but Schilling makes us believe that Albrecht is a young man with strong convictions. Riemelt is helped with his Aryan good looks, but he proves to be a fine actor as well. In an emotional scene between the two friends, it's difficult to see that either are acting - although I would give the edge in performance to Schilling. His eyes resonated with intellect and emotion.",1176249600,28,5549,4.946351931330472

2547089,5,B000EZ9066,"No, this is not a gay movie.  Since I've watched it in English and German I cannot understand what is the controversy here.

The film is about two main themes in the National Socialist era--that Hitler promoted the idea that all German Volk were equal (see Europa, Europa for more on this theme amongst German male youth), but that some were more equal than others--those chosen to attend the National-Politische Erzeihungs-Anstalt (NAPOLA), schools to harden the will and spirit of the future Gauleiters (Dr. Joseph Goebbels was the Gauleiter of Berlin)--a form of political division of the anticipated future large German Reich.  As one states to the students in the castle school--who will be the future Gauleiters of Washington, D.C., of London?

In other words, there was a bit of Animal Farm in Germany.  The main theme--contrasting the lower class youth recruited from the boxing rings of Berlin in 1942, and the sensitive son of a local Gauleiter--is well done.  All of the films production values are right-on in all details, from the drill-sergeant to the recruiter, to the savage Gauleiter and the wife who tears up--quietly--upon hearing of the death of the sensitive son Albrecht.  Ironically, the German word for WEAK is often used to denote homosexual; but this was not the usage in 1942 when the Gauleiter mutters about his son, ""Er war schwach.""

2547090,5,B000EZ9066,"... i am sure i didn't read all the commends about this movie.. but alone the category amazon itself puts it in is so totally wrong it is unbelievable.... there is nothing.. nothing nothing gay about this movie!!!.. it shows how the nazis influenced the school education of teenage boys.. to be a thinking person was nothing.. to be a fighting one everything.. it just showed how an intelligent thinking boy aged 16 was declared ""to weak"" for the system.. only because he didn't believe in fighting and brutal unjust actions ordered by the higher ""leaders"".. where a maybe not quite so intelligent boy same age was first blinded by the ""glorious"" uniforms and the so called possiblities he was given just because he was good in boxing.. he found out the hard way what a brain washing institution he was in...

so people tell me.. what is gay about it..

and amazon.. ? did anyone of your people actually see the movie?

you did a total injustice to this movie to lable it gay.. as a gay tag...

(by the way .. check the german amazon page.. where this movie was put in the same category as for example ""sophie scholl"".. is that gay???

you must be kidding me...",1171756800,17,1161,4.5095238095238095
2547091,5,B000EZ9066,"This is a movie that grabs your attention from the start.  The production standards are high and an authentic atmoshpere reflecting the desperate situation facing the German war machine in 1944/5 is faithfully recreated.

The actors to a man are superb with all characters wholly fleshed out and believable. Several scenes stay burnt into your mind long after seeing this film while several scenes with the two main characters are extremely touching. The interaction between a boy coming from a priveledged German background, his father being an officer in the German army, and a working class boy, both being thrown together in a training camp for young new recruits is sensitively done. The tragic conclusion to this alliance further advances the depth of feeling and total emotion that is experienced when seeing this relationship move to its inevitable resolution. This movie earns five stars without question.",1171324800,7,914,5.2534246575342465
2547092,5,B000EZ9066,"Remember that saying, ""What if they gave a war and nobody came?""  It was around in popular culture back in the late '60s and early '70s when John Lennon was perhaps the best-known antiwar activist and the Vietnam conflict was looking increasingly like a lost cause at least among thinking people.  My best friend and I went to the local draft board and succeeded in being recognized as conscientious objectors.  Could I have done that without him?  I don't know.  Could we have done it if it was not somewhat fashionable?  Probably not.

I was reminded of that while watching this beautiful film.  How difficult would it have been to resist the Nazis as a young boy in 1942, when this film is set?  The protagonist, Friedrich, is a working class kid who now has his big chance to enter the elite of the Third Reich as a star boxer while attending an elite academy.  He's handsome, Aryan-looking, and athletic, but early in the film he shows another side.  That side is developed when he meets Albrecht, a slight, somewhat effeminate boy who is the son of a top Nazi official.

I read some other review where this film has been marketed as a ""gay"" movie. That's ridiculous.  Albrecht is not depicted as being gay; he is depicted as being smart and caring.  His stature and appearance simply serve to explain in part the contempt his father has for him as being weak.  He is a little weak in some ways, and that is part of why Friedrich protects him, or tries to.  But this film, like the best anti-Nazi movies, accurately shows who the really weak were--those who went along to get along or to get ahead.

There are a number of films in this genre that I like, including ""Europa, Europa"", ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"", and one that really needs to be re-issued on DVD (and I am not sure if it was ever on VHS) called ""Blood and Honor"".  But this one is easily in that class.

This film should be required viewing in high school classrooms. Some of us grew up with such weak anti-Nazi movies as ""The Sound of Music"", where the kinds of moral conflicts treated here were trivialized.  We don't see the death camps in this movie, but that is part of its power.  Albrecht sees just a glimpse of what he is in to and what his father is part of and there are several scenes showing that.

This is a fairly long film at 110 minutes.  If I were asked how it could be improved, I might suggest adding more.  There is not a dull moment.  A terrific film that you should not miss.",1169337600,9,2463,4.3841059602649
2547093,2,B000EZ9066,"This film is visually stunning and impressive, and has talented and credible actors.

Unfortunately, there is barely a story with a lot of poorly-developed characters who are ""trained""/brainwashed and instructed in the ways of death and inhumanity.

The settings and group ""sermons"" from Nazi officials are striking and convincing, but there is nothing that ties it all together.  Our hero fails to strike the ""killer blow"" and is stripped, literally and figuratively, of all status and walks away.  The end.

I'm forced to comment that this is marketed as a gay film, and I was surprised by how un-gay it was.  In fact, the two boy ""friends"" work together at one point to spy on a lady in a state of undress.  It's more about a childhood relationship in the midst of chaos than anything else.

I have issues with some of the pacing as well.  I found myself pressing the fast forward button several times, and didn't really seem to miss much.  Not a good sign.

So, for what it is, it's okay.  Certainly not a masterpiece, and certainly not something to run out and buy.",1168387200,4,1070,4.663101604278075

His susceptibility to Nazi teachings conflicts with what he really feels in his heart and these feelings are manifested in his friendship with Albrecht, the son of the local Nazi governor.  Sent on a mission to capture escaped(and unarmed) POWS, Friedrich must come to terms with those feelings that the Nazi ideology has taught him to supress.  One cannot watch this film without feeling the depth these two friends share with each other (and the viewing audience) the true power of true friendship during oppressive times.

One comes from privilege; his father is a German officer. The other comes from exceptional ability; he is a talented boxer. The training begins innocently enough; there is a rapturous scene when the boys learn hang gliding. Later there are scenes that test the morality of both of them. The film humanizes the boys; we see them as people rather than as enemies. The title has a meaning in two dimensions, regarding the fate of the boys and the fate of the Reich. The film is useful in enabling us to see human beings on the other side caught in moral dilemmas and realizing the evil into which they have been conscripted.",1393459200,3,773,4.649635036496351

8115935,5,B000EZ9066,"This is a superb film - wonderful performances from the whole cast, especially Max Riemelt and Tom Schilling. Script, direction, lighting, camera-work, editing, sound effects and music are great. It's a spellbinding film of extraordinary emotional power and haunting in its beauty.

One of the things this film shows is why Nazism was so attractive to many young Germans. The Nazis knew how to target young people and play on youthful idealism. They used this idealism as a cover for their murderous agenda. They not only coerced people; they seduced them. The Director, Dennis Gansell, shows this seduction at work. He also comes at the Nazis from new angles and provides valuable insights into the German mind. It's interesting to compare his film with a TV documentary series on Nazi education on YouTube. It's called 'Hitler's Children.' Episode 2 - Education - deals with Napolas. It contains archive film from the 1930s and '40s and interviews with former cadets. There's also an excellent book called '""Hitler's Children"" based on the TV series.

There are various DVD editions of Dennis Gansel's movie Napola - some with no features, others with interviews and documentaries. The American edition contains an excellent 40-minute documentary about the making of the movie, plus a quirky 8-minute feature, the best trailer and some deleted scenes. But the US DVD lacks interviews with the cast that appear in the German edition. Also the US movie is cut down from the original format and the picture quality is less good than the German version. Shadows are blocked up and colours less vibrant, although it looks reasonable on DVD. The German edition contains the 40-minute documentary, the most deleted scenes, interviews with the cast, and a director's commentary which I desperately want to understand. Unfortunately everything is in German. I speak only English! There are no subtitles. The German edition also lacks the 8-minute feature and the trailer that appear on the US version.

Could I make a plea to Dennis Gansel to issue a two-disc special edition (with subtitles in various languages) bringing together all the interviews, features, trailers etc that are scattered across the various editions, plus any material that has on appeared on TV. Also any other material he has about this remarkable film lurking in his archives. AND WE NEED THE MOVIE ON BLU-RAY PLEASE!

As a general point - many of Max Riemelt's films exist only in German editions. Few have subtitles. I think they would have a much wider audience if they did.

Incidentally, Max speaks good English. He has a delightful German accent, tinged with American sounds. He's made many films since Napola. Surely it's about time an American or British director discovered Max and put him in a movie. He could play a German character speaking in English. I'm sure he'd have a great impact.

UPDATE NOVEMBER 2011:- UPDATE

Since I wrote this review I've emailed the director of this film Dennis Gansel. I told him how much I enjoyed the movie and asked whether there was any chance of a proper Blu-ray edition with all the extras I've listed above? This is his reply:-

'Dear Roger, thank you very much! We are working on that! Hopefully the distributor wants to make this step, next year. Best! Dennis.'

So let's keep out fingers crossed something will happen in 2012!

UPDATE MAY 2014 ... Alas, the Blu-ray edition with all the trimmings never appeared! Let's hope it does some day.",1305417600,3,3462,4.984402079722703

8115937,5,B000EZ9066,"Germany, 1942. Friedrich has just graduated high school with no prospects but the factory where his father has worked his whole life. He is distinguished from all others his age only by his superior skills at the local boxing club.

As the film opens, he arrives at the club and discovers that the club director has arranged a match for him against the best boxer from a nearby ""Napola"", one of sixteen schools created by Hitler for educating tomorrow's elite in the Third Reich. His performance wins him an invitation to enroll in the Napola. Friedrich's father, a staunch anti-Nazi, forbids it; but, with the possibility of boxing in the next Olympics enticing him, Friedrich disobeys his father and enters the elite Nazi school anyway.

As the story progresses, it becomes clear that the purpose of such ""education"" is to suppress naturally emerging individuality and moral character so as to produce interchangeable parts in the amoral Nazi machine. As was true in ancient Sparta, boys are punished not for doing bad things but for getting caught doing them. Boys who cannot, or will not, but in any event do not surrender their sense of self and higher moral standards either leave the school or commit suicide. When his best friend elects the latter course, Friedrich is forced to decide if he will make himself a good Nazi like Hitler or a good man like his father.

I can't imagine why Amazon and YouTube classify this as a ""gay interest"" film. One thing that they confess is that they have never participated in a tightly-bonded, all-male group, such as a sports team or a military unit; and so they actually don't know that they, as men, never learn what men are really like except in such groups. For their benefit, I tell them from experience that, yes, in groups men really do love each other; but the more that is true, the less likely it is that they have sex. It seems to me really sad the number of boys who grow to manhood never discovering that expressing physical affection rarely has anything to do with sex.",1297036800,2,2029,4.693820224719101
8115938,5,B000EZ9066,"I've read most of the other reviews, and commented on many. Kids are kids, and they have their own agendae. If the parents don't agree, the kids will often go in their own direction. Maybe that's why some of our own kids are joining gangs. The minds of kids are resilient, open to suggestion. Some kids think it'll help if they go with the brain-washing element of a gang. This is not a new idea. The film, Before the Fall, tells of some such kids who are sure life will be better joining a ""gang"", but in this case, the gang is totally out of their control. In the case of this film, regarding Nazi Germany, the parents have little to do with it. Before the Fall is about all kinds of young people in a very controlled existence...the athlete, the poet, the bully...all of whom we've known in our own way.  It's quite universal. Dennis Ganzel's film is one that explores many facets of what it might've been like. Our hero, played to perfection by Max Riemelt, loves his family; the very special moment at the beginning with his little brother is priceless. He thinks he's better than that. He gets the chance and goes for it. He meets Albrecht, played by the excellent Tom Schilling, a sensitive guy, and a bond develops. Here's where ideas of sensibility and integrity develop, and it's a wonderful display. No gay thing at all, belying the DVD cover. I won't blab stuff away, but the NaPolA were the special schools where they developed (brain-washed) many of those fine young German kids, to turn them into Nazis. It's a very fine, disturbing film, winner of many Int'l awards. My strongest afterthought was that kids who are lured by the promise of friendship by gangs, or the promise of wealth by dealing drugs, are no different than these young dreamers, drawn to the promise of glory. Few of them survive. It's a fine film that should be seen by many...",1280188800,,1862,4.541666666666667

capable of doing, draws each of them in different directions as events take
place around the camp itself.  There are 2 main characters who have become friends; the plot surrounds their efforts to excel as young soldiers. There is some violence in parts and the film may not be suitable to those not wishing to
see boxing matches and military acts of execution.  It is about war and how
the youth were prepared to carry it out.  It is made in East Germany, I
believe, and very interesting from a cinematic point of view.  Excellent acting,
and a decent script make for a great little film -- one for the collectors.
