1787124,5,B00006RCMU,"I saw this version of one of Shakespeare's ""war of the sexes"" comedies when it was first broadcast on television in 1970. I was immediately won over to the idea that an intelligent director and ensemble could do a lot to make Shakespeare accessible to a new generation by simply setting his plays in a different era. The turn-of-the-century American setting worked perfectly. The women challenge male authority by sneaking a smoke, Dogberry and his entourage are portrayed as Keystone cops. The cast was excellent. Kathleen Widdoes and Sam Waterson were equally convincing in their gender battles, their self-righteous moments, and in their tender love scenes.
What struck me on my recent viewing was just how dark this comedy gets. Claudio is easily convinced of his fiancee's infidelity and publicly humiliates her and repudiates his vows. Although everything, and everyone, is reconciled in the end, we realize that the turf between true heroes and true villains is amply populated with fools, wimps, and cads.
Athough this is more of a filmed stage production than a movie version of the play, it is cleverly filmed and engaging. Personally, I prefer this version to Branaugh's filmed version (which I enjoyed immensely but felt it was less faithful to Shakespeare's text.) Unfortunately, there are no real DVD extras to this landmark production; but the performance is worth the purchase price.",1041033600,41,1399,5.167400881057269
1787125,5,B00006RCMU,"I first saw this version of Much Ado about Nothing in the '70's, and have remembered it ever since, so I was delighted when the Broadway Theatre Archive made it available again. The setting, the ""Rough Riders"" era of the turn of the century, somehow suits the material better than any other I've seen, in particular Dogberry and his inept Watchmen, who appear here as Keystone Kops. Sam Waterston and Kathleen Widdoes are both completely believable, and the supporting cast is excellent.
This version is for those who want to savor every moment of the play. As far as I could tell, it includes almost every word of Shakespeare's text, and to that are added quite a few sequences without dialogue, making the entire length of the production closer to three hours than to two. For this play, this is definitely to my taste, but may not be to everyone's.
The DVD includes nothing but the performance and scene selections (by acts only). Since this play was originally filmed for television, the visual and sound quality are not exceptional, although they're not actually bad.",1039392000,52,1072,4.831521739130435
1787165,4,B00006RCMU,"If it is Summer in New York, it is time for Shakespere in the Park and anual happening for well over 50 years. This production, moved to Broadway, and televised in 1973 is a gem. It has a young Sam Waterson as Benedict, and an otherwise delightful cast. It has a non-period setting (turn of the 20th century in the New York area, it seems) and why not? Funnny? Indeed! Strange as Shakespere can be? Of course. Dated? not at all. High production values: well, it is a staged production. So, go enjoy.",1378684800,,499,4.376344086021505
1787166,5,B00006RCMU,"Beautifully conceived and directed.  Waterston is delightful as Benedick, and Kathleen Widdoes is perfect as Beatrice.  There are moments of inspired interpretation---some very touching, others Wow!  The Keystone Cops interpretations of Dogberry and Verges are hilarious.",1377216000,,271,6.472222222222222
1787167,5,B00006RCMU,"I saw this play on Broadway in the 1970's as a teenager and was gripped, enchanted. I have seen productions of all the Shakespearean comedies and this is by far my favorite. The televised version is different but equally charming. The cast is in love with the language, they are clearly having the time of their lives, and the production is at once faithful to the text and the spirit of the original and marvelously inventive with everything else. One piece of advice: flick past the introduction by Joseph Papp before your first viewing and watch it later: that way you don't have to watch a preview of the ""best bits"" before you see the play itself.",1308096000,2,652,4.581196581196581
1787168,4,B00006RCMU,I purchased this along with three other DVDs for my grandaughter who has become interested in Shakespeare.  She loved them!,1295395200,,123,5.15

1787170,4,B00006RCMU,"Like Iago, Richard III, Edmund, and especially Aaron the Moor (from Titus Andronicus), Much Ado About Nothing's Don John seems to owe quite a bit to the ""character"" of Vice from the medieval Morality Plays. I mention this because I suspect it was the starting point for the decision to stage this particular production as a silent movie melodrama. Once one conceives of Don John as a mustache-twisting villain, it's only a small step to imagining Dogberry' watch as Keystone Cops and overlaying tinkling, silent movie piano fills during key moments in the play.

Where it works best is when the stakes are low, mostly during the first half of the action. Don John's villainy has yet to kick into high gear, and several of the set pieces emerge with imaginative bravura. The decision to transplant the eavesdropping scene in the orchard, for instance, to one in which Benedict hides in (and behind) a canoe works very well, especially when Balthasar's ragtime band swings out ""Sigh No More Ladies."" I would imagine this bit was even more effective on the actual stage.

However, to see the characters as melodrama ""types"" plays against the tone of the last half of the text, and this is where the production begins to seem a trifle one-note (to the detriment of the overall effect). Hero, for example, is even more two-dimensional than usual, so that the viewer (or at least this viewer) does not really care when she is spurned at the alter, partially because the conventions of melodrama dictate that all will be resolved in the end, and partially because I have no emotional connection to her. By contrast, if the characters are played more-or-less straight from the onset, there is greater pay-off in the end because the audience becomes more invested in them. This is a much bigger problem in the Hero/Claudio sub-plot because Sam Waterston and (especially) Kathleen Widdoes are very charming as Benedict and Beatrice, in effect, transcending the limitations of the contemporary up-date through the strength and complexity of their performances. These are the only two to emerge as real flesh-and-blood characters.

On the whole, I like this production a lot, but the old BBC television production remains (for me) the definitive performance captured on film. Why it was not included in the comedy box-set (along with Twelfth Night) defies explanation, since these two were among the few real triumphs in a very uneven series. Luckily, one can order them directly from Ambrose Video (at a very inflated price).",1267315200,,2514,4.980952380952381
1787171,5,B00006RCMU,"I saw this on Broadway in the early 1970's.  I remember it clearly as President Nixon was sitting about 8 rows in front of me (he had better seats!!).  I loved it then, I loved it when it was telecast a few years later,and I still love it.

Waterston and Widdoes are perfect.  Sort of Hepbrun and Tracy doing Shakespeare!",1242259200,,321,4.3
1787172,2,B00006RCMU,"This performance was a disappointment on many levels: vapidly hyperbolic, stale stereotyping in staging and acting. Performance/staging were wearisome and actors lines often garbled - felt uninspired, outdated, corny rather than spirited.",1215648000,,238,6.46875
1787173,5,B00006RCMU,"Young Claudio is smitten with sweet Hero, and with the help of his mentor Don Pedro he proposes. But Don Pedro's glowering brother Don John schemes to break up the match by staging what appears to be a night visit to Hero's bed by a strange man, witnessed by the others. Meanwhile, sharp and cynical Benedick says there's no point in marriage because the perfect woman doesn't exist; independent, bicycle-riding suffragette-type Beatrice feels just as uninterested in a long-time hook-up with a man. So their friends plot to get the two together.

When Claudio rejects Hero at the altar and demands that Benedick defend Hero's honor by challenging Claudio (it is given out that the shock of rejection killed the girl), Benedick finds himself caught between his best friend and the woman he's falling in love with (or being made to love!). This was a 1973 video recording of the Joseph Papp stage production, directed by A.J. Antoon. It sets Shakespeare's Sicilian play in turn-of-the-last-century U.S., with the men as Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders returning from the Spanish-American war. It's far enough into historical memory that all the ""thee's"" and ""thou's"" don't sound at all out of place. Sets are beautifully elaborate.

Shakespeare's song lyrics are delightfully set to ragtime, sets and costumes are wonderfully period and elaborate, and there are several unforgettable scenes. (I particularly love the one where Beatrice hides among the plants in a solarium to overhear Hero and her maid praising Benedick and his supposed passion for her, then they turn on the sprinkler system and she has to remain hidden and get soaked; and the one where the two principals finally meet and kiss while a wind-up record player grinds to a halt.) Barnard Hughes and the police are done up as the Keystone Kops to provide some slapstick along with Shakespeare's malapropisms. For the time, the sound quality is surprisingly good. My only quibble is that the show drags a little at times; the camera lingers over a few scenes with no action or dialogue -- only music.

For me, the perfect Benedick will always be Waterston's.",1209686400,6,2121,5.002832861189802
1787174,5,B00006RCMU,"Since I wrote a scathing review of the 1993 movie version of ""Much Ado About Nothing"" (directed by Kenneth Branagh) and recommended this version instead, I feel I ought to review this version and give it a well deserved boost. If you like your Shakespeare authentic, this is the version you should buy.

I love Shakespeare. I have seen his plays performed on the stage, on TV, and in the movies. The best productions of Shakespeare are stage productions -- these are the closest to the way the plays would have been done if you had been alive to see one in Elizabethan times. If you cannot make it to a stage production, this version in the next best thing.

Because Shakespeare is dead and the copyright has run out on his plays hundreds of years ago, producers and directors can take any liberties they want when putting on one of Shakespeare's plays. Sometimes the liberties add to the play and sometimes they detract. All of the liberties that Joseph Papp has taken are comic and add to this version.

An example of a good interpretation: I saw a stage version of ""The Taming of the Shrew"" at ACT in San Francisco in the 70s. At the end of Act V, as Kate puts her hand under Petruchio's foot following her famous ""duty of a wife"" speech, she turns aside to the audience and broadly winks -- turning a misogynistic speech into a sly triumph for women. The audience roared with delight.

In this version, Joseph Papp has moved ""Much Ado About Nothing"" to around the 1900s. Beatrice is a suffragette. Benedick is one of Teddy Roosevelt's rough riders. The result is a witty war of the sexes. Slapstick scenes are added by including the Keystone Kops.

Because this is a stage version, it does not contain the beautiful Italian scenery that takes up so much air time in Kenneth Branagh's 1993 movie version. What the heck Branagh's beautiful Italian scenery has to do with Shakespeare is a mystery to me. In Branagh's version Shakespeare's lines are cut to make room for both the scenery and the extremely slow recitation of the lines that remain.

In Joseph Papp's version, the dialog is fast so people who have not read an annotated version of the play first may not be able to keep up. (See negative review below.) However, Shakespearean plays should have fast dialog -- that is the way the Bard wrote it to be played.

Shakespearean comedies are meant to be light and madcap, with mistaken identities and cross-dressing and outright clowning. This is what appealed to audiences around 1600.  A good modern version of a Shakespearean comedy compares well to a Monty Python movie in silliness.

There are no big name stars in this version (although I have always been fond of Sam Waterson). The conversations between Benedick and Beatrice are all the more wittier for their rapid fire delivery. (There's something about a slow delivery that flattens out the wit.)

This is a version of ""Much Ado About Nothing"" that Shakespeare himself would have heartily approved of and enjoyed.  I hope you enjoy it too.",1173139200,12,3008,4.678030303030303

7972390,5,B00006RCMU,"I don't know how many productions of this play I've seen--or how many films of Shakespeare I've seen in general--but this is my absolute favorite. This mid-70's videotaped television special is much cleverer than the 1993 movie, whose all-star cast didn't work very well, and far more natural and appealing than Joss Whedon's 2012 film. It was the victim of its own success; the Shakespeare in the Park production was so good that it went to Broadway; the Broadway show was so popular that it was televised (this is it), and so many people saw that television broadcast that ticket sales dried up and the Broadway show closed.

For years this was available only on bootleg off-the-air videotape. Then Broadway Theater Archive finally released it on VHS and at last on DVD. The only filmed Shakespeare that comes close is the 1968 Midsummer Night's Dream with--incredibly--Judy Dench, Ian Richardson, Helen Mirren, Diana Rigg, Ian Holm, and David Wagner--all very young and practically unknown then. If you can find that one on DVD, buy it!",1505606400,,1039,4.971264367816092

7972398,5,B00006RCMU,"I saw this when it was first broadcast, in 1973, just a few months after I had played Dogberry in a college production. I absolutely fell in love with this production, and it remains my single favorite version of any of Shakespeare's comedies. Sam Waterston and Kathleen Widdoes are just amazing as Benedick and Beatrice, with Widdoes having, perhaps, a slight edge. (I'm sure I am not the only guy who, in seeing this, developed a huge crush on her Beatrice.)
A.J. Antoon's original directorial interpretation is realized wonderfully in this TV adaptation.
Barnard Hughes' Dogberry is beautifully understated, and designing his make-up to suggest Uncle Sam is a wonderful touch.
But there are two performances that are often overlooked when discussing this production that are nothing short of genius. The one is Douglass Watson as Don Pedro (he is equally brilliant as Kent opposite the Lear of James Earl Jones in a production of King Lear just a few years later). The way that Watson and Widdoes play the scene in which Don Pedro works up the courage to propose to Beatrice is a moment of subtle perfection, and her equally subtle declining is marked with honor and compassion and providing Don Pedro with a dignified, face-saving out. That Watson uses this moment as the springboard for bringing together Beatrice and Benedick causes both ache and smile because of this man.
While at the other end of humanity, Jerry Mayer gives us a Don John who is a complex comic delight. He is one of Shakespeare's greatest comic villains, who almost succeeds in his nefarious plans. Whether it's expressing his frustration at being forgiven by his brother by shooting at swans as they glide gracefully through the water of the pond, throwing a big ol' hissy fit temper tantrum when his attempt to thwart his brother's work in getting Claudius and Hero engaged, or falling into a piano duet with Borachio when the latter comes up with a plan to cause even deeper mischief, Mayer does wonderful work.
And the music for the production is pretty damn good as well.
(I just recently re-watched this production, and it has lost none of its charm.)",1399507200,,2134,4.8493150684931505
