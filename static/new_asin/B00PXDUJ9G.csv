8689693,5,B00PXDUJ9G,"I enjoyed the movie. However it was not what I expected. I expected it to have something to do with a cult or devil worship. It did not have that , instead it was about two sisters who murdered others because of their twisted thinking. I did enjoy the movie and would recommend it to those who like movies like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. and another movie I watched called The American Psycho.",1447632000,,393,4.472222222222222

8689696,4,B00PXDUJ9G,"The 70's saw a remarkably fertile horror scene grow in Spain, showcasing a lot of directors and other creative minds that would produce some of the most memorable and lasting horror films of the decade.  Among these new faces was Eugenio Martin, two of whose movies have entered the public domain in the U.S.: the amazing sci-fi/horror/period extravaganza Horror Express and this film, A Candle for the Devil.  Long known to American viewers in a butchered TV version called It Happened at Nightmare Inn, the film here receives its first legit U.S. DVD release in its uncut version in a sparkling widescreen transfer thanks to the folks at Scorpion Releasing.

Marta and Veronica run a dilapidated hotel in an old Spanish resort town, and their strict religious fervor has a way of getting in the way of young women on the other side of the Sexual Revolution.  After a liberated guest falls down the stairs to her death and some of her blood runs across some stained glass the older sister takes it as a sign from God, which is unfortunate considering that the young-and-sophisticated Laura (Judy Geeson) has just strolled in their front door looking for lodging.  The film reveals a lot about the two sisters, such as the younger one's affair with a local townie and the older one's habit of snooping at the beach to watch young men bathe nude, but unfortunately their insistence on keeping their faith strong ends up with tourist corpses piling up.  Will Laura be the next victim, and will the sisters confront each other to stop the killings?  And what's in the wine casks?

While bad-stuff-happening-in-a-hotel movies were very prevalent post-Psycho, A Candle for the Devil is a surprisingly thoughtful and measured character-based horror gem.  It's a great example of the big difference between Spanish horror movies of the 70's and contemporaneous Italian horror movies - while the Italian flicks tended to be better shot and more extravagantly designed, Spanish horror movies tried harder to be real movies and as such were just better-told stories with better characters, ideas and flow.  The premise of Candle might be familiar and there is certainly a lot of saucy content but the movie really cares about the sisters and their complex relationship, and it's actually kind of rare to find a horror movie with a really fleshed-out, believable pair of siblings as its main characters (see Jeepers Creepers for a good example of this).  The acting is excellent from the sisters, even with the dubbed English soundtrack, and I'm really glad to see the movie in its uncut form so we can let the mood and depth of the film really sink in.  It's also interesting to see a horror movie focus on the sexual needs and obsessions of straight women, as the bulk of the nudity is male and seen from the perspective of the sisters (see The Witch who Came from the Sea for another good example of this).  A Candle for the Devil is a great intro to Spanish horror and it's good to see it finally get a proper release in the States.",1438905600,7,3025,4.772030651340996

8689698,3,B00PXDUJ9G,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

 I rented Sobrenatural (1981) directed by Eugenio Martin, under the title ""Return of the Poltergeist"" in VHS at some rare video store. It deals with a woman who is married to a tyrannical old geezer. She has a kind man whom she is seeing. Turns out the jealous old geezer has an accident of some sort and winds up on the bed in bandages. Eventually he dies but comes back to haunt his former wife. The dated look of the film and lack of lighting in some scenes render it 'creepy' at times if you watch it alone late at night but there is not enough sustained interest to make it truly worthwhile. There's scenes of Supernatural activity like things being tossed in the air, etc. It's one of those foreign films that were made to capitalize on popular American supernatural horror films, namely the far superior The Entity (1981).

I probably saw a cut up bootleg version so I don't know if scenes were deleted or added.

If anyone wants to buy a copy I know a place that sells it. Send me a message.",1389571200,,1041,4.3782383419689115
