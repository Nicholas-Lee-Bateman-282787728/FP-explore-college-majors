7998550,5,B0000CAXHU,"Our local library ordered this DVD. I am glad I can enjoy the show in the midst of 2016 Blizzard. The show was outdoor in Austria. It's about the story in Spain and North Africa Morocco. Giuditta is a similar character as Carmen, freedom is everything.

Nice costume and dancing. Fireworks was synchronized with the music at the end. Just relax and enjoy it. The famous song is Meine Lippen, Sie Kussen So Heiss (My lips, they kiss with such fire).",1453680000,,448,4.530864197530864
7998551,3,B0000CAXHU,"Review for Lehar Giuditta/ Morbisch live prodution

I can verify that this edition only has English subtitles. Given the high prices this performance gets on various sites I would caution those interested not to pay too much for it. I agree with other reviewers that there is not likely to be another DVD of this wonderful operetta so it is worth getting to see the staging. However, the performance while undoubtedly pleasant enough for those sitting out in the audience on a warm evening is not likely to earn much repeated viewing.

First the singing is merely competent not very stirring. Because of the nature of an open air performance performers wear head mics. Thus one is not hearing their natural voice but a wireless amplification of it. (Wireless mic'ing is much less sonically adequate than a wired mic.) Above mezzoforte the sound definitely becomes congested and slightly hard. The acting, staging and lighting has to be somewhat broad stroked given the distance of the audience from the stage. There is a decent amount of chemistry between the two leads but other performers are not memorable. It also has to be acknowledged that current performers simply aren't inside this repertoire the way those performers from the 30s to 60s were. The last point where truly idiomatic performances of Lehar's operettas could be done was in the early 80s with Gedda, Rothenberger etc. So if one loves the operetta wait for a reasonably priced copy to appear.",1401321600,3,1462,4.939024390243903
7998552,4,B0000CAXHU,"Lehar, as one of the most highly admired Viennese Operetta composers, gave us the world-renowned MERRY WIDOW which is still widely performed in world theaters in concept productions everwhere. He also gave us the delightful COUNT OF LUXEMBURG,ontinuously staged only in northern and Eastern Europe as a perfect gem of a tuneful, silly Viennese Operetta with enough fleeting soco-economic references in the undertones to make this perhaps the classic model of a Viennese operetta. His last work is the elaborate GIUDITTA, premiered not as an operetta, but as a grand opera at the Vienna State opera with opera diva Jarmila Novotna and guest star Richard Tauber in the central roles. It oncerns a virtually enslaved woman of Andalusia who fashions birdcage baskets for her apparently morganatic husband to sell. She spontaneously runs off to Africa with a naieve army officer whom she has just met,whereupon proceeds a melodrama with each deciding at the end that they have been given a bitter yet fleeting glance of how low the other has sunk after he decides he will no longer be her meal ticket or her paramour. With three sets in real life in defined time and two sets in a fantasy setting in a nonspecific future time, as well as with some pretty elaborate staging requirements, it has always been an enigma because amateur and professional opera and operetta companies are not sure in what niche to consider it. It is a lusty sing and a pleasure to behold in a well-funded stadium sized setting. This DVD may be the average person's only chance to experience it.",1305504000,2,1566,4.890977443609023
7998553,5,B0000CAXHU,"The seefestspiele of Morbisch appears to be the major source of German Operetta on DVD.  This production is lavish.  The set and costumes are eye catching.  I cannot comment on the quality of the singing compared to a standard of excellence, but all seem to do a very nice job.  The performance is enjoyable.  The sound is clear and the DVD visual quality is excellent, particularly once the evening lights come on.  Natalia Ushakova is beautiful.  The ballet in the third act has very abreviated costumes, if that is of concern to you.  I wish there were productions from the Volksoper in Vienna or the Theater on the Wein, but one must take what one can get get when it comes to this art form.",1238889600,16,695,4.504
7998554,4,B0000CAXHU,"There seem to be a number of different imports of the same performance as appears in this one. Contrary to the product information provided by Amazon my copy (same cover as appears in this listing) claims to have only English subtitles for the operetta which is sung in German. The accompanying booklet with a brief summary of the action appears in 6 languages.
As to the performance, it seems to be the only one available at the moment if Amazons catalog is complete. As such, I can certainly recommend it for an entertaining evening. While one cannot hope for the likes of the inimitable Richard Tauber, the original lead, nor Theresa Strata, whose performance of one number appears on YouTube, the cast is quite able to recreate the songs with appropriate dramatic effect and give the production a suitable operetta flavor. It took a few minutes to accommodate to head microphones on each singer and to the dynamics of staging in an outdoor setting but once over that hurdle one is able to join the large audience (however, as if sitting in the most expensive seats) as the production unfolds in true operetta style. Scenic design admirably enhances the action while many of the production numbers are reminiscent of the staging to be found in the Big 1940-50's American movie musicals.
All in all, a colorful evening dedicated to nothing more significant than the pleasure of the audience. In achieving that objective it is, indeed, successful.",1230076800,22,1448,4.890243902439025
7998555,4,B0000CAXHU,"I was reluctant to purchase this without reading other reviews after our collective disappointment with Vogelhandler....I'm glad I took the chance!  This would have received 5 rather than 4 stars but Ushakova couldn't get a handle on the high passages. Mehrzad Montazeri was wonderful and the performance is just plain old fun.

Watch it and enjoy!",1210377600,22,348,5.196428571428571
