1715260,1,B000067IXR,"Do not get this movie!!  I repeat do not get this movie!!  This movie was so bad that I had to take action.  I have never written a review for anything until now!
This movie exposes the major problem with movies nowadays.  The movie makers give too much time and money for special effects, digital graphics and animations, flamboyant sets and gaudy costumes, but not any money or time towards developing a story, editing, setting up atmospheres and staying with them, flow of story, development of relationships true to character, a psychology of good and evil, or even a good music score that follows the movie (instead of being off in its own universe).  A movie doesn't have to have a blockbuster budget in order to accomplish these things.
Also, sci-fi fantasy movies generally don't look right with the high tech film of today.  If one looks at fantasy movies from the 80's the film itself is grainy which gives the film an air already of being not from our world.  Too clear and life-imitating film just makes the characters look out of place, and out of time.  Furthermore, it must be difficult trying to act in a scene with a green screen behind you instead of actually being in that place, or some natural environment for that matter.
First of all (if I haven't already begun) I have a problem with movies being under 80 minutes (actual movie time, excluding credits), unless they are a comedy.  Can one truly develop a plot in under 80 minutes that really brings to light human subjects and matters?  hmm...
Second of all, I don't even care that it didn't follow the original movie storyline, or Ende's wonderful book (which I recommend that you read).  The movie itself is bad!!  Bad acting, portrayal of evil is silly (watch Willow to see a good portrayal of evil for all ages); too many scene jumps not allowing one to absorb the scene itself (why continue to go from real life to fantasy story to real life to fantasy story so quickly, it chops up the fantasy story and doesn't allow one to immerse themselves in it); stupid decisions made by the characters themselves; horrible costumes that take away emphasis from the acting (the costumes looked more like an Elementary School play being done to out-do itself); bad one-liners and even worse delivery of potent messages and normal dialogue between characters on the actors part (which should have been noticed by the producers and directors).
Oh yeah, Tell Atreyu to get that stupid look of confusion and disbelief off his face.  If he was a fierce warrior he would be more confident in himself and his ability to handle situations that he has no direct control of.
Thirdly, your children should also feel as though there are being dumbed-down, taken for idiots, fooled, scammed, swindled, cheated of what could possibly be some very important life lessons (that were well told in the original movie).  Do directors and producers honestly think that children can't handle more grown up storylines?  I remember watching movies such as The Princess Bride and The Neverending Story when I was young and loving them, even though things went over my head.  Now as a young adult I have noticed the very grown up material in them, how it was wonderfully presented with a passion (not for money or profit, but purpose), and have fully come to appreciate those movies even more.
And a movie can be fun and an educational experience (for life lessons more importantly) at the same time.  There is no reason to chose one over the other.  One lesson taught from this movie is how not to make a movie.
If you have already bought it, such as myself, then I feel sorry for you too.  If you haven't bought it then don't even buy it used, unless you want to treat yourself to a painful experience.  Don't show any support for this movie.  Send it back to the studio with a letter stating your disapproval, or whatever you would like to show, if you can.  I feel sorry for the actors of this film, but, hey, every actor needs a couple skeletons in their closet.  And shame on the executives, the directors, the producers and the editors.  You should have understood better.",1033862400,26,4122,4.661602209944752
1715261,5,B000067IXR,It is the start of a great series.  They remade The Neverending Story into a great series.  They remade it using todays stuff.  It is a new great series.  I would recomand it.,1030147200,2,175,4.212121212121212
1715282,4,B000067IXR,"This is fairly well organized dramatization of Michael Ende's everlasting fantasy. I must admit it deviates so much from the original story but this dramatization rather make up for what original story left behind. Parallel stories interconnecting each other reflects troubling state of mind Bastian suffers in his real life. He lost his mother in a very tragic accident and his school life goes heywire. He has to move his home and have to face with stranger his father is planning to get married. What an ordeal 12-year old boy has to face. Gmork takes the form of the substitute teacher who always give Bastian a hard time. Why moonchild is adult-like here? I guess moonchild is the reflection of Bastian's mother and Xayide reflects Bastian's fear of facing reality. As a 1984 version of NES fan it really hurts to see the Falkor chained and tortured by Xayide. And Fly Girl (Stefani Buxton) and Atreyu (Tyler Hynes) reminds me of Nausicaa and Asbel in ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"". I am really surprised to see Atreyu skateboarding in Bastian's world. It is very entertaining version and I like the way Bastian get over with his real world problems though Neverending Story.

Verdict: A bit deviated from original story but is finely reorganized.
Rating: 89 out of 100. Cracking password is a crime! Five points taken.
Recommened for Fantasy Novel fans in general who likes Ghibli works or Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia series.",1256428800,2,1471,4.837301587301587
1715283,1,B000067IXR,"You know you're in trouble when you constantly can't help saying to yourself: ""I could act better than him, I could act better than her!"" After a while I realized I could act better than any character in the entire film! The acting is that unconvincing and poor - it's beyond belief. Some other words to describe the acting talent of the performers is - cardboard, camp, dopey and annoying!

If the acting was not bad enough, the story was even worse! This film was totally devoid of any entertainment value, whatsoever, for the mind of an adult! Personally, I think most children, and certainly teens, would be bored to tears!

It's obvious to me that Tales from the NeverEnding Story - The Beginning is an attempt to make a quick buck off of The NeverEnding Story. To essentially turn a wonderful story into a commodity, like toothpaste or underarm deodorant. If you must see this godforsaken film out of curiosity, at least buy it used so you won't encourage a sequel!

1715284,3,B000067IXR,"This movie got so far from the original that it lost some of the whimsy in the original.
But it was told though different eyes.",1204243200,,127,4.12
1715285,2,B000067IXR,"This movie is pretty loosely related to the original story. About half of this movie is about Bastian in the real world and he is being attacked by a character who is based off of the wolf from the original story, except he can turn into a human in the real world. The part of the book that is in Fantasia is not even close to how it was in the other story. Atreyu is a clumsy kid from some sort of indian tribe. The nothing is contained in a box and controlled by the child-like empress's evil sister. It doesn't destroy Fantasia either, it just turns people into ""drones"" that are like the sister's slaves. And I can't recall if this happens in the first or the second one, but the main goal in the first one of giving the empress a new name is not a big part of this one at all and after they do it they are just searching for the luck dragon the whole rest of the time. The only reason this gets two stars is because the ending was so incomplete that I had to go buy the second one to find out what happened next even though I didn't even enjoy the first one.",1169337600,2,1063,4.018867924528302
1715286,2,B000067IXR,"""Tales From The NeverEnding Story"" is a series of Canadian TV specials re-imagining Michael Ende's novel. I'd seen it around for a while, thinking it was perhaps a more accurate, fuller interpretation of the book (especially seeing as though there are more of these specials than there are the original movies). Checking it out, here on amazon, I found out it wasn't like that at all. Still, I decided to give it a try. For the most part, it's not that great, and I really feel bad saying that, being a fan of both Ende's concepts and the films they inspired.

Bastian is a big reader, but he's a bigger player of video games. All that changes when he bumps into a Mr Coreander, and drops his gameboy, smashing on the pavement. Mr Coreander, though he thinks its better smashed up, offers to pay for the game with a book, and shows Bastian back to his store. He hasn't any money, so a book will have to do. Bastian ends up borrowing the NeverEnding Story, a book which ends up changing his life forever, and a book who he changes forever by reading.

It's lower budget than the films, I could handle that, and the actors do the best with what they're given, I think. (The trouble is, what they're given doesn't work that well. The directing could have been a bit tighter in places too. The original 1984 film had an atmospheric mystery around everything that happened, The Nothing, the Child-Like Empress, even around real-life characters like Mr Coreander. Here, everything is very clear and all too well explained, leaving very little of that mystery that makes fantasies so interesting to watch (for me, anyway). The concepts draw you in, they always did, so do the new costumes, but here they draw you into a place that leaves a bad taste in the mouth, a place that doesn't feel right. Also a lot of the more famous characters aren't in this one, which was a shame. (No Rockbiter, practically no Luck Dragon, etc.)

Even with everything against it, the last half hour of this 87 minute special is fairly entertaining. It's not what I'd call The NeverEnding Story, but it's a lot more watchable than the start. It could get better, this series, there is definitely a chance, and I'll probably check out the next special to see if it does. As for this one, two and half stars, I think.",1162166400,8,2287,4.546116504854369
1715287,1,B000067IXR,"This is by far the worst rendition of The Neverending Story ever produced. This statement includes the dreadful Neverending Story 3. The screenwriting is so bland as to narratively explain every step of the story, not allowing any personal interpretation to enter. The story is manipulated to the point that names and places become merely references to objects, and not the rich allegorical themes that Ende originally intended them to be. Unlike the cartoon series, which I recommend for its attempt to visualize people and places from the book not covered by the Warner Bros. movies, this movie repeatedly copies the first two movies without any inventions of its own (except a cute character named Flygirl, but that's another story, and shall be told another time...) The majority of this movie is spent in tight, confined spaces when they would do better to reflect the broadness and grandeur of Fantastica. I most definitely would not recommend this movie.",1041552000,39,961,5.0886075949367084
1715288,3,B000067IXR,"This movie is not as bad as you guys are saying. I just watched it no more than 30 minutes ago. I thought the story was pretty good. I enjoyed it alot. I am 22 years old and a huge fan of The Neverending Story. I thought it was interesting to see a new take on the story. I enjoyed the characters in the fantasy story more than the real one, mainly because of the actors. I felt that they could have gotten a much better actor for the dad, he seemed to me to be more of a stage actor than for screen.
As for the way it left you hanging. I don't think it left me hanging anymore than ""LOTR: Fellowship Of The Rings"" did. I think the way it ending was in a way symbolic. The scenario in the ""real world"" had an ending, but the way the story in Fantasia didn't really have closure was to symbolize the fact that it's the ""Neverending"" story. I think it's definatly worth seeing.",1040860800,2,875,4.0344827586206895
1715289,2,B000067IXR,"First off, the only reason I'm giving this ""movie"" more than one star is because, in the deep recesses of my mind, i still find it impossible that it could have been this bad. I mean, it remains one of my favorite novels. I even loved the first two movies. When I saw the cover of the dvd, I had to get it. In my life, I now regret few things more. If the attention and effort put into the cover of this ""movie"" had been half that of the ""movie"" itself, I wouldn't feel this deep sadness that now sweeps over me. There should be a disclaimer somewhere on the box that says ""WARNING! This ""movie"" is NOT as good as it looks! Buy the original and for God's sake, read the book!"" Bottom line: the production quality is questionable, the dialogue is deplorable (the WB would have rejected this!), and the plot couldn't be farther from that of Michael Ende's novel. A new spin is one thing, a desecration is another.
  Wait! I've got an idea!  What if they made this movie so bad so people WOULD go and read the book?  I don't know...I'm searching for explanations here.",1034812800,4,1065,4.2835820895522385
