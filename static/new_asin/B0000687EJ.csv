7963757,3,B0000687EJ,"This cheap DVD is in 3 parts. The first is Alan Cathcart test riding several race bikes from the 2000 season at various tracks. The Japan sessions were basically rained out so Alan just does a lot of pointing and talking at the bikes, during that segment. The next part of the DVD is a Performance Bikes (UK magazine) round up of so-called sportsbikes of the same year. Only they apparently couldn't borrow a couple so some are missing. In their place are some sports touring machines. This segment of the DVD only had value to me because it contains footage of several writers at Performance Bikes, whoes articles I've read in the past. The actual attempt at ranking that years bikes is something of a joke. The rest of the DVD has a recap of why the GSXR 1000 was voted bike of the year. Theres also some random (seeming) video taken at the Isle of Man, in the off season, with testers riding various big bore bikes around those streets.

In closing, theres nothing on this DVD that I would describe as important to have, but on the other hand its dirt cheap. Its worth the price as a curiosity, to watch once with attention- and then thereafter when you are dead bored.",1251417600,,1172,4.4511627906976745
