Oddly enough, I didn't get to see this movie over there in England, but I got to see it here, when I back into the States.  This movie was HUGE in England,  and strangely enough, not over here...  I don't know what exactly happened  when this movie crossed the pond, but evidently when this movie got over  here from England, it took a nose dive right into our eastern sea shore.  I  really LOVED this movie, and it's a GREAT  flick, if you want to watch  Petty's character stomp, (oddly enough ""Stomp"" is a title of one  of the songs in this movie) the fire out of McDonell's character, and then  go on to save the world's water supply all at one time.",922233600,,715,4.214814814814815

669624,1,6303492509,"Not sure how I missed watching this growing up, but I certainly didn't miss anything good.  Tedious, slow, and feeling very forced, though Malcolm McDowell's performance in the beginning at least kept me watching until the formulaic and predictable end.

The unfortunate mixing of comic book stills with the ""action"" scenes, left the film feeling even more fragmented than the low budget shooting and editing alone would have left them.  I'm not sure what they were trying to get at dropping these cartoon stills into the film in the first place.  Were they storyboard that they didn't have live action scenes to cover?  Were they trying to show the fans of the comic that they were sticking strictly to the source material (though flailing badly)?  Regardless of the intent, this editing decision pulled the bar well below even the worst Sci Fi movie level of quality.

And Jet Girl?  Very cute, but didn't really use her jet for anything jetty.  Overall, this dud made Highlander II seem clever and well presented.",1501977600,,1016,4.894736842105263

670584,3,6303492509,"Tank Girl, with Lori Petty, is a difficult movie to review.  I am a fan of the comic book, so I looked for places or story lines that tied to what I had read - even that left a lot to be desired.  As far as a the movie, itself, it seemed to be a story stuck in between wanting to be a dark tale - something along the lines of the original Mad Max, and the campy 1966 Batman TV series - full of corny jokes and non-realistic fight scenes.  I think the movie also demonstrated, once again, how difficult it is to replicate what is apparently easy to do in a comic book or in animation onto the big screen.  The Aeon Flux move, with Charlize Theron, suffered a similar fate.",1444521600,,671,4.022556390977444

Tank Girl is just one screwball scene after another.  It plays like slapstick and is just plain goofy.  This is a movie for the ManCave and hanging out with the fellas.  Trust me, the wife or girlfriend will not be impressed at all.",1437004800,,495,4.651162790697675

in image clarity, color and sound-over the region 2 DVD edition of the film, by MGM.
The rich color palette of the comic book/animation sequences must be seen to be believed.
Even the Shout Factory DVD copy of the film-which is included in this product-
is clearly superior to the Region 2 DVD.
The aspect ratio of the film is 2,35:1. There are optional English HOH subtitles for the film,
but the words of the songs are not transcribed. (They are transcribed in the Region 2 DVD).
The following extras-included in both discs-are not subtitled for the hard of hearing people:
** Baseball, Tanks and Bad Tattoos-an interview with actress Lori Petty.
** Too Hip For Spielberg-an interview with director Rachel Talalay.
** Creative Chaos:Designing the World of Tank Girl-an interview with production designer Catherine Hardwicke.
** Vintage ""Making-of Tank Girl"" Featurette.

Lori Petty was the perfect pick for the part of Tank Girl, her sense of timing is great and the one liners keep coming. Rising against oppression has never been so fun. However there is a dark undercurrent as well, a child is stolen and Tank Girl is off to rescue. Malcolm McDowell is the villain in this movie and you can tell how much he relished the part, putting the smarmy into evil all the way. It does have nudity, dialog is adult oriented, cartoon-like violence and lots of attitude. The cast is brilliant. I wish they would do a second movie, in the meantime the comics are out.

672188,2,6303492509,"<strong>Tank Girl</strong> (Rachel Talalay, 1995)

<em>Tank Girl</em> was ahead of its time by a pretty wide margin--made long before the current ""we'll-make-anything-that-was-ever-a-graphic-novel!"" craze came into fashion, when if it wasn't a recognizable superhero you were up the creek. (And even that wasn't a guarantee of success, viz. the mid-nineties Batman flicks.) Needless to say, in benefit of hindsight, that is not always a problem. What IS a problem with this film specifically, however, was a couple of decisions that took what was already a vertical-market property and rammed it into a niche so narrow that to this day, the movie has a small (very small) core of fans surrounded by a mass of detractors that dwarfs it. Those decisions: Lori Petty and Rachel Talalay.

The latter first here: Talalay's resume, before she was attached to this huge-in-scope big-budget ($25 million per IMDB) sci-fi piece, included <em>Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare</em> (doesn't it go without saying that was a turd?) and the godawful <em>Ghost in the Machine</em>, both basement-budget horror flicks. Whose brilliant idea involved letting a director with an exclusively horror pedigree make this? I don't know the answer to that question, but the result stands for itself; in the seventeen years since <em>Tank Girl</em>, Talalay has not directed another feature film.

And then there is Lori Petty, and whatever Talalay's contributions to this flick, it is my belief that how you react to the film will depend entirely on how you react to Lori Petty. I have, as far as I can tell, never seen her play anything but Lori Petty, from this movie to those ill-conceived ""go baby go"" commercials the NTRA came up with in the late nineties. Every time I have seen her on a screen, big or small, I have found her insufferable, obnoxious and ill-spoken (in the sense of needing elocution lessons rather than a remedial English class). I was thinking that that personality makes sense for this role, but it didn't help. I couldn't watch more than ten minutes of the movie at a time. I also blame the movie for killing the promising feature career of Ice-T, who previous to this had turned in sharp, smart roles in underrated movies like <em>Ricochet</em>, <em>Trespass</em>, and <em>Surviving the Game</em>, and who afterwards was reduced to <em>Johnny Mnemonic</em>, <em>'R Xmas</em>, and, god help the poor guy, <em>Frankenpenis</em>, the John Wayne Bobbitt movie. In fact, I think the only actor in the entire film whose career was not at least temporary negatively affected by it was Naomi Watts.

Be that as it may, and despite Petty and Talalay, the film isn't all bad. Watts is good, as she usually is, though her part is far smaller than it needed to be, and the rippers, among whom are Ice-T and Reg E. Cathey (<em>The Machinist</em>), are kind of fun, even if the make-up effects on them look as if they were designed by a six-year-old girl with a teddy bear fetish. But prepare to watch in small doses. **",1332979200,,3011,4.99203187250996

672196,3,6303492509,"I saw this when it was originally released on VHS and it looked really cool. I went to it wanting to like it, but that didn't happen. It just wasn't that good. It was kinda hip, kinda cool but somehow it didn't mesh.

It came up in my radar again and all the positive user reviews prompted me to give it another go, but it fared no better this time around. As I watched it I figured out that the problem lied mostly in Tank Girl herself. She's big on the wise cracks and always has a one liner ready to go, but it is all a bit too cute and light. Seems to me that after seeing her boyfriend (husband?) gunned down, and is uncertain as to the fate of her daughter, she would be hell bent on revenge. Here, she's no where near as effected as she should be. Yes. She's going to set out to find her daughter and do in the bad guys but she lacks any sense of fire.

Lori Petty plays Tank Girl who is a renegade in the wasteland that is earth. It was hit by an asteroid and most of civilization is wiped out along with most of the drinking water. The Water and Power company, headed by the usually nasty Malcolm McDowell, wants to control ALL the water which means getting Petty and her rebels out of the way.

The costumes are a bit ""too"" as are the sets but, as it's derived from a comic book, I guess you have to figure that into the equation. And, as usual, the bad guys can't shoot for beans and the good guys can put your eye out at a hundred yards and that gets tired way too fast.

There is a lot of fun here but, all things considered, it still needs a better Tank Girl both on the script and in the casting. I like Lori Petty enough but she doesn't have enough edge. We're talking revenge here and she always seems like she's on her way to, or at, a party. She also lacks a certain physical presence. She's a bit too tiny. You need to know that your heroine can kick some butt.

This isn't a bad movie, but I did find myself waiting for the end and that isn't a good thing. If you're up for some mindless fun then have at it. If you need something with more meat on its bones then skip it.",1285804800,,2093,3.9976076555023923
672197,3,6303492509,"While I absolutely love this movie, it is absolute trash when compared to the comic. If you're a fan of the comic, you'll probably want to skip this movie entirely. This is Tank Girl in almost name only. Entire characters have been re-imagined for this movie, with poor Booga getting the worst treatment of all: he goes from being a character of normal intelligence to being a simpleton.

The movie has Rebecca (AKA Tank Girl) going after a super company named Water & Power, as well as its evil leader Kesslee. Why? Because he destroyed her home, killed her boyfriend, kidnapped her friend, & tried to brainwash her into joining him. While she's in prison she meets the shy Jet Girl & together they end up eventually joining forces with the mythical Rippers to save TG's friend & end Kesslee's reign of terror.

Well... like I said initially, when you compare this to the dynamics of the comics, this is a terrible movie. Plots are inserted, characters are changed, & some characters are left out entirely. You'd be better off distancing yourself entirely from the original source material if you decide to watch this film. Forget the title of the film & call it something else. You're not finding real Tank Girl here. In this aspect, the film is absolutely horrible.

As far as camp value goes, the movie is pretty darn good. While this movie isn't really all that good by most movie standards, it does manage to have a fun feel to it & it's a good if you want to see something & turn your brain off. This film just goes over the top in just about everything it tries to do & if not for that, this film would have been a great deal more unwatchable for me. For many the best parts of the film would be the animated & comic sequences, as they were for me. However, where the film fell apart for me is towards the end. It's animated, which is fun, but it doesn't really give the viewer any real sense of what is going on. It's like someone wrote it while they were on an acid trip. Then again, it is still better than the alternate Sub Girl ending, which is painfully acted, paced, & plotted. (I saw it via a youtube clip.)

Overall this film is going to be one of those movies you either love or you hate. I love it, especially since it introduced me to the far superior comics, but I can see where I'd have hated it if I'd read the comics first. That's why I'm giving this a 3 star rating- although I'd have given it a 4 or 5 star rating in my teens, it just didn't age well with me. This is a rental. Then & only then should you buy the movie.",1282953600,2,2546,4.297916666666667

672330,3,6303492509,"This is a dumb movie but at least it's a fun one. Easily ranks as a cult classic and boasts set designs from 'Twilight' director Catherine Hardwicke and choreography by 'Hairspray' director Adam Shankman. It also has a mousy Naomi Watts in a crucial supporting role. And for better or worse Lori Petty.

The year is 2033 and two groups of resistance fighters are locked in a bloody battle with the maniacal Kesslee (Malcolm McDowell) who is on a mission to snatch up what's left of the world's water. After a meteor destroyed nearly everything H20 has become scarce and Kesslee is determined to control it all. He even kills his own men just for the water in their bodies. The first group of resistance fighters is led by a man who happens to be the boyfriend of one Tank Girl (Lori Petty). Along with his daughter and a few of their fellow soldiers him and Tank Girl live in a beach house with plenty of pot growing in the basement. When Kesslee learns of the group's hideout he has his men destroy the place and kill everyone in the process. Only Tank Girl and her boyfriend's daughter escape. Tank Girl is forced to work in Kesslee's mines after she refuses to help him wipe out the other resistance group: genetically engineered half man/half kangaroo soldiers called the Rippers. While working in the mines she befriends a shy pilot named Jet (Naomi Watts). Jet is in constant danger of being raped by one of the guards so Tank Girl steps in and protects her. The two bide their time while hatching an escape plan. When they see their opportunity they make off with a Jet piloted jet plane and Tank Girl in a mammoth tank of her own. The two wander the wasteland searching for water and their like minded allies the Rippers hoping to team up with the beasts so that they can wipe out Kesslee once and for all.

The film doesn't make things that easy for the girls. They find themselves in all kinds of bizarre situations that add to the film's eccentricity. Rather than limiting themselves to being a sci-fi/action movie, the filmmakers throw in plenty of other genres as well. Petty's rapid fire banter wouldn't be out of place in a 30's screwball comedy, true to the story's comic book origin there are plenty of comic strip panels used instead of live action to further the story along and there is even an out of nowhere but delightful musical number set to Cole Porter in a futuristic brothel. Oh, there's also horny, sax playing kangaroos as well. The film packs a lot into an hour and a half. Not all of it is successful or even logical but what makes it such a fun film is that everyone involved plays by their own rules. The acting is good and manages to stand out which is all the more impressive considering the background chaos taking place. McDowell is menacing and amusing the way he usually is and Watts does a good job turning Jet from a shy girl into a tough hero. She steals plenty of scenes whenever she's next to Petty since it doesn't seem like Petty could comprehend Watt's restrained less is more performance. If Peter Travers of Rolling Stone can boldly claim, as he often does, that an actor gives a performance that ""deserves to be legendary"", then I'm gonna do the same here. Petty gives a performance that deserves to be legendary if only to show what happens when you get the opportunity to headline a big budget movie only to see the film and your career tank (no pun intended)  thanks to an over the top, often grating performance. But hey that's what makes the movie memorable  her all or nothing attitude. You just have to learn to take the good with the bad when it comes to 'Tank Girl'. It's definitely an experience.",1266969600,2,3657,4.51131221719457

Naomi Watts, a brunette no less, impresses even though she's essentially riding shotgun to Petty.  And those Kangaroo Men are way cool!  The downside here is that the film seems to be more artifice than art.  The art direction is way too busy.  The grunge rock soundtrack is headache inducing.

So that's why in 1995, when this ""action flick"" dared to be different, and cast a little-known actress in the lead role and a gangster rapper wearing a mutant kangaroo suit as support, with a story based off an obscure British comic, audiences turned their backs and ran. Critics hated it, the creators of the comic series hated it, and the director and star hated what the studio did to it,and somehow, the few people who did see it (it grossed $4 million on a $25 million budget), loved it.

The movie is incredibly fast-paced, the visuals are very there, and the story is entertaining at all points. Lori Petty embodies Tank Girl, Naomi Watts shines in a pre-fame role, Malcom McDowell is (as always) the perfect villain, and even Ice-T, in one of his first acting gigs, does pretty well behind Stan Winston's (incredible) make-up.

672446,3,6303492509,"I have to admit I'm shocked and a little appalled that this film doesn't get more recognition than it deserves. It's based around the comic character of the same name, the comic design was based around the punk era look and many will recognise that the art and stories are particularly anarchic and totally absurd. Unlike many other comic book to film adaptations, Tank Girl keeps true to its comic roots, if only to fade away to tone down the sex a bit. During the course of the film, it tries to keep so close to the comic feel that some scenes are blended together through the comic type art. Although it did try to keep to the same chaotic style of the popular comic, the movie ultimately bombed at the Box Office, with many people simply saying it wore them out.

There's no doubting the films unlimited amount of energy and bucket full of comic wit and charm. I'm not very familiar with the work of Lori Petty so I can't exactly compare her role as Tank Girl to any of her other work, the only thing I can say is that she was awesome in the role.

The settings aren't anything to write home about, but that's not a problem as it's not really a film that requires any large and detailed environments. It doesn't try to be big budget, it's merely a movie that gives you what you need in order to follow the plot and the characters, no matter how real or surreal they may be.

Set in a dystopian 2033, an asteroid had collided with Earth and it hasn't rained for 11 years. A company called Water & Power lead by the dictatorial Kesslee, seeks to take control of the worlds water supply. Whilst taking over the last known water area, he crosses and kills the boyfriend of Tank Girl, kidnaps his daughter and herself. While in captivity Kesslee tortures Tank Girl in an attempt to try and break her, but she constantly barrages him with insults which only make things worse. Tank Girl manages to escape her initial captivity with the help of Jet Girl (Naomi Watts) but realises she needs to save her boyfriends daughter, Sam and to take down Water & Power. In order to do so she must employ the help of the most feared creatures in the land, The Rippers.

The film is even more bizarre than it initially sounds as, at times it does seem all over the place and at times quite confusing. Although the overall viewing experience can be a bit exhaustive, there's no doubting that it's a definite worthwhile experience.

I personally found that the character of Kesslee played by Malcolm McDowell simply wasn't as intimidating as I found myself wanting him to be. I wanted him to be haunting and at the same time, seem genuinely evil, as it's certainly the type of character the film makers were after. Honestly the only characters that really did work were both Tank & Jet girl, their chemistry really worked when confronting the relationship between the timid Jet Girl and the open and confident Tank Girl. If it weren't for these two I would find myself completely trashing this film, but I couldn't bring myself to do it as Lori Petty simply did a superb job.",1219536000,,3059,4.474910394265233
672447,5,6303492509,"This campy cult classic keeps on delivering. Maybe parts of the sound track are stuck in the mid-90s. Despite that, the after-the-crash survivalism (a la Mad Max or Resident Evil), the evil corporate lords, and the over-the top goofiness all remain as fresh as Tank Girl's mouth.

The plot? Well, it doesn't spoil anything to say that the good guys win in the end. This movie isn't about its plot. Instead, it shows the power of brashness in its purest known form. Other high points include every change of costume (seemingly every scene), the ""pimp my ride"" approach her tank, and the conversion of a mousy mechanic into gun-slinging Jet Girl.

More than any other comic adaptation, this clings to its roots in pulp-paper print. The characters all offer the depth of the printed page they came from, true, but making everything else bigger, brighter, and ballsier than life forgives any flaws. Then the cuts from actual comic book scenes (or in the style) remind us that this was never meant to be taken seriously. On the other hand, goofiness on this scale can't come from a casual effort - this is absolutely serious light-hearted goofing.

First, some history.

I discovered this film on the Internet Movie Data Base

(IMDB.com) while searching for films that starred

Naomi Watts...star of the recent Holiday classic ""King

Kong"".  I knew she was a great actress after watching

her star with Sean Penn in ""21 Grams"", but I never

knew she was the co-star of a film entitled ""Tank

Girl"".

All you have to do is take a look at the cover of the DVD box and it makes a statement in itself.  .

It is one of the strangest, most enjoyable, offbeat

films I have ever seen.  Set in the year 2033, the

true star is Lori Petty...a solid, rigid, comedic

performance that ranks right up there with many dingy

blondes...however Lori is actually the smartest dumb

blonde I've ever seen on film.

If you just wanna have fun, see ""Tank Girl"".  It'll

completely blow you away.  There is no way I can prep

you for this film.  The box states it is a definite

4-star production and (I quote), ""This movie kicks

major butt!""  That it does!  Along with special

effects that go beyond Hollywood.  This film (coming

from a psychedelic Sixties nut like me) is a total

trip.

There are not too many films out there that I can give

a rating of 10 to without it being a box office smash,

but this unknown nugget is a must for anyone wanting

to just have fun and be blown away (literally).  Naomi

plays a naive worker that befriends Lori and they go

on a rampage of the new millennium.  No more from me.

I loved the original comic version and this should have been a fantastic film but it just ended up being a grand disappointment. I'm never sure who could have played Tank Girl but Lori Petty--too old anyway--absolutely could not play her. Other characters were so-so and the casting overall was amateurish. The directing? Well, this was probably one of the worst directed 25 million dollar movies ever. The film lacks cohesion and, more importantly, vision. One gets the impression that from the first production meeting to the last edit no one involved really knew what a Tank Girl movie should look like. It kills me that half-baked directors get jobs like these.

This film has its fans and that's not to be sniffed at; there are really no other decent ""bad girlz"" fantasy/action films out there. Just about any girl action character around now is there for the boys, not the other girlz.

672736,3,6303492509,"Ten years ago if someone had given you $25 Million dollars and challenged you make the worst flick possible with the money (stipulating that ALL the money had to actually be spent making the movie), it is unlikely that you could have deliberately matched Rachel Talaly's ""Tank Girl"". I blundered into a showing of ""Tank Girl"" during its short-lived (and basically disastrous) release and found it memorable for its comic page scene transitions (borrowed from television's ""Wonder Woman"") and its spoof of the action/adventure movie genre. Unfortunately the animation just makes you wish that the whole thing was animation while the moronic nature of all the live action scenes makes you question whether spoofing the genre was by design or by accident.

Ten years later it has some retrospective interest relative to the disparate career directions of Lori Petty and Naomi Watts. It is simply impossible to make Petty sexy; no matter how glamed-up, erotically posed, or provocatively scripted. Conversely it is impossible for Watts to not be sexy, no matter how hard they try to detune, grime-up, and disguise her.

""Tank Girl"" poses the question, why do so many people dislike it, both now and at the time of its release ten years ago? Lori Petty is the most obvious answer. Petty's basic personality embodies the most irritating qualities of Lucille Ball with none of Lucy's humor and charm. She is irritating even in her low-key roles (""A League of Their Own""). Apparently she was cast as ""Tank Girl"" for exactly that quality and Director Rachel Talaly managed to bring her full irritating potential to the screen. But the producers forgot to connect the dots before they spent $25 Million on production, irritating is sometimes good in supporting roles (insert Stiffer here) but not as the main character.

About two thirds of the way into the story Petty and Watts fall into the hands of a group of genetically engineered fellows called ""The Rippers"". At first this appears to be going in the direction of ""Dark Angel"" meets ""Captain Kangaroo"". But Talaly switches direction a bit and ends up with a post-apocalyptic version of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". For a few minutes the movie is actually a lot of fun. Then it is time to get back to the basic story, which by this time everyone (viewers, director, cast, and editor) has pretty much forgotten. This does not pose the post-production problems it does in other movies because Talaly seems committed to insuring that no element of ""suspense"" is present to distract you from Petty's irritating performance.

The Tank Girl comic strip embodied a freewheeling anti-authoritarian anarchism, with some feminist and even lesbian themes. Although Talaly faithfully captures a small amount of this spirit she fumbles big time with the basic storytelling (insert no suspense). Which is hardly a revelation given her other directorial attempts (including ""Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare"" and ""Ghost in the Machine""-arguably even worse than ""Tank Girl""). If she actually liked the comic strip she should have yielded control to a competent director or at least someone with a basic talent for directing actors and for making feature films.",1124841600,,3198,5.074144486692015

Yeah, the Rippers (aka Kangaroo people) are a little scary, but they are genetically engineered kangaroo mutants who happen to be trying to find their creator.  (I got over the Rippers scariness when Rebecca and Jet were high on helium and then doing that stupid dance.)

I think about this movie when I am down because most of the movie had me laughing my head off.  But I guess this tells you about my personality because this movie isn't for everyone.  Don't watch this movie expecting to learn anything or have a plot to follow.  Just sit back, and enjoy the cartoons...and the fact that one of the main characters is a tank!

While I didn't know this was a comic first, I'm curious to see them now.  But since I generally won't watch a movie if I've read the book, I can understand why the people that read the comic didn't like the film.  To them I have to say I'm sorry, because I still adore this cartoon/movie.  But I will admit that knowing now that this was supposed to be an Australian flick explains a lot...I always thought this had kind of a Mad Max feeling too it.

 First off, I'm a big Tank Girl fan, I know the comic's ADD-style lunatic writing, and I knew from the beginning not to expect some life-changing epiphany to arise from my viewing this movie. Unfortunately, despite my expectations being meager at best, I was still let down. For one thing, there's a coherent (muddled, but coherent) relatively straightforward storyline, something that NEVER happened in the comics.

 For another thing, the Tank Girl I knew an loved was a cranky, amoral psychopath (British/Australian). She didn't have a concious, she killed people that annoyed her and indulged in all manner of demented fun. Meanwhile, Movie Tank Girl sounds like she fell out of the Upper East Side, a gun-toting tease with a heart of gold that makes one-liners borrowed straight from TMNT.

 The movie takes itself too seriously to capture the outrageous fun of the comic (the violence and language is incredibly tepid), and instead tries to disguise directionless writing as camp.

The art of Jamie Hewlitt is present throughout various points in the film and is (as always) stunning (they often take the place of sets or transition scenes as there obviously wasn't money in the budget for them), but seems out of place. The bizarre world inside Jamie Hewlitt's head is poorly realized on the live-action sequences and makes the quick cuts from comic art to live action jarring. The animation sequences are nicely done and kind of make me wonder why they didn't just make the whole movie animated?

 I didn't enjoy Tank Girl at all, I ended up just fast forwarding through 2/3s of the movie because I just couldn't take it anymore. I took it out of the library...which I would reccommend for anyone who shows any interest in viewing it (it's barely worth rental money).

 Pros:
 -Hewlitt's art is awesome
 -Animation sequences are fun and well-done
 -Ice-T dressed up as a kangaroo

 Cons:
 -Everything else.

 If you do end up getting it and watching it, I would reccommend, beforehand, either getting stoned or consuming a large amount of alcohol. I did neither, and I think if I had I would've enjoyed it more.",1091577600,10,2139,4.875346260387811

Not even close.  ""Tank Girl"" is not about quality, it's about attitude, and Lori Petty has attitude to boot.  Her constant puns and jokes could come off as annoying, like they do in the Batman movies, which have ended up aging about as well as milk, but Petty really pulls it off, with her Gwen Stefani style, dirty mouth, and a seemingly endless stream of energy.
Plot (not like it matters) is as follows: 2033, there's nothing but endless sand.  There's even a shortage of water!  All that's left is in the hands of a huge, evil corporation.  So, as it has been and always will be, wherever there's power, there's protest.  Tank girl and her friends are out to bring down the company, but a surprise attack forces Tank Girl alone to go up against all of her oppressors.

 As a film, I give it 4 stars. There are some visible flaws in production value (dispite the enormous ""tongue-in-cheek"" factor) That sort of cheapen the film. One prime example is the ""ripper"" claws, used to sever limb from body, flopping around like rubber... ...claws in closeups. But that's picky stuff. The animation sequences, mostly used to speed up the explanation of extranious details, are actually top notch and enhance the let-it-fly attitude of the movie. Hard core Sci-fi/Comic fans don't give this film much due (at least the ones I know). I told them I had ""Tank Girl"" and they just groaned.

-I bought this movie in the Comedy section at [...]!
-Dispite it's zany, spastic attitude, Tank Girl is good Sci-fi.
-The first time I watched the DVD, I was totally entertained.
-Don't expect anything to make allot of sense. This is spastic comedy in the tradition of ""the Monkeys"" (yea, the TV show!!).
-Dispite this, there is actually a cool, simple story with emotional attachment to the characters.
-Special effects are pretty slick.
-If you know this film, kind of like it, but aren't sure you want to own it, you can get it new for cheap.
-Don't expect realistic machinery. Paint often changes vehicles structural makeup in this film (I.E., long wings become short and move down, and then back up again!!)

But like other reviewers, I am quite, quite disappointed in the DVD version of this film.  From the trenches you hear grumblings that there was a lot of edited stuff that COULD HAVE been put on the DVD.  Why don't DVD makers do more than reprint what we already have on video for us to (silly consumers we sometimes are) just rush out to buy anyway?  The picture quality of the DVD is not significantly higher than that of the video-- the only real bonus is that you can do still pauses and get some cool screen shots for that conference paper presentation you're doing... There is nothing more than the video on this DVD.  Not even any nifty ""Making of Tank Girl"" footage, or sketches of other rejected cartoon scenes, or whatever!  Even an oldie/goodie Cherry 2000 has more than this one, and surely the DVD makers could have done better.
I'll just hope that Men In Black is correct, and someday, when we get the next alien form of media (I guess I'll have to buy the White album again) the next makers of whatever futuristic thing we'll all have to rush out and buy will heed this advice-- put more on your big media!

672917,3,6303492509,"""Tank Girl"" isn't a sci-fi epic that plays it straight.  In ""Girl"" Rebecca struggles to survive on an Earth ravaged by collision with a comet in 2020 (uh oh, that's not too far down the way...) and hasn't seen a day of rain since.  Much of the power is held by the corporate fascists of ""Water Power"".  Some shadowy mutants (called Rippers) challenge WP directly, but most like Rebecca (Lori Petty, the Tank Girl of the title) just try to keep to themselves, survive on their own without going insane.
Though it starts with one of the oldest premises in the history of sci-fi films, books and comics (a lone hero or band takes on a corrupt larger power in a post apocalyptic setting) ""Girl"" quickly becomes less a movie than a ""motion comic book"".  (In many scenes, the film uses comic art to document the action.)Rebecca is a flighty type - into old movies (starring Doris Day), songs (later on, she forces the evil Madam to sing Cole Porter's ""Let's Make Love"") and just about everything that had been pre-modern before civilization was destroyed.  Captured by WP, Rebecca is used as bait by the evil WP Boss, to lure in the ""Rippers"".  The evil WP boss, Keslee (Malcom McDowell using his tried&true evil routine) knows that the Rippers (who tear through WP installations as if they didn't exist) are his only obstacles to total power.  Unfortunately, the bait works better than the trap - the Rippers appear, but destroy all the WP troops and severely injure Keslee.  Rebecca is freed, and stealing one of WP's tanks, sets off across the desert to reunite with her commune and revenge herself against WP.  Ofcourse, being Rebecca, nothing she does is straight - requiring her to dress her tank up much as she's costumed herself.  With the help of ""Jet Girl"" (the always satisfying Naomi Watts), Rebecca tears up the terrain and seems to have a lot of fun.  Unfortunately, Keslee remains alive and figures a way to use Rebecca to bring the Rippers to him - again.
I guess they realized thay had to go the glam route because ""Girl"" had such a derivative story.  Unfortunately, the movie doesn't really know how to turn Rebecca's flamboyance into a story in itself.  Lori Petty gets some cool zingers (her own face is a special effect - as in the scene when she first sees her tank, played against the theme to ""Shaft""), but the script decides against trying to be both funny and exciting at the same time.  This is one of those films that makes perfect sense until it's over.  By the time the credits are rolling, you're probably asking yourelf ""what the....?""",1022803200,,2561,4.634955752212389

This film is a sci-fi-post-apocalypse-post-holocaust-feminist-action-adventure-coming-of-age-comedy, so naturally it was destined to cult-hood!  Good!  It belongs on the list of great cult films!
What makes this film so great?  It is off-beatness.  Great casting.  Killer sets and special effects.  Lucas said that behind every sci-fi story is a human story.  Tank Girl, part of the folk on the fringes of a post-apocalyptic society, is motivated by the murder of her lover by the Water and Power Corp, sort of a 1984-Brazilesque mega-conglomerate that controls electricity and water processing.  Imagine Hitler running your local utilities.  Isn't that Mr. C. Montgomery Burns?
Another aspect is the opposing tension between Tank Girl and Kesslee, which reminds us of Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter from ""Silence of the Lambs"": male-female, old-young, strong-weak, rich-poor, experienced-naive, sociopath-sane, boring-fun. And behind it is a subtle sexual tension-though, gladly it is never realized.
To their credit, they adapted the underground comic correctly to the screen, and you even see quick animated excerpts from the comic as links between the scenes.  The Mask, Mystery Men, and The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles helped pave the way for this, and of course the godfathers of all comic-to-movie metamorphoses are Batman and Superman.

Lori Petty's character is perfectly witty, a girl who plays it large and in charge even when things are at their worst. She can kill an armed man and then answer the irritated stares of his buddies with ""What?"" While McDowell's character tries to break her in for a mission, she spends all her time coming up with lines to really get under his skin--and succeeds.
The complaints of some accusing McDowell of hamming up the role of the villain are unfounded; he not only plays the role perfectly, but does it so well that I don't think anyone else could have done it. He's playing the stereotypical megalomaniac bad guy, yes, but on top of that he adds a touch of class and intelligence. His repartee with Tank Girl proves he's nearly a match for her wit with flippant remarks. He's a very bright guy with an ingenious solution to an ongoing problem, who's simply flummoxed by the dauntlessly rude spirit of his opponent. McDowell is brilliant enough as an actor to get all these characteristics across. Bravo.
The plot gives us a nice, reasonable adventure without being overly simplistic; the campy tone prevents it from getting any more complex. The off-the-wall antics of Tank Girl bleed over at times from the character to the movie itself, which gets a bit goofy (in a good way) in parts where you'd never otherwise expect it to. In the middle of the film they break into a musical number in the silliest of venues--it might not be logical but it's a whole lot of fun. All this is carried along by a soundtrack pretty well suited to the film, arranged appropriately enough by Courtney Love.

It is fact that they taped at least another half hour to an hour of footage that is not going to make the dvd, which is sad. (they even messed up and put pictures from these scenes in the trading card set) If you can get passed that Get the DVD!
Even if you are not familiar with the comic book, this is a female empowerment, ""riot grrrl"" movie. Tankie Fears NOTHING! If you like movies with female strong leads and a wacky sence of humor this is it! No tears for this one. This is like Boys on the side and Beaches for a younger minded audience without all that pesky death to veil your judgment.
When I went to the movies I did not think Lori Petty could pull off Tank Girl, but it was a nice surprise to watch her. Petty Captured Tank Girl by the Bullocks! Naomi Watts as Jet Girl and Malcolm McDowell as Kesslee were great in it as well. Don't let the critics feed you a line of bull on this one. <b> INSTANT cult classic</B> Just because there is no HUGE life lesson in this, it should not take away from this lighthearted movie. Sometimes all you want to do is press play and enjoy, not rattle your brain.  If you have the mentality to like the bands on the soundtrack (Bjork, Hole, Joan Jett, L7, Portishead, Stomp, etc.) you will LOVE this movie..... stop reading and go get it!

I'd never call this ""quality cinema,"" but it is thoroughly entertaining, and quickly became one of my favorite movies.  The color is breath-taking, Lori Petty is absoltuely beautiful, sexy, funny, wonderful, etc.  And this is just a kick-a#$% grrrl-power movie, without the corporate cheese that tends to come in the package.  It is a fantasy world that i ventured to often as a teenager... and now with a DVD version, the journey can continue. ENJOY!",983664000,19,545,4.705263157894737
673023,3,6303492509,"This movie is the perfect comic book turned film.  Rachel Talalay knew when she was creating this, that it was merely just a comic book and didn't try to make it anything more by adding some redeaming social content or anything.  The film looks just like a comic book.  What else can I say? Lori Petty is hot and the movie had Malcom Mcdowell in it.  The DVD on the other hand is another matter.  There are no extras.  I wanted commentaries or deleted scenes or a featurette or at least something.",981936000,2,497,4.3478260869565215

It's also one of the funniest things i've seen in ages with the humour pouring from it!
I was however sad to hear that many scenes had been cut from the film and that a DVD would never be released. I started up an internet protest to get MGM to release it on DVD with the footage and here it is! This DVD is out due to the fans who protested for it!
I am still angry that have not included ANY extras or the cut footage and after much arguing with MGM i don't think they ever will replace the footage!  Anyway check out [...] to see what bits they have not included on this disk and sign our online from to try to get them to put more stuff on the disk! theres still time!!",981763200,9,802,3.950617283950617
673115,3,6303492509,"Tank Girl (played convincingly by Lori Petty)is a fun grrrl action film.
Although the theme is supposed to be about human survival after a major geological/metorlogical nuclearish disaster, it pokes gender, and  class relations.
A handfull of rich white men control the world's water  supply with millitary force and apparently spend much of their leisure time  at a girle club where all of the women (unsuprisingly) are altered to look  alike) The women who ultimately engineer the saving idea are punkish  (anarcha-feminists? ) who defy society expectations of what is appropriate  for women.
Even though the graphic juxtapositions seem to be a cheap  imitation of the comic book/reality style pioneered so well in the 1960's  Batman TV series, and Ice T's inclusion in the cast, it is still a good  story line.
I've seen this movie several times, and even though she is  much less of a cultural compromise than Buffy (who also saves the world,  but looks more conventional)Tank Girl rocks. When the movie came out, I was  actually planning to streak my hair fushcia in homage to this great  character.
The soundtrack (produced by Courtney Love) is also worth  getting!",963619200,13,1171,5.03125

I suggest you watch Out Of Africa instead. I always get my money's worth when I see  this film and by the way I am quite a bit older then 25!  I loved it just  as much the second time and even caught more of the snappy, firecracker  dialogue that constantly spews with irreverance and grit from the main  character, played unabashedly by Lori Petty. A must see is the stunningly  classic spoof of a traditional '40's show tune which occurs about half way  through the film.
