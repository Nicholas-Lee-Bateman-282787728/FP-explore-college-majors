8297132,4,B001E904YS,"Judge Ben `Fair and Square' Wiley, founder of the small Texas town of Wileyville, rescued two orphans from a burned out wagon train.  Not knowing the children's names, Wiley gave him monikers based on their personalities, hence the boy became Buffalo Bill Jr. because of his fearlessness and riding skills and his young sister was named Calamity Jane, because of her ability to stir up trouble.

Buffalo Bill Jr. was played by Dick Jones, had been a popular child actor in the movies and on radio in the 1930s and 40s.  His most famous role was provided the voice for Disney's ""Pinocchio"".  After World War II, he graduated to adult roles and became a frequent co-star in Gene Autry's films and television programs and co-starred in another Flying `A' produced series called ""The Range Rider"" with super-stuntman Jock Mahoney.  An outstanding horseman and all-round athlete, Jones performed many of his stunts.  The other series regulars were Nancy Gilbert who played Calamity and verteran character actor Harry Cheshire who protrayed Judge Wiley.
