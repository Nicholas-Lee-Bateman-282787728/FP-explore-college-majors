8699835,5,B00SYFIDWA,I felt transported back in time to when I was just a little girl when I watched this.  I had not seen this program in something like thirty-five years!  I certainly never thought I would ever see it again.  Even Foxtel has never shown this series on Boomerang.  I hope to see further episodes released soon.  The product was of good quality and fantastic value.,1410134400,3,361,4.492307692307692
