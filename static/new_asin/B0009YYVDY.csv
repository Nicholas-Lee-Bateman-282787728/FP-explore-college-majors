2343894,5,B0009YYVDY,"This is my second workout dvd in the Power Half Hour Series and this one didn't let me down either.  Tony Horton brings it right away with squats, sitting up and down in a chair ( who knew that the mere act of sitting and getting up repeatedly would help tone your buns? ) floor work, which includes various back leg extensions and hydrants.  There's also a part with walking lunges, which reminded me a bit of a Monty Python skit I saw years ago, where the guy walked with really long strides.  It made me chuckle, yet I felt the burn.  Tony Horton is a fun instructor showing you the moves, and also as your personal trainer, he stops and points out what is the correct posture / moves on his two fellow companions.  Tony also does combination moves, which make your muscles work twice as hard, giving you better results.  I can not say enough good things about Tony Horton and his workouts.  He's so much fun with his comments and voices, and is a great motivator.  No fancy sets or gimmicks, just a great 30 minute workout.",1240444800,11,1027,4.368421052631579
2343895,4,B0009YYVDY,"I have been walking 3 miles a day now for over 2 months plus have gone through Debbie Siebers' Phase 1 Start it Up! & Phase 2 Ramp it Up! and was wanting to throw in something new as I can't seem to make the jump to Phase 3 Burn it Up! and am getting tired of the monotony. So I tried some of the 10 Minute Solution videos and didn't like them & decided to give Tony a shot as I do tend to like the BeachBody series. It's definitely no-frills, and if you want a pretty set & polished people, this isn't it. But he does give 30 solid minutes of work out, and I didn't find him annoying like some. I liked the fact he switched the exercises often enough you don't get exhausted in one area & then he'll come back after letting you do something else. You definitely feel it when you're done, but I was surprised the 30 minutes went by so quickly! It's fast-paced and energetic and for the first time since I started rebuilding my old long-lost muscles I ended to find my legs trembling under me. I had that the first time I picked up Debbie's Phase 1 but not since, and it was GREAT to feel I'd pushed myself that hard - and without realizing it at the time! The only reason I knocked off a star is there's a couple of moves (like the high-step lunges) that seem like they could injure you fairly easily. I tend to have a little trouble with my knees from time to time and I felt a little twinge - but it's not that hard to just do regular lunges for a while till they finish doing those. (Also, not so important - it does bug me a little when the people doing these videos keep stopping to see how their sidekicks are doing - keep sweating out there with us!!) I'm looking forward to his Power Half Hour Thigh video I have on order, and I plan on ordering the ab video too.",1190678400,11,1771,4.048433048433049

8070695,4,B0009YYVDY,"I like this and the other four of this series.  I'm just getting into it.  I've come to the conclusion that tho I was originally only doing abs & strengths, for a very long time, adding stretches, bun shaper and thigh trimmer, more recently, completes a well rounded workout, which I'm already seeing better results than in the past with just the two.  Duh!  The workouts aren't for beginners, but if one has been doing other workouts for 45mins. to 1hr., they should be able to do them.  There challenging, but nothing like the P90X, P90X2, & P90X3, which are extreme workouts.",1433721600,,578,4.627450980392157

8070698,5,B0009YYVDY,"This power half hour bun shaper is a great work out for people like myself. I am not to activity, but active enough. It made me sweat and I enjoyed the workout. The instructor encourages you all the way. Get ready to sweat!.  Item delivered as promised.",1396396800,2,253,4.382978723404255

8070700,4,B0009YYVDY,"What can I say, it's Tony Horton! His dvds are so much fun..and the important part,
you still get a GREAT workout. Some exercise instructors are way too serious, whereas,
Tony make it a joy to exercise.",1379635200,2,202,4.486486486486487
8070701,4,B0009YYVDY,Workout is good but I don't feel that it works the area good enough. Some exercises seem too easy. I don't feel a good burn by the time I'm finished.,1366243200,,149,4.0
8070702,5,B0009YYVDY,I had the whole Power Half Hour series on one dvd. It got broken and I loved it so much that I wanted to get them individually! It is a great target workout and perfect for days when you can't get to the gym or outside for a run!,1365379200,2,229,3.693877551020408
