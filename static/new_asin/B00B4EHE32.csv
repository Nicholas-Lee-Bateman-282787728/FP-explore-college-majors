8562228,2,B00B4EHE32,"I have practiced yoga off and on almost 20 years. I still need instructors who provide helpful cueing, reminders, etc., as I am at an intermediate level on a good day (and I'm 60 now). This instructor, though very well-meaning, appeared, at first, to approach this instruction in that manner, but as it went along he seemed to just really get into his own experience doing this DVD. If a DVD workout is any good, you should not have to repeatedly look at your screen, especially if you have experience in what you're being guided through on that DVD. This DVD is old school in that you're left to keep up as the instructor moves through the workout, giving vague instructions. You should NEVER have to do that learning or brushing up on yoga at home any more! And Kripalu, the maker of this DVD, should know better! The Kripalu leaders, back in the day, were instrumental in providing excellent cueing and instruction in their yoga DVDs! This DVD should not have been released, especially under the Kripalu name. I recommend Alan Finger and Travis Eliot yoga instruction for the best and most thorough beginning and ongoing yoga practice.",1378771200,3,1138,4.723618090452261
