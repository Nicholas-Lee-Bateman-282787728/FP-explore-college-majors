5026206,5,B006WX0DOW,Bought the set of Series 1 and it was hilarious. Have to watch it on my computer as it is UK but it is so funny. Had to buy series 2 when I saw it. This guy is hilarious. Like Mrs. Doubtfire but better because it's continuous.,1362355200,,226,3.8297872340425534
5026207,5,B006WX0DOW,Love BBC! It is a shame US television wouldn't be able to show this on anything but cable. Great show!,1362096000,3,102,4.15
5026208,5,B006WX0DOW,"There's no funnier show I've ever seen.  It's funny, clever, fast-paced worth every penny and trouble to find a source -- Has to play on Region 2 player or adjust your computer DVD -- to play it in this country.  Mrs. Brown and her family will keep you belly-laughing throughout!  Highly reccommend it for a great time!",1359158400,,319,4.56140350877193
5026209,5,B006WX0DOW,THIS SERIES IS AN ABSOLUTE SCREAM!  I'VE PURCHASED THE 1ST 2 SEASONS AND CAN'T WAIT FOR THE 3RD.  THE CHRISTMAS SPECIAL 2012 WAS ALSO VERY GOOD.  IF YOU WANT A GOOD LAUGH MRS. BROWN DELIVERS.,1357689600,6,191,4.4
5026211,2,B006WX0DOW,The funny parts are too far apart.,1408579200,,34,4.0
5026212,1,B006WX0DOW,"It will not play on USA DVD player as stated, HOWEVER, IT ALSO WILL NOT PLAY ON MY TWO RECENT PCS WITH BLU RAY PLAYERS. Comments by reviewers indicated it was playable on PC. That was not the case for me.

Company is kind enough to give me refund. However, they are deducting 20% because DVD was opened. THE DVD PACKET WAS OPENED WHEN I RECEIVED IT.

I love Mrs. Brown but in the future will only buy them if they are playable on USA DVD player.",1406505600,,445,4.103448275862069
5026213,5,B006WX0DOW,Funniest situation comedy ever - and it's from Brittain!!,1406332800,,57,5.444444444444445
5026214,5,B006WX0DOW,"Great and funny, to bad its gone.",1404259200,,33,3.857142857142857
5026215,5,B006WX0DOW,I freaking love this show and I can not get enough of it! I live in the US and it is a UK (Region 2) dvd so it won't play in a standard DVD player - you need a multi region or newer laptop in order to watch in the US- I am able to watch the DVD in my Samsung Laptop (2 years old) - This show makes me laugh so hard it hurts,1399420800,,323,3.32
5026216,5,B006WX0DOW,"Well package when it came, love love it and cant stop laughing, I think its worth the money, you cant beat enjoyment like this for the price.",1393977600,,141,4.2592592592592595
5026217,5,B006WX0DOW,This came super quick and in good packaging. This show is the funniest thing I have seen in a long time I highly recommend it. Hysterical.,1392595200,,138,4.346153846153846
5026218,5,B006WX0DOW,"Good fun with lots of laughs.  Brendan O'Carroll does it again.  Put on your ""silly glasses"" to watch.  Highly recommended.",1391040000,,123,5.05
5026219,5,B006WX0DOW,"Although Mrs. Brown's Boys is full of off-color words, sexual innuendo, and profanity, there is no nudity. Seriously, this is the funniest comedy series I have ever seen. If you need a good laugh and don't have children around while you watch this, Mrs. Brown will have you rolling on the floor with her gut splitting antics.

The DVDs are in PAL format, so you will have to have them translated to NTSC format to watch them, or you will need to buy a multi-region player.  If you like the other British comedies seen on PBS, you will adore Agnes Brown and you will find yourself saying, ""That's nice!""",1390694400,,602,4.513761467889908
5026220,5,B006WX0DOW,"Mrs. Brown's boys is totally hilarious and definitely not for children. This is a Region 2 DVD and can NOT be played on most U.S.A. DVD players. If you don't know if you have a REGION FREE DVD player, then don't order because it will NOT play.",1390435200,,243,4.191489361702128
5026231,5,B006WX0DOW,Best DVD EVER!!!  We laugh until our sides hurt.  I want all of them!  Highly recommend ALL the Mrs. Brown's Boys DVDs.,1388448000,,119,4.318181818181818
5026232,1,B006WX0DOW,I love the show from what I seen on you tube. However this will not play on anything that is not a multi- function player.,1387065600,,122,3.92
5026233,5,B006WX0DOW,"The TV show ""Mrs Brown's Boys"" came in the mail today....
I have never laughed so hard, for so long in my life. We plan to play one show every Saturday so we can span out the fun as long as possible.

If your in the USA or Canada, Be sure to have a  ""zone free"" DVD player that can also convert the UK's PAL format to US NTSC format .... I found one on Amazon for under $ 50.00 US.

5026236,5,B006WX0DOW,I saw only clips of the show on You Tube and Facebook at first and roared with laughter.  I  like to watch British comedys on PBS or on BBC America and this Irish comedy is like a british comedy on steriods.  I knew It was unlikely to be seen on American television because of the strong language that might bother some and would not be for the young.  ( Bet they know all the words anyway.)  You need to buy a multi-region DVD player and a plug adapter to watch the DVDs.  For me it was money well spent and many of my friends and family enjoy Mrs. Brown's Boys.,1373241600,,563,4.072727272727272

I live in America and NO American sitcom has ever compared to the hilarity and wit of this great show! I've even purchased an all region DVD player so I can purchase all series of the show.
