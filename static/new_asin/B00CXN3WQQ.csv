8587289,5,B00CXN3WQQ,"HILARIOUS! ALTHOUGH I AM NOT COMPLETELY UNBIASED BECAUSE MY BROTHER, RO BROOKS, HAS A SMALL ROLE IN THIS MOVIE. IT FOLLOWS THE TREND OF RECENT GOSPEL-BASED PLAYS/MOVIES. GREAT STORY LINE, WELL KNOWN ACTORS, AND LOTS OF HUMOR MAKES IT A GREAT FAMILY MOVIE. I WOULD WATCH IF MY BROTHER WASN'T IN IT. ACTUALLY, MY MOM FAILED TO INFORM ME ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE WHEN SHE INSISTED I WATCH IT WITH HER. MY DAUGHTER  RECOGNIZED HE UNCLE IMMEDIATELY.",1423180800,,440,4.7894736842105265
