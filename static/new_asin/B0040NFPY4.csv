8412418,4,B0040NFPY4,"Great documentary, even included the usually neglected China-Burma-India theater, American influence on Japanese culture during occupation, and some of the independence movements after WWII ended.

I wish they included all the eps on the Korean War. The last ep: Korean War, ended with saying the next ep was on the Chinese attacks in the war. It feels incomplete without the ending of the Korean War. This is why I gave it 4/5 stars.",1325203200,,434,4.945205479452055
