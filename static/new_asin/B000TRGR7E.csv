8210463,4,B000TRGR7E,"Being a Ned's Atomic Dustbin fan since about 1990, I would just like to say that I am really looking forward to hearing the new album that keeps getting hinted at on this DVD.  ""Hibernation"" is a great new single, as well as its B-Side.  What is a rabid fan to do though?  I have liked the new DVD's very much and the live show on CD and rehash of studio material on the box set, as well as all of their past films (which I think should also see a rerelease on DVD of course), B-Sides, Collects, and of course Albums and Singles.  I would really like to see a return to glory by Ned's Atomic Dustbin, and of course, also a return to California.  :P  One of the best ""hidden"" bands that still exists.  My friends I went to high school with are also big fans.  It's funny, it seems they were everyone's ""secret"" favorite band.  :)  As for the DVD, it is an interesting look with not as much madness as ""Nothing is Cool"", yet shows the band has aged well (if at all) and of course what everybody already knows, that they are still relevant and sounding great, oh yeah, and even Blink-182 likes them, so you should too.  ;)  8/10",1184544000,6,1125,4.181395348837209
