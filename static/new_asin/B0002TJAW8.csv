8031659,5,B0002TJAW8,Poorly acted campy movie.  Entertaining from that point of view though.,1450396800,,71,5.454545454545454
8031660,1,B0002TJAW8,"I can't believe that the other two reviews here are positive.  Can you imagine being a kid in 1962 and running out to your neighborhood theater to see something called The Creation of the Humanoids, only to find out that it's just a talkfest?  I mean literally.  These folks stand around and talk . . . and talk . . . and talk.  This movie makes Meet the Press look like Die Hard.  It would be a camp classic if only it weren't such a sleep aid.",1413676800,,445,4.068965517241379
8031661,5,B0002TJAW8,"I am judging this movie for the time and place it appeared -- 1962. A great 1962 sci-fi gem that addresses racism.  It's brilliance include using the euphemism ""Clickers"" as a vulgarly to describe the so-called inhuman robots, right down to the ""confederate hat"" wearing group that calls themselves by another euphemism ""order of the flesh and blood brotherhood."" Now, in the year 2013, these types of people still exist. We still have the confederate flag flying Aryan Brotherhood, who insist on subterfuge at the cost of the lives of other human beings. Most of them won't understand a word I've typed.

I also have to add there is a brilliant sub-text to the movie, which goes into a philosophical dialog regarding what makes a man human. I don't know if medically we knew what the amygdala and thalamus did in 1962, but the discussion of this part of machine which made it human (the almond shaped thing in the brain), made this movie phenomenal and way ahead of it's counterparts. Too bad the producers didn't have more money, as this could have been a cult classic that everyone would be talking about today.",1381276800,,1114,4.737113402061856
8031662,4,B0002TJAW8,"Despite being shot on an obviously microscopic budget, this film manages to convey an otherwordly mood, thus facilitating the willing suspension of disbelief. The sets and costumes are often silly or ridiculous, and there are no spectacular battles, explosions, or space flights. Nonetheless, the creators, cast and crew turned out an interesting and thought-provoking story.

A few dollars were wisely spent obtaining the services of make-up virtuoso Jack Pierce, of Frankenstein fame, who created a subtle yet effective look for the androids, a look that quietly reinforces themes. The androids are simultaneously different, and yet the same, as humans.

Besides the make-up, the other star of this film is the intelligent script. The dialogue and plot nicely mirror the rationalizations and machinations of hate groups anywhere and anytime, but must have seemed very close to home as the hate crimes of the early 1960's were unfolding.

This film is obviously a parable about tolerance and the human condition, which of course was a subject much discussed in 1962. What is most striking to me now is not so much the thesis of racial/religious tolerance, but that this film goes farther, being also a plea for sexual tolerance.",1276905600,3,1229,5.228426395939087
