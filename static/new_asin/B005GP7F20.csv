4692939,1,B005GP7F20,I bought this based on other reviews and regret buying this Dvd. The graphics are amazing but the story line is filled with reincarnation. If you don't want your kids believing in reincarnation then I don't recommend this movie. I was hoping for a Sherlock Holmes type ending where a the very least the supernatural would be explained away but it wasn't. I would give this movie a 5 for Animation but a 1 for the story.,1322956800,6,419,4.454545454545454
4692940,4,B005GP7F20,"Rarely are the words ""video game"" and ""movie"" put together in the same sentence positively. Whether it's because of creative differences, unintersested studios, lack of funding, or other problems, films based on video games have seldom done well. Sure, movies like Prince of Persia and Mortal Kombat were valiant atempts, but we still have garbage like Super Mario Brothers and Alone in the Dark. This begs the question: Do good video game movies exist? Based on the bestselling Nintendo DS games by Level 5, Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva dares to answer this question. Originally released as a theatrical film in Japan back in 2009, Eternal Diva has finally washed upon our shores as a direct-to-video release. Is it worth checking out? Or is this simply another doomed failure? Let's take a look at this carefully.

The Movie
If you're unfamilier with the Professor Layton series, here's a quick rundown. The Layton video games are basically puzzle games mixed with the adventure game genre. Each game combines a well-written story with hundreds of devious puzzles ranging from math problems to trick questions. How could any of this translate into a film? This is where the games' signature art style comes in. Throughout the games, are cut-scenes that feature beautiful art along with top-notch voice acting. Level 5 obviously saw potential in these cutscenes, so they greenlighted development of this film shortly after the release of the first two games. Unfortunatly, it would take two long years before the film arrived overseas from Japan.

Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva stars a professor of archeology named Hershel Layton who is also a mild-mannered and quick-witted tea-loving gentleman. The whole film is basically a long flashback in which Layton and his young apprentice Luke Triton remnicence about one of their earliest adventures. The flashback deals with the professor recieving a letter from his former student, Janice Quatlane. She invites Layton and Luke to see her perform at a high-class opera known as the Crown Petone. However, strange occurences have been happening. Girls have been disapearing from London and Janice suspects that the opera's writer, Oswald Whistler, is somehow behind it. Oswald lost his daughter, Melina, to a rare disease and adopted a new one sometime later. Janice believes that Oswald's daughter is actually his deceased daughter brought back to life. When Professor Layton and Luke arrive at the opera, the entire theater breaks away and a mystery man informs the audience that they are to play a game for eternal life. The losers however, will forfit their own lives. Does this ""eternal life"" exist? How is Oswald Whistler involved in all of this? Is his daughter really alive? These are the questions that Professor Layton must answer througout the course of the movie.

And that's pretty much the story in a nutshell. Is the film worth your time? Well it depends on who you are. If you're a veteran Layton fan like me, then I recommend you check it out. It features the same voice actors, music, and art as the games so it would be a no-brainer to give the film a try. For people who have never played the Layton games, than I'm not so sure. There are several references to the games that most would not understand, plus the film takes place in-between the fourth and fifth games, so people will likely be lost at certain points. The film also presents a couple of puzzles just like the ones in the games. There not nearly as difficult, but they give the audience a chance to solve them while Layton is thinking. If there are any problems, then it would probably be the ending. The movie starts off surprisingly strong, but the last act becomes so convolted it weakens the film. It isn't a bad ending per se, just a little unrelistic. Nevertheless, I view Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva as probably the best video game film I have ever seen. I won't lie and say that its a perfect film, but the movie is full of the same charm and wit as the games and always puts a simle on my face when I watch it. Professor Layton has proven that there is still hope for video game movies and that it is possible to not just make a good video game movie, but one that's a good movie period.
9 out of 10.

Picture and Audio
The picture quality on Eternal Diva is simply amazing. It actually almost looks like Blu-Ray quality. The animation is sharp, virbrant, and colorful. This is probably the film's strongest point, but it is ocassionly marred by akward 3-D CG. 2-D animation just simply wasn't meant to mesh with 3-D graphics. Another problem is that the entire film is presented in fullscreen and has become a major problem for a lot of the DVDs that I own. If your going to make it fullscreen, at least give us the option to switch to widescreen. The audio is good for the most part as well. With a title like Eternal Diva, music is an important part for the whole film. Thankfully, composer Tomohitio Nishiuria has provided an enjoyable soundtrack just like the games. While the DS soundtracks were good in their own right, the songs were often compresed because of the lower DS sound quality. With Eternal Diva, this is no longer an issue. A live orchestra was used to record all of the music and it sounds simply beautiful. I should also give special praise to the Japanese vocal songs sung by Nana Mizuki. The voice acting also uses all of the same voice actors from the games. Christopher Miller is perfect for Layton, giving him that soft and gentle voice that suites the English gentleman. Luke Triton, on the other hand, is annoying as ever. What makes matters worse, is that they use the British voice actress of Luke as opposed to the US one. The US one was annoying, but the British one is ten times more so. Thankfully, Viz Media included the original Japanese dub with English subtitles. Although both versions are good, I recommend the Japanese version over the American one.
8/10

Extras and Packaging
Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva comes in a standard black jewel case and is a single disc release. Inside is a paper insert advertising The Legend of Zelda manga (which I own) and the Pokemon movies. Strangely, there is no chapter list. As for extras, there are none. This is a huge shame. Why couldn't they show some behind the scenes footage or perhaps a retrospective of the whole series? There's not even a trailer for the movie itself! It's not like none of this material exists, either. Both the Japanese version (which has been out for two years) and the European version (which has been out for one year) feature some bonus features and there is no excuse as to why these weren't ported over to the American version. There are two promos for the other Layton games, but those can only be viewed before the film menu comes up.
1/10

The Bottom Line
If you're looking for a video game film that's actually GOOD then look no further. Although not a perfect film, Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva is an enjoyable experience that no other video game adaption has been able to pull off. It's a shame that no extras were included, but at least we get the film in the first place. The Professor Layton series has already spawned five games (one is only in Japan, and more are on the way) and shows no signs of slowing down. I personally can't wait for the next movie and I recommend that you at least rent this one. The puzzle of good video game movies has finally been answered. As Professor Layton says, ""No puzzle is without an answer.""

4692941,5,B005GP7F20,"Absolutely Incredible. Awe-Inspiring. Breathtaking. All of these words describe how truly incredible this movie is. As a Professor Layton fan, I had to order this movie. I was hoping that it would be amazing, because no other video-game movies have impressed me yet. But this did not disappoint. With perfect voice-acting, incredible animation, amazing story and characters, beautiful music, and wonderful incorporation of puzzles, it is not possible that this movie could not impress you. Truly the best movie ever.",1321574400,,516,5.4625
4692942,2,B005GP7F20,"This movie had its moments where it was entertaining, and even captured a bit of the magic of the games - there were 4 puzzles (they were even introduced as ""puzzle 0-0-1"" and such forth) that did just this.  Those were some of the most entertaining moments of the entire movie.  The intro was drawn out and had me want to turn it off, luckily those feelings subsided once they reached their location of where the mystery would begin.  The inspector was entertaining in a slapstick sort of way; most importantly was he wasn't annoying.  When the ending came there were just illogical actions happening and not a relevant way for the viewer to ""solve"" the case as Professor Layton might.  The mix of the animation didn't settle well with me, in some areas you would notice some beautiful CGI items in the background then the harsh (in comparison to the CGI rendering) drawings of the characters - it just didn't match.  I looked at my watch 4 times while watching this movie (no, I'm not taking medication and had no appointment to be at) just to gauge how much longer it was going to be until it was over.  I bought into the hype of the initial reviews and that was my fault.  25-30 minutes of entertainment over a period of a 90 minute movie is not a formula for a good movie in my book.

FYI - there is no menu for this movie, it is only the movie (and of course, an advert for the Professor Layton games).  The beginning minutes will have you wondering why you're seeing Japanese subtitles and being perplexed when you check your DVD player's subtitle menu show that you have ""none"" selected - these will subside after the movie gets past the opening scenes (about 7-10 minutes).

Bottom Line, Professor Layton games - Good (Great actually, some of the best gaming to be had on the DS), Professor Layton Movie - not so much.",1321315200,4,1827,4.47289156626506
4692943,5,B005GP7F20,"From activeAnime.com

The first movie based on the popular Nintendo DS games is fairly true to the vein of the games it is adapted from. Although the first minute starts of a bit confusing as it begins more like a promo than a film, it quickly falls into a formulaic story. A girl and longtime friend of Layton and his sidekick Luke has arrived in town. An opera diva, she needs their help. Mysterious circumstances are occurring at the opera theatre she performs at and Layton has a nasty hunch that the recent missing girls may be connected to it.

Sure enough, Layton is correct. He and a cast of eccentric characters become part of a challenge to find the legendary ambrosia - the elixir of eternal youth. Each has their own reasons for wanting it, but as the puzzles become harder, the consequences more deadly, soon only a few remain. Between careening boats, a pack of mind-controlled wolves and a booby-trapped castle, it will take all of Layton's mental might and Luke's bravery to see through the red herrings to the nefarious plan hidden within.

The movie tells a good yarn. It is creative, particularly visually with the opera theater, the boat, and later the castle and strange inventions that come into play. The movie, like the games, contains mental puzzles to sort out. The film is narrated by young Luke throughout the movie, a bit too much at times as it is not always necessary, but I think it is likely to keep it along the lines of the original games. The twists at the end were well done with some heartfelt moments included.

The animation was an interesting juxtaposition of very detailed backgrounds scenes and overly simplified character designs. Again this is like the game but the almost drab look to the characters is unfortunate though understandably necessary to keep them looking like they do in the game. At the same time P.A. Works (Canaan, Angel Beats!), the studio that produced the animation, had some intriguing designs to the creative aspects like the theatre and inventions and often employed 3D CG to bring them to life.

IN SUMMARY:
An engaging sleuth adventure perfect for younger viewers. Fans of Case Closed will love Professor Layton's adventures!",1321228800,,2195,4.796296296296297
4692944,3,B005GP7F20,"I assume that the same people who wrote for the Layton games also had a hand in writing for this DVD, but there were times I did question myself.  It's entirely possible that I'm just being too picky - I had ordered&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Professor-Layton-and-the-Last-Specter/dp/B0050SVOHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Professor Layton and the Last Specter</a>, but Amazon botched the order somehow.  Now I am debating whether to cancel it.

Anyway, let's start with the DVD itself.  There is a little bit of DRM encoded in the disc - it totally nerfed my Remote Disc capability on my Mac.  In my situation I was attempting to play it on my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apple-iMAC-27/dp/B005E0Q8QG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apple iMAC 27</a>, which does have a DVD drive, but enjoy it on my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apple-MacBook-Air-MC965LL-A-13-3-Inch-Laptop-NEWEST-VERSION/dp/B005CWHZP4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apple MacBook Air MC965LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop (NEWEST VERSION)</a>, which does not, in a different room.  I received a DRM error the moment the intro logo played.  Much to my chagrin, I was forced to then rip the DVD to a local file so that I could play it.  I really wish these media houses would get a clue.  Summary: there is at least a small bit of DRM.  Won't affect the majority of users playing locally, shouldn't affect big screen DVD players at all.

The first 3 or so minutes of the DVD consist of previews of all of the cutscenes from all of the Layton games, including Specter. It was nice to see them on a larger scale, and perhaps there is hope for a DVD representation (OVA) of each one of these.  It's painful watching them on the DS' tiny screen, and some of the clips are quite excellent.  I did hear where voices seemed to be drowned out in favor of backing audio tracks, and unless I put the sound to maximum, I couldn't make things out.  This is because the DVD was encoded to expect the user to use Dolby Pro Logic II to make the audio discreet, but it would have been better to encode for Stereo or Dolby Surround instead, then increase the vocal and subdue the music.  But what do I know.

As the video starts, Layton is solving a puzzle in one of the London clock towers.  He receives a letter from a former student who would like for him to come see her perform at an opera.  Luke is a bit skeptical, as he didn't ever recall her ever being such a good singer.  Things take a strange turn as the opera evolves into what seems to be a deadly game of puzzle-based survival; the last one standing is to earn ""eternal life"".  On the surface it sounds prime for Layton, and yes, there are puzzles that he must solve in the game...only 4-5 though, and they're not that hard.  The real goal of course is to see where the game takes you story-wise.  Here is where I think the DVD falls on its face.

At first everything is pretty intriguing.  The characters and plot seem to be right out of one of the games.  But near the end is where things start to get a bit silly.  I won't give spoilers, but the cover art is basically a spoiler.  The villain?  Layton and Luke both recognize him, but I have no idea from where, because I've never seen him before (no, it's not Don Paulo).  They introduce characters backwards, and they end up being different than....ah, I just can't explain it without spoiling.  Suffice it to say, I ended up fast forwarding through the final 10 or so minutes of the movie due to the disappointment of what really was going on.  I mean it was worse than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Professor-Layton-and-the-Unwound-Future/dp/B003O6E7DI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Professor Layton and the Unwound Future</a>&nbsp;in terms of how the game ended.

Perhaps my expectations were too high.  That's entirely possible.  I guess I had hoped that this being a movie, especially a full length one, that it would have gone a more epic direction.  I did not get satisfied there.

The saving grace has to be the detail and animation quality.  It doesn't look like DVD quality at all, things are crisp and sharp, especially distance shots where they are driving around a hill or something.  The sheer level of fine detail is amazing, and it draws you into Layton's world.  It's a pity that the backing story just wasn't gripping.

IF you're a graphics fanatic, pick this up.  If you like Layton, pick it up, but don't expect anything on the level of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Professor-Layton-and-the-Curious-Village/dp/B000U5W3IW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Professor Layton and the Curious Village</a>&nbsp;in terms of story.",1320796800,5,4813,5.296833773087071

I don't know what age group this film hopes to target. It is far too depressing for children and much too boring for adults. The arcade-y music fights with voices and often wins. The story is banal, the music annoying and the ending not soon enough.

Only a few people are left and are taken to an island where more puzzles awaits. The movie isn't very long but is packed with actions and puzzles.

4692947,4,B005GP7F20,"This is a great movie. Professor Layton, from the eponymous puzzle games for the DS and 3DS, stars in this lovely animated film that really makes me wish whoever made this would make ALL video game movies. Yes, that's right. This is a video game movie that DOESN'T SUCK. In fact, it's fantastic!
The best part of the Professor Layton games are, no doubt, its lavishly animated cutscenes and its gorgeous European-influenced visual style. This movie is the epitome of that. While the puzzles they added were integrated cleverly, they're no match for the genius puzzles of the games. However, that's not the point. This is a movie that will leave you grinning from ear to ear throughout the whole thing, and even a while afterwards. Its production value isn't quite up to the level of Studio Ghibli's famous films, but its charming enough thta you won't care.
The English dub isn't horrible, either! Anime fans know quite a bit about the horrors of dubbing, and let me assure you that this does not fall into that territory. The English dub features the same voices as the video games, and the voice actors show their chops here. There's some solid voice acting in this, which should make fans happy.
If you're a fan of Layton or even mysteries in general, you'll want this movie. Spread it around, tell your friends about it! Send a copy to whoever made the horrible Super Mario Bros movie to show them how it's really done!
This is not only a great video game movie, it's a great moive all around. 9 out of 10.",1317686400,56,1510,4.5962962962962965
4692948,4,B005GP7F20,"Although I'm a HUGE Hayao Miyazaki fan, I don't know much about other manga or anime films. I didn't know anything about this film or this was based on a game for Nitendo DS either, but I must say I'm glad I had a chance to watch it, because it was very good!

The graphics were one of the many things I was impressed with, as they used various different computer graphics which they managed to mix well with more ordinary animation. Various London scenes appear, such as Regent Street, double decker buses, London taxis and so on which made me smile. An amazing thing is that this was made in Japan, and the animators must have done a lot of research to get the views and objects right.

The characters including Professor Layton were all adorable, and it will be easy for small viewers to be fond of them. The storyline and various happenings reminded me of other well-known anime films, such as 'Howl's Moving Castle', 'Laputa - Castle In The Sky' and 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind', and although nothing is wrong with showing some influences from other great films of the past, I think I got this impression slightly too many times during the film.

As always, I watched it with the original Japanese soundtrack and English subtitles, and I think it's far more enjoyable than watching it with the English dub, although if there is a child amongst the viewers it's definitely better to watch it in his/her native language, as following subtitles must be tiring for them. I think the story is cleverly made, and there are happy and sad moments, a lot of thrilling scenes too, and it gives several opportunities for the viewers to think in order to solve a number of puzzles, so it will be good and fun in this sense too.

Just one more point: on the back of the DVD cover it states there are 30 mins of special features, but I couldn't find them anywhere in this DVD. I wonder if I'm not looking at the right places or they don't exist in the first place? For this small reason I'd give four stars, but otherwise it'd definitely deserve five!

There were several neat opportunities to solve puzzles within the film (such as the one with the towers), but they were few and far between.  The random puzzle nature works for games but less so for movies...it's not as fun just watching characters solve puzzles without feeling like you're part of it.",1413244800,,405,4.690140845070423
4692984,4,B005GP7F20,"This is a cute little tie-in movie for the ""Professor Layton"" video game series, taking place after the fourth game, ""The Last Specter"". Like the games, the movie follows the adventures of Layton, Luke, Emmy, and a slew of newcomers as they progress through a mystery, solving a few viewer-solvable puzzles along the way. The story and puzzles don't reach nearly the intricacy and depth of those in the games, but considering the games each take around 15 hours to complete, this is forgivable.

The movie summarizes the existing characters and settings from the start, and so the non-gamer watching with me was perfectly able to follow and enjoy it. Still, a good chunk of the movie's charm comes from the numerous game references. I couldn't help but crack some pretty dopey smiles whenever the movie poked my Nostalgia Button(tm) by playing a remixed game song, having a game character or item cameo, or displaying puzzle numbers in the sky.

My biggest nitpick is with the movie's pacing. There are several points where the characters are just traveling or holding a very slow, idle conversation, and I found myself often wishing the movie would just get on with it. Possibly these moments were inserted because there was a puzzle to be solved and the creators were trying to give the audience time to solve it, but considering the puzzles really aren't that hard, this wasn't necessary. The movie is an hour and forty minutes long, and I believe it would have been easy (and preferable) to shave off ten minutes without losing any of the movie's content.

As far as characterization goes, Luke fares the best of the main 3, getting plenty of chances to show off his brains and other skills. Emmy, meanwhile, falls pretty flat, showing very little of the youthful spunk that defined her character in ""The Last Specter"". She simply spends most of her time providing exposition or patronizing Luke in an oddly motherly voice. I am not sure if this is her UK voice actor or someone entirely different, but her voicing isn't done very well.

Layton himself is a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, his abilities are showcased pretty well, as he is shown able to handle himself in varied situations with puzzle-solving, item-building, and even some physical skills.

On the other hand, well, I have never understood the creators' decision to design his character with tiny, soulless black eyes. I have even less understood the decision to gradually shrink his tiny soulless black eyes with every new game release. This comes to a head (no pun intended) in this movie, where it's rather jarring to see Layton standing next to the eponymous diva, who happens to have anime eyes the size of dinner plates. To add to the problem, the English dub has him speaking very, very slowly. I can understand the desire to match lip flaps perfectly, but the dub would have been made far more entertaining with the insertion of his trademark inclination towards unnecessarily large words or even his subtle polite snark. Add both these problems to the fact that he sometimes seems oddly uncaring about the safety of some minor characters, and our beloved professor often ends up resembling a humanoid robot firmly planted at the bottom of Uncanny Valley.

Overall, I certainly did enjoy this movie. It made no special accomplishments, but it was cute and charming, and one of the precious few video game movies even worth watching. As a recent fan of the series, I would love to see another movie, and I do believe with the fixing of the pacing issues and a smarter, wittier translation/dub, it could definitely appeal as a standalone film for non-gamers as well.",1410825600,,3644,4.813099041533547

4693005,4,B005GP7F20,"For years we have gotten several bad movies based on video games (*cough* Super Mario Bros.). You would think making a movie based on a video game would be as easy as making a movie out of a book, but apparently it is not. Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva, based on the hit-selling DS games, shows that making a good video game movie is not impossible.

The movie takes place between the games Professor Layton and the Last Specter and Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask. Professor Layton has received a letter from an old student of his named Janice who now performs at an opera. The letter tells about how a friend of Janice named Melina died a while ago. A while later, a little girl comes to Janice claiming that she is Melina who has been giving the gift of eternal life. The professor, along with his apprentice Luke, goes to the opera to investigate. The story is filled with surprises and is very much like the actual games. Though I would recommend playing the games first, it doesnt seem like you need to play them in order to understand the movie.

This film is made in Japan, so it features an anime style animation. That being said, the animation is incredible and takes a step further than the games anime cutscenes.

Unfortunately, though the style of anime looks great, it leads to some rather awkward dialogue. Unlike most anime films, the English dubbing is actually pretty good. However, there are a few instances where the dialogue seems rather strange, such as the professor deducing who the villain was because of a dark, gloomy castle.

Perhaps the only other real problem with the movie is the fact that there was never an American dub, so everyone has their British actors. If youve played the games, the only voice you will be able to recognize is Professor Laytons. This wouldnt be a big problem if it wasn't for the fact that Lukes British actress is incredibly annoying.

The music in the movie, however, is great. With a very European style soundtrack, the music features very catchy tunes. One of the only problems with the music is that even though the song Janice sings sounds good, it was never translated from the Japanese. Im not sure shes performing in a Japanese opera, but by what Im gathering, shes not.

Professor Layton and the Eternal Diva is both a great video game movie and a great anime movie. Though, I would have appreciated the inclusion of some bonus features, the story is very good, the animation is incredible, and the music is great. The creators should also get points for not making a bad video game movie. Overall, this is a great movie for Professor Layton fans.

The animation is pretty good, the story is a lot of fun, with lots of cameos and Layton-series touches that fans will appreciate. If you've played at least through Unwound Future, you know the Layton adventures can get a little wacky in the end, and this one is no exception. If you have a hard time suspending your disbelief, you might need to just skip this one. Otherwise just relax and have fun watching it and you'll enjoy it.
Word of warning to people purchasing the Blu-Ray: It doesn't work on US Blu-ray players. I was hoping I'd luck out and it would be region free, like most Blu-ray disks, but that's not the case. I'd found a few mentions that it was only Region-B, but no one confirmed it at the time I had purchased it. It doesn't even say it's region-B on the packaging or the disk itself. Here's confirmation: It will not load on a US Blu-ray player or PS3 unless you know something that I don't. Only get it if you have a Region Free or Region B player. It's a shame that there hasn't been a Blu-ray release in the US, and it's just as much a shame that the European release is region-locked, because Eternal Diva just looks so good in high def. If you really want it in HD, you can still purchase it legally, but you'll have to get it from a different digital service and it's English dub only. The English voice actors are excellent, though.

I'd say the only corny thing was that they tried to have 'puzzles' within the movie that didn't entirely work in my mind.

4693027,5,B005GP7F20,"Professor Layton is one of the most intriguing video game series available for the DS and 3DS game systems.  The games themselves place a vast variety of challenging puzzles into a storyline full of mystery with frequent (and often surprising) twists.  In short, the games manage to make you think while providing hours of entertainment.  One might think it'd be hard to translate all these key concepts into a movie format, however this film manages to do just that.

I'll start by saying that P.A. Works, the animation studio responsible for the film, has become one of my favorite animation studios.  They've produced a number of animated films and series and have the uncanny ability to change genres and animation styles to meet the needs of any of their animation projects.  They've done comedy/action/drama series like ""Angel Beats"" and ""Hanasaku Iroha"" and have even done the Horror Genre that is so rare in animation with their series ""Another"".  So it's no surprise that they manage to deliver a movie that plays to one of the Professor Layton franchise's key concepts: it makes you think while entertaining you.

While there is not direct interaction in a film as there would be in a game, the movie still tries to get the viewer involved by presenting evidence and plot twists that keep the viewer guessing.  The visuals are very in tune to the Professor Layton series and provide a great backdrop for the mystery that is being unraveled over the course of the film.  The music is great, and the english version's voice acting is amazingly well done (no surprise if you have played any of the Layton games).  The film is great for any fan of the franchise, but it is equally enjoyable to those new to the series as there are no direct tie-ins to any of the storyline from the Professor Layton Games.",1328745600,2,1811,4.735668789808917

The plot is at least as strong as in many of the video games.  Much like the games, the ending is unpredictable but relies on a ludicrous technological achievement to explain something that initially appears fantastical (replacing the impossible with the merely highly implausible).  The graphics are well done, and in the same style as the cut-scenes in the video games.  The puzzles encountered in the movie are even numbered, just like those in the games.  There are plenty of little in-jokes for fans of the series, but even newcomers to the Professor may find themselves laughing at the relationship between professor and apprentice, and their insistence on gentlemanly behavior.

4693036,5,B005GP7F20,"I'm a very big fan of the game, I also really enjoyed this movie. There is a certain quality about Layton in general which I believe would be a turnoff to the viewer who has not already enjoyed the series. In particular, this would be the fairly cheap or childlike vibe it gives off. I can't describe exactly what it is like, but one can imagine the stereotypical feeling from many things such as Tin Tin or the Lemony Snicket books.

However, to those who enjoy this type of thing, this movie will surely not disappoint. It embodies the same clever design in every aspect, such as the puzzles, plot, and scenic qualities as does the game.

I do say that Luke's voice is quite irritating at first, but one gets used to it quickly.

Overall, I applaud the creators of this film(and game for that matter) for making a truly magnificent work which I believe to be both intellectually inspiring and highly entertaining.",1324080000,,915,4.567073170731708
4693037,4,B005GP7F20,"This movie accomplishes two huge things: It makes you feel as though you a part of another classic Layton game and it comes complete with all the familiar charm and wit you'll find within said games.

The order itself arrived quickly which is great as I have been awaiting this movie since I first heard of it being made in Japan. I love the Professor Layton series and I certainly had high hopes and expectations of the film. The movie is a good length and is as entertaining for the kids as it is for the adults. It does a great job of introducing you to each character and the characters themselves are all voiced by the same actors as in the games, which is outstanding considering the voice talent is superb.
The story will keep you engaged and the way the puzzles are presented is genius and meshes with the rest of the plot, making sure the puzzles don't feel strangely out of place or 'cheesy'. I don't want to give away any plot details although it does give you some very diverse locales and sights throughout the movie so that it never gets stale.
The only gripe I have with this is the lack of special features. In 2011, it's almost absurd to not have any extra content that the consumer can delve into. It would have been great to have had a commentary, a making of, or even a few interactive puzzles just for good measure. This is only a small gripe though but one that is definitely notable for any of you wanting a heap of content from your movies.
All in all, this is an enjoyable Layton adventure and doubly great for any Layton die-hard fans out there, like myself. This is an awesome addition to my collection of all things Professor Layton and I think you'll definitely enjoy it!",1323388800,,1700,4.396825396825397
4693038,5,B005GP7F20,"My family really enjoyed this movie- it has a really interesting, unique look (like the game), and the story is nicely done, it makes you want to try to figure out the puzzles along with it- it's a real mystery movie. My only issue is that the voices are different from those in the DS games, but if you've never played them, you wouldn't know the difference. Wish there was a Blu-Ray version- I would have got that instead.",1323043200,,424,4.379746835443038
8472013,5,B005GP7F20,"I had no idea the people who had made the fantastic Professor Layton games made a movie, and for such a good price.  And let me tell you, I loved every second of it.  The animation is done by the same folks who do the cutscenes for the games and, needless to say, it is incredible.  The use of 2D and 3D is seamless, the colors are gorgeous, and the action-packed moments are fluid and dynamic.  The actor who voices Luke in this movie isn't the same as the games, but they did a good job regardless.  I was so wrapped up in the movie itself I never gave much thought to it.
  As for story, its fitting for the universe of the games, taking place just after the Last Spectre.  Layton and Luke are invited to an opera by a former student of Laytons, where she tells them she ran into a girl who claims to be her friend that had passed away several years ago.  Could it be related to the opera of the Eternal Diva?
  One other thing I like in this movie are the puzzles they throw in.  It really feels like the game, but it flows into the story perfectly.  So if you enjoy the Professor Layton games as much as I do, pick this DVD up.  You won't be sorry.",1525046400,,1153,4.04424778761062

8472021,5,B005GP7F20,The Eternal Diva does everything that other video game movie adaptations can't. It has just enough tie ins to the actual game series to remind you of it without it being a cheap gimmick. Having Christopher Robin Miller reprise his role as Professor Layton from the American version of the games also made it feel like I was constantly watching one of the in-game cut scenes. Simply a must have for anyone who enjoys the Layton games or Anime in general.,1483228800,,453,4.604938271604938
