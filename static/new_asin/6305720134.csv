1060921,5,6305720134,"I don't know why others have not liked this movie, I thought it was great.  It was suspenseful and you don't know if he really did kill his wife and is now killing his ""girlfriends"" who he was corresponding with by audio tape while in prison, or if one of the women is trying to set him up out of anger.  The prison guard was also well played.  I really got into this movie, and  I think it deserves a chance, so don't be discouraged by reading other reviews that are less than complimentary.",1177545600,5,492,4.202127659574468
1060922,3,6305720134,"I guess TAPES FROM A KILLER Didn't have the selling point?  Anyway, what ever happened to Patrick Swayze?  After RED DAWN and DIRTY DANCING, seemed like he had everything going for him.  His performance in this lukewarm thriller isn't bad, but it's not inspired, either.  He does some really stupid things, and one can't help but wonder why the screenplay made him so gullible and thoughtless.  He's surrounded by four women he wrote to while on Death Row, and then after given a new trial, he's released.  Problem is while in prison, the nasty head guard, played with relish by Michael Bowen, switched the tapes he was sending and all four women found out he was leading all of them on.  One of them has vowed revenge and wants him back on death row.  The script playfully points the finger at one of the ladies, played by Gia Carides.  But is she guilty?  Carides and Kim Meyer as the southern belle Gloria outact Swayze, and Roger E. Moseley as Horton, the friendly guard and Bruce McGill as the head FBI agent lend capable support.  It's not a surprising movie, but it holds your interest.",1110499200,10,1093,4.582474226804123
1060923,3,6305720134,"I found the movie a little slow at times, but I enjoyed some of the suspense the movie had to offer.  I really like the song by the sister group, very original.  The movie deserves two stars for the acting and one for that song.  I would recommend this movie to friends.",1044403200,4,270,4.153846153846154
1060924,1,6305720134,"This is a movie like another 1000. It's full of common places ,it has nothing new to offer. Decent performances, but without a solid argument. The DVD feautres (interviews, etc...) are quite good, better than many other films, good image, good sound. Honestly, I can not recommend this movie unless you want to espend almost two hours seeing a movie with nothing to offer but a little suspense.",978480000,5,394,4.8088235294117645
1060925,2,6305720134,"Sound quality is PERFECT and so goes the  Picture quality.  The first part of the story is a bit of searching what the story is all about, then drags the whole scenario to a whoever did this and that, not quite riveting...  and I became a bit sleepy, but in the end...the whole puzzle  are put  together.  It's only a simple story about a mentally disturbed individual,  and the story ends with the psycho behind bars... not a SUSPENSE THRILLER I  would describe it in my way... ZZZZZZZ, Ngork!",963964800,3,494,4.47191011235955
1060926,2,6305720134,"This is a decent movie, and even fairly suspenseful.  However, there are parts that keep this Patric Swazye flick from being given 4 or 5 stars.  One is that fact that the film is rather contradictory on several points,  which I will leave to you the viewer to discover.  Another problem is the  simpicity of the film.  A man is in jail for his wifes murder;  he is  acquitted; someone trys to frame him by killing associates in the same  manner his wife was killed; in the end, he is proven innocent.  The same  plot as a thousand other films.  This movie seems to have striking  characteristics seen in ""The Fugitive"", but it simply goes too  far.  Not a high recommendation.
GOD BLESS YOU !",963187200,6,693,4.432
1061088,5,6305720134,"I had never seen this movie ever and I a big fan of Patrick Swayze. I saw this movie on Amazon and decided to get it. This movie is great. Its full of suspense from one minute to the next you wonder who did it. This movie is about Patrick being prison for a murder that he claims he didn't commit.  He is on death row, has a best selling book that he wrote in prison and corresponds with four woman.  He doesn't write letters, but he talks on tapes to these women and they do the same back. Well a couple prison guards have to listen to these tapes before they get sent or are given to Patrick. So they get upset and decide to play prank and switch two of the tapes. Now Patrick doesn't know of the switch until he receives a tape that just doesn't sound good at all. After receiving a couple more of the same tapes, he realizes at one of the guards switched some. He doesn't which one of these ladies is doing it and he worries over it. He goes to court and is set free. This woman stocks him, she leaves tapes for him to listen to, breaks into his apartment and steals all the other tapes from the other women.  He visits all the women and tell each one of them that he was corresponding with others. He looks to see if he can find the switched tapes and he can't. Then things go bad to worse for him because these women start turning up dead. Even his attorney get murdered. The woman that did this was very hurt by the tape that she received and wanted him to go back to prison. So she was hoping that the police would pin the murders on him. This is a awesome movie. Its good enough for someone to get the movie to find out for themselves which lady it was.",1395705600,3,1662,4.045592705167174
1061089,4,6305720134,"Back when I was a freshman in highschool, part of this movie was being filmed right up the street from me. A couple of the crew members had gone into my grandparents' old antique store, and told my family about it. I got to go with my mom and brother to go see where it was being filmed. We didn't get to meet Patrick, which was unfortunate, but got to be on the side of the road where he was filming a scene on a bus, and hang out for a couple of hours. We even got to meet his stunt man from Roadhouse. That was one of the coolest moments. We just didn't know that it was only a tv movie. We watched it when it came on, and it was pretty cool. It was the scene on the bridge that was filmed by my house, and when he was on a bus with this one lady whose name I can't remember, but she was also in My Big Fat Greek Wedding.",1391558400,,824,3.76878612716763
1061090,5,6305720134,"This is the movie that almost killed him from a horse accident. Besides that I thought it was a very good movie, one of his under-rated ones.  A good watch for anyone.",1390348800,,167,4.21875
1061091,5,6305720134,"I'm the hugest Patrick Swayze fan, yes I know you've heard that before. Patrick was so believable in this movie, I forgot about Ghost,
and Dirty Dancing (not for long though). This was movie gave Patrick elbow room to stretch his acting abilities that showed us more than a hunky model/dance. He just happened to be a hunky/model who is an actor.",1387411200,,346,4.596774193548387

1061097,2,6305720134,"This movie was made for television; instead of a major rent, or buy movie. The beginning is interesting, to the middle of the movie.

7893156,5,6305720134,"Not gonna hear a word against this movie. It was shown on HBO in the early 2000's and I remember being blown away by it. It was extremely well directed, with an intelligent plotline and great music. The story of the film's production was not such a good one for Patrick, but thankfully he survived his fall. Never really a fan of swayze, I thought he was really good in the role. Really an underrated movie.",1510358400,,407,4.368421052631579
