From figures to structures and his magnificent landscapes. As I too model, a civil war railroad in HO scale, I was able to pick up many tips on scenicing my layout. Second is the narration, a combination of professorial and engaging. This being a 3 day battle, the script was well written and conveyed. Third is the actual video taping of the scenes and the editing of these to formulate a clear picture and story for the viewer. I purchased my video soon as it came out. I was so enthralled with the quality I called the creator to inquire about his landscaping modeling techniques. After his pointers I asked about where he stores the tables. To my dismay, he said that he had a very small room to build the scenes. Consequently after each filming each scene was dismantled in order to build the next.
I highly recommend this to Civil War buffs, historians and modelers. I too wish it could be a DVD.
