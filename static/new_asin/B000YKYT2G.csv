3032391,5,B000YKYT2G,"What a wonderful, moving flick. Hughe's fascination with Goya that was catapulted to near-obsession after his accident was as alluring as his critiques of Goya's work which were incredibly rich. And there is so much to meet in Goya over the years in the diversity of work he put forth. I also loved the interviews with other artists speaking about Goya's work. .",1361836800,,362,4.761904761904762
3032392,5,B000YKYT2G,"Insightful and compelling commentary and critique of Goya's lifetime of work. His vision is unique yet common to every man. He speaks what we cannot say. The works chosen for the film are stunning and powerful, and seem as fresh today as when they were painted. Even if you know nothing about painting and art making you will come away from this film moved by the experience.",1216425600,15,375,4.611940298507463
3032393,5,B000YKYT2G,"I was never a bit fan of Goya, but work from Robert Hughes, possibly our finest living art critic, is always a treat, and this documentary is no exception.  More than just a survey of Goya's work, we take a journey into the life and mind of the artist.  Hughes does his usual fine job of enlightening and entertaining.  Better still, I emerged at the end of the DVD with a better appreciation of Goya.  I'd consider this a must for collectors of art history documentaries.",1203984000,12,472,4.453488372093023
3032394,5,B000YKYT2G,"It is interesting to watch this film after reading Rober Hughes' ""Goya"".
Mr. Hughes is not only a good writer but excellent actor,particularly after his close to deah experience.

His analysis of Goya is concise and perceptive, every now and then, he
interjected some comments of Leon Golub, a great painter of his own right,
which certainly give a new live to Goya's spirit.",1203206400,9,375,4.859375

8233345,3,B000YKYT2G,"A good documentary. However, it wanders into personal perspectives and, at times, it dawdles too long with lesser important stuff. For a class I teach, I edited out meaningless vocal utterances, dead-air spaces, and over-spent time scene of countrysides and places where there was no dialogue. The edits made the documentary more engaging to students -- from 1:10:03 to  48:39 -- for educational purposes only.",1524614400,,410,5.3076923076923075

8233347,5,B000YKYT2G,"This is an amazing movie i especially  if you like either Goya as a painter or the art critic Robert Hughes (who tragically died a couple years back).  The  film  deals with the biography, social history and artistic technique in depth. Great for your personal use or if you teach art history.",1483315200,,293,4.576923076923077

8233351,3,B000YKYT2G,"this was a doco buy the writer for time magazine. he is a good writer and presenter. if you like bonkers artists (is there any other) than you'll enjoy this walk down the garden path.
goya was spanish. all spaniards are loopy: picasso, dali, franco.....",1397174400,,253,4.644444444444445
8233352,4,B000YKYT2G,"If you like Goya, this documentary provides good insights. The author clearly adores Goya's work and he brings his passion to this film.",1392595200,,136,4.956521739130435
8233353,5,B000YKYT2G,"I bought this DVD over a year ago before Robert Hughes passed way and I have watched it many times since. I also been to Spain many times and seen Goya's work including where he is buried. What I like about the DVD and why I can watch ity again and again is is fun. Hughes style is not to talk down to you but talk to you about Goya's life, his paintings, why he is important as a painting and what is going on in Spain during Goya's life.",1389139200,2,439,3.888888888888889
8233354,5,B000YKYT2G,"This is that rare documentary where both the content and the presentation deserve full marks.  The late Robert Hughes never fell into the trap of rambling, hero worship, or nitpicking.  He systematically investigates what Goya was trying to express in his paintings, possible inner thoughts or emotions, and the horrific changes Spain was going through around him 200 years ago.  It suddenly occured to me how much Salvador Dali built upon the foundations of Goya, another great artist who had a truly unique vision.  Goya remained true to his own perspective whether there was lots of money to be made or none at all.",1385078400,2,618,4.913461538461538
