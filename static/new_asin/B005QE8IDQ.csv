8483319,5,B005QE8IDQ,"My sister and I watched this movie back in the 50's and loved it!!!! I got her this for a surprise, hoping it would take her back in time, so I haven't watched it myself. I was disappointed when she said it was the stage version of the movie and not the same one we watched as young girls. She said it will be nice to see a different version of it tho.",1355875200,2,352,3.835616438356164
