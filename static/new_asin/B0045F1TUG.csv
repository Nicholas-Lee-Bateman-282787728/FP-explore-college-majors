8416640,5,B0045F1TUG,"I grew up on Marvel,loved the Avengers so this is like being in a candy shop. Although the humor may seem juvenile to some adults,I can't get enough. There is always something in an episiode that makes laugh hard. Doctor Doom is funny believe it or not. Modok his sidekick with the helium voice tickles the funny bone,the cameos from villians and heroes are thumbs up. The Avengers lineup has the essentials and Wolverine and Silver Surfer fit right in. Reptior is not bad. If you want to escape to a world of childhood delight and humor, tune in.",1397606400,,547,4.5353535353535355
8416641,2,B0045F1TUG,My grandson did not like this at all. It is hard to follow. It had reviews for younger children but is def for older kids. Wish I could return it.,1387065600,,146,3.9
8416642,1,B0045F1TUG,"DVD case arrived completely busted on the bottom, front, right hand corner and artwork insert ripped. I don't think it happened as a result of shipping since on the inside of case, one of the two plastic holders that holds a disc was also cracked on outside edge. The broken pieces were missing, not inside the packaging. I think this damage was done prior to shipping. Discs are in tact but don't know if they are operable, haven't tried watching them yet. Bought this for a birthday gift for my three year old son, not worth the hassle of returning!
Update:10/06/13 since I kept this DVD series with its damaged case I had to order a new, black, four disc DVD case on eBay for cheap so the problem is now fixed but it shouldn't have been shipped damage in the first place! All the discs were scratch free and work fine with the exception that at times the dialog during the shows is muffled or nearly drowned out by the extremely loud sound affects and extremely loud background music so I can't understand what the characters are saying. I've tried different settings on my surround sound system to improve the problem but it doesn't completely fix it. These are the only DVDs I've ever experienced this problem with. On the positive, my son really likes these DVDs. So in summary...be wary ordering this product, it may not arrive in perfect condition and the sound quality is iffy.",1368230400,,1386,4.592741935483871
8416643,5,B0045F1TUG,i got this for my grand girls and they play it all the time. we all think it's terrific.i am going to try and find season two.,1331424000,2,126,3.7037037037037037
8416644,5,B0045F1TUG,"I finished this whole season in about 2 days. I thought it was great! The humor was wonderful, great for all ages with a good amount of ""adult humor"".
The animation was beautifully drawn and very original too. The Super Hero Squad Show is a wonderful series for both boys and girls. My husband (23) & I (21) are huge nerds & we thought this was a great show for anyone of all ages who likes Marvel or not.

***For strict parents: There is a lot of adult humor like I mentioned above. You should probably YouTube a few clips to see if you feel comfortable or not letting your daughter or son watch this.",1306800000,4,602,4.234782608695652
8416645,3,B0045F1TUG,"I ordered this as I was eager to own the complete first season of this show on DVD. However, I was disappointed to realize the audio of the episodes is 2.0 instead of 5.1. Also, there are no subtitles; therefore, I recommend the Shout! Factory distributed DVDs of this series.",1300752000,2,276,4.54
8416646,5,B0045F1TUG,"This cartoon is funny, and adventurous too!  My 3 year old is eaten up with super hero fever, and this cartoon has lots of good guys and bad guys... and they're portrayed as kids!  The best thing about the DVD set is now we have 20 different ones to watch vs. The 4 we had recorded on our DVR!",1295136000,6,293,3.9491525423728815
8416647,5,B0045F1TUG,"Great show.  My four year old boy loves it.  I agree, it is fun to watch it.  Humor is mainly written with about a 5-7 year old in mind, but there are definitely some jokes only adults will get.

At this time, SHS has only just released the second DVD in the series.  The first DVD was released about 6 months ago.  I wanted this as a Christmas gift for my son as he fell in love with the SHS after Season 1 was over, so I wanted to let him see the whole first season.  I believe these copies come from a Canadian distributor since the whole seasons isn't released in the US yet.  Nothing funny.  NTSC format.  Works excellently!",1294876800,5,629,4.12396694214876
