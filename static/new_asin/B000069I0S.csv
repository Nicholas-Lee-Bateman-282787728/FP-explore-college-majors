7965658,5,B000069I0S,I'm NOT sure what the other reviewers are not seeing.  There is SOOOOO much hard to find material here----both on his life and him performing.  Great footage with a young Jackie King.  Its a glimpse into his life especially at the height of his popularity.  The quality of the footage is just fine..........  There is a whole concert here from the mid 90s too ....  I just LOVE LOVE LOVE this dvd.  Give it a try.,1219190400,,413,4.355263157894737
7965659,1,B000069I0S,"Poor quality, and poor sound DVD.  High School students could put together a better quality production.  Buy all the Willie stuff you can but stay away from this one.",1072656000,8,166,4.689655172413793
7965660,1,B000069I0S,Me and my husband love WILLIE. But this DVD is not worth buying. The sound is very bad. Very poor quality for a DVD. I was very disappointed. Save your money and wait for a better DVD to come along.,1068940800,7,198,3.975
