202020,5,1888617098,A classic ride on the Mother Road - Route 66.  Great scenery and interesting Americana roadside attractions.  Get off the Interstate and see the USA in a classic Corvette !,1168300800,18,172,4.7
202021,4,1888617098,"I was certainly looking forward to this dvd and having watched it my opinion is that whilst it is certainly interesting and one gets to ""meet"" some wonderful, colourful people on the journey that are locked in a time warp I was disappointed that one did not get to see more of the scenery instead of just jumping from one town or village to the next without seeing very little of what lies between. The scenary that was shown was very spectacular and I personally would have liked to have been shown more. But, do not be put off as the dvd on the whole is well worth every penny.",1116633600,25,579,4.2727272727272725
202022,5,1888617098,"No mistake, this DVD is about Route 66 the ""Mother Road"" and really not at all about the great TV show.  But, if you want a wonderfully produced, nostalgic and thoughtful trip down US Route 66 from Chicago to LA this is the ticket.  Much more history and witness interviews and reminiscences than I thought would be captured.  Its a pretty long video.. 2.5 hours!  But, if actually travelling (vicarously?) the road in a C1 Corvette with a fun and entertaining movie star is what you want, I say again, this is right on the spot.'
The music is mostly newly recorded versions and variations of the TV's show great ""Theme from Route 66"" and with Martin Milner and a 'Vette identical to that from the show, you might consider this a new, feature length installment of the show.  In a nutshell, this episode is primarily about the road and the car and a long magnificent drive through our country... instead of those things mostly being in the background on the TV show.  And, if you are at all considering to do a nostalgic Route 66 trip this DVD is a must have resource for planning the sights and people you might want to visit along the way.
I loved the TV series too and I have a few of the episodes on VHS.  But, even more, I love the actual road and the 3 trips I've made on it from Chicago to LA.  Yes, get your kicks.
My DVD worked flawlessly start to finish.  I bought it new from Amazon in Aug '03.",1062374400,66,1405,4.291666666666667
202023,5,1888617098,"If you like roadside architecture, old signs, buildings, drive in movie theaters, & history--BUY THIS!  Martin Milner is THE MAN & perfect choice to host this.  It's like you're there riding in his 60's corvette, seeing all the sites of old route 66.  BEAUTIFUL VIDEO.",1007337600,5,268,4.911111111111111
202024,5,1888617098,"The people we encounter along our video journey should be declared a national historic treasure.  You will see common folks from all walks of life who's address is still along the Mother Road.  I really enjoyed the segment on the Wigwam Motel and the Stripper Museum.  It is bittersweet to think that they are the last of the breed. I was also pleased to see that slim, trim Martin Milner's waistline has enlarged a little more that mine...",973641600,8,440,4.615384615384615
202025,5,1888617098,"This two hour tour of Route 66 is a worthwhile addition to your collection.  A bit more pricey than some on the market, it's definately worth the money.
Plenty of interviews of present-day folks along the road  that make you want to walk right out to your car and head there.
It's  almost time for me to buy another, I've just about worn my copy out!@",952646400,9,351,4.287878787878788
202026,4,1888617098,"This video catches the heart of the people along  the road.  It's full of their hopes, dreams and determination.  It's also very nostalgic.  I especially liked the stripper museum.  Now that gal has guts and is funny  too!  While this video made me sad to see the passing of a way of life, it  also really captures the spirit of that way of life.  It was fun to see  Martin Milner recapture part of his younger carefree ""Rt 66""  image.  His narration is excellent.",948067200,12,464,4.392857142857143
202027,5,1888617098,"This covers the history of Rt. 66 from its beginnings to its demise.  Shown at the Rt. 66 Museum in Clinton, OK.  Very informative and brings tears to your eyes.  A great part of history.",947721600,2,187,4.285714285714286
202028,5,1888617098,"Don't take my word for it ... here's what MOTORTREND Magazine said when they reviewed this video:""Whether your a 66 veteran wishing to prime the memory pump or you just want to see what all the hubbub is about,  'Return to the Road' paints a unique and vivid portrait of America's main  street today.""
MOTORTREND said a lot more but there's not room here.  This two tape set won Best In Show at the Aurora Film Festival, a First  Place/Gold Camera in the International Film & Video Festival and a  bunch of other prizes.
It features Martin Milner and visits all the  wonderful, quirky places on Route 66.
He may be my dad but it's a great  video and you will love it too!",945475200,16,671,4.362903225806452
202029,5,1888617098,"I grew up with this TV series and was inspired by this dvd. It's an excellent documentary on the Mother Road. I plan on doing this trip with my brother very soon. It was one of the things to do on our ""Bucket List"". Martin Milner and the crew did an excellent job. It gave me more of a desire of wanting to go. Im so glad that old ""66"" is making a come back. It means a lot to me and this country to have it preserved,it,s HISTORY..",1455580800,,432,3.865168539325843

202031,5,1888617098,"Excellent documentary on Route 66 with Martin Milner (Todd Stiles ) who unfortunately, recently passed. Could only have been improved by having George Maharis ( Buzz Murdock ) along for the ride!",1447372800,3,195,5.125
202032,5,1888617098,Actually have the whole set of Route 66 it's great!  A late night fav to kick back and watch a few episodes..  this is also great it takes you back to a lot of things gone by. Love it!!,1437264000,,185,3.717948717948718

202034,5,1888617098,"We are purchasing this due to replace our vcr tape copy.  We know this to be a very interesting journey.  Not as others where you are left counting
the ""motherroad""  use to no end.  Extra special, due to Martin Milner's contribution.  We also have the complete Route 66 series (so we are probably committed to Martin!!).
Very nice ""road trip""",1433894400,4,342,4.633333333333334

202038,3,1888617098,Overall I enjoyed this movie. I wish quality had been better and for them to have shown more of the western landscape. But like I mentioned I really did enjoy DVD.,1377216000,,163,4.290322580645161

202040,5,1888617098,"I purchased the complete series of Route 66 after seeing Martin Milner in Adam-12. I like the series Route 66 and enjoy watching a period of time that only I heard and read about. My daughter recognized the the ""Route 66"" from the movie ""Cars"" and is actually watching the series with me. We talk about the highway, the locations, and the towns that are mentioned during the show as so many of these things are gone. As a History major I found the synopsis of this film interesting and so I purchased it. I was not disappointed. The whole family watched and we had all kinds of emotions while watching. We were sad to see the towns that have all but disappeared, what many of the people who remain have gone through, and had an interesting discussion about General Bob. We have even discussed taking a trip down Route 66 for vacation. If you are interested in seeing a piece of America's disappearing history, this is a dvd for you. Thanks Mr. Milner for this road trip.",1373500800,8,970,4.455056179775281
202041,5,1888617098,"I really enjoyed this disc,This disc will show you what was and what is as far as the road is concerned. This seemed to me to be a good companion to the Television series of the 60's.",1372809600,3,183,3.972972972972973

202043,4,1888617098,Saw the gas station my Granddad owned and I worked at as my first job in the sixth grade.  Lived along Route 66 most of my life.  Great memories.,1364083200,2,145,3.9655172413793105
202044,5,1888617098,"He was the lead in tv shows ""Route 66"" and ""Adam-12"".  He also made an excellent set of videos about Route 66.  I'm sure he's still around, and obviously he's very good at what he does!",1355875200,,185,4.111111111111111
202045,4,1888617098,"I bought a copy of this DVD after taking a bus tour of Route 66, and it's certainly a terrific introduction to all of the wonderfully diverse people and places you might encounter along the route. The only slightly jarring note is the presenter, Martin Milner. Not that he's a bad presenter by any means. He's likeable, engaging and articulate. No, the thing that strikes a false note is that when it comes to all the interviews with the great characters who live along the Mother Road - where's Milner? He doesn't interview any of the residents, or even appear in the same frame with them. It's like he and they are in two parallel dimensions - he seems to be aware of the interviewees, but whenever they appear on camera he disappears into his own dimension, only to reappear when it's time to drive to the next location.

Now it's fairly obvious why the producers made the programme this way. They only had Milner for a limited time, so they had to shoot all of his pieces to camera separately from the interviewees. The result looks very jarring to somebody like me who's grown used to the Michael Palin school of travelogue, which are built around the premise that the presenter IS the interviewer. It's not a fatal issue by any means, but it does sadly prevent my giving this otherwise excellent documentary the full five stars.",1321056000,4,1334,4.605042016806722
202046,5,1888617098,"My wife and I just finished viewing the excellent video last evening. It took us two sessions as 2 1/2 hours is a long streach for us.
Martin Milner is perfectly suited for this wonderful return to the famous Route 66 revisited but with emphasis on the places and people along the road.

Highly recommended viewing for anyone who watched the Route 66 TV series when it was initially aired and/or nostalgia buffs.  We just ordered a second copy as a gift to another family member.",1264464000,3,479,4.558139534883721
202047,4,1888617098,"As someone who recently has rediscovered the quality of the 1960-1963 television show, I had hoped for insight into that amazing series produced by Bert Leonard, one of television's smartest producers, and often written by Stirling Silliphant - truly one of television's greatest writers. I've done lots of research on this show for a book I'm doing called Legendary Corvettes that will include a Route 66 car and chapter. Milner had a few pearls about the show but this was nearly as insightful a roadtrip show as the original. Milner drove a very nice 1960 Corvette (red with white coves for those who care, not the Tasco Turquoise that the first season used,) all 2,400 miles from Chicago to L.A. Director John Paget and producer Jim Jenner did a fine job balancing miles of miles and miles with great stories of those who survived the Interstate. There are enough Corvette scenes to keep enthusiasts happy and enough interesting people to intrigue, amaze, and astound everyone else. It's worth the wait to get to California and meet General Bob. Or the Exotic Ranch. Before that were pancakes and corn dogs and neon..., and....

As Zora Duntov, Corvette's chief engineer has often said, ""Eez your seat belt fasten? Okay? Lez go!""

Take this ride.",1254873600,3,1250,4.8915094339622645
202048,5,1888617098,"This was a good video.  Martin Milner, now much older and heavier like the rest of us from 60's, does a good job recreating the old highway.  He visits the places that were around then, as well as some newer ones.  Thought about doing the cruise before, but now, after seeing the video, I know I'm doing the cruise.",1174348800,10,315,4.305084745762712

Martin Milner and his camera crew are top notch and they make you feel that you are on this trip with them. You'll want to go back often to watch a tour of 'Americana' history.",1471132800,5,367,4.111111111111111
