2290712,5,B0009HKUEA,"Diane's DVD is most definitely a feast for all of the senses.  It is her deep and loving expression of what the essence of Cape Cod is all about.  She takes the viewer on a tour of the entire Cape --- from the bridges to the tip of Provincetown; from Cape Cod Bay to Quissett Harbor to Vineyard Sound to the National Seashore.  We get to visit all of the towns on the Cape as seen through Diane's eyes and heart.

Imagine:  seagulls soaring; cormorants keeping a watchful eye from their perches; ospreys spreading their magnificent wings; harbor seals sunning themselves; dogs romping on the beach; hummingbirds humming...

Imagine:  the vivid hot pink of rosa rugosa; the soft, pastel purple of a field of lavender; the reds, oranges, and gold of autumn leaves...

Imagine:  the multi-hued greens of the Cape's foliage which change from emerald to forest green to sage and olive green depending on the season and the blues of the sky and water which change from brilliant azure to blue/green to slate blue/gray from season to season; and the earth which changes from chocolate brown to tan to taupe...

Imagine:  a fisherman surf-casting from Sandy Neck; young boys building stone sculpture and skipping rocks over the water; a shellfisherman harvesting his crop; walkers strolling down pristine pathways...

Most of all, imagine the ever-changing dynamic interplay between wind, water, light and earth that shapes this sacred spit of land.  We are constantly reminded of the vast, wild beauty of the Cape as we experience this DVD.  We become deeply present to our connection to the earth and to the sea.

Diane connects us to the primal beauty and wildness of Cape Cod --- in so doing, she provides us with the opportunity to connect to the primal beauty and wildness of our souls.

I am very familiar with the Cape having been born here and lived here for most of my life.  I give Diane's DVD my higherst recommendation.  It is worth noting that a portion of the proceeds from the DVD go to the Barnstable Land Trust.  Did I mention that the DVD is accompanied by gentle, acoustic music???",1124236800,2,2093,4.747922437673131
2290713,5,B0009HKUEA,"The ""Cape Cod Reflections of Beauty"" DVD is a beautiful piece of art. Video scenics capture the essence of Cape Cod's nature and splendor; the video is set to unique music, making the entire production ""a place of peace."" Unlike most commercial productions, Diane's work is personal, meaningful, and striking. It contains none of the annoying narrative chatter that plagues so many DVDs. The viewer is free to create his or her own experience by flowing with the sights and sounds in whatever way pleases the senses.  Delightful!

Thank you!

2290714,5,B0009HKUEA,"When I got this dvd I wasn't sure what I was getting, the jacket was nice. I was looking for a basic way to let friends see what Cape Cod was like, before they got here. Instead I got this gorgeous travelogue that I kept for myself. It shows every town on the Cape in the most photogenic way and it has a cool soundtrack. The best of both worlds :) I don't usualy reccomend things but this one is an exception. I use it as background when I'm painting because the music is chill and the images are so mello. Highly reccomed. The best one of it's kind.",1123027200,,551,4.064220183486238
2290715,5,B0009HKUEA,"This DVD is so glorious! The Cape in all its beauty.  People who have visited here and taken away snapshots or mental pictures can't even imagine what it's like to own the disk.

It is being on Cape Cod - smelling the salt water, seeing the sailboats, relaxing on the warm sand--don't miss this one!",1122940800,,299,4.418181818181818
2290716,5,B0009HKUEA,"A tall glass of ice tea and this video put me into a Cape Cod state of mind - total happiness and a bit of sweet nostalgia. Check out kovanda's dvd website for more details [...] , I sent it to my sister in London to convince her to come visit - it plays in Europe by the way.",1122854400,,276,3.694915254237288
2290717,5,B0009HKUEA,"As someone with very special, happy memories of Cape Cod, I loved this DVD.

I can watch it and remember wonderful times spent on the Cape, and revisit places that mean so much to me.

I recommend it to anyone who loves the Cape, and to those who have the first visit to look forward to!",1114732800,2,287,4.107142857142857
2290718,5,B0009HKUEA,"Bought this in the Books by the Sea in Osterville last week - I am definitely buying one for all my relatives, this is a beautifully crafted video, obviously done by a local who knows the quiet and serene spots to hang out and get great video- the wave and beach shots bring me right into summer on Cape Cod. Sunrise in Mill Way Barnstable Harbor is pure happinness.",1114300800,,366,4.318840579710145
2290719,5,B0009HKUEA,"This has all the video I wished I'd taken on my vacation to the Cape and more - the cranberry bogs, beaches, lighthouses, windmills, seals, whales, heron, sunrise to sunset over the provincetown monument. I've played it 3 times already - like art for my big screen tv.",1114214400,,268,4.604166666666667
2290730,5,B0009HKUEA,"For those of us who live on the Cape and have seen so much overbuilding, traffic and the loss of free space, Cape Cod Reflections of Beauty is a urgent reminder of all we have come to love and enjoy about the Cape.

Diane Kovanda has magically captured just about every pristine setting on the Cape.  But more than that, is the artistry with which her photographic eye, slow zooms, fades and blends seem to place the viewer in the atmosphere of the natural Cape Cod lands.  Visitors to the Cape experience momentary glimpses of the beauty of this ancient land, but the video compresses the personality of the Cape into its pure timeless nature.

I highly recommend it to anyone who would like to visit the Cape and to those who have graced our shores, as a memory of the Cape at its most magestic.",1147737600,,797,4.438356164383562
2290731,2,B0009HKUEA,"Pretty Good I thought, though I wonder if the footage would look better in HD.  Watching it on a regular tv was a little understimulating.  Loved the music.",1142899200,2,156,4.535714285714286
2290732,2,B0009HKUEA,"I understand that the DVD is not necessarily supposed to be a super high budget but the images weren't really anything I couldn't get in an afternoon myself.  Though I appreciated the soundtrack I was left wanting something a little more unique. I know the Cape well, so maybe I'm a bit biased however, and those new to the Cape would be more impressed.  Some of the reviews here seem to be from people directly involved in production so I took them with a grain of salt.

Connecticut Public Television did a great scenic program of the Cape that was similar to this but unfortunately it's not available here.  This is an ok stand-in but I'm still waiting for someone to do a great visual tour of the Cape that captures it's truly breathtaking beauty, like a video version of Joel Meyerowitz photographic classic ""Cape Light.""  You know, those moments when the light makes you wonder weather it's even able to be documented by a photographic lens.",1142208000,7,947,4.6467065868263475
2290733,3,B0009HKUEA,"This CD, created to raise money for Barnstable Land Trust, offers a number of still shots of places on Cape Cod.  What makes this offering interesting is the original musical score by Michael Zampi, which greatly enhances the visual montage of well-known locations on the Cape.  Listening is relaxing and soothing to the soul.",1139529600,,326,5.018518518518518
2290734,5,B0009HKUEA,"This is a great relaxing dvd. Mike Zampi's music complements Diane Kovanda's scenic footage beautifully. After a tough day at the office or a little spat with the wife-just pop in the dvd- and all will be forgotten. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire package. One particular highlight was the whale segment. Mike's musical interpretation of the playfulness of the whales was perfect. Grab your favorite wine, kick off your shoes, and enjoy. But don't forget those little wine crackers, they are a delight.",1129939200,,502,5.0602409638554215
2290735,5,B0009HKUEA,"""Cape Cod Reflections of Beauty"" offers a meditation of beauty through a combination of tenderly framed images with the intimate voice of guitar. As these images and sounds wash over me I find myself feeling, ""This is exactly where I want to be; seeing the world from this angle, from this perspective, in this light."" I am reminded that this earthly gift is around me at all times waiting for me quietly, ready to restore me through my every sense if only I take the time to notice, to listen, to breathe and appreciate.",1128988800,,521,4.553191489361702
2290736,5,B0009HKUEA,"""Cape Cod: Reflections of Beauty"", by Diane Kovanda, celebrates through a series of striking imagery natural beauty we so often take for granted. It makes us pause for a 55 minute cinematic coffee break. This DVD, shot unobtrusively on video, allows us to escape in peaceful meditation. The viewer is transported to places even more spectacular than coastal Massachusetts. ""Reflections of Beauty"" sends us to those magical dreamlike places within that only the influences of a peaceful New England village can inspire.

Serene acoustic melodies of the always soulful guitarist Michael Zampi guide us through long takes of autumnal landscapes, dreamy town portraits in golden sunlight, wood-lined rivers, lighthouses on rocky beaches, and many other ideallistic portraits that celebrate the beauty of Cape Cod.

The loving mindset it takes to collect such images of simple beauty makes ""Reflections of Beauty"" worth watching. The fact that 10 per cent of proceeds (according to the DVD's back cover) goes to the Barnstable Land Trust makes this a video project worth supporting.",1128729600,,1077,5.366863905325443
2290737,5,B0009HKUEA,"The Cape Cod DVD takes me back to my favorite memories of visiting there.  I wish I had the talent to capture the images she did for the slide show.  The wildlife, shorelines, Townships & Folklife pictures brought us back to our Cape Cod vacation.  The music brought the whole DVD to life.  Listening to the sound track, I felt like I was back in Cape Cod, while I was just relaxing in my Family Room.  My wife loves to play the Music tracks by them selves as a relaxation sound track(much more enjoyable than the typical ""noise machine"", or other innocuous sound tracks).  I like it too and enjoy playing it on a quiet afternoon with the family, enjoying some quality time.  The DVD has a double appeal, with the Audio Tracks and the Photos complimenting each other.  Both are also wonderful art works by themselves.",1128729600,,817,4.510204081632653
2290738,5,B0009HKUEA,"I have yet to make it to Cape Cod, but after watching this DVD, it has become a familiar and wonderful place to which I like to escape.  The images are beautiful and the music is the magic that puts you there!  Mike Zampi has composed amazing melodies that serve to capture the ""feel"" of the landscape and scenery.

When at last I visit the Cape, I hope it as special as the place in this DVD. A great way to relax and re-focus - buy one for you and one for a friend!",1128556800,,467,3.9468085106382977
2290739,5,B0009HKUEA,I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who multi-tasks on a daily basis.  It helps to center and focus me whenever life gets a little too crazy.  Beautiful photographic images combined with the hauntingly beautiful music of Mike Zampi make this scenic tour of Cape Cod a true winner.  An excellent way to discover the timeless charm of Cape Cod.  Also perfect to put on while doing yoga or meditating - or just as background to a quiet dinner with a fire in the fireplace.,1128384000,,472,4.517647058823529

8060747,4,B0009HKUEA,Gives a good overview of the Cape Cod area.  Nice background music and no annoying narration. Hits the high spots in the area.  The filming is very good.  Makes you feel like you're there.  Sort of.  We've watched it a couple of times.,1343260800,3,235,4.372093023255814
8060748,5,B0009HKUEA,"This DVD is the something I never grow tired of watching. The relaxing music and beautiful scenery are great for meditating,as a background during yoga or just plain relaxing. I feel peaceful each time I watch it and have given it to several friends who now treasure it as much as I do! The photographer has captured such beautiful scenes, it makes me want to explore my own backyard all over again. I noticed that some of the profit from the proceeds goes to preserving this lovely place and I think that's admirable.",1172016000,,518,4.580645161290323
8060749,5,B0009HKUEA,"This DVD captures many facets of the beauty of the Cape.  It is set to harp music, which is very well done and quite relaxing.  Since this DVD has only music with no narration, and the scenery is so beautiful, watching this video is like doing a meditation.  The whale footage is great, and the sunrise and sunset scenes are memorable.  Since this has no narration, it is really a nature/meditation DVD rather than a tourist DVD.  I have watched a few times, and highly recommend it.",1171584000,,483,4.505747126436781
8060750,5,B0009HKUEA,This is the best Cape Cod Dvd I've seen and I've previewed a bunch. Before I got this one I was paying attention to these Dvds because I love photography around Cape Cod and I'm always looking for new places to show my friends. I've given several of these to friends from England who then show there friends back home. I highly recommend this for people who visit the Cape and those who would just like to :),1171584000,2,408,4.243589743589744
8060751,5,B0009HKUEA,"Did you ever visit a majestic place only to return with photos that didn't even come close to capturing your experience?  Well, maybe next time you should bring Diane Kovanda along.  She has truly captured the essence of Cape Cod's majestic vistas and natural landscapes in such a special way through her Reflections of Beauty DVD.  Not only does this film capture the epitome of a Cape Cod experience, it inspires me, a year-round resident of the Cape, to get out and uncover the wonders of this special peninsula.  No matter where you live, this documentary will inspire you to connect with the world around you in a whole new way.",1171584000,,633,4.675675675675675
8060752,5,B0009HKUEA,This video provides an excellent view the places on Cape Cod and their character. It is very soothing to watch and listen.,1152748800,,122,4.590909090909091
8060753,5,B0009HKUEA,"I have read a few unkind reviews and I am not sure why.  I bought this dvd with the idea that it would be a gift for my mother.  Well, I had to buy her another one b/c it is great and I find it a peaceful background during my morning routine or when I am entertaining guests and want something on that is not to intrusive.  Cape Cod Reflections is an excellent DVD for yourself or as a gift- You have my word on it.",1152057600,,415,3.802325581395349
8060754,5,B0009HKUEA,This is an amazing journey through the back roads and seldom scene natural treasures of Cape Cod. It starts off by showing the beauty of the unspoiled Cape Cod. Then it transports you to the images of  familiar sites that are amazingly memorable. We sent one to our friends from England and they said it was just like a day on the Cape. I highly recommend this dvd.,1152057600,,365,4.367647058823529
