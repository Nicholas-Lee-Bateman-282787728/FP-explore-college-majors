4237549,1,B00400CPQI,"(I edited this to tone it down a little.)

Did the media drop the ball by falling in love with (then) Senator Obama...our soon-to-be first African-American President?  The answer is likely, yes.  However, I suspect his election had less to do with who we were running TO, and more to do with who we were running FROM.  I see this DVD as (horrific) ""damage control"" for someone who was in the ""from"" category.

If objectivity is what you seek, then you will likely join me in dubbing this ""documentary"" laughably bad (though the video quality is quite good)!  It's loaded with really, really *sloppy* political spin.  HOWEVER, its sloppiness may have HUGE benefits!

In an ironic twist, this DVD may actually acquaint many voters with the types of Logical Fallacies taught in school.  If you've never learned things like logic, syllogisms, a priori, a posteriori (etc.), or if you'd just like a refresher, then this DVD may be helpful to you.  It will introduce you to CLASSIC examples of 'ad hominem', 'argument from the excluded/undistributed middle', 'Tu quoque' and a bunch of other LFs.  (Google: 'list of fallacies.'  Plus, I offer a link to an Amazon product in one of my comments below.)  So, maybe the movie isn't all that useless.  It shows how bits of truth are used to paint untruths...a practice I despise!  Since technology makes it possible for information & misinformation to saturate the globe in an instant, maybe we owe it to ourselves to learn what these slippery LFs look like...no matter our party affiliation.

So:
If you, like me, believe the truth will set you free, then I think you should avoid this DVD (unless you go into it realizing that not all of it is true.  ""Excessive media coverage of Obama"" does not equal ""a worthy Palin.""  Nevertheless, that is the argument that is made from many different angles using LFs).

However, if you want to see Logical Fallacies in action so you can learn to identify them and avoid them, plus you want to research LFs on your own, then maybe you should buy this DVD.  (I believe any college professor would do well to use this DVD as a teaching aid.)

(It should be noted that LFs are everywhere...not just pro-Palin DVDs.)

4237554,5,B00400CPQI,I can not help but feel infuriated at how the main stream media operates. I stopped watching MSM years ago when it was so obvious the bias they show. After watching this film it further solidifies my beliefs that the major news organizations should be tried for treason...or voter fraud at the least. The extra interview footage with Palin shows she is NOT what the media portrayed her to be. Here's something to try...go to any Liberal/Progressive website or FB page & count how many ad hominem attacks are on there.

Hope and change?  No, just hope.  I fear there is no hope for this country when so many not only swallowed this media fable pre-election, but when so many CONTINUE to swallow it - with a big smile of ""entitlement"" on their faces.

But what I really canNOT figure out is, Why did the media want Barack Hussein Obama to be president so badly, and why do they want to re-elect him?  What was/is in it for THEM?

Americans were stupid enough to elect him once; I fear (especially with continued media support) they are stupid enough to elect him again.  May God have mercy on the Union of Soviet Socialist States of America.",1344556800,5,834,4.664383561643835
4237559,4,B00400CPQI,"When anyone who doesn't agree with your position is derided (typically as being a ""paid shill"" or ""having an agenda"" or intellectually stunted or any other negative connotation) it's no wonder why this movie/documentary gets under the skin of some folks: it picks a side.  But which side?

The fact is: the media as a whole is exceptionally biased.  The ones who believe Fox News is the only network who's reporting is ""fair and balanced"" are no different than those who believe FN is a media arm of the GOP.  Despite what each crowd may say of the other, it's not because one demographic is more stupid than the other; it's because they've both fallen for the Left/Right paradigm. For people within the paradigm, you're either Left or Right - there is no in-between. In a Liberal/Conservative-only America, people like Kucinich or Lieberman or Ron Paul are simply anomalies not worth mentioning. Or if one does, be sure to use ad homonym attacks and lots of scorn/sarcasm/etc...

Many reviewers here (more on the 1-star voting I think) seem to have never watched what they're reviewing.  That's a shame, because their mind is closed to any sort of arguments (statistical, obvious, demonstrative, or otherwise) which may convince them that their paradigm is flawed.  The fact is: Obama didn't get the vetting Palin did. Saying so means down-votes and all sorts of nasty invective coming from the Left in the same way a review of a movie showing my support for gay marriage and drug legalization gets me all sorts of nasty invective from the Right (usually with more ""God"", ""Bible"", and ""Morals"" being used). Media Malpractice isn't on the side of McCain or Palin or Obama, or Oprah: it's on the side of people who want better from their media. It's on the side of people who expect more from journalism. It's on the side of those people who can transcend the Left/Right paradigm.  It's on our side - and most of us are too oblivious to know it.

If you've read this far, this is what you need to know about the movie:

* The point of the movie is not to have you walking away hating Obama or Palin; it's to have you think about the acceptable level of media bias (and if the 2008 election exceeds that level). If you are incapable of such thought, the movie is not worth your time.
* The first 45 minutes has almost no Palin.  I know Palin makes some people (Left and Right) just want to scream, and that's fine, but if this is you the first 45m are still worth your time.  Why?...
* The first 45m is about how the media handled Obama and Clinton in the 2008 election.  This is very important I think because it effectively neuters the argument that only FN is biased.
* The movie is does a great job at showing media bias, but seems to work too hard to prove it. Instead of letting the talking heads on TV make the case, the author/narrator creates a narrative and uses the talking heads to prove his case.  This may work, but IMO it's weaker than letting a genuinely-interested audience make their own conclusions.
* Essentially the documentary/movie is focused on the 2008 elections. This means a lot of Obama and a lot of Palin.  Palin came in for an interview, Obama did not.  Obama isn't afraid of the media - why was he not interviewed?  Was he even asked?  The narrator doesn't mention being turned down for an interview... which implies he didn't ask... which implies he didn't want the other side... which implies bias.

So there you have it: a biased media outlet examining the biased media in our nation.  The difference is this: the bias of one guy making one movie is inconsequential (even if it's Michael Moore) by comparison to the massive media machine we have determining our elections for us.  I think Media Malpractice is worth seeing simply because there are facts there which should be seen. If there is some bias there, so be it - it doesn't taint the message.  I see that another reviewer got voted down for arguing for ""thinking for yourself"" and ""understanding the issues""... I suspect this review will get voted down too - but at least I've watched the movie.  I recommend you do too - if you can keep an open mind...",1341705600,6,4144,4.57027027027027

Allowing the media to select the president of the United States is no less dangerous than allowing a foreign influence to do the same. The media has a track record of making the news rather than reporting it and that has never been more true than today. If we as Americans, do not choose to be better informed than simply accepting distortions put forth by the so called news and entertainment industry or super PAC's, then what hope is there for democracy?

I believe we can find better and more effective leadership, but first we ourselves have to lead, by being better students and citizens.

Does the media think we are that stupid and our memories are that short? Apparently so. And judging by the tone of the country, many of us are. Except Zeigler put it on film to document it.

Remember, in this swoon by the media over the Obama administration, likely they will film ""recreations"" of these events so they can ""interpret"" it for you, instead of splicing the actual footage together from the campaign.

4237571,5,B00400CPQI,"While I'm sure this documentary is a little skewed (usually they are), this one hit home with me and put to video the frustrations I had with the 2008 election. The media's godlike worship of Barack Obama was so detrimental to anyone not for him that it was ridiculous. To this day, they are still trying to manipulate political outcomes. Maybe there just wasn't anything to find on Obama, but they blow small things out of proportion with the other candidates, what makes his 58 states comment any different? This video, whether you agree with every line or not, is a very stirring documentary at the very least.

Also, for those of you who discredit Sarah Palin and won't watch it just because she is in it, I have a few reasons why I don't think she's as awful as she was made out to be:
  1. As this video points out, she isn't the one who said ""I can see Russia from my house"", she simply said that there is a place in Alaska where you can. Tina Fay is the one that said that and people assumed she was quoting directly.
  2. Sarah Palin is not stupid. I'm not saying she's super smart or anything, but she isn't stupid. I've read part of one of her books and although she is definitely conservative, but that doesn't make her an idiot by any means. In fact, I found her to be much more intelligent than she is given credit for. Please remember that every candidate is human and will make mistakes occasionally while talking to reporters.
  3. She and her family seem to be much better people than they are ever given credit for. Last summer, after the tornadoes tore through Arizona, she and her husband went to Arizona and helped with the cleanup. And by helped, I don't mean that they went down there and talked on cameras about how everyone should come help these people regain their lives. They went down there and worked. The only reason that I even knew that they did this is because a reporter briefly mentioned them at the bottom of a small article about the destruction and the cleanup process in my local small town paper. I never saw any other stories about them even being there. This is stark contrast to every other politician or celebrity I have ever seen ""helping"" after something like this. They usually would rather stand in front of a camera for maybe an hour and talk about how much someone else can do to help. I rarely see or hear about celebrity types doing as much work for as little recognition. Honestly, I doubt she even knew that she was in the story at all.

So, I just like to remind people not to judge or put on a pedestal anyone that they don't know personally. Give this video a chance and take from it what you will.",1328486400,10,2657,4.37525354969574

I think it was true that the media did take it easy on, then candidate Obama; however, I believe the documentary went way too far in its defense of Sarah Palin. Although some interesting points were made and after watching the documentary I now believe Palin was scrutinized more heavily by the media - I find it hard to believe that someone would not be able to give coherent and at least intelligible replies to questions by newscasters. The director/narrator makes an attempt to seem unbiased. The director makes attempts to criticize Fox News and The Drudge Report; the director also brings some valid points to the media not scrutinizing Obama to the same extend as Palin. It is however, somewhat hypocritical for the director to defend Palin by stating her remarks were taken out of context and to then use clips from the media that are clipped, edited, and also taken out of context.

  At the end of the film the director also cites data from questions asked of Obama voters - it is important to look at the sample taken. It states ""500 Obama voters"", the data cited for McCain states, ""all McCain voters"". I would like to see the entire sample data along with margins of error for the percentage of Obama voters who did not answer the questions asked correctly. One who understand polls, or at least has some common sense, can comprehend that a poll of 500 voters will not accurately represent the  64,385,746 votes Obama received in the election.

  I was hoping to watch a documentary that would be unbiased to an extent, but I find this documentary falling into the category of a Michael Moore film, in regards to level of bias. Overall it was ok, I would not watch this documentary again and would only recommend it to a partisan conservative looking to justify why McCain lost the election and why Palin was solely a target of the media - having no impact whatsoever on how she herself was portrayed to the public.",1317945600,11,1983,4.648571428571429

Don't let the partisan reviews here fool you. Mr Ziegler states in the movie that he is a libertarian who mostly votes Democrat.

It's a pretty straight-forward self-indictment of the media's own words. Fans of Ms Clinton will be interested in watching this movie as well. The first half of the movie is devoted to examining the Democratic primary.

Here's a suggestion if you are still undecided, rent it or watch it at the various streaming sites (looks like Amazon is doing this now but I watched it on my home device). Then, like me, if you like it (80% of the electorate will) proceed to buy it, which is what I plan to do.

I watched the media coverages for 08 and 12, and always had to watch HLN, CNN, AND FOX in order to figure out the truth. But one thing I learned when a person claims to be giving you ""REAL"" honest news, the don't give one sided stories to sway people opinion. They always wanted you to draw your own conclusions. And the documentary was totally bogus! I hate I spent $2.99 for it.",1460246400,2,525,4.422680412371134

8411505,1,B00400CPQI,"I thought about giving this documentary at two star review because I'm estimating it's about 2/5ths true. There were a few good points made that I wasn't aware of before, like Katie Couric showed some shoddy reporting in her dealings with Sarah Palin. And a couple of points that Palin may not have gotten a fair shake on during the presidential campaign. But boohoo, that true of everyone that steps in front of the press. It's interesting but almost anecdotal. John Ziegler says that a quote of Palin's when she was speaking at church about soldiers in Iraq was taken out of context, but I looked up the clip on YouTube and at best the context is questionable. I don't know if I care that Palin wants to pray for our soldiers to be ""on a task from God"", but if someone asks her a question about it it's because she said it. He also goes into the 'Obama pals around with terrorist' issue that came up during the 2008 campaign. Ziegler puts up a picture of Bernadine Dohrn (wife to William Ayers) with her name and a caption about how she was on the FBI top 10 wanted list (when Obama was 8). But neglects to mention that she was cleared of all charges and taken off of any watch list (I looked this up while watching the film as well), so really this wasn't brought up in the media because there was nothing there to bring up. There is one point where he sights an example of media malpractice by showing the cover of the National Enquirer and saying 'the media was saying', but I don't think finding absurd stories in tabloids is something worth making a documentary over. So after that I paid even closer attention and at one point Ziegler sights an example of a false story being reported by the media and I paused the film to look at the example. It was some no namer blog and I read in the blog that Ziegler put on the screen where the blogger actually says ""this blog is the only place this story is being reported"". So about half way through this film I realized the only positive aspect of this film was it gave me some interesting things to research. But I found the premise for the film to be as misleading as Ziegler claims the media to have been during the 2008 election. It's clear once you pull at the thread and see things unravel that  Ziegler needed to put a spin on facts to have a film.",1459123200,,2306,4.313364055299539
8411506,3,B00400CPQI,"Great points about the power of the media. But HEAVILY biased towards the right, and I smelled a bit of racism among its points. That seemed to kill its objectivity less than halfway in. And apparently, Mr. Ziegler has a severe crush on Sarah Palin, who is featured in a very flattering light for at least 30 minutes of this video. She was wronged, and quite badly, but we got the point after the first five times he stated that. If you're not familiar with the power of corporate media, this film will at least open your eyes.",1458086400,2,527,4.387755102040816
8411507,5,B00400CPQI,"Irregardless of your political party, you SHOULD see this movie!  It is more about the LOSS of objective journalism than it is anything else.  Ironically, the film-maker is NOT a Republican like some may speculate, he is actually a Libertarian who usually financially supports Democratic causes.  The Media's roll in Swaying Public Opinion is downright scary.  Everyone needs a good eye opener and this movie does just that.  We as citizens and voters need to take it upon ourselves to be TRUTH SEEKERS and not just to think what we are told to think by the media.  This movie really does sound the alarm on the death of Journalism... true reporting of what really happened and SEEKING to find out what really happened is gone.  You owe it to your great country and it's once held freedoms to see this movie.  After seeing this movie, it becomes even more apparent now how Hillary Clinton is being shoved upon us... in daily yahoo news articles, on the cover of every magazine at the store, and with her new book being a Top Summer Read before it was even released.  Be Aware.  THINK.  SEE THIS MOVIE!!",1403136000,,1102,4.628865979381444
