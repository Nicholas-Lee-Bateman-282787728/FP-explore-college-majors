Also the dvd's have 10 to 11 techniques each. They are basic to moderate techniques so if you are into Judo, BJJ, or MMA it should work for you. These dvd's does not have flashy stuff but they're very basic. The dvd's divides into 4 volumes:
DVD #1...Volume #1- Sweeps, Volume #2-Passing the guard.
DVD #2...Volume #3-Submission part 1, Volume #4-Submissions part 2

Also, Fabio states in one of the dvd's that the Greatest Jiu-jitsu techniques dvd's are a complementary techniques from another series that he has. So, overall, nice techniques, too short, the price COULD be better.",1237420800,3,751,4.913385826771654
