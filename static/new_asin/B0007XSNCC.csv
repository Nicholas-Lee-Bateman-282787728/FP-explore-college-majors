SG-1 arrives on a planet whose people worship the Asgard. Unfortunately, SG-1 had to override some safety protocalls on the Stargate in order to get a lock, allowing the wormhole to pass through the planet's sun causing an unstable reaction. Their sun is now dying and SG-1 is responsible. Now it's a race against time to solve the problem before everyone on the planet dies. (Three Stars)

Episode 2: Rite of Passage

Nirrti returns, and Cassandra is once more a victim of her. A little bit too much drama in this story for me, and I didn't like how they put a different actress in to play Cassandra. (Two Stars)

Episode 3: Beast of Burden

The best episode on this disc. Daniel and SG-1 try to rescue an Unas who was taken prisoner by a group of humans from another world and sold into slavery. When SG-1 arrives to rescue the Unas, they find a whole bunch of Unas in the same condition. SG-1 decides to act and an Unas revolution begins. (Five Stars)

Episode 4: The Tomb

SG-1 joins up with a Russian team to find some missing-in-action Russians. A trip through the Stragate traps them in an ancient tomb. But they aren't the only ones trapped in there. There is also something in there that craves human flesh. A pretty good and scary episode that I very much enjoyed. (Five Stars)",1284163200,,1307,4.489451476793249
