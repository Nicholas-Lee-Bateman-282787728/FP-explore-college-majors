Nick Charles is walking in a park, his son in tow. He scans the racing form. Later Nick and Nora travel across a bridge but are stopped for speeding. Police and ambulances rush to the racetrack. A jockey was shot after he was caught cheating. Not as punishment, but to shut his mouth. Lt. Abrams asks Nick Charles for advice. An investigator was looking into a gang who was fixing the races. Nick and Nora go to a wrestling match and get a hot dog. Two heavy wrestlers put on a show. Then a man wants to go away; he asks for a lot of money. A reporter gets the keys to an office. Someone catches him, and they fight. Someone off camera shoots one of these men, and escapes. Lt. Abrams investigates this murder. Nick Charles explains what he deduces from the murder scene, and a laundry list. Was the shooting of that jockey an accident?

Nora talks to a man, and gives the message to Nick. Nick talks to a witness. Then they have lunch. Asta trips a waiter, and a fight breaks out (for comic relief?). When they go to question ""Rainbow"" they find he won't talk. Nick explains what he observed. All the suspects are gathered in Lt. Abrams' office for the questioning that will reveal the murderer. Nick discovers a new fact that will reveal the murderer (because of an earlier lie). There is a shocking surprise ending. Nora helps to save Nick. The lesson here may be to beware of fixed sporting events. Nick seems to do less drinking in this film. [A ""shadow"" is an operative who follows after a person.]",1490572800,,1539,4.396491228070175
