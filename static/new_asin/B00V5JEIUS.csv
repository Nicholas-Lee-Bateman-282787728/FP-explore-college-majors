8709295,3,B00V5JEIUS,"There's a different voice for Dukey. Close but not quite right. A bit hard to get used to. Plots get a bit strained at times, like they were running out of ideas. And a failed attempt (in my view) to try to show Johnny as as ""Older"" kid. For hard core Testamaniacs only, I think.",1469750400,,279,4.090909090909091

8709298,4,B00V5JEIUS,"Great show for kids and addictive one liners that will have adults saying them more than their children. In short, it's like vaudeville and the Three Stooges married Laurel and Hardy and they wrote a cartoon together.",1438819200,,217,4.891891891891892
8709299,4,B00V5JEIUS,"It's been a while since we've seen our adventurous pre-teen Johnny Test, and frankly, it's about time, too.  When you live in the same house with super-smart sisters and a mutated talking dog, every day is never dull.  On two discs, check out his full fifth season fill with many new adventures as seen on Cartoon Network such as:

""Johnny Goes Nuts"" - Johnny goes to great lengths to participate in Porkbelly's Running of the Squirrels event no matter how many times his mother forbids it.
""Johnny Daddy Day"" - It's Father's Day and the Test family must figure out a gift for their father even though he doesn't really want anything.
""Spotless Johnny"" - Johnny is forced to clean the house.  And his sisters secretly help him by making a special cleaning fluid that turns Johnny invisible !
""Johnny vs. Bling-Bling: The Ultimate Battle"" - It's the ultimate final showdown between Johnny Test and Bling-Bling Boy (or as I prefer to call him Eugene), but they seem too evenly matched what with all the weapons and whatnot involved.
""Cat Scratch Johnny"" - Johnny puts on some experimental 3-D glasses and the creatures from his favourite movie suddenly pop off the screen !
""Johnny Swellville"" - Johnny and his dog Dukey get accidentally sent to the 1950's !  Now he must find his retro-counterpart sisters in order to get back to the present.
""Lawn Gone Johnny"" - The girls soup up the lawnmower making it easier for Johnny to mow the lawn.  Before you know it, he, the girls, and other foes take part in a lawn-mowing race !
""Johnny Testosterone"" - Upset that he's too short, Johnny tries out a growth serum and the results eventually become a tad monstrous.
""Johnny's Winter Jacket"" - The military wants a covert super-weapon that can defend the planet from alien invasions.  So the girls put the weapons systems into Johnny's new winter jacket that looks lame, but not when it's powered up.
""Johnny Trick or Treat"" - On Halloween night, Johnny is invited to a haunted house and take on all the monsters lurking inside in order to win lots of candy.
""Johnny Alternative"" - Johnny and Dukey enter a portal that takes them into an alternate dimension where they meet Joanie West and her dog Dutchie.
""Cool Hand Johnny"" - The child-hating Mr. Wacko imprisons Johnny and many other kids in a jail-themed video game where Johnny tries his darnedest to get out.
""A Holly Johnny Christmas"" - It's Christmastime, and tops on his wish list, Johnny wants the Extreme Snowball Maker.  However, he must be on his best behaviour to stay off Santa's naughty list.
""Johnny's First Annual Snow Ball"" - At least that's what everyone Johnny invited over to his house thinks, but it's really a snowball FIGHT Johnny meant on account of his new snowball maker he finally got for Christmas.
""Mush, Johnny, Mush"" - It's the ultimate dogsled race to be the super champion of the world.  Okay, where have I seen this before ?
""Johnny Test's Quest"" - Johnny's friends have been kidnapped, therefore he must rescue them and the new submarine he's currently trying out from the clutches of someone he didn't expect.
""Johnny X... Again ?"" - Johnny pays a visit to his old pal Repto-Slicer and takes him back to Earth.  Big mistake as Repto-Slicer and its family start eating all the metal in the city.  Looks like it's Johnny X and Super Pooch to the rescue.

What I really like about this series is the well-timed musical cues and sound effects like their signature whip cracks involved.  Also, in these newer episodes, Dukey the dog sounds a little different, but that's okay.  He has a better-sounding laugh for that matter.  So I guess there's one more season left to be on DVD soon enough.  Until then, I hope you have the previous four seasons on DVD.  If not, I hear there's a semi-complete series in a huge DVD collection coming soon.  And keep watching Cartoon Network for more classic episodes with Johnny and crew.",1438646400,,3898,4.690615835777126

Good Addition to the Collection.",1433289600,,55,5.222222222222222
8709301,5,B00V5JEIUS,"Love this cartoon! I know some people hate it and don't understand it, but its a deeper meaning kinda thing. Johnny reminds me of childhood, when anything was possible, and everyday was full of fun and adventure.
Some of you people need to lighten up!
Anyway, I LOVE THIS SHOW, and im glad its on dvd",1430265600,3,300,4.375
