8317141,1,B001L4542I,"Amazon should NOT be offering these low cost products. I could have read a 10 page booklet and could have had more information. This is nothing but a Pop n  Mom simple production where most of he time a lady lady is talking to the camera about items easy to read about and the only dog in the DVD is a puppy shown playing with a small boy. Nice people, but a waste of time and money. I definitely felt ""taken"". First time this happens to me with Amazon!",1393804800,,453,4.089887640449438
