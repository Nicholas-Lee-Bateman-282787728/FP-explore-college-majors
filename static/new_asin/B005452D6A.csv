4559948,5,B005452D6A,This is the most awesome show I've seen in a long time. I highly recommend the brain twisting face splitting nut crunching beats of Fantomas. The commentary track is one of the funniest ever!,1318291200,,191,4.647058823529412
4559949,5,B005452D6A,"If you are a fan of Fantomas, you'll love this DVD!  Well put together & obviously a labor of love. This DVD does not disappoint.",1317081600,,129,4.16
4559950,5,B005452D6A,"An obvious ""must have"" for any Fantomas fan. Just got this today and immediately watched it. Professionally shot with just the right amount of camera antics and visual effects added to keep your eyeballs stimulated. I somewhat agree with the other reviewer; the sound was sketchy in a few spots here and there but listening on a $40 pair of Logitech computer desktop speakers (with subs), I was overall satisfied with the sound quality. Great performances by the guys of course and even though It would've been great to see Lombardo play all the tunes, the legendary Dale Crover fills in flawlessly.  Happy late New Year....",1316476800,5,624,4.886792452830188

sound-B
performance-A+

the only reason this isn`t 5 stars is the sound,you would think with ipecac behind them good sound would be a given but it`s not.though maybe this is done on purpose,this is patton/melvins.it reminds me of the melvins cd the maggot,were the sound starts somewhat poor and gradually gets better,or like seeing a show in a small club where it takes the sound guy a few tunes to tweek the sound.but anyway you slice it ,a must buy for any fan of fanto-melvin mayhem.no lombardo,but dale crover from melvins does a good job filling in.musicianship is A+",1316390400,8,583,4.83
4559982,4,B005452D6A,"The only thing that is missing is LOMBARDO... which is kind of a biggy, but the Melvins man fills in fairly enough, if not just as well, but.... Neil Hamburger never disappoints...even when he tries really hard. Was a nice Christmas present to myself. Thanks me.",1357862400,,262,4.717391304347826
4559983,5,B005452D6A,"Awesome DVD which has been mixed really well, sound quality is good with some weird vissual effects. I highly recommend.",1356220800,,120,5.05
4559984,5,B005452D6A,"Hands down the best live dvd ever made. Just for the fact that, no matter how hard you try, a live dvd CAN'T take you there. If you weren't there you missed it. A video is just a very sub par way to experience a live concert. Without the feel of the sound and the energy of the band and crowd, it really falls flat. THIS DVD however, is not trying to recreate a live show but turn it into something completely different. Lots of fun effects and it's a real artistic take on the entire show. At this price it's worth buying even if you have never heard the music. Just for the experience.",1355356800,,587,4.113043478260869
4559985,5,B005452D6A,"Very pleased with this purchase. Arrived fast. Plays great. Thanks!
The best purchase I have made in a long time. Will definetly do this again! Thanks!",1344297600,,151,4.846153846153846
4559986,5,B005452D6A,"mike patton never ceases to amaze. the first fantomas dvd was awesome, but this one is even better. It might be because it's my favorite album by the band, but every song they play is awesome. I personaly love spider baby and experiment in terror. the whole dvd is awesome. most might consider the songs weird, but thats what is so cool about it, it's different! not the typical crap you hear on the radio. mike patton is a genius with every band he has a hand in, this one just happens to be the one thats the most out there in my opinion. crazy, but cool!",1342742400,,557,4.214953271028038
4559987,5,B005452D6A,"to see mike patton at a genuis level and live you can not go wrong with this dvd, to watch him and the rest of the band with timing and such accuracy is to die for specially if your a fantomas or patton fan.i know i loved it",1327968000,,224,3.6875
4559988,5,B005452D6A,"As other reviewers have said, the video effects are distracting.  Perhaps the boys shouldn't have hired a nineteen year old from 1998 to edit their video.  OMG,  did you know that you can make a video look like neon lights???? Seriously, I really don't like it. I imagine every time I watch it in the future, I will continue to not like it.  But, the performance is so good, that it's five stars even with my eyes closed.

First listen was on good in-ear headphones, I thought the sound quality was amazing.  I can remember one part where the levels got too low.  There are a handful off really insightful moments, where you get to see Patton conducting tempo and levels mid song to sync up with all of his programmed parts.

Dale Crover is an amazing fill-in for Lombardo. To be honest, I didn't even notice it wasn't him at first. It's remarkable that this band swaps drummers, they've done it with Terry Bozzio as well.

It's unbelievable how faithful this is to the record. In ""Spider Baby"" when they hit that filtered part half way thru, it's perfect.  Actually, it may be too perfect, maybe that's done it post or on the soundboard. Anyway, it's a great DVD.  With this and the Secret Chiefs 3 DVD, the Great American Music Hall DVDs are starting to become a real resource.

Suspended Animation next please?!?!

OH, and the Niel Hamburger commentary is hillarious!  Shot in a hotel room overlooking the freeway, he teaches you how to check for bedbugs.",1320105600,,1458,4.579150579150579
4559989,4,B005452D6A,"I love Fantomas, and love that they released this as a DVD.
The songs are amazing!
My only complaint is about the actual video editing.
It's great footage, but it seems like it was hacked together by a teenager on a caffeine binge, trying out iMovie for the first time.",1319760000,,269,4.4
4559990,5,B005452D6A,"Two things surprised me.

1). How the audio quality was equal to CD quality.

2). How good a drummer Dale Crover really is.

This live DVD blows the last one out of the water. Seriously.

I just wish they made a vinyl record of the show. I'd love to spin it.",1318809600,,258,4.0
4559991,5,B005452D6A,"It's Mike so what do you expect- it's really really really good. I've watched it about 10 times at this point. The first couple of times I have to say I thought what a previous reviewer had called the ""camera antics and visual effects"" were a bit over the top. I've never had the good fortune to see Fantomas so I just wanted to see the show, all of it, every second, without anything getting in the way. But after a few more watches I can appreciate how the effects compliment the music. It's not just a documentary of the show - the effects kind of enhance the music and take it to a bit of a different level. People have commented on the sound- there are a couple of places where it is slightly noticeable but there's only so much you can do with a live performance really. It's definitely not a problem in my opinion.

I don't really understand why there are not more live Patton DVDs out from his various manifestations. Surely there must be footage? If there's one thing better than listening to what he does it's seeing him perform it, which is a truly amazing sight. Watching this was such a great change from dodgy utube clips. Hope there's more to come....

And if by chance you're researching this DVD and you don't know much about Mike then this is not a bad place to start. It's Fantomas' most accessible album and the best way to appreciate and understand what he's up to is to watch him doing it. ENJOY!",1318636800,,1418,4.347169811320755

8456296,5,B005452D6A,"way too many camera effects, but sound quality is great!",1471478400,,56,4.7
8456297,3,B005452D6A,"The Band Is Perfect.  The DVD has baaaaaaaad audio.  I don't understand Ipecac DVDs - they all have the WORST audio bitrate imaginable - aside from The Melvins 51/51 documentary - that was filmed solely on poor quality cameras - that one is the only Ipecac DVD with PCM Stereo.  I don't understand these folks.  The other FantomasMelvinsBigBand DVD also has bad audio - and it is a widescreen image - inside a fullscreen image - and the Isis DVD has 192kbps audio.
Why does the best record label have the worst audio on their DVDs??",1453161600,,532,4.510416666666667

8456300,5,B005452D6A,Absolutely awesome! Fans should not miss this!!,1406851200,,47,5.857142857142857
8456301,5,B005452D6A,"This dvd was even better than what I had hoped for. The performance is superb & the guys humor shines through to further enhance the dvd. The cheesy retro special effects could only be pulled off by this band. The sound is what you'd expect from Fantomas & surpasses any bootleg out there. It was mixed by Patton so be prepared to be challenged in spots. Mike is NOT going to spoon feed you! The extras included are done for humor sake, but then again it just goes to show what is important...THE SHOW!",1365724800,,502,4.351063829787234
8456302,4,B005452D6A,This DVD is great if u re a fan of Fantomas. I could rate this with 5 stars if it had better sound quality (have u ever seen NIN dvd? then u ll understand what i meen). And the extras are a bit boring just to be there....,1364169600,,221,3.625
8456303,5,B005452D6A,"Great set by the band, good recording, some interesting post production on the video that I quite enjoyed.  Easily the best Fantomas live recording IMO.",1364083200,,152,5.08
8456304,5,B005452D6A,"Alright we will get the obvious out of the way ..  The camera work is shotty and yes kinda seems like a high school film project in some ways  but  WHO CARES !

  I have been facinated with The Directors Cut since it came out ..  I remember being pissed when I heard the first Fantomas because I wanted a more solid ""direction"" for the songs.. after  I took it for what it was and hearing it now  13 years later  I love it .. so when directors cut came out  I  knew what to expect ..EXCEPT.. Patton changed things up again  and created nothing short of a masterpeice  within the same sparatic almost schitzophrienic structure of Fantomas ..  I always wondered if it was just a studio creation of if it could be created on stage ..  Its nothing short of Amazing  and tight ..  I can't help but wonder how they do what they do  and memorize all the insane time changes..

 The commentary is a bit off .. Neil Hamburger  is a trip  and an added bonus .  Though  Dave is noticably absent , the drummer fills in Nicely ..  This is a must have for Fanotmas, Patton or Horror film fans in general ..",1363824000,,1092,4.1298076923076925
