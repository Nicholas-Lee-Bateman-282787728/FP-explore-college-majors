8086480,2,B000BGR0LA,"I became very impatient with this workout.  It wasn't really pilates but was more like very slow yoga.  She kept saying ""this move is borrowed from yoga"" so I'm not sure why she did not at least call it 'fusion' pilates.  I was so bored I started doing my own workout while watching it, hoping it would pick up.  It never did. Anyway, I'm not a fan of yoga so I was pretty disappointed. She also talked A LOT.  On the upside... she has a lovely soothing British accent and the ladies who demonstrate are heart-warmingly British as well, and quite normal looking, crazy hair and all.  So if you like lying on the ground and breathing for ages... this is for you.",1330473600,2,661,4.333333333333333
8086481,5,B000BGR0LA,"This DVD has a professional almost medical feel to it, which is important especially for first time moms - I felt that I can do it safely. It is a very gentle workout, but helped me tone all those stretched muscles very quickly.",1289260800,2,228,4.325581395348837
8086482,2,B000BGR0LA,"I bought several videos at once and this was my least favorite.  I had a pretty easy labor and I was eager to get back to my old self.  I wanted a video that would maximize what little time I had during the day to work-out.  I never use this video any more.  I now use Postnatal Rescue on the really tired days and Postnatal Boot Camp for the maximum work-out.
My biggest complaint is that the instructor seems to stop the work-out to tell you the benefits.  Good info but not if I want to use the video again and again.  It moved way too slow for me and I kept wishing she would move on.  I got so bored I haven't even seen some of the sessions and just threw the DVD on a shelf

I guess its a good video if you had a c-section and need to take things 'very easy', but it just wasn't for me",1252022400,4,791,3.869565217391304
8086483,5,B000BGR0LA,"This is by far the best postnatal DVD workout that I tried.  The DVD is packed with exercises, stretches, informational interviews, and some guided relaxation.

This gave a nice series of workouts from the very first days after birth when I could barely move, to the time period up to several months after birth when I'm finally starting to feel back to my normal self.

This DVD provided excellent stretches, exercises and guides for posture.  Also, they provide a nice set of printouts giving suggested workout sequences on one page, and then a whole series of pages writing up the exercises.  I found this really handy when life was just too crazy with the new baby and I just wanted to get some exercises/stretches in between the many baby needs and could just take out the printouts and run through them (without needing to turn on the DVD player).

The way Lindsey Jackson explains the stretches and posture techniques is excellent.  I actually remember and think about her suggestions as I go about my day (not just when I'm playing the DVD).

I highly recommend this one.",1184544000,11,1079,4.732620320855615
8086484,4,B000BGR0LA,"Whether you're completely out of shape or simply new to Pilates, Pilates For Moms is a great video for beginners. My only drawback is that I'd like to see the instructions shown in a separate segment instead of during the actual exercises.

That being said, Lindsey does a great job of making this video relaxing and powerful. She makes sure you understand the dos and don'ts of Pilates, how to modify moves, and how to listen to your body.

Yes, it's designed for mothers who've recently had babies, but Session 2 is geared more towards those who've had babies quite awhile ago.

I'm finding the video very helpful for my computer pains: lower back, neck and poor stomach muscles.",1156464000,7,681,4.705882352941177
