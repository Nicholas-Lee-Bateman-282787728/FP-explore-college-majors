2584090,5,B000FSME1K,"Another trip to Luftstalag 13, mind you still there has never been an escape from Stalag 13.  Maybe, Just maybe this will be the year of the first escape!?  Not if the Iron Colonel has anything to say about it.

Another hilarious season of Hogan's Heroes.  The series really began to excel at the fourth season, the show was established, and the cast had grown together.

We see some familiar guests' appearances, Colonel X, with his elite commandos appears, who outranks Hogan.  Many funny episodes from the crew at Stalag 13, and Schultz is fantastic. As stated earlier extras are lacking, but at least we have a reasonable release time.  So hurry and add this season to your collection and hope it holds you over until the fifth season is released.",1158192000,7,751,4.687022900763359
2584091,5,B000FSME1K,"This show is so funny. I started watching because my dad bought season 1 and now I love it. I buy every one as they come out. This season is very different than the first 3, in terms of episode storylines. I think it is the worst by comparison, although on its own, is great.

Buy it if you like Hogan's Heroes.",1157760000,2,311,4.016129032258065
2584092,4,B000FSME1K,"I thought I read that this season had Shultz being Involved more than the past three but I didn't see that. To me the 4th season was not near as good as the past 3 but I couldn't not buy this season for any reason because I wanted the entire series. I'm sure I have seen all the episodes when they were running the show but 30 plus years for me was very long since i seen any episode. This season was packaged like a deck of cards and you know what you get when you open one up,cards. Nothing added,NADA!I guess it's tough to add anything when threre's hardly any money to be made,lol,poor guys. Past this bs, i really think that Big Boy Shultz was the flame of that show. If you took this guy out,I can't Imagine this show being as good. John Banner was awsome in the first 3 seasons. One thing I didn't like about Hogan's Hero's was how out of 15 pow's In their cottage they had these 5 guys Involved while the other 10 were like frniture doing absolutly nothing but looking at the fab5,nodding yes or no and a laugh or smile here and there and don't forget the great quality their clothes were made of to last them for a few years and always looking new,man. Yea, it's a comedy but still what the heck. Like anything, if you like Hogan's Hero's and bought the 1st three, you gota get the rest. You gota see nothing, nothing,lol.",1156377600,3,1331,4.203125
2584093,4,B000FSME1K,"Same outrageous comedy/action as in the first three seasons- that's good.

The color/picture restoration is good (on the couple of episodes I've watched so far) and I haven't noticed any sound trouble- that's also good.

This time around you get only 26 episodes instead of 30-32 and no extras of any sort- that's really a cheap stunt for the DVD people to pull. No deleted scenes, no subtitling (it is closed captioned), no added extras (season 2 had several very good ones), not a single episode has a commentary or added photo gallery. This time around the producers didn't even bother to thank the surviving cast members and their families, you get nothing beyond episode dates and outlines on the DVD cases.

The set is well worth owning, I just hope that when season 5 comes out someone puts out some extras of some sort- they really add to the experience.",1156204800,14,862,4.695364238410596

2584095,4,B000FSME1K,"I have been eagerly awaiting the release of season four as I am sure many other have been. I do own all previous seasons on DVD and am thrilled with the audio/video transfer. But has anyone else noticed a weak mastering of the audio on season 4? I have to turn up my TV louder to hear it which produces that ""white noise"" sound in the background. Oh well, I can deal with it. Can't wait for season 5!!!!",1155772800,9,403,4.113924050632911

2584120,5,B000FSME1K,"What's better than Season 3 of Hogan's Heroes?  Well, Season FOUR, of course!

Now that Hogan (Bob Crane) has the entire Gestapo and Nazi network under his thumbs, it's time for some fun.  Leading his crew of misfits, Hogan does just about everything that can possibly be done to disrupt the war effort from the ""comforts"" of Stalag 13.  Werner Klemperer playing the goofy Colonel Klink is probably as good in his role as Crane is as Hogan.  The only person even close to better than either is the ever popular ""I see nothing,"" Sgt Schultz (the late John Banner).

Hogan's Heroes is SUPPOSED to be stupid.  It's SUPPOSED to be funny.  At the time this was produced, 1968-69, political correctness hadn't ruined our country.  No apologies were necessary for making the Third Reich looking like goons.  Luckily, I got to live in a world like that.",1473292800,,845,4.687074829931973

The characters have been developed, and yet as WW II grew darker, so must the attitude of Hogan and his men.  But the hilarity of the zany capers they pull off is still in fine form.

2584304,5,B000FSME1K,"The Fourth Season of HOGAN'S HEROES picks up right where the Third Season ended.  HOGAN'S HEROES was one of the few series where, with the exception of Ivan Dixon's departure toward the end of the show's run, there were no drastic changes season to season.  That is probably why the series did so well in syndication in that you could mix and match or otherwise view the episodes in any order without losing continuity.  Even those shows that did harken back to an earlier storyline, like Klink's recurring encounters with General Burkhalter's sister, could well stand on their own merit.

Much as we noted in the second half of Season Three, the overall story lines were a little more vague regarding the war's timeline.  In Season Four we have additional references to Stalingrad as if it were an on-going campaign.

Toward the end of the fourth season there are an increasing number of out-of-camp episodes with Hogan and his crew found in the local hotel, a hospital, or a German headquarters.  There are also more episodes with Burkhalter and Hochstetter appearing in the same show.  I still marvel at the fact that the outdoor Stalag 13 set was only separated from sprawling Culver City by tree studded earthen berm.  Overall the production team did a fantastic job in making us believe that the camp was out in the county somewhere.  Season four is the first time you can spot two California palm trees sneaking into the scene over background barracks roofs.

As the show neared the end of the 1960s the number of episodes per season also dropped.  Season Four contains 26 shows.  That is still a healthy number when you consider the pitiful number of episodes boasted by today's half-hour television series.

Hogan and his team have changed very little.  Schultz is just as lovable as he was in the earlier episodes.  His boyish expressions still steal every scene, even when he is in the background.  At times Klink's character is a slightly stricter than in previous seasons.  No doubt this was to refresh the notion that the POWs were still fairly new to the compound.  Despite its several year run, Season Four is still hilarious.

About the only thing missing in this DVD set are special features.  When you buy Season Four you get just that.  Still it is worth the modest price to continue the HOGAN'S HEROES saga.",1170028800,5,2328,4.753117206982544

2584317,4,B000FSME1K,"What can one say about an iconic American comedy show like Hogan's. The fourth season is as good as the previous three. One of the funniest episodes - 'The Gonculator' marks a high point in the season.

Hogan's Heroes is classic American comedy from the 60s, and is a must be for fans of this genre. What makes the show even more special is that, not only Robert Clary as LeBeau was in the French Resistance in WWII, but the actors who played the Germans - Klink, Schultz, Hofstaeder, and Burkhalter - all sought to play their roles as an demonstration of opposition to Nazism in Germany's past, and they and their families all either fled Nazi Germany or were opposed to it in some way. The show thus does not degrade the experience of real PoWs in WWII as some critics would argue.

My only criticism is the absence of special features. Hogan's Heroes is a show crying out for lots of interviews with surviving cast and creators. The first season box set had some special features, though mainly focused on Bob Crane's on-set wedding to Sigrid Valdis (Hilda). There should be more 'behind the scenes'/background info on the show for special features in future box sets. Hence the reason for four stars, and not five.

The visual and audio quality is consistently good throughout the box set, unlike some releases of shows of this era.

Well worth the money.",1167782400,,1359,4.626556016597511
