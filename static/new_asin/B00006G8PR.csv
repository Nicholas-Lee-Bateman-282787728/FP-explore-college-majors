8176058,5,B00006G8PR,"OH!  Let me tell you this is absolutely delightful.  Christmas is celebrated around the world with adorable tiny babies. AND mom-- So precious for your baby to watch, and yourself and family as well.  Grandma will go bonkers over it too. This film is an EMMY AWARD WINNER (and no wonder!) Add on holiday songs from around the world--- see puppets bring the joy and sound of celebration as the little ones are fascinated and entertained.  You will NEVER regret bringing this one home. I can't get enough of watching this, it is so very special.  I feel like hugging every baby on the tape! OOOOO--so cute!",1347494400,,604,4.607476635514018
