2889557,4,B000SQJ28C,I found this movie better than I expected. Very entertaining! This is a movie you don't have to think too much about.....just let go and let yourself have a little fun for the evening.,1203292800,4,184,4.4411764705882355
2889558,3,B000SQJ28C,"A likable comedy with some famous comedians, it is an unlikable event in reality. This is a story which came out a prank by two brothers. Barry (Jonathan Silvers) places an Internet ad for his brother Todd (Jonathan Bray) on a gay website. When Todd goes to meet his date at a gay coffee shop he had no idea it was a man, Kelly (Wilson Cruz.) They both have a lot of things in common and a friendship develops. But everybody in Todd's world, including his co-workers, starts believing that he is gay. His mother (Sally Kirkland) arrives into town to see the news and tries to be the newly understanding mother of a gay son.

Kelly and Todd finally have sex as an experiment but proves what Todd has been saying all along, he is not gay. The movie ends with a reversal where Barry claims that he is gay (his mother thinks that he is doing it to get attention.) Todd and Kelly remain friends and even discuss about having a family.

This movie is in the same style of Eating Out, with a similar dumb scheme. Even though Coffee Date is a pleasant comedy, the idea of gay men even considering to convert straight guys is preposterous. It is not in the genes and it will never happen. And this idea has been portrayed in many movies, DUMB!!!  The movie does have one redeeming quality, true friendship goes beyond all barriers. It gets a plus for that.",1202601600,6,1347,4.38
2889559,5,B000SQJ28C,"I like this piece of fluff.  I reacted to it like I did to Eating Out where the straight guy has phone sex with the fag hag...and he enjoys it.  It is not likely but ok.  Todd goes on a blind date with Kelly, thinking it is a girl.  It isn't, his brother put his profile on the 'men seeking men' page...juvenille doesn't begin to describe the brother who grates like stale cheese by the way.  Now this would only work if the guy's name was like Kelly, could be male could be female...ok could happen.  They meet, work out the issue but like each other.  Kelly likes Todd like a gay man likes a yummy man...believable?  Not so much when you see Todd, but ok.  Todd likes Kelly like a friend he isn't sure he is safe with...  I like that they form a really good friendship.  What annoys the crap out of me is, despite his protestations and his life up until now being not gay, it takes a modicum of encouragement for all to think he is gay and welcome him as a big gay icon. One woman even asks for 'back door' advice...say what now?  The mother ought to be put out of my misery, with the brother...pains in the a**.  The most unlikely scenario of the lot?  Todd now questions whether he is gay, he knows he isn't but everyone else says he is so maybe he is??? Yeah right.  What is Kelly's solution?  If you sleep with a gay man and don't hate it you are gay, if you hate it you are straight.  What??  Is that the only test??  And Todd does it, but doesn't seem to hate it...but isn't gay.  Could have told him that.  There are some interesting bits in the Deleted Scenes feature, you get to hear a bit more about this session.  Then the brother gets in on the act, if the mother is accepting Todd is gay and is getting lots of attention then...he is gay.  But no-one believes him, except Todd.  The brother is a big pain in the rear...so why, when Todd is not available because he is straight, does the big pussy pain in the rear seem attractive???  Most implausible part and really grots me.  Anyway, it is a nice movie.  Makes you laugh...made me laugh out loud occassionally and smile a lot.",1201910400,7,2093,4.193467336683417
2889560,5,B000SQJ28C,"Coffee Date
Is an enjoyable light hearted comedy about the boundaries of friendship, sex and human compassion.
Wilson Cruz is at his charming best as a Kelly who has an internet relationship with another man and they have everything in common BUT one thing. Cruz's character is a  gay male with a sexually ambiguous name ""Kelly"" so Todd whom he is talking to via the internet is not aware that he is male or gay and Todd is straight.

Todd is wonderfully played by Jonathan Bray also very charming in this role.
What happens after they meet for their Coffee Date is both funny and thought provoking.

It's a gay themed movie but anyone can enjoy it because it doesn't have a one viewed perspective on any of the situations.
 Jonathan Silverman as Todd's room mate/ brother lends to the comedic flow as well.
My advice is buy it because it's a movie you will watch more than once..",1200009600,18,880,4.515723270440252
2889561,5,B000SQJ28C,"It was funny and cute.  At times it was uncomfortable because it really challenges mainstreams conception of sexuality.  Sexuality is fluid.  Many can say it, but not many believe it.",1198713600,4,183,5.033333333333333
2889562,4,B000SQJ28C,"You'll need to suspend your common sense a little in the first couple of scenes, otherwise there's no way to get this particular straight and gay man together. Discovering that they've a lot in common, they become friends, then chaos ensures. Everyone starts to think that Todd is gay, even Todd starts to think that he might be gay.
It's a very nicely written and played comedy. The 2 main leads Wilson Cruz and Jonathan Bray are excellent but the mother and brother are over the top; their performance spoils this otherwise charming story.",1198368000,12,541,4.76595744680851

Wilson Cruz is so hot and sexy, that you hardly rmemeber him from MY SO CALLED LIFE. Jason Stuart best know for doing stand up is just perfect as the office no it all. He also has a scene in the break room that shows he has the talent to break out as an great character actor.

2889565,5,B000SQJ28C,"At the urging of his brother, Barry (Jonathan Silverman), Todd (Jonathan Bray) makes a blind date with someone he had been chatting with online, courtesy of an ad placed by Barry.  Once it has been established that they had not exchanged photos during their chats, most viewers can guess the first punchline of the movie ... that his date, Kelly, is actually a man (played by Wilson Cruz), since Barry had placed the ad for his romance-starved, straight brother in the ""M4M"" message board.

But ""Coffee Date"" (2006) ... whichw as based on a short film released at some gay film festivals in 2001 ... handles this seemingly simplistic slapstick-worthy plot with realism, warmth and humor, allowing Todd and Kelly to get to know each other, and find out that they have a lot of interests in common, before either one realizes that their elusive ""date"" is actually with each other.  It also turns the joke around on the brother, when Todd brings Kelly home (and then he sneaks out the window, so Barry believes Todd spent the night with a man), which works too well, since Barry won't believe that Todd isn't really gay, and moves out of Todd's apartment.  Barry also calls their mother, played to the hilt by veteran actress Sally Kirkland, who arrives for an extended visit with her ""just out"" son, proudly wearing a PFLAG t-shirt, and also refusing to give credence to Todd's claim that he is really straight.  Meanwhile, Todd continues to go with Kelly (and occasionally his friends) to see a movie, have a drink or coffee, and when the office blabbermouth (Jason Stuart) sees Todd with a group of gay men, he ""outs"" him to everyone else at work, who accept and embrace the revelation.  It gets to the point where Todd begins to doubt his own belief that he's not gay, but is afraid that the one way of finding out for sure could jeopardize his friendship with Kelly.

Excellent treatment of the ""labels"" people put on themselves (and have put upon them), which also makes good natured fun of some of the stereotypes straight people have about gays (and vice versa.)  Ultimately, this is a light romantic comedy about friendship and defining ""love"" on different levels, with life lessons for people hung up on worrying about how they ""should"" feel in a situation.  DVD extras include many deleted scenes, gag reel and a ""making of"" featurette. I give it a full 5 stars out of 5.",1190505600,48,2379,4.685851318944844

2889582,5,B000SQJ28C,I've seen the movie before and loved the simple comedy of it.  The package arrived on time and without damage.,1403913600,,110,4.5
2889583,4,B000SQJ28C,"The movie could have gone wrong in so many ways right from the start. They could have made Todd homophobic. They could have opted for him to fool his brother by also acting in a highly stereotypical manner. But they didn't go into a lot of these tropes and managed to keep things fair and realistic enough, which is a good thing.

I have to admit, I kinda of laughed at how easily people accepted that Todd was gay. It was definitely a funny scenario to put out there since we all have those straight friends who do a lot of things that make us wonder. We totally know they're straight, but we continue to have our doubts. And Todd nicely captured this conundrum and how we watch his family, friends and work colleagues all get in on wanting to show how accepting they are of gay people was key.

I don't know if we needed to take things to the level of Todd going through a bit of an identity crises in terms of his sexuality. Just because everyone believes you're gay doesn't mean you need to start to think about. And to go as far as considering having sex with another guy was really pushing it. That's when things sort of when into the realm of gay wish fulfillment in terms of exploring that particular scenario, but I suppose we should forgive them that little thing.

Bray was a pretty interesting actor and I think he has a lot more potential for comedy should he push tings further. Cruz was quite the darling though and he really carried the movie more with his scenes. I didn't think I'd like him at first, but in the end I did. He needs more movies!

On the whole, Coffee Date is pretty light entertainment fare and nothing to change the game as it were in terms of LGBT representation in movies. But in a way it does given it helps show that gay comedies are just comedies and they can be a lot of fun. Although we probably didn't need Jonathan Silverman's antics towards the end.",1403740800,,1894,4.326760563380281

It was also great to see Elaine Hendrix also. I remember her from ""Superstar"". It!'s very lighthearted comedy about online dating. One of the nice things about this movie is how you can relate if you're meeting someone for coffee. It shows the comedy of meeting people for coffee dates and the drama of it! The cast is great and it's hilarious how the brother eventually comes out! I just loved his pink shirt with the spiked collar. There are many hilarious moments, but it's nicely balanced with gay/straight issues. Not only is the mother great, but also the neighbor.

2889601,5,B000SQJ28C,"I must say, based on the gay-themed comedies I've seen in the past, I wasn't expecting much out of this one.  They are usually low budgeted, poorly written, horribly acted and filled with unnecessary sex scenes.  ""Coffee Date"", however, overcame all of the afflictions that usually plague these types of films.  What saves this film, besides an excellent script, is the fact that some of the actors here are seasoned actors and not just want-to-be models who lucked up on an acting role.  The lead character is played by Jonathan Bray, who has acting experience in both movies and TV.  His gay friend is played by Wilson Cruz, who I have seen in other gay-related films.  Not only is he great looking but he's also a darn-good actor, coming off as more believeable than many of his counterparts.  The mother is played by veteran actress Sally Kirkland, who's legacy speaks for itself.

The story line is a simple one.  Bray's brother plays a joke on him by putting an ad in the Personals  but instead of putting the ad under Male Seeking Female, he puts the ad under Male Seeking Male.  The other male's name is Kelly so, of course, Bray's character doesn't realize Kelly is actually a man until they end up meeting for a coffee date.  Upon finding out they were both tricked, they find out they have several of the same interests (both are movie buffs)and they form an unexpected friendship. In ordert to get back at his brother, Bray takes Cruz home, walks past his brother, takes Cruz into his bedroom and proceeds to pretend like they are having sex. His brother, in turn, starts to believe the Brady is really gay and then calls their mother, Sally Kirkland, to break the news to her.  Sally then immediately flies in to try to accept and support Bray in his new ""lifestyle"".  Bray spends the rest of the movie denying to his mother and his friends and co-workers that, despite having a gay friend(s), he is not gay.  Bray starts to have doubts about his sexuality when he meets a woman at the bar, takes her home but is not able to perform in bed. The movie takes an unexpected twist when, in order to prove that he is not gay, Bray shares a very passionate kiss with Cruz and they end up having sex together. Bray is now convinced that he is not gay and actually ends up with Cruz's straight female roomate.

This movie could have easily been a disaster but again was saved by great actors and a very well-written, funny script.  I found myself laughing out loud on several ocassions. I really didn't feel as if I were watching a ""gay film"" at all.  So, if you are not gay, don't let the subject matter of the film scare you away. This movie can be viewed and enjoyed no matter what your sexual orientation is.  It's just pure, great entertainment!",1322956800,,2755,4.507042253521127
2889602,5,B000SQJ28C,"I don't understand anyone who watches a movie to critique the camera work. A movie is about the story and how good they are at storytelling (director, actors etc). This one reminds me of that intense time of trying to figure out your feelings for your best friend.

That one other person, other than a future partner, who knows you that well. The complete torture of figuring out that you do love them that much yet you are not in love with them and the complications of sleeping with them before realising that. I would end it there yet the twist for society is that this is a love between two men of different sexual orientations.

Where one actually fell into society's idea that he would have to be gay to love his best friend that much. The same as society's idea that, if his best friend was female and he loved her that much, they should be married.

Lots of best friends have fallen into that trap to lose the best friendship they've ever had, which is what almost happened here. It is what ended my friendship with my best friend of 10 years when we had just barely reached legal drinking age and both our families, pressuring us to make it more than it was.

This was a nice little movie with a happy ending I wish we had.  It's been almost 14 years and I still miss him. I wish I understood then like I do now that there are all sorts of love.",1302220800,,1354,4.252918287937743
2889603,5,B000SQJ28C,"""Coffee Date"" is one of the films to watch when you feel you have been singled out.
Call it ""guilt by association"" or ""judging a book by its cover"".

Once, I had a friend who actually was singled out as being ""Gay"" for having gay
friends.  This man was highly educated, as the main character in this film, and
he was constantly inundated with all sorts of comments for having gay friends.
I enjoyed the funny dialog and that it also lacked in  un- needed profanities.

Well, he was not gay, just single, loving, trusting, and he was my boss.  I loved him.
And I miss him.

""Coffee Date"" reminded me of him.  We should all remember that, in this world -
 we are all human beings first, your gender comes in second, and last, what kind
 of work you do.  Nothing else counts.  I felt a little bad for ""Todd"" - the lead
 character in ""Coffee Date"" because he was nothing but a sweet sensitive man
 who had gay friends.  Its just so bad that everyone else seem to make his
 choice of friends a topic of their choice because they had nothing else to do.

With my all way romance perspective, I would have loved to see Todd and Kelly being happily ever after, but probably this was not the purpose of this movie. Todd's attitude towards Kelly is probably what some people feel when they first meet a gay guy: Todd has never considered himself homophobic, but he has not even really done anything against the common prejudices he has. Todd really likes Kelly, and he probably would have loved him if he was a woman, but Todd is not gay, maybe he is bisexual, but he he is not the right man for Kelly. This doesn't mean that Kelly can't be his best friend.

2889607,3,B000SQJ28C,"I'll come clean and say that I had already seen this partially on LOGO without sound. I was simply entranced by Wilson Cruz and Jonathan Bray. Had this movie been set in the 70s when guys were alot more open to sexual exploration. Jonathan Bray is an above average cute straight guy that is not all that clueless. It does tactfully confront the myth that one time will somehow turn you. It attempts to show that sexuality, even for guys, is a lot more fluid than we usually care to acknowledge. If a gay guy can fake interest in women during his formative years, why can't it also happen the other way around. It can and it does. It is just that it isn't as free as it was in the exciting 70s.",1280016000,,693,4.2180451127819545

The characters were engaging, attractive, and believeable.  The actors were uniformly fine without that self-conscious and amateurish ""I am acting"" behavior that marks so many gay indies.  Along with ""Were the World Mine"", this is one of the best gay-themed movies I've seen, funnier and more intelligent than the Tom Selleck/Kevin Kline movie ""In and Out"", and will appeal to a broad spectrum of viewers, gay and straight.  Definitely a keeper.",1277683200,,621,5.108910891089109

Any chance to watch Wilson Cruz has proven to be entertaining. Watching him as a sensitive gay man guiding a straight man through disturbing adjustments is really fun! We watch this movie at least a couple of times a month.

2889612,5,B000SQJ28C,"Although some of the story line does not evolve enough beyond the black and white world view of 'gay or straight' (because there are many variations in between), this movie is a thoughtful and provoking romp of self-exploration. The lead character is wonderful, and supporting cast super. Take a journey with ""Todd"" as he truly breaks down his walls and explores himself with refreshing honesty and childlike innocence, surrounded by a world that does not listen to him.",1261699200,,470,5.038461538461538
2889613,2,B000SQJ28C,"I enjoy a light, low-budget movie on occasion, but this one had far too many flaws, and far too few good points, to make it very enjoyable. The premise is that Todd's brother, who is staying with him temporarily, posts a singles ad for Todd onto an online dating site. Todd gets a response, and is quite interested in meeting what he thinks to be a very nice woman. It turns out that the brother played a joke on Todd by posting the ad on a same-sex dating website, and the date (Kelly) is a man. Since one good joke deserves another, Todd and Kelly play a joke on the brother and lead him to believe that Todd is now gay and seeing Kelly. This explodes in Todds face as the brother then notifies the mom. Todd is outed to everyone, and is even outed at work, and can't convince anyone he's straight. Over time, he begins to question it himself.

The problem is that Todd is not a very likable person. He starts out as very homophobic and is terrified about being mistaken for gay or being hit on by another man. Yet the homophobia seems to ebb and flow as the situation dictates. He seems stereotypically homophobic (portrayed very over the top) one moment, and the next is very comfortable pretending to be gay and holding another man's hand as he's trying to fool his brother. The rest of the movie is basically the same scene in different settings: Todd trying to convince people he's straight. Early in the movie, he states ""I know how dramatic you people are"", but is a pure drama queen himself throughout the movie. There's nothing in the writing, leaving nothing for the actor to work upon, that shows any reason why someone would be attracted to Todd. Yet people are attracted to him. I couldn't begin to understand why. While Kelly is quite the catch, Todd is one that should definitely be tossed back into the water.

The writing is ambitious, but lacks the necessarily skill to pull off believable scenarios and performances, and the bare-bones direction and cinematography simply amplify that lack of writing skill.

I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that there is one scene in the movie that is genuinely entertaining. When Todd and Kelly turn the tables on the brother and play the joke on him, it's executed very well and is extremely funny. Unfortunately, that moment stands alone.

While it's not a terrible movie, I feel it does fall just short of being ""OK"". The basis for a good movie is there, the writer and director just lack the skills necessary to portray that movie.",1260144000,2,2495,4.5377777777777775

2889617,3,B000SQJ28C,"Since others have described the plot of this film I won't waste time doing it again.  I'll just give a few thoughts on what works about it and what doesn't.  It definitely has its sporadic charm in more than a few scenes.  The actors are quite good, possibly with the exception of Jonathan Silverman, who just wasn't all that credible as the homophobic brother turned full fledged homo.  Wilson Cruz and Jonathan Bray were perfectly cast as the gay and straight men caught in a relationship that's misunderstood by everyone around them - the chemistry between them is great!  Sally Kirkland is fantastic!  It's nice to see her again.  She's always had a penchant for playing slightly loopy, clueless characters and doesn't disappoint here.  The problem with the film it that halfway through it begins to feel like a broken record.  I felt as if I was seeing the same gag over and over again and it got a little tiring.  The film also seemed too long.  It could easily have been tightened with the removal of a good 10-minutes.  But the film's flaws are overshadowed by its charm and sincerity.  You'll laugh more than once.  Watch it with your honey.",1240444800,9,1150,4.656716417910448
2889618,5,B000SQJ28C,"Coffee Date is a delightful movie on so many levels.  The very premise offers so much and not only to gay audiences.  The performances are first rate and charming.  There's plenty of eye candy but there's clever dialogue and outrageous scripting that move the story in manners I've not seen before.  The last few minutes bothered me and I wish I could give Stewart Wade, the writer and director, the opportunity to make that as good and tight as the rest of the movie.  Still, it is his movie, not mine, and if that's my only complaint, I expect he'll be able to sleep nights knowing what a good movie he created.

This is a movie worth adding to one's collection.",1240272000,3,664,4.446280991735537

2889622,4,B000SQJ28C,"Not knowing what to expect when I purchased the DVD, I really enjoyed this film. Yes, it is light, fun and at times a little lacking in pacing. But, when it does catch fire it becomes a madcap comedy reminiscent of the Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart comedies of the forties. ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" and ""Harvey"" immediately comes to mind. It's definitely romantic - but not in the way one usually thinks of romantic films. You would never think of this film as low-budget. Not with the quality of writing, directing and acting. Love that Sally Kirkland! She's always perfect. The two male leads are perfectly cast and project a real caring for each other that goes beyond the usual sexual stereotypes. A believable connection between two human beings It really was wonderful to see this on the screen. I don't know how the director was able to snag the remaining cast as they also were absolutely perfect in their roles. SEE IT! See it for the fun of it. See it because it does not cop out and make fairy tale endings. And it does this with a very sensitive, realistic, and light comic touch. It can also make you feel a little wistful and sad but, at the same time, happy to see a dose of realism in what could have been a fairy tale ending. I am looking forward to more of these types of films.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Coffee-Date/dp/B000SQJ28C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Coffee Date</a>",1217808000,3,1437,4.89344262295082
