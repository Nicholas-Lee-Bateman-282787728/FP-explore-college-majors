4829487,5,B005LN2CRA,Wonderful service from the seller fast and and item came in perfect condition. The movie is very funny but I hate it when you buy a season of family guy and certain shows are taken out and sold as a single. Not fair to the buyer. Sadly this is the last Family Guy I am buying.,1330473600,4,276,3.9464285714285716
4829488,2,B005LN2CRA,I'M A BIG FAN OF THE FAMILY GUY BUT I'M KIND OF DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FACT THAT THEY DIDN'T GIVE YOU THE OPTION TO LISTEN TO THE UNCENSORED VERSION ON THE MENU. THEY BLEEP OUT SOME OF THE LANGUAGE. IF I WANTED TO LISTEN TO BLEEPING ON MY TELEVISION THEN I WOULD WATCH A BOTTOM FEEDER LIKE MAURY POVICH.,1321920000,6,302,4.135593220338983

8478318,3,B005LN2CRA,To charge $29.99 for a 43 minute episode is nuts. You can buy the entire season this episode is on for less money.,1466899200,,114,4.0

8478320,5,B005LN2CRA,"Classic Stewie and Brian comedy that seems to be missing from newer episodes of Family Guy.  The writers should bring that back.  That dialogue  with the AA guy from Canada makes me laugh my butt off no matter how many times I have heard it before. Again, too bad they don't have that anymore on the show.",1453766400,,305,4.315789473684211
