7874984,5,6304463006,"This VHS recording is a must for anyone interested in aircraft accident investigation and flight safety!
I first saw this about 15 years ago in a Government seminar and sought to use it for a flight crew Flying Safety Meeting.  It generated a lot of good discussion--as desired.

This particular VHS recording arrived in half the time forecast when ordered, carefully wrapped for protection during shipment, and turned out to be in excellent condition.

I will return to Amazon.com for other audio/video needs.",1350604800,,510,5.120481927710843
7874985,5,6304463006,"This episode is one of Nova at its finest.  You will be very hard pressed to find a plane crash investigation show that actually takes you to the scene of the crash soon after it happens, and works/records with the investigators themselves while they unravel the cause of the disaster.  It does an amazing job of illustrating the heart and reality of an accident, and takes you through the nuts and bolts of how the investigators collect their data (there's actual footage of this!) and how they use reason and logic to come to conclusions (and/or raise more questions) -- it makes you feel like you're a part of the investigation just by watching.  I also appreciate how they showed footage of the locals involved in collecting the dead (a scene involving a prayer ceremony at the crash site), a few images of passenger photographs in the form of found passports, etc. (as well as their scattered belongings around the jungle floor), and recordings from some of the funerals -- it gives a deep sense of humanity that really struck a chord with me.  An excellent episode!",1301097600,,1071,4.711229946524064
7874986,4,6304463006,It's amazing how investigators solve the mystery of this crash... and scary how such small technical errors can bring down a plane.  I only wish this was available on DVD.,1230163200,,171,4.7
