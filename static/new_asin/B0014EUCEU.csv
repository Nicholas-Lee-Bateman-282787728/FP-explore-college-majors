8255419,4,B0014EUCEU,"I enjoyed this film for multiple reasons. It is an effective documentary in structure and cinematography that shows Buddhist teachers Nhat Hanh and Sr. Chan working with a group of Vietnamese refugees in establishing a buddhist center. The spiritual presence and knowledge of these esteemed teachers manages to come through to any viewer of the film. I enjoyed the sense of community in the film and how the faith of all the people-students and teachers-held them together. An interesting film for teachers, Buddhists or viewers interested in education. 1987. 50 minutes.",1251849600,,571,5.285714285714286
