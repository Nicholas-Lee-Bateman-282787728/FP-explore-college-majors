(SPOILERS)

They kill off Norton & Ironhorse
There's a new race of aliens on the Earth.

There's even a ridiculous time-travel story.",1288224000,6,217,4.512820512820513
4229782,5,B003YJFAM2,"This season is a post-alien-invasion-apocalypse action show...
Don't let dreadful season 1 keep you from really good season 2.
It's like a whole different show!!!",1288224000,11,162,5.52
4229783,5,B003YJFAM2,"Oh, I am soooo thankful that this was released. Despite everyone else's hate on the second season, I liked the darker tone of the second season. Plus, Adrian Paul joins the cast and this was Rachel Blanchard's television debut before taking on the lead role in the TV series ""Clueless."" Now I know why I was in love with Adrian Paul when I was growing up and it was NOT the Highlander series.",1288137600,19,392,4.383561643835616
4229784,1,B003YJFAM2,"Not a patch on Series 1,a completely different programme. Everything good about the series was dropped,the best character killed off.

War of the Worlds was just Series 1. Avoid this dross at all costs",1288137600,7,201,4.911764705882353
4229785,5,B003YJFAM2,I had given up hope on this one and acquired copies of this show that were crappy tv recordings. I'm stoked actual studio copies are finally coming out.,1287792000,3,152,4.464285714285714
4229786,5,B003YJFAM2,Hooray!!! Finally they are finally going to release season 2! A much darker season than the first with the introduction of a new alien species to battle the martians. A must have if you have season 1.,1285977600,32,200,4.4324324324324325
4229787,5,B003YJFAM2,"When I purchased the first season five years ago, I wondered how long would it be before

4229788,4,B003YJFAM2,"...WAR OF THE WORLDS: Season 2 is absolutely AWESOME in many, many ways...but BEWARE of Episode #15-""Candle in the Night""...this surely must rank as one of the all-time WORST episodes in the history of televised science fiction!  The plot: ~~Harrison, Suzanne and Kincaid decide to gather up several of Debi's friends and throw her a surprise birthday party, however Harrison has problems finding a cake.~~ :-(  WAR OF THE WORLDS: Season 2 features 19 fantastic episodes...and ONE EXCRUCIATINGLY BAD one!  BEWARE of ""Candle in the Night""! :-(  You have been warned!!!!!!!!",1282176000,2,572,5.252747252747253
4229789,3,B003YJFAM2,"I have a really mixed feeling about season two of War of the Worlds. It actually did improve cinematography and visuals compared to season one, but the changes to the character lineup were disappointing, the show's mythology was utterly screwed up. After hastily writing out the aliens from season one, there's rarely any sense of alienness about the antagonists. The characteristics of the aliens in season one were creepy, intriguing, and grossly/darkly humorous. That is lost entirely. They're almost never alien-like again, and the established myths of their origins, social structure, behavior, and ideals are utterly lost. It just looks like a show with evil nazi-ish cult humans vs good humans.

The producer that made all these changes admitted to being totally ignorant about who the favorite character was (one of the two guys he axed) and never watched the show (!!!). It's like a totally different series, but with three familiar faces (one sporting a new beard, hah, but losing all his most well known character traits).

Then again, on the up side, season two gave the two female characters much more to do. Those characters/actors benefitted greatly from the changes; Lynda Mason Green herself admitted to having enjoyed more scope for her role in season two.

The season's episodes have some merits. The first episode, despite being extremely frustrating for fans of two of the main characters, is actuslly a very well done episode. The second episode follows right along right from the end of episode one, and is also excellent. It's a shame they reverted to standalone stories from that point on. The second-last episode was quite excellent, gave a true sense of jeopardy for the characters, and was a great example of what this season did right. But in the middle... there are some poor episodes, some recycled plots from season one (because the season 2 writing team apparently had not watched the first season), and the last episode not only outright actively contradicts the entirety of the first season (as most of this season does throughout, but more passively), it also contradicts season 2 itself! It's as though they wrote canceled two episodes before the end and forced someone to tie up the series in one episode without any proper planning. It was nice to have a final story that ends the series rather than a cliff hanger, but it was utterly illogical and contrived. A cliff hanger might have been better.

I could go on about this series for pages. There's no value in that. If you're a fan of the first season, this season might irritate you. If you're a completist, you probably want it anyway. The DVD set itself is just acceptable. There are no extras. The picture quality is unimpressive (surely they could have cleaned it up and sharpened it a bit), but it's basically acceptable. There was very little money invested in this package and I guess we fans have to be glad it exists at all.

If you've never seen the series, start with season one. It's quite good, despite a few embarrassing 80s attributes. Then consider that this season is almost an entirely different series before buying it.",1416441600,,3131,4.9
4229790,4,B003YJFAM2,"Gave as gift, so not sure but haven't heard any complaints",1407283200,,58,4.363636363636363
4229791,5,B003YJFAM2,I love this show! Waited forever for Season 2 to hit DVD's. Shipped very quickly and sold at a great reasonable price.,1398556800,,118,4.409090909090909

4229793,4,B003YJFAM2,"I nearly died when I saw that Amazon was offering this great conclusion to this show!  Yes, initially when it ran, it was dark and I was heartbroken when Norton and Paul Ironhorse where killed off.  But the series offers some fine acting, not only by the remaining cast, but the local Canadian actors as well.

I bought the last two copies of this show last week from Amazon.  I guess they'll have to restock.",1389484800,,409,4.413333333333333
4229794,3,B003YJFAM2,"Different aliens, weird stuff, and a plot that was hard to follow.  They should have stayed with the h.g. wells version it was better.",1370563200,,134,4.583333333333333
4229795,3,B003YJFAM2,"I wish there were special features and that the picture quality was better.
However, it's never looked better (not saying much).

The set starts out with the episode that bridges the two seasons. It's an episode that more belongs as part of the first season, containing the last appearance of several first season characters.
After that, the show bears no similarity to season 1 and may as well be a different show. It's dark in both lighting, atmosphere, themes, and mood.

For most, this show marks the introductory role of Adrian Paul who would later play TV's Highlander.

The budget of the show also takes a serious drop in cringe-worthy ways, making scenes which should be serious into Mystery Science Theater material. The show that premiered along side Star Trek: The Next Generation fell far indeed.

But for those who like dark shows with heroes fighting sinister forces from the shadows, you could do worse.

For myself, it's worth it just to have the final episode of the Col. Ironhorse character played by Richard Chavez.",1356739200,,1034,4.885714285714286
4229796,5,B003YJFAM2,cool show ...does any one know when season 2 is coming out  ?  can u let me know  i liked the story lines and for its time its well done,1354665600,,136,3.466666666666667
4229797,4,B003YJFAM2,I waited for Season 2 for quite a while.  I'm glad it finally came out on DVD.  I got exactly what I expected.,1348876800,,110,3.739130434782609
4229798,3,B003YJFAM2,The DVD is nothing like the original film  but has tried to carry on the theme about aliens it's not to bad for a series could have been made a bit better but I suppose costs are the reason,1338940800,,189,3.8461538461538463
4229799,2,B003YJFAM2,"I tried to give the second season another go, so here are my thoughts (I'll confess now that my review is biased relative to the 2nd season's continuity from the first season.)

First the good news: In the second season, there is a genuine effort to create authentic characters throughout.  The overall acting is a definite upgrade over atrocious performances, poor dialogue, and cookie-cutter cliched characters that riddle the first season.  Unfortunately, that's it, and it's why I'll give the 2nd season a 2-star rating as opposed to only one.  The second season still sorely lacks a number of qualities that made the first season enjoyable.

The Bad News:  For one, Adrian Paul is a fine actor here, but he simply does not fill in the void left behind by Richard Chaves's (Col. Ironhorse's) departure in the season opener.  The 'apocalyptic future' setting doesn't really add anything to the series, as the stakes in the first season just seemed a lot higher (i.e. the U.S. government racing to stop the aliens from retaining their warships.) Nothing in the 2nd season really measures up to that initial storyline, while having the 3 main characters (Harrison, Suzanne, Kincaid) go up largely on their own against an entire alien race hardly ever feels like a 'war' is happening in the 2nd season.  Finally, the season one aliens were just simply more interesting in their abilities to absorb human bodies, sneak-attack civilians with their 3-fingered hands, or speak in their native Mortaxian language.  It almost seemed like the producers weren't trying very hard to create unique qualities for the Morthren race, despite their ability to clone humans.

So there you have it.  Some have pointed out that the 2nd season may be enjoyable as a stand-alone show (which may be true), but it almost seems that despite some solid acting performances, there just isn't enough to care about here.",1331769600,3,1894,4.980952380952381
4229800,2,B003YJFAM2,one of the best characters in season 1 was paul ironhorse played by richard chavez. in season 2 the actor was killed off in the premiere episode. i like adrian paul but they should have kept richard chavez. another character that was killed off needlessly was norton drake.,1326240000,2,273,4.708333333333333
4229801,5,B003YJFAM2,"This is one of the best scifi series that has been done on TV.  The beginning series is on dvd and should be seen before checking out the final season.  I love the final series because it introduces us to the Highlander himself, Adrian Paul, and he is wonderful in this series.  You will see why he became so loved as the Higlander and see just how good an actor he was in this series.  This is one of my most favorite TV series of all time.",1310256000,8,441,4.0344827586206895
4229802,4,B003YJFAM2,"First of let me say to Paramount it's about time!  I still had some of these on VHS tape but once I started watching these in order I realized I had only seen about half of the episodes that had actually aired.  WOTW was one of many first-run syndicated programs that was on in 1989 and 1990 mostly shown at odd hours.  The second season took a drastic turn from the first season that you either like or you hate.  I found the intensity and the pace to be quite hectic at times and literally would be on the edge of the couch so to speak.
 What's great today watching these is seeing the old computers, the BIG car phone, and the clothes and haircuts of the time!  What is more prominent in the second season is the battle between the aliens and the Humans, and there are many close shaves and our heroes wind up in several tight spots that they always seem to just get out of.  The last episode does wrap things up nicely albeit a pity I would have enjoyed a third season.",1306022400,5,973,4.171122994652406
4229803,5,B003YJFAM2,"What I liked about this show from the late 80's? It was the fact that you didn't know who was going to survive the next episode.  Jared Martin from Fantastic Voyage in the 70's was a good character actor.  Adrian Paul was the new kid on the block with his debut as second in command.  All the other characters provided a rich tapestry to make this a compelling show.

I have to add I wasn't happy with the loss of Ironhorse, but the show did need some changes.  The earth was being invaded by martians and I don't believe the structured environment of the first season. This show was from Paramount. The same studio that made The Next Generation, so I thought it was worth a look. I do remember another good show that would play opposite this one called ""Friday The 13th:The Series"", it was also a surprise hit.

For all intents and purposes, War of the Worlds was a solid show you could watch on a lazy Saturday night. In comparison with what goes for suspense and horror, it's mild and not too gory.  It was better than most of the sci fi/horror material that passed for late night TV.",1301529600,8,1087,4.351485148514851
4229804,5,B003YJFAM2,80's sci-fi.  I don't fall asleep watching it. there's some good acting (episode called; loving the alien). offbeat and interesting.,1300060800,,132,5.6
4229805,1,B003YJFAM2,"I just loved the cat-and-mouse game played in the first season.  The aliens thought their revival had gone undetected and despite the lost of much of their burning-ray technology, their need to take over human hosts, and their limited numbers hid out in a radioactive cave in the desert they felt confident.  The humans, on the other hand, were largely clueless of the enemy they faced.  Their single advantage was that the aliens didn't know that they knew.  The motley crew of of defenders combined in such a way to cover each other deficiencies and enhance their talents.  The alien enemy took over various humans in sets of threes from college students to fashion executives, providing a strange commentary of contempary society.  Each episode brought out new revelations about the alien enemy.

They threw that all away with the second season, going for glitz and battles.  Such a waste.",1298246400,3,892,4.939597315436242
4229806,5,B003YJFAM2,The wait for this to be released was well worth it. Excellent quality. I loved this season when it was first broadcast and love it even more now. Thank you.,1296172800,,156,4.233333333333333
4229807,1,B003YJFAM2,"As an American Indian, I feel that what Frank Mancuso, Jr. did to this series is beyond words.  He could have done much more with the Ironhorse character. Instead he had him killed off. I hope I never meet Mr. M.  If I do, I'll have a hard time keeping my mouth shut and giving him exactly what I think...which is unprintable here. And I won't even mention that he had Norton Drake killed off also.  Has anyone seen what's happened to the career of either actor?  How Mr. Mancuso can say 'it was a business decision' is beyond me.",1296086400,,530,4.27
4229808,5,B003YJFAM2,"War of the Worlds was interesting series.  Not my kind of series but my wife liked it much.  She has watched it
through two times that I know of. If you got the first series and like it, you will likely like this one.  Myself
I liked the old movie of it and not so much the series. The second movie well so so.",1293840000,,310,3.8125
4229809,3,B003YJFAM2,"This season was initially very disappointing because it departed completely from the plot and characters of the first season.  It was pretty much an entirely different show.  But the stories were still interesting and well done, and of course Adrian Paul (Highlander) rocks.  Season 1 was FAR better than Season 2 IMHO. I was so disappointed when it first aired that I only watched it because I like Adrian Paul as an actor and because I loved the first season so much. But even Adrian didn't make up for the absence of Ironhorse and company and for the new plotline and silly apokalyptic setting (an alien threat in the here and now is so much more interesting and, well, threatening than a similar threat in an unfamiliar and unrealistic future, so the second season was in many ways a downgrading of the series in my book). However, if considered as a stand-alone (not compared to the first season), it holds up pretty well.  If you loved the first season, you'll undoubtedly be disappointed with this one, at least at first, but if you're really a WotW fan, get it anyway. It really is worth watching, and who wants an incomplete set?",1292630400,3,1138,4.646766169154229
4229810,4,B003YJFAM2,"When I saw ""War of the Worlds: the Final Season"" when it aired on television I was intrigued by how dark it was, to me if aliens ever did invade our world would be a much different, darker place. Looking back now I wish the aliens in the series had been far more aggressive in their invasion of our world; they were rather passive/aggressive. Still it was enjoyable to see again!",1292630400,2,379,4.352112676056338
4229811,4,B003YJFAM2,"Finally; after waiting for Paramount to relesae the War of the Worlds TV Series for over 15 years the final and second season has been released. There are no bonus features on the disc`s (five in total in the box-set) but you do get all of the episode`s from ""Season Two"" in their uncut version. When Yorkshire (a British television channel now called ITV1) showed this season in 1991 it was edited and cut despite it been shown around 11:30pm on a evening.
With ""Season One"" been released already (back in 2005) fans of the television series can now enjoy the entire series on DVD.
Remember though that this television series was produced back in 1988 - 1990; so do not expect the quality of High Definition that any new television series been shown right now, might be made in.",1292371200,2,779,4.571428571428571
4229812,4,B003YJFAM2,I finally got to watch the final season and I wish there was more. The actors and actress did a good job and made it believeable. I enjoy the TV show and now my collection is complete. It took me back in time.,1292198400,2,209,3.883720930232558
4229813,4,B003YJFAM2,"As bad as Season 1 was (bad acting, directing, writing, production, stories etc), Season 2 showed a complete turn-around from the mess of the first season, much better production, writing, and cinematography, a darker season and just 1000% more watchable than Season 1.",1291507200,2,269,5.27906976744186

4229815,5,B003YJFAM2,"I don't get where some have said the 2nd and final season of war of the worlds was different from the first. There only seemed to be months missing before the ending of season 1 and the opening episode of season 2 where the world has fallen into economic and social collapse. The first wave of aliens were eliminated by the second wave for their many failures. Why the first season seems to be kind of chessy,the second year kicks into high gear. Their is continuity between both seasons. The second wave of aliens are a different breed than The Advocacy. To see Norton fall and the heroic sacrifice of Paul Ironhorse to save his comrades,especially young Debi,is moving and touching to say the least. Also,for Harrison Blackwood to pick up arms,to carry a gun is not surprising giving the loss of his comrades. The addition of Adrian Paul only adds to the storyline. This 2nd season has many awesome storylines involving time travel,cloning,and other interesting subplots. And when this Series ends it doesn't cop out and leave the story unresolved. I highly recommend to anyone that has purchased the first season to get the 2nd and final season. Although low-budget,both seasons,made in canada belong in any Sci/fi fans DVD collection My Rating for War of the Worlds complete Series-5 STARS.Highlander-the series fans also might want to consider this for Adrian Paul as the heroic,Kincaid,the soldier prodige of Paul Ironhorse.",1289865600,11,1430,4.9625
4229816,3,B003YJFAM2,"While Season 1 was some of the best sci-fi television you'll see anywhere and stands the test of time, Season 2 is good for one reason: it will bend your mind. Trying to rationalize that it's a continuation of Season 1 is a fun exercise - the Morthren are the higher class of the Mor-Tax soldiers, even though they look and bleed and sound differently, Morthrai and Mor-Tax are the same planet (hey, they must speak different languages on that planet so the planet's name sounds different), Harrison Blackwood is the same offbeat character, he's just angry that the world became a war zone in the span of three or four months and so now he likes guns (he must be angry that his tuning fork didn't make it out of the cottage explosion). And, finally, Harrison and Kincaid go back to 1953, return to 1989-90 and nothing much changes. I haven't gotten to ""The Obelisk"" yet, which I read really turns the whole series on its head.",1289347200,5,926,4.517857142857143
4229817,5,B003YJFAM2,"I never thought this would come out. As much as I enjoyed the first season of this show, the second season was so much better. This season is  darker and serious than the first, and far more exciting. Unlike the first season, which started out good but fell off the tracks about halfway through, this entire season is solid. The only complaint I have with the storyline is the inconsistent continuity, especially with the ( obviously rushed) final episode. However, that is a small price to pay. The copies look great, especially when compared to the old ones I recorded from the tv in 1989. I could not be happier that they've finally released this.",1288569600,3,650,4.6521739130434785

The only way I have seen this since 1989 was on bootleg dvd, which is pretty bad compared to the video quality of this new set.  The picture is almost perfect, 9/10.  The audio is pretty much perfect, 10/10.  Too bad there's no extras though.  One episode, one of my favorites, Time to Reap, is what I watched first.  I noticed on this one there is a lot of dark scenes, which on the bootleg dvd was very hard to see what you're looking at.  On this studio-released set, it is so much better, super clear, and no ""blockiness"", or ""pixelation"", if you know what I mean.  If you're a die hard fan of War of the Worlds, get it.

8409470,2,B003YJFAM2,"What a pity. This show showed such promise in its first season, providing us with some great stories, great character development, some great suspense, and a lot of good set ups for future episodes... episodes that we sadly never got to see. Despite its success, the network was unhappy with the first season and decided to change the show, replacing the entire creative team, and taking the show in an entirely new direction... a direction they should never have taken it. Replacing action and horror with soap opera drama.

Not only were most of these episodes boring, but they also had unoriginal plots. They killed off Colonel Ironhorse and Norton Drake, replacing them with the uninteresting Kincaid. And there are countless continuity errors that contradicts a lot of what we seen and learned in the first season. The aliens are no longer from the planet Mor'Tax but from Mothrai, it's now the near future where human society is breaking down instead of in the present, the invaders are now revealed to be the only intelligent lifeforms in the the galaxy despite the fact that in season one's finale we learn that they are at war with beings from their neighboring planet Qar'To, and now the aliens only had ships capable of reaching Earth since 1953 even though in the first season it was revealed that they had visited our world on two separate other occasions back in 1938 and even earlier several thousand years ago. The continuity in this season stinks! And there are no continuations on any of the teaser set ups we seen in season one, and that includes no continuation to the cliffhanger ending of season one's finale.

Even though there are a few good episodes in this season, such as the season premiere, most of them I was bored to death with. And the series' finale was dreadful. It's a real shame considering the first season was so good.",1445472000,,1856,4.743034055727554
8409471,3,B003YJFAM2,"I really wanted to love season 2. I had watched season 1 when it came out and re-watched it on DVD a couple years ago. But had never seen season 2. So took the plunge and watched season 2. Boy, was I mostly...bored. Just shows the limitations of low-budget science fiction, esp. where the creative vision of its originator (Greg Strangis) was replaced by a new vision (Frank Mancuso, Jr.). So many areas to complain about...

- The show was revamped and retooled for season 2. What had been quirky, fun, and different, became pretty repetitive, bleak, unexciting. And we lost two great characters from season 1! Adrian Paul just could replace them. And the remaining main characters lost their chemistry and sense of humor.

- The mythology of the first season was gutted. And never explained satisfactorily. Just watch the end of season 1, when a new alien race is introduced, to the start of season 2, when there is no new race but just a new version of the old race. One that then wipes out the more interesting characters to replace them with ones that look and act more human. But then the last episode essentially throws away the new and the old mythology, leaving us with a complete explanation, but one that is too bland.

- There just aren't many really interesting or exciting episodes. Part of this problem is that most of the episodes are set in the same city with the same boring sets used over and over again. The aliens in their HQ. The three humans in their underground quarters. The cheap Blade Runner-like run down alleys, warehouses, and low-rent commercial district. (Though I did actually like that most of the episodes were shot during the colder months. Which just felt right. See the cold in the bleak setting.) The first episode was mildly interesting, for the demise of the beloved characters and setting from season 1. But after that... had to wait for Episode 11, Time to Reap, which takes us back to 1953 and the original alien invasion. And it is shot in beautiful b&w. The single really good episode of the season. I did enjoy Episode 14, Pack of Lies, about a photographer who photographs an alien and his newspaper editor who has to deal with publishing it. Then have to wait until Episode 19, True Believer, where the aliens frame the humans for a bank robbery gone bloody and the humans are forced to rely on an honest bounty-hunting cop.

- And maybe it is just me, but there was so little really interesting character development or interaction. Much of it was focused on the past. We'd see flashbacks. But not that much actually happened to them that made the three humans grow and develop and fill out as real characters. Some may hate it, but Episode 15, Candle in the Night, about a surprise birthday party for Debbie, was actually quite touching. (Too bad this and a few other episodes could be a bit creepy about Debbie and John Kincaid!)

- Some ideas that were potentially interesting--Episode 9, Synthetic Love, dealing with the after-effects of a national legalization of all formerly illicit drugs--were then rarely mentioned again. As most episodes just have the aliens try to figure out some new way to harm the humans or protect themselves. If only the producers had put all the pieces of this ""Almost Tomorrow"" near-apocalyptic world in play and kept them there! This season would've greatly benefitted from more stories that built off of and on top of each other, serialized, rather than separate episodes of the week, procedural. (See a great show like Babylon 5!)

But one positive area: The actor who plays Death on Supernatural, Julian Richings, appears here in many 2nd season episodes as the alien invader assistant and all-around go-to-man Ardix. He always brings an appropriate unique vibe to his character!

Anyone who loved season 1 might want to watch this. But you'd be better off spending your time elsewhere. (Which may explain why the 2nd season was cut down to just 20 episodes from season 1's 23? They just didn't seem to have that much interesting to show or tell us!)",1439769600,,4039,4.7205673758865245
