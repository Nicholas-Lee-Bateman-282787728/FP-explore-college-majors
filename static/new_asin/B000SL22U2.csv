8205788,1,B000SL22U2,"I found this DVD to be absolutely awful. The snowscapes are very inferior indeed - boring and unappealing - when snowscapes should so easily be gloriously beautiful.

In those where absolutely nothing is happening, I would have done far better to have just saved some Internet pictures to look at. In ones where snowfall is taking place, there is no sense of scenery change due to snow accumulation or focus on interesting shapes made by the snow.

The music is tuneless, grates on the ear and does not match the moods and different types of landscape on display.

I would not have believed that such a potentially beautiful and magical subject could be so badly produced. This DVD is a waste of the money and viewing time.",1325721600,9,723,4.677165354330708

8205790,5,B000SL22U2,"I just love this DVD. I know it's ""kitsch"" and weird. But I really like when it's snowing, and where I live, it doesn't snow very much. So I put this DVD on, while cleaning the house or tidying up my stuff and it's so cool !
You can see winter's view with snow falling and on the floor. The video are really cool and the music is realyxing. Love it !",1240704000,30,350,3.875
