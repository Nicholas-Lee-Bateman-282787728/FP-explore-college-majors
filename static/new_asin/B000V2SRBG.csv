Based on Thea Beckman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crusade-in-Jeans/dp/188691026X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crusade in Jeans</a>&nbsp;and directed by Ben Sombogaart. Dolf Vega, a young Dutch soccer player, is accidentally propelled to the thirteenth century by a time machine. He then takes part in the children crusade to Jerusalem organized by Father Anselmus and the young Nicholas. Teenagers and adults will like this very smart film which will teach them a few interesting things about the Middle Ages. Unlike a Disney movie, CRUSADE doesn't embellish reality: children starve to death, are killed by wolves or succumb to illness. Highly recommended.",1224979200,2,715,6.617021276595745
