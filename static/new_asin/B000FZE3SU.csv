However, there was a 5 plus restocking fee. So I was returned a 1.70 back. Really?? And I saw nothing about that before hand or I'd never have bothered sending it back.",1442448000,,326,4.274193548387097
8127645,5,B000FZE3SU,"The dvds cover these topics for preschoolers, learning about patience, sharing and differences.  Each tells a story that the child can relate to and comprehend.  My 4 year old got the message and refers to a certain dvd subject when confronted with a similiar situation. Priceless!  He had a real problem with sharing. The sharing dvd cleared this up in a manner that I could never have done. These are worth every penny.",1389484800,,421,4.739726027397261
