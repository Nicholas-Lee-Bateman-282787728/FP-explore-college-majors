2836830,5,B000P72PU6,"Every Friday night is Ninja turtle night at our house.  Pizza, my four year old grandson and the Ninja Turtles.  He's loved them since he was about two and a half and they amuse the adults in the room too.  Whoever wrote the series has totally captured how teenaged boys talk and act!",1398902400,6,284,4.320754716981132
2836831,5,B000P72PU6,"In this episode honoring the 30th anniversary of the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series a series of tremors rock the city all the while the Turtles and company are being hunted by Karai and her Foot Ninja along with a new mutant assassin named Tiger Claw.

With Donatello, April and Casey Jones trapped in the Dimensional nexus the remaining Turtles must mount a rescue of their Mentor Splinter from the clutches of The Shredder.

While the others fight to rescue splinter Donnie and his group discover that the Kraang have been transporting Monstrous Worms from Dimension X to ""Milk"" for the Mutagen necessary for their Terraforming plot.

The episode ends with the Turtles reunited, Splinter saved and Karai beginning to believe that Splinter not The Shredder is her father.

As the episode ends Michelangelo ponders the fate of the missing Kraang worm. Meanwhile in a parallel reality another version of the Turtles enjoy a pizza when a portal opens up in the street below releasing the very Worm from earlier. Suspecting Foot involvement the Turtles leap into action with a triumphant ""Cowabunga!""

Note: The episode title is ""The Manhattan Project"", not ""Wormquake"".",1394928000,3,1181,5.098445595854923

2836839,5,B000P72PU6,"This is not like the 80's show, not really.  The turtles all have the same characteristics like Mikey being goofy and Leo being the leader. But the background story is different, its a bit darker and therecare new characters.  Its a great show but not really for the younger ones.  I have a 4 year old niece that loves the turtles but there are only certain episodes she will watch because some are kinda scary...especially with the mutants and the Krang.",1436400000,,455,4.592592592592593

2836851,5,B000P72PU6,"The writers have gone above and beyond with this series.  If you've purchased the first three volumes of this series on instant video and haven't gotten around to buying this one for yourself or your kids, you won't be disappointed.  This batch of episodes kicks off with Shredder returning from Japan bringing with him a fierce assassin.  We also discover the origin of the mutagen, meet several new characters, and there are quite a few nods to the original Turtles toon along the way.  It all comes to a head in one of the most amazing season finales I've ever seen on TV.  The stories are thrilling, captivating viewers of all ages.  Parents, this is one heck of a show to watch with your kids if you enjoy family TV time.

  The only problem I ran into was waiting about a week after the season finale aired on TV before amazon made the episode available.  However, when I notified them concerning the missing episode, it was added to this list around five hours after my inquiry.  Here's hoping Amazon decides to add the next season of this hit show.  I recently switched off my cable to save money, and instant video is my main source for new Turtles episodes.  This sure beats paying $170 per month for a score of channels I never watch.",1412208000,3,1245,4.504464285714286
2836852,5,B000P72PU6,"I used to watch the cartoons in the 90's, saw all the movies and bits and pieces of the other iterations.  The other reviews say it all-- I think this the fullest and best version yet.  The balance between episode and series plot is perfect.  None of the characters are flat; they all grow and change through the various situations they encounter.  The drama is compelling and the slap-stick is very funny.  The balance between them is a wildly unique achievement, of which I can't imagine another show being capable.  The whole mutagen/dimension X mixes with ninja's in NYC can really go anywhere...and it does.  I also love all the references and throwback moments to other versions of the series (and the 80's and 90's in general) for those of us who have been on board a while.  Nicely done folks!  My hat's off.",1412121600,5,816,4.611111111111111

2836854,5,B000P72PU6,"The second half of season 2 is still a pretty awesome show! Unfortunately, this is volume 4 and I'm so tired of these split seasons.",1411084800,3,132,4.32
2836855,5,B000P72PU6,"I love this series. Such a great fusion of new storytelling, humor, themes, and technology with elements of the old cartoon that I grew up with in the '80's. I cannot recommend it enough.",1410998400,,187,4.529411764705882

2836860,5,B000P72PU6,"This latest incarnation of The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles takes huge strides forward this season with the addition of same classic villains and friends, as well as some new twists and turns! You definitely don't want to miss one minute of this action and laughter packed season! T-U-R-T-L-E Power is still alive and well!",1409011200,,323,5.0
2836861,5,B000P72PU6,This iteration of the Turtles has the right mix of comedy and action.  The art is way better than the old Turtles cartoon.  The only negative is the small amount of episodes per season.,1408579200,,185,4.411764705882353
2836862,5,B000P72PU6,"Great show! I like the changes made from the original story. This version of the turtles makes much more sense than the others, which makes it much more enjoyable. I watched this with my son and we are hooked! Has lots of humor and strong story line. They do look weird at 1st, but you don't seem to notice it much after a few episodes.  I normally hate the annoying anime thing cartoons sometimes add to a characters face when making an strong expression, But I got used to it really fast, and the show makes up for it with an amazing plot.",1407196800,,541,4.252427184466019
2836863,5,B000P72PU6,"I'm impressed by the series' progress.

2836865,5,B000P72PU6,The turtles just keep getting better.  This show is thus far the best iteration of TMNT,1406073600,,87,4.4375
2836866,5,B000P72PU6,"I have seen all of the TMNT tv shows and movies over the years, but when I saw the new one on Nick I decided I wouldn't like it based on the design of the turtles. Until, here I was waiting for the new movie to come out and, like a turtle junkie, I had to have something. I was reading some of the episode descriptions and found that they sounded decidedly different for what I had imagined for the series. I purchased the first DVD with the thought that I'd watch it and be done with it. Oh no, I had to go and fall in love all over again. I purchased the remaining DVDs and binged watched them all in two days.

This is now my favorite TMNT incarnation out of everything. At first I didn't care for Mikey's high pitched voice, but he grew on me quickly. I think I like this one more because they are taking things in a different direction. The turtles are falling in love, making bad mistakes and, at times, forsaking the other turtles for themselves and the girls they care about. The turtles are truly injured at times and there is more drama and thought out plot lines that kept me watching episode after episode. I even cried a couple of times, which I never do. The one liners are hilarious and had me laughing hours later. Mikey will always be Mikey, girlfriend or no girlfriend.

But don't get me wrong, this is still a kids show with some cute elements and sweet caring moments between the Turtles and Splinter. There are more caring scenes between Raph and Leo than shows in the past, which I liked to see. Raph is still angry Raph and he appears to be the one most scrambling to keep his brothers the same even while they are changing. The scenes between Raph and Mikey are both hilarious and endearing and I love watching them torment each other.

Donnie is completely different here. He's a more prominent character than before, probably because of his romance storyline. Leo is still Leo, but even he is struggling with his feelings and fears as he grows. Splinter is my favorite Splinter out of them all. I even took some of his advice for the Turtles to heart in my own life. So, if you feel that turtle itch coming on, be sure to check these guys out. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1405209600,4,2207,4.326086956521739
2836867,5,B000P72PU6,"My daughter's mouth was open the last 7 minutes of this episode. Don't want to give away spoilers but she feels this is one of the best episodes.

As the last scene was shown before the credits, she was like ""I can't WAIT for the next episode to see what happens""

Hoping this episode leads to a toy release of a critical character that has been lacking.",1404691200,,354,4.268656716417911
2836868,5,B000P72PU6,"This series has managed to maintain its high quality, most likely because its created by people who care about the property, and who know that adults are also watching.",1404691200,,168,4.827586206896552

2836872,5,B000P72PU6,If you like the real comic you will like this series.  I personally believe this is what Eastman and Laird would have produced if they had made a series.  It is pretty dark at times.  The stories are good and solid all around.,1401321600,6,226,4.209302325581396

This series seems to be better for the younger age group, but if you are unsure buy one and watch it yourself first.
