8105387,5,B000E3LD7W,"Works fine for my needs. The Jazz Crusaders were pioneers of smooth jazz. Years ago, I played with bands but I quit gigging because I had a family and I didn't like the life. However, I didn't want to give up my instrument, so I continue to play on my own. For an outlet for my work, I have a big screen TV and play along with concert videos to give me the feeling of playing with the band. I also have a home recording studio where I make my own music using my primary instrument, bass guitar, a keyboard synthesizer to give me a variety of instruments and congas. Therefore I can immulate an entire orchestra on my recordings.",1360281600,,628,4.241666666666666
