5861957,5,B00DWGOKSM,Teepa Snow is an amazing teacher.  We have been dealing with this disease in our family for years and I learned so many things I wish we would have known sooner.  Any family member of a Lewy Body Dementia patient could benefit from this even if they are not the actual caregiver.  She gives so much useful advice on how to help them and how to deal with your own frustrations.  She also makes it clear how Lewy Body is different from Alzheimer's and the other dementias and the special circumstances that family and caregivers need to know.  It was well worth the price.,1405555200,3,570,4.4423076923076925

5861959,5,B00DWGOKSM,Found this video on Lewy Body Dementia by Teepa Snow extremely helpful in understanding my dad's current  behavior and in preparing me for what is to come.

5861965,5,B00DWGOKSM,I struggled trying to understand how my sister could be so awful one minute and herself an hour later. This class helped me and her caregivers give ourselves a break from failure. LBD is a hard disease and this session helps one recognize it and hints on how to treat it and deal with the person suffering from it. What a relief!!!,1386720000,3,331,4.354838709677419

8598752,5,B00DWGOKSM,"Teepe Snow's DVD on Lewy body Dementia was a godsend. I felt like the medical community (doctors, nursing homes, etc) could not give me instruction on how to properly deal with what was happening to my father even though I kept asking for help, classes, anything to educate me about what I should do to help my father. Anyone who has a loved one who is in the early stages of any type of dementia needs to watch her videos ASAP. My biggest regret is my family didn't know about these DVDs 5 years ago.",1509840000,,501,4.28421052631579

8598757,5,B00DWGOKSM,anyone struggling with care for a friend or relative with Lewy Body Dementia needs to watch this...it helped us SO much to understand my mom's situation since this is a disease the medical professionals we first had didn't seem to have a clue about or how to support us in her care...Teepa is entertaining but that is as she teaches the all important issues related to caring for folks with this disease. She role plays both person with LBD and caregiver so it makes it real and very helpful.
