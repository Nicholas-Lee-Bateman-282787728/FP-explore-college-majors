8325527,5,B000OFMINS,John's methods are spot on.  We have raised three wonderful sons using his time-tested advice.  The clothing and hair styles on the DVD look dated but the material never gets old.  Thanks John!,1415836800,,193,4.787878787878788
8325528,1,B000OFMINS,"What a great colorful cover! It led me to believe that the lecture would be punctuated with humor, visual aids,perhaps some illustrative video clips... Instead I found an incredibly dull, overly simplistic approach to discipline, delivered by a smug so-called expert, who told drawn out tales of an idealistic era- half a century ago! He stands on a curtained off stage in front of an audience of zombies. Zero action.  I agree with his premises for typical children, but the title led me to expect much more than it delivered. However, it did cure me of insomnia for two nights!",1213833600,2,579,4.79
