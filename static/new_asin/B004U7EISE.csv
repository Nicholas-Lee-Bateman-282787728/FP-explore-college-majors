4466582,5,B004U7EISE,WONDERFUL and MUST SEE MOVIE of it's time....,1415059200,,45,4.75
4466583,1,B004U7EISE,Corny.,1414800000,,6,6.0
4466584,5,B004U7EISE,liked it nice family movie,1412121600,,26,4.4
4466585,1,B004U7EISE,Not what I expected.,1406764800,,20,4.25
4466586,4,B004U7EISE,Ok movie.  Orphan's christmas was a bit corny for my tastes.  Did like outcome of Joe Santa Claus.  This was better of the two movies.,1393718400,,134,4.28
4466587,5,B004U7EISE,"I really enjoyed watching both these movies.

Joe Santa Claus is about a man whose department was downsized and was told that his new job would be to play the part of Santa Claus. He didn't want to be the Santa Claus and tried to pass it on to the janitor, but the boss told Joe that the janitor was not expendable and too valuable to the company. The janitor was helpful to Joe, though the janitor wished he could have had the opportunity to play the Santa Claus.

The Orphans' Christmas is sort of like the ""Annie"" Movie, but with a little buccaneer twist to it.

Both movies were a delight to watch.",1388188800,,602,4.2631578947368425
4466588,5,B004U7EISE,"Joe Santa Claus is story how The Christmas Spirit can truly change a persons heart once that person begins to participate in giving during the Christmas season.  Joe was a much better person after working at being the store's Santa.

The Orphans Christmas is another example how Christmas and some well meaning rogues can change a persons heart for the better.",1387065600,2,360,4.885245901639344
4466589,4,B004U7EISE,"Add these two to your holiday classics list. Actually two movies under one listing, each has an old-fashioned holiday charm Well worth watching if you enjoy holiday classic films of this genre. (I do.)",1386288000,2,201,4.9411764705882355

It's priceless!",1367107200,3,284,4.64

4466597,5,B004U7EISE,"Ouitstanding, nostalgic, family oriented Christmas Story!",1417910400,,57,8.666666666666666
4466598,4,B004U7EISE,These two classic vintage tales aren't fantastic but they are heartwarming.  And at Christmas time heartwarming is good.  Enjoy!,1417824000,,128,5.684210526315789
4466599,5,B004U7EISE,Great old time tv,1416700800,,17,3.5
4466600,3,B004U7EISE,It was ok. Nothing outstanding. Both films were old and I had never heard of them. That's the reason I viewed them. Both were alright but nothing I would recommend,1416441600,,163,4.466666666666667
8441240,4,B004U7EISE,Not bad for an older less sophisticated movie.  Still enjoyable.,1483747200,,64,5.4

8441244,5,B004U7EISE,This was a kick. Im sure I probably saw these movies before they were cut down so small. They certainly made me think of the movies I watched as a kid before color tv.,1481328000,,167,3.9411764705882355
8441245,4,B004U7EISE,nice short movies to see.,1478304000,,25,4.2
8441246,4,B004U7EISE,"The first video in this set, Joe Santa Claus, was disturbing in the message. The character of Joe was a man of his time, but a stubborn, hard-nosed and ignorant one at that. I saw absolutely nothing cute about a man who demands absolute control of his wife's existence to the point of walking out on his family because she somehow exposed him to public ridicule by earning $5.00 for babysitting. This, of course, would reflect negatively on him. He was happy that his child was born a girl, because that meant that she would never have to worry about anything but making some guy happy. Really? I had no idea that ISIS celebrated Christmas. All this was made worse for me because the wife had left Germany after the war. This was not a representation of another era. It is abuse. Quite disturbing all around.

The second video was fun and uplifting, with a cute pirate teaching an old sourpuss not to deny orphans a good time at Christmas -- or any time. I really did adore that film, and loved seeing some of the old TV and B-movie players at their very best. The second film is definitely recommended and will put a smile on your face.",1477872000,,1137,4.440191387559809
