8548537,2,B00A8ZZ5IE,"A slow and depressing movie not unlike a prominent strand of Russian filmmaking. The bulk of the movie consists of an older man and his middle-aged son preparing his young, corpulent dead wife for a home-made funeral. This consists of building a pyre next to a river, followed by the unceremonious dumping of her ashes into the water. (Purportedly, part of the Myrean tradition which they follow.)  Nothing much is communicated during the trip to the river, except for the older man's ""smoking""--revealing rather obscene details of his love life with his late wife. Only the ending contains an element of surprise, although its details are kept rather cryptic. I found the whole movie somewhat crude and thoroughly unappealing, eliciting in me more than once feelings of disgust. I definitely do not recommend this movie. 2 stars.",1476576000,,830,5.0583941605839415

8548540,3,B00A8ZZ5IE,"If you're in the mood to be depressed and somewhat bored, this is just what you've been looking for. Imagine a place where the best you can wish for is asphyxiation by drowning. Well that's where this movie takes you. And is there a reason for this gloom? Not really other than maybe to pine for the lost Soviet Union. An upside is that not all the nude women in the story are dead.... although they may as well be. The director found a way to make sure that no audience members would become aroused. Apparently, according to the vision of this film, having sex holds about the same low level of excitement as laying on a slab, waiting to be cremated. So if it's so bad, why does this rotten tomato get three stars? I give it credit for interesting cinematography, and for it's poetry which I admit is actually quite good. If I was a pretentious douche, I certainly would have given a five star rating, but since I'm genuine, it comes down to three stars.",1379289600,2,955,4.370786516853933
8548541,5,B00A8ZZ5IE,"Easily one of the finest films of recent years, SILENT SOULS is profound yet modest, serious yet funny, idiosyncratic yet truly universal. It will take you to another world.",1361750400,7,173,5.0
