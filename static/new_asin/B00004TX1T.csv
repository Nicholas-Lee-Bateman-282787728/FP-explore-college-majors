Officially the WORST movie I have ever watched in my entire life and I am a huge movie buff from commercial stuff to foreign films. I love odd movies and some cheesy old B movie stuff. But this is TERRIBLE. I'm still not certain how I even got this movie. I think someone who doesn't like me very much threw it into my DVD collection. Seriously I have no clue how i got this movie. its 80 minutes of your life that you will never get back. The dialog is terrible, the acting is tragic,  the score and cinematography are even worse.  I certainly would never pay for this dud. It is on Amazon Prime so you could in theory watch it for free. But honestly do not waste your time. There are so many other Awful cheesy fun movies to watch like the Bermuda Depths that have at least some redeeming qualities the only quality this one has is it might be recyclable.",1491436800,,914,4.15819209039548
7923153,1,B00004TX1T,Very amateurish. Watched enough to see it contains sex and adult language. If there's any nudity or violence it came after I stopped watching.,1454371200,,142,4.958333333333333

7923155,1,B00004TX1T,"Contrary to the one prior review this isn't like Lynch or Kubrick at all. It was a piece of garbage from the word action to the word cut. Un-sexy sex scenes and front-wedgie phone calls pop up in one of the most scattered editing jobs I have seen in film. If there is a single good thing about this film it is the choice in some of the songs used, but even that was spotty.",1441670400,2,373,3.986666666666667
