7793573,5,0949906778,"Calvin Smith delivers a largely qualitative presentation on the hopelessness of the hypothesis of evolution in accounting for the origin of life and information it requires. This turns out to be a strength as many highly complex areas are covered, each containing sub-topics which the viewer is left to pursue further depending on their interests.

The power of the material rests in its logical argumentation, common-sense delivery and the alignment of contemporary observed evidence to a literal Biblical worldview. The atheist will be left without the crutch of materialism and so without excuse before a moral Creator and His absolute standards.

For the Bible-believing Christian a number of key concepts are worth meditating on to strengthen apologetics, namely:

-Evolutionists must confine themselves to matter and energy in explaining everything, yet information is not material.

-The existence and requirement of nanomachines to all life, whose blueprints are coded for in DNA, the origin of which is a mystery for evolutionists.

-Information, most completely defined as a code or language, is completely divorced from the medium it exists in. Professor Werner Gitt's three principles of information are worth memorising.

-Special creation of man from raw materials (i.e. dust) is very rational, given humans (clumsily) do the exact same thing when creating complex machines from raw materials.

-Mutation as the key driver for information creation is devastated by how DNA stores information - forwards, backwards and overlapping, meaning a single point mutation is likely to do great damage.

The viewer should be fascinated with the subject matter and spurred on to further study.",1368316800,,1696,5.496153846153846
