4246755,2,B0041XSC4I,"Someone told me this was a nice opera/ballet for children so I got it for my 6 y.o grandaughter who loves Coppelia, Swan Lake, The Nutcracker, The Magic Flute, Hansel and Gretel and the like.  She hated it, and later I watched it also to see what it was all about and if possible, to elucidate the reason for her reaction.  The dancing and singing are all right but the music is not Tchaikowsky's most inspired and the plot develps slowly, and is convoluted and quite boring.  No wonder I had never heard of it before !",1313020800,,519,4.329896907216495
4246756,5,B0041XSC4I,"To start with, THANK YOU ROH

I have actually heard this opera for the first time ever, and am enthralled with it. I am NOT bothered whether the Tenor hits brief awkward cadential flourishes up to high D and then up to high Eb (!). I just loved this production for what it was.

According to me, if one wants to analyse why this opera has not been one of the regulars in Russia, I feel it is because there exists not one piece that stands out like the Polonaise in Eugine Onegin or the waltz from it, and/or the standout pieces in Nutcracker or Sleeping Beauty.

BUT

On the whole, the Opera is outstanding in its sustained good mood and optimism, right from the beginning to the end. I am not going to nitpick if the girls were straining or singing to the gallery, or if the tenor was adequate. I am only going to declare that IF this production were not produced in the ROH at the right time, ie, NOW,this Opera might have had to wait for a much longer time to make its mark in the general listening public that love Opera, Ballet and Music in general, without bothering if there are awkward cadential flourishes up to high D and then up to high Eb (!)

I am not going to say, MOVE OVER Nutcracker or Hansel and Gretel. No. The Opera is not good enough for that to happen. BUT, It is an Opera that gives a ""Feel Good"" effect with the type of Music consistently pleasant and enjoyable without depressing downsides or philosophical episodes. It is just a 'pick-me-up' type of an opera that has been, yes, neglected over the years.

WHY NEGLECTED?

Like I said before, there is no one piece in this opera that is a stand-out piece. After Tchaikovsky finished all his revisions, there was no room for it, considering the popularity of his other works in Russia, and after the Revolution, it could have become embarrassing for the powers that were, to stage it with Catherine the Great as the ultimate source of power, Royalty.....that the Soviet Regime could not stomach.
To add to that, Russian Operas were not too well received in the richer parts of Europe to start with and then the Americas, with the exception of Mussorgsky, Korsakov, Borodin or Tchaikovsky, who all had works of much greater substance than just a 'feel-good' pleasant opera as this one.

THANK YOU ROH AGAIN.

This is the time to try and popularize this opera, that comes a close second to Hansel and Gretel and even the Nutcracker as something that could perhaps, with a little sympathy and understanding could become a big hit.

The world of blu ray and DVD belongs to US. The music lovers who are not exactly musicologists.....these works are written for US, and not for the run-or-the-mill nitpicking critics....

Do not bother what the aficionados say. It is a beautiful Opera, and even if Tchaikovsky was exaggerating about its quality (the best he has composed etc), it is still worth it. Don't forget, even Beethoven declared his 8th Symphony as being better than his 7th. It may sound a little jarring, but, ultimately, both works are regarded very well.. Perhaps it is the same case with this Opera.

Just Buy it, enjoy it, and forget about whatever the other critiques or I have written about it.

And again THANKS ROH.",1302134400,10,3202,4.547826086956522
4246757,5,B0041XSC4I,"Others have written ample detail about the singers, story, and quality of the music, so I won't rehash these aspects.

One reviewer said that a work should be examined in it's various components. I totally disagree. One should start by considering the production as a whole. Depending on the type of work, were you entertained, or were you intellectually stimulated. Was the work and it's performance well-integrated? If everything ""works"" and is uniformly consistent, I will probably enjoy it more than a performance where ""soprano x shone out in the performance', because this means the production became a show-case for the singer rather than a production that bring all aspects of the composer's work to the fore.

Could this be a forgotten masterpiece? I don't know, I was too busy being enthralled by the sheer joy of the opera. This is not Don Carlo, nor is it Eugene Onegin. This is Tchaikovsky letting his hair down, and writing a lighter opera-based work derived from traditional Russian opera in what appears, at times, to be unsophisticated, but in fact was paying a a lighter weight homage, in some aspects, to the more serious operas of composers like Mussorgsky -- but don't take that comparison too far!

The singers sing in the style of those Russian works, using the vocal style of the period, and should not be compared to singers of Verdi etc.

For me, this was a close-knit production of an opera that was written purely to entertain, not to edify. The performance was so idiomatic, it could have dome from the Mariinsky. It is a combination of opera and ballet and visual spectacle, presented with music that 'worked"". In some ways, it almost could have been a Ziegfeld production (again, don't take the reference too far). If you are an opera lover, who doesn't want to have the leading lady dying of consumption every time, then buy this. Wonderfully staged at Covent Garden, you will have a very enjoyable 2 and1/2 hours of entertainment. Sound and vision are both impeccable,",1294272000,14,2001,4.859237536656892
4246758,4,B0041XSC4I,"A great masterpiece this is not. Tchaikovsky composed better operas. Still, this production by the Royal Opera is worth for the theatrical spectacle. The stage, the colorful scenery and the Ukrainian folkloric designs are beautifully done. The ballet and the Cossacks are delightful. As for the music, with better singers it could have been somehow better. The biggest disappoint is Grivnov's Vakula. His voice is not big enough for this role and it gets lost. A stronger and fuller voice would have been much better. Still, the overall production is entertaining and nice. For an opera that won't be produced often, buying and watching this Blu-Ray disc is worth it. I enjoyed it and had a good time. Just don't expect to discover a masterpiece.",1293926400,5,746,4.976
4246759,3,B0041XSC4I,"To write about Cherevickhki at any length would amount to an act of arrogance on my part. This is an opera about which I knew nothing; why did I purchase it? Well, I enjoy Tchaikovsky's two more popular operas, Onegin and Pique Dame, have more than a nodding acquaintance with Mazeppa and know Iolantha from its two recordings. A chance to get to know another of his operas seemed like a good idea so I took the plunge and decided the risk was worth the investment.

Those who have already written about this work quite obviously know the opera and have responded with somewhat negative comments. I can only bring about seventy years of listening and collecting opera recordings and my comments, alas, are also negative. But first my reaction to the work itself. I believe that Tchaikovsky to be a great melodist; there is ample evidence of this in all the the works that I know. Unfortunately I found little of this in the opera under consideration. At no point does it ever seem to take flight. That the composer himself is fond of the work is not uncommon; more than one composer has lamented that his ""favorite"" work is not shared by the public at large. The Gogol tale is one that the composer himself enjoyed but he seemed to be unable to bring it to life musically. God knows the director, the set designer and the costumer have all done wonderful jobs. the stage is alive with exuberance and action but in the end it is the opera which has to speak to the auditor and make the characters come alive at least while you are in the theatre.

Not helping matters, the vocalism is less than ideal. Oxana requires a lyrico spinto and Vakula a spinto tenor. Neither artist delivers performances of any distinction. The soprano has good basic material but she has problems which have never been solved. There is no evidence of evenness of tone and emission. Frequently she is shrill when under pressure. She is reminiscent of many of the Soviet singers from the seventies. Our hero tenor is crude and insensitive. I can be more forgiving for the host of characters singers whose contribution is more dramatic than vocal, but so much of it is provincial that it becomes more than little arduous to listen for any length of time.

It gave my little pleasure to write as I have and perhaps others who share my ignorance of the work will be will to take a risk and come away with a different reaction. I take my hat off to you.

Now please, a DVD of Iolantha.",1292716800,13,2455,4.510112359550562
4246760,4,B0041XSC4I,"Splendid visual production - wonderful sets, costumes & dancers. But the score is less-than-first-rate Tchaikovsky & the singing is less-than-first-rate too. Let me recommend a musically more rewarding opera based on the same Gogol story: Rimsky-Korsakov's Christmas Eve, composed several years after Cherevichki. Rimsky's folk-inflected score is less sophisticated than Tchaikovsky's, but filled with delightful melodies.",1291593600,10,422,6.553571428571429
4246761,5,B0041XSC4I,"I enjoyed every minute of this opera.  I loved the sets and costumes: the interior of the Ukrainian house had such pretty painted decorations all over--- quite inspiring, i should do something like that.  The costumes were bright, pretty, although not artistically great for fashion ideas.

I value the psychological veracity of the encounters between the girl and young man; exactly right, bites true.  It sounds like someone wrote down every word of a real-life dialogue.  I loved the ethno-social-psychology seeing how the Ukrainian girl reacts in  this situation.

I thought the set designer did a wonderful job of translating Gogol's writing into visual terms.  Although i have never read this story, i have read some of Gogol's writing in Russian.  It seemed to me that some of the visual set fantasies gave the feel of Gogol's style, the surreal leaps and gravity-free excursions of imagination.

I did read the other review by Noam Eitan who did read this story in the original--- wow! i learned a lot from this opera and from that reviewer.

I'm not a musically-trained person; i watch operas for sets, costumes, drama, literature, psychology, especially.  Afterwards i couldn't remember anything about the music, although during the performance it seemed fine, nice.  I didn't notice any of the vocal flaws that Noam Eitan describes.  I disagree with his opinion that an obscure Russian opera shouldn't be performed in England ---- the cast was mostly Russian or Ukrainian and it felt and looked so.",1291334400,15,1509,5.05668016194332
4246762,5,B0041XSC4I,"The other reviewer as per this date (November 27, 2010) has written a rather masterful and complete review of the ROH production of this rare Tchaikowsky opera, and I will not quibble with his personal observations. Yet, I cannot grade this issue as low as he does, for a number of reasons. In my opinion it deserves a resounding ""five stars.""

Like him I can only present my very personal views and impressions, based on my ""discovery"" of CHEREVICHKI (the Rozhdestvensky/Dynamic performance from Cagliari) several years ago. At that time I only knew it through a few vocal excerpts from the ""golden age"" of Soviet singing. As I wrote in reviewing the Dynamic CD issue, I was bowled over. I immediately acquired the Preiser re-issue of the 1948 Melik-Pashayev (with a star-studded cast including Georgi Nelepp, Alexei Ivanov, Maxim Mikhailov, and Elena Kruglikova). While, arguably, the old Bolshoi performance is the best sung one on CD disc, sonically it suffers from the common handicap of numerous recordings made during the period by the Soviets: constricted sound and severly limited range. For me, then, the Rozhdestvensky remained the benchmark--I must have listened to it a dozen times within the first two weeks after purchase. I could not--and I cannot--erase the delightfully folkish, national melodies it offers up.

Then, the news that Opus Arte would be releasing an actual video representation of the very rare Covent Garden production, well, that really excited me. And, finally, when it arrived last week, I was not disappointed, not at all!

I will not go into any depth regarding the vocal qualities or singing of the principals in the video production, except to say that they all acquit themselves admirably, some better, some less so. I had no problem with anyone in the cast. I would agree that the Oksana on the Rozhdestvensky--Ekaterina Morosova--may be slightly more fluid. But Olga Guryakova isn't bad, and is quite acceptable to my ears. More so, the Vakula, Vsevolod Grivnov, I found to have a rounded and warm voice that capture's Vakula's music very nicely. He is certainly as good as Valerij Popov on the Rozhdestvensky CD set. Ognovenko on the Dynamic/Rozhdestvensky is a fine Chub, but I also liked Vladimir Matorin just as well in the ROH production. Other cast members, on both the video and the Dynamic, I think, compare favorably.

What really argues for the purchase of this DVD is ""seeing"" CHEREVICHKI, seeing the interplay of the diverse and wonderful charaters. Mikhail Mokrov, the set designer, has opted for some delightfully and artfully  traditional painted sets and backdrops that convey the colorfully rustic spirit of the Ukraine and Old Russia. There are wonderful thematic connections between most of the scenes, and stylistically they enhance the understanding of the magical storyline. Indeed, CHEREVICHKI combines the world of myth, fairy-tales, myth, and tradition, into one magical and overhwhelming experience. Director Francesca Zambello has skillfully staged the work to illustrate beautifully these aspects of the work, and, as a result, CHEREVICHKI really does come alive on stage. All the the various characters---the Devil, Vakula, Oksana, Solokha, Chub, the Mayor, the Schoolmaster, Prince Potemkin, the lesser imps--all seem to genuinely ENJOY what they are doing, from the dancing, the funny pranks, and the delightful interplay with each other. I caught myself, alternately, smiling, laughing, and/or being deeply moved by the stage action. I cannot say that for a lot of recent opera productions!

The interesting notes for this DVD issue assert that Tchaikowsky thought it his best opera. After both hearing it and now seeing it, I can understand why. Is is a neglected masterpiece? The answer must be a resounding ""yes""! I thoroughly enjoyed it, in fact, I've seen it through now several times, and plan to watch it again...and again. It does not grow old. The magical aura that Tchaikowsky invests in CHEREVICHKI is contagious and is fully caputured by this release. I recommend this production very highly.  We are unlikely to get another production of it any time soon. Thus, my highhest rating.

The add-ons, including commentary by Zambello on the sets and direction, are interesting. Both picture and sound quality are fine.  Five stars for this much-awaited release!",1290816000,43,4344,5.185449358059914
4246763,4,B0041XSC4I,"Tchaikovsky's Cherevichki is very rarely performed outside Russia. When Elaine Padmore was in charge of the Wexford Festival Opera she had the work staged there in1993 (also directed by Zambello). She decided to bring it to the ROH, where she is currently the Director of Opera. We are extremely fortunate to have this work performed in a major house and taped, particularly considering we weren't so lucky with the ROH not taping Matilde di Shabran with Florez in 2008 (oh, the heartache...) nor the MET taping Shostakovich's sleeper ""The Nose""...

There are three audio recordings of this opera, all better sung and two better conducted than here. This production was not a success with the critics or the public. I initially was not too impressed with this Blu-ray and posted a mostly negative review, but I watched it for the third time last night, almost 8 months after I first viewed it, and I was in heaven. By the time the festive theme from the overture returned in the concluding chorus I literally had goose bumps. This is a gorgeous, lavish, colorful production despite two gaping holes in the casting: the Oksana and the Vakula. Mikhail Mokrov's sets (with painted backdrops and a set piece) and Tatiana Noginova's costumes are bright, folkloric, nave and old- fashioned. The incredible array of colors is quite striking on Blu-ray. There is a significant ballet component. The Royal Ballet dancers are incredible and turn the heat up to ecstatic levels. The divertissement in the lavish grand ball scene is spectacular, with gold candelabras, an enormous golden effigy of the Tsarina, Cossack dancers emerging from beneath her skirts, bringing the ball to a climax with a Ukrainian hopak, earthy foot-stamping antics, back flips and other crowd-pleasing tricks. It gets better still and the ensuing Finale is a life affirming orgasm of joy.

All the roles in this work require considerable stamina, particularly the 3 major ones: Oksana, Vakula and Solokha. Oksana's role in particular is exceptionally challenging - in act I scene 2 the role has awkwardly written excursions above the staff with uncomfortable approaches to those high B's, and yet the tessitura spans all registers. It also requires some coloratura agility - Tchaikovsky gives her two brief awkward cadential flourishes up to high D and then up to high Eb in act II scene 2, mercifully cut here. On top of that Tchaikovsky's orchestration covers the voices a lot (Rimsky-Korsakov never does that) - you need a healthy big girl voice here. Olga Guryakova is a fine singer; I last heard her in the lighter role of Maria in Mazeppa at the MET in 2006, where she sounded much better than here. On this performance every time she has to compete with the orchestra she pushes and sounds shrill. In the few sections where the scoring is not so heavy she relaxes and you can hear that she basically has a nice timbre, but the role is too heavy for her. Francesca Zambello's introduces Vsevolod Grivnov (Vakula) in the extras as ""a heroic young tenor from the Bolshoi"" - he sounds like a lyric to me and he has to work hard to be heard. But these roles are very difficult to cast. It's one thing to cast a performance of a rare opera for a festival production in a small venue with small voices, but big dramatic voices are becoming rare. For a singer to take on a new role requires a tremendous investment of time, energy and money. What are the chances of a singer to earn back the investment on very rarely performed works like this? With the end of the Cold War and the internationalization of Russian singing, a Russian singer who is good enough to do justice to these roles would prefer to concentrate on roles that provide a more reliable source of income. Some of the greatest Russian Divas today hardly touch the Russian repertoire.

Larissa Diadkova as Solokha is superb. Sergei Leiferkus as His Excellency is one of the high points of the performance, with his refinement and style. Vladimir Matorin's Chub gives a hint of the gutsy, earthy Russian sound of yore and lore (he's a 7 feet tall bass.) All the smaller roles are cast of strength. Alexander Polianichko is doing a fine job keeping together all the elements in this complicated score.

It took me three years to get to admire this opera. If you do not like it you are in good company. You'll easily find a lot of negative comments about it on the internet. Even Rimsky-Korsakov thought he could do a better job with this story and composed his own version (""Christmas Eve"" - 1895). I wonder why it took me three years to ""get"" this work. I think the reason is because it poses casting challenges that are met only on one recording. There are 3 recording of this opera: Bolshoi 1948, Fedoseyev 1974 and Rozhdestvensky 2000. The Rozhdestvensky is the most easily available and currently the only one with a multi-lingual libretto. Rozhdestvensky was a great conductor up until 1980; from that point on something died in him and everything I've heard him conduct from 1980 on is very disappointing, his 2000 recording of this opera included. That recording (the 2000 Rozh) received great reviews on Amazon - more power to those who enjoyed it. I wasted a lot of time on it and I feel he made a very bad case for this score with his square and lifeless approach completely lacking in dramatic impetus, lyrical grace or comedy. The only set that does justice to this score is the Fedoseyev 1974; you immediately hear how everything falls in place when the singers are up to the challenge. Fedoseyev recoded three operas in the early 70's - let me quote from another Amazon reviewer, V. Stasov about these wonderful sets: ""Snow Maiden, or Snegurochka, is another of Fedoseyev's great Russian opera releases on the Relief label, along with Rimsky's May Night and Tchaikovsky's The Slippers. Ideal singing, conducting and sound quality make this trio among some of the finest recordings of Russian operas ever preserved for public consumption. Unfortunately, they are almost impossible to locate, and suffer from unavailable translations of their librettos --- In the case of The Slippers, I purchased Rozhdestvensky's recording, which can't compare to Fedoseyev's. But it came with a libretto.""

The chorus of women opening the finale lists Ukrainian delicacies that are translated in the subtitles as ""lots of good things."" This is good enough if you want to get the gist of it and are not familiar with or interested in Ukrainian cuisine, but some viewers' interest in this opera may be part of a wider interest in the local culture, and that includes the cuisine. The women actually list ""vareniki"", ""galushki"", and ""vatrushki"" - look it up. I have fond memories of the made-from-scratch-varenikes parties my grandmother used to throw - I'll never eat the likes of them again. I am not sure whether it is clear in this production that there is a standoff developing here between then men and the women. The men are getting a little rowdy and this serves as a contrast to what happens between the young lovers. A little later in this scene the chorus of men sing what is translated as ""Let's go and have a drink at the inn/It's nice and cozy there...we can have mead, vodka and beer, porridge and sausage too..."" Here I suppose there is too much text to follow, but what they sing is more like: ""If you want to drink honey, come with us to the Jewess's inn/The Jewess has got black eyebrows as high as horseshoes...we can spend money there/the hostess has lit the lamp and warmed the house, set the table/the Jewess is rich/she's got honey, she got brandy, beer/you ask and you drink...all you need is to open your purse, etc."" This scene gives you a piece of history, sociology and psychology of the period. The men can assert their manhood and independence by choosing to forgo their wives'/mothers' cooking and have their fun at the inn. They can stick it to the women and choose what they want to eat, rather than give the money to their wives and submit to what was decided for them that should be served for dinner. The women have to contemplate the loss of badly needed funds and their husbands preferring another woman's, a stranger's cooking over the fruit of their hard labor. And the Jews are in the middle. This is not in the original Gogol story and it's more revealing then a chapter in a history book about the place the Jews occupied in the economic structure of that area. The ""Let's go and have a drink at the inn"" chorus is unique and Tchaikovsky (or anyone else) never wrote anything like it. You have the men chorus divided into 2 groups - the tenors and the lower voices. They alternate quickly with one group singing a longer phrase punctuated by short interjections from the other group, then they enter one group shortly after the other and overlap, then switch and back again - all this at a neck breaking speed. You won't be able to hear this on this production or on two of the CD sets - only the Fedoseyev set gives you this little gem as written in all its glory.

Finally, in act I scene II, when Oksana's (Chub's) storybook cottage with its snow covered white roof is pushed forward (22:29 minutes into the performance) I see it on my screen in 3-D, particularly when I wear my (regular) glasses. This happens every time that cottage appears with its white roof. This isn't a 3-D disc, nor are my player or monitor, but the cottage and everything on the screen do seem to jut out of the screen into the room in 3-D - strange.

This reencounter with this opera induced me to read the original Gogol story again. Its charm was lost on me when I first read it years ago, but upon rereading it I could appreciate its unique mixture of incongruent aspects of Russian culture and psyche. The librettist, Yakov Polonsky, and the composer seem to have been drawn to the ""folkloristic"", rural, low class element of Russia meeting the Aristocratic element with charmingly innocent results. But the real Gogol, the specialist of Russian ""poshlust"" (vulgarity, banality, sham) is expunged from the opera. I don't know if this is because of social class (Count Nikolai Ilyich Tolstoy was also unable to perceive or describe any ""poshlust"" in the Russian human landscape) or a character thing with Tchaikovsky. The funniest episode in the original Gogol is towards the end, when the women start arguing if the blacksmith has drowned or hanged himself. This escalates into a brawl that is vulgar, crude and funny. It's a dramatic situation that practically leaps from the page to the stage, in a story that is otherwise very difficult to shape into a stage drama. So how was this scene presented in the opera? It was left out (R-K did use it in Christmas Eve). There are many dark shadows in this story, usually just hinted at and staying in the background, like when the Zaporozhtsy Cossacks, coached by Potemkin, approach the empress Catherine the II with the intention of making a very serious request that alludes obliquely to their oppression, only to have the blacksmith seize the moment to inquire about her ...booties! Tchaikovsky's opera has none of this (R-K did use it in Christmas Eve and it got him in trouble). The last words spoken in Gogol's story are: ""See what a caca's painted there!"" - hardly fit for a theatre with Imperial patronage. It seems that all these little comic elements in Gogol's short story would have come across as subversive and inappropriate under the magnifying glass and intensification involved in a stage drama.",1288483200,16,11510,4.746253746253746

As far as this production is concerned, Francesca Zambello did her usual good job; the sets were fun but the singers, oh what can one say about them?  They all had that Russian style of vocal production, sounding half constipated.  The poor lead soprano had no high notes at all, sang every one of them flat.  That voice could peel the toughest wallpaper off the walls.  The tenor had the most annoying vocal quality I've heard in a long time; one wanted him to just shut up.  The rest of the cast, well you know Russian opera, lots and lots of basses but these guys had long since passed their peak.  As far as they were concerned, it was difficult to even determine what note they were trying to sing.  The orchestra was the best part of the performance.  And the acting, oh my, I have not seen that old style of Russian acting in many years.  I cannot imagine why the Royal Opera imported these singers.  I'd have rather heard it sung in English with young singers from their opera school.

8413215,5,B0041XSC4I,"This recording of Tchaikovsky's Cherevichki (Tsarina's Slippers), recorded in 2009 at the Royal Opera House is, to my mind, a valuable addition to the operatic repertoire on disc. The opera was Tchaikovsky's own favourite but failed to take off during his lifetime despite his time spent creating 3 versions, this being the last. The opera has not entered the regular Russian repertory since and is generally unknown world-wide so this is a good chance for it to make a break-through.

Unlike Eugene Onegin or the Pique Dame this opera is much lighter fare and like many previous Russian operas it includes ballet and dance sections. As such it could be considered as part of a previous Russian tradition that was gradually coming to an end. Nevertheless, as this production shows, it is certainly worth watching and it provides a most enjoyable experience on its own terms.

Essentially the story is set at Christmas time and concerns a good hearted witch, Solokha who is the focus of attention of several men, attached and not, and also the Devil who also finds her very desirable. All of this is treated very light-heartedly. She has a blacksmith son, Vakula, who is in love with Oxana who is the very attractive but self-aware daughter of widower Chub who is one of Solokha's admirers. Ultimately Oxana agrees to marry Vakula so long as he is able to give her a pair of shoes such as worn by the Tsarina. This he is able to achieve by snaring the help of the aforementioned devil. During his absence Oxana fears that Vakula has killed himself in despair and regrets rejecting him. Upon his return all is forgiven and their marriage is arranged without further delay. This is a happy ever after story of complete fantasy along the lines of a fairy story and a far cry from Tchaikovsky's two tragic operas.

The setting of this production created the fairy-tale element by adopting stylised backdrops and props of a minimalist but highly colourful design. This seems to be totally appropriate to me as realism seems unnecessary. The costumes, on the other hand, are a clear attempt at proper Russian dress of the period and are suitably lavish as regards the nobility and nationalist as regards the villagers and dancers. In total this is a very convincing production with the right emotional feel.

The solo singing cast is essentially Russian and this extends to the four Cossack dancers. There are several Russian dances such as a Gopak and these are well-performed by the Royal Ballet. The Royal Opera chorus clearly enjoys this musical adventure too. The mood is celebratory in feel. Larissa Diadkova is the excellent witch and those who are familiar with Prokofiev's equally fantastical Betrothal in a Monastery/Gergiev/Mariinsky will not be surprised to hear that her earlier sense of humour as the nurse is fully apparent here. Vakula is excellently sung and portrayed by Vsevolod Grivnov and the Devil is entertainingly portrayed by Maxim Mikhailov. The rest of the cast are equally at home with their respective roles and everyone seems to be having a really good time on stage. This comes over unmistakeably at the final curtain calls and makes for a satisfying shared experience with the audience.

The orchestra is on top form under the guidance of conductor Alexander Polianichko who expresses his own puzzlement at this score's rarity.

There are several extra features including an introduction to the work and also to staging Gogul's world (the writer of the original short story). The booklet is also very clear and informative. The recording is fully up to the usual Opus Arte standard with involving camera work and crisp imaging of good colour depth and definition. The sound is full-ranging and clear. It is presented in both DTS 5.1 and stereo options.

This is a thoroughly enjoyable entertainment which is unlikely to be challenged by alternative versions for quite some time. Fortunately the performance is of very fine quality in every respect and nothing unacceptably is attempted with the production which is very imaginative. The audience clearly loved the excursion into the unknown. It seems very possible that this will be the reaction of many future purchasers and therefore it seems completely reasonable to rate this with the full 5 stars.

In summary therefore, I would suggest that for anyone wishing to explore this very enjoyable musical byway within the operatic world, this disc warrants very serious consideration indeed.",1352160000,4,4466,5.001345895020188

This is a fairy tale opera and thankfully it had a fairy tale staging. I am glad that so many of the leads were sung by Russians as I think that they are more authentic vocally. Russian opera is not Verdi so the listener should not look for the same type of singing. You really can see the Tchaikovsky was a master of many musical forms -- This opera includes some excellent ballet music - espcially the Cossack dance. Also some of the musical interludes demonstrate the composers mastery of the symphony as they are symphonic in nature. In all this opera shows off the versatility of Tchikovsky as a composer.

Much of the music is based on Ukraininan and Russian Folk music as the opera is set really in Ukraine. The sets and costume are beautifully done and all based on Ukrainian and historic Russian design.

While the singing may not compare with the beauty on the Bolshoi recording - it is more than adequate and I found Vakula excellent in the role. All the singers are excellent actors which adds to enjoyment.

If you have not hear this before, it may take some getting used to. There is no question Russian Opera is very different than Italian Opera and take some serious listening to a lot of recordings to appreciate.

We are took used to hearing and seeing only Evgenni Onegin, Pique Dame or Boris Godunov. They are not typiczl of must of the great repertory of Russian Opera. And unfortunately too few companies have the singers to even attempt other than the major pieces.

I hearily recommend this recording and think you will enjoy it as muck as I did.",1348012800,3,1757,4.492163009404389
