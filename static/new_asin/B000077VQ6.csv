As soon as i saw it on DVD i knew i had to own it.  lets put it this way, if u don't mind profanity and a few racial comments, and even if you do, this is 2 of the funniest hours of comedy ever.",1037836800,3,350,3.5789473684210527
1801057,5,B000077VQ6,"I have just ordered this Robin Williams DVD.  Why?  Because I saw his live performance (sitting in the 4th row) in Cleveland, Ohio, shortly before this HBO show was taped.  I get a kick out of reading some reviews where the people say they ""almost"" peed their pants from laughing.  I DID pee my pants, and thought I was having a heart attack.  Mrs. Doubt Fire this ain't.  For the TRUE Robin Williams fan, this is the ultimate.  This man definitely is certifiable.  I agree with a previous reviewer...when he starts with the water bottles...well...gee, ya gotta see it...and...you shoulda been there!  I can't even begin to tell you about the Gorilla or the outrageous final bit.  Believe me, ADULTS ONLY!",1037750400,16,705,4.75206611570248

1801059,5,B000077VQ6,"I saw the special when it aired on HBO and I couldn't wait until I was able to buy it on DVD.  I laughed so hard, I fell off the couch and peed in my pants at the same time.  I've never seen him funnier, and the fact that it was uncensored only made it better.
He makes fun of everything and everyone--Canadians, sports, Parliament, even Olympic security.  And look out when he starts to use those bottles of water on stage as a prop (trust me, you don't want to know).  Having this show on DVD will only make it that much better.  You can experience Robin Williams' truly twisted mind over and over again.",1037404800,15,606,4.189655172413793
1801060,5,B000077VQ6,"Its been too long since one of comedy's geniuses has done a standup routine, but now the wait is over. Robin Williams explodes onto the stage, telling jokes at lightspeed, getting laughs everytime. Packed full of both extremely creative and outrageous humor, Williams once again proves that he is the king of stand up. He train of thought never seems to break, as he jumps in and out of dozens of characters. Despite the fact his jokes include lots of physical movement, this routine is not recommended for children, due to the adult humor and language. A 5 star congratulations to Mr. Williams and this outstanding routine!",1037145600,8,624,4.841121495327103
1801061,5,B000077VQ6,I saw this when it was on HBO and was delighted when I heard it was comming out on DVD. This is a great routine that we all enjoyed so much. This is definetly for the adults only. Not at all something for the kids like Robin's older movies. There is a lot of swearing and explicit material so be forwarned.,1037145600,8,306,4.032786885245901
1801062,5,B000077VQ6,"Raw and Hilariously Funny From Start to Finish!
Just when you think Robin Williams has reached his peak, you're pleasantly surprised that he's outdone himself again.  Robin's portrayal of both man and animal in all their pride and fancy in diverse settings has you out of your chair with laughter.  Robin is rawer than I've ever seen him, however, his talent and genius demonstrates his unique ability to make you laugh.  A must view for all his fans, both old and new.",1037059200,,469,4.695121951219512
1801063,5,B000077VQ6,"Robin Williams' laugh-riot HBO Special is a no-holds-barred comedy classic and a fitting document of the greatest funnyman of our generation.  A master of fast and furious storytelling and 3-dimensional characters, Williams' genius is on full display for nearly two hours.  The comedian's charm is evident - he leaps from joke to joke, each bit infused with warmth, irony and his now-trademark stream-of-consciousness dialogue.  He draws on contemporary themes and hits every punchline like a concert pianist at the peak of his form.  Never before has Williams been so accessible or hysterical and this special guarantees unlimited guffaws and side-splitting routines.  He's sweaty and raunchy, childlike and mature all at once.  Parents may want to save this DVD for personal viewing, since some bits are drenched in wicked adult humor, though Williams never offends - he gives his all and succeeds.  Best of all, the Broadway event gets better on repeat viewings (rare as that is for comedy)so that like Lucille Ball before him (think grape-stomping, vitavitavegimin and chocolate assembly lines) the bits he delivers renew themselves time and time again.  If laughter is lacking in your life, do yourself a favor and spend two hours with the Oscar-winning master of comedy.",1036886400,124,1276,5.282178217821782

1801081,2,B000077VQ6,"(Review date 3-23-2017) long after Robin's passing.
I can understand the sides that people love Robin Williams. I too am a stand up comic (not famous - yet).
Many were shocked by Robin's suicide. (I am a self-help person) - I saw years before - that his psychological unraveling was right out there to see.
Though most seemed to think it was all pure talent. I saw a person Desperate for help and really struggling.
Talent?? Sure - plenty of it - but even more he was mentally unwell. I know an actor who starred in a movie with him - and has lots of good things to say about Robin. And I'm not just speaking in general about him - my focus Is on this DVD.
I Can't stand (or sit) watching Robin going off on his tangents. Rambling - shouting - Swearing!!
Beyond obscene. In Robin's performances - more is Lost than Gained.
Comedy is an art form - and is therefore subjective. I know most love Robin and miss him.
I get his 'comedy style' - it's Not for me. 85% of what I see - is a tormented person who was imploding.
I know from interview - he had a kind heart - and meant well. - It's just that when someone is ill like this -
it jumps out at me - and I Can't pretend it's not there and not killing them. I Don't find it entertaining.
Whatever happens in the afterlife - I hope he is well and at peace. - And has the Love he deserves. Scott M.",1490227200,3,1345,4.06015037593985

1801105,5,B000077VQ6,Robin Williams was a comic genius. This video is the proof. With his manic style topics get covered quickly and the range of topics covered is amazing. Watched it twice in a row and was still laughing during the second viewing,1487376000,,226,4.536585365853658
1801106,5,B000077VQ6,"My husband had old VHS tape, so I upgraded for his birthday.  The tape was about worn out.  One of his best performances I've ever seen. I laughed til I cried.  Think he must have been on something.  But if you've never seen this, you should. Though some of the material is now outdated, it's still worth the watch.",1487376000,,315,4.288135593220339

1801109,5,B000077VQ6,"Oh man,this stand-up performance is almost too perfect.i grew up & was born in 1990 so I remember all of the movies Robin Williams was in that I loved as a kid (Toys,Hook,Ms Doubtfire,Flubber,Jumangi)And I always knew he was funny. But let me tell you...this right here isn't for kids ! I saw it when it was first aired on HBO when I was like 13,it was hilarious. Robin Williams covers everything here,from Michael Jackson,Judism,Jesus & Christianity,Drunk people,drug people,Bin- Laden,Errectile Dysfunction,Sex,plastic surgery,etc. The list goes on & on.this is a true genius,doing his thing & it was completely live & on the spot. About 1 and 1/2 hours long,and riddled with profanity and adult humor jokes,so this isn't something your kids should watch,unless your kids are cool & you're cool parents. It's a true shame that Robin is no longer with us but this is the peak of hilarity & he does it all flawlessly in less than 2 hours. This is seriously hilarious and a must not miss. So please,go get thos,it's also available on. 2 cds,but trust me the DVD is better cuz ya don't need to switch discs nod show,plus ya get to see his bodily movement and language. Please don't dismiss it,this is genius hilarity and spot on accurate jokes. I need not say more,get it !
Rest in Peace Robin Williams",1485648000,2,1300,4.756637168141593

1801111,4,B000077VQ6,I watched this when it originally aired on tv  a long time ago and it was so funny to see. So long after that I saw it on DVD in town and regret not buying it when I had the chance. I managed to find it on Amazon though and added it in to boost to free shipping on an order and it was fun to watch again after all these years.

1801129,5,B000077VQ6,"If I could give this 6 stars, I would.  I think one of his best live performances, a virtual non-stop stream of consciousness rant that is absolutely brilliant.  Makes you realize even more now that he's gone what we've lost.  I don't know how many times I've seen this throughout the years, but I still laugh as hard now as I did the first time I saw it.  I've bought other copies for people, too.

When I have a bad day, I can just conjure up parts of this in my mind, and it'll make me smile.  I will never understand how someone's brain can work that fast and be that funny.  After he died, it was fascinating to learn about the man behind the comedy, and about his kindness,  You would never think that someone so outrageous would be so introspective, quiet and gentle in real life.  He was, and I think still is, one of the most brilliant comedians ever, and this live show was perhaps the best example of that talent. Even watching the kind of dorky Mork & Mindy will remind you of how great his talent was.  I can't imagine how the people on that set ever got a take as written from him, or how anybody working with him kept a straight face.  Would have loved to seen a blooper reel.

This would be a worthwhile investment because it's something you will no doubt watch many times if you are a Robin Williams fan.  It never gets old..",1471996800,4,1342,4.2362204724409445

Robin Williams also went out prior to the show to the people in the nosebleed section and gave them the front row seats usually reserved for A list entertainment executives.  The show is all new material except for the joke about Ted Turner (I live in Georgia, so I had heard it).  I had just purchased the DVD when the news came out of his suicide.  It simply breaks my heart that we will never get to hear that impromivisional work again.  He was more that simply the greatest comic actor of his day, but the parts he played as the bad guy simply creeped me out, as they were supposed to.  Buy this DVD! It will pick you up on the most cloudy day.  Yes, it has the usual ""earthy"" acting and profanity.  You will not regret purchasing this DVD",1409011200,,887,4.295180722891566

1801409,5,B000077VQ6,"I saw this when it first came out more than a decade ago. I just watched it again tonight in the wake of Robin William's death last week. Right before watching this, I watched his WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION show. Both were done for HBO live before an audience. Much as I enjoyed the WEAPONS show, this one is probably his masterpiece. For one, he is eight years younger, 50, and he is still in good health. In fact, he moves like a thirty year old. He moves almost like an acrobat or a dancer. He owns the stage and the audience. He holds us rapt for two hours, no intermission, and that is just about unheard of in stand up. It would be hard to pick a piece I liked best because I loved it all. I hate sports in general and I even loved his sports routines, especially the golf one.

Some reviewers comment upon parts of the show are blue humor. I don't think Williams was ever known for absolutely clean comedy like Jerry Seinfeld. Few stand up comics are able to pull off completely clean stand up. So if this is something you require, stick with Seinfeld. But Jerry Seinfeld, much as I enjoy him, is no Robin Williams. This is a stand up comedian at the peak of his powers and no one, absolutely no one, could touch him for sheer talent.

1801452,5,B000077VQ6,"Warning to new viewers:

Both versions are vulgar.  If you've seen A Night At the Met, you know this is his style.  If you have not seen a Robin Williams stand-up, this may be surprising to you.  I've seen some reviews objecting to the vulgarity.  Well, that's him.  For those who compare his movies to his stand-up, movies are scripted by other people even with his improvisations.  A great example is Bob Saget.  His stand-ups are hilariously vulgar, but he is best known for his fatherly character in Full House and hosting AFV, both of which are more PC.

Opinion of Stand-up:

Until I lost it (looking to replace it), I owned Robin Williams: Live 2002.  It's a 2 disk version of this stand-up.  It is a more streamlined version of this stand-up.  If you find this to be a bit too erratic, then you may prefer that version.

However, I love this version!  The problem is I know the Live 2002 version so well that I do notice the difference in the jokes.  Some punch lines are better in Live 2002 and some are better in this version.  I do like this one.  And you can tell this one is uncut, which I like.  It is almost like being there instead of just watching something cut for performance.

Also, if you watch it now, much of the jokes are based on events of the time like most comedians.  I saw some reviews complain about that.  Well, it is not like he can foretell the future. (He's not Miss Cleo. :-P )

I wish he would do another stand-up!",1378771200,,1450,4.308550185873606

1801482,4,B000077VQ6,"This is NOT Mork from Ork. Nor any other Robin Williams you would expect to see on TV. Still, it is an HBO special, so in some sense it was on TV.

Robin comes out on stage and there's about a dozen plastic water bottles on a table in the middle of the stage. I'm thinking, what is he on Xtasy or something that he needs all that hydration. Well, he does drink a good bit of it, but those bottles are props. In fact, some of the best jokes of all involve those bottles.

Much more sexual in nature than one would expect of such a show, or at least this one. At first it starts off pretty slow, and I was hampered by not knowing a lot of the names of people he mentioned. But the body jokes, the vocal imitations and accents, all sorts of good Robin Williams style humor from the locker room side of his personality eventually had me laughing almost uncontrollably. The one about Viagra was about the funniest of all, but there are hundreds of zingers in this hour and a half show. Oddly, the cover calls it over two hours, but they must be counting the pre-show backstage part (not all that amusing) and the post-show part, which I didn't watch.

Do not expect Williams to be Politically Correct. But he's what my friend Richard calls an equal opportunity offender: he'll poke fun at literally anyone.",1336867200,,1301,4.323770491803279

His sarcastic wit, humor, hyperfast thinking, impressions and physical comedy are great.

The only thing I found slightly distracting was the amount of water bottles on the table. He goes to the water too often and it at times seems to interrupt the flow of the show.

Robin Williams has been in the top of the comedy game for over thirty years and there is a reason for this; he is one of the funniest people in the world.

1801510,5,B000077VQ6,"Robin Williams is a brilliant stand-up comic, a highly original talent who gives an over-the-top, irreverent, profane, iconoclastic, hilarious performance. It's a very funny show. Williams is alone on the large stage, his only prop being a small table loaded with bottles of mineral water. He is constantly gulping and spilling water while he sweats profusely. The bottles are used at times very comedically to demonstrate various functions.
Williams has a myriad of targets: the haughty French, President Bush, Osama bin Laden, the augmentation of body parts, cats staking out their territory, Viagra, the child molestation scandal involving priests, various churches and denominations, his own hairiness, etc. The list is long. His delivery is rapid-fire, frenetic, and sometimes too hectic and too harrowing. He is trying hard, sometimes working too hard for laughs, but he almost always hits a homer.
It's definitely not for the kiddies or for the prudish or linguistically timid. Little is sacred. It's a very visual, animated type of humor which relies on his actions as well as his words. An audio version would not do it justice. He's crude; he's coarse, but not as wild in his use of profanity as George Carlin. He returns to certain themes and riffs with the French coming in for extra jabs.
It's a broad type of almost slapstick humor that doesn't seem as satiric as just plain funny. He'll do almost anything for laughs, with the visual often topping the linguistic.",1215388800,,1478,5.08641975308642

Williams really gets into his roles when he performs his skits.  If Williams wasn't so good at imitations then I don't know what would be so humorous.  His cultural characters are so hilarious, I just about cried.  I would have never guessed that Williams would be so vulgar, but sometimes you have to jump outside the boundaries and laugh at what you're missing.  Robin Williams is one of the funniest men on the planet, and this film is one of the best displays of his talent.  Any Robin Williams fan must aquire this work of art.  It is one of the best movies he's done.  If you enjoy stand-up comedy then view this titan.  Live on Broadway truly raises the benchmark of American comedy.",1212105600,2,838,4.594594594594595

1801533,3,B000077VQ6,"Robin Williams is the usual ball of energy with great impressions, rapid-fire jokes, and is definitely funny, but even having seen his stand-up in the past, I was shocked by how foul his language is in this performance.  This is definitely an adults-only performance, but I have always considered gratuitous and constant profanity the domain of less-talented comics who can't make people laugh without swear words.  I was disappointed to see a comic genius like Mr. Williams deliver such a performance.  Luckily, we rented the disk--I would not wish to own this one.",1193011200,16,566,5.064516129032258
1801534,1,B000077VQ6,"Robin Williams use of constant F-words in this video & Broadway performance is inconsistent with his intellectual stature, comedic brilliance, genius-level creative skills, imagination, sense of humor, sensitivity towards others, and financial success.  It's also disrespectful of Broadway, which traditionally has higher standards, I've been in Broadway audiences.  Richard Kiley, Katherine Hepburn, the cast of Cats, Angela Lansbury, and others, did NOT use the F-word in almost every sentence as Robin Williams does in this performance.  Andrew Lloyd Webber's music and lyrics contain NO f-words and his work is beloved by millions.

I strongly suspect Williams off-tv use of cuss words is a bad habit leftover from the early years of his career and insecurity, it's time his mouth was as mature as his body.  Or, maybe he overestimates how few people actually enjoy bad language.

Either way, the Robin Williams style which made me laugh hysterically while watching him on ""Actor's Studio"" on Bravo for 2 delightful hours is not present in ""LIVE on Broadway"".  Williams owned the whole tv audience without a single cuss word, the DREAM OF EVERY COMEDIAN, proving he doesn't need filthy words anymore.  I shut off this video midway and returned it for a refund.  It's language is needlessly abusive.  Save your money.",1192924800,19,1320,5.2727272727272725

Bush getting caught up in stressful situations, Texas, prescription drugs, cats, and how golf was invented(which was one of his more vulgar but hilarious performances).  In all a very funny comedy performance from Mr. Williams who has the gift of using his movements accurately with his intelligent and hilarious, gut splitting dialogue. The reason for the 4 stars is because this DVD version of his act I have noticed edits out splices together parts.

It was a good kind of exhaustion.  I  recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys laughing, really hard. There is no one in public life who is immune from being picked on by Mr. Williams - and he takes you out of the ordinary hum drum life and makes you laugh at yourself and everything going on around you.

1801597,5,B000077VQ6,"It's quite funny reading some of the 1 star reviews, as the argument that is mainly given there (""How come the man who gave suburbia Mrs. Doubtfire can do filthy humor as well? My goodness...yikes!!!"") has worked for me precisely in the opposite direction. I never used to like Robin Williams much because I found him in the movies to be too much into ""wholesome American family entertainment"" [Mrs. Doubtfire etc.], so to me he used to be rather boring. Wow, what a difference this DVD made. My wife and I were on holidays and rented this DVD from the hotel library a few days ago. I did not expect much, but joined in for a few minutes anyway whiloe she started watching it. And whew, a rather different R.W. from what I had expected appeared. Very very funny jokes coming from his genius at the rate of probably a few dozens per minute. Some of it was too fast for me (English is only my second language) but what I caught was extremely funny. A word of caution though as other reviewers have alluded to already: you must be able to take adult humor in a good way, otherwise you would probably find many of the jokes on this DVD very rude. But if you can take that, this is an amazing 2 hours of non-stop stand-up comedy which is 180 degrees away from soppy Mrs. Doubtfire stuff. I will probably buy the DVD to watch it again (to catch the jokes that I had not been able to catch yet...:-)Highly recommended DVD.",1147305600,2,1415,4.363636363636363

So how do I discribe this: Top Notch, First Rate, hilarious comedy for people who do not mind 'things being discribed as they are'... Not suited for 'uptight' people (but hey, that's their problem!)

Why do I only give it 4 stars then? Simple:  I live in Belgium, why do we have to try to find and buy a region code 1 DVD-player?

Also don't miss the Special Features. One, call NOISES, is all the times Robin makes a noise during the show compressed together - one of the funniest things I've ever seen.

But if you can handle these characteristics of the man, you will find this a representation of humanity, obviously with American and comic twist, explaining the complex world we are living in.  It was 2002, when America was beginning to get over 9/11, and Michael Jackson and Martha Stewart were making news again.  Robin pokes fun at religion and the southern lifetsyle, long traditions which have mixed messages in modern times.  Robin is great with accents from all over the world, but he seems to despise the French the most.  While I myself love the French, have slightly different political views, and have more modesty, I think Robin is one of the funniest and most entertaining people to watch on stage.  And the stage is Broadway, which gives Robin every freedom.  This is not something to watch every night, but for the laughs it is worth purchasing.",1124755200,6,980,4.7976190476190474

1801621,5,B000077VQ6,"Robin Williams may be one of the most brilliant (or at least natural) comedians alive.  All you have to do is put the spotlight on him and he's off, overflowing with jokes, one-liners and side-splitting stories that can go on for hours without hesitation.  It makes perfect sense then, that when William took his act to Broadway, he made a killing with his raw, nonstop standup, providing a much-needed barrel of laughs in a world still feeling the effects of 9/11.

Live on Broadway is one of the latest showings of Williams' brilliance as an actor and comedian.  Not only does he prove himself to be gifted in pulling humor out of the air at a whim, but he's also very knowledgable, observing a wide range of current events, history and culture while mocking them relentlessly; with Williams, no aspect of society is safe from lampooning...including himself.

Robin Williams isn't cheap in earning his laughs either.  The 51-year old bounces across the Broadway stage with such energy and passion that the sweat is practically pouring from his body.  If his jokes and anecdotes aren't enough, Williams provides his audience with physical comedy as well, and he takes it as far as he can go.  It's just another attribute reinforcing Williams' comedic genius: he doesn't even have to be talking to keep the laughs coming.

Perhaps the only thing that may count against Williams is the very thing that is his strength; as far as comedy is concerned, he's boundless.  Williams is hilarious, but at his best he's also uninhibited, and some may not be able to stomach his explicit, maybe even controversial approach to matters of the world, or whatever is going on in his head.  It's best to sit back and watch this show with an open mind, or else you're probably going to leave it feeling disgusted or offended, rather than rolling on the floor in laughter.  Williams probably wants you to think as well as be entertained, but try not to think too hard if you do.

The decades may have passed, but Robin Williams is still one of the funniest men alive, and this act proves it.  As long as you're not offended by explicit material, Live on Broadway is a standup routine you cannot miss.",1112400000,9,2182,4.707894736842105

Robin Williams however does not work for me, I love his movies, almost every single one of them: comedy and drama.  I do not like his stand up because he moves at such a frantic pace that he doesnt really have a stand up routine it's like a kindergartener who gets up on stage and only tells the punchline of the jokes but does it at such a rapid pace that you cant help but  smile...notice i said smile and not laugh.

Just watching Robin taking some hilarious shots at some key members of the Bush cabinet and of course, Bush himself are among the best ones delivered.  Not a single breath is wasted on that stage.

He is extraordinarily quick on the uptake and as always he is a brilliant ad-libber.  The highlight for me was ""Scotsmen and Golf"" (""I put a ball in a gopher hole!""), done in an absolutely dead-on Scots accent.  I've been a fan of Robin since the ""Mork and Mindy"" days, and although he's now a respected Oscar-winning actor ""Live On Broadway"" is a excellent reminder that he remains one of the best stand-up comedians ever.",1104710400,4,845,4.727891156462585

1801633,4,B000077VQ6,"This was my first exposure to Robin Williams as a standup comic, and this ""Live on Broadway"" act certainly makes up for all those mushy sentimental movies that he had starred in before this special. He lets loose here in a sustained comic bout of Williams-style voice impressions and sharp observations and adult jokes that I've never had the pleasure of witnessing in any of his movies (except, maybe, in small spurts). As a standup comic, he might not as smooth a performer as George Carlin (my personal favorite) is onstage, but Williams' energy makes up for a lot, and even makes otherwise stupid jokes make you laugh hysterically. (You know how you can tell he is expending as much energy as humanly possible in this show? By the huge amount of water bottles he has on stage.) His material is not as focused as some of the best standup comics, but I rather liked his improvisatory style---he goes from one thing to another in record time, giving his performance a nicely chaotic feel. (A lot of his best bits, mostly dealing with politics, are delivered quickly and randomly and then dispensed with.) And yet all of it flows together nicely (even if some bits are inevitably better than others).
So what's the problem? I think perhaps 99 minutes or so of one man comically riffing about anything and everything is still perhaps a bit too long for its own good. I've watched this on more than one occasion, and by the hour mark I always feel myself getting rather exhausted by Williams' highly energetic schtick. It is not necessarily that his material starts to become significantly weaker or repetitive (although his French-bashing does get a little tiresome after a while), but while you still marvel at Williams' energy level...I dunno, I just kinda got tired of it on some level after a while. Williams' energy may not flag, but ours does...at least until he rebounds at the end with some good bits about American sports and then about sex, particularly Viagra. Believe me, when you see his take on Viagra, you will laugh hysterically in spite of yourself.
In short, for me, ""Robin Williams: Live on Broadway"" is a mostly brilliant but perhaps overlong standup comedy piece (a standup comedy ""epic"" if there ever was one). It would have gotten five stars as a more focused hourlong show; instead, this one sprawls until we in the audience start feeling a little exhausted by his endlessly energetic (and highly profane) style. And yet there is enough brilliant stuff here---his riffs about the war in Afghanistan and homeland security rival the best, and overall there are plenty of small but great bits here and there that will grab your attention---so that this is definitely worth seeing. Certainly you will be amazed that Robin Williams actually pulls the whole damned thing off at all. Recommended.
NOTE: I have seen ""Robin Williams: Live on Broadway"" as it first premiered on HBO, and for some reason it is slightly longer than the program that appears on this DVD. It is beyond me why CMV Home Video thought it necessary to make some small cuts to the program for this DVD edition. (For instance, it cuts out a lines during the parts where he cracks humorously about Michael Jackson and the Enron scandal.) At least, though, the program is not significantly cut (it's only missing about a few seconds worth of material from the initial broadcast), and overall it is very much intact. (Besides, HBO and its other channels have been showing this marginally-cut version of the program on its stations ever since, anyway.)

However, and as much as it pains me to say it, this Broadway DVD just isn't all that great. Sure it had all the usual Williams trademarks: madcap break-neck delivery speed, tangential associations and throw-away characterisations, but it just seemed to me that the major laughs (and even the minor laughs) were few and far between.
I think Williams got carried away with his total freedom (being live and uncensored) and so he wasn't forced to work that hard. Too often, he relies on profanity or 'adult' subject matter to carry him through and get the laugh, and while I've got nothing at all against him using explicit language, it should be supporting the material, not distracting you from it. Sometimes, watching this DVD was like watching Robin simply swear and rant for a couple of hours, and while this may tickle the funny bone of many people out there (many of the reviewers here for instance), he's too talented and hilarious a comedian to waste like that.

The problem with Williams (and also another sad man who fancies himself as a stand-up talent, Steve Martin) is that he is very one-dimensional and does not have a clue about delivery skills. He just sizzles on stage, yelling for two hours, and some people consider it a great comedy. No it is not. It is a village circus act, shallow and primitive, no matter how many films this man has done. Real comedy - with razor-sharp timing and polished delivery is comedy by Bill Hicks, Dennis Leary, even David Cross.
Williams' material is only average. There is nothing wrong with poking fun at Dubya - but it's the easiest type of comedy. There's no achievement in doing another Bush routine, not more than there would be in another airport routine. It is just plain lazy and unimaginative. And even if you MUST include George W Bush, there are imaginative ways to do that, otherwise you are in a league of talentless pathetic men who mistake ideological zeal for talent and Micheal Moore, the saddest of them all, is your standard-bearer.

  Robin's comedic strategy (and most of us are aware of this) is to bombard the audience with a machine-gun tourette of material in hopes that everyone will get hit with a laugh at some point.  Unfortunately, unlike most polished standup commedians, he fails to make (or at least sustain) a genuine connection with the audience and ride it out to the shows completion.  If you have the stamina and the attention span to keep up with this frenzy of forced humor ... give it a go.
  And try not to notice the insane amount of water he drinks (about a tenth of a teaspoon every other joke for the entire hour and a half set) because that may distract you from keeping up with the whirlwind.
  Now obviously i didn't think this was all bad.  i still gave it two stars.  There are a fare share of laughs in the set.  There is also so much material that if you watch it again, odds are you'll have forgotten a few jokes.  And there is a charm and to delight the robin williams persona that deserves to be recognized.

Still, it is great to see him back on stage and when he finally gets rolling, the show's a blast.  His legendary quick stream-of- conscious delivery clicks in and he transforms himself into an amazing variety of characters - a French ice-skating judge, German doctors, Scottish golfers, Jamaican bong-smokers, and Donald Rumsfeld.  And, despite many of the complaints here, its good to see Williams get a little raunchy, he's been too squeaky-clean for too long.

the various passages between segments, when you feel the show can go anywhere and sometimes it does so, or the interview in the extras speak to williams's knack for improvisation and to his raw responses to the immediate--some mishap at nypd earlier in the day or the presence of a canadian in the audience makes for  great jokes ('what's canada but a loft on top of a big garden party?'). such ability, to mesh canned content with improvisation, makes williams an all weather comedy-artist and this dvd is an ever fresh and undeniable proof to this.

For example, he makes fun of Donald Rumsfeld giving a press comment as follows: ""I don't know where.  I don't know when, but something terrible is going to happen"".  He then makes reference to the CIA being the Central Intuitive Agency.  Perfect!  Because we've all sat there and watched Rubsfeld say those speeches and we've all thought, ""well duh"".

For two non-stop hours, Williams leaps from joke to joke as he races around the Broadway Theatre's stage trying to catch up with himself. Every joke builds on the last, and by the end of the show Williams could simply sit down on set and it would be funny!
Celebrities beware, as Robin Williams targets everyone from Keith Richards to Tiger Woods. He talks of cats marking their territory, Congress responding to the anthrax scare, Frenchmen playing baseball, and snowboarders smoking marijuana, among hundreds of other outrageous topics!
This DVD matches Robin's energetic and remarkable performance with 5-star sound and video quality, and includes enough extras to satisfy one's appetite. The hidden easter egg on the disc is not one you would expect, but is hilarious none the less.
After recent roles in serious dramas, and slapstick children's comedies before that, Williams returns to where he is most at home, on stage and telling everyone what he thinks of the world!
The must have comedy DVD of the decade, Robin Williams: Live on Broadway is sure to please everyone who watches it. So, for two hours of gut-wrenching laughter and excitement, pick this one up now!",1056153600,5,1262,4.985781990521327
1801667,5,B000077VQ6,"Robin Williams is in his fifties, and still has more energy than most people half his age.  Live on Broadway is a hilarious performance, with subjects ranging from Martha Stewart to Wearing Fur to cats to of course, George Dubba Bush.  He is still lightening fast with his improv and moves on to a joke even if you are still laughing at the last one.  He doesn't give you time to think about any minor inconsistencies or any over exaggeration of his facts.  He is purely a comedian exploiting the topics of the day.  Some timeless, some that won't matter the day after you hear them.  It doesn't matter, just listening to him will make you smile and sometimes, fall on the floor laughing until you cry.  Williams is the king of his craft, no one comes close to his wit, intelligence, insightfulness...and down right lunacy.",1055376000,2,823,4.595890410958904
1801668,5,B000077VQ6,"There was a time when people paid to watch Williams do stand-up and not dress up as housemaids or lend his voice to blue genies.  It's been so long that you might wonder if he can compete with the current market, a market saturated with riffers and comedy hacks on every channel of every hour of every day.
Suffice it to say, Williams has been taking keen notes and has spent a LOT of time in his bathroom mirror.  The magic of the set lies in its incredible length, his intensity sustained over said length, the audacity of doing the entire thing as a live broadcast, and the pure comedy of his observations.  This man infuses a minute of material with more references and force of caricature than even Dennis Miller...no stranger to the dense and witty monologue.  Williams remains accessible, fresh and pounds the stage with his presence.  Personally, I found the material better than anything he's ever done, and his chops are not only razor-sharp, but his own.  There's a lot of comedians out there covering the same material (and a lot of them the same, dry way), but nobody is raking Michael Jackson, American bedroom foibles and Scottish people over the coals quite like Williams.
A couple of special sidenotes for anyone out there tired of contemporary comedy albums of late:
1) It's long, so you get BIG bang for your buck, especially at the speed of which he delivers.  If he spoke at the monotonic rate of the average Comedy Central comedian this would be a four hour set, so you get a lot of jokes in a lot of time.
Also, because of the length and density of the material, this set has great replay value.
2) There are no songs parodies or muscial selections.  HALLELUJIAH!  Leave it to the old schoolers to show you that when it comes to the stage, you better be able to make 'em laugh with nothing but your brain and maybe a random water bottle.",1055376000,,1860,4.511904761904762
1801669,4,B000077VQ6,"I'm a big fan of stand up comedy... mostly on British humour, since I find that more exhilarating than American toilet jokes (Margaret Cho needs to go).  But Robin Williams pulled it off very well with ""Live on Broadway"" and has never been funnier!
Problem is, I've seen it before.  Most of the topics he goes on about is an echo or enhancement of another comedian 4 years earlier:  Eddie Izzard in his show ""Dress to Kill"".

He is such a masterful comedian..he just takes you on this strange trip and once you have tuned into his brand of comedy....man! He touches on many subjects like Politics, Sports, Age, Religion, Personalities, Relationships and Ethnicity. Pretty standerd for any comedian right? But give him a listen...you will have a whole new perspective on things. His bit about how the Scottish invented golf is too funny and by far the the best piece on here. If you don't get offended easily buy this one instantly you will not regret it.

1801680,5,B000077VQ6,"It's been a while since Robin Williams got back on the stage to do comedy standup.  And it was a long wait that was well worth it.
Robin's take on the politics and people's self image is very hilarious.  Which some of it is scary, but true!  He even tries to push the limits of what people were finding funny when he starts bashing Osama Bin Laden, but then goes into an ethnic joke right off from it and causes some confusion.  Even the audience's reaction to that is funny.
I ordered this DVD twice, once for a friend for Christmas, since she found the special when it was on HBO funny.  Then I ordered it for myself, since I wanted to have it.
The only thing I could have wished for was Robin to do a ""commentary"" track over the comedy.  Would have been funny to hear him make fun of himself and to hear his thoughts on what he was making jokes about.
The ""extras"" were nice.  The interview was a good thing to have.  But then there was the sound effects and the ""secret"" area.  They were nice of all the effects and ""special words"" he said during his show, but it just felt like it was going for the kids.... for comedy that wasn't censored for kids.

1801683,5,B000077VQ6,"I'll tell you one thing that I am getting SICK of....all these new stand-up comic shows on Comedy Central.  Geez, everyone's talking about reality TV getting out of control, and they're right, but this tidal wave of stand up comics that aren't funny in the least is getting to me more.
It's okay though, because there is a solution to all this madness that so many are confused by, and it's this DVD.  Robin Williams returns from his mission of playing serious roles in Good Will Hunting, Insomnia and One Hour Photo to show that he's still the same funny guy that had us rolling on the ground years earlier in Good Morning Vietnam and Mrs. Doubtfire.
What makes this DVD so hilarious is Williams just will not let up.  He barely pauses to take a breath.  Joke after joke after joke come out, each one funnier than the last, not giving you any time to recover for the next joke.  Even when he screws up (which he actually does quite often) he's ready with another joke to cover up what he just messed up on.  Williams is brilliant, with writing and with improvisation, and he balances both quite well.
From jokes about cat territoriality to Osama Bin Laden to Gandhi jeans, Williams proves to be the funniest man alive...again.  I can honestly say I have never laughed harder in my entire life as I did when I watched Robin Williams Live On Broadway for the first time.
Almost two hours of pure hilarity?  Why not pick it up?",1045353600,9,1425,4.474903474903475

1801685,5,B000077VQ6,"Excellent, excellent, excellent!
Many of us associate Robin Williams with funny didactic movies that always end with a  moral value.  Well, in this live on Broadway standup routine (recorded for HBO from the Broadway Theater in New York City) Robin Williams throws whatever morallity he has out the window and enjoys an open mic.
Watching this made me laugh until I was crying and suffering abdominal pain.  For those of you expecting ""Flubber"" or ""Hook"" you will be quite suprised that Mr. Williams is extremely dirty and political as he throws controversial jokes straight at the camera.
To explain the topics he covers is impossible because he is so fast and is capable of changing subjects so fast that to try to explain what it is about is far beyond my ability.  In fact, he goes so fast, he finishes an entire CASE of water, which is probably about 20 bottles.
More specifically, Williams takes advantage of his large talent of character acting and astounds his audiences.  As he jumps back between is French ""Look, I give a cigarette to a baby"" to George Dubya saying ""Our economy is--oh, look at the kitty!""  He is not afraid to offend anyone as he examines religeons like Episcipals, Jews, Christianity, Puritanism, Calvanism, Buddism, Hinduism, and Islam.
Because of the fact that this is a DVD, it comes with a few extra features.  First is an interview which is very charming with several chuckles allthe way through.  Also included is a track of noises, which are all of Robin's wacky sound effects that he creates throughout the stand up routine.  For those of you who are always excited to find a secret easter egg, there is also a track called ""Parental Advisory"" that is 2 minutes of all the curses (which are EXTREMELY plentiful) that Robin uses.  The feature is in PCM stereo as well as Dolby Digital 5.1.
The Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound I thought seemed a little weird since at random times you will hear applause behind you and it sounds unnnatural most likely due to bad mixing/editing.
I would not, however, recommend any of this DVD for children under the age of 13, depending on how mature your children are.  This probably deserves to be rated R or possibly even NC-17 because of it's extremely naughty language, vulgar topics and sexual content.
All-in-all, Robin Williams is absoluletly hilarious, I think this is probably the best stand up routine I've ever seen and is definately worth the price.",1044835200,31,2432,4.794258373205742

His observations on life range from things like politics, the Olympics, golf, drugs, and animals to name just a few.

1801690,5,B000077VQ6,"Robin Williams might be one of the most brilliant comedic minds of the past 25 years.  This is one of his first live solo shows in a long time, and it's wickedly funny.  It also includes an easter egg that I'll detail at the end of the review.
Williams takes to a Broadway stage and talks about everything from the Olympics to prostate exams to President Bush.  He does it in his own manic way, hardly stopping to take a breath and producing a gallon of sweat in the process.  He is absolutely hysterical to watch, using nothing but water bottles for props.
The special features feature backstage footage of Robin before the show and an interview done by the director.  You see that Robin is as insane off-stage as he is on.
A fair warning though:  this is not for those of you who are easily offended or for kids.  He talks, very graphically, about sex and body parts, and he also curses about every five seconds.
Which brings me to the Easter Egg.  It's a montage of every swear word he says in the broadcast.  It almost develops a hip-hop rhythm after awhile.  To access it, go to the ""Bonus Features"" area and go down to ""Resume"".  Press right and it should highlight a ""Parental Advisory"" logo.  Hit enter and you're in.
If you're looking for something funny and a bit naughty, this is definitely an entertaining thing to show to friends or to just watch on your own.",1042156800,14,1372,4.422310756972111

1801692,5,B000077VQ6,"After sixteen long years, Robin Williams has returned to the world of stand-up comedy, and the results are off-the-wall.  Williams is wild, crazy, and unpredictable... which makes it all that better.
""Robin Williams Live on Broadway"" is 126 minutes of pure outrageous comedy like you've never seen before.  You can tell that he doesn't rehearse any of his acts, because he can switch from one topic to the next with ease and without warning.  He is constantly on the move and is never lacking the humor in his act.  I could tell you about the stuff you'll see, but it wouldn't sound funny.  After all, it's really not the content alone that makes this so funny, it's the DELIVERY.  If anybody else attempted to do this material, it wouldn't be funny.
This is the exact show that was shown on HBO, unedited and uncensored.  Don't be fooled, Williams loves to curse.  (In fact, there's even a cute little hidden Easter Egg that if you find it, it's like a full-blown case of Turret's Syndrome, Williams style.)  But when he swears, it doesn't sound all that shocking or offensive.  It just comes out natural.  Presented in DVD format, you get a crystal clear picture and your choice of either Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, or PCM Stereo.  (PCM may not be available on all DVD players.  I've never heard of it before, so be warned.)
There's some really cool extras on the DVD, such as an interview with Williams conducted by the director of ""Live on Broadway,"" a behind-the-scenes look before the show, a noises montage, and a really, really offensive and hilarious Easter Egg.
""Robin Williams Live on Broadway"" is a great purchase, and is a must-have for all comedy lovers.  I recommend getting this instead of the CD, because the CD isn't as funny if you haven't seen the act.  After all, it's all in the delivery.  Also, the facial expressions Robin Williams makes are priceless.  This is a program worth re-watching over and over again.  Very high quality all the way!",1041984000,9,1973,4.702623906705539
1801693,5,B000077VQ6,"I first saw the tail end of Robin's Broadway show on HBO and laughed till I was crying, and I was absolutely thrilled when they put his show on DVD. It is an excellent purchase if you enjoy Williams' quirky, loud, and animated humor.
His show, which runs over two hours and has very, very few parts that aren't funny, captures the full range of his comic abilities. You get to see Robin impersonate a monkey, a sexually frustrated ape, a little boy, George Bush, an Afghan trying to call a jihad with a mouth full of peanut butter, a drunken Scotsman, a stoner, a drunkard, and a patient recovering from a colonoscopy. His talent for improvising is obvious a few times throughout the show, most notably when he trips over his own tongue and still manages to turn his bungled words into a hysterical joke.
Aside from the show--which any Robin Williams or comedy fan will enjoy--the DVD contains a few amusing extras, most notably a special feature called ""noises."" This tidbit captures all of the various noises that Robin makes throughout his two hour show and condenses them into about five minutes. Needless to say, this is the funniest thing on the DVD.
Also included is an interview with the director of the show. This has its funny moments and sheds some interesting light onto how the show was produced (it actually didn't start out how it was intended to), and gives us a glimpse of Robin off the stage, but it is cut short, making it a relatively boring special feature after you've seen it once (""noises,"" on the contrary, can be viewed indefinitely).
The producers of the DVD also included a five minute clip of Robin cracking jokes in the minutes before he was to go onstage. It gives us another glimpse of just how funny he can be without rehearsed jokes, but it falls short of greatness and can only be viewed once or twice.
In short, if you enjoy the energetic style of comedy that Robin Williams exudes, or if you just want to laugh out loud about the absurdity of contemporary events, don't hesitate to add this to your collection. For a more intellectual and original show, however, I highly recommend Eddie Izzard's ""Dress To Kill."" (90/100)",1041897600,51,2159,4.625
1801694,2,B000077VQ6,"Robin Williams is a genius when it comes to comedy.  His humor is usually so rich and amusing.  This DVD turned out to be an exception.  The skit about golf was beyond hilarious and a few other bits were funny too but the vast majority of the time even I was turned off by his vulgar humor.  I didn't think I could be turned off by this kind of humor.  I've heard other comedians do it before and it's funny.  Robin Williams with his quick wit took it was over the edge.  He'd hit something vulgar and just keep on going with it until he took it way too far.  Also, I don't necessarily mind hearing the F word 50 million times (I didn't count but it must have been close) but the jokes were just too raunchy!  He just went over the top.  I've never seen R. Williams do anything this tasteless before and hopefully we never will again.  I'll forgive him for this one.  Hopefully the next DVD of his will better-reflect his typical humor.

Yes, the language is rough and there are lots of sexual jokes, especially at the end.  If that's not your idea of humor, you might want to avoid this DVD.  His political/George Bush jokes had me rolling, though.",1041724800,,473,4.595238095238095

I was cracking up, my husband was cracking up, and Charlie Rose was laughing so hard that he had to bang his hand on the table.  During the course of this hour-long interview, they played a clip of Robin Williams, Live on Broadway.  It was the clip about the invention of golf.  I laughed so hard that I had tears in my eyes.  Immediately, I decided that I wanted this DVD.
I feel so disappointed.  While there are defintely some very funny things on the DVD (such as the invention of golf bit and the September 11 jokes), so much of what was on there was disgusting potty humor, oral sex jokes, and viagra gags.  It's nasty.  Worse, it is soooo done already.  I really expected more from Robin Williams.  Not only was this material nasty, it was way beneath him.
Robin Williams was by far funnier on Charlie Rose Live, just doing stuff off the cuff, then he was in this DVD.  Maybe I'll give away this DVD and try to order a copy of Charlie Rose.
If you like nasty humor and never get tired of it, then go ahead and buy this DVD.  Otherwise, maybe just rent or borrow it.  I think that you'll find it a little disappointing for the price, especially given the tiredness of much of the material.",1041292800,24,1353,4.338645418326693

Williams goes all out in all of his live performances. This particular night he performs live on Broadway (the culmination of a 20+ city national tour, and marking the conclusion of his triumphant, and much-heralded return to the ""stage"" in over 16 years). And what is the verdict??? BRILLIANCE!! The same brand of raunchy, charismatic, no holds-barred, yet very intelligent humor Williams has been known for.
ONE THING NEEDS TO BE POINTED OUT: Williams' energy is unparalleled in his stand-up work and is NOTHING like his theatrical roles (from Flubber to Insomnia), which only seem to stifle the madman lurking beneath. With uncensored, and essentially unscripted stand-up, Robin is able to reveal his TRUE SELF. However, this is not some mindless rant... Williams seems to emerge from a shell he's been keeping himself in... commentating on social and political issues of the day (from foreign relations, biological warfare, sex, and even sports).
Where this ""movie"" truly earns 5 STARS is in Williams's performance itself. Sadly, comics today go through ""ho-hum"" HBO specials like candy (I will not name names), giving audiences and viewers 60-65 minutes. Williams goes non-stop for 2 hours!! And as a result becomes so drenched in sweat by the end, you begin to wonder how he's still standing!
Material-wise, I feel there is no one better, with Williams delivery of quips, jokes, and punchlines only rivaled by George Carlin, and the shows of Eddie Murphy from the early to mid 1980s.
The DVD package, as many other DVDs seem to nowadays, comes with more than anyone could have expected, with behind-the-scenes broadcasts, and a full interview with the maestro himself. The picture and sound quality are superb and nothing seems to have been lost in the transfer.
Bottomline: though perhaps crude at some points, I think that ANYONE with at least a partially open mind and a love for laughs will enjoy this movie. Take it from my mother (a 52 year-old Frenchwoman not necessarily in tune with ""hip society"") sitting crying from laughter, ""He is the best!""",1038182400,182,2271,5.042553191489362
1801717,5,B000077VQ6,"Robin Williams has to be the funniest man on the face of the earth! This comedy special had me suffocating (literally!) from laughter. Williams makes George W. Bush sound like the stupidest person ever. From talking about Viagra to having sex with a gorilla, this is just the funniest thing I have ever seen. This was just obviously a comic masterpiece. I watched it everytime they re-ran it on HBO. Now its coming out on DVD and I will definitely be first in line to buy it. When I saw the picture here for the first time, I started squealing with delight. I have to have this DVD! Robin...YOU DID GOOD!!! HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!",1038182400,,623,4.571428571428571
