5162276,5,B008H6GH7Y,Our children love them!  I'm not sure what else to say about them...fun movies!  A nice collection to buy for them.,1356220800,7,115,4.428571428571429
5162277,1,B008H6GH7Y,"These new 4-DVD sets Disney is releasing are interesting, but I don't know about this one. The Haunted Mansion was a huge disappointment, which could have been amazing (released shortly after the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, which is the only really well-made one of the four). Tower of Terror--wasn't that a TV-only, B-movie? I don't recognize the Mr. Toad's Wild Ride movie, and didn't Country Bears flop too? Your money is probably better spent on the Ichabod and Mr. Toad DVD--&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Ichabod-and-Mr-Toad-Disney-Gold-Classic-Collection/dp/B00004R99Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (Disney Gold Classic Collection)</a>a set of two classic 50's era Disney cartoons that have been all-but forgotten by the company. The Legend of Sleepy Hollow cartoon is a wonderful take on the classic American story, narrated and sung by none other than Bing Crosby! It's perfect Disney fare for spooky family fun. The Mr. Toad cartoon is fun as well--classic animation, some famous voices, and a story any kid would enjoy. Do be warned, the weasel villains use some knives and guns, and even smoke cigars--so parents should decide whether they're comfortable with that prior to letting children watch. Still, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow will give more real 'Thrills & Chills' than this set.",1353283200,6,1407,5.8019323671497585

5162282,4,B008H6GH7Y,"I bought this for my kids so they would have a chance to see movies associated with the rides at Disney World, Tower of Terror and Haunted Mansion. I know these movies are a bit cheesy and were made long after the rides, but the kids liked them. The other two movies were just a bonus. It was cheaper to purchase this set of 4 than to get the other two movies separately. All the movies play well and are decent quality. Considering they aren't great movies to begin with, I think these were a good price and will work as good additions to our Halloween movie collection.",1512086400,2,571,4.296296296296297

Many of these contained movies that my children have watched si many times that DVDs are almost wore out. This collection including the Haunted House, a weird version if Wind in the willows, and Tower of Terror, as well as another truly forgettable bad movie. I am giving this a three star rating because little daughter enjoyed. This collection to me may have been called thrills and chills but my problem is this collection of movies that are direct to DVD or should be is neither thrilling or chilling and in a couple instances almost unwatchable",1506988800,,664,4.588235294117647

This is one of my favorite rides and after watching the movie it's one of my favorite movies.  It's a good movie that has a very young Kirsten Dunst in it and Steve Guttenburg.

Yes you are correct: This is in regards to the reply someone made, I had forgotten that the movie was made after the ride.  I remember reading something about the movie being filmed using the lobby of the ride and some of the surrounding area in front.  I appreciate the correction as I really hate putting inaccurate information out.",1436313600,,674,4.475409836065574

It's my favorite ride of all the parks and they obviously shot some of the scenes on location, which makes it even more interesting. Yes, it was originally a silly made for TV movie but it does have a couple of big names and is pretty entertaining. The Haunted Mansion is a little scary for smaller kids, but if you know the history of the ride there are some interesting tidbits to pick up on. Overall, a great value and enjoyable before or after a Disney vacation.",1422748800,7,644,4.420168067226891

5162385,4,B008H6GH7Y,"I enjoyed all these movies. I had never seen Tower of Terror or Mr Toads Wild Ride. To rank them I would say Haunted Mansion is the best film in this collection followed by Tower Of Terror, Country Bears and Mr Toads Wild Ride.

I thought I would post this info since it's not in the description.

Tower Of Terror is fullscreen or 1:33:1 ratio.
Haunted Manson is widescreen 16X9 2:35:1 ratio
Mr. Toad's Wild ride is listed on the box as widescreen 1:85:1 it isn't. At least mine isn't. On my Blu Ray player its in 1:33:1 but also has the black bars at the top and bottom.
County Bears is 1:33:1 Fullscreen.

When watching on an HD TV with a Blu Ray player Tower Of Terror, Mr. Toads Wild Ride and Country Bears all have the black bars on the side. Have not tried watching them on a regular DVD player.",1389052800,19,801,4.222222222222222
5162386,5,B008H6GH7Y,"I love Disney and I think they did an excellent job in turning some of the rides into movies.  I think Haunted Mansion is one of the best movies to come out of the Disney studios in a long time.  I was glad to see Steve Guttenberg again, too.",1387497600,,242,3.9183673469387754

5162389,5,B008H6GH7Y,"My children and grandchildren and I have thourghly enjoyed this collection. Partly because we have managed to go on almost all of the rides. Then you watch the interpretation of the ride in movie form. I was very impressed with ""Mr. Toad's Wild Ride"". I was expecting it to be animated. To see humans actually protraying the animals was fantastic. It was certainly a positive choice when selecting this collection. An experience for the whole family.",1379721600,,450,4.934210526315789

I have spent a number of years changing over my VHS collection to DVD,  This is the first time I have seen this movie for sale anywhere on DVD.  It had been on my ""to buy"" list for a lot of years.

I've seen Haunted Mansion before and my whole family liked it.",1364515200,,349,4.0

5162396,5,B008H6GH7Y,"I received this set as a gift for christmas and I loved watching each of the movies. I loved all 4 of them. I already knew that I liked The Haunted Mansion and the Country Bears. I never saw the Tower Of Terror or Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, I ended up enjoying them as much as the other two movies.
  I would recommend this four pack to any Disney Movie fan out there!",1357516800,18,363,3.958904109589041

8527962,4,B008H6GH7Y,tower of terror is actually a pretty good movie and even scary a few times but Gutenberg as usual makes it cheesier than it would have been otherwise,1527984000,,149,4.357142857142857

8527965,4,B008H6GH7Y,"Didn't know how to rate this one!  I'm giving it four stars because the case and DVDs are fine.  However, the movies themselves aren't top notch for Disney productions.  We've watched two so far, and they're kind of like B Movies, but with famous actors in them.  Strange!  Anyway, it's a good price so I say go for it if you like things Disney :)",1521936000,,347,4.276923076923077

8527968,5,B008H6GH7Y,"Mainly dropping a review on this for the packaging.  While its not clear that I can tell, this is a 4 movie pack that comes on 4 DVD's in one case.  That means that these are the same movies that you can buy by themselves, but as a collection.  I was a bit concerned because I didn't know if they were on one or two DVD's between all 4 movies, I know that picture quality can suffer.  Not the case and very happy to see that!",1515110400,,425,3.9069767441860463
