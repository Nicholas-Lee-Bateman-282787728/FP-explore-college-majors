1852912,5,B00008MHC1,"It's difficult to put a fresh spin on zombie flicks these days, but this is one film that is refreshingly shocking. Start the premise with young punks heisting jewels, and meeting with Yakuza hotshots at an abandoned military base to sell their wares. As the deal begins to go awry, this sounds like the beginnings of a hot ""young punks vs murderous gangster"" flick. Yeah, we've seen this plot over and over, but these thugs about to take part in a gangland war are unaware that the military base is not THOROUGHLY abandoned. Experiments in reanimation have been in the works, and these sleeping corpses would like to feast on do-gooders or evil-doers, whoever is nearest to their slothlike chompers.
The blood and guts are plentiful. Nothing overly impressive in the way of special effects, but the zombies' body movements and ""chew factor"" are unusually creepy. I've seen so many zombie flicks that try to scare you with graphic gore, but few that deliver genuinely scary sequences and intriguing characters.
If you love zombie flicks, this is a MUST! If you are a rookie Zombie Watcher, this flick might just get you wanting to feast on more ""Living Dead"" spectaculars!",1061164800,6,1172,4.865

Whether it be a female getaway driver who is more willing than her male partner to drive headlong into a horde of zombies or a prototype female zombie whose strength and abilities exceed that of five men, director Atsushi Muroga's refreshing reversal of traditional roles and refusal to take the proceedings too seriously make for a movie ten times as entertaining as the majority of recent stateside efforts make this a good Zombie flick as good is  any top George Ramano dead zombie movie top of the line fantastic highly reccomend it .",1118534400,,643,4.741071428571429

1852963,1,B00008MHC1,"this movie just downright sucks...i guess if youhave a facination with zombies you might give it benefit of the foubt but not only is there bad acting and a horrible story, its just a horrible movie. The girl should have died 20 times by the end of the movie and shes such a b! tch it just makes you mad she made it out alive. The zombies are all morons, in one scene even resorting to eating itself. the gore was great but it just seemed senseless.

1852964,4,B00008MHC1,"Any true Zombie fan i think would enjoy this film as i thought was an excellent movie and a movie that I will watch plenty of more times and worth the money.

Let me start of first by saying that this movie was influenced by Zombi 1980( Lucio Fulci ) and Re-Animator 1985. Well somewhat a bite off.

The reason being is the Zombies are created, well brought back to life by a injection of a green liquid ( same as Re-Animator ) and also 2 other scenes where the zombies are eating people, well feasting on them were a bit off of Fulci. If you seen the Fulci film ( Zombi 2 ) the you will know what im talking about. The end scene is also a bite off of Fulci's Zombi, by showing a rotting corpse at the end with worms in his eye, just like the Fulci Zombi.

But thats a heads up so there is no dissapointment if and when seen.

Now to the movie it's self. The plot is very original, as I won't get into details because you can read other posts that will give you overall outlook. I was very shocked for the good and very impressed. This movie I brought was in sub title it was not dubbed to english. If you are a fan of Zombie cinema as i am you will be very staisfied with it, besides the bit  off scenes the plot is very original so that makes up for it. Yes, it is bloody and gory which is a plus along with non-stop action like most films. Out of  all the Zombie movies I have seen out of Japan ( Stacy, WildZero, versus and Junk ) by far Junk is the best of them all. Junk seems to be more  of an American Zombie movie than anything, though there is a bit of Japanese style zombie which from the movies I have seen are more like human/Zombie completley dead but still can act like Humans in a sense ( there is only 2 of them ). Versus is an excellent movie more of a Japanese Zombie flick with out a doubt, but is an excellent movie, but please I advie to not byu the directors cut/uncut or whatever version as it is extended about 25 minutes more than it should have, still an excellent movie but just extended to long which kind of kills the movie and makes you tired cause it didn't end when it should have. Still it is worth it to have if you are a true fan of Zombie/japanese cinema.

I found a spot out near me in a mall where this guy has a good 200 plus japanese movies  basically all horror and animation and all original copies sells them for $20 but I get them for $15, which is cool. Better than spending what they want here on Amazon or anywhere else. So far I have brought Junk and Versus, next Im looking to buy the movie Audition ( which is like a slasher film form what I hear ) and a sci-fi one called ALIVE both Japanese cinema, Im not big on them but i saw some clips and it looked pretty solid though i will read more reviews b4 I buy anything. If there is anyone in the NY area who is interested in knowing where you could get these Japanese movies at my E-Mail is HorrorFan4588@aol.com. Please state in the subject title what you are writing about if not I will not open the mail.",1111276800,,3007,4.031879194630872
1852965,1,B00008MHC1,I saw this movie about a year ago and could not believe how terrible it was. For those of you you have seen Fulci's Zombie Flesh Eaters you will no doubt experience deja vu. I actually predicted what shot's were going to come next and hadn't even seen the movie. There are scenes that are literally shot by shot recreations of Fulci's. This movie was so terrible it made me want to kick myself in the face for watching it. It's a good thing i didn't pay to rent it or i might have commited suicide.,1097193600,3,498,4.197916666666667
1852966,1,B00008MHC1,"I bought this DVD because I enjoy Japanese cinema - stuff by Takashi Miike, you know the drill.  This movie has terrible acting, bad make-up and gore effects, and is almost completely worthless.  It's stupid, and almost painful to watch.  I figured with being made in 1999 - and released in 2003, it would be relatively up-to-date with it's filming and effects - but it looks like a heaping pile of B-Trash from the early 70s.  You can't pay me enough to watch it again.  All of you other people who gave this movie high marks must be happily living in the past - or you haven't seen a new movie in over 30 years.

To put it short, Junk is junk - and the only thing it's good for was making my small DVD collection look a little bit bigger.",1096675200,5,740,4.212765957446808
1852967,4,B00008MHC1,"I had pretty low expectations of this film before watching it.  Rarely is Junk mentioned in the same class and given the same amount of admiration as Wild Zero or Versus, other recent Japanese Zombie films.  Junk was released prior to the aforementioned two other films and spearheaded the new wave of Japanese zombie films of the new millennia.  I was expecting this film to be cheap-looking and boring but instead Junk turned out to be a wildly fun and inventive stab at the zombie genre.
3 men and a woman agree to pull a heist on behalf of the Yakuza by robbing a jewellery store.  In exchange for the jewellery the yakuza promise a hefty sum of cash.  The meeting point is set at a remote former military site about an hour's drive outside of town.  The robbers arrive at the base and while waiting for the Yakuza walk around and find out that it may not be as deserted as they originally thought, as they stumble upon a lab containing various chemicals and a room containing a number of bodies lying on the floor, wrapped in white sheets.  Unbeknownst to them, the military base has for some time been the site of a project by the name of DNX that has as a goal of bringing back the dead to life.  As the dead rise, the robbers and the Yakuza's struggle to stay alive begins.
Junk borrows elements from so many other zombie films that it's hard to keep a track of, the most obvious influences in particular being Fulci's Zombie, Re-animator and Return of the living dead.  The zombies bear a striking resemblance to Romero's, with their bluish skin and slow limping shuffle.  They die the exactly the same way, through a gunshot wound to the head.  In other ways however, the film is quite unique within the zombie genre, a combination undead film and high-octane Asian action shoot-em-up.  Zombies and the Yakuza make for an entertaining mix.  I also liked the idea of a ""head zombie"", who is not dumb like the others but instead acts as a brain for all of the undead, able to de-activate bombs and outsmart the U.S. military.  This head zombie is not a ghoul of rotting flesh like the others but a beautiful clear-skinned Japanese woman who spends most of her time prancing around naked on screen and taunting her former husband, the scientist behind the DNX project who brought her back to life.  Most entertaining of all is a battle between the head zombie and the female robber, a climactic show-down between two beautiful asian women with scores to settle.
The action is unrelenting in this film, a stable of Asian cinema.  Junk doesn't overstay its welcome the way the 120-minute Versus does, instead delivering a brisk 83-minute package of gun-toting gangster action and zombie gore.  Highly underrated but highly recommended.",1073692800,34,2740,4.651452282157677
1852968,3,B00008MHC1,"after reading all the hype about VERSUS another asian horror movie that borrows heavily from american cinema/concepts, i was hugely disapointed, but when i rented JUNK from my video store
i actually had a good time watching this schlocker, junk blatently rips off ideas from famed directors; romero (day of he dead) lucio fulci of ZOMBIE. (hell, even some of the music sounds excatly like ZOMBIE 3)
but nonetheless isn't bad for a cheesy c-movie. the zombies were more ""convincing"" than paul anderson's disapointing adaptation of resident evil. JUNK doesn't take itself too seriously either, the violence is over-the-top cartoonish regardless of  the gory bits and the comic reliefs actually had me rotf.
props to this ambtious director,with a bigger budget and more originality he may be the next john carpenter or romero

Then it goes to where some gangstaz hold up a jewelry store and steal jewelry then they go to an abandoned factory to meet with a Japanese mafia gang.

Then two operatives are sent to investigate the situation and one of the dudes finds out his girlfriend is a all powerful zombie and she kills him. Now the other two survivors must now battle zombies and all that.
If you like Lucio's ZOMBI 3 (the music is so simular as well as the zombies), then you are in a for a treat. The funniest thing in this movie is when the scientist Asian guy is speaking English, badly. So bad I'd understand the Asian language better. This is a lovely, happy, gory film :).

7985501,3,B00008MHC1,Nifty Little Zombie Film pays trbute to Movies like 1979s Dawn of the Dead and 1980s Zombi 2. Make-up is pretty well done for a low budget Feature. The DVD is a good copy and belongs in any Zombie FleshEaters Library.,1425427200,,217,4.317073170731708
7985502,3,B00008MHC1,"A group of jewelry thieves choose the wrong location to swap their stolen goods as they find themselves in the middle of a military testing facility that is being used to revive the dead into a new form of biological weapon! JUNK, along with WILD ZERO and VERSUS, is a direct response to the popularity of survival video game series like Resident Evil in Japan. It is an Asian Horror film with Western sensibilities, pulling from the entire canon of zombie cinema, with ties to George Romero's classic DAWN OF THE DEAD as well as the lesser Italian efforts like HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD. The cliche story structure and poor production quality more accurately reflect the latter, but there is certainly no lack of gore in this gut-muncher! The Japanese have proven, once again, that they have the same taste for human flesh as most American audiences, as the bloody special effects and chilling make-up work rivals anything we have seen here in the US. JUNK really brings nothing new to the table, but offers gore fans more than their fill of flesh-eating zombie action!

7985503,3,B00008MHC1,"I love zombie movies.  To come across one that I haven't seen is rare.  I looked forward to watching this movie with great anticipation.  I will say they quickly caught my attention with the opening sequence involving a zombie experiment.  Using a drug called DNX, they bring a naked woman back to life (so to speak).  Of course after that I naturally expected the usual zombie mayhem but instead they derailed the whole project with a jewelry heist gone bad.  What one had to do with the other is anyone's guess, but did they have to feature so much of it?  It also didn't help that half of the subtitles were in Japanese, half in English; half the dialog was Japanese, half of it was in English.  Why they went this route was never made clear.  It was, unfortunately, a bit confusing; I wasted more time wondering why they did this instead of enjoying the movie.  Yes, they eventually returned to the zombies, which I greatly appreciated, but at that point it was too little too late.  I can't see keeping this one for future viewings.",1340841600,,1037,4.521505376344086
7985504,4,B00008MHC1,"I bought this movie for the synopsis alone. I was under the impression that it was going to be a rag-tag group of thieves vs. the yakuza vs. zombies...and it actually played out as such! I would highly recommend this film to ANY fan of horror, but especially for those who would like to see Evil Dead merge with Bride of Re-Animator and take place on the set of Creepozoids. I don't know why the acting and picture quality is so terrible on behalf of every American/scene featured (though I like to think that it was done intentionally), but everyone else gives a legitimate performance. I particularly enjoyed the panicked yells and exaggerated facial expressions of the thief with bleached hair (whose actor nor character name are coming to me right now, courtesy of Svedka). Great blend of gore and low-budget splatter; the highlight of which is - in my opinion - one of the head-bursts where they use the Japanese-style fountain tactic. If you've seen movies like Tokyo Gore Police or Meatball Machine (both of which kick ass!), you know what I'm trying to convey.

All-in-all, a very impressive effort, and a gem of a late nineties b-movie splatterfest.

I love the fact that there are some people who only stick to practical FX despite the turn of the century. Warms my heart, in fact.",1339286400,,1294,4.6960352422907485

7985506,3,B00008MHC1,"Junk is a Japanese zombie movie directed by Atsushi Muroga.  Briefly, the plot revolves around a group of jewelry thieves that orchestrate a heist for the Yakuza.  The crew meets the gang at a seemingly abandoned warehouse for the exchange of said goods and money when all zombie hell breaks loose.

I'll do my best to break it down for the buyer, and hope it forms well, but I'm having some trouble articulating in my mind what it was exactly that disappointed me about this movie.

When I buy horror, I typically do so because I'm in the mood for one of its specific genres.  (I realize this is probably applicable to most film categories, but I'm decidedly fastidious when it comes to horror.)  When I saw the cover of Junk, I heard the slap of wet liver on pavement and it put me in a zombie-gore mood, so I went with it.

If you're buying this movie for the same reason, I can't completely recommend it.  It's entirely possible that I've desensitized myself with twenty years of chainsaws and intestinal ripping, but I just don't think I saw anything remarkable in Junk outside of its faults.  The acting is devastatingly poor, especially the American actors, and the soundtrack is all over the place.  The frequently abused overly-dramatic slow motion sequences are a little much, too.  Reservoir Dogs apparently set that bar too high.

I wasn't impressed, but this movie may appeal to some.  If you're new to splatter film, a zombie enthusiast who wants to pull in everything from the genre, or a Japanese-horror newbie, this may be a decent film for you.  It delivers your baseline requirements for each without going overboard.

In the end, I wasn't shocked, which is exactly what I crave from this style of film.

7985507,4,B00008MHC1,"Junk (Atsushi Muroga, 2000)

Short, but entirely satisfying, Japanese zombie flick that pays homage to the classic seventies and eighties American/Italian living dead movies without ever feeling derivative. Muroga (Gun Crazy) delivers the goods here with style.

Simple plot: a gang of jewel thieves meet up with their Yakuza employers in an abandoned factory in order to deliver the haul from their latest heist. Except, of course, that pretty much everyone is planning to double-cross pretty much everyone else, and just to make things complicated, the factory is an old Army research lab that was working on reanimating the dead, and perhaps things worked better than they thought...

When it comes right down to it, there's not a great deal most of us ask for from zombie flicks. We want them to be gory, to have at least a semblance of suspense, and not really mess with the paradigm all that much. We've gotten so inured to bad zombie movies that when we come across one that's got a solid story, great acting, and competency in pace, we start getting confused, I guess, if it doesn't have a big name in the field on it. (And let's face it, honestly, even the big names in the field have never been known for attracting the finest actors, with a very few exceptions.)

Yeah, the movie does have its drawbacks, most notably an incredibly cheesy scene towards the climax, but that should in no way prevent you from finding this one at your earliest opportunity if you're a zombie fan.

7985509,4,B00008MHC1,"Matthew has already written the defacto review, but being a horror fan, and a zombie horror fan inparticular, I thought I'd add my two cents.

While Junk is not a good movie in the typical sense, it is still a great time, and you will be entertained, assuming this is your cup of tea. This is the type of movie me and my college buddies would cram into a dorm room to watch.

Not only does Junk borrow or pay tribute to Re-Animator, George Romero and Lucio Fulci, it also pays tribue to the Resident Evil videogames in a very classic ""Resident Evil"" way. If you catch these references Junk is well worth your time. If you're looking for something along the quality of the more well known Ringu or Juon, lower your expectations and you may enjoy it.

Junk does contain some terrible editing, bad acting, gigantic plot holes, wrong references (someone in the crew confused a porshe with a corvette) and at times, cheesy effects. While the gore affects are good, it lacks the frightening intensity of Romero's films. (Taking place totally in broad daylight may have something to do with that.) Being eaten alive is a basic fear going back as far into human history as one can go. What movies like Jaws and Dawn of the Dead do for making people feel afraid, Junk fails to do. It does have some tense moments, just not enough of them.

Ah but not all is lost. What the film does a great job of is giving us a credible heroine to cheer for, and while the editing and production values may be subpar, the director makes up for this with excellent pacing that moves the adventure along. It is a brisk film that doesn't get bogged with with dialogue or plot intricacies. Honestly, it went by a little too fast. I was wishing it was just a little longer because while it is a typical zombie movie with classic zombie rules (shooting the head is the only way to kill them, they shuffle and move slowly while displaying huge feats of strength etc.), the director spins his zombie tale very affectively.

Believe it or not Junk does contain some social commentary, not unlike Romero's films, though obviously they are of a Japanese perspective. I think most may be lost to me because I am American, but I didn't find the references all that deep. But nonetheless I think they are there considering there was really no reason at all to include Americans in the film, and the blame for the zombies is largely pointing at it as an American operation. Perhaps that is how the Japanese see us sometimes. The Americans certainly were ""zombie-like"" in their acting. :P

Overall I really enjoyed it, and I'd recommend it to any horror fan. It would've been interesting to see what Atsushi Muroga could've done with a bigger budget.",1138147200,2,2710,4.543032786885246
