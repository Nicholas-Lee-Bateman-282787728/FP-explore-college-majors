8563023,5,B00B5UBF94,"This is a beautiful production.  It is from 1988 with a 2013 DVD release from ArtHaus musik.  Despite the early date the images are clear with good color rendition.  The sound is PCM stereo but very good.  The subtitles make sense and don't impinge on the key parts of each image.  The staging is very nice and the performances excellent.  I particularly enjoyed Cecilia Bartoli as Rosina, Gino Quilico as Figaro, and Carolo Feller as Bartolo but all of the singers were fine.",1525824000,,476,4.674698795180723

Love Cecilia Bartoli in any thing she does!
