Hopefully Amazon will correct this mistake soon by removing the other film from this listing.  The film you are looking for was launched in 2008, not 2005.",1500854400,,322,4.925925925925926

8249473,5,B001392Q54,"To be able to recommend this book, I have to tell you a little of my story. I was born in a family where religion was not a priority or basic understanding. Since the age of seven Ive communicated with spirits and my family had a hard time understanding that. I was beaten several times. The situation became critical when the teens time arrived.  I was without protection and under family pressure to end what they called farce. Finally, at 16, a female entity manifested and told me to get out of my parents' house. At 18, I took refuge in the military. The spirits use to come to see me inside the headquarters of the armed forces when I was on duty, with a rifle in my hand. I had many conversations and received much guidance from the spirits at that time. Finally out of the military at age 20, I fled to the farthest city from my parents: Brasilia, capital of Brazil. There, for the first time in my life, I met a Kardecista Spiritual Center. It was 1978. That spiritual center was already providing free care to anyone. There, I had contact with the first books by Alan Kardec and Francisco Cndido Xavier, including the Book of Spirits. I was submitted to three past life regressions and my life took a new and healthy direction. There are many centers like that in Brazil. People of all faiths attend those centers seeking cure for the ills of the body-mind-spirit. It is an almost perfect movement, where body, mind and spirit are seen as inseparable. Thousands of people go to these centers before and after consulting a doctor to compare and verify if they are on the right track. Gradually, my family changed and I graduated in various related specialties, including Traditional Chinese  Medicine and Psychosomatics.",1395619200,,1729,4.628664495114006

8249475,3,B001392Q54,"Very interesting documentary, but I thought it was a bit short.  I was expecting more out of it.  It's good for general info and as an intro to the topic.",1348185600,,154,4.1
8249476,5,B001392Q54,"I find Emma Bragdon's book ""Kardec's Spiritism"" excellent -- so much so that I regret not having run across it earlier.  It is very resourceful, very well written, with much information that I had no idea about and find quite exciting.  Dr. Emma Bragdon has an appealing style of writing.  As a person with impressive academic training, she comes to the point quickly and understandably.  In a neutral, factual way she describes the basics of Spiritism and how it has taken hold in Brazil, and how it became the basis for thousands of alternative health care centers all over Brazil, a few of which she describes in good, factual detail.  What is hard for many, in particular us Americans, to understand comes across quite impressively in this book, which is to what extensive degree this pseudo-religion -- probably better termed ""way of life"" -- is practiced with the absence of profit motives.  I find it particularly intriguing how Emma Bragdon tackles the question what it might be that is underlying the widely documented successful phenomenon/reality of spiritual healing.
""Kardec's Spiritism"" is a book worth while reading; while researched over 7-10 years ago and first published 6 years ago, the book is essentially timeless.  In this book, the author makes a highly relevant, well-documented comparison between the U.S. and Brazilian health care systems.  This comparison  is -- sadly -- still contemporary.
Well written, the result of tremendous research and dedication, once started, you will not put down this book.",1289865600,5,1529,5.133064516129032
8249477,5,B001392Q54,"This film is a window into an alternative world view that has spawned a caring and practical solution to high cost inhumane health care.

In 2006, my insurance company was charged $980.00 for a doctor at the local emergency room to put a band-aid on a cut on my  forehead.

 In Brazil you can go to a Spiritist Center and have a better chance of being be cured of Cancer or Schizophrenia than in the U.S. and it's free of charge.

Which system makes more sense?

This film is a solid starting point for investigating that question.",1201996800,,531,4.422680412371134
8249478,5,B001392Q54,"""I thought doctors would say, `Wow! Look at this.'"" Daniel Benor, M.D. states in this interesting video about healing methods he observed at Spiritist centers in Brazil and then reported on in books and journals.  Unfortunately, however, orthodox doctors, stuck in the muck and mire of materialism, have for the most part ignored the research and discoveries by Benor and others who have taken the time to study it.

  Benor understands, though, as he says he was a ""horrible skeptic"" about the healing he encountered in Spiritist centers before witnessing it for himself.  Like most physicians indoctrinated in modern psychology and medicine, he assumed it was all wishful thinking, possibly charlatanism.

  It is said that more than 20-million people use Spiritist Centers in Brazil and that there is a 70% success rate in helping people heal from cancer, 90% success rate in helping them overcome drugs and alcohol, and a 90% success rate in helping them overcome profound depression.

  This 33-minute video discusses the origins of Spritism, which has its roots in Shamanic tradition but was surfaced in the educated world by Allan Kardec, a French educator.  Sometime in late 1853 or early 1854, Kardec, whose real name was Hippolyte Lon Dnizarth Rivail, decided to investigate the mediumship phenomena that had been breaking out in France.  He began sitting at the home of a friend, Emile Charles Baudin, whose daughters, Caroline, 16, and Julie, 13, were mediums.  While most of the messages coming through the two young girls were of a mundane nature, the messages became serious and profound when Rivail was present.  He was informed that spirits of a higher order were communicating when he was present because they knew he could comprehend the messages and get them to the public. Among those purportedly communicating with Kardec were John the Evangelist, St. Augustine, St. Vincent De Paul, St. Louis, Socrates, Plato, Fnlon, Benjamin Franklin, and Emanuel Swedenborg.

  It was these advanced spirits who told him to adopt the pseudonym Allan Kardec for the books he would write ""in the fulfillment of the mission"" which they had for him.  In 1857, Kardec's book, ""Le Livre des Esprits"" (""The Spirits' Book"") was published, offering  answers to many questions which Kardec put to the spirits.

  A big part of the Spiritist philosophy has to do with healing by means of channeling magnetic energy from higher spirits.  The video demonstrates trained mediums, or healers, effecting healing by directing the energy into the patient's spirit body. It also demonstrates a disobsession session in which possessing entities are released from patients. Dr. Johann Grobler, a physician from South Africa, explains how the process is carried out through the raising of the vibrational rate and directing energy into the etheric, or spirit, body.

Produced by Emma Bragdon, Ph. D., who has also produced an interesting video on the renowned Spiritist healer John of God, this video offers an excellent introduction to Spiritism and Spiritist healing.  While we like to think the United States is setting the pace in scientific advancement, especially in medicine, it may very well be that we have gone much too fast, losing sight of the relationship between spirituality and health. Clearly, this video offers much to ponder.",1201651200,11,3331,5.179439252336449
8249479,5,B001392Q54,"This DVD opened for me a gateway into the way Spiritists in Brazil combine Spiritual Healing with convential medicine. It makes a link between Shaminism and the healing work of Spiritist hospitals who treat the whole person by giving loving assistance to those spirit entities who are stuck in the energy field of the patients. The film reports that they estimate that these spirit entities are implicated in 60% of
cases of mental illness,
In  the presentation we see a healing group at work and have commentary as to what is happening.
It is well narrated by Emma Bragdon who takes a very practical,questioning,and down to earth approach to this important subject.
It is a short film 33 mins and packs in a lot of very  honest and truthful comment from its contributors.
I was inspired to explore the subject further as a result of my viewing.
A wonderful measured introduction to the whole subject of Spiritism and its contribution to our Health",1201651200,9,948,4.809815950920245
