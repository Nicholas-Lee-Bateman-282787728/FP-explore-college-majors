8112014,4,B000EOTK26,Its a simple video of him jamming...no frills and very plain...the reason I gave it 4 stars is because I just wanted to watch a pro play with out all the flashing light and glamor camera work...It is easy to learn off him and see what it takes for a pro to play what he does...So the concert thing is a little misleading its more like just sitting in front of him watching him play...Which is what I wanted and has helped me pick up a few new licks,1357948800,,448,4.044943820224719
