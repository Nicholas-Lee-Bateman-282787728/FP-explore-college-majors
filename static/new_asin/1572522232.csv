190239,4,1572522232,"Once more I have to make note of the fact that when watching a movie you have to transport yourself back to the time when the movie was released. I often use the example of my uncle telling me of the time he was a child and saw the original KING KONG and then had to walk home among the hills of West Virginia, certain that the ape would be around the next corner. And yet today we view the movie as quaint and it frightens no child. With that in mind think of the year 1977 when Dario Argentos SUSPIRIA was released.

This was a year before DAWN OF THE DEAD was released unleashing a ton of gore onto screens. It would be a year before Carpenters HALLOWEEN filled us with dread and 2 years before the slasher genre kicked into full gear with FRIDAY THE 13TH. So the amount of blood spilled in films was fairly small. Argentos SUSPIRIA received a major push when released to the US and soon found its audience among the many horror fans looking for something new. They found it, and a gratuitous amount of blood, in this film.

The story revolves around Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper), a young American who comes to Germany to study dance at the famed Tanz Dance Academy. She arrives late in the middle of a thunderstorm, pulling up to the front door in a torrential downpour and watching as a young woman runs from the building and into the rain. When she is refused entrance, Suzy heads for town to find a hotel. Along the way she sees the woman running through the woods.

The woman is Pat (Eva Axen) and she flees to the apartment of a friend in fear for her life. She tells her she discovered something terrible at the Academy and then goes to dry herself off. While looking out the window she is attacked by something unseen and shortly after hung from a cord and thrown through a decorative skylight. Pieces from the skylight also kill her friend.

The following day Suzy returns to the Academy and is set up to room in an apartment nearby with one of the other students. After falling ill during rehearsals she is moved into the room once occupied by Pat. She makes friends with fellow student Sara (Stefania Casini) who later tells her of the suspicions Pat had concerning the Academy. On bed rest due to her collapse, Suzy is slow to recover. And at night after dinner she continues to fall asleep quickly and easily.

Suzy and Sara begin attempt to put together the clues they find as to what Pat had discovered. They comb her notes and follow each lead they can. An infestation of maggots forces the students to bunk in the practice room where Sara swears she can hear the elderly owner of the Academy wheezing nearby. The deeper the girls dig the more danger they are in. The truth behind it all is revealed in the end.

Argento had begun his career directing with three films often referred to as his animal trilogy. With SUSPIRA he began working on was later termed his three mothers trilogy, a set of three films that would take 30 years for him to complete (INFERNO came out in 1980 and MOTHER OF TEARS in 2007). The end result of the trilogy is mixed but this, the initial installment, was lauded by critics and fans both.

The movie is incredibly stylized with a use of color rarely found in American films but that seem to be associated with Italian movies, horror films in particular. The use of bright colors by director Mario Bava in BLOOD AND BLACK LACE comes to mind (also available from ARROW VIDEO). Where most horror films deal in shades of black and gray Argentos world takes place in a land of garish reds, greens and blues, all lit to the extreme and very visible. Horror in the shadows is something we expect as viewers, in the middle of a modern day setting with these colors and pop styling on screen it becomes unsettling in a different way.

The story seems confusing at times but can be followed if one pays attention. Like nearly every horror film made there are things that take place to question (such as why doesnt anyone consider that Suzy is being drugged when she falls asleep every night after eating?) but those are minor. Weve come to expect things like that and turn a blind eye to them so that we might enjoy the movie as a whole.

The soundtrack to the film, performed and composed by the progressive rock band Goblin, goes hand in hand with the movie. Argento went on to use them in other films as well and they went on to do the score for George Romeros classic DAWN OF THE DEAD as well. Each note pulses and creates a tension in a style unlike any used before. A rhythm is established when fright sequences occur rather than the sudden explosive outburst of sound wed come to expect in most horror films. It works incredibly well.

The performances are all exceptional and carry over well on the parts of actresses speaking Italian and known for films made there. This was just Harpers fourth film but you couldn't tell from the performance she gives. Shes quite believable in the role of Suzy. Casini does a commendable job as well offering the perfect balance between gossipy school girl and frightened woman once she discovers the answers to what is going on. Only Joan Bennet who began her career in the 30s and 40s before being rediscovered when she went to work on the TV gothic soap DARK SHADOWS seems lacking when it comes to acting skills here.

The end result is an amazing movie given new life by Synapse Films. For the first time the film is being made available in blu-ray format with an exclusive 4k restoration from the original uncut and uncensored negative 35mm Italian film negative. In addition to that the extras are formidable. They include 2 audio commentary tracks with authors and Argento scholars Derek Botelho, David Del Valle and Troy Howarth, DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WITCHES? a 30 minute SUSPIRIA visual essay written/edited/narrated by Michael Mackenzie, SUZY IN GERMANY a featurette on the German locations used in the film, A SIGH FROM THE DEPTHS: 40 YEARS OF SUSPIRIA an all new anniversary retrospective on the making of the film and its influence on cinema, OLGAS STORY an interview with Barbara Magnolfi, the original theatrical trailers, TV spots and radio spots, an opening credit sequence from the U.S. release, alternate all-English opening and closing credit sequences and reversible cover art from artists Joel Robinson.

Fans of Argento will make this a definite must have to complete their collection. Horror fans as well since the film has been hailed as one of the best horror movies ever made. The VILLAGE VOICE ranked it #100 among their top 100 greatest films of the 20th century. EMPIRE magazine ranked it #312 on their top 500 movies ever made list. And ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY ranked it #18 among their list of top 25 horror scariest films ever. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe its not a film that just Argento fans need to add to their collection. Maybe its a film that ALL movie fans need to add to their collection.",1522281600,3,6914,4.544578313253012

The new restoration makes the film look more gorgeous than it already was, and the addition of English subtitles really helps (honestly, a lot of the dialogue is unintelligible at times, and none of the previous DVD releases had subtitles or closed captioning, so this is a major plus).

The transfer is excellent, well worth the 40th anniversary tagline. The audio matches the video transfer. And the bonus feature is included in a disc all its own so that the feature film can have a disc to itself and is thus not compressed. The extra cd of the remastered soundtrack by Goblins is a true gem as well! All in all a true keeper.",1521417600,,517,4.18

190245,5,1572522232,"Well, Synapse Films obviously knows the importance of this film, and the result is nothing short of AMAZING.
This is one of the best restorations for a classic film I have ever seen.
It looks like it could have been made yesterday.
Suspiria has always been one of the most beautiful, colorful horror movies ever filmed and this new transfer perfectly showcases the vivid color palet laid down by Argento and the great cinematographer Luciano Tovoli.
This transfer looks incredible.
Colors pop right off the screen.
Dark/shadowy scenes look crystal clear, no crush at all.
Very smooth all throughout.
The sound mix on this release is also nothing short of amazing.
I have seen this movie countless times in various formats and I seen and heard things in there that I've never even noticed before.
If you are a fan of Suspiria, this release shouldn't even be debated.
This is a MUST OWN for fans.
Even if you already have 3 different versions, then get a 4th.
This is the definitive release to have.

Unfortunately the Steelbook version was super limited and if you didn't get it for retail, the prices have already skyrocketed.
But I will tell you this, it will be worth every penny you spend to get it.

For those who just downright can't afford the Steelbook, this standard release is definitely a perfect alternative and also includes some amazing artwork on the cover.
Includes both discs that came with the initial Steelbook, minus the third disc, which was the soundtrack.

This is a HIGH, HIGH recommend.",1521417600,5,1510,4.8

190263,5,1572522232,"Suspiria is not a scary film, it is in fact quite silly in most respects. However, it is an amazing experience of sight and sound and any opportunity to see this film is generally taken. The use of color is creative and there are more amazing shots than you can shake a stick at. The score literally made the careers of Italian progressive rockers Goblin and is like nothing I've heard before or after. Dario Argento peaked with this film and it stands as a lasting testament to the value of the strange era of giallo and 1970's Italian filmmaking.",1515369600,3,548,4.49
190264,4,1572522232,"The restoration is stunning and certainly the best I have ever seen the film look. I have watched it twice projected on a 110"" screen and it's a feast for the eyes and ears. Colors are incredibly vibrant and flesh tones are perfect. Contrast is excellent, with deep blacks and well exposed highlights. There is very light grain present and it doesn't appear that excessive noise reduction has been applied. There are some shots that are slightly soft or have softness in parts of the frame, but I assume that is part of the original photography. The 4 track mix has been restored to sound like a new mix with good dynamic range, it's hard to believe it is from 1977.

I'm a bit baffled as to why this highly touted 4K restoration was not released in Ultra HD with HDR. While it might not benefit much from 4K resolution, the highly saturated technicolor and high contrast would greatly benefit from HDR (High Dynamic Range). I can only guess that Synapse will release the 4K version in the future and force fans to double dip.

The extras are just ok. Some decently produced documentaries, but lacking input from Argento or any of the main stars. The soundtrack is a nice bonus, but I haven't listened to it yet. For the very high price of this set, it should have included more. As a big fan of the film, I'm ok with paying the price and supporting a small company like Synapse, who clearly spent a lot of time and money to do a gorgeous and nearly perfect restoration. But for most fans, it's not worth the price. I assume a regular release will come out in the next year in the 20-30 dollar range.

So my rating is 4 stars, being held back from 5 because for the high price this set really should have included a 4K HDR version in addition to the 1080p version.",1514678400,21,1764,4.404907975460123
190265,5,1572522232,"Suspiria is a great movie for what it is: a nightmare on film. Like a nightmare, sometimes it doesnt make much sense - but telling a logical tale isn't the purpose of Argento with Suspiria. It is a mental assault! Dont go into Suspiria looking for a carefully plotted film, youll be disappointed. However, as a viewing and listening experience, it very well could be one of the best horror movies ever made.

This is a reference quality blu ray. The colors in Suspiria pop off the screen like no other movie, a garish fever dream on film. The cinematography is absolutely fantastic. The score by Goblin is equally powerful and this is the best Suspiria has looked and sounded on home video. This is a movie you crank up, turn off the lights, and can be mesmerized by! The packaging is also amazing, a wonderfully gorgeous steelbook with magnificent artwork. Synapse knocked this one out of the park. Easily this is one of the best restorations Ive ever seen, along with Universals Dracula.

Now the bad:
Movie arrived a day late (not a big deal but strike one), package was left in a secure place (sitting on the ground in the wet snow by my garage - with a picture added to the delivery notes! Luckily, I was home so it didn't sit in the cold, wet snow for long, but strike two). Then I go on Blu Ray.com and see a link to Amazon for the movie a day later at a significant price drop! (Strike three!)

I reached out to customer service and I hope they refund the difference here because that is pretty lame. Taking a picture of it in the snow like its a good thing is also poor. In the past, my customer experiences with Amazon have been excellent, so Im hoping they make this right and refund or credit me the difference.

So, five stars for this great release from Synapse but one star for delivery. Leaving a movie I paid $74 bucks for on the ground in the snow is a joke. Good thing I was home!!!

Added note: After speaking with a customer service supervisor, Kelly H, they made this right for me. My experience with Amazon customer support was a positive one and she resolved it in a way that was satisfactory! Nice save, Kelly!!",1514592000,6,2136,4.39746835443038

Excellent restoration and suspiria has never looked and sounded so good. The movie is crystal clear and doesn't look like a film made in 1977. To have the original 4 track audio back after 40 years is amazing. Don't believe any negative reviews on this film. It's a piece of cinematic art.

Perfect release for die hard fans.",1514160000,3,269,5.090909090909091
190268,4,1572522232,"This review will be focusing on the set itself - the content, video/sound and extras.

Let me start by saying: for a 40 year old movie, this looks amazing. Compared to the DVD releases (or even the trailers on the 2nd disc) they did an amazing job.

PACKAGING: The set comes in a Steelbook case with the red/black artwork on the front and a very colorful  hallway on the back. Again, this looks amazing. There is a slipcover that goes over the steelbook but I wasn't as big of a fan of that design.. but still nice to have. No issues there.
Inside the case you've got a few movie shots behind the discs; not a big fan of them but again they're behind the discs so again I'm fine with this. One note here is that the case spine is labeled as ""Blu-Ray and DVD"" when there is no DVD included.

THE SET: Inside you've got 3 discs: The 1080p Blu-Ray, a disc of extras and a Soundtrack CD. I'll say right now that I could have done without the soundtrack if it meant an overall lower price. Don't get me wrong; the soundtrack is fantastic but it's something I'm going to put into iTunes and never use the disc for again. If you look at it as a free extra, it's a great little thing - I tend to believe it did add to the overall (pricey!) cost of the set.
On the other side of the case you've got the 2 Blu-Rays.. Once again, I think they chose some bad/generic artwork for the disc art, but it is what it is. You've also got a loose Suspiria booklet which is a fun flip-through and something you'll want to hang onto.

PICTURE: The picture quality is, again, great. I would say it's the best it's ever looked.. but that's a bit debatable. The colors are fantastic, the sharpness is there, minimal grain throughout, good contrast and anyone coming from an earlier release will immediately see the upgrade. For a beautifully colorful film like this, it's a huge upgrade all around. Where it does lack a bit is that it's only 1080p. The film was advertised for it's brand new 4K restoration.. and another company also did a 4K restoration (with the help of Dario Argento) and released a 4K Ultra HD earlier this year. The 4K release does show a sharper image than this Blu-Ray but does look a bit different in coloring/restortion; It makes it a very tough decision on which version is the best. The 4K version runs for about half the price (or less) than this 1080p version.

AUDIO: The audio is also great. It's presented in 4.0 Audio but is clear throughout and did a nice job on a 7.1 surround sound system. No issues here.

EXTRAS: The extras, however, are a bit lacking. There are a few longer features (30 minutes) and the original trailers/tv spots but overall seem to be pretty minimal. They definitely left me ""wanting more"", especially since the 4K version has many more features featuring Dario Argento (which this is lacking).  As mentioned earlier, you also get a Soundtrack CD included.

OTHER: So far it sound good. There are a few gripes (the art choices for the discs and inside art, lack of extras, lack of 4K) but I think the part that makes it all hurt a bit more is the price. It sells for 60-bucks new (but sellers are charging in excess of 100 due to demand). Reviewing it at the 60-dollar pricepoint, I found it to be a bit much when you can import the 4K version for under 30 (including shipping) for what is arguable the better release in many aspects.

One other note: The Blu-Ray does include a Synapse release catalog which features many 'adult' titles; while this doesn't bother me, it can be an issue for many considering that Suspiria doesn't have any adult elements or nudity.
The fact that the catalog also has a paper mail-ordering form (dated 2018) again makes me feel that Synapse is a bit lost in the modern age. At 30-bucks, this would be 5-stars all day. At twice the price, when there are other great options available, it's a bit harder to give it a full must-buy rating.",1514073600,9,3904,4.402219140083218

Colors are eye-popping, detail is sharp, contrast is perfect, and no video noise. A few shots seem unfocused but this is due to the camera focus/panning itself when filming. The color scheme is similar to the older Anchor Bay dvd release. The colors are spot on, very noticeable during natural lit scenes, browns and copper colors are rich and organic. Primary colors pop just like you remember but without bleeding, hot and sharp. The audio is stunning, better than any version yet. I heard subtle breathing/sighs I never heard before. Extras are ok, I don't place a lot of importance on this aspect, the movie is what matters.

This remaster is also the true uncut version! I owned two ""uncut"" dvd versions, but the Synapse Blu-Ray is the real deal. The opening murder scene is a minute longer and I noticed a few other new/restored scenes. Awesome job by Synapse Films.",1513728000,4,990,4.7894736842105265

190283,3,1572522232,"I give it 3 stars only based on the soundtrack, the photography, and part of the plot.
The main premise is good: American student goes into a German dance academy, which in reality is a witch coven.
Strange things happen, so far, so good. The film falls WAY SHORT of delivering on the MEAT.
Any filmmaker can throw buckets of blood, show incredibly cruel scenes of torture and death, but what makes this film fail is basically, THE LOGIC. Make no mistake, when I go see a horror film, I make certain allowances - suspension of disbelief - but with this one in particular, it makes no sense for a group of witches to bring in a new student in order to.... what?
Maggots fall from the ceiling, the blind piano player is murdered in a public square, witches who would be wise to keep their society secret, throw open their doors to anyone who wants to apply, Miguel Bose in tights (yes, really!)... and a whole lot of nonsense that will challenge even the most tolerant horror fan. At one point, the director and writer Dario Argento, just gave up trying to write a decent script that would explain the logic of what was happening, preferring instead to shock through more buckets of blood than even in ""Carrie"". High praise for the soundtrack and the photography. As I understand it was the last film made in Technicolor (correct me if I got it wrong) before the last processing lab in Italy was dismantled and sold to China. The soundtrack by Goblin is superb. But after the first 15 minutes of the film, you see the story is really going nowhere, and it goes from what could have been a great movie, to something just downright stupid. In fact, if you turn off the sound, you can easily follow the film anyway. Watching other Argento films of the era, I see that this is the way he made them. A lot of blood and gore, but nothing interesting to take home.  Lucio Fulci was a better director. Watch ""Zombie"", and you'll see why that film blows this one out of the water, hands down.  There is also this crap about ""The Three Sisters"" trilogy supposedly existing, with ""Suspiria"" being the first one. Don't bother. I watched the other 2.  More nonsense. If you want continuity, watch the SAW, Halloween , Nightmare On Elm Street, or Friday The 13th series.

190294,1,1572522232,"The first time I saw Suspiria, I wasn't a horror fan save for a few exceptions. It would be fair to say that on the average, I hated horror films. I loved the idea of them, but never the execution or writing or etc. So, at the time, my goal was to find horror films that were good, because I believed they were out there. I have friends who are huge horror fans and own large collections of horror films - they recommended Suspiria, praising it as one of the best horror films. I read articles on horror films and lists of best horror films. Everything pointed to Suspiria as a masterpiece of horror. As either the best horror or one of the bests.

So I watched it, not with the high expectations despite it's reputation. I was skeptical of any horror film, and all I was hoping for was a good horror film.

I did not find it with Suspiria. The first time I saw it, I watched it alone and it was incredibly frustrating. There was nothing I saw about the plot or the characters or the events that take place that made me understand the love this film has. It offered up nothing new. And that's taking into account when it was made.

Fast forward multiple years when I watched it a second time with a friend. I wanted someone else to experience the film and give me their opinion, as well as re-watch it for myself. There were a few differences the second time I watched it, probably due to watching it with a friend instead of alone. The main difference is the beginning of the film is so bad, we were laughing. For a bit, I was wondering if it would become a classic in a similar to way to Trolls 2 (as one example).
Alas, once the plot gets going, it quickly settles into the boring, awful film I remembered. All of the complaints and frustrations I originally had, I still had. The verdict from my friend - he agreed with me. So at least I'm not alone in the world.

Suspiria is known for it's lighting and the use of color. So it has some interesting shots, occasionally, but Argento's style isn't enough to save the film by any means.

But I'm not saying don't watch it. At least, not if you're a film lover. If you're the type of person who loves film and loves watching influential films and loves film history, then yes, watch it. Regardless of my hate for it, it IS influential and has historic value. If you are simply looking for a good horror film, I can't recommend this. Instead, I'd recommend Neon Demon which is very much influenced by Suspiria, but improves on those influences a lot.",1501804800,,2500,4.31063829787234

She comes back and everything seems fine for a while until other students go missing or end up dead. I watched Suspiria years ago and I remember completely hating it. The Girls in the Back Row podcast inspired me to watch it again with their beautiful descriptions and their behind the scenes information. The aesthetics are amazing. With new eyes, the Snow White and fairy tale influences are obvious and eerily beautiful. Bold pink, red, or blue lighting illuminates many scenes, giving the sets an otherworldly quality. The wallpaper, tile, and interior and exterior paint lend to this quality with bright colors (mostly pink) and surreal patterns. The facade of the Tanz Academy looks like it was taken right out of a fairy tale with its red paint, gold trim, and ornate detailing. Even blood looks bright pink rather than deep red. The dream logic extends to other aspects of the film as well.

The time period is kind of murky because of all the different fashions. Suzy and the other dancers wear fairly modern clothing. The owner of the academy wears glamorous dresses out of the 50's while the main teacher could have been from the Victorian era. The mishmash of different fashions gives it a timeless, dreamy feel. The visuals and the tense atmosphere are the stars of the film. The music by Goblin ranges from a sweet almost lullaby like melody to jarring sounds and angry, almost unintelligible whispers. The kills are visually interesting with a typical giallo focus on closeups. These deaths are even more stylish and well framed within the scene. The woman falling through the plate glass window is the one scene I remembered from watching years ago because of it's striking beauty for something so macabre. The characters are pretty childish and one dimensional because they were meant to be quite a bit younger. The plot is also pretty thin, but all of the other aspects pale in comparison to the gorgeous visuals and the tense and dreamlike atmosphere.",1490054400,2,2091,4.857142857142857

190330,3,1572522232,"As someone who first saw this in the theater back then (third grade, best age for horror!), i was dazzled and amazed whilst hiding behind my package of Red Vines through most of the movie.  when it finally was released on a 3 disc set from Anchor Bay, i was totally impressed not only the movie held up after all these years but also the love and care that was taken into presenting this classic in its original aspect ration with amazing sound enhancements (DTS EX is a definite plus!).  when i recently purchased the Korean Blu-ray i was excited to get to see this on my 4k television, knowing that there is a 4k transfer coming out later this year.  Needless to say, i am totally let down on this blu-ray release.  the picture is somewhat soft compared to the stellar Anchor Bay release from years ago.  There are no extras here, a nice steel box would have at least cushioned the blow but alas, nothing but a cardboard slip cover.  Not to gripe over the film itself, it's a well deserved horror classic no doubt, just wished there was a sharper image to preserve the integrity of this fine piece of cinema.  It's great that i finally have an upgraded version, just not pleased with the overall results.  If a true horror fan has to shell out the extra bucks to satisfy their appetite, at least meet us halfway, we all deserve better.

190335,5,1572522232,"It was 2008 when I saw Dario Argentos Suspiria for the first time. I went down in the basement/entertainment room to watch the film. It was already dark outside, and in the basement you had big windows where you can see out to the dark woods. I turned off the lights, started the movie, and it gave me chills because I had no idea what I was going to get myself into. I looked out the windows a couple times to see if those eyes ,like in Suspiria, would stare back at me.

By the end of the film, the film creeped me out. But it also became my favorite Dario Argento film, and it still is today.
Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) has just been sent to ballet school,but once she arrives strange things start happening, and the people around her start getting killed off one by one. I know the story detail is short,but I would not want to give anything away if someone hasn't seen it. But its one to check out first if you want to start getting into Dario Argento films.

In my opinion, Dario Argentos Suspiria is a perfect film, and Argentos best film by far. There have been great films by him,but nothing compares to Suspiria. Dario Argento is able to drawl an audience into this haunting, nightmare, and chilling of a film for many reasons. The colors throughout the film, the visuals, the camera work, over the top scenes, and music by Goblin is really what makes this film chilling,but also an awesome film. By far, the music in the film is the best part of this film. Its very simple,but also very creepy. You also have some great acting in this film especially from Jessica Harper who plays a great final girl.

She was actually a character that you rooted for because you never wanted anything to happen to her. The film is also known for a lot of awesome, chilling, and classic scenes including the ending, when one of the lead characters get captured in some type of barbwire, and the best scene by far which involves the first victim who is killed, falls through a glass ceiling, and then hangs from that glass ceiling. Again with all those elements I mentioned, Dario Argentos Suspiria is a perfect film. Dario Argento has made a lot of great films including Inferno and Mother of Tears, which are sequels to Suspiria in the Three Mothers Trilogy. But none of those films compare to Suspiria. Like I mentioned, if you want to start watching Dario Argento films then start with Suspiria.",1462838400,2,2395,4.475972540045767

190342,5,1572522232,"This horror movie is one of the few horror movies that uses obscure symbolism and sources that nonetheless inspires me to learn more about those sources that inspired it. Co-writer Daria Nicolodi says that the essay Suspiria de Profundis inspired many of the scenes in the movie. I haven't read the essay but I have every intention of doing so. Themes of innocence versus experience and the question of artistic success at what cost are two of the underlying concerns of the movie which--I'm guessing--Nicolodi and Argento gleaned from Thomas De Quincey's essay.

Beyond those ideas, however, Suspiria is a beautifully photographed, handsomely designed showcase for rich color, lavish art design, and great suspense. Argento notably avoids the usual clich&eacute;s about young girls rooming together. There's no nudity that I remember seeing. The subdued eroticism is used to sustain tension, rather than titillate. Make no mistake, though--there's graphic violence aplenty, beginning with an elaborate, staged kill-scene that is strong enough for an X-rating.

I always considered Deep Red to be my favorite Argento movie because the plot was more linear and propulsive (though in comparison to Suspiria, that's not saying much). Suspiria is now my favorite. The photography and art design are very beautiful, and the film seems better made--better shot, better edited, better acted, you name it--than Deep Red. Plus Deep Red is arguably homophobic in the extreme. Suspiria, in contrast,  manages to arouse and shock but never to offend. That's a hard thing for a horror director to do. Argento does it impressively in Suspiria.",1457136000,,1629,5.330739299610895

It is the first of a trilogy that Argento has made starting with this one in the 70's.  If you are in the mood for an atmospheric horror giallo type of film...pick this up.

190362,4,1572522232,"I'm revising my rating/review of the Korean version BD. I first watched it on my Mac via Pioneer burner drive with Aiseesoft Blu-ray player/not so great... I rated it low with ghosting type of shifting to movement and a lot of blurriness so I gave it about a 2/5 stars. BUT, I finally got around to watching it on my Sharp 50 inch HDTV using my PS4 which is a decent BD player, and it looks a lot better. I don't have another BD version to compare it to yet and I'm waiting for the Synapse release which will hopefully come out sooner than later. I've seen reviews of other European releases and they looked pretty good. Some of the color adjustments of this version seem off, with some almost orange faces or fluorescent looking faces... so I don't know what's going on there, it can be remedied via HDTV settings/adjustments.

As for the movie itself, it's a classic and most Argento fans agree it's amongst his best. I would give this movie a 5/5 for Argento films overall and rate equally high for the horror genre. This movie has the right balance of occult mystery, bizarre soundtrack, stunning visual use of colors and setting to keep most peoples interest although it may leave hard core gore fanatics wanting. Some of the visual gore techniques might seem camp and dated by todays standards but the movie has an affective occult charm regarding the basic story of uncovering a coven of witches.

I jumped on this when I saw it available for preorder for only $3.97 lol, what could I lose? with tax it was only about $9.00 well worth it in the end. I've noticed the price has jumped up quite a bit. All I can say is that up close watching it on my Mac via the software based player was a horrible experience, painful to attempt to watch, but on a standard BD player or PS4/or PS3 with decent HDTV it looks a lot better. I am curious to compare it to other releases on BD, so I'll get the Synapse when that comes out and I'm researching a bit to decide which past BD version to get for comparison. Prior to this BD release I owned only the AnchorBay DVD and the Blue Underground DVD.

Review of the Japanese King Records version I bought off Amazon Japan store.

smooth HD transfer with vibrant visuals, a bit better than the Korean version I reviewed above. The immediate thing I noticed is that the actors vocal audio tracks were mixed way down even more so than is typical for this great film... their voices sound dull and muddled for the english speaking tracks anyway. For quite a bit more money it's worth it for fans of Argento. It comes with a beautiful red slip case with Tanz Academy graphics. Also comes with a bonus disc interview of Argento but honestly the sound is horrible, he speaks some English but it's so muffled you have to crank the volume and attempt to decipher what he's saying since there are no English subtitles.

The film relies on the setting, and I thought the setting magnificent.  I also loved the story of the three mothers; it was was beyond intriguing, and I wanted more.

Together with a new friend named Sara, they begin to notice weird occurrences within the school and eventually grow curious to the point where they want to investigate. -summary.

 Suspiria is a 1977 horror film by Dario Argento that many horror fans seem to absolutely love. It's arguably his best movie of the 70's to many, and some also consider it his best work. I was never a part of those groups and even after this recent re-watch my feelings are still the same. If I had to choose which of his 70's horror films I felt the most it would more than likely be his giallo Deep Red; and if I had to choose which film was my favorite, then it would be another giallo by the name of Tenebrae. Many people have questioned me on these two and my answer is simple. Yes, I do like Suspiria, but when it comes down to the supernatural and occult, Argento is heavily in favor of style before coherent plots and characters you can feel; this hasn't been the same for his giallos for the most part. I will always prefer a story I can immediately get into before pretty colors and nifty camera work. Also, it's worth mentioning that Suspiria is the first film in Argento's supernatural Three Mother's Trilogy. Suspiria is followed up by Inferno (1980) and The Mother of Tears (2007).

 I can understand anyone who tells me they don't like Suspiria or if they're just in the middle of the road with it. It's definitely about style here for the most part, and this movie is no slouch in the production department, I mean not at all. The movie really is very atmospheric, eerie, and creepy. The terror and spookiness can be felt from the school's architecture such as the walls, lights, etc.; on to the very rain in the beginning of the film that strikes the ground and main character with an ominous force foreshadowing the horror Susie will soon witness.

 The setting and flow of the narrative is dreamlike, and many of the segments can be considered the stuff nightmares are made of; very disturbing imagery and playing of the senses. The masterful camera work and dark settings further work in developing the environment; I also enjoyed the use of vivid colors along with the Goblins music score. They deliver some amazing instrumentals, hard thumps, and creepy voice overs. Argento's talent in utilizing music to enhance the mood is something that I noticed he had down better than the rest of his Italian filmmakers. This style would also carry over into the grisly murders and skin crawling scenes such as the pest attack at some point in the movie.

 Suspiria is very heavy in style to the point where some people will claim that it's completely lacking substance, but this isn't completely true. There is a plot taking place here but it feels heavily masked though. Susie's friend Sara feels that she's on to something in regards to her friends murder. Susie eventually gets the idea that there could be some type of witch craft involved and she searches for answers. Now as far as the weakness being in character development, then yeah, that's something I can ride with. I really couldn't get into the characters. The acting was so wooden that their actions really didn't register with me, and at times, they would speak so low when whispering it was just hard to make out what they were saying; this was pretty bad because these interactions worked towards the mystery. There was nothing about them to rope me in besides being hot, and I need more than that. They just weren't well developed to my taste. Not exactly a problem for me; I also felt the build up was too subtle supporting the work of witchcraft. Argento did his homework covering the legend involving the work of witches; such as working their magic through food, negative reactions towards dogs, and even the quick spoiling of food in their presence. Many people I know have missed this, and it would have helped had the characters been able to research the school, library, anything to not only enhance the story but rope in the audience in case they weren't feeling the setting.

 Suspiria is a supernatural horror film with slasher elements that really isn't for everyone; by my standards, I really shouldn't like the movie at all since it's so weak on characterization and doesn't thoroughly examine its material. When diving into the world of the occult, supernatural, I want some concrete information to completely pull me in. I need more than pretty visuals, but Suspiria is that rare exception where the visuals and soundtrack come off so well done I just can't ignore it. Even if I didn't like it, there's still plenty that would have left a life time impression on me.

 This is a very difficult movie to recommend. If you prefer your horror films to be very straight-forward: there's the killer, she has to run away. Then this movie is not for you. It's way too artsy and it won't be easy to sit through for a lot of people. If possible I would say borrow it, but at best rent it and see if it's your type.

Pros: Masterfully done visuals and soundtrack, camera work, a very stylish work

Cons: Weak acting, characterization, tough to follow plot",1412640000,2,5254,4.647629310344827

190383,5,1572522232,"Like most westerners, I have seen an abundance of films.  I'm a gen x'er whose joints are now starting to ache, walking through the mediocrities of life not wanting to get too worked up about anything.  That being said, I was never into horror movies growing up.  So it was never a genre I sought out.  The ones I did see never scared me and I just kind of found them silly.  So I didn't watch too many.  Here in my early 40s, I have had an itching to catch up on all those horror movies I robbed my childhood and young adulthood of.  I have watched a boat load of horror.  I always thought they would be cheesy, obligatory nude shots, and senseless gore.  As it turns out, I was completely right!!  They are good for a chuckle and I really have yet to be scared from a horror movie.
Being a late bloomer, I guess I can attest that to the reason I never heard of this film till 2014.  I was surfing the interwebs as we all do.  Searching for lists of ""the best horror films of all time"".  A couple lists I found mentioned this one, usually towards the bottom below the Halloweens, Friday the 13ths and the rest of the usual suspects. So I walked into this not expecting any different reaction than any of the other horror movies I have watched.  What happened, however is something completely different.  I wouldn't say I was scared watching this per-say.  The acting was good, the story was ok.  The real candy is atmosphere Argento created.  I was absolutely blown away.  The music, colors, sets, shadows, camera angles created an atmosphere I have never ever experienced.  I found it absolutely mesmerizing.  It's not ""trippy"" or psychedelic. I think it transcends those descriptions into a world and style of it's own. Even though it's considered horror, I think it is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen.  It just floors me that I saw something ""new"" from something I should have seen sooner.  Who knows, maybe I saw it when I was supposed to see it.  Truly a masterpiece.",1410739200,2,1991,4.421487603305785

190385,2,1572522232,"Perhaps this would have worked on a cinematic level, on a huge screen with a great sound system. But the home movie experience is that of bewilderment. The story never really gets off the ground, the plight our our damsel in distress never feels that important. Yes, we know that she's in grave danger from all manner of witchery in the school, none of which raises the pulse...at any time.
Dario Argento and Hitchcock cannot be compared. Hitch relied on masterful story telling and our main character's ark was always a compelling one. In Argento's case he'll set up a death in the midst of the story that really has little to do with anything, but it's a death scene all the same. I'm referring to the blind man's death. Didn't exactly push the story along. And frankly, like most of his films, they have not aged well.
I've never been a fan of Italian horror cinema. If you are, that's fine. They always seem to push to be American in their fake swagger. Lucio Fulci was the worst offender. And he was quoted as saying his films were awful but paid the bills. Go figure!
I concede that Italian cinema has been controversial, spawning a rash of nasties in the late 70's/early 80's that had pre-pubescent teens rummaging through their parents video collection to finally watch a video nasty...and usually disappointed by the terrible acting and awful storylines as I was. Even at 12 I demanded something a little more rewarding.

190392,5,1572522232,"I have read recently on imdb that Argento is remaking Suspiria; a golden opportunity to add to the storyline and turn it into a Giallo with a co-conspirator and call it Suspiria 2. This original doesn't really need remaking. Apart from a couple of effects being less convincing than the previous one , Deep Red, it is a really good film. It was the one where Argento, taking his lead from such as Martino, Miraglia and Ercoli, emphasised how necessary female flesh and apparent vulnerability were to the long term survival of the genre. The Blue Underground print is so clear that I haven't seen the Bluray, but the stills I have seen of the bedsprings scene look no clearer than in the Blue Underground dvd, with the Jpn BR looking best. Introducing the first of the Three Mothers, Suspiria gets your interest immediately with its  red-tinged properties, is gothic and colourful, and seems to be a Giallo until a supernatural thread turns up quite a way into the story.

190400,5,1572522232,"Argento's best known film is probably his most expressive. This is a gem to look at with all it's lush Italian colors seeping out like a blood covered canvas. If you are looking for a horror film for intellectuals, this isn't it, but if you want something that will definitely impress you, you've found it. It concerns an old dance company in Freiburg Germany that is headed up by an old witch matriarch who leads the coven in diabolical methods. An unsuspecting student, played wonderfully by Jessica Harper, finds herself piecing together a mystery when she arrives at the school in one of the most enigmatic and beautiful commencements of a film to date.

 Argento has music, colors, and sounds reverberate like an opera for our eyes to dazzle. He scares us with the rain, the closing of an automatic airport door, and loose tree branches that resemble evil lurking beings. This is one powerful moment. From then on, subtle hints are explored, the supernatural, science, one's faith. Never can we guess what is truly hiding at the academy. One scene of the dance students in the hall is superbly done with loud music, hideous heckling demonic shrieks and strange appearances, this is fantastic eye candy!",1389225600,,1207,4.854368932038835

I just knew that Dario Argento was supposed to be good. So I went to my local DVD store, and picked up the Blue Underground version of Suspiria. Little did I know that I would soon become a huge ""suspirian"", and also a big Blue Underground supporter.
So it only seems logical that as soon as I saw this copy, I NEEDED it. But then I looked at the price, and said ""Nope."" After about 2 weeks, the thing had been nagging me. So I got online and ordered it.
When it got here (rather fast), I ran to the mailbox. I was so excited! When I opened it up, I was not disappointed. There was some stills of the movie, a scene selection, and a little booklet (which contains an AMAZING interview with Jessica Harper). Then I flipped through the discs. It had everything the Blue Underground version had, AND a soundtrack. I was in LOVE. I've been listening to the soundtrack for a couple days now, and I just love it. I have yet to check out Special Features and the actual movie yet though :/. Anyone who loves Dario Argento should buy this. Thanks Anchor Bay, and thanks Amazon!",1367712000,2,1229,4.168067226890757

190415,5,1572522232,"In 1978, legendary Italian, Master of the Murder/Mystery and Horror Dario Argento Directed Suspiria. One of the most important movie in the history of movies (Since Les Frres Lumire invented the Medium) in my opinion. And it stands as one of the best films ever made.

This one is surely one of the scariest and most disturbing movies i've ever seen. My favorite entry in the genre and probably my favorite movie period, all styles and genres involved. Although Argento's work has never been praised for the quality of his actors and scripts (It should never be), neither for his stories and plots (Stories made no sense and mostly in Suspiria. This one is also filled with plot holes.) But i honestly think no one should really care to understand an horror movie but  he/she should expect from it to be scary, gory or disturbing and nothing more.

But the work of Argento himself and the effort he puts into making each scene his own, filming it and then editing it to render it in his own unique way, make this film maker a man apart from everyone else. You can name them all, but none of them can make horror movies and scenes as beautiful as Argento more than often did during his illustrous career, which didn't start with and didn't end with Suspiria. But this one in particular- The first of a trilogy dedicated to 3 witches, each one haunting an ancient residence- is surely the biggest film he's done in terms of making a name for himself. His originality and love of music showed throughout most of his following movies. But Suspiria's music and sounds were rarely matched in the genre.

Dario loves to play with his actors and his camera crew. He loves to play with colours and he won't hesitate to show his audience the most gruesome death scenes in such a gorgeous way (Say for the first murder scene in Suspiria). He's one of the master at using and even overusing the old cliches and he does it pretty well and without shame. Back during the days when the Murder/Mystery and Horror flicks were still fresh, scary and fun, Argento was arguably the master at it.

The story 4 Suspiria: Suzie Banyon (Jessica Harper) is a young American that came to a prestigious Ballet school in Germany. But the European Dance Academy runned by Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett from Dark Shadows) hides some sinister secret. Indeed, one so dark that those who find out about it or try to escape are killed off one by one.

If the story, actors and even the voiceovers could have been much better (In English, i recommend the french version which was really good) these are the only flaws. This witch tale is guaranteed to stay buried deep within the minds of many viewers and todays paranormal flicks could never stand an inch tall in front of this masterpiece. The flicks trying to pay Suspiria the smallest hommage or the smallest amount of respect, taking their inspiration from this flick have for the most part failed miserably sadly.

So, that you like or not Horror, Suspense, Mystery and Giallo movies, you should give this one a shot and instead of judging it for its acting and writing talents, just judge it based on the effort put forth behind the camera, the way the movie was rendered and how they intended to tell the story from the start. The Images, the colours, the score. Because i think i heard that from someone once and i Totally agree and quote: ""Not liking Suspiria, is the same as not liking cinema/movies at all.""

There is little reason to see this more than once or even own it, but is it at least worth a watch? Absolutely! To many horror fans, this ranks right up there with The Exorcist, Halloween or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The problem is this film is too slow for its own good.

The film follows American ballet student Suzy Banyon who transfers to a prestigious dance academy in Germany, only to discover that it is controlled by a coven of witches.

190423,4,1572522232,"This movie is a bit of a puzzler.

The story has a lot of promise, but I feel that it wasn't exploited in the best way in this script. It seemed to lack focus, containing a number of superfluous characters that could have been excised to make way for more footage with our heroine and the key antagonists.

The acting suffers from the same malaise that all Italian movies of the time did - the shooting in multiple languages and dubbing-in of English (in this case) later gives the delivery a certain remote quality. You get the same almost caricature delivery in spaghetti westerns.

There are also some idiosyncratic things that arrived sideways for me until explained in the bonus disc. I generally disapprove of nuance that requires an explanation to avoid derailing the movie. Movies should stand on their own. If you have to explain something for it to make sense you filmed it wrong in the first place (unless surrealism was the intent of course).

The movie is also hampered in that the state of the art for SFX in Italy at the time was not that of Hollywood, which was falling off the brink of Computer Assisted camerawork and the infant CGI techniques that would soon replace older, less satisfying techniques.

That said, this is my favorite Argento movie. The idea is a good one, the set-piece scenes are well composed if sometimes overdone (I sometimes think this film might have been much stronger if filmed a-la Hitchcock rather than a-la Chainsaw) though the sheer exuberance of the blood-and-guts has its own charm.

The young actresses are gorgeous, especially the female lead, who has eyes you can just fall into.

I believe this was also the last occidental movie to be made in technicolor. The use of color in this film is striking, but I looked in vain for any sort of message in the choice of colors. Very clever, though, and I think the explanation of how it was done was probably the best part of the bonus disc for me.

190426,4,1572522232,"The 1975 SUSPIRIA was so unlike most other horror films from its era that its acquired a near legendary reputation, and though its famous extremely violent murder scenes now seem almost comically faked, the film itself has retained its aura of being something very special even more than thirty years later. Part of what helped it is its extreme strangeness: the film takes place in a mysterious dance academy outside Freiburg, Germany where the teachers guard a dangerous secret and where several of the students keep dying in horrible circumstances. Dario Argento, who had made quite a name for himself by this time in Italy for his visually imaginative (but weakly plotted and characterized) giallo films, was helped enormously by a number of his collaborators for this film: his co-screenwriter Daria Nicolodi, who helped him craft a genuinely unusual storyline involving ancient witchcraft; his cinematographer Luciano Tovoli and production designer Giuseppi Basan, who crafted gorgeous dreamlike settings and lights (both mostly in saturated colors) in which to display the mayhem; the music group Goblin, who crafted the famously disturbing score with Argento; and Jessica Harper, his star who makes something genuine out of her completely underwritten part.

Some of the sequences (such as one near the beginning involving Harper watching a young frightened woman run through the woods in a driving thunderstorm parallel to Harper's taxicab) are nearly unforgettable. As always with Argento's films, the whole storyline doesn't make much sense in the end (why are the witches even running a dance academy in the first place?), but this is one of the few times when his sophisticated visuals make you not even care.",1345161600,,1722,5.2846715328467155

The colors are beautiful, unlike any other Italian or any countries horror film in history. Argento has a lot of great giallo and horror films, but this to me is his masterpiece. The film is about a young American female that travels to Germany to study at the famous Tanz Academy. She quickly finds out after a slew of brutal murders that the school is a front for a coven of witches. If you are a horror film fan or just like any genre film this one is a viewing necessity. If you enjoy it the film is a first in a trilogy about the three mothers. The second part is titled Inferno and the third is The Mother Of Tears. Happy chills and thrills",1336521600,,803,4.025

Next I will be getting 4 Flies on Grey Velvet. He may not be Hitchcock but his work us just as enticing. It is all beautiful, planned out perfectly stunning. His work past Opera is not really worthy, but I love them all anyways. If you are even mildy interested in Argento or Giallo fims period, start with Argento FIRST, please, he is the grandaddy of the genre, just like Halloween was for the Slasher genre.",1331337600,,578,4.216216216216216

190433,5,1572522232,"I love this film and had been waiting for a blu-ray copy to come stateside. But I found out this version will only play on B encoded players, such as ones in the United Kingdom.",1330646400,2,177,4.085714285714285
190434,5,1572522232,"I saw this movie in 1977 and almost walked out after the first 20 minutes because of the gory death scene. But if you like mystery and suspense, this movie is worth seeing. I have never seen such vivid colors--the school is a veritable cornicopia of color. Kudos to the set designer, whoever that person was. Argento must have a special affinity for blood red. The camera shots are pretty creative and there are several scenes that will make you jump. The music is some of the best I've ever heard in a horror film. Argento is amazing.
Like I said, I saw this movie in 1977 when it was first released and it has haunted me ever since. I had it on VCR but I finally bought it in DVD. By far, one of the most superior horror movies I have ever seen.  By the way, does anybody know what happened to the actress who played Suzy Banyon? She was fantastic, but I haven't seen her in anything since.",1328227200,,892,4.247058823529412

I myself found this movie to be rather boring and slow. I can see why it was classic over 30 years ago. The visuals and the score(which in my opinion tended to be a bit repetitive) are rather unique. What was eerie and scary 30 years ago may not be for many in this day and age. Some people seem to still like this film but I mostly found it boring.",1327795200,,517,3.933333333333333

Terrifying!",1324425600,2,315,5.0576923076923075
190437,1,1572522232,"Perhaps my dim view of this movie is because I cannot seem to get hold of Argento movies.  In any case this one gets boring instead of better. After a dynamite murder scene early on, the ensuing scenes are far too dark and the music extremely loud. I will bore the reader no further as my title for this review speaks clearly enough.",1321228800,2,333,4.285714285714286
190438,1,1572522232,"Just saw this movie...I have to cast my lot with the majority of the lower ranking reviews here. After hearing so much hype about this movie I was hoping for something MUCH better. The opening ""murder"" is kind of interesting (not really scary) but I don't understand how it jumped from a bathroom window with a hairy creature's arm to a stabbing scene to a hanging scene. Tacky and nonsensical, but probably the best scene of the film because it was unique. It all goes downhill from there at a nightmarishly sluggish pace.

Lets talk about the only features that make this film stand out: the colors are neon sickly sweet, blood the color of bright caugh syrup. The music is GRATING and annoying (I think it was meant to be this way, but I loathed it for the most part)...I suppose it DID work in one scene with the ""barbed wire/slinky"" I thought that was quite effective and the music added to that ONE scene, but overall rediculous interjections of a hissing ""witch"" and weird instumentalization does NOT an atmosphere make. The sets are just strange, somewhat ""carnivalesque"". These total effects do remind one of a nightmare (the scene with the barbed wire/slinky in particular), because it is strange and surreal and your trying to escape but your trapped. I get it.

Overall though, this movie just left a foul taste in my mouth. While it can earn some points for its uniqueness and somewhat artistic value, it is devoid of substance and coherance. The last ten minutes of the movie were ABYSMAL! The massive plot revelation was hokey to say the least and while it was meant to be scary it just made me raise my eyebrows and shake my head.  The story and plot are lacklaster, the characters are empty shallow shells which we never learn anything about, plot lines are introduced (like a possible romance) only to never pick up or go anywhere again. And don't even get me started on the BAT scene. That was one of the most loathsome and absurdly rediculous scenes I've ever witnessed. A one year old wouldn't be scared of that bat! How this all ties to witches, witchcraft or the occult is ANYONE'S guess. The motivations for all characters involved are never fully explained other than that of the herione who just wants to figure out why people are going missing and then get the hell out with her life. Flat, dull, empty.

Overall, Suspiria is a massive failure to me. A unique use of color and some surreal sets does not make up for the total failure of this film on nearly every other level. Compared to other movies of the time like Halloween, The exorcist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Alien this film is pathetic!",1318464000,9,2630,4.613247863247863
190439,4,1572522232,"Yes, I am prejudiced.  I like the movies of Dario Argento, most them at least, and Suspiria is at the top of the list.  The movie is no holds barred and probably shocking to those who have never seen it.  The traditional garish colors are there bringing us into his world of horror.  The deaths are violent and the movie gave Argento a reputation for being a misogynist.  The music is jarring (soundtrack by Goblin).
The plot centers around the magical forces threatening an American student Susie Banyon at a school of dance.  Mystery piles upon mystery.  Curious friends are murdered.  In the end, it is up to Susie to challenge and destroy the evil overshadowing the tall, imposing school of dance.
The directing is first rate.  The plot leads nicely to the conclusion.  And Jessica Harper does a wonderful job of not overacting and showing the pluck she will need to overcome the magic.",1313280000,3,890,4.683870967741935
190440,5,1572522232,"Currently there is considerable diversity of response to Dario Argento's supernatural masterpiece SUSPIRIA. Admiration and enthusiasm for the film is not nearly as universal as it was twenty years ago, when its reputation skyrocked past the level of a cult item. Viewers younger than myself (and I am a Terrible Old Man) looking for the film's legendary intensity often seem put off by it's nonsensical, campy excessiveness.

I think that the camp in SUSPIRIA is deliberate. The casting alone is a clue. Hollywood legend Joan Bennett (of Fritz Lang and DARK SHADOWS fame), Alida Valli (of Welles' THE THIRD MAN and Hitchcock's THE PARADINE CASE), uber-weirdo Udo Kier (ANDY WARHOL'S FLESH FOR FRANKENSTEIN and BLOOD FOR DRACULA), and oddball leading lady Jessica Harper (PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE, SHOCK TREATMENT), all in one movie--and that's just for starters!

The whole thing is deliberately and flagrantly baroque, with an overwhelming emphasis on dazzling decor. If Vincente Minnelli, Ken Russell and Mario Bava had teamed up to make a psychedelic Horror film, it might have looked something like this.

""Over the top"" doesn't begin to describe the film's outrageousness. It ascends from the weird unreality of Argento's ultra-violent Giallo thriller masterpiece DEEP RED to a new octave of visual, aural and aesthetic insanity. SUSPIRIA is sort of a deadpan response to THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW: a glorious pop-art orgy of color, sound and sensation, designed to drive the viewer to screams, laughter and delerium. The test is not so much ""can you take the terror?"" as ""can you stand the stimulation?"".

Argento's phantasmagorias are not for anyone demanding logic, characterization, or a linear narrative. These are mad, blackly comic dream films with no point of comparison to garden-variety Horror or ""Scary"" Movies. Perhaps a background in the Italianate Gothic cinema is a prerequisite to appreciation.

Maybe one had to ""be there"" to fully succumb to the impact of its unique madness. When it first came out, it was utterly wild; there'd never been anything quite like it.

SUSPIRIA is one of my five favorite Modern Horror films. I can't wait to see how Natalie Portman is going to approach the new version, if that ever gets made.

It is not for the viewer who believes ""Saw"" is the best thing since sliced bread or for those who don't like to think through their films.

I explain this to others as a film that asks something from you, its not just to entertain you. You have to be able to lose yourself in the plot and see the building suspense and horror through the eyes of a very innocent young woman. You really have to consider what she is seeing and how it appears to her.

The camera work and color are astounding and you really need to be able to take the time to look at the scenery and experience it as almost a character unto itself. The music adds to the suspense and as the tension builds, the music responds.

The film is artistic, moody, brutal, claustrophobic and an experience, not just a movie. Watch it as such. It harkens back to the golden era of film and not to today's movies.",1304035200,12,1014,4.326315789473684

190445,5,1572522232,"I just want to keep this short...

Suspiria (1977) is an Italian horror film that is bizarre, shocking, haunting, bloody, and colorful all at the same time.  Basically it's about a girl, Suzy Banyon (Jessica Harper), who goes to a very prestigious European dance academy only to experience a bunch of bizarre happenings, such as witchcraft and sickening crimes unfolding.  Can she escape the evil of this dance adademy?

The sets are very colorful.  They sort of remind me of the colorful sets that were used for the 1960s Batman TV series, especially late in the movie.  This is a '70s movie that has that certain psychedelic quality to it.  The musical score is a huge strong point of this movie.  It was composed by the Italian progressive rock band Goblin and is highly effective and really enhances the movie's bizarre atmosphere.  This movie has just about everything you'd want in a horror movie - blood, gore,  atmosphere, darkness, thunderstorms, the supernatural, excellent use of lighting, and a lot of bizarre and twisted stuff.

This is a 2-DVD set with many extras, some of which are theatrical trailers, TV spot, radio spots, a music video, a still gallery, talent bios, and interviews with cast and crew.  The DVD transfer is outstanding.  The movie looks and sounds great.

This movie has always ranked high on ""greatest horror movies"" or ""scariest horror movies"" lists for a long time.  The movie starts out with a bang, then slows down a bit, then finishes strong.  This is a movie where the scariness slowly builds as the movie progresses.  This movie is scarier than some movies that claim to be very scary.

I highly recommend this movie.",1294704000,,1660,4.826241134751773
190446,5,1572522232,"It's a shame that I wasn't old enough to sue Dario Argento for infringement as Suspiria looks a lot like something right out of my worst nightmare. Yeah, pretty damned creepy if I do say so myself. Sadly, I was only 3 years old when this film was originally unleashed & I wouldn't be so arrogant to say Argento was invading my dreams as I'm sure legions of people have dreams much like what unfolds in Suspiria.

By now, any true movie fanatic has more than likely heard of Argento & most would probably cite Suspiria as being their absolute fave even if they aren't hardcore fans of the man's overall work. Unfortunately, it's doubtful that he will ever make anything quite so colorful or unnerving as his quintessential works like Profundo Rosso or the seemingly timeless Suspiria. That's not to imply Argento is a has been or simply has no more music to produce but I just don't anything that could even begin to touch the threshold of something this masterful.

Suzy Banyon has decided to pursue her ballet studies abroad in Germany but may quickly regret the decision. Shortly after her arrival, strange things begin to take place such as the mysterious death of a fellow student. Other eerie incidents follow including an infestation of maggots, strange noises at night, & her sudden decline in health. Of course, all of these things could very well be uncanny or perhaps just mere coincidence but Suzy Banyon is about to learn for herself just who or what runs this famous school and it's unnatural origins.

Although I could talk all day about the amazing colors which are literally to die for, this is a film you must experience for yourself. Suspiria is nothing less than a kaleidoscope of visual terror which has been frightening audiences for over 30 years. Long live Dario Argento & his stroke of genius.",1291075200,2,1817,4.7075471698113205
190447,3,1572522232,"I hardly consider this a master piece. The story was not well rounded and seemed to go in circles a lot till they come down to this conclusion that it was a witch doing the whole thing. Why not a serial killer or some other psychopath? Logically that's what any detective would realize but no they figure out its a witch. I give the director props for his settings, they are good and well made. Plus the coloration was well thought out however I couldn't give much to the music. At first scary and eerie it became more and more obnoxious as the movie went on. Still the movie did have its moments and I would say that it was decent but by no means would I say it was a masterpiece.",1290988800,,681,4.166666666666667
190448,5,1572522232,"Considered one of Dario Argento's best, most suspenseful and most beautiful films. Suzy Bannon [Jessica Harper] arrives in Munich to attend one of the foremost dance academies in the world. But the dance academy has a dark past, a history of dabbling in the black arts, and some of the students think the teachers may still be involved in these nefarious activities. Suzy is the antidote to the evil that has seeped into the school over the centuries, but it will take skill and determination to pierce the innermost walls and secrets of the school. With its over-the-top Art Nouveau sets and Argento's signature use of primary colors, Suspiria is like being a voyeur is someone else's nightmare.

The 25th Anniversary edition contains two discs of additional material which will be of interest to any Argento fan; those who are not fanatical about Suspiria will enjoy the less expensive, more readily available standard release.",1288656000,2,929,5.032467532467533

I see why it got it's classic status, but I think it's a tad overrated and I had my expectations just a little too high. Argento has a certain style I appreciate, but I feel ambivalent about it. Almost like I'm supposed to like it as opposed to it just being my guttural reaction.

This movie was hard to follow first off. The sound quality is very poor making it difficult to follow. I later learned it was because the sound was dubbed in much later and was evidently shot without sound. But nonetheless it's distracting when the sound gets out of sync with actors mouths. That explains it, but doesn't make it any easier to follow the movie. At times it's far too loud, others so quiet I couldn't turn up the tv loud enough to understand the mumblings of the actors. Then the sound effects and background scoring is suddenly jarring at high volume and not in a good way.

I get the dream-like state of Argento's personal style and this movie definitely has it. But it's a little disconnected at times making it hard to understand and at times I felt like ""What did I miss?"" ""When did that happen?"". It doesn't flow very well in my humble opinion. It reminds me of being very drugged with painkillers to the point of being half awake, half asleep and some things just being unreal and later on when one comes to, is wondering what was reality and what wasn't. It's just unsettling, not frightening.

The film making in general for this is good. I loved seeing the spectacular European contemporary sets and it has surreal moments that completely feel like a nightmare. The ""special effects"" are without doubt a very dating quality to the movie, but I sort of enjoy the ""red paint"" blood horror movie era.

The acting is good and I wouldn't complain about it most of the time. It certainly has an old-fashioned 70's era horror film feel to it which personally I enjoy. I'll probably watch it again at some point just to be thorough, but I'm not sure I'd add this one to my personal collection.

In short, I can completely appreciate it in it's own time and culture as a good piece of film making, but I wouldn't describe it as ""scary"". More unsettling and disturbing and bit suspenseful but lacks a big climax. The plot is a lot like Rosemary's Baby, which is one of my personal favorites.",1275868800,3,2517,4.449023861171367

The music and nightmarish settings and the use of the green,red,and blue colors made the film look real beautiful and wicked. A must have for any movie lover.

It's not a horror film in the sense that it was ""scary"" - I think few movies truly are - and I think to refer to it simply as such robs it of its ambiance. The score is mesmerizing, the set is dreamlike, the acting is surprisingly good for the genre and the era, and although I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a perfect film, I do understand why it's referred to as Argento's masterpiece. Watching this film is like watching a Dali painting become tangible. The opening sequence of this film is something that will remain with me for a long time. It won't give you a quick thrill, and it won't wow you with a fabulous plot or intensely graphic scenes like those found in today's gore films (save for one particular memorable death), but it's a great movie if you take it for what it is and don't fault it for what it is not.",1257724800,,922,4.043715846994536

190456,5,1572522232,"Many have said that Suspiria is the bloody mirror image of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and, to be perfectly honest, it is. An exercise in atmosphere and exploitation at the same time, Suspiria is an incredibly violent account of a ballet student who comes to a celebrated dance academy in Germany, which, ironically, is situated in The Black Forest. Well the story really takes a turn for the worst once the student, Suzy Bannon (Jessica Harper), finds out that the school is run by a coven of witches. The story is pretty thin in terms of depth, but never have I beared witness to such beautifully photographed death sequences. I know that sounds morbid, but one has to see it to believe it. What could've became violent exploitative trash turns into beautiful, Gothic cinema that unravels like an onion of bloody delight. On an educated note, the film is very well known for its use of color, and this is because it uses 3-strip Technicolor. This same process was used for The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind. Normal red turns into something of a nightmarish crimson, adding more to this violent extravaganza. A-.",1254528000,2,1124,4.681818181818182

Even the nightmares could not stop me from wanting more and more from this often looked down upon genre. Even today, as bad as they might be, I just can't stay away from some of the worst movies this Genre has to offer. I have always heard about Suspiria and it's visionary director, Dario Argento. I have even seen clips, of the movie, and thought it seemed interesting visually, but for some reason or another I never did seek it out. We'll it did come on one of the Premium channels last week, and I Tivo'd it for later. I sat down very excited with the bowl of popcorn, ready for some horror like I had never experienced. And I waited. And I waited. And I waited.
Aside from the first death at the beginning and a closet scene at the end, the movie never really impressed me.
Is the soundtrack good?
Yes, it's very creepy and excellent, although a little overused at times.
Is the lighting good?

Is the movie actually good?
I really can't say it is.
If your a film buff or a horror fan, and you haven't seen it, then I suppose a watch wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. As I said before, it has it's moments. It also has a really good premise. The whole time I was thinking that if someone would respect the way in which it was shot and the soundtrack, that it would be a great remake. As long as Rob Zombie did not do it that is. But as a movie, it's just not very good. The mood is very well set, there just isn't much going on inside it.",1251676800,9,1659,4.139318885448916

Many fans of Suspiria will claim those who hate it just aren't smart enough to get the movie.  Those who despise Suspiria wonder what flavor of Kool-Aid the fans have been drinking.  I won't rehash the plot since it's been summarized over many reviews, but I do think the film is worth watching (but only once).

I was reading online that Dario Argento was a great horror director so I downloaded ""Suspiria"" to see for myself. The plot was really stupid, what's so scary about a ballet dancer going into a witches' coven? As I continued subjecting myself to it I discovered that NOTHING in it was scary! It didn't have enough gore, over-produced special effects or a really scary looking killer. Another minus was that it's really old.

190460,2,1572522232,"Suspiria is one of those films whose reputation precedes it. I rented it in expectation of the highly stylized, grotesque thriller that fans declare it to be. Instead, I was  treated to an hour and a half of pure, unadulterated cheese. I've seen several fantastic horror movies from the 70's, but this isn't one of them. The root of the problem is the absolutely horrific acting. Everyone talks and moves like they're doing a elementary school play. That is, forced and emotionless. The dialogue in some spots is downright laughable as well.

Now, I love campy horror films (Evil Dead being a great example), but I had higher expectations of Suspiria. I was expecting something that is not common in films of this genre: substance. However, what I received was a mix between campy cheese ala Evil Dead (not a bad thing), and a horrible 80's slasher film. What makes Suspiria different from those movies is that Suspiria isn't trying to be goofy and fun. It is trying in earnest to be a serious film, and it fails miserably.",1244073600,5,1023,4.709497206703911
190461,4,1572522232,"Dario Argento's Suspiria has been called the horror auteur's best film, alongside&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deep-Red/dp/B000KRNG4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deep Red</a>. The first film in his ""Three Mothers"" trilogy and the last film to be processed in Technicolor, Suspiria showed Argento moving in a slightly different direction from the giallo subgenre. Suspiria is not a murder mystery nor is it technically a giallo, although many of the defining elements are present. Suspiria is more supernatural than any of his previous films and includes one of his most legendary death scenes.

Filmed in English, the film stars Jessica Harper as Suzy Banyon, an American who leaves New York to attend a prestigious ballet school in Germany. When Suzy arrives, she sees a young girl fleeing the school and Suzy herself is denied entry into the school. After Suzy leaves, the girl returns only to be brutally murdered in one of the most lauded death scenes ever filmed. It deserves the praise, as it's well-staged, well-shot, and quite memorable. Once Suzy returns the academy she meets Miss Tanner (Alida Valli), one of the instructors and Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett), the headmistress. There's talk of a mysterious directress who's apparently ""traveling abroad."" As bizarre events occur (a seeing eye dog attacking people, maggot infestation, etc.) and bodies pile up, Suzy finds that something more sinister may be happening at the school.

Suspiria is a slow build, despite that first death scene occurring only a few minutes into the film. I didn't find the film boring, but I could see why some viewer's do. The pace does lag and it doesn't jump right into the ""mystery"" of the story like Deep Red did in its opening scene. Argento co-wrote the script with his then-girlfriend and Deep Red star Daria Nicolodi. The script, apparently based on ""true"" stories told to Nicolodi by her grandmother, is possibly the weakest element of the film, with tacky dialogue marred even further by unconvincing delivery. With lines like ""I once read that names which begin with the letter `s' are the names of snakes (hiss),"" the actors can hardly be blamed for not sounding thrilled.

On that note; many of the European actors weren't comfortable with the English language and their lines were dubbed. The dubbing is noticeable, but as annoying as it could be due to Argento's stylistic ability.

Suspiria does have masterful set design and cinematography. The sets (the school in particular) are wonderful. The school is beautifully colored and exquisitely crafted, looking more like an elaborate painting than movie architecture. The cinematography by Luciano Tovoli is splendid and rather complicated. Tovoli works with constantly changing light and effortlessly makes the colors onscreen seem either vibrant or frightening.

Goblin, with the assistant of Argento, delivers a brilliantly creepy musical score that compliments each scene and has become almost as famous as the film itself.

Despite all these brilliant qualities the film has, I didn't fall in love with it the way I fell in love with previous Argento efforts. It's commonly called Argento's masterpiece and a masterpiece of horror cinema, but it's got those who've seen it pretty divided...I think this is due to the script. People who like their horror quick and to the point will find things they like here, but the film does plod along. Those who call it a masterpiece and are devout lovers of this film likely factor the film's style and creativity into their opinion. Suspiria is a well made film of any genre and, as a horror film, it is a masterpiece. It's got creative, memorable, and suspenseful death scenes and, unlike most horror films, it's made by people who know what they're doing but the plot lacks a central hook and didn't draw me in completely.

I won't remember the film for its plot, but for its style and imagery. Argento clearly possesses such a visual creativity he could've easily worked outside the horror genre and joined the ranks of Italian filmmakers like Fellini and Antonioni. Since Argento found his calling in this genre, he did provide audiences with some of the best examples of horror filmmaking out there. Suspiria does prove, even more so than Deep Red did, that horror can be both beautiful and scary...It can be art. I don't believe Suspiria is Argento's masterpiece, but it should satisfy many horror fans and certainly fans of Argento. It really is an impressive effort of any genre.

GRADE: B

NOTE-The lack of subtitles on the DVD is maddening, as some of the dialogue (especially when whispered) is difficult to understand at times.",1241654400,2,4684,5.160737812911726
190462,5,1572522232,"For those unfamiliar with Dario Argento may not realize how big an influence he has. It was thanks to this incredible Italian director that Romero's Original Dawn of the Dead came into flesh eating life, helping with funding, music and even European Distribution of the original film. He even flew Romero to Rome, Italy where the first drafts of the Original Dawn of the Dead began.

Specializing in Giallo (Italian for yellow, from which the term was coined from books of a seedy or horrific nature printed on God-awful yellow paper), the director's best known venture for tormenting your mind is Suspiria. The film has an uneasy and foreboding atmosphere from the get go, even the music reeks of something horrible is about to happen. But that's where it gets you, you don't know when it will happen! When it does it makes most slasher film deaths look incredibly tame by any measure.

Watching Suspiria is like watching a painting come to life, except it starts to grow into an nightmare ever so slowly. Filled with beautiful sets and vivid colors, this film at times has the feel of a musical from how lavish the backgrounds the horror takes place in. Also the lighting, much like the color reference as a visual cue in the Sixth Sense, has a lot to do with what will happen next. Violent is a relatively soft term compared to how brutal some of the death sequences are, which surprisingly is the norm in Italian horror which is often way more over the top than a U.S. production would allow. Compared to today's standards, if Suspiria were a U.S. movie, it would be banned for not being P.C.(i.e. the blind man being mauled to death by his own seeing eye dog) or severely edited for a more PG-13 audience.

All else aside, fans of Saw will appreciate the scene in which one gal takes a twenty foot plunge out a window into a pit of barbed wire and crawls through it to escape. OUCH! Makes me hurt just thinking about it. Most definitely this one will find ways under your skin and most likely into the darkest corners of your mind long after the lights go out....",1240531200,,2068,4.553763440860215
190463,5,1572522232,"If you're on the fence about whether you'll enjoy Argento, or Suspiria more specifically, do me a favor: Watch the first 20 minutes of the film.  It's among the best opening 20 minutes of not just horror films, but any film, period.  It's with this barometer that you will either dive into Argento or shy away from him for the rest of your life.

I hadn't heard of Argento until the late 90's as Dvd was taking hold.  Having grown up in the hey day of slashers, the early 80's, one would think I would have been an Argento fan but back in those days the Italian horror masters rarely got films released here in the states.  When this three disc edition of Suspiria was first released, I bought it and set aside a Friday night to watch my first Argento feature.  I was hooked from the first beats of Goblins outstanding soundtrack.  Then the cinematography floored me.  The color palette was phenomenal and finally the too beautiful to be disgusting violence had me entrapped.  I was never the same after seeing this film, and have now collected Dario Argento's entire catalog.

Argento is like a painter in some respects.  Each scene is brilliantly laid out to get the most mileage out of his canvas.  He's among the finest directors I've seen when it comes to perspective and negative space.  And where this really hits home is in the kill scenes.  Splashes of red fly across the screen, body parts are mutilated, and the scenes go on for longer than should be humanly tolerable, but he makes it so great to look at, you just stare in sort of an admiring terror.  Where Lucio Fulci just grossed people out, Argento grosses you out without you noticing.  It's why I think he's the best horror director of all time, and I would put his top 5 films (Suspiria included) against any other horror directors.

If I were to describe his visual style for contemporary audiences, I would say David Lynch, circa Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive meets John Carpenter, circa Halloween and The Thing.  In fact, if David Lynch ever went full on horror, I believe we would get Suspiria or inferno.

If you're stale on horror of late and need something to shake you up, Argento does the trick.  If you're new to horror, it's highly recommended as a starting point into Argentos library.

So I added this one to my Netflix list and waited.

This movie starts out slow but pulls you in very quickly. As they say in the trailer the last 12 minutes are scary (and they really are), but the first 92 aren't so much.

They have their moments, but what really bothered me was the horrible music throughout! Maybe it was just the version I got, but the sound mixing was terrible. The audio couldn't be heard at all, so I turned up the volume. Then the music starts & builds, & builds, & gets louder, & louder. So I had to turn the volume down super-low. Then the music cuts (part of the director's suspense) and the actors talk, or whisper, and I have to crank the volume up again. And the transfer was really sad. It was really grainy, like it was copied from a VHS tape, and the colors weren't as sharp as I expected from an ""enhanced"" movie. I noticed the widescreen bars at the top & bottom of the screen flickering. That shouldn't happen, should it?

I thought it was a really great movie. Maybe my gripes are just from this weak transfer of the film. There are many different version out there, so just look out for which one you pick up. I'd really consider getting this on DVD, but the poor quality is really a turn-off for me.

It was interesting to find out in the extras why these adult women acted so juvenile. It's because Argento originally wanted to use children in the roles, but I guess he and a collaborator thought using kids would be too difficult. It's also interesting that the film was based on a real story that Argento's former girlfriend was told when she was a kid. This turns up the creep factor when you think of how people acted like nothing strange was going on, mainly the women running the dance school. It took a lot of imagination to think of how to kill off these characters. Some of the ways are really sadistic, and are meant to make people suffer.",1233878400,,757,4.573529411764706

Well, it wasn't. At least not for me. To some people this may be a frightening and effective horror film. Loud, annoying music and the overuse of vivid colors do not make a brilliant horror movie.

This tale of an American girl arriving at a European ballet academy and discovering its sinister secrets is interestingly and strangely executed but it may leave viewers perplexed and nonplussed. (As it did me!) The best thing in this film is the first murder. It's truly over the top and operatic. But the film overall lacks a lot in substance, scares and story. For example: Maggots? What was the point of that, plotwise? There was none. And I had to stifle giggles when I saw the bat on a string, and when I heard the headmistress snoring. Not scary. I know ""Suspiria"" has many admirers. But maybe they saw the movie without hearing all the grandiose hype beforehand.

So I would suggest that it's worth renting to see this film that is on so many of the 'Greatest Horror Movies' lists. You may find yourself, like I was, wondering where the real horror was. Personally I'd rather watch a truly scary 1970's horror movie like ""Black Christmas"" or ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"".

Much of this movie comes off as truly laughable, unfortunately. I don't think that was the intention.",1226793600,3,1456,4.592307692307692
190472,5,1572522232,"Suspiria has a very ominous beginning, and great musical score that is not only slightly scary, and used throughout as foreshadowing, but also appropriate for the plot and main character: Suzie, a ballerina traveling from NY to Germany for a dancing scholarship.  Upon arrival to her new academy she encounters an eerie, gruesome murder of a recently expelled student.  Soon thereafter she falls understandably ill after seeing an anonymous, hideous looking woman (picture the offspring of Capt. Lou Albano and an Eastern European bearded-lady carnival worker) who looks after the schoolmaster's creepy, Little Boy Blue nephew.

Essentially, the movie breaks down as a mystery; the killer, cause, and source of evil is completely unknown and secretive until the final suspenseful moment.  It's psychotic and seductive, a true horror tale that leaves the exposition as minimal as possible and saturates the senses with prolonged action and climaxes.

This is where Argento's reputation is well deserved.  While the story and acting are average, the framing of colors and shadows are wonderful contrasts that can't be avoided; they simply grab a viewer's attention.  The camera angles and scenery are stupendous, with soul piercing close-ups and epic, wide-angle work, each scene is framed with a deliberateness that works perfectly.  At one point a shadow is so masterfully filmed during a chase scene that it appears to be the tormentor or evil entity that seems to be ever-so-elusive in Argento movies.  Brilliant.

For those who want to jump into Argento, learn from my mistake and begin with Suspiria; because, Inferno is not where you need to begin.",1226188800,,1653,5.2748091603053435

I was young when I first saw it so maybe I didn't understand it much then or just didn't want to but I saw this again recently & I really enjoyed it. Everything just seemed to come together so much better now, especially the music which is amazing. The acting, use of colors, all very well done. Im leaving my original review up just for the sheer contrast in them & to see how much my opinion changed over the yrs. Id highly recommend this to any fan of giallo films, Argento, or just thrillers in general.",1224547200,3,1137,4.388625592417061
190475,4,1572522232,"WOW!!!  Talk about flirting with disaster!!  So, clearly I'm not an Argento-phile.  The pig I alluded to would be the film ""Suspiria"".  The lipstick is Dario Argento's visual style.  What I ended up with was a very visually appealing film that could have been 20 minutes long and still not have been nearly as interesting as the hype.  I can clearly hear your cries of protest and disbelief; ""YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MORON!!!  Believe me, I've been here before.  I'm use to it.  You would present as evidence of my suspect intelligence, approval of films like ""Hatchet"" and ""Slugs"".  Yet, I have watched this movie twice and a half and have recently watched four other Argento ""classics"", some of which I enjoyed to a certain degree.  So armed, I will endeavor to explain why this film didn't do it for me on a complete level (yea, this is serious stuff!!!).

-THE PROVERBIAL PIG.
Of course, the ""pig"" in ""Suspiria"" is the story.  Everybody who loves this film, including the amazon.com reviewer up there, willfully dismisses the admittedly convoluted story as extraneous to the brilliance of this film.  I guess I'm screwy because I think that idea is just appalling.  Let me qualify this by saying that I am a professional artist.  I have knowledge of most of the visual arts including photography.  I'm a visual person by nature.  Yet, the visual experience in ""Suspiria"" was not enough for me to give the bloated and shallow story a free pass.  I understand surrealism and the attempt at a nightmarish atmosphere.  Though visually achieving these goals, the story was not given nearly the same attention to detail and thus suffered. Since my first Argento film (Tenebre) my opinion of Argento's story telling has been that he's ""clumsy"".After watching several other Argento films, that opinion has been greatly reinforced.  Not surprisingly, I felt the story could not match the drama of the visual experience.  My bad for expecting the Director to at least find a way to keep things moving.  The result is that I spent a lot of time waiting for something to happen... ...ANYTHING!

-THE LIPSTICK.
There is just too much to say about the visual nature of this film.  Given the time it was made, it is slightly rough around the edges yet visually alluring.  From what I can tell, Argento basically invented the now clich use of red and blue lighting to elicit a creepy feel.  Heck, I use that same lighting on my Halloween displays at home to great effect.  However, the images in ""Suspiria"" are more than just lighting tricks.  He clearly intended to use the primary colors with a few tertiary colors as a palate for everything in this film.  This would include bold paint schemes for the architecture.  Speaking of architecture, as an artist, I love the building locations Argento chooses for his films.  So many classic styles are on display. I almost felt I was watching a documentary on early 20th century design styles. I particularly enjoyed the Art Nouveau interiors of the dance school.  Add this to Argento's love for the creative shot and you have visual heaven.  My favorite shot in this film puts all the elements together as we look through a light bulb; beautiful.  Clearly I enjoyed the visual experience of ""Suspiria"".  To deny that would just be... ...pigheaded.

-LIPSTICK PART II
I'm not sure how many people realize this, and it might be a key to why so many are wowed by ""Suspiria"" on a visual level, but this film was the very last film ever to use the ""Technicolor"" dye transfer process.  This highly stable process insures long term quality of color and a highly saturated color palate. Given these two advantages, this DVD and the film in general, have eye popping colors on top of the bold palate Argento employed.  Though Technicolor was not as realistic a depiction of color as other film, it actually added to the surreal quality of the visuals in ""Suspiria"".

-ONE OF MY FAVORITE MUSIC SCORES.
See, I'm not a total loser!  I thought this music was incredible and on the cutting edge of where music was going at the time.  There are two main themes that get played over and over again, and I have to admit, I kept anticipating them eagerly.  Since this film was made when I started High School, I was much more into the music trends of the day.  This music greatly anticipates the ""New Wave"" African rhythm trends of the late 70s and early 1980s that Peter Gabriel so fervently promoted.  I happen to be an old Gabriel fan so this sat well with me.  The music is simultaneously very intense and sublime while heightening a sense of dread and anticipation.  The problem occurs when not much usually happens in the story to accompany the music.

-SO, WHAT'S WRONG WITH PIGS!?
I have no problem with pigs in general, even when used as a metaphor for a screenplay.  Heck, I love ""Evil Dead II"" and that has the loosest of story threads bordering on nonexistent.  But I love evil dead because it's off the wall and wildly entertaining.  I'd kiss that pig any day.  My troubles with the ""Suspiria"" story are lack of dynamic or interesting developments.  Now here is where many put up the red flag and say ""you miss the point"".  Of course I would argue that I didn't.  I've heard explanations of Suspiria's story that go kind of like this:

""...things happen which don't always make sense or get explained, and things move slowly.  But this adds to the surreal, nightmarish experience of ""Suspiria"".""

I agree with two of those points.  As far as the nightmarish experience, I'm not feeling it.  Oh, visually and musically this film has ""creepy"" and ""nightmarish"" written all over it.  However, more often than not, there is nothing going on in the story to make me feel that way.  Often, defense of the bloated story sounds like excuses to me.  This is a story that could be told around a campfire in 20 minutes.  I don't mean to oversell my dissatisfaction with this film.  I didn't hate it.  But when the most brutal and frightening moment in the film occurs in the first 15 minutes, everything else is a bit of a letdown.  Ultimately, it was the lack of fear or dread compounded by overwrought attention to mundane action that bored me with ""Suspiria"".

-FLAP, FLAP, SCREAM, WAVE, FLAP, FLAP...
To further the lack of scariness, a few very silly and unintentionally funny scenes appear in ""Suspiria"".  One involves what might be the worst fake dog head ever.  Other things about that scene are funny too, but I've said enough.  The other is a scene with a bat that highlights why this film lacked the proper ingredients for me to bestow greatness upon it.  In this scene, a character is attacked by a little, fat, motorized bat.  Now, this sounds funny enough, but there is more.  Said bat attacks for what seems like 5 minutes.  All the while, his victim waives arms and screams with little conviction while standing in one spot.  Finally, the bat flies off into the corner and apparently tries to flush the toilet.  I'm kind of joking because I'm not sure what the little bugger was doing.  Finally he decides to attack from the ground; ""hump, hump, hump"", he thumps towards the still stationary victim.  It ends quite beautifully but I won't elaborate.  Unfortunately, I laughed very hard at this stuff.  Immediately after this diabolical bat attack, the mood of the film was completely moot to me.  Nothing happens after that to make up for a complete lack of dread or fear on my part.  It just wasn't good enough.

-IT'S SCARY BEING ME.
Sorry Argento-philes; the story here is just too uneventful for me to bestow greatness on ""Suspiria"".  The film does a lot of things in a great way but the overall story lacked the required substance to keep me on edge.  Not even the glorious visuals in Technicolor combined with one of the best soundtracks ever in a horror film could make me sit on the edge of my seat or scare me for that matter.  I will admit that the second viewing was better than the first, so thank goodness I deferred reviewing after one look.  However, the enhanced enjoyment wasn't because the film got better in my eyes; it was because I knew to pay more attention to the visual and musical aspects than to invest effort into the story.  Yet, all the coolness of image and sound could not overcome the hype of how scary this movie is supposed to be.  A little bit edgy?  Okay.  But without a flowing, eventful, scary story, this film will always be incomplete to me.

190476,5,1572522232,"This was the very first Dario Argento movie I've seen when I rented it a few years back! Needless to say it still blows me away.  This was indeed Dario at his best and truly focused.(Albeit thankfully not the last time,mind you) I mean what can I say you get a gripping story with a seemingly harmless(at first) Ballet/Boarding School,that ends up run by wicked satanic sorcerer(ess) types including a creepy spellbinding old crone named""Elena Marcus!"" In general as nasty as the character Miss Tanner proved to be! That was a worthy performance! The soundtrack by Goblin was much like the movie in that it was creepy and atmospheric! Naturally I love the way that Dario uses stunning colorful lights with his reds,darkish blues and occasional yellows! Granted this movie didn't possess any groundbreaking/breakthrough special effects like Star Wars did in the same year this movie came out. But it does possess a look that can't be compared with anyone elses,it's quite atmospheric,stylistic, claustrophobic in most scenes, not at all predictable, full of suspense and horror/terror and best of all I get really excited at the end when the main character Suzy Bannion not only finds out that all the staff members of the ballet academy are against her and are satanic sorceressses but the race against time insued when Suzy meets the infamous Elena Marcus aka The Black Queen,aka The Directress aka Mater Suspiriorum. Anyhoo I also love the way that after valiantly defeating the ""old crone"" everything starts to explode and fall apart as the academy collaspes forcing Suzy to naturally get the hell out of there! The murder scenes possess a certain uniqueness to them as well. My most favorite ones would definitely be: The scene where the lovely Sarah is trying to block the door from whomever is after her and as she crawls out of the window inside the room she lands in this wirey materials(of which I like to refer to as ""The Slinkys of Death) that leave her perfectly immobile enough for the killer to victimize her, and the earlier scene where the escaped girl who tries to tell Suzy how to stop sorceresses first gets stabbed brutally then hanged to the point of crashing through the stain glass up above only to have its parts fall on her roommate was pretty unique! Other than that even though it was a brief cameo I was thrilled to see a younger Udo Kier(Johnny Mnemonic,Blade). Beyond that there's not much more I can say to truly do this movie justice 'cause it needs to be seen to be believed and indeed appreciated! All I will say is this movie is gorey and violent at times and features an unsettling yet thankfully brief scene of maggots falling from the ceiling. But for those who don't want to always follow the same conventions of an American or Canadian horror movie or just want an awesome and gripping murder mystery ""Well Look No Further! And remember despite it all "" You Can't Really Kill Elena Marcus! LOL!",1224288000,,2934,4.764243614931238
190477,4,1572522232,"A lesser-known cult classic, Suspiria has been hailed as a masterpiece, a ""candy-colored nightmare"". Often called director Dario Argento's best work.

The film may not frighten people today like it would have 30+ years ago when it was made, but it still manages to be effectively frightening though not in the conventional sense. The colors and set pieces combined with an eerie score give it a highly stylized nightmarish quality.

Suspiria is unique among its genre. It is just as much a work of art as it is a horror film, something you just don't see anymore.",1224115200,,563,4.793814432989691
190478,5,1572522232,"The Italian maestro of horror, Dario Argento's first installment of his ""Three Mothers"" trilogy begins with ""SUSPIRIA"" (1977); arguably the most beloved of his films in the 1970s. There has always been debate among his fan base whether this film or ""Deep Red"" is his masterpiece. Some say it should be ""Tenebre"". For me, I am still somewhat undecided. I like his psychological ""giallos"" as much a his occult films. Whatever you prefer, ""Susperia"" is a dark fairy tale that will forever be remembered in the journals of horror films.

One dark, dank and stormy night, an American ballet dancer named Susie Banyon (Jessica Harper) arrives in a ballet school in Freiburg. This European ballet school is ran by a mysterious woman named Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett) and Miss Tanner (Alida Valli). A number of mysterious deaths and horrific crimes begin to occur in the school shortly after her arrival. Apparently, they are linked to the school itself; while the area on which the school stands on has a relation to a certain ""Black Queen"", a practitioner of the dark arts of the occult and witchcraft.

The film's plot is quite light when compared to ""Deep Red"" or even ""Tenebre"", but this fact doesn't make this film any less eerie or suspenseful. From the opening act the film exudes a dark and moody feel, Argento's magnificent eye for visuals are at its best. It took me at least two viewings to truly appreciate ""Suspiria"". The use of vibrant colors I've read became a revolutionary palette for the horror maestro, and to think that he used obsolete Technicolor film rolls to shoot his film.

The first act of the film remains as one of the most memorable sequences in horror. The opening act's death scene is truly violent and very ""artsy""; that it grabs the viewer by the throat just to let him know what he is in for. This is a familiar formula for Dario Argento, as displayed in ""Tenebre"" and ""Deep Red"". Most of his films display a shocking murder and/or death sequence as ""shock value"". The director really does know how to get under one's skin with an unnerving sensation. It is quite curious that Argento (with co-writer Daria Nicolodi) owes his inspiration for ""Suspiria"" from a Disney animation--""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". I've read that the film was originally intended to use a children's school as its backdrop but for reasons unknown to me, that idea was abandoned. (perhaps it would generate too much controversy?)

""Suspiria"" has a decent share of ominous atmosphere. Argento uses vibrant colors, intimidating and spooky architecture, the use of shadows, combined with Goblin's ominous music all contribute to the film's effectively creepy screenplay. The film also applies some lore from witchcraft and the occult as it takes a look at the mythology about witchcraft. Food does spoil a lot faster when it is within the confines of witches, at least according to legend. I do think the director has a certain curiosity about witches that led him to create one, if not the most involving tales about the subject. The scientific definition of the occult is also defined which adds to the film's credibility. Daria Nicolodi is to be credited for some of the film's creative inputs as she supposedly told Argento about her grandmother who had a similar experience in a school that practiced black magic. Whether this is fact or a rumor I would not know.

The performances by the cast is quite decent but not entirely flawless. Jessica Harper does give a decent performance but I rather thought that she lacked some chemistry with Stefania Casini. Nonetheless, Argento is able to make this a very minor setback as he bombards the screen with his signature ingenious camerawork along with cinematographer Luciano Tovoli. I was in awe as to how the death of the blind piano player was set up. It was suspenseful and freaky, with great use of pans, reverse zooms, close-ups and moving shadows. Aside from the opening's death scene, this would be my favorite sequence in the film. Argento is a master of simple visual manipulation. I was a little disappointed that this installment had no nudity but I supposed it fit the film's pace. There are quite a few gruesome scenes carefully placed in the film's proceedings.  ""Suspiria"" has definite Giallo influences in its opening marks just before it goes into overdrive.

Dario Argento may have more style in his supernatural films. His Giallos and his occult films are like apples and oranges, they`re both good but can`t be compared. Regardless, however you may feel about ""Suspiria"", whether this is your first Argento film or you're a big fan; the creative death sequences, the maggot attack (or shower), the dog mauling are stuff that are truly noteworthy in the film. For a film made in 1977, it is way ahead of its time. The use of colors, manipulation of the senses and very creepy atmosphere make this film one of Dario Argento's most celebrated works, and it still holds up to this present time.
Highly Recommended! [4  Stars]

The 2-disc 25th Anniversary Dvd by Blue Underground has a THX-Certified re-mastered picture and the sound mix has both 5.1 Dolby Digital and 5.1 DTS. For a film made in 1977, it looks real pretty.",1223942400,,5195,4.841216216216216
190479,5,1572522232,"Suspiria is one of the horror classics that seems to divide horror fans; some cite Suspiria as a masterpiece of the genre and one of the greatest horror movies ever made, while others see it as boring and nowhere near the hype it has gotten. And at first I was one of those who would state it as boring and over hyped. Upon my first viewing I was like this is the classic Argento movie people hail as one of the greats? At the time I wasn't really into Argento. While I didn't dislike him I can't say I was a fan.

But than I went back and gave his films another chance and suddenly found myself loving these movies I originally thought were about average. So I figured might as well give Suspiria another chance; and watching it the 2nd time I hoped my opinion would change, but I still expected the absolute worst. But my 2nd viewing I just fell in love with this movie and now I'm one of those people who praise it as a masterpiece of the horror genre.

Dario Argento has a very strong visual style and more often than not the plot takes a backseat to his visual style and I understood that going into this film and all his others. But for some reason I just couldn't get into his work where as now you'll be hard pressed to find a bigger fan of Argento than me. I would recommend to anyone out there who didn't like Suspiria to give it another chance. If you still dislike it than maybe it's just not for you, but I know besides myself a lot of people disliked Suspiria at first and now love the movie. Suspiria really is one of those movies that gets better and better on multiple viewings.

The screenplay was written by Dario Argento and Daria Nicolodi and if you were to find any flaws with Suspiria this would be it. While not badly written at all the script is the only weak point of the film. I always mention in my reviews for Argento movies that he at times can be a good writer. The Bird with the Crystal Plumage and Deep Red had very solid scripts and even though I thought The Cat o' Nine Tails was about average the script wasn't bad. The only problem though is in my opinion Argento has never written a really iconic character even in his better scripts. Around the time of Suspiria is when the writing took a backseat to his visual style and use of colors.

The script wasn't bad, but just suffers from weak characters; while I wouldn't say the characters are bad or anything they do lack of depth and aren't fully developed, but oddly enough I'd rate Suzy Bannion played by Jessica Harper as one of Argento's better characters despite any lack of depth. The script does mostly work, but this is the kind of movie that without the right director would be a boring disaster of a flick. Sometimes you have movies that while aren't poorly written or anything like that, but could be very boring.

As director Dario Argento crafts a masterpiece of a film; the opening act is downright chilling and after that Suspiria does slightly slow down, but Argento's visual style keeps Suspiria creepy and interesting even if it's a bit slow. The use of colors in this movie is just simply amazing. Suspiria just might be the best looking movie I have ever seen, but you can actually make a case for several Argento movies, but Suspiria just might be the best. The look of Suspiria is very much like a nightmare and that is something most Argento movies have going for it. It's also like this twisted fairy tale and all these elements are what elevate Suspiria to a classic of the genre. The best way to describe Suspiria is it's like a nightmare that may not make a whole lot of sense, but is quite chilling.

There is so much that goes into directing besides simply storytelling. Granted that is the most important aspect, but there is more to it than that. Dario Argento may not be the best storyteller in the case that his flicks sometimes have a weak plot and maybe characters that lack a little depth, but what he might lack in that area he more than makes up for with suspense, tension and plenty of scares. And again I go back to Dario's visual style, which is what makes him stand out so much and again that is what makes Suspiria so brilliant. As I stated before the opening act is downright chilling and while the movie might slightly slow down it never loses the eerie feeling. The visual aspect and use of colors are the most amazing I have ever seen. Again Suspiria is simply a beautiful movie to look at.

Another thing Suspiria has going for it is the score by Goblin; these guys are just amazing and have worked with Argento several times and Claudio Simonetti of Goblin has worked with Argento on almost all his movies and he's probably my favorite composer of all time. The score by Goblin is just mind-blowing and their score adds so much to the movie and makes it downright chilling! It's really hard to say, which score by Goblin is their best these guys have done such great work with Argento and with other filmmakers as well, but in the case of Suspiria, well this could easily be rated as their best score.

As I stated earlier in my review if you've seen Suspiria and didn't like it give it another chance and if your opinion doesn't change than the movie just isn't for you. But Suspiria is a movie that might take a couple of viewings; many fans of this movie disliked it at first and like I said I was one of those people as well. Forget the plot and all that and watch Suspiria for its visuals and you might just start to like it.

Suspiria in my opinion is a classic horror flick and deserves all the hype it gets. Many hail this as Dario Argento's best flick and while I understand why I'm not sure I would rate this as my favorite by him, but no doubt it's in my top 5 and in my top 20 favorite horror flicks of all time. For those new to Dario Argento I would recommend you check out his work in order; this way you can see how he evolved as a filmmaker. Suspiria is a movie you'll love or hate, but I urge people who disliked this to give it another chance and if you still dislike it that's fine, but Suspiria is very much a movie that takes more than one viewing.",1222992000,3,6106,4.307223672758921
190480,5,1572522232,"I would not classify this as a horror movie. It was not scary or gory to me at all. I think suspense might be a better description. It had one of the most creepy movie scores for it's time, and even now for that matter. The atmosphere, the creepy music, the killing scene at the beginning, and the amazingly vivid and colorful scenes make this a really good movie. I'm amazed this movie was made in 1977, and I'm glad I caught this on IFC a few years back, or I never would have heard of this movie.",1222128000,,499,4.1020408163265305
190481,5,1572522232,"Like myself, many Dario Argento fans have long awaited the American release of ""The Mother of Tears.""  It is the third installment of the Three Mothers Trilogy.  (At the Toronto International Film Festival, Argento hinted at a fourth film, a prequel.)  The classic horror film, ""Suspiria"" is the first installment.  Before seeing ""The Mother of Tears"" for the first time, I wanted to revisit ""Suspiria.""

  First, let me give you some history about the Three Mothers.  In the eleventh century, there were three sisters who were evil witches.  They traveled the world, accumulating great wealth and spreading death.  The oldest one (Mater Suspiriorum or the Mother of Sighs) was Helena Markos; she settled in Germany.  She established a school of witchcraft which the locals condemned.  Helena was killed.  Soon afterwards, the school began teaching ballet instead of witchcraft.

  An American student, Suzy Banyon (Jessica Harper of ""Minority Report""), arrives at the ballet school.  The teachers, she soon discovers, are witches who are viciously murdering anyone, students and faculty, who offend them.

  Critics and fans have hailed ""Suspiria"" as a masterpiece.  Allow me to quickly explain why it remains a favorite of mine.  ""Suspiria"" is the perfect movie to watch on Halloween.  It is spooky, creepy, and nightmarish.  Filmed in primary colors of blue and red, ""Suspiria"" has a nightmare quality.  It is obvious that Dario Argento was highly influenced by the Master of the Macabre, Italian film director Mario Bava.  The soundtrack, provided by Goblin, is positively eerie.  The death scenes are some of the most vicious I've ever seen.  The supporting cast is awesome.

  Joan Bennett, who portrayed Madame Banc, was a treat to watch.  She is the veteran actress of the daytime soap, ""Dark Shadows,"" which was the essence of gothic.  This soap opera had ghosts, witches, warlocks, vampires, werewolves, and other supernatural creatures of the occult world.  She was a perfect choice for portraying a witch.  The stern, masculine Alida Valli was the perfect choice for the intimidating Miss Tanner, another witch.  She was in Mario Bava's ""Lisa and the Devil"" and would later act in ""Inferno,"" the sequel to ""Suspiria.""

  While watching ""Suspiria,"" the usage of telekinesis and the fiery climax reminded me of ""Carrie.""  Also, the witch conspiracy was reminiscent of ""Rosemary's Baby.""  Both movies are horror classics.  ""Suspiria"" is also a classic that is required viewing by all horror fans.  Every fan of Dario Argento has seen ""Suspiria.""  It was the movie that turned me into one of his biggest fans.  I recommend watching it again before seeing ""Mother of Tears.""",1221264000,6,2681,5.1756440281030445

190488,1,1572522232,"Lately I have been craving a good horror movie I have not seen before. When I saw this at the video store, and noticed it was an older movie, made int he late 70's and said it was the 2-disc collectors edition. So I figured it must be a classic movie if it's 2 discs from that time period.

Also on the cover it reads, ""the only thing more terrifying then the last 12 minutes of this film... are the first 83""

*BUZZER SOUND*
WRONG!

I was bored after the first ten minutes of this movie. The opening seemed OK and looked promising, but once the ""actresses"" start talking to each other, I had to cringe, it sounded like bad over dubbed voices that you can find better quality from in a porno movie.

There was a couple of scares here and there, but they still left me yawning. The more this movie went on, the more bored I was becoming. And I have seen enough of these kind of movies where I force myself to watch it to the end in hopes it gets better then to bother doing it again with this one. So I switched it off.

I dunno what the fascination with this thing is. It was dull, boring, slow paced, the sound of there voices was *cringe* and I really could not bare to see where it was leading to in the end.

It may have been lit nicely so you can see the rain in dark out side shots nicely, but the color inside the buildings they where in was nauseating to say the least.

I dunno, maybe it got better at the end, or maybe you need a mind set that finds Clockwork Orange to be a great movie and think Napoleon Dynamite is actually funny.

I don't care if I get 1000 replies in disagreement, this was how I saw this film, I gave it it's chance, and it did not appeal to me at all. The editing needed to be cut down to give it a faster pace, and the music, good god, who the hell composed the score? It still gives me a headache thinking about it.",1213315200,11,1851,4.024523160762943
190489,5,1572522232,"First of all, I what to say that people who have rated this movie less than 4 stars don't know nothing about horror movie, because after viewing more than 1500+ horror movies, this one is in my top 3 best horror movie of all time. Second of all, Halloween by Carpenter may be one of the best horror movie ever made but it's not the only one. Third of all, Halloween might not have been made if Suspiria did not exist, because it's one of Carpenter favorite movie and it influence him to make horror movies.

So, why it is that praise and that popular? It's simple, the atmosphere, the incredibly creepy music, the great and shoking killing scenes, the ingenious use of color and the slow pacing of the action, are what you need to make a really scary horror movie.

190490,3,1572522232,"Seeing as over 30 years have passed between the initial release of Suspiria and today, it is awful hard for me to say what effect it would have had on me had I been alive to see it when it first hit theaters. Maybe at the time it would have been different, but after watching it for the first time today, well...sorry, but I don't see what the fuss is all about.

All right, I can see how the blatant employment of what appears to be well-hidden red, blue and yellow 30-watt bulbs may have been experimental for its time. And the score does a fair job of creating mood. The problem is that these things come across as transparent and lazy attempts to sift some actual artistic merit out of the bland, unsatisfying stew of a plot. The story here is so weak that it seems a mere afterthought to the visuals. As though Dario Argento just needed some crap for people to say for a few minutes in between drawn-out camera shots awash in primary colors. The dance academy is actually a witches' coven. Really, now? I understand the point must have been to create scenes evocative of nightmares, but much of it seems forced. No matter a movie's alleged contributions to the form artistically, if the story sucks then I just can't give it too much credit. It seems to me that Argento might have been better off not bothering with a plot, let alone one this paper-thin, and just gone with a surreal collage of images and sounds. That would have lent it a more ""hallucionatory"" feel anyway, which seems to be his primary concern. Since it would take up too much space for me to go into detail about all the weak spots in plot and dialogue, I'll sum it all up with: ""If I count their steps, I can figure out where they're going."" By the time Suzy solves the ""mystery"", I'm still trying to solve the one about why I should care.

Just as awkwardly forced into the proceedings is the score. For the first few minutes of what I take to be the de facto theme song of the movie, I was pretty impressed. A hauntingly simple minor-key melody that descends and returns, its unrelenting repetitiveness building almost unbearable tension, the apprehension of what horrifying event is just moments from taking place, and...boom. Nothing. Scene change. The music stops so abruptly that it sounds like someone hit the pause button. This happens many times throughout the movie. I would estimate that song to be playing over around 1/3 of the 98 minute duration. Maybe more. Sometimes it does lead to a horrific scene, but most times it seems to be abused in a cheap attempt to build suspense that the plot can't supply. And then nothing will happen. I've read a bit about the supposed brilliance of the score to this movie in its creating an underlying sense of unease and tension. For the early part of the film, I would have agreed. But not long into it, the tension and unease come not from genuine craft of fear, but rather from tedium and ear fatigue. A movie like this should put you on edge, and it does; it just does it in the wrong way, and the overall effect is for me to want to stop watching. Not because I'm scared in any way, but simply because it is almost too monotonous to bear.

So there it is. Perhaps on repeated viewings I will change my tune on this one, but I somehow doubt it. I give it 3 stars instead of the 2 I think it deserves right now due to its evident status as an artisitic landmark in the horror genre, but I just can't be impressed by this. Don't get me wrong, there were some things done well. Argento often succeeds in his attempt to create trippy visual atmospheres, and I can't deny that I was provoked to cries of ""oh, god!"" during the girl's dive into the razorwire pool (I found this scene much harder to watch than the first, and far more talked about, murder scene), but overall the movie was funny at best, and excruciatingly boring at worst. Seems to me like one of those ones people claim to ""appreciate"" because they want to sound intellectual, or maybe I just don't get it. Either way, it seems like a classic case of style over substance to me.",1211414400,4,4070,4.409574468085107

Let's ignore for a minute that the special effects were awful and that the acting was terrible.  There's so much wrong with this movie, I don't want people to discount my criticism simply due to the era in which the movie was made.  The plot was fragmented, choppy, and unbelievable.  The characters were stale and uninteresting.  And that damn song they use to build suspense was more overplayed than the Macarena.

The dvd quality is fine and I'd recommend this movie to any Susperia fan. My complaints are witht he movie itself. After the promising graphic and gory murder scene at the beginning of the movie, it tends to drag and falls into a slow lumbering pace (i.e. boring). There are a few more thrills like the person getting caught in the barbed wire scene but overal the movie was kinda lack-luster. I can see why it gets credits for its artistic style, but I was dispointed in the movie. Maybe it seemed a lot scarier and better when originally viewed in 1977 you might say...true but I still get scared watching ""Halloween"" and that came out in 1978 and Ive seen it over 100 times. I doubt Susperia will spend anywhere near that much time in my dvd player. That being said I do plan to watch it again just to see if I ""get it"" this time...better take a few No-Dozes first!

190493,5,1572522232,"After years of reading great reviews about Suspiria I just had to give in an see what the buzz was about. This film is a work by famed Italian film producer/director/screenwriter Dario Argento and seems to be considered his best or most known work. This guy is pretty much a hero in the horror community. It was his first work where he took a step into the side of the supernatural as part of a trilogy being followed by Inferno & The Mother of Tears. Luckily all the buzz I read was correct because this film was something else.

Throughout the film Dario Argento uses lighting to capture the pure elements of horror. It just gives you a very uneasy feeling. This film is far beyond the typical horror you will find out there today. If you put this one up against todays films there really is no contest. It does move a little slow at times and does jump from scene to scene at certain points but not nearly enough to give it a bad rating. I thought it was great and would recommend it to any horror fan.

On the day she arrives, one of her fellow pupils is murdered, and in the weeks that follow a number of strange occurrences happen. Could it be that the dance academy is really run by a coven of witches? Why would a coven of witches even want to run a dance academy in the first place?

Along with Dario Argento's previous film, ""Deep Red"", ""Suspiria"" is considered to one of Argento's masterpieces. I recently watched both films, one after the other, and in my opinion, although ""Deep Red"" has the better plot (""Suspiria"" is barely coherent at times), visually, ""Suspiria"" is the better film. Dario Argento is renowned for making some of the most visually stunning horror movies of all time (this man can make a gory murder a thing of beauty) and in ""Suspiria"" he has some of the most visually stylish shots of his career and of any film that I have ever seen. ""Suspiria"" also has a chilling score, written by the Goblins, that perfectly sets the scene and is my favourite score of all time.

""Suspiria"" is the first film in Argento's ""The Three Mothers"" trilogy, the second film being ""Inferno"", and the third film being the recently released ""Mother of Tears"", which was made 30 years after ""Suspiria"".",1206144000,,1331,4.732758620689655

190498,4,1572522232,"In my opinion the brilliance within this film comes from its truly original style and unique haunting atmosphere. The cinematography in Suspiria appealed to me, Dario uses death in this film like a work of art and is very experimental in the way he kills his characters off, i get this impression from the colors and tones of the blood and gore which he uses in his killings and oddly although being a very haunting horror film it was quite nice on the eyes, the visuals are fantastic!

The lighting within this film was a revolution and has much influence on a lot of the films seen today especially in the horror genre. The constant lighting changes within this film dances with brilliantly orchestrated sound tracks much in a way that gave me a sence of hell on earth and also appealed to me amongst some of the best horror music i've heard. The film has a very demonic like atmosphere.

I notice some of the other reviews in line comment that although visually fantastic they take the film as boring, but i just have to add that this film is anything but boring and easily deserves its place amongst some of the best films of all time.

Susperia is not filmed in a typical western style. The soundtrack is overwhelmingly loud, the visuals are bright and overly colorful and the gore is graphic. Despite all that, the story is filled with plot holes, jammed together and mostly non-sensical.

Don't get me wrong. I get why its a classic of a sort but its not my cup of tea. If you have never seen it before and are new to the way Italian Cinema is shot, you may have a hard time not turning it off.",1199404800,3,661,4.32258064516129

Finally, I got to see the much heard of ""Susperia"" and on the big screen as well! It was not a let-down. Although the films have not really aged that well (with some of the dialogue being so unintenentertaining funny the audience were in stitches).

Despite the fact that some of his films have not aged well in some regards, they remain vastly entertaining and the horror aspect is second to none; Susperia is no exception.

Much has been said of the lighting in this film, but it really is brillian. Goblin's soundtrack adds as much to a horror movie as any horror score I've heard (with perhaps the Omen beating it).

The story is really secondary to the athestics, I've heard Dario in interviews say that he's not a fan of actors and really is not bothered by their performances and it shows sometimes in his films but I found the acting fine here but the set-pieces really make his movies worth seeing. What a great mind he has (he say's he merely rights down his nightmeres and turns them into scripts).

It is worth watching, but may be better suited as a mid-week Blockbuster selection. It is a standard Argento flick, with obvious nuances of Italian cinema. Some implied scenes, some gore. Acting is OK, audio quality at times was questionable. Plot moved along on the slow side. I would say it avoids a lot of the typical horror ""campiness"" until the end.

190504,3,1572522232,"I've read a lot of rave reviews of this classic film by Italian filmmaker Dario Argento. And I bought this 2-disc special edition at the mall recently, simply because of its reputation. After all, Entertainment Weekly rated this film #18 out of the top 25 scariest movies of all time, and said it had ""the most vicious murder scene ever filmed."" But just like a lot of the other so called horror ""classics"", I feel that this film is a bit overrated. Not to say that this is actual ""bad"" film, but what exactly separates this film from all the others? Its certainly don't think its the story. Though the main plot isn't bad, there's nothing real special about it. The story is about an American dancer who arrives at an European dance school and has odd occurrences begin to happen to her, including disappearances/murders of fellow students. Later she finds out that the school is simply a front for a coven of witches who practice a diabolical black magic. Again, not bad for a story, but nothing amazing about it either. The acting is not terrible; Jessica Parker does a decent job with the lead role as the American dancer, but there are really no stellar performances here. Now, as far as the ""most vicious murder scene ever filmed"" that happens just minutes into the film, I gotta say I was somewhat disappointed in it. It wasn't nearly as graphic as I expected, and the blood look a bit fake (it was too bright). Nevertheless, the scene was done pretty well, with some good suspense. With this opening scene, the film did fool me a bit. I thought it was going to be more of a slasher film than anything, but turns out, its not. The special effects weren't nothing great, again, my biggest complaint was the blood being way too bright in color. As well as the body count being fairly low, which I suppose really has nothing to do with this type of film since it isn't a slasher film or anything, but thats something that I do look at when rating horror/thriller films. Now as far as the strong point in the film, its got to be the atmosphere, lighting, and overall mood of the movie. This is something that Argento did exceptionally well. The soundtrack to the film is creepy and dark, the unconventional lighting, mostly bright red and blue, are really good as well as some great camera angles. But I feel that in some parts of the film where the story bogs down a bit, the mood and atmosphere try to carry the movie by itself, which really doesn't work. Yes, I think the overall feel of a movie is very important, but there has to be some substance to it as well. And I just feel that the overall story doesn't match intensity with the mood at most times. Again, like I said before, I'm not saying this is a bad movie, believe me. But I'm not sure why this film is so highly praised by some people. Perhaps after a couple of more viewings, I'll see what some of you are talking about.

The deaths are rather extreme if you can stand to watch them and the story itself is rather creepy, but it's nothing compared to many of the gorefests put out today, it's not extreme by any means.

Still an excellent story with the only downside being the flat and rather abrupt ending and the dubbing between the two women right before the first murder scene.  Goblin's music score is EXCELLENT and makes the movie feel just that much creepier.  A must watch.

EVERYTHING in an Argento film (with the excpetion of Trauma and sections of Phenomena) is dubbed! They film the scene first (without recording audio) and then dub in the diogloue later. This is especially evident in Lucio Fulci's Zombie where the English track seems to favor the Male and Female lead and the professor, while the itallian track seems to fit the supporting cast better. But as much as i would have liked Subs for this film, the Itallian track is a dub as well.

The music was so annoying that I kept turning the volume down every time it came on and we both thought the acting was horrible. Yes, there was a lot of atmosphere to the movie but that alone does not make a horror movie scary. We found ourselves laughing at so much of this movie it was ridiculous. My favorite horror movie is the ""Exorcist"" which still scares me every time I see it - and I've seen it at least 12 times. Yes, ""Suspiria""  was indeed a waste of time and money and we definitely would not watch it again.",1188604800,9,613,4.151260504201681

That the outlier just had irregular or bad taste.  But honestly, this movie is horrible and you are all crazy.

From the way everybody raves about this movie, one would imagine it to be a horror CLASSIC.  It's described as terrifying and beautiful.  So I was imagining something on a level with the Exorcist.  Old, but still amazing AND terrifying.  This was NEITHER.

I was in the mood for horror so I browsed 'Listmania' for horror DVDs. So I was extremely excited about this movie and brought it to my friend's house so we could all have a horror movie fest.

We laughed our way through the entire thing, and now I have lost movie-cred.

The acting was horrible, the soundtrack was hilarious and over-dramatic, the plot was ridiculous - from what I even remember; we stopped paying attention halfway through.  And it wasn't scary!  It just wasn't scary.  The gore was ridiculous.  And I hate when horror movies are gore-fixated.  Come on.  What do people see in this?

It was not 'strangely beautiful'

The sets were painted creatively in some parts, I suppose..

190520,5,1572522232,"I'm going to try and write this review a little different then normal, talk about why I love Dario Argento as a director a little more, along with talking about Suspiria. Rather then give a synopsis on the film, that seems to have been done about........................348 times now.

While watching Suspiria again I analyzed Dario's filmaking style, and really asked myself what it is about his movies that make him my favorite horror director.

The first thing I noticed was the ""hyper-stylized"" feel that his movies always have (all of his good movies anyway). They all seem so ahead of their time, but still keep that old-school feel, which I know, and love. You can tell Susperia was made in the 70's, but the techniques he used were so fresh and new, that they are still being discovered, and ripped off by new directors to this day. There is an extreme attention to detail in Dario's movies that I've never seen from any other director.

The second thing, and one of my favorite things about Dario's flicks, is definitely the cinematography. I've always been a firm believer that cinematoghraphy is one of, if not, THE most important part of filmaking. In theory, movies are about watching a picture on screen, the camera IS that screen, and therefore 50% of the task at hand. The other 50% is WHAT to put on that screen. Getting a little phychological, but that's what Dario's flicks do to me.
He always knows the right angles to use, not only to be beautiful, but to throw the viewer off a little bit with an experimental, and different take on cinematoghraphy as a whole.

The third thing I love about his movies are the colors, and Susperia is by far his most colorful movie, with Inferno coming in close second. While watching Suspiria the colors literally JUMPED out at me, pushed my head through a window, stabbed me SEVEN times, and hung me by my neck from five stories high, along with killing an innocent bystander by impaling her in the head, neck, and torso by falling debris. They (the colors) give it a really creepy, hallucinagetic look, and it really puts me in that ""turn down the lights, grab a six-pack, it's Halloween in this mother-"" feeling, which I love.

The fourth thing about Argento's movies that I love so much is the strange, dark, wierd, sometimes confusing, but incredibly simple plots-lines, and subject matter that only Argento would ever condider using.
Suspiria is about a dance acedemy that is run by witches, and has fuzzy arms popping out of nowhere to murder victims, a maggot infested attic, and an invisible witch who raises the dead! What the hell? Oddly enough it works so well!

I've read that a lot of peole had trouble following this one, that the plot is not always explained in every little way and I think a lot of people are reading to much into it and missing the point.
He's just trying to have a different spin on witchcraft in general and while you may not understand how some things are happening, I think that's the point, withcraft is often unexplainable and defies all rational logic.

Susperia, in my eyes is a 10-star film in every way possible, it may not be technically perfect but most of the time, neither is life.

P.S. To anybody that is a fan of Argentos: The little boy that walks around with the maid of the house has more than a coincidental resemblence to Carlo as a little boy from Deep Red, Argento's earlier giallo picture. Perhaps an homage to himself?",1187395200,2,3435,4.6381578947368425

As Suzy arrives at night in a horrible thunder and lightening storm a girl is leaving in a frenzy yelling a secret into the night, what follows is as Entertainment Weekly calls ""the most vicious murder scene ever filmed"".

Director Dario Argento ""paints"" an effective horror story, he puts relatable people in relatable situations so we can buy into his film.  Then very cleverly has dreamlike sets bursting with colors, we as viewers subconsciously know something isn't right and I believe this use of color subtly keeps us on edge.  Even the title of the film, What is Suspiria?  I googled it to find it is a film by Dario Argento, so even the title has us subconsciously unsure going in.  Although I could be wrong on that.  Then add an unrelenting, nerve wracking, and haunting score by Goblin (one of the most effective I've experienced).  We enter with Suzy into this academy and we know something isn't right, we are experiencing what she is, it is like a dream and maybe nothing is wrong, and with the blink of an eye this dream becomes a nightmare, we can stop the dvd but what is Suzy going to do?

190522,4,1572522232,"Dario Argento is the German version of Alfred Hitchcock.  *Suspiria* is one of the best horror/thriller films that I've seen, even though it was made in the 70's.

Susy is a young American dancer who has flown to Germany to attend one of the best ballet schools in the world.  Upon arrival in a dark stormy night, Susy immediately faces drama at the door.  A young woman opens the front door and shouts something back and disappears...only to be murdered later.

Almost right at the beginning, Susy doesn't feel right at the school.  She's fainting, getting nosebleeds and hearing strange noises outside her room.  She isn't the only one...another dancer hears them as well.

All of this is building up for a surprise ending.  If you really pay attention throughout the movie, you could probably guess what the surprise is.

I love the props, especially the wallpapers, and the lighting throughout the movie.  They were really eye catching.  I have a feeling that the wallpapers inspired *Lucky Number Slevin* because the same thing is seen in this movie.

Anyways, I liked *Suspiria* even though some parts can be a little corny.  Nonetheless, it's entertaining.",1187049600,,1163,4.927835051546392

190525,1,1572522232,"I must not be a fan of the old Italian thrillers. I read reviews from others about this movie, and thought it was just what I was looking for. Boy was I wrong. You can't hear the characters whispering unless you crank up the volume, then the music comes blaring in. You never see the murderous beast in the first attack, just a hairy arm with long talon-like fingernails, yet when the beast kills the female victim, it repeatedly stabs her with a knife.?? Then there's the scene where the seeing-eye dog attacks it's master. It knocks him down and supposedly tears his throat out, but when you see a close up of the dog ripping at flesh, the flesh is attached to something below the letterbox frame of the film. You never see a body with the live dog. Not to mention the stuffed dog's head that the blind guy is wrestling with on the ground. Too fake for my liking. The girls spend a lot of time staring into nothingness, and listening to haunting sounds that you cannot hear, and you are left staring at them until something else happens. Sometimes for several minutes. They have one bikini scene that's not really worth mentioning. Not sexy, not thrilling, not scary, not horrifying. Someone wrote, ""The only thing scarier than the last 17 minutes of this film, are the first 80 minutes"". Unless you are really into weak thrillers, and cheesy effects, don't waste your time on this movie.",1182902400,7,1390,4.564
190526,3,1572522232,"""Suspiria"" is a well-guarded secret among the intelligentsia of horror fans.  If you aren't part of the Algonquin Round Table of literate fright freaks or clued in to the subtle genius of its palette, then you will probably be one of those people who watch it, scratch your head, and then say, ""I thought this was supposed to be one of the greatest horror films of all time.""

It's not, let's be clear.  It exists, now, as a relic of what may once have been frightening (I have the impulse to debate that, but we'll skip it), a fossilized remnant of a time when sheer style and technique were enough to sow, grow, and harvest goosebumps by the bushel.  Fans of this film point at the subtle interplays of the editing, the almost painfully raw use of color, the ""greatest horror movie score of all time,"" provided by ""Goblin.""  Although there's a lot of room for interpretation in the term ""horrific,"" it is clear to see the eye of a maestro at work in ""Suspiria.""  The directing, cinematography, and editing are indeed eloquent.  The primal color scheme -- while over-the-top -- denotes an eye for craftsmanship, its unrealistic and powerfully savage primacy as tangible in the movie as any character or prop.  But there are problems here, too.  Lots of them.  Not the least of which being the story.

Suzy Bannion (played by Jessica Harper, a woman whose fine features and big, beautiful eyes make her look like a Japanime character) travels to Germany to start her schooling at one of the most celebrated ballet academies in Europe.  Before she's even walked in the door, strange things occur, and it is up to Suzy to figure out what is going on ... before it's too late!  The elements that are intended to multiply the movie's horror tend (at best) to confuse and (at worst) to bring the pace of the film to a withered crawl.  Statues disappear, animals become strangely aggressive, footsteps clack off to rooms unknown, and eyes hover in the dark.  Meanwhile, there's stilted dialogue to be endured, and long, trawling shots of people walking...very...slowly.

I consider myself a patient man, especially with things like movies.  And the opening murder sequence leads one to expect from the rest of the film a slow, hissing reveal (it also sets the tone for a fever dreamish reality; the building in which it takes place looks like it was designed by a post-mortem Erno Rubik, and all of the blood involved appears to be sherbert-colored poster paint).  But by the time maggots and strange bats begin to haunt the school, it was clear that not nearly as much effort had been put into the story as had gone into its well-lit props.

Still, I can appreciate serious stabs at serious art, and I was sorely tempted to give the film a four star pat on the back (a round up from the C+ I feel it deserves), if it weren't for one thing: the score.  That's right.  In every glowing recommendation I ever read, in every Top Ten Scariest Movies Of All Time list in which ""Suspiria"" is listed, I heard about this supposedly powerful and unparalleled musical soundtrack to horror.  Call me uncultured.  Call me short-sighted.  But all I heard was an obtrusive, inconsistently employed, and unnecessarily shrill series of screeches and moans.  Normally music to movies is like salt to soup.  ""Suspiria""s soundtrack is so grating and weirdly wielded that it seems like it's trying to be its own story altogether, forget highlighting or intensifying the movie to which its attached.  There are moments when it works (the opening driving sequence and the final ""battle""), but many more when it doesn't.

Fear is a sticky wicket; there's no accounting for tastes.  One thing I do know: if you are a buff of the horror movie genre (or a film student) and you haven't seen ""Suspiria,"" I recommend you watch it, if for no other reason than to see the trippy tricks that are possible when a director gives the screen his undivided attention.  But don't expect to be scared or disturbed.  And to the rest of you, I'd say steer clear.  It's true that there's a lot of visual art to this movie, but much like the art you hang on your wall, this flick goes nowhere.",1176336000,8,4145,4.6510989010989015

Dario really uses the color sceem of the film to enhance it's eerie atmosphere. With the visualls aside, another of the films great achievements is its soundtrack.

During that time, he made 6 films, several of which are masterpieces.  This is his signature film, the only that he will always be known for.  It's a worthy film to be known for.  It's one of the most terrifying films you'll ever see.  Seeing it letterboxed on DVD is the 2nd best way to see it.  I would love to see it in a theater (it was shot in 2.35:1).  It was shot on 3 strip Technicolor stock, which is why the colors are so vibrant and startling.  It was one of the last films to be shot on the old Technicolor stock (the same stock used for The Wizard of Oz).  The film's plot really doesn't make a lick of sense, but the visuals are utterly amazing.  Most of Argento's films have the same plots.  An English/American artist of some kind goes to Italy and gets involved in a murder mystery.  But his visuals overpower his stale plots.  The music by Goblin (who scored several Argento works) is one of the most amazing soundtracks in film history.  Argento made a few more masterpieces after this (Inferno and Phenomena), but this was his peak, and he's never come close to repeating or surpassing it.

One of the last (if not the last) film done in this style Technicolor, and one of the first horror movies to really utilize the soundtrack to its full potential, this masterpiece of horror (often imitated, never duplicated -- despite persistent rumors of a remake) remains a nightmare long after you've reached the credits.

Argento is stylish beyond compare, and none of his films showcase it as well as this one does.  (And this film isn't even my favorite Argento film -- that would be ""The Stendhal Syndrome"").  With it, he established himself as a horror master and visionary.  No wonder he's influenced everyone from Tarantino to various Japanese horror directors.  (The Japanese really loved this film.)

But that aside this is truly one of the most beautiful things ever put to film in my opinion.  The colors are stunning thanks to the use of the original Technicolor process and the shots are gorgeous and well composed.  Argento really had a great eye back then.

So I tried to see this as a ""masterpiece;"" lord help me I TRIED to be as sophisticated as those other reviewers who would consider me a cretin for not appreciating it!

Seriously though, I wasn't blown away.  It helps to try and think what it would have been like to see this movie back in the 70's, but I still wasn't as happy with it as I wanted to be.

I gave it 3 stars because it had its great moments.  For example I loved it when, before the girl jumped into the barbed wire room, she watched as a knife came through a crack in the door trying to jimmy the lock open.  The way it was silent except the slight clicking of the knife against the lock was pretty terrifying.  (By the way, why did she go and get in the fetal position instead of simply pushing down on the lock to keep the knife from getting it open?  Oh sorry, I failed to do the belief-suspension thingy.)

Anyways the barbed-wire-room scene was creepy, as was the final scene.  I mean I don't think anyone's horizons will be broadened by these scenes, especially nowadays, but they were quite delicious and effective when it comes down to it.

I guess much of the movie just didn't intrigue me.  The initial, supposedly infamous murder scene didn't have the impact on me that it should have, but maybe that's because I had read too much about it and it was built up too much in my mind beforehand.

So yes, I can see Suspiria's appeal, and I realize it's supposed to be quite the influential work.  But I still wasn't feeling the ""masterpiece"" vibe!  Even worse, I DO enjoy some of the typical Hollywood horror fare.  Oh what a small-minded loser I am ...",1162080000,7,1964,4.351648351648351

Employing the by then outmoded Technicolor system gives the film a strange surreal lustre, a nightmarish never land in which strong primary colours weave and clash in perfect symmetry to create a fairy tale world in which the agents of myth, legend and folklore play out their cruel and violent games. Situating his film within mythical stories of witchcraft, gives the film a distinct European flavour but in a different way to say ""Profondo Rosso"" or ""Bird with the Crystal Plumage"", these films offered a chic, cosmopolitan and somewhat decadent vision of Europe. As a result the nightmare logic of the film (aided and abetted by a frankly astonishing soundtrack) is given an added resonance and reality. Critics of the film might attack it's derivative and nonsensical narrative, lack of emotion or dubious acting, but this is too miss the point entirely. ""Suspiria"" is an art-horror film, I don't mean this in a pretentious way in relation to notions of art cinema, but art as in a picture in a gallery.

It has a very interesting use of atmosphere and deliberately alienating visual patterns which are broken by puffs of blood.

No one gets killed in this movie with a chainsaw because that would be uninteresting; to stab to death a fairly young and pretty woman in her nightgown on a checkerboard tile floor, in front of designer wallpaper and richly lavish decor, then hang her pretty corpse in the middle of the room, is different.  It says, ""This a beautiful place.""  Then it says, ""This is a beautiful girl.""  Then, it says, ""This is a beautiful murder,"" like it's perfecting a climax.

It has a lot of story build-up and suspense by the way of ambience and bloomingly vivid colors that contrast loudly on purpose.  The movie is about the night, the wind, the rainstorm, the house, and the se'ance, like Disney's ""Snow White.""

That movie might actually be a good description for mood comparison of ""Suspiria"" since they both have mystical and fantastic selves, although there are more killings here.  It is, itself, a fairy tale.  If you watch it, watch it to the end.  ""Suspiria"" is Hitchcockian through subtlety, fine texture, and well-crafted artistry.

I only found the abstract electronic rock music contrived and it annoyed me during the film.",1155772800,3,1519,4.933070866141732
190543,4,1572522232,"It probably won't terrify you as some other horror films like ""The Exorcist"" or ""Ringu"" will, but ""Suspiria"" is definitely an iconic film that all horror film fans must watch. What make it so effective are the strange atmosphere (i.e., visuals, sounds, etc.) and, of course, the now famous score. It'll easily be one of your favorite films of the genre after seeing it.",1153785600,,369,4.78125
190544,4,1572522232,"Of all the rumours that I have heard about Suspiria, i've finally got my hands on it.  With numerous critics saying its ""one of the most scariest films of all time""{from Entertainment Weekly}, and a masterpiece in horror.  Well it's not!  It's not scary what so ever and it isn't really a horror masterpiece, but its still very good.  For it's time, Suspiria was probably a very effective horror, but now it isn't as shocking and as scary as every critic has said it is.  Suspiria IS very over-rated and I can only see people with a very nervious disposition being scared of this film.

On the other hand, Suspiria is extremely artistic and unique looking.  With a repetitive use of blue,red and green lights in every scene.  The music is also very repetitive and wierd, creating  an uneasy atmosphere throughout.

I found Suspiria not scary at all.  It is a wierd and an enjoyable horror thats perfect to watch at Halloween.  It's a very good horror but its far from being a masterpiece, as it does not live up to masterpieces such as The Shining, Halloween or The Exorcist.

For its uniqueness, this is a must see horror in my opinion.",1150070400,2,1137,4.569306930693069

sound options (THX, dts/ES, etc.), re-mastered. Gorgeous color, but all through the film, I felt something was wrong. Some of the power was gone, due to the unfamiliar soundtrack. No matter what anyone says, this version does NOT have the original sound-

track. I am a musician, and I know an instrument called a ""slap-

per"", made of wood that made the (much louder, as well) charac-

teristic sounds on the original soundtrack. The ""extras"" section

has the European trailer, which has the real thing on it. Listen to that, and you know what it once was. I actually said to a

friend, "" ... wait til you see the color, and hear the sound-

But you don't get the kind of gore you would get in his gaillo films like Deep Red or Tenebre.

190548,2,1572522232,"It has some very scary moments like the opening murder scene which is extremely gory and unneccessarily stupid and the final scene. But many of the goings on between the murders are actually quite boring and Argento for no apparent reason shoves in red and green colors into the film from time to time, like that's anyway to create an eerie atmosphere. Like the scene where the girls sleep in an outside hall. Why have they got bright red lights on while they're sleeping? How does the lights from the street turn from green to red so fast while Suzy is travelling in the cab. Street light don't have that strange green color anyway. Oh wait, this is somebody's idea of art, after all it's worked on so many viewers. I'd say Argento is over the top in cheesy artsy fartsyness and the samples of the murder scenes from his other movies I've seen only confirms this in my mind. You want some real suspence and horror watch The Tenant or Rosemary's baby. Movies like Susperia are really not far ahead of Scream or the over hyped Ring.",1143590400,3,1031,4.48936170212766
190549,1,1572522232,"I just didn't get this movie at all.  I've heard a lot of good things about it for years, I've even heard it referred to as a ""horror classic"".  Well...this movie has taught me to believe none of which you hear and half of what you read.

The plot was fair, but the storyline just drags and drags.  The viewer finds himself longing for something (anything) relevant to happen, and when it does...yawn.

Okay...I've heard an endless amount of praise from a multitude of different people on the color scheme of this film, ""Oh...the colors Dario Argento uses in Suspira are amazing...oh, the colors, did you see the colors he used?""  Who the hell cares?  I certainly didn't.  The movie was colorful, so what?  I saw an oil stain in a department store parking lot that had all the colors of the rainbow in it, should I give that two thumbs up?

The score in the film was decent.  That hardly makes up for everything else though.  I tried to like this film, I really did.  I watched it twice just to give it a fighting chance.  Nothing, not even an inkling of suspense , terror, or creepiness.  Not impressed at all.

Bottom Line:

This movie is more hype than delivery.  If you are impressed with something as irrelevant as ""a color scheme""  or a storyline with a turtle-like-pace, you'll think this is a winner.  For those of you who are a little more intelligent, save your money.  If you're in the market for something really creepy, I recommend the original ""Halloween"".",1143504000,22,1470,4.534351145038168
190550,5,1572522232,"I think it's fair to begin with saying ""Suspiria"" usually counts as the best work of Dario Argento. I wouldn't agree actually, not because I don't like it but because I have other personal best. But anyway whatever other Argento's film is your favourite, you'll have to admit ""Suspiria"" is a tremendous achievement on all levels.

As Argento says himself many directors use their dreams for their story-lines and for the visual expression of their movies. And Dario admits he uses his nightmares for this purpose. I never had a chance to get into Argento's head and see what nightmares he's having, but they are definately very morbid and at the same time extremely picturesque. Although his films have obvious plots which are quite realistic, Argento manages to wind some surreal and dreamy details into them. And it makes his works truly an unforgetable experience. I won't concentrate on ""Suspiria"" plot-line, because everyone who wanted already knows what it's about. But as in most of Argento's movies here it's ""how"" that's more important, not ""what"".

The whole ballet-school in ""Suspiria"" looks so surreal though pretty realistic. The setting reminds of old German expressionist features like ""Cabinet of Doctor Caligari"", only in color. All those colorful and twisted interiors look improbable yet still realistic. If you look close enough you'll notice the door knobs are placed rather high giving an impression that school-girls, who look about 18-19 y.o. in reality, are ten years younger. This antinomy invokes strange feelings, and in a documentary dedicated to the film Argento reveals couple of other secrets about creating his atmosphere of unease and irreality. Acting and music add a lot to it, I think Goblin's mesmerizing soundtrack for ""Suspiria"" is one of the most memorable in movie history. Even if you are not a horror-film aficionado, you're going to like ""Suspiria"" because it's a real piece of art, taking any aspect of cinematography. And if you are a fan of horror and Dario Argento in particular, I'd like to say ""Suspiria"" Anchor Bay 3-disc limited edition is your best choice. It has explicit ""Suspiria 25th anniversary"" documentary, trailers, posters and still gallery, cast and crew filmographies and biographies, 32-page color booklet, and what's important - CD containing Goblin's OST for ""Suspiria"". This edition is now OOP, but I'm sure you'll find a way to get it if you really need it.",1142294400,3,2427,5.110831234256927

Dario Argento directed this seemingly modern fairy tale about a girl who attends an elegant dance school in Germany where, after several people are murdered, she realizes the staff is made up of a coven of witches who are after her next. Don't let the dubbing take away from the excellent performances that still remain in the visuals. The only problem is that there are still some plot holes at the end, but they are very minor.

190554,3,1572522232,"I picked up a copy of Suspiria at a local book store after hearing so many good things about it. I was expecting a polished, visually stunning horror film that would possibly scare the crap out of me. I was fairly dissapointed after watching this movie. The dvd quality seemed to be TV QUALITY at best which made watching this movie a painstaking task. The VERY thin plot revolves around a young american ballet student who travels to Europe to board at a private ballet academy. Little is revealed about the main character as she tumbles into a BEYOND confusing world of wicked happenings, and it is hard to form any emotional bond to her. The acting is absolutly awful and this movie supplies some of films worst conversations ever made. There is even a terrible scene where a poor blind man is mauled and killed by his own seeing eye dog!!!!! Who wrote that???? The opening death scene is supposedly one of horror's greatest scenes and that is somewhat understandable. A young girl is stabbed repeatedly (it even shows a shot of the knife slicing into her beating heart)and thrown through a stained glass ceiling window, with the shattering glass resulting in the murder of her friend. It is a visually disturbing scene that really made me squeamish. I think the movie mainly lacked a cohesive plotline and that is what took most of the glory of this film away from me. There were times during this film that I would just think, ""What the hell is happening?!"" I would have to say that the best part of the movie were the colors and the eerie and almost OVERLY loud synth styled theme music. I will give this movie three stars because of it's stylishness and atmoshpheric moments, but the plot is very poor. Jessica Harper made a great heroine too with her large doe eyed look and her lithe figure. I found it interesting that Dario Argento picked Ms. Harper because of her resemblance to SNOW WHITE, which I think is very true. Overall, if you decide to get this movie, make sure you are getting a digitally restored version and be prepared for a mind bogglingly confusing plot, but some great cinematic visuals.",1135900800,5,2115,4.627659574468085
190555,5,1572522232,"I finally got a DVD copy of Suspiria. I watched this film on VHS in the late 80's and it scared me then. It scares me even more now. Argento's technique squirms into your mind and grabs the subconscious part, filling it with horror. The choice for the films lead was great. A little frail, but a little creepy herself. Jessica Harper invested her character of Susie perfectly with a steady sense of dread and terror, reacting with just the right balance of emotion. Unlike many lead characters in horror films, Susie somehow manages to pull herself together, despite her horrid situation. I absolutely love this film. It is Argento's masterpiece.",1135555200,3,646,4.828828828828829
190556,5,1572522232,"""Suspiria"" has been acclaimed as director Dario Argento's masterpiece. And it certainly is. The plot is fairly simple. American ballet student Susy Banyon (Jessica Harper) travels to Germany to attend an exclusive ballet school. Once there, she discovers that there is more going on within than just dance instruction. Although the school's directress, Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett) welcomes her warmly, she is unsettled by her aide, Nazified teacher Miss Tanner (Alida Valli), as well as several mysterious student disappearances. When her new friend Sara (Stefania Casini) is the latest to vanish, Susy begins her own investigation of the academy. Filmed in bright, lurid Technicolor, and accompanied by a thundering soundtrack by Goblin, Suspiria is a nightmare-come-to-life. The performances of Harper, Bennett and especially Valli (like Bennett, a major star of the Golden Age) are solid, as is the unrelentingly creepy atmosphere. Also on display are two especially gruesome murders which happen near the beginning of the film. Argento later said that he modeled the look of the film directly on Walt Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and, indeed the similarities are apparent. ""Suspiria"" may not always make perfect sense plot wise, but it's a thrilling roller-coaster ride through what may very well be Hell. ""Susperia"" ranks as one of the best Italian-made horror films of all time. [phillindholm]",1134777600,3,1413,5.427272727272728

The acting is thin, the plot hardly sustainable and the cinematogrophy average at best.  There are simply very few redeeming qualities in this movie.

The most frightening aspect in this anti-climactic absurdity is the acting (and the dubbing).  Scary stuff indeed.  The soundtrack is passable, but tolerable music does not a horrifying movie make.  You can't polish a turd.

Basically there was not one thing in the movie that wasn't tacky. Its all the typical horrormovie elements that might scare an 8 year old but for an adult it made me laugh more than anything considering how ridiculous most of the scenes and storyline is(and not mentioning the bad acting).

Another problem with old movies is that by now the effects of the 70s are just so ridiculously bad that it really makes you laugh more than anything else. While it might have caused more of a scare 20 years ago, looking at it now is just ridiculous.

Not even the storyline of this movie was excused from a bad review, the whole climax of the movie is just waaaay to short. As soon as the main character finds out about the witches the movie ends after like 10 min of a pathetic showdown between the main witch and the girl.

I think real horrorfans nowadays should look at some Japanese and South Korean movies because they seem to be the ones making intelligent horrormovies. I highly recommend ""a tale of two sisters"". An intricate plot and a great psychological thriller/horror movie which will have you pondering over it for a long time.

This movie is stylish and colorful and just cool. I don't recommend watching the music video as part of ""extras"" on the DVD though.  It sort of diminishes the mysteriousness of the soundtrack.  Actually, the video is pretty awesome.  Those guys in the band look really evil, especially the keyboard player when he starts mouthing some of the strange haloween music sounds in the song.

Try and disregard the fact that they're playing in a vacant office building.  the special effects are awesome too.  especially the way the entire screen looks like it's on fire as the band initially enters the vacant office building.

I purchased the unrated edition which definitely has the feel of one, and I was not at all disappointed. The only thing that I was slightly disappointed by was there wasn't enough of that creepy woman in the end, but that's really what makes Suspiria a just-about-classic movie.

The movie is about a young American girl who is going off to a school in Germany to study dance and theater, but boy does this girl get more than she bargained for in this film. The opening 20 minutes of Suspiria are stylish, creepy, and downright classic, and it's just as great that the rest of the film remains as strong. You can feel the suspense; you can feel the terror; you can see the colors of the make-up and blood are almost too realistic, which just adds to the tense horror. Suspiria is probably most remembered for its opening sequence where one of the short-lived characters (a student) enters her bathroom to freshen up and she hears creepy noises from outside. Out of nowhere, a set of creepy eyes appear and then a hand smashes into the room from outside and the poor girl is pounded into the window and then snatched outside and we never see the killer, but we see horrible things happen in a beautiful way (much like Blood and Black Lace). The ending of the film is mysterious and strong, but ultimately, SUSPIRIA is too.

Argento would go on to help produce such films as DEMONS, DEMONS 2, and a re-version of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA that isn't quite as memorable. But with SUSPIRIA, Argento continued the great tradition of excellent work he had already mastered with PHENOMENA.",1129766400,4,1764,4.579113924050633

Keep in mind this movie was released back in 1977 so the effects weren't nearly as good and to a ""true"" fan of the genre should not be as important as imagination, creativity and suspense in which ""Suspiria"" delivers in all 3 catagories. Simply put if you are more into American horror movies then you should probably not watch this film.

The recent reviews before mine are typical of those who enjoy ""slasher films"" (typical of the early 80's I.E. ""Friday the 13th"" (1980) or mid 90's flicks like ""Scream"" or ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" I'm not taking anything away from those films as they're fantastic in their own right.

I would recommend this film to those who either 1) Love the Italian Giallo movies or 2) have an open mind when it comes to different horror styles.

190571,4,1572522232,"With lots of similarly infamous films, there is that divine rule of ""either you love it or you hate it"". This applies to such masterworks as 'Requiem for a Dream', 'Fight Club', and 'M'. But with 'Suspiria', it's more of a question of ""either you get it or you don't.""

After some shaky dubbing and a confusing murder in the first 25 minutes of the film, 'Suspiria' quickly redeems itself and becomes one of the most haunting and original horror films I have ever seen. Images from 'Suspiria' will remain in my thoughts until the day I meet my maker, especially scenes from the shocking final act.

Which brings us to the reason you either catch on to the film or you miss the point. There is no sense in trying to hold up the storyline to scrutiny, as there really isn't one. Why would a coven of witches run a school of balet just to kill off their own pupils? This is not the point of 'Suspiria', which may come as a shock to those acustomed to boorish, paint-by-numbers shockers of recent years (Saw, White Noise, The Grudge, etc.).

Director Dario Argento's main purpose is to show us startling images accomplished through over-the-top lighting, eerie music, and brutal camera angles. The movie is like a frontal assault on the senses, stabbing away at you relentlessly until the final frame of the movie, doing anything in its power to get a rise out of you. The things you see in this film are unlike any that you will see anywhere else, even in the obligatory Hollywood-ized remake that is almost certain to upchuck itself into cinemas in the next few years. There are secret passages, rooms full of barbed wire, angry bats, knife-weilding demons, living corpses, and, most notorious, a still-beating heart stabbed repeatedly.

'Suspiria' is not for everybody. Some will be completely lost and will run back crying to their mundane slasher franchises. But for those that have the stomach and the brains, 'Suspiria' is one title worth checking out.",1122854400,3,1955,4.724340175953079
190572,1,1572522232,"I am more than a little confused at the rave reviews for this movie.  Back in the 70s, this movie had a rep in my high school of being really scary (until ""Halloween"" came along).  I finally saw it on DVD the other week and found it to be one laughably horrible, horror film.  Even after you strip away the 70s kitsch, there is little that is scary or original in this movie.  The thinness and banality of the plot is only matched by the lame dialog and wooden acting.  You kind of guess its about a covern of witches when the background music hisses ""Witch!"" every now and then--so much for suprise or suspense.  The only scene that took me by surprise was the one where the blind man was killed--never thought the attack would come from that direction.  What is the point of a covern of witches opening a dance school anyway?  Is there some weird connection between ballet and witchcraft? Perhaps there is a special spell for keeping thin.  And why run a school if you are constantly having to murder students who stumble onto your occult activities? [Besides, being a witch isn't against the law, is it?] Seems like the strange deaths of students & school employees would cause even the German authorities to get curious. You might think those zany witches would pick a cover that draws just a smidgen less attention to themselves.  The most amazing thing to me is that this film has been made into a 3-Disc limited edition.

But, Dario Argento did it tastefully so its not just trashy gore, its actually very good gore with a decent plot as well. I really want to see the third installment of the series, so I hope dear old Dario makes it soon! Inferno, I believe, is the sequal to this one. Anyways, this movie alone is great, the suplemntal features are OK, even for a 3 disc set.

The people that would not like Suspiria would generally be the people that are used to american horror films and nothing more.

These are the people that will say that Suspiria is boring and dull with a bad script.  I am not the biggest fan of the script either but this is not a plot heavy movie.  It begins when Suzy Banyon (Jessica Harper) arrives in Freiburg, Germany to attend the TanzAkademie (real place but has nothing to do with the movie).

Upon her arrival she sees a girl storm out of the akademie and flee through the black forest.  This is followed by the most famous murder scene of all time, seriously.

suspiria is fantasy horror. you have to view it on a visceral level and not focus on logic. if you can let the images and music tell the story then you will love it. i would also mention that few filmakers can make gore beautiful and murder an art like Argento does in this picture.

190577,5,1572522232,"SUSPIRIA is indeed a hyper-colorful, dreamy, horror tale. The first time I saw it I was overwhelmed by it's beautiful sets, hypnotic music, and vicious assault sequences. It took several viewings for my mind to focus on the actual storyline! I love it. Suzy Banyon (Jessica Harper) arrives at a prestigious ballet school in Germany, just in time to see a former student fleeing from the place. Suzy hears a few of the girl's parting words before she disappears into the stormy night. These words return later as keys to the entire mystery that Suzy finds herself involved in. The girl ends up butchered by a figure with a big knife, that just might not be human. The victims in this movie are all people who have seen / heard too much. They are a danger to the secret within the academy. We all know it's a coven of witches, but Argento goes all out to make it as bizarre and as interesting as possible. The ""maggot invasion"" and ""room of coiled wires"" scenes are especially memorable. Joan Bennett (Dark Shadows) is cold and enigmatic as Madame Blanc. Alida Valli is supremely menacing as Miss Tanner. I got the distinct impression that she could easily have been the she-wolf of the SS in her younger days! SUSPIRIA is a movie to be seen many times. I notice something different every time I watch it. For instance, check out the killer's fingernails in the ""open-heart surgery"" murder near the beginning. Also, look at the ""wine"" Suzy dumps in the sink, it's pretty thick doncha think?? SUSPIRIA belongs in the upper level of supernatural horror films, right next to THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN, and ROSEMARY'S BABY. A masterpiece of terror and suspense...",1118880000,6,1654,4.706896551724138
190578,4,1572522232,"OK, let's establish one thing up front: when you watch a Dario Argento film, you're not looking for a complex and gripping storyline or sophisticated dialogue. But the doesn't mean that ""Suspiria"" can't worm it's way into your bedtime stories and cause some pretty lingering nightmares for months to follow.

Let the visuals do the talking. They are some of the most ethereal and weird I've ever seen. You feel like you're walking through the grimmest of the Grimm fairy tales. Even the characters reinforce that-the naive and willowesque heroines and the uptight, authoritarian schoolmistresses put one in mind of Cinderella and her wicked step-mother.

Story is painfully simple: Suzy (Jessica Harper) enrolls in a prestigous dance academy in the heart of the Black Forest (more Grimm for you) and immeadiately upon arrival is confronted by bizarre murders and general paranoia among her schoolmates. She sets out to solve the mystery of the school and vanquish the powers of evil. Or something like that.

The first kill of the movie still gets me, and I've seen this thing at least four times. It's nearly awe-inspiring. I wanted to go back and watch it again and again. Not because I'm gruesomely fascinated by the poor girl's death, but because the entire scence is brilliantly executed (no pun intended) and remarkably well-shot. It's horrifying, heart-breaking and stomach churning all at once.

Goblin's musical score blares over Suspiria like a demented narrator. I don't think it's wrong to write that without it, this movie might not have been nearly as frightning. If anything, watch Suspiria just to hear it, and then tell me if you don't get goosebumps. It's used to perfection, highlighting each horror sequence with just the right amount of lull and climax.

The ""in-between"" scences are OK, but again, you're not watching this for character development or interaction. There is one clever use of a ""riddle"" which helps Suzy uncover the secret of the academy, but otherwise the dialogue is somewhat childish. (I understand that Argento originally wanted the students to be 12 to 14 year olds, which may explain why their conversations are juvenile.)

Few horror directors are able to combain gore with style. Argento does masterfully in Suspiria, which is why I think it's one of the greatest horror classics.",1115251200,3,2326,5.075916230366492
190579,4,1572522232,"If I were to teach class on Italian giallo I would include Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"" as a required viewing. Visually this film is magnificent. I saw this movie many years ago maybe 1987 or 1988. At the time I found the movie to be dull and confusing because I really didn't understand the Italian giallo, but more interested in seeing an Evil Dead or Friday the 13th kind of flick (don't get me wrong I still love those flicks). Years later, I gave Suspiria another look after seeing ""Tenebre"" and ""Deep Red"" and learning more about Argento and his style, needless to say I was very impressed. Now I am a huge Italian horror fan. The way Argento uses extreme color lighting to give scenes an almost surreal kind of look is outstanding.

This is a giallo, an Italian slasher movie. If you have never been exposed to the Italian horror films check it out. However, go in with an open mind. If all you are seeking is a teenage slice and dice bloodbath look elswhere; stick with the American films. Otherwise, I suggest you check out ""Suspiria"" as well as other fantastic Argento works such as ""Deep Red"" ""Tenebre"" and ""Bird With the Crystal Plumage"" plus many many more.

The colors, the music, the acting, and the setting is all grade A, and this movie truly makes you wonder, ""why aren't horror movies still as scary as this?"". The theme song is so mezmerizing, its just scary, and the hughs of red, green, purple, and blue are used so artisticly that they actually add to the horror, imagine that, colors being scary?

Susy is an American dancer who travels to Germany to a well known dance school to improve her skills. When she arrives at the school, she witnesses a woman in a distressed state flee from the school while mumbling something, the only to words Susy hears is, ""secret and iris"". Susy than tries to enter the shcool only to be rejected. The following day Susy arrives back at the school, only to hear the news that the woman she saw the day before was brutally stabbed to death than hung. This than sets a string of violent and gruesom (very graphic) murders into place, leaving Susy to investigate what is happening at night when all the teachers have ""supposedly"" left the school grounds.

190583,3,1572522232,"O.K., this is probably going to annoy some of the other reviewers of the film, but here goes ... If you watch SUSPIRIA within a historical context, it was definitely ahead of its time and in some ways, a truly ground-breaking horror film.

Visually, the director Argento was pushing the envelope of horror films like few others in 1977 and the film is a feast for the eyes, with some truly original (if not more than a little bit garish) sets that look like nightmarish paintings come to life and inventive cinematography that can perhaps best be described as Hitchcock on LSD.  The music score is also at times genuinely creepy (although its main motif is repeated so often that it loses some of its novely after a while.)

There is still much to appreciate about the film and its visual impact does still pack a fearsome punch (some of the unexpected scenes are still disturbing and jolting.)  Here's the problem ... after nearly 30 years, the film has not aged well.  The acting is as overwrought as what you'd see in a Spanish novella and the music, though effective, is actually irritating in many spots, swelling ridiculously in volume everytime something ominous is about to happen (we get it, there's evil around the corner!) Its also shrill, dissonant and downright grating in spots (I wish there was a way to tone it down.)  The film is a great deal of style and very little substance, which is not necessarily a bad thing for a horror film, if it manages to carry you along the plot with its visuals, however ...

The problem is that its so over the top that it approaches cartoonish at many points and its graphic violence towards women is hard to dismiss today.  Ultimately, I recommend this film to horror fans, who should take it for what it is and consider when it was made, but for everyone else, I think you'll find all the praise that has been heaped upon it over the years to be a bit overrated.",1111795200,3,1915,4.530434782608696

190586,5,1572522232,"Long Live Dario Argento! Suspiria is able to pinion you into a level of creepiness not easily repeated by other horror movies. Nor has it been sucessfully duplicated to this day. Though ""The Exorcist"" is my all-time terror trigger, ""Suspiria"" rates a close second in seat squirming. Could it be the subtle recipe of neon reds, and violets that illuminate the blatantly gory focal points? Could it be the waxing and waning caterwauling music of Goblins that bring an otherwordly feel into this stylish horror extravaganza? I don't know.

But what I do know is that from the moment you start watching Suzy Banyon arrive at the ballet school of gore, that you are simply riveted. In the events that follow, you are put off center by a parade of deaths so grisly and beautiful David LaChappelle couldn't have framed it better-if he tried. This work of art could have only been done by Argento. Personally speaking, the ceiling scene is spectacular and is as equally gruesome as the basement scene in Argento's ""House by the Cemetery"".

Suspiria is clearly a DVD ""MUST HAVE"" in any true horror collection.",1110844800,,1100,4.814814814814815
190587,5,1572522232,"I can't believe that I'm almost done working my way through Dario Argento's filmography! It was easy to claim ignorance of many of this Italian director's films until a few years ago because it was difficult to find them anywhere in any format let alone in an uncut form. Fortunately, DVD arrived on the scene and eager film fans with dollars to spend inspired numerous companies to start churning out any movie they could get their hands on. It wasn't too long before practically every Argento film arrived on store shelves, many of them in uncut, unrated versions. Unfortunately most viewers have likely never heard of Dario Argento. These days more people know about the director's beautiful daughter Asia than the horror maestro himself. What a shame. Argento's films, at least the ones I have seen, are masterpieces of style injected with truly cringe inducing violence. Out of all of his masterpieces--""Deep Red,"" ""The Bird With the Crystal Plumage,"" and ""Tenebre"" among them--the one that stands head and shoulders above all others is ""Suspiria."" I recently sat down to watch this after a long period of anticipation. Everything you've seen and heard about it is true; this is Argento's epic masterwork.

It doesn't start out that way, though. American Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) is a gifted ballerina arriving in Europe to attend a rather elite German dance academy in Freiburg. The opening sequences of the film find young Suzy arriving at the airport, hailing a taxi, and heading out to the school in the pouring rain. ""O.K.,"" you say to yourself, ""I've seen horror films open with similar sequences before."" And you're right--you have seen movies begin in such a mundane way. Then Argento throws out one of his massively disturbing murder scenes, i.e. a young girl from the academy perishes when a knife plunges into her heart. Again, no big deal, right? Wrong. If you've seen a couple of Argento films you know full well how he displays onscreen carnage. It goes on and on in gooey close-up, and the same happens here. The stabbing is so gruesome that even this extremely jaded horror fan cringed repeatedly. I cringe now just recalling the sequence. The killing is a rather inauspicious incident marking the arrival of Suzy, especially since the young ballerina happened to witness a few clues that explain what occurred. Of course, she doesn't know that yet. Nor do we. Argento will remind us of these clues at the horrific denouement.

And what a denouement! Stylish, haunting, colorful, and deeply frightening; these are the hallmarks of ""Suspiria,"" not only in the conclusion to the film but also in the lead up as well. Everything is weird at this academy, slightly askew in an ominous and vague way. Suzy's fellow students seem oddly aloof, the instructors possess a shrill and vicious temperament that occasionally breaks through their carefully constructed facade, and the building itself oozes menace. Strange noises permeate the floors of the building, footsteps are heard shuffling about late at night, and Suzy soon begins to feel ill. What's going on? Well, it's got something to do with the sort of women we normally associate with pointy hats and broomsticks. Yep, you heard correctly: Suzy Bannion walked into a building housing a coven of witches. These are powerful women with an ancient past and a horrific record of murder and mayhem. Suzy's investigations into the bizarre events at the academy will soon find her face to face with these malefic old biddies in a series of hidden rooms that positively reek of evil. Will Bannion triumph over the witches? One thing is for sure--one must be careful with creatures that can kill with the wave of a hand.

I could literally provide a scene by scene breakdown of this film without revealing any significant spoilers because ""Suspiria"" whizzes by in an anarchic way that defies logical description. It's all about style, really, as Argento beefs up the color schemes to frenzied levels. He also imbues the film with his trademark violence, violence that sees a man's throat torn to shreds, a heart repeatedly perforated with a very sharp knife, and a cruel scene involving a room of barbed wire that one must see to believe. Most importantly, Goblin provides yet another immensely haunting score--an eclectic mix of strings, drums, and disturbing voices--that increases exponentially the sense of impending doom the viewer feels as he or she watches the proceedings. ""Suspiria"" even manages to cast veteran actor Udo Kier in the role of a psychiatrist who knows quite a bit of disturbing information about the dance academy. ""Suspiria"" is Argento's first and best entry in his venerated ""Three Mothers"" trilogy (the third installment has yet to appear), and it's far, far better than its follow-up ""Inferno,"" an even more confusing film than this one. Without a doubt, all of Argento's trademark techniques find perfect expression in this tour de force.

A big movie requires a big DVD, and you can pick up a three disc ""Suspiria"" set that gives us the film in all its colorful glory. We also get a lengthy documentary about the making of the film, production notes, trailers, an entire disc devoted to Goblin's chilly soundtrack, and plenty of other goodies to whittle away the hours. I read recently that someone plans on remaking this film, apparently in an attempt to cash in on audiences willing to see updated versions of Hooper's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""The Exorcist,"" and several other genre staples. I can't imagine anyone creating a better version of Argento's classic film; it's a movie in a league all its own and should stay that way.",1109894400,8,5633,4.970307529162248

190590,5,1572522232,"""Suspiria"" is one of those special films that still holds up after it was made because it's so ahead of its time. The rich, saturated color... The extremely unique musical score... The hard start, slow middle, and hard end... These are all testaments to the absolute genius of Dario Argento. The tag line attached to the film (""The only thing more terrifying than the last 12 minutes of this film are the first 92."") is very misleading, but that's the beauty of it. For the first 15 minutes of it, you're treated to alternating scenes of the lead character arriving at the airport and a double murder, both filmed in rich, vibrant color, then the film kicks into a slow buildup leading to a heavy climax. It's a true exercise in patience paying off in spades. Dario Argento is a true genius in every sense of the word. And this film has secured his legacy for all time.",1104364800,3,869,4.506329113924051
190591,5,1572522232,"When Suspiria came out in 1977, the American tagline that played on the radio and on TV stated, ""The only thing scarier than the last 10 minutes of 'Suspiria' is the first 92!""  Or something like that.  This is very true.  The end of this film is very anti-climatic and sort of unsatisfying, but the rest?  Pure fear, anticipation, suspense, and beautiful imagery.

The first 15 or so minutes of this movie are simply incredible.  The first time I watched ""Suspiria,"" I was alone in my apartment with the lights off.  The credits start with a menacing soundtrack by Goblin, and a narrator (who we never hear from again, perhaps only added in the English version) states that Suzy Bannion traveled to Germany to attend a prestigous dance academy.  The music crescendos to a fury, then all is silent as we open on Suzy at an airport.  As the automatic doors open and shut, the music effectively cuts in and out, and Suzy walks out into a violent rainstorm.  From this point on, Suspiria grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go.

For those of you used to newer, slick horror movies such as the ""Scream"" trilogy or the new ""Dawn of the Dead,"" ""Suspiria"" will be hard to take (rent, don't buy).  After the initial murder scene, the movie slows down a little for exposition, but is still full of creepy imagery:  Suzy walks through a hallway and sees the cook and a little boy sitting and watching her.  The cook flashes a knife reflection across Suzy's face, and we see the dust particles in the light as the soundtrack builds menacingly; the auditorium full of sleeping students is drenched in red as Suzy hears about the mysterious directoress (sleeping behind them, behind a hung sheet) from a friend.

Many people will have problems with the dubbing:  Italian movies (at that time, at least) were filmed without voice recording - the lines were dubbed post-production.  Jessica Harper, who played Suzy, has commented that she would have scenes with women who were speaking Italian and German as she spoke her lines in English.  In the scene with the professor, she commented that he spoke entirely in German, and had to tug on her skirt to give her the cue for her next line.  It's a testament to Jessica Harper that she was still able to emote with all the confusion.

""Suspiria"" is a masterpiece of brilliant colors and lighting (it was filmed using a Technicolor process, one of the last films to do so).  Once you accept the dubbing and the fact that ""Suspiria"" is somewhat dated (especially the special effects), you can enjoy it.  There is much suspense and anticipation, and the murder scenes are innovative.  Like I said, if you're hesitant about any of it, rent the movie before buying it (seriously - you should always preview before you purchase).",1104105600,3,2756,4.6604554865424435
190592,5,1572522232,"Dario Argento uses the camera lense like a prism. He focuses on familiar things and then tilts the prism, revealing hidden, unexpected facets. Despite the occasional gore, Argento films are tantalizing. Suspiria is as much a mystery as it is horror. It's fascinating to screen it for people who ""don't like horror films."" Almost invariably, they end up watching it all the way through. Within the first few minutes, they get drawn into the prism, hijacked, and then mesmerized by Argento's imagery.

Suspiria's visuals are brutally poetic. The hydraulic door mechanism at an airport becomes as disturbing as a stabbing knife; an overflowing storm drain inspires dread; austere architecture and interior design become sinister.

When Suzy explores the Ballet school, following the footsteps of her teachers, she passes through a hallway of wood-slat walls and brass light fixtures before she comes to a black door. Behind the door's semi-opaque glass, a  blood-red light begins to pulse. Unlike the benign hallway, the door is done in a sort of French metro style. It's extremely organic - reminiscent of the biomechanical style of H.R. Giger.

Note the M.C. Escher wallpaper in the bathroom of the apartment where the first victim takes refuge. It's an interlocking design of identical, black and white figures - much like the dual reality in Suspiria. Escher's intricate designs are so intricate and harmonious that one has to wonder - did Escher create them, or did he simply reveal them? Much like Argento's style with Suspiria. Did he create the mythology, or just reveal it? Or maybe both?

Suspiria is full of symbolism. When we enter the inner sanctum of the coven, symbols abound. Magical letters and phrases in latin, english, and hebrew are written on the walls that lead deeper into the sanctum, along with a long vine and leaves. Above the bed of the mother hangs an all-seeing-eye in a pyramid. On a table sits an illuminated peacock, which provides Suzy with her only weapon against the evil of the black queen.

At the end of the film, when Suzy flees the school in the storm, her demeanor changes from distraught to an elated smile. Perhaps this is a normal reaction for someone in her situation, but to me it seems a little abrupt. Just for fun, I like to think that maybe this sudden change in demeanor represents Suzy removing a mask. Maybe Suzy wasn't exactly what we thought she was... If Argento ever finishes the trilogy, here's how I'd like to see this film tied into it:

Maybe Suzy was drawn (or purposely went) to the ballet school for the specific purpose of destroying the Mother there. Perhaps Suzy is linked by birth and descendance to the whole mess. Using the film's rules - which state that a black queen is 100 times more powerful than the members of her coven (and is also the source of most of their power) - it might be reasonable to suppose that if a rival black queen were to destroy another black queen (or Mother), maybe she would inherit her power? Perhaps Suzy is herself the Mother of Tears? The question then could be - Is she good or evil? Or something in between? Will she succeed in gaining the power of all three houses? If so, what are her plans? I don't know why Argento hasn't finished this trilogy yet. It is so full of possibilities!",1104019200,5,3288,4.757894736842105
190593,5,1572522232,"Argento's best known film is probably his most expressive. This is a gem to look at with all it's lush Italian colors seeping out like a blood covered canvas. If you are looking for a horror film for intellectuals, this isn't it, but if you want something that will definitely impress you, you've found it. It concerns an old dance company in Freiburg Germany that is headed up by an old witch matriarch who leads the coven in diabolical methods. An unsuspecting student, played wonderfully by Jessica Harper, finds herself piecing together a mystery when she arrives at the school in one of the most enigmatic and beautiful commencements of a film to date. Argento has music, colors, and sounds reverberate like an opera for our eyes to dazzle. He scares us with the rain, the closing of an automatic airport door, and loose tree branches that resemble evil lurking beings. This is one powerful moment. From then on, subtle hints are explored, the supernatural, science, one's faith. Never can we guess what is truly hiding at the academy. One scene of the dance students in the hall is superbly done with loud music, hideous heckling demonic shrieks and strange appearances, this is fantastic eye candy!",1102377600,2,1205,4.854368932038835

Miss Tanner's mouth and hair, the blind man's painstaking black/white outfit, the teachers' shoes, how red seems to seep into the frame, etc.

190595,5,1572522232,"It's always interesting to me to hear people explain why they don't like Argento's movies.  I've seen most of them at this point, and although a few of them aren't that special, the majority are at the very least excellent additions to the horror canon.

The defense of Argento you're most likely to hear is that the movies don't NEED to make perfect sense.  What Argento has done is to create an atmosphere that is more dreamlike than grounded in reality.  In that sense, they definitely have a more nightmarish feel than most horror movies, which tend to be bland, formulaic, or beholden to useless exposition.

Argento appeals to raw sensuality, primal fear, and the unsettling feeling of un-reality.  And Suspiria is probably his most effective movie in this sense.  The American prints of his movies have always been re-edited, cut, and underbaked.  Anchor Bay has fixed this with their stunning series of Argento movies.  Seeing this version of Suspiria was like seeing it for the first time.  The color schemes are gorgeous, saturared, and haunting.  The print is crisp.  And perhaps most importantly, we can finally see the movie the way it was meant to be seen.

If you just can't turn off that analytic instinct when you watch his movies, maybe they just aren't for you.  But if you want to take in an incredibly atmospheric horror film that plays with basic horror elements to produce something imaginative, strange and terrifying, then this is a must see.  The movies DO make sense-- perfect sense, in fact.  It just might not become clear on the first viewing.  Like a bad dream, it can be loosely structured.  But still plenty scary.

Fans are likely to rank Argento's movies in very different order, but Deep Red and Opera would probably rank pretty high on most people's lists, and I really enjoyed Phenomena and Tenebre as well.  All of these are available from Anchor Bay.  A lot of folks tend to write off Trauma, but I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Even the new Sleepless is worth seeing, but I went with the European version-- the American release does the usual job of re-editing, cutting and re-formatting Argento's original film.  When will it end?",1099699200,30,2167,4.766129032258065
190596,3,1572522232,"I have very mixed feeling about this movie.  On the one hand, it does have two or three scenes which are breathtakingly gorgeous and superbly atmospheric.  I'm talking about the scene where the girls are sleeping in the dance studio, surrounded by sheets hung in a circle, bathed in red light from behind.  Also, the scene where the blind guy is walking around the grounds of someplace resembling the Reichstag.  Those scenes are as memorable as any I've ever witnessed.

However, that's about all the movie has going for it.  Many, many other scenes left me thinking to myself ""Oh, enough with the red lights already.""  At no time did I ever feel scared watching this ""greatest horror movie of all time"", nor was I ever interested in the plot because there was simply nothing to be interested in.  The theme music was merely annoyingly loud, and not ""great"" in any way.  Some of the dialogue was really laughable, like the line about ""Any girl who's name begins with an 'S' is a sssssnake"".  Where on earth did that come from?

Overall, I guess I would recommend this movie, but you'll enjoy the experience much more if you go into it with low expectations.  Expect a supremely artsy movie that, for every 50 attempts at creating a masterpiece, succeeds once and to a greater or lesser degree fails the other 49 times.  All this frivolous nonsense about it being ""the greatest horror movie of all time"" will most likely leave you terribly disappointed.",1099267200,6,1453,4.695652173913044
190597,4,1572522232,"Now, I will state from the beginning outright that this is one of the only films of Argento's that I have seen. With that stated, I rated this 4 out of 5 stars since out of the two films I've seen I really have no basis for comparison that would be fairly accurate.

The complaints coming from other reviewers are slightly unjust, possibly some are conventional fans of the horror genre itself and aren't all that familiar with Argento's work.

Argento has admitted that he is a director who prefers style over substance and more often than not he has a dislike of working with actors. He enjoys them as other human beings, but he believes that focus shouldn't solely stay on them throughout an entire film.

With that out of the way, let me get down to the actual review of Suspiria:

This is truly a classic film, but it is one that needs to be viewed not with high expectations but fairly low ones. The visual styles Argento implemented along with his unconventional camera shots are truly innovative and when viewing this film, you will notice that a lot of modern directors have borrowed a trick or two from him.

Suspiria is the first entry into a scrapped, then (supposedly) renewed trilogy of films, centered around The Three Mothers, figures of diabolical evil that inhabit various parts of the world.

The plot centers around an American dancer who comes to a foreboding dance academy and bears witness to a strange series of events.

Soon after the opening sequence, a sense of paranoia lurks beneath the entire film. The viewer bears witness to a murder of two of the dance academy girls while never knowing who or what exactly killed them. A heightened feeling of mystery accompanies the paranoia, as soon after, the American girl and her newfound roommate soon try to uncover the source of all the strange things that occur in what appears to be a haunted dance academy.

I do not want to spoil anything for those interested in the film, so I will stop there with the plot overview.

What makes this film an effective piece of horror and suspense is not only the paranoia and mystery embedded firmly within it, but the visuals created by it as well. Vivid colors merge with dark backlights and help to create an atmosphere which adds to the mental anguish of the viewer. When I first viewed this film, it was almost as if it were surreal in the way it looked.

One staple of any horror film, be it foreign in origin or not, is a decent soundtrack. Without one, the film will most likely fail to appease a viewer. With Suspiria, Argento teamed with his frequent collaborator, the italian progressive rock band Goblin, and the score and soundtrack for the film that was composed meshes seamlessly with the film.

During a critical scene, the music will swell and add an eerie ambience as the viewer's tension level will rise as they expect one thing to happen and will witness another. A few people have argued that the music is a distraction in certain scenes, but I personally disagree. Certain scenes within Suspiria wouldn't work well if they lacked the music Goblin had produced.

Argento's camera work here is nothing short of amazing on many levels. The placement of the camera focusing on a wide shot as it looms over the balcony above a massive in-door swimming pool almost adds an effect that leaves the viewer wondering if the pool down below is being watched by some unseen murderer or evil villain without having the distinction of footsteps going toward the balcony or any other noise that would denote so.

The actors and actresses in this film did do a mildly pleasing job with the script. Some of the lines come out forced or stiff, but overall, if a viewer isn't looking for someone to act (or overact, as the case may be) on the level of say, Humphrey Bogart or Marilyn Monroe, then they would be hard pressed to fixate upon and find themselves disappointed by the way the actors helped move the story along.

Overall, Suspiria is a brilliant film in my opinion. I cannot state that it is one of Argento's best ever, but I do know that I enjoyed it greatly. This review is merely my opinion though, with a few additional bits of information for those interested in viewing or purchasing it, and as such should not be considered the final answer on it nor should it be considered the worst either.

Suspiria is a film that not all fans of horror or suspense will truly enjoy. Those fans who are spoiled on more modern films of the same ilk may view it and unfairly pass a death sentence on it afterward, but people who wish to simply broaden their experience within the canon of many films like this may end up adding this film into their personal ""best of"" or ""Top 50"" lists.",1099267200,2,4706,4.572446555819478

190604,5,1572522232,"I suck at introductions so I'm not even gonna try. This movie is very good. I like it. If you are interested in Horror cinema or just visually intriguing films in general you need to check this out. All right then, on with the specifics.
The plot is easily summarized. Suzy Bannion is an American ballet student in Germany. There a bad goings-ons at the academy and she must investigate and defeat the evil to survive blah blah blah.  None of that really matters. Even the staunchest defenders of this film often admit that the plot/script/dialogue are not particularly inspired, and frequently kinda lame. I tend to agree with this belief, but as I said before, it doesn't really matter. However, contrary to what many people say, I didn't find this film to be the least bit confusing. I'll admit that not necessarily everything that occurs makes a whole lot of sense, and that some things are shown which are not terribly vital to the plot, but it's hardly difficult to follow. The acting isn't so great either, with the protagonists coming off a bit flat much of the time, and the antagonists overdoing it, particularly the whacky Miss Tanner, whose got a weird female concentration camp commandant thing going on.(or maybe I'm thinking of Madame Blanc, I get the names confused. If you see it you'll know who I'm talking about.) Still, it's a masterpiece visually.
When people talk about this movie they almost invariably describe it as being nightmareish. I don't really care for this description, because it exaggerates the surreality of the film. Visually, it isn't hyper-abnormal, it's really just surreal enough to seem just beyond the bounds of reality, so that nothing in the film seems quite real. This is particularly effective in the Academy itself, which mixes stately, classical looking architecture with extremely garish and tacky, extremely 70s-ish decoration. The night/horror scenes are all the more effective, with natural coloring being essentially abandoned, with everything then being bathed in eerie colored lighting.  The two most prominent colors are blue and red, with a smattering of green now and then. On the whole it is startlingly eerie, and can add immense power and atmosphere to scenes where essentially nothing happens. A good example of this comes when they are forced to sleep out in the ballroom due maggot infestation.(which is itself an example of a creepy thing that happens that has nothing to do with anything)  Nothing really happens here, but it's bathed in an intense, absolutely hellish red light which gives it immense power. To accompany these visuals is the much-hyped score by Goblin.  It is extremely effective, though occasionally weakened by the odd cheesy synth line. It's mostly eerie keyboard lines playing menacing, repetitious melodies, thunderous percussion and random, rumbling bass overlaid with demonic voices whispering and howling.  It also gets points for sounding like actual music, rather than the auditory exclamation points that most horror films provide you with.  Despite all this, this movie isn't all that scary, but it's pretty eerie and atmospheric, and is just damn cool.
The film suffers slightly from starting off too well, so it's unable to maintain it's level of excellence, and suffers from a rather anti-climatic ending. Still, the opening scenes of the film are absolutely great.  Suzy's arrival in Germany during a fierce storm sets the tone for the film, and establishes most of the visual motifs.  It is perhaps the most surreal portion of the movie, with the heavy rain obscuring most everything, and particularly random seeming uses of lighting.(The weird forest they pass through is especially cool)  The first murder scene, which is early in the film, is easily the best of the horror set-pieces.  Although it isn't really all that gory it's a truly brutal scene and ends with some genuinely horrific imagery.(I'll admit that the effects are dated, but they still work very well in this scene, imo)  The other horror scenes are reminiscent of the first, indoors, with the use of phony looking set decoration and colored lighting, with one exception.  It takes place out in the open, and the normal colors are abandoned, instead opting for utter blackness and plain white and grey coloring on the surrounding, neo-classical architecture.  It's also got some great, Leone-esque staging and camera work, as it drags the scene out as long as dramatically possible, alternating between extreme long-shots and extreme close-ups. It's a great scene (other than some dated gore) which is made all the more effective by how it contrasts with the rest of the film.(I should mention that despite the supernatural trappings of the film, the killings are generally done manually, with slasher-esque staging and methods. This film has witches, but they ain't much like what you usually see.)  As I said before, the ending isn't so great. It's a bit abrupt, and doesn't show us anything we haven't seen before, but just re-iterates old motifs in an inferior manner, and suffers from some bad acting on the part of the main antagonist.(Well, now that I think about it, it does have one great scare, which is unexpected and unlike what we've seen before, but overall it's just not nearly as good) Also, there's a scene with a bat which is unintentionally funny. That bat's just so damn adorable.

No doubt Argento fans would say that such scenes are what make Argento Argento.  Whatever.  That said, this is a really good movie with a terrific look.  Argento's use of colors and architecture to establish mood (dread) is simply astounding.  I have to believe Kubrick borrowed from Argento, heavily, in his making of  ""The Shining.""  I almost didn't finish watching ""Suspiria"" due to a graphic murder in the beginning.  What kept me hanging in there was the stylish way Argento was framing his scenes.  Hairy and taloned arms appearing out of the dark, a haunting run through the woods, wild and/or garish art deco interiors that have you thinking Jack the Ripper picked out the colors and patterns, and a building that looks like it was designed in Hell.
The plot?  It's ok.  Not as weak as some have suggested, but it does have holes - holes you don't spend much time pondering, since it's your eyes and ears Argento is after.  Acting?  Almost seems beside the point.  You have your various grotesque characters, some with very big teeth, doing evil things. Jessica Harper is, however, very good as the waif-like ballet student.  Her physical slightness, her big eyes, all contribute to the impression that she is surrounded by monstrous horror.  How will she escape? Watch and see.  The soundtrack, especially if you have surround sound, is effective and eerie. Lots of evil whisperings and other ominous sounds jump from unexpected directions.

190606,3,1572522232,"Argento has a talent for inserting subtle clues in his movies (maybe the best example being the initial scene in Deep Red).
In Suspiria he inserts at least two intriguing clues, by willingly subverting science, as a way to alert us to the presence of unearthly evil. Just a few seconds before the scene in which maggots fall from the ceiling, we see some water draining from a sink, and rotating clockwise. This contradicts the myth (if not the reality) of the fact that in the upper emisphere the Coriolis force would impose a counterclockwise rotation (...). It seems to me that the deliberate choice of rotation in the sink is not casual, but rather a clue that Argento is giving us that 'not all is well' in the school. A second clue comes towards the end of the movie, when we see water spurting from in a gutter, in an apparent violation of basic principles of pressure. Once again, this violation of physics occurs just a few seconds before the horror begins.
I am not a fan of this particular movie (though it is quite rich in atmosphere, and the use of color -from the very beginning- is intriguing), but I did found these subtle uses of science to be interesting.",1083888000,,1173,4.537735849056604

This film is difficult to describe.  I can say: go and see it.  Heck, go and buy it.  It's really one of a kind.  (Okay, maybe other Argento films approach it.)
The key word is atmosphere, which is a key element in a good horror film.  Since the film is about witches, and the supernatural, etc, you know it's fantasy, so it needs another factor: atmosphere.
The film is literally bleeding with color.  It's a real, expressionistic horror film.  The lighting is the first thing to hit you, and it stays.  I've never seen a film use lighting like this since.  The composition of the shots, the insane music of Goblin, and the overall weirdness catapult this flick into legendary status.
A young American ballet dancer visits a prestigious German dance academy.  She soon realizes something very strange is going on, and sure enough, it's some kind of witch haven.  Several students and a staff member die bizarre (but stylish) deaths.  The opening is truly macabre and sets the tone.
Argento hasn't matched this film yet.  It's part one of a supposed trilogy, the sequel being the inferior but still creepy Inferno.  After some of his recent work though, it doesn't seem like investors are flocking to Argento's door.

Specifically, the reviews posted here at Amazon. But, holy cow, what an incredibly, dramatically, amazingly OVER-RATED film this is! OK, I'll give you the cool Goblins' soundtrack. I'll grant you Argento's deft use of light and color. But that's it... nothing else.
Suspiria is not a terrible film per se, but one of the scariest, most ""beautiful,"" most memorable horror films ever?! No way. Not even close. As has been noted elsewhere, Argento's ""plot"" is hardly there at all, and the acting and voice-over work is merely passable. But those are not really the reasons to watch an Argento film. You are suposed to enjoy or appreciate his ability to shock and scare you. I am easily (and happily) scared by horror flicks: really good ones (The Exorcist and Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer); pretty damn good ones (28 Days Later and Blair Witch Project); even marginally OK ones (Hellraiser II comes to mind -- not great, but interesting). Suspiria ain't even in the same ballpark. Not the same league. Not the same sport. Not for one instant was I in suspense regarding who the bad guys were. Not at any point did I approach being scared. And, MAN-O-MAN, do you think you could get to anything even BEGINNING TO LOOK SCARY QUICKER THAN THE NEARLY 90 (yes, 90) MINUTES IT TOOK TO GET TO THE FRIGGIN' ""SCARY"" PART?!?!
The fact that Suspiria takes sooooooo long to get to the confrontation between the protagonist and the bad guys was in and of itself enough for me to recommend against this film (nearly 90 minutes, folks). So why 1 star? Because not all the acting is abyssmal, because the cinematography and camera work is interesting, and the soundtrack is genuinely cool.
But the scares are non-existant (I am honestly amazed that ANY of the reviewers here stated that they were even the tiniest bit frightened), the first (and, essentially, only) act is far too long, and there is a pitiful ""resolution"" to the film (bad guys all die, heroine walks away... the end).
I am not of the opinion (as has been stupidly and naively stated elsewhere, Lee) that Halloween Part 4567, or Freddy, or Jason, or Scream are ""great horror films"" -- I think they genuinely suck -- and I resent the idiotic implication regarding my intelligence. The fact remains that this film is over-rated. Period. It is not great nor is it a classic, though it does have some winning aspects, which I have noted. But films like Blair Witch, Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the original), and the first Halloween ARE terrific pieces of entertainment, and are far better representatives of the horror genre than this silly, silly film.
The thinking-man's horror flick this ain't. It is simply ridiculous to count this film among the greats of the horror genre, European or otherwise... this film simply does not work in nearly any way for me.

190613,5,1572522232,"The only thing scarier than the first ninety minutes of this movie are the last ten! Suspiria is a film that I have been holding back on for some time now. The first reason is that I believed it could not live up to the hype. The second is that I have been recently disappointed by some of Dario Argento's latest works. I picked up the guts to go and watch it and this movie was sheer hell for me from start to finish. I was behind the sofa for most of it, howling. I am a grown man and I screamed and screamed! Grown men are not supposed to do that now are they?
Suspiria looks stunning and is only second best in terms of look to Lucio Fulci's The Beyond which has much better camerawork - however the set design, color and use of lighting in Suspiria are world class achievements in cinematography and motion picture strategy. The premise is a simple one. Jessica Harper plays Suzy Bannion, an American ballerina who heads to Germany to attend dance school. When she gets there she witnesses another girl running away from the school and overhears her saying something in the process. These words are important and she remembers them later in the last moments of the film. The running girl ends up staying in her friend's house and both are murdered in what has to be the most visually brutal slaughter yet committed to celluloid. That sequence alone is worth the ticket here. Back in the school more murders take place and Bannion tries to figure out what is the mystery behind the school and the deaths that are occurring there. At its bible sized hole in the heart, Suspiria is a murder mystery and you are left guessing as to what is what and who is who. There are several very scary sequences in this film and Argento manages to pull off a stunt with a blind man and his guide dog that right comes out of the blue. This film was non-stop horror entertainment from start to finish with a whooping ending to boot. My God what a finish! That was a sheer nerve-wrecking experience.
The whole film is one big payoff. The music is dead-on, one hundred percent accurate for this type of movie (and you can be damn sure that there is only ONE movie of this type!). It plays itself out like some kind of kid's fairytale-come-nightmare. Suspiria almost seems like a Tim Burton movie that is instead in the hands of raving sadistic maniac who knows how to make you jump and soil your pants twenty times over. If you watch this film with other people you will hear plenty word's around you to the gist of - ""My God, I've just had ANOTHER accident.""
Suspiria is NOT a gore / splatter fest like most of the other works from Argento. Yes, Suspiria does have gore and plenty of blood, but this movie is damn near the scariest films I have ever witnessed and I have seen literally hundreds in this genre.
This is a perfect horror film to ""susperience!""",1073174400,5,2843,4.396584440227704
190614,3,1572522232,"Like many others here, I bought Suspiria solely on the hype it has received as 'one of the greatest horror films of all time'.  I am a huge fan of the genre and do enjoy other films by Argento, but after watching Suspiria I had no sense of it being even remotely close to one of the greatest horror films of all time.
The film is beautifully shot, as has been stated by others, the use of color is stunning and consistent throughout.  The score is great as well.  But the plot is fairly thin and the acting is average at best.  Some of the effects were somewhat cheesy also, like the scene with dog attacking the piano player.  Clearly it could be seen that this was a mannequin, and a poorly constructed one at that.  The blood used looked like fingernail polish and nothing like actual blood.
With that said, Suspiria is definitely worth a look.  I purchased it and am happy to have it as a part of my collection.  But when you stand this movie next to classics like 'The Exorcist', 'Halloween', 'Black Christmas', or 'Carrie' it simply doesn't measure up.",1070928000,4,1058,4.417525773195877

I have read many rave reviews for this movie from critics and movie makers, such as John Carpenter for example. After watching the movie all I can say is, what are they talking about!!!!!!!?
There is now way you can tell em this is a classic, it is not even a good movie.
Tha acting is laughable!, the story is absurd, nothing feels real. the movie is completely unscary.  It is not possible to have a movie be scary when the acting is laughable and there is no real character development.
This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen, the only reason so many people on here gave this movie a good review is because they think they are supposed to like it because critics and filmakers call it a classic.
The only way you can think this is a good movie is if you are a complete and utter moron!

The movie does look and sound excellent, hats off to Anchor Bay for making another older movie look like it was released in theaters months ago.
The movie began with the effective and famous death scene, and from there it went downhill. Silly dialogue and scenes building towards suspense are cut, seemingly in the middle. People say Argento doesn't focus too much on plot, and here it shows. Had this movie been more streamlined, with the imagery and the camerawork, this could have been what people had been calling it - a true masterpiece.

Now, the real nail in the coffin of this movie is the absolutely sophomoric plot that you are driven to stick with, given such a great looking movie.  the story is slow, insipid and completley predictable, with one of the worst hurry-up endings since the original Hellraiser. So much time of this film is devoted to making you ""feel"" like you're watching a great horror movie, that the climax & deneumont seem as if the creators siad ""oh crap, we have to wrap this up in about 5 minutes""..

190618,5,1572522232,"** Contains Some Spoilers **

A beautiful American Ballet student goes to Germany to attend a prestigious dance academy. Upon her arrival, one of the students is brutally murdered (in what I crown as one of the loveliest murder sequences ever filmed), maggots drip from the academy's ceilings, and man's best friend, a seeing eye dog and companion to the resident (blind) pianist, falls under diabolical influence. The beautifully maintained dance academy is actually more than it appears to be. Hiding within its walls is an evil waiting to destroy anyone who dares to investigate its secrets.

I always wondered what all the fuss over this particular film was about. Even as a teenager, I knew of its reputation and I desperately wanted to see it but it was hardly ever on network television and when it was, it usually aired during the frightful hours after midnight. Now, after many years, I finally got the chance to purchase it on DVD. The praise is well deserved and I agree with many who have described this movie as the closest we have to an actual nightmare on film. There is something mystical about this film. Something I can't really pin point. Is it the artfully decorated set designs (freeze frame several shots in this film and what you have before you looks almost like a surreal, abstract oil painting- more on this later)? Is it the cast of lovely leading ladies? Is it the mysterious and enigmatic storyline? The chilling score that permeates throughout the film and crescendos with a wickedly sinister voice shouting ""WITCH"" as the tension builds? I guess it's all of these and more.

As already mentioned, almost every single frame in the film looks like a painting, a rich oil painting with vibrant and vivid colours. Even if you were to pause any frame in the film, most likely, you will be greeted with a sumptuous visual - the angle, the hypnotizing colours, the abstract sets, the actors, all mesh together and create a nightmarish scene lifted from one of your nightmares. From the dated and psychedelic wall paper to the twisted staircase to the main characters posing gracefully in front of the camera. Never has a horror movie looked more beautiful. Even some of the carefully executed murder sequences (despite its grotesqueness) are lovely to look at. The opening scene is probably the best example of this. When the victim is screaming for her life and as she is unmercifully stabbed repeatedly, the colours that permeate the scene, the red, yellow and blue hues, give it an illusion of surrealism, as if the murder is happening in another reality. Even the close up of a beating heart that is punctured and wounded, the colours stand out and with the haunting score, beating in the background, combine to create an epic scene of torture, gore and rare in a horror film, beauty. Another fantastic scene, involves Harper walking cautiously towards one of the ballet practice rooms and as she walks, alone, a sinister character and an equally sinister child, stare at her, as if plaguing her with a curse, and at just the right time, you hear that sinister voice (""WITCH"") as light reflects off some sharp object the sinister granny is polishing off and the end result is an effectively brilliant scene that is enhanced by the great and chilling score. There are long gaps between murder sequences, and many may lose interest, especially considering the plot is rather thin and Argento leaves it up to his sumptuous visuals, and our imagination to fill in the gaps. Also the characters, as charming as they may be, are a little too nave and act younger than their years. At times, they are way too immature. It has been stated that the original script used young, pre-teen girls as the characters and this was later changed (I guess due to the grisly nature of the film) to young women but the dialogue was not modified which helps to explain the child-like behavior of some of the characters. Another aspect of the film that many may find grating is the dubbing and accents. Minor issues with an overall compelling piece of cinema.

This is Argento at his best. He previous film, which many consider another Argento masterpiece was the over-long but effective ""Deep Red"", and he followed ""Suspiria"" with what was supposed to be its sequel ""Inferno"". Although it is inferior, the trademark style is abundant and despite what many consider a confusing story line, is a good supernatural horror film. Argento would continue to make solid, surrealistic pieces throughout the 80's and peak with 1987's ""Opera"". Unfortunately, he would never again achieve this level of greatness but at least he has this masterpiece to call his own.

Argento take a bow. This is an absolutely bone-chilling, haunting and unforgettable excursion into the world of witchcraft and the beyond. A classic film that rightfully deserves its place as one of horror's true classics and a masterpiece of the genre. They don't make horror movies like this anymore which is an absolute shame.

The soundtrack is probably the biggest plus, and the opening killings are a real doozy (though the heart should be gushing blood when it's stabbed).

No wonder why this is the most popular horror movie from Italy; this movie is not just a horror movie, it's an entirely new experience! SUSPIRIA is about an American ballet student attending the Tanz Academy in Germany and the weirdness she encounters. I won't go into the plot too deeply, or anything else about it, because it really doesn't matter and it doesn't make much sense anyway. But I will say that the effect of SUSPIRIA is akin to a nightmare; it's as if Dario Argento went into somebody's mind as a nightmare was happening and captured it all on film! The sets, the lighting, the photography, the special effects, and that music score all make the expeirence unforgettable!
The Limited Edition is the best way to own SUSPIRIA. Along with the beautifully remastered movie (THX-certified no less), the Limited Edition includes a 25th Anniversary documentary with interviews and anecdotes from Argento; co-writer Daria Nicolodi; stars Jessica Harper, Stefania Casini, Udo Kier; the band Goblin, who made that awesome score among others such as Argento's DEEP RED; and others. It also includes the CD soundtrack, the ultimate bonus; now you get to listen to Goblin's awesome compositions on your stereo or CD Walkman and get chills!

It's almost Hitcockian at times.  It starts slowly but draws you in by the effective finale.  What surprised me the most was a fairly coherent plot(Argento has a reputation for gore and style).

190628,4,1572522232,"""Suspiria,"" directed by Dario Argento, tells the story of a young American woman who goes to study at a ballet school in Europe.  But a gruesome murder early in the film indicates that horror lurks behind the school's elegant facade.  More horrors unfold before the true nature of the school is revealed.
I must admit that while a lot of hype seems to surround this film, I didn't find it to be as shocking or horrifying as I expected--perhaps the passage of time and my experience of more shocking films made after it has blunted its impact as a work of pure horror.  For me the enduring power, pleasure, and importance of ""Suspiria"" lie in its blend of visual and musical style.  Virtually every frame of the film--including the goriest and most violent scenes--is a lovingly crafted work of art.  Set design, costumes, etc. all come together to enhance Argento's brilliant use of color, shadow, shapes, and visual motifs.  At his best Argento creates an enchanting poetry of sadistic violence.  This visual genius is marvelously enhanced by Goblin's creepy, bold musical score--it's music that at times relentlessly assaults the listener.
""Suspiria"" has been given a lavish treatment in this 3-disc DVD edition, complete with a wonderful booklet about the film.  Disc 2 contains a well-made documentary that commemorates the film's 25th anniversary.  It features interviews with the film's stars (Jessica Harper, Stefania Casini, and the marvelous Udo Kier), director Argento, the musicians who created the unforgettable score, and other key behind-the-scenes creative talents.

190629,4,1572522232,"In 1977 SUSPIRIA was considered an extremely violent film; in the wake of the slasher genre, however, the violence involved seems less horrific than you might expect. What continues to work, however, is the look with which director Argento endows the film, particularly in regard to the set designs, camera set-ups, and use of color. Visually speaking, this is an amazingly beautiful film, with Art Nouveau designs, deceptively simple cinematography, and washes of intensely artificial color that dazzle with intensity. Even in the midst of its horrors it is almost impossible to take your eyes from the film, such is its strange beauty.
The cast is equally strange. Leads Jessica Harper and Stefania Casini are very typical of 1970s ingenues, but they each have a quality that sets them slightly apart from the young actresses of the time. Barbara Magnolfi makes an impression as Olga, one of the school's students, as does Susanna Javicoli as a harsh instructor. Even Udo Kier, cult star of Andy Warhol's FRANKENSTEIN and DRACULA puts in an appearance. But oddest of all is Hollywood's Joan Bennett, who gives a truly flawless turn as the seemingly lady-like and ultra-respectable Madame Blanc.
Less successful is the story itself, which is so slight as to be almost incidental. Young dancer Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) has enrolled in a famous Italian ballet school--and upon her arrival finds another student fleeing the school in hysterics, a student who is not long after murdered in a horrifically brutal way. Odd incidents follow, and when Suzy's classmate and friend Sara (Stefania Casini) goes missing, Suzy begins to piece together the truth.
Another flaw, at least to my mind, is the soundtrack. While it has been widely admired, I can think of few film soundtracks that are quite as heavy-handed in their dynamics as SUSPIRIA. That aside, and while the film has considerable creepiness, it isn't frightening per se. In the final analysis, this is a film which I think is best seen by cult connoisseurs--and even they are more likely to admire than to flatly like it. Recommended, but rent it first.

However, anyone who is familiar with this film knows half of ""Suspiria"" is the incredible soundtrack by Goblin. On the old Magnum VHS/Image LD, the music was so powerful. It really plunged you into the creeped-out atmosphere of the movie. But some fool at Anchor Bay decided to mix down the music!  The opening taxicab ride through the storm originally had the main theme playing much louder, but on the DVD this music practically disappears into the background. Sound levels are inconsistant throughout- a ballet lesson by the Nazi-esque Miss Tanner is very loud, but the famous double murder at the beginning of the film is subdued to the point of losing much of it's impact! In effect, this movie has been practically castrated!

The basic plot and appalling acting let the film down.  As for the horror scenes - well, let's remember that it was made in 1977 and the horror scenes would have frightened audiences then - the R rating was fitting for the time.  Times have changed, and audiences expect more of horror films.
DVD SUMMARY:
If you are like me, and heard so much about Suspiria, you will want to see it to satisfy your own curiosity.  Aside from the bad points regarding the acting and plot, I am pleased to tell you that Anchor Bay have delivered a STUNNING print of this movie on DVD.  It's so pristine that it's hard to believe it was filmed in 1977.  Everything about the print deserves 10 out of 10.  It should be reference for how to restore an old film.  I have the Single Disc edition DVD, which is probably the best version to buy if you haven't seen the film.  You still get the same version shown on the 3-disc, and some extras (but not the documentary), and also the DTS soundtrack.
Suspiria is a difficult DVD movie to find to rent, so if you are interested in seeing it, just buy the single edition DVD (it's cheaper).  Despite the fact that I don't really love the movie, I am still glad to own it because of the camera work and colours - as well as the excellent DVD transfer.  Nothing can quite prepare you for the incredible restoration work that Anchor Bay have done.  Bravo Anchor Bay.",1052092800,2,1518,4.397849462365591
190634,3,1572522232,"Suspira has alot of happy memories for me from when i was a teenager and first discovering the enjoyment of a horror cinema. I first discovered Dario Argento when i got my mother to hire me the heavily cut VHS version that was only avalible in Australia, (the uncut version has only been avalible here for a short time). When i watch the film for the first time i was caught up with the visual contexts of the film and thought the story of a covern of witches at a school was wicked !!!
From there i went on to see all his other films of Dario and thought over time his direction seems to have got weaker. However, you know that your in for an interesting viewing if its directed by Dario.
Anyways, to my delight Suspira was released on DVD uncut and full of extras this year and i purchased it straight away. After 10 years i watched this film again and the following is based on this viewing not just happy horror memories from yester year.
I still believe that for Italian cinema in the 70's this was one of the best films. It is accessible to international audience due to its mixture of italian and english dialogue and actors. However, i did notice that the english over dubbing was over dramatic and made some tense scenes simply laughable.
Furthermore in the scene with the girl and the wire, (its not barbed people, i mean it just looks like what it , large amounts of un-barbed wire in circle formations), how she didn't see the wire before jumping in is beyound me. It nearly a fully lite room and the wire is only about a metre down from her postion. Its like seeing a shark fin in a tank and jumping in. This was my first real "" oh for the love of god"" moment of this film and made me question the creditabilty of the film somewhat.
Furthermore in the first murder how do we go from the girls room to the rooftop. There is no transion scene from point a to b to c. We just go from the room to the what i guess is just below the roof top as she falls through the centre of the window on the ceiling of the main foyer. It just didn't make sense and hurt any antipation or horror at the scene.
I mean when i watch a horror movie i have to be caught up in the atmosphere and the story so that my mind and body begin to tense up but when u are in this state and suddnely you get a muddled scene like this is just changes the mood instantely.
Apart from this though the film still held up to my adult eyes and i still really enjoyed the visual style to the movie. The best thing though to come from this movie though is the music. I believed when i was teenager and i still believe today that the chantting of ' witch witch witch' is damn spooky and the way in which the electronic tone increases as the movie goes on is effective, (however get a load of the guys that composed the track on one of the extras, what a joke !!!! the word SAD comes to mind).
Overall, the film is a piece of quality italian horror and if u classify yourself as a horror expect you will have already added this too your collect. If your new to it all u may just find it all a bit hokey as the next generation of horror shows how dated this film is. Horror, like everything changes, and what was impactful in the late 70's and early 80's just doesnt cut it with some of the more recent horror films avalible and the new generation who watch them but for a piece of classic horror history, intriguing storyline, (its not as bad as some reviewers have stated), the interesting and spooky sound track and the visual style of Dario, its a worthy purchase.
However, i recommend that if your not familar with it to rent first.",1051833600,,3605,4.173601147776184
190635,1,1572522232,"With all due respect, if you think this is ""one of the scariest movies ever made,"" you have not seen nearly enough scary movies.  Suspiria is indeed frightening...frighteningly bad.  Don't try to find any semblance of a cohesive plot...there is none.  Rather, we get a series of badly acted scenes intended to spook us but which merely made me laugh out loud at the ineptitude on screen.  Funniest of all, perhaps, was the obviously fake bat and fake dog, which were no doubt purchased at the toy store down the street.
A couple of violent scenes do interrupt what seems like hours of plodding, boring exposition.  But these death scenes are so amateurish, so badly executed, that you'll laugh yourself silly watching them.  Of course, if you like watching endless scenes of people dancing, this is the movie for you.

I contemplated just throwing the tape out, but that would've been a grand waste. I will never watch the movie, and don't suggest anyone buying it unless on an impulse buy ...

190638,5,1572522232,"Since I seem to be on an Italian horror kick, it's essential that I touch down on Dario Argento, and what better example than Suspiria.  In the much shunned subgenre of Italian horror, Dario Argento is one director who actually won the critics over a time or two.  You look on any top ten scary movie lists, you can bet Suspiria is on it.  This film isn't really frightening-in fact most people think it's stupid and/or corny- but it's certainly original.  The plot isn't much to brag about, this film is all about style.  I've always thought you could make a movie about anything and make it interesting if you presented it correctly.  Usually it's only the film snobs that pick up on the wild visual style Argento uses, but you certainly don't have to be a film snob to see it.  Alot of the people I suggest this to usually think it's boring and silly.  Granted these people aren't familiar with the genre and get scared to death by films like The House On Haunted Hill remake.  Sure, Suspiria has it's parts that  drag a bit, and the dubbing makes it sound corny(as usual), but all I can tell you is to view it with an open mind.  Go into it understanding that the Italians make horror films different from  American directors. And don't mistake different for dumb.  Argento's movies are pretty whacked out(in fact, he's pretty whacked out, check out his documentaries), and not all of them are masterpieces, but he's really got vision.  He's not a schlockmeister like his fellow countryman in Italian horror, Lucio Fulci(schlockmeister perhaps, but I love him to death), he's the kind of director that's likely to be studied in a film class.  He doesn't go for the all out gore attack like Fulci, but Argento's violence is certainly not for the squeamish.  The first murder scene in Suspiria is probably one of the most intense ever put on film.  I'll guarantee you everyone in the room will stop what they're doing to see it!  It may not have the Fulci gore, but it's got ten times more intensity.  I've rarely seen music used to such a great effect.  So, I'd definitely check this one out if you'd like to see Italian horror with an artsy edge.  In fact, you should see Suspiria just to say you've seen it.",1049068800,2,2212,4.5353535353535355

The atmosphere Argento creates in the film fills you with such a sense of heavy dread, it's no wonder that he claims that this film and ""Inferno"" (an inferior but stylish follow-up) were exhausting to make. Most likely, he probably creeped himself out. ""Suspiria"" will make your skin crawl, even when nothing seems to be happening. Argento even makes falling rain seem disturbing. The film moves like a dream, and the Goblin soundtrack is haunting. This is the best, creepiest music I have ever heard in a horror film. The storyline is basic, as in most Argento films, and what moves the viewer is not the story (centering around a dancing-academy run by a coven of witches) but the style and dreamy-quality of Argento's directing. The gore is strong in this movie, so sensitive viewers beware. For any fan of good horror, this film is a must. If you've never seen Argento, now is a good time to start.

190641,3,1572522232,"I've been hearing about Suspiria for years; I had seen it once, ages ago, on Cable, and didn't really think much of it. I dedided to buy this 3-disc set on the strength of the reviews here on Amazon, and the past quality of Anchor Bay's DVD line.
  The package itself is gorgeous; The set includes a great booklet with a ton of information about the film, and a packet of 8 lobby card reproductions. Disc one is a restored, uncut version of Suspiria, and it looks absolutely stunning. The colors are crisp and vibrant, and the sound is spectacular. The story, however, is lacking. In fact, it's virtually non-existent.
The plot is reminiscent of a fairy-tale: An American student arrives at a German Ballet school, and strange murders ensue. That's pretty much it. The murders are gruesome, and the ending is intriguing, if somewhat abrupt. My overall feeling about the film was that the over-stylization was there to cover the total lack of coherent plot. There's a lot to look at, but in the end, what's the point? Disc one also includes Radio & TV spots, American & International trailers, Poster, Print Ad, and stills gallery, and a video of the Suspiria theme by Daemonia, which is REALLY gay. (I don't mean homosexual; I mean gay, like seeing guys in their 40's and 50's dressed up like goths...freaky stuff.) There's also a hidden outtake of the Udo Kier interview, which is pretty funny.
  Disc 2 is the mostly sub-titled 25th Anniversary documentary, which has interviews with Director Dario Argento, Star Jessica Harper, and others. Some interesting stuff, but not nearly enough for 52 minutes. I didn't find any Easter Eggs on this Disc.
  Disc 3 is the Suspiria score on CD; Their music is very unusual, and fits the movie well. It's a nice extra; The main theme has been stuck in my head for days. Unfortunately, there isn't a track listing, so I have no idea what the song titles are.
  I don't feel cheated by Suspiria; The package and extras are so attractive that you more than get your money's worth. I just would have liked some steak to go with the sizzle....",1044316800,2,2079,4.66120218579235

Anyway, I started looking into this Dario Argento character and aparently he is a God in Italian cinema. Even though he is not too famous in the states the people who do watch his films love him. Kind of like the Those ""Zombie freaks"" that love Romero.
This apparently is his definitive masterpiece of a three part trilogy involving withces.(the third is not made yet)  The way this guy freaks you out and shoves the violence and suspense down your throat has been unseen before by me and quite frankly i enjoyed it. The score is scary as hell and the lighting will make you wish you stayed sober for the movie.  Each death scene has never been done before and beleive me you will want to take your eyes off of it.  The last 15 minutes of the movie will make you turn the light back on and lock the all the windows why you sit in your bed in silence trying to ponder what you just watched.",1038873600,,1144,4.327102803738318
190646,5,1572522232,"I saw ""Suspiria"" on its' release in 1977 with a group of friends and no one liked it but me. I was just blown away. It's been at the top of my list for years. I've since owned various incarnations of it ever since it appeared on tape. There's never been a good print of it until Anchor Bay got a hold of it. I now own the 3-disc set on DVD and couldn't be happier with it. The film is intoxicating from start to finish. Jessica Harper was the ideal choice for the American ballet student who dances her way right into a witches' coven in a German dance academy. Joan Bennett and Alida Valli are solid ice as the acadamys' overseers. What Argento can do with colors, sets and atmosphere are phenomenally on display here. The Goblin score is almost unbearably intense. Schoolgirls take on a menacing aura as the newcomer (Harper) struggles to fit in and establish some sort of independence much to Bennetts' and Vallis' chagrin. Harper is curious as to the teachers' nightly activities and when her also suspicious roommate disappears, she sets out to uncover the truth. The rain of maggots on the girls from the rotting food in the attic is still an unsettling sequence. But the murder set pieces are the real chillers. These are some of the most elaborate, garish and grisly deaths Argento has orchestrated in any of his films. The climax when Harper discovers the ancient witch Helena Marcos' resting place only to have her rise and summon the corpse of Harpers' roommate is one of the most terrifying sequences Argento has ever done. When Harper stabs the witch in the neck all Hell breaks loose and the walls literally come tumbling down in flames. With ""Deep Red"", this is my favorite of Argentos' films. The interviews with Harper and others on the Anniversary disc are really entertaining and informative. And the entire Goblin soundtrack is on another disc as well. A fantastic package and collectors' item. ""Suspiria"" ranks as one of the best horror films ever made by anyone. Simply a modern classic.",1038700800,3,2009,4.661971830985915

First an expelled girl from the school is murdered, and the blind piano player is killed by his own watch dog, and even maggots drop from the ceiling!

Argento found the perfect heroine in Jessica Harper, who plays the role of an emotionally detached American at a German ballet school. The emotional detachment that she portrays in her character adds significantly to the mood of the film. Argento also uses color for setting mood brillianty, much in the same style as Kubrik, though not with quite with the subtleness that Kubrik used color in his films. The acting of the rest of the cast is satisfactory at best, with the exception of the first two victims who shouldn't have been given any dialogue in the film. 3/5 stars for low grade acting and poor special effects.

But the script is not what draws one to a Dario Argento movie.  No, it is Argento's directing flair and sense for framing scenes that makes his films special.

190660,5,1572522232,"Dario Argento clearly originates from the Hitchcockian school of suspense. In typical Argento fashion the characters and plot are all but ignored in his effort but it seems difficult to imagine why his films seem of such high quality. There is not a better director with regards to camera angles and lighting that I have ever seen, it is no wonder he writes all of his own screenplays. His films do not need dialogue or deep character development because it simply isn't what he sets out to do. Argento intrigues you and allows you to trust a film and then is willing to completely shift it's direction just to scare you. The plush colors and impossible camera angles that consistently make you wonder how the hell he got up there to get that incredible shot are what make Argento's films great and clearly his own.
Susperia is Argento's masterwork. Albeit, Tenabrae and Inferno are also both done very well, this is one of the greatest horror films ever made and not enough people have seen it. Argento's style is accentuated in this film and he is free to do whatever he wants visually because of the broad script he works with here. The film is like any nightmare you have had that sticks with you for most of the day. I have no question that may be where Argento gets some of his bizarre ideas. The beginning of the film simply shows a girl walking through a thunder shower and the way the scene is filmed and the music is placed makes you realize just how good Argento is at creating suspense in a scene that would normally be filmed with far less attention. Another thing that makes Susperia a great horror movie is the soundtrack, a soundtrack in which I would argue is more frightening than both Halloween and The Omen. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves great horror (there are few great films in that genre), although Argento's style is often difficult to appreciate at first to those accustomed to conventional film work.",1024963200,5,1947,4.597701149425287

Visually, it's wild to look at ... kind of like a whorehouse in Querelle or a Ken Russell daydream. Otherwise it does not have much going for it. The soundtrack is effectively creepy - but if you have a home theater system, be warned: it is LOUD.

All the killings were partially cut ; believe me, for those who knew what can now be called ""the old version"", the end of the first murder is an astounding and perverse surprise !

I admit that some of the imagery is moderately unsettling, and the first twenty minutes had me alarmed, but Dario Argento wastes all his energy on gaudy, day-glow sets (not at all frightening, just tacky) and loopy, labored death sequences that are never effective.  The excessive, fake-ish gore is neither harrowing nor gleefully exuberant, it's just tedious and stupid.  The plot is incoherent, and not in a good way--I have no problem with movies that follow dream logic or sacrifice common sense for cinematic effect, but this one is just a cluttered, sloppy mess that stumbles forward in fits and starts.  The terrible dubbing was irritating; I don't know whether there were multiple dialogue tracks recorded for this film but the one presented on this DVD is awful.  I like Jessica Harper very much, but she's wasted (except for the googly eyes, which are put to good effect).  Lots of potential in the premise, but terribly executed; all of Argento's over-the-top-and-off-the-cliff pyrotechnics are just distracting, not scary.  The final sequence is hysterically funny, an orgy of cheap gross-out horror effects that doesn't make any sense or build upon the ""story"" up to that point.  And then that's it--it just ends.

Like the ""Dawn of the Dead"" Anchor Bay DVD, ""Suspiria LTD Ed.""  almost makes you forget you're watching a film made over 20 years ago.  Crystal clear picture, excellent sound and vibrant colors all make this a real treat. Sure, the price is much more steep than the regular DVD release, but it's well worth it.
Most everything the average viewer would want to know about this film is included in this package, including an extensive disertation plus Jessica Harper interview found in the enclosed booklet.  And speaking of Jessica Harper, though she's obviously aged quite a bit since the film was made still has that little girl innocence and cute too-big head in the recent on-camera interview.
The Goblin ""Daemonia"" video is delightfully cheesy, but it appears the lead member Claudio Simonetti is the ONLY original member of the group in the video (the drummer in particular looks a little too young to be an orginal member of a band that's had roughly a three-decade history); I may be wrong on this.
An overall 5-star rating goes to this disc; perhaps some behind-the-scenes footage captured during the prodution would've been nice, but I can't complain with what's presented here...

190677,2,1572522232,"Dario Argento's film Suspiria is one of his better films.  However this is not a very good film. As with most Argento fare there is plenty of blood and gore to keep some fans happy, but the rest of us just keep saying ""Get on with it."" After reading about how scary and shocking this movie was I decided to borrow it from a friend and watch it.
The plot surrounds an American dancer who attends a European ballet school only to find out that it seems to be a witch's coven. However by the time Argento gets around to the point I had lost intrest in the film. Dario Argento has long been respected by horror fans for his movie making and directing. This reviewer can't understand why people fimd this man so good. Dario Argento is not the worst director (That honor goes to the Italian director Lucio Fulci, see Zombie review) but he makes a strong case at times. This is a slow moving movie that show's that with enough stage blood and FX anyone can be considered brilliant. Some of Argento's film have not been as bad like Phenomena, however his debut with  The Bird With the Crystal Plumage shows that he may just be good at thowing blood around. A real good friend has almost all of his films and I have seen quite a few of them. I am a big fan of horror and I will watch anything that looks interesting, that is why I have seen his movies. Dario needs to go remember that under all the blood there is still a movie to be watched. Argento and Fulci are one and the same. Both use too much blood (most likely to make up for there lack of talent) and are very sucsessful at there craft. I will say one thing for the both of them. They are out there making there movies and making a living at it by following there dreams, but remember the same can also be said for Ed Wood.",1016928000,5,1774,4.184210526315789
190678,4,1572522232,"I really feel that most of the horror movies out there are garbage. Modern horror, in particular, is so formulaic (slapstick comedy mixed with gore) and predictable it is amazing they even draw an audience. As a genre it has a ton of potential and some of my favorite films fall into this category: Jaws, The Shining, Alien, The Vanishing (Spoorloos), etc. However, for every good horror film there are a 100 mediocre to awful films that shouldn't have even been made. What is lacking in these films is the cerebral and atmospheric elements that are the essence of fear. I guess this is what attracted me to ""Suspiria."" I always heard a lot about this film and Argento's reputation. It sounded like something that I would like, but Argento's notoriety for gore put me off seeing it. If used appropriately gore doesn't bother me, but I am no way a ""gore fiend."" I assumed that ""Suspiria"" would just be the gratuitous gore-fest that ruins so many titles in the horror genre. But itching for something different and creepy I finally bit the bullet and watched it. I must say I was very pleased. The plot is very loose. I've read that many people think the plot is non-existent, but I think the plot is pretty clear (pay attention to the last scene and then rewatch the beginning). Though it is not super intricate, it is satisfying. But where ""Suspiria"" is really effective is in its imagery and use of sound. It is extremely atmospheric and hallucinatory; almost like a dream. There are many scenes where the girls are simply walking down the hallways, and every time it is creepy as hell. The use of light and primary colors are particularly effective. As far as the gore goes, yes there are a few very discomforting scenes. However, by today's standards they are pretty tame. In fact, I would say that the 'X-files' have more graphic scenes then what is in ""Suspiria."" If you want to laugh and have a shock around every corner like in ""Scream,"" ""Suspiria"" is probably not the film for you. But if you want to sit back, turn off your mind and get [pulled] into a bizarre, haunted, moody dream, ""Suspiria"" may be just the film your looking for. I'm glad I picked it up.",1016496000,,2167,4.573264781491003
190679,5,1572522232,"I've read many reviews here and Suspiria is either hated or loved. Not much middle ground. I like it and always have.
I first saw it in a very edited version and was disappointed. Next I rented a video documentary about Argento which oddly enough showed many scenes that had been censored from the version of Suspiria I watched. Those scenes are not permitted in actual movie context but were allowed in a documentary on the directors work? That is so weird.
...
...Many complain here that there is no track listing for the 3rd disc/soundtrack in new DVD-Box.

190680,5,1572522232,"Narration from Suspiria:  ""Suzy Banyon decided to perfect her ballet studies at the most famous school for dancing in Europe.  She chose the celebrated Tamm Academy of Freiborg.  One day, at nine in the morning, she left Kennedy Airport, New York, and arrived in Germany at 10:40 PM, local time.""
So begins a journey that the American girl would never have anticipated in her wildest dreams.  A student, Patty Newman, is seen leaving the in the pouring rain scared...  That is nothing compared to the gruesome manner of her death at her girlfriend's flat.  It ends with the painted ceiling glass bulging out and shattering towards the foyer, followed by Patty's garrotted, bloody body crashing downward from a worm's eye view.  Exquisite!  Bulging is also used in Inferno when the body of Mark's fellow student crashes down in front of him.
Suzy is the only likeable character here.  She is pretty, shy, humble, but most important of all, she is intelligent and intuitive, which helps her during her stay.  And Jessica Harper makes her a credible unique person the viewer roots for.
Alida Valli is also effective as the forbidding Miss Tanner, a typical supervisor-type Guardian.  1940's star Joan Bennett (Madame Blanc) is a more tempered Guardian, but nevertheless gives the presence that she is in charge.  I don't know who plays the fat piggy-eyed servant.  The character, who plays a semi-important role here, seems to have been raised on ugly pills all her life.
This movie if anything, is representative of Dario Argento's wild use of lights.  Red and blue are the key colours here.  The exterior of the academy is red, as are the carpeted panels in the hallways.  My favorite use of red is when the girls are in the practice hall, converted to a makeshift dormitory.  The hall is bathed in a hellish red glare.  The shape of the directress behind Suzy and Sarah is nothing compared to the guttural, asthmatic snores emanating from that mysterious personage.  Creepy with a capital creep!  Red is also the colour of blood, and there is a lot of that here, as well as the wine Suzy has to drink during her restricted diet.
Blue light is seen when Ms. Tanner marches up the attic to find out where the maggots are coming from.  The creatures fall down through ceiling cracks and into dorm rooms, causing mass hysteria among the girls.  Suzy freaks out, but that's nothing compared to the reaction of the other girls.  Pandemonium, to say the least.  The way Argento stages their emergence is unexpected and gradual.
And Goblin's wild and weird score of screams, insanely pounding drums, guitars, echoing hisses of ""witch"" and of course sighs (Suspiria is Italian for sigh) might as well mirror Argento's perverse mind.
Suspiria is more a triumph of design and suspense rather than logic (e.g. why kill Daniel the pianist?), and it's important to remember that in order to enjoy this stunning film.  American and British horror have nothing on this masterpiece!",1015027200,,2965,4.8585657370517925

""What?!?"" I thought.  This movie isn't that great at all.  The blood is way too bright, it looks like paint and there's not nearly enough gore.  I guess as a horror movie it's ok, but the script is still no better than most of these Italian flicks and the acting could definitely see some improvement.  I agree with the other reviewer that gave this a negative review, the cinematography is the closest thing to a redeeming factor in the movie, but it's definitely not enough to make this worth purchasing.  I take that back, the music video of the title track is also really great, it's got to be one of the funniest videos I've ever seen; (foriegn funny) I guess it's Goblin, but it flashes ""Demonia"" at the beginning and the guys look a little young to be the legendary composers of the 1970s/80s.  I don't think the second disc could have fit on the first, but it is definitely expendable.  The soundtrack is ok, but Goblin put out some better stuff in their days (Dawn of the Dead, (Zombi) Profondo Rosso, Phenomenon....) and, no, there is no track listing or liner notes for it.  The DVD booklet is pretty thick and has some good points in interviews, etc, but I can't stress this enough: rent it.  Better yet, use your money to buy something by Lucio Fulci, George Romero or Pete Jackson: Dead-Alive (funny, well-acted/scripted and without a doubt the goriest movie ever made) Zombie, The Beyond, Dawn of the Dead or Bad Taste.

Actually, there can't be that many Oscar winning ones, either.
Dario Argento, the director, dismisses objections to his treatment of women in his films and insists on being the hand that stabs. I think he's a coward who won't take responsibility for the climate of fear that women have to live in today. Ah, you say, but what about all the woman in this film who are willing to be portrayed as carved meat? If they have no qualms about betraying their sex, then why should Argento?

190688,4,1572522232,"Called the ""Italian Hitchcock,"" Dario Argento has made some of the most memorable films I've ever seen. ""Suspiria"" is widely praised as his masterpiece, and it is a masterpiece in certain ways. It is full of all the things a horror film should have: Good shocks, an eerie musical score, exquisite lighting, and effective camera moves. Any director who's ever made a horror film knows that the camera has to become like the third character in a scene where two people are talking, and the music is the fourth. Creepy music and precise visuals make a horror film memorable. ""Suspiria"" has both, although the dubbed over dialogue (I still don't get why he does this, even if it is to avoid working with boom mics, having them drop into frame on accident or something) can get your bad attention, and the acting is somewhat subpar for the most part. But as a rule, horror films have never thrived on excellent performances (""Carrie"" is an exception), so it doesn't truly matter. We have our final girl, who we care about, and the school that makes as an excellent backdrop for the film's terror.
The film centers around a dancer who has enrolled in a school of dancing somewhere in Italy probably. It is in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by woods for what could be miles or merely a few hundred yards. Jessica Harper is our final girl and she fills the role nicely, using her wide eyes and girl next door looks to capture our sympathy as things happen to her. When she finds out that the school is actually a front for a witch's coven, all hell breaks loose, and she may be the only one with the brains and the information to end it all. That's pretty much it. There are too many surprises to really say much more. The film begins almost immediately, letting characterization come along for the ride instead of wasting a half hour of valuable time on introductions to all the dancers and teachers at the school.
The real stars of the film are the music and cinematography, which when combined make a truly atmospheric and freaky experience. Dario Argento's personal Goblin group composed the music for ""Suspiria"" and they are in their highest form. Their score is equally compelling and wicked. Argento's camerawork is some of the best he's done, using his lighting to fill in the gaps of what could have been a boring scene. It's a real joy to watch a film like this which takes so much delight in scaring the wits out of you. Argento has real style, and it shows.",1010534400,4,2464,4.576923076923077

I had heard so much about Dario Argento and how wonderful this movie was, so I didn't hesitate to buy it on DVD, regardless of the price; I was sure that it was worth it. I took it home, watched the entire movie, and was gravely dissapointed. My fiancee was actually asleep by mid-movie! I am a huge fan of Lucio Fulci and Mario Bava. I expected this movie to be all out in the gore department, having heard so much about the dog attack scene and the ""most violent murder scene ever."" To me, it was really lacking in gore, especially because it is so highly ranked on everyone's ""must see"" list; right up there with ""Zombie"" and ""The Beyond."" Granted, I really did enjoy the razor wire scene. And, I was really impressed with the over all plot and story line. Bottom Line: If you're like me and you love all out guts and gore, do not buy this movie!

190693,5,1572522232,"I first saw Suspiria a few years ago as a VHS rental but I couldn't remember too much about it. But suddenly, the world of Italian horror has been broken wide open so I picked up this three disk limited edition. Watching Suspiria is sort of like dreaming awake. Colored lighting is used to great effect and the sound track just sort of lulls one into submission. The plot makes about as much sense as a dream, that is to say, the movie all makes sense while watching but looses cohesion quickly once one returns to the ""real"" world. I think that is why I only remember watching the VHS rental but not too much of the movie.
The three disc set includes a newly made documentary and a Goblin soundtrack from the movie. The documentary suffers from subtitles that are sometimes washed out against a light background. Otherwise, it is informative. The Goblin CD is a lot fun to listen to and I find myself humming the main theme all the time. Unfortunately, I do not find a listing for the names of the songs.

After several viewings I have decided it is one of my favorite films; beautifully photographed with an emphasis on eerie primary colors, and looking like it was filmed last year rather than back in 1977, it is further enhanced by Goblin's ultra-creepy score which also sounds fresh and not dated in the least.  While the acting is only average (save the lead, Jessica Harper, who has some of the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen), and the story does at times seem slightly hackneyed, it has just the right amount of gore to please gorehounds while not alienating fans of more ""mainstream"" fare.  I could go on all day about the director's emphasis on style as a way to enhance mood; Hitchcock would surely have approved.  Suffice it to say that Suspiria has instantly become the crown jewel of my collection.  Put it on and have your friends try to guess what year it was made.

Its predominately female cast and a virtual lack of sex and nudity are also quite unusual in films of this type. Yes, it does have a few horrific murder scenes that would have gotten the film an X rating (this Anchor Bay DVD is unrated and uncut). But the majority of the film takes the ""high road"" in horror film-making -- rather than drenching you with blood and guts and wall-to-wall violence, it stirs up creepy atmosphere, builds up suspense, and punctuates them with shocks that are created with originality and brilliance.
The DVD's THX-certified video transfer is SUPER, with sharp picture, rich colors, and fine details. The Dolby Digital and DTS English surround soundtracks are clean and strong, but channel separations are sometimes quirky. There are no subtitles of any language. But it does have English closed captioning.
Anchor Bay released 60,000 copies of the 3-disc Limited Edition, which includes a second DVD of a new 52-minute documentary, and a music CD of the movie's music soundtrack. The documentary is essentially a collection of interviews of the cast and crew, who talk about the conception of the film (""Snow White"" was an inspiration), the score, the style of the film, and their favorite scenes and anecdotes. The first disc contains the other extras: 2 trailers, 3 radio spots, 1 TV spot, about 100 stills, a music video of the movie's theme music performed by Daemonia, and bios of the director, writer, and star. There is also a 30-page DVD booklet containing an essay on the film and an interview with star Jessica Harper.

The movie appears to have good direction, but where it was being directed I don't know.  The story line is not so bad, however the suspense is just NOT there.  I admit I jumped once (in the begining) but that was all.  I even fell asleep!!  AND when I woke up, I realized I didn't miss much.  To make matters worse, when the opportunity for suspense finally occurs, the movie ends abruptly (A MAJOR LETDOWN).  I would compare this movie with the late 70's tv flick ""Satan's School for Girls"".  So if you liked that, you will like this.  If you did, chances are Charlie Browns The Great Pumpkin gives you nightmares and only then can I understand the positive reviews for Suspiria.  I like horror, but this movie didn't have it.  It had a great score, great set design, even the filming was good, but in comparing to great classic horror films, such as Psycho, Halloween, The Excorcist, it is NOT near the classic the other reviewers lead you to believe.

190705,2,1572522232,"SUSPIRIA

(Italy - 1977)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Technovision)
Theatrical soundtrack: 4-track stereo

In a short essay which accompanies Anchor Bay's special three-disc edition of Dario Argento's SUSPIRIA, Travis Crawford offers the following observation: ""For the small minority who may be experiencing the full-throttle sensory assault of Dario Argento's...horror masterpiece SUSPIRIA for the first time...I envy your innocence."" As it turns out, Travis' envy is wholly misplaced. It breaks my heart to say it, but Anchor Bay's disc - prepared under the auspices of Lucasfilm's much-vaunted THX program - is one of the biggest disappointments in the short history of DVD.

Of the four soundtracks on the disc which I was able to access through my my 5.1 audio equipment (I'm not DTS-equipped), only the French version - in lowly 2.0 surround - has anything like the kind of sonic impact which Argento originally intended. Several layers of music on all the others, including the Dolby Digital EX track, have been mixed so low that they might just as well not be there at all! Crank up the audio as much as you like, but it won't make a blind bit of difference...

My main point of reference has always been the (in)famous double-assault which takes place near the beginning of the film, one of the most genuinely frightening set-pieces in movie history. But much of the scene's effectiveness depends heavily on Goblin's deafening music score, which adds electric guitars (I'm assuming that's what they are) to a soundtrack filled with drums and screaming vocals. Here, several vital musical elements sound like they're buried under tons of cotton wool, completely diluting the overall effect. Just LISTEN to the difference in the French version, where the soundtrack has a depth and clarity which explodes out of your speakers like the Crack of Doom!

But even this sounds a little muffled beside the old Image laserdisc (released in the late 1980s), which featured a -literally! - room-shaking surround track, providing a level of reference that Anchor Bay's DVD doesn't even begin to approach. Strangely, AB's disc is also missing a number of significant music cues, sound effects and (apparently) some stray lines of dialogue which all appeared in the laserdisc edition.

Two things add insult to injury: First, the DVD's picture quality is ABSOLUTELY SUPERB - Anchor Bay has delivered an utterly stunning print of the film, and the Technovision frame is perfectly preserved on this anamorphic (2.35:1) disc. Secondly, there are dozens of reviews all over the Internet which praise the DVD's soundtrack for its strength and vitality, presumably written by people who are largely unfamiliar with the way it SHOULD sound. Frankly, their enthusiasm is completely baffling! Listening to the old laserdisc over this DVD is akin to having an obstruction suddenly removed from your ears - the difference is obvious and immediate. Perhaps the DTS version is better, I don't know, but the Dolby tracks are extremely poor and should never have been allowed onto the disc in this condition. What on earth were the guys at THX listening to when they approved this appalling travesty?!

Simply put, this disc represents only half the movie that Dario Argento intended you to experience. And if you ARE seeing the film for the first time and you think it sounds OK - believe me, you ain't heard nothing yet!",1002844800,5,3397,5.086175942549372

190710,4,1572522232,"For those of us who think that Wes Craven is the master of the horror genre, we can think again. I'm speaking these words after watching ""Suspiria,"" one of the most frightening and terrifying horror movies ever made. Created by Italian director Dario Argento, the movie manages to be menacing and gory at the same time, and Argento fills his canvas with a vast array of vivid yet bizarre colors, eerie lighting and camera techniques, and a soundtrack to top all horror soundtracks. In short, this is one hell of a scary movie!
The plot is a basic one, more of a vehicle for Argento's explorative imagination. It begins with a storm, as young Susy Banyon (Jessica Harper) arrives in Germany to attend ballet school. Argento wastes no time in creating a sense of unease, from her cab ride to the school, as she watches the colors of street lights in the pouring rain, to the gruesome and outright malicious murder of a runaway student. All of this happens within the first ten minutes, which should be a message of what lies ahead (in other words, be prepared).
The movie then takes us to the school itself, a dazzling array of vivid colors and elaborate set pieces that put the house in Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"" to shame. Susy is shown the many rooms and introduced to the staff and students, though discovers that she will be rooming off campus. That is, until she begins to get suspicious about strange occurrences, and the staff relocates her to the premises. Her suspicions mount higher, and she begins to wonder if there isn't more to the ladies that run the academy.
You may find yourself forgetting the plot behind all of this mayhem, but that's perfectly reasonable, given the fact that Argento seems to be more interested in attacking our minds than provoking them. And he succeeds in doing just that, taking us into the darkest depths of horror with his adept use of gore, bursting colors, camera movements and creepy sounds from all around.
This is extremely unsettling stuff here, some of the most elaborate yet unbearable set pieces ever constructed for a film. The beginning murder sequence is a true shocker, one that we see coming, but never in such a gruesome manner. Other sequences involve a blind man being attacked by his own seeing-eye dog, multiple stabbings, a girl's corpse coming back to life... it never stops.
But it all works due to Argento's ability to get under our skin before shocking us out of it. Before each scene of brutality, there is a wonderful buildup of suspense and terror, because even though we know what's going to happen, we're totally in the dark as to how it will occur. He keeps us waiting impatiently by employing a slowly building soundtrack, heightened by slow camera movements that center on the faces of the person involved.
""Suspiria"" will remain in the memory long after its first viewing; in fact, you may never forget it. It stands out as a visionary masterpiece, one for the senses and the mind, a horror film that transcends the boundaries of the genre.

Suspiria is several cuts above most of the Italian schlocko fests that pass for horror films. I read once where the Italian idea of horror is one of trying to capture the essence of a nightmare, therefor, contemporary logic need not apply. If you watch Suspiria with that idea in mind, it works very well. Don't ask why a ballet school would just happen to have a spare room full of razor wire, just suspend all rational and pretend you're in a nightmare world with it's own rules of reality. The strange characters, creepy lighting, and non-sequiter events are either ridiculous or mesmerizing, depending on your approach when watching this film. Shut off the lights and crank the sound.

To quickly give a plot summary, a girl from America flys overseas to attend a european ballet school.  Things start out strange as the first night, as it is pouring rain, a girl runs out of the ballet school in a panicked state just as the American girl is arriving by cab.  Instead of being allowed in, the American girl is refused entrance and is forced to come back the next day where, contrastly, she is eagerly greeted and taken in.  She is informed that two of the student are dead, one being the girl she saw the night before.

When I saw this film, I was completely disappointed. SUSPIRIA is a very stylish, yet incomprehensive film. I consider Argento's THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMMAGE to be a lot better than this horror film. Other than some really bloody moments, SUSPIRIA suffers from too much style, an annoying soundtrack, & weak performances from everyone involved, especially the lead actress Jessica Harper. It's as if she's bored to death in this movie!
Argento should have done better, in my opinion. SUSPIRIA was a very stylish, colorful, slick, yet weak & overblown. All style, but very little substance.",999043200,5,804,4.919117647058823

190723,4,1572522232,I shudder at the thought of the previous releases of Suspiria. I bought a Fox/Lorber version which was the full nc-17 caliber version of the film presented in it's original theatrical aspect ratio but contained horrendous sound fidelity and video quality. I mean it sounded like someone had sealed glass jars over the actors' lips and had them speak through them. The video looked like a copy of a copy of a copy in EP mode. Yeeesh!! The Magnum video release had improved picture and sound but showed the R rated version in pan and scan. Judging from Anchor Bay's past remaster and/or restoration efforts this should be one dandy DVD. The soundtrack is presented in DD 5.1 EX and DTS 6.1 ES. The transfer is THX certified as well.

The film score is un-matched in my opinion. The Goblins have created one of the best ever horror soundtracks to grace a film. It is such a compliment to Dario Argento's effects and intentions. I think the fact that an american is thrown into an unfamiliar country, situation, etc...adds to the intended portrayal of fear throughout. You can just sense that evil is present throughout the film thanks mostly to The Goblins. It is similar to the way you know evil is present in the Evil Dead Films, but only in the evil dead films the camera work (with sound) are indicators...In Suspiria it is mostly due to the Goblin soundtrack.

It is not, admittedly, for those who don't like a slower pace, and is not a cheap-shock-a-minute gore fest like alot of horror films, but thoughtful and artistic. The color saturation is beautiful, and the screen is drenched in greens and reds, making the viewer feel quite uncomfortable (it grabs you so much that, later in the film, when the main character actually leaves the primary setting, the outside world doesn't quite seem right). The music is insane; one of the best ever. Goblin has never been better. And there is blood and gore and frights. This is my favorite movie ever, so don't listen to a few negative reviews by people who don't get it ... - check it out for yourself. It won't be a waste of time.",993427200,,793,4.584507042253521

The eerie (if a little thin) plot involves a coven of witches who own a classy ballet school.  However, it is the brilliant use of the camera that truly creates a sense of dread and fear. And, to add to the menacing quality of the visuals is a truly fantastic (and relentlessly disturbing) musical score by Itallian rock band Goblin. The only element of Suspiria that dissapointed me was the slightly watered-down ending, which seemed rather rushed and blunt when compared to the slow-building terror of the rest of the film. However, by that time you'll be so thrilled and horrified by the superb first half that this will hardly matter. In conclusion, this is a classic and a must-see.

I particularly like the blue, green and red hues which give the film a gothic/nightmarish vision and lots of atmosphere. Some spectacular/unusual murder sequences(reminiscent of The Omen) and definitely not for the squeamish.
Also, a creepy ghoulish cast of characters helps to build tension and incoherence. Some references to alchemy and the occult make it black magical!!
I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it for horror fans. Watch it in the dark for maximum effect!!",987811200,,653,5.046296296296297
190729,5,1572522232,"For those who are not familiar with the italian horror genre or with Dario Argento this is the film to watch in order to be correctly introduced to Argento and the genre. The film is about an american ballet dancer named Suzy Bannon(Jessica Harper) who is accepted into a prestigous ballet school in Germany. But then she discovers that the headmistresses and some of the other staff are actually a coven of witches. Don't concern yourself with the plot because this movie is not about the plot. In this film Argento uses every method he can to scare the bejesus out of you. Creepy camera movements, a terrifying music score which he composed and which is played by Goblin, great cinematography  (a great use of the colors blue, red, yellow, and green) and an immense amount of blood and gore which only adds to the terror. Your senses experience a rush watching this film, especially in the dark and that was the intention. Jessica Harper turns in the best acting ever seen in an Argento film and the supporting cast is good as well, it includes Alida Valli(THE THIRD MAN, INFERNO) and Joan Bennett(THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW, SCARLETT STREET). He also co-wrote the film with his wife Daria Nicolodi(TENEBRE, PHENOMENA). It was based on a story she heard from her grandmother about when her grandmother was young how she enrolled in a school and how she discovered that the teachers did witchcraft. And the first ten minutes of the film are unforgettable, they are arguably the best sequence in an Argento film. They inclue one of the most terrifying and one of the most bloody murders in film history. I dare say it even rivals the shower scene in PSYCHO. This film has been acclaimed by critics around the world and it had a great commercial success too. Do yourself a favor and watch this masterpiece. Do not miss it.",987465600,6,1818,4.663551401869159

Its a great film but definitely not the scariest ive seen. The first ten minutes though are,not breathtaking,but really good. Theres enough suspence in these opening ten minutes than anything of late youve seen. I wasn't expecting much of a plot after reading others reviews and i wasn't dissapointed. The beautiful camera work and set design make up for it though. This is not a great horror film,its a great film. PERIOD.The thing i like about this one though is the fact that you can watch it time and time again and get something new out of it. I`m not sure if its just me or weather you really are not sure if its really happening,if shes dreaming or if shes developing an extreme psychotic state. The best example of this is a scene when she kills a bat in her room(!!) with a chair and the very next scene shes sat on her bed calmly smoking a cigarette as though nothing happened.

Went back a week later and sat through the whole thing..... Since then, I have watched this video enough times to advise:
Well, let me warn the prospective purchaser: The first 15 minutes or so of Suspiria  are truly unique, frightening, hallucinatory - like all real horror, gets burned into your subconcious.  Ah, if only Dario could have maintained that uniquely manic opening montage/music rhythmn.  What a classic this would have been! But...  The rest of Suspiria?  A terrible letdown.  From a scream to a yawn. Dull, pointless, meandering - usual Euro self-indulugence.
If you enjoy sophomoric attempts at the luridly poetic: maggot closeups, sharp objects threatening to impale nervously bulging eye balls (a Giallo favorite!), then, by all means, go for it. Otherwise, save your dough. Clever camera tricks,(that bird's-eye-on-a-wire swooping over the plaza POV, for example) and lots of post-Bava gels and primary colored shadows may constitude a freaky ""atmosphere"".  But so what?  All style and no substance does not a worthwhile movie make.  So, between a whisper and a scream, Suspiria only rates a gasp.",984787200,5,1357,4.995555555555556

Perhaps I might have enjoyed it more had I watched it alone (my friend hated it) but I'm not sure.  I have to admit that I did find the extreme use of red color a little too much and I did find the music, although effective, to be too loud and redundant.  Maybe that was the point, but I think the overuse of the music made it lose its impact.  I thought the opening murder was very scary, but I don't think that the gore had anything to do with that.  I found the extreme gore distracting rather than scary.  The ending with the directress was very effective (I loved the freaky girl with the knife, that was scary) but when it was over I wasn't scared to turn out the light and go to bed.

190735,5,1572522232,"...Are the first 90!  Suspiria is my favorite horror film of all time, and this is why. For starters, Argento does not rely on simply dialogue and acting to tell the story. Instead, he throws all of himself into creating an atmosphere that is dreamlike, flamboyant, and wicked through use of the camera, the set, and color. The storyline is simplistic and to the point. Suzy Banyon is a young American girl, going to a German dance school. Upon her arrival it is immediately clear that she is not wanted there. The night is dark, stormy, and rain is pouring. An anonymous voice denies Suzy's placement at the school and is told to leave. A girl rushes out of the door and rasps something incoherent about flowers and a secret. From then on, the pace is quickened and through fantastic murders Suzy and her new friend and roommate, Sara, try to end the mystery of their dance school once and for all and make the connection between the administration and the murders. Argento makes brilliant use of colour here; mainly red, green, yellow. The many meanings of those colors can be for fear, tension, confusion, caution, etc. The camera makes hallways seem infinitely long, and they creep up on their characters. In addition, there is a stark contrast between the hushed dialogue of the mainly Italian cast and the loud, almost to the point of annoyance, soundtrack by none other than Goblin. The music is pulsating and fuels the tension, most noteably for Goblin's track ""Witch"", which plays during a murder scene witha blind man in his dog.

I cannot stress enough the easy-to-see hard work of the production team in this film.  Jessica Harper's performance is subdued, but that seems to be the point of the whole film.  Running around passage-ways with creepy lighting seems to intensify the true nature and meaning of this film, which is to scare you out of your wits.  One could watch this film on all sorts of levels; with the music off you could be in awe of the lighting and set design, with the movie turned off you could listen to the music and still feel the essence of the film lingering in your nerves.

What I found visually mesmerizing was how red lighting was used in each scene. He has re-released some of his other classics uncut, uncensored and fully restored.

The first murder seqeunce is one of the most imaginitive, terrifying and intense scenes ever created this side of Wes Craven. The execution of the setpieces are very sophisticated technically (strange for a 70's horror flick) and the sound and cinematography could teach even the most skilled horror directors a thing or two. The plot is a little thin but Argento really makes it come alive. The way this man visualises pure terror is disturbing in itself. The acting is a little poor but then most horror films from the 70's (despite the inferior The Excorsist) aren't exactly oscar worthy on those levels. It's the type of horror film that makes you feel like a young child; vunerable, unaware of the hysteria thats about to take place and unable to cope with the horror your'e confronted with, as well as making you feel like you've never seen anything like it before (which you haven't) or will ever see again.",970876800,5,1180,4.705314009661835

But, as  with almost all of Argento's films, the plot is beside the point, the  brilliantly staged horror sequences are the film's plus. Argento made  innovative use of lighting and sound to create genuinely frightening  sequences that are as dazzling to behold as they are scary. It opens with  one of the most viscous murder scenes ever filmed, which is horrifyingly  unforgettable, and escalated to a frightening and suspenseful climax. But  this is more than an ultra-stylized screamer, the suspense sequences are  truly brilliant and also extremely scary. The best parts of the film are  the first 10-min. and the last 15-min., those scenes alone are among the  scariest and hair-raisingly suspenseful sequences in any horror film.

190744,4,1572522232,"Horror demigod Dario Argento goes all out for his loyal audiences in this feverish, hallucinatory downward spiral into the supernatural.
The plot is quite simple.  Suzy goes to a German ballet academy.  She finds out it  is run by wiches.  Anyone who snoops around or offends them are brutally  murdered.  It is up to Suzy to stop them.  To tell you the truth, Suzy  isn't really a good heroine, she takes a quite passive role in the whole  movie.  Her friend could have very well been the main character.
Well  enough of the plot, because we all know that our beloved Argento does not  specialize in plotting.  The one element that separates this movie from all  the others is the pure amount of visully imagery.  Its almost like a modern  day Alice in Wonderland.  Argento inundates the audience with eerie,  monochoromatic lighting schemes which consist of red, green, and yellow  light.  Futhermore, the movie is rife with unsettling and mysterious set  pieces...such as the lobby with colored glass and the taxi cab.  With such  unnerving imagery, the viewer never feels a sense of calm and there is  alway a quiet apprehension.  You'll never experience anything like Suspiria  outside of Argento's work.
GOBLIN, the soundtrack band, is at their  absolute best here.  The sound track (and effects) is so intense, you can  almost feel the knife being stabbed into your heart or feel the  supernatural forces surround you from all sides.  Very jarring and  frightening.
Although this film has a low body count, the murders are  very brutal and disturbing...combined with the relentless score.  I  guarantee you will never forget the first murders!  But, once again  Suspiria is visual rollercoaster more than anything else.
I did not  give Suspiria five stars for two reasons.  One:  The ending is not at all  what it is cracked up to be.  Seriously, Im not going give it away for you,  but im telling you now it is quite disappointing.  Two:  this film lacks a  strong protagonistic presence.  Suzy finally snaps into action only in the  last third of the film.  In the beginning she is either lying in bed or  moping around while her friend uncovers the secret of the witches.  Other  than that, this film is superb.

This film is more likely to be enjoyed by ""art house"" cinema enthusiasts than your general  Horror audience.  The movie is shot with unusual colours which are supposed  to add to the movies eeriness, but in my opinion, take away any sense of  realism.  The plot is reasonable but not enough is made of it; rather than  having a climatic ending which the film appears be slowly drifting towards  you are left somewhat dissapointed by a cheap effect.
I would only  reccommend this film to those who are interested in artistic visuals or  Argento fans.  Otherwise I doubt if you'll appreciate it.",954374400,4,708,4.67479674796748
190755,5,1572522232,"Produced by one Argento and directed by another, this film casts its spell by laying a very thick veil of atmosphere over a scanty, near-barren world of a plot.  What makes 'Suspiria' so scary is a very clever fusion of  Dario Argento's slick and innovative direction, excellent set design, a  complex soundtrack and the camera's worship of the night. The plot, already  complicated, is made more convoluted to the viewer's senses by Argento's  myriad quirks in his filming technique.  The acting is good and  fills in the cracks left by the ridiculously gory killings. Jessica Harper  makes for a convincing heroine and the makeup for the witch at the movie's  conclusion is nothing short of superb. One skill Argento appears to have  toyed with at the time of shooting was making the plot fall away in the  viewer's mind, leaving behind an erratic spiralling of crazy, dreamlike  sequences of action and 'psychospection'. In 'Suspiria', the first killing  is unnerving in an overt manner but by the time the blind pianist's hound  has ripped out his throat, the horror has become more esoteric, more  symbolic and certainly more disturbing.
  Strangely enough, Argento  was unable to repeat the success of his formula in his later pictures. In  effectiveness, 'Suspiria' is his forte as well as the prime example of what  the Italian horror film boom of the mid-Seventies to the early-Eighties had  on offer to the discriminating fan.
  Even with its heavy helping of  gore, 'Suspiria' is mostly composed of suggestive horror and atmospheric  chills. The Goblins provide an utterly frenetic soundtrack of chimes and  percussion which serves to genuinely amplify the terror. The photography is  beautiful and the quiet dialogue scenes are capable of lulling the viewer  into a dreamy false sense of security, making the action and horror bits  all the more of a rude awakening when they crash through the ceiling.
  Streets ahead of 'New York Ripper' and light years beyond its sequel,  'Inferno', 'Suspiria' is easily the choice pick of the Argento collection.  In fact, it is so terrifying that it could easily pass as the scariest film  of the late 1970's.",954288000,5,2160,5.008474576271187
190756,4,1572522232,"Beatiful scoring, fantastic set pieces, lovely camera work, some of the tensest moments I've experienced in front of a tv set, some fun (and very cliched) supporting perfomances, and a very appealing (and a bit befuddled)  lead.  GOD, if only we could have gotten a story and some character  development to boot, I would rank this as a true film landmark.  This is by  far one of the most well crafted horror films I've seen, and it held my  interest through the whole film, making it's flaws easily forgiveable since  it's SOOOO good where it's good.  Afterwards though, I can think of so many  ways they could have made the story more involving and so much more that  could have been done with the leads, that it leaves me a bit frustrated.  Sure, as just a slasher flick, it's hard to find better than this, but I  think horror is a bit more broad a genre, and it's hard to find films that  don't compromise and display just that, an ""it's just a slasher  flick"" mentality, and go for the compromise.  The ideas for where you  can go with this are endless...the dance academy actually being a sort of  ""hunting grounds"" for unsuspecting prospective witches, with the  Olgas finding success, and the sara's and pat's paying the ultimate price  for not being good enough is my favorite...I would have loved something  like that.  Or perhaps Suzy having known all along that some supernatural  force was at work there, and was covertly working all along to find it and  finish it.  (that one i see as almost possible, since throughout the film,  she seems a bit too wary for someone who doesn't know something's up, and  yet very calm, as if she's thinking ""yeah, yeah, I'm playing along,  playing along, I'm the pretty dancer girl, playing along...*eyes dart* what  the hell kind of place is this...okay, playing along, playing along""  attitude, especially the eyes darting thing...I thought it was cute (BACK!  BACK YOU BIZARRE JESSICA HARPER FETISHESTS!).  That and the nice ambiguous,  blow it all off ending make her look pretty suspicious there...oh there  were six or seven ideas that are better plot structures for this film that  I was thinking of, where are they, oh they're lost in the sea of hundreds  of better ideas to pick from. It's a love/hate thing for me with Suspiria.  I love it while I'm watching it, for the incredible visual and sonic ride  it can give in parts, and then hating it afterwards for not having set  these scenes into a story where they could make some sense, and have these  scenes be propelling something.  Oh well...eventually...but for now, it's  gonna have to do.  I will say I that with all the countless hideously bad  horror flicks there are out there, Suspiria definitely gives you more than  the average GOOD horror movie, and that's always a bit of sweet relief.",951523200,5,2810,4.681724845995893

Instead you will get the Mother of all Black Comedies - a series of very bizarre set pieces that is alternatiely (or simultaneously)  hilarious and extremely gory.  The art  and music direction is outlandish in the extreme, and that alone makes it  worth seeing for anyone interested in the technical aspects of cinema. I  have only seen the TV version, and I understand much of the gore is cut  out. There really isn't too much that is really unbearable to watch, but  what there is manages to be stomach turning and hilarious at the same time.  The editing is choppy and the dubbing is poor and sometimes hard to  understand, which in a way adds to the weirdness of the movie.

Jessica Harper is the most  beliveable actress in the film but I think the obvious dubbing of some of  the other voices ruins the performances of the other girls.  I'm not sure  why the dubbing was done (the lips match so they ARE speaking English) but  I suspect it may have been done because the accents were too thick.  The  dialogue is often dumb but this film is a work of art and a real treat for  those who can appreciate Argento's brilliant style.  Beware of older prints  that were cut for American distribution.  I once attended a showing of this  film at the Chicago Art Institute in which Dario Argento himself appeared  in person to talk about his films.  Embarrassingly, the film had been one  of those butchered prints.  The current video releases are intact and in  wide- screen.  Although I could do without the hokey narrative at the very  beginning while the opening credits are rolling--it sounds really stupid  and it is NOT needed.  This is even present on the current prints and I  wonder if it was what Dario had intended.  Enjoy!",949449600,7,1237,4.699530516431925
190760,4,1572522232,"Though admittedly lax in the logic department, this film by Italian horror maestro Dario Argento is still a stylishly ghoulish treat.  The bizarre sets and brilliant, almost lurid, color schemes(utilizing Technicolor's  ""Matrix"" system)combine to create a strange netherworld of  supernatural menace and imminent doom.  Immensely adding to the viewer's  unease is the booming score by Goblin.  A diabolical concoction consisting  of many different styles, the music acts as the final catalyst in the  audience's free-fall into unimaginable terror.  Intensely savage,  flamboyantly artistic and unforgettably terrifying, Suspiria is definately  a classic splatter film.",949017600,2,668,6.1521739130434785
190761,4,1572522232,"The way to enjoy Suspiria as a horror film is to put aside all consideration of logic and drama.  For above all else, Dario Argento is a weaver of visual palettes married to blatant scores, and in that area he  has no peer in the horror-film genre. Even if George A. Romero is an  infinitely better director of actors, editor and writer; even if John  Carpenter is subtler -- Argento surpasses them all in imagery, composition  and lighting, and Suspiria is his masterpiece in that regard.
Much has  been made of the film's use of outdated stock and wild colour schemes and  that still stands.  Suspiria is one of the few films willing to abandon  reality almost entirely.  There's no physical reason why this room is blue  and one spot by the bed is red...but why not?  Suspiria is a horror show,  and its merits lie not in the construct as a whole (the writing is very  shaky and the narrative even worse), but in key sequences of almost  delirious power.
It helps that Jessica Harper gives what may be the best  performance in an Argento film to date (Daria Nicolodi in Tenebrae and Asia  Argento in Trauma come close), saying little but expressing much with her  face and mannerisms.  The Goblin score proves the power of rhythms and  motifs within a film score (instead of the boring classical film scores  coupled with Carpenterian ""stingers"" in most '90s horror films)  and is entirely horrifying.  And the set pieces -- a room filled with  barbed wire; the famous maggot storm; the seeing-eye dog plaza sequence;  the incredibly vicious stabbing on the ceiling; the final destruction --  are breathtaking.
Get past the bad performances (Harper excluded) and  terrible writing (dialogue *and* plotting), and just absorb this film with  your senses.  Suspiria is a sensory experience, and on that department it  carries enormous power.",948240000,3,1841,4.826366559485531

Since it was like the same day I saw it, I hadn't done the research I have done lately. And now I want to share that  research with you. Suspiria came from the book ""Confessions of an  Opium Eater"" by Thomas De Quicy. In the book, The Three Mothers were  said to own three houses of witchcraft across the world. Daria Nicolodi,  Dario Argento's girlfriend at the time, told him about a finishing school  where her grandmother once went where black magic was practiced after dark.  This was the inspiration for the Tanz Akademie in Suspiria. Dario used  outdated color film to make the brilliant and flowing colors more vivid and  powerful. Since he used all, he could never use it again in another film.  With its colors, terror, and sheer power, Suspiria is a classic. If you  have not been exposed to the wonderful world of Dario Argento, see this  film. Now! Note: I also reccomend: Phenomena, Tenebre, Inferno and Deep  Red.",945648000,,1035,4.535135135135135

Truly, a film where every detail matters - pay attention during the  (terrifying) sequence with all the students sleeping in the auditorium  together...heavily influenced by Dante, the Pre-Raphaelites, and Ambrose  Bierce, Dario Argenti has succeeded in creating a film well nigh defiant of  plot summary.  The best shot is probably the last, where the heroine, safe  from horror, casts a weird smile at the devastation - throwing viewer  loyalty out of sync in a way that hasn't been seen since Hitchcock caused  viewers to hope the thrill kill went unsolved in 1948's Rope...a superior  film, despite about three scenes of visceral violence which restrict this  film to adults and the non-squeamish.",945648000,2,1139,5.14207650273224

Argento gave his story a tremendous dreamlike  feeling as if we are seing a 90 minute long nightmare. Stephen King and  Clive Barker believe that this is one of the best horror films EVER! Do you  hear?
The eerie music score (done by Goblin and Argento himself) assaults  the viewer in every way you can imagine. It's twisted, noisy and higly  effective.
Remember, after all this is a witch story right?
And believe  me.. this is nothing less than pure Magic.

7797935,4,1572522232,"Dario Argentos classic witch movie is hardly a witch movie at all but, wow, the man could cultivate great atmosphere!

Newcomer ballerina Suzy (Jessica Harper; Suspiria 2018 remake) attends a strict German ballet academy to find that not all is as it seems. Something sinister is afoot, and her roommate (Stefania Casini; Blood for Dracula) is eager to help her solve the mystery.

Writer (in part) and director Dario Argento (Mother of Tears, Phenomena) relies tremendously on atmosphere, heavily utilizing greens, blues and reds in the set design, wardrobe and lighting to augment the mood. The sets are gorgeous, the dancers are catty (and also gorgeous) and the characters represent exaggerated stereotypes although perhaps not so exaggerated for the 70s. The acting may feel a bit rigid, at times, while delivering an often over-explanatory script. But not in a way that affected my enjoyment of the film.

With my contemporary eyes, Im not impressed with the clunky execution of the death scenes. Retractable knives just don't do it for me and, while quaint, the visual of a victim being stabbed directly in the heart through a hole in her sternum didn't really nail it either. But Argento had a flare for drama, and the post-mortem shots were appropriately macabre.

I was particularly fond of the opening death when the bystander was impaled by large pieces of glass and window framing from the ceiling. However, quite to the contrary, the bewitched murderous dog scene was just okay and I was completely unmoved by the maggot infestation scene. But, again, Im watching with 2018 eyes, having seen perhaps 1000 horror movies released after 1977. So, theres that. And when have maggots ever really been done well except for The Lost Boys (1985)?

We find ourselves asking a lot of questions like where did all the maggots come from? Where do the instructors go at night? Why is Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett; Dark Shadows) so pushy about where the dancers sleep? Why did it take so long for the killer to jimmie open that lock and why the Hell was that floor filled feet deep with wire coils? Yeah, some questions are weirder than others.

Everything builds to a rather anticlimactic, generally unsatisfying and completely unresolved (yet still over-explained) ending featuring no stronger special effects or urgency than earlier in the film. Truly, the films greatest assets were the least dramatic: Udo Kier (Blade, Flesh for Frankenstein) making his least melodramatic appearance ever, and Barbara Magnolfi (The Sister of Ursula) as the deliciously catty ballerina. Lets face it, this sorcerous school is no Hogwarts.

Dare I say it, but this beloved classic felt boring. Yeah, I said it. But honestly, most classic horror bores melike the original Halloween (1978). My enjoyment in these films (and, yes, I do enjoy them despite my criticism) is seeing how tropes were utilized back then, before themes were yet overused; their early iterations that inspired the films to come and the concepts that would be copied, honored, or simply ripped off by their successors. So, for me, watching Suspiria feels like taking a snazzy horror film appreciation class. And, even if boring, I appreciated it for that.

The plot is rather thin, really; based on the elemental bits of fairy tales. Jessica Harper's lead character is basically Snow White, the authority figures of the school are wicked stepmothers, throw in a few helpers and unhelpful stepsisters - but no princes! The thundering score by Goblin and the expressionist sets and ultra-vibrant primary colors make the experience of watching it less like watching a movie and more like experiencing a visual/audio album.
