2056853,1,B00022UBJG,"The quality was so pour the last half of the film, you cannot watch it.  I looked so forward to receiving the movie after so many years of wanting it and was terribly disappointed.",1375401600,2,180,4.294117647058823
2056854,5,B00022UBJG,"Love how Pepe LeMoko is the master of his own world in the Casbah, but comes to realize that it has its limits  when he falls in love with another woman, despite having won the heart of Inez who loved him unconditionally  and would do anything to keep him.  And I do mean anything. Even though the law can't touch him within the Casbah, he begins to feel like a prisoner because he covets Gabby, who unlike him, can leave whenever she wants and is therefore out of his reach.  My favorite character is Slimane, the street-wise inspector played by the incomparable Peter Lorre, who recognizes that all he has to do is wait and Pepe's love for Gabby will deliver the elusive thief to him on a silver platter. Strong performances are also turned in by Yvonne De Carlo as Inez and Tony Martin, known better for his singing as the suave and debonair rogue LeMoko.",1375228800,,858,4.445859872611465
2056855,4,B00022UBJG,"This is a movie that I first saw more than 50 years ago and I have wanted to see it again ever since. Although it is not a musical, Tony Martin sings two songs during the course of the story which blend into the story and impressed me very much at theat time. The movie is a remake of a film that previously starred Charles Boyer and Hedy Lamar and presents an interesting tale of the intrigue and life within the walls of the Casbah. The ending i inevitable. but nevertheless sad..",1371254400,,482,4.25
2056856,4,B00022UBJG,Always a pleasure to watch - I like it a lot.  Yvonne DeCarlo and Peter Lorre make the movie for me and it's hard to go wrong with Tony Martin.,1364601600,,143,3.7666666666666666
2056857,5,B00022UBJG,"I can't believe I am finally able to buy this.  For the past 20 years I have looked all over for this movie,  and whoever I asked never even heard of it.  I am now 66 and saw this film when I was a very young child.  But saw it again in my teens and it has always stayed on my mind.  Tony Martin was a very romantic and sexy Star and the Beautiful Marta Toren was an Elegant Mystery woman,  and as for Yvonne Decarlo, she was beautiful and sang very nice.  The story was Romantic and Mysterious too.  A man who is a thief, cannot leave the Casbah or he will be arrested by non other than Peter Lorre.  But Martin falls hard for the Lovely lady portrayed by Marta Toren,  and does try to leave with her.  The ending is heartbreaking and the music is hauntingly magical.  My only problem is it is $50.00.  This is my luck after waiting 20 years to find it.  For Romance buffs out there,  this is a must see.  Them you might get hooked like I did.",1277683200,14,944,3.9946236559139785
2056858,5,B00022UBJG,"I saw this when I was about 12 and remember it to this day, and the other one which is called Algiers. Tony Martin has always been a favorote",1446940800,,141,3.896551724137931
2056859,4,B00022UBJG,"I liked the film very much. It was billed as being about Morocco, however it was really about Algiers in the neighboring country of Algeria. The story is based on a novel about Pepe Le Moko, a notorious jewel thief.  The cast all played their roles well.  The beautiful Yvonne De Carlo played Inez, Pepe's girlfriend.  Yes, she was quite attractive as a young woman, even though she later played on The Munsters.  Tony Martin did a great job of playing Pepe.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the singing was good but not great.",1441584000,,546,4.42

2056866,2,B00022UBJG,"I saw this film when I was very young, and liked it very much. But now, seeing it again, my taste has changed with the time. The only part worth seeing is the beautiful Marta Toren, whose beauty is enthralling. The rest is like a child story. I don""t advise people who have seen it when young to see it again. Really, let bygones be bygones.",1378857600,,341,4.181818181818182

8020863,5,B00022UBJG,"There are very few remakes that I find worth watching; this is an exception. ""Algiers,"" itself a Hollywood version of the French film ""Pepe Le Moko,"" starred Charles Boyer and the exquisite Hedy Lamarr. ""Casbah"" stars Tony Martin, who gives an excellent performance; but how do you follow Lamarr? Answer: with a stunning Swedish brunette named Marta Toren, who died of natural causes at the age of 31. Peter Lorre is excellent, as always, as the police inspector. The print quality is only fair, but the DVD has been a long time coming, and I'm glad I bought it. Perhaps Criterion will get hold of it and do one of their great restoration jobs.",1502496000,3,644,4.657894736842105
8020864,1,B00022UBJG,This was a foreign version of the classic film.  We returned it without trouble.,1480723200,,80,4.714285714285714
8020865,1,B00022UBJG,"Since Amazon mixes reviews for everything together, and God only knows where this review shows up, I am talking about the DVD which the listing says is from Nat C. Goldstone Studio (although the actual DVD I got was marked Venevision International).

Where to start? Well, this isn't even the 1948 version of Casbah. The amateurish DVD case cover art, say it is, but it isn't. This is a 2000 Spanish/Argentinian, Spanish language film Kasbah. Worse yet, the DVD itself is a DVDR, with a stick on paper label, and was obviously made using non-professional mastering software software. The picture quality is horrible, looks like it could have been a VHS tape or TV rip. Even if I did want a copy of the 2000 Spanish film Kasbah (which I don't), this would have been a lousy DVD to get. And Amazon is charging top dollar for this!

Needless to say, it is going back. But insult to injury, Amazon shipped it in non-reusable packaging, so I am going ot have to get my own.packaging for the return.",1470355200,2,993,4.573033707865169
8020866,1,B00022UBJG,The movie that arrived was not the movie promised.  It was a newer foreign movie and not the one with Peter Lorie.  Do not buy this disk it is a big rip off,1470182400,,156,3.696969696969697

8020868,3,B00022UBJG,"This is only Universal's B-movie, bargain-basement, 1948 take on PEPE LE MOKO (Duvivier), ALGIERS (Cromwell) and even CASABLANCA (Curtiz). It has some novel artistic pretensions, however, surpassingly good songs, a piquant cast and several film debuts. The original billing was misleading: De Carlo, Martin, Lorre, newcomer Toren. Martin gets all the screen time (and the great Harold Arlen songs), Toren is very lavishly introduced, and the established De Carlo and Lorre (very likeable and worldly in this role) are unceremoniously relegated to supporting functions alongside such familiars as Virginia Gregg, Hugo Haas, Douglas Dick and even uncredited Kathleen Freeman.

By Universal standards this is a rich cast roster, and the studio daringly splurged for the young hotshot director John Berry (1917-99), the great composer Harold Arlen with lyricist Leo Robin for four custom songs, and even the Katherine Dunham Dancers (Dunham herself acts and dances, and Eartha Kitt pops up in her troupe). So the uncut film runs longer--a full 94 minutes--than most Universal programmers, nicely expanded with the four new Arlen hits: ""For every man there's a woman,"" ""Hooray for love,"" ""What's good about goodbye"" and the exceptional minor-key ""It was written in the stars,"" where Arlen experiments with an angular melody and very sophisticated key progressions.

Martin sang this proprietary repertoire for decades thereafter, but here we hear the keeper songs in context and they actually fit smoothly within the kitschy thief-on-the-run story arc. De Carlo does not dance in this film (and sings Arlen all too briefly), the Dunham troupe is progressive and historically important, and Martin looks especially smashing in his Continental-gangster dark suit with white tie. Toren purrs her lines, cocks her head repeatedly and is a fine Svenska contrast to De Carlo's Algerian tobacconista. Marta and Yvonne share no interactions, De Carlo in her purely decorative role seemingly begrudges Martin his screen dominance, and her best scenes are throwaways with Lorre, who steals the entire picture by playing with an admirably light touch.",1463529600,,2135,5.486322188449848
