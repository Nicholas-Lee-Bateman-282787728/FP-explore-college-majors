5087755,5,B007I0USM0,"I'm struggling to keep from sounding like a cheesy infomercial but having been a physical therapy patient of Bill's and having worked out with him for five years, there aren't sufficient words to communicate how beneficial Bill's program is for people of all fitness levels. I started working with Bill after having had two back surgeries for 3 ruptured discs. I couldn't walk more than 15 minutes without pain. Bill taught me how to build a strong foundation so that today I'm doing the same exercises that he uses with his Olympic athletes. He has rehab'd me through three knee surgeries as well. At 53, I've had my share of orthopedic issues but he always knows how to work around them.

The good news for you is that he has 'spilled the beans' so to speak, in this DVD,  and the one that is coming, so that every one can benefit from his knowledge. This DVD will teach you how to lay the foundation for strength, fitness and good movement patterns that you will carry with you the rest of your life.

So, it's your choice. Spend $20 and give it a try. Or, you could come to Aspen and pay Bill lots and lots of money per hour like the billionaires and professional athletes do. Either way, it will change your health and your life.",1361318400,,1234,4.451327433628318
5087756,5,B007I0USM0,"This DVD has changed my life. Doing the exercises recommended here has helped me with my balance, my posture, and my movement. I see positive changes in my body that I have not previously experienced. I highly recommend this particular DVD for anyone who wants to be more fit.",1361318400,3,276,4.653061224489796
5087785,5,B007I0USM0,"After reviewing this video, Bill reminded me how vital the core is; not just in exercise, but in everyday life.  I utilize his movements, warmups, and philosophies in my everyday training and for the best interest  of my clients.",1384214400,,229,4.846153846153846
5087786,5,B007I0USM0,"I am 63 and fall into the category in the Thinner Next Year book of 'fit & fat"". I have consistently and persistently been exercising 3x per week since I was 25. I also enjoy lots of outdoor physical activities such as bicycling and horseback riding. As an aging male, despite my traditional exercises with machines and old-style calisthenics and static stretches, I have been losing flexibility. Troubled by IT band issues, I searched for answers and about a year ago, found great lower body help with Active Isolated Stretching exercises originated by Aaron Mattes. After reading Thinner This Year, and buying the Preparation For Movement DVD, my upper body flexibility has been greatly enhanced. I had no idea how much my shoulders and mid to upper back needed stretching. My posture has improved significantly. Excellent horseback riding is achieved when the horse and rider's movements are in unison. Until yesterday, I have not had the sufficient flexibility to enjoy that feeling of unity of movement. While riding at a canter yesterday, I suddenly realized that I was fluidly, flexibly, and unconsciously in unity with my horse. Wow!
 Get the book and the DVD to regain whatever you define as fun!",1377907200,13,1205,4.9950248756218905
5087787,4,B007I0USM0,"The exercises in Thinner this year: prep for movement are good for strength and mobility. I plan to do them daily to keep my aging body working. This is a ""how to"" DVD, not one you can exercise to.",1373760000,5,197,4.076923076923077
5087788,5,B007I0USM0,"I am a 68 year old male wanting to continue being functional. This video  clarified important details that are impossible to communicate on the printed page. My body moves differently now, and I can feel functional strength gains as I engage in normal daily activities. Please do a video of the 25 exercises in the book to supplement this one. Old guys like me need it.",1373587200,6,369,4.590909090909091
5087789,4,B007I0USM0,"This DVD is the companion to ""Thinner This Year"" by Chris Crowley.  It is a great series of warm-up exercises to prepare your body for movement. I try to do the sequence every day -- even if I don't have time to do other exercises, this is a great way to stretch and warm up before you begin your day.  My only criticism is that he suggests you do anywhere from 5-10 repetitions of each movement, and that each movement be done fairly slowly, i.e.,10-15 seconds.  However, he only allows enough time for you to do about 3 repetitions before he moves onto the next exercise.  So, you either have to continually press ""pause"" and then move on, or you have to make notes and do the sequences without watching the DVD.  I wish he had actually done the movements for the suggested repetitions; however, his method does allow you to get a faster overview than my way would.  The exercises are very ""senior-friendly,"" so this is a great DVD for someone who is new to exercise, but he provides ways to make the movements more challenging, so it is also useful for someone with more experiences.  A great DVD for anyone interested in fitness.",1367625600,22,1133,4.4975609756097565
5087790,5,B007I0USM0,"I have worked with a number of trainers over the years and based on my experience this series of warm-up movements is safe,very effective and based on current exercise physiology research. It can be used in conjunction with the book Thinner this Year or as an independent stand alone instructional guide. Both athletes and individuals that want a well designed warm-up program that covers all the major muscle groups and improves mobility and balance will benefit from this DVD. I highly recommend it.",1362528000,3,501,5.048192771084337
5087791,5,B007I0USM0,"I'm buying this without delay. As a fitness trainer of 15 years and a studio owner, I know quality. Bill is truly brilliant as a teacher and a master at what he does.",1362355200,3,166,4.0606060606060606
5087792,5,B007I0USM0,"I just received my copy of Preparation for Movement DVD. Based upon his extended experience and research in exercise, sports training and physical therapy, Bill Fabrocini has created an educational DVD for movement that you can adapt to your life style. I formerly was a competitive cyclist and now am a recreational ice hockey player! Before I step onto the ice I want to be prepared so I can prevent injury!! I am 50+ and I know first hand how long it takes to heal from injury! So be educated and play smart. The core, posture and balance exercises require minimal equipment so you can easily do these from your home or travel. I highly recommend this DVD; it nicely complements the book ""Thinner This Year"".",1362182400,4,711,4.650793650793651
5087793,5,B007I0USM0,"As a physical therapist, I find the DVD to be comprehensive, educational, and instructive.  Bill makes the science behind the concept of a dynamic warmup understandable to all and points out how necessary it is for functional movement.  The exercises are simple to do.  Anyone can do them and everyone should!",1361577600,9,309,5.019607843137255
5087794,5,B007I0USM0,"I have been following Younger Next Year, and now Thinner This Year, for four years and it has truly changed my life.  I met Bill at one of the first YNY Total Immersion weeks at the Aspen Club in Aspen, Colo.  He was developing and using his Preparation for Movement program and I could not believe what a difference it made in my flexibility, range of motion and balance.  I have been doing Bill's Preparation for Movement every day for over three years and would not miss a day.  The DVD makes it easy to learn and do, and Bill makes sure you understand the right posture and technique so you get maximum benefit without any risk of injury.  I could not recommend this more highly.",1361404800,14,683,4.388888888888889
