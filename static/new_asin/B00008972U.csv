Nothing else looked good so I decided to give it a try... I popped it into my vcr not expecting anything special. But it was great! Dan Aykroyd, Walter Matthau, and Charles Grodin are just a few members of the first class cast in The Couch Trip. The plot is fabulous the script is good.. And it is just fun to watch... This one will not let you down! Buy it or rent it I promise you will enjoy",987724800,6,546,4.064814814814815

1829488,4,B00008972U,"This film was overlooked upon release and is still under-appreciated.  For fans of Dan Aykroyd and Walter Matthau, such as myself, this is a must have.  Donna Dixon is wonderful in a 'straight man role' and Charles Grodin is incredibly well-cast as the diabolical and semi-mad radio 'shrink'.
The plot is convoluted but Aykroyd is in prison and escapes.  He somehow weasels his way into taking over a call-in radio psychology show that was made successful by Charles Grodin.  Grodin is on vacation at a medical conference with his wife.  He had thought his replacement was some lame small-time prison psychologist(who just happened to be prisoner Aykroyd's penitentiary counselor).  He then runs into his replacement who is at the same conference in London and not 'manning the fort' for him on the radio.
Along the way to success after escape, Aykroyd gets new clothes, that radio psych gig, a girlfriend(his wife in real life, Donna Dixon), and a cohort who recognized his prison togs(Walter Matthau.)
This film is almost a perfect match for 'Trading Places' with the juxtaposition of success and failure being much simpler and faster than we can imagine. That may be unrealistic and a Hollywood device, but watch how plausible they make it seem here.
It sounds complex and a strange brew, but the film is zany, well-directed with great continuity and cohesion, and all leads to a wild ending.  This isn't the best comedy ever made, but it's surely the best comedy you've never seen and well worth a look.",1418860800,,1507,4.909448818897638

1829492,5,B00008972U,I love this movie!! The DVD I bought has a skip flaw at the climax end of the movie. It's a bummer.,1408838400,,99,3.5454545454545454
1829493,5,B00008972U,"I've seen this film quite a few times, but watched it again last night (2014-07-28) as it was on ""free"" TV last week and I DVR'd it on my handy-dandy DirecTV (TM) High Definition Genie (TM) box.  (The TMs are so I don't get sued, by the way.)  But I believe that this was the first time that I've seen it in its original 16 x 9 HD glory; it is always fun to go back and watch older films that you've never seen before in that format.

Like I said before, I've been a big fan of Roger Ebert for a long time, and I started watching his show early on, and continued watching for many years thereafter.  I was saddened when he died last year.  Anyways, I remember an episode of ""Siskel and Ebert"" where the two partners in crime described how 16 x 9 widescreen, as the director generally intends, is so much better than the cropped 4 x 3 garbage that was shown on standard 480i television at the time.  No doubt about it; original widescreen is the only way to go, in preferably 1080P.  (Better yet, 4K is now out, although good luck finding content.  And 8K is on the horizon.  Goodie!  I hope you have 20 grand for a new TV when that happens.)

But I did something with this film last night that I rarely do:  I read a review from Mr. Ebert before writing my own.  I prefer to write a review and then read ""professional"" reviews, so that I don't plagiarize, while I simultaneously (hopefully) remain objective.  But I was saddened a bit that Mr. Ebert didn't like this film when it first released, and personally, I think that he took it too seriously, although he does argue logically about film structure and how it's broken here.  But this is NOT a film to be taken seriously, in any way.

Comedies such as this are meant strictly for entertainment purposes only, in my opinion.  I laughed pretty hard the first time I watched it, and I laughed pretty hard still last night on my last viewing.  Dan Akroyd provides true comic relief, and sure, while he wasn't as funny as, say, Jim Carrey is nowadays (or at least before Mr. Carrey decided to publicly rip the movies in which he stars, such as ""Kick A** 2), Mr. Akroyd surely was a precursor to that type of insanity.

And the scene with Charles Grodin, when he is eating breakfast, trying to get some ""alone time,"" is hilarious.  His mannerisms are spot on when he tries to ignore the conversation of the other psychiatrist, at least until he realizes that he's been duped.  He wakes up in a hurry after that.

You can't beat HD widescreen.  And it's hard to beat this film, as long as you realize that it's strictly comedy.  Too bad that, sometimes, even great critics forget this second part.  Maybe Mr. Ebert is screening this film again in the Afterlife, and is changing his opinion?",1406592000,,2739,4.365612648221344

1829506,5,B00008972U,"Like so many others here, I came in on the middle of this movie while it played on commercial filled broadcast television. I researched it on Amazon and ordered it.
This film is beyond funny. And yes, it is underrated. Michael Ritchie deftly directs. Walter Matthau is Walter Matthau. And Dan Aykroyd is out of this world. The take on LA radio before the pompous bloviators from the syndicate ruled is very insightful too.",1397174400,,422,4.716216216216216
1829507,5,B00008972U,"Had seen this years ago but forgotten it. It is a hoot! Bought it because we love Walter Matthau movies. Matthau is good but Ackroyd as an escaped mental patient posing as a radio psychiatrist is just hilarious! Charles Grodin does his usual deadpan shtick as the radio psychiatrist, having a breakdown, that Ackroyd replaces and he also is wonderful, funny, another hoot! A great comedy. The one caveat I would add is that it does have some sexual references in it which might be offensive to some, but they do not pervade the movie as they do in so many films made today.",1377475200,2,573,4.519230769230769

1829512,5,B00008972U,"I hadn't seen this movie in years, and it was great fun to revisit it. I laughed just as much now as I did the first time I saw it.

Dan Akroyd plays John Burns, a convict who got out of prison by pretending to be crazy and going to a mental institution instead. He pretty much runs the place except that the head psychiatrist Dr. Lawrence Baird (David Clennon) insists that he has finally gone too far and he's sending him back to prison. While waiting in a straightjacket in Dr. Baird's office for him to sign the transfer papers, a call comes for him to replace a rich radio psychiatrist, Dr. George Maitlin (Charles Grodin) while Dr. Maitlin is suffering from a nervous breakdown. The show then takes off from there as Burns/Akroyd escapes from the mental institution and impersonates Dr. Baird.

This is a perfect example of comedy that is weird and far-fetched, but works because of great comic acting by all the main actors. Besides Akroyd there is the fantastic Walter Matthau as a con man who forces Akroyd to pull him in on his scam and Charles Grodin as Dr. Maitlin. (By the way, Grodin is also wonderful in another similarly plotted movie where Jim Belushi takes over his life,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taking-Care-of-Business/dp/B00005T7HC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taking Care of Business</a>&nbsp;from 1990.) I highly recommend it for anyone who needs a laugh and wants to watch a movie made by people who know how to do comedy right.",1310256000,,1500,5.044354838709677
1829513,5,B00008972U,"This is one of the funniest movies that I've ever seen! Dan Akroyd is wonderful as the mental patient turned psychiatrist, and Walter Mattheau as his sidekick, the crazy priest, is absolutely hysterical. Donna Dixon as the psychiatrist friend of Dan Akroyd is ravishingly gorgeous. Even Charles Grodin, who's usually too glib for my taste, does a great job as the burned out psychiatrist. This movies has many wacky appearances by other Saturday Night alumni. If you'd like to lift up your spirits, laugh a lot, and put a big smile on your face then this movie is for you.",1269043200,2,572,4.73
1829533,2,B00008972U,"If you're into foul language and boredom, this is the film for you.  Geared for the 13-year-old male, this lame duck tries to shock as well as amuse.  It's all so dreadfully dull.  My copy goes into the waste bin.  Chalk up another stinker for Dan Aykroyd.  Did Walter Mathau need the money?",1263513600,,291,4.415094339622642
1829534,3,B00008972U,"In THE COUCH TRIP, a con-artist imprisoned at a Chicago psychiatric facility flim-flams his way out of jail, onto a radio talk show and into a small fortune.

Career felon John Burns (Aykroyd) has avoided ""hard time"" by feigning mental illness. The easy ride will soon be over though, for Dr. Lawrence Baird (Clennon) plans to certify Burns as sane and ship him back to the ""pen.""  In Baird's absence, Burns takes a phone call in the shrink's office. It's from George Maitlin, a successful Beverly Hills psychiatrist and talk show host. Maitlin, who's much in need of a sabbatical, offers a man he believes to be Baird an opportunity to sub for him on the radio show, handle his practice for a few months and earn a large sum of cash.

Burns orchestrates an escape from the looney bin. Disguised as Dr. Baird, he heads to California where he immediately encounters Donald Becker (Matthau), a fellow con artist pretending to be a street preacher. Becker easily ""reads"" Burns and he blackmails his way into the sweet deal. Meanwhile, Drs. Maitlin and Baird accidentally meet at a European psychiatric seminar. Together, they fly home to find out who has usurped Baird's identity and taken (under false pretenses) Maitlin's $200,000.

They've been cosmically attached to young businessman Thomas (Robert Downey Jr.) ever since his 1959 birth and their simultaneous deaths in a bus crash. Thomas is the key to their escape from Earth, so his angels make themselves visible to him.

1829535,4,B00008972U,"This is a funny movie that had me chuckling along with it most of the way.  Walter Matheau seemed a little superfluous until the end of the movie however (hard to believe as a crazy man).  Grodin was dry, wry and hilarious - until he went over the top in the end.  And Dan Akroyd did a great job.  One of his best I'd have to say.  A fun little movie that entertains.",1199145600,,367,3.9726027397260273

Night Live & never followed Dan A.'s career, etc., but here, in this comedy flick, the guy is just about perfect in the role and as hilarious as they come. What I love about his take on the part is that he plays it straight, poker-faced all the way--and never, ever DELIBERATELY goes for laughs--and it had me in stitches the entire time.

Re: supporting cast: from the gorgeous Donna Dixon to the always solid Walter Mathau (and everyone else in this terrific comedy) give Mr. Aykroyd the support he needs.",1182643200,2,531,4.474226804123711

1829538,5,B00008972U,"It's an eighties gem, so overlooked and STILL FUNNY. I have been waiting for this DVD for years now (along with ""Club Paradise"" and ""Ice Pirates"" -still waiting 08/04).

It is hysterical in some parts, and it will stand the test of time. Admittedly, I loved this movie when I saw it (in the 80's), and am still biased. But there are at least 10 belly laugh scenes, all priceless and unique. Tons of things that Akroyd never did ""in every other 80's flick"" as one reviewer suggested. And yes, it is not a slickly, year 2000+ produced movie that will entrance you for every moment, there is a slow scene or two, but still so worth a viewing. If you missed it then, now's your chance. I put my personal garauntee that you will laugh at least five times really hard (unless you are under age 18). Enjoy",1092614400,14,798,4.355704697986577

1829541,4,B00008972U,"Dan Akroyd's comedy movie career has been anything but consistent.  He seems to tackle as many bad roles (My Stepmother Is An Alien) as he does great (Neighbors).  I'm going to go on record and say that this is his best work since his SNL stint and his Belushi film pairings.  Yes, it's totally stupid.  Yes, it's one of those late 80's ""switched identity"" movies that every studio made, and it's got Donna Dixon - one of the worst actors on earth.  But, it's one of those movies that requires many viewings because it's just that good.  A funny story, a great score, and a hilarious Chevy Chase cameo.  The only disappointment with this coming to DVD is that it lacks any features.  Well, at least MGM brought it to DVD.  Highly recommended.",1043107200,15,742,4.518796992481203
1829542,5,B00008972U,"THE COUCH TRIP is a movie with a far-fetched plot, with an Aykroyd ego-trip, but with great support. ""I did not realize,"" my wife said, ""that Dan Aykroyd only plays one role in every film, the supercilious social misfit who is going to be in trouble when he has to quit acting like a teen-ager."" Having said that, my wife, who points out matters like acting ability; she said and I agree that the support of Walter Matthau and Charles Grodin kept this feature on the funny track. The far-fetched plot has one of those incredible twists that you simply can't resist; the mental patient who out-psychs the Psychiatrists. But, thanks to Director Michael Ritchie it is a well managed far-fetched plot. It was performed as well as that other Aykroyd film with a weird plot, ""Trading Places.""
