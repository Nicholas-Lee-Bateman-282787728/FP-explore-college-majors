8372004,4,6304061919,"This movie was not fantastic, but the fight scenes were excellent.  The comedy was not needed in this movie.  The star of the film, Cliff Lok, did his best to make up for the boring plot line.  If it wasn't for Wilson Tong  doing the fight directing and movie directing, it wouldn't probably be the  big hit that it was.  This is definitely one to add to your collection, for  the fight scenes are superior, especially the ones with Wilson Tong and Li  Hai Sheng in them.  Maybe not a genius movie, but not a bad idea!!",935539200,,519,4.268041237113402
