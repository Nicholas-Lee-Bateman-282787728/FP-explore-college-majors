7813423,4,6301648587,"Trotting out a solid cast of second stringers, RIFFRAFF impacts your senses as an entertaining potboiler, produced by RKO, released in 1947. Pat O'Brien, not exactly aging gracefully, is the lead, playing the tough-talking private investigator, Dan Hammer, him what's the sole operator of Zenith Services. He hangs his shingle in Panama, an exotic place in which he's viewed by the community as sort of the local Mr. Fix-It. Hammer is incredibly networked. He knows everyone in Panama, seems like.

RIFFRAFF integrates certain flourishes that lend color to our guy, Hammer. There's that scruffy dog perenially parked in front of his office door. He exercises the services of an elderly driver he calls ""Pops"" (Percy Kilbride), and the laconic Pops has this routine for starting the car which makes you wonder if he'll ever start the car. There's some amusing back-and-forth between Kilbride and O'Brien that flesh out both characters some.

The film opens on a dark, stormy night and with an airplane flight from Peru to Panama during which not all the passengers survive. In Panama, one of the passengers, carrying a briefcase he may or may not have honestly come by, calls on Dan Hammer, offering him $100 for bodyguard duty. Not too much later Dan is contracted for $5000 to unearth a missing map that pinpoints the location of 27 unknown wildcat oil wells in Peru. Is it a farfetched notion that Hammer's two cases are linked? How does that lovely nightclub chanteuse (Anne Jeffreys) figure into the puzzle? Is she sweetheart material or some femme fatale to be discarded expeditiously? And how much does Panama's Secret Police know? How deadly is that soft-spoken fat man (Walter Slezak, doing his best Sydney Greenstreet) who gets his jollies from sketching the streetscape while his henchmen vigorously beat up on a fella? Everyone seems to think Dan Hammer has the map. And, you know what, he does. The movie audience is made aware of this early on. It's right there in front of his eyes. I guess Hammer never read Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Purloined Letter.""

In case you were wondering, yes, there's also a film in 1936 titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Riffraff/dp/B0065K4DES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Riffraff</a>&nbsp;which starred Spencer Tracy and Jean Harlow. Speaking of Tracy, O'Brien could've gone a couple of rounds with Tracy's one-armed war veteran from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bad-Day-at-Black-Rock/dp/B0007TKNH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bad Day at Black Rock</a>. They're probably evenly matched in old man ruggedness. O'Brien shows off his two-fisted style in the film's climactic brawl in which his workplace gets destroyed. Anne Jeffreys sings a song and looks marvelous, although you question her motives. Walter Slezak transmits a creepy undercurrent. Pat O'Brien pushes his considerable weight around and is amused by his driver and eventually cracks the case. RIFFRAFF moves fast and is tough and lean like its protagonist, except that our guy isn't lean. What's not to like?",1373241600,,3105,5.532631578947369
7813424,5,6301648587,"This tough, tropical film set in Panama and starring Pat O'Brien and pretty Anne Jeffreys was the kind of medium budget entertainment RKO did better than any other studio. There are no really big stars, but a better than average original screenplay by Martin Rackin, fine atmosphere enhanced by George E. Diskant's photography and Roy Webb's good score make it grade ""A"" entertainment, even if it is just a big budget ""B"" film.

Carole Lombard's favorite cinematographer, Ted Tetzlaff, directs this one and keeps it moving at a snappy, no-nonsense pace. Pat O'Brien never had the big star looks or charisma to carry ""A"" films by himself, but was terrific in a long list of medium budget films such as this during the 1940's. Here he is Dan Hammer, the guy to go to if you're in trouble or need something fixed.

When a plane takes off for Panama with two passengers and arrives with only one, that man hires Hammer for protection. It isn't long before he ends up dead, of course, and a map to some oil wells in Peru worth millions are at the center of it all. Soon everyone wants Hammer to find the map for them, except a sleazy gangster named Molinar (Walter Slezak) who believes Hammer already has it and lets his thugs loose on him to get it.

No film like this is complete, however, without a love interest, and Anne Jeffrey's Maxine fills out more than just the bill quite nicely. This one is fun to watch if you don't think too hard about it. The map turns up right under Hammer's nose during a fight scene where Jeffrey's helps by hanging all over Molinar's back! It all gets wrapped up nicely with Hammer still on the square with his cop pal and singer Jeffreys by his side.

A solid supporting cast that includes Percy Kilbride as Hammer's taxi driver and right hand make this one a good bet for a Sunday morning if you're a fan of this type fof film.",1174176000,,1860,4.461764705882353
7813425,4,6301648587,"Pat O'Brien plays a weary but slick detective in Panama, cutting through deception and dodging death while he tries to locate a map of rich oil fields. That's as much story as there is, and if left in Monogram's hands, this film may have been nothing special. But this was made by RKO and directed by Ted Tetzlaff, who brings a grand eye to the proceedings.
Tetzlaff lensed Hitchcock's Notorious, and this is a similarly crafted piece, with good, conspicuous, yet never intrusive direction. Tetzlaff employs well-designed scene transitions, compositions, tracking shots, and the like. In fact, I found the famed silent opening to be the *least* interesting part of the movie.
As with most RKO products of this era, some nifty dialogue is dispersed throughout, although the movie as a whole perks up considerably when the delightful and beautiful Jeffreys is on screen, especially in the wisecracking department. I had not discovered her before this, but she has a grabbing presence, in the type of role more often played by Jane Greer or Ann Sheridan.
O'Brien as our hero is not exactly possessed of a superhero's build, mind or morals, but that works in the context of the story. He's a very human character who is supremely comfortable in these limited surroundings and perhaps nowhere else, although the movie doesn't reveal much background about his Dan Hammer persona. BTW, you've gotta love that hackneyed (Dan Turner, Mike Hammer) PI name! Although I do not think any other self-respecting hard-boiled PI would be caught dead in the fuzzy fedora Pat wears here.
For comic relief there is nice old coot Percy Kilbride as Pat's driver/ sidekick/ boss/ pal/father figure. And if all those words seem to contradict each other, you're right. They do. One funny scene has him entertain Jeffreys in his broken-down cab, which he says also functions as Hammer's waiting room.
Walter Slezak is effective as a wannabe Greenstreet. His part starts out bland but gets more interesting later in the film, benefiting from some framing devices designed to portray him as a cinema grotesque, and as his methods become more brutal.
Handsome but weaselly RKO regular Jerome Cowan is fine in what is basically a throwaway role.
This movie is hurt slightly by the fact that the map everyone seeks was hidden where it was, a place I will not reveal here. But the audience finds out early on, and it lends a slight air of ""Oh, come on!"" to the whole affair. I know, hiding the great whatsit in plain sight is the best place sometimes, but from its location this particular mcguffin practically tweaked everyone seeking it right on the smeller. There's a good fight over the map near the end, though, so I'm mostly forgiving.
Digressions and miniscule complaints aside, I recommend this along with just about any other RKO movie from the 40's that you can find (which ain't always easy, friend).",1030060800,7,2879,4.889570552147239
