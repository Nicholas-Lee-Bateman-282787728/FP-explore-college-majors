8639213,5,B00I4DLV8A,"I loved this film. It manages to avoid cliche, but not to the point of makings its characters and situations unrelatable (after all, cliches are cliches because they're based in some shared truth). Overall, this is a great example of indie filmmaking, and how a good story can triumph a budget that is tiny by Hollywood standards.

Also, the DVD arrived well-packaged and on time.",1397520000,,380,4.846153846153846
8639214,3,B00I4DLV8A,Was an okay watch.  Plot felt forced in some points to move the story forward. Story itself was decent enough.,1396396800,,110,4.5
8639215,5,B00I4DLV8A,"Although this study of sibling relationships after the death of their father is not light entertainment, it is beautifully acted, written, and directed, and I find myself considering its messages weeks after viewing. Recommended.",1394582400,,229,5.764705882352941
8639216,5,B00I4DLV8A,Well done.  The story was entertaining and quite realistic.  There were deep concepts.  The acting was superb. There were only a handful of actors but you felt like you really got to know the characters.,1391817600,,203,4.742857142857143
8639217,4,B00I4DLV8A,"For me this film captured real human emotions.  The characters not only had to deal with their feelings toward one another, but also those that they had toward their emotionally distant father whom in their own way loved and missed.  The film encompasses the feelings that all siblings have toward one another, a certain amount of jealously toward one another, the feelings toward a father who was distant after their mother passed on, and the emotions and feelings of the middle child who basically gave up his life to take care of the father while the brother and sister went off to follow their dreams.

This movie was dead on the reality of the workings of a dysfunctional family, the rivalry between siblings, and the feeling of the child whom is left the full responsibility of caring for a parent.

I think everyone should watch this movie.  It will stir emotions within yourself, bring tears to your eyes, make you laugh, and make you re-evaluate your relationship with your family.  Michelle",1391817600,,1000,4.818713450292398
