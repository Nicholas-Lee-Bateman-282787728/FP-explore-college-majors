8290274,4,B001CWSUW0,I bought this DVD to learn crochet.  It is very useful.  Videos are east to understand.  Would buy this as a gift.  Very happy with the purchase.,1260403200,,145,4.2592592592592595
8290275,1,B001CWSUW0,"This is not a good product.  The ""teacher"" is not at a level to be able to teach.  She doesn't have a professional technique and if I didn't already know enough about crochet, I would not be interested in learning crochet since the end product looks so amateurish.  Not worth the price.",1239667200,,286,4.461538461538462
