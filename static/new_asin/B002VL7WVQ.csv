Romantic Comedies are different to Relationship Comedies- a RomCom (as they are referred to by way of a shortcut definition) usually stars Jenifer Aniston, has an irritating 'will they, won't they' plotline and will appeal to females between 15 -30 with a shoe and handbag obsession. The intelligent relationship comedy is a rare thing and was a predominant element of Woody Allen's early work (Manhattan/Love & Death/Annie Hall/Play it Again, Sam). These are usually acutely observational, honest, bristle with raw and emotional dialogue and can be enjoyed by both sexes. Films that would come under this remit include Chasing Amy, Swingers, and the King of all - When Harry Met Sally. They can be and often are difficult to watch for their ability to mirror the emotional truths of relationship situations, the introspections and yearnings.

Someone Else  belongs in this category - the amazing characteristic of being British yet with the sophistication of a New York based piece makes it all the more unique and wonderful. The writer obviously knows his historical and contextual onions, giving us Brits an addition to this genre we can be proud of. It isn't really like us at all to be this on the money. The Brits aren't used to this kind of thing: we did OK with the drama 'Cold Feet' - an enjoyable trip into the lives and angst of three thirtysomething couples facing the attendant crisis of approaching young middle age. The reality is that we do social discomfort and class distinctions far better as both run through the fabric of our national psyche and social mores. The ability of Richard Curtis to press the buttons to appeal to both US and UK audience by digging deep into the arena of acceptable clich is now rather tired. Generally speaking we accept the Americans are better at this kind of thing - that is in the time before the arena was swamped with trite star crossed lovers' storylines and cutesy pets.

Arguably the relationship comedy in the US aimed at the slacker audience and generation as opposed to the mainstream woman of a certain age, has been the best in genre since Allen, until this little known of gem, that is.

Someone Else has a very good cast to move the story which is essentially centred on David with Green Wing's Stephen Mangan as the lead role. He is simply magnificent as the guy who doesn't know what he has got until he loses it. There isn't really a plot as such, the film swings merrily along making observations on happiness in relationships, its elusiveness and impossibility, and to some, implausibility. 'Relationships are about moments' says Michael, David's unhappily married friend , who we discover later is henpecked and is really selling this idea to justify the lack of passion in  his own backyard. There is an irritant in the form of Nina, the girl David pines for and loses his head and woman for - the actress playing this part Lara Belmont, does a great job of making us hate her flakiness. Lisa is the woman (played by the excellent stalwart distinctive British actress Susan Lynch) who David leaves and then misses. The story here is similar to Husbands and Wives - the brilliant Allen film marked by the characteristic of wanting something, or someone else after they have moved on. Susan has started putting herself out there via dating agencies, David learning things he never knew about her via a trip there himself, such as what constitutes an ideal Saturday or whom she would like to be in another life - Amy Johnson is a well observed choice for a woman with adventure and bravery in her soul.
There are some cracking moments - the couple that have been married 75 years are just excruciatingly fantastic and deliver the best open and bitter argument put to film. The Freddy Mercury like guy who David photographs is lovely, and the kids of his friend Michael are very good with women and with dialogue. The best of the support though is John Henshaw, who acts as a kind of Fool (using here the Lear reference) in seeming the maddest of the lot but is the most grounded and the best candidate for ultimate happiness. His male friends act as chorus to his angst and the whole lot owes a lot to classical writing - again, the writer knows his stuff. A great series of shots at the end is a telling record of which of them is the most, or least happy with 'Want you back for good' sung by solo artist as opposed to the Take That version which is a very apt piece to choose for the sequence.
As films go, this is the best to show London since Layer Cake. The views and scenery over Primrose Hill are the best in the city, aside from that is the view over the Southbank overlooking St Pauls - which film makers should use more. The real sense of what it is like inside a London bar, not the US version is given us, as is a slice of London life which is very convincing: blue and white collar mix with boredom, yearning for what we cannot have and the grass is always greener approach to thinking matching a lot of what goes on in the thirty something heads of city life. It beats Bridget Jones over the head with a hammer at honesty and truth.

The extra little film in the Special Features gives us a Keira Knightley playing a single woman at a party on New Year's Eve that claims to have telepathic powers - a not far distant character to the woman David picks up at his mates party, these are the sorts of women the guys in Peep Show would date and be obsessed with for five minutes. The cab driver is a cousin of the character played by John Henshaw in the main feature and here, like with 'Someone Else' Col Spector , (who is a documentary film maker and expert thereof), has the social graces of London mingling bang on. This film is an absolute essential for an American audience that think Bridget Jones Diary or Love Actually represents the Brits in pursuit of love. Buy it folks, today, watch it and then talk about it at your dinner parties.

8382291,3,B002VL7WVQ,"I loved the storyline. It explored relationships, decisions, whether to chase the excitement and passion or work on a tried and true relationship... I thought it was a great story. Unfortunately, the audio was horrible, and the voices kept echoing. It was really hard to hear, and it took away from the viewing experience. I wish they would remaster the audio and re-release because I think that the story is worth it.",1512172800,,418,4.819444444444445

8382295,5,B002VL7WVQ,"Surprisingly very good movie. I would say it's for 30+. Tells about love, relationship and fear of loneliness, no intrigues here, story line is smooth and ironically-sad.
