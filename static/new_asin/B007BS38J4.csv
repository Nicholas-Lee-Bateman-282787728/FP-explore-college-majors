5074282,1,B007BS38J4,Absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen.  So bad I had to return it.  Bad acting.  Bad FX.  Bad directing.  Bad script.  Did I leave anything out?  DO NOT waste your money or time unless you like wasting money and time.,1341014400,2,221,4.2439024390243905
5074283,1,B007BS38J4,"It amazes me that The Asylum still puts out the bad movies they do. You would think that by now, they would at least TRY once or twice a year. If you're gonna make a knock off of a big budget movie, maybe you get a real FX team once in a while. This time out they decided to rip off Battleship and not only is THIS movie bad from start to finish, it's rather insulting to anyone who ever served on the USS Iowa! The aliens in this were ridiculous as were their attempt at FX --- and Mario Van Peeples was totally wasted in it. The rest of the cast though, were attrocious! Thank goodness I saw this for free on Syfy Channel, because even renting this turkey would be a waste of good money! As for everyone saying this was better than Battleship, perhaps they need to go see Battleship again. Whereas Battleship was action packed and IMO quite entertaining, American Warships was just terrible!",1339718400,3,893,4.321428571428571

Went well with a big bowl of popcorn and memories of being at sea. The shots of the Iowa class Battleship were great. Post Scrip information I did not know about so watch to the end.

5074285,1,B007BS38J4,"I have heard of low budget films, but I could have paid for this movie out of one paycheck.  Godzilla of the 50's and 60's was more believable and creatinve than this movie.",1338508800,2,173,4.242424242424242
5074286,4,B007BS38J4,"This film is an Asylum mock-buster of the film ""Battleship"" and addresses some of the issues of that film, such as how does a Battleship welded to a pier suddenly has fuel and weapons? In this film the Enterprise (and task force) is up against an enemy with a cloaking device and the enemy has to become visible to fire its weapons. Where have we seen this before? We suspect the Chinese are involved. Now as any Trekkie knows the Romulans (not to be confused with Romney supporters) had such a device. Trekkies also know that the Romulans represented the Chinese. I love these movie tie-ins. Plus 1 star for a Star Trek tie-in.

What this film lacks, that ""Battleship"" possessed is a killer sound track, witty dialouge, and likeable characters. The USS Iowa is undergoing a world tour as a museum piece when the attacks occur. All solid state electronics are fried, so it is up to old technology and SEAL Team 6, who happens to be on board to save the planet. Mario Van Peebles is the captain of The Big Stick and has a love interest in Lt. Caroline Bradley (Johanna Watts) which is not fully developed. Carl Weathers (Apollo Creed) has a small role as General McKraken. David Polinsky starts out the film as a 4 star admiral and by the end of the film he is a three star admiral. Asylum normally confounds their naval ranking insignias. Not as good as ""Battleship."" The special CG effects are still Asylum grade, especially the fake looking fire on the deck of the ship.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Kid safe. 4 stars on the Asylum scale.",1338076800,3,1540,4.516129032258065
5074287,1,B007BS38J4,"This movie (if it can be called that), is absolutely terrible... even with the foreknowledge that it is an intentionally cheap rip-off of the big budget movie 'Battleship' which is failing in American theaters as I write this.

I thought I might enjoy American Warship as a low budget comical contrast to the awful very-nearly un-watchable $200 million utter-nonsense that Hasbro's Battleship turned out to be, and then was surprised that this film was so much worse, SO much worse, that I regret the time I spent in viewing it.

American Warship's story is slightly different, but exactly as bad as Battleship the movie IMO, so I can't really fault it in that department -- I got what I expected.

But the acting and writing/dialogue was orders of magnitude worse than it's big budget counterpart to the point that I was cringing through most scenes and felt sorry for the actors who were forced to say terrible lines.

The effects were HORRENDOUSLY bad, and inexplicably inconsistent as the FX companies who worked on this obviously had access to the correct CGI models to use, but got the planes mixed up from shot to shot.  Sometimes there were air force planes on the carrier instead of navy planes.  Sometimes in aerial combat a two engine plane would switch to a single engine and then back from shot to shot as if nobody would notice.

All the CGI was terribly lit and textured anyway, the CGI particle splash and explosion effects were awful and also heavily reused so you'd see the same bad splash effect over and over as you watched the movie.  Since probably little to no money was spent on these effects, one wonders why not make a few more different versions for use in the film.
The CWIZ Gatling guns had fake looking flames composited over the barrels while the barrels did not spin, to pretend they were shooting.
All the debris was painted sheets of Styrofoam, and when they fell on the actors and they had to pretend to be trapped under it... just so hard to watch.  This is just a sampling of how bad both the CGI and practical effects were.

I was expecting a bad film, prepared to enjoy a cheezy bad film, but was shocked at how much worse it actually was to the point of not being able to enjoy it.

There are no redeeming qualities to this film, watch it at your own peril and loss of an hour and a half of your life when you could have been watching something else.",1338076800,6,2390,4.522041763341067

No plot spoilers from me; the movie follows the crew of USS Iowa (Captained by Mario Van Peebles) as it heads to be decommissioned, but strange events and unprovoked attacks by a powerful enemy interrupt the retirement plans. This is slightly better acted than most Asylum films, but the special effects were weak all the way through and the editing was often disjointed, with distracting continuity errors all the way through.

This is a low budget Sci-Fi that I will not likely seek out to watch again.

or at least wrestles it to a draw.

Of course the victory doesn't come through special effects, soundtrack, or star power, as plenty of other reviewers have noted, but rather in the area of acting and plot.

Though it might be stretching things to use the term ""plausible"" when talking about battleship versus space aliens, the plot of American Warships (according to the ""making of"" featurette originally titled ""American Battleship"", presumably changed under threat of lawsuit) struck me as by far the more plausible:

SPOILER ALERT!

Sneaky space aliens equipped with EMP weapons and cloaking devices attempt to trick USA and China into World War III by launching attacks against both sides beginning in the area of the Korean Theater but are foiled by USS Iowa's pre-integrated-circuits systems, her captain's (Mario Van Peebles') dogged,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Enemy-Below/dp/B0001NBMH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Enemy Below</a>&nbsp;like pursuit of an enemy he can neither see nor otherwise detect except by wake or physical touch, and the stubborn, relentless determination of her outmatched but unwilling to admit it crew, including a Seal Team OTHER THAN 6 with something to prove and a surprisingly enthusiastic (and very helpful) civilian volunteer.

END SPOILER ALERT!

Second, a couple of thoroughly professional veteran actors, Mario Van Peebles and Carl Weathers, anchor a cast of less-well-knowns, with solid, somewhat underacted performances that precisely for that reason are more realistic than the histrionics Hollywood usually prefers in military servicemen roles.

In short, if you find the question of just how one would deal with such a problem intriguing, chances are you will find this the more interesting film.  Have the filmmakers swiped some ideas from old Star Trek episodes?  Almost certainly, but that turns out to be a better place to steal movie ideas from than a militarily unrealistic if strategic thinking teaching and downright fun old classic of a board game:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battleship/dp/B004XV2U2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battleship</a>.",1341619200,,2636,6.236914600550964

8514067,4,B007BS38J4,"This film was most likely put together very quickly, basically as a salute to the USS IOWA as it was being moved to it's final location.  So yes, it is a second rate movie.  What is important is the historical aspect of the final move of the USS IOWA, which is now a museum.  Go see the battleship.  The USS Missouri is in Hawaii, but the Iowa is in Los Angeles a little more accessible to most of the country.  Both Battleships are a great part of US history.  I kinda liked the nostaglic presentation.  Who cares if it wasn't a perfect movie.",1502409600,,544,4.223300970873787
