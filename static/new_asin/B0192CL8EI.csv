8743553,5,B0192CL8EI,"This wonderful film was inspired by the book of the same title. It's an account of the Nicaraguan revolution from the point of view of the famous writer Omar Cabezas, who went to the mountains to join the guerrilla and found himself camping out in a wet forest with a little group more symbolic than effective. It includes oral accounts of the Somoza's regime's many abuses (going soft on gruesome footage) and the war of attrition waged by the US-sponsored Contras. It closes after several interviews with Sandinista revolutionary leaders describing how they were flummoxed at their own victory and the task of actually governing the country, particularly facing the hostile hegemon in the north. Written from this perspective, there's no point in criticizing this film or the book for ""bias"": it's openly an account from one point of view.  But with a refreshing down-to-earth voice-over (in English) including translated passages from the book by Cabezas, Fire From the Mountain can offer audiences at many levels some fresh insight into the idealism of leftist guerrilla movements of the 1970s and the bloody mess that resulted from Cold War efforts to crush them. For some viewers it may be a bit nostalgic, too, as after this film was made, the Sandinista party fell into all-too-classic problems that face most victorious revolutionary movements and the heady days of victory were permanently tarnished both inside and outside the country, all the more heart-wrenching given the outcome -- the crime, poverty and general mess Central America suffers today. But the film remains a classic from the period, a poignant reminder of a half-forgotten yet pivotal era in Central America, and, not least, a great teaching tool.",1483660800,,1726,5.120567375886525
