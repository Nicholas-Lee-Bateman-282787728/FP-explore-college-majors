3764734,5,B001QFF15M,"If you REALLY wanna see Little Richard at his fabulous best, seek out a DVD-R of a 1973 movie skillfully directed by Robert Able called LET THE GOOD TIMES ROLL.  20th Century Fox has stupidly never released it to video, but VH1 aired it in the 90s with a good re-mixed stereo soundtrack and some people recorded it and can provide a DVD-R.  Google the title and some providers will pop up.  The film also features other great rock acts from the 50s and early 60s, including Chubby Checker, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, The Five Satins, Fats Domino, The Coasters, and some others.  Influenced by the WOODSTOCK movie, it uses multiple screens even more effectively.  There's also some great montage sequences of 50s imagery as well.  A great film and Little Richard's BEST performance captured on film !  (Fox, are you listening?)",1325203200,7,824,4.76056338028169

3764736,5,B001QFF15M,"With out doubt the true king of rock n roll,the sad part being there is so little material that was recorded of this great man preforming in his prime,apart from this little short gem. Saw him in Myrtle Beach last month, still holds a crowd at 76, his band is the best I have heard also.",1256860800,4,287,4.142857142857143
3764737,5,B001QFF15M,"Saw him just a month or so ago and he came out in a wheelchair and considerable pain and clearly on some meds... but kicked some rock and roll butt.....I love him and altho the audio on this dvd is not that great and the camera work was questionable....you could see Richard at the top of his game and he was on fire. 5 stars for performance, stage presence.. musical integrity and overall greatness.

So altho the production was not that great....it is a viable historical document.",1246579200,10,483,4.551724137931035
3764738,2,B001QFF15M,"Little Richard had something to prove at the Toronto Peace Festival in 1969 ($14.98; Shout). His last Top 40 hit was more than a decade earlier and he would never have another. But Richard was always convinced of his own fabulousness and knew the world should be convinced of it too. And he ripped the crowd into a frenzy during his half hour set, thanks to timeless classics like ""Lucille"" and ""Long Tall Sally"" -- not to mention a shirt adorned with tiny mirrors and a towering wig. DA Pennebaker captures the moment well, though the sound leaves something to be desired and at 30 minutes this is awfully short. Why not give us three hours of the day-long festival, of which this could be a highlight? On its own, it's just not enough. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com.",1245369600,7,771,4.514285714285714

3764741,2,B001QFF15M,"Sadly Chuck seems to have thought he must court a new audience with a loss of innocence that ruins his songs. I think he underestimated his own achievements. He strains to sing them and ends up shouting them, such a shame!",1373155200,,222,4.439024390243903
3764742,3,B001QFF15M,"Disclosure: I am a Chuck Berry Fan, a big one too, so you may want to scrap off half a star. Now, on with the review.
On the good side, we have Chuck Berry performing at his best. His showmanship is all over the place, he gives the audience all his trademark tricks (duckwalk, guitar solo split, etc.) and displays all his guitar playing talent. He makes the young 60s hippie crowd absolutely fall in love with him and he is fun, witty and really engaged. Also, he genuinely looks like he is having a lot of fun. The other thing on the good side is that the video quality is great, surprisingly, considering the original tapes are from 1969, and the takes are superb. Even for a layman like me, at least when it comes to filmmaking appreciation, it is evident that the director and his crew did a great (visual) job. This is where the DVD gets its three stars.
On the bad side, audio quality is absolutely disappointing...to say the least. For almost all of the performance you can practically hear only Chuck Berry's guitar. You do get some on and off or very low volume drums, just about no bass and bits of the backing guitar (at least you get that kid's short guitar solo). When people buy a music DVD, I know at least when I do, they expect two things: audio and video quality. Here you can only expect the second one.
Only two things about the band, since we all know about Berry's unfortunate habit of pickup bands. The kids are having a blast, which probably influences Berry's mood that day, but they are really struggling to keep up with the master.",1372291200,5,1559,4.397923875432526
3764743,5,B001QFF15M,He loves it.  But wanted to get the DVD Movie.  But only DVD Movie was $35+.  Wish Movie was cheaper,1367193600,,100,3.9
3764744,5,B001QFF15M,Not a lot of Chuck Berry DVDs out there like this. Really enjoyed how this concert displayed his one-of-a-kind talent. Can watch again and again,1358380800,4,144,4.8
3764745,4,B001QFF15M,"Concert footage of Chuck Berry in his prime is extremely rare, making this cool little concert film a great find for any lover of 50's and 60's rock n' roll. Shot only a month after Woodstock in September 1969, this historic performance from Toronto Canada's Rock n' roll Revival show looks and feels like a smaller version of Woodstock with Chuck playing for a young hippie crowd on an outdoor stage. There were several other rock n' roll legends at this festival, and Berry's 45 minute set is captured well on camera by filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker. Vivid shots of the young audience smiling and dancing to the music are shown throughout the entire show. Chuck delivers an energetic, flamboyant performance of his classic hits with his guitar work and showmanship on full display, duck walk and all. Considering this footage was shot 45 years ago, the sound quality and camera work are suprisingly good. Rock n' roll history lovers should treasure this DVD.

The only thing keeping this from a five star rating is Chuck's amatuer backing band: three teenagers likely chosen on a spur of the moment basis who come off like a sloppy band at an open mic night. The drummer, who looks 18 or 19, fails to lay down a solid beat for most of the show and the bassist is barely audible, although the other guitarist manages to hold the rhythm behind Chuck's lead guitar. With a seasoned, professional backing band this show could have been spectacular, but Chuck is well known for the unfortunate practice of having local players back him wherever he performs. Chuck Berry was obviously not the latest rage on the charts in 1969, and it is interesting to see an audience of hippie kids enjoying Berry's performance so much. The closing performance of ""Johnny B. Good"" has Chuck commanding every inch of the stage as he rocks the guitar for the massive young crowd.

Taylor Hackford's 1987 documentary ""Hail Hail Rock n' Roll"" is still the ultimate Berry DVD available, but this raw 1969 performance is a real treat for anybody who wants to experience the father of rock n' roll at the peak of his performing powers.  If pure 50's rock is your thing, get a copy of this along with two other ESSENTIAL concert videos, Roy Orbison's Black and White Night, and Carl Perkins' awesome ""Rockabilly Session"" from 1985 featuring great performances by Eric Clapton, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr.",1358294400,,2379,4.78345498783455
3764746,5,B001QFF15M,"Yes the self-proclaimed King of Rock and Roll, who shares this title with Elvis and Chuck Berry, turned in a performance of a lifetime not doubt inspired by the fact that John Lennon and Eric Clapton were about to follow him on stage. truth be told ...he smoked them and everyone else on the bill that day.  Nuff said.",1358035200,3,318,4.389830508474576
3764747,5,B001QFF15M,"No doubt this was one of Chuck's greatest shows ever. Inspired by the lineup that day that included jerry lee Lewis, gene Vincent, Little Richard, and The Doors as well as a surprise appearance by John Lennon with Eric Clapton...Chuck rocks out the 20,000 fans in true berry style. My Ding A Ling has the crowd on their feet and singing along to a song most of the young fans had never heard but instantly fell in love with. A great show and a great performance",1358035200,,461,4.372093023255814
3764748,1,B001QFF15M,This is a major rip off.  Little Richard runs through his line up of songs at warp speed~fast than 78 rpm.  Now if you ever wanted to see Little Richard without a shirt and participate with his dumb defying cheerleading skills this is the one for you.  I am astonished that a record company would put this waste on the market.  I think that even an avid Little Richard fan would gag on this one.  Don't waist your money.  BOO!  HISS!  BURN BABY BURN!,1352678400,,450,4.273809523809524
3764749,4,B001QFF15M,"Richard's ""comeback"" got in gear in 1968 and continued into 1971, so we are safe in that timeline to say that Richard is in command, all the way through.

We are in ***** minus territory though, as Richard leaves the keyboard early and never returns. Although, if you want super representative, time-capsule takes on LUCILLE and MOLLY, cuts one and two (BLUEBERRY HILL comes up first but was actually next to last!)...you got 'em.

Another ""minus"" is that we got about 28 minutes of the King. For the lifetime fan like me, it's tough not to see this another opportunity - to a great extent - blown. Considering the quality herein, the unitiated may question ""blown"". But for many of us who were ""there"" (following him closely at the time), this is merely a morsel. I fondly recall a double-date and a visit to Madison square Garden in late 1970 when Little Richard tore the roof off the joint, singing and playing in a way to surprise even the most ardent believer - what a flick *that* would have made!!! (If you can edit out a cool-lookin' cat goin' crazy in the upper reaches!).",1325635200,,1081,4.56701030927835
8335527,5,B001QFF15M,"For a man who played for 60 years you'd think there would be a ton of live DVD's to pick from, but not so.  Until they ever release on DVD the 1972 BBC 2 hour performance show, this is the best concert DVD of Chuck Berry. His Guitar has a Full and LOUD sound to it, plugged into those huge Marshall amps that Jimi Hendix would use gave him a unique un-Chuck like sound. You get 45 mins of Berry from 1969 still in the prime of his life and he PLAYED! Filmed decently, not like today's concerts that every 3 secs foes to another camera, this concert film lets you ""breathe"". Get it!",1492473600,,581,4.0964912280701755

8335531,5,B001QFF15M,"It is very very difficult to find any concert material on Chuck Berry.  This is an excellent example of just how great this guy is!  Because he is notorious for using local talent for backup this is another example of that.  However, he dominates the stage and boy can he play that guitar.  I think the cameraman was a little too interested in the teenage ladies in the audience, but most of the footage was Chuck playing his heart out.  You cannot go wrong with this DVD.",1446076800,,472,4.379310344827586

The CD is in good condition, no visable scratches or marks of any kind, but is past the 30 days to return it.  The few minutes we can see of it are good.  Really neat to hear the concert as it was originally, with no ""modernization"" of the audio or video.",1381363200,,410,4.0625
