3659097,3,B001JQHT6M,"The 'workshop' is a way of thinking about relationships and the self that grants some perspective for those who are overly regimented in their daily / personal lives. Sometimes we end up chasing unattainable, restricted identities of our own devising and this keeps us from living in the moment. That's the useful part. Staying in the moment is a mantra that seems spiritual, acknowledging your desires and allowing them to play out is also something that can shake people out of ruts. But this is the opposite of Buddhism, instead of we are all connected, the message is 'i am connected with this moment and i can choose to act outside the norms of society and worry about the ramifications later'. A useful viewing for reminding oneself to not project forward but in need of balancing with an understanding of the interconnectedness of everyone, in this moment and in future moments.",1369785600,4,885,4.867549668874172
3659098,5,B001JQHT6M,"I have watched this documentary a number of times.  It's extremely freeing and much of what the participants say makes a who bunch of sense.

This method is worthless as far as this film depicts.  The people go to get free and instead they have this idiot pretending to be wise and leading them nowhere doing nothing constructive.  Frankly, I see a lot more destruction going on.  Constructs have a purpose, it's not always good and it's good to be aware of the ones you have in your life, but simply breaking them down doesn't make you who you truly are. The movie is a good way to fall into a trance and sleep.",1355788800,3,609,4.260869565217392
3659100,4,B001JQHT6M,"Not bad
though not the greatest example of
a personal development (PD) camp workshop-seminar retreat
BUT
compared to anything on TV,
especially on Sky or Fox TV,
it's a blockbuster must-see!

Alas, this particular PD camp is just too 'mental'.
There is nothing at all spiritual,
or personal energy educational about this, though, as an insight into things you probably knew nothing about, a real eye-opener.

There is a group in Norway called ""Aruna"",
who do this kind of thing,
but a million times better - with spirituality (non-denominational!),
with education about personal energy fields - and support after stripping people of their egos!
These things Paul, the guru & 'star' of this docu, fail to give.
Paul is no doubt a very intelligent chap and he may well be a very balanced person but he strips people of their clothes, tells them to be themselves, in the here and now, then gives them no introduction to personal energy work, nor help with psychic self-defence, which, quite honestly, you need after being exposed within such a radical arena, with ever-present & ever-ready resident psychic vampires. Neither is there any spiritual development (whether that's an introduction to chakras, kundalini, qi gong, zen, et al, or something more involved); nor any protection against how suddenly stripping away ones inhibitions and programming may leave many very lost souls very angry or depressed ... or prone to sexual predators.
Lost sheep becoming lost wolves, in many cases. Though many do far better!
This film is not meant to be about sex though there are orgy and menage-a-trois scenes and more full frontal nudity than you get in ""Shortbus"", including ... quite frankly, more humanity
(and more exhibitionism!)

In summary, this is an insight into the kind of place where you can find yourself transformed for the better - for the much better - or for the orgy-wasteland worse.",1312156800,10,1893,5.022292993630574
3659101,5,B001JQHT6M,This film was so raw with human emotion and the feelings we create for ourselves on a daily basis. It was a wonderful ride watching the lovelies respond to the workshop stimuli. There was no where to hide and all thier usual behaviors came out in these intimate intense relationships. I just fell in love with all these characters warts and all. The joy on their faces was infectious and their fearlessness should be commended.  The editing on this doc was first rate and the manner in which the story unfolded was riveting. great stuff.  One of the best documentaries ever.  Regardless of your take  on the monogamy issue.,1297728000,5,623,4.6880733944954125
3659102,2,B001JQHT6M,"This had some good shots of naked people, but not enough and really boring to watch. A lot of the dialogue was bland as well. There should have been more sex scenes and older women in this too. They followed a pathetic single guy around and it was boring. He gets propositioned for sex the first day that he is ther by a decent looking woman who says that she likes his penis. Nothing happens that we see, except him crying and the old guru chanting some jive BS about things. Very hippy stupid. Should have been all about sex and nudity and nothing more. should have followed a woman around.",1264377600,5,592,4.342342342342342
3659103,4,B001JQHT6M,"You have to be from the seventies to really appreciate this film.  It is hard to believe but we used to think this way.  Paul, the guru, appears to be a genuinely kind man--sensitive enough not to push people when they don't need pushing but strong enough to say when enough is enough.  Nevertheless, you must be kind when viewing this self-indulgent flick.  Here, are people stripped (quite literally) and trying to cope with what turns out to be their own deamons. Nevertheless, these straight people reach their limits--and while there is one gay fellow exploring his world--in the end, their limits are, well, limited--which is to say, it is kind of a chick flick which some may find daring and others, well, interesting.",1240012800,39,725,4.82258064516129

3659105,5,B001JQHT6M,"Few films take on issues of sexuality and personal growth with as much integrity and clarity as Jamie Morgan's THE WORKSHOP.  A work of such honesty is a rarity in the world of documentary.

Morgan adopts a confessional and intimate tone that allows viewers to get deeply inside the minds and souls of the participants of the titular workshop.  Spanning the course of a ten-day program in self-discovery, the film provides us with close-up portraits of a set of diverse characters, all of whom stand both literally and metaphorically naked before the camera.

If you have ever considered where your own boundaries lie, or if you have  ever been curious as to what desires and fears hide within you, this film will provoke you to consider those questions with greater insight.  Beyond the implications of the subject matter, the sheer sincerity of the execution makes THE WORKSHOP a film well worth owning.",1233878400,14,905,4.921052631578948

3659136,2,B001JQHT6M,"Hard to sum this one up. The basis is that we've all been lied to all our lives about ... everything and, we need to get naked in a massive group of other naked people, have tons of sex, rattle on about our search for self and listen to a guy, in a smock dress, just prattle on about something or other. Yes, I'm skeptical.

California is the place where this all goes down. There's no real on-screen sex involved but there is a lot of nudity, frontal, backal? and there's a scene where a young girl is having a wonderful time playing with a well endowed male figure's endowment. Very strange.

It seems that a certain demographic seek out this type of therapy and that demographic has a seen a lot of alien abduction and ""probing"". I guess, to be kind, we're all seeking something? Enlightenment, fulfillment, contentment, peace ... all those things but, getting naked and partaking in sex with various partners doesn't, for me anyway, offer the paths to those destinations.

I have to admit, I did stay to the end as one or two of the participants are aesthetically pleasing but, despite my sympathy for the quest, the message of this documentary was completely lost on me.

Summary: Nice to watch somewhat strange people romping around naked while becoming enlightened to all the lies that's been fed to them. I guess it beats oodles of depression meds.",1453507200,,1356,4.614107883817427

3659140,3,B001JQHT6M,"First, there are no ""orgies"" on this movie. Mass nudity, yes, but no group sex (explicit or otherwise). This is a form of New-Age California therapy. What I got a laugh out of was the scene of the credit card machines going full tilt at the beginning. The head of this place probably charges you $10,000 to get naked and ""be vulnerable"". I kept waiting for people to start smoking reefer; it would have been symbolic of this type of retreat.
As for the NC-17, it's only because of full frontal male and female nudity. Nothing even remotely pornographic about it. You CAN take something from this movie, if only how some people sell therapy. If you're looking for a documentary that's not afraid to show the male and female body in all its glory, this is it. Don't go in thinking you'll see explicit sex.

This movie immersed itself in the flow and experience of the workshop so that viewing it, I as the viewer, get a understanding and feel of the process everyone went through. It first seeing it was jarring, it was intended to be. This kind of personal development work is tried on and tried out everyday with different names and in many different contexts. For example, resonate healing may be silly to some and to others it allows them the freedom to touch and be touched. Overall this was a good movie and I'm still not sure it is honestly an documentary but I'm comfortable calling it creative nonfiction or a meta-story. This was worth the watch for me, but don't expect plot as this film is personal dynamic driven. It's story is the identity processing that goes on and that is something to think about.

Toward the end I felt like I was watching one of those stupid reality shows, but worse because none of the naked people were even mildly attractive. It is funny watching everyone fighting over the one girl who is the least fugly out of the whole bunch. She definitely wasn't worth fighting over, but when you are in the woods hanging out naked for two weeks, I guess she looks better than your own hand. Meanwhile, the Old Man guru guy is giving stupid advice, like,  It doesn't matter, nothing matters. You need to live in the here and now and the only thing that matters is what you want now. So basically telling then to drop any semblance of humanity and act like animals. Nothing matters except our primal urges here and now. Don't think of past or future, only now and only you. You are alone, so make decisions that YOU want, not what others may want. Plenty of Sociopaths are in prison for acting this way.

3659415,2,B001JQHT6M,"This documentary (or as described by the press as a shockumentary), takes us to a Workshop with behind-the-scenes host Jamie Morgan. The Workshop is run by guru Paul Lowe who apparently influences attendees to learn more about themselves through sexual exploration and sharing in a group setting.

The content from Paul Lowe is sorely lacking in this documentary. Most of the video clips of him specifically are him saying things like ""it doesn't matter"" over and over again. There is no actual meaningful content from him - so don't watch this expecting to actually understand why being nude is important, or what wisdom he actually imparts upon the people who paid to be there.

What you'll get are interviews with attendees, many in the nude, about why they are there, what they are trying to learn about themselves, and what sort of sexual exploration they are interested in. Even these interviews fall flat in meaningful content - probably the most emotional performance comes from Jamie Morgan in a phone call to his girlfriend while he's still at the workshop.

There is full frontal male and female nudity, including one prominent erection. There's a lot of showing off - wrapped in the veil of being free and open and self-exploration and whatever.

The closest thing I can compare this to is The Secret or What the Bleep, in terms of documentary style of a ""metaphysical"" or ""spiritual"" awakening. The difference is that in this one you don't get any sort of real CONTENT. It's a look at the people who are there and what they are doing, but not actually what the viewer can learn from it. There are even scenes of Paul Lowe's face on the screen like he's big brother looking over us telling us to get naked, have sex, and not be monogamous.

And plenty of nudity there is, especially with these ex-Oshoite groups in which an orgy seems to be a preferred finale. One also gets many glimpses of the other workshop participants, all very true-feeling. And the footage and interview excerpts from Lowe are interesting and could inspire some.

The ideas espoused by the workshop leader were hardly revolutionary, but could be thought-provoking. For viewers never exposed (pun intended) to these ideas, the movie could be an interesting starting point for self-discovery, but the speaker was much more focused on breaking down societal constraints than he was helping people understand where they fit into the universe, and what the point of our physical, very temporary , existence might be.  Unfortunately, it seemed to reinforce the emphasis we as a society have placed on intense ""picking the lint out of our belly buttons"" and missing the bigger picture, which is that we are somehow joined to each other and share a common spiritual essence that has become lost in our quest to be unfettered by limitations of affluence and mortality.",1389744000,11,1036,5.240963855421687

Another part of getting naked was so that everyone interacted equally without the status of clothes.  While there was a mix of ages and body types, the filmmaker spent a lot of time on the young women and complimented larger breasts, so being naked didn't seem to accomplish any deeper understanding of others.

At first I fast-forwarded as soon as I saw Paul or the director speaking.  After awhile I slowed down and started to appreciate what he was saying.  On a side note, I became more and more impressed with the clear and sharp camera work.  Geez, I didn't know people could look that good, that healthy, in a natural state.  Makes me think they are doing something right and the director captured the beauty in people.

I've been on retreats and in workshops trying to find the moment for 40 years and I'm still a neurotic mess.  I guess that's why this film resonates with me: they aren't pretending to have reached some perfect enlighted state and still question everything.  This workshop is full of people with insecurities, fears, and doubts.

Paul said something about how we are lying all the time as we try to be someone in the moment rather than just be in the moment.  That we do this to control others, get what we want, to make them like us or whatever.  That we are acting our way through life.  That each moment is something we direct and star in to extract the most from others.  I'm paraphrasing badly and need to watch this again.

And beliefs that are outcast-ed in his own mind and seriously he is demented and is attracting people who are on the verge of dementia.

He has devised a way of keeping a revolving door of new people that are willing to fulfill his sexual fantasies. There is no self help here, only nudity and free sex. He has even gone so far as to come up with a reason as to why jealousy is evil. The ""guru"" never actually says anything important either, only to be true to yourself and that everything you are currently feeling doesn't matter because it is a lie... The interviews in the end don't say that they have any better understanding of themselves either, only that they feel more in tune? I think they just released some endorphins with all the sex and possibly drugs.

I kept an open mind throughout the movie but after thinking on this documentary for a few days, its just absurd. I cannot believe that people actually believe this crap. Furthermore, I think I ultimately have to give the ""guru"" some credit. I think he knows that he is full of bologna, yet he plays the face in order to keep naked people coming. He is the master troll, and even does so without the internet. Well played sir, well played.

Ultimately, my experience with this documentary is just one of sadness. I struggle to understand why a person would ever think that this was a good idea in the first place. Then I just feel sorry that people turn to this as a means for help. Finally, I have even less faith in our society when I see that people actually buy into something this silly and continue to practice such idiocy. I would like to see a documentary on the negatives of this camp because I feel certain that someone there got an STD. I'm not certain, however, that anyone actually got any help or insight into their lives.

8313468,2,B001JQHT6M,Do you want peace? To Awaken? Or are you just looking for a way to fill a void through connection? A movie showing how we misinterpret the search for inner peace through rationalization of our desires and our rationalization to deny ourselves desires.,1525392000,,251,4.8604651162790695
8313469,3,B001JQHT6M,"As other reviewers have pointed out this film is less about Paul Lowe and far more about the film maker and a few other members participating in the workshop. That being said, one of the main themes of the film regarding being yourself and shedding man made inhibitions is what so many people are objecting to, the western tabu concerning nudity. It's wonderful that these people can feel beautiful regardless of their body type. I would have liked to have focused more on his talks but that's not what the filmmaker obviously chose to focus on. Now I don't believe that even half of these folks are their for some type of spiritual awakening or life improving message but more like an excuse to be in a swinger lifestyle without any strings attached.",1513987200,,751,4.654135338345864
