2639859,2,B000HOMSR2,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old with special needs and it really didn't capture her interest for long. They didn't teach as many signs as I had anticipated either.  If it had cost a little less it may have been worth it.  The inclusion of animation was a good idea, it was helpful in keeping my daughter engaged for a little while. I wouldn't recommend it though.",1197417600,,367,4.228571428571429
2639860,5,B000HOMSR2,"My Autistic son is almost 3.  He barely speaks  However, we put this Day video in and by the time it was finished, he was signing 3 words!  We have played this video for 2 weeks and he knows each sign by motion AND by word!  It is AMAZING!  I knew the animated Monkey would be the key to him learning.  The monkey is very basic and is pleasing to a toddler's eyes.  HE LOVES IT!  We have tried other sign language videos and they are ALL poorly made with uninteresting film content and the cartoons don't hold his attention span.

THIS VIDEO ROCKS!",1196899200,9,548,4.1923076923076925
2639861,5,B000HOMSR2,"Our 10 month old baby girl loves these DvDs, we bought both the daytime and nightime ones and she sits and avidly watches them.  They hold her attention great and the basic but bright colours on the screen catch her eye from across the room.  They are simple enough and repetitive enough that she seems to be taking them in quite well.  As yet we have not seen any constant signing but every now again she does what we think are the starts of signs, we are just having to learn how she does her signs.

She already knows the starting music when it comes on she sits right down ready to watch.  We have these DvDs and others playing most the day while she plays in the living room and she runs back and forth then takes a few moments to sit and watch them, sometimes longer.  They have also helped her father and I learn the basic signs and we now use them as much as possible.

I would definatly reconmend these to others and as we have our next baby due in a month I am definatly going to have him watch them aswell at a much earlier stage.",1175817600,4,1041,4.123762376237623
2639862,3,B000HOMSR2,"This video moves at a very, very, slow pace.  I understand the need for repetition, but the pace does not hold my child's attention...it just seemed to drag on and on.",1175731200,,167,4.387096774193548
2639863,5,B000HOMSR2,"This video was simple but effective.  It emphasizes USEFUL signs that are easy to learn and incorporate into everyday routines.  My toddler picked up the signs surprisingly quickly.  Though not done perfectly, it did help me understand what he wanted to say.  Good stuff!",1168992000,6,271,5.090909090909091
2639864,5,B000HOMSR2,"A friend of mine sent me this video because she knew my 18 month old is on the brink of talking, but gets a little frustrated when he can't get me to understand what he wants!  I popped the Happy Signs DVD in one morning for him while I made his breakfast, barely watching it myself.  That evening, I was giving him dinner and picked up his bib to put it on, and he made the sign for ""bib""!  I was shocked! I put in the DVD again, and sure enough -- the little characters on the video were making the same sign!  So we watched it together so I could learn the signs too.  The next morning, he pulled me into the kitchen and I asked him what he wanted and he made the sign for drink... again, I was totally amazed!  I would love to say it's just that my son is a genius... but I really think it is the video.  We watch it about every other day now, and even though he already learned the signs, he really likes the characters and watching the other kids/babies.  I wish I would have started this sooner -- maybe he wouldn't have gone through his squealing phase when he was trying to communicate!  Oh, and I promise you will get the cute theme song stuck in your head for days.",1159833600,20,1176,4.0562770562770565
2639875,5,B000HOMSR2,Purchased for young autistic child. Great entertainment. Held attention for quite some time. Recommended.,1443052800,,105,6.571428571428571

2639877,5,B000HOMSR2,This helped my son pick up on simple signs to help communicate before he was talking. I was truly amazed at how fast he picked up on the signs from this video. Learning sign language helped calm my son down when he was so frustrated because he had no other way to communicate.,1436227200,,276,4.226415094339623
2639878,1,B000HOMSR2,"No useful words.  In what world would my toddler ever need to know the word ""bulldozer?!""  Seriously. Don't waste your money.  You are better off finding a few words on YouTube and teaching your baby yourself.",1423958400,,209,4.75
2639879,5,B000HOMSR2,"I got both the Happy Signs Day and Night DVDs and I think they are super useful for new parents struggling to communicate with their babies.  The signs taught are all useful and easy to learn.  I don't mind the concise set of signs as that's already a lot for my  baby to learn. It's both a learning and bonding experience for me to ""sign"" with my baby daughter.  She enjoys the funny monkey character and the colorful scenes.  How do I know?  Because she shrieks with joy when the monkey is onscreen.",1413331200,,501,4.333333333333333
2639880,1,B000HOMSR2,horrible.. the sign for drink & all done is not even the actual sign. Their 3D video is very cheaply made. Waste of money.,1404259200,,122,4.125
2639881,1,B000HOMSR2,My apraxic son hated this video.  He would shake his head no and cry.  Not helpful for us.  Should have returned this one.,1391212800,,122,4.217391304347826
2639882,5,B000HOMSR2,"My grandson just turned 14 months old.  We have use signing as a learning tool for him since he was about 9 months.  It is very interesting to watch him attempt to make the various signs.  When it rains he uses the sign to say rain, snow and frog.  It is very interest to see how this DVD on Signs keeps him interested.  Will look for other Sign Language DVD's as he grows.

Great way to teach a foreign language.",1324252800,,413,4.1
2639883,5,B000HOMSR2,"Start the day right! Happy Signs Day teaches useful signs that you and your child can use throughout the day. Is your child hungry or thirsty? With Happy Signs you'll know and be able to respond right away. Happy Signs allows your little one to clearly express his or her needs. Thus easing frustrations that babies feel when they are unable to convey their thoughts through speech. Based on american sign language,Happy Signs is fun and easy for the whole family to learn.",1307491200,2,473,4.710843373493976
2639884,1,B000HOMSR2,This is the worst video I have ever seen. It is super slow with everythihng. My child was not thrilled with the video at all. Waste of money,1305417600,,140,4.035714285714286
2639885,1,B000HOMSR2,This video will teach you just about 8 signs... that's it! Better off googling the basic signs if that's all you're looking for.,1294876800,,128,4.608695652173913
2639886,3,B000HOMSR2,"This video's graphic are poor and the selection of words taught is minimal. Good for a starter video, not worth the price I paid for it. I bought the used one even.",1289952000,,164,4.15625
2639887,2,B000HOMSR2,"I got this DVD for my kids, 14 months and 7 years b/c my BFF is deaf and so is her child. I was hoping it would make learning sign more ""fun"" for them. But the video was very boring and didn't teach us anything we didn't already know. I think it would be great for just talking to your hearing baby, but if you are actually wishing to learn how to communicate with a deaf person then this DVD is worthless.",1288396800,,406,3.9634146341463414
2639888,4,B000HOMSR2,"This was obnoxious repetitive and the woman's voice is a little irritating, but my baby does seem interested in it because of the animals and animation.  I am not sure the signs are all ASL.  Some of the differ from other ASL DVD's I have, like My Baby Can Talk DVD's.  Those get 5 stars all the way!",1285372800,,300,4.137931034482759
2639889,4,B000HOMSR2,"I order items from Amazon regularly - at least twice a month - and I rely heavily on customers reviews for my decisions.  This is the FIRST time I felt compelled to review an item myself.  My son was recently diagnosed with some sensory perception issues along with speech delay - he is just over 2 years old.  This DVD has not only taught him some signs but he is very ENGAGED - he can actually watch it TWICE over - I have to stop it!  He runs to MORRIS the Monkey and is now beginning to copy not just the words but the signs also.  We have just started this about 3 weeks and I am very encouraged - I am buying the NIGHT version of the DVD.  **It does not have too many signs on it like a reviewer said but it is enough to get started and it covers all the major FUNCTIONAL signs for a toddler to communicate. They include: MORE, EAT, ALL DONE, TOOTHBRUSH, COAT, DOG, BIB, HAT and DRINK. These signs are repeated over and over again in a fun way with music, color and MORRIS the MONKEY. It seems like the idea is for both the sign and the words to be learned silmultaneously.  For kids with any kind of delay - repetition is vital and this works EXCELLENTLY.  I hope this helps somebody. I am not sure how effective a DVD with tons of sign language covering every single thing will be helpful to kids who have some delay difficulties to begin with - a few fun signs at a time seems a great idea so I like this. Good luck and God bless! Not given 5 stars because POBODY's NERFECT! :)",1282521600,11,1486,4.1
2639890,3,B000HOMSR2,"My 2-year old likes watching it, and seems to learn the signs, so I can't complain very much.  It has less content than some other DVDs I have bought, and it has a format that is a bit repetitious for adults.",1271548800,,208,4.073170731707317
2639891,4,B000HOMSR2,Baby really enjoys this one and has learned to sign hat from two viewings. I think because of the cartoon characters and the amount of repetition not found in other sign videos the happy signs is a series i would purchase more of. FYI The sign for drink in this video is slightly different than in other videos we have.,1239321600,,319,4.333333333333333
2639892,3,B000HOMSR2,"The dvd is a little short for the money spent. The information that is on the dvd is fine,it just could be longer and contain more sign language.  ! Our child seems to like the DVD.",1228521600,,181,4.027777777777778
2639893,5,B000HOMSR2,"My son loves this video - he is 18 months old and still interested in it.  For the parents watching it, it can seem very bizarre indeed, but for some reason, that little monkey and all the little kids hold my son's attention.  It covers most of the signs one needs to communicate with a toddler.",1228262400,2,295,4.25

8140699,2,B000HOMSR2,Couldn't keep my sons attention (2 yr old). They slowly and repetitively teach the signs (about 9 of them I think) but the video itself isn't interesting enough for a toddler to really engage,1500076800,,191,4.647058823529412
8140700,1,B000HOMSR2,"All of the signs are not correct. I know sign language, and as I was watching this with my grandchild, when they showed the sign for 'finished'  and it wasn't even close,  I decided the person who put this together is not truly familiar with sign language.  This was a Christmas gift and we are just now watching it so I'm assuming it's too late for a refund.",1487721600,,359,4.25
