They can't keep all witnesses quiet, however, and it was interesting to hear their accounts.  You will never view your leaders in the same light.",1383177600,,260,4.630434782608695
8431279,4,B004ITYDWK,This one wasn't what I was expecting although I did find a great deal of information I hadn't heard before. I am ufo vid collector and this definitely has the re-watch factor.,1362960000,,175,4.5
8431280,1,B004ITYDWK,"This was a total waste of money. This is a 3 dvd set. The first one was boring. The 2nd one was a British TV show, interviewing people about Britans health care program. It was so boring I got disscusted and turned it off mid way through. Didnt even bother to look at the 3rd DVD. This one goes in the trash heap.",1322179200,4,313,3.984126984126984
