4084595,5,B0038FPDSS,"Contrary to another reviewer who scored this film 1 star, I think this film is a wonderfully nostalgic look back at what was a great second feature film in it's day. Back when this film was released, right up until the 1960's, movie goers would spend a full morning, afternoon or evening AT THE MOVIES. Everyone would watch previews of coming attractions, newsreels and cartoons before the main feature film and then watch a second feature film. The second feature film was usually a new, lesser, B movie. Fighter Squadron is just such a 2nd feature film from 1948.

 First of all it's in TECHNICOLOR!  It has a rousing musical score. It has comic relief. It has a handsome Gung-ho cast, And it has vivid action scenes including many just released, real, in color, combat fighter footage from WW2. Today, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg could use that footage in a HBO special. This was a movie to show audiences of post-war America the heroic exploits of the young fighter pilots of the 8th Air Force, their determination, their bravado, and their sacrifices; and to entertain them. And to show the audience real aerial combat footage on the Big Screen, in color for the first time. It scores high marks for all these. And it is one of the few Hollywood films where there is no female star.

 Keep your eyes open and you will see Rock Hudson in his first (non-speaking and uncredited) film role as one of the 2nd Lieutenants standing around the conference table. Another first film appearance goes to Jack Larson, TV's Jimmy Olsen in The Adventures of Superman. He plays Lt. 'Shorty' Kirk and appears in the latter half of the film but has quite a good speaking role. Tom D'Andrea, who you may recall playing Jim Gillis, the next door neighbor of William Bendix in the 1950's TV series The Life of Reilly serves up the comic relief throughout the film.

 I found this film a glorious, exciting and colorful surprise film from the post-war era that is watchable over and over again.",1272240000,34,1981,4.659025787965616

4084605,5,B0038FPDSS,"From my earliest child hood memories during the 50's I have loved this movie.  There is something about the cinematography and the use of some of the  earliest vibrant color film (1947), the corny dialog, aerial flight and fight scenes that just leaves an unendurable impression on one. Edmon O'Brien is just the best.  The use of the California National Guard's p-47's  which provide endless moments of awe as take to the sky and fight.  The Guard also provides P-51's with german markings that even though totally  breathtaking.  I have seen movie over 20 times in my life and will most likely watch it  soon after writing this review.

4084630,4,B0038FPDSS,"Color footage of any World War 2 era combat planes is rare and enjoyable. Some of Edmond O'Brien's lines are a little over the top, but his character and indeed all of them are believable. Air combat over Germany was a grim business for pilots on both sides. Shooting at pilots while floating down in their parachute unfortunately did happen. All sides were guilty of this. In fact, General Eisenhower made it a standing order to stop any American pilot from shooting at a German pilot who had bailed out. In exchange, the Luftwaffe personnel protected our downed airmen from angry lynch minded civilians.  The gun camera sequences are good, although as others have previously mentioned, a few pictures of Japanese aircraft are shown. Tom D'Andrea's con man character Sgt Dolan adds a little comic relief and I'm sure there were several like him in real life. The big contribution of the P-47's came when they were switched to ground attack when the Mustangs took over most of the escort missions. Excellent combat footage in this movie showing how effective they were.  Have to smile when you see the P-51's painted dark green with German crosses and swastikas on them. No real Messerschmitts available in 1948 Hollywood. It's a good vintage war movie that is quite accurate for its time. No real 'Hollywood' plot, just a good chronology of events leading up to and after D-Day. Enjoy it for what it is.",1395014400,,1404,4.797520661157025

Reasons not to like P-51 Mustangs playing German fighters
there were enough German fighters around should have used those primarily Bf-109's

The markings on the aircraft were not correct Expecially D-Day markings when fliming the D-Day missions there were none Major FUbar",1346457600,4,541,4.74468085106383
4084641,4,B0038FPDSS,"This movie is a real throwback. As I said in the header,one of those war movies I used to stay
up on the weekend to watch on the Late Show Movie back in the day (1960s) when there were only 3 TV channels. In fact, I had not seen this movie since then and jumped at the chance to own a copy of it and I will say that the transfer to DVD is very good. There is no CGI or any of that BS. They used real airplanes and as this flick was made in 1948,soon after the war, there were actual P-47 Thunderbolts they could use in the production. There is a real beauty for the airplane buff in seeing the P-47s on the field for the before mission shots and the actual WWII footage used in the movie is a real treat as it is not the regular stuff used over and over in every documentary you have ever seen. There are some spectacular crash landings (real footage) as well as close up air to air combat and dramatic ground attack footage and the exploding trains and airfield installations attest to the havoc that the Thunderbolts could visit on the enemy.
 After saying all of this I don't want to neglect the story itself. Some real life issues are addressed like orders to stay with the bombers, don't drop tanks and requests to fly ahead and tackle the Germans on the ground before they could rise to attack the bombers. Fliers deal with the loss of friends as well. Edmond O'brien and Robert Stack (big stars of the time) head the cast
and an uncredited Rock Hudson can be spotted in several scenes. There is comedy  relief too in the
guise of a conniving supply seargent. If you are a fan of the old school war flick that really
waves the red white and blue. Pick this one up.",1325462400,,1670,4.183229813664596

4084645,4,B0038FPDSS,"Warner Bros. Pictures presents ""FIGHTER SQUADRON"" (1948) (96 min/Color) -- Starring Edmond O'Brien, Robert Stack, Henry Hull, James Holden, Walter Reed, Tom D'Andrea & Jack Larson

Directed by Raoul Walsh

At an American air base in England in 1943, insubordinate ace fighter pilot Ed Hardin (Edmond O'Brien) is promoted to commander of his group. Now he must fight his former anti-authority stance as well as the enemy - tension grows as D-Day approaches.

The star of this film is the combat footage. Lots and lots of great color footage of planes, some of them making emergency landings and airborne kills.

Special footnote: -- A few notables here: the excellent Technicolor photography; the performance of 15-year-old Jack Larson, making his screen debut in the role of a rookie pilot who grows up in a hurry after scoring his first kill (Larson later gained TV immortality as Jimmy Olsen on Superman); making his first screen appearance, in a role so small it isn't even billed, is a former truck driver named Rock Hudson

Another top notch score by Warner's number one composer Max Steiner

The score got a little too intrusive towards the end, but luckily it was gone by the end run.  Max Steiner is okay, but this time the score overwhelmed some of the scenes, especially the serious one; the score has a gayity to it that doesn't go with all the ariel scenes.  I've always liked Robert Stack in these type of old WWII movies, he's smoothe and cool throughout.  As another review writes, there was some good background info about doing ground runs and dropping tanks at 1st sight of the Germans and the struggles that active duty flyers have with higher ups developing the plans in staff rooms.

4084652,4,B0038FPDSS,"This is a somewhat glamorized view of American P-47 pilots during WWII.  P-47 bases were often located very close to the front lines and usually had almost no amenities.  My uncle flew Thunderbolts in the summer and fall of 1944 almost exclusively in support of ground troops.  He flew 25 missions until he was killed in November.

The story is simplistic, but fairly entertaining.  I bought it for the action shots of the P-47 and the gun camera film showing what these guys did and what a dangerous job it was.  Unfortunately, some of the dogfighting and strafing runs show Japanese planes being attacked.  I guess they didn't have enough film from Europe, or maybe they just didn't know.

Good cast with Robert Stack and Edmund O'brien  and Rock Hudson acting goofy in his first role.

4084654,3,B0038FPDSS,"As a fan of WW II books and movies, and a Rock Hudson fan, I ordered ""Fighter Squadron"" mostly to see Hudson's (uncredited) film debut. He appears in three or four scenes, and has a couple of spoken lines (including the fabled 38-take line) and there's all that black hair and That Smile -- and usually a cigarette.  And at one point, he even joins in the singing.
In ""Idol,"" a biography of Hudson, Robert Stack, one of the film's leads, recalls, ""He was very nice, very shy, and of course he didn't know what he was doing because it was his first movie.  Very, very handsome, but it was a man's picture, so nobody paid a lot of attention to him... At one point Rock was in the middle of the scene without anything to do; he just kind of stood there.  And (director) Raoul Walsh said, 'You're standing there like a tree--get out of the middle of  the shot, or stand sideways so you don't block everybody.""
The ""plot"" is the usual WW II propaganda, although there are some interesting sidelights involving the disagreements over allowing fighter pilots to dump belly tanks (to give them greater speed and maneuverability against the Nazi fighter planes)and the arguments over sending the fighters in ahead of the bombers at low level to destroy Nazi planes on the ground.  This brought to mind Randall Hansen's excellent book, ""Fire and Fury,"" about the Allied bombing of Germany.
The movie includes a segment based on a real-life incident where a pilot landed and rescued another pilot who had been shot down.
Any fan of WW II aviation films can pretty well predict which of the pilots will get killed in this one.  Still, it's worth watching if only because of the dogfight scenes, and the sound:  When the ammo starts flying, the noise seems all too realistic; I never heard bullets hit like that in any other movie.  And then there's another of Max Steiner's memorable scores.

I completely understand that obscure movies like this do not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would've gladly paid a dollar more for a disc that would last forever.

I enjoyed the movie great entertainment. 5-Stars.",1494633600,2,420,4.859154929577465
