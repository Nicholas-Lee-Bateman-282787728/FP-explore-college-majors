8146091,3,B000ILYZ0M,"Reading about the prevalence of frequent medical errors is depressing. This four hour presentation does have SOME success stories that gives one hope of minimizing serious errors. It was good to see John Hopkins acknowledging their serious mistakes.
As to how many other hospitals and clinics will learn from their provem remedial procedures remains to be seen. ONE HOPES.",1409788800,,372,5.322033898305085

He even left a note about it on the hospital's Doctors Lounge white board.  He said, ""Mom, this is athe best gift that I've gotten since the White Coat Ceremony!""  I couldn't believe his reaction because he's not easily impressed.",1359504000,,398,4.383561643835616
8146093,5,B000ILYZ0M,I show this DVD to my nursing students for discussions about American health care issues.  Excellent film to stimulate thoughts on patient safety and quality of care; nothing like putting real faces on issues to feel the urgency and relevancy.,1285372800,2,243,5.075
8146094,5,B000ILYZ0M,"PBS has done it again.  They have produced a detailed and well delivered program that shines in many respects.  Covering 4 parts in 4 hours of material, this is a decent examination of important medical dilemmas our country is faced with and sheds light on positive measures for improvements.

Part One:  Silent Killer

Medical errors are a widespread and dangerous crisis in America today and they`re explained here.  This first segment shows new methods in place to offer more immediate and beneficial responses to patients in distress.  A doctor and advocate for patient safety began the `100k lives' campaign and challenged hospitals everywhere to join his crusade to help save 100 thousand patients in hospitals who would have died otherwise.  Over 3000 hospitals volunteered for this effort and it has had impressive results to date.

Part Two:  First Do No Harm

As many as 90,000 patients each year die from infections they contract while in the hospital.  This is the focus in part two and it describes how two million patients are infected each year by health care workers and how a super resistant strain of bacteria is currently wreaking havoc across the country.  A group of hospitals are fighting this epidemic and are reaching out to help other communities in peril.  Examined next are mistakes made in regards to patient medications.  A recent study showed that thousands of patients nationwide suffer severe medical problems due to these mishaps.  Innovative technology is in place to help computerized ordering of medications but its use is not widespread.  Efforts are being made to demonstrate the importance and benefits of this tool.

Part Three:  The Stealth Epidemic

Thirty percent of the American public (nearly 100 million people) are inflicted with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, congestive heart failure, asthma, and many others.  These are scrutinized in this third segment.  The message offered is that healthcare management does not  provide enough education and prevention for many affected people and funds for the uninsured are never enough.  Also, for those with multiple illnesses and doctors, lack of communication between caregivers puts these patients at even higher risk and that is exposed here.  To assist with this crisis, some doctors and specialists are encouraging patients to take charge of their sicknesses and to educate themselves on how to better control their lives.  This has already shown improvement in many patients and reflects positive change for the chronically ill.

Part Four:  Hand In Hand

Family Centered Care is the last segment here and it is a distinctive look at how families are now intimately involved in a loved one's medical treatment.  The Medical College of Georgia consulted with parents of very ill children (who have had to spend a great deal of time in hospitals) to help with the planning and design of a new children's medical center here.  This new facility has no visiting hours as parents and family can stay with their loved ones overnight or for extended stays.  Once a month, a special committee meets in the hospital consisting of a Parent Advisory Group and a children's advisory group and the kids get to offer suggestions on what changes they want to see made in the center.  Parents can even accompany their sick children into the operating rooms, intensive care units, and recovery rooms if they want to.  On the adult side, the hospital built a neuroscience center that also has accommodations that allow for family members to stay overnight or longer.  Due to such significant and appealing methods, the Medical College of Georgia is now nationally recognized for their successes.  Current academic medical centers are a long way from emulating Georgia's progress but they are noticing the benefits and are making plans for similar changes.

This documentary isn't all inclusive as there are myriad problems in American healthcare that can't all be included here.  As for the time and effort dedicated to each of these topics though, I was impressed and learned quite a lot.  I would definitely recommend this program to everyone as health issues are a vital concern for all of us.",1186272000,10,4181,5.083700440528634
