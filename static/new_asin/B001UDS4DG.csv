3798045,5,B001UDS4DG,Jockeys is a show from Animal Planet. It follows a group of jockeys at the Santa Anna racetrack during the month before the Breeder's Cup. It is a fascinating look into what really goes on behind a horse race. I learned so much. The show is fast paced and is very easy to get addicted to. I made my brother watch the first episode and he hates horses but ended up watching the entire season with me. I feel that the DVD is well worth the money if you enjoy horse racing and or horses. If you are not into the races then you may not enjoy this show. The extra features  are really good as well.,1253059200,5,593,4.068376068376068

8343359,3,B001UDS4DG,"I bought this hoping for some Zenyatta moments, which it doesn't explicitly say there would be but it does show her Jockey wearing her owner's colors and is filmed during the time when he was riding her. So I don't think I was off base to expect to see alot of her (or even a little would have been nice). But, you see her pretty much once and only for a little while for one race, so that was very disappointed with that. But, like I said it's not like they lied or said anything pertaining to her, it just had that feel and I was surprised to find out she was barely mentioned. Quality and delivery were both great and I'm sure someone coming in with different expectations would probably really enjoy it.",1490572800,,707,4.2835820895522385
8343360,5,B001UDS4DG,I was sad when the tv show didn't have a 3rd season. I really enjoyed the behind story on the people that race horses. I felt bad when Mike Smith and Chantal Sutherland broke up. I was hoping they would have a long and happy relationship. But I guess it wasn't meant to be.,1488412800,,273,4.074074074074074
8343361,4,B001UDS4DG,The track announcer re-did the race calls to give more attention to the riders featured in the show. But unless the viewers are die hard race fans I don't think they would pick up in it . Still a great look into the lives of these fantastic athletes !!,1466899200,,252,4.163265306122449

8343364,5,B001UDS4DG,Great dvd,1424390400,,9,4.0
8343365,5,B001UDS4DG,"This is an exciting look inside the world of a professional jockey. If you are a race fan there are some great moments on this DVD set. Zenyatta is on this one and you get to see Joe Talamo on his way up from the minors. The show is heartbreaking and personal in places. But the one thing that I found disturbing is how frequently they featured horses in jeopardy. It is true that as a race fan, you see a lot of tragedy, but the producers seem to treat every fall as a spectacle to be milked for all it is worth. I suppose they were trying to show the Macho Factor of race riding, to bring in the casual reality TV viewership, but it gives a skewed view of the sport that I found irritating. Other than that, it is a great series and invaluable to anyone interested in the backstretch of a major race track.",1319241600,,808,4.120253164556962
8343366,5,B001UDS4DG,"Great, enjoyed this alot. For the racing person this is a good watch, looking forward to Jockeys 2",1287446400,,98,4.5
8343367,5,B001UDS4DG,"Some consider thoroughbred horse jockeys, pound for pound, the greatest of athletes. I've always agreed, but watching this series, I agree even more. This series (season one, season 2 just started on Animal Planet) follows a group of jockeys at the Oak Tree meet at Santa Anita, which culminates into the Breeders' Cup weekend, one of the richest purse weekends in the world.

The show follows the jockeys as the newcomers and journeymen try to break into the competitive Santa Anita colony, which some of the best jockeys in the world are stationed.  We pretty much get to know about a jockeys life: waking up early, visiting stables and exercising horses for the chance to ride later on for that trainer, the constant struggle to maintain weight, the dangers of racing, how carefully they are watched by the stewards so they do not endanger other jockeys or the horses, etc.

Each episode is short, 20 minutes without commercials, and the storylines are addicting - you want to see the result of what the jockeys are trying to accomplish during that episode.

The bonus material is okay, combined, they also only take up only about 20 minutes. The best thing about this dvd is that you can see all the episodes at once one after another, and with no commercials.",1255219200,4,1264,4.757990867579909
