The DVDs come in two tri-fold packets that slide into a paper slip case. 4 DVDs in one and 6 DVDs in the other for a total of 10 DVDs. There are slip-in slots into which the DVDs are entered. No plastic anywhere in this set,...it's all paper. Not much protection here and I would think too easy to scratch the DVDs. Containers are flimsy but functional. The film selection is OK. I don't care much for The Star Chamber but I like the films where Mr. Douglas is paired up with Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito. AND there are actually two films here I haven't seen so, that's a bonus. Mr. Douglas has had a terrific career and I am sure we will soon see a box set that includes some of his greatest films. Amazon Prime has FREE shipping on select items. I always say, if it's FREE it must be for me! That's it. I'm done.",1293580800,22,1054,4.121359223300971

8410111,3,B003ZD9E1U,"Good collection of ten Michael Douglas films. There are some great classic films well worth watching in this collection. This 2010 collection includes The Star Chamber, Romancing The Stone, A Chorus Line, Jewel Of The Nile, Wall Street, War Of The Roses, Shining Through, Don't Say A Word, It Runs In The Family and The Sentinel. Seven of these films are considered classics. The Star Chamber, A Chorus Line and a few others are missing extras but we do get almost 4 hours of total supplements in this set. This collection is good value for your money if you want more than two of Michael Douglas's films. My only complaint is that Basic Instinct, Disclosure, Coma, Falling Down and A Perfect Murder aren't included (sold separately on Blu-ray). This collection isn't available on Blu-ray so you can't beat the price when you are getting ten films. Michael Douglas Blu-ray collections only come with 3-films instead of this 10-film DVD collection.",1377388800,2,947,4.925
8410112,5,B003ZD9E1U,"This contains a variety of films by M D. Besides his blockbusters with Kathleen Turner, there are several thrillers that are not friequently seen. Easily worth the price for 10 movies, though the packaging is terrible.  You will need to change to discs to individual sleeves to prevent scratching.",1374537600,3,297,5.061224489795919
8410113,2,B003ZD9E1U,"I received this Michael Douglas Collection, as a present, and so far, have found two of the DVDs are completely defective, (meaning I have been unable to play them, even after, cleaning them).  The films, themselves, are enjoyable and Douglas is excellent in the ""Sentinel"" and ""Shining Through"", and great fun in ""Romancing the Stone"" and ""The Jewel of the Nile"".  In general, all the collection are good choices, but you take your chances with the terrible packaging in cardboard slots that scratch the DVDs, easily.",1357862400,3,518,5.011627906976744
