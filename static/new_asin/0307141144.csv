7787895,5,0307141144,"""Have you learned your lesson, you naughty, naughty boy?"" is my daughter's favorite Madeline song, because she understands that Pepito, the Spanish ambassador's son, hasn't been very nice to the animals in the neighborhood. Likely the best adaptation of the original Bemelmans book in this (Cinar) series of videos, ""Madeline and the Bad Hat"" tells the story of a lonely little boy who tries to get attention by being cruel and mischievous. He learns his lesson when one of his pranks go awry, and then realizes that being nice makes better friends than by being naughty. Highly recommended.",1008547200,2,591,5.040816326530612
7787896,5,0307141144,"The Spanish Ambassador moves in next door to Madeline.
Madeline and the girls are surprised to see that, as Miss Clavel says, ""his excellency has as BOY!""  Well, his excellency's son, Pepito, does a lot of marvelous things:  leads frogs around on strings, dumps poison on ants, and pops the balloons of little girls.  He even carries a cat around in a bag, and lets it out amidst a pack of dogs!
As Madeline says, Pepito is a BAD HAT.
This hilarious story is about how Pepito comes to be reformed.  It's got a lot of funny scenes, and there are many levels on which the story can be enjoyed.
The video has marvelous, enjoyable songs, also!
My two year old son asked to see this video over and over, and I finally bought a copy.",993600000,,727,4.323529411764706
