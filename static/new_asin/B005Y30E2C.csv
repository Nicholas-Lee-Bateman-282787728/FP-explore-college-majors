4904184,5,B005Y30E2C,"This video was great although I have only completed workout 1, I still like this DVD. He's not annoyingly talkative like Jillian (but I still love her) however I was sweating which meant it was good enough for me. I hope he does more workout videos because I enjoyed this; out of breath and loved it.",1329955200,,300,4.375
4904185,5,B005Y30E2C,"First, I have to note- I almost gave this four stars.  I didn't love the music.  I decided not to give it four stars because the workout is solid and I believe in giving credit where credit is due.  So, despite the fact that the music grates on me, I have to admit- the workout is worth it.

I am a former runner, having recently given it up after 25+ years.  My knees no longer love the impact, but I still miss the endorphins.  I have always loved fitness and push myself as hard as I can, but nothing has come close to giving me that feeling of clean lungs and burning legs that makes me feel amazing and kept me going back for more abuse from running.

As a result, I'll try just about any workout DVD that promises that it's ""extreme.""  Many promise it, and are not extreme for anyone with a decent level of fitness.  Many promise it, and are dangerous or beat your body up with plyometric or just tricky moves that provide too great a risk for injury.  This one toes the line beautifully and gives a great workout with very little impact.  Additionally, I love that there are a couple moves I've never seen before!  I'm looking forward to tomorrow and seeing what muscles are sore to get a better sense of just how this workout got into some of the muscles that may have been neglected from my other workouts (which, just for reference, include spinning, elliptical, P90X, Bob Harper, yoga, etc).

It's difficult to categorize this workout as strength or cardio- it isn't intense strength, and it isn't intense cardio, at least not for me.  However, I did sweat and my heart rate did get up at times.  The biggest benefit of this workout, in my opinion, is just the fact that there are so many compound, complex moves- but they're well-explained, and the movements are at exactly the right pace to provide the challenge and yet the average fit individual should be able to still do them.  So, multiple muscles are being worked, but in a healthy, safe, effective manner.

The instructor can be just a little bit annoying at time, but I give him a ton of credit for creating something new that I'll enjoy working into my rotation.  Additionally, the music can be turned off- next time I'll likely do just that and play my own music in the background, which should make for a definite five-star worthy workout!",1328140800,13,2313,4.466666666666667
4904186,5,B005Y30E2C,"I bought this DVD as a pre-holiday gift to myself to ensure I had something easy to pack while traveling around visiting family.

It is the best workout DVD I have ever purchased. And trust me...I have quite a collection at home. The best thing about it is the fact that you don't need a separate DVD for each body area. Mike's workouts encompass all body parts...you have to work them hard but you don't have to spend half of your day working out to ensure you get every body part. It's not easy motivating trainees through a DVD since the trainer can't see if you are or aren't doing everything...but Mike manages this perfectly. I almost feel guilty not doing all of the moves...as if he'll know.

I have read a lot about Mike Donavanik...He is definitely a master trainer...and he seems to have a great personality which is apparent in the videos. I have been using his DVD for the last 4 weeks, twice a week, and I can already see a difference.

Buy it!",1324339200,10,958,4.401129943502825
4904187,5,B005Y30E2C,"Extreme Burn is no joke. This workout will have you dripping with sweat.

I tried this workout out of curiosity after doing P90X for 13-14 weeks and was not prepared for how intense it was going to be. As a fairly fit, thirty-something guy, I've always been more inclined to go for workouts that feature lots of weights, and keep my cardio for the stair machine, mostly staying away from workouts like this that feature lots of high-paced reps with lighter weights. But I was having trouble slimming out, even with P90X, and decided to try something different so I gave Mike Donavanik's workout a try.

First thing I noticed is that he gets right to the meat of the workout. The warm-up is very brief and then it's strength training intervals, followed by cardio, followed by more strength intervals and then abs. Keep in mind that the strength intervals in this workout are more intense than other people's cardio. You will need to take breaks. But basically, he doesn't waste any time. His 40 minute workout will have you sweating and burning more than other people's hour workout.

The other thing I liked is how simple the equipment is. You don't need any heavy weights, which is good since those things are expensive! A pair of 5lb dumbells and a pair of 10's and a yoga mat is all you need. And chances are you already have those.

And I'm already seeing the results. A couple weeks ago I couldn't keep up with the first workout, not I'm doing the extreme workout, which is 80 minutes of core city. My shirt is drenched by the end of it. And for me, it's a nice break from lifting heavier weights and running on the treadmill. Mike's concept of total body training has you doing moves that work the whole body at once. I like that. It's super efficient, and it will make you way more toned than regular running and lifting ever could. He's got moves and exercises I've never even seen before, where you're working legs, back, abs and arms all at once.

Bottom line: if you're looking to bulk up, this workout is not for you. But if you're looking to slim out and get super toned, this thing works! Also, I wouldn't recommend it to beginners, but those of you who are already in pretty good shape but are looking for something to kick it up a notch, this one's for you.",1323820800,29,2274,4.469879518072289
4904188,5,B005Y30E2C,"This program completely changed my body!! Will always purchase videos that Mike produces.  I'm so happy that I discovered Mike D workout dvds.

Mike you are a STAR!",1367193600,2,164,4.821428571428571
4904189,5,B005Y30E2C,"I enjoy MikeD's coaching style - encouraging and tough without being mean or snarky.  The workouts are very challenging without being overwhelming or discouraging.  The moves are very efficient for whole body toning, strengthening, and calorie burning.

I have to modify some of the abdominal exercises to protect my lower back, but otherwise the moves are very reasonable and safe.  Done workout #1 and #2 multiple times over the past few months and been very pleased with the results.  Have not had the determination or stamina to try the #3 combined workout... maybe someday.  Looking forward to his ""ripped"" DVD coming out soon...",1360886400,,634,5.106796116504855
4904190,2,B005Y30E2C,"Does not like the way the instructor teach, plus the third workout is the same as the first two, I thought it would be something different.",1358812800,2,139,4.384615384615385
4904191,3,B005Y30E2C,"This workout had some really good moves, is very challenging, and is constant movement.  But it is so BORING.  The music is horrible and his personality is boring.  Time moved so slow.  I can't bring myself to do this workout.",1353283200,4,226,4.575
4904192,5,B005Y30E2C,"I usually don't write reviews for videos, but this is one of the best! I've done pretty much every system out there and this is definitely in my normal rotation! Can't go wrong with this one!",1348185600,,191,4.333333333333333
4904193,5,B005Y30E2C,"This is one great video! Very difficult, non stop workout that will really make you sweat and get you out of breath! I think of myself as being in good shape since I workout regularly. I am currently doing P90X, Insanity, Supreme 90 and Bob Harper's videos to really muscle confuse my system and not be bored. This one is now a part of my circuit. It has 3 different workouts in one DVD and they are tough. I highly recommend this video to challenge you and get you in great shape.",1348012800,2,481,4.239130434782608
4904194,5,B005Y30E2C,"Fast pace, efficient, and effective - I've been looking a workout DVD like this for a long time.  Most DVDs are too slow after a while..P90X was just painfully slow.  Bob Harper is hard but I can't stand him.  I get a great workout in 40 minutes flat (maybe 42 if you need to stop and catch your breath a few times).  Can't wait to try his 2nd DVD.",1344470400,2,348,4.0
4904195,5,B005Y30E2C,hard workout.  this guy does not quit! its a continuous no frills routine that isn't fluffed out with too much talking. i would reccomend this over other more expensive workout dvds.,1338854400,4,182,4.870967741935484
4904196,4,B005Y30E2C,"I had not heard of Mike Donavanik until Amazon ""recommended"" this workout, and am I glad they did! First of all, this is probably not one for beginners. Mike and his team of 2 incredibly fit looking women take you through your paces for an intense whole body workout. There is an emphasis on functional movements and compound exercises where you utilize many muscle groups all at once. This adds up to a super burn. Mike very nicely demonstrates each movement before you get into it- this helps because many of the exercises have multiple phases. More attention could have been paid to describing good form but Mike does do a fair job of this. The DVD production is good with a bright studio and good cueing between exercises. Mike is motivating without the annoyance factor and pushes you to the finish. Would definitely recommend this one to any one looking to kick their work out up a notch.",1330128000,6,894,4.628930817610063
4904197,5,B005Y30E2C,"Extreme Burn contains two vigorous, intense, and fast moving workouts.  Be prepared to move - the cardio is high impact and sweaty.  The sculpting moves are doable, but a few are a little complicated, containing a few parts to the exercises.  You need a set of lighter dumbbells and a set of heavier dumbbells.

Each workout contains two sculpting segments, one cardio segment, and one abdominal segment so this has a little more of a sculpting emphasis, (generally preferable for men who want to build a lean body).

Workout # 1 (42:19) Intermediate/advanced - intense
Workout # 2 (45:44) Advanced/advanced plus - more intense

You may also combine the two workouts for an extreme burn.
Workout # 3 (1:22.33)  This is over an hour and 22 minutes.  By the second workout, this becomes almost unbearable and the arms become fatigued.  You have to pace yourself on this long one.

8489048,4,B005Y30E2C,"I just got this on Friday and did Workout #1 on Saturday. I felt it was challenging without the dread factor (Insanity definitely has a dread factor with me!).  I do feel that the ab portion came a little earlier than I would have liked, but overall, I'm looking forward to doing Workout #2.

8489051,5,B005Y30E2C,"The 60 minute workout is longer than 60, but keeps me me pumped up the whole time.  I only wish there was less pause, but I get it.  I would rather there be a thurough broken down instruction to keep the viewer safe, than not at all and have the viewer (and even myself on some of the moves) perform the excercise dangerously.  I LOVE the core section of this 1st half workout, or if you are like me the first set of core of the combined videos.  It is hard for anyone to work my core so well as Mike Donavanik does (THANK YOU MIKE!).  I love a physical challenge and find it hard to get in most videos.  Jillian Michaels is the other other home DVD trainier that I fully enjoy and become challenged by.  Yes, I like these two far better than a P90X or Insanity video- as my knees can handle this.  If you have knee issues, you should still be able to do this video, just modify by not going as deep on the various lunges and modify the light jumping cardo.  This video is all about functionality training and will have you sweating as any workout should do.  This is a MUST buy.

I generally like to do about a 50 to 70 minute workout so I put on the full workout 3 and do the second workout up through the cardio section. I highly recommend this workout!
