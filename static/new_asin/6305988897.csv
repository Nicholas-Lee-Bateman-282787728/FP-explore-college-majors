7898972,2,6305988897,"I'm willing to bet the 3, 5-star reviews (all anonymous) are related to the filmmakers. A shot-on-video movie, has some decent things going for it (competently shot, above average acting for the most part) but still feels like a community college project. The main star (with a porn name) loses her loser boyfriend to a drug overdose. The police question her (one suspicious overacts in every scene he's in) and she keeps saying someone else drugged her boyfriend (a story angle they never really go into.) She goes to the cemetery next to her house (it's obvious prop headstones are placed in grass) and her boyfriend comes to her (in pale makeup) saying he's in purgatory but if she kills 6 people in the graveyard (some don't get killed there, but then again it's shot on video & the story is loosely followed) he will live again.

The cops CSI her and she ends up dying as her boyfriend lives again. Will she follow him and make his life hell? You won't care because you will be hitting the FF button through this snorefest. The minimal nudity, provided by star with the porn name, won't keep your interest, minimal blood, plodding script won't either.",1463616000,,1156,4.666666666666667
