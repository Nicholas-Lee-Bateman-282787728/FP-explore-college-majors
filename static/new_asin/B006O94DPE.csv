The Gundam series set a new standard for Giant Robot warfare series. Calling it a timeless classic would not be completely accurate; the animation is clearly dated, especially when compared to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gundam-Unicorn/dp/B004TRJRCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gundam Unicorn</a>&nbsp;or even a slightly older series such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gundam-SEED/dp/B000YGP6RC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gundam SEED</a>, and the actual plotline is a bit on the idealistic / over-stylized side. Given the date of original writing and airing, it doesn't take a huge amount of imagination to draw the parallels to World War II. (On an aside, there is one opening shot in the first set that looks real close to a famous stock military footage scene showing ships in a line. Definitely a throwback to WW2.)

Calling it a 'respected classic', on the other hand, is very accurate. Gundam started or canonized the proper traditions of realistic warfare and character mortality in Giant Mecha series, no mean feat in the height of anime's Humongous Mecha explosion. So radical a departure was Gundam, its initial run was nearly a complete bomb-out. The series is 39 Episodes long, cut down from a planned 50 because the production company thought it was a dead duck. It was not until several years later that Gundam gained traction in syndication and started growing a real fanbase. Thus was the legend born, and did come the multitude of sequels and spinoffs. (on another aside, if you watch the series in a short period of time, you can definitely tell where the series was compressed on orders from above. The plot of the last few episodes move far faster than the first 30+ eps.)

Herein is the interesting part. Gundam is gritty. Gundam is messy. Gundam is very bloody. Gundam pulls no punches, a habit taken to extremes in the follow-on series. Taking giant robots and making them reasonable for most Sci-Fi viewers was a stroke of genius by Hajime Yatate and Yoshiuki Tomino. They built an empire that is still making its impression on the world to date. There is a reason why Gundam is called the father-series of Real Robot shows.

Simply stated, you don't watch the Original Gundam for graphical beauty, unless you like it retro anime. You watch Gundam for the storyline and the lead-in to the more advanced series. You watch it for the good old-school Gundam music. You watch it to see the Red Comet get his butt kicked repeatedly. You watch Gundam to watch Zeon get disassembled by a 16-year-old kid piloting a monstrous machine of war.",1350432000,,2714,5.3489461358313815
5008918,5,B006O94DPE,"Yes, it is actually Ga-ndamu judging by the Japanese characters on the karaoke version of the video (yeah, I'm that big of a geek!). All jokes about the terrible/awesome 1979 theme song aside, Mobile Suit Gundam was a groundbreaking series which changed the future of animation for good. In Japan and also in the world.

Before this series, we had seen some flashes of the giant-mecha-robot-space animations, but nothing to capture international audiences. Fans can point out Mazinger Z (72 - 74), but though the series was amazingly popular with Japanese fans, it was little known in other countries. Gundam was hailed as the first 'real robot' series as opposed to the 'super robot' genre to which Mazinger and others belonged.

The series features Amuro Ray as the intelligent youth that ends up piloting a giant mecha in order to save his friends. It's a beginning repeated in nearly every Gundam series. In fact, Gundam SEED is more or less a remake of this series down to little details like Char's mask being used by Rau Le Creuset and the Newtypes in this being the Coordinators in SEED. Amuro is drawn into a conflict between Zeon and the Earth Federation, Zeon being a rebellious faction claiming independence from the Federation.

In watching this series I am taken aback by just how advanced the theories were for being written in the early 70s and animated in 1979. Little details are impressive, such as the little automated handles that people use to travel down halls in low gravity, the gel used to seal fissures in the hulls of ships, the shielding used for re-entry into Earth's atmosphere, the hints of early genetic engineering of humans, the advanced weapons (again - written BEFORE Star Wars - so the beam sabers were NOT based on light sabers from those films). Even White Base is an advanced spaceship type that looks like it was meant to be a giant Gundam hanger (a model used in an improved form for SEED - the Archangel).

People die in this series, and it's handled realistically. When a particular Zeon Zaku falls into the atmosphere, the pilot pleads with Char to save him. Char responds that there is nothing they can do, it's already too late, and salutes the soldier for his efforts towards stopping Gundam. Then melting occurs. Or in another scene Char is furious because he 'lost 8 good men already'. It's not in line with some other series where the death toll is either extreme or nonexistent. Though I will say that in episode 2, those guys with the laser rifles trying to shoot Char must be extras from the upcoming GI Joe series - 10 or 20 guys all shooting at Char and NOBODY can hit him! But other than a few goofy moments like that, the fighting is somewhat realistic in a science fiction sense. Amuro brings his Gundam around between the sun and the enemy in one scene in order to gain a surprise attack; in the same scene, White Base cannot fire on Char's flagship because the Core Fighter is in the way.

Why should you watch this 30+ year old series? I would say that those saying it's too dated or that the animation is too rough merely need to look at this series with a different perspective. It is like looking at early Renaissance paintings. Yeah later paintings have more perspective and better paints and more updated themes; but watching this series is like looking at the anime version of the first artists to use perspective. In 1979 Mobile Suit Gundam broke ground never before imagined for an animated television series. The depth and complexity of the story, the plausible future situation, the technology, the imagination are all so advanced that even a new series (Gundam SEED) still uses 90% of the themes, stories, and technology and seems in line with modern science fiction theory!

Animation is dated, but impressive considering the era and the lack of technology and the restrictive budget. The series was originally unpopular even in Japan, but Bandai released models of the suits and Gunpla was born. The series received a huge revival and many sequels began to be released (Zeta Gundam and the film Char's Counterattack).

This DVD boxed set contains episodes 22 - 43 of the series, uncut with Japanese audio or the English dub. The English dub is actually not THAT bad. Brad Swaile voices Amuro, he is the voice of Light Yagami in Deathnote, which has the distinction of the ONLY anime I have seen where I overwhelmingly prefer the English dub to the Japanese original. But the Japanese audio is the true way to watch the series. It just seems to fit. But whichever way you watch, it is enjoyable.

Flawed show? Yes. But a piece of history and nostalgia that any mecha anime fan needs to see. I highly recommend it!",1349222400,8,4688,4.701583434835566

5008920,5,B006O94DPE,This is the completion of the original Gundam Universal Century series. On my opinion it still has the best story line compare to story that come afterwards. The character has very distinct personality that you can compare with ordinary people you see everyday so it will appeal to older kids .The story has good theme and robots involves are merely ordinary weapons like today's tanks and fighter. I highly recommend the japanese language version of this DVD because it uses the original sound effects.,1330819200,5,503,5.0
5008921,5,B006O94DPE,"Excellent show! I remember watching this as a kid, and it's so nice to watch it again. The packaging is cool, the art work is very nice. The dvd case is the same size as a normal dvd, not a thicker case. The art on the dvds themselves are neat as well. As far as the content, it's pretty bareboned. Basically only play all, scene selection, setup, and extras. Not many extras to speak of. Also, their is no music during the menus. It's just completely silent, which I thought was odd. Couldn't they have just put the gundam theme in?

Overall, excellent product. Good price for a good show. It's always nice to watch some gundam on the couch before bed :-)",1329868800,8,656,4.333333333333333

8501760,5,B006O94DPE,"Great series, but once again like on the other collections - Price Tag is too High.

Anime Legends....what is it with putting an outrageous amount of money on these collections?

The series are good, but no one in their right minds should pay anything over $80...and $80 is the high end of what a set of dvds like this really cost.",1407456000,,331,4.409836065573771
8501761,1,B006O94DPE,"I'm sure that the shows are fantastic, but with prices being what they are (on average $200+) for half of the series it is not worth it in my book. Those prices are just downright extortion at its finest. Hopefully they will be rereleased in the future and there will be an affordable price out there",1406073600,,300,4.375
8501762,5,B006O94DPE,"I have been a fan of Gundam since I first got laughed at by all the asian kids in my class for not having seen it before. That was 1992. So, bear in mind that this series is a must for all Gundam fans! The original series as it was seen on TV has action, style, depth, and emotion beyond any show of its type. Show it to your children! And, watch it again as an adult. This series is great for all ages!",1393200000,,403,3.8095238095238093
8501763,1,B006O94DPE,"First off, I will say that I love this series, but it is not a review of the show but rather for the product and trying to bring awareness of the product's availability and bootleg problems plaguing the marketplace. This is not a seller problem, but these will be found at conventions, online retailers, and brick and mortar stores that don't know better.

In 2012 Bandai Entertainment USA went out of business. Since then many bootlegs have hit the market, especially for the popular shows.

These bootlegs typically come in a clear case and are nearly indistinguishable between the retail copy. This particular series was never released with clear casing and came in a thick black box. The DVDs they're using for these are DVD-5's, meaning that the max they can put on the disc is about 4.75 Gigs while the official retail releases use DVD-9's. Due to the fact it's impossible to tell by looking at the DVD set, the only way to know for sure if you have a bootleg or retail copy is to check the disc's properties in your computer.

The only way you will know for sure that you got an official retail copy, will be:
1. If you buy *directly* from Amazon or Rightstuf. Their warehouse stock comes directly from the publisher.
2. If you buy new it will come with a security sticker.
3. The final test to see if it is legit is to put it into your computer and see if the disc is less than or greater than 4.75 Gigs. If it's greater than that, then you should be good.
Example: [...]
(note: the bootleg on the right was not an Anime Legends bootleg, so they may have copied the disc file name for these as well)

I hope you found this information useful. There's not many people who know about this and I'd hate for people to continue falling prey to buying bootlegs.

Not only is this happening to Bandai's Anime Legends sets, but it's also happening to Discotek Media's sets as well.

8501764,5,B006O94DPE,"In my opinion, one of the most important and pivotal anime series ever produced.  Like the original Star Trek series, it created a franchise that is still relevant and entertaining for more than 30 years.  Despite its age, Mobile Suit Gundam's characters and story continue to be equal to or better than any Gundam series' that have come after it.  And as someone who owns every Gundam series except Seed Destiny and Gundam Unicorn, I like to think I have an excellent understanding of the franchise and its many incarnations.",1379289600,,526,4.822222222222222
8501765,5,B006O94DPE,"I felt bad dropping $100 on this title, but after watching the first two discs I have to say this series is totally awesome and collection 2 is even better than collection 1.  If you haven't seen this series yet, please get it.  The Blu-Ray version has come out in Japan and it's going to be totally great!  You should watch this in Japanese, because the voice talents are real good.  Enjoy!",1378598400,,391,4.388888888888889
8501766,5,B006O94DPE,"The best half of the first series in the Universal Century timeline. Get it. Love it. Live it. Watch it. Then watch Zeta, ZZ, and Char's Counter Attack. Those will give you the majority of the series. For the full line up, you whould watch in this order: Original series, 08th MS Team, 0080, 0083, Zeta, ZZ, Char's Counter Attack, Gundam Unicorn, and F91. As of yet they've not released Victory Gundam in America which would come after F91.",1378512000,,440,4.582278481012659
8501767,5,B006O94DPE,"Any true Gundam fan knows how pivotal the original 38 episodes are, and for die hard fans, just how important the original language is to the story.  When this collection first came out as an ""Anime Legends"" series, I seriously thought I had all the time in the world to purchase this product.  How wrong I was, especially noting that I'm not the only ""true believer"" of this series.  So when I saw this item on Amazon, needless to say I was psyched.  I was also amazed at how fast it was being bought up.  To sum up, the product came exactly as advertised, no scuffed discs, and the artbox came in as pristine as when it first set sail from the factory.  This seller is on point and I would recommend anyone who looks on their Amazon page and sees something they have that you want to buy it from this seller.  A+ in my book.",1369267200,,826,4.222929936305732

If you don't know, this is an amazing series filled with a deep story line, gripping action, and wonderful old-school animation.  I've watched the whole series four times now (including my viewing of this product) and it never fails to amaze me at the level of sophistication they pulled of back in '79.  Great stuff!",1355788800,2,426,4.578947368421052
