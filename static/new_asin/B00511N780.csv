8452177,5,B00511N780,"Both movies weren't blockbusters, but they are absolutely worth watching.

Enemy At the Gates tells a story from the WW II Battle of Stalingrad. Great cast, fine acting, with Ed Harris playing a (no swastika) Nazi sniper. Jude Law has lead as the best sniper in town. Rachael Weisz as the love interest, and Bob Hoskins makes a very credible Nikita Kruschev. Don't miss it.

Ooopsss... gotta go...",1318550400,,397,4.823529411764706
8452178,2,B00511N780,"I wanted to see Enemy at the Gate again and, for the price, got Defiance too.  ""Enemy"" was okay...the cinematography was very good but I get frustrated when film makers feel obligated to weave in a love story into a war film. I just watched ""Defiance"" today and was very disappointed.  The cast was very promising but again I found the story a bit too contrived (though, granted based on true events).  I'll doubtfully watch either again.",1318464000,,438,4.662337662337662
8452179,5,B00511N780,"This is my very first Bluray purchase. Both of these movies play in the highest quality as in HDTV. I felt like I was right there and some scenes I was in the line of fire....wow realistic.

Defiance~Four brothers find their family had been killed by the Nazi's. They decided to fight back. They went into the woods and very soon found some very bad things. They also found fellow Jews on the run. They banded together under the direction of these brothers and moved from came to camp that that built each time. At the end of the was 1,200 Jews survived because of them. Many gave their lives. It is a history lesson that anyone over 17 yrs old should see. It is quite violent and very hard to watch at times but it is fact and must not be forgotten. At the end you get to see pictures of the real people and what they went on to do. Very moving and upsetting too, but a must see.

Enemy at the Gate~This one for me the HD seemed even more almost 3D at times. I was in this movie. Another story of two men who fought with all they had. One a reporter who made his friend famous for killing German officers. There are some double agents involved that make it even more exciting. This to is very violet and graphic. Not for children under 17 yrs. Some it hard to watch, but it is history.

Both of course have some love stories that go along. Be sure to watch the extras they are really good about the filming and more about the real people. Highly recommend to all who like history.",1315440000,,1481,4.189473684210526
