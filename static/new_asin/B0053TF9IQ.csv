8455641,5,B0053TF9IQ,"I received the DVD today and promptly popped it in and did the workout.  It was a really fun DVD.  There are no complicated moves just fun disco dance moves.  This is a DVD any one could do at any level.  Even though the moves were simple does not mean it is not a good workout, your heart will be pumping, but you will be having so much fun you won't notice.  I am hoping to find more DVD's with this instructor. The only complaint I have is the that cook down was a bit too short and stretches were not long enough to give sufficient release of the muscles.",1371772800,2,559,4.045454545454546
