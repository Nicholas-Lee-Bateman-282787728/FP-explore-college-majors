8703813,1,B00U1GQOJY,"Mystical far-right fundamentalist conspiracy nonsense made to appeal to weak-minded, low-info folks susceptible to this kind of tripe.

To quote Lincoln, ""This is just the sort of thing you'll like ..if you like this sort of thing.""

Laughable for any intelligent, informed person.",1499126400,,281,5.511627906976744

8703816,1,B00U1GQOJY,"I would give this product a 5 star review if the sound track did not drive us nuts!

I purchased these two DVD to show at our monthly function; Movie Night with the Grassroots in Spokane.  This past week on Wednesday we hosted a special event to focus in the issue of immigrant resettlement in the U.S.  We had a presentation of the matter by our State Representative, Matt Shea, and then showed this DVD (Part1).

While the general information on both these two DVDs is excellent, the background sound track is overwhelming; continuously starting over and building to a crescendo.  The audience of 70 were quite distraught as they could not hear the words due to the poorly produced soundtrack - effectively making the information unintelligible.  It is true that many of the video scenes have captions displaying text of what is being said, however, when the music ends (loud Crescendo), there is silence, at which time everyone could easily understand what was being said at that moment, then the music starts again (same sound track) and within a minute the vocal track is again not understandable.

I would encourage the producer of the product to re-engineer the sound track as the importance of the information is quite valuable.",1445644800,9,1236,4.857142857142857
