3486954,5,B001B8TKFQ,"Like Hip Hop songs,Kungfu flicks also have what many call ""Punch Lines"" which are UNforgetable,in this case, scenes;& this movie has many of em! Water ninja's,boat fights,fights between huge groups(like Herioc 1's status),& David Chiangs heroic fight to the death(STANDING UP!!!!).THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TOO!!! I'd much rather see David Chaing & Ti Lung's team over the Venoms team anyday. You must have this movie in your collection it has many GREAT fight scenes & an even GREATER storyline",1253232000,5,491,5.15
3486955,4,B001B8TKFQ,"Another classic from the maestro Chang Cheh, deservedly getting the five-star treatment from Tokyo Shock.  Like I've stated in other reviews, it really does bring a smile to my face to see all these classic Shaw titles, not just being put on DVD, but also getting remastered, restored, widescreen, uncut & your choice of Mandarin or an English dub.  Thank you Tokyo Shock!  An early classic (1971) starring members of Chang's team before the Venoms; Ti Lung, David Chiang, Wang Chung, Chen Sing, Wang Kuang-Yu & Ku Feng.  Plus, choreography from Tang Chia & the Pops-Lau Kar-Leung (Liu Chia-Liang), and a guest spot from Yang ""Bolo"" Sze.  Featuring the usual Chang traits-chivalry, honor, bloodshed & sacrifice.

Now, I love this Sung Dynasty period piece.  However, if you're expecting ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" wire-fu or high-octane fu found in Chang's later films with his Venom team, well, don't.  This is good, sturdy ""old-school"" fu that paved the way for the Venom team (who I also love).  This is more along the lines of ""The Heroic Ones"" & ""Have Sword Will Travel"", yet I felt this film was superior.  There was a balletic grace in the choreography not seen yet in the previous efforts.  Not to give anything away, but I thought the climatic end was a show-stopper.  Time to get rid of my bootleg, pan-and-scan, VHS copy, & enjoy this remastered classic DVD the way it should be seen.  Can't wait to get ""Life Gamble"" next.",1229817600,11,1440,4.828571428571428

3486971,3,B001B8TKFQ,"I tried watching this on Amazon Instant with my Prime membership. First I would like to state that those Hoping to see the real ""Deadly Duo"" will be outa luck.  I won't give a full review until the people in charge of putting up the movies, box picture, Director, year and actor put it right. It should read ""Blade of Fury"" aka deadly duo (1978) director:  Ching-Chen Yang,  actors:  Angela Mao, John Liu, Tai Lun Chang. Thanks",1375574400,,427,4.5064935064935066
3486972,4,B001B8TKFQ,"The DVD cover is actually The Deadly Duo (1978) (aka The Two Great Cavaliers Director:  Ching-Chen Yang), not the The Deadly Duo (1971) by Director Cheh Chang.  I'm not sure which one people are getting, but either way, both are pretty good kung fu films.",1370908800,3,255,4.644444444444445
3486973,3,B001B8TKFQ,If you want alot of kungfu action this is a good flick. Didn't like the storyline to much though. If it had more storyline and less action it would have been perfect.,1351987200,,166,4.21875
3486974,3,B001B8TKFQ,"I don't know why Amazon listed this movie with a 1962 release date when this was actually released in 1971. It's been awhile since I've seen this movie but I remember it being rather mediocre and dumb in one particular spot(where I'll mention in a moment). Lots of weapons(which is probably the movie's strong point) and colorful shots from the costumes to the outside scenes. Ti Lung wields an axe, Ku Feng has a kwon do staff, Lau Kar Wing uses sword length spears, Yeung Chak-lam  with a Baton that shoots fireball pellets, some guy with giant Zildjan Cymbals, and Chiang has a harpoon whip chain thingy.  They kinda had a 5 Elements things going on here with the bad guys but of course this was poorly played out but would later be implemented much better with 5 Element Ninjas. I beleive the basic premise of the movie is that Ti Lung/Chiang & Company are trying to rescue a prince being held captive by Ku Feng & Chan Sing. In order to do so they have to get an emperor's seal to prove their identity and cross a rickety ass bridge to the place where the prince is held captive. This bridge is the bane of most of the good guys existence. Knowing full well that the bridge cannot support the weight of the men crossing it(i guess its immune to the elements though), nearly all of the good guy jobbers cross it to only fall to their demise. I can only imagine this is where the writers from Saturday Night Live got their inspiration for the Polar Bear Sketch from the 90s. If you are a fan of the Iron Triangle era, then I guess get this to complete your collection but I found it rather mediocre and quite forgettable.",1316390400,5,1624,4.392026578073089
3486975,3,B001B8TKFQ,"This review is for the Region A Blu-Ray edition of The Deadly Duo as released by Tokyo Shock (Media Blasters).

The technical quality of this release would get a 4 star rating.  The Celestial Pictures transfer is beautiful with sharp colors and detail in 1080p High Definition (16x9, 2.35:1 widescreen NTSC).  Some people may think it is too sharp or cold but I liked it. YMMV. You get the Mandarin and English audio tracks in Dolby Digital TrueHD and the English again in Dolby Digital Surrond 5.1.  English subtitles are there as usual. It's a great viewing experience overall.

This is definitely not in my top ten Shaw Brothers releases although it features a pretty good cast including the smirking David Chiang, Ti Lung, Ku Feng, and Chen Hsing.  The fighting is mostly weapons-based with swords, axes, fire bombs, knife-edge cymbals, and a nifty little harpoon/chain device that David Chiang uses.  Chang Cheh directs and delivers the usual blood and impalements, and it's not shocking that I don't remember seeing a single female in the entire movie (surely there was one somewhere?). The fighting is competent but not overly exciting and I could put together a fairly long list of martial arts films that I think are better.  The story is a standard rescue plot and is fairly predictable.

Extras include interviews with David Chiang and Ti Lung as well as a Stills Gallery and a Trailer Gallery.  If your a Shaw Brothers fan and collector you will likely want to pick this one up but don't rush.",1276992000,8,1505,4.7984496124031
3486976,1,B001B8TKFQ,"It's a shame I have to give this dvd a score below what it deserves. From my judging it's about a 2-2.5. Somewhere in there. In no way is it a 3,4, or 5. The fighting is below mediocre. And you just know a movie sucked when it ends and you say, "" I know it's not over "". Didn't matter because before it ended, I seen enough to determine what type of movie it would be.

Why it is so expensive I don't know. It shouldn't even be sold for more than 5 bucks. In fact it's close to being a 1 dollar walmart buy. I had to give it a 1 because it's score is way too high and it needed to be balanced out. So others can look at it a bit harder before prematurely investing 12-20 bucks on it.

The only bright spot is the plan they use to get into the palace. I won't spoil it. Other than that, I see nothing good about this movie. Obviously when there are less graders it's harder to weed out garbage like this. But here is my contribution. This movies really isn't worth a rental. It would be worth a 1 dollar walmart buy if you're bored and fiending for some kung fuey.",1255737600,,1063,3.9395348837209303
3486977,4,B001B8TKFQ,"A ""quickie"", by Shaw standards (just over eighty minutes of running time), this Ti Lung/David Chiang venture doen't overstay its welcome, and anybody wanting to test the waters of Shaw Brothers' movies on DVD should try this as a starting point. This is just one of many Chang Cheh films featuring the two leads in a team-up; they are NOT ""teamed up"", of course (Ti is in the movie more than David), but who cares, really? I love being a literallist, but I digress.... It's another fine Tokyo Shock presentation with good audio, video, and extras, though the profiles on Ti and David are already available on the reissue of ""The Water Margin"". Is David Chiang worthy of the role ""Little Bat""? Watch and see, and to all nay-sayers of Chiang out there: lighten up!(P.S.--Look for this release to come out on Blu-Ray in May, and it already looks GREAT on DVD!)",1253577600,3,857,4.644736842105263

8282307,1,B001B8TKFQ,"The movie itself is good, would like to give it more stars, but the DVD I received is not what is advertised. This review is for the ""Desert Island Classics"" release.

The cover and description on the back bill it as ""Deadly Duo"" (1971) starring David Chiang and Lung Ti.  The movie that is on the disc was actually ""The Two Great Cavaliers"" (1978) starring Chen Shing and Mao Ying, directed by Yeung Ching Chen.  I realized this when I played the prime streaming version after watching the disc and the streaming version was a completely different movie.

The ""Desert Island Classics"" release is also a pretty bad pan-and-scan.",1514937600,,628,4.73394495412844
8282308,5,B001B8TKFQ,Fantastic Martial arts classic right here! People are so anal on these reviews bitching an complaining about every single thing smh. If you like the Shaw Brothers an Love old school Kung fu flicks then buy this now while you can because Kung Fu blu ray movies are very hard to find. I own this movie on DVD an had to buy the blue ray when I finally realized it was available. I don't do spoilers so thank me later. Just know this is one of the Shaw brothers all time classic films right here. Non stop bloody action with old school flavor! Can't go wrong with this purchase.,1514937600,,574,4.275229357798165

8282310,3,B001B8TKFQ,A pretty good movie but at times your scratching your head and even laughing especially when some of the people trying to rescue the Prince and on the bridge you will see why I said laughing it had good fighting scenes and also has BOLO YEUNG in it so to me any movie with BOLO is a good movie and trivia he took the name BOLO YEUNG after Enter The Dragon his real name was Yang Sze a true Legend of the MARTIAL ARTS movies definitely worth the money and would watch again even with the bridge part,1489795200,,498,4.091836734693878
8282311,4,B001B8TKFQ,"During the Sung Dynasty in Northern China, a prince is taken prisoner in order to prevent a Southern uprising. However, the prince is heavily guarded and early rescue attempts fail. Now, it's up to two kung fu experts, Ti Lung (Jackie Chan's DRUNKEN MASTRER 2) and David Chiang (SHAOLIN MANTIS) to use their extraordinary skills to rescue the prince and the skills are as they are in all these kung fu movies so first off you have to be a fain of them. If you aren't you will not like them at all but if you love these old Kung Fu films get this one it is terrific. I am not as fluent as the other reviewers as to who the action guys are but they are both sensational.",1486598400,,668,4.186046511627907

8282313,5,B001B8TKFQ,"Blu-Ray: 5/5 - Blu-ray comes with some elegant trails crap with Ti Lung and David Chiang and other crap. Picture quality and transfer are wonderful and the audio is happy. Yay.

Movie: 3.5/5 - The reason why I liked this movie is because of the bridge scene. In one instance, this guy would attempt to cross the bridge because he is confident in his Light Skills but alas he fails and plunges to his doom. Then the next guy would say some $@!+ like ""my Light Skills aren't as good as his but I know I can make it."" Failure! I don't recall how many times these idiots tried it (i think it was either 3 or 4) but it was so damn funny, I $#!+ blood. One of them was fat, too, and he was confident he was going to cross but he fell as well. It's like watching the Roadrunner cartoons. But anyways, this is a Kung Fu movie about some morons trying to save some Sung Dynasty prince from some evil guys. The story is coherent but flat and uninspiring and the Kung Fu action was fun. Recommended to Kung Fu lovers at best.",1476316800,2,1014,4.147208121827411
8282314,5,B001B8TKFQ,David  Chiang,1473552000,,13,5.5
8282315,5,B001B8TKFQ,"Totally a mad fan for both players here. David Chaing always the hero and its true here. Great kung fu action, dangerous fighting.
The objective is to rescue a prince being held for ransom or a prisoner, by a ruthless warlord. In one scene, these guys so intent on crossing a bridge that will not be crossed, three, one right after the other, died in the same miserable horrible as the one before, I personally thought it was totally ridiculous. Didn't you just see that guy dies? What makes you think you will succeed any more than he did? Well nobody asked him that question so he just had in his mind that he wouldn't end like the guy before him. He was so wrong. It took David Chaing to devide a way across the bridge without dying 200 ft. below. In the end, there was some equally boneheadedness. Ti Lung and David chaing having effected the rescue of the price were racing to the harbor to get away on the makeshift raft some of the men made. We they were being chased by the warlord's men and little did they know he had sent his men to the harbor to attack the guys protecting the getaway raft.
Big giant fight scene the raft builder/ protectors were ultimately killed and then Ti and David got hey and continued the fight and killed the attack group who killed the raft builders, but no sooner had they finished bumping of those bad guys the main contingent arrives and another battle scene erupts. The thing now is that the prince has to be saved so David tells Ti get to the raft and get the prince away. David goes back to fight that army. Anybody who seen a David Chiang movie that he fights armies all by himself and sometime with only one arm.
Well David fighting the army and killing them but, he has to keep them away from the raft, but stupid Ti Lung wants to fight with David and doesn't want to leave him to fight alone. David had a real hard time telling the guy get out of here and save the prince, you dope. Finally Ti got the price aboard and paddled away and the hero David Chiang met his end with about 20 arrows stuck in him. It was pretty good movie.",1468800000,,2078,4.263291139240506
