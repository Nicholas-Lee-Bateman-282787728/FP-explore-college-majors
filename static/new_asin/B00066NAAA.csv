The matches were horrible even the match with Sandman was complete crap.

Don't buy this",1461110400,,164,4.258064516129032
8552864,3,B00066NAAA,"3PW is an indy promotion out of Philedelphia like ECW and CZW. However, the style of this company is much different. Let me break down the matches on this DVD which were taped at the ECW arena.

Match #1: Rob Eckos vs. CJ O'Doyle - Never heard of these guys, but they put on a decent jobber match. Eckos wins with a turn-around russian leg sweep. 5/10

Match #2: Jack Victory vs. Rockin Rebel - You should probably skip this one. It is about 3 minutes long and boring. Victory wins with a rollup and feet on the ropes. 2/10

Match #3: ""Pitbull"" Gary Wolfe vs. Damien Adams - Pretty much a squash match with the pitbull taking the win after 2 powerbombs. 5/10

Match #4: Jasmin St. Claire vs. Gorgeous George - Total waste of DVD space. Skip it. 1/10

Match #5: Low-Ki vs. Ruckus vs. Joey Matthews - It's an elimination match, but Matthews sits it out until the first elimination. I expected more out of Low-Ki and Ruckus. Their first part is good but not long enough. Ki eliminates Ruckus with the Ki Krusher. Then, Matthews enters and they put on a pretty good show. Matthews grabs the ropes during a rollup for the win. This match was still somewhat dissapointing. 7/10

Match #6: Monsta Mack & Mike Kruel vs. Blue Meanie & Roadkill - An entertaining, but slow match with the 4 big men. Funny spot when Roadkill puts on a sock and applies the mandible claw to Monsta Mack. Mack wins with a chair shot behind the referee's back. 6/10

Match #7: Jimmy Snuka vs. Matt Striker - Quick squash with Snuka hitting the Superfly splash for the win. 4/10

Match #8: Sabu vs. Jerry Lynn - Two great stars put on a good match filled with high-flying action, chairs, and tables. Sabu wins with a leg drop on Jerry Lynn through a table. 8/10

Match #9: Zandig & Wifebeater vs. Raven & The Sandman: I expected alot out of these hardcore icons but was sadly dissapointed. There is only one real highlight in the match and that is when Wifebeater gets thrown off a stage through a table. It's the only real hardcore spot. They spend the rest of the match trying to wrestle. Trust me, you'll be dissapointed by this match. 6/10

Bonus Match: Syxx-Pac vs. Sabu - good match by the two. It's good to see Pac again. They break several tables and the ending is cool. Sabu wins after a top rope powerbomb, puttin Pac through a table with a chair on it. 8/10

Overall, a decent DVD but stick with ECW or CZW. There aren't really any stand-out matches and the commentary is pretty boring. If you're a fan of indy stuff and want to see some past stars, pick it up. Otherwise, don't bother.",1099353600,2,2565,4.378947368421053
