8091568,4,B000BRO4NQ,"I liked the story a lot. The movie was good in spite of the age of the picture(over 80 years), and the Awful!!!! subtitles. About 20% were unreadable. A faded, old black & white film with subtitles that, in many cases, had no contrast. Anyway, I liked the movie!

8091569,1,B000BRO4NQ,"Don't waste your money! The film and audio quality are poor (well, you expect that from an old movie, probably a VHS to DVD copy). But what ruins it is that the subtitles are BURNT IN - not coded onto a separate track as one would expect - and they are in WHITE without an outline, therefore half the time - the SUBS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO READ because they are lost in the background!  This is a very amateur compilation.

Had the subtitles been encoded as soft subs, i.e. encoded onto a separate track, then one could have used a third party application to fix them. Will not buy from this seller again.",1411344000,2,600,4.300884955752212
