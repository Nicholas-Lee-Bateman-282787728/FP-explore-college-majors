6015287,1,B00FMXMRVA,"This could've been a cute 30 minute story for children even with the bad acting.  Unfortunately, this was turned into a feature with an hour of recycled scenery filler.  It was just a horrendous excuse of a movie.",1397779200,6,213,4.578947368421052
6015288,1,B00FMXMRVA,"Not even about a pony. The ONE horse in the movie looks like a draft cross.
The story started out good but it only gets dumber.
The horse hardly does anything and the so called secret to save the farm is really disappointing and only gets worse.
My son who's (9) and loves horses, didn't even like it.
And a lot of the movie is just nature clips with only music after a few minutes of stage type drama.
Too much pause (nature clips) between scenes.",1394064000,2,448,4.22093023255814
6015289,3,B00FMXMRVA,"A very mild family film that you'll either find extremely dull and slow or give it a thumbs up for clean family entertainment.

Teenager Juliet finds herself living with her widowed, stepmom and two mean step brothers on a ranch that's going under.  A businessman with a bad back offers her an out.  Juliet gets whomped on the head and suddenly can hear a horse talk to her.  Actually, anyone who gets horseshoed on the head can hear him.

The children liked the horse scenes- washing, riding, etc.  I liked the beautiful outdoor scenery.  The story and the humor are weak.  May I say inane; although, the children didn't mind.  There's a teenage friendship/romance between the girl and the businessman's son. The music vascillates between goofy and touching.  You hear the horse talking, but there's no Mr. Ed here, the lips don't move, and he tells every bad horse joke under the saddle.

It's not bad if your child loves horses.  Finally, I'm no sure who the girl and, especially, the horse are on the front cover or the horse on the back cover.  Marketing.",1393804800,,1060,4.664864864864865

6015291,2,B00FMXMRVA,"This came up recommended on my Roku... my daughters and I watch all things ""horsey "". Anyways it was painful for me but well liked by the young kids 5 year old understood most of the lame jokes. It was seriously a low budget film. No one changes clothes, it cuts to the same nature scenes way too frequently for several minutes at a time (it feels). The main actress obviously had no real experience with horses and so the one clip of her riding they use over and over!!! Also, can we make horse movies where the main plot isn't about losing the damn farm and trying to find a way to save the farm from the evil money hungry people I'm sick of this plot that reappears in nearly 80 percent of horse films.",1476057600,,705,4.1911764705882355

6015294,5,B00FMXMRVA,Great movie,1475539200,,11,5.0
6015295,1,B00FMXMRVA,"Of all the stupid, silly, boring, TOTAL waste-of-time movies I have ever seen, this one is probably the worst I've come across in my life! I am not exaggerating. Thank God it was ""free"" on prime. If you want to kick yourself for watching something beyond dumb, watch this. It is so utterly ridiculous, and horrible in every way, that I don't even have the words to describe the total silliness of this show. Maybe a REALLY young child can enjoy it. If you are over 5, don't bother.  This was PAINFULLY DULL! Don't be fooled by the description. It's not AT ALL what it seems.  By 5 minutes in , I was ready to take it off. I'm so sorry I didn't. I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't. It got worseand worse and worse.",1474243200,2,723,4.231884057971015

6015300,1,B00FMXMRVA,"Take a poorly written mash-up of Cinderella, Mr. Ed, and old Abbott & Costello routines (sliced nearly word-for-word from the original scripts) mix it with bad acting and you get a ""Horse's Ass"" oops, I mean "" A Pony Tale"". Don't waste your time - even the kids didn't like it.",1471910400,,277,4.450980392156863
6015301,1,B00FMXMRVA,Tons of scenery shots and some moderately bad acting. The acting I would expect out of a cheesy  horse movie but the writing is bad too. The joke about the deer crossing was all over social media a few years ago however the sign they show is a horse crossing sign. Horatio's voice is very cartoon like. Its a very strange horse movie might be cute for really little kids not one i would watch again.,1469577600,,399,4.25
6015302,5,B00FMXMRVA,"This is a great family movie. Its very funny and I hope that everyone enjoys it. I liked it, it's very funny.",1469577600,,109,4.0

6015306,3,B00FMXMRVA,"I was looking for a movie that was uplifting and this one came up.  I've not finished it yet but what I've seen so far is that it is an OK movie.  I LOVE the beautiful scenery and wondered why the girl never rode her horse through the beautiful trees, past the amazing waterfalls and instead only rode Horatio in small corral.  I'll finish the movie out of curiosity regarding saving her dad's farm and to view the beautiful scenery.  Oh and yeah sometimes the music did not fit the scenery..........it's a low budget, cheesy movie.",1467504000,,532,4.510416666666667
6015307,1,B00FMXMRVA,Whoever the director was he must have been really taken with the scenery.....very poor movie...would not recommend.....,1466899200,,119,6.0588235294117645

6015317,5,B00FMXMRVA,"Ok:  Hollywood needs to make more movies as THIS movie....Hilarious all the way through!!!!  I got all the jokes for once in a family comedy!!!!  Scenery filmed at was also all the way soothing, extravagant, and fabulously relaxing....common' horsy dancing to Jazz Music background????  What's NOT to LOVE about that particular scene????  I can go on to write more....I love the innocent acting styles from all actors....the Mom can may be improve a tad adding a bit of sassy....everyone else is fine the way the characters were written.",1463097600,,537,5.056818181818182
6015318,4,B00FMXMRVA,"As a follow-up to the immortal ""A Talking Cat!?!"", it would be understandable to think that ""A Pony Tale"" would fall far short of that modern classic's reputation as a masterpiece of anti-cinema. But even without the undeniably powerful presence of Oscar nominee Eric Roberts's voice work as Duffy The Talking Cat, ""A Pony Tale"" proves itself a worthy continuation of what we can only hope will be a long running string of Talking Animals With Extraneous Punctuation films. Preferably with a shared universe.

This is a film that dares to break down our expectations. A film that challenges as it entertains and, yes, educates. A film that delivers no fewer than four positively Brechtian montages of our lead ingenue and the titular talking pony--one of which runs the length of three different musical tracks, is followed by not one but two transitory shots of nature, and then returns to the horse pen, where no time, plot, or dialogue has passed since our previous visit via the aforementioned horse montage.

After the filet mignon that was ""A Talking Cat!?!"", ""A Pony Tale"" is admittedly merely a nice lobster dish. But it's a light, flaky, and perfectly buttered lobster.",1432512000,2,1178,4.944444444444445
6015319,1,B00FMXMRVA,"This movie is awful, even for a B movie!! The acting was horrible, the plot was predictable, and it recycled the same scenery footage over and over! I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",1430352000,,192,4.514285714285714

8617012,1,B00FMXMRVA,What a horrifying movie. Not even fit for children. I don't know who did the editing but they should have been fired!,1499904000,,117,4.363636363636363
8617013,2,B00FMXMRVA,"Pretty terrible really. Clean and possibly entertaining for young children. Lots of long, awkward music/scenery shot montages that have nothing to do with the film. Terrible acting. Over the top dumb dialogue.",1486339200,,209,5.5625
8617014,1,B00FMXMRVA,"A goofy film, not even for children, they'd become less intelligent if they watched. I don't mind well thought horse movies like Sea Biscuit and The Horse Whisperer, among others. This film is like a cartoon with humans.",1486252800,,220,4.815789473684211
8617015,1,B00FMXMRVA,I wanted to like it but I just couldn't. Before I even said anything my 9 year old made a comment of how poor the movie was! And she likes everything ... sorry :-(,1485820800,,163,3.823529411764706
