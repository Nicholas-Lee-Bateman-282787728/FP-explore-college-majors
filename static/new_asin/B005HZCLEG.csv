8473998,4,B005HZCLEG,"Excellent overvew of the garment industry in NYC.  Tended toward positive  bias of the labor unions and it would have been beneficial to have other manufacturing voices other than Russ Toggs spokesperson to  present that point of view. Wonderful archival footage and history especially the comparison between the Triangle Shirtwaist  Facfory fire and the fire and conditions in India and other offshore sites, particularly the Kathy Lee segment..
Compelling hour and 12 minutes and will serve as a basis for further discussion..",1420502400,,528,5.402439024390244
8473999,5,B005HZCLEG,"Wonderful! Not only is it very informative about the NYC garment district but about the US manufacturing industry.  If you want to learn more about the impact of NAFTA read the new book by Beth Macy (her first book), Factory Man.  It is about the devastation of the furniture industry and employment in Virginia & North Carolina.  Having worked in my youth in the garment Industry in VA and then about 15 years later the furniture industry, I know firsthand the impact. If more business and industrial heads had the ethics of Mr. Bassett to do whatever if he could to help protect his workers, the US would be a better place to work.  His company was family owned so he made decisions based on ethical treatment of his employee ""family"" that a company that had to ensure profit first would never make",1412208000,,800,4.573426573426573

A great lesson that we are all responsible for losing a vibrant high energy business to offshore manufacturing.",1376092800,,246,5.024390243902439
8474003,5,B005HZCLEG,"An excellent documentary...engaging and accessible. Do you remember the little ""Made in America"" labels on clothing? I do. It was a big deal. By the way, when those ILGWU gals start converging onto the screen with the big, rollers-and-hairspray dos to form one B-A knot of united singers I was whooshed back to my parents cotton-floral couch in White Plains, NY. Seriously, that little segment just ambushed me. I got teary-eyed out of nowhere!",1337126400,,444,5.013513513513513
