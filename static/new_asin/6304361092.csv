An impressive warning in times of mass surveillance: From mass survellance data the executive branch of government would have found the required basis to crush any not welcome message and the scientist behind it without -as in Turing's case- the scientist making any mistake.",1410048000,,478,5.386666666666667
7868687,1,6304361092,"I bought this tape from Amazon in the hopes that I would learn how the code was broken and how Alan Turing invented the digital age of the computer. Nothing doing. Instead I saw long scenes that should have been omitted or greatly abbreviated. Most likely the writers did not know how the code was broken and could not afford the technical scenery for their play. This tape was one of those that pop up as recommended by Amazon's computer. Every time I buy one of these  turkeys I have been disappointed. Never again. The whole tape is just British jibber jabber. In fact the method of hs suicide is not even mentioned. See Apple as in Mac. Derek Jacobi, whom I liked in ""Titanic: Blood and Steel,"" reprises his role of Claudius with his stammerings. Even though Turing did stammer, Jacobi's unconvincing attempt was not necessary to the plot as was not the phony nail-biting. These oddities brought a bad movie to the point of intolerability.

A much better documentary version from BBC, not a televised play, and aired on the Science Channel at least shows Turing's bombs and blonde goddesses, which are not even mentioned in this pile. The nasty treatment given him by the British system of injustice is delineated. Such miserable torture of such a hero from bigoted ingrates! I still want a biography that explains how the code was broken. Remember the Polish mathematicians had the basics of it figured out, and they are the ones who sent the enigma machine to England. Weeks later Hitler invaded Poland, and under the worst torture not one of them divulged what they knew.",1377216000,2,1578,4.713768115942029
7868688,3,6304361092,"The item arrived in good time.  The film is a fictionalised account of Dr Turing's life and doesn't pay a lot of attention to his computing genius or his morpjhogenisis work, however Derke Jacobi, as ever, lifts whatever he's in.  Worth it for him alone.",1334016000,,254,4.622222222222222
7868689,5,6304361092,"""Breaking the Code"" is a well acted and produced film based on the true story of a hero of the Second World War - Alan Turing. Some will only know the name Turing from the ""Turing Test"" which determines levels of artificial intelligence, but it was the work that Turing did in breaking the German ""Enigma Code"" that helped the Allies win the war. This film is couched in these events but more directly addresses the fact that Alan Turing was gay and that he was arrested, jailed and persecuted for his unashamed behavior. Despite being instrumental in saving the world from the ruthless Nazi world view of racial purity and social-cultural intolerance, once the war was over, the British government enacted a similar intolerance which ultimately ends in tragedy. Derek Jacobi delivers a masterful performance as Turing. It is a shame that this production is not available on DVD - I was thrilled to be able to find an excellent VHS copy!",1303516800,3,937,4.754601226993865
7868690,5,6304361092,"This movie about Mathematician Alan Turing and the breaking of the German Enigma Code during WWII is brilliant.  British actor Derek Jacobi plays the role of Turing with such commitment and believability that you unexpectedly find yourself accepting the character of Turing for all his unnaturalness while at the same time shunning the accepted beliefs of how people ought to be in post-WWII Britain.

I must admit that I knew next to nothing about Alan Turing.  This movie was a great introduction and summary into his life and heroic accomplishments.  Its always wonderful to see a movie production try its best at depicting a historical genius on screen.  Watching and hearing the dialogues Turing has in this film reminds you of just how much we may owe to this genius for our modern world of computer technology.  His research had to play a role in my being able to type this review today.

We need future people to continue questioning as Turing did, if a mind can exist without a body? We should also wonder, as did Turing, if God might be a Mathematician? There is enough proof here on this earth to argue for and against both.  Questioning is the key. We must continue to ask the questions that today go answer-less

One Courageous Movie about one honestly Curious Man!",1280448000,,1278,4.746606334841629
7868691,3,6304361092,"I first heard of ""Breaking The Code"" as a play, with the same actor, Derek Jacobi, in the PBS mini-series ""The Machine That Changed The World"" (from 1992). Part 1 of TMTCTW showed a couple excerpts of the play, and it gave me the impression that the story really got into Turing's theories about computing, explaining them in a way that people could understand. These ideas have validity even today. I looked forward to this same depth in the TV production, but was disappointed. The TV version was more of a ""message film"". It emphasized Turing's homosexuality, which no doubt is an important part of his life. No telling of it would be complete without talking about it, particularly how it caused conflict with his government, which motivated his suicide. His mastery of mathematics is used as a jumping off point to show what a brilliant man he was and what a shame it was for the British government to oppress him. A valid POV, but I wanted more. The video version of the TV production (perhaps it was just the PBS version) contained another disappointment (it was no fault of the seller). A key scene showing how Turing was inspired to come up with his first theory on computing was trimmed and spliced together such that the train of thought was entirely lost. I know because I saw the complete version of this scene in a clip on YouTube. It felt insulting. The message of the video editors was ""You don't understand mathematics. So we're not going to bore you with this."" It felt as though Turing's unique contributions to our world (aside from the fact that he helped the allies win WW II) were completely swept aside, and instead he was used as an archetype of the oppressed gay man. It reminded me that TV is often dumbed down. Still, it's a powerful story. The climactic, tragic ending makes it worth watching. Aside from it disappointing my expectations it's a good story from a generalist perspective.",1253404800,12,1915,4.668639053254438
7868692,3,6304361092,"The world of cryptography is fascinating.  So is the world of Derek Jacobi. It was a brilliant idea to offer a role of Alan Turing to Brother Cadfael.  I set my heart to see a struggle of human intellect against the  five rotating wheels.  I wanted to see how a mind of a genius beats a  U-Boat  fleet. Unfortunately, instead of it, I've got another gay rights  pamphlet.  A point that no one should be punished for victimless crimes  done in privacy is a very simple one, but not profound enough to keep  viewer entertained for two hours.",959040000,16,539,4.408163265306122
7868693,5,6304361092,"Having seen Breaking The Code for myself at the reccommendation of a few close friends, I came away with the conclusion that this is truly a heartbreaking drama, because, as Derek Jacobi's breathtaking portrayal of  Alan Turing showed me, this mathematical genius did not receive the laud he  so richly deserved for cracking the Enigma code and making a contribution  toward the winning of the Second World War, because he was so unfairly  exposed as a homosexual and crucified for it in the media, in much the same  way our Savior was crucified for doing the work he had been sent here by  His Father to do. The worlds of math and science lost a truly great figure  when Turing died in 1954.",930614400,16,692,4.5772357723577235
