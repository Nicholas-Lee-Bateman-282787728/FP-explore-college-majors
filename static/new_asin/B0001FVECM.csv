1996190,4,B0001FVECM,"I watched this movie with my friend who was raised and still lives in Torreon, we loved it.  My friend has many stories, told to him by his grandmother, who was from Chihuahua. Whether or not a movie by D.W Griffith ever existed, this one was certainly  well done.  Antonio Banderas did a wonderful job as Pancho Villa.  Villa was the epitome of good and evil.  He believed in Mexico and wanted to be the Robin Hood of his time, by the same token, it was too a heavy burden for any man to bear.  If you don't see this movie you are cheating yourself out of a wonderful piece of history.",1090022400,7,586,4.1875
1996191,1,B0001FVECM,"If you've been eying this movie, keep reading!  My girlfriend and I just watched this movie tonight.  We both like Antonio Banderas so it was pretty shocking that one of his movies was soooo bad.  About half way through, you start to realize that there is basically no plot, it's not exciting, the ""action"" that other reviews talk about totally sucks, I gave this movie one star!!  In fact I think it should give us our stars back!!!  We didn't even make it to the end, I fell asleep near with the end, which I've only done during 3 movies ever!  So anyone wanna buy a slightly used copy of Pancho Villa??",1088121600,7,605,4.357142857142857
1996192,4,B0001FVECM,"Antonio Banderas turns in a very strong performance as Pancho Villa, in this HBO movie.  The production values are excellent for a made-for-TV movie.  There are no heroes here.  Pancho Villa was a bandit and murderer long before he became a revolutionary general.  This movie accurately depicts that Villa was a cold-blooded killer as well as an incredibly charismatic leader of men.  The moviemakers were pretty cynical as well, insisting that all battles be fought in daylight so that they could be filmed.  Studio execs in New Jersey (where the movie industry was based in 1914, before it moved to Hollywood) edited the movie to delete Villa's criminal side and build up the idea that he was a folk hero - a sort of Mexican George Washington.
There's nothing in this movie about Villa's raid on Columbus, New Mexico, in which 26 American civilians were killed, or his murder of 16 American mining engineers captured on a train, or Gen. Pershing chasing him around Mexico for several months.  Those events occurred later, a year after the filming of the movie in which he played himself.
All-in-all, it is a good little movie, considering the modest budget it probably had.",1086134400,15,1175,4.874371859296482
1996193,1,B0001FVECM,"I am from Chihuahua, Mxico, Pancho Villa's land. I have taken history of my country and especially of the Mexican Revolution because Chihuahua and ""Los Dorados de Villa"" were the protagonists of that war. When I saw this movie I just could not see it as a movie based on the real history. I want to ask this questions: Where is the original movie that supposedly was taken in the Torreon's battle? Where is the movie that was exhibited in Nex York? Where is the copy of the movie that was given to Pancho Villa? Why is not there any Mexican or international researcher able to prove the existence of that film?",1084406400,6,610,4.455357142857143

1996203,4,B0001FVECM,"Amazing Actor Antonio Banderas stars in the leading role of PANCHO VILLA, in this true life depiction of Mexico's Revolutionary Leader who lead the Mexican people to believe in themselves again, in the face of internal tyranny. Viewed as a Mexican 'Robin Hood', a man who is '...for the people...' and for just retribution, he bravely goes about confronting the village lords and priestly manipulators who are self-serving, at the expense of the people. He broadens his horizons and strengthens his revolutionary reforms by allowing Hollywood film maker's to come and film his campaign, in progress. Thus, securing some much needed funds for his people and their cause of freedom. Hollywood film maker's and camera crew men, risked their lives to film actual footage and up-close battles, and gave documented film journalism, near home, a foreign start. The result of which put ""The Life of General Villa"" into the American Silent Film Era, which was widely received by the American populous and greatly, helped his cause. A single, disc DVD film, in color with black and white additives, in English with subtitles in: English, French and Spanish. Approximately 115 minutes running time with a 'Behind the Scenes' featurette and audio commentary by Oscar nominated Writer/Executive Producer, Larry Gelbart. Also, as a special treat, black and white inserts of PANCHO VILLA, as himself. A close to home campaign that even made Hollywood, take note. ""Quiet, quiet...., quiet on the set, and action!

1996209,4,B0001FVECM,"I was about to begin teaching a unit about the Mexican Revolution in my Spanish class. My students, high school seniors, groaned when I announced the new topic. I was hoping that this movie would help them connect to the subject more. All of my students' parents have given permission for their kids to watch R rated movies with the reassurance that 1) the movie would be educational and relevant and 2) that I would skip scenes with nudity.
  So I ordered this movie and previewed it. There were two scenes with a little adult content that I had to skip and I warned them that there was lots of violence (it WAS a Revolution, after all). None of my students objected, and the movie definitely peaked their interest in the topic! Of course I had discussion questions after each day's viewing.
  This movie is a fascinating story of Frank Thayer (Eion Bailey) who is making a movie focused on and starring Pancho Villa. Frank is torn between his morals and the commercial demands of the movie industry. John Reed (Matt Day) is a concerned journalist who becomes Frank's friend and, at times, conscience. Pancho Villa (Antonio Banderas) brilliantly plays the complex Mexican leader, equally loved and reviled.
  I recommend this movie for other high school teachers with the caveats of permission slips and a little editing.",1395187200,2,1322,4.8017621145374445

1996212,5,B0001FVECM,"Antonio Banderas shows us yet another aspect of his total versatility. This wonderful actor can play anything from a gay depressed, and  suicidal lover, to the heroic hero of Mexican history...He is the perfect selection for the movie about Hadrian the Roman emperor that John Bormann is directing.  In this movie about a movie being made about Villa, Banderas pulls off a masterful characterization showing us the polarity of humanity and brutality that surely was a part of Mexico's history.  He reveals that Villa was not a power mad leader, but only wanted to liberate his country for a time when a proper leader would come forth.  Unfortunately the price for this was his assassination.
As is usually the case, liberation has it's price.",1371081600,,742,4.959677419354839

1996214,5,B0001FVECM,"An interesting movie. Poncho Villa might have been depicted as a modern Robin Hood in the culture of the time.

1996226,5,B0001FVECM,"I have a bit of OCD and am a fan and financial supporter of PBS. When I saw the PBS documentary, ""The Storm that Swept Mexico,"" I wanted to learn more about this history of Mexico. Being from Texas, I had always grown up hearing about Pancho Villa but had no opinion nor interest since it seemed like a long time ago and not of my country. Little did I know that Mexico almost allied with Germany for a deal that would have included taking back Texas!

I wanted to know more about Pancho Villa since Mexican Politicians tried to wipe out references to him after Villa's death. I bought a PBS-like documentary of Mr. Villa but it was in Spanish. Sorry, no comprendo. I understood, poquito, that Pancho was good, yet bad. I bought a (used) book by Nellie Campobello written as in the eyes of a child -- and absolutely hated the book and started to develop the opinion that Pancho Villain (sic) muy malo.

Then I remembered that in both the PBS and Mexican documentaries there was mention of the DW Griffith movie, starring Pancho Villa himself. Neither iTunes nor Netflix had the movie to rent so I did the next best thing: I bought a Used copy on Amazon!!!

I'm giving it 5 stars. I liked it. Do you like the current type of Westerns? True Grit? Desperado?

The movie is totally entertaining, lots of action, lots of things blowing up. The horse riding action is some of the best I've seen. Antonio Banderas does a great acting job even if he can't get ugly enough to look like the real Pancho. The movie does portray the good, the bad, and the ugly of Pancho Villain.

I'm done. I got my history lesson satisfied by watching this movie. I realize it isn't an exact biography but it is as good a story as you're going to get about Pancho Villa. It was beautiful to ""history"" in color, see the scenery of Mexico, the old fashioned train with the Soldaderas (female soldiers) riding on top, the haciendas, references to wealthy foreign land owners, American interest in Mexico's oil, the costumes, media propaganda, and the beautiful faces of the Mexicans who still, today, profile their indigenous ancestry.

My used copy from Amazon, listed as ""Used - Good"" was in perfect condition. It was a bargain!

1996230,4,B0001FVECM,"This film was made by and for HBO. I had picked it up used at Amazon and then let it sit on shelf for over ayear before I finally watched it. It was more fun that I had expected it would be. This is not a dark and serious drama, oh to be sure it treats the subject of war and death with the reverence it deserves at times, but the movie revels in the character of Pancho Villa. At one moment a dark brutal man, next a fun loving trickster, then he is exceedingly generous and concerned for the welfare of others.  The story is mostly dramatization, quite the opposite of a documentary, but they do not pretend otherwise. We do not have enough source material to draw on to get a better picture of the events, and the real Pancho Villa films have been lost to history.
The movie is very loosely based on the story of an American film company reciving an offer, by the Mexican revolutionary general Pancho Villa, to film a real life battle. This would be the first time in history a battle was to be shown on film to the public. The general somehow felt that the theatrical presentation of the Mexican conflict could cause America to consider lifting its embargo on his ability to buy American guns. The battle footage is well enough received that the company determines to return with actors and crew to flesh it out into a movie. Villa needed his side of the story told, as the Rupert Murdoch of the day in the form of WR Hearst and his newspaper empire, was editorializing and spinning the news to affect public policy and demonize the General.
The film is very well made, the battle scenes exciting and authentic, costumes, sets, vintage vehicles are all very authentic. The actors take their roles seriously and a great effort is put forth to make this as believable as possible. Antonio Banderas is mesmerizing in the tough role of Villa, one hand gentle and friendly, raging the next moment. Alan Arkin has a role that could have been more developed, but he gives it much more than the role called for. The rest of the cast tries to keep up as best they can, but they are not as bad as some make it sound here, just outclassed.
All in all it was a pleasant diversion for the evening.",1311552000,2,2188,4.375921375921376

The fighting is fierce in this movie, and so is Villa's temper when he finds himself portrayed in a film about his ""dream"" to one day become president of Mexico and also his men having to wear Civil-War era uniforms just to make themselves look good in theaters.

1996235,5,B0001FVECM,"I am grateful for this film. It introduced me to a remarkable if not astonishing incident in film history and history in general -- but one that has become unknown. This film is quite adequate or solid in its acting and production values.

The writer/producer's commentary is in the top 10% with plenty of appropriate and thoughtful information on the subject itself instead of the usual hype and self congratulations and ha-ha-ha remember this and that.

On the other hand, if you are not intrerested very much in the history or Mexico or film making beyond the technical aspects then this may not grab you. It does not follow tightly the usual formula for suspense and drama in action storytelling. It is not an ordinary action flick or western.

The actual silent film that was made during the revolution about and including Villa, the most expensive film ever made up to that time, has been lost, as have been so many early films. So if you have a serious interest in history you will understand that the details in the film cannot stand for a documentary. There has to be a lot of fill-in and interpretation. Anyone with a serious interest in history will want to use the film as a yeast starter and go out and gather their own ingredients from academic sources and come up with their own best approximation of how this astonishing project back during the revolution might have played out in detail. There are a lot of good leads in the commentary as to the actual detailed facts of the project. For me this was a must.

If you happen to be interested in how films distort reality and heros, this is a very interesting back story that the film develops and this includes some moral dilemmas. Again, the commentary is very interesting here.",1230076800,2,1744,4.634304207119741

YES, antonio Banderas is handsome, spanish and swaggers around alot. YES, Pancho Villa was an amazing historical character that fought the repressive totalitarian regiems of Diaz and Huerta for ten turbulent years of the mexican revolution. YES, This film is stupid hollywood pulp made to make money and the same old stuff repeated over and oevver again. Also, why does every film have William Randolph Hearst as the ""the bad guy"".

1996248,4,B0001FVECM,"When making this kind of historical fiction, too many people expect that it is going to be a documentary; it isn't anything like that. This film is an interesting, ambiguous study of how perceptions can change by being validated by something bigger than they: something like the movies, which  in itself is an absurd premise, but something that we live with every day. I wish the characters in the flim were better referenced, as I know D.W. Griffith, Charles Rosher, Christy Cabanne, and others are part of the plot as in real life, but I couldn't tell you who they were in the production, as their attributions went by so fast. Villa as a villain and charismatic leader of the masses has a built-in paradox to it, as does the documentary format in film in any case.  It is a pity that the original film doesn't exist any longer (along with 90% of silent film that was made, unfortunately), especially as it was under D.W. Griffith's auspices, when the rest of his oeuvre exists down to the last reel.",1137283200,5,1002,4.592178770949721
1996249,4,B0001FVECM,"Antonio, my hat is off to you.  Who could have guessed how good you really can be?  I have been watching movies for over 50 years, and never have I seen a better job of portraying a multifaceted character while never for one second letting go of his true identity.  Bravo!  As to the movie itself, it exhibits production values and attention to detail far beyond the Hollywood norm, and unheard of in television studio production.  The history, the hardware and the costumes, were all excellent.  Unfortunately as one of my fellow reviewers has already pointed out, Senior Banderas' inspired performance, the highly polished production, the good presentation of factual history and the stellar performances of many of the minor supporting actors carried the entire production.  The script was poorly conceived and crafted.  The plot line was confused, confusing and lack luster.  The direction was safe and adequate, but not nothing more.  Worst of all, the other lead actors were either uninspired or just not really all that good at what they do.  Next time, HBO, spend a buck or two on a director who knows the wide screed and on supporting leads who can carry their weight.  Still, this is not a horrible picture.  Senior Banderas' Tour-de-force performance and the highly polished accuracy of the production make it well worthwhile.  I don't think that the movie's intent of showing an accurate picture of the early days of Hollywood was fulfilled.  However, they got the history right, not always an easy thin to do.",1103068800,15,1522,4.937007874015748

Though I was never a fan of his - Antonio Banderas was awesome in this! The production value was on par with the major motion picture industry, this isn't your low budget 'made for tv' flick.

1996251,1,B0001FVECM,"I was relatively pleased with this film until the third act. Then it really turned to crap. What's up with the makers of this flick having Villa kill a widow on camera in front of Reed and Thayer? These are historical people who really lived and there's no evidence to support that event. This was a decent historical film. Why suddenly use fiction to trash Villa, Reed, and Thayer? The film also asks us to believe that Thayer never spoke to Pancho again after 1914 because of this incident. Since the incident is B.S. that aint true. I guess the filmakers wanted to make a point about how wrong it is for Hollywood to lie about the truth so they lied about the truth. That's too bad. This was a pretty decent film up until that point. Then the film lost it's direction. History went out the window and the film lies, then delivers a sermon about lies in film (!), gives us some gibberish about the dead woman being a symbol of the death of the revolution, flashes forward 9 years, flashes back, then forward, then ends with flashing back!

In addition to my disappointment, I felt the movie was marginally mediocre! Bandares was O.K. but the movie lacked any depth of character or story line.

My advice is to save your money!",1093824000,7,423,4.780821917808219
1996253,3,B0001FVECM,"And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself starts off as a very interesting and exciting movie based on the true story of Pancho Villa financing his revolution by selling the movie rights to an American film company. The fact that the events really happened makes for a somewhat comical and unbelievable story, and overall very interesting because it is true. Eventually though, the story gets told, but the movie does not end.

Antonio Banderas was superb, and when his character is not featured for the last part of the movie, the quality of the movie suffers. He delivers the right combination of joker and heartless tough guy while maintaining a leadership quality. This film may not be the best way to learn about the Mexican revolution led by Pancho Villa, but it is an interesting point of view.",1092009600,4,796,4.810218978102189
1996254,4,B0001FVECM,"In reply to 'Not Real' -- I'm not for certain where or if any copies of ""The Life of General Villa"" (1914) still exist (it was made for American not Mexican auidiences at the time afterall), but I have seen at least one behind the scenes photo of a cameraman with bodyguards with Villas forces.

 If you can find a back issue (August/September 2003) of True West magazine you will find an article about both the HBO movie & the true story behind it, which doesnt differ much from the film starring Banderas.

 You will also find an article with timeline & photos about Villa, including a famous picture of he & Zapata riding into Mexico City on Dec. 16,1914; in which Villa is wearing a full military uniform which is thought to be the same costume Hollywood had him in their film.

 Not Real!!, May 14, 2004

 Reviewer: Everardo Hern?ndez Sagarnaga (Delicias, Chihuahua, M?xico) -

 I am from Chihuahua, M?xico, Pancho Villa's land. I have taken history of my country and especially of the Mexican Revolution because Chihuahua and ""Los Dorados de Villa"" were the protagonists of that war. When I saw this movie I just could not see it as a movie based on the real history. I want to ask this questions: Where is the original movie that supposedly was taken in the Torreon's battle? Where is the movie that was exhibited in Nex York? Where is the copy of the movie that was given to Pancho Villa? Why is not there any Mexican or international researcher able to prove the existence of that film?",1090713600,4,1495,4.544776119402985
1996255,4,B0001FVECM,"Maybe it's all true, maybe it's partially true; but in any case, And Starring Pancho Villa... is a very satisfying movie.  But the difference between a 2 star rating and a 4 star rating here is solely due to the presence of Antonio Banderas in the lead role.

It sounds like such a cartoonish idea, moviemakers tagging along with an army of revolutionaries.  But then in the silent movie era of 1914, New Jersey actually was the movie making capital of the world.

The subtext to all of this is that through his experience and relationship with General Villa, his erstwhile film producer Frank Thayer matures from young gofer to influential executive.  But that is nothing more than a plot device.  When Banderas is not on screen, the movie loses a step or two.  He gives a superlative performance that is worthy of such a controversial (and underrated) historical figure.
