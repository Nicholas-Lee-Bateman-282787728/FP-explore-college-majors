1333093,3,B00003UC9F,"recently brought this DVD and contrary to what people have said my copy definitely does have 2 versions of the film on it - the cut version and the uncut night child version (it is not stated on the cover thou), although I admit that it certainly not re-mastered and the quality is not great",1208044800,7,291,4.3090909090909095
1333094,1,B00003UC9F,"The front cover says that there are two versions on the DVD. There are not. And, the film has been cut in two places! The key scene (where the mother dies in the bath) is one scene that is not shown! On the back cover, it says 'Digitally Remastered' but, again, it is not! It is a very poor copy from a VHS! All of this is totally dishonest and it is against the law for any company or individual to give such a false description. Those consumers in America who have bought it should complain to the relevant legal body in America about ""Substance"", the label who have released this atrocious DVD. I wouldn't be surprised if it was one individual copying the film in a back room! I am in England and so don't know where to complain. Anyone who bought it should, like myself, get your money back! DO NOT BUY THIS TERRIBLE, ILLEGAL DVD!",1189728000,43,834,4.284810126582278
1333095,3,B00003UC9F,"Dispite what Amazon is advertising above, this is not a Two Version DVD. You will only receive the U.S. Theatrical version of this movie.  The Uncut ""Night Child"" version is not on the DVD.

The movie is ok although it is a bit odd and the latter part of the movie is hard to follow.",1189036800,20,283,4.127272727272727
1333096,1,B00003UC9F,"I am not sure what possessed me to buy this travesty. I think it was because the I enjoyed the Musical Movie ""Oliver"" so much, that I wanted to see Mark Lester in a role reversal. There are so many flaws to this movie that I do not have the time or the inclination to list them all. This particular issue appears to have been copied from an very Old VHS tape that had been played a couple of hundred times. As far as the production values go, the entire movie has the feel of an Ed Wood B- movie. The script, the filming, the music, and the acting are all 2nd and 3rd rate. As far as suspense goes, there is none. To give you an example of bad production, about half way through the movie, the dialog stops and the so called suspenseful music begins as if something frightening may occur. This continues as we watch Father, son, and step-mother have a dinner in a restaurant. Just as suddenly the music started for no apparent reason, it stops and the dialog resumes. It was like the director had this suspense music commissioned but had no real place to use so he just threw it in. Ed Wood would have thought that to be Oscar worthy....and oh yes,  Mark Lester is about as believable as an evil child as McCauley Caukin was in the Good Son. The audience laughed at that movie and I am sure they did also at this one when it was first released.",1188604800,6,1344,4.209302325581396
1333097,4,B00003UC9F,"What The Peeper Saw, aka. ""Night Child"", is the story of a troubled boy with a genius IQ, who, upon his arrival home from boarding school, immediately begins to plant the seeds of suspicion and distrust between his father and new stepmother. Marcus, played by Mark Lester, proves to be an extremely dangerous child, who won't hesitate to kill anyone he simply dislikes. There is a great deal of sexual tension between Marcus and his young stepmother (Britt Eklund). The ending is a total surprise. I believe that you'll find this film interesting as well as somewhat disturbing.",1184284800,10,578,4.908163265306122
1333098,3,B00003UC9F,"A beautiful woman makes the torturous discovery that her angelic-looking  stepson murdered his real mother, and has good reason to believe that the  evil child may have similarly sinister plans for her.  What at first may  seem like a cheap, sleazy exploitation flick(that title doesn't help much),  turns out to be a lurid, exciting thriller that is more concerned with plot  and character than supplying cheap thrills and is all the better for it.  The film is aided by a strong cast, including Mark Lester(the little waif  in the award-winning musical ""OLIVER!"") who is chillingly good  and believable every second as the disturbed youngster. Lester's rendition  of THE BAD SEED is far more believable than Macaulay Culkin's in 1993's THE  GOOD SON. The beautiful and sexy Britt Ekland also does well with her role  as the bedeviled stepmother. Luis Cuadrado and Harry Waxman's striking  photography of the Spanish locations also adds much.",968803200,21,943,5.125
7919443,4,B00003UC9F,"The title makes this more lurid than it actually ends up being. Not to say that it's not one of those thrillers that runs on an unhealthy vibe. It definitely feels like you're dealing with some real crazy people. In general, it's exactly the kind of movie they just don't make anymore. It's a bit like Night Warning, Shadow of a Doubt, Twisted Nerve, or Julie Darling. They're all murder at home drama thrillers. What the Peeper Saw has a few tricks up it's sleeve that I don't want to spoil. It's why I've been vague about things. In general, it's pretty decent for Britt Ekland. I'm sure all aging Britt Ekland fans will agree. I'm young though. She still does a good job. She seems like she could be in genuine peril the whole time. Also shows she's more than a champ bikini wearer. As a cheap DVD, it's well worth it",1484179200,,820,4.366013071895424

7919447,5,B00003UC9F,"I knew before I purchased this film, that it was twisted, cheesy and over the top in many ways. I bought it exactly for those reasons. The balance the director achieved between campy, sick & twisted, and entertaining was well done. Check out IMDB.com for a review. If you like stories with off-the-beaten path type plots, this is worth a view.",1451520000,,343,4.639344262295082
7919448,4,B00003UC9F,"WHAT THE PEEPER SAW (aka: NIGHT CHILD) begins w/ the death of a woman in a bathtub. Next, we are introduced to Elise (Brit Ekland- THE WICKER MAN, ENDLESS NIGHT) and her young stepson, Marcus (Mark Lester- OLIVER!, WHOEVER SLEW AUNTIE ROO?). Marcus is the son of the woman who died in the tub. When Marcus' father, Paul re-enters the picture, Marcus displays strange behavior, and bizarre things start happening.  As time goes by, Elise starts to suspect that Marcus isn't as innocent as he appears, and that he just might be dangerous. Her worst fears are confirmed after a visit to Marcus' boarding school. WTPS is a classic example of early 70s cinema, packed w/ mod atmosphere and several opportunities to see Ms. Ekland naked. It's also a very good psychological thriller w/ a supremely twisted ending! Lester plays his disturbed role perfectly. Some of the more suggestive scenes between Lester and Ekland are certainly disturbing by today's standards. I kept saying to myself: ""Nope, they'd never get away w/ that now!"" ...",1401580800,7,1030,4.919540229885057
7919449,3,B00003UC9F,"It's weird, these films, a certain amount of nudity or sexuality in them, and how many off  beat companies are involved in distributing, I suppose. And has become almost like a game, trying to find them and trying to find the complete versions, more than the films themselves. This is a pretty straightforward movie, about one boy as a walking pathology. It is bizarrely slow, almost stately, with Mark, trading on the OLIVER! image in reverse. The boy  likes perverted sex, and likes to kill things. For anybody who wants to see a perfect face boy who likes a certain amount of gruesomeness, it is strangely entertaining. But, for whoever he is in this film, he appears not to get much excitement out of it. The face of the actor at this stage of his life seems still frightened and jumpy, and close to tears. As well as bored.
Not that it's a bad film, because it isn't. Lilli  Palmer has a small thankless role in which she exhibits ice and embeds stupidity like nobody's business, an excellent hollow shell example of psychiatrists. That Marcus fools her is not unexpected. Though she seems more than fooled, as in complicit. Perhaps, just simple minded.
The novelization is  braver, because it's just words. Of course. It's a typical British suspense film, as they made in the 60s. The actors are recognizable, and guessing about when the film was made is part of the whole thing. I wonder what happened to Mark's career? At one time, supposedly he was the most bankable actor in the world, according to the commentary track of EYEWITNESS. A commentary track, so funny, It's worth the price of the movie.  I have read the distribution has ended. Another collectors classic? Marcus does some things in the film, that would not be memorable, except it's Mark Lester.
The pathology here involves parents, especially a mother and step mother. It is a British film, and yet it has  foreign all over it, filmed apparently in Spain. I wanted to always hear them talking another language, since British films, for the most part, are not considered foreign by us. This one does. Britt Ekland is properly destroyed by Marcus in various ways, including a clever trick of his that leads to the films ending, the resolution of which is oddly satisfying, not a copout.
Who knows if Mark had an agent who selected wrong films for him, or much of this was his decision, because he liked horror films, such as WHO SLEW AUNTIE ROO? And wanted to cash in all he could. However it happened, it was a lonely child he always portrayed, then a lonely teenager, and a lonely young adult.
He never seemed to lose a particular quality of that in his films. That perplexed glaze, the sadness of eyes, and hint of trembling lips were a sort of trademark. It's all so long ago, but it seems like a certain lonely desperation enveloped him as an actor. Who knows, he may been having the time of his life, this could be just the way he looked, nothing else. But for those who saw the movie of  Lionel Bart's OLIVER! when ourselves young, these films, though I've collected them, make  me rather sad. I just remember Oliver Twist , lip-synching and asking where is love? But it was a movie, and so are these. Dealers in films like dealers in books and television shows too, just want to make some money, like everybody does, however, there is a lot wrong with using a child is a commodity.
But a lone small spirit still envelopes and illuminates all of his films. All of which are worth seeing and keeping. Especially for those there at the beginning, when we were all novices of life, and miss it so.",1267833600,,3574,4.590909090909091
