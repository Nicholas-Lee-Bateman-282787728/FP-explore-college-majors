4234197,1,B003ZJ955Y,"The Seekers Guide to Harry Potter is not what I hoped it would be.

The direction is cheesy and comical at best; the information is sparse; and the extra footage is overused and slightly ridiculous. The professor is certainly qualified, but the way she is portrayed makes her seem like a quack.

Here are some prime examples.

While shooting B-roll film (filler, or extra footage), she swung a sword around pretending to fight with it. That exact footage was used at least five separate times, in slow motion, with melodramatic music playing in the background.

Instead of using a straight-forward documentary style, the filmmakers used a corny method to imply that she was magical. The professor would fade slowly in and out of a scene, as if by magic. Instead of adding an interesting layer of depth or meaning, it was a poor way to distract from what she said -- the entire reason why someone would watch the DVD in the first place.

During scenes when she practiced ... something -- it was never specified or explained what she was doing -- she drew pentagrams in the air (a five-pointed star), a small section would be in English, but most of the ceremony was in a language we didn't understand or nothing was said at all. Instead of being interesting or clearly having something to do with the Harry Potter series, it made her look a little nutty and us uncomfortable. Any context would have made it enlightening and possibly interesting.

There are other examples, but I don't want to waste anyone's time. If you buy this, please note that I warned you.",1295136000,9,1560,4.675182481751825
4234198,4,B003ZJ955Y,"The Seeker's Guide to Harry Potter is a fascinating analytical approach to the wildly popular Harry Potter fiction series by JK Rowling. Dr. Geo Trevarthan, the researcher and narrator behind the documentary, has certainly done her homework in this in-depth exploration of the history and symbolism lurking behind-the-scenes throughout the novels. The Harry Potter series is embraced by an audience of all generations and the adult fans of the series in particular will find this film insightful and thought-provoking. Dr. Trevarthan's passion for the world of Harry Potter is evident in her enthusiastic presentation and her thorough research. Harry Potter fans, literature enthusiasts and anyone interested in the layers that make great fiction will enjoy this entertaining and educational documentary.",1294272000,2,804,5.708333333333333
4234199,4,B003ZJ955Y,"Dr. Geo Trevarthan, who hails from a background of shamanism and mysticism herself, explores the origins of the Harry Potter stories and symbols, taking fans on a fascinating and scenic journey deep into the heart of the places and ideas that inspired J.K. Rowling. A must for Harry Potter enthusiasts!",1291161600,,302,5.06
4234200,4,B003ZJ955Y,"There can be no denying the phenomenon that is J. K. Rowling's `Harry Potter' series. Few tales have so captured the imaginations of children and adults alike--spanning entire continents and introducing magic to the masses.

But there is more to discover within these stories than simple spells. There is instead a deep-rooted history (reflecting a myriad of medieval influences, pagan symbolism and religious meanings). And these are all explored within the 'Seekers Guide To Harry Potter'.

Based upon the studies of Dr. Geo Trevarthen--who also serves here as a competent narrator--the film dissects the world of Rowling and her characters, wishing to explain their sources of inspiration. And it succeeds, offering a compelling study of the past. Trevarthen provides credible research (as well as enthusiastic explanations) and no elements feel forced. The facts do not rely on obscurities. They are instead logical, allowing the viewer to accept them without concern. This is not a vague portrayal. It is instead a careful examination and all will approve of what it details. The film works.

It does have one flaw, however. The `Seekers Guide' features an abundance of landscape shots. While these can be used to strengthen the experience, they are often too indulgent. The moments linger, emphasizing an already deliberate pace. Viewers will find themselves less enamored with the scenery as the movie progresses--and this is an unfortunate frustration.

It is not enough, though, to deter the audience. The historical connections will still compensate and the film will please. For those who enjoy the novels, this is a worthy companion.",1288569600,3,1645,5.33976833976834
4234201,4,B003ZJ955Y,"In this DVD Dr Geo Trevarthan explores the world of Harry Potter that JK Rowling created, which is mostly a combination of paganism and Christianity.  Dr. Trevarthan's interest in Harry Potter began when she was going through a rough time in her life and she would read the novels over and over as an escape and comfort since she grew up in a pagan and shamanistic household.

She compares modern day Edinburgh with many of the locations in the HP novels, from the boarding schools to little shops where you can purchase many odd items.  Throughout the DVD the Dr. also shows us pagan rituals she practices in her home.  She also reads passages from various Harry Potter novels.

Although the books are fantasy, the symbolism in them is universal.  Fights against good and evil, a regular person finding out he's something special, making sacrifices to achieve our goals and dreams, self-growth, letting go, learning to trust, and believing in something beyond ourselves.

The books are filled with mythology, numerology, even the periodic table!  That really intrigued me.  At the core of these books though we can all learn something about ourselves and humanity as a whole.  Although it did drag a bit here and there as the host walked around and stared off into the distance, I found this film to be very interesting, whether you're a Harry Potter fan or not.",1288396800,3,1363,4.8111587982832615
4234202,4,B003ZJ955Y,"This DVD works on a number of levels.  It's an English major's analysis of the books, and also a personal, first-person commentary by Dr. Geo Travarthen on her own relationship with the stories and their mythical content.  In addition, it gives us a tour of Edinburgh, perhaps the most photogenic of all cities, whose medieval spires certainly inspire magic.  Same with the dramatic countryside and cloud formations, all lending a theatricality to the proceedings.  But the real power of this DVD is Travarthen's skill at placing the stories squarely within our shared history, as well as British literary tradition.  It should be no surprise to anyone who loves the Harry Potter books that they tap into a deep reservoir of cultural and spiritual memory, perhaps innate within us, maybe learned along the way.  If you're a Harry Potter fan (or Joseph Campbell or Carlos Castaneda) and you're someone who thinks analysis enhances the enjoyment of fiction rather than destroying it, this DVD is for you.",1288310400,4,1002,5.042424242424242

4234204,1,B003ZJ955Y,"I made the mistake of watching this garbage on Netflix while browsing for documentaries on outre topics.

It mostly consists of some New Age tart trying to convince the audience of how deep and spiritual she is by pontificating on the obvious mystical symbolism in Rowling's universe. She shamelessly cites her lineage in a ""Scots-Irish tradition"" - that apparently utilizes the rituals from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn complete with the Hebraic names of God - as the basis for her expertise. What little content there is interrupted with pointless segues of her dancing, performing rituals, and making significant glances at the camera to further convince you that she is a truly mystical being.

Watch only if you feeling in the mood for a bit of schadenfreude.",1341100800,6,773,4.984496124031008
4234205,1,B003ZJ955Y,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY/TIME ON THIS. If you are a fan of The Harry Potter series you will learn very very little from this video. I believe the woman is more interested in pushing her own agenda than exploring JK Rowling's wonderful tale. Her perfoming a dance on the video was embarassing along with her reclining position while she speaks is just strange. The breaks for emphasis are awkward. This is an extremely amaturish self promotion piece of rubbish. I fully understand JK Rowling's and Warner Bros. disclaimer on this. I would too!,1333584000,11,541,4.76595744680851
4234206,1,B003ZJ955Y,"Keeping it simple: This is NOT what 90% of the typical Harry Potter Fans think it is.

My daughter is a highschool student and has grown up on Harry Potter, and we bought this as a digital download as it seemed like an entertaining adjunct to the movies (which we have also seen).

Unfortunately, I cannot see how any child under the age of 15 would have the capacity or interest to digest the referneces the author casts about.

Though I truly do appreciate the potential of deeper literary analysis of great works like J.K. Rowling's, this documentary is cheaply done, lacking in any real substance befitting of its length on the screen (it literally and audibly drones on - the background music is almost too much to stand), and just plain painful to watch in parts.  I commend the author for her passions for this subject - I would expect it to be offered as a college course and perhaps more as a work of writing - but I was really shocked to find that it has made the cut on Amazon to be listed along side these other works.

I would love to get a refund if one was possible.",1316304000,3,1081,4.3316831683168315
4234207,4,B003ZJ955Y,"As a trained magician I easily saw everything she was doing from her ceremonial magical demonstrations to the symbolism she thoughtfully works through. She is rock solid in her background of the subject. I heartily recommend this to anyone who has a basic understanding of ceremonial magic regardless of the tradition (Pagan, Christian, whatever. Magic isn't a religion.)

Now to why I demoted this lovely piece a star.  It isn't a very polished production and for some folks that would seriously detract from the information. If you didn't understand something about magic I think the magical demonstrations would be confusing.  It is clear to me that she is trying to create a magical atmosphere and show how modern magic is done but there is not explanation as to what she is doing. In addition none of the rituals she demonstrates have anything to do with the thesis she is presenting. Most of what she shows are simple banishing rituals to clear unwanted energies from a ritual space.

If you have a background in magic you should enjoy the material. It is a little slow getting started but worth it. If you don't have a background in magic I suggest you just let the ceremonial pieces wash over and not try to splice them into anything; they won't fit. I am really impressed with the correlations between HP and real magical practice and for this alone the movie is worth the time in my estimation.",1315094400,4,1404,4.741803278688525
4234208,4,B003ZJ955Y,I am a huge Harry Potter fan and I did like this DVD because it exposed some secrets that I wouldn't have even known were secrets unless I watched this DVD. The insight to her mind was also fascinating to me.,1307059200,2,208,4.097560975609756
4234209,1,B003ZJ955Y,This documentary was shabby at best.  The film looks as though it was put together by a 13-year old stoned out of their gourd.  The content was poorly presented and I'm finding it hard that Geo Trevarthen is a Dr. of anything other than being a self proclaimed shaman.,1305417600,,268,4.448979591836735
4234210,1,B003ZJ955Y,"I watched this elsewhere (it has low ratings there as well) and i must say, i quite surprised at the lacking quality and content of this documentary.
I'm not an avid harry potter fan, but have some exposure to the books and movies, and i must say, this film has little to do with the series. In actuality it is a film that comes off as pretentious and self-indulgent. The majority of its run time is spent on, what i can only imagine is, someone's first attempt at cinematography. Meaning, you get long, drawn-out, scenes that use horrible tricolor filters and special post-product effects that are either used too much or have no purpose and all which is accompanied by boring repetitive music. These scenes are the real content of this film, the few bits of ""filler"", if you will, are the good Dr rambling on about generalities that could be said about any series, not just harry potter. Even worse, these ramblings often contain little to no factual information, but rather are just monologues about her personal (and general) interpretations on the harry potter series.
In effect, what you get is roughly 20 minutes of actual ""content"" (term applied very loosely) in the 80 minutes of run time. And not to sound paranoid, but i find any review that gives this higher than 3 stars to be very suspect, as even a forgiving reviewer would be hard pressed to find anything in this ""documentary"" that would warrant a higher rating.

And on an tangent topic, what is Trevarthen's doctorate in? I looked on her site but don't see it explicitly stated anywhere. Actually, at the time of this writing, the page listing her qualifications is listed as ""under construction"". Though i do see her thesis online, ""Spiritual Crisis in Early Irish Literature and Later Folk-Life"", but i am not sure if that is her doctorate thesis (if it is, that is a bit scary, the literacy level doesn't go above high school).

Edit: Not to sound paranoid, but it's obvious the last 3 reviews by ""June Stirling"", ""Dan Alexander"", and ""Smiley M"" are planted reviews by someone who is either directly involved with the production and/or distribution of this ""Documentary"" or someone who was hired by them. Look at their reviews, the literacy level is the same, notice the ""!!"" pattern repeated in two of the three reviews, as well as the use of the word ""secret"" in all three. Even worse, look at their review history. For it being three separate individuals, there is significant overlap in their review history, not only in the titles they've reviewed but the timing of the reviews as well.
It's a sad state of affairs when you have to hire people to post fake positive reviews on amazon to offset the negative ones. I'll be reporting their reviews, but who knows if amazon is willing to take action in such cases.",1304726400,5,2787,4.697341513292433
4234211,1,B003ZJ955Y,J.K. Rowling was pretty clear about the whole series being a christian allegory in the end. This is an almost painfully obvious theme in the Deathly Hallows. It is more or less swept under the rug in this painfully slow and self indulgent peice. Much more to do with Paganism than Harry Potter.
