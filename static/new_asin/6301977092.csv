399670,5,6301977092,"A great little musical staring Jane Powell,good family fun.  I especially love the scenes with Bobby Van dancing along the streets,Ann Millers dancing is just great and of course Janes beautifull voice, in all a great film. The tranfer is very good. So far the Warners Archive films,  I have purchased have been excellents prints. Arrived ahead of time.if only the price was a little cheaper,as I am a pensioner and have to wait so I have enough to buy these great classics. How about it warners can we have Three Daring Daughters on DVD,also the Nelson Eddy and Jeannete Mcdonald fims along with the rest of the Esther Williams Films. When are we going to see The Swan with Grace Kelly,and the Howard Keel version of Rose Marie. I am wrapped that so much is becoming available. Amazon please make available Lovely To Look at. I always check when this is going to happen. Also please release the Great Caruso, the Student Prince,and Serenade staring Mario Lanza. Well done Warners.

Her devoted and loving fans want them soon.

399672,5,6301977092,"""Small Town Girl"" is thoroughly delightful and Jane Powell is charming.  I had always enjoyed her movies when I was young so I bought this so our teen-age granddaughter could get a taste of good clean movies.  She found it delightful also.  Ann Miller's dance around the instruments is a classic.",1231977600,4,296,4.764705882352941
399673,5,6301977092,"When will MGM get their finger out and release ""RICH YOUNG & PRETTY"" and ""SMALL TOWN GIRL"" on DVD, after all this is the 21st century, we now have a better viewing medium than VHS tapes.

These would have to be two of the least known but best loved movies that came out of the '50's.

For those that haven't yet seen these movies, beg borrow or steal them to see great dancing, fantastic singing, and so so acting, but are must have in any collection.",1218585600,4,451,4.232558139534884

399675,3,6301977092,"This is another MGM musical in which you just ignore the plot and enjoy the numbers. Ann Miller - ""I Gotta Hear That Beat""...Nat King  Cole - ""My Flaming Heart""...Bobby Van ""Take Me to  Broadway"". Jane Powell was getting too old to continue playing the  innocent maiden, but as usual turns in a good performance despite the  material. Billie Burke, Glinda of the WIZARD OF OZ and Fay Wray, of KING  KONG fame round out the cast.",967766400,37,428,4.5064935064935066

399795,3,6301977092,This is a great Jane Powell movie.  We loved the singing and dancing.  Too bad that they didn't make it a widescreen format and do a better job with the audio.  There are many places where the audio is difficult to understand.  It might of helped to offer subtitles for those with hearing difficulties.  All in all the audio isn't up to the quality of the video and if you are going to charge almost $20.00 for the DVD then it should be better.,1407110400,,444,4.238095238095238
399796,5,6301977092,"This movie takes me back to the era I grew up in. I love Jane Powell and Farley Granger was at his handsome best. When I saw the ""Tony Awards "" and Hugh Jackman started hopping to the tune ""Take Me To Broadway"", I knew immediately what it was from. Bobby Van was so good, too. That's when I ordered the movie. One for me and one for my sister. Jane's voice and her dancing were absolutely great. I love, love, love this movie. It's such  a happy uplifting little movie. I love the old musicals. It was a nicer time then .",1405209600,,521,4.058252427184466

399800,3,6301977092,"Fairly ordinary 1950s musical, but lifted by the brilliance of Ann Miller working with Busby Berkley. Not one of the greats, but a worthy film to add to a collection.",1387584000,,166,4.566666666666666
399801,5,6301977092,"Was this ever a surprise discovery.  A delightful cast and a fun, upbeat story.  The show stoppers are two magnificent dance routines credited to Busby Berkley.  Bobby Van bounces his way through ""Take Me To Broadway"" that is a visual sight of the highest order.  Nat King Cole gets a shot at a ballad that ended up being an Academy Award nominee.  Ann Miller is in stellar form for two production numbers.  And you can hardly beat the singing of Jane Powell.

A superb production that leaves the viewer upbeat.  Shot in Technicolor and it features one of the later performances by long time actress Billie Burke.",1385769600,2,613,4.663551401869159
399802,4,6301977092,"I purchased this DVD because I've seen clips of Bobby Van's hop dance and wanted to see the whole thing.  It is a fun musical, and that dance is amazing.  It is not the best film of Hollywood's golden era of musicals but well worth watching.",1381449600,,241,4.217391304347826

399885,3,6301977092,"This was a different take off from the Nancy Gaynor and Robert Taylor version.  It was a lot more refreshing in the charactor of the small town girl in this movie.  Jane Powell did much better acting as the love interest than Gaynor.  However, both movies are worth having in your DVD Library.",1366156800,,293,4.490566037735849
399886,5,6301977092,"I really like this movie and enjoy seeing it.  Only problem I have
is that after playling it, the movie faded and I can't get it to play
on my DVD player.  That is disappointing.  Seems like the
only place I can get the movie is by ordering it online.",1364515200,,251,3.98
399887,1,6301977092,"Unfortunately we were not as lucky as some and have had no luck in obtaining a copy of Small Town Girl that would play in any of our machines or computers.  Amazon was very kind in their response to the situation and have exchanged copies of the disc for us.  None of them worked and it basically came down to their finally refunding our money.  They were not able to give any suggestion as to why this DVD would not play in any of our machines.  So, be prepared that the DVD of Small Town Girl may not work with your equipment. Good luck.",1327449600,2,539,4.153846153846154
399888,5,6301977092,"If you are a fan of Ann Miller, this is a must for your musical collection.
She is at her best in this production.
A happy musical to cheer the heart.
A new digital copy of this musical would have been appreciated. However, I am grateful Warner Bros. have released a lot of these wonderful films in their archive collection",1312848000,,323,4.4
399889,3,6301977092,"Unless you have a ""Play-only"" DVD player, don't buy any of these DVD-R movies.  They will not play in a DVD recorder/player (which I have) or a DVD drive in a PC.  And they are not returnable once you buy them, so you are stuck.  Because the Amazon Merchant (Oldies.com) that I purchased the item from would not give me a refund, I had to purchase a portable DVD player and then connect it to my HDTV (which has an extra set of jacks, so I did not have to disconnect my DVD/VCR recorder) to watch the movie.

UPDATE: Last night (07/17), out of curiosity, I inserted the DVD into my recorder/player, and this time, it played just fine.  Apparently, the portable DVD player corrected an error code that caused the recorder to reject the disc originally.  So everything is fine now.  I also found that if you set up the DVD recorder for a time recording at some future time, that cancels out the recording function and enables the unit to read the disc as a standard DVD.

The movie is very good.  The highlight of the film is Ann Miller's ""I Gotta Hear That Beat"" number, which is twice as long as the clip in THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT.  I'd love to see a Miller biopic someday, possibly with Catherine Zeta-Jones (a fine dancer herself) in the lead role.  Miller also has a tap/flamenco number toward the end of the film, and Jane Powell and Bobby Van (who, along with his wife, Elaine Joyce, did quite a few game shows in the '70s), have plenty of good moments as well.  And the legendary Nat ""King"" Cole also has a number in the film.

The movie print quality is just as good as a standard DVD.  The menu is bare-bones:  there is no ""Scene Selection"" menu (you have to navigate the 10 chapters yourself), and the only ""extras"" are the movie trailer and a Warner Archives promo.

Overall:  four stars for the movie itself, and two for the hassle I had to go through and the lack of extras.  I hope that future Warner Archives releases can be made compatible with DVD recorders, computers, and other devices besides stand-alone players.",1310688000,9,2030,4.455284552845528
399890,3,6301977092,"This 1953 musical version of ""Small Town Girl"" starring Jane Powell, Farley Granger and Ann Miller is a remake of the 1936 romantic comedy that starred Janet Gaynor and Robert Taylor.  However, Amazon is mistakenly listing the 1953 musical DVD as a 1937 release.  Highlights are Ann Miller tapping to ""I've Gotta Hear That Beat"" with Busby Berkeley's orchestra that's all arms and instruments, and Bobby Van's human pogo-stick number.  One of MGM's minor musicals, it's still lots of fun and Jane Powell sings as pretty as ever!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Small-Town-Girl/dp/B0039UU3NC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Small Town Girl</a>",1303948800,4,680,6.290322580645161

399892,5,6301977092,"Granted this is a typical MGM plot to set the tone for the movie, but this film is very special. I contend that Ann Miller's dance routine in ""I've Got To Hear That Beat"" is the finest tap routine ever put on film! I would challenge any of the all time great dancers to duplicate it. Eleanor Powell in her prime maybe; but who else? Jane Powell shows her versatility in that she has a tap routine also. Nonetheless, we get to hear her great voice in a few songs. Throw in a cameo by a 29 year old Nat King Cole; what a great film. I give it 5 stars.",1300320000,2,549,3.954954954954955
399893,4,6301977092,"Very sweet vehicle for Jane.  Wonderful character actors.  And if you like dancing there are some very elaborate numbers.  Farley Granger is quite nice as the spoiled rich boy who speeds thru a tiny town and sentenced to jail by the judge, Jane's dad.

7818949,3,6301977092,"This is a typical Jane Powell sweet story with songs, and, especially, since Farley Granger, who plays her romantic interest in this one, was never a favorite of mine,  I would never have purchased the film if it weren't for Bobby Van's noteworthy dancing.

A very talented dancer, Bobby Van, who never got the fame he deserved as he entered the ""lists"" almost at the end of the big, splashy musical era, really shines here as the ""boy next door."" I had remembered an extraordinary routine he performed in this movie and was reminded of it again when the TMC introduction to their showing of Kiss Me Kate, one of Van's last big musicals, mentioned the routine. Bobby,, elated at the chance for Broadway success, performs a hopping routine, all across town, like a human pogo stick, which is the longest (7 min.) of its kind on film.
