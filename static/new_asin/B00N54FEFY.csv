6611607,5,B00N54FEFY,"I bought the book (The DaVinci Code) years ago, but lost the book (and never had a chance to read it)!

It appears that I've missed one heck of a story.  My mistake.

Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou do an excellent job in a great film.

I always wanted ""Angels and Demons"" as it, too, was an excellent film.

The fact that I could get 2-for-1, and finally check out the DaVinci Code, was a bonus!

Better late, than never...

Five stars for the package, and the films!",1422057600,,464,4.204545454545454

6611614,5,B00N54FEFY,"Two of my all time favorite movies at one great price. The DaVinci Code was the second book of these two written by the marvelous Dan Brown but the first one filmed. Angels and Demons came next and it's wonderful to hear some of the music score from The DaVinci Code echoed throughout. Both films are powerful and, of course, Tom Hanks is superb. Be sure and watch the special features at the end of Angels and Demons about the making of the film, and view the information about the CERN laboratory in Switzerland where anti-matter is actually created. Both films contain a marvelous mix of science and spirituality.",1478995200,,616,4.660550458715596

6611637,3,B00N54FEFY,"Disappointing.  Since there was so much publicity about the book (which I haven't read), I had to get the film especially since it stars Tom Hanks.  But, somehow, the 'Code' missed the mark for me.  Maybe it was the lighting or sound quality and the organization - I feel this intriguing story could have been better presented.  'Angels and Demons' left me cold - totally unbelievable.  Perhaps it's just the religion thing.  Sorry my comments are so vague.  Maybe someday I'll watch these again to figure out why I didn't like them and then I'll update my review.",1425600000,,564,4.6938775510204085

8676310,5,B00N54FEFY,of the 2 movies I feel like the Angels and Demons movie is better made has better characters/better acting although The Da Vinci code movie is a real classic a turned out to be just as entertaining seeing it again (the first time I saw this was in the theater when it came out)  now that I have the DVD to watch it from my own living room - the locations they filmed at for the DaVinci code are just that additional part of the movie that brings more interesting to the watching of it again (even if the idea of Mary Magdalene having Jesus' child and going to France in 1 AD is preposterous - it is another part of what makes this movie entertaining),1509235200,,650,4.158730158730159
