8225880,1,B000WVZQEC,"This workout, to me, seems geared toward kids even younger than teens. The workout was way too easy that I think middle school kids would benefit more.

Everything seemed in slow motion, and you do not sweat. There's no cardio element. You kind of stop and start, and the instructor's movements are so slow that I needed to go even faster and not follow what she was doing.

I'm in my mid 20s, but I don't think teenagers would like this.",1328313600,,438,4.395061728395062
