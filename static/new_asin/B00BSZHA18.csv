What I liked was the question that the creator didn't really answer, Why after all these years do people still continue to go to shows and support the scene? As someone in their 40s I often find myself asking the same question. Why am I going to shows and seeing bands that I've seen time and time again and why do these bands still keep going? Though he seemed to get close to that answer a few times, the point seemed to get lost in there somewhere.

Most of the video is filmed in low-fi, the sound isn't the best with the sound levels all over the place but this is punk and DIY. It's just too bad the subject matter wasn't more interesting or focused.",1398124800,,930,4.308571428571429
