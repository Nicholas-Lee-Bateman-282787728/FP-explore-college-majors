7899125,3,6305987017,"If you're new to this rather unique movie genre, you'll probably enjoy it.  A young Noah Beery Jr. has grown up as a wild boy, a survivor of a shipwreck.  The story basically is a Tarzan like one, with lots of stock wild animal footage.  The chapter endings are adequate with the ending of Chapter 10 probably being impressive to those who haven't yet watched a number of serials with the same gimmick.
However, for the more seasoned serial fan, this is somewhat slow paced and not likely to provide anything spectacular, and this is too bad. The Kingdom of Mu thread could have been developed further and added much more interest, but as it is, you're not introduced to the Kingdom until the end of the afore-mentioned Chapter 10.  The theme is introduced in the first chapter when you learn that the heroine is the long-lost and unknowing princess of Mu, but it takes an unfortunately long time to get there, and the visit is too short.",1043884800,,938,4.565476190476191
7899126,5,6305987017,"This is one of the most imaginative and exciting cliffhangers I have ever seen ( my collection exceeds 40 serials ).  This is what a cliffhanger is supposed to be and if the word could be defined by one example, this would certainly be my choice.  Every chapter is well thought out and ends with spectacular examples of nail biting impending doom.  Noah Beery Jr. portrays a believable jungle man and the supporting actors perform admirably.  Buy this one knowing it will be one of your best!",978307200,3,492,4.620689655172414
