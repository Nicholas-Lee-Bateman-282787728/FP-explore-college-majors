8386528,2,B003152Z0O,I understand to a point the reasons behind making a movie that is almost a silent film. The director wants to emphasize the coldness and the loneliness and despair in these peoples lives. But for someone who loves the Portuguese language and wants nothing more than to watch a movie in here Portuguese well look elsewhere.  For some reason all Portuguese films seem to follow this type of theme. No words a lot of film that is drawn out and very long scenes that seem to go nowhere. Why? They have such a beautiful language and so many stories to tell.,1477353600,,552,4.465346534653466

8386530,5,B003152Z0O,"Pedro Costa allows us to observe the lives of the poor of Fontainhas. It is, what it is. The hacking cough, daly drug use, mundane conversations, are repeated in different stages of family life in such poverty. The cinematography seems much to beautiful for this environment, black and white would seem more appropriate .One of the younger women in the first film is to beautiful for the part. We , as viewers, never get to leave this ""ghetto"". People leave for work , come home, but we stay ,with the constant coughing ,images of poverty so beautifully filmed.",1278633600,5,561,4.73469387755102
