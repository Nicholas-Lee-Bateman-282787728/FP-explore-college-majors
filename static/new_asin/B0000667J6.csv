I found this on The Official Cass Elliot Web site and passed it by, thinking (foolishly, I might add) that maybe the social commentary and historical nature of it would be nothing new since that was my era and I felt that I had heard it all before. NOT!! This is a real treasure that definately brings to light how some of the most important music ever produced came into being! It's one of best chronicles of what was happening at that time, chocked full of rare photos, damn good music, and commentary that will crack you up,Guaranteed! This DVD really suprised me! Obviously, this should be promoted more broadly, because if you had an inkling as to how good this really is, well, do I have say any more?",1278460800,2,735,4.411764705882353
1711513,5,B0000667J6,I received this video with a DVD player we purchased.  After watching it we were fascinated with the information on it.  It was lost by someone it was loaned to so I wanted to replace it for future watching.,1260921600,2,207,4.282051282051282
1711514,5,B0000667J6,"The two guys who created some of the finest and most famous album covers (anyone recall LPs?) ... hear the inside scoop.

This is pure fun. These two had the best job in America ... hands down.

I can watch it over and over and still be delighted.",1253491200,3,247,4.125
1711515,5,B0000667J6,This is a must have for all of those photographers out there who are music lovers as well.  Fantastic behind the scene recollections of the way the covers were made - including the take from the art director as well.  Well worth the money and I would have paid 4x the amount for this item.,1228262400,3,289,4.236363636363636
1711516,5,B0000667J6,"We had the honor and privilege of interviewing Henry Diltz a few years ago. It was a pleasure to hear his stories and many of them are recounted here in this DVD. Diltz has worked with just about anyone you can name, including Crosby Stills and Nash, the Doors, the Lovin' Spoonful, the Monkees (he was their primary photographer), Paul McCartney and a million others. His stories are a fountain of information. My favorite story is the creation of the Morrison Hotel cover, which he recounts here. A great bargain with a treasure trove of information and background into the music of the '60s and '70s from someone who played an integral role.",1194220800,4,644,4.707964601769912
1711517,5,B0000667J6,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's the story of Henry Diltz, and Gary Burden the designers of some very famous album covers by Crosby Stills, and Nash, Joni Mitchell, The Eagles, Jackson Browne, The Doors etc.  These guys are a couple of old happy hippies.

This movie is a loose documentary with some very funny stories. They also go and talk to the Eagles and others with whom they made their famous album covers for.

Glenn Frey of The Eagles is looking over the pictures shot for their first album cover. Apparently everyone, including Diltz and Burden, were high on peyote for a long day and night in the desert. My favorite line in the movie is when Glenn Frey says ""These pictures aren't history, they're EVIDENCE!""

They also tell the story of how Diltz crash landed with Jimmy Webb in a glider and almost died. The also include a lot of old 8mm film footage taken while they were actually filming the album covers so you really feel like you are there.

These guys really changed the art of the album cover which is all but gone today because we have these miniature picture books in CD's.  I found myself wanting to be there when they were making these covers. I'd love to hang with these guys for an afternoon.

All in all a great movie worth seeing for any old hippie.",1118966400,12,1279,4.463519313304721
1711518,5,B0000667J6,"I can not recommend this DVD enough!  I have had so much fun watching it over and over again.  It is full of well told stories and memories about what went into the photographs and the design of some of the best album covers of all time.  Look carefully at the cover of this DVD and you will see what I mean.  But it is not a typical documentary.  It moves beautifully, weaving between the set-up of the concepts and where the photos were taken, with commentary by Henry Diltz (the photographer) and Gary Burden (the graphic designer) and band members.  The photographs are stunning.  Henry took tons of photos with the artists in natural situations, at their homes and just having fun.  Also, the editing of the DVD is great, allowing you to enjoy so much of how everything came about.  Plus Henry also shot alot of super 8 movies of parties and gatherings.  And, there is a photo gallery that is incredible.
The commentary by Gary and Henry describes everything in a casual yet exciting way that capture the moments perfectly.
This is the best rock related documentary I have ever seen. You will not regret this purchase.",1036540800,17,1123,4.57
1711519,5,B0000667J6,"This DVD is an excellent blend of interviews, stills, and old 8mm movie footage of the musicians and artists that created these classic album covers. There are some really great stories here. I love that these guys return to the ""scene of the crime"" so you can see what those landmarks look like now. Seeing the artists themselves discussing the album cover art is great too.
If you are a fan of any of these ""California Rock"" artists you'll treasure this DVD.",1026345600,10,460,4.621951219512195
7961806,5,B0000667J6,"These albums were being played by all growing up in the 60s and 70s.  This DVD has interviews with the photographers who did these iconic covers, sometimes by just stumbling upon the right scene (i.e. the Doors album).  I would recommend it to anyone interested in the history of that era.",1524096000,,289,4.647058823529412

7961811,5,B0000667J6,"Saw this show on PBS  many years ago and was unable to ever find it.  I was thrilled to finally find it, just looking on a whim.  I watched it and then promptly put it in the mail to my twin brother, who obviously shares the same love of music from this time period,  our high school years.  He in particular LOVES CSN, so will really enjoy the story on the first album cover.",1413676800,2,376,4.027027027027027
7961812,5,B0000667J6,"I'd seen part of this on TV a few years ago and I have been looking for it since.  Finally found it and was able to watch the whole thing this week.  It is great and I highly recommend it.

A couple of old hippies just tooling around and reminiscing with some good old friends.  For those of us of a certain age and a certain life style, back in the day, it brings back wonderful memories.  Not that I was there at the time, but there were I suspect little enclaves all over the U.S. where people were living the same life style. Even if we were not quite as talented and lucky as those in this movie.

The two guys were very talented and their record album covers are still around to attest to that(as were the people who made the albums the covers went over).  They were clearly serious about their work and with reason, the results were often amazing.  It was neat to watch them go over all the photos the one guy had saved from the 60s & 70s, many of which I suspect have not seen the light of day since they were taken.

The people in this movie seemed to understand that they had this charmed life.  Also, one thing I really like is that none of them are particularly embarrassed about what they did in terms of drugs and such.  Sex, drugs and rock and roll was more than a slogan it was a way of life and no one really expresses any regret.

In fact they all seem to think that if they could get away with it now they wouldn't mind doing it again.  Well me to.

Watch it if you can.",1374019200,2,1489,4.054794520547945
7961813,4,B0000667J6,Nice little voyeuristic adventure into the world of record album art. It was a little like watching Bevis & Butthead make a living in L.A.,1369872000,,138,4.56
7961814,5,B0000667J6,This documentary is so cool.  These guys saw so much.  They were right in the middle of a revolution that was changing music around the world.  It's well worth watching for the stories.,1358899200,2,185,4.545454545454546
7961815,5,B0000667J6,"I wrote this review for a car blog, but they blocked it.
The subject was the appearance in movies of the iconic Porsche 356 Speedster, and for my money, this film shows that car in its true natural habitat.  Read on...
One of my favorite movies featuring a Porsche Speedster is ""Under the Covers - A Magical Journey: Rock N Roll in L.A. in the 60's - 70's"".  You can find it at Amazon.com, ebay or a used DVD store.  Its well worth looking for.
The film follows rock photographer Henry Diltz and album cover designer Gary Burden as they tool around LA in Henry's 356 Porsche ""bathtub"" Speedster, visiting locations like the Morrison Hotel and Venice Beach, recounting the adventures they had with the Doors, Cass Eliot of the Mamas and Papas, Joanie Mitchell, CSN, Richard Prior, the Eagles...
You get the picture.  Or if you don't, there is a clip from the film on YouTube, though sadly without showing the Porsche. Just cut and paste the full title of the film into the search box on the YouTube web site.",1335830400,2,1007,4.516483516483516
