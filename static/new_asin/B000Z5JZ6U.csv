8234754,5,B000Z5JZ6U,On this installment of the series be prepared to be on the edge of your seat cause things are gonna happen that will blow you outta the sky. LOL!!!  You really have to see seasons 1-4 to really understand 5-8 cause the characters are oomplex and you won't understand their story without first watching it from the beginning. I love this whole series because they show you each character in depth and their interaction with the other prisoners or lack thereof. You will grow to love some characters and really hate others but all in all you will love this series as I do.,1360195200,,570,4.480769230769231
