8665541,5,B00LF00JK0,"Having a doctrine in music, Jon Lord was and remains a very important musician in the classical and hard rock genres. This video pays homage to both his styles of music. The first half is a well delivered presentation of his classical music where the orchestra demonstrates this style to the fullest.
  The second half truly doesn't disapoint. The sound is amazing. Bruce Dickenson and Glenn Hughes deliver electrifying performances, where Glenn Hughes steals the show and definitely the highlight of this Blu-ray. Deep Purple ends the show and were also in fine form. The Sunflower jam is an amazing event and having this tribute to Jon Lord is a must have for his fans.",1417824000,2,671,4.826086956521739

8665543,4,B00LF00JK0,"A bit expensive but the quality of sound and performance are great. This is a perfect companion piece to those who like the Deep Purple Philharmonic 1969 DVD. Glenn Hughes/Bruce Dickinson steal the show-and how about the way Ian Paice plays while playing with Hughes!?  It's like he was inspired again. Lots of great performances and a really exceptional and classy tribute. The only downer was seeing Ian Gillan ""talk, I mean sing"" after all the other singers came up with the goods. He cant do it anymore, and comes off really weak. Those first few tunes are just weak too. Morse has some fine/great moments but the current Purple are like a cover band now...total cruise control with slow tempos and no chances being taken (Except by Morse) 4 STARS as it is a bit costly, and I wished they had included some Lord footage. GREAT TECHNICAL PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY",1416182400,11,866,4.697368421052632
8665544,5,B00LF00JK0,Long live Jon Lord!  This DVD is a wonderful celebration of his life.,1413244800,,69,4.3076923076923075
