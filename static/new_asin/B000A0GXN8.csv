2347058,1,B000A0GXN8,"My husband and I are long-time fans of Alfred Hitchcock, Night Gallery and the original Twilight Zone series, and thought based on promotional data and reviews that this would be right up our alley.  Unfortunately, we found this show lives a few alleys over and it's not in a great neighborhood.  I'll use one of the episodes as an example -- the episode featuring Donna Mills and Judy Carne as roommates in a creepy house with a ""secret.""  First of all, the secret isn't hard to cypher out after a few minutes, at least in a form rudimentary enough to cause any similar tenant to am-scray without thinking twice.  Second, most of what happens is implausible and prompts puzzled comments starting with ""why don't they just..."" or ""why are they bothering to....""  (This is never a good sign.)  Third, and probably most disturbing to me, was the fact that the ""creepiness"" factor in this episode was manufactured largely by adding weird, gratuitous titillation gimmicks like a bizarre pre-teen peeping tom and a weird middle-aged underwear thief.  Neither of these plot devices ultimately had anything at all to do with moving the story forward, but simply gave the viewer an opportunity to see women spied upon in a bathroom, or having their bras pilfered and fondled.  That had the unwelcome effect of making me, the viewer, feel somehow more violated than the principle characters.  To top it off, the camerawork is sophomoric even by the standards of the day, the script is predictable, the acting verges on comical in places, the sets look cardboard and the whole show has the general feel of a summer camp production concocted by none-too-talented teens.  I guess there are original British viewers who might watch this with some nostalgia, but I cannot fathom how this series got trotted out in 2008 for another go-round with American newbies.  Clearly, there's a reason why we had never heard of it on this side of the pond.  And the fact that there are used copies of this $80 set now going for around $5 -- well, `nuff said.  I'm generously giving this set one star simply because it amused me to ponder whether the *other* ""Thriller"" -- Michael Jackson -- posed for that cover.  See the resemblance?",1219363200,19,2208,4.79155672823219
2347059,3,B000A0GXN8,"This series has a nostalgic sway over those of us who stayed up late in the 70s and 80s to watch these.  Others may find it all a little creaky, at least the shows in this first set.  Stories like The Eyes Have It, which were once really frightening, now seem quaint.  Others are a little dull - especially those with imported American stars.  Still, there's a lot to enjoy here.  The nature of the video taping gives you the sense you're seeing West End stage thrillers of the era, with delicious star terms from the likes of Robert Powell and Dinsdale Landon.
Warning:  If you haven't seen the shows already, Clemens' introductions are full of spoilers and best viewed after the fact.  Also, almost none of the stars listed on the box are in any of these shows.

2347060,1,B000A0GXN8,"When this creepy anthology series first debuted on Region 2 DVD back in 2005, I knew I wanted to eventually purchase it, and it was a great deal in getting all 4 seasons in one boxed set.  I never got around to buying it, figuring I would see if it would ever surface on Region 1.  Well, it has, and for more money than I can buy all 4 seasons, we only get the first season?  ARGH!  You'd spend a small fortune collecting these!  Since cheap DVD players can easily be changed to multi region these days, for the price you will have to pay to get the entire series on Region 1 discs, you could spend far less buying a new DVD player, the Region 2 boxed set, and still have money left over for a few seasons of some other television show.

2347061,5,B000A0GXN8,"I remember staying up late as a kid to watch this show, and the theme music used to make my flesh crawl...it still does have a creepy effect on me. The stories are original, and well-told. The acting, for the most part is above average, and the elements that make the stories compelling are the acting, dialogue, and atmosphere. Unlike most of today's shows that rely too much on special effects, and graphic violence/nudity/sex, these stories rely more on atmosphere, and it truly makes a difference. Some may consider these stories slow-moving, but if you are patient, and love to see a good story told slowly, with the suspense building up, then you will surely appreciate this series.",1170460800,8,688,4.838983050847458

2347063,5,B000A0GXN8,"This series was known in the US as ABC Wide World of Mystery!

Hoepfully, we don't get a one shot release here!

The music was ahead of it's time and pretty scary at that time.

2347109,4,B000A0GXN8,"This British series from the 1970s is a real treat for suspense fans. It ran for 5 seasons, and this package is Season One, the first 10 episodes. I saw most of them as a kid when they first aired in the US, and 40 years later they're as good as I remember. Each film is approx. 65-70 minutes long, with a ""3-act play"" set-up (2 breaks for commercials, which are NOT included--Yay!). Brian Clemens is a sort of Brit Rod Serling/Alfred Hitchcock, and he wrote most of these stories. (He also wrote several great theatrical suspense films, including AND SOON THE DARKNESS and SEE NO EVIL.)

These 10 stories are well produced and directed, with strong casts headed by one or two stars in each episode (Robert Powell, Barbara Feldon, Richard Johnson, Polly Bergen, Paul Burke, Sinead Cusack, Diane Cilento, etc.). They range in quality from excellent (""Possession,"" ""A Place To Die,"" ""Spell of Evil"") to average (""An Echo of Theresa,"" ""Murder In Mind""), with 1 genuine classic in the batch: ""Someone At the Top of the Stairs."" This episode, about two college girls (Donna Mills and Judy Carne) who take a room in a creepy London boarding house, is simply ""marvelous!"" (You'll know the significance of that word after you've seen it.) My vivid memories of this episode prompted me to buy the whole box, and I'm glad I did.

If you like TWILIGHT ZONE, ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS, OUTER LIMITS, and the American THRILLER (hosted by Boris Karloff), you'll like this show as well. I hope the other 4 seasons will be released on DVD in the US soon, because I remember several more excellent episodes from my youth. Recommended.",1385337600,,1617,4.7304964539007095

Many years later (40?) while reading collections of Robert E. Howard stories I recalled this when I read his story ""Pigeons from Hell"". The collection I was reading confirmed that his story was selected for the Thriller episode and had the same title. Now I can buy it and watch it whenever I want to. What would I have thought back in 1961 if someone told me I'd be able to watch this on a laptop computer and read the story on my Kindle e-book reader some 5 decades in the future?

2347119,5,B000A0GXN8,"I looked for this series for a long time, on the Internet, and when I finally remembered the name of the guy associated with the show, who is Brian Clemens, and typed his name and hit ""search"", I finally found the ONE scary show that we used to talked about the next day in school.  I was originally from the Philippines and back in the mid 70's it was aired, I believe, on Sunday nights, which is why it was called by us students, SST, short for Sunday Suspense Theater.
My favorites are:  Nurse will make it better;  One Deadly Owner;  Someone at the top of the stairs; and I'm the Girl he wants to kill.
I would like to own the ENTIRE series of Thriller, but unfortunately, Amazon does not have it...yet.  The suspense, the music, the story, all brought back good memories of retelling the story to my friends/classmates the next day.

2347120,4,B000A0GXN8,"This box set is great if you like old creepy shows, the stories are unusual, unique, and some of them have very clever twists (Lady Killer). This show aired in a different era, so the pace is slower, the sets and lighting are 'stagey' but some of the acting, particularly Donna Mills (Someone At The Top Of The Stairs), is superb. Overall the show has a very dated feel to it, the costumes, hairstyles etc, and that can be distracting, but if you are into old-time creepy thriller-type shows then you'll know that you have to go back to this type of show to get good stories since this genre has been replaced today by gore-porn. While not as hysterical/theatrical, it does have the air of Dark Shadows about it, some of the episodes have an isolated feel about them, almost as if they are a window into another time and place, not a TV show. That just adds to the creep factor. If you are looking for special effects, or horror, this is not the set for you, but if you like a slow build, creepy stories, and good acting then this is a great set.",1357948800,2,1046,4.314720812182741

2347122,5,B000A0GXN8,The Thriller television series first season is a combination of some very good episodes with some that really miss the mark. I think Boris Karloff had an identity crisis with this series. I think there was some pandering to the sponsors for certain types of shows to satisfy them but this came at a cost. Some episodes where written and directed like a police show while other were more suspense and some horror. The show has aged well as a series as a whole. The season two episodes are even more unbalanced. I can understand why NBC jumped at the chance to replace this series with the Alfred Hitchcock Hour series which is of better quality and more balanced as a whole.,1354320000,,673,4.524590163934426

The stories are fun but somewhat predictable the real fun is watching some really great acting in the stories as well as actors you recognize from movies and tv. All in all I will watch this set again and will enjoy it just as much. The reason I call these paperback book mysteries is that like reading a murder mystery in the 60s and 70s they were short books but still satisfying mysteries this series I feel was influenced by them.",1342828800,,700,4.608

2347125,3,B000A0GXN8,"First Season's Average Rating 6.8/ 10:

Thriller's first season enthralls in accordance to the terror and suspense it generates. While series creator Brian Clemens does familiar formulas ( Lady Killer/ A Place to Die) to varying effect, he also creates stories that other writers would copy from him later on (Possession) or tweaks a formula enough that it feels entirely fresh (The Wait Until Dark-like The Eyes Have It, or the Psycho-twists of The Colour of Blood.)

Despite Brian Clemens always being a highly literate writer, he sometimes seems to forget (mostly in the later episodes of the first season) that most thriller/suspense and horror films seem to function only as good as their terror setups. While it sometimes misses the mark in that regard it still often gets its dramatic aspects right

Episode 1: Lady Killer (6.5 out of 10)-- Despite being well acted and featuring sharp dialogue, Lady Killer feels like a retread of the `ole murder for the insurance policy scheme and is often repetitive to pad out its runtime. However, this first episode has a  resolution that ends on a note that you expect but it is justifiable.

Episode 2: Possession (10.0 Out of 10)-- A cryptic tale of murder makes a rather fine episode that features some truly haunting scenes.  The small peak of the opening murder sets a dire tone even if  it mostly takes place offscreen (as often in Brian Clemens world.)

Episode 3: The Room At The Top Of the Stairs (8.0 Out of 10)-- An episode that works due to its odd characters and the mystery surrounding it all, especially concerning who occupies the room above where the girls live. There is also some Rosemary's Baby-esque plotting, and the film surprisingly ends with a downbeat, twist ending.

Episode 4: An Echo of Theresa (7.0 Out of 10)-- A rich performance by Dinsdale Landen playing private detective Matthew Earp bring out the episode's colors and the guessing game is intriguing. Really only the husband/wife central characters being wooden deflates this episode that has an ending that will make anyone smirk.

Episode 5: The Colour of Blood (10.0 Out of 10)-- Suspenseful, eerie, exquisitely acted, and featuring a twisty, turning plot that keeps pulling the carpet from your feet. This episode is a stunner.

Episode #6: Murder In Mind (8.0 Out of 10): While it may not be as ingeniously structured as the series best moments, Murder In Mind's central idea is well executed and keeps you guessing enough about the alleged murder.  An episode that takes what would have been a somewhat generic and tame idea, and makes it much more.

Episode #7: A Place To Die (4.0 Out of 10): Much too straight  forward with not much of Thriller's trademarks, as well as a lack of urgency, punctures this episode from being a good riff on The Wicker Man. As always the acting is commendable, the dialogue is witty and succinct, and there's a good scene at the end in which a medical deformity looks to be the mark of Satan. Yet, there is just not much interesting going on here and much of the episode feels padded and tired.

Episode #8: File It Under Fear  (3.0 Out of 10): Rather uninspired, this episode feels rather light on the great elements that make a good Thriller. With no suspense or thrills, and little in the way of worthwhile plot turns, this inclusion to season one is pretty dry. Even the dialogue and acting leaves something to be desired, which is uncommon for this series.

Episode #9: The Eyes Have It (8.5 Out of 10): Not as scary or thrilling as some of the other episodes, but the story is simply calculated, the acting comes off as realistic, and the premise is intriguing.  There may have been episodes done better the first season due to using more terror, but The Eyes Have It is well envisioned and pulled off tightly.

Episode #10: Spell of Evil (3.0 Out of 10): Despite the classiness held here, Spell of Evil feels a bit too tame and rote to be memorable or give a scary impression. Probably the worse entry in the first season.",1334880000,2,4002,4.707736389684814

I think if the writer would have put a little bit more effort into the endings that it would have made a tremindous difference. Not such of a thrill to me.

It's still a terrifying episode. The series itself is somewhat uneven, but that's only to be expected from anything that shows every week for a few years.",1433462400,,530,4.877777777777778
