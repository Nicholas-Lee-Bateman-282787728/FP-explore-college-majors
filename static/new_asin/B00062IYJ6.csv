2163339,5,B00062IYJ6,Platinum did a great job digitally re-mastering these five black & white movies from the 30's and 40's.  Sound and picture quality is very good.,1193270400,,144,4.76
2163340,5,B00062IYJ6,"The quality is so good that you will think you are watching brand new prints in the best theater on Main Street in the 1940s. Actually it's probably better than that. The intro says these digital re-masters were done by a company named ""US Television Office, Inc."". For goodness sake, every person or studio who has old prints TAKE THEM TO ""US TELEVISION OFFICE, INC."" AND GET THEM RE-MASTERED. Platinum has released 8 volumes of these Hoppy feature films and I own all 8. But for some strange reason, probably only known to some ""power lunch"" executive, they did not number the volumes...so you will just have to tell the difference by the numbers Amazon gives them. They are worth twice or 3 times the price. There were 66 Hopalong Cassidy films made starring William Boyd, and you can own 40 of them with these 8 volumes at a slim price.",1170028800,3,840,4.569536423841059
2163341,5,B00062IYJ6,"Hopalong Cassidy and California Carlson were my heros on many a Saturday afternoon.  For 35 cents I could see them in a movie and enjoy a box of delicious popcorn. Hoppy was my favorite over Roy and Gene.  These movies hold up well, and the quality of the sound and picture is first rate.  Getting 5 full length features at this incredibly low price is one of the best bargains on the internet. All 8 volumes are great fun.  If you buy one I am sure you will buy the rest.",1167868800,3,472,4.153846153846154

2163343,5,B00062IYJ6,"Hopalong Cassidy Vol. 8 just arrived and I couldn't wait to pop it into my DVD player. What a great job Platinum has done to remaster these old films and release them 5 to a disc. I now own 7 of the 8 available and expect my 8th one to arrive in the next day or two.

Any ""B"" Western and/or Hoppy fan should be pleased with any and all of these Platinum DVDs. My hope is that they continue with new releases until they've done them all. I'll be waiting.",1118880000,2,453,3.978021978021978
2163344,4,B00062IYJ6,"This dvd is good. But it is mislabeled by amazon. It is the same as cassidy volume 8. Or they sent me the wrong dvd. I believe they made the mistake on their web page. If you own volume 8 don't buy this or you will have a dulicate also

2163356,5,B00062IYJ6,"The Hopalong Cassidy movies, overall, are excellent movies that stand up well for adult audiences today.  All five of the movies in this set are reproduced very well, although the oldest one, ""The Eagle's Brood"", has perhaps a little less visual quality than the others.  Still very good.  The disc has no problems. All of the movies are filmed in beautiful scenic locales, mountains and deserts.  In ""The Eagles Brood"" (1936), the Cassidy character is not yet fully formed, and there are a couple of brutal murders of young women which is more disconcerting than occur in the usual B-western.  George Hayes is a bartender and not yet into his Windy or Gabby roles.  Nice group of movies.  You won't go wrong on this set.",1366761600,,721,4.72
2163357,5,B00062IYJ6,Good movie!  Exciting plot with great cast.  Fast action. Recommend for all to see who enjoy great westerns and constant suspense.,1366588800,,130,5.142857142857143

2163360,5,B00062IYJ6,"What you have to remember is that the Paramount films from the 1930s and 40s were superb in every detail, but the earliest were already released through Image Entertainment as double features (those are also on Amazon for purchase). These are the second best, ignoring the last twelve that William Boyd produced himself, which drag and are very slooo[...] So slow in fact that when he edited them into TV features in the 1950s, they work better as 25 minute episodes. But overall, the picture quality is superb and so is the sound. These used to sell on VHS as single features at $14.95 each so five of them for a little more than a buck a piece is a bargain and worth the price. This company released eight DVDs, by the way, for a total of 40 of the 66 movies. I recommend you buy all eight of them.",1327363200,2,800,4.34
2163361,5,B00062IYJ6,"This is the next and last among the 8 dvd collections of movies-offering another 5 from , mostly, the 40s.  It was on a par with the rest of the releases. The specs show the actual movies and dates. The remastering of them was good with the addition of 5.1 stereo which seemed to be mostly an added music track that kicked in in some places for effect.  I am not sure if it is new music or a re mastered or updated original.  It wasn't a bad addition and seemed to be the same as previous discs.  I have to say that it was certainly worth the few bucks as an addition to a collection or as a first try; it is representative of the rest and plenty of bang for the $7.",1319328000,,666,3.9477611940298507
2163362,4,B00062IYJ6,"The Platinum editions of Hoppy take us through the years roughly 1938 until the movie series ends about a decade later.  Another company has the first three years of the series.  There is one exception.  The second entry of the series THE EAGLE""S BROOD is included here for some unexplainable reason.  And the print of this particular movie is horrible.  I guess they did the best they could in the remastering stage, but what a shame that they didn't have a better print to work with as the rest of the films in the Hoppy catalogue that Platinum has owned the rights to and as everybody else has noted.... they look AWESOME!!!  They look like they were filmed about an hour ago, not 70 years ago.

I'm nitpicking, it's just that I was shocked as I have now seen all the Platinum films and this one is the only one that looks like a Mill Creek or an Alpha release.  Eagle's Brood, however, is perhaps the best film volume 8.  The lousy print doesn't keep you from enjoying it.

I love the other films on this volume too!  I believe you will also.",1284076800,,1046,4.367875647668394

2163364,5,B00062IYJ6,"I now own 50 of Hoppy's 66 movies and all 52 episodes of the TV show.  I purchased them all through Amazon and am exceptionally pleased with the service and the quality of the DVDs.  Hopalong Cassidy was my favorite movie cowboy and these DVDs make me feel like I'm a kid again. My only complaint is that the DVD sites do not list the movies that are contained on the DVD.  Thank goodness that some of the reviewers listed the movies that were contained on the DVDs, and then I was able to determine what DVD collections, etc. I needed to complete my Hopalong Cassidy collection. With that in mind, here are the movies on Vol. 8:  Outlaws of the Desert, Lost Canyon, Bar 20, The Eagle's Brood, and Lumberjack.  Hope this helps.",1240790400,19,727,4.395522388059701

Of all the B western series of the 30s, 40s and early 50s, these are consistently the best written, directed and produced. There are many combinations of sidekicks, and the Cassidy character changes a bit over time, becoming kinder and wiser. Boyd is always a true star, the most interesting person in the frame as well as (in my view) the best lead actor in B horse operas, and he is always surrounded by a solid cast of pros.",1428624000,,488,4.620689655172414
