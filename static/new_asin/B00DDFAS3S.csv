8592145,5,B00DDFAS3S,"Great picture and sound quality. Loved the concert. I do have to say its on the expensive side, but definitely worth the money. The tracklist for the concert was excellent, the only thing I might wish was added was special features and menu options. Looking forward to the World Tour 3rd dvd!
