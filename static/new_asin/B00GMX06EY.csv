With impeccably clear oral instructions, illustrations by both an instructor and students with diverse abilities, and corresponding scientific explanations, it will suit the novice as well as the more advanced student of yoga.  I highly recommend it as a gift for someone else or for  yourself.  A wise investment.  A. M. Rea",1385769600,,443,5.097222222222222

8624977,5,B00GMX06EY,"This is a great DVD, good production quality and easy to follow exercises. The extra information from the doctors is helpful too, so I intend to get a copy for my mother and mother-in-law. I got the first Stretch In Time DVD for my mom who used to do yoga but stopped after an injury. The five exercises helped to get her moving again and back to her regular routine. I heartily recommend anything this company produces.",1384992000,,420,4.467532467532467
