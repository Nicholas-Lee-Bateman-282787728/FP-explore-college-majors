8589701,5,B00D5G8D5A,"Whoa! This is a great drama. 2012-2013 S. Korean drama. Park Yoo-chun is the detective, Yoon Eun-hye is the girl, Yoo Seung-ho is the psycho and he plays the role well. The story is about about child abuse, lasting love, and violence when obsession takes over the mind and soul of an already sick person. The story is set-up well with what happens to these three characters during their childhood and moves on to the trials and tribulations that they experience in adulthood. Two men, two different personalities, and a gentle girl who is separated from the boy she loved and taught to hate him. But she can't. Their love was cemented the moment they met. Super drama. I recommend it highly.",1375056000,,691,4.672131147540983
8589702,4,B00D5G8D5A,It is not one of my all-time favorites but I am a sucker for anything with Park Youn Choon (sp?)!  I get very distracted if the subtitles are written correctly and I correct them in my head and then have to catch up.  I wasn't crazy about the translations - phrasing was a bit awkward but the story was interesting - especially when they are younger (great cast from Moon Embracing the Sun).  I would recommend it.,1372809600,,414,4.35064935064935

this drama makes everyone happy. Enjoyable way to spend some time watching this.",1372032000,,267,4.36
