8314562,5,B001KBGH8W,I walk regularly and have added Oxycise to my day.  Increasing the flow of oxygen in the body also increases metabolism which help when you get older.  Love the way I feel!,1487635200,,172,4.34375

8314566,5,B001KBGH8W,"I have been exercising to all the Oxycise workouts for years now.  But they are on VHS, so I am slowly repurchasing them on DVD.  These body positions and stretches actually tone you up.",1398297600,3,186,4.4411764705882355
8314567,5,B001KBGH8W,"Excellent workout that is quick and enjoyable and revitalising. It makes my very hectic life raising full-on children easier to cope with.
I have recommended this to others and they also have had great results.",1364342400,3,210,5.0285714285714285

8314569,5,B001KBGH8W,I received my purchase in a short amount of time.  The DVD is in perfect condition.  It's been an excellent choice I made when I bought this item.,1285372800,,146,4.178571428571429
8314570,5,B001KBGH8W,"I have been using this system on and off for approx 5 years. It is a little challenging to learn, and that discourages some people. But if you stick with it, it works. For me, the scale doesn't budge for a while, but inches start coming off almost immediately. Clothes fit much better,cellulite markedly decreases and face definition improves. I have all the tapes, Level 1 - 4, plus the buns and thigh and abs and upper body, because i like the variety. It's a life saver to be able to fit in exercise when you are pressed for time. I will say the workout take more than 15 minutes, more like 25. But well worth it. Highly recommended",1284163200,17,635,4.34453781512605
