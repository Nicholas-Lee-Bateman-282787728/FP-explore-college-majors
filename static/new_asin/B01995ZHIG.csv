7565599,5,B01995ZHIG,"- Synopsis: A sequel to the first one, this anime emphasizes the abilities of our main character as he struggles to peacefully resolve matters by sealing the spirits he meets. However, he cannot utilize conventional methods such as a show of force. He must win over the girls and then kiss them to seal their powers; effectively preventing them from being targeted by the military due to their perceived threat. This grows more difficult, as the dangers ahead increase, as well the amount of girls he must try and save. Once again, the world's fate is in the hands of our hero as he tries to save the world by kissing the girls.

- Comments: It would have been nice if it was a bit longer, but oh well. Great fan-service.
More waifus were added, so yay. On a more serious note, the story does get a bit more serious. Though it is an ecchi, so it is more simplistic and establishes a light-hearted tone.

If you are looking at this, then you most likely have seen the first season. Might as well finish what you started, yeah?
Do it. Do it for the 2D waifus!

- Analysis: There is a heavy emphasis on interactions and relationships. This infers to the fact that life typically revolves around the social interactions of others and building a variety of relationships. Not only will others accommodate for one's strengths or weaknesses, it just makes life that much more interesting when one socializes with like-minded individuals, among other things.

Moreover, this anime also emphasizes that a single goal can motivate or move one's life along a given direction. Though, there is no telling whether it will be easy or difficult; the learning experience is probably one of the more important aspects. As such, regarding how one views their life as meaningful or meaningless, a specific goal to work towards serves as an educational and powerful concept to attain. As it can give a person a reason for living, if they would otherwise ponder their existence and role within society.

- Features: English and Japanese audio, as well as English subs. Includes 10 episodes on 2 Blu-rays, and 10 on 2 DVDs with a run-time of about 4.5 hours. Rated TV-14 for violence and fan-service.

7565600,4,B01995ZHIG,"I liked the series for what it was, though maybe not quite as much as the first one. The animation is top notch although the english voices are kinda played out. I swear Brittany Karbowski does a voice for at least one character in all of Sentai's works, and this is no exception. I wish she had more ranges so it didn't sound like the same character in different series... But back to the topic, overall not bad. Not exactly thick with plot or anything, but a good lighthearted harem comedy. We get to see a lot more of Kurumi in season 2 than in season one, so that's a huge plus for me since she's by far my favorite. If you liked the first one, I would recommend going for the second one too.",1475712000,,696,4.162962962962963

7565612,4,B01995ZHIG,"I like this series, but season 2 is really blurry compared to season 1. The blu-ray video appears to be a 480p upscale, it's actually lower resolution than most DVDs. This cannot have been Funimation's fault because the season 1 flashback scenes, as well as the english and japanese overlayed credit text, are in HD. The audio quality for season 2 also has a flaw that only a few people might notice. Everything sounds scratchy, similar to the output of a very low quality audio DAC. The production moved from AIC PLUS+ to Production IMS between seasons, so I guess the new studio had some old equipment.

The included DVD version actually looks sharper than the blu-ray version, because there is edge enhancement applied. That might have been done by Funimation. It was probably the right choice considering the quality of the source material. The DVD version of season 1 did not have this edge enhancement, but still looks sharper than the DVD of season 2 anyway.

Other than these technical issues, the feel of the show is exactly the same as season 1, as most of the production staff was carried over. The drawings on average are of lower quality in season 2, but the good images are of the same quality.

This release does not feature any of the director's cut extended scenes in Japan, but that does not bother me. Funimation's season 1 did not feature the director's cut either, so it matches. The bonus episode OVA for season 2 is included, just as it was for season 1, which more than makes up for that. Both Funimation's season 1 and 2 are supposedly uncensored. In Japan, the original blu-ray releases for season 1 did not have the director's cut, which was introduced in a later box set. In Japan, the original blu-ray releases for season 2 did have the director's cut, and they never had a version without it. So actually it is good that Funimation's version provides something different for the world.",1465776000,,1915,4.6765578635014835
7565613,5,B01995ZHIG,A funny and great series.  The package was damaged when it arrived but the discs were intact.  Anyone know how to get a new plastic case?,1464998400,,137,4.230769230769231
7565614,5,B01995ZHIG,Love it,1464652800,,7,3.0
7565615,4,B01995ZHIG,I love this show but 50 bucks for 10 epsoide is a joke. If they would have added the 2 ova's it would have been worth it.  The animation in this show is top notch. I just would have wished kurumi was in the show a lot more.,1464220800,2,223,3.6458333333333335
7565616,5,B01995ZHIG,It was an enjoyable season just as good as the first if not better,1464048000,,66,3.7857142857142856
7565617,5,B01995ZHIG,"I LOVE this anime it's so funny!!!!
You should get this but first  you have to buy the first  season then the second!!!! The 1st  season is also funny to....and  ( Kurumi ) so awsome!!! I also love the other spirit's they are all freaked awsome!!!!",1463961600,,248,4.326086956521739
7565618,3,B01995ZHIG,"Missing 40 minutes of footage, and unlike Season 1's set, there's no Limited Edition, so you just get the boring bare-bones packaging, making this set pretty underwhelming and overall disappointing. This is basically the Japanese TV Broadcast cut of the show, not the updated, extended Director's Cut that Japan got on Bluray/DVD, meaning that Kadokawa screwed over western fans again, just like what they did with Season 1's Director's Cut Bluray Box set last year. Hopefully Kadokawa lets Funimation release the Director's Cut versions of both seasons some day. The 'reverse-importing' problem is getting ridiculous now. Get your act together, Anime industry.

As for the English dub, if you liked the First Season's dub, you'll like this one too; but if you hated S1's dub, you'll also hate this dub too. I personally prefer the original Japanese voice cast, so dual audio options are always a plus. The villain, Isaac Westcott, and his assistant, Ellen Mathers, are in fact, supposed to be from England, but the dub gave them American accents... Before we start up a dub vs sub debate, I'll just say that I don't hate all anime dubs, and I've enjoyed Funimation's dubs of other shows in the past, but this was particularly bad for me with its odd casting choices, and lack of care in its handling. Names are pronounced incorrectly, certain names and titles have been changed ('Astral Dress' becoming 'Spirit Armor', etc.), and unnecessary changes to the script to make things sound more 'hip', 'cool', and 'American'. Think of how NISA handles localization of JRPGs. That's pretty much how Funimation handled this dub.

Overall I'd say it's a disappointing release, and I pretty much only bought it to support the series in the west, in hopes that more DAL content will make it Stateside in the future.",1462233600,8,1806,4.97682119205298

7565622,5,B01995ZHIG,"As a continuation of season one, this picks up wonderfully and continues with much gusto. I would have liked to see two more full episodes to make it a nice twelve BEFORE the OVA, however that is simply my preference. If you are to watch the series, make certain you get any OVA's, as they are well worth the time.",1460937600,,314,4.25
7565623,5,B01995ZHIG,"Oh my god I have been waiting for the second season to come out for very long time and I can finally have it.

7565625,3,B01995ZHIG,"Don't let the star rating fool you, I love the show, and I'm really happy we finally got the English release for the second season. But, there is one HUGE glaring flaw. This is not the uncut version of the season. Compared to the Japanese Blu-rays the first episode alone as a 241 second difference. About 1:24 of that is the opening (which is not in the first episode of the English version), but the other 2:17 of missing footage is not present, and there is missing footage in several of the other episodes as well.",1459296000,6,518,4.40625

8744472,5,B01995ZHIG,"After watching the first season, I had to get and watch the second season as well.

Pretty much the same as the first season ( and that to me isn't a bad thing ), though it carries the story out a bit farther.

This ends with a possibility of a third season ( unless they wrap everything up in the movie that I can't seem to find ). I have my hopes up for the third season, but I guess time will tell.",1515456000,,401,3.819277108433735
