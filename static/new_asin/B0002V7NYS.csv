I always thought it just looked like fun, but apparently there is a lot of back stabbing, temper tantrums, and anger.  Come on people, did you really expect to make a living at this?  It's a hobby and should be fun!

If you love a documentary and want to see what really happens at these events, this is a great movie.  But it's really not for kids!

Maybe someone else can make a fictional movie so that I can put my head in the sand and pretend it's all in good fun again.",1495929600,,607,4.084745762711864

8032286,4,B0002V7NYS,This guy has heart. You gotta give this guy alot of credit. He does what he loves. And this documentary pulls no punches. I hope Speedo and his kids are doing well. If you like gritty documentaries Speedo is for you.,1301961600,,216,4.2926829268292686
8032287,3,B0002V7NYS,"Speedo is a 2004 documentary about Ed ""Speedo"" Jager - a champion demolition derby driver with a troubled home life. Speedo has attracted excellent reviews, but I thought that the film was mediocre. Jager is somewhat likeable in that he wears his heart on his sleeve and his passion for the demolition derby is contagious. On the other hand, he is also a sore loser who pouts, curses, and gets into fights when he loses. Moreover, the scenes showing Speedo's troubled home life are only mildly interesting and quite depressing.

I'm glad that I saw Speedo, but I can't give it a strong recommendation.",1298851200,2,601,4.778846153846154
8032288,4,B0002V7NYS,"I wasn't expecting too much from this film, but checked it out as I was interested in learning a bit more about the low budget demolition derby culture. After a few minutes, though, I was hooked. The central character is very compelling, and his story is so well developed, I couldn't help but be drawn in. Like ""Hands on a Hardbody,"" this film will surprise you with its depth, its humanity, and its willingness to take the characters on their own terms, without judgment or condescension. The film makers obviously spent a tremendous amount of time and energy making this film, and it shows. There's an acute intelligence at work here, and a tremendous amount of empathy. As an audience member I always appreciate it when an artist doesn't underestimate the audience. What you expect to be a semi-comic, semi-ironic portrayal turns out to be a deeply felt story about real people, struggling with real issues and emotions, an honest to goodness human drama. ""Speedo"" is a real treat. Highly recommended.",1259539200,,1005,4.883040935672515
8032289,3,B0002V7NYS,"This was a an interesting and entertaining documentary of a man that some would say was misunderstood, struggling to make his dream come true. I see it a as story about a man who puts his dream before family to the point of causing a divorce and is made out to be the victim. So it was a good story of morals and ethics, one that I bought hoping more for the demolition derby side of it, but was mildly disappointed. They only showed small portions of the demos. A good story, good filming, one I might watch once in a great while, but nothing real amazing.",1223769600,,557,4.214953271028038
8032290,5,B0002V7NYS,"This award-winning documentary follows Ed ""Speedo"" Jager, a 41-year-old demolition derby driver as he competes during the years 1999-2000 from his home base on Long Island. He is a pistol, a driven man, and someone to contend with, while also being the loving father of two boys and at the same time on the verge of divorce. Filmmaker Jesse Moss (as we learn in the commentary) is attracted first by Jager's competitive performance as he struggles for the recognition he craves and then discovers the complexities of his personal life. Dubbed a ""love story,"" the film celebrates with him the emergence of a fulfilling relationship with another woman, who takes a more sympathetic and active interest in his life as a demo driver and his dreams of becoming a stock car racer.

The film opens a window into a world most audiences would not consider film-worthy, but Moss makes Jager's story fascinating, touching, and finally exciting. When you first see him, grimy, long-haired, and exhausted after a disappointing demolition event, you wonder how you'll ever get interested in him, and by the end of the film, you're cheering along with him - an everyman just doing the best he can to live his dream against the odds. Unusual for a documentary, the DVD includes a commentary by Moss and Jager, who through the process of making this film have become close friends. Definitely worthy seeing.",1198540800,,1390,4.914893617021277
