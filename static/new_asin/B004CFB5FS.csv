4326520,4,B004CFB5FS,"For those unaware, Texas Frightmare Weekend is the biggest horror convention in the southwest; it's pretty much the San Diego Comic Con of horror conventions, in fact, and most of its attendants make it a massive point to save up all year and psych each other up on the forum for the other 362 days a year until it's time for the next one.

One such attendant is Joe Francis, the creator of TEXAS FRIGHTMARE MASSACRE. He is friends with many of the convention regulars and the celebrity guests, and has managed to create an ultra-low-budget film that is both an inside joke to the convention goers and a piece of funny-as-hell cinema all at once.

The film may be billed as a horror, but don't be fooled. While it certainly has its gory or shock moments, for the most part it's a string of laughs. Francis as a bumbling security guard steals every scene he's in, and indie horror diehards will appreciate the hilarious parody cameo of Parrish Randall as a more douchey version of himself.

The film follows a group of young people who are attending the convention; one of them is a complete mess and the others enjoy making fun at his expense and plan to ditch him at the convention. However, he has other plans in mind, and the mayhem spirals from there.

The DVD is one that shouldn't be missed, especially if you yourself are a fan of horror conventions or low-budget horror films. It has such a wink-wink-nudge-nudge attitude about the horror community as only one of its own can write it, and thus is has some moments of pure comedy gold seeded throughout.",1295395200,2,1561,4.564285714285714
4326521,5,B004CFB5FS,This is the movie you waited up all night for cinemax to show when you were thirteen. This movie is funnier than anything to come out of hollywood in along time. Everyone involved does a great job especially Melanie Smith who has the best set to ever be viewed on my 50 inch plasma. The picture and sound on the dvd are really good. The commentary and special features are amazing. This is a very well put together dvd of a movie that has something for the whole family. My grandma loves hers.,1292803200,3,493,4.311827956989247
4326522,5,B004CFB5FS,"If you love horrible horror movies, this is the film for you! It has it all: nudity, blood, massacres, and most importantly crazy bible beater chicks!",1291420800,4,150,4.8076923076923075
8422948,5,B004CFB5FS,This movie introduced me to the horsemask. It influenced my horsemask pinup tattoo.  Which made it on buzz feed as 1 of 14 tattoos that probably were not a good idea....  I personally loved the movie and it was made by some pretty awesome people.,1454803200,,246,4.444444444444445

8422951,4,B004CFB5FS,A damn good time. This film definitely promotes Texas Frightmare but it's also very fun and funny.,1425081600,,98,4.823529411764706
8422952,1,B004CFB5FS,I don't mind horror movies that are so bad they're fun to watch. But this one is just plain bad.,1404604800,,96,3.85
8422953,3,B004CFB5FS,"This is a funny as well as being a low class slasher movie. It would recommend this movie if you want a good laugh, you have a  horse head psycho in the lose while two red necks who want adventure join a security guard company. The two red necks go through basic training with drill sergeants who do a bad impression of R Lee Ermey. If you love comedy with some blood and guts thrown in then this is a movie for you",1404000000,,415,4.0
8422954,1,B004CFB5FS,"Texas has been pumping out indie horror flicks lately like they produce beef and beef byproducts (steer manure) in mass quanties. Some are good, but most are not and suffer from lack of experience and knowledge that's required to produce good movies. TFM falls into the latter category of the last two sentences. It is geared for the younger crowd in their late teens to early 30's, that said I still felt their attempt at silly humor fails on many levels. The story is very loosely written with more adlibbing than structured and the attempt at humor was just bad (I know thats part of their gimmick) and fails to entertain. It was a laborious task just to sit through this (way to long) movie from start to finish, but I made it. This movie is in a category all to itself and that is mindless. It doesn't try to do anything, but be ""Stupid Funny"". I was duped by all the 4 & 5 star reviews and gave this one a try and realized that Amazon reviewers are like Netflix reviewers they are ""WAY TO GENEROUS"" with their 4 & 5 star reviews. A lot of reviewers will mention how great a movie is except for this and that and still give it a 5 star rating. Watch out for those as they do speak volumes about the movie.

8422955,1,B004CFB5FS,"This is another flick that I read reviews about and I was like ok sounds cool, but then I started to watch this and again I was like what did I do and why did I spend 2.99 $ on this utter pices of crap . To all the people that thought this was a good movie need their heads checked , god awful , steer clear",1358553600,,307,3.5970149253731343
8422956,4,B004CFB5FS,"Truly out there horror set at the Texas Frightmare Weekend Convention.  Its not a perfect film, but it know what it is, it doesn't take itself too seriously, keeps the plot moving along and is well acted.  Definitely worth a look.",1327363200,2,230,4.585365853658536
8422957,5,B004CFB5FS,"I was introduced to this movie by a good friend. I have been a die hard cult movie fan since childhood. This movie did not disappoint. I've watched it repeatedly, and can't get enough. I was surprised at the successful comedic elements of the film as well! I especially loved the bloopers. If only there was a sequel.",1304208000,4,317,4.482758620689655
