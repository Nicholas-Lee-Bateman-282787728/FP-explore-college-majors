7863235,5,6304167938,I love Sam elliott. I watch all his movies. I bought this on a whim. I wasn't exactly sure how good it would be. I was surprised. It is an excellent one from start to finish. Do not confuas this with the other movie of the same name. It is only on the vhs format.,1498694400,,263,3.8

7863239,3,6304167938,"Technically this is a great movie.  Two massive explosions are brilliantly filmed and the suspense that goes with them sets the standard for the rest of the film.  Unfortunately the film doesn't really keep you hooked as much  as it could do, and the dialogue contains way to much dumb swearing.  A bit  more thought into the script and the characters would have made this a top  film.  As it is, it's not bad and is worth seeing for the photography  alone.",955065600,9,457,4.487804878048781
