3039231,4,B000ZBEOHY,"It's the Pebble and Bamm Bamm Show - that is the opeming line of the theme song.  I can still remembet it!

The Flintsones (1960-66) was tv's first successful primetime animated show.  But as it was primetime they were looking for an adult audience.  This ""spinoff"" is aimed at the teenage crowd for Saturday morning. Therefore, they decided to revive the classic series but focus on the two children, now teenagers. The show centered on themes that the teenager would relate to but unfortunately it was what adults thought teenagers wanted from the adult perspective.  Therefore, the episodes were rather flimsy (but as a teenager of that time, I enjoyed it.)

Three of the original voices comeback - Alan Reed as Fred Flintstone, Jean Vander Pyl as Wilma Flintstone and Mel Blanc as Barney Rubble. (Bea Benadret - the original Betty Rubble - died in 1968 and Jerry Johnson - the second Betty died shortly after The Flintstones was cancelled in 1966.)

Sally Struthers voiced Pebbles.  In January 1971, All in the Family premiered.  Therefore, you could watch Sally in the morning in Pebbles and Bamm Bamm and then watch a totally different Sally at night in All in the Family. (For the younger ones she was also Babbette in The Gilmore Girls.)

Jay North voiced Bamm Bamm.  But most people will remember him as Dennis, the Menace (1959-63). (And some might remember him for his short lived Indian seriers Maya (1967).

Despite the lackluster storylines, this is a very fun show and definitely something for the adults to remember and the kids to enjoy.",1202169600,10,1554,4.8226415094339625

A chip off the old block or rather a ""pebble off the old Flintstone,"" Pebbles, too, had a catchphrase: ""Yabba Dabba Doozy!"" which [to Bamm-Bamm's chagrin] signaled ""a doozy of an idea"" that typically got the gang into various trouble. A Barney to Pebbles' Fred, Bamm-Bamm, too, cringed at the mention of his best friend's ""brilliant ideas"" and was also drafted into singing lead in their band [The Bedrock Rockers] because of his shower singing which was only good while he was in the shower in ""The Golden Voice"" (a personal favorite of mine). In addition to great character designs, fun new characters Bad Luck Schleprock (voiced by legendary Don Messick), teen inventor Moonrock and Bronto of the Bronto Bunch (both voiced by ""Inch High Private Eye"" Lennie Weinrib) plus great new music from original Flintstones music director Hoyt Curtin, The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show also featured the voices of Sally Struthers (All in the Family) and Jay North (Dennis the Menace) as the teenaged title characters. Not to mention regular appearances from their parents plus an episode featuring the creepy Gruesomes. A little trivia: Sally Struthers also was the voice of ""Charlene Sinclair"" from other prehistoric series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dinosaurs/dp/B000E8NRVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dinosaurs</a>. The only negative I found with the show was that Bamm-Bamm, though a strapping lad, wasn't as super-strong as he was on The Flintstones as ""the world's strongest baby."" Despite this, The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show was one of the better Flintstones spin-offs (my favorite) which I still enjoyed and recommend.

The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show - The Complete Series is a 2-disc (352 min.) set featuring all 16 episodes from the 1971-72 season as originally aired; Full-Frame (1.33:1) video; plus, as extras, the following 4 bonus Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm episodes from The Flintstone Comedy Hour (1972-73): Squawkie Talkie, Suitor Computer, Beauty and the Beast, Bedlam in Bedrock.

3039284,5,B000ZBEOHY,"Firstly i was happy that this dvd was able to play on my region 4 player, as one out of the three dvds I bought did not. Secondly I was very impressed with the artwork on the cover, front and back and inside. Very well done with all the main characters and a lot of support characters appearing. It's a shame they are not going to such effort with the newer releases. To my surprise the  Gruesomes also appeared on the inside cover. I had completley forgotten that, as well as their two appearances on The Flintstones, they had a third appearance on The Pebbles and Bamm Show. I havn't gotten up to their episode yet, but am looking forward to it. This was the first time I have seen The Pebbles and Bamm Bamm show since it was on tv in the early 70s. I wasn't dissapointed it was great colourful fun with the five main gang plus a large cast of supporting characters. As well as being the first Flinstones spin off, in my opinion, it was also the the best. They really should loop it in with The Flinstones when they show reruns. When I first saw this show I was about 5 or 6, I only had a very vague memory of watching The Flinstones with my parents. When The Flintstones finally came back to Aussie tv in 1975, six o clock week nights, I remember waiting what seemed like an eternity to see Pebbles and Bamm Bamm appear. It was - Pebbles isn't born until near the end of the 3rd season and Bamm Bamm is introduced in the fourth. But in this delightful show, you don't have to wait.",1472083200,2,1484,4.207017543859649

3039316,5,B000ZBEOHY,"I chose this rating because I loved the show when I was growing up. I always wonder what ever happen to Pebbles& Bamm-Bamm when the original Flintstones ended. So this where it picks up from the original Flintstones. The voice of Pebbles is the voice of the hit show All in the Family's Sally Struthers and Bamm-Bamm voice is played by Dennis the Menace's Jay North. Which I did not know until I bought this! It takes off with Pebbles & Bamm-Bamm  going to High School where they make some new friends and have new teenage adventures. Like Bronto Bunch motorcycle gang, Moonrock the geeky inventor, Bad-Luck Schleprock and many more... Also Fred, Willma, Barney, Betty are in it. It's a Two Discs so it has 16 Episodes.

3039343,5,B000ZBEOHY,"I think I may have discovered what the ""beyond"" in Bed, Bath and Beyond is!:)

Last night I was looking for new bath towels when I found a small dvd section of items drastically reduced. To my happy surprise I discovered The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show-The Complete Series was reasonably priced.

When I was about eight years old and this was still airing on Saturday morning tv in the 70s I couldn't get enough. It made me think that high school was going to be this fun and magical place where your pet (mistaken for a football player with amazing skill!) could walk through the halls with you and everyone (even the bullies)  would be either friendly or funny, sometimes both! Music and dancing (late 60s style) would also be an everyday thing.

Of course this turned out to not be true, but I didn't know that then and I loved every second. I also didn't realize then that Sally Struthers voiced Pebbles and Jay North (of Dennis the Menace fame) voiced Bamm-Bamm.

Last night as I watched the first few episodes I couldn't believe the memories from my childhood that came rushing back. It looks a lot different to me now, but somehow I enjoyed it just as much...which sort of worries me as an adult!:)

Whether you buy this at Bed, Bath and Beyond or spend your money here, you won't be sorry to own ""The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show,"" especially if this is something you loved when you were little. The show holds up surprisingly well (the dialogue is a lot better than I thought it would be all these years later) and the characters and good fun they all have is quite endearing! Fred, Wilma, Barney and Betty are even along for the ride!

Spending a few nights watching episodes here and there is a great way to treat yourself to some sweet nostalgia and a relaxing time! I'm not ashamed to say that this is a wonderful blast from the past!!",1282867200,10,1845,4.473214285714286
3039344,5,B000ZBEOHY,Very entertaining ennjoyed it greatly.  Haven't seen it in years glad I found it.,1280620800,,81,4.785714285714286
3039345,3,B000ZBEOHY,"Fred and Wilma Flintstone's darling little redheaded daughter Pebbles, has grown up, and stars together with Barney and Betty Rubble's son Bamm Bamm, in their own series, The Pebbles and Bamm Bamm Show (1971-72).  Along with their friends from Bedrock High, they deal with typical teenage situations, with a distinct Stone Age spin.

Unlike The Flintstones (1960-66), which was originally broadcast in prime time, and was something of an examination of suburban life, Pebbles and Bamm Bamm is more intended for kids, and is mostly silliness and lighthearted fun, following the adventures of the teenagers, with their parents in mostly supporting roles.

Pebbles is voiced by Sally Struthers, who would soon become famous as Gloria Stivic, on All In The Family.  And Jay North, TV's Dennis The Menace, is the voice of Bamm Bamm.  Most of the familiar Flintstones voices return, with Alan Reed as Fred, Jean Vander Pyl as Wilma, John Stephenson as Mr. Slate, and Mel Blanc as Barney.  Gay Hartwig replaces the late Bea Benaderet, as Betty Rubble, and also provided the voice of Cindy Curbstone, Pebbles' obnoxious classmate.  And veteran Don Messick, is the voice of ""bad luck"" Schleprock.

Pebbles is headstrong, and constantly getting into whacky situations, and bringing Bamm Bamm and her friends along for the ride.  Cindy is always trying to show Pebbles up, as when they both compete in a photo contest, and Pebbles winds up the subject of some embarrassing photos.  Pebbles usually isn't as boastful as her father, but her promise to get Mick Jadestone and the Rolling Boulders to play at Cindy's party, gets her in hot water.

When Fred loses his voice, Pebbles takes over for her dad as the coach of his baseball team, and adds a distinctive feminine touch.  It's a family affair, when Uncle Hatrock needs help on his ranch, and Pebbles volunteers her family and friends to lend a hand.  Pebbles probably has the most impact, when she becomes honorary mayor of Bedrock, and reorganizes the city's agencies, causing mass chaos.

The Pebbles And Bamm Bamm Show isn't a must see classic, but it is a fun romp, with a different point of view from The Flintstones.  Fans of the original may appreciate seeing the classic characters again.  Image quality is quite good, with nice vibrant colors, and the episodes are subtitled.  The DVD set also includes four episodes from The Flintstone Comedy Hour (1972-73), with Mickey Stevens replacing Sally Struthers, who had by then become quite well known on All In The Family.",1279756800,3,2521,4.964285714285714

3039348,5,B000ZBEOHY,"In releasing classic Hanna Barbera series, Warner Home Video has been inconsistent in preserving the shows as originally presented.  Most notable is the sporadic removal of the laugh track used in many HB shows -- for example, the tracks were removed from the ""Josie and the Pussycats"" DVD release,  resulting not only in awkward pauses where the laugh track originally was, but an overall distortion of how the show was intended to be enjoyed.

While today's television cartoons are produced without laugh tracks, use of the laugh track in 1960s and 1970s cartoons was the custom, and is a reflection of that era.  To preserve the integrity of the original show, the track should not be removed.

Happily, the producers of the ""Pebbles and Bamm Bamm Show"" DVD release have kept the original laugh track, and it completes what is an overall first-rate release.  The show is well written and nicely drawn, the voice talent is terrific, and the digital transfer is bright and sharp.

So, enjoy ""The Pebbles and Bamm Bamm Show"" as it originallly aired...and laugh along bwith the laugh track!",1236384000,22,1089,4.918032786885246

3039354,5,B000ZBEOHY,"I was a little too young to watch the original animated ""The Flintstones,"" which was first run  on ABC from 1960-1966. Of course, I was aware of ""The Flintstones"" and watched it in heavily syndicated reruns. ""The Pebbles And Bamm-Bamm Show,"" the delightful 16 Episode Saturday morning sequel, first ran on CBS in 1971 when I was about five or six years old. THIS show is part of my Saturday morning memories!
  On ""The Flintstones"", Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm were babies, and I never cared much for babies or children in shows, even when I was a child. For their own self-titled show, Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm are teenagers. The title characters are excellently voiced by Sally Struthers (""All In The Family"") and Jay North (""Dennis The Menace""). They hang out with a new gang of teenage friends, including The Bronto Bunch Motorcycle Gang, astrologically-inclined Wiggy, hippie Penny, inventor Moonrock, snobby Cindy and Fabian, and Bad Luck Schleprock (""Hi, everybody, miserable day, isn't it... wowsie, wowsie, woo-woo!""). Fred, Barney, Wilma, Betty, and Mr. Slate return, but Dino The Dinasour is noticeably absent. He is replaced here by Bamm-Bamm's pet Snoots and Pebbles' pet elephant Wooley, who, in one episode, flies exactly like Disney's Dumbo.
  Watching this series again after SO MANY years, I realized that ""Pebbles And Bamm-Bamm"" plots are basically recycled from ""I Love Lucy."" It is basically bedlam in Bedrock when Pebbles gets ideas in her head. But Pebbles is enthusiastic, energetic, and good-hearted. She's not scatterbrained like Lucy is, but Bamm-Bamm humorously and truthfully says, ""You've got rocks in your head, Pebbles...when Pebbles makes up her mind, it's a state of mind over matter. Pebbles makes up her mind and NOTHING else matters."" My most vivid memory of the series is actually the series' BEST episode. In ""The Golden Voice,"" Pebbles discovers that Bamm-Bamm has a beautiful singing voice when he's in the shower. For this episode, he repeatedly sings the phrase, ""Don't rock now, because our love has grown stone cold."" Outside of the shower, his singing is terrible.  Pebbles takes him to see Madame Fortismo, who turns him into a vocal freak sensation. In other memorable episodes, Pebbles gets involved in football and baseball;  although she knows absolutely nothing about either sport, Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm become Grand Prix race car  drivers in order to retrieve a special fuel for Fred and Barney, and chaos reigns when Pebbles becomes honorary mayor of Bedrock for one week.
  I also seem to recall a TV Special when Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm got married and had a baby of their own. That would make Fred, Barney, Wilma, and Betty grandparents! I don't need to go into that. I hope you love and enjoy ""The Pebbles And Bamm-Bamm Show"" as much as I do!",1208649600,5,2789,5.030368763557484

3039356,4,B000ZBEOHY,"Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm return to your TV screen in this latest outing from Hanna-Barbera's Classic Collection series, showcasing the misadventures of the now-teenaged daughter of Fred Flintstone and the adopted son of Barney Rubble.

This show, which appears to be an attempt to present HB's venerable series THE FLINTSTONES for a new and younger audience while also stealing a little thunder from Filmation Studios' long-running ARCHIES series (which, at the time this show aired, was the toast of Saturday Morning), depicts Pebbles Flintstone (voiced by Sally Struthers, of ALL IN THE FAMILY fame) and Bamm-Bamm Rubble (Jay North, of TV's DENNIS THE MENACE) in their high school years.  In both cases, neither apple has fallen far from the tree: Bamm-Bamm retains his father's level-headedness and stalwart passivity, while Pebbles shares her father's impetuousness, high spirits and penchant for enthusiastic scheming.  This last quality often gets her AND Bamm-Bamm into as much trouble as it did their fathers, but luckily they have their famous parents (with Alan Reed, Jean Vander Pyl and Mel Blanc all returning to voice Fred, Wilma and Barney, and Gay Hartwig taking over Betty for the late Bea Benaderet) and a group of steady pals to help them out: earthy, chubby Penny (Mitzi McCall), scatterbrained amateur astrologer Wiggy (also Gay Hartwig, whose vocals for this character are a direct lift from Jo Anne Worley), and brainy inventor Moonrock (Lennie Weinrib), who at times seems to be a prehistoric ancestor of the Archies' own Dilton Doiley.  Rivals appear in the form of rich-kid snobs Cindy (Hartwig yet again) and Fabian (Carl Esser), and comedy relief shows up in the form of ne'er-do-well motorcycle gang the Bronto Bunch (whose leader Bronto is also voiced by Weinrib) and the perpetually unlucky Schleprock (Don Messick).  Though the series owes quite a bit to THE ARCHIES, there is also a thread derived from the Annette Funicello/Frankie Avalon BEACH PARTY films: the antics of the Bronto Bunch occasionally recall Harvey Lembeck's demented Eric Von Zipper and his Rat Pack gang of goofball bikers.

The show itself has been criticized for being flimsy when compared to the original FLINTSTONES series, but one must remember that THE FLINTSTONES was written as a prime-time series for adults.  PEBBLES AND BAMM-BAMM was specifically done for kids, and in many cases was its audience's first real exposure to the Flintstones.  Most of the episodes, to my eye, are standard teen fare that hold up as well as anything else of its time (or even this time) with the usual FLINTSTONES sight gags of modern conveniences adapted for prehistoric settings in full display.

This series is presented with reasonably clean transfers on two single-side discs and colorful outer artwork, though I am not a fan of the rather flimsy cardstock storage cases Warner Brothers uses for these sets.  The set has all 16 half-hour episodes plus four ten-minute episodes made for 1972's THE FLINTSTONE COMEDY HOUR as a special feature.  All in all, it adds up to one yabba-dabba-doozy of a set.  Enjoy.",1206748800,6,3102,5.132936507936508
3039357,5,B000ZBEOHY,"I live in Canada and we haven't seen reruns of The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show for decades here on TV, so I was thrilled when I heard that this classic show was being released on DVD!!! It is a great blast from the past!!! Listening to Sally Struthers' and Jay North's voices as the lead characters brings back fond memories of watching these episodes on Saturday mornings!

This set is a must-have for children of the 1970s (such as myself) who grew up with these great characters, and I'm sure that today's younger generation will enjoy it, especially those who are unaware that the Flintstones' offspring had their own show.

The colors are beautiful and bright and the transfer to DVD was very well done, especially for a show that is now 37 years old! I hope that Warner Home Video will continue releasing the other Flintstones series that followed Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm!",1206057600,2,875,4.712418300653595
3039358,5,B000ZBEOHY,"I totally disagree with the previous reviewer. This series was a wondeful part of my Saturday morning TV habit. The character designs, background styling, music, voice-cast are all top-notch. It's the only spin-off of ""The Flintstones"" that kept the charm of the original, while moving the property forward for a new TV audience. The original voices of Fred, Wilma and Barney (Alan Reed, Jean Vander Pyl and Mel Blanc) returned to voice their characters. Sally Struthers and Jay North were both incredible in their parts as well.

Everything about this show -- and other Hanna-Barbera series of this same time period (""Josie and the Pussycats,"" ""The Harlem Globetrotters,"" ""Help! It's the Hair Bear Bunch"") was outstanding -- and leaps and bounds above the product from other animation houses. Honestly -- try watching anything from Filmation, whether it be The Archies, or any other title, and you'll see what I mean.",1205798400,7,918,5.12
3039359,5,B000ZBEOHY,"""The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show"" is an animated 1971 Hanna-Barbera spin-off of the 1960's ""The Flintstones"" television series that follows the comedy adventures of teen-age Pebbles Flintstone and Bamm-Bamm Rubble.  In this series, their famed parents (Fred and Wilma Flintstone and Barney and Betty Rubble) are back in supporting roles, along with a new cast of stone-age teenagers.  Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's Archie-inspired friends are more than a little unique and include astrologically obsessed Wiggy Rockstone, down-to-earth Penny Pillar, and brainy Moonrock Crater.  The Bronto Bunch (Bronto, Noodles, Stub, and Zonk) alternates between functioning as a bothersome motorcycle gang and much-needed allies, while Cindy Curbstone and Fabian Fabquartz fill the role of Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's conceited rivals.  Schleprock (""Wowzie Wowzie Woo Woo!"") is the consistent harbinger of bad luck.  Pebbles' wooly mammoth Wooly and Bamm-Bamm's pet brontosaurus Snoots round out the cast.

Comedy reigns throughout all 16 episodes - - from simple word play to slapstick and satire.  While Pebbles' intentions are always good, her definite knack for misinterpreting a situation often gets her and her friends into all sorts of trouble.  She definitely takes after her father!

Four 8-minute bonus ""Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm"" episodes from the 1972 ""The Flintstones Comedy Hour"" round out this two-disc set.  The smooth animation and clever storylines make this one of the best animated series ever created and produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions.  Don't miss your opportunity to own it!

3039360,3,B000ZBEOHY,"This was a poor sequel to the Classic Flintstones series, it once and for all convinced me that Hanna-Barbera had lost their touch.  When I would watch these uninspired stories as a child I would wonder what happened to the people who brought us the original series.  And the awful synthesized music soundtrack was dreadful.  The characters were dull, the stories were routine.

To be fair, Hanna-Barbera did come up with a better sequel a decade later with the Fred and Barney Show. So the well of ideas was not dry, it just was not used for this series.  Those giving 5 stars based on their memory could be disappointed when they see the show again.",1205625600,3,651,4.577586206896552
3039361,5,B000ZBEOHY,"Okay, mostly us hardcore seventies children and our younger brothers and sisters who watched the USA Cartoon Express in the late 80s and early 90s know anything about this. This was as amusing as it was underrated.

Basically, it's Pebbles & Bamm Bamm a few years after their infancy in the Flintstones and now into their teenage years. Some new and interesting friends are addded to the cast. The nerdy Moonrock (""I concur..."") who is clearly based on Dilton Doiley from the Archie cartoons, hippy chick Wiggy (""Oh my stars!"" remember, this aired in 1971-72), Pebbles' best bud Penny, Hells Angles prototypes (actually closer to Erich Von Zipper and the Rats from the Beach Party flix) The Bronto Bunch, and best of all the loveable jinx Bad Luck Schleprock (""Wowsy Wowsy woo woo"" is his catchphrase) who literally walked around with a strom cloud over his head.

Overall, while there are a few dated aspects to all of this, the series was quite creative and highly amusing if not belly-laugh inducing. The seventies and eighties children who initially enjoyed this will be pleased that it is about as good as they remember and their children should also like this. So get it, relive some laughs and memories, and clue your children into what they missed out on. I have no doubt they'll like it themselves.",1204502400,2,1307,4.804444444444444

3273728,4,B000ZBEOHY,"It's the Pebble and Bamm Bamm Show - that is the opeming line of the theme song.  I can still remembet it!

The Flintsones (1960-66) was tv's first successful primetime animated show.  But as it was primetime they were looking for an adult audience.  This ""spinoff"" is aimed at the teenage crowd for Saturday morning. Therefore, they decided to revive the classic series but focus on the two children, now teenagers. The show centered on themes that the teenager would relate to but unfortunately it was what adults thought teenagers wanted from the adult perspective.  Therefore, the episodes were rather flimsy (but as a teenager of that time, I enjoyed it.)

Three of the original voices comeback - Alan Reed as Fred Flintstone, Jean Vander Pyl as Wilma Flintstone and Mel Blanc as Barney Rubble. (Bea Benadret - the original Betty Rubble - died in 1968 and Jerry Johnson - the second Betty died shortly after The Flintstones was cancelled in 1966.)

Sally Struthers voiced Pebbles.  In January 1971, All in the Family premiered.  Therefore, you could watch Sally in the morning in Pebbles and Bamm Bamm and then watch a totally different Sally at night in All in the Family. (For the younger ones she was also Babbette in The Gilmore Girls.)

Jay North voiced Bamm Bamm.  But most people will remember him as Dennis, the Menace (1959-63). (And some might remember him for his short lived Indian seriers Maya (1967).

Despite the lackluster storylines, this is a very fun show and definitely something for the adults to remember and the kids to enjoy.",1202169600,10,1554,4.8226415094339625

A chip off the old block or rather a ""pebble off the old Flintstone,"" Pebbles, too, had a catchphrase: ""Yabba Dabba Doozy!"" which [to Bamm-Bamm's chagrin] signaled ""a doozy of an idea"" that typically got the gang into various trouble. A Barney to Pebbles' Fred, Bamm-Bamm, too, cringed at the mention of his best friend's ""brilliant ideas"" and was also drafted into singing lead in their band [The Bedrock Rockers] because of his shower singing which was only good while he was in the shower in ""The Golden Voice"" (a personal favorite of mine). In addition to great character designs, fun new characters Bad Luck Schleprock (voiced by legendary Don Messick), teen inventor Moonrock and Bronto of the Bronto Bunch (both voiced by ""Inch High Private Eye"" Lennie Weinrib) plus great new music from original Flintstones music director Hoyt Curtin, The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show also featured the voices of Sally Struthers (All in the Family) and Jay North (Dennis the Menace) as the teenaged title characters. Not to mention regular appearances from their parents plus an episode featuring the creepy Gruesomes.

Secondly I was very impressed with the artwork on the cover, front and back and inside. Very well done with all the main characters and a lot of support characters appearing. It's a shame they are not going to such effort with the newer releases. To my surprise the  Gruesomes also appeared on the inside cover. I had completley forgotten that, as well as their two appearances on The Flintstones, they had a third appearance on The Pebbles and Bamm Show. I havn't gotten up to their episode yet, but am looking forward to it. This was the first time I have seen The Pebbles and Bamm Bamm show since it was on tv in the early 70s. I wasn't dissapointed it was great colourful fun with the five main gang plus a large cast of supporting characters. As well as being the first Flinstones spin off, in my opinion, it was also the the best. They really should loop it in with The Flinstones when they show reruns. When I first saw this show I was about 5 or 6, I only had a very vague memory of watching The Flinstones with my parents. When The Flintstones finally came back to Aussie tv in 1975, six o clock week nights, I remember waiting what seemed like an eternity to see Pebbles and Bamm Bamm appear. It was - Pebbles isn't born until near the end of the 3rd season and Bamm Bamm is introduced in the fourth. But in this delightful show, you don't have to wait.",1472083200,2,1484,4.207017543859649

3273840,5,B000ZBEOHY,"I think I may have discovered what the ""beyond"" in Bed, Bath and Beyond is!:)

Last night I was looking for new bath towels when I found a small dvd section of items drastically reduced. To my happy surprise I discovered The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show-The Complete Series was reasonably priced.

When I was about eight years old and this was still airing on Saturday morning tv in the 70s I couldn't get enough. It made me think that high school was going to be this fun and magical place where your pet (mistaken for a football player with amazing skill!) could walk through the halls with you and everyone (even the bullies)  would be either friendly or funny, sometimes both! Music and dancing (late 60s style) would also be an everyday thing.

Of course this turned out to not be true, but I didn't know that then and I loved every second. I also didn't realize then that Sally Struthers voiced Pebbles and Jay North (of Dennis the Menace fame) voiced Bamm-Bamm.

Last night as I watched the first few episodes I couldn't believe the memories from my childhood that came rushing back. It looks a lot different to me now, but somehow I enjoyed it just as much...which sort of worries me as an adult!:)

Whether you buy this at Bed, Bath and Beyond or spend your money here, you won't be sorry to own ""The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show,"" especially if this is something you loved when you were little. The show holds up surprisingly well (the dialogue is a lot better than I thought it would be all these years later) and the characters and good fun they all have is quite endearing! Fred, Wilma, Barney and Betty are even along for the ride!

Spending a few nights watching episodes here and there is a great way to treat yourself to some sweet nostalgia and a relaxing time! I'm not ashamed to say that this is a wonderful blast from the past!!",1282867200,10,1845,4.473214285714286
3273841,5,B000ZBEOHY,Very entertaining ennjoyed it greatly.  Haven't seen it in years glad I found it.,1280620800,,81,4.785714285714286
3273842,3,B000ZBEOHY,"Fred and Wilma Flintstone's darling little redheaded daughter Pebbles, has grown up, and stars together with Barney and Betty Rubble's son Bamm Bamm, in their own series, The Pebbles and Bamm Bamm Show (1971-72).  Along with their friends from Bedrock High, they deal with typical teenage situations, with a distinct Stone Age spin.

Unlike The Flintstones (1960-66), which was originally broadcast in prime time, and was something of an examination of suburban life, Pebbles and Bamm Bamm is more intended for kids, and is mostly silliness and lighthearted fun, following the adventures of the teenagers, with their parents in mostly supporting roles.

Pebbles is voiced by Sally Struthers, who would soon become famous as Gloria Stivic, on All In The Family.  And Jay North, TV's Dennis The Menace, is the voice of Bamm Bamm.  Most of the familiar Flintstones voices return, with Alan Reed as Fred, Jean Vander Pyl as Wilma, John Stephenson as Mr. Slate, and Mel Blanc as Barney.  Gay Hartwig replaces the late Bea Benaderet, as Betty Rubble, and also provided the voice of Cindy Curbstone, Pebbles' obnoxious classmate.  And veteran Don Messick, is the voice of ""bad luck"" Schleprock.

Pebbles is headstrong, and constantly getting into whacky situations, and bringing Bamm Bamm and her friends along for the ride.  Cindy is always trying to show Pebbles up, as when they both compete in a photo contest, and Pebbles winds up the subject of some embarrassing photos.  Pebbles usually isn't as boastful as her father, but her promise to get Mick Jadestone and the Rolling Boulders to play at Cindy's party, gets her in hot water.

When Fred loses his voice, Pebbles takes over for her dad as the coach of his baseball team, and adds a distinctive feminine touch.  It's a family affair, when Uncle Hatrock needs help on his ranch, and Pebbles volunteers her family and friends to lend a hand.  Pebbles probably has the most impact, when she becomes honorary mayor of Bedrock, and reorganizes the city's agencies, causing mass chaos.

The Pebbles And Bamm Bamm Show isn't a must see classic, but it is a fun romp, with a different point of view from The Flintstones.  Fans of the original may appreciate seeing the classic characters again.  Image quality is quite good, with nice vibrant colors, and the episodes are subtitled.  The DVD set also includes four episodes from The Flintstone Comedy Hour (1972-73), with Mickey Stevens replacing Sally Struthers, who had by then become quite well known on All In The Family.",1279756800,3,2521,4.964285714285714

3273845,5,B000ZBEOHY,"In releasing classic Hanna Barbera series, Warner Home Video has been inconsistent in preserving the shows as originally presented.  Most notable is the sporadic removal of the laugh track used in many HB shows -- for example, the tracks were removed from the ""Josie and the Pussycats"" DVD release,  resulting not only in awkward pauses where the laugh track originally was, but an overall distortion of how the show was intended to be enjoyed.

While today's television cartoons are produced without laugh tracks, use of the laugh track in 1960s and 1970s cartoons was the custom, and is a reflection of that era.  To preserve the integrity of the original show, the track should not be removed.

Happily, the producers of the ""Pebbles and Bamm Bamm Show"" DVD release have kept the original laugh track, and it completes what is an overall first-rate release.  The show is well written and nicely drawn, the voice talent is terrific, and the digital transfer is bright and sharp.

So, enjoy ""The Pebbles and Bamm Bamm Show"" as it originallly aired...and laugh along bwith the laugh track!",1236384000,22,1089,4.918032786885246

3273851,5,B000ZBEOHY,"I was a little too young to watch the original animated ""The Flintstones,"" which was first run  on ABC from 1960-1966. Of course, I was aware of ""The Flintstones"" and watched it in heavily syndicated reruns. ""The Pebbles And Bamm-Bamm Show,"" the delightful 16 Episode Saturday morning sequel, first ran on CBS in 1971 when I was about five or six years old. THIS show is part of my Saturday morning memories!
  On ""The Flintstones"", Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm were babies, and I never cared much for babies or children in shows, even when I was a child. For their own self-titled show, Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm are teenagers. The title characters are excellently voiced by Sally Struthers (""All In The Family"") and Jay North (""Dennis The Menace""). They hang out with a new gang of teenage friends, including The Bronto Bunch Motorcycle Gang, astrologically-inclined Wiggy, hippie Penny, inventor Moonrock, snobby Cindy and Fabian, and Bad Luck Schleprock (""Hi, everybody, miserable day, isn't it... wowsie, wowsie, woo-woo!""). Fred, Barney, Wilma, Betty, and Mr. Slate return, but Dino The Dinasour is noticeably absent. He is replaced here by Bamm-Bamm's pet Snoots and Pebbles' pet elephant Wooley, who, in one episode, flies exactly like Disney's Dumbo.
  Watching this series again after SO MANY years, I realized that ""Pebbles And Bamm-Bamm"" plots are basically recycled from ""I Love Lucy."" It is basically bedlam in Bedrock when Pebbles gets ideas in her head. But Pebbles is enthusiastic, energetic, and good-hearted. She's not scatterbrained like Lucy is, but Bamm-Bamm humorously and truthfully says, ""You've got rocks in your head, Pebbles...when Pebbles makes up her mind, it's a state of mind over matter. Pebbles makes up her mind and NOTHING else matters."" My most vivid memory of the series is actually the series' BEST episode. In ""The Golden Voice,"" Pebbles discovers that Bamm-Bamm has a beautiful singing voice when he's in the shower. For this episode, he repeatedly sings the phrase, ""Don't rock now, because our love has grown stone cold."" Outside of the shower, his singing is terrible.  Pebbles takes him to see Madame Fortismo, who turns him into a vocal freak sensation. In other memorable episodes, Pebbles gets involved in football and baseball;  although she knows absolutely nothing about either sport, Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm become Grand Prix race car  drivers in order to retrieve a special fuel for Fred and Barney, and chaos reigns when Pebbles becomes honorary mayor of Bedrock for one week.
  I also seem to recall a TV Special when Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm got married and had a baby of their own. That would make Fred, Barney, Wilma, and Betty grandparents! I don't need to go into that. I hope you love and enjoy ""The Pebbles And Bamm-Bamm Show"" as much as I do!",1208649600,5,2789,5.030368763557484

3273853,4,B000ZBEOHY,"Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm return to your TV screen in this latest outing from Hanna-Barbera's Classic Collection series, showcasing the misadventures of the now-teenaged daughter of Fred Flintstone and the adopted son of Barney Rubble.

This show, which appears to be an attempt to present HB's venerable series THE FLINTSTONES for a new and younger audience while also stealing a little thunder from Filmation Studios' long-running ARCHIES series (which, at the time this show aired, was the toast of Saturday Morning), depicts Pebbles Flintstone (voiced by Sally Struthers, of ALL IN THE FAMILY fame) and Bamm-Bamm Rubble (Jay North, of TV's DENNIS THE MENACE) in their high school years.  In both cases, neither apple has fallen far from the tree: Bamm-Bamm retains his father's level-headedness and stalwart passivity, while Pebbles shares her father's impetuousness, high spirits and penchant for enthusiastic scheming.  This last quality often gets her AND Bamm-Bamm into as much trouble as it did their fathers, but luckily they have their famous parents (with Alan Reed, Jean Vander Pyl and Mel Blanc all returning to voice Fred, Wilma and Barney, and Gay Hartwig taking over Betty for the late Bea Benaderet) and a group of steady pals to help them out: earthy, chubby Penny (Mitzi McCall), scatterbrained amateur astrologer Wiggy (also Gay Hartwig, whose vocals for this character are a direct lift from Jo Anne Worley), and brainy inventor Moonrock (Lennie Weinrib), who at times seems to be a prehistoric ancestor of the Archies' own Dilton Doiley.  Rivals appear in the form of rich-kid snobs Cindy (Hartwig yet again) and Fabian (Carl Esser), and comedy relief shows up in the form of ne'er-do-well motorcycle gang the Bronto Bunch (whose leader Bronto is also voiced by Weinrib) and the perpetually unlucky Schleprock (Don Messick).  Though the series owes quite a bit to THE ARCHIES, there is also a thread derived from the Annette Funicello/Frankie Avalon BEACH PARTY films: the antics of the Bronto Bunch occasionally recall Harvey Lembeck's demented Eric Von Zipper and his Rat Pack gang of goofball bikers.

The show itself has been criticized for being flimsy when compared to the original FLINTSTONES series, but one must remember that THE FLINTSTONES was written as a prime-time series for adults.  PEBBLES AND BAMM-BAMM was specifically done for kids, and in many cases was its audience's first real exposure to the Flintstones.  Most of the episodes, to my eye, are standard teen fare that hold up as well as anything else of its time (or even this time) with the usual FLINTSTONES sight gags of modern conveniences adapted for prehistoric settings in full display.

This series is presented with reasonably clean transfers on two single-side discs and colorful outer artwork, though I am not a fan of the rather flimsy cardstock storage cases Warner Brothers uses for these sets.  The set has all 16 half-hour episodes plus four ten-minute episodes made for 1972's THE FLINTSTONE COMEDY HOUR as a special feature.  All in all, it adds up to one yabba-dabba-doozy of a set.  Enjoy.",1206748800,6,3102,5.132936507936508
3273854,5,B000ZBEOHY,"I live in Canada and we haven't seen reruns of The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show for decades here on TV, so I was thrilled when I heard that this classic show was being released on DVD!!! It is a great blast from the past!!! Listening to Sally Struthers' and Jay North's voices as the lead characters brings back fond memories of watching these episodes on Saturday mornings!

This set is a must-have for children of the 1970s (such as myself) who grew up with these great characters, and I'm sure that today's younger generation will enjoy it, especially those who are unaware that the Flintstones' offspring had their own show.

The colors are beautiful and bright and the transfer to DVD was very well done, especially for a show that is now 37 years old! I hope that Warner Home Video will continue releasing the other Flintstones series that followed Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm!",1206057600,2,875,4.712418300653595

It's the only spin-off of ""The Flintstones"" that kept the charm of the original, while moving the property forward for a new TV audience. The original voices of Fred, Wilma and Barney (Alan Reed, Jean Vander Pyl and Mel Blanc) returned to voice their characters. Sally Struthers and Jay North were both incredible in their parts as well.

Everything about this show -- and other Hanna-Barbera series of this same time period (""Josie and the Pussycats,"" ""The Harlem Globetrotters,"" ""Help! It's the Hair Bear Bunch"") was outstanding -- and leaps and bounds above the product from other animation houses. Honestly -- try watching anything from Filmation, whether it be The Archies, or any other title, and you'll see what I mean.",1205798400,7,918,5.12
3273856,5,B000ZBEOHY,"""The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show"" is an animated 1971 Hanna-Barbera spin-off of the 1960's ""The Flintstones"" television series that follows the comedy adventures of teen-age Pebbles Flintstone and Bamm-Bamm Rubble.  In this series, their famed parents (Fred and Wilma Flintstone and Barney and Betty Rubble) are back in supporting roles, along with a new cast of stone-age teenagers.  Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's Archie-inspired friends are more than a little unique and include astrologically obsessed Wiggy Rockstone, down-to-earth Penny Pillar, and brainy Moonrock Crater.  The Bronto Bunch (Bronto, Noodles, Stub, and Zonk) alternates between functioning as a bothersome motorcycle gang and much-needed allies, while Cindy Curbstone and Fabian Fabquartz fill the role of Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's conceited rivals.  Schleprock (""Wowzie Wowzie Woo Woo!"") is the consistent harbinger of bad luck.  Pebbles' wooly mammoth Wooly and Bamm-Bamm's pet brontosaurus Snoots round out the cast.

Comedy reigns throughout all 16 episodes - - from simple word play to slapstick and satire.  While Pebbles' intentions are always good, her definite knack for misinterpreting a situation often gets her and her friends into all sorts of trouble.  She definitely takes after her father!

Four 8-minute bonus ""Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm"" episodes from the 1972 ""The Flintstones Comedy Hour"" round out this two-disc set.  The smooth animation and clever storylines make this one of the best animated series ever created and produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions.  Don't miss your opportunity to own it!  Yabba-Dabba-Doosie!!",1205712000,7,1598,5.753191489361702
3273857,3,B000ZBEOHY,"This was a poor sequel to the Classic Flintstones series, it once and for all convinced me that Hanna-Barbera had lost their touch.  When I would watch these uninspired stories as a child I would wonder what happened to the people who brought us the original series.  And the awful synthesized music soundtrack was dreadful.  The characters were dull, the stories were routine.

To be fair, Hanna-Barbera did come up with a better sequel a decade later with the Fred and Barney Show. So the well of ideas was not dry, it just was not used for this series.  Those giving 5 stars based on their memory could be disappointed when they see the show again.",1205625600,3,651,4.577586206896552
3273858,5,B000ZBEOHY,"Okay, mostly us hardcore seventies children and our younger brothers and sisters who watched the USA Cartoon Express in the late 80s and early 90s know anything about this. This was as amusing as it was underrated.

Basically, it's Pebbles & Bamm Bamm a few years after their infancy in the Flintstones and now into their teenage years. Some new and interesting friends are addded to the cast. The nerdy Moonrock (""I concur..."") who is clearly based on Dilton Doiley from the Archie cartoons, hippy chick Wiggy (""Oh my stars!"" remember, this aired in 1971-72), Pebbles' best bud Penny, Hells Angles prototypes (actually closer to Erich Von Zipper and the Rats from the Beach Party flix) The Bronto Bunch, and best of all the loveable jinx Bad Luck Schleprock (""Wowsy Wowsy woo woo"" is his catchphrase) who literally walked around with a strom cloud over his head.

Overall, while there are a few dated aspects to all of this, the series was quite creative and highly amusing if not belly-laugh inducing. The seventies and eighties children who initially enjoyed this will be pleased that it is about as good as they remember and their children should also like this. So get it, relive some laughs and memories, and clue your children into what they missed out on. I have no doubt they'll like it themselves.",1204502400,2,1307,4.804444444444444
3273859,5,B000ZBEOHY,"Greetings from Lima-Peru (South America):
Finally; it's here a very long awaiting release on DVD: Pebbles & Bamm Bamm and all the gang!
I enjoyed the original soundtrack with the spanish version so much (dubbed in Mexico in that same time with very famous and talented voices) that I really hope this DVD has the spanish audio as well!
Hopefully it'd also have a ""Play music videos only"" option for playing the animated clips of the Bedrock Rockers that sparkled each episode!
Yabba Dabba Groovie!!
