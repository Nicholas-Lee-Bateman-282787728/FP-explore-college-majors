5789184,5,B00DCLT8RA,"My wife, she isn't into sci-fi as much as I am. And me, I'm not into SyFy much to be honest (note the difference).

However, there is absolutely no way we would have missed Sharknado for all the money in the world.

And. We. Weren't. Disappointed.

I don't even know where to begin, so I simply will not. You must watch this for yourself. Keep an open mind. I live-tweeted the entire movie along with 3/4 of Twitter. The tweets were almost better than the movie (but not really...the movie...is...so...AWESOME!).

There will never be a time like this when humanity came together as one, unless there is a Sharknado II that reaches our television screens.

I will never look at a chainsaw the same way again!",1373587200,55,707,4.579365079365079
5789185,5,B00DCLT8RA,"Out of all the SYFY offerings about killer sharks and the vapid bikini beach bodies they eat, this one is hands down the best. Camp, stupid, awesome, mind-bogglingly put together with no regard for science, physics, or common sense, its what all the other SYFY shark movies wanted to be, but could never quite reach.",1373500800,92,316,4.763636363636364
5789186,4,B00DCLT8RA,"Look, it's titled Sharknado, so you know what you're in for when it starts.  Sharks and tornadoes for one thing.  Cheesy FX for another.  All things are enjoyable and laughable to a certain extent.  What's not expected is the cast.  Well, Tara Reid is somewhat expected; she's fallen hard (like her one post-op breast).  Ian Ziering appears to be the exact age as when he was living in the 90210 zip code, having fallen on equally hard times since graduating as the only 35-year old senior in High School, moving less than ten miles to Santa Monica and working as washed up surfer turned bartender.  Not a big surprise.  Shocking, however, is the presence of John Heard (Home Alone, Big).  From sky high to SyFy, a darn shame.

On to the movie.  Tornadoes - obviously and explicitly described as a result of global warming - are causing severe flooding.  Actually, a news report midway through says it's a hurricane, but Sharkicane and Hurrishark don't flow as well as the Sharknado portmanteau.  Anyway, along with the flooding and massive waves comes highly intelligent, vicious, super-smart sharks that swim the city streets, bust through manhole covers, and dive through living room windows in the search for human blood.  Think of it as the El Camino to Deep Blue Sea's Rolls Royce.

Hilarious and campy from beginning to end, if you like this kind of movie and enjoyed the other hybrid shark movies on SyFy, you will thoroughly enjoy this film.  The FX is a mix of decent and atrocious.  Overall, it's probably the best of all the SyFy shark movies, probably the result of upgrading from C to B-level celebrities.  Certainly more entertaining than Grown Ups 2 or the Lone Ranger, both suspiciously released at the same time frame to steal some of Sharknado's thunder, this is a film that I will watch again.",1373500800,13,1813,4.756410256410256
5789187,4,B00DCLT8RA,"Stars: Tara Reid,Ian Ziering and John Heard.
Written by Thunder Levin,Directed by Anthony C Ferrante. Sharknado

So,The set-up of a guy trying to do the right things ,finally,Actually makes the viewer feel for him during this surreal disaster.
The opening is quite a shocker,No really,There are some shocks and roller-coaster rides in this flick.
Enjoyed the cast,John Heard (Home Alone dad) is quite a Cheers-like `Norm character' who wants his bar tab kept open as long as he has to fend off shark attacks with his bar stool.
Cannot believe some of the sets and special effects achieved, One scene reminded me Universal Studios Tram parted the Red Sea in a living room,It's a compliment peoples.

5789191,4,B00DCLT8RA,For a Syfy movie this was actually not bad. Their movies are usually beyond awful. This movie is so ridiculous it's fun to watch. The sharks are supposed to be normal sharks but they do amazingly well out of water. One shark climbs up a rope after someone and another rides on the top of a moving car and then bites through it trying to get the people inside. Then someone has been swallowed by a shark with only his lower legs sticking out of the shark's mouth. The hero of the film seems to think he can still save the guy and tries to pull him out. Everyone is surprised when the legs come of in the hero's hands. The thing about this movie is it's so fast paced you really don't have time to think about how bad it is. It also has lots of gore.,1501632000,,748,4.0608108108108105

I had not seen this movie on tv.  (I don't have reception).  I was led to the movie by a web blog that I had found while trying to understand why I so much enjoy the movie, 'Twister'.  The blogger had a list of tornado films, and Sharknado was amonst them.

I don't know if a second viewing will have the same effect, but, without a doubt, it did the trick last night.  I made the mistake of watching the interviews, confirming, yet again, that seeing - hearing the artist speak, (or anyone else), about the art- takes away from the individual enjoyment and individual fantasy of it..  Here you have a shark-in-your face riot.  Let it be.

I was sorry that John Heard's character, 'George', was killed off so early in the film, but this is not a film to judge.  The purpose is catharsis.",1471910400,,960,4.367231638418079

The Sharknado films have now become cult classics and like the 'Super Bowl' for the Syfy channel. Personally, I hope they keep making them. The cheesier, the better. This is where it all began. The film is about a group of people led by Fin Shepard, trying to survive a tornado filled with deadly sharks, AKA Sharknado. Fin, Nova, George, April, Baz, Claudia and Matt try to stick together and survive and come up with unique ways of fighting the sharks.

The basic plot is a tornado just happens to scoop up a bunch of sharks & rains them down on California when they proceed to kill people. Its simply & crazy but once you start watching its hard to look away from what you are witnessing. Its one of those films where you invite some friends over, have a few drinks, laugh & comment on the things you are seeing in this. I knew after seeing it I had to own it & its sequels.

5789360,5,B00DCLT8RA,"Set in the backdrop of galactic conflict, a young barmaid (who is possibly the victim of human trafficking) must overcome her simple moisture-farming background to learn from a ski-doo wizard, a kissing (Ian  Ziering) and awkwardly running (Tara Reid) brother sister combo, and a plucky robot combo consisting of a barfly and his bar-stool.  Early in the film you realize how vulnerable the California coast is to hurricanes.  The titular line of the film will be burnt into the Wernicke's region of the brain, not from overuse in the film, but in the series of verbal exchanges you will have to have to cognitively accept the masterpiece you are viewing.  This movie displays that when your house if flooding and filling with sharks the best solution is to run outside, get in your car, and drive away on the clear unsullied streets.  If only FEMA had access to this information during hurricane Katrina, the number of shark related incidents could have been reduced.

At the end of the film, the rebellion storms the death-nado in their X-Wing Fighters, and in a heroic use of the Force (a power that binds and connects all things in the universe) an unprotected thermal exhaust port is exploited as the week point.  Los Angeles is then covered with unemployed sharks... who will most likely end up mingling with unbelievable number of unemployed actors in this film.

After seeing this film and realizing how many sharks are in a standard tornado, I am now afraid to jump into my swimsuit, cover myself with SPF 70 (or above) sunscreen, and dive into the popular local tornado where everyone swims.  I question showing this film to children out of creating long term fear of swimming in non-man-made tornadoes and exposing them to quasi-Eastern religious philosophies that rely in telekinesis and violence.

Also... the soundtrack is something you are going to want on your Zune!  You can workout like you are running from a shark filled tornado and be confident that just by walking you are still beating Tara Reid to every mile marker!",1460851200,,2040,4.867052023121388

I'm surprised the actors didn't win all the Oscars possible for this movie. They were so scared by the sharknado that they didn't even focus on acting, but rather defeating it!

It has pretty low budget effects, the shark attacks look painfully fake, the acting is so-so, the actual science of Sharknado is completely unreasonable, and overall the movie was totally outrageous and terrible. YET I could not stop watching. It was so silly that it was amusing and I laughed most of the time because most of the scenes were ridiculous. So after watching all 3, I can say that I did enjoy it.

5789407,3,B00DCLT8RA,"Just finished watching ""Sharknado"" released by The Asylum Productions.
I was intrigued by the notion that this SYFY Channel original production has a strong cult following, and it's pretty easy to see why.
I love schlocky, B-movies; and ""Sharknado"" justifiably deserves its status as a ""Cult Classic.""
""Sharknado"" keeps the story simple and outrageous at the same time.  The movie opens aboard an illegal Mexican shark harvesting operation that is collecting shark fins for an criminal Japanese food company that wants cheap shark fins for pricey Shark Fin Soup - I kid you not here.  The boat gets caught in a hurricane, and as Captain Santiago and the un-named Japanese crime lord get in a gun battle over money and the shark fins, hurricane winds lift sharks out of the air and they take their revenge for their fallen shark brothers and sisters by eating the two villians.
Next stop, Los Angeles.  The hurricane, now a category five storm, which is blamed on global warming, is striking the beach and causing sharks to eat beach-goers who are stupid enough not to head the warnings of the lifeguards.
Concerned that the storm may threaten his estranged wife and family, bar owner Fin, along with a motley crew of a hot bar maid barmaid who has the hots for him, his Aussie best friend, and a drunken patron, grab what weapons they can since sharks are falling from the sky, and head for the van for a road trip.
Naturally, Fin's estranged wife and daughter are happy to see the survivors - Spoiler - somebody got eaten on the way to bitchy soon-to-be-ex's house.  Then a flash flood sends sharks crashing into a window and ops - spoiler - Fin's wife's snooty preppy boyfriend gets eaten by sharks in the house.
""I'm tired of these mother f***ing sharks in this mother f***ing house"" wait, wrong movie, wrong quote.
Barely escaping with their lives, Fin, his wife, daughter, hot bar maid, and his Aussie best friend pile into the mini-van and it's time to rehash Fin's failings - his wife hates it that he puts other people ahead of his family.  And to prove her point, a school bus of trapped children need rescuing.  Fin to the rescue!
The children are rescued, the school bus driver is too, but - spoiler - isn't long for this world.
Then it's off to rescue Fin's son from flight school.  Oh yeah, and they have to figure out a way to stop the Sharknados.  Thank goodness everybody is a skilled bomb maker!  [I kid you not.]
""Sharknado"" is so bad, that it's actually a good movie despite itself.
So as faithful readers of my reviews know, I do deduct points whenever a movie, book, or audio drama attempts to spread the Great Global Climate Change Hoax and/or Progressive Liberal Socialistic Propaganda.
A Great Popcorn Movie!

5789414,5,B00DCLT8RA,"This is an amazing movie with seriously great acting and special effects. All of the shark scenes were unique, highly realistic, and no shots were repeated throughout the movie. The science is incredibly accurate (both the biology and meteorology - why isn't the military just bombing all those massive storms doing damage all over the coast?! We could save so many lives!) and the movie has great continuity and flow. There was never a moment that left me wondering how we got there. Sharks can live for a reasonably long time out of water, so I found it quite plausible that they could survive being blown around by large waterspouts for extended periods of time (and really, that would piss me off too, it's no surprise they were mad). It was also really believable that the waitress who originally had a crush on the dad would end up with his son at the end of the movie, that happens all the time in real life. And of course, the mom forgets all about how her stuck up new boyfriend got eaten by a shark by the end of the movie; he should have stayed out of the living room, he was just asking to be eaten. Oh, and I loved the use of shotguns and chainsaws to fight off the sharks - all the characters had excellent aim. They really must visit the shooting range a lot.

The only drawback of this movie, in my opinion, was the lack of chondrichthyan diversity represented in the tornado. The movie really only showed white sharks and hammerheads, but neglected many other types of sharks, including dogfish, catsharks, thresher sharks, bonnetheads, carpet sharks, and gentle giants like the whale sharks and basking sharks. The little catsharks and carpet sharks never get any recognition. The poor batoids (stingrays, skates, and electric rays) and chimaeras (spotted ratfish, elephant fish) were never even mentioned! I propose that the next movie be titled ""Hurrichondrichthyan"" and feature all groups of cartilaginous fishes.",1444176000,14,1934,4.790419161676646

5789470,3,B00DCLT8RA,"What a wild combination of good actors and horrible graphics and scrip. With a name like Sharknado, you don't go into watching it thinking you're about to see an Academy Award wining film. Which is good, because at least then you're not disappointed.  Go into this thinking you're about to see a really bad movie and you'll be entertained with much of it.

To start they have some good actors in it. Not anyone who's on the A-list these days, but they were not so long ago. With several of them in leading rolls, it showed me something I'd never seen before in a film. Just how good some actors are. The movie is bad, but the actors are able to actually make something of it. Watching them in those rolls, it shows just how good they really are at what they do. How weird is it, but because of this film I have a better respect for just how talented some actors really are. The blood and gore is laughable, the shark special effects is painfully bad and the script is rough. But the actors still took what they had and made it fun to watch.

5 stars for the actors, 1 star for the film. Makes this a 3 star movie for me. Definitely a lot more fun to watch together in a group.",1437868800,,1176,4.1946902654867255

Living in a section of the country where tornados run rampant in the warmer months and having heard tales of the weird things they can do, it wasn't a stretch of the imagination to imagine sharks being sucked out of the ocean and dropped onto a city...especially in California where sometimes odd things happen anyway.

That said...sit back and enjoy the ridiculousness, as well as small kernel of truth in this epic, and thrill to the sight of dozens of shark dropping from the sky onto terrified surfers, tourists, and various other California inhabitants.

Some films are so bad they're good entertainment. This doesn't even qualify for it. Why the SyFy Channel commissioned the creation of this is beyond me. They've sunk to a new low. Science Fiction is SUPPOSED to be a fictional extension of a premise with a scientific basis as a starting point. This film violates nearly all the known laws of Physics (Analytical Mechanics and Fluid Mechanics in particular) and it has no remotely plausible meteorological basis whatsoever. If that weren't bad enough, the acting and dialog are positively abysmal with some of the cheesiest special effects in contemporary cinema. Even 1950's Grindhouse horror B-movies from the likes of William Castle did better than this. Only exceeded by Plan 9 from Outer Space in utterly failing every aspect of film making.

5789556,2,B00DCLT8RA,"A creature feature has no story, gorgeous but pointless characters, crude special affects and can't be taken seriously.  A survival movie has an unlikely story,  a variety of characters with personality and purpose, the special affects are good, and it can be taken seriously.

Fin Shepard is strong man, loving father, a business owner, and he knows the ocean well.  His interactions with his ex-wife, his adult son and teen daughter are realistic and believable.  Nova Clarke is quite beautiful, but she's also a shark attack survivor, and strong fighter.

When the sunami first hit it washed the sharks into the streets and into the sewers.  Sharks were forced into unnatural environments and quite agitate.  They'd attack anything in such a state.  Fin reaction was to head straight for his family.  Giving the audience numerous shark attacks and battles for survival.

Up until Fin reached his son this could easily be taken seriously, it was a survival movie up until that point.  Then it switched stiles.  Somehow a Tornado appeared in the middle of a sunami?  A Tornado that still functioned even when it swept up enough water to keep sharks alive?  Finally Fin's son used explosives to disrupt the Tornado?  None of that could be taken seriously, and the tornado affects sucked - both from the outside and inside.

I love survival movies and enjoy creature features.  This  movie tried to be both, and didn't succeed.  Sharknado is a failed attempt at melding the 2 stiles.",1428019200,,1482,4.923076923076923

5789673,4,B00DCLT8RA,"It took me about 30 minutes to realize that this movie was being intentionally illogical. Once I did come to that realization, it made the enjoyment factor go up dramatically. up until that point, I was just frustrated.

Sharknado is a movie about a tornade made out of sharks. It's as simple as that. A freak hurricane is hitting the coast of California, which has also pushed all the sharks inland toward the coast as well. The storm surge that crashes through puts most of the streets under water, and now sharks are literally swimming in the streets in huge numbers, devouring whoever they can. As if that's not bad enough, the hurricane begins to spawn huge tornadoes, which cause sharks to fly through the air as well. In the midst of this, a man tries to reuinite with his estranged family and see them to safety, while encountering other precarious and deadly situations along the way and proving himself to be quite the unintentional hero.

I don't know what to say. The movie is completely unique in just about every way. You'll love it or hate it. If you like quirky films with a lot of cheesy effects and tense situations, you'll probably love this. If you want your movies to make sense and behave within the realms of reason and logic, you'll hate it.

The reason it is illogical and irrational is simple: most of what happens makes no sense. Why doesn't the tornado kill the sharks that it lifts into the air? Why is everybody acting like it's a normal, typical day hanging out at the beach when a large hurricane looms on the horizon? why didn't everybody evacuate a day or two sooner? Why are all the shops open? Why doesn't anyone seem to understand what a hurricane is? Why is Ian Ziering literally the only person in the water that the first group of sharks doesn't attack? Why was he at the shoreline in one shot and back in the middle of the water the next, screaming ""Sharks! Sharks!"" but being completely ignored by the other peoples in the water, even as they are systematically being killed by sharks? Why doesn't he call his son to find out where he is BEFORE he goes scouring across Hollywood looking for him? Why is Tara Reid's house, which is on the side of a mountain no less and 6 miles from shore, suddenly flooded almost to the second floor even though the rest of her neighborhood and her own driveway are still dry? Why does the house subsequently explode? Why does nobody seem to know that there are sharks in the street when every television in the state seems to be tuned to a news station that is going over the fact that there are sharks in the streets? Why is it raining in some shots but not others, even though it's the same scene? Why? Why? Why?

Seriously. You could go insane with all the ""Why?"" questions, such as ""Why am I still watching this?"" Let me save you some time and say that I became pretty convinced about halfway through that the filmmakers were doing this on purpose. At least, I REALLY hope this was deliberate, otherwise I feel bad for them. Yet, throughout it all, the movie is fun and full of tense scenes and crazy shark-killing stunts. Watching Ian Ziering shoot sharks out of the sky with a handgun was pretty cool too.

So, there you have it. If you read this review, and you still want to watch the movie, you're probably going to love it. Like I did. Looking forward to Sharknado 2!!!",1413849600,,3355,4.4754901960784315

Everyone talks about how bad the acting was and how lame the special effects were.....but people just don't want to ADMIT that it was actually GOOD. YES.... SOME of the scenes and effects were cheesy... but some of it was really GOOD too. I see why it's gone down in SyFy history as a Cult Classic.

First, suspend disbelief or you'll spend the whole movie saying, 'That would never happen, blah blah...'  Second, just go with the flow - action packed!! Third, do not say the acting sucked. You try delivering some of those lines in a believable, character driven manner. It had to be difficult, most difficult.

The acting is pretty bad, no attempt at all made towards credibility (one man ALONE winched an entire busload of children from an underpass to the top of the bridge) or with continuity (wet hair and rain one minute, dry hair and no rain the next).  Cheesy special effects can be dealt with but this production is virtually brain dead.  Ed Wood lives.",1407110400,,395,4.549295774647887

It wasn't until the release of the 2nd one that I finally decided to break down and watch it with my brother and his girlfriend. We laughed our a***** so hard I had to give it 5 stars. You'll see things so stupid you won't believe your eyes.  I loved watching Tara Reids lazy acting she almost seemed angry and irritable that she even had to be there. It was hot! I totally developed a crush on her all over again!  I was sad to see they lost their way for Sharknado 2 and didn't have the same low budget bad acting charm but I'll never forget this movie.

5789857,4,B00DCLT8RA,"This is the latest entry in the canon of movies that are so awful that everybody has to see them.  It's completely preposterous from beginning to end, and a whole lot of fun.  The premise is that a monster storm off the southern California coast spawns tornadoes that suck up hundreds of large sharks and blow them all over LA (or is it San Diego?).  It's up to our surfer dude hero and his small band of buddies to save humanity, or that portion of it living in coastal southern Cal.  His equipment for this task includes various firearms and chainsaws, and an unhappy separation from his wife.

Here are a couple of examples of what makes this movie special. Don't read if you still plan to watch it and like surprises.

(Spoiler alert)  Said wife is living with a new boyfriend, a supercilious bastard who sneers at our hero.  So that sets up a conflict that has to be resolved through a long story arc, right?  Wrong.  A shark pops through an upstairs window and eats the bad guy.  End of conflict.

(Bigger spoiler alert)  The requisite attractive young woman on the action team falls out of a helicopter and is swallowed whole by a shark in mid-air.  Grief ensues, plus a lot more action.  As we reach the finale, the hero saves innocent bystanders by jumping headfirst into a shark that is attacking the crowd, holding a chainsaw (the hero, not the shark).  The shark is one of hundreds raining from the skies.  As the hero saws his way out of the shark's belly, he reaches back in and pulls out the unfortunate young woman it swallowed during the second act.  After an anxious moment, she coughs and recovers.

Sharknado 2 has now hit the theaters, to mostly ecstatic reviews.  Before you see it, if you truly hope to appreciate the subtle nuances of the story, you'd better watch the original product first.",1406851200,,1816,4.529230769230769

If ever a movie begged for review by the robots of Mystery Science Theater 3000, it was this one. Honestly, it isn't as bad as Manos: Hands of Fate, but its in the same general league. The most impressive thing about this movie is that the actors were able to do the entire thing with straight faces. I couldn't have done that, myself. The continuity issues, terrific plot inconsistencies, incredibly variable weather (second to second) and the amazingly inaccurate depiction of how sharks behave in the first place all add up to a movie so bad that youll wonder how they ever decided to greenlight it.

While most movies require some suspension of disbelief, this movie requires that your critical thinking ability be slipped a mickey and then beaten and robbed in a dark alley.

5789946,5,B00DCLT8RA,"Nothing can prepare you for the sheer magic of this movie! I love to watch it again and again and again! The acting in this movie is so serious-seriously goofy, that is. But what about plot? Fin, a champion surfer and bartender, starts off on the waves with a cute girl, when suddenly-SHARKS!!! And then, he gets news that there is a hurricane coming and he is concerned about his ex-wife and kids, and after a shark attack, he immediately gets him and his friends armed to 'defend themselves' and they go out to help Fin's ex-wife and kids, even though his ex-wife's boyfriend doesn't like him and is incredibly smug and even denies the existence of the sharks and even scoffs at the idea of the hurricane and sharks flooding the streets (he hasn't been watching the news, I guess) and at one point, that smug guy denies a shark in a swimming pool and goes to the window-and it is satisfying to see him get eaten! And then they escape to find Fin's son at the airfield where he is doing flight training-but not before helping people trapped on a bus in the water by propelling ropes over the bridge-and at one point, a clearly bad CGI shark actually eats its way up the rope to try to get to Fin! And then the Hollywood sign flies off and then the bus driver and Fin and his crew dodge them, and then the Bus Driver laughs and says, ""My mother told me Hollywood would kill me."" and at that moment, a Hollywood sign letter crushed him and kills him! How convenient is that?! And it gets crazier-suddenly, they see tornadoes-and in them are SHARKS!!! And then they go to the airfield while evading ever so helpful bureaucratic police with a rented truck with a nitro button (but apparently, in this movie, nitro doesn't destroy a car) and they find Fin's son and his friends and then it gets totally crazy! I mean, flying into a tornado and dropping firebombs into it from a helicopter?! That's so crazy an idea that it's just got to work! I mean, this is a Syfy movie we're talking about! And there is some serious carnage as people get eaten and destroy sharks as they rain down from the sky right and left-and they take refuge at an old folk's home (which, for some reason, is next to an airport-with the logic that old people can't hear-and everything is perfectly fine there as a TORNADO FILLED WITH SHARKS is bearing down on the airport! My favorite scene in this movie is when Fin pushed his daughter out of the way, starts up his chainsaw, flies into a shark (and is swallowed whole, which sharks in real life definitely do! All that is true because, hey, this is a Syfy movie) and he chainsaws his way out of the shark and conveniently, it is the same shark that ate one of the girls, Nova, earlier, as she was trying to stop the last tornado and was eaten! What are the odds of that?! I also love that when a shark slams down in the pavement, it leaves a perfect shark shaped hole! All in all, if you love Syfy movies with the craziest and most unbelievable plots ever devised, this is a great movie for you! I know it is for me!",1404345600,,3038,4.350352112676056

I should have known better with the title and I sure should have read the reviews. Whoever made this movie should be sterilized and placed in solitary confinement until they die.

I will say that the ending did surprise me. But what made it so good, was how bad it was.

Forget whatever you know about weather, sharks, and the Laws of Gravity - and others have said L.A., as well, never been there so I can't speak on the city - simply watch this movie for the bad CGI, stupid, yet hilarious one-liners, and revel in stupid comedy.

5790069,1,B00DCLT8RA,"Nature's fiercest creatures are killing people in a new way in this SyFy movie. A hurricane is the least of the worries for the citizens of Los Angeles. Sharks are swarming into the city through pipes and flooded areas of the city killing anyone in its path. However, A tornado starts to pick up sharks from the water creating not a tornado but a Sharknado! Enough Said!

Sharknado brings in a new creativity to movies. There are not many movies out there that have a tornado picking up a shark and throwing it to a different part of the city. The sharks don't even die when they hit the ground at full force, however I feel bad for the people around it. These sharks have one thing on their mind and that is killing.

It seemed like the movie was thrown together. One scene it would be sunny outside and the next scene it would be dark, gloomy, and raining. The movie never stayed consistent. There was even a part where the inside of the house flooded before the outside flooded. An EF5 tornado just tears off the roof instead of completely destroying the whole building. What sense does that make? It makes Sharknado sense!

If you are with a group of friends and looking a good laugh with horrible quality I recommend this movie. However, if you want better quality than B budget movie than this movie will be disappointing.

Ian Ziering and Tara Reid fit the first part of that bill, not the other. Then there's John Heard who CAN act but doesn't even try in this one, so why is he here? The rest of the acting is appropriately hopeless. One person gets bitten by a shark and all they can do is manage an 'Ow.' THAT makes you laugh. Not enough of those moments in Sharknado. 2 - A plot that gives us explanations we might possibly maybe believe a little, little bit. And why are the sharks attacking when they're not even in their element? You can even suspend the suspension of disbelief here. 3 - Terrible SFX that at least look as though the SFX team tried.

The script is woefully inadequate as was the deranged premise of freak storms (thank you Global Warming) that suck sharks out of the ocean then plops them down on the not so dry land, inside restaurants, the top of a moving vehicle, you name it.  Seriously, someone was paid for that!?

Jaason (I used to be a star on Baywatch) Simmons plays the obligatory sidekick.  He actually has a few good lines, as does John Heard who looks as if he can't believe he's actually doing a crappy movie like this.  Tara Reid plays an unpleasant ex-wife, unpleasantly.  The rest of the cast in inconsequential, most end up spare parts and leftovers for the multitude of sharks that go sailing by.  The best scene was the runaway Ferris wheel.

I'm almost ashamed to admit I liked this stupid movie.  Worse, I saw it on TV first then just had to buy it so I could watch it again!  I live for bad movies.

Go down the resume of Judd Apatow, Will Farrell, John C. Reilly, or even Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino and youll find purposefully dumb movies; 21st century attempts to capture the campy, slapstick, B-movie glory of Ed Wood, Roger Corman, et al. Those power players in Hollywood can make such movies with high production values, big name stars, and expensive CGI. Whether Sy-Fy can match their budget is uncertain, but what they do accomplish in this unbelievably bad movie is trumping all of those other efforts with a royal flush of bad movie awesomeness.

Its hard to say what was more fun; finding the copious continuity errors, reveling in the terrible acting/dialogue, laughing hysterically over the below-sea-level-budget special effects, or simply counting up the number of times you find yourself screaming WTF?!? One of my personal faves, beautiful in its simplicity, was the use of stock shark footage, clearly shot in the deep ocean (with remoras clinging on) that was used to represent the sharks swimming in the flooded 405 underpass. Whatever your personal high/lowlights are, this movie is an orgasm of stupidity.

Now unlike most people I would have seen, owned, and loved this regardless as I am a big fan of The Asylum. That of course is the production company that created this SyFy Channel classic. The title alone makes this a must see and I had a feeling it would be a hit for both parties involved. With a title like Sharkado I honestly don't know how anyone could have missed this one TV. I didn't miss it and then bought the Blu Ray/DVD combo as soon as it came out.

A hurricane is making its way up from Mexico towards Americas west coast and California could not care at all about what is going on. Los Angles is going on as t always does with girls on the beach, people drinking, and surfers doing what they do. That is until the storm lands and brings with it tornados, tornados filled with, sharks. Now with sharks attacking from water, land, and even air Fin and the gang must race to save family and get out of Cali, I don't think so.

This is one of the most fun films I have ever watched with laugh out moment after moment. There are so many ridiculous things that happen here that one most turn off the brain to truly enjoy this flick. If you don't I have a feeling you will not make it past the opening of the film let alone the entire thing. Pesky things like a shark attack at the beginning that sees people running from the water and others running towards it or in any direction just because. Of course that will be topped countless times like the airport being destroyed with everything getting lifted and thrown except of course for the people there and the helicopter right by them. If that would have been lifted and carried off like the planes then how could our heroes use it, makes perfect sense.

There are many more moments like that such as water flooding everything around them and it being gone in the next shot, same said shot by shot with rain and such. I will not point out the biggest ones in this because it is fun to find them yourselves.

This wonderful movie was written by Thunder Levin who as written or directed other flicks for the Asylum but this is his masterpiece. I really hope he is brought back to write the sequel, the man is a genius. We also need to give credit to director Anthony C. Ferrante who also directed Hansel & Gretel for the Asylum. Also he has produced Scream of the Banshee of After Dark Films and produced the first two films in the Scarecrow series Scarecrow and Scarecrow Slayer. He did an excellent job here as he did with the H & G flick he did.

Acting wise it is great with over the top performances and lines delivered like no others. All involved seem to be having fun with this as they should have. The best thing about this is the cast/crew commentary that comes as a special feature. They have a great time talking about the flick and the making of it, having just as much fun on the commentary as the flick. You also get behind the scenes stuff so with all that greatness plus the wonderfulness of the flick I have to give this five stars. Also you have to love those chainsaw moments.",1390435200,4,3066,4.295847750865052

Especially loved the dock and beach being sun-filled and tranquil one minute, then 30 seconds later all hell's breaking loose.  And the shark swimming in the foyer.  Oh, and fix the windshield wipers, dude.

5790241,3,B00DCLT8RA,"Viewed this movie already knowing it was ultra-cheesy, and got everything I expected plus worse: the tiresome lack of empathy that popular-oriented movies usually have in their depiction of sharks.  (The only exception I know of is ""Deep Blue Sea"", but even in that case not much of the sharks' side of the story is told, just a minimum view of the sharks' point of view.)  In well-made shark movies, it is banal to not reveal the sharks' viewpoint; and in B-movies such a failing is usually just plain grotesque.

Innocent sharks are finned, are sent to solid earth (dry land) via hurricane-tornado-combo, go on a rampage, are murdered by the humans who hate them (including a young woman, who calls herself ""Nova"", who just simply hates those aquatic animals).

Regarding the deaths of six adult humans on open water, including ""Nova""'s grandfather:  Nobody saw exactly how those six adults died, maybe they sank to the bottom of the sea (for other reasons than sharks, such as exhaustion, from treading the water longer than their bodies can sustain) and drowned -- but ""Nova"" has made the firm decision to blame the sharks, even though she saw nothing on the night of six adults' permanent disappearance (it was the dark of night, and she, an exhausted little child, seems to have been sleeping on the raft back then), including the disappearance (and probable death) of her (Nova's) own grandfather.  Yes, sharks do feed after dark, but there is no conclusive evidence that the sharks caused the deaths of six adults one fine night.  Also, her claim to have learned so much about sharks in the years following (she claims to have watched Shark Week) makes me wonder how she could learn so much and still hate so much -- is it selective listening on ""Nova""'s part, or is her claim to watch Shark Week a flat-out lie, or has Shark Week really become so unspeakably bad in the '90s and early 2000s that somebody such as Nova could watch it and not learn a single thing?  Or is it a combination in the case of ""Nova""?  A pathological shark-hater who claims to have watched real-life shows about sharks, and still wants to genocide them -- something is radically wrong right there.

Admittedly a shark bit ""Nova"" when she was rescued, but maybe that was (very easily) a very aggressive individual.

There are many problems about this movie (not just ""Nova""), and at least one reviewer (I suspect several reviewers) have suggested making a drinking game of this movie, such as take a swig for every error in this movie and you'll wind up thoroughly sauced or even experiencing severe alcohol poisoning.

Of course, the damage (to the public image of sharks) was already done when ""Jaws"" became a block-buster Spielberg movie based upon the novel by the author Peter Benchley.  Years later, novelist Benchley said that if only he had known about sharks then what he knew now, then he would have never written the book, ""Jaws"", and thus people would not have such hostile opinions about sharks.  But that was ""Jaws"", one of the better sharksploitation movies.  I doubt that a movie as honestly bad as this movie could be taken serriously the way some people actually took ""Jaws"" so seriously, which is very unfortunate right there!

Yet, this demonization of sharks is both tiresome and unfair; even B-movies can do better than that!  Please show the sharks' point or points of view.  You can still make an outlandishly cheesy movie, but one with some respect for wild animals in it.

I wonder if more attention could had been paid to those distressed sharks' point of view.  First, the movie opens with a scene off the coasts of Mexico in which a pair of psychopathically unscrupulous ""businessmen"" (an evidently Chinese black-marketeer with the very obvious **pseudonym** ""Palmer"", and an apparently/ostensibly ""Mexican"" fishing-boat captain named/pseusonymed ""Santiago"" but whose accent sounds a bit off, a bit too European, but he could be actually Mex), these two men, deal in black-market ""fishing"" and get in a quarrel over money.  A juicy dialog line is uttered by the captain that make it perfectly clear that he and his crew are much bigger monsters than all the wild animals in the world combined: he smiles a filthy smile and simply says that he and his crew don't fear sharks but instead sharks fear him and his crew.)  As the two black-marketeers exit the cabin of the boat and go topside, the storm has already begun.  As the two continue quarrelling over money, the possibly/ostensibly ""Mexican"" ship-captain shoots the Chinese black-market ""businessman""/""Mr Palmer"" in one of the knee-caps, obviously hoping to finish ""Palmer"" off --  but a shark (flying on the winds of the storm) goes and does the finish-off job instead, and then another shark appears and kills the ostensibly ""Mexican"" fellow.  Thus one very good scene ends, probably the best scene in the movie (in my opinion).

Those two evil men being killed by sharks, the scene off the shores of Mexico ends and a new scene begins -- on the shore of Los Angeles, in which some of the characters are already sensing that there is something not quite natural about the weather.  Good scene, albeit not as brilliant as the first one.

Remember Alfred Hitchcock's movie, ""The Birds""?  To some extent, ""Sharknado"" seems to borrow from it, specifically the theme of very upset animals lashing out against a corrupted human race.

I disagree strongly with the ""AGW"" (""Anthropogenic Global Warming"") and the ""ACC"" (""Anthropogenic Climate Change"") hypotheses, and do not appreciate that such hypotheses were mentioned in the movie, when much ~~more genuine~~ concerns of ecology and the relation of mankind to natural animals (such as sharks) could have been much better explored in a movie -- even a movie as bad as this.

(I also like the implied hypothesis that perhaps God was sending those sharks to land, along with the superstorm/hurricane-turned-tornado; it's a much better hypothesis than the conspiracy-hypothesis expressed by the liquor-store-clerk character in the movie.)

There are obviously many errors in the movie, not only continuity errors (as some other viewers have noted and are relatively common errors in B-movies, and often contribute to the screw-up charm of B-movies) but also errors about commonly known facts of the laws of physics and errors about shark physiology and errors about shark behavior -- and it was all cartoonish, although I like some of the cartoonish scenes (such as the one in which a shark is thrown on concrete, and wind-glides up again apparently unscathed by the crash land, having left a shark-shaped imprint on the concrete pavement; and a scene in which some sharks have landed atop the roofs of tall buildings, at least one of them obviously smack-center on a landing-pad meant for small planes, kinda cute because some airplanes actually have heads resembling the faces of some sharks).

(Physiological errors: Sharks being depicted as breathing air when actually they breathe water; sharks being slammed around on solid land with no evident ill effect when actually they are not designed to take any environment outside of water.  Those silly scenes were done on purpose, and probably contribute to the screw-ball charm of B-movies; demonizing sharks, on the other hand, does not contribute to B-movie charm.)

My biggest and truest beef with this movie is not with the continuity errors or with errors of physics or shark physiology, but that the movie is guilty of two (2) real failings:  (1) had the wrong people surviving the strange catastrophe (e.g., why did the sweet-hearted drunk, and the lady who had a dog, and the school-bus driver, and ""Fin""'s Tasmanian friend ""Baz"", all die -- while both ""Nova"" and the blonde haridan ex-wife of ""Fin"" to survive clear to the end?  (2) also, the movie failed to really explore how things were like from the sharks' point of view -- certainly the sharks have their side of the story!

(By the way, it was sweet how loving that lady was to her dog, and noble how the drunk risked his own life to save the lovable animal.)

Put yourself in the sharks' situation -- first you, as an entire group, are continuously hunted and tortured and mutilated and murdered by very evil men such as the seemingly/apparently ""Mexican"" ship-captain, and your kind are dying off, millions every year, due to creeps such as said captain himself murdering your kind -- every year since about 2000, millions of sharks have been tortured and killed for their fins, tortured and killed by greedy men, some of whom might also be psychopaths like the ship-captain himself, to feed the bellies of effete/decadent rich people who live in east Asia.  Then a big, evil superstorm pulls you and thousands or millions of others of your kind/species or similar/species kinds out of the water, whirl you around at dizzying speeds, superstorm touches land, transforms itself from a hurricane (sea superstorm) to a tornado (land superstorm), and flings you to a land inhabited by millions of upright-walking bipedal mammals (who are of the same species as the evil shark-hunting captain) -- some of those land-loving biped mammals (such as ""Nova"") being more willing to kill you or your fellow shark than look at you.  And it doesn't seem to end -- it goes on and on for many hours that ~~feel~~ more like days or years!  You, a typical shark in that situation, are angry, very upset, tired, thirsty, hungry, frightened, and battered, and you just don't know what to do, now that you are surrounded by all those bipedally-walking mammalian monsters.  But, instinct kicks in, not only for self-preservation, but also for preservation of your kind, and you instincively realize that the least you can do is bite and perhaps also eat every nearby human (name of those monsters) that you can, at least you'll go down fighting and you'll get a decent last meal while you're at it.

(Last meal?  Of course!  No self-respecting animal wishes to die with a hungry stomach as one of his/her final pains!)

Yet, Good Father Neptunus, Great Father Poseidon, you begin to realize that while the odds are clearly not in your favor (you are now on human-infested turf, and those beasts the humans definitely, at least by most appearances, have the home-team advantage) -- yet **somehow**, you and your fellow sharks seem to not be injured when being flung about in the air or flung to the hard ground, a possible sign that ""the gods"" are providing you opportunities to tell those vile beasts, the humans, that it is **NOT** okay to hunt or torture/mutilate/""fin"" or terrorize or kill or in-any-other-wise harm sharks.  You go down fighting, in the hopes that your sort can survive (perhaps also yourself as an individual), because either the universe or ""the gods"" have allowed it, so ye sharkies decide to use that somewhat miraculous opportunity to fight back.

Hopefully my little schpiel here illustrates the point of what they failed to emphasize in the movie ""Sharknado"", but they can probably rectify in ""Sharknado 2"":  the valid gripes that those poor animals, the sharks, must have towards most of the adult humans in that movie.

Dear movie-makers of the company called ""The Asylum"" or ""The Global Asylum"":  please show more empathy towards the sharks both in the sequel of this movie and in all other movies that use or/and involve sharks -- and it would also be nice if both the shark-hater who once named herself ""Nova"" and the blonde shrew played by Tara Reid both get killed and eaten by 70-foot-long Megalodons (prehistoric huge sharks) within the first ten minutes of that same sequel. ;-)

P.S. -- I watched this movie for free on Amazon Prime.  ""Sharknado"" was already publicly known as a cheesy movie when I finally watched it.  Why pay money for ""Sharknado"" when it is sometimes shown for free?  Sorry.",1389484800,,11841,4.890054972513743

5790309,4,B00DCLT8RA,"This is the cheesiest poorest made movie I ever saw that I actually enjoyed.  It is just stupid fun and made to be cheesy.  It is so terrible and lacked any type of motivation from the filmmakers and it shows.  The crew is escaping the storm and in certain scenes you'll find rain and other scenes it would be dry and sunny.  They didn't even try.  It's like they just cut and paste footage from wherever they could.  However, it is the cheese factor that makes this thing fun.

Spoilers:

You will laugh your arse off when the guy from show Beverly Hills 90210 goes to look for his son at the hangar and the whole crew is screaming his son's name, MATT!  MATT, WHERE ARE YOU?, and the son never responds.  He was hiding in a closet with a make shift door they were holding by hand to hide themselves.  How could they not hear anyone outside?

They shoot sharks out of the air that are caught in tornadoes with a pistol.

They throw propane ""bombs"" into tornadoes to stop them, and a girl falls off a helicopter, into a shark, in mid air.  THEN...at the end, the one guy rushes to save his daughter from a falling shark out of the sky, runs to her, pushes her out of the way, THEN hand cranks a chainsaw, dives head first INTO the shark.  He then proceeds to cut the shark open from inside, and lo and behold, it just so happens to be the shark that swallowed the girl 200 feet in the air.  He then pulls her out and they perform CPR on the girl.  Ridiculously funny.

It's so bad you have to watch it just so you can tell people about it.",1388534400,,1539,4.159322033898305

5790312,5,B00DCLT8RA,"A sleeper movie that snuck past the big screen, this movie has the staying power of an instant classic.  The film is a true fish out of water story, albeit with a new twist.  While it requires a healthy suspension of disbelief, the layers of highly crafted and intelligent plot intrigue will keep you riveted.  The dialogue is deep, with such lines as 'hey get off me' as the final words of a fallen comrade.  Or the subtle clues to the love triangle 'what's she doing here?'.  The cinematographer is able to actually challenge the laws of physics, as night becomes day within the same scene.

Like all great film, it makes us question our own place in the universe.  I would rank it somewhere in between Citizen Kane and Godfather II for pure artistry.  Watch it now.",1388534400,,768,4.5144927536231885

Truthfully I hope that my thesis paper grows light one this documentary and increases the publics knowledge of the rare hurricane storms that bring sharks to land, at first knowledge of this insider video I was with complete doubt as to how sharks could be brought onto land with a tornado/ hurricane system, however this educational film brought me up to speed on the potential risk of sharks being brought to land via storms and their potential hazard. I only wish this film was brought into the mainstream media and that there was no Obama administration coverup. Also if there was a follow up documentary on how to prevent further shark low pressure systems clashing with high pressure systems and scooping up that would be phenomenal. On the plus side when they saved that hard charger who was bleeding out with a tourniquet while talking to the perfectly calm victim I was found sidetracked and wanting to go back to school for medicine. Another thing is they should make another documentary on the celebrity from American pie. She is phenomenal. And what are the odds that a documentary film crew films her and the 90210 pube hair guy getting attacked by sharks! That is prefect timing and a disciplined film crew. Once again kudos to this documentary. The only possible battle this film would have had is with NBC's documentary which turned out to be a phony, The Office.",1388188800,,1467,4.756862745098039

1. The acting is beyond horrific, and not even in a parody kind of way. It's painful trying to watch them emote. The casting director could have used cardboard cutouts of actors in any one of their places and it would have been the same level of performance.
2. The CGI isn't even remotely realistic. Again, not even in a cheesy way. More of a ""why did you even bother?""
3. Half of the time there are serious issues with cutting from different shots -- there will be sharks swimming in the street which implies deep water, but then the camera will pan out and the characters are standing on dry pavement. That makes no sense.

I get that it's supposed to be a giant joke, and I truly find the premise to be a great one. What's not to love about sharks in a tornado? But this movie fell so flat of its mark. It had the potential to be so much better using different actors and better work on the graphics.",1388016000,2,1118,4.268867924528302

Despite its horrible special effects and talentless acting I found it absolutely hilarious. Apparently sharks become very hungry and aggressive after being scooped up out of the water and being tossed around through the air. In fact, they become so hungry they will chew right through the roof of your moving car in a foiled attempt to eat you. And who knew you could snuff out tornadoes with a bomb made from a disposable propane cylinder, a smoke alarm, and an emergency flare? Think of the lives that could be saved! Oh...and I am definitely installing one of those HUGE nitrous buttons in the center of my dash. Because we all know the bigger the button is, the faster you'll go!

I'm definitely watching this again purely for its comedic value. If you like cheesy movies this one will not disappoint. Next on my list: Sharktopus!",1387584000,,1240,4.662100456621005

We were laughing so hard, I actually had tears in my eyes.  The CGI is cheap, the continuity does not exist, the premise is ridiculous, and the acting is below bad.  And you know when anyone is going to be eaten, because the camera is on them for about 10 seconds straight while nothing happens until a shark eats them.  I heard this was a bad movie, so decided to watch a few minutes because its free with Prime.  I called the kids in to watch some and next thing you know we are having a ball.  A really, really, really, bad movie that is great to watch with someone and make fun of it.  Its rated ""NR"" but is safe for kids over 5.",1387584000,,799,4.109677419354838

I hate this stupid move. the acting and the cinematography is a joke. They best part about it is in a group of (hopefully not sober) adults, a game to see who can pick out the most errors. (acting doesn't count...too easy)

HOWEVER - my 3 boys love it. (age 7-15) although it is bloody, it is SO fake they even know it isn't real. For adults - keep 2 hours of your life and don't watch it unless you are drunk or in a dare.

5790422,5,B00DCLT8RA,"Now, I've been around the movie scene for a while. I've watched Mystery Science Theater. I've watched Plan 9 From Outer Space. I own the Blu Rays of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies. I consider Eight Legged Freaks a classic. So when I tell you this is the cheesiest film I have ever seen, that means not even Return of the Killer Tomatoes! or Beastmaster 2:Through the Portal of Time can compare.

It is very hard to tell if this movie is self-aware or not. It's a philosophical question really. Can you make a cheesier film by TRYING to be cheesy, or by having not idea you're in the middle of a Battle Royale With Cheese? Whatever the answer is (scientists and scholars are seeking the answers as you read). This film is not so bad it's watchable. It's not so bad it's good. It's not even so bad it's great. It is....SOOOOOOOOOOO BAAAAAAAAAAAD that it is totally, unarguably, and mind-shatteringly awesome. This film seems to hit every single mark in terms of clique characters, story-line, and monster movie tropes, and so badly that on first watching it's hard to say whether it's more hilarious or shocking, but most definitely shockingly hilarious and hilariously shocking.

Let's see...where do I begin?

We have an Australian character with the absolute worst accent in the history of the universe. Not the world. The universe. We have sharks...raining....from the sky. A CLEAR blue sky. Actually, the weather changes every time the camera angle does. We have absolutely nonsensical dialog quite often. Lines that are over-acted so badly you just are stunned beyond belief.

There are sharks swallowing people whole. There are sharks eating through vehicles (jumping out of the water no less!). There is a priceless scene where someone tries desperately to warn their family that they have to evacuate from their huge house because of the sharks! Followed immediately (SPOILER ALERT) by sharks flying through the gosh darn WINDOW! If you can manage to see any of this without howling with laughter you are a more stoic man/woman/child/person than I by far.

""I used to be afraid of heights, now I'm afraid of sharks!""

Okay, so we have horrific, awesomely cheesy CGI that looks like it was made 20 years ago. We have a team of somewhat likable protagonists giving arguably the worst performances of their lives. We have sharks leaping about like zombie-wight-dogs. Then we have a plot that defies all...humanity I think. Dropping bombs into tornados to save the day? Count me in! Then of course there are continuity errors as big as a house. My favorite is a sharknado inside of a warehouse followed by a camera-shot where a bunch of cheap, flimsy wall-hangings are seen completely undisturbed. And yeah, the weather that magically changes back and forth from tornadoes to clear skies is priceless.

I could go on and on about the teenager who starts whining and pouting at the most ridiculous moment possible, the sharks getting sliced by chainsaws like a hot knife through warm butter...but...really? If the title alone didn't grab you, if you don't love cheesy monster movies, if you haven't got a sense of humor...move along. Nothing to see here. If, on the other hand, you enjoy a GOOD bad movie...this might be your favorite movie of the year!",1387411200,,3263,4.8684684684684685

Of course the acting is terrible, of course the special effects are cheesy -- those are a given for bad, made-for-TV  movies. The problem is that while movies of this ilk usually make up for with some humor, often delivered via punchy one-liners, ""Sharknado"" is entirely devoid of anything that might elicit even a chuckle in the viewer. This is a flat-out bad movie.

Most of the time, bad movies happen by accident...They are generally the result of small budgets, crummy actors, ridiculous special effects and a poorly written, unrealistic script. Sharnado does all of this on purpose and while usually this would equal a train wreck, in this case it's a HILARIOUS train wreck and I was laughing the whole way through!

This is quite an unusual movie for many reasons. The name says it all and if you click on it expecting an Oscar winning film, you probably will hate it. If you enjoy laughing at terrible movies, you will LOVE this! It has everything worth making fun of in a bad movie. The mash-up of sharks and tornadoes is as silly as it sounds. Though it parodies many other movies, it does have it's own unique flavor too and I was totally entertained.

Many of the ""spoof"" movies try to hard to be funny and just end up being lame. Though this movie wasn't dumb by accident, the movie also didn't try too hard and it looked like the actors just had fun making it and that is cool. You don't see that very often in Hollywood!

I hope they make a ""Sharknado 2"" or maybe ""Crocnado"" or even ""Snakenado"" or some other crazy variation. Whatever scary predator you can think of, it probably would be scarier in a tornado! However you bite, slice, slash or chew it, this is a ridiculous concept and that is obvious but if you like ridiculous movies, this will not disappoint.

Is it a terrible movie?  Yes!  But its one redeeming feature--the thing that makes it enjoyable to watch--is that it is so ridiculously terrible one cannot help but want to see what crazy, impossible thing is going to happen next and to spot the glaring continuity errors.  (For instance, Los Angeles is in the midst of being hit by a hurricane and by tornadoes, and yet the sky is exceptionally clear and the pavement is dry in most camera shots.)  Ian Zierling manages to pull off his role pretty well, considering the material.  However, Tara Reid--looking considerably haggard--merely acts annoyed with Zierling (her ex-husband character) in every scene  and never seems particularly terrified by the bizarre events that unfold.

These actors today, with their advanced training---Man---they can make you believe anything---way much better than the old days of really bad slasher movies where people are terrorized in their cabin during a weekend jaunt. For almost an hour they had me convinced never to go to L.A. I mean, who wants to be sitting in a bar and suddenly a shark is hurled through the window and nearly kills your arse?

I knew I was being faked out when they escaped from that house with 3 foot of standing water (a shark was of course swimming around in the living room waiting to eat somebody). Come on Hollywood! I know homes are built better today, but they aren't sealed up like a swimming pool. You can do better than that can't you?

Global Warming/Climate Change nuts will love these character's solution of fighting storms. Just throw an explosive canister into an active tornado. It goes BAMM, and seconds later, NO TORNADO...it just peters out. You know, like they did in Star Trek when they destroyed the planet-eating Doomsday Machine with an ""old style atomic bomb""? Who knew? Why wasn't this used with the recent Manilla hurricane? It must only work on tornadoes I suppose.

I also didn't know that shark meat was so tough that even a chain saw will barely get through it. Jonah didn't have the advantage of gas-powered engines in his day, so I suppose that explains why the actor was able to get out in mere minutes vs. 3 days. One can learn a lot from watching movies.

5790524,1,B00DCLT8RA,"Sharknado (Anthony C. Ferrante, 2013)

When a friend of mine posted joyously on Facebook that Sharknado was available on Netflix Instant, I knew there was no chance I was going to be able to stop myself from watching the movie that seemed, from all I had read about it, to be the biggest cinematic cluster[censored for Amazon consumption] since The Room. At the time I thought this, I did not realize two very important points about the movie that I was apprised of less than two minutes into it. First, it stars Tara Reid, one of the most godawfully horrendous actors working in Hollywood today. (You thought Alone in the Dark was bad? Pray you are never forced to sit through Incubus.) Second, it was bankrolled and released by The Asylum. On the other hand, there is director Anthony C. Ferrante. When Ferrante brings his A game, he's capable of turning in decent-if-not-great movies (Boo, from 2005, is a good example), but when he phones it in, you get House of Bones. No one should ever get House of Bones. So which Ferrante was going to show up? Given the shadowy hand of The Asylum, I figured I knew the answer, but I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.

Silly me.

Plot: we open on a smugglers' ship, where the captain and a chap who is obviously supposed to be a Japanese buyer of shark fins are haggling over a catch. (I was confused here, since the captain starts off by handing the buyer what I assumed to be a cup of shark fin soup. Maybe I know too much, but that caused me to assume this guy was some sort of ship captain/superchef hybrid, since preparing shark fin soup is a ridiculously long and complex process.) The sole reason for this first scene, aside from padding the film's length, is to establish that there is a freak migration of twenty thousand sharks heading for the California coast at the same time a freak hurricane is heading for same. Cut to the beach, and former surf champion Fin Shepard (Beverly Hills, 90210's Ian Ziering), who now operates a beachside dive bar with assistant Nova (Bring It On: In It to Win It's Cassie Scerbo) and a cadre of regulars. Also, out on the water is Fin's surfing compadre Baz (The Devil's Tattoo's Jaason Simmons) and Deanna (Velcro Love Triangle's Sumiko Braun), who may or may not be having an affair. Baz, Deanna, and Fin are fooling around in the water when the sharks show up, leading to various casualties, deaths, etc. Fin and Baz head to the bar, collect Nova and George (Would You Rather's John Heard), and head for the hills to save Fin's estranged wife (Reid) and daughter (Nashville's Aubrey Peeples)...who don't believe they're in need of saving until a shark crashes through the window of their Beverly Hills (90210!) home.

All of which, I have to admit, makes it sound...kind of awesome. And really, Sharknado is the kind of movie that is so consistently terrible that, like The Room, it rolls full-circle into a kind of cheesy greatness. Ultimately, it did something that The Asylum have been craving for over a decade: one of their crappy DTV releases got so much attention that it appeared, however briefly, on the big screen. As a promotional stunt, sure, but it's an Asylum movie, and it played in theaters. When was the last time that happened? (I honestly do not know the answer to this question; it may be never.)

What's bad about it is painfully obvious from moment one, and it never gets better: this movie cannibalizes dozens of others, making no attempt to hide this. You've seen that scene with the ferris wheel breaking free and rolling down the pier, bearing down on fleeing people, before, for example (most memorably in Steven Spielberg's 1941). Most of the beach massacre was lifted right out of Alexandre Aja's recent Piranha remake. Etcetera. Add to this the incompetent acting from much of the cast, some questionable camera placement decisions, terrible soundtrack, etc., and, well, you've got a typical Asylum film.

What's good about it is a bit harder to quantify, aside from the always-affable John Heard. A movie can be unintentionally hilarious and still be so bad you never want to watch it again, as any of my fellow survivors of Birdemic: Shock and Terror will be more than happy to tell you. But for some reason Sharknado is so over-the-top stupid that it crosses the boundary into stupidly watchable. The final scene is so amazing I almost couldn't breathe for much of its length. The Bean, my two-year-old son, was watching with us, and he was in hysterics. Now every time he sees a stuffed toy shark, instead of saying shark!, he says big mess! Which aptly describes Sharknado. But I'm going to do something I can't recall ever doing more than once a year...I'm going to unreservedly recommend that you go track down this one-star piece of tripe and give it a good look-see. You may never want to sit through it again, but I don't think you'll regret the first time once you realize how much you're laughing. *",1385337600,6,4947,4.648

My kind of movie!

Taking place in Ellay, the town I was born in, I like how they mixed the tornados of the Midwest with sharks from the ocean. Why not? The preposterous plot cant be any worse than the other icky bug movies I watch. In fact, its just plain fun!

When the typhoon comes ashore at Santa Monica Pier, a favorite destination of ours, by the way, sharks rain down on everyone. The giant ferris wheel comes loose, of course, and chases people everywhere as sharks rain down.

Our heroes have to abandon their bar and of course, the bar owner is out to save his family (have to have some angst there) (his divorced and part-alienated family, of course). The stereotypes abound and there are no surprises whatsoever, but who cares? This is icky bug!

I, for one, didn't think Tara Reid did THAT bad of a job. I think she did far worse in the post production interviews where she couldn't even tell what a shark was, or whatever she was rambling about. Oh well, maybe she should stick to acting

Everything was totally predictable, but I didn't come into this movie looking for surprises, Shakespeare, or Oscar material. I came into it for mayhem and fun. The movie produced that in abundance, and pulled it off with a bit more credibility and panache than a lot of others.

Tara Reid plays a horrible B*tchy exwife and should go find a Target that is hiring.
I enjoy a stupid movie, but it needs some actors that can play it off and act realistic- no one is afraid, no one screams or crys for very long; very flighty- (your life long best friend just flys away in a sharknado and the next thing you think to do is escort elderly people into a retirement home and then sit inside watching out the window-not processing the loss of your friend or anything?)",1384905600,2,783,4.406896551724138

5790552,3,B00DCLT8RA,"I badly want to give ""Sharknado"" five stars. After all, its makers have deliberately created a ""bad"" film that works. It's idiotic from beginning to end, without falling into archness, or winking at the audience. It has two great verbal gags that work without killing the mood. (Hmmm...) And the direction is surprisingly brisk -- unlike most cheap films, there are few dead spots, and never /any/ lingering over the dumb stuff.

So why can't I give it five stars? Unlike ""Airplane!"", it doesn't hold up to a second viewing. What was hilarious on first viewing loses almost all its punch on the second. Regardless, ""Sharknado"" is a movie you /have/ to see. Its total disregard for logic, common sense, and the laws of physics has to be experienced.

The Blu-ray is handsome, probably transferred from the composite negative. (/Not/ making a release print is one way to save money.) PG-13 would be a reasonable rating, for extreme violence (silly as it is). There is no nudidity or ""adult"" language.

PS: ""Sharknado"" ought to be released to a theater or two, so its title song -- yes, ""Sharknado"" -- can be nominated for Best Song. If ""It's Tough Out There for a Pimp"" got nominated -- and won -- why not ""Sharknado""?",1384905600,,1216,4.726415094339623

- poor acting:  kind of emtionless saying ""oh my god"" isn't good acting I guess, and makes you laugh!
- poor lines:  sometimes the lines are so poorly written they don't even make sense.  I feel bad for the actors.
- nonsense:  how can sharks survive without water for so long (few hours at least) and still hunger for meat?  How can bombs dissipate tornadoes without getting the helicopter crashed?

There's the whole clichd dysfunctional relationship storyline which was forced into the movie, even when it didn't fit or work. All disaster movies have a dysfunctional relationship sub plot which gets resolved in the end. It's horrible and so boring...

Is not because of the bad acting, or the obvious CGI, or the bikini bodies running around, or that there are sharks flying out of tornados. There are certain obligations when you make a movie name Sharknado and that's what you expect when you sit down to watch this film.

Unfortunately I feel that's where the movie falls short, there just wasn't enough of it. The movie just isn't overt the top enough to be good. The main character is looking for his family and they spend a lot of time in the car going to and from different places and everyone's character was explored a little more. Why?? I mean if you are going to make an over the top movie like this,be over the top!!! Just throw in another few more exploiting sharks out of that tornado and get a couple of more bikini girls run from behind a dumpster holding a sawed off shotgun and a couple of hand granades, now we have a movie!

Yes they have sharks, tornados, explosions, a shotgun, a chainsaw and bikinis .... But just not enough of it!

I've enjoyed masterpieces like: ANACONDA, Piranha II ""The Spawning"", Crocodile, Killer Clowns from out of Space, class of 1984, and Night of the Lepus. I'm not stranger to offbeat movies, but Sharknado just doesn't hold up to the expectations and is mildly entertaining at best.

5790616,3,B00DCLT8RA,"I watched this as a curiousity. I'm not going to say the movie is stupid because, as so many positive reviewers have stated, I chose to watch a movie with this ridiculous premise. My issue is that it is an absolutely dreadful film, but I'm not convinced of the sincere motivations behind it that would be required to make it ""so bad it's good"". I think its greatest value would be for high school film students to see what a movie that's maybe 80% there looks like. The plot and continuity issues are so glaringly bad that it would be a great learning tool for them.

Having said all this I will admit to sticking with it until the quite gobsmacking end. The special effects were not so bad. Some of the acting was okay...the young dude who played the lead character's helicopter piloting son had an offbeat likeability about him. The 90210 references made me chuckle...a little bit.

I think the poster may been made before the movie.  The acting, we'll the lack of acting is what makes this movie a black comedy over thriller.  CGI is not good either.  The sharks are the star, but they were definitely on a very, very, tight budget.  There are scenes where there should have had sharks, but the ""actors"" use their ""skills"" to get through the scene.  It is a classic drive-in type movie.  Enjoy it for what it is:  1 hour 27 minutes of true escapism.  Again sooooo bad it's ok.  Yes, kind of fun to watch.

5790633,4,B00DCLT8RA,"""Enough Said!"" is all it says on the cover.  That about covers it...

The special effects, the plot, the writing, the acting - all horrible!  It was quite funny and the hits just kept coming.  Characters routinely did things with no apparent motivation and none none of the science added up.  I especially enjoyed the semi-plagiarism from Jaws - ""We're gonna need a bigger chopper"" - or ""6 people went into the water, 1 little girl came out, sharks took all the rest.""  Oh my goodness.

This movie ranks up there with ""Troll 2"" as so terrible that it is amazing.  Sharknado is an amazing combination of a bad zombie/apocalypse movie with a bad shark movie with just a terribly done movie.  I did enjoy certain characters' last lines such as, ""Oh crap!"" and then they get eaten by a flying/falling shark.

If you like to see people getting attacked by sharks in ankle-deep water, or sharks flying through the air and attacking people - and if you love great/cheesy one-liners and other outrageously unrealistic things - Sharknado is for you!

I laughed, I rolled my eyes, and I couldn't believe my eyes - time and time again!  Sharknado - a real twister of hilarious action-packed fake shark violence and acting so bad that you might even start rooting for the sharks to kill some of the bad actors!",1384300800,,1298,4.620087336244541

Even a keg of beer with your buddies can't make these films enjoyable. Then up pops Sharknado. This film CAN be made enjoyable with a keg yucking it up with your buddies.

The cinematic genius of this film is the sole intention to make it as ridiculous as possible. Spoiler alert! I love how the helicopter wasn't even the same helicopter in all of the shots - Director's like Who care's it has rotor's we'll use it and nobody will ever know the difference.

Seriously though - What a great love story - what a great reunion for Ian and Tara - A kiss rivaled only by that in Gone with the Wind. what a great triumphant film about the tenacity of nature and humanities ability to overcome.

It's almost biblical -  It's apocalyptic, He save's all the children, His faith is tested in the belly of a fish, There's a resurrection...

How this escaped an Oscar nod is beyond me - The bikini alone should have had a nomination for best supporting... that's it just best supporting.

The special effects were a work of pure genius and were incredible in High Def -

Always Remember - there is enormous power in a bar stool, and if you ever find yourself in an F5 tornado filled with sharks find the nearest piece of sheet metal and a small length of Sisal rope and you'll be just fine.

Would they make it alive?

I also have to say that, aside from the shark massacre, one of my other favorite parts was the song that played as the credits rolled.  It was spectacular.  The Ballad of Sharknado.  Gotta find that song and own it.  It's priceless.

Call me crazy but this movie did have me gripped quite a few times.  So much so that I didn't even notice the continuity issues many others have pointed  out.

Did I say it was silly? Yes it is.

It is in fact a rubbish film, yet somehow it manages to be more than the sum of its parts. In fairness that's not hard, the parts are all terrible. The story is silly and doesn't make any sense. The acting is terrible. The CG effects are really cheap and tacky.

What can you say about a movie that has sharks flying through the air on a tornado and plummeting down into city streets that have become flooded into rivers? Highway sharks, house sharks, airborne sharks, this movie has it all. A man gets swallowed by a shark and cuts his way out of the sharks stomach hours later. People are attached by sharks in their living room, in their cars and from above as sharks fall from the heavens.
 I rank it far above such classics as Croctopus and Piranahconda. It's better than  Donocroc vs Supergator.
Bad acting, ridiculous story, plot elements that leave you scratching your head wondering how anyone could imagine such stupidity.  This is so ridiculously bad that it's funny and fun to watch.

5790751,2,B00DCLT8RA,"I love cheesy movies like these.  Typically, the more implausible the better and the more obvious the special effects even better still.

The problem with this one is it really looked like most of the characters had NyQuil for breakfast.  They looked sleepy and depressed.  I guess they didn't realize how big this movie would become.  The only character that had any life to them was his son.  He was awake and alert and entertaining.  Everyone else just made me sleepy.

It wasn't just that there were moments of poor delivery on the lines, because that is also a requirement for movies like this.  The actors were either depressed about being in the movie or were taking it way too dramatic and yet not quite to the point of being over dramatic.

The long scenes where they are in the car are also very sleep inducing.  They don't even make it look like they are driving for much of it.  To save money on effects the windows are fogged over so you can't see out.  It makes me sleepy just thinking about it.

Filmmakers can save money and build tension by not showing you the sharks all the time but what they did here was do awkward zooms to show very limited amounts of the sharks so it was hard to tell what was going on.  The zooms also looked like they might have been done in editing as those shots where much grainier.

It certainly is no ""Raptor Island"" but it does have its entertaining moments.  Houses that flood from the inside in the storm.  Sharks that aren't just blown around in the tornado but must be swimming in it as they fall when shot.  When they are on an overpass with the roads below all flooded but then every so often they cut to a shot where you can see cars driving around down below in the distance.

5790759,5,B00DCLT8RA,"""Sharknado"" is epic. It is a monumental piece of filmmaking even for the braintrust over at SyFy and The Asylum. This is one of the most amazing in their series of laughably terrible nautically-themed movies about terror from the deep, and certainly one of the most creative. ""Sharknado"" forgoes the genetic mutations or radioactive upbringings of so many other aquatic nightmares, instead going for hundreds of airborne sharks brought into the sky by tornadoes over LA due to (what else?) global warming. I've actually lived in LA, and don't think that a rain of sharks from the sky would be the worst thing I'd seen there, but despite the laughable special effects this makes it look like a positively enjoyable afternoon (provided you own a chainsaw or electric hedge trimmer.)

It's clear that the entire premise is ludicrous, but where the screenplay and direction goes with the already lightheaded pretense of a plot is wonderful. I particularly enjoyed the use of helicopters and propane tanks as a last line of defense, but have to admit that by far my favorite scene was the aerial ballet of an airborne knife fight with a shark while dangling from the skid of a helicopter. No amount of description can do that justice, but if anything could top it, it would be the heroic struggle for survival that closes the movie out (which also teaches a very confusing lesson about intergenerational love...I think.) All I'll say is that the ending is an absolute classic for this genre, and by itself justifies suffering through...I mean sitting through...the movie.

My sincerest congratulations to SyFy and The Asylum: they have created a new low-water mark that dares future camp horror productions to touch it. If you want to see a good movie, don't watch ""Sharknado."" If you want to watch a movie that's so bad it's good (great, actually,) go get a copy right now!",1379635200,10,1869,4.8742138364779874

As in any Asylum disaster film, it is ""save the family"" first no matter how the world is ending. In this case Fin (Ian Ziering) leads a group of adults on a dangerous trek through the flooded streets of LA to locate and save his family, who  really don't like him or want to be saved. They must fight off sharks on every street corner armed with a shotgun, hedge clippers, tire jack, propane, baseball bat, sledge hammer, and my favorite weapon, the bar stool.

THE GIANT GILA MONSTER and in the recent past there appeared the delightful TREMORS.  The last ten years or so have produced a spate of movies, mostly made for the SYFY channel.  Some aren't too bad (MONGOLIAN DEATH WORM), some 'so bad they're good' (SHARKTOPUS and DINOCROC  and MEGAPIRANHA), and some are just bad.  SHARKNADO falls into the latter category.  You know the story:  waterspouts off Los Angeles suck up sharks which subsequently carpet-bomb the city, an intrepid bartender gathers up his estranged family to head for the hills.  It would spoil the 'suspense' if I told you more but here are a few points.

Okay ONE spoiler.  The waterspouts/tornadoes  are apparently sapient, only selecting sharks for the assault on humanity.  Nothing else.  No rays, skates, sea slugs or an errant blowfish.

You will need to have your hand on the 'next' button to skip the incredibly annoying Asylum trailers to get to the actual movie.

The usual banes of modern movies are abundant:  the tiresome color palette which tends to white, gray and steely blue; the de rigeur hand-held camera shots (the operators in this movie seem to have a bad form of palsy); the horrible sound engineering (you will be straining to hear the deathless dialog and then be blown out of your seat by an action sequence); terrible editing and on and on.

Thank goodness my friend and I killed a bottle of wine before watching this thing as there are no sympathetic characters (except the sharks), the Australian guy mumbles his lines, and the only tension arising  is trying to figure out why the bartender ever got together with the brain-dead and bitchy Tara Reid (didn't she used to have a career?).

But their famine was to be short lived.  Hurricane David was astir off the coast of Baja California moving north;  its waterspouts drawing this multitude of sharks up into their watery columns and the hurricane's strong storm surge impelling masses of swimming sharks towards the coast of southern California.  So imagine their pleasure upon discovering their surroundings were abundant with tasty, ready-to-eat, nearly defenseless humans!  For these sharks, it's ""Happy Days are Here Again!""  Unfortunately for the Angelenos. . . .

Overall:  This movie was obviously made just for kicks.  Don't worry about the continuity - note the skies and the ocean waves are ever changing.  And, of course, there are sharks everywhere, so you might suppose that all of the victims are eaten by sharks, but you would be wrong.  Unfortunately for a school bus driver, who originally came to California to be an actor, meets his dramatic end in quite a different way.  His last words were, ""My mom always told me that Hollywood would kill me!""  The manner of his death is a sight gag (no, I am not going to give it away.)

Not that that's a bad thing, mind you. The Asylum has been the crazy ex-girlfriend of bad movie fans for a few years now.

But with all the hype, I expected this one to be pushed to the extremes - more gore, more craziness, more ""Oh, no, you di-int!"" than any other The Asylum film I'd find at the Redbox.

Phooey. What I got was a better-than-average The Asylum film. It's no better than ""Two-Headed Shark Attack,"" but miles and miles and miles away from ""King of the Lost World (five bucks at Rite Aid, no ""regret"" refunds).

But it's no ""Nazis at the Center of the Earth,"" which is Asylumlicious. I wish those just discovering The Asylum through the pedestrian ""Sharknado"" would seek out those few, wonderful Asylumlicious films that excite those of us who haunt the Redbox, like ""Abraham Lincoln versus the Zombies,"" or ""100 Feet.""

Not that it needs, or deserves, a summary, but a freak California storm (and in a meteorological sense, ""freak"" means ""all you think you know about the natural world is wrong"") creates a tornado in California that's swarming with sharks.

Before that, Robbie Rist - Cousin Oliver from ""The Brady Bunch"" and my personal Facebook friend because he'll personally Facebook-friend anybody, including that Ben Franklin statue out front of your town's library, and who looks like that stoner friend of yours who thinks he's your best friend but doesn't know you secretly have no respect for him and plan to drop him as soon as you buy that house in Westport, Conn. - gets cut in half by a flying piece of corrugated steel. But you don't get to see any gore because The Asylum didn't think you were worth the expense. So you see a little blood spatter in a place where it would be physically impossible to be, but was easy for the CGI guy to render, and screw you anyway, says The Asylum.

I suspect The Asylum also did not expect its online social media campaign for ""Sharknado"" to be quite as successful as it was, and, in retrospect, is probably kicking itself for not spending that extra few bucks on acting talent and SFX that would have made it transcend its mediocre The Asylum peers.

Alas, hindsight is 20/20, and The Asylum is stuck with a really great publicity coup, leading to a movie that is just OK.

Rent those ""Just OK"" The Asylum movies at Redbox for what, a buck and a quarter? Invest your ten bucks buying ""Abraham Lincoln versus the Zombies,"" ""Nazis at the Center of the Earth"" and the amazing (for The Asylum) ""100 Feet."" Worthy additions to your DVD library, I assure you.

Logic, science, physics and the laws of nature have no place in this movie. It's intended to be a fun, funny movie while barely pretending to be semi-serious and scary. They managed to sneak in shout-outs to quite a few movies. I caught several Jaws references, of course, and even a Star Wars one, when Nova was in a helicopter approaching a killer tornado and says ""look at the size of that thing!"" And did you catch the reference when the no-name guy was killed by several sharks? What was he wearing? A RED shirt! HA! That's a Star Trek reference! No-names in red shirts always die in Star Trek.

The production of the movie won't fool you into thinking that they had a $100 million budget to work with, because they didn't, they had a tiny fraction of that, between $1 and $2 million. And I believe it was shot in only 18 days. Taking that into account, it looks great.

This is a movie to laugh at with friends and family. It's the type of movie where you will probably catch something new every time you watch it. And I understand they have already approved Sharknado II! I can't wait to see what they come up with for that one.",1378512000,,1330,4.337349397590361

When the sharks are shot they show holes like someone punched a pencil into a styrofoam shark then tossed some blood on it.

5790791,3,B00DCLT8RA,"SHARKNADO got so much wild attention that I couldn't wait for the DVD release. I expected to see some silly, campy film and actually SHARKNADO takes itself quite seriously and there is fun in that. No one can deny this is a silly movie with a totally implausible plot but there can be fun in mindless silliness.

Sharks are swarming in the ocean by Santa Monica, California. Suddenly surfers and swimmers are being attacked a la JAWS. Mayhem ensues on shore and sunbathers knock each other to get off the beach, but are they worried about land sharks? Aren't they safe on the beach? Well, soon land sharks and flying sharks become the norm for the day.

Global warming has created some unusual weather in the Los Angeles area and soon tornados eminating from the oceam are coming ashore. As the tornados form they are scooping up bloodthirsty sharks to be deposited on land. SHARKNADO follows the plot of many movies. Usually the world is threatened by attacking aliens or zombies. This time it's the sharks causing havoc. The tornados move far inland into ""The Valley"". No one is safe from the sharks or the destruction of the tornados. Despite the ominous news reports, many people in The Valley seem oblivious to any danger from tornados or sharks. Making matters worse these sharks are particularly hungry. One might suppose they would be too confused to be attacking everyone in sight but that is what they do and they have amazing stamina outside of the water. Sharks drop from the air or pop up through drain pipes. Hey, don't look out your window. A shark might just fly through.

The story is taken so seriously that there can be fun in the mayhem. Sharks are even attacking helicopters in flight. It literally is raining sharks by the thousands. Our heroes will save the day. All it takes are some hearty chainsaws or a rifle to shot those sharks in mid-air. But it is the chainsaws that will save the day in the end. You have to see it to believe it and you never know who you will find in the next shark.

Tara Reid has never looked lovelier so she adds the sex appeal to the film. Ian Ziering is the bar owner out to save his family from sharks in ""The Valley.""  Will they save Los Angeles from the invasion of the flying sharks?
SHARKNADO has become a cult classic and if you realize this is a silly movie not to be taken seriously, you can appreciate the fun in the mindless story. Silly can be fun.",1378339200,5,2414,4.502283105022831

The entire premise of the movie is stupid. The acting is stilted. The script is riddled with plot holes and continuity errors. Gravity took a holiday while they were filming. For example, the entire downstairs of the house is flooded, and yet when they open the front door, hardly any water comes out. And then the shark and a lot of water crash through the window on the same floor as the door they just exited.

This review is from: Sharknado (DVD)
I may have to hang my head in shame for this one, but I actually sort of liked SHARKNADO. I think it depends on how your head is going into it; me, I KNOW that any SyFy Channel movie is going to have really bad special effects ... and probably a plot originally written down on some cocktail napkin in a bar during happy hour. Therefore, I wasn't expecting much beyond dumb, mindless entertainment - and on that level, this film works in such a preposterously stupid way, you can't HELP but be entertained! Ian Ziering stars as Fin (yeah, I know - get over it), an L.A.-area coastal bar owner whose business is threatened when devastating hurricanes shake up the west coast. He rushes with his friends and employees to escape the onslaught as the storms move onshore ... then into the valley to rescue his ex-wife (Tara Reid) and daughter ... from a whole bunch of vicious sharks who, as the tornadoes moved in from the ocean, were swept up into the funnels and are now being let loose all over the So-Cal coastline. That's the plot, and mayhem, blood, and crazy-ass improbabilities ensue - but again, not without being oddly entertaining (in that, ""You have to be KIDDING ME!"" sort of way) until the ludicrous ending. Again, rent your brain out for a couple of hours and you might find this absurdly fun; try to engage it, while watching this, and you're probably doomed.",1378080000,2,1513,4.586715867158672

5790797,2,B00DCLT8RA,"There may be spoilers.

I feel a little guilty giving this movie two stars.  In actuality it is one of the worst, dumbest movies ever made.  However, I think that is much of the point of these offbeat movies made for the SyFy Network.  You could easily make an argument that for investment purposes, this may be one of the best movies ever.  Made for $1 million, it's a big hit.  So here's the deal.

Fin Shepard (Ian Ziering) is a former surfing champ who now owns a bar on the beach near L. A.  As a hurricane brews off the Mexican coast, strong winds move up the California shoreline.  Water spouts begin to appear at the same time as a large school of sharks.  Before you know it, the large water spouts pick up the sharks and start depositing them inland.  At the same time the tropical storm is flooding everything.  This give the re-deposited sharks access to the storm drains as well as an occasional swimming pool.

Fin along with an Australian surfing buddy Baz (Jaason Simmons), George (John Heard), the local drunk and a hot employee named Nova (Cassie Scerbo) head for the hills (literally) to look in on Fin's ex-wife, April (a stone faced Tara Reid), his teenage daughter, Claudia (Aubrey Peeples) and college aged son, Matt (Chuck Hittinger).  Well Matt's away at flight school or something, April and Claudia insist they don't need help.  That is until a flying shark eats April's new boyfriend.

So most of the movie has sharks appearing from everywhere eating everything and everyone in their path.  Fin and company concoct a plan to have flyboy Matt and Nova take a helicopter up into the now 3 tornados and toss in an improvised bomb which will defuse the tornado and kill the sharks contained therein.  And guess what?  It works.  One casualty is Nova when she is taken off guard and swallowed by a flying great white shark.

Although for most of the movie, I thought Nova was going to be Fin's girlfriend, it turns out she's better suited for son Matt.  That way Fin can reunite with April.  But wait, Nova was swallowed by the great white.  No matter.  Fin armed with a chain saw, manages to find the same fish and dive in head first, cutting his way out from the inside and saving Nova for Matt.  I have to admit to laughing out loud for much of the film.  I was especially caught up in several lines uttered that came verbatim from ""Jaws.""  Like I said, this may be the worst or best movie ever.",1377648000,2,2421,4.478260869565218
5790798,1,B00DCLT8RA,"I love b-movies, from good ones to bad ones that are so bad they're fun. Don't believe the hype, Sharknado has zero redeeming qualities. The problem is that the filmmakers responsible (Asylum) were TRYING to make a bad movie. Asylum doesn't need to try, everything they make is pure crap, and not in a good way. Let me remind you, I LOVE bad b-movies. Maybe one day Asylum will get it right but I seriously doubt it. Why SyFy continues to air their movies is beyond me. They successfully generated enough hype to get mainstream attention for Sharknado but If you're looking for a b-movie that will stand the test of time Sharknado is not it.",1377388800,2,641,4.5344827586206895

5790800,3,B00DCLT8RA,"You wanted it, shlock fans, and you got it, in spades, courtesy of the SyFy Channel.

The movie was made to be cheesy, but even when you know that going in, get ready for your expectations to be surpassed -- the amount of cheese in this movie will astound and amaze.

A hurricane is heading to Los Angeles while Southern California beaches are experiencing a strangely high infestation of sharks. Early in the plot, screenwriter Thunder Levin and director Anthony C. Ferrante let you know that sharks can fly -- that is, assuming they're lifted out of the ocean en masse by a water spout. Hmmm, hurricanes often spawn tornadoes and water spouts. There you have it -- the necessary recipe for a sharknado!

The story develops as more and more sharks begin falling out of the sky as the hurricane moves closer to L.A. ... gradually, at first, but then with increasing frequency. And that's before the sharknadoes have even arrived! Yikes!

Protagonist and former surfing champion Fin Shepard -- get it? -- (Ian Ziering) risks life and limb on a quest to save his two teenaged kids and his ex-wife, April (Tara Reid), from the storm and then from the deadly jaws of all the thousands of sharks that are menacing L.A. by way of swimming inland during all the flooding or by raining out of the sky, thanks to the hurricane. Luckily for our story, Fin is irresistibly compelled to help anyone else he encounters along the way who is about to become shark food.

In the end, our weary band of heroes and heroines get a great idea about how to save the entire city from the three deadly and massive sharknadoes that finally arrive on shore. I won't spoil it for you, but rest assured that explosives and a chain saw are involved.

The movie relies mostly on gruesome visuals using computer generated sharks that are constantly chomping, biting, and eating people, even when they would normally be much more concerned about how to breathe out of water than with having a snack. The final few minutes are classic. When you see what Fin does with that chain saw, you'll know what I mean.

This is one of those flicks that plays to your sense of silliness and shlockiness while telling a disaster-movie tale that could only happen on TV or on the silver screen. If you dig that sort of thing, you'll love Sharknado. If not, keep moving; nothing to see here.

Enough said.",1376179200,5,2359,4.6
5790801,5,B00DCLT8RA,"Well, for anyone who thinks this movie is getting 4-5 stars because of it's state-of-the-art graphics, quality acting, clever dialogue or explanation of shark behavior and basic physics, you clearly have no conception of sarcasm, and I suggest you go and fix that before even allowing yourself to look at the promotion poster.

But in all honesty, this needed to happen. This movie needs to exist. And you need to watch it. There is a reason it is a cult-movie. And you want to be a part of it.

It is so, so horrendously terrible. The first 5 minutes of the movie, I thought the whole thing was supposed to be serious. But by the first appearance of a single shark, you know the whole thing is intended to be as awful and unrealistic as it is, and that is why it is so wonderful. I sat there and watched the whole thing just to see how much corny, cheesy, slutty, punny content they could squeeze into it. And I was not disappointed. For anyone with a slap-stick or dark sense of humor, you will believe this to be a work of art. For those who take their cinema too seriously, you will hate it and everyone that willingly watches it. And for everyone else, this is the perfect background noise while playing Monopoly and getting drunk in your living room. It's an experience every human being should have.

5790803,5,B00DCLT8RA,"Sharknado is one of the worst movies I have ever seen regarding plot structure, integrity of suspense, and characterization, but my fifteen year old and I LOVED it.  My wife, who was pretending to ignore us and our questionable taste in movies, even laughed a few times.  Sharknado is just so bad it's great.  Can't wait for the sequel.

This SyFy Channel original movie conceit that is at the core of the action is that sharks - ALL kinds of sharks, mind you - have gotten swept up in a monstrous hurricane (Sharkicane obviously doesn't sound as cool as Sharknado) and drop onto the unsuspecting populace of Los Angeles.  Now, to accept that, you have to check all knowledge of meteorology at the door and ignore California's history.  One, it would be classified as a hurricane coming in off the ocean, and two, there have never been any hurricanes that hit California.  They call it the ""Pacific"" Ocean because it's so calm - except for those tsunamis that hit Japan, India, etc.  But that's on the other side of the ocean.

The collection of characters is the usual ensemble.  The divorced father who has to go rescue his kids, who are rebellious snot rags in the beginning but become massively talented at battle sharks before the end of the movie.  Then there's the best friend who gives his life fighting for our hero.  The young girl who's maybe in love with our hero even though he's twenty years older.  One of my favorite characters was John Heard, a millionaire drunk who carries his bar stool with him to fight the sharks with - until he meets his glorious demise.

Of course, one of these movies just wouldn't be complete without obligatory other rescues that get in the way of the hero getting to his kids.  The school bus rescue would have taken WAAAY too much time, and you can't help but notice that there isn't any rain or aerial-borne water sluicing over our champions.

In fact, the whole movie gets way too dry at times.  I kept noticing those things, how it went from water running white caps in the street, yet there wasn't a cloud in the sky so often.  My son and I kept pointing that out to each other, and I can see that maybe becoming part of a college drinking game - do a shot every time the weather changes.

Despite its many, MANY flaws, my son and I (and my wife to a degree), enjoyed Sharknado.  It's not art, it's not even a decent story, but it is a much-needed exercise in total hilarity - even if it isn't supposed to be.",1375920000,8,2459,4.458612975391499

In any case, Sharknado has to be one of the best movies ever. The protagonists do spend a lot of time driving around, but it is Los Angeles after all. The ending is just terrific, of biblical inspiration, but you will have to see it for yourself.

5790809,5,B00DCLT8RA,"It started with Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus, continued with Sharktopus, but now, at last, The Asylum film company has perfected their shark-disaster movie formula.

Sharknado is the ultimate Z-movie film.  The production values couldn't be worse.  The concept of water funnels picking up sharks (and only sharks by the way) and dropping them into Los Angeles couldn't be more absurd.  And the acting, while played totally straight by those involved, is about as melodramatic as acting gets.  It's also one of, if not the most, compulsively watchable and entertaining movies the Syfy channel has ever produced.  I won't waste your time recounting the plot.  Whether the protagonist Fin is able to reconnect with his children is not the reason you watch this movie. The plot is just an excuse for set-piece moments involving sharks, shotguns, and all manner of endearingly bad computer generated effects.

Arguably, what allows the movie to rise above a series of set pieces though, are the characters.  They're not well developed or anything (Jaws this isn't) but the way everything is set up, there are characters you root for and ones you want to see die, and the movie is so cavalier about killing off people from both of those groups, that you can't help being sucked in.  A lesser movie would end on some big climactic shark fight that would determine the fate of the world (and we do get one of those) but Sharknado's final set-piece is infinitely more satisfying because of how it involves characters we like and don't want to see die.  If that sounds vague to you, it's because I wouldn't dream of giving away how Sharknado ends.  It's a moment that'll cause everyone in the room to cheer.

Speaking of which, do watch this film with other people.  It's a fine film on it's own, but it's begging to get the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment.  Your comments, and the comments of the other people watching, enhance the experience.  In fact, I'd wager that the catharsis of laughing with this film is why it became the twitter sensation that it did.

5790816,5,B00DCLT8RA,My son and i love syfy cheesy movies. This was worlds better than some high budget disaster movies. I truly love sharks so the beginning did break my heart. That being said it was a really terrific movie. It is made for people that enjoy a good laugh and completely over the top thrill. It is hard to describe how wonderfully bad this movie is and how much i love that about it. Syfy has so many great cheesy movies. looking forward to the next.,1374192000,5,445,4.247058823529412
5790817,3,B00DCLT8RA,"Back in the 90s, we had entitled-20-somethings-playing-entitled-teen somethings, running around in LA -- in particular, Beverly Hills -- that pumped out bad TV with eye-rolling acting, plot, and direction.  Now we have entitled-40-somethings-playing-entitled-30 somethings, running around in LA that pump out worse TV with more eye rolling acting, plot and direction.  Guess things really haven't much changed over the past 20 years.

I watched this last night (2013July18) which I believe was the ""encore"" viewing of this disaster-of-a movie, and I'm assuming that it didn't change between the first playing and the second on the Sci Fi network.  You'd think that the people that financially backed this ""film"" would have taken the time to do a rewrite and a reshoot in between those two times.  Guess they liked it enough the first time to keep it as it was, and even play it again!  Yeah!  We all win!

Ian Ziering gives another average-at-best performance at playing a divorced-daddy-who-wants-his-kids-back-but-for-the-life-of-me-wanted-his-ex-wife-back dude; Tara Reid gives another average-at-best performance playing a divorced-mommy-who-has-two-suitors-but-shouldn't-even-have-one gal; John Heard gives an average-at-best performance playing the has-been-drunk-guy-falling-off-his-chair dude; etc. etc.  I guess you get the picture.  Too bad I didn't.

But anyways, I've got lots of questions, but here's one for ya':  Lets say that it's possible for sharks to get sucked into a tornado.  Now, if a shark is doing it's death spiral, circling around in that tornado, and you could shoot that shark (assuming that it would be possible to shoot a shark that was spinning that fast), then why would that shark suddenly fall to the ground?  Wouldn't the centripetal effect of the tornado be greater than the force of a tiny bullet?  (BTW:  ""Centripetal force"" doesn't really exist, for you physics fans out there, and especially for those of you who haven't taken any physics.)

I could ask a lot more questions, but I'll leave you with the last one:  why the hell did I turn this on?  I guess you'll have no chance of answering that since I have no answer myself.

(Quick reason why this film is a pass for me:  they needed to go MORE campy, in my opinion, here.  I really liked ""Pirahna"" since they went that direction.  How about the following:  Make ""Sharknado 2"" and include Arnold Schwarzenegger?  Now that might be entertaining.)",1374192000,5,2440,5.308093994778068

5790819,4,B00DCLT8RA,"Due to a friend's glowing recommendation for the cinematic gem that is Sharknado I dared to turn it on. I was going to take a shot every time someone got eaten by a shark but after the first few minutes I realized I would get alcohol poisoning fairly quickly. Since I'm rather reluctant to be on the receiving end of a stomach pump I decided to do the next best thing, yell at the screen. Why these people can't just run away from the sharks when they hit the land is beyond my Associate's degree education, and why they didn't run diagonally during that runaway Ferris Wheel scene brings me back to the scene with Charlize Theron in Promethius. WTF!

Okay it is just a movie, a bad movie, but it is meant to be bad right? Of course it is, it is on SyFy, cheese is to be expected but the title Sharknado had me thinking forty minutes in the movie...WHERE THE HELL IS THE SHARKNADO? It was more like a Sharkphoon. Though they kept referring to the storm as a hurricane I thought when they are on the Pacific Ocean they are called typhoons. I guess a little fact checking was not in the budget.

How the heck that lady who's house was on the hill get so flooded and her driveway is bone dry? What kind of water pressure causes a house that size to blow up? Her neighbor three feet away is fine. She must had her house made with paper-maiche and the sweat of Home Depot day laborers.

The acting...oh the acting! I've seen better performances on herpes commercials but they are acting bad on purpose right? No wait here is Tara Reid and a little birdie is telling me that she isn't acting. I think she thinks the Sharkphoon is real. They just dropped her off there among the other actors and filmed what was essentially for her the longest and largest episode of Punk'd ever created. At the end I think she was looking around for Aston Kutcher to jump out from somewhere but he was to busy making sure his own inability to act cancels Two and a Half Men so he couldn't be there that day. Yes that day because I am positive this film was shot and canned before craft services carted out lunch.

Why does the bus driver look like a police sketch of a person you would never let your child be alone with. He looks like the suspect on an Amber Alert.

Wait...an hour in and I think the Sharknado is here. No they are water spouts with sharks. If one could only eat Tara and the main character whose only job was to look as dirty and greasy as possible while being constantly bombarded by rain and floods.

PEPPER JACK!

Why are the police trying to pull over a traffic violation during a Sharknado? I need an expert to weigh in on this. Police caring about red light runners during a shark typhoon? Somehow I think I already know the answer.

Wait is greasy guy arm wrestling with the Sharnado? Yes. Yes he is! Why is he the only one holding the door to keep the tornado out? There is like nine people in that closet. No one? Moving on...

They now have regrouped and made a plan. The logic behind throwing a bomb in a tornado to equalize it should be researched by the National Weather Service. We have a surplus of bombs here in the U.S. and a place called Tornado Alley. Call the Mythbusters, I'm sure they will pounce on the chance to blow some shit up. Wait...did this man just split up from the group to prepare a Plan B? Throwing homemade bombs (dynamite taped to propane tanks and small flame torch fuel canisters) was your Plan A? And how does shooting a rouge flying shark in a tornado make it fall to the ground? Apparently killing a shark releases a form of magic that can then defy all scientific principles. My questions pause to see greasy man fight a flying shark with a chainsaw. Was that his Plan B? I guess the homemade bombs in the twister is a far better Plan A.

Now for the finale greasy guy is a chainsaw surgeon, performing a Caesarean section from the inside of a shark to save himself after being swallowed whole and coincidentally saving the other chick who was swallowed whole ten minutes earlier. Add a few gross gore-covered make-out sessions...AND SCENE! Is Sharknado a great movie? No. Was it entertaining? HELL YES!

8591875,2,B00DCLT8RA,"*SPOILERS*  I think this might've been campy fun, or at least less predictable, if it had stuck with the initial charm of the lovable washed up bar flies driving through the  ""Sharknado"" apocalypse. I really was enjoying this movie for what it was at this point. Instead we get diverted as star Ian Ziering (who initially makes it seem like the trashy, but good hearted fun of the original 90210) goes to pick up his incredibly irritating and badly acted family, and their whiny McMansion after school special problems. An amusing appearance by the late, and underrated John Heard as a dedicated, lecherous barfly/old surfer, who dozes through the escape and thinks he is dreaming, is unfortunately cut short for, among other things, Tara Reid as the ex wife, who weakly recites her needlessly brittle lines, eyes glazed, as if she is sleep walking. Worse are the children: the messy haired, heavily made up daughter literally stalls their escape efforts to jealously pout and make everything about her. Honestly. And the overly confident son, who since he is away at pilot school, gets the brilliant idea to deal with the sharknado by bombing L.A. (They happen to have bombs at flight school, ready to drop on Angelenos for some reason. How this might stop the tornado part of the problem isn't explained. LOL)  They kill off a likable Tasmanian character, who actually seems manly and tough, for this arrogant kid.  Now this deserves a MST3K or Rifftrax commentary.

And just my pet peeve: I hate unrealistic movies that don't have the guts not to have a perfect happy ending. If things are just going to work out anyway, where is the suspense? No problem with camp, but this movie ends with two of the main characters being cut out and escaping bloody from a shark after being swallowed. Groan.  Think I'll skip the sequels.",1516233600,,1827,4.802547770700637

8591877,1,B00DCLT8RA,"I began this movie expecting a countless number of sharknados. Much to my chagrin, there are only three. Instead, the movie primarily features the fragmented domestic life of a washed-up surfer and a handful of boring ass white characters. I was expecting this movie to be from the perspective of a shark. Additionally, it was my belief that Tara Reid was to play one of the sharks. Boy, was I wrong. Imagine my shock, when all the sharks were played by computers. Tara Reid just played the wife of the washed-up surfer.

0/10. Would not recommend. Needed more sharknados, fewer domestic affairs, at least one person of color, and Tara Reid playing anything but a human.

Liked the Sharknado theme song at the credits though.",1513468800,,725,4.792
8591878,3,B00DCLT8RA,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2013 and directed by Anthony C. Ferrante, Sharknado chronicles events in the Los Angeles area when a freak hurricane hits and thousands of sharks threaten the waterlogged populace.

I stayed away from this movie for over four years before finally viewing it today. Why? Because, although I like low-budget creature features now-and-then, the very name Sharknado just made me roll my eyes. But I finally caved because of surprising hysteria, which led to (currently) four sequels.

I was surprised to see that Sharknado shoots for a quasi-serious tone and mixes it with occasional camp (e.g. the opening fishing boat sequence with the captain and Asian man), fun cameos (e.g. Paul Williams) and absurdly over-the-top moments (especially the Yeah, right ending). But, most of the time, the vibe is surprisingly realistic in a fantasy context. Of course you have the typical cartoonish CGI for which movies that debut on Syfy are known. On top of all this is a likable cast, a dynamic pace with consistent thrills/laughs, a rockin soundtrack and quality score.

Speaking of the cast, Ian Ziering plays the macho male protagonist, Fin, and Cassandra Scerbo his jaw-dropping female counterpart, Nova. Tara Reid appears as his ex with Aubrey Peeples and Charles Hittinger as his kids. John Heard plays a good-humored patron at Fins coastal pub. For me, Cassandra is the real highlight; she shines throughout.

Bottom line: The flicks generally entertaining in a thrilling, fun cant-take-it-very-serious way, but there are superior movies that have debuted on Syfy. Wyvern (2009), Roadkill (2011), Sasquatch Mountain (2006), Jersey Shore Shark Attack (2012), Sasquatch Hunters (2005) and Flu Bird Horror (2008) all come to mind.

THE MOVIE RUNS 86 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area (Santa Monica & Playa del Rey). WRITER: Thunder Levin.
