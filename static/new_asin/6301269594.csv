Unmasked Part 25 (1989) **1/2 / 4
D: Anders Palm
C: Gregory Cox, Fiona Evans, Edward Brayshaw, Debbie Lee London, Kim Fenton
P: A hockey masked serial killer, who has been immortalized in film, starts to doubt his murderous ways when he falls in love with a blind woman.

Spoof of the Friday the 13th franchise & slasher films in general starts out well with some richly detailed humor and by taking some unexpected risks. Part of the fun lies in trying to spot out the various caricatures that would pop up in a slasher film, seeing which rules they will break and figuring out just exactly how they will meet their maker.

In the second half, the film becomes scatter shot as the plot expands and the film loses its precision. A lot of the material fills like filler in an effort to make sure the film reaches feature length running time.

The first half is strong. The second half is so so. The overall results are a pretty good film that feels slightly disappointing, because the potential was there. If the film had just been slightly more focused and a little bit sharper, this could have really been something, potentially a cult classic. [R] 85 mins.

*Please Note: This review applies to the UNEDITED version entitled The Hand of Death.

This movie looks at the killer, at what must his world be like, honestly? It's got some genuinely funny moments in it, if you're into this sort of thing. Being British, the humor might seem to drag a bit to American audiences expecting a joke a minute, but the overall story, that of this doomed movie character trying to break free and actually have a normal life, is something I definitely cracked up about with friends discussing the stranger implications of the slasher genre. The movie, at least its title character, is definitely self-aware in the sense that his whole life is a sleazy horror film, and at one point wearily calls out to a victim ""Don't run, you'll only trip, and then I'll be right there............Told you!!"" I would love to see a DVD release of this, PLEASE. With extras and everything. Hell, for all I know, this might have just been a film school project, but I loved it. Another one of those movies that doesn't deserve the anonymity of the VHS titles that never make the transition.",1315094400,,1220,4.60091743119266

Previously unknown, these two dollar flea market flicks end up being a favorite distraction on dull Summer nights. Unmasked Part 25 may not be in the same class with Night of the Creeps or Prom Night II, but if you have a taste for horror with a darkly humourous bent, give it a shot. Serial killer Jackson is going about his business, massacring a party full of teenagers one by one, when he meets a blind woman named Shelly. Shelly mistakes Jackson for the date who stood her up, and a doomed romance commences. Jackson's father, no stranger to murder himself, is the devil on his shoulder, prodding Jackson to forget the girl and continue his gruesome work. Can Shelly's love convince the tortured soul in the goalie mask to abandon his past, or will his passion for blood eventually consume even her? Loaded with British wit, propelled by an awfully good soundtrack, Unmasked is one of the weirdest horror films your humble corrospondant has ever seen. Why Unmasked hasn't seen a DVD release, with the five minutes of gore and nudity excised from the American print restored, is an unsolved mystery. Robert Stack, where art thou?",1148428800,3,1254,4.837209302325581
