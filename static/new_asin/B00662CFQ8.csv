4961628,4,B00662CFQ8,Get very interesting perspective on some of the world's most influential battles.  Changes your view on what really happened and how the battles were decided.  Would love to see similar program for American focused battles (series is British).,1360454400,,243,5.368421052631579
4961629,3,B00662CFQ8,"There is a lot of interesting information about this battle in this video.  What is annoying is the claim made at the beginning, and throughout, that this is the first time such claims have been made.  John Keegan's 1976 *The Face of Battle*, which studies Agincourt, Waterloo, and the Somme, makes all of the arguments about the shape of the battlefield, the particular use of the longbow (including stating, quite matter-of-factly, that the arrows would not have punctured the armor of the French), the miscalculation in battlefield strategy, etc.  The new research unveiled in this episode, as far as I can tell, are the specific claims about the French social order/focus on ransom, and the quality of the battlefield mud.  The latter is clear in the contemporary accounts, however; and if the English archers' attacks were to be considered so radically against battlefield norms, one would think the French chroniclers would have mentioned it with disdain, since they watched the whole thing?  Anyway, there is much here that is interesting, but the show makes rather radical claims to its innovation that are disingenuous at best.",1359417600,,1136,5.118918918918919
4961630,5,B00662CFQ8,I have to say this is a rad DVD. It was a great price and shipped out fast. Love it.,1355356800,,84,3.25
4961631,4,B00662CFQ8,"It was a little to simplistic.  There was much more that could've been added such as detail on the signaling between Victory and other ships.  Overall, it was an interesting piece though.",1352073600,,187,4.8125
4961632,3,B00662CFQ8,"Love the History Channel, Military Channel, and all the documentaries they produce or I wouldn't have bought this DVD in the first place. But my review of this set is that its just 'ok' or maybe a little less, 2.5 stars tops and NOT worth the $40+ price. It isn't that the show isn't well done--the two cable channels mentioned make shows that are addictive for History 'geeks' like myself. But the episodes just don't have much 'juice' or suspense in my view. The big 'discovery' in most episodes is that terrain played a huge part in the battles they review and the outcome of who wins and why (Waterloo & Gallipoli in particular). Its all very well done and the computer graphics they use to recreate the effects of terrain and weather are all fine--they just aren't very 'exciting' to watch in my view. Its just a matter of taste. For me I was a bit diappointed with the show and wouldn't glowingly recommend to others it like I do other documentaries produced by the History Channel, certainly not at the price they're asking.",1332633600,12,1031,4.578378378378378
4961633,3,B00662CFQ8,"Just love the series but why don't they just
charge us 100 bucks for the set. Talk about
a rip-off.

4961634,5,B00662CFQ8,"New battlefield research will enlighten even the most informed war historian. Evidence discounts myths, previous reports, and reveals new truths. The new look at major fields of war is comprised from detailed searches of historians, real footage, computer generations, geology, archeology, GIS maps, art, dramatizations, military figure interviews, strategists, meteorology, arms & warfare experts, artifacts, oceanography, and even psychiatry.

The History Channel presentation is unbiased, using all forms of entertainment as well as educational methods, not just narration. See old footage, and the present day scenes of where battles were fought. The detective work is intended to find out if history has been true to the reasons for the outcomes of these none battlefields. Myths are vanquished, lies revealed, and victor's names sometimes reversed. It is truly amazing viewing. Even my wife found each episode compelling, and educational.
A must-view set for any war historian.

2 AGINCOURT'S DARK SECRETS: Oct 1415 -Henry V vs French in this Shakespeare glorified battle. Was the longbow the English victor's edge? 7000 Eng vs 20,000 Fr; iron vs steel; havoc vs accuracy.

4961635,4,B00662CFQ8,History is always written by the victors from their point of view. Finally an unbiased evaluation to determine what actually occured,1377820800,,132,5.333333333333333
4961636,5,B00662CFQ8,"I will wind up watching the entire series - new tech gives us a lot more information, or at least clues.",1377648000,,104,4.0
4961637,4,B00662CFQ8,"Battlefield Detectives starts with an excellent premise:  apply modern technology and archaeological technique to produce a truer picture of famous battles that either lack detailed documentation or are the subject of enduring myth.  In some episodes, this succeeds brilliantly, casting new light particularly on the Battle of Hastings, the Charge of the Light Brigade in the Crimean War, the Battle of the Little Big Horn, and the Gallipoli Campaign of WWI.  In other cases, particularly the Battles of Agincourt, and Trafalgar, the producers appear to have started with a premise and used only such evidence as supported it, often ignoring well-known contemporary documentation in their iconoclastic zeal.  All episodes are interesting, but some need to be taken with a grain of salt.",1376870400,,786,5.418032786885246
4961638,5,B00662CFQ8,I absolutely love this series.  Brings new information to known subject.  Amazon needs to get more episodes of the show.,1376179200,,120,4.95
4961639,5,B00662CFQ8,"This show will challenge even your most-educated historical mind in one way or another.  Definitely worth the buy, and definitely worth the wait!",1374624000,,145,5.304347826086956
4961640,4,B00662CFQ8,The digs for artifacts are interesting but when they show the landscape that gives perspective to battles and positions it can make you feel as though you are there in person.,1373760000,,175,4.67741935483871
4961641,5,B00662CFQ8,I've watched every series and hope they continue to make more.  I prefer learning something when I watch t.v. rather than ingest all the garbage out there.  They have re-written some of the things I learned in my youth.,1373414400,,219,4.589743589743589
4961642,5,B00662CFQ8,If you are not up on ancient battles this may loose you but the those of us that like the old battles this is great.  You will love the step by step info on hows and why.  Give it a shot its worth learning about battles you may never have heard about.  Done very well.,1372982400,,268,3.8363636363636364
4961643,4,B00662CFQ8,Very interesting reconstruction of famous battles.  Fun to watch when you want light viewing.  Different from ordinary TV shows.  Somewhat English centric though.,1372032000,,162,5.956521739130435
4961644,5,B00662CFQ8,"This show was a fun and easy way to learn about battles. I'm not a war geek by any stretch but I do like history. I knew of course about Waterloo and Hastings and, in a vague way, about the Crimean war, but I didn't knew much about what happened at these battles other than which side won. The show more or less ""filled in the blanks"".",1371945600,,335,4.014925373134329
4961650,2,B00662CFQ8,I watched the episode on Vietnam and considered it for a history class.  Some of the other episodes are A LOT better.  The Vietnam episode took something that was massively complex and tried to over-simplify it.  I just felt that someone without a lot of background knowledge would be misled or wouldn't have the frame of reference needed to really comprehend what was being discussed.  The film and its premise were accurate but its limitations made it not very classroom friendly.,1368489600,,482,4.91358024691358
4961651,5,B00662CFQ8,"I love the way the investigators use a blend of contemporary documentation along with scientific evidence to unravel the truth behind the myths of some of the greatest battles the world has known,",1368230400,,196,4.96969696969697
4961652,5,B00662CFQ8,"The impressing thing about this series is it covers the times from Ceasar's battles with the Gauls to World War Two. The ability of the program to reveal much that is not reported and information that is freshly discovered by experts gives new and often contrary information on the terrain, armies and politics of the battles it reportss on.

One of the History Channels finer series.",1365811200,,384,4.818181818181818
4961653,4,B00662CFQ8,Interesting analysis of major battles and answers some of he vexing questions about why commanders did or did not take take action at the proper time.,1365724800,,150,4.8076923076923075
4961654,1,B00662CFQ8,"In their 'Battle of Britain' episode...
Somehow for a show that has its premise as 'scientific', the one stated claim stands out as bogus. They repeated that Polish Air-force was literally destroyed in first few hours. This is a lie told by German propaganda, very far from truth. In fact - and this is proven in almost all sources, Polish resistance lasted few weeks and cost Germans over 125 lost planes. It is a shame to attempt to be scientific and repeat lie.
Producers should apologize.",1365638400,,492,4.732558139534884
4961655,5,B00662CFQ8,"This is a very interesting show with military experts throughly examining different historical miliary battles. I really liked that, even when they don't know what happen on the battlefield, they break down different scenarios of how the battle progressed. Detailed and visual,each battle is broken down and analyzed.",1365033600,,317,5.625
4961656,4,B00662CFQ8,Very entertaining and educational. The video quality was great and the technology that was used during the research is still pretty relevant today. I look forward to watching the rest of the shows in this season.,1364947200,,212,4.916666666666667
4961657,4,B00662CFQ8,This program covers covers a lot of ground.  You will learn about specific battles and the context of the times in which they occurred.  There are far worse ways to spend time in front of a television.,1362787200,,201,4.405405405405405
4961658,5,B00662CFQ8,"Great look at what likely happened at the battle of Agincourt in 1415. I am a Henry V buff and appreciated seeing theories as to what brought victory to the English and defeat to the French. I have always thought there was more to it than Shakespeare's version and while his take is inspirational and certainly a sense of nationalism is to be noted (""We few, we happy few, we band of brothers""), the battlefield soil content, French armor, French army being funneled, along with the English long bow all led to the outcome. It was great watching this video instantly at no charge through Amazon Prime. Thank you!",1362441600,,612,4.623853211009174
4961659,5,B00662CFQ8,This is a very nice series of a wide range of historical battles. They are easy to watch and understand. A+,1362009600,,107,4.142857142857143

8493649,5,B00662CFQ8,Brilliant! However they do not list the content? So I will: 9 episodes 1. Hastings 2. Agincourt 3. Armada 4. Trafalgar 5. Waterloo 6. Light Brigade 7. Custer 8. Gallipoli 9. Vietnam. 432 minutes,1430784000,,194,4.735294117647059

8493651,5,B00662CFQ8,"Great compendium of a variety of the Battlefield Detectives series from Athena to include Agincourt, Spanish Armada, Waterloo, Custer's Last Stand, and the Charge of the Light Brigade.  Although quite a few episodes, this collection does not include all of the Battlefield Detectives, so be careful if you are buying additional single DVDs to avoid duplicate purchases.  Really like this top notch series which applies scientific methods and factual evidence to examine battlefields of old to offer a more in depth explanation of what really happened.  You will be very surprised by some of the conclusions reached in the series.  As a retired Army Officer and student of history, I find all this extremely fascinating.  Wish there was a follow-on collection to this original compendium that would package all the other outstanding Battlefield Detectives shows such as Gettysburg.  A must have for any serious military historian.",1415491200,2,929,5.328767123287672
8493652,5,B00662CFQ8,"excellent series that I recall seeing some of the shows on TV years ago. They really do their research on these battles of the past & take you past the popular stories & speculation & at least point you in the direction of an educated, researched, probability of events.",1406246400,,270,4.530612244897959
8493653,5,B00662CFQ8,Show was informative and I learned more about the Charge of the Light Brigade. It was also informative about how heroic the Ottoman Turks fought in defense of Balaclava harbour. This is a piece of hidden history.,1394064000,,212,4.756756756756757
8493654,5,B00662CFQ8,"Enjoyed this series very much. I found it informative, enlightening and insightful. I wish there were more episodes made and more programs like this available on Amazon Prime.",1378512000,,175,5.285714285714286
