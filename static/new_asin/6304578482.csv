914794,5,6304578482,those dumb blondes are so loveable and sexy that this is the best everyday movie . those voices are hilarious!! YOU Couldnt help it if you had scoliosis!!! HA !Ha The squeaking back brace is a killer,925430400,,199,4.405405405405405
914795,4,6304578482,"Despite what most of the previous reviews would have one think, this movie isn't as floofy as it at first appears, but there's no reason to start desperately grabbing for deeper meaning either. All one really needs to  know is that this movie will make you happy. Lisa and Mira are both very  funny and have surprisingly good chemistry and timing together, Jeaneane is  at her best as her stock cynic, and the great and powerful Alan Cumming is  his usual charismatic and fantabulous self as Sandy Frink, who seems to  jump into the scenes where you were just about sure your grin couldn't  further widen. The ""interperative dance"" at the end is one of the  funniest pieces of physical comedy in recent movie memory. Fun costumes,  fun lines, a fun soundtrack, and a fun cast all make Romy and Michele a  great movie for your collection, but the only truly exceptional thing about  this movie is Alan Cumming's comic performance.",924134400,3,929,4.714285714285714

914875,3,6304578482,"Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow play two air heads who are best friends, room mates, and do everything together.  When they hear about their 10 year high school reunion.  They decide to go.  It's a little hard to believe they were nerdy out casts in school  So they make up a story to show the girls who pretty much ran the school.  How successful they've been.
This seems like a t.v. movie  to me.  And there is a dream sequence in it that seems like they put it in to stretch the movie out.  Any way it's not bad.  It has it's moments.  And it's good enough to watch over.",1516924800,,571,4.109090909090909

914925,5,6304578482,"Obviously, the film itself is as near-perfect as they get, or you wouldn't be here. If you're curious about the Blu-ray release, I'd say it's pretty good. There are a few moments where the sound drops slightly, but there's no glaring artifacting and the visuals are crisper and more detailed than ever beforesometimes in unintentionally hilarious ways. (For example, Janeane Garofalo's wig in the flashback sequences is even more noticeable and outrageous.) The Eighties pop standards sound great and clear, and that iconic dance scene at the end has never looked better. I'd say spring for this, I can't imagine a better transfer is going to happen until Criterion oversees one. ;)",1512345600,,682,5.098214285714286

I've never thought she was convincing in anything. She's certainly not funny. Lisa Kudrow is funny and kept this show alive. However, I did fall asleep with fifteen minutes (or more) left in movie.

My adult daughters and I watch this on holidays and quote from it, ""Ramon, Ramon...""  The actors are all well known and especially love Alan Cumming who plays Sandy Frink, the ""Frinkazoid"" as there is always some nerdy and smart person, who ends up the billionaire and has the last laugh.

Full of heart, entertaining dialog, humor, with a pleasing story and engaging (even if somewhat 2 dimensional) characters.

915572,5,6304578482,"I watched this movie when I was nine or ten and it's still as enjoyable as it was after seventeen years.  I'm watching it again because I love it.  I can relate to the characters in that I'm reasonably happy, but my life isn't impressive as I would like it to be and I compare myself to former classmates who have done better than me in life and I think the plot is all something we can relate to and I think that's part of the reason reviews of this movie have been overwhelmingly positive. The only quibble I would have is that despite Michele being unemployed and Romy being a cashier, their lives don't look miserable.  I know it's only a movie and not real life, but they live in California (IN AN APARTMENT NEAR THE BEACH!!) I bet in reality, it would cost a fortune to live in an apartment near the beach.  The sun is always shining in the movie (I love sunny weather); I am impressed with their style.  I really loved the clothes they wore in the movie and I would wear anything they'd wear (bar the 80s outfits of course) and I don't usually give people compliments for their clothes, but I have to compliment the characters' style because I was impressed.  I think my favourite part of the movie would be the dream sequence because it's very surreal and fascinating.  I loved some locations in the movie like the beach, the prom and the hotel where the high school reunion was held.  Those are places I would love to socialize in.  I was very happy with the ending.  I'm glad Romy and Michele got their revenge and had the last laugh on the ringleader of the A group and her husband.  I am surprised Sandy didn't reject Michele after the way she snubbed him during high school and at the prom.  But anyway, great movie, nonetheless.  I really enjoyed it.",1462233600,,1764,4.3577981651376145

Some may not see it, but beside the comedy & the fun 80's music, in the end,  it's also a story of self-acceptance, & knowing ""there  IS life AFTER high school !!",1454544000,,364,4.3088235294117645

Can't explain exactly why, but it just makes me feel good to watch it. there is a innocent brilliance in this story. The journey of Romy and Michelle reminds me of a study in eastern philosophy.

915863,5,6304578482,"Romy and Micheles High School Reunion is a movie centered around two Los Angeles area residents Michele Weinberger (Lisa Kudrow) and Romy White (Mira Sorvino). Both of them are in their late 20s and become concerned about what they have done with their lives after Michele encounters a former classmate named Heather Mooney (Janeane Garofalo). Heather Mooney is doing well for herself on a financial level and influences Romy White to think about her own life after an encounter at work (Heather was one of Romys customers at a car dealership). In addition, Romy finds out about the upcoming high school reunion and decides (along with Michele) that they are going to make an attempt to go. However, as they look and reminisce on their lives via a yearbook, both women realize that they want to try to make some changes before the reunion in order to get back at how they feel they were perceived in high school. I admit that Im a high school graduate of the class of 2000 and honestly did not attend my ten year high school reunion and Im truthfully unsure about whether I would actually go to my 20 year high school reunion (regardless of how my life turns out, even though Im proud of both where I came from and graduated high school from). However, this movie did inspire and remind me to begin now to choose carefully on how I want my life to unfold and change for the better within five years from now (by the summer of 2020 at the latest). The following are some of the other multiple  actors/actresses associated with Romy and Micheles High School Reunion; Camryn Manheim, Alan Cumming, Julia Campbell, Mia Cottet, Kristin Bauer, Elaine Hendrix, Vincent Ventresca, Justin Theroux, Jacob Vargas etc. There are multiple popular songs featured in the Romy and Micheles High School Reunion film such as; I Want Candy by BowWow, She Blinded Me With Science by Oingo Boingo, Dance Hall Days by Wang Chung, Addicted To Love by Robert Palmer, Footloose by Kenny Loggins, Karma Chameleon by Boy George, Dont Get Me Wrong by The Pretenders, Venus by Bananarama, and more songs featured in the movie.",1437609600,,2097,4.729508196721311

916122,5,6304578482,"Got a real kick out this when it first came out.  Great soundtrack of pop music from the decade that the story spans (80s to 90s).  The script is deftly crafted, despite the lightness of the theme, like a great short story, having no wasted elements: everything is central to the story -- which feels mostly like a fun romp, but then turns out to be, very warmly, about about learning to be cool with yourself.  I also recall thinking the two leads were easy on the eyes, and the supporting cast is great.

For parents:  While there are a few suggestive elements, and a gruff-language character (a fabulous Garofalo), I think it's pretty good family stuff, so long as the kids are at least 13, and the parents are no more than averagely conservative about suggestive themes & language.

UPDATE:  It holds up well; I just watched in Blu Ray, enjoying it almost as much in review (15 years later).  It has a certain John Hughes feel to it, in a good way.",1422662400,2,952,4.431034482758621

916264,3,6304578482,"""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"" (1997) is about two Californians, Romy and Michele (Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow), who decide to attend their 10-year reunion in Arizona. Since they were misfits in high school they lie about their success and face the ramifications thereof. Janeane Garofalo is on hand as as a no-nonsense fellow high schooler.

While this comedy is fairly amusing and many elements of the story ring true, it's told from the protagonists' perspective (naturally) and would therefore appeal more to women. I'm on the fence with Sorvino and Kudrow -- I neither like nor dislike them -- so it's the story and peripheral characters that are going to make or break the film for people like me, but I can't remember that many memorable parts even though I saw the movie two days ago, which isn't a good sign. On the plus side there's no raunch.

So it's worth checking out if what I said piques your interest but, for me, meh.

The film runs 92 minutes and was shot in the general Los Angeles area.

Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow star as Romy and Michelle, two clueless high school friends from Arizona who now live together in LA. When Romy runs into an old high school classmate (Jeanne Garofalo, who I usually like) at work, Romy and Michelle decide to go to their 10th high school reunion. But they decide to make up cover stories about themselves so they can be seen as successful career women, which they're not. So they drive across the desert in a borrowed Jag reliving various high school memories. When they get there, the old popular girls are still total witches and treat them pretty shabbily -- except for one who is now a fashion editor and compliments them on the clothes they've made to wear. Meanwhile, as a side note, Garofalo is also there, hooking up with a mysterious cowboy from her high school past. The ending is pretty predictable, but pretty funny nonetheless and while this isn't a highbrow comedy, this movie is a very funny comedy and worth a good viewing or two.

I don't think so. The quality here looks like a typical 480p standard DVD.

Now, it may be an improvement over the previous DVD release, but it just doesn't look like they applied any effort to sharpen the imaging in the film.  Everything still has that slight soft blurring that you generally see with your average DVD's.

This Blu-Ray film is released by Touchstone Home Entertainment. They haven't released a lot of Blu-Ray films yet.  The only other Touchstone film I have on Blu-Ray is ""Pearl Harbor.""

Anyway, I'll be watching this Blu-Ray only on my 32"" TV, where I watch only my standard DVD's, because a smaller screen gives a bad picture a better chance of looking improved.  This is the first Blu-Ray disc that I've bought where I have to make that decision.  This Blu-Ray disc of ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"" just doesn't look good on a larger TV.

Maybe they'll remaster this film better when they re-release it as a 20th Anniversary Edition.  Somehow, I see that coming as a profitable intention on their part.",1344556800,4,1258,4.703196347031963

Really, I'm just here to testify that R&M, from the first time I saw it in 1997 and in each of the probably dozen viewings since, remains one of the funniest 'guilty pleasure' films of all time!  AND it has a heart of pure gold at the center of all the hysterical post-high school hijinks.  The vintage 1980's New Wave soundtrack alone is worth the cost of admission!

Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino dive into their characters with a fearless gusto, creating iconic (if slightly moronic) 1990's versions of clubgirls who are BFF's since high school, and continue to be the essential supports for each other's sometimes fragile and yet utterly unwarranted and overblown self esteem. It's kind of ironic, and more than a little pleasureable watching two of Hollywood's brightest and most generous actresses portraying such completely self-absorbed, delusional characters!

The rest of the cast is equally brilliant and deliciously funny.  Janeane Garofalo is wicked as R&M's fellow high school alum, a nicotine-addicted, angst-ridden, goth-girl who just can't get past her loner status in HS, even though she's gone on to create success for herself following her heart....or rather her cravings. Cameron Mannheim seems impossibly naive, young and vulnerable playing the classmate who was involved in everything, and annoyed the hell out of the rest of the class. Alan Cumming is literally unrecognizable as his character morphs from nerdy HS geek to Billionaire mogul.  And on and on, the cast of largely at the time upandcoming actors seem to really enjoy playing their parts as if they were hitting for the outfield fence....which could go wrong in another film, with another script or another director, but here it just adds layer upon layer of comedic icing to this cinematic confection!

I won't go into all the plot turns and contrivances, but suffice to say R&M is chock full of funny (and occasionally sweet) scenes providing a look into the minds of these young women who refuse to see their rather mundane lives as anything less than full blown exciting, and their exuberance is contagious!  Can we just talk a minute about the dance club scene early on in the film, where R&M, disappointed at that night's prospects in the club, decide to dance together, and casually step out onto the dancefloor, launching in a perfectly synchronized and choreographed disco pas de deux???

YES, I love Romy and Michele---I always have and I always will.  They NEVER fail to brighten my spirits.  Rock on, Girls, and welcome to HD at last, you deserve it!",1336780800,6,2810,4.980769230769231

Karmic debts are paid at the high school reunion from hell, where the nastiest of adolescent bitches have grown up to be much older bitches. They still live to judge all who do not meet their standards. The nerdiest of nerds has returned a triumphant millionaire. The baby-in-black angry chick reconnects with her tormenter, who confesses his love for her. Every pay-off you can imagine is acted out with players who are not much more than charicatures, but it's all great.

Enter Romy and Michelle, desperate to show everyone that they have acheived great success, but the best they can come up with is that they are the inventors of post-it notes. (Duh.) Obviously, the truth comes out, lessons are learned, and there is the happiest of happy endings.

Anyway the film is about two young women who are approaching 30 years of age, and find out their high school reunion is coming up.  They really want to impress their classmates, in particular a group of ignorant and sassy young ladies who the two girls *despised* while going through high school.

So the girls find a way to impress their old classmates until the big day arrives, and of course, there's relationship segments involving a certain boy that one of the girls likes.

It's a very likeable style of humor.  The jokes aren't necessarily one-liners, but the humor comes more in the way in how the storyline develops.  It's not for everyone though.  Don't expect immediately, jaw-droppingly amazing jokes.  Just expect a few smiles here and there.

It's also a very respectable movie (despite the ""f"" word being thrown around occasionally of course!) and there's nothing particularly dirty about the storyline either.

Overall, it's a pretty good movie that has enough laughs to recommend watching.",1287705600,,1198,4.876237623762377

They set out to make themselves, and the last 10 years, over to impress everyone at the reunion.

The soundtrack here is impeccable.  Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino, two of the top comediennes of the previous decade, have chemistry to burn.  To boot you have Alan Cumming, one of the great British funnymen, as the object of Kudrow's affection.  Irresistable is an understatement.",1247270400,,571,4.775510204081633
917797,4,6304578482,"Romy White (Mira Sorvino) and Michele Weinberger (Lisa Kudrow) have been friends since they met at Sagebrush High in Tucson. Since then they both moved to Los Angeles, and they live together, but other than getting out of Tucson they are what might be described as under achievers. Michele is unemployed and Romy works as a cashier in the service department of a Jaguar dealership. They do, however, have flair, style, and share a unique fashion sense.

At the Jaguar dealership Romy recognizes Heather Mooney (Janeanne Garofalo), another Sagebrush alumna, in line. Heather is obviously doing well if she can afford a Jag. She has no time for old High School chums, and barely conceals her disdain, until Heather hears that Romy is still friends with Michele, and it is revealed that Heather had a crush on Sandy Frink (Alan Cumming), who totaled ignored Heather because of his infatuation with Michele.

Michele, for her part, was indifferent to Sandy's affection, because Sandy was kind of a dork. They called him the Frink-a-zoid, and isn't that always the way it is with these love triangles, or perhaps it was a trapezoid or even a rhomboid, or some other kind of oblique-angled parallelogram with unequal adjacent sides

The 10-Year High School Reunion looms on the horizon and the die is cast. Though Heather claims she wouldn't be caught dead there, they all have a date with destiny.

Romy and Michele want to lose weight, get good jobs, and good boyfriends. When two weeks proves to be too short a time to meet their objectives, they go to Plan B: Claim to be the inventors of Post-Its, and therefore rich and successful. That plan doesn't really work out, either, but at least we get a good comedy romp where scores are settled, lessons are learned, and a good time is had by most.

Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow create quite the whacky kooks. Though Sorvino won an Oscar for Mighty Aphrodite, she doesn't have to resort to quite such a cartoonish voice for her Romy. Though Sorvino is certainly talented, I always thought that Oscar she won for Aphrodite was kind of a My Cousin Vinnyish fluke. If I could hand out Oscars, she'd get one for this movie instead. The part where she tells off the queen bee of the ""A"" group alone could qualify her for one.

Romy and Michele are bottle blonde bimbos, but their dark roots are showing. Lisa Kudrow received a degree in Biology from Vassar College, and Mira Sorvino a degree in Asian Studies from Harvard University, so during production of Romy and Michele, they nicknamed each other ""Smart"" and ""Smarter"".

An excellent counterbalance to their blonde humor is the dark and bitter Janeanne Garofalo. She makes those withering remarks that you wish you would've thought of back when you were being tormented in High School. She is a tough cookie, but then she has that vulnerable side. She can take the most polite and pedestrian prose, but through her brilliant delivery you sense the subtle malice seething underneath that thin veneer.

Alan Cumming made a great dork, and though he was kind of a deus ex machina, plot wise, he does get to finally dance with his beloved Michele, though only if Romy can dance with her, so it is still a triangle, albeit an isosceles triangle with the two equal sides of Romy and Michele. It is an interesting twist on the whole dance at the prom or reunion scene, and is set to the lovely 80's ballad ""Time After Time"" by Cyndi Lauper. The title fits in well with the whole reunion theme, too.

Director David Mirkin does a great job for someone who has mostly worked in television. He keeps the jokes and pop culture references flowing -- Mary Tyler Moore Show, Pretty Woman, Footloose -- he has the boys in the Jaguar Service Department watching The Simpsons, and as an inside joke, it is one that he directed. Though he worked mostly in television, it was good television. Besides The Simpsons, there was the brilliant but short lived Chris Elliot vehicle Get a Life, Newhart, and The Larry Sanders Show. Mirkin did a great job directing this film, and even his name is funny.

Although I told myself I was looking merely for a soothing presence, a  glorified pot-au-feu, an animated merkin, I settled for ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion."" Ah, the High School Reunion Genre, it must have been something in the zeitgeist of 1997, because that year also saw the release of ""Grosse Pointe Blank,"" also featuring a 10-Year High School Reunion; only this one had a better selection of music, and the protagonist, Martin Q. Blank, was a professional hit man, so his problem was what to tell people he did for a living since graduating.

The shot gun marriage of action movie with High School Reunion comedy that was ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" didn't work nearly as well as R&M'sHSR, but Romy and Michele also had trouble telling people what they did for a living, since Romy was a cashier, and Michele was unemployed. Not very impressive.

Though Romy and Michele were not very impressive, ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"" was very impressive. Very impressive, indeed.

---------------------
Michele: Hey Romy, remember Mrs. Divitz's class, there was like always a word problem. Like, there's a guy in a rowboat going X miles, and the current is going like, you know, some other miles, and how long does it take him to get to town? It's like, 'Who cares? Who wants to go to town with a guy who drives a rowboat?

917798,5,6304578482,"Romy & Michelle's High School Reunion  (1997) Mira Sorvino, Lisa Kudrow
If you hated your years in high school (and I imagine probably everyone but the select few ""populars"" did...ergo the wide appeal of this film!!) then you will connect with this satiric, wild ride chock-full of witty dialogue & brilliant characterizations.

Before a scant 5 minutes have passed in this film, the scriptwriters get your attention right out of the starting gate with great lines between the title characters such as: ""You know we've seen Pretty Woman like 36 times and I never get tired of making fun of it"" and later on in a nightclub when they determine that there are just no hot guys there and decide to dance with each other, Romy wonders if it would be better to be a lesbian. Michelle asks her if she wanted to try having sex together just to see if she was. ""Oh no"" Romy says ""the idea of having sex with a woman just freaks me out."" But then after a moment of careful reflection concludes ""but...if neither of us has gotten married by the time we're 30, ask me again.""

This movie took a chance on hiring what were then relatively new to the game players (Alan Cumming - ""I am invincible"" Boris from Golden Eye, Mira Sorvino from Mighty Aphrodite and Jeane Garafolo - Carmine the Bowler's daughter from Mystery Men) and was rewarded with the complex portrayals that usually come with older & more experienced actors. We all know how people can get stuck in a time warp and feel that either high school or college was the best years of their lives and never grow out of it. Such teen-angst-turned-impenetrable-adult-fortress is a hard one to pull off, but this cast does it beautifully. I particularly liked the quirky underlying Wizard of Oz-ish There's No Place Like Home theme - or in our heorines' case - There's No Better Person To Be Than Yourself.

And the movie's title provides the perfect platform for the double entrende of the concept 'Reunion'. Our 2 girls discover on their road trip that the reunion they really wanted was with themselves and to reach a true understanding of how wonderfully original, kooky and happy they really are.",1238025600,2,2143,4.661375661375661
917799,5,6304578482,"I thought ROMEY & MICHELLES HIGH SCHOOL REUNION was an awesome hilarious movie about 2 not so bright Southern Californian blondes who attend their 10-year class reunion in Tucson who have nothing special or remarkable to share with their former classmates at the reunion, but Romey & Michelle(Mira Sorvino, Lisa Kudrow)end up getting their little sweet revenge on all the people who wronged them in high school at the conclusion of this movie when Romey & Michelle make up and put an end to their differences with a great happy ending of this movie when Romey & Michelle start a clothing business in L.A. along with the fact that justice gets served when Romey & Michelle get their little sweet revenge against the ruthless & snotty gals who picked on them all throughout high school and against the popular jock boy who stood Romey up on prom night in the Spring of 1987.

ROMEY & MICHELLE'S HIGH SCHOOL reunion also plays a lot of cool classic songs from the 1980's like TURNING JAPANESE by The Vapors, KARMA CHAMELEON by Culture Club, OUR LIPS ARE SEALED by The Go Go's, I WANT CANDY by Bow Wow Wow, HEAVEN IS A PLACE ON EARTH by Belinda Carlise, EVERYBODY HAVE FUN TONIGHT by Wang Chung, WE'VE GOT THE BEAT by The Go Gos, etc., plus Romey & Michelle's High School Reunion was also like a movie that took us back to memory lane on life in the 80's.

The only thing that sucked was in this movie they played the songs FOOTLOOSE by Kenny Loggins and DON'T GET ME WRONG by The Pretenders, which are 2 classics from the 1980's that I really liked, but unfortunately neither song came out on either of the ROMEY & MICHELLE'S movie soundtracks that were released on CD back in the Spring of 1997 when this movie was released in the theatres by May of '97.

917802,4,6304578482,"Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino are a comedic dream team in `Romy and Michele's High School Reunion', a film that pits the two unlikely heroes against a slew of bullies from their past.

Romy White and Michele Weinberger are content with their lives.  They think of themselves as two cool chicks, but when they are faced with the prospect of seeing all their High School friends (and enemies) they realize that their lives are not that impressive after all.  In a rash attempt to make themselves appear better than they really are they concoct a plan to deceive their entire graduating class, telling them that they invented post-its.  Of course, as is to be expected, their faade will not last, but in the end they triumph as their inner person is found to be more desirable than that of their former acquaintances.

The films likeability hinges drastically on the comedic timing of the two leads, both of whom sell their characters brilliantly.  Kudrow is arguably the most effective of the two, her `Phoebe' brand of humor in full force here and proves that if any of the `Friends' cast mates should have received a `spin-off' it should have been Kudrow.  Sorvino, complete with that gruff manly voice, is also a comedic force, playing to Kudrow's strengths brilliantly.  This is not a smart comedy by any means, but the acting of these two is very smart for they help make these simple clichd characters feel fresh and new to us.  Janeane Garofalo is also hysterical here, delivering a brilliantly satirical supporting performance.

The film is a constant barrage of jokes that land for the most part (and the script is littered with quotable lines) and this helps take the simple plot to another level.  One may worry that the films running time would be too much for the flimsy plot to handle, but in the end one almost wishes that the running time were a tad longer since Sorvino and Kudrow are so funny.  That and the killer soundtrack make this one of those experiences you don't want to see end.

`Romy and Michele's High School Reunion' is predictable, but it's a fun type of predictable (much like the recent `Baby Mama').  It is truly a moment when predictability is very welcome.

Besides, who can hate this movie after watching that brilliantly choreographed interpretive dance routine?",1221177600,,2298,4.782278481012658

917905,3,6304578482,"I picked up this movie just to see it, if that makes any sense.  It was a nice, lite, airy comedy about a real horror story we have all dealt with : high school.  Two dizzy blondes who had been friends since those days and are still together have returned to their high school for the ten year reunion.  They really haven't amounted to much, but try to reinvent themselves as success stories to impress their former classmates.

This was a clever idea, but the idea did not stretch out enough to make a quality movie out of it.  I have been to my ten year reunion, and I must say that you feel sort of like a loser.  You can use it as a motivation to make things better for you, but we all lack in some way.  What is so funny is that, at least at my reunions, the popular kids, whose high school experience must have been so wonderful because they made everyone else so miserable, didn't show up.  People go right back to the same cliques they were in, even if they haven't seen or spoken to each other in years.  Maybe you don't have the loving spouse, fame, fortune, steller career or whatever else is so important, but neither do others.  The Mean Girls are losers.  Romy and Michelle of course rise to prominence after the reunion, and tell the Mean Girls off.

And know what?  You didn't need their approval then and you don't need it now.  So when the invite comes, pitch it out and move on.",1203033600,4,1397,4.242424242424242

i could seriously watch it over and over and over for like an entire week and still laugh at it, and anticipate certain scenes.

The movie is about them going to their high school reunion but soon after they get the invitation, they relaize that what they've done in the past 10 years isn't anything to brag about, so they ""rent""  a nice car and make up a story about them being business women who invented Post Its. they are mainly trying to impress the popular people that teased them in high school. yes, they finally tell them to shove it at the reunion and Michele hooks up with a weird stalker she had in high school that became rich from rubber used in shoes.

They keep thinking that they are inferior to the others and want to impress the others at the re-union after all those years so they get into a role playing. Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow are really very successful and funny in this film, I especially like Sorvino's playing. The film is not meant to be very serious, so don't expect a script that reflets with 100% accuracy the daily lives of people.

918005,5,6304578482,"This movie was actually a LOT better than I thought it would be.  I watched it on TV out of mere curiousity, esp. since my own reunion wasn't too far off at the time.  It really does make anyone reflect on their high school days & wonder what really has changed.  Romy & Michele ""like totally"" remind me of the relationship I had with my best friend & how we were like in high school... best friend loners that just wanted to be noticed and accepted.  The thing that always blew my mind was that for some reason, there were only the select few that were ""popular"", but who really gives them that position, only for it to not to even matter after graduation?  Other than just mere wishing, I never actually tried to be apart of the ""in"" crowd, I was too busy being a band nerd, & that was what my high school life was centered on so I wouldn't have to dwell with the social aspects.  Even still, I tried so hard to be the best, which I succeeded in, but what was I really doing it for, myself, or for everyone else's approval?  That's exactly what Romy & Michele want is approval, & they're gonna try as hard as they can to get it...only to realize, what were they actually doing it for in the first place?  I think a LOT of people can relate to this.  Another question still weighs my mind... ""What's the point of going if we're not gonna impress people?""  For the most part, you should go to a reunion because you want to, not just to impress people... but wouldn't it be nice at the same time to make someone gasp at your envious life?  Just for the record, I did have mine, but I didn't go because of various (convenient) conflicts.  If I did go, I at least wanted to talk & reflect with those classmates of mine (mostly in band) that actually did make that difficult period worth while.

Kudrow & Sorvino make a cute, awesome pair...I can't really think of anyone else able to pull off their characters as well.  Janeane Garofalo's character is equally amusing with her uber sarcastic comments.  There are so many funny scenes & memorable lines, like the hilarious ""Oh Ramon"" scene, esp. when she says ""you wanted it to be believable""....yes, smile if you wish.  Romy had her voice all too well planned out for when she announces: ""I invented post-its"".  Then when they try to impress the A crowd, you can't help but laugh when Michele says ""We're not the ones who got fat,"" or ""I hope your babies look like monkeys!""  Very very silly, but you can't help but laugh and agree.  You also can't help but feel for the girls' relationship, like when Romy realizes that they can't accessibly find new jobs & boyfriends in 2 weeks, & Michele says in her encouraging voice, ""But I thought you said we could?"", & then later she also tells her ""I thought high school was a blast"", referring to the fact that it was a blast because of Romy... which I totally related to.  And who can't help but love the 80's tunes!

The main drawback to the movie is the audience it caters to... which, of course, is female.  I even made my mom watch it, and she liked it.  I certainly have never met any men who have admitted to watching it, but I'm sure some could find it enjoyable once they get past the girly-ness.  It does seem overly girly at times, like all the fashion talk (I'm not much of a fashion buff myself), but this is overlooked for me because I'm always drawn to the various points the movie makes, like how it pokes fun at stereotypes & how materialistic society is.  Quite possibly I liked it so much because I related to the characters, and if you don't relate to the characters, you might not ""get it""... or maybe you will.  In a way, they reminded me of female versions of Beavis & Butthead... where they're in their own world, one's smarter, but they still have lots of witty things to say.  Who knows, it may have been really boring if the girls had been extremely intelligent... but who cares, it was fun the way it was.  Either way, even though the movie may seem silly & simple on the outside, on the inside is a lot of laughs & thoughts to stay with you through each viewing.

The movie's plot may be thin not to mention that probably a third of the movie was a dream sequence. But it just works, especially if you're game with the movie. Probably because Mira Sorvino and especially Lisa Kudrow were perfect in a role they were so adept at playing.. Sorvino was more in your face with her attack on the comedy of the character. Kudrow on the other hand is more oblivious to her comedy that's why it's double as funny and as effective

There were some really funny lines (Romy on mono - ""that's like the best diet ever""),  some visually amusing scenes (watch out for the old version of Romy and Michele in the dream sequence and the infamous Time after Time dance sequence), and just some wacky ideas (working out on their high heels, the Mary and Rhoda fight)

Realizing that their lives aren't so exciting after all (as 28 year old unmarried roommates who work as cashiers when they work at all, and spend most of their nights out clubbing but going home alone together), the girls decide to make themselves over as businesswomen. Romy poses as the inventor of the Post-It Note. (Michelle picked the color yellow.)

It's a neat plan, but of course it gets fouled up by the ""A"" girls and mean ol' Jeaneane Garofalo who can't say a single sentence without at least three colorful one-syllable words in it. Having been exposed as goofy fakes, Romy and Michelle decide to be themselves (that is, as goofy fLakes), and steal the show.

The plot's more worked over than the girls will ever be (let us hope), and just as slender, but Sorvino and Kudrow are so endearing and obviously had such a good time being silly together on camera that the movie never lags.

The brilliant Alan Cumming (Sandy Frink) and Janeane Garofalo (Heather Mooney) also have show stealing roles. You have your sterotypical roles in this: the outcasts, the popular and pretty girls, the football player, the 'nerd', and the anti-social one.

At the reunion, Romy and Michelle find their definition of success different from the girls of the ""A group"".  The ""A group"" girls are married and pregnant which is a typical stereotype of women at their 10 year high school reunion.  Romy and Michelle goes against the stereotype of women getting married and bearing babies.  Instead they portray a more modern representation of women in today's society.  In today's world women are moving more towards a career rather then becoming homemakers.  It's interesting how the movie depicts this idea.  This movie is definitely a must-see.

Although this film is meant to be a comedy, it can also be viewed as a parody for many of today's societal notions of what it means to be successful, as well as what it means to be a woman.
 As Romy (Sorvino) and Michele (Kudrow) examine what they have done with themselves for the past 10 years, they realize that in effect, they have done nothing. They decide that in order to go to the reunion, they must remake themselves so that they can impress their old classmates.

Their efforts make it seem that in society today; in order to be successful one must drive a nice car, and be wearing a typical business suit. They try to exemplify the stereotypical ""successful woman"", and go so far as to lie about their professions. At first, to Romy and Michele success is defined as having money and looking good. As the film goes on however, these women learn that this image of success is simply false. The women they were trying to impress, although successful, were not happy. Romy and Michele realized that even though they might not be successful under society's rules, they have found their own success because they are happy with each other, and what they have become as women.
 This film also stereotypes women as being ditzy, viewed by men as sexualized objects. In order to get her jaguar, Michele must fake having sexual intercourse with a mechanic. Throughout the movie both characters wear outfits that show a lot of skin, making them seem more attractive to men. They are extremely ditzy, and are portrayed as being subordinate to men because of their lack of intelligence.

When they hear about their ten year high school reunion, they are forced to think about their lives and are surprised to find that they have nothing impressive to share.  Because of their new found void, they decided to invent a new exciting life to share with their former classmates.  They place themselves in a life of wealth and success to impress everyone at the reunion.  When they arrive, all prepared to fake their way to acceptance, they realize that there is one person there who knows their real situation.  By creating a fake but ""better"" life they think that they will be more accepted by their peers than they were in the past.  They struggle to keep their old lives a secret and to let their new concocted lives stun the others.
 This movie is a classic representation of the blonde stereotype displaying the pairs' hilarious mishaps and brainless actions.  They are depicted as having the very typical passions of shopping, club-hopping, and creating their own fashions.  They try to throw all of this away and take on the role of the rich and successful business woman but later realize that it is not worth faking because the lives they live are just as good and even better.  The movie evolves around the all too common and (very sadly) realistic theme of impressing others by advancing their economic stance and success.

The story is about two ditzy blondes in their late 20's, Romy White (Mira Sorvino) and Michele Weinberger (Lisa Kudrow), who live together in Southern California and decide to attend their ten-year high school reunion in Tucson, Arizona.  Having little cash, the two manage to borrow a car to drive to Tucson, but become concerned about making a big impression on their former high school classmates.  They invent a story about them being businesswomen and inventors and reminisce about their high school days.  Throughout high school, Romy was infatuated with football star Billy Christianson (Vincent Ventresca), but he was dating the conceited Christy Masters (Julia Campbell).  Christy's friends included Cheryl (Mia Cottet), Kelly (Kristin Bauer) and Lisa Luder (Elaine Hendrix), who were otherwise known collectively as the ""A-Group"".  A nerdy guy named Sandy Frank (Alan Cumming) was infatuated with the then-back-brace-wearing Michelle, who wasn't particularly interested in him.  Then there were the other assorted high school personalities including the fast-talking & insensitive Heather Mooney (Janeane Garofalo), the maudlin Toby Walters (Camryn Manheim) and the shy nameless cowboy (Justin Theroux).
Though the plot and dialog are simple, the combination of the wonderful acting by Lisa Kudrow, Mira Sorvino, Janeane Garofalo and Julia Campbell, as well as the film's fantastic soundtrack, make ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"" a very entertaining comedy.  Songs in the film's mostly 1980's soundtrack include, but are not limited to, ""Just A Girl"" (by ""No Doubt""), ""Y.M.C.A."" (by ""Village People""), ""She Blinded Me With Science"" (by Thomas Dolby), ""Addicted To Love"" (by Robert Palmer), ""Whip It"" (by ""Devo), ""Time After Time"" (by Cindy Lauper), ""Footloose"" (by Kenny Loggins) and ""Venus"" (by Bananarama).  Memorable scenes include reminiscing about high school, Michelle at the thrift store, Romy with Ramon (Jacob Vargas), Romy & Michelle driving, the dream, reunion confrontations, the dance, leaving the reunion and the closing scenes.  Overall, I rate the light-hearted comedy ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"" with 4 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone that grew up in the 1980's.",1081814400,,2495,5.542105263157895

The strongest point of this DVD is its cute satire of what can & does happen at HS reunions.  So many times the people who were thought to be ""shoe-ins"" for success end up falling flat on their faces.  Meanwhile, the quiet people whom nobody ever paid any attention to end up becoming mega-successful.  This is a theme that is played out in a myriad of ways throughout the film.
It is demonstrable that Mira Sorvino is a dynamic actress who can play just about any kind of character there is.  She could easily go from playing a ditzy girl in the present film to playing college professor in her next project if she so chose.
It remains to be seen how far Lisa Kudrow's talents can stretch.  The clueless blonde she plays in this story is pretty much a clone of her FRIENDS persona.  I'd like to see her in a role that she's not typecast as.
The good news for this film is that Kudrow and Sorvino work well with each other.  They are believable as best friends who have virtually never been apart.  If nothing else, we get to view Kudrow in about a dozen different hairstyles during the movie, and she looks FABULOUS in all of them!
If you're looking for a cheesy flick that has some satirical moments, this movie is worth a look.  It's not hilariously funny, but there are some comical moments.  It's not a movie you will think about much after watching it, but it's just good enough to make you happy you saw it once.",1053475200,11,1863,4.399416909620991

A light .... ahem ... airy comedy about two social misfits going through their high school years and then making a grand appearance at their high school reunion. You know things never go exactly right until the end in these movies, and the same thing happens here. But hey! It's quiet the entertaining watch.
 Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino, awesome pairing. They made Romy & Michelle. This film could have seriously gone off the annoying bend, but it doesn't. It stays on a good track the entire time. A very hilarious track. Kudrow and Sorvino were awesome as the titular characters. They're interaction was great, and Kudrow's present air-headedness role is always a hoot. Janeane Gurafolo is a nice unpleasant character with many humorous lines that she gracefully pulled off. The woman never ceases to entertain. Alan Cummings plays an Alan Cummings role. I always like him in movies.
 The DVD isn't something to cheer about. Although the film is great enough, I wish a few more extras could have been spared. But taking note that the movie didn't necessarily come out when DVD hit its prime, it's okay for the lack of extras. What really would be great is an audio commentary from Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino. I say ""Special Edition!""",1053388800,2,1278,4.831050228310502

You don't need complicated storyline and supernatural heroes to make a good movie. Romy and Michele's straight-forward characters not only entertain the audience but give us deeper lessons and feelings, too. You don't have to be ashamed of who you are but be yourself and face your problems no matter how others may judge you. Their courage gets rewarded and there are emotional instances when they realize that there are other important things in life than career and money.

They receive an invitation to their 10 year high school reunion. Through ""flashbacks"" we see what they were like in high school, as well as a bunch of other characters like Heather, Sandy, and more. Romy and Michele don't have any boyfriends, and Michele isn't working. Once they start doing their forms for the reunion to see what they've been up to, they realize their lives aren't very impressive and decide to do something about it. They devise a plan and say that they invented Post It Notes. Romy & Michele have a falling out on the road trip there, and a weird dream ensues. Back to reality, at the reunion, dressed as business woman, they are laughed out of the place when their lie is uncovered by Heather. Romy & Michele make up and are friends again, and decide to have fun nonetheless. They realize it doesn't matter what anyone thought of them, that they had fun with each other nonetheless. They come in their own flashy outfits that their peers would have remembered them in, and ultimately take the place by storm and show up everyone who did them wrong in high school. Michele finally hooks up with Sandy, who had a crush on her in high school, Romy sets her crush straight, and they go back to live a fabulous life in LA where they own their own fashion store. Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow were made for these roles, it's truly a great movie for laughs and smiles. Oh and the soundtrack for the movie is excellent, 80's classics!

The two stars keep the film moving along, despite the various lapses in David Mirkin's direction, and the weird suspicion that the cute idea can't sustain a full-length feature film. (Proven by the lenghy mid-dream sequence). However, Sorvino and Kudrow are definitely worth seeing the film for. They know their characters, and become them, making these unbelievable women totally real. The supporting cast include the always wonderful Alan Cumming, Camryn Manheim, and Janeane Garofalo as a vicious, chain-smoking, foul-mouthed former classmate, who has some amazingly funny lines, and proves to be one of the better characters in the film. The 80's soundtrack just adds to the feel (and the fun). It is meant to me a fluffy, light, and funny film, and it totally succeeds on that level. This movie defines Guilty Pleasure!

918307,5,6304578482,"This movie is very cute, and airy on the surface, but it also illustrates the cruelty of high school. (If you don't recognize and remember this cruelty from your own high school, you WERE one of the cruel ones!) There is more to this film than you may wish to see. Or, you can just enjoy it for the fun on the surface.
Romy and Michele don't seem to have progressed far since their high school days, so they invent fake lives. Of course, when you invent a whole new life on little notice, there are bound to be holes, and you are bound to get caught, as they are. There are charming sequences from the heads of both women, of how they hope things will go.
By the end, if you step back and look, Romy and Michele have gone through quite a bit of growth. When you look at some of the people who were on the most likely to succeed, you can see that they simply stagnated. Those often labeled as most likely to succeed are those who peak in high school. It must be a sad fate to have the high point of your life so early. It was great to see some of what had been the popular clique outgrow their previous friends, and see the merits of those previously 'below them'.
This is a fun movie if you are already out of school, and may give some hope to those still in the grueling experience of high school. Life does get better, once you are outside of that artificial world of school.",1040342400,2,1377,4.141791044776119

It's just hilarious with wonderful acting (Lisa Kudrow in her usual air-head role, Mira Sorvina as the serious and sensible Romy, Janeane Garofalo as the surly, cynical Heather Mooney, Julia Campbell as the stuck-up Christy Masters, Vincent Ventresca as the ""dumb jock"" Billy Christianson, Alan Cumming as nerd Sandy Frink, etc.).  The cliques of the high school class are so typical and help the viewer really relate to this film.  Whose class didn't have their ""preppy"" group, nerd group, jock group, etc.? The early 80s music makes the film even more wonderful; however, the choice of tracks indicates a high school class of '84 rather than of '88.

918431,4,6304578482,"A high school reunion can be many different things to different people, and those who attend one do so for a variety of reasons.  For some, it's a return to the ""glory days;"" for others, it can be a masochistic attempt to purge the memories of a past they'd rather forget, but cannot; still others will go seeking vindication and/or retribution for real or imagined injuries suffered at the hands of juvenile miscreants during the formative years.  Then there are those who will go out of simple curiosity (""I wonder what so-and-so looks like now?) or just because it sounds like it might be fun.  And then there are those who would rather have red hot coals pressed into their eye sockets than show up at such a shindig.  Call it different strokes for different folks; but whatever you call it, you're going to meet all of these and more, in ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion,"" directed by David Mirkin, a light comedy that indicates that the past may have, indeed, been everything you thought it was, and more-- but that perhaps you just hadn't seen it clearly at the time.  And, upon returning to the scene of the crime, as it were, you discover that ten years of maturing and endlessly revisiting certain school days situations in your mind can do to your perception of it what laser surgery on the eyes can do for a myopic-- for maybe the first time in your life, you can actually see everything crystal clear, and the way it really was back in ""The day.""
It's been ten years since lifetime friends Romy White (Mira Sorvino) and Michele Weinberger (Lisa Kudrow) graduated from high school, left Small Town, U.S.A. and headed for L.A., where their respective endeavors have at last taken them both to the very top of the minimum wage pay scale.  When the news of their ten-year reunion comes down the pike to them, they're excited and want to go.  Upon reflection, however, it occurs to them that returning to an environment that was less than accepting of them a decade ago, without having accomplished anything more than successfully drawing breath on a daily basis, could possibly be construed as the proverbial fools errand.  They'd just be setting themselves up for the likes of perpetual Prom Queen Christy Masters (Julia Campbell) and her ""top of the `in-crowd'"" cronies (all of whom are sure to be in attendance) to once again come in for the kill.  Not a happy prospect.
Romy and Michele, however, have learned a couple of things since high school (and probably no more than that; it's why they're where they are today), and they put their heads together and concoct a plan through which they will finally obtain that which has always eluded them:  The cherished esteem of their peers (and most especially, that of  Christy Masters and her cohorts).  And it's so simple-- all they have to do is attend the reunion as a pair of successful businesswomen!  They even come up with the kind of business they're ""in,"" just on the off-chance someone should ask (what are the chances of that!).  It's a brilliant plan, it's foolproof and it's going to be fun.  And with that, Romy and Michele are off to their high school reunion.
Light comedy, like a meal consisting of ""lite"" ingredients, can be a delicious and satisfying treat for the cinematic palate.  When properly prepared and dished up in just the right proportions, it can be a cause for celebration; and Mirkin's film is just that-- a cause for celebration.  It's well crafted and delivered, works on a number of different levels and will appeal to a wide audience, inasmuch as the subject of the film is one to which most people are going to be able to identify and relate, and on a very personal basis, at that.  Without question, personal experience and individual frame of reference are going to determine how this one is received, and on which level; and it will hinge on which group from among those listed above in paragraph one the viewer falls into.  For some, this film is going to be fun-- taken at face value by the curious who just want a few laughs-- and they won't be disappointed, because this is funny stuff.  For others, however, beyond the surface humor, it may tap into some dark corners of the psyche, revealing things that have been repressed, possibly, but not forgotten.  And regardless to which group the viewer belongs, it will be those with a keen sense of perception that will understand that this is a comedy with some very serious underpinnings.
Again, it's the personal experience and frame of reference that will come into play here.  Those of a more superficial bent will see Romy and Michele as prime targets to be set up and used for fun; mere objects of derision held aloft for the merriment of others.  The more astute will recognize the cruelty enacted upon them for just what it is:  Cruelty.  And it's a sad fact that for many-- the ""real"" Romys and Micheles of the world-- the price of the education received in high school was high, indeed:  Tuition paid in psychological scars carried-- in too many instances-- throughout the remainder of one's life; scars born of the cruelty meted out by the ""perfect"" upon those deemed ""unworthy"" of acceptance in the prevailing social order.  Heavy stuff for a ""light"" comedy?  Perhaps.  But it's what makes this film so good; it entertains-- Sorvino and Kudrow together?  Forget about it, they're terrific-- but it also makes you think.  And, hopefully, it will encourage the ""real"" Christy Masters' of the world to pause and reflect upon past deeds and ""judgments"" handed down in the throes of juvenile self-righteousness.  ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"" is funny-- very funny-- but it also says something that is genuinely worth saying.",1029888000,3,5701,4.7272727272727275

  Romy and Michele weren't losers in high school, but they definitely weren't the popular girls.  They were just there.  The "" A "" group, made up of a few girls, were the popular group and really made their life hell.  Kristy Masters, I don't know the actresses name, was a total, well, female dog and was mean to Romy and Michele.  Romy and Michele were like best friends and they only did stuff with each other.
  Now it's 10 years later, and the girls are about 27.  They still have their sarcasm and everything, and they live together in California.  Romy bumps into Toby, Janeane Garafolo, at the place she works, the Jaguar Car Dealership.  Toby says how the 10 year reunion is coming up and Romy was puzzled ... she never got an invitation.  So the girls decide to go to the reunion, but one problem ... they want to look successful.  They want to show everyone how good they look, how they act, how proud they are that they live in California while everyone else is stuck in Tuscon, Arizona, where the reunion is.  I will stop here, as I don't want to tell the whole movie.
  Anyways, just see this movie.  It is so excellent ... you will start making sarcasm a part of your language....",995673600,4,1526,4.236111111111111
918657,5,6304578482,"I could totally relate to both Romy and Michelle in this movie because I know how it feels to be the laughing stock of a group of people in school. This movie brought back some painful memories of both my childhood and high school. The scene that really hit close to home was when both Romy and Michelle's were ""careers"" were unmasked.",984441600,,335,4.419354838709677

The movie also has great music, and all in all the movie is realy fun to watch.  Although i don't think that it portrays high school life so well, its fun to watch the divisions between different types of high school kids in an exagerated way.",974505600,,346,4.375
918659,4,6304578482,"Okay, it doesn't matter that I've seen this movie at least 36 times, I never get tired of plugging it.
Romy and Michele are invited to their 10-year High School Reunion.  But when they start filling out their questionnaire (""They want to know what we've been doing for the past ten years."") they realize their lives aren't all that glamorous after all.  So they devise a little scheme, making up a story involving the invention (and design!) of Post-It Notes.  Thus spawns the great debate: Who's the Mary and who's the Rhoda.
Of course nothing goes according to plan, and the two decide to part ways once they arrive at their reunion back at Sagebrush High in Tucson, Arizona (""This town is, like, so unhip!""  ""Oh, I know!"")
Despite the lengthy dream sequence in the middle of the movie, it made me wonder which group I belonged to in High School.  Definitely not the A group.  Lisa Kudrow was made to play Michele, the half-wit blonde with a heart of gold.  Mira Sorvino was just as convincing as her best friend forever, Romy.  The two could only be upstaged by the inimitable Janeane Garofalo.  Throw in the perky Toby Walters (played to a ""T"" by Camryn Manheim) and Alan Cumming as the ""pocket-protector"" geek who constantly lusts after Michele and you have one cute story.
Of course, no matter how much I like this film, the cheesy dance sequence towards the end always makes me cringe.  But it's still cute nevertheless.  When I want to reminisce of my own 80's high school days, I'll pop in this video and wax nostalgic.",971827200,10,1528,4.601476014760148

Alright, okay, I admit it, these are exactly just some of the reasons why you NEED to see this film !! Just buy this DVD so you can see get into the groove and be footloose with these good time gals.

So much of the stuff that happened in this movie has happened to me  throughout my high school years. It is the first realistic high school  comedy that I have ever seen, and I recommend it to anyone. For an R rated  movie, it really wasn't that bad. There were a few ""F words"" and  some very mild sex talk, but that was it. It could have easily got a PG-13  rating if it had had some trimmings here and there. Anyways, great movie!  Rent it!

918704,5,6304578482,"Since I am a child of the 80's, I have embraced the culture of it.  I love the music, I love to laugh at the styles that were popular then, and I love to laugh at pictures of myself with mile-high hair.
""Romy &  Michele's High School Reunion"" brought back a lot of those memories.  From the music to the clothes to the ""high-school mentality,"" I  laughed continuously through it.  Even my boyfriend got a kick out of it.  He doesn't normally like ""chick flick"" movies - he steers clear  of them.  However, I found him laughing right along with me.
This movie  also struck a nerve with me:  high school pettiness.  References to the  ""A"", ""B"", and ""C"" crowd made me practically  nod my head in agreement.
Romy and Michele's desperate effort to fit in  can mirror many people's experience when it comes to being liked by the  ""in"" crowd.  Their attempts to fit in and appear successful are  laughed at and announced to the whole school (this is where the old high  school pettiness comes in, even after 10 years) and Romy is devestated.  All she ever wanted was to fit in, to have others like her.
Michele is  quick to remind Romy that when it came right down to it, their high school  years weren't all that bad.  She had FUN.  So, why not do at the reunion  what they should have come for in the first place?  Be themselves!  Stop  trying to impress people!  Who cares what other people think?
Overall,  this movie is a fun romp to liven the spirits.  The 80's soundtrack is a  must, and the 80's kitsch will bring back many a fond memory.",963964800,4,1539,4.351063829787234

My husband, on the other hand,  literally suffered through it!  Therefore, my conclusion is:  THIS IS  DEFINITELY A (OH, I HATE TO USE THIS TERM, BUT HERE IT IS), CHICK FLICK!  The premise of the story is that these two women are preparing to go to  their ten year reunion, when they discover, (surprise, surprise!) that they  haven't accomplished a thing in those ten years!  So, they try to  ""reinvent"" themselves into ""succesful career women"" to  impress those snots in the ""A"" group, who always shunned them.  The premise is a good one; however, the movie does become a bit  unbelievable at times.  (Then again, this is not exactly a movie that is  SUPPOSED to be taken seriously)!

I  would recommend Romy and Michele to anyone who's ever had that one best  friend.. you know.. the one that you stay in tune with all the time.

What surprises me is that this movie is so well regarded by everyone.  I've seen  it twice, thinking I may have missed something the first time.  It had it's  moments, like the surreal dancing sequence at the end of the film, that was  quite touching.  The music was fabulous, considering it's from my  generation (The generation X!).  The story?  Well, that's when we run into  some problems.  The only thing i disliked about the plot was the  conventionality and the stereotypical portrayal of high school life.  I  think there's enough films about the trials and tribulations of a nerd  surviving the perils of high school.  One other high point of the film is  Janine Garofalo.  Although her character wasn't explored in depth, she gave  good..... performance.  I wish she would have cut loose more though, (like  more swearing and raunch).
