2438031,2,B000BQYX4C,"I wasn't expected much when I went to see this movie, and so I wasn't too disappointed. The acting is all right, but there really isn't any story and it's generally neither enjoyable nor believable. The entire movie seems to be about how good looking Steven Strait is and what a great musician he is, and while he is relatively good looking and can sing, there isn't enough there to make an entire movie out of.",1125360000,5,411,4.421052631578948
2438032,5,B000BQYX4C,I don't care what you say but this is an awesome movie!  I wish they hadn't stopped selling this movie and they came out with it on blueray ;),1354406400,,142,3.896551724137931
2438033,2,B000BQYX4C,OK lets just sum it up for everyone boy meets girl in corny subway scene then they meet up a couple years later they sleep together then they break up he makes it big time as a singer and he becomes mean (it was shocking NOT) then he becomes nice they meet at the airport and get back together and he decides to become a writer WOW that was sooo lame and boring i left to go to the bathroom and i actually looked for a way to escape lol. o and of course ashlee simpson sings b/c then the movie wouldn't of even made it to theaters. and the main characters name is breyer why didn't they just name her turkey hill or edys. and wat ever moron played Breyer did a terrible job i mean horrid.i clapped when it was over i think i was the loudest in the whole theater.,1277596800,,762,3.9869281045751634
2438034,1,B000BQYX4C,"This movie was truly awful and a waste of time.  It has a very typical and predictable plot. It's a ""boy meets girl, boy meets girl again, boy loses girl, boy finds girl again.""  A moron could write this storyline.  Let me just say one thing:  Stephen Moyer and Carrie Fisher must have owed an agent money to be put in this awful piece.  It's a waste of their talent and an embarrassment to their careers.  I was cringing for the both of them.

Do not waste your money.  Get something with substance instead of this, something with a better storyline that is not strewn with stupid dialog and predictable predicament.",1227139200,,617,4.495495495495495
2438035,5,B000BQYX4C,"You will watch this movie over and over again. 'just the right choice of actors for each part, and I'll search for these actors in other movies, both now, and in the future. An appealing and convincing movie. I was so convinced of the truth of this story, that I inquired about a ""Mr. Treadway"" and the businesses depicted, from an LA friend in the audio field.

This dvd has been touted to friends who have young family members, as high standards were followed in the making of the film.

'would like to see an ""Undiscovered II"" with all six of the leading actors back.",1178668800,,570,4.419047619047619
2438036,1,B000BQYX4C,"Absolutely boring, and with an enerving camera style, this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. The plot and characters are absolutely stupid and predictable, and even worst, they don't evolved a little bit in all the entire movie.

The best part is the skateboard dog and the goods looks of Steven Strait, but if you really wanna enjoy him, i better recommend you THE COVENANT. Is the typical horror flick, but at least, is not so presumptuos that this one.",1173571200,4,464,4.590361445783133
2438037,5,B000BQYX4C,"The movie is kind of cheesy. It wasn't really great, but Steven Strait is an excellent actor, not to mention a total hottie so it was definitely worth it.",1169164800,,154,4.344827586206897
2438038,2,B000BQYX4C,"Pell James and Steven Strait:  Two pretty people with no chemistry.

Ashlee Simpson:  Actually surprisingly likeable considering it's her.

Kip Pardue:  The most interesting and likeable thing about this entire flick.

Soundtrack:  Not too bad, but it isn't my cup of tea despite some strong INXS resemblance.

The Plot:  Slow, predictable, and at times really silly.  Pell James is pretty, but she looks like any other girl her age, and Steven Strait is trying too hard to be a universally liked Johnny Depp.

My rating:  Imagine the sound of the buzzer after three wrong guesses on Family Feud.  Sorry, you guys, but this movie just wasn't worth the five bucks I spent when I bought it off the previously viewed rack.",1154476800,2,719,4.8429752066115705
2438039,4,B000BQYX4C,"The movie lost me at the start with one of the guys enthusiastically proclaiming a totally plain looking girl dressed like a homeless person as ""gorgeous"", and then followed it up with ""the prettiest girl I've ever seen"", as if ""prettiness"" is really something cocky late teen/early 20s guys gush over. Around the 15 minute point it finds it's groove though.
In terms of visual atmosphere alone this film is an anomoly in the teen romance genre, and it also has a way of capturing casual moments by having participants in a group conversation expressing themselves with body language and facial expressions when others are speaking which creates a great sense of authenticity that I don't think I've seen since Crazy/Beautiful, which is still for my money the most poignantly realistic teen movie ever made. There's a minimal use of one-shots during conversations, and when they are used the transitions from one person to another aren't timed directly with when they start and stop speaking, so there's no reaction shots, it's all fluid. It creates a sense of everyone being in the moment instead of solemnly waiting their turn to speak and emote.
Visually the washed-out color, shaky cameras, and oddly framed shots are the opposite of what you'd expect from an MTV-style film featuring Ashlee Simpson. Actually focussing on the camerawork it seems maybe contrived, but for most of the movie it inconspicuously plays a vital part in adding mood and creating a portrait of the city at night which is as enchanting as anything in Lost In Translation.
Steven Strait's brooding singer-songwriter character is a bit of a caricature and Clea's description of him (""Luke has integrity. He wants to make it, but on his own terms.""), addressed half to her friend and half to the camera, may be the least subtle exposition line in the history of cinema.
Brier's reluctance to become involved with Luke due to her attachment to an old rockstar semi-boyfriend who doesn't seem to have any redeeming qualities is difficult to sympathise with.
I can't say the plot isn't predictable, but no more so than is the case with the vast majority of films. The fact that they end up together in the end really is just like who cares. They don't give any real reason for it. They could have just as easily gone the bittersweet ending and had them decide to stay apart. As far as emotional investment in the character's arcs goes, you'd have to be pre-invested before the movie started to get anything out of it. The manufactured rise and fall of Luke's music career and all the details that go into it make up a pretty unique secondary plot.",1147219200,7,2620,4.811529933481153
2438040,5,B000BQYX4C,"really, really great. steven strait is the best actor.

this film is * wow, wow, wow *",1142380800,,86,4.0588235294117645
2438041,1,B000BQYX4C,"This movie is ok, but predictable and the lead actress does not fit her character who is supposed to be this well known model maybe another profession would have been better for example an actress.",1138665600,,197,4.6571428571428575
2438042,4,B000BQYX4C,"I'll be honest, the reason I watched this movie is because Steven Strait is in it and he is HOT.  But to my surprise (and to the surprise of my friends who were watching it with me) it was actually good!  Thankfully Ashlee Simpson's role is not major, which was something I was worried about.  Yes, it is predictable, but aren't almost all romantic comedies predictable?  Take a chance, you might like it too.",1137456000,,409,4.486486486486487
2438043,1,B000BQYX4C,"This movie is way too predictable..... boy meets girl, boy and girl go on separate roads, boy girl find once more...and so on... one can pretty much guess the ending. Like said before teh story line is way to predictable and thus BORING. Acting was mearly OK, even ashley's acting was lacking. Over all I would say don't wast your time and money on this one. But then again this is only my opinion.",1137283200,2,398,4.391891891891892
2438044,3,B000BQYX4C,"Some little films are classified as 'sleepers': either they begin as unnoticed little gems that slowly emerge OR they put you to sleep.  UNDISCOVERED  is the latter.  Made by music video director Meiert Avis directing his first feature film and written by newcomer John Galt the backgrounds show. The result is an extended music video with dialogue and unfortunately the story has been told so many times we all know it by memory, making comparisons not only inevitable but also negative.

But everyone has to start somewhere, as the theme of the story points out.  The plot is thin - boy meets girl in New York, both craving the entertainment industry, both move to Los Angeles, both get caught up in the negative as well as the positive aspects of the climbing to the top life in LA, both are influenced by friends and family, choices are made, stuff happens.  This trickle of dialogue is parceled out between songs by a group of wannabe actors, some better than others.  Of the group Kip Pardue shows his more extensive experience and lightens the screen.  But the rest is, at best, a series of tryouts told at a pace that assures somnolence. But everyone has to start somewhere.... Grady Harp, December 05",1135814400,6,1209,4.723809523809524
2438045,5,B000BQYX4C,"Undiscovered is a untique kind of romantic comedy/drama.... Its yourtypically love story a guy falls in love with a girl that he doesn't see until she ends up moving over to LA and of course the guy gets the girl...... The story is very touching and i do have to say that Ashlee Simpson can act unlike her sister Jessica Simpson when she made her film debut in "" Dukes of Hazzard"" which by the way wasn't all that great..... I love that this movie had music and Ashlee gives us the viewers a little treat to her music!!!!!!! If you are a huge fan like myself of my girl Ashlee then you should buy this movie and thats that.....",1135728000,,627,4.233333333333333
2438046,3,B000BQYX4C,"In my opinion UnDiscovered was a good movie. I will say that there was not much to the plot of the movie and it lacked any real twists or suspenseful suprises. However the creators did an excellent job of capturing the fast paced lifestyle and struggles of many musicians. I would highly reccomend this movie to two demographics of the population... young teenage girls that enjoy drama and people who are involved in show business or people who have experienced that ""fast-paced"" lifestyle.(it will give you laughs and smiles as you see resemblences to people you know and parties you've lived.)",1132272000,5,596,4.910891089108911
2438047,5,B000BQYX4C,"I'm sorry to everyone who thought this movie was crap, but I have to say that I really enjoyed this move as a whole. Ignoring the fact that Ashlee Simpson is in it (and she's not actually that bad which was a surprise to me) the plot of the movie was unique, and the acting was pretty good. I'm sorry to everyone who disagrees with me, but I for one look forward to getting this DVD.",1131321600,9,383,4.052631578947368
2438048,5,B000BQYX4C,"I love ashlee simpson,as do all my friends and cant wait to get this on dvd. All you pecimists should spend more time looking at the things you like and saying good things,knowone wants to read negativities on a person your supposed to be reviewing the product in general terms not slamming the actors.

I say to anyone who enjoys the sweet attitude in films instead of gore and violence should buy this one for a quiet night in.",1131235200,6,429,4.430379746835443
2438049,1,B000BQYX4C,"First, I want to disclose that I only looked this movie up on Amazon (...) to find out the release date.  This will be the movie that I bring to what my friend and I are calling our ""First Annual Movie Crap-Off.""  I will be defending my claim that Undiscovered is the worst movie ever made.  And, believe me, I've seen some stinkers.  I have not been the same since my roommate dragged me to see this turd of a movie this summer.  I still wake up screaming in the night.  I would love to tell you exactly how bad this movie actually is, but there are no words.  No words at all.",1130544000,4,578,4.061946902654867

The story was (very) thin, but I did enjoy a number of minor characters more than I expected I would.  I may watch it a couple three times a year.",1422662400,,265,4.36734693877551
8091174,5,B000BQYX4C,GREAT!,1413849600,,6,6.0
8091175,2,B000BQYX4C,A likeable enough movie......certainly not the best that I've ever seen but just enough fluff to keep you interested for the 1 1/2 to 2 hours needed to watch it.  The best things about it are the skate-boarding bulldog and Kip Pardue (though not necessarily in that order.)  Things come entirely too easy for pretty people like Steven Strait and Pell James in both New York and Los Angeles but I suppose that things would be easier for anyone in the entertainment business with Carrie Fisher and Peter Weller in your corner.,1405555200,,524,4.684782608695652
