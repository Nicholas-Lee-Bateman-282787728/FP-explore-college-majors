This is a beautiful collection with a  wonderful bonus episode ""Tapestry"" from ""The Next  Generation"".  This collection has ALL the movies, including the latest  ""Star Trek Insurrection"".  Buyers should take note that there are  two versions of this VHS sets.  A widescreen version which features those  black-bars on the bottom and top of the screen, and a pan & scan  version which fits your standard TV set.  For purists, I highly recommend  the widescreen edition since it shows the entire image rather than slicing  it apart to fit the TV screen.  If you have a trekker in the family who  does not have any of the films, this is the gift to beat all gifts.  If you  don't feel like searching your local stores for all 9 film or if you want  to save some money rather than buying the movies one video at a time, this  is the set for you.",943142400,54,1019,4.319148936170213
