3460432,4,B001AQR39O,"Having absolutely loved Season One it was with a bit of concern I sat down to watch Season Two.. No need to worry however - it was a great watch and had it not been for Season One being just a tad better due to higher score for originality it lived up to and surpassed all expectations...

The writing is again the pillar and the new characters being brought in add well to the cast.

It of course begs the question if there is original material for yet another Season or two... but I for one certainly hope for at least one more season. If you loved Season One it is a must buy - if you disliked it I would strongly recommend you to stay far away!",1241568000,,648,4.0546875
3460433,3,B001AQR39O,"Season 1 was absolutely amazing, the best show on TV as far as I am concerned. The second season focused too much on trying to be funny, or a knock-off of Weeds. Unfortunately it missed the mark. However, it has some amazing moment mixed in with the goofy writing - especially towards the end that make owning Season 2 worthwhile. I can't wait for season 3, hopefully they listen to the fans and bring it back to what we love so much!",1230508800,13,434,4.304878048780488
3460434,3,B001AQR39O,"When series creator, Tom Kapinos, first sketched character Hank Moody, played by David Duchovny, it appeared as though he'd found a wormhole into the collective unconscious of middle-age, urban men.

Hank was a bright, talented guy who, like many of his generation, seemed powerless to consummate a functional relationship with his one great love, played by Natascha McElhone.

This very-public struggle was waged on the quintessential battlefield of urban decadence and moral relativity, Los Angeles; a place where he appeared to be both victim and willing co-conspirator.

The drugs, the endless sexual escapades, the chain-smoking, the hard drinking and the lawless swagger of a rock star on the verge of another overdose all peppered his course to self discovery like a series of land mines.

Kapinos nailed the arrested adolescence of many older single men with more than their share of talent, good fortune...and too much time on their hands.

So in this birthplace of pathological narcissism, here was this intensely desirable renegade in search of a better destiny...or mother, as the case may be...and everyone [the audience] was happy.

But that was season ONE.

The second time around things started to unravel. The psychological components that gave the show life began to morph into a series of clichs that reminded me of an alcoholic who repeatedly calls to apologize for behavior he's powerless to prevent.

In the end, the behavior becomes as predictable as it is boring, and as a result, I started to resent Hank's helplessness. It also seemed to be contagious, because every member of the supporting cast was some way, somehow victimized by their own absurdly preposterous foibles.

In the end, the edges were wearing thin and the show had started to edge closer to a parody of itself.

Californication has been granted a third season, and I hope this time around Tom and company focus more on Hank's inner evolution - or devolution - if that works in some ironic way.

The endless - if improbable - sex, drugs, and rock and roll are always good sellers, but character development is far more satisfying.

Where the hell is that wormhole, anyway?",1229904000,70,2164,5.047752808988764
3460435,3,B001AQR39O,"The second season of ""Californication"" had a lot to live up to because the first season was so fabulous. Unfortunately, Season 2 falls pretty short. It picks up right where Season 1 left off, with Hank (David Duchovny) and Karen (Natascha McElhone) back together again. Their happiness is short-lived, however, because Hank accidentally mouth-rapes another woman, gets arrested, and learns that he's impregnated one of the many women he banged during Season 1. Not surprisingly, this is all too much for Karen, so she bails on Hank for the second time. Hank deals with this latest rejection the only way he knows how: drowning his sorrows and sleeping with every woman he crosses paths with. He also befriends a middle-aged rocker, Lew Ashby (Callum Keith Rennie), and agrees to write Lew's biography. Lew is even more childish than Hank, if you can believe that, and the two men get into numerous sticky situations. Meanwhile, Charlie and Marcy go through some serious rough patches due to Marcy's blossoming cocaine addiction and Charlie's venture into the porn industry, which results in an extramarital affair with a young porn actress.

There are definitely some funny moments in Season 2, but overall, it was a major letdown for me. The storylines were way too unbelievable and over the top. There were too many crazy things going on at once, to the point that it all got kind of ridiculous. Also, the Charlie/Daisy storyline really bothered me, and I was disgusted by the changes to Charlie's character this season. I sincerely hope the writers do a better job with Season 3, if there even IS a Season 3. I guess we'll see what happens.",1229212800,16,1643,4.888888888888889

3460579,4,B001AQR39O,"David Duchovny plays a central character who is hard to like but equally hard to dislike. He personifies California decadence of years past and present with great precision. The plot moves quickly with a cast of quirky characters presenting a kaleidoscope of colors and patterns representing hollow relationships. Of special note is Pamela Adlon as ""March Runkle"", who is a constant scene stealer. The shallowness of the series characters remind me of Seinfeld, but each episode has a better and definite storyline that is always hanging around. I gave it four stars since lots of sex is prevalent in each episode but is presented in a frivolous manner.",1472947200,,653,5.055555555555555

This is sex in the city if you took out a few women and slipped in a few men.
Hank is a NY transplant writer in LA, who is basically is a charming cad.  He pretty much says & does what he thinks and it gets him in a bunch of trouble.
He longs for the woman he let go,  who is also the mother of his teenage daughter who is exploring her new boundaries.  Throw in a few crazy friends, sex, drugs, and rock & roll and you have this show.
The thing that makes him lovable is he doesn't lie or say he is something he is not.  Yes, he cheats, he drinks, does occasional marijuana but you end up liking him because you just want to see what he says or do next.  As you watch the show, you will see he has this gravity of bad decisions that pulls the people he loves and other random people into him and away.

I do take issue with one thing in this show and that is the Mia character who is a total sociopath. She steals Hank's life work and pawns it off as her own and has absolutely no conscience about doing this whatsoever. So unfazed that she actually is convinced that she is doing the right thing and probably even more convinced that she wrote the book herself. What is even more irritating is that Hank knows she stole his manuscript but does nothing about it. In fact, he is actually very nice to her and acts like she has done nothing wrong. Maybe I have a penchant for justice for narcissistic jerks with no socially redeeming characteristics and this whole ""taking issue"" thing lies on my shoulders, but that little ordeal really bugs me.

3461387,5,B001AQR39O,"I enjoyed the entire series from start to finish. Hank Moody (David Duchovny) stars as the writer that can't make up his mind if he wants to stay with the love of his life or lead a life of debauchery. He gets hit on and beds dozens and dozens of beautiful women, including more that a few that cause endless problems. He writes a book that becomes a best seller but not under his name. I don't want to ruin the show for you but get ready for lots of bare female breasts, male and female bare bottoms and sex scenes from 1 person to full orgies. There are bar fights, swimming scenes, dream scenes, car wrecks and some top movie actor and musicians actors in some really crazy scenes. The whole series pretty much blew me away. Each episode runs under 30 minutes. There is no foot dragging in the series.",1428537600,,804,4.296052631578948

Was happy to find that Pamela (can't remember her last name...sorry Pam) from the Louis CK show was a cast member as well. She's bare bones honest in her portrayals. Terrific to watch her in action. Sure there's sex but there's also a lot of heart. The writing is exceptionally smart and blows the roof off of that drivel they serve on prime time tv.  Kudos from me.

I appreciate that there is somewhat of a balance between the obscene and the tenderness in Duchovny's character. The episodes are short, just right for washing the dishes, but things develop during each episode. Watch it, you'll like it.",1412121600,,575,4.647058823529412

Hank Moody's life is nothing like my life, thank goodness, but I find him and the rest of the cast and their lives enjoyable to visit.

I actually feel empowered by my past. A player at one time in my past, a want...a desire, to love is stronger than ever. Im not saying that cheating is validated, I'm just saying that real love never dies. Can we as people put aside infidelity. Seems like the pretty people can. Good...Bad.???

3462236,5,B001AQR39O,"This series takes you out of your confort zone big time, to a world that may or may not exist in the supercharged world of the Los Angeles art scene.  David Duchovny is unbelievable as the character of Hank Moody.  He is your sprit guide through all of the craziness and debautchery that California has become, or always was.  We see the world through the eyes of a writer who has seen it all, and yet craves normalcy with his common law wife played to absolute perfection by  Natasha  McElhone along with his daughter played by Madeleine Martin.  Hank careens through this world with reckless abandon with the help of his manager/best friend Charlie played by the incomparable Evan Handler.  Together they try to surf the waves this California life without wiping out too much;Wipe out they do, but always mange to be in some way or another saved by the people they really love.  In other words real life is messy and Californication is showing this world at its absolute messiness.  It's a fantastic series that is now going into its 7th season on Showtime.
The writing by Tom Kampinos for this series is so good the lines just flow and all the Actors involved relish them with wreck less aplomb. I heartily recommend this series for anyone, 19 or older as long as you can get past the vulgarity and see these characters for what they are real people trying to handle unreal circumstances and trying to cope with it all.",1389398400,,1422,4.58893280632411

Not for the sexually timid/repressed...although it may be good therapy for you :-) Although sometimes you want to ring Hank's (Duchoveny) neck and yell ""Dude grow up"". It is his total lack of willingness to do so that keeps the story going. Great supporting characters. Mchelhone as Karen is wonderful, Pamela Adlon and Evan Handler play Marcey and Charlie to the T as a neurotic couple in love (with the one they're with). Best of all is the role of Hank and Karen's daughter Rebecca played by Madeleine Martin. Martins stoic, down to earth yet precocious attitude is delivered impeccably. Karen, Hank, Rebecca come together so well and show how a struggling, neurotic, dysfunctional family can actually find a way to coexist and love each other deeply.",1389139200,,827,4.956834532374101

Does a magnificent character move are every turn.  The love that he has for Karen and Becca and palpable and is so sincere it hurts to  watch him being so vulnerable to the problems that keep slamming at him...
I await all of the problems and how he skates around them....what a doll....even when he pushes the ""broads"" away, they somehow manage to sabotage the moment...and I can appreciate that he is so kind hearted and really makes an attempt to stay out of trouble and it always finds him.

Seasons 1, 3, and 4 come in ""Season Style"" cardboard boxes with separate slender DVD cases. Season 2 is a standard dual-sided single case. However, the differences extend to the DVD.

Pros:
-The discs do not appear to restrict any player functionality. As opposed to seasons 1 & 3, you can skip the Showtime intro/rebate offer and also utilize your DVD players skip functionality throughout.
-The quality is exactly what you would expect and doesn't disappoint.

Cons:
-The bonus features are limited, if you care about that. And there's one episode with commentary featuring Pamela Adlon by herself. Awkward.
-The case feels cheap. But it's just the case.

Relative to the other seasons, I prefer the functionality of these discs (or permissions) and prefer the box-set style of the other seasons packaging. Would still take this, though, to be able to fast forward through the obligatory intros.",1353196800,,1023,4.85632183908046

3462335,4,B001AQR39O,"A few reviewers have opined that the second season isn't as good as the first, and I cannot disagree with them.  However, the quality has gone down just a notch.  I finished the second season enjoying it quite a bit.  It is cleverly written and the actors/actresses are appealing.

Hank Moody has a more stable love life in the second season (I'm trying not to put any spoilers in this review, unlike other reviewers...that is so annoying!), but he continues to be frustrated with temptation after temptation.  His agent has problems of his own; he's patched things up with his wife, but now she comes down with problems of her own.  And his second masterpiece is still hijacked by a former (child) lover...

The writing is snappy and often quite funny.  Hank's daughter Becca is still a cipher, and underplayed in an appealing way by Madeleine Martin (I can't figure out if she's just extremely talented, or if she's just not involved very much in the role).  Mention must be made of Pamela Adlon, who plays Hank's agent's wife, Marcy Runkle.  Pamela is very, very funny, and very, very real.  I watched one of the DVD bonus features, which gives Adlon a chance to comment on one of the episodes.  She doesn't have a lot to add to the information of the episode, but she comes across exactly as she does when she acts in the series.  Her very real acting is almost like not acting at all.  Evan Handler plays Hank's agent Charlie Runkle, who has a few problems of his own.

The result is a very funny comedy that is not safe for children under the age of, say, 25.  It's not a production you are going to chat about with the more prudish members of the family.

But, it is funny and, thanks to the snappy, rapid-fire dialog, a cut above most cable efforts.

Recommended.  Four-and-a-half stars for the second season of 'Californication'.  However, be aware there is very rough language, sexual situations, drug use, and nudity.  But, it's all in (pretty much) good fun, and nobody gets too badly hurt.",1289260800,,2002,4.598870056497175

While this season overall is still good, it is definitely not as funny as the first season. being a girl, I am thankful all the naked tits in the first season got covered up, for the most part, in the 2nd season. It was kinda irritating to me how many times Hank's almost wife (can't think of her name) wants to be with him, then break up with him, then be with him, then break up with him, over and over. That does get old.

3462337,1,B001AQR39O,"This is really a dreadful show.  Hank Moody doesn't have a real job (while seeming to have no financial problems), and attractive women regular throw themselves at him, yet the show expects us to identify with him as a suffering human being.  As far as I can tell, Hank is a middle-aged man with the self-controlled of a ill-behaved twelve-year old boy.  In addition, the characters who surround Hank are just slightly more sympathetic, and most of that would come from having to deal with Hank.  Finally, there's little actual humor in the show.  It's not that I'm being prudish -- there are many things with far stronger sexual content I enjoy -- this is just a real waste of time.  I'm a bit shocked at the largely positive reviews from other Amazon customers -- I can't imagine people would enjoy watching this.",1286496000,,815,4.664335664335664

3462350,4,B001AQR39O,"I was a big fan of the first season of Showtime's raunchy yet surprisingly heartfelt series about the mishaps of gifted but wounded author Hank Moody, but I was suprised at how much better the second season turned out to be.  The action picks up where things ended with the season one finale.  Karen had left her groom-to-be at the altar and jumped in Hank's car instructing him to keep going before she changed her mind.  And so, the second season opens with Hank, Karen and their teenage daughter, Becca, together again and Hank devoted to making things work this time around.

But this is Hank we're talking about, and it doesn't take him long to mess up (albiet accidentally) and the same familiar cycle begins again.  When Karen turns down his marriage proposal, Hank leaves and takes up residence with music producer/man child, Lew Ashby whose biography he is writing.  Ashby shares many traits with Hank, including being haunted by ""the one that got away"", a woman that Lew sacraficed in exchange for his fast paced lifestyle.  He and Hank form a bond out of their shared loneliness and self-destructive behaviors that gives season 2 even more of a bruised heart feel than the first.

Despite the empty place in Hank's heart, and his efforts to change his patterns of behavior, this season is no mere naval gaving mope fest.  Several other plots percolate around our anti-hero.  Becca begins dating, Charlie is fired from his job and becomes involved with an aspiring porn star, his wife succombs to her cocaine addiction again and Hank tracks down the love of Lew's life all while facing the possiblity that he may be a father; and no, Karen is not the mother.  All of these plot threads weave together for a hilarious and moving examination of broken hearts and unrealized dreams.  Plus it's even raunchier than the first season, which is saying a lot.

Ultimately, though, Californication is not just about sex, drugs and fast times.  It is a study of how people use these very things to fill in the empty places left by heartbreak and disappointment. The fact that it is able to convey these things while at the same time being enormously funny and entertaining makes it one of the best shows on tv right now.",1279843200,5,2220,4.702842377260982
3462351,4,B001AQR39O,"I really enjoyed the second season of Californication, but I was disappointed by the lack of extras on the dvds.

3462352,5,B001AQR39O,"My first impression was that Season 2 is not quite as well written as Season 1, but it definitely has a magic all of its own.

My favorite character in Season 2 is the brilliantly nuanced Lew Ashby, played so flawlessly by Anglo-Canadian actor Callum Keith Rennie. Rennie and Duchovny have excellent on-screen chemistry, perhaps partly due to them being friends in real life, having bonded during the making of the second X-Files movie.

The on-off relationship between Hank and Karen, played by 5'10"" actress Natascha McElhone, yields many moving and entertaining moments as Hanky panky fails miserably to resist the temptations of the flesh.

I was disappointed that the interviews did not include more actors, such as the superb Callum Keith Rennie, but the main cast interviews are interesting.

If you liked the first season, you should also like 2 and 3. Duchovny rules.",1278028800,,876,5.020689655172414
3462353,2,B001AQR39O,"Season 2 of this series represented for me a falling off in standard from the first season. The plot gyrations started getting wilder, as if the writers had lost faith in the characters and had to invent more and more outlandish situations to put them in. I also began losing faith, asking myself increasingly why I should care about this group of immature, selfish, self-absorbed and childish characters.

I also grew skeptical of the fact that the ""hero"" only has to look at a gorgeous woman, and the series presents us with an unending line of them, for her to throw herself at him. What's so irresisible about this flabby, stinky, unshaven, gross, cigarette-smoking example of manhood? I just didn't buy it.

In season 2, a music producer possibly even more revolting that Hank recruits our hero to be his biographer. Hank's agent Charlie Runkle goes into porn while his wife becomes a coke addict.

One mystery is the total disappearance of Bill, whom Karen married and abandoned at the end of Season one. Bill's 17-year-old daughter Mia remained a crucial, though creepy presence -- but her father has gone.

One other reviewer comments: ""For all its explicit language and graphic sex, Californication is a compelling character study of a seriously flawed man-child.""

Personally, I now feel as if I've spent enough time in the company of this ""man-child"" and will seek more adult company for my viewing pleasure.",1275177600,4,1419,4.920502092050209

I always thought the episodes went by too fast and I couldn't wait until next week to see the newest one. Then I went broke and lost Sho Time. I waited what seemed like forever on end to be able to buy the second season on DVD. And I was not the least bit disappointed. I will admit, I was worried about that within the first two episodes. It is sad to say this, but Californication is not funny unless Hank is completely self destructive and his life is in the toilet. As his life was going down the toilet once again, I found the episodes to be more and more funnier than the last one. Hank is such a crude a hole. I loved the characters and dialouge. And of course I loved all the crazy misadventures he went through. But what makes the show so great is beneath the sex addiction, crude behavior, less than tactful moments, and the drinking/drug use, Hank is a good, sweet guy. He just uses his cynism so people don't know he is actually a very vulnerable person. I love the writing in this show. I can't wait until I can buy Season Three.",1274227200,,1164,4.247747747747748

3462401,3,B001AQR39O,"The only thing that kept me from giving the second season 4 stars was the writing for the supporting cast, namely Charlie and Marcy. For me, it felt like there was 2 shows...Hank's storyline, which I thought was excellent; and then the Charlie/Marcy show. I'm buying the DVD for the former, could do without the second.

I'm still totally sold on the series namely due to Duchovny. I thought the character development of Hank over the season was excellent (favorite episode was ""In Utero""), and am anticipating what season 3 will be like Hank going back to school and taking care of Becca full-time. These are the two that have sold me on the series. I think their scenes together are stellar, and Hank remains flawed but likeable despite his poor choices. I even enjoyed rascal Lew Ashby and the potential for that character.

But where it fell apart for me was Charlie and Marcy. While it's downright criminal that Dani/Mia got away with ""her book"", I thought Charlie was a total idiot. He deserved to get canned from his job and his life just went down the hole after that. Marcy's storyline was just kind of sad, but I'm hopeful for her recovery in the next season. I hope the writers can get these two back on track, even if apart, watching the trainwreck of their lives is not funny, but more pitiful and sad.

Best writing on TV right now. Totally addictive. The scene with Cokie Smurf and Runkle sporting nothing but his undies and a greasy crab bib was outrageously funny.

3462406,4,B001AQR39O,"There is a pretty dramatic difference between the 1st Season and the 2nd.

The 1st Season of the show was about the existential angst of Hank Moody.  His edgy, angry first novel (and only highly-acclaimed work) has been optioned by Hollywood studios and transformed into a miserably predictable romantic comedy; his former soulmate is set to marry a rich corporate goon; his daughter, mirroring her father, has gone into a dark, teenage funk; and his literary manager, while still Hank's friend, has grown tired of his Hank's inability to produce any substantive work.

In contrast, the 2nd Season is about Hank getting virtually everything that he dreamed of ... he has reunited with his soulmate; he has reestablished a strong relationship with his daughter; he has rediscovered some of his literary mojo. But, ironically, despite all of his wishes coming true, he is still a drowning man because he completely unprepared to take responsibility for getting what he wished for. He is haunted by the choices he made prior to all of his dreams coming true. And the realization that he cannot handle what he wished for causes him to meltdown in numerous ways.

I believe that this season, which maintained some of the wonderfully bizarrre elements of the 1st Season, actually gives us deeper insight into many of the characters and seemed much less episodic. As other reviewers have said, there may be fewer laugh-out loud moments. But there are substantially more moments that make us consider the choices that all of us have to make in regards to careers, romantic relationships (and entanglements) and friendhips.

3462407,5,B001AQR39O,Californication Season 2 was the best TV show of the year. The series is funny and sexy. The cast is terrific. The story is interesting. The dialogue --- between highly intelligent and wildly sexual characters --- veers between insightful and hysterical and is always entertaining. This is not a series for Puritans. This is a smart series for an audience who likes its sex sexy and its dialogue witty.,1251158400,3,402,4.840579710144928
3462408,4,B001AQR39O,"I gave the 2nd season of Californication 4 stars out of 5. I read the reviews that were posted and I will agree that this season isn't as ""good"" as the first season.  The first season gave the audience something they are definitely not used to seeing, the character of Hank Moody.  Despite all the negative that Moody creates, the audience can't help but fall in love with him in the first season.

I don't feel that the 2nd season tried to be as funny as the first. That's what made the 1st season so enjoyable, nonstop laughs in every episode. This season is far more dramatic and has a plot that starts to develop, instead of the sex, drugs, and comedy that season 1 was about. That is why I think people didn't like it as much, because the ""originality"" of the 1st season wasn't duplicated as much; but how long do you think the writers could go with Hank sleeping with random women left and right before it got old. I feel this season shows the development of Hank Moody far better than season 1 had created.

Nontheless, everyone is entitled to an opinion, and if you listen to mine- you'll buy this set and enjoy your purchase...but please don't expect the same tone that season 1 created...I think the show is heading in a better direction",1245110400,31,1247,4.432314410480349

8278711,4,B001AQR39O,"Well this show sets a new bar for raunch and is clearly not for everyone, but what saves it, and keeps me coming back is the writing. Some of the words make me cringe but the darn writing is so clever I find myself laughing out loud nearly every episode.

I had to remind myself that the plot lines are not really based in reality. The feelings the characters express are dead real, but the situations they get into are not all that credible. If you accept the show as a sort of semi-fantasy it will temper your expectations and allow you to enjoy the comedy, the superb acting, and the fairy tale yet highly believable love story that the two lead actors David Duchovny and Natascha McElhone create. It is a joy to witness two people so in love. Their character's love for each have a kind of Romeo and Juliet lilt (or some may say Barbie and Ken).

And what about this David Duchovny person? How dare you look that good in your 40's. How dare you slip into the character of Hank Moody as naturally as a snake sheds its skin. Well I guess I could be envious, jealous, or even bitter, but instead I'll just pray I am you (David or Hank) in the next lifetime.  ....  And by the way, is Duchovny channeling Garry Shandling? His mannerism are often reminiscent of the great comedian and the jokes that come out of his mouth are very Shandling-esk. Which is great. I dearly miss Garry.

EdiT: I would like to add something please... Now that I'm conditioned to the pleasure of the wave of humor that machine guns you non-stop, I am [thankfully] seeing deeper into the series. When you look past the comedy, the hanko-one-liners, the pelting of raunch (also non-stop) you start to realize what an amazing thing Duchovny and Natascha pulled off... in episode after episode. Their dynamic. Their soulmatedness. They did something incredibly rare! They played an actual, believable dysfunctional couple. Now the key word there is believe-able. I believed, again, non-stop, that these two people really were helplessly, haplessly, hopelessly IN LOVE.

ITS THE ONLY POSSIBLE REASON THEY STAYED TOGETHER for that many seasons. Sure the producers wanted as many seasons as possible to milk out the revenue. And yes, they could have fallen back on this incredible on-screen couple just being ADDICTED to each other... staying together as a sort of better-the-devil-you-know kind of thing. But the show rose above that! I am in season 3, and I'm going to continue watching -completely out of character for me- because it is so much fun to witness the love these two fictitious people have for each other (hint: it's ALL fiction at the end of the day).

Stupendous acting. I hope THE ENTIRE CAST, especially the daughter, whose name I am too laze to lookup at them moment, due to having a few glasses of Merlot with the spaghetti dinner. That actress rocks. The whole cast really cast a magical spell. Thanx for this show. I don't love it because of the raunch. Bit in spite of. !!",1505520000,,2966,4.6273764258555135

There are still a number of comedic moments, but not nearly as strong as the first season. Lew Ashby is a fine addition to the cast of characters, in fact, he just might be one of the most interesting characters on the show thus far.

The familial condition of Moodys world is really what keeps this show resonating with some emotional depth but the most maddening problem with the second season is the lack of satirical dark comedy which made the first season such a blast. In its place are predictable, nudity infused little stories of Hank Moody being the man slut that he is, which is not nearly as satisfying and at times, just downright implausible.

The show sadly seems to be taking a turn towards glorifying some of the more sordid traits of the unfiltered male condition and Im also fairly certain, ruffle some feminist feathers in the process.",1502582400,,923,4.615853658536586
