5572551,5,B00BC36YWC,"If you thought Something about Mary was funny then I surmise you will think We are the Millers is hilarious.  The only complaint I have is Ed Helms playing a high level drug dealer was not convincing, they should have cast someone more wicked or believable (any suggestions?).  This movie is rated R for many reasons so I would not accompany anyone under 18.  The story is simple and stupid but aside from being absurd it is a laugh plus some.  This was a movie that has poor ratings from the critics and the general public enjoyed.  A popular website is currently at 80% favorably from 30,000 votes thus far.  This movie is not for those who object to the F bombs or the liberal use of the finger. It is just a joyous ridiculous romp of an adventure that occurs to dysfunctional people who get together because at the time they all have nothing better to do.  Stick around for the outtakes after the movie ends they were an added pleasure to a fairly predictable storyline, still freaking hilarious movie.",1376179200,2,1006,4.524861878453039
5572552,4,B00BC36YWC,"Well, I could have done without seeing the ginger kids uncircumcised penis, aside from that this was a pretty fun movie. Jason Sudeikis is one of these guys who just gets better and better with every film he does. I used to be a hater, but now I'll see anything that he's in, and We're The Millers is his best movie to date. This story is about a local drug dealer who gets in trouble with his supplier, and the only way out is to become a trafficker. Dave Clark (Sudeikis) decides the best way to do this is to recruit a fake family to make it look like they're just on vacation. Clark recruits his neighbor, a stripper, and a local homeless teen to be his fake family complete and the Millers are born. This film is non-stop laughs, as I said earlier Sudeikis was hilarious, but surprisingly so was Jennifer Aniston. There are a lot of knocks against her, especially when it comes to comedy, but whenever Rachel plays a fowl mouthed, raunchy character, I see her in a whole new light, and she was terrific in this film. Will Poulter is another stand out from the film, he's been acting since a very young age, but to my knowledge has never been in a comedy before. Here he plays a loveable geek that would easily fit in with the cast of the Big Bang Theory. Out of all the funny scenes and outrageous moments, it's Poulter's that made me laugh the hardest. Is this the best movie I've ever seen? Not even close, but it's one of those comedies that just keeps coming at you and never stops. While the story is a bit ridiculous, I promise you will still laugh until you're sides hurt, because We're The Millers is the best new comedy I've seen all year.",1376092800,18,1653,4.318327974276527
5572553,4,B00BC36YWC,"Note:  First, this review may have spoilers.  Second, after almost 900 submitted reviews, Amazon's computerized censor rejected my original draft, presumably because they didn't like a word or two.  They don't say what it is that is offensive, so undaunted, I continued to make edits until it passed muster.  The version here is my 4th draft.  I've indicated the changes from the original by using [brackets].  See if you can come up with the original word.  There are no words that begin with the letter ""F"" and all would be familiar to a typical 7th grader.

I read one review that said that no one would buy the premise of Jennifer Aniston being a [ecdysiast]. I assume he's convinced that the 44 year old actress wouldn't look or be able to pull it off. Well, I bought it and trust me there are plenty of 20 year old ladies out there who only wish they had the physical appeal of Ms. A.

Now that that is out of the way, Rose quits her job at the [club where women get undressed] because her boss Todd (Ken Marino) insists that she have sexual relations with interested clients. About to get booted out of her apartment for late rent payments, she runs into a neighbor at the mail box. More on that later. David (Jason Sudekis), the neighbor, is the neighborhood drug dealer whose clientele is mostly businessmen, housewives and professionals. But no kids. Principles you know. He is a [jerk] and basically has no friends but for a recently turned 18 year old from the building named Kenny (Will Poulter).

Hearing a ruckus outside, Kenny confronts a quartet of street thugs who are hassling Casey (Emma Roberts) an up-and-coming tart complete with tats, body piercings and plenty of black leather. David, against his better judgment intervenes, only to have his cash and cache of drugs stolen by the thugs. When he tells his story to his boss (Ed Helms), his only option is to go to Mexico and bring back a huge stash of marijuana under the name of Pablo Chacon. David doesn't know that Chacon is one of Mexico's most ruthless drug lords.

Now back to Rose. David, worried about the border crossing coming back to the U. S. rents a large RV and hires now homeless Rose to act as his wife and Kenny and Casey to play his children. This requires a make-over for all as they must appear to be a suburban family just on vacation. It pretty much works except that the real Chacon is giving chase realizing that his henchmen gave the drugs to the wrong gringo.

This film by Rawson Marshall Thurber and a screenplay by Bob Fisher and Steve Faber has a lot going on for it. It's funny, but this isn't a family friendly film, if your family includes young children. Even adults will get a few eye-openers, so if you're easily offended look elsewhere. The ""R"" rating is well earned. Sure we get to see the inside of a [club where women get undressed], but the filmmakers do pull their punch here in that the ladies actually don't [remove their clothes].

Rose has a great routine well into the film when she must prove she is an [exotic dancer] for Chacon and his cronies. Ms. Aniston has made a career out of gold medal titillation without seeing the... uh... [trophies]. So it is here, but the ""Flashdance"" shower routine provides a stimulating tease. There are some funny scenes with a real All-American family in an RV vacation. Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn play the parents and Molly C. Quinn is the teen daughter.

In what must have been a good news-bad news scenario for actor Poulter, we see his character fumbling the ball on a first kiss opportunity with Ms. Quinn's character, and is given lessons by Casey and Rose in rapid succession. Kenny turns beat red and I don't think it was makeup. Later, he must expose his privates after being bitten on the [testacles] by a large furry spider. While this movie isn't for everyone, I found it funny as [heck].",1376092800,23,3862,4.562138728323699
5572554,4,B00BC36YWC,"""We're the Millers"" (2013 release; 109 min.) brings the story of how David (played by Jason Sudeikis) a small-time drug dealer, gets robbed of his cash and stash one day, and in order to make up for it, his drug lord (played by Ed Helms) orders him to go into Mexico and bring back a ""smidgen of weed"" (which turns out to be hundreds of pounds). David dreams up a disguise, and hires (ex-)stripper Rose (played by Jennifer Aniston) (Rose: ""you can't buy me!"" David: ""I'm not buying you, I'm hiring you!""), Casey (played by Emma Roberts), and Kenny (played by Will Poulter) to be his pretend wife and kids. Off they go in a humongous RV, and as sure as night comes after day, this becomes a road trip from hell. To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: this is one of the better comedies I've see in a long time, one that is actually FUNNY. But beware, it is also quite raunchy, so if that is not your thing, you'll want to stay away (it is rated R for a reasons). Also, this is very much a road movie, and you can't help but make the comparison with Chevy Chase and his ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" movies, and actually ""We're the Millers"" compares quite nicely. The movie contains a bunch of one line zingers that just about had me up in stitches. At one point the whole family is arguing about something and David screams: ""I am Marky Mark and you all are the Funky Bunch! I am the boss"", ha! The movie really hits pay dirt when the Miller family gets to know another family, the Fitzgeralds, with Don and Edie as the parents. Nick Offerman as the 'straight' man is just brilliant. There is, however, one scene in the movie that fell completely flat, namely when Rose has to prove to the bad guys that she once was a stripper, and hence busts out a stripper routine that is straight from Flashdance. I mean, does Aniston really have to do this still? Unnecessary, and not funny.

That aside, this is what I would call 'formulaic Hollywood' at its best: lots of funny scenes, and mindless entertainment from start to finish. The movie ends in a way that we could definitely get another visit on the big screen from the Millers in a few years. To which I say: sign me up! Enjoy, everyone, it's Miller time!",1376092800,,2297,4.402352941176471
5572555,4,B00BC36YWC,"If you happen to be one of the people that have yet to take notice of Jason Sudeikis, it's about high time that you did.  Since joining Saturday Night Live in 2005 (of which he recently departed), he has impersonated a ridiculously long list of celebrities and been a part of countless memorable SNL skits.  Sudeikis also has taken his comedy to the big screen, starring in a handful of popular comedies, including Hall Pass, Horrible Bosses, and A Good Old Fashioned Orgy.  He is certainly a rising star in Hollywood and will continue on with his humorous antics in featured films, most recently of which happens to reunite him with his former Horrible Bosses and The Bounty Hunter cast mate, Jennifer Aniston.  Easily recognizable for her role on the popular television comedy, Friends, Aniston has had a series of lackluster film roles.  Together, Sudeikis and Aniston may have found the formula for success in the outlandish new comedy, We're the Millers.

Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (Dodgeball:  A True Underdog Story), We're the Millers stars Jason Sudikis as David Clark, a small time drug dealer that is forced to travel to Mexico by his boss, Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms), to smuggle a ""smidge"" of marijuana back across the Mexican border into the United States.  In order to present himself as a family man and not draw attention to himself, David enlists the help of a stripper, Sarah (Jennifer Aniston),  a teenager from his building, Kenny (Will Poulter), and a teenage runaway, Casey (Emma Roberts), to pose as his family.  However, David eventually realizes his boss is playing him, which forces the Miller ""family"" on the run from an angry drug dealer from whom they stole a massive amount of drugs.  Nick Offerman, Kathryn Hahn, and Tomer Sisley also star in supporting roles.

This film is definitely Jason Sudeikis' best effort and funniest featured role to date.  More often than not, his sarcastic humor and abusive language are amusing, providing plenty of hilarious encounters with virtually everyone he talks to in the film.  Sudeikis carries this film on his back and sprints across the finish line, and while he deserves a great deal of the credit, the supporting cast is also well-rounded, bringing plenty to the table themselves.  In the beginning, the film is a bit slow-going - but once Will Poulter, Emma Roberts, and Jennifer Aniston enter the fray, the film is off and running.  From the very first scene in which this ""family"" is united, the laughs flow constantly, beginning with an airplane scene that will make you blush, have you laughing at the top of your lungs, and leave you begging for air - and that's just within the first 20 minutes.  Other memorable scenes include Will Poulter's interaction with a venomous spider, Poulter's make-out scene with both Jennifer Aniston and Emma Roberts, and also Jennifer Aniston's heavily advertised stripping scene.  While the stripping scene is roughly the same exact scene that's shown in film's movie trailer, the big deal about it is that this particular scene was used to attract movie-goers (mostly young men) to the film - and odds are it's going to work pretty well.

True enough, We're the Millers is extremely hilarious - but unlike a few recent comedies, like This Is The End or The Heat, We're the Millers lacks a sensible plot.  The storyline of the film basically follows a Dumb & Dumber style ""road trip across American"" plot, which makes for some good humor, but bad for anyone looking for thematic, meaningful substance.  This is probably the nicest way of saying the story is stupid, and portrays situations based on the premise of sex, drugs, and complete nonsense.  However, the lack of plot substance is hardly noticeable if you're amused by the style of humor, which was written by Bob Fisher and Steve Faber - both known for scripting Wedding Crashers.  Like the nicely written interactions between Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, the Miller ""family"" is not as good, but still written with just enough chemistry to be believable (as a family) and ridiculous at the same time.

We're the Millers is one of the rare occasions when you should absolutely feel free to ignore most critics and just go with your gut if you think you might be interested in seeing the film.  The majority of critics can look down upon this film all they want and trash it until they're blue in the face.  But, if you happen to see this film with a large a crowd, take notice of nearly every single person up and down the aisles crying from laughter.  It's definitely a sign these disconnected hags have a stick up their ""you know what"" and need to lighten up.  Still, this isn't the first time an absolutely hilarious comedy is vilified by critics and it certainly won't be the last.

Overall, We're the Millers is easily the funniest movie of the year, but it's not the best comedy of the year.  Laughs don't always translate to high marks, since there has to be some plot substance - which this film lacks.  Regardless, this film is still worth your time if you want some good laughs.  Obviously, like many other R-rated comedies out there, if you're offended by explicit sexual humor or if you can't handle hearing the F-bomb a hundred times in one sitting, you'll positively hate this movie and everything for which it stands.  On the other hand, if you're pretty laid back and can handle the sexually explicit derogatory remarks and are in need of a good comedy, then you are in for the time of your life.

5572556,5,B00BC36YWC,"Here's a great idea: Create a fake family to smuggle a large amount of pot from Mexico in their family RV. No one would suspect THEM! And these poor simpletons end up with enough marijuana in their vehicle to kill Willie Nelson.

This is one of the funniest (and most profanely vulgar) movies I have seen in a long time. Yes, it's predictable but we were surprised and delighted at every twist and turn along the way. Director Rawson Marshall Thurber (""Dodgeball"") made each actor genuinely attractive. I have never found Sudeikis or Aniston so appealing, while Roberts impressed me with her comic timing, and Poulter is in a league of his own.

Here are the amateurs (and the professionals):
  * Jason Sudeikis (""Horrible Bosses"") is an amateur smuggler; in real life he's a low-end pot dealer, a holdover from his college days.
  * Jennifer Aniston (""Wanderlust"") is an amateur smuggler; in real life she's a professional stripper. The choreography for her dance is clever.
  * Emma Roberts (""Hotel for Dogs"") is an amateur smuggler; in real life she's a street kid who robs newspaper vending machines.
  * Will Poulter (""Son of Rambow"") is an amateur smuggler, in real life he's a dorky student whose mom left for groceries ...last Tuesday. (This actor is British!)
  * Ed Helms (""The Hangover"") is a professional drug kingpin who isn't above a ""smidge"" of lying and cheating. He's so rich he bought an orca, just because he could.
  * Nick Offerman (Lots of TV) is a vacationer in a huge RV just like the one our ""family"" uses.
  * Kathryn Hahn (Lots of TV) is his wife.
  * Luis Guzmn (""The Count of Monte Cristo"") is a federale who is just looking for a bribe...sorta...

This silly (but funny) set-up has some deplorable moments with blink-and-you'll-miss-it male nudity, crass humor, lots of profanity, two or three gunshots, no blowie uppie stuff, and a laugh a minute.  Oh...and a tarantula!

Hot Toasty Rag, June 11, 2017

Whatever contract Jennifer Aniston signed that wound her up in the unequivocal flop Just Go with It must have tied her to this piece of trash. Granted, I actually sat through the entire movie, so it is better than her Adam Sandler creation.

The premise is terrible. If Jennifer Aniston hadnt been in it, I never ever would have seen it. The tagline: A veteran pot dealer creates a fake family as part of his plan to move a huge shipment of weed into the U.S. from Mexico. Included in the fake family is a stripper as the mother, a runaway girl, and a teenage virgin boy. I have a problem with this. The label virgin is an insult now? This teenage boy has to act like an imbecile, just because he isn't worldy wise? And for that matter, not having sex doesnt make you unwordly, just as having sex doesnt bestow you with common sense. During one scene, the family is listening to the radio, and a rap song starts. The idiotic virgin starts rapping along. He knows all the lyrics, and the rest of the family is awed and impressed. Its supposed to be funny, but I found it offensive and even racist.

If you like really stupid, off-color comedies that basically promote drug use, you might find this funny. Just one last question: who told Jennifer Aniston it was a good idea to play a stripper?

Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to  the drug content, I wouldnt let my kids watch it.",1497225600,,1486,4.428571428571429

I loved it! It's one of those movies that leave you feeling...happier? Yes, happier. It will lift your spirit up a bit. This vid has been out for a years, I was busy and only caught parts of it. It became available on one of my Amazon channels, So I watched it.  Here's a summary:

This small time pot dealer gets robbed. All of his inventory and cash...GONE. The Crime Boss is not happy AT ALL. The Boss gives our protagonist a choice: go get a shipment and bring it back, or he's worm food. AND, THE PICK-UP IS IN MEXICO. Our hero decides to try the boarder...as a father of a family. But, he has to create them first! So, a petty drug dealer, a stripper, a nasty little street girl, and the young man? Well, he's been abandoned; his mother left and never came back. Kinda pitiful. You can just tell he's a good kiddo. All of them hop into a RV and the adventure of a lifetime begins.",1495584000,2,1059,4.086538461538462

5573040,5,B00BC36YWC,"This is one funny movie. One of the best laughs I've had in awhile. Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis showed great chemistry on the set and played their parts very well. Another thing I enjoyed was witnessing the development of actress Emma Roberts. Most remember her from her 2004 cameo on Nickelodeon's hit show Drake and Josh, but show has shown great improvement since then. I've always enjoyed director Rawson Marshall Thurber's style of humor ever since he directed ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"". Some of the film is a bit vulgar and meant for a more mature audience, so be careful of your younger children watching this without parental supervision.",1476748800,,663,4.981981981981982

The drug lord offers him a deal to do a drug delivery to Mexico, and the guy accepts.  He knows that if he has a cheesy fake family he will get through the border easier, so he hires a stripper, an overly enthusiastic kid, and a homeless girl to pretend to be his family.  They have a toad trip in an RV and run into all kinds of humorous situations.  The movie is raunchy, funny, and has lots o actors pop in and out of it.

5573347,5,B00BC36YWC,"This is my new favorite movie! The best way I can describe it is, a drug dealer convinces a homeless girl, a nerdy boy, and a stripper to go on  a road trip to Mexico to pick up a shipment of marijuana, pretending to be a happy, middle class, middle-America family. There is violence, foul language, partial nudity, extensive drug references, and sexual content (not explicit). With that said, this is a feel-good romp, with larger-than-life characters and a solid message of what makes a true ""family"".

5573607,4,B00BC36YWC,"I actually thought that I would have a love/hate with this movie... Four stars sounds right for this film, which I just saw last night. 1 star being 'unbearably bad and difficult to sit through', and 10 being 'so good it changed my life', this movie was bearable to sit through, not painfully bad, but well... predictable and brainless. I WISH the storyline was a wee bit better, but the good news, I saw it in the right frame of mind- not in the mood to think. Clich characters, unoriginal jokes, and predictable story notwithstanding, the pull of the movie were the four main stars, especially Jason Sudeikis. I haven't followed him in SNL but every other role I've seen of his: ""30 Rock"", ""Portlandia"", and a few other appearances here and there- the guy is funny and charismatic. I think Jen is also good, like it's possible for her to be anything BUT... She is kind of fantastic!",1454284800,2,884,4.566037735849057

5573610,4,B00BC36YWC,"It is an okay movie with quite a few laughs. Some audiences might be offended at times. Jason Sudekis and Jennifer Aniston are great as a drug dealer and the stripper who disguise themselves as a couple with teenage children. Will Poulter is British and plays an American teen so well that you can't get over his actual speaking voice in the outtakes, bloopers, and behind the scenes features. Emma Roberts (Julia's niece and Eric's daughter) does very well as the runaway teen. As a family, they are plenty of laughs as they board a plane from Denver to Tuscon and drive an RV to Mexico for a drug smuggling operation.

There are plenty of laughs along the way. We didn't need the scene with Luis Guzman blackmailing the family for sex or a 1,000 pesos. I enjoy Luis Guzman (Code Black) but he deserved better and so did the audience. I enjoy the supporting cast such as Ed Helms, Kathryn Hahn, Will Offernan, and others along the way. The film is pretty entertaining at times. The DVD offers plenty of extras for the audience. When I bought a DVD lately, they usually leave out special features more these days.

So I thought ""why not"" . David is your typical small time drug dealer , smart mouth , bad attitude , at first but at the end you realize he cares about the 3 people he hired to help smuggle drugs across the border . The real show stealer is Kenny , from his goofy overall look to his naive personality . He's like the lovable nerd . Great acting and when he raps TLC's song . . . I lost it , so funny .

I can't stand her, but this is one of the movies where she doesn't play that awkward fakey friends role she is seems stuck in even in real life.  I am now convinced it is safe to spend money and rent Cake next. Good job, Jen. Funny movie, with unexpected humor.  Only downside to seeing it on cable is not hearing enough of the language, which I feel would add a lot to the humor if I knew what they were saying.
Movie was surprisingly good and was happy to see Nick Offerman and SNL's Kathryn Hahn.",1453593600,,735,4.161971830985915

Pretty insane, right?! I sort of felt like this movie was a combination of National Lampoons meets Harold & Kumar. I won't spoil the ending but I can definitely say you'll spend a lot of time watching this movie laughing your full head off! I can't say there have been many movies lately that have made me laugh out loud but I can definitely say there were parts of this movie that made be chuckle. This movie definitely isn't appropriate for kids under the age of 13 but if you can sneak away to watch it is definitely worth your time!

Misadventures of a drug deal gone bad and the fake family that is trying to get past the American border patrol at the mexican border...  Honestly, I've watched this movie several times and laugh out loud every time I have watched it. I felt it was worth a few bucks to own.  I think Jennifer Aniston doesn't get enough credit for being pretty funny on her own, although I am not her biggest fan... I also recommend Horrible Bosses 1 and 2 (on the line of Hangover), and if you're an Aniston fan - Wanderlust.  So that gives you a hint at my sense of humor.  Movie reviews are ALL subjective, so hate gently if you have to.  If you're concerned or into it... there are a lot of drug references, sex conversations and mild nudity. Probably not ok for those under 13... but again... just my opinion!",1435536000,,850,4.451612903225806

5574103,5,B00BC36YWC,"The story line is far fetched, but the actors pull it off very well indeed. Their excellent effort kept this entertaining and funny when it could have fallen into a violent drug story. Jennifer Aniston was brilliant. I say the same of Will Poulter who kept up a solidly done character of dumbstruck honest innocence. The other four major players were also very, very good at their parts, but I put Aniston and Poulter well out in front.
This is understandably rated R, but with language more crude than disgusting. The other R reason was use a scene showing Kenny's (Poulter) injured genitals.
The outtakes and special features were interesting, too. They are worth watching.",1435190400,,675,4.878260869565217

Realizing families are least likely to be searched at the border, David gets his boss to supply a huge RV, and talks a dorky neglected teen (Will Poulter), a homeless goth girl (Emma Roberts), and his stripper neighbor (Jennifer Aniston) into traveling with him - hence The Millers, the squeaky-clean, all-American family just driving home from their Mexican vacay.  But the border proves to be the least of their worries when the ""smidge"" of weed ends up being two metric tons - and when they also learn they inadvertently stole their valuable cargo, thanks to David's boss, from the real drug kingpin!  We're the Millers is foul-mouthed, cynical, over-the-top nuts ... and also very funny and fairly terrific.  There's even a little heart, under all its sardonic sense of humor, and you can't ask for more than that.  (from sixtysecondcinema.blogspot.com)",1425859200,,1071,4.927777777777778

5574451,5,B00BC36YWC,I thought this was a great movie.  It was funny and I love Jennifer Anniston.  The only issue I had was that I received a bad DVD that stopped playing about 60% of the way through the movie.  I was able to finish the movie using the second DVD that was the extended version that came in the set.  Amazon did a GREAT job getting me a replacement out without any hassel and they did it fast.,1423872000,,389,4.012987012987013

We're The Millers was WAY better than I ever expected it to be. I don't know if it was hilarious but it was most definitely funny.

Great character developments, genius of a movie script, beautifully shot especially the night scenes, the color just appears very pleasing.  I don't recall this movie being talked about when it was in the theatre but it's a joy - Never laughed out loud so hard for a long time.  Definitely a comedy for the whole family - A Family movie.

I'm not one for ""stupid"" comedies, and found that this comedy was clever and utterly funny all the way through, so I was not disappointed. The four actors/actresses played off eachother very well. Their timing was superb and the jokes were dirty and funny at the same time. Having said that, the movie was also warm and showed how the group bonded across the film as a family. And the outtakes were great! I'd enjoy owning this and watching it over with friends who've not seen it yet. I know they'd laugh and I'd like to see them do so. I recommend this for those looking to have a whimsical chuckle with nothing too deep, but smartly done.

5574736,3,B00BC36YWC,"I was disappointed with this movie. I thought that it was going to me funnier then it was. I also found myself getting bored with it. This is about a small time drug dealer, a stripper, a young boy and a teenage runaway girl. The young boy is the neighbor to the drug dealer. He see the girl getting attacked by these other group of men. He goes and tries to protect this young girl, which he also likes her. The young men start beating up on the boy. The dealer see what is going on and tries to help the young boy. The two of them start to run from them and they get ambrushed. The dealer has a duffle bag on him which has the drugs and money in it. The money gets take along with the drugs, so he goes and tells the main boss. His boss makes a deal with him. He has to go to Mexico and pick up  a shipment for him and he'll pay him. Plus it will make up for what was taken. So he has to come up with a plan on how to get the weed and get it  back here in the states without getting caught. He sees this RV and decides that what he'll do. That he will pretend to have a family. He gets the young boy and the girl and he ask Jennifer Aniston to the mom. They make into Mexico and get to the area that they are to pick the drugs in. What they didn't know is that it was a large shipment that they were picking up. After the shipment is picked up and they head out they start having all sorts of problems. They get stopped by the Mexican Police officer, which is crooked. He wants money. All sorts of things happen to them as they come back to the states, One event after another happened to them. In the end he does get the money and he turns in his main boss.",1415664000,,1660,3.865102639296188

Usually I am one of those people that wants to watch the longer director version but in the case of Millers here the theatrical version is the better one. The jokes end when they are funny, some of the fluff that is cut out really was fluff and you don't miss it. The characters are good if not by the end a bit lovable and you are kind of rooting for them in the end, pretty much basic rom-com fair, though if you like that, as I do, then it works out in the end.

5574924,4,B00BC36YWC,"Starring the sexy Jennifer Aniston (as the stripper and wife), Jason Sudiekis (as drug dealer and husband), Emma Roberts (as the runaway girl and daughter) and Will Poulter (as the innocent guy next door and son). Directed by Rawsn Marshall Thurber, Produced by Chris Bender, Vincent Newman and Tucker Tooley. Distributed by Warner Bros

Storyline: David Clark (Jason Sudeikis), a small time drug dealer in Denver, gets robbed by a group of hooligans when he tries to save Cassey (Emma Roberts) from an eve teasing act. In order to repay this money to his drug supplier Brad, he is forced into a major drug smuggling activity from Mexico, for which he is offered a huge remuneration. David agrees to this deal. He hires Rose (Jennifer Aniston) his neighbor and stripper in a bar as his wife, Cassey as his daughter, Kenny (Will Poulter) his neighbour as his son and plan out a fake vacation in Mexico to get the drugs smuggled in a caravan, into USA. He makes this possible by creating fake identities under the family name Millers. How he does that the hilarious events that take place during his journey is what the movie is all about. In the end, David gets caught by the police and turns as an approval for he falls in love with his fake family. Brad gets arrested. David adopts his new family and continues to live with his new family somewhere in the outskirts of Denver under the same family name.the Millers, until he is cleared from the drug dealing case until the next six months.

A hilarious comedy once again from Hollywood with some delicious skin shows by Jennifer Anniston as stripper. Nice screenplay and the choice of Mexico for drug dealing and events following, is well justified. All characters were cleanly fit into their roles except for Brads over action sometimes. Emma Roberts was at her best and most beautiful in this movie. But for some adult things here and there, the movie is a complete family entertainer that can be viewed by all ages over a weekend. And definitely a must add to their video library for repeated viewings.

5574964,4,B00BC36YWC,"This comedy did not get very good reviews, though it did turn a decent profit: reportedly it cost $37 million and had grossed $150 million by November 2013].  The two best-known actors are Jennifer Aniston and Ed Helms.

The plot: a small-time marijuana dealer gets in trouble with his boss when three guys rob him of all his money and drug supply.  [Dealer: played by Jason Sudeikis.  Boss: played by Ed Helms, with great relish].  Boss tells him the only way he can redeem himself for all that lost money is to take himself down to Mexico and pick up a shipment of some extra-good stuff.  In fact, hell even pay him $100,000.00 for the job.

Suspicious [with good reason], David Clark [Jason Sudeikis] decides the best way to not get caught at the border is to look like a typical, middle-class tourist family.  He manages to persuade a strip-dancer who just quit her job (that would be Jennifer Aniston), a homeless teenage girl, and a rather un-parented adolescent male neighbor to all pose as his family: THE MILLERS!

Along the way to Mexico and back, needless to say many things go wrong.  It turns out his boss has him intercepting a big delivery meant for a Mexican drug lord, so they soon have the drug boss and his henchmen looking to kill them.  And, considering the circumstances, can they really trust Daves boss not to kill them all if they actually deliver the goods?  And unexpectedly, another Average American Family in an RV that they meet along the way turns out to have a dad who works in the DEA [gulp!] giving us simultaneously the fear that theyll all be busted, and a potential salvation from both bosses.

This plot gives plenty of opportunity for laughs, and the movie doesnt miss very many of them.  Incestuous interests between people who are not related at all; Jennifer Aniston doing a strip-tease act and a lap dance; plenty of funny one-liners, and romantic interests of varying kinds.  Jennifer Aniston, formerly dubbed Americas sweetheart, is getting a little bit older andlets face itshe has also appeared in some pretty bad films.  Aniston as the mythic stripper with a heart of gold was certainly a new look for her, and she really pulled it off very well.  Sudeikis, an actor I didn't know, also handled his role with aplomb, and in fact pretty much all the acting was good [Helms, I must admit, being the biggest scene stealer of them all].  I give this movie a solid B: it is actually fairly tame comedy despite the plot, and I got a good number of laughs out of it.",1409529600,,2507,4.595505617977528

5575107,4,B00BC36YWC,"I saw ""We're the Millers"" in the movie theater, the big loud freezing (AC is nice but should one's nose be cold?) expensive ($9.50 in my small town) movie theater. And I came away thinking, that was cute, but it was just okay. You expect a lot when you make the effort and pay the money for a movie theater experience.

Flash forward to last night when I watched it in my nice quiet living room, on the huge flat screen TV, with a nice soft throw and a nice cold drink, and zero expectations other than a pleasant few hours...and I LOVED it. It's a well-written and very well-acted, tight and funny comedy with a wonderful message: family is a very wonderful thing.

Jason Sudekis is lovable in his schlumpy, wise-ass slacker drug dealer role, Jennifer Anniston is strong and excellent, the rest of the acting is great also. I bet it was fun to make, as evidenced by the very funny outtakes at the end.

For those here who say there was too much profanity, these are rough people who are only pretending to be a mainstream, pure as the driven snow, Leave it to Beaver family. It was important when they are shown in their rough lives (stripper, drug dealer, runaway) and is funny when they are sweet pure Millers and the F bombs (and middle fingers) fly. I wouldn't change a single word.

Recommendation: Definitely. 2 thumbs up. I'd watch it again! Sweet and funny.",1406332800,,1366,4.473895582329317

The street drug dealer made it look a little too easy, wandering to soccer mom's and restaurant cooks, ignoring the risk of jail.

Sorry for the bashing, but I have teens/ tweens and know what the message would be received.  In the end, it tried to be a ""feel good"" movie about individuals wanting to be a family and care about each other.

A long-time drug dealer (Jason Sudeikis) has to create a fake family (including Jennifer Aniston as a stripper) to move a huge shipment of weed into the U.S. from Mexico. Unsurprisingly it goes wrong and weird.

What did I think?

I can't quite say its bad but its a little sad that the best laugh is actually a prank in the credits. Its a pretty run-of-the-mill comedy and despite the quirkiness of the plot, the promised potential never quite eventuates. In fact the characters end up cliched and the whole thing becomes mundanely predictable.

It features good acting and even a minor surprise or two but the laughs are a little lacking. Overall its okay-ish but wait for the DVD if you must see it.",1403913600,,719,4.59375

5575207,5,B00BC36YWC,I am so honored to own this comedic gem. One of THE most laugh out loud funniest movies I have ever seen. I don't really want to spoil this for anyone who has not yet seen it because it is good. I know saying this is not much of a review but trust me: This is one fun ride. The entire cast is perfect and there is not a dull moment in this!,1403740800,,340,3.671232876712329

5575209,5,B00BC36YWC,"Laugh-out-loud funny!  The ""son"" Kenny steals the show.  One of the funniest movies Jennifer Aniston has been in! You will watch it again and again!",1403740800,,148,4.88
5575210,4,B00BC36YWC,"WE'RE THE MILLERS shocked me. . .and in a good way.  Just the premise of this flick will bring a smile to your face:  A down-on-his-luck small drug dealer concocts a ""family"" for cover to smuggle a couple tons of pot out of Mexico in an RV--allegedly to receive a massive payday from a less than scrupulous kingpin.  His family consists of a stripper, a homeless teen, and a nerd neighbor.  En route the ""Millers"" encounter the full gambit of adventures, from running for their lives from Mexican mobsters, to a laugh-out-loud spider bite, to attracting the attention of a straight-laced family headed by none other than a DEA Agent.  This movie gets up and moves, takes no prisoners in its presentation of locker room humor, and is it ever fun to watch.  And as a bonus, we even receive a small dose of sentimental feel-good fuzzies.

This is the first feature I can recall where Jason Sudeikis plays the lead, and here he aptly carries the freight as the stressed out con trying to hold his ""family"" together; and I've been an unabashed admirer of Jennifer Aniston's penchant for raunchy comedy since her sensational performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horrible-Bosses/dp/B004EPZ08E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horrible Bosses</a>.  Emma Roberts and a very funny Will Poulter play the Miller ""children""; Ed Helms is grand fun in a small role as Brad Gurdlinger the Drug Lord; yet Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn steal the show as the Fitzgeralds, the square pants couple with a delicious flair to go on the wild side.  Yes, there are hokey and lame moments (e.g., Aniston's strip dance in front of the Mexican mobsters), but if you're looking for a very adult comedy that pulls no punches, WE'RE THE MILLERS is the latest installment of an impressive string of recent comedies with a much decided edge.

5575213,3,B00BC36YWC,"Having lost his employers money, a small-time drug dealer David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) is forced to smuggle marijuana from Mexico. Trying not to look suspicious, David quickly concocts a fake family The Millers with a local stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston), a runaway girl named Casey (Emma Roberts), an 18-year-old neighbor Kenny (Will Poulter). But Davids brilliant plan goes awry when a smidgen of marijuana turns out  well, not really a smidgen.

Were the Millers is directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, best known as the director of a Vince Vaughn/Ben Stiller comedy Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. In his latest work the director obviously aims for something sweeter and even more heart-warming with the story that centers on a series of silly jokes and one-liners.

The result is a mixed bag. Jokes are hit and miss, not surprisingly, but what is more important is that while the four leading players are all fine, convincing as members of a makeshift family that starts to look like a real one, the film itself suffers from an uneven pace. Storytelling sometimes feels slack. You think something big is going to happen when the film misses the chance and goes on to the next joke.

Were the Millers is more like a road movie (like Little Miss Sunshine with sillier jokes and premise. It is an enjoyable ride, but the film could be better with more focus on the eponymous dysfunctional family.",1403308800,2,1402,4.90295358649789

The part where the young girl (playing the daughter) is teaching the  young man (playing the son) how to kiss is hilarious, especially when she tells him ""good job, now choke me a little"".

5575331,5,B00BC36YWC,"Silly premise but it delivers. in every way. goofy looking kid may be best part about movie (other than stripping scene by Anniston- no spoilers, it shows you in trailer) and easily one of the 3 best comedies of the year",1399593600,,220,4.390243902439025

5575385,4,B00BC36YWC,"While this movie wasn't necessarily a stand out by any means, it's certainly worth watching.  I personally am not a fan of Jennifer Aniston and probably never would have seen this movie without my wife ordering it... but I must say, this seemed like the most comfortable role I've ever seen her in.  * And no, I'm not just saying that because she shows a lot of skin... which I'm sure is enough motivation for some.

The movie itself has a solid group of entertaining characters, and while they may not exactly thrive together as actors... that's really the point of their characters, and why it works.  Sure there are some gaps in the story line that don't really make sense, but in this type of movie, logic doesn't really have a place.  Instead, it does precisely what its supposed to do... make you laugh.

Enjoy.",1398729600,,817,4.561643835616438

5575393,3,B00BC36YWC,"So being a typical guy, of course my main objective for watching this movie was to see Jennifer Aniston and her ""dancing"".  That said, this movie was a typical comedy farce that was very predictable.  The scenes with the other RV couple in the tent were quite funny as was when the ""son"" got bit by a huge spider on his family jewels and then showed the family.  There were a couple of funny parts, but also there were parts that were just too over the top for me and trying to hard for a laugh.  I would recommend seeing it at least once, but that's all I'll watch it.  The story is just too far fetched for my personal taste.",1398556800,,627,4.148760330578512

5575412,5,B00BC36YWC,"If you're in the mood for a good laugh, this movie won't let you down.. This is a funny feature with a good mixture of comedy, raunch, slapstick and no question hilarity.. The scenarios that will keep you on your toes and you will definitely not lose interest. These characters are completely unfiltered and surprisingly the humpor goes well with scenes that are beyond inappropriate, but the kind that won't disappoint. There were many parts in the movie that kept me laughing because it's not at all predictable..something we're all tired of, predictability. The movie has some excellent actors such as Jason Sudeikis, who plays a pot dealer named David and has higher aspirations for his future.. Jennifer Aniston, plays Rose, a stripper and she doesn't seem too happy with her job and the new features her boss plans to add to the club she works in.. from there we have Emma Roberts, Casey, a runaway who is homeless.. and a surprising new twist with a brand new guy who will keep you in stitches, because he's actually the funniest character in the movie, His name is Will Poulter, he plays Kenny, a lonely boy who lives in the same apartment building that Jason's character has to somewhat deal with. David isn't the kind who likes to socialize a great deal with anyone that he doesn't have to..He has some issues he's in the midst of making plans of taking care of. Along the lines comes Ed Helms character, a huge drug lord who has a large surprise for David ..The list continues on with quite the realm of characters who will scare you, make you laugh,things you will figure out as you move along in the movie... You definitely won't bore.. The movie takes you on a few trips out of town.. Rent, buy, no matter what you choose, you won't regret and have fun..There is some nudity and the language is spicey, to say the least. You be the judge, enjoy!!",1398297600,,1860,4.588588588588588

5575506,4,B00BC36YWC,"The ghosts of Apatow and the Farrelly brothers - wait, are they even dead? - must look on with favor at We're the Millers, a descendant of that which they'd wrought, the modern-day raunchy comedy. We're the Millers flaunts that ""Rated R"" tag for ""crude sexual content, pervasive language, drug material, and brief graphic nudity."" To which I say, bring it! Some days I'm of a mood for high-falutin' Merchant Ivory cinema. And other days I like to get dirty and wallow in bad taste and later on indulge in self-flagellation. Uh, that's the act of severely criticizing oneself, by the way. Anyway, We're the Millers sates my occasional craving for low-brow humor.

In Denver David Clark (Jason Sudeikis), weed merchant since college, still ekes out a livelihood as a strictly small-time pot dea1er. When a disappointing crisis of conscience compels him to step in on some good samaritan kick, David ends up getting rolled by a bunch of thugs. Now short on stash and cash and suddenly owing his supplier (an unctuous Ed Helms) a debt of $43,000 his only way out is to smuggle a smidge (maybe a smidge and a half) of marijuana from Mexico and across the states during the 4th of July weekend. By the way, how do you know Ed Helms is unctuous? Guy's got a freakin' orca in his office tank.

David needs a cover that'll pass muster with the border checkpoints. And what's more inconspicuous than a dopey family motoring around in a ridiculous RV? And look, there's David now, having recruited a fake family composed of his neighbors - that mean stripper Rose (Jennifer Aniston) and the 18-year-old goof Kenny (Will Poulter) - and also surly runaway teen Casey (Emma Roberts). No, the Swiss Family Robinson they ain't. And, south of the border, David promptly demonstrates that he's not so savvy in the risky world of big league narc0tics trafficking. It's like a Griswold vacay gone ever more horribly wrong.

I laughed so hard. And when I'm left busting a gut that frequently, I tend to forgive the mishmashed plotting and the caricatured treatment of the cast and the occasional bouts of trying too hard. We're the Millers isn't for everyone. It's offensive on a gross level. F-bombs are dropped with such abandon, The Wolf of Wolf Street is looking over its shoulder. It's lewd and even perverted and explores some genuinely uncomfortable territory that onetheless pays off with laugh-out-loud moments.

Jason Sudeikis is a subversive leading man; he's the least likable character here. He grew on me, though, with his unconventional charm and his on-point comedic timing. After all these years, Jennifer Aniston is still mostly recognized as Rachel Green from Friends. And, sometimes, carrying around that baggage of sweet and wholesome is a detriment to a film career. Aniston's been able to surmount that here and there. She's a blast in these R-rated comedies because she always fully commits. And she seems right at home tossing them f-bombs. And if you yet harbor that ever dimming hope of Jennifer Aniston someday going starkers onscreen, well, keep floating that hope, brother. Here, she's a stripper who doesn't really.

I like Emma Roberts, but she's wasted in this movie.

Will Poulter is a born scene-stealer. There's something oddly lovable about him. This kid is one to watch.

At the end, We're the Millers couldn't stick with the program, couldn't keep it as subversive as, say, Bad Santa. An inopportune necessity in plot has the Millers capitulating to formula as they first bicker and mock and can't stomach each other... but maybe one shouldn't dismiss the uniting properties of ""Waterfalls"" by TLC. You know the minute the contentious lot starts singing in harmony over a radio song, it's all over but for the group hug and possibly someone running in the airport (no, there's no airport running here).

It's worth it to stick around for the end-of-movie bloopers reel.",1396656000,,3887,4.905631659056317

5575510,1,B00BC36YWC,"I bought the blu-ray for a couple of reasons.  Jennifer Aniston and the overall Amazon customer 4 star ratings.  I normally find the customer ratings to be pretty close to my own thoughts on a movie, but not this time.  Jennifer is the one bright spot in the movie, and I was actually glad to see her take on a role that has her playing a seedy, foul-mouthed stripper because it's such a departure from her normal characters.  She managed to make the best out of a very bad script, but even Jen couldn't rescue this train wreck.  The premise of the movie should have made for a funny-as-hell flick, but between the unbelievably bad script, and the poor acting done by Jason Sudeikis, it just falls flat.  It's not the profanity that the script is laced with that bothers me (when used right, profanity can make a movie funnier, but in this turkey it's just gratuitous), nor is it the constant sexual innuendo that peppers the movie.  It's ""R"" rated and none of that was either unexpected or offensive.  It's just not funny. The best moment of the movie is in the outtakes that are shown just before the credits roll when, apparently unbeknownst to Aniston, the director plays the theme song to ""Friends"" and the other cast members, who were in on the joke, sing along.  If, like me, you're tempted to eject the disc halfway through, at least skip to the end to catch that outtake.  Beyond that, though, there's not much to recommend this unfortunate movie.

Obviously, most of the people who watched it liked it alot more than I did.  I wouldn't sit through this thing again for anything less than a thousand bucks.  It was that painful.",1396483200,,1637,4.546075085324232

5575553,4,B00BC36YWC,"We're the Millers is an enjoyable and funny movie.  The plot of the movie is about a drug dealer who tries to help a neighbor and all his cash and stash is stolen. In order to make things right with his boss he agrees to smuggling marijuana across the border.  He hatches a plan that he feels has the highest likelihood of success and that is to be a innocent looking dorky RV family. He recruits his broke stripper neighbor (Aniston), his geeky landlords son, and a girl off the streets as his family with comedic results.

Because it is a film about drug smuggling you see a lot of pot and there are many references to pot throughout.  However, there is no drug use in the film.  There is adult language, mature sexual content (strippers, swingers, anal sex etc), brief nudity, mild violence, and drug smuggling. The mature content is funny and or/crude but not over done. Much of the adult content is implied rather than shown. The nudity is of the young boy after a mishap with no sexual overtones.  The themes are introduced for laughs and are not explored in depth or meant to be taken seriously. The film is mild but is intended for mature audiences. Rated R",1396137600,,1165,4.471698113207547

5575604,3,B00BC36YWC,"This movie had me busting up like Marty's Dad in ""Back to the Future"" a few times, but the story is total doo doo and the writers of this film were well aware of that.

That's why they called up the one Offerman who could make it work, Nick Offerman and the right woman, Kathryn Hahn. Jason Sudoku and Jennifer Anniston are not interesting. I know that they are popular, but I don't think it is because they are necessarily funny. People give these two a pass, because they are Quote Unquote funny for good looking folks.

Most good looking people do not have great personalities. This is a broad generalization and based on non quantifiable nor qualitative merit, but hear me out. One time I met this really attractive girl and she was not cool. Thus I'm sure I know what I'm talking about.

So anyway, back to my theory on JS and JA being famous. They are good looking people with just enough personality to separate them from the talent less beautiful folks like Megan Fox; however, if you compare their performance with Nick and Kathryn then the truth is revealed. They have nothing in the funny department. The first half of the film you think that Jen and Nick are doing well, but then Nick and Kathryn roll up in their Winniebago and carry the rest of the movie. Literally! Jen and Nick have to get in Nick and Kat's Winniebago. The Miller's RV breaks down just like their performances and the Fitzgerald's tow this film into Funville U.S.A.

They hint at a sequel for this movie, but I think they should do a prequel. Let's have it about The Fitzgeralds. I want to know his origin story. Nick Offerman. I just wanted to write his name one more time. It's a solid name. I love that guy.",1395619200,,1693,4.434083601286174
5575605,5,B00BC36YWC,"I'd read ""experts'"" reviews on this movie so wasn't expecting what I saw.  I purchased it, however, because I really like Jennifer Aniston's movies overall.  I thought this was funny!  Nice plot, good characters, sweet story, took me on a journey with them, lots of laughs along the way.  I really enjoyed it.  I really just can't let so-called experts determine which movies I do and do not see...simple as that.",1395446400,,413,4.76056338028169
5575606,5,B00BC36YWC,"The brand of comedy in We're the Millers is definitely not for everyone.  It is very raunchy and off color.  Along the lines of what American Pie started for the modern era comedies and has continued with movies like Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Knocked Up, Horrible Bosses etc.  So if that is not your brand of comedy, then skip this because you will hate it.

It tells the story of a small time drug dealer (played by Jason Sudeikis) who is forced/conned by the local drug ""kingpin"" played by Ed Helms doing basically a total jackass version of his character from The Office, into smuggling a ""smidge"" of marijuana from Mexico back into the US.  He enlists the help of the dorky neighbor kid (played by Will Poulter), the stripper living in his building (played by Aniston who although in her mid 40s has a body better than a lot of 20 year olds) and a neighborhood runaway (played by Emma Roberts) to be his fake family.  The thought being it will be easier to get across the border disguised as a family on vacation.

The story is somewhat predictable from there, but it is not meant to be anything that gets you thinking too deeply or a big mystery,  It is all about obstacles thrown in the way and character interactions.  All the main characters have moments to be very funny.  I am not really sure you can say that anyone in particular steals the show (although Katherine Hahn and Nick Offerman as the vacationing family the Millers are forced to tag along with when their RV breaks down come pretty close.

If you do get the blu ray, there are quite a few mini behind the scenes and making of features.  There are also a couple gag reels, and deleted/alternate scenes.  None of them are particularly long, but in total amount to about 45 min worth of material, so definitely enough for those who like to go through the bonus features.  And the movie looks and sounds great on blu ray.

As I said above the movie is not for everyone.  You likely already know whether you will like the brand of comedy or not.  If you do, it is definitely a movie worth checking out.  It is, in my opinion one of the better comedies in the last couple years.",1395446400,,2146,4.4311224489795915
5575607,5,B00BC36YWC,"I watched this film on DVD without much expectations.  I have not laugh so much and so loud in a long time, including the first ""Hangover"".  A comedy film of this kind constantly walks a tight rope of taking risks on how far
the filmmakers can go with being funny and with vulgarity and crassness, not to mention male genital nudity.  This film succeeds on most set pieces but with several misfire sequences which would make a much better film if deleted.  Credits must be given to the four lead actors especially Jennifer Aniston who gave a gutsy performance against type and the winning Jason Sudeikis who held the group and the film together.  Go watch and enjoy, with an open mind.",1395446400,,685,4.581967213114754

Jennifer Aniston reminds us she is comedy-capable since most of us stopped watching Friends years ago.

I was thankful I wasn't watching this in the Theatre bc I was laughing so loud & for long periods of time, I kept having to rewind it to see the parts I was missing.

5575719,4,B00BC36YWC,"I thought this sounded pretty lam but wanted something that would make my sister laugh, get her endorphins working. She is an Aniston fan. It was funnier than I expected and outside of friends probably one of A'nistons more successful roles.",1394323200,,241,4.902439024390244
5575720,2,B00BC36YWC,"Didn't really like the movie.  Very predictable.  A couple funny spots.

But generally, a badly-acted series of drug-culture puns strung together with a loose plot.

The bad guys were ""bad"".  The good guys were nebulous.  The overall plot was ""meh""...

Don't bother renting.  (And I'm glad we didn't blow big-bucks for the movie theater...)

5575722,5,B00BC36YWC,Best movie from last year.  Funny from the beginning to the extra playing a great theme song. I can't stop watching it over and over.,1394323200,,133,4.32

5575724,4,B00BC36YWC,Funny movie! Not exactly a deep plot but that's not what they were going for. For what it is a light comedy it's quite hilarious.,1394323200,,129,4.2
5575725,5,B00BC36YWC,"Was very funny, however I don't think I would not consider this a family movie. The sexual content in the first part of the movie with the mexican police offer was in poor taste.",1394323200,,178,4.264705882352941

5575727,4,B00BC36YWC,"So take my review of the movie with a bit of skepticism. I was not interested in seeing this when I saw it's trailer originally, But enough people talked it up that when it was available to buy brand new on black Friday for like 7 bucks I jumped on it. One thing I found watching the movie is that characters have much better chemistry then the trailer would lead you to believe. Mind you the movie does not break any new ground. It's a movie that makes you laugh, the good thing is that many of the jokes actually got me to laugh more then just the first play through.",1394236800,,569,4.135135135135135

5575744,1,B00BC36YWC,This is not a movie I would recommend. It was rally slow in the beginning and the plot just sunk after that. This was just not a movie I would tell someone to watch. It was more of a waste of time.,1394236800,,197,3.7142857142857144

5575749,1,B00BC36YWC,"This movie was disgusting.  The sex statements made with the father, Mexican policeman, and his son were not necessary to the story of the movie.  It is a shame that some movies have to resort to such filth.",1394064000,3,207,4.421052631578948
5575760,4,B00BC36YWC,I was not expecting to laugh out loud.  I Did.  Loved the scene with the 'son' singing TLC's 'Waterfalls'.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is the sappy family values inserted in the ending.,1394064000,,196,4.388888888888889
5575761,1,B00BC36YWC,Surprised that Jennifer Aniston would take this part. It wasn't  that funny. They tried to make it funny by using very crude language. This kind of Hollywood trash is a real shame. If you watch this with anyone under 18 you have moral issues that you need to work on. Wish I could get those 2 hrs of my life back.

Extremely funny where people were laughing through the movie.  Alot. It is not a family movie, it is for adults. Some suggestive scenes and some outright not so subtle ones. And it is just fun.

It really is one of the movies I will watch now and again because it is so funny.",1393977600,,510,4.06

5575767,5,B00BC36YWC,"This movie had me laughing from the opening credits until the end credits. The cast does a great job playing off each other. Lots of good one liners in this one.

On a side note - the UV sucks. I hate that most movies are going to this now because the quality of it is garbage.",1393977600,,277,3.9464285714285716

5575771,4,B00BC36YWC,"A very funny movie.  But, very vulgar in many scenes.  Beware, this is NOT a family movie.

5575774,2,B00BC36YWC,The movie really stretches a lot of points of believability even for a broad comedy. I was hoping for something like Pineapple Express. Really great performances by Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn.,1393891200,,196,5.15625
5575775,3,B00BC36YWC,This could of been so much funnier than it was. The Jason Sudeikis character could of been done without him being such a jerk. I think it would of worked better with the laughs if they had gone that way also. This is a film were the writers do write themselves into a corner by the end of the film so it is a little weak. But there are some funny parts to the film just not as many as I expected.,1393891200,,396,3.841463414634146

5575817,4,B00BC36YWC,"I love this movie so much, I just really like Jennifer and Emma but to be honest, I didn't know who played the guys. This movie is HIGHLY recommended and is just overall hilarious.",1393459200,,180,4.323529411764706
5575818,3,B00BC36YWC,"I felt like if you watched the previews for this movie, you basically saw all of the worthwhile parts of the story.  Some were still funny though, and we will probably watch it again.",1393459200,,183,4.382352941176471
5575819,1,B00BC36YWC,Hardly funny at all and a huge disappointment from the previews. Seeing JA shale her ass wasn't enough payoff to make this worth sitting through,1393459200,,144,4.8
5575828,4,B00BC36YWC,"Was just on Amazon one night searching around, like normal.  Came across this and remembered the trailer with the kid singing ""Waterfalls"" and how funny I thought it looked.  It was an OK movie with some funny parts.",1393459200,,216,4.657894736842105
5575829,2,B00BC36YWC,I did not watch this because it looked terrible. My wife watched it and said it was terrible. She said she laughed twice. One star for each laugh.,1393459200,,146,4.25
5575830,2,B00BC36YWC,"You might check this out, It's really not good / bad It's just predictable,boring,lame, and somewhat irrelevant. so if you can's pencil in a colonoscopy or something.. give it a go",1393372800,,180,4.838709677419355
5575831,4,B00BC36YWC,"this movie was very funny.  We enjoyed it and would watch it again.  While I would recommend it to others, I wish that there had been less swearing.",1393372800,,148,4.25
5575832,5,B00BC36YWC,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie. If you need a good laugh, and want to distance yourself from drama, this is the movie to see.  There is no doubt that you will laugh.  I would not recommend it for kids as the subject matter deals with a drug deal gone wrong, and some sexual innuendo but is ""clean"" when it comes to adult viewing.  FUN ONE!!!!",1393372800,,339,4.106060606060606
5575833,3,B00BC36YWC,"Offended by the mocking of religious praying. Almost turned the movie off, decided to keep watching. It was funny but I really disliked the fact they had to use the scene in the airplane with pretend prayer. ;(",1393372800,,210,4.552631578947368
5575834,5,B00BC36YWC,This movie is so funny. It is not exactly kids friendly but not too overboard. This movie is absolutely hilarious,1393372800,,113,4.7
5575835,4,B00BC36YWC,"Not for the puritanical type, as this comedy is very crude, but it had me rolling with laughter.  I am still grinning about the ""No Ragrets"" scene.",1393372800,,147,4.444444444444445

5575837,1,B00BC36YWC,It was stupid. To much cussing. A waste of film. The GD word was used way to much. Hollywood needs to learn to bring back movies that are worth watching,1393372800,,152,4.1
5575848,3,B00BC36YWC,Had some really funny parts. Did not have a lot of expectations but was pleasantly suprised. Definitely a good laugh.,1393372800,,117,4.9
5575849,5,B00BC36YWC,This movie is hilarious and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The rental price is great and I was able to stream it directly from my SmartTV.,1393286400,,132,4.32

5575851,3,B00BC36YWC,"A cute film, although entirely predictable. At least it wasn't about an action here from a comic book. Or the least effective monster, the zombie. Or maybe it would have been less predictable if zombies had been included. We'll never know.",1393286400,,239,4.853658536585366
5575852,5,B00BC36YWC,"Never get tired of watching this movie. SUPER FUNNY. Mildly inappropriate for kids, but really funny if just adults are watching it.",1393286400,,132,5.045454545454546
5575853,5,B00BC36YWC,"Funny good laughs and cracking up. Family loved it. what a great love story too.
my kids watched it 3 times",1393286400,,107,4.142857142857143
5575854,5,B00BC36YWC,Great acting by all.  I would suggest not watching with kids.  Adult only.  We laughed the entire movie which is rare these days.,1393286400,,129,4.521739130434782
5575855,5,B00BC36YWC,"If you need a good laugh, watch it! It was hilarious! I very much enjoyed it. Why does Amazon keep making me type more words??",1393286400,,126,4.08
5575856,5,B00BC36YWC,"Loved this movie. Plus the instant video feature is great. I've already watched it several times.
Very very very funny.",1393286400,,119,5.0
5575857,5,B00BC36YWC,This movie was funny I laughed the entire time. I would watch it again I should have brought it instead of renting it,1393200000,,117,4.130434782608695
5575858,4,B00BC36YWC,This movie was very funny.  My only complaint was the use of many many cuss words throughout the movie.  I still would recommend this to friends.,1393200000,,145,4.538461538461538
5575859,5,B00BC36YWC,This movie was unexpectedly hilarious.  It was a bit raunchy at times but I thought it was great.  Definitely recommend,1393200000,,119,4.9
5575860,3,B00BC36YWC,Movie was funny but there was a lot of profanity. I was watching it with my wife and daughter and was uncomfortable with it at times.,1393200000,,133,4.153846153846154
5575861,4,B00BC36YWC,I like silly-humor movies and outlandish unbelievable plots when it comes to this type of movie. I get the point of sarcasm and how it is used in this flick. If you liked something like Hang-over movie then you'll get this one as well.,1393200000,,235,4.363636363636363
5575862,5,B00BC36YWC,This movie is hilarious. Haven't laughed this hard in a long time! Some of the best one liners ever. But not a kids movie,1393200000,,121,4.083333333333333
5575863,4,B00BC36YWC,"I saw this at the theater with friends and it was great!  I saw it again at the theaters with other friends.  Great!  I rented it and watched it with my wife and we really enjoyed it.  This is a comedy movie where there is always a new situation happening.  No deep plot-just real life.

Watch it with a friend or spouse!  You'll be glad you did did!",1393200000,,350,4.0588235294117645

5575865,4,B00BC36YWC,"Funny, if you want to laugh and relax. Does not require focus, can just chill and enjoy. No complaints here",1393200000,,107,4.4
5575866,1,B00BC36YWC,"Would not recommend this movie.
Really made no sense.
We didn't finish watching it.
We don't like to waste time on this kind of thing",1393200000,,133,4.36

5575868,1,B00BC36YWC,"I like Jennifer Aniston. I've been a fan since Friends.  This movie was terrible. There were a few funny moments but for the most part, I was embarrassed to even be watching it.  I wish I could delete it from my list, and I really wish I hadn't bought it expecting something good.",1393113600,,280,4.264150943396227
5575869,1,B00BC36YWC,"Got bored. This drags on and is pretty predictable. A few chuckles here and there, but too painful to watch.",1393113600,,108,4.45
5575870,3,B00BC36YWC,Overall a vulgar and predictable movie with a few really funny moments. A good mindless rental for a Saturday night.,1393113600,2,116,4.85
5575871,5,B00BC36YWC,"Funny movie however some parts of the movie were goofy,I just love Jennifer Aniston in anything that she does. I was first introduce to Jennifer Aniston in the comedy sitcom show ""Friends"" and she is good.",1393113600,3,205,4.722222222222222
5575872,1,B00BC36YWC,"If you find dumb vulgar humor funny, you might appreciate this movie. I would have rather watched paint dry myself. Waste of money. Even seeing Aniston dance half-naked couldn't save this load of bile.",1393113600,,201,4.9411764705882355
5575873,2,B00BC36YWC,"Storyline is okay.  Some good actors. But some of the scences are just raunchy. Who wants to see a seen depicting a supposed mom, son, daughter teaching each other to kiss.  And it gets worse.",1393113600,,192,4.457142857142857
5575874,5,B00BC36YWC,Love love love this movie. My husband and I have watched it over and over. We have loaned it to everyone. I can't decide what part is my favorite.,1393113600,,146,4.068965517241379
5575875,5,B00BC36YWC,This movie was so darned funny. I can't wait for the second one to come out. It is a laugh out loud kind of movie.,1393113600,,114,3.6
5575876,4,B00BC36YWC,"Some great laughs here.  Not for kids, but a fun show for grown ups.  Watch the out takes at the end.",1393113600,,101,3.761904761904762
5575877,4,B00BC36YWC,"This was funny. There were quite a few ""akward moments"" in this movie.
Glad I was just watching it with my husband.",1393027200,,115,4.2727272727272725
5575887,4,B00BC36YWC,"this movie was very funny. Fresh and surprisingly new parts for Jennifer and Jason, and the kids steal every scene they are in. The supporting cast is not disappointing either. A very pleasant surprise all around.",1393027200,,213,4.944444444444445
5575888,1,B00BC36YWC,Absolute trash.  Had to stop after 30 minutes.  These actors have really sunk low to sign on to this mess.,1393027200,3,106,4.25
5575889,5,B00BC36YWC,Nice comedy movie. Jennifer anniston still got it in her. Pablochacon was the funniest. Spider scene was the best. Good job!,1393027200,,124,4.9523809523809526
5575890,5,B00BC36YWC,This movie had do many funny scenes. We haven't laughed like that during a movie in a long time. Would definitely watch again.,1393027200,,126,4.521739130434782
5575891,5,B00BC36YWC,"I really enjoyed this film, it was, at times, even hysterical. The only drawback for me was the over use of the F word. If you can get past that it's a great flick!",1393027200,,164,3.8529411764705883
5575892,5,B00BC36YWC,This was such a funny movie after watching it I like her wow I always say I don't know these people they might be really nice in real life didn't think she was that nice until I saw this movie very good and very funny,1393027200,,217,3.8444444444444446
5575893,5,B00BC36YWC,"Look for a funny movie to watch and laugh with a few friends? Look no further away to ""Were the Millers!""",1393027200,,105,4.0476190476190474
5575894,5,B00BC36YWC,"Seriously, rent this movie.
I know, the cast looks kind of like a typical Jennifer Anniston movie cast.
But these character have a great chemistry and the writing is great.
We were seriously laughing from the time the movie started, to the very end.
It was one of the best 90 minutes watching a movie I've had in a long time.
You won't be disappointed.",1393027200,,352,4.430769230769231
5575895,3,B00BC36YWC,"Not a great movie to watch with multi-generations. Kind of a dark show. Could have done with a little less vulgarity...but then...we are talking about a movie with a ""drug"" theme...so, what did I expect?",1392940800,,203,4.828571428571428
5575896,5,B00BC36YWC,"Super funny movie. Not for the kids but awesome for a stay at home date with the hubby. Popcorn,  beer, a movie...perfect!",1392940800,,122,4.545454545454546
5575897,5,B00BC36YWC,"This movie is very funny. Not sure if it s appropriate for all ages, there is brief nudity and a little mature content. But the acting was great all the characters did an awesome job. Very funny",1392940800,,194,4.27027027027027
5575898,4,B00BC36YWC,"Traditionally I eschew the comedy genre, but this one is a diamond in the rough. The characters grow steadilly on you throughout the movie, and the plot is typical for comedy. Aside from this I lagughed quite a bit. While I will say that the individual characters are heavily typified (and a little over-pushed), the hilarity of this movie overcomes it's minor flaws.",1392854400,,367,4.841269841269841
5575899,5,B00BC36YWC,"This movie was hilarious, as expected.  One of the better raunchy comedies I've seen since the first Hangover movie.  Can't complain about Jennifer Aniston either.",1392854400,,163,5.48
5575900,1,B00BC36YWC,"I don't know how many times I wanted to pop out this DVD but since I paid for it, I stuck it out. I think it was childish trash. too much fould language and some pretty gross scenes even for my eyes!  Don't bother it is not THAT funny!",1392854400,2,235,3.795918367346939
5575901,1,B00BC36YWC,"This was an awful, stupid movie.  I'm glad I didn't waste the full price at the theater.  turned it off before the end.",1392854400,,119,4.130434782608695
5575902,4,B00BC36YWC,I rented this because it looked mildly funny - but I had reservations.  I was shocked how good it turned out.  Yes there are times the plot seems totally dumb and the movie drags but overall it's a keeper for a fun afternoon/evening of laughs.  Don't expect great art or strong themes - expect stupid silly people making idiots of themselves.  Expect people with flaws that improve (even if only slightly) during the film - check your realism meter at the door.,1392854400,,461,4.585365853658536
5575903,5,B00BC36YWC,"This is an outstanding movie. So funny! This movie does have a few parts where children shouldn't be around, but still a great movie.",1392854400,,133,4.583333333333333
5575904,5,B00BC36YWC,Laughed all the way through.  Lots of surprises and many situations that kept a certain suspense but still followed a story,1392854400,,123,4.857142857142857
5575905,3,B00BC36YWC,It has a good story. Kind of got old . Movie was too long. I guess it was worth the price.,1392854400,,90,3.3333333333333335
5575906,5,B00BC36YWC,"this is an awesome movie, a must watch if you want to laugh and be entertained. I'd buy this dvd!",1392854400,,97,3.9
5575917,5,B00BC36YWC,"Storyline is marvelous and the actors suited their roles with fantastic performances by all. Now who would think of picking up a group of  strangers to become a fake family to achieve  what he has got to do. Oh I forgot to mention the items well I'm not telling you that, now that would ruin it and than you won't see it and miss out on a great show, So a mixed group of neighbors and a road trip to the border with promises of payment for their troubles, sounds simple enough  but there is a lot more to this than meets the eye they don't even know about. Several things happen that makes it a bit harder for him to complete his goal, One part I did like was when she throws the baby away. So I rated this an A grade plus for plenty of laughs and wonderful entertainment for all, so now go collect the popcorn climb on to your lounge and put your feet up and relax to this delightful and wonderful show. Enjoy!",1392768000,,911,4.106741573033708

5575919,4,B00BC36YWC,Hilarious!!  Great cast that had really good chemistry.  Fun movie too bad the whole family could not see it.  A little less foul language would have been ok,1392768000,,157,4.535714285714286
5575920,5,B00BC36YWC,"Loved the movie. We bought it to watch with our neighbors ""The Millers"".  In my opinion, the language is iffy for pre-teens, there is a lot of cussing and adult language as well as some adult situations.  The Millers that were watching it with us were OK with it for their 12 year old son so I might be a little off on this for some people.  I am a grandma :)",1392768000,,359,3.9583333333333335
5575921,5,B00BC36YWC,This was interesting and very very funny. It was nice to see Jason S. and Jennifer A. in characters that were a little dirty.,1392768000,,125,4.25

5575924,4,B00BC36YWC,I watched this movie when I had an evening at home alone and it was a lot more fun than I anticipated. I would certainly watch it again.,1392768000,,136,3.892857142857143
5575925,3,B00BC36YWC,"It had its funny moments but the humor was repetitive.. and predictable.  It was okay but I wouldn't go ""out of my way""  to see it again.",1392768000,,137,4.037037037037037
5575926,2,B00BC36YWC,"Very crude for my taste. If you're into soft porn and you want to see crude and rude sexual humor, this movie is for you.",1392768000,,121,3.88
5575927,3,B00BC36YWC,"Great date night movie - we really enjoyed this movie.

Pop some popcorn - kick back on the couch and laugh.",1392768000,,108,4.142857142857143

5575929,4,B00BC36YWC,This was a pretty funny movie.  Jason Sudeikis and Jennifer Anniston were great together.  I would definitely watch it again.,1392768000,,125,5.2

5575931,1,B00BC36YWC,The millers was a horrible movie. It was pushing to be funny through out the whole movie. Couldn't bear to watch the whole movie.,1392768000,2,129,4.416666666666667
5575932,5,B00BC36YWC,"Not one to watch with the kids!  Sudiakis and Anniston have a surprising chemistry and Kenny is the best character, in my opinion.  Great movie!  Must watch if you have a sense of humor.",1392768000,,186,4.411764705882353
5575933,4,B00BC36YWC,"My wife and I enjoyed this movie together on a rare night without the kids. It's fairly predictable in outcome, but funny along the way.",1392681600,,136,4.48
5575934,5,B00BC36YWC,This movie's cast is EXTREMELY funny and quirky together!! Watch it for some easy entertainment that will leave you laughing,1392681600,,124,5.25

.I recommend it.",1392681600,,111,4.090909090909091
5575937,1,B00BC36YWC,It could have been just as funny without all the foul language.  It was a turn-off!  Jennifer Anniston should be ashamed of herself for being involved with this movie.,1392595200,3,167,4.724137931034483
5575938,4,B00BC36YWC,I didn't have high hopes for this movie but decided to watch it anyway. I was so wrong! It was very funny and certainly made me chuckle. I really enjoyed watching this and while it's probably NOT for the whole family it's certainly worth watching. xD,1392595200,,250,4.456521739130435
5575939,3,B00BC36YWC,This seemed like a movie where all the funny parts were shown in the trailer however when it came to actually watching the movie it was not the case.  There were plenty of laughs to be had and overall it was enjoyable.,1392595200,,218,4.190476190476191
5575940,3,B00BC36YWC,This movie was okay. I hate that comedies always have so much bad language these days. I felt this movie would have been much funny if I hadn't had to listen to the foul language all the way through. The rest of it was okay though.,1392595200,,231,4.043478260869565

5575942,3,B00BC36YWC,"I watched this movie because of the trailer, but it did not live up to the 'dark drug running' concept. It seemed that the plot quickly ran out and they tried to make the movie more about being funny and acting like a real family.",1392595200,,230,4.133333333333334

5575945,4,B00BC36YWC,I really liked this movie laughed throughout and Jennifer Aniston just gets better looking! Ed Helms role was way out of realm (loved the Orca scene),1392595200,,149,4.769230769230769
5575946,4,B00BC36YWC,This is a really funny adult movie.  This cast did a terrific job and fit so good together.  Great movie.,1392595200,,105,4.2

5575953,4,B00BC36YWC,"This was a good comedy with some true ""laugh out loud"" moments. Comedy is a tough genre, despite the perception that it's ""easy"" but this film pulls it off. Jennifer Aniston is especially surprising. She does a very good job with her character. Like some other reviewers mentioned, the plot is pretty predictable, but you don't watch a film like this expecting ""Memento"" or something like that. I enjoyed it and thought it was much better than most recent comedic efforts.",1392595200,,472,4.839506172839506

5575957,5,B00BC36YWC,It was a good movie.  Funny one liners.  Jennifer Aniston can dance on that pole wow.  I thought the chemistry between the actors made it more funny.,1392595200,,149,4.444444444444445

5575965,4,B00BC36YWC,This was a fun comedy. Jennifer Aniston was remarkable in it and so was the the actor that played her fake son. To me the two of them carried the whole movie and I found myself laughing out loud over the situations they got themselves in. As for the strip tease scene? I didn't find it all that great. I believe Jennifer Aniston has some great talent but she could have done better. Some of her photos in people Magazine radiate more heat then her strip tease scene.,1392508800,,466,4.306818181818182

5575970,3,B00BC36YWC,I do like a good comedy but the whole movie was about drugs which turned me off. Would not tell anyone to watch it. Sorry,1392422400,,121,3.88
5575971,5,B00BC36YWC,Funny movie! It was one of the best I've seen recently. We all loved it here. We'll be watching again for sure!,1392422400,,111,4.090909090909091

5575973,1,B00BC36YWC,"The movie was funny (or at least what I could see of it) but the quality was horrible.  I tried 3 different times, during the evening and it totally ruined my evening.

5575976,4,B00BC36YWC,"Funny, worth the time. A good  Combination of dumb humor and intelligent jokes. The clips after the show or as just as funny.",1392422400,,125,4.434782608695652
5575977,1,B00BC36YWC,"My wife and I couldn't finish it. All I could do is feel sorry for Jennifer Aniston. How embarrassing for her. Her career no doubt has hit rock bottom. Rock bottom meeting up with both the writer or writers and the director of the movie, whom probably haven't been anywhere else in their careers. I'm asking for my $1.99 back out of principle. For all those reviewers who thought the movie was funny, let alone, coherent, you really have no idea what comedy is. Jennifer, give it up, you're done. Hollywood, fade away like forgotten drunken prostitute that you are.",1392422400,2,565,4.66
5575978,4,B00BC36YWC,"I really didn't think I would like this movie my husband picked out for valentine's night, but I was wrong.  It actually had me laughing out loud in many parts.  Nothing fantastic, but good for several laughs.  :)",1392422400,,213,4.552631578947368

5575980,3,B00BC36YWC,It was cheesy and pretty predictable. There are some funny moments. Wait until it's free with Prime or $1 rental.,1392336000,,113,4.7
5575981,5,B00BC36YWC,"The Milers is a family movie and most enjoyable! If you are a fan of Jennifer, which I am you will enjoy this movie. Keeps you laughing entire movie!!!",1392336000,,151,4.241379310344827
5575982,5,B00BC36YWC,"Normally I do NOT like movies that are supposed to be funny and reference drugs.  ""How High"", the Harold and Kumar films, even ""this is the end"" glorify drug use, especially marijuana.  This was different.  The laughs did not come from watching the main characters get stoned and talk or act stupid, but from some deeply flawed and yet likeable people put in a ridiculous situation and how they react to each other and actually grow.  I found the chemistry between each character to be spot-on, and the decisions, while morally questionable, were not totally out of any realm of possibility.  I laughed until I couldn't see straight.  I don't know if there was a moral to the story, but the journey was fantastic.",1392336000,,713,4.709677419354839

5575987,2,B00BC36YWC,"I'll never know what happened because I turned it off about 30 minutes in.  Good luck and good riddance.

5575991,3,B00BC36YWC,"This movie was okay but capitalized on toilet humor. It seems to be riding the coat tails of every other popular comedy out there. Of course it made me laugh but I am easy to make laugh. It seems they just copied the format of other movies like Superbad and Pineapple Express to try and cheat a few laughs, and dollars. The dynamic of these kind of movies is getting old wish something original would come on to the scene sometime soon if not i will lose faith and 3 stars will turn to 1.",1392249600,,488,4.147368421052631
5575992,5,B00BC36YWC,Jason Sudeikus was hilarious in this movie. His little smart ass remarks throughout the whole movie made it such a funny movie. I really love his humor,1392249600,,151,4.62962962962963

5576002,5,B00BC36YWC,I wasn't sure what to expect and was pleasantly surprised.  This was a very smart and quirky comedy.  The storyline worked.  Not too ridiculous or over the top.  We watched it with our 19 and 22 year old kids over the holidays and they also loved this movie.  Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis were excellent and had great chemistry.  The actors who played their kids also did an excellent job.  Highly recommend.,1392163200,,415,4.680555555555555

The movie is constantly packed with funny dialogue and hilarious antics for the full nearly 2 hrs. Top comedy not to be missed!!!

5576028,5,B00BC36YWC,"Watched this on a plane trip and had to be careful I wasn't laughing too loud. Great actors, interesting plot and lots of laughs. Certainly not intellectual, but it was the funniest movie I had seen in a while.",1391990400,,210,4.410256410256411
5576029,5,B00BC36YWC,Good light entertainment. Decent story with good presentation. The presentation was over simplified but acceptable while legal and illegal activities where smudged.,1391990400,,164,6.5
5576030,4,B00BC36YWC,Its predictable but pretty funny.  The storyline is very original. The acting is good. It was a lot better and funnier than I had expected it to be.,1391990400,,148,4.285714285714286
5576031,1,B00BC36YWC,Only watched half way through. I really didn't care for it at all. It would have been better with a little less F word and talk about body parts in places that made no sense,1391904000,,173,3.9714285714285715

5576035,3,B00BC36YWC,I guess I was expecting a little more from this movie. I think the cast is great and did what they could with the script. There are some funny scenes but not enough for me to rate any higher.,1391904000,,191,3.923076923076923
5576036,5,B00BC36YWC,This movie was hilarious from the beginning till the end. It wasn't your cliche try hard attempts to make the viewers laugh. It was actually a relatable type of humor.,1391904000,,167,4.6
5576037,5,B00BC36YWC,"Coworkers told me how funny this show was, and they were right, but would not recommend allowing children to watch, too much content that is not appropriate for children.",1391817600,,170,4.896551724137931
5576038,2,B00BC36YWC,"I have many comedians say that it is harder to tell a clean joke, then a dirty one. This movie wasn't all that funny, and just nasty.",1391817600,,133,3.962962962962963
5576039,5,B00BC36YWC,"Hilarious movie- but I did get quite a bit embarrassed at times watching it!  It's one of those movies that you leave and tell all of your comedy loving friends to watch ASAP.  I watched it 3 times in one week (over the holidays immediately after it came out and I was off work) and my husband actually said ""ok that is enough"" after the third time.  But I could have gone for 4.  Note: As I wrote this and read the review to my hubby he said ""i could actually watch it again- that is a great movie"". Men.  :)",1391817600,,509,4.0
5576040,5,B00BC36YWC,"Great, funny movie with Jennifer Anniston and it's a really, really funny movie.  About a drug dealer who has to pick up some drugs in Mexico in an RV.  Some make like it, others probably wont.",1391817600,,193,4.333333333333333
5576041,5,B00BC36YWC,Funny part of a movie where it takes these people through an adventure and brings them together to get out of a tight situation.  Hillarious.  Great must see comedy movie.,1391817600,,171,4.666666666666667

5576044,5,B00BC36YWC,"Haven't laughed out loud at a movie in a long time until now. The cast is a perfect combination. And the story line is funny too.

And what's not to like about Jennifer Aniston as a stripper?!?!?!",1391817600,,196,4.297297297297297
5576045,5,B00BC36YWC,"This movie is awesome.  Love the cast, and the plot.  A little harsh language but still manage to keep it funny without being tasteless.  Definitely a movie I will watch over and over again.",1391817600,,190,4.529411764705882
5576046,5,B00BC36YWC,"I thought this movie was quite entertaining .. it made me laugh several times! So many times you see the funny parts of a comedy during the trailers for them, but this one had many left over for the movie ... :)",1391731200,,211,4.0476190476190474

5576048,3,B00BC36YWC,"Waiting for Aniston to take a role outside her ""comfort zone"" She seems to play the same character over and over. It's gotta be a boring way to ""succeed"" in the film industry. She has no range and refuses to play roles that could expand her film choices. Good Luck with the next choice. Film was ok. NOthing great.",1391731200,,314,4.338983050847458
5576049,4,B00BC36YWC,Good funny movie as long as you don't take it too seriously. Lots of fun and Jennifer Aniston dancing in her underwear is definitely worth the price of admission!,1391731200,,162,4.620689655172414
5576050,3,B00BC36YWC,I didn't expect much from this movie. The plot was kind of easy to see through but how it was executed was great. So my review is a little misleading I love the acting and banter between all the characters even when I knew what was coming like the plot twist of the main protagonist leaving the group or the daughter running off. It's how they pulled it off that was done in a funny way. A good comedy great laughs check it out.,1391731200,,428,4.107142857142857
5576051,5,B00BC36YWC,Hilarious! Loved it! Jennifer Aniston is one of my favorite actresses. I watch all of her movies. You should watch this!,1391731200,,120,4.761904761904762

5576057,2,B00BC36YWC,"I remain a fan of Jennifer Aniston's even though a lot her movies lately have been dudes. I thought this would be good with the SNL guy in it. While there were definite funny parts, it was not very good. You can do better then these movies Aniston!",1391644800,,248,4.1875

5576060,4,B00BC36YWC,Me and my wife the movie... It's comedy. Not much of poor jokes but something sensible . Overall good .,1391644800,,103,4.2
5576061,3,B00BC36YWC,"there were parts of it that were good, but i was really surprised how bad the language was.  I'm mean Jennifer Aniston a potty mouth? who knew",1391558400,,142,4.2592592592592595
5576062,3,B00BC36YWC,"jennifer was not convincing as a stripper, but it was kinda a funny family movie, (pg 13 though).  not an overly clever story line, performances not award winning, but mildly entertaining.  red box rental price anyway.",1391558400,,218,5.027777777777778
5576063,5,B00BC36YWC,"This was a funny movie.  Would definitely not watch it while the kids are still awake, subject matter and language definitely not appropriate for little ears and eyes.",1391558400,,167,4.964285714285714
5576064,5,B00BC36YWC,I saw this movie in the movie theatre and knew I had to add it to my collection.  Great flick,1391558400,,93,3.65
5576065,1,B00BC36YWC,Filled with bad language- I know movies try to appear real life but all the curse words are not necessary!!,1391558400,,107,4.4
5576066,3,B00BC36YWC,"overdid the f-word by a factor of 10 , plot got thin in places. overall another movie where the trailer is better than the movie",1391558400,,128,4.16
5576067,4,B00BC36YWC,"I really enjoyed this film...loved it the first time in theaters, and it was okay the second time. It reminded me of Pinapple Express...not just because it is a comedy about drugs, but it has the same kind of feel to it I thought.",1391558400,,230,4.25
5576068,5,B00BC36YWC,We saw this in the theater the first time and knew I HAD to own it for my home library.,1391558400,,87,3.4
5576069,5,B00BC36YWC,Good movie to have a laugh. I loved watching this family get into trouble then work their way back out of it. Great ending as well.,1391472000,,131,4.076923076923077
5576070,4,B00BC36YWC,"I wasn't expecting much with this movie - just a sit down and relax movie. It was pretty good. There are a few LOL moments and make sure you watch all of the outtakes when the credits are rolling.

Not an academy award winner but I've watched much worse. Nice adult comedy.",1391472000,,273,4.25
5576071,5,B00BC36YWC,I never laughed so hard in my life. Jennifer Anniston was absolutely great as well as the other actors. Highly Recommended.,1391472000,,123,4.904761904761905

5576073,5,B00BC36YWC,"Not as formulaic or predictable as most comedies these days, and doesn't need to subsist on fart jokes.  Aniston's best comedy since the Break Up, she's absolutely terrific in this.  I will definitely watch this one again.",1391472000,2,222,4.972972972972973

5576078,4,B00BC36YWC,"Not side-splitting, but pretty darn funny. Not a J.A. fan, but this works. Hubby enjoyed too, has some adult humor probably not worth the extra to watch in HD though",1391385600,,165,4.533333333333333
5576079,1,B00BC36YWC,"Not worth the price of downloading.  Wasted 45 mins of my life-it was predictable, over the top and just not funny.",1391385600,,115,4.476190476190476
5576080,5,B00BC36YWC,"Great movie! Hilarious movie for both sexes to enjoy. Beyond a comedy, this movie has a twisting, yet hilarious plot.",1391385600,,117,4.9
5576081,5,B00BC36YWC,"The story line was great! This is the only movie I've ever watched that I laughed at every single joke, practically the entire movie! I'd recommend it to everyone (17+ that is)!",1391385600,,177,4.5625
5576082,1,B00BC36YWC,"Again, all the good scenes were in the commercials. Jenn is hot though, she gets the only star. I would wait till this is a $.99 rental.",1391385600,,136,4.074074074074074
5576083,4,B00BC36YWC,"Not the funniest movie I've seen this year, but it had lots of laugh-out loud moments. Definitely not a family flick, unless the family is teenagers and above, and even then some parents may be squeamish.",1391385600,,204,4.694444444444445

5576085,1,B00BC36YWC,All of the funny scenes were already shown in the trailer.  The best part was the bloopers and edits at the end.,1391385600,,112,4.090909090909091
5576086,5,B00BC36YWC,This movie is hilarious! I loved every minute of this movie! I rented but think I need to own it :),1391385600,,99,3.761904761904762
5576087,5,B00BC36YWC,So so so much better than the previews! Loved it! Can't wait to buy my own copy.  Hilarious! Could watch over and over.,1391299200,,119,4.173913043478261
5576088,4,B00BC36YWC,Kind crazy movie but pretty good a different roll for Jenifer anniston but good comedy it was good buy to enjoy the movie over and over,1391299200,,135,4.230769230769231
5576089,2,B00BC36YWC,"Pity, it could have been a very funny movie (even touching at the end). Instead it went for stupid and crude humor.",1391299200,,115,4.2727272727272725
5576090,4,B00BC36YWC,"Lighthearted, cute movie.  Would definitely recommend it.  Lots of laughs.  However, if cursing offends you, I wouldn't recommend watching it.",1391299200,,142,6.0
5576091,3,B00BC36YWC,It was okay but went to extremes on all the bad incidents that happened. Sort of disappointed in Jennifer Ashton's part,1391299200,,119,4.714285714285714
5576092,2,B00BC36YWC,"Was really looking forward to seeing this movie based on the previews.  Very disappointed.  There were a few funny parts, but all in all the forced use of profanity where it wasn't needed and scenes that didn't contribute to the movie (Mexican policeman and spider bite - sound familiar?) had us close to turning it off more than once.  Who talks like that?

Funny concept, great cast, terrible writing.",1391299200,,403,4.797101449275362
5576093,4,B00BC36YWC,Ignore the critics and watch this movie.  All the performances are stellar and it tried to be nothing but light hearted and fun.  It gave me several out loud laughs.,1391299200,,165,4.466666666666667
5576094,4,B00BC36YWC,"I wanted the movie to continue when I got to the end. They definitely need to do sequel. VERY FUNNY!!! It is R-rated, but not vulgar in any means.",1391299200,,146,4.068965517241379
5576095,5,B00BC36YWC,Truly only watched this to see Jennifer Aniston as a stripper. Enjoyed the movie had some funny parts. Could have been funnier,1391299200,,126,4.7727272727272725
5576096,3,B00BC36YWC,"Funny? Check.
Lots of cursing? Check.
Jennifer Anniston, stripping? Check.

If you are easily offended, don't like curse words or watching Jennifer Anniston strip, this movie is not for you. If you are ok with all of that, this movie isn't going to win any awards, but you won't be disappointed that you paid for it.",1391299200,,316,4.642857142857143
5576097,5,B00BC36YWC,This movie had me literally at the edge of my seat. I have not laughed this hard in a long time highly recommended it. I give this move two thumbs all the way up.,1391212800,,162,3.7941176470588234
5576098,4,B00BC36YWC,"Language was rougher than necessary but overall it was entertaining. Similar to Hangover but ""family"" based. Except for the ""f"" word",1391212800,,132,5.333333333333333
5576099,3,B00BC36YWC,"it was funny, but not laugh out loud funny. the premise was kind of silly. Like anything with Jennifer Anniston in it, but it wasn't one of her best films.",1391212800,,155,4.2

5576101,5,B00BC36YWC,"The seductress Jennifer Aniston strips, Jason Sudeikis' drug dealing character is absolutely hysterical. An awesome cast. We laughed from beginning to end with a break about 1/2 way through so I could pee because I almost wet myself from laughing so hard. Not appropriate for children.

Watched it last night and re-watching it now because it was THAT good!! Fake families rock. Loved it!!

5576102,5,B00BC36YWC,This movie is super funny but lets face it it's about drugs so use good judgement when it comes to viewing this with younger audiences!! Just cause its funny and you wanna watch it doesn't mean you should watch this with kids under 16 years old!!,1391212800,,246,4.369565217391305

5576107,3,B00BC36YWC,"At first I was a little bit skeptical, since Jennifer Aniston, and sometimes her hair define a genre of ""Jennifer Aniston"" films, which is not the actress's fault. Aniston had a decent start with the ""Good Girl"" and ""Along came Polly"" and has a nice range. She can be dark and sexy, if you only let her. In ""We're the Millers"", Jennifer get's to play with Jason Sudeikis and Emma Roberts, which results in some luscious dark humor. I did not know what to expect from a rated comedy and we were wondering, why even risk this cinematic balancing act, but it pays off most of the time. The cast is hilarious and there are some unexpected turns and twists, which makes this story entertaining.

5576109,1,B00BC36YWC,Tacky entertainment. Waste of time. I love comedy but at what cost?? I would not recommend this movie to anyone.,1391126400,,112,4.65
5576110,2,B00BC36YWC,Just didn't keep my attention and they could have made such a better movie by changing the story line to have more suspense.,1391126400,,124,4.434782608695652
5576111,5,B00BC36YWC,"Very funny movie. We laughed throughout the entired thing! I reccommend this for adults only as it's subject and content are very mature!

5576114,4,B00BC36YWC,It was very funny but they used the F word a little too much.  Usually that doesn't bother me but too much of a good thing can be over kill.  Overall good movie and definitely recommend it.,1391126400,,189,4.081081081081081
5576115,5,B00BC36YWC,"Good dialogue, good casting, good acting.  I thought it started a bit slow in setting the stage but it picked up soon enough as the story progressed. Lots of foul language that was well placed. Some things were predictable some not. Overall it is a very good laugh and well worth seeing.",1391126400,,287,4.519230769230769
5576116,5,B00BC36YWC,Loved this movie - everyone in our family from 17 to 50+.  Ok I admit I love Jennifer Aniston... but the movie is pretty funny.,1391040000,,127,4.08
5576117,4,B00BC36YWC,"Me and my guest enjoyed the movie, made us laugh, made us think.  I think it is a movie that most would enjoy. Seeing Jennifer Aniston in this role was a bit of a surprise from her character type on ""Friends"" but was very enjoyable.",1391040000,,232,4.155555555555556
5576118,3,B00BC36YWC,"I like everyone in this movie. It seems like the writers had to strain a bit to string it all together, but it has some funny moments in it.
Jennifer Anniston just keeps on getting better with age .... what a bod!  She doesn't need to act, just standing there is good enough for me.  While this ain't fine art, it's a pleasant way to spend an hour and a half....beats cutting the grass.",1391040000,,386,4.202702702702703
5576119,5,B00BC36YWC,This movie is so funny we laughed through out the entire family. This is a group a people that come together to pretend to be a family for personal gain. Love this movie.,1391040000,,170,4.181818181818182
5576120,2,B00BC36YWC,Movie was good but it kept stopping and getting blury. Watching on Google television. Time ran out while watching and movie stopped.,1391040000,,132,5.045454545454546
5576121,3,B00BC36YWC,"Funny idea but didn't put it together super well. Pretty funny still!!! Worth watching but not renting for $5. Go to red box, it's cheaper.",1391040000,,139,4.6
5576122,5,B00BC36YWC,This was such a big surprise in that it was more than I expected.  What a great movie to own.,1391040000,,93,3.65
5576123,3,B00BC36YWC,"I would have given this movie 4 stars if I were grading it as a sophomoric comedy.  While there are unquestionably some funny scenes, for me the movie was less then the sum of its parts.  Those seeking mindless entertainment and not turned off by the pot themed story plot, ongoing stream of four letter words and sexual innuendo will probably enjoy this movie.  Those that do not find these themes funny or find them offensive, probably will not.  For me personally, I found the movie in the final analysis, less funny or offensive then simply just boring.",1391040000,,557,4.653061224489796
5576124,5,B00BC36YWC,"Very fun movie, saw in theater had to see again !  Should just buy it. Would be worth it. Kat",1391040000,,93,3.65
5576125,3,B00BC36YWC,I was hoping for more. I think the bloopers at the end were good. Also Emma Roberts needs to play other roles besides the bitchy annoying girl. Otherwise all the characters were pretty good.,1391040000,,190,4.617647058823529
5576126,5,B00BC36YWC,This movie had me laughing all throughout! It is very adult content oriented. If you love a good laugh then I would advise watching this movie.,1391040000,,143,4.538461538461538
5576127,4,B00BC36YWC,"Mostly rated this rating for the humor.  Not an Aniston fan!  Some crude humor and unnecessary stripping scene, but funny nonetheless.",1391040000,,134,5.333333333333333
5576128,2,B00BC36YWC,The bit w/ the kid rapping was kind of fun. The rest is potty humor and caricature.,1391040000,,83,3.9411764705882355
5576129,5,B00BC36YWC,The movie was very funny and I enjoyed it. Definitely 5 stars for convenience and High definition video. Renting the movie will only give you 24 hours.,1390953600,,151,4.62962962962963
5576130,5,B00BC36YWC,why did jennifer not go all naked?  the strip and dance was great and oh hell she is hotter than when she was on friends,1390953600,,120,3.8
5576131,4,B00BC36YWC,"This is another movie out there that I would not recommend for kids, but is very funny material for the adults. It doesn't go over the top sexually, but is somewhat suggestive, just enough to get your attention. Not all will appreciate its style of humor, but it was a nice break from the normal movie formula.",1390953600,,310,4.456140350877193
5576132,3,B00BC36YWC,"Did not think I would like this film, but it turned out to be pretty entertaining for a comedy. Worth the rental.",1390953600,,113,4.181818181818182
5576133,1,B00BC36YWC,"stupid overrated and juvenile, can I give it zero stars? Where are all the good movies? Jennifer Aniston plays herself in every movie- a one-note actress, over and done",1390953600,5,168,4.827586206896552
5576134,4,B00BC36YWC,"the plot is a bit dumb, but it's a comedy and made me laugh out loud throughout. I would watch it again.",1390953600,,104,3.772727272727273

5576136,3,B00BC36YWC,This movie is certainly not Oscar-quality but it is entertaining. It will keep your attention with some action and some laughter.,1390953600,,129,5.190476190476191

5576138,5,B00BC36YWC,One of the funniest movies I had seen in a long time. I laugh just thinking about it.  I suggest it to all my friends.,1390953600,,118,3.72
5576139,4,B00BC36YWC,"It's really sweet comedy, building a family to smuggle drugs from Mexico to the USA. A lot of the F*** word, so I would say it family appropriate.
We enjoyed watching it and had a great time.",1390953600,,191,4.1891891891891895
5576140,4,B00BC36YWC,"Laughed the whole time really enjoyed it. Rated 4 stars, because it isn't a movie I would watch over and over. One time is good enough.",1390953600,,135,4.230769230769231
5576141,4,B00BC36YWC,"This film was one of the funniest comedies I have seen in awhile. I would recommend to anyone who loves comedy. It is worth seeing again because some of the comments could be missed. However, some people have a problem with the language, but it makes it more realistic.",1390953600,,269,4.510204081632653
5576142,3,B00BC36YWC,"This is not sit down family-fun movie.  This has very adult themes, glorifying some very adult subjects. It is funny in spots and a scantly clad Jennifer Aniston is always a plus.",1390953600,,179,4.59375
5576143,4,B00BC36YWC,What a crazy story.  Would recommend the Millers to others.  Found myself laughing out load  - Funny at times... enjoyed this movie.  Rented it twice...,1390953600,,152,4.96

5576145,5,B00BC36YWC,"I laughed though most of the movie. Just good entertainment. Not appropriate for kids, language is pretty rough. Give it a try!",1390953600,,127,4.818181818181818
5576146,3,B00BC36YWC,Good to watch when you can't sleep  every character makes you laugh at one point. Had a good time watching it.,1390953600,,110,4.238095238095238
5576147,5,B00BC36YWC,"I read all the critics' reviews saying this is a good movie, and really did not want to believe any of them, as the whole idea behind the movie seems lame.  But I was glad to be wrong.  I see them making a sequel to this one...hopefully they can keep all the same actors.",1390867200,,271,4.0
5576148,5,B00BC36YWC,Great interplay between Jennifer Aniston and Jason Sudeikis. Probably the funniest comedy i've seen in awhile. Definitely deserves the R rating due to coarse language,1390867200,,166,5.68
5576149,1,B00BC36YWC,"I found this movie to be crude and the filthy. It wasn't funny but offensive. I think if it was edited for the vulgarity, it would be  15 minutes long. HATED IT!!",1390867200,,162,4.0625
5576150,5,B00BC36YWC,"Oh man! I've watched this a few times now and It just gets better! Bravo to the entire cast.
On a side note, this is not in any way appropriate for children. However, the lude jokes and snarky comments are not extravagant so if need be, they could very easily be fast forwarded past. Enjoy!",1390867200,,290,4.290909090909091

5576155,5,B00BC36YWC,Rented it to watch on plane.  Made the flight very easy to endure.  The casting was well balanced.  I recommend this to anyone.,1390867200,,127,4.434782608695652
5576156,2,B00BC36YWC,I was disappointed in this movie. I thought with the cast it would be much better than it was. At times it was cute but most of the time is was just plain dumb. I would not recommend this movie.,1390867200,,194,3.875
5576157,2,B00BC36YWC,"I would rate this movie as a X rated film.  It was not funny and the plot was old as the hills.

Glad that I did not have top pay to see this movie.  I last thought, don't watch the trailers because I have found them to be misleading.",1390867200,,234,3.7346938775510203

5576162,3,B00BC36YWC,"Was funny,love Jennifer,just could have been done with a few less ""F bombs"".. Not a prude but Hollywood seems to have to be colorful,with no other words available in the English language,and thinks thats what main stream USA wants...",1390867200,,233,5.0

5576168,4,B00BC36YWC,"As far as the movie goes, it was a good laugh - not a 'family' movie if you have young children, due to language and content, but it was really funny.
We had issues with the streaming.  We were interrupted a least a dozen times with long pauses and it made for a rather unpleasant experience.  This doesn't always happen, but I've been noticing it more and more with Amazon. :(",1390780800,,377,4.295774647887324

The language was crude and tiring.  The humor was scant - although I do recall laughing once towards the end.
I give this move one star because that's the lowest the scale allows.
Start to rent this 4 or 5 times but then stop yourself each time; take the money you would have spent on those rentals and go by a burger and fries.  It will be a much better experience on the front end and will leave you far more satisfied.",1390262400,,647,4.119047619047619

5576238,4,B00BC36YWC,"Comedy these days is tricky.  There are so many films out there that blur those lines to the point where finding a comedy that is undoubtedly funny can be difficult.  What is comedy?  What is funny?  Why are there so many dramedies, and what does that even mean anymore?  Why is Adam Sandler still making movies?  Every once in a while though, a film comes along that pretty much defines comedy, that recklessly throws laughs your way, all caution to the wind, balls to the wall, git er done attitude that makes you smile ear to ear.

I cant promise perfection, but this is clearly comedy!

Conceptually, this sounds like something that really shouldnt work.  I mean, it is so ridiculous in concept that it really feels and looks like something that should crash and burn in the first act.  Thankfully, the trailer delivered a smidgen of hope in a cast that looked really up to par with the outlandish material, because if it hadnt been for the cleverly cut trailer, I may have passed on this entirely.

Im glad that I didnt.

Were the Millers tells the story of David Clark, an immature and self-centered man who never grew up.  He still sells pot and lives in a pretty crumby apartment building.  When his neighbor Kenny decides he wants to save a hobo from a group of thugs, David winds up getting beaten and robbed and essentially screwed since he now owes his boss, Brad Gurdlinger, a lot of money.  That is when he is given an ultimatum; go to Mexico and pick up a smidgen of weed, or die.  Enlisting the help of the neighbor boy, the hobo and a stripper who lives in his building, David disguises himself as a family man taking a trip to Mexico in their RV.  Getting in is easy, but getting out with a lot more than a smidgen, while being tailed by a pretty crazy family, is going to be difficult.

Now, Im going to ask a question.  Have you seen RV?  You know, that 2006 Robin Williams comedy.  Well, these two films are essentially the same film, only this one has drugs and cursing.  Seriously, they are pretty much the same thing.  I will admit to finding RV rather hilarious, but there is something to be said for inappropriate humor and Jason Sudeikis dry sense of delivery.  This movie works so well!

My only real qualm here is that the film is too long.  At nearly two hours, the final act stretches itself thin and really should have been trimmed.  It isn't without moments of hilarity, but the film starts to feel like it is running out of steam.

But MY GOD this ensemble is brilliant.  Jennifer Aniston is perfection here, proving once again that her charm works just as well on the big screen as it did on the small.  Newcomer Will Poulter is spot on here and should have a big career if he can find the right roles, avoiding being typecast (which I fear will happen to him).  Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn have that crazy RV family on lock, and Jason Sudeikis anchors this movie with all the right inflections of humor.  Really though, this movie is all about Emma Roberts (possibly the funniest performance Ive seen all year) and Ed Helms (brilliant) who bring the funny in so many ways.  Helms has a few scenes, but they are some of the funniest.  His line delivery alone is fantastic.  But Roberts is MVP here, and I never thought Id say that.

If you want something that is just straight up comedy, with absolutely nothing held back, then this is the film for you.",1390262400,,3391,4.439222042139384

We purchased it as it was barely a couple dollars more than renting it.  My brother in law really enjoyed it, I will probably just give it to him.  I was surprised Jennifer Aniston took this role.

5576300,3,B00BC36YWC,The movie was simple and the plot has been done before many times with other actors. But here you have Jennifer Anninston who has anyone noticed is a great comedic actress? I am not familiar with the rest of the cast but they were also very funny in their delivery. For me Ms. Anninston carried the movie. She is really a good comedic actress.,1389830400,,343,4.375

5576311,1,B00BC36YWC,"I'm really shocked at all the more positive reviews on here as this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, the only time I laughed is when they sang the theme song from Friends the rest was just sick raunchy humor.  I could not get over the change in Jennifer Aniston as her face looked like it was full of collagen and all through watching this I kept thinking what was she thinking doing this movie as it was beyond bad!",1389744000,,429,4.107142857142857

5576316,2,B00BC36YWC,"The movie was fine, reasonably funny, if predictable. Predictable in the way that it felt like we were just plugging new characters and a new setting into a comedic formula that had been used and re-used often in hollywood.

The video service however was disappointing. I streamed this using the same TV and internet connection that I regularly use to stream netflix content (tv and movies, in SD and HD) without issue. Unfortunately, this movie had to stop MULTIPLE times to buffer or load, as the screen would say ""loading movie"" and show a progress bar. Some of these interruptions lasted multiple minutes, and they definitely made the viewing experience less enjoyable. I hope amazon is able to address this service issue going forward.",1389744000,,740,4.967741935483871
5576317,5,B00BC36YWC,This movie from beginning to end is funny. Jennifer Aniston plays a good part in this movie with other stars which is interesting. All four people become drug smugglers which takes them to Mexico and back.,1389744000,,205,4.722222222222222
5576318,5,B00BC36YWC,Really loved this movie.  It was very funny and I could watch it over and over again.  It is such a good thing to see Jennifer Aniston in a movie like this.,1389744000,,156,3.84375

5576321,5,B00BC36YWC,Funny as ever and Jennifer is sexy as always  I would highly recommend. Kid singing Waterfall still cracks me up,1389744000,,112,4.6
5576322,3,B00BC36YWC,"the ideas behind who these characters are and what events occur  are good but don't make the mark. Jennifer Aniston is beautiful but the striptease scene was trying too hard to be funny. It was not at all believable that a drug lord will be overpowered by any one woman's or stripper's seduction attempts. Jennifer Aniston sold that part better than anyone in the world would be able to and made a character that could have been 1-sided or cartoonish into a legitimate and very likable character. It was awesome to see Jason Sudekis  where he looked like a college pot dealer.  The other actors were good too but a lot of other story elements were just too unrealistic to me. As another example, I have a very hard time believing that Sudekis and the family would not have been arrested and charged for the drug offenses despite helping law enforcement catch way more severe criminals.  It was still really funny and a AMAZING cast [the guy from Parks and Rec is HILARIOUS and the actress playing his wife, she was on SNL for a long time, is HILARIOUS] Watch it for the amazing acting. They are all comedic geniuses",1389657600,,1115,4.56
5576323,5,B00BC36YWC,Hilarious film but was really hoping to see more of Jennifer Aniston's great body....Wouldn't mind seeing the body of the little blonde either....I have NO RAGRETS watching this film!!!!,1389657600,,186,5.448275862068965
5576324,1,B00BC36YWC,"It was so bad I did not watch the whole things. It full of profanity.
Sexually inappropriate terrible show.

5576325,5,B00BC36YWC,"We were pretty much counting on the film being funny with Jason Sudeikis in the cast.

Such a hilarious movie, great lines, sweet moments...what more could you ask for.",1389657600,,261,4.822222222222222
5576326,3,B00BC36YWC,it was exactly as I thought and I enjoyed it. Lots of laughs. Simple and predictable plot but played out well with the whole cast. They are pretty much all loveable. At the end of the movie you will feel good and you will have a smile on your face.,1389657600,,248,3.98

5576329,1,B00BC36YWC,"I can't believe so many people liked this movie. I made the mistake of buying it because Jennifer Aniston was in it. I won't make that mistake again. Is this the really the thing that most people like now days, it was raunchy all the way through. I guess I must be getting old. I felt the same way about the movie The Heat.",1389657600,,323,4.0625

5576335,5,B00BC36YWC,Well worth the watch. Some parts are cheesy but the other bits are well developed. There are some parts of the movie that just had me and my wife cracking.,1389657600,,155,4.2

5576345,1,B00BC36YWC,"Not a good movie in my opionion,  Crude.  The ""father"" suggests the son have sex in exchange for money with a stranger and the ""mother"" and ""daughter"" kiss the son.  Not a good movie like I said.  Not good, junk for the mind.",1389657600,,225,4.162790697674419

Aniston is wonderful in the film - really enjoyed her in the part of the ""mother."" The rest of the cast is also fantastic as well. Just when you think this film may have no redeaming qualities- it proves you wrong. I loved it. Made me ""Belly laugh"" out loud. I strongly recommend that you see; if you haven't already!",1389571200,,418,4.048192771084337

The casting was great and I never thought Jennifer Aniston would pull off such a role, but she was wonderful as were all the other actors in this movie.  I'm definitely ordering this one for my blu-ray collection!",1389484800,,482,3.9381443298969074

5576392,3,B00BC36YWC,Formulaic comedy adventure centered around pot smuggling losers.  An okay way to wile away two hours with your family if watching stoner jokes is the only way to keep the kids in the same room as mom and dad.,1389398400,,208,4.333333333333333

5576414,1,B00BC36YWC,"There was quite a bit of good humor in some parts.  Then again, I could watch Jennifer Aniston read the phone book and be entertained.

The pimping out of children for homosexual prostitution in Mexico was kinda creepy and just poor taste.  There are certain things that are just not funny.",1389312000,,290,4.647058823529412
5576415,4,B00BC36YWC,"I was prepared for another Jennifer Aniston comedy. You know that formulated script that makes her out to be the goody goody or the imposed upon heroine or friend. Well, this one is different. While she really should have gone to a couple of strip clubs to see how real dancers  work, she does an acceptable job, not alway believable, but acceptable. As a comedy its pretty funny. Not as good as Parental Guidence or Ted, but worth watching.",1389312000,,441,4.582278481012659

This is not for the prudish or easily offended folks. Very good acting and pretty darn good writing. A few corny moments but always back to hilarity and off the wall humor. Jennifer is looking pretty darn good these days! I definitely recommend this one if you need a laugh or two..or three..",1389312000,,422,4.4935064935064934

5576419,5,B00BC36YWC,A very funny movie with a first class cast.  The combo pack is a good bargain.  You can keep one and give the other to someone else.  The movie is very entertaining and well worth buying!!,1389225600,,188,4.166666666666667
5576420,5,B00BC36YWC,Very funny.  We Really Enjoyed The Young Actor That Played The Son In The Movie. I Have No Idea Who He Is  But  the scene withThe Spider Bite Was Hysterical.,1389225600,,157,4.166666666666667

5576424,3,B00BC36YWC,"Worth the rent. I laughed, my wife laughed. Nothing new here to be had, pretty predictable. Sometimes over the top. But overall I'd say it's worth an hour and a half of your time.",1389225600,,179,4.294117647058823
5576425,4,B00BC36YWC,"This was so funny!  I liked Jennifer Aniston the best, probably because this is a character I've never seen her in.  I enjoyed how it was a full-blown comedy and it didn't turn into a cheesy romantic comedy.",1389225600,,207,4.421052631578948

5576432,5,B00BC36YWC,I saw this movie in theaters twice. It's really entertaining. I have 2 teenage step-kids and It is the only movie that we've watched together that they didn't text through and my husband and I didn't sleep through .,1389225600,,215,4.538461538461538

5576437,3,B00BC36YWC,This looked like a silly comedy to take your mind off of whatever happens to be stressing you out - and it was.  JS was the familiar and like-able funny guy next door as usual and JA was entertaining as always.  You'll get your yearly FDA allotment of prosthetic man junk in full HD - but that seems to be the 'go to' shocker in family friendly movies these days.  I still want to see Sudeikis take on a serious role someday - but for now I'll take the laughs.,1389225600,,460,4.088888888888889

5576465,2,B00BC36YWC,This movie was not funny. I gave it a two star rating for the occassional chuckle which still didn't make it worth watching in its entirety.,1389139200,2,140,4.423076923076923

5576469,2,B00BC36YWC,Great idea but base and tasteless humor destroyed it for me. Encouraging a kid to suck a police officer's dick. Really?,1389139200,,119,4.714285714285714

5576490,3,B00BC36YWC,"It was ok, it is rated R for very good reasons. I started to watch it with our 15 year old granddaughter and ended up saving it for another time when she wasn't here. There is so much swearing, it surprised me! There are a couple strong sexual scenes that made me blush (not easy to do) but they were done with no nudity! Like I said, it's rated for a reason, or two, or three.",1389052800,,377,3.973684210526316
5576491,4,B00BC36YWC,One of the funniest films I have seen this year without being overly obnoxious and in your face. Good acting and well paired cast make this a worthwhile watch. This is still a frat guy type movie however.,1389052800,,204,4.394736842105263

5576494,3,B00BC36YWC,This movie was funny - I don't understand why there had to be soooo much adult language.  It was not necessary.,1389052800,,111,4.285714285714286
5576495,4,B00BC36YWC,Very Funny movie start to end! Make sure ya watch the quick out takes too! Jennifer Aniston is becoming quite funny too after her comedy in Horrible Bosses,1389052800,,155,4.571428571428571

5576499,4,B00BC36YWC,I thought this was a funny movie. Not one of the best I've seen recently but a good one to watch if you're looking for a comedy. Actors do a pretty good job in it.,1388966400,,163,3.6857142857142855
5576500,3,B00BC36YWC,I am a huge fan of this movie genre but this one was just okay for me.  It has it's funny moments but I am glad we rented it instead of going to the theaters.,1388966400,,158,3.5142857142857142
5576501,1,B00BC36YWC,Yes there were a few laughs but just trash!!! Sad to see people waste their talents and time on making it!!,1388966400,2,107,4.142857142857143
5576502,5,B00BC36YWC,I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good comedy! Great movie to curl up on the couch and watch with a bowl full of popcorn...careful not to spit out the kernels when your belting out in uncontrollable laughter!,1388966400,,219,4.5
5576503,4,B00BC36YWC,Bought it for my husband as a Christmas gift and he was ecstatic.  We loved it in the theater and couldn't wait to see it again.,1388966400,,128,3.923076923076923

5576505,4,B00BC36YWC,"It starts off really bad,boring and so painfully slow. In the middle it improves some good laughs. Desperate for a comedy, hang in there with this one it does improve enough to qualify as a decent comedy.",1388966400,,204,4.54054054054054
5576506,5,B00BC36YWC,"A comedian movie that reminded me of National Lampoons Vacation from 1983! This movie was so funny at times I had to pause my PS3 yes I watched it on my PS3 I mean why not!? Sony has the new app from Amazon where you can now streaming movies nice one! But warning to all you parents out there I would say this movie is for the mature crowd if you know what I mean? Its rated Rate R-
So I would have to say 17+up! Anyway a great flick to watch just not for kids! B+++++ I give it that due to the mature content and overly excessive swearing!",1388966400,,540,3.918181818181818

5576510,5,B00BC36YWC,"I rarely pay to see a movie anymore. However, I decided to see if this one would be nearly as good as the previews made it sound. AND I'M SOOO GLAD I DID!!! I haven't laughed so hard in a long time over a movie. Yes it's full of ""stupid funny humor"" but there is ""stupid"" humor and then there is ""stupid funny"" humor. I hope to never be too old or too stuffy to enjoy (and admit to enjoying:) ""crazy and silly""  in my life. (And I'm pretty darn old...in calender years...But who's counting... :) Speaking of ageless...Jennifer is a perfect example! (Me...not nearly so much:)",1388966400,,575,4.373831775700935
5576511,4,B00BC36YWC,"Best moment is in the following credits when the ""Friends"" theme song starts playing!

The actual movie is chock-a-block cliches but that is to be expected.

5576515,4,B00BC36YWC,"The movie itself was very funny and entertaining. I'm just frustrated that a relatively new Dell Studio laptop is not considered an approved HD device, so when I connect my laptop to my TV with an HDMI cable I must watch it in SD.  This is not the case with Netflix.  Until Amazon addresses this issues, I will only rent movies from them that are not available thru Netflix.",1388966400,,374,4.405797101449275
5576516,1,B00BC36YWC,"Not recommended.  Seems like the film tried (but did not succeed) to duplicate the venue of humor in the first  ""Hangover"" film. Jokes were extremely lame and juvenile.  I regretted renting this albatross for the eyes.",1388966400,2,218,5.0
5576517,3,B00BC36YWC,Overall I didn't mind the movie.  Jason is always funny!  I don't know if I could recommend it to everyone.,1388966400,,107,4.3

5576520,4,B00BC36YWC,"I knew virtually nothing about this film before renting it on Amazon after browsing for something my daughter and I could agree on due to our 35 year age gap! A few minutes into the movie after the plot line becomes clear we started to laugh and by the end of the movie agreed it was a great choice. The main actors had great comedic timing and although the lifestyle of characters they portray are ones you're not likely to find out here in suburbia, I found myself rooting for them as they slowly become the quirky Miller family.",1388966400,,531,4.373737373737374
5576521,4,B00BC36YWC,"Not sure why is flick has had mixed reviews. My wife, a relative prude, loved it. I loved the pace and fresh humor. It contains a ton of contemporary slapstick-level humor, but the level of new creativity matches the ensemble playing of the four main actors (which is glorious at many points). We loved it. I suspect you will too.",1388966400,2,330,4.516666666666667

5576523,4,B00BC36YWC,"I enjoyed We're the Millers.

I thought it was funnier than most movies that come out and are supposed to be comedies nowadays.

5576530,2,B00BC36YWC,Had they taken a little more time to write the script and work on the acting this could have been a better movie.  Classic cheap movie with the associated cheap movie qualities.  The boy is the best actor of the 4 key actors.  Teenage humor at best.,1388966400,2,249,4.25531914893617

5576533,1,B00BC36YWC,"Disaster of a movie, how anybody can rate this 5 or 4 stars is beyond me. Hollywood seems to be in a competition which directors/producers can use the most f-words in a minute. The language was disgusting, the main characters a drug dealer and a stripper - is this really the American family?? If this combination was used to be so far out to induce insane laughter after each crude scene and f-bomb it failed miserably. The story was unbelievable stupid with cliches that have been done (and better) lots of times (Latin drug cartel). Don't waste your money on this stinker.",1388966400,3,575,4.647058823529412
5576534,3,B00BC36YWC,"I gave this movie one star for each time I laughed (just minor laughs at that).  ""We're the Millers"" is a disappointment, even for $3.99.  I am so glad I waited to see this on instant video.  This movie is not appropriate for children either.  The sexual content (strip tease scenes and dialog) may make some adults cringe.  The casting was excellent and the actors did their best with a mediocre script.",1388966400,,404,4.555555555555555

It's got it's own feel to it that can't be attributed to any other comedies. Yes it's raunchy, and has a ton of drugs but whats a pot comedy without ridiculous amounts of both.

5576550,4,B00BC36YWC,"Went into this movie thinking I wasn't going to like it, but I enjoyed watching Aniston in this new/different role (a stripper).  I think she really pulled it off and showed that she doesn't always have to play the part of the girl next door.  I recommend not watching this movie with children (13 and under=too young!). I laughed more times than I thought I would.  I enjoyed the Miller's ""adventure""--fun movie!",1388880000,,413,4.708333333333333

5576552,5,B00BC36YWC,"Hilarious!  This movie was so funny. Never a dull moment. Need to note though, this is not a family movie. There is a lot of ""F"" bombs. Normally, I don't care for  all the cursing, but it didn't feel like it was just thrown in just to make sure it received an R rating, if that makes any since. I really enjoyed the plot and thought all the main characters worked will together and did a great job acting. They have great chemistry!",1388880000,,432,4.192771084337349

5576556,5,B00BC36YWC,"Jennifer Aniston is at her best when she's in a comedy. Not just a romantic comedy but a comedy where she can be extra filthy in her dialogue coming from a sweet angelic face really makes the delivery all the better.  But come on Nick Offerman is a standout in this, the tent scene alone had me rolling. While I'm sure many men were focused on the two girls, I couldn't stop watching ""Ron Swanson"" So flipping funny.

Funny, crass and inappropriate on all levels. Just like I like my comedies.",1388880000,,493,4.406593406593407

All the characters shined, great ending.",1388880000,,121,5.1
5576560,3,B00BC36YWC,This is somewhat funny though its combination of crudity and sentimentality make for a strange combination.  Definitely not for families and not for those looking for any sensitivity in the representation of minority characters.,1388880000,,228,5.705882352941177

5576562,5,B00BC36YWC,Film had me laughing from the start to end with a few awes thrown in for good measure. I would watch it again. As everyone in my house is older there are a few cover the kids eyes but defiantly not for a younger crowd.,1388880000,,218,3.8666666666666667

5576573,1,B00BC36YWC,A perverted creep made this movie. How could anyone enjoy this? Way too corrupt and disturbed for myself to even try to enjoy. The language was also distasteful and made no sense half the time because it was mostly only curse words.,1388793600,3,232,4.5476190476190474

5576576,4,B00BC36YWC,"It was pretty funny but as most comedies do, it went a little overboard with some obvious and juvenile jokes. Not Hangover funny but better than a lot of the stuff that's out there. If I had the choice, I would give it 3.5 stars",1388793600,,228,4.088888888888889

5576587,5,B00BC36YWC,Probably the funniest movie I have seen in years!  Recommend to watch it several times because you'll miss some funny moments while you are laughing from a previous scene.  This one I'll have to buy on DVD for sure as part of my collection. Can't wait for the sequel :),1388793600,,269,4.36

After finally deciding on a movie none of us had already seen, the group was pleasantly surprised.
With occasional subtle wit to quite-funny sight gags, we were glad to have rented this.

I didn't.  First off, let me say that I don't mind raunchy comedy.  Bridesmaids, Team America- very funny.  This movie goes for the raunchy laughs over and over and over and misses every time.  Original?  My kids used to watch the Robin Williams movie ""RV"".  Had they gone back and re-edited that movie and put a bag of dope in the place of a laptop, the movie wouldn't be that different with the nutty other RV family.  This is really a terrible movie.  Even when it tries to pull everything together at the end with the obligatory happy ending it fails to get much more than a wince over how shabbily done it is.  Ms. Aniston seems disinterested to me.  Maybe that is her character, or maybe she realized how lame this movie was going to turn out.",1388793600,2,920,4.392857142857143

It's a noun!  It's a plane writing the word over and over in the sky throughout the whole movie.  It should have gotten screen credits as a co-star.  Anniston, the stripper with a heart of gold who's really a good mom underneath those boy-short panties and tiny bra, gamely tries to insert some energy into this lackluster, derivative piece of nonsense.  Every tired old sexual situation joke was trotted out like an ancient old donkey that had been ridden too many times.  I didn't come close to laughing even ONCE.  I am mystified as to why so many of the reviewers enjoyed this piece of tripe so much.

At least this movie wants to be a good movie, but since none of the actors except for the Mexican mother who gave the fruit to the 'family' didn't have any interest in acting for this movie but only collecting a sweet paycheck, the intoxicated writers were intensely let down.

My suggestion: save your money and donate it to a needy family. At least your money will make someone happy, and you won't be further tempted to watch this movie.

Disregard the comments if you are a teenage male. This movie will be incredibly funny to you, but don't let your parents watch it with you or any girls with whom you are interested. Your parents will ground you. The girls will shun you afterwards.",1388793600,5,786,4.489510489510489

And yes, we've watched it several times at home as well.  Tons of fun!",1388707200,,370,4.169014084507042

5576637,1,B00BC36YWC,Worst movie I ever watched. Absolutely apathetic acting at best throughout the movie. Waste of my money. Looks like the producers and directors expected to score a hit just based on Anistons pole dance,1388707200,,201,4.9411764705882355

5576647,4,B00BC36YWC,One of Jennifer Aniston's better movies.  Very similar to just go with it (also very funny).  The premise is kind of weak but some of the situations will have you rolling on the floor,1388707200,,183,4.352941176470588

I thought , now here's a movie that was made to keep a lot of people working and getting a fat paycheck .  Jason Sedeikas's impression of Chevy Chase was pretty good though .  Jen In under wear is pretty good too , but for the whole movie , just a waste ,  unless of course you're in middle school , young kids will get a giggle out of it .  They could have thrown in a few  'PoopyJokes ' .",1388707200,,504,3.854368932038835

Every character is like a caricature, and none of them were likeable, with the exception of the very funny Ken Marino, who should have been in it longer.  The closing scene where everybody has their arm around each other was cringe-inducing and felt like the end of a Broadway play when the actors take a bow.",1388620800,2,370,4.426470588235294
5576663,5,B00BC36YWC,Don't like to invest in a night out at the movies. Much prefer to stay in and watch in the comfort of my pjs and my own couch.  This was very funny.,1388620800,,148,3.625

5576670,5,B00BC36YWC,"Jesus she is lookin good! Not only do you get to see Aniston playing stripper for most of the movie but the movie itself is really funny and entertaining as well. I totally wish she would have gone totally topless in one scene but the film had too much ""bad language"" and we get to see swollen teen prosthetic dick and balls. Add tits to that and you've got a nc-17 rating and that just doesn't fly for a light hearted main stream movie. If given the choice I would choose aniston's tits over teen balls any day but that scene was so funny I couldn't imagine it not being in the movie. Not that aniston would've gone topless anyway.",1388620800,2,632,4.275

As good as Jennifer Aniston looks she performs a gratuitous strip/pole scene that was awkward to see.

5576721,1,B00BC36YWC,It just wasn't funny to me.  No exciting storyline and too raunchy for my taste. Total waste of my money.,1388448000,2,105,4.25

5576723,4,B00BC36YWC,"Really enjoyed the movie. It was funny and Jennifer Anniston was great as usual, but the language left me a little put off. I am no prude. I am a retired Navy sailor and used to salty language but this was a bit over the top with the vulgarity. Not a good date night movie if you are dating a nice young women.",1388448000,,310,3.9365079365079363

5576725,4,B00BC36YWC,"Jason Sudeikis and the kid with the eyebrows make this movie worth watching.  Emma Roberts steps out of her typical role to play this foul-mouthed street-wise girl.  Jennifer Aniston is OK.  Lots of laughs at totally inappropriate situations.  Rated R with good reason.  The plot is thin, but the laughs carry it along nicely.",1388448000,,326,4.962962962962963

5576728,4,B00BC36YWC,"Even though there were a few situations that were blatantly deus ex machina, and I found myself forcefully having to suspend disbelief, I laughed out loud so often, these few interspersed irritants became forgivable. Jennifer Aniston was quite entertaining and very funny. There is a teenage (or young adult?) character mid-way through the film that is not to be missed!",1388448000,,370,5.183333333333334

was unexpected comedy from Jennifer Addison.",1388448000,,166,4.758620689655173

5576732,3,B00BC36YWC,"This movie had a few funny one liners, but overall it was pretty lackluster.  I've enjoyed many of Jennifer Aniston's previous comedies, but this was not one of the better ones.

5576734,3,B00BC36YWC,"I watched this after all the five star reviews I saw on here.  However half way through it was a typical comedy, nothing too exciting.

I came in for low expectations, and was itching for a funny comedy, and was very pleasantly surprised by how cute this movie was. I explained it as ""phenomenal"" to a coworker, who looked at me like I was crazy, so perhaps that is overstating it, but it was definitely a feel good film.",1388361600,,343,4.4603174603174605

5576757,4,B00BC36YWC,"I quite enjoyed this one. All in all it was really well done, although the choreographer for Aniston maybe should have choreographed for the actress and not just the part. I really appreciated that the characters stayed true to their setup throughout, versus (as characters are apt to do in movies like this) becoming totally different people in the end.

Ed Helms was a great in his brief appearances. Katherine Hahn was, as always, perfection, and Nick Offerman is completely awesome.",1388361600,,486,5.0

Even if your acquainted with Pot Culture from some period in your Life, this isn't even a funny Stoner Movie, it's just Dumb!

Bad acting, unoriginal, cliche, uninteresting, stupid, waste of money renting...

Between the raucous parts there are moments of legitimate tenderness that are earned and not fake.  The cast is universally excellent but special kudos go out to Aniston who is finding a second life in these rauchfests.  See ""Horrible Bosses"" where she was a riot playing a randy dentist.  Poulter is rather sweet as the clueless kid and should be a talent to be on the lookout for.

5576861,5,B00BC36YWC,"WE'RE THE MILLERS (2013) with Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston, Emma Roberts and Will Poulter is a weird road picture where a smalltime pot dealer, in order to satisfy a debt to his supplier (an old college buddy), has to pick up a ""smidge-and-a-half"" of weed in Mexico and transport it back. He hatches a crazy scheme where he and three people he barely knows pretend to be a family as they cross the border in a humongous RV. The dealer's faux relations: an unemployed stripper who can't stand him, a homeless teen girl with a bad attitude, and a dorky boy her age whose klutziness is only exceeded by his lack of experience with the opposite sex.

This bit of weed they're picking up turns out to be two metric tons! It's stashed in every possible hiding place in their house on wheels. Two complications immediately occur:
1.) The pot actually belongs to a Mexican druglord (our unknowing dealer was conned by his buddy into stealing it) and he wants it back.
2.) Their motorhome blows a hose on a 10 incline. The family of fellow RVers that stops to assist is headed by a DEA agent on vacation!

There's a lot of very in your face things that you laugh about when your intoxicated but not enough clever jokes for those who are sober and past the ""he said penis"" giggling phase.

I am not easily offended by language and wasn't by this but, at the same time, neither my wife nor I felt it added any thing qualitative to the film. Overall, it was a good adult comedy and I would watch it again because I'm pretty sure I missed some of the jokes.

Although the plot is fairly predictable in this comedy, I found this movie to be surprisingly funny and entertaining.  I will admit that I am not normally a bit Jennifer Aniston fan, I did find her funny in the role as the stripper turned housewife and mother.  I did find it a stretch though that she would be playing the stripper though but she does ham it up for the camera and makes it funny.

There is some crass humor, male nudity jokes and some cringe worthy moments but overall I found myself laughing and amused at this comedy.

Although maybe not a classic but worth watching at least.",1387843200,,768,4.3426573426573425

Janniston is not believable as a stripper until the dance in the middle, and of course the two tons of weed ont cause anyone to smell like weed (riiiight) so the stash goes undetected by DEA agent. Sure, dope. Hey, don't change your names when going into witness protection either. That wouldnt be wise...or would it. Have you seen Austin Powers, the Hangover, Bounty Hunter?

5576938,3,B00BC36YWC,"Great idea.  Great acting.  Mediocre execution.  There a few laugh out loud moments.  Not many.  They try to play up the stripper aspect of Aniston's character, but she just kind of stands around or walks around.  Not really a Demi Moore moment here, guys.

That said, the actors play their parts very well.  The characters are all likable and interesting to watch, but they don't do much that leads to hilarity.

I wish they had just given the reigns to real comedians and had them write the story.  How is it that comedians like J. Sudeikis can SAY things off the cuff that floor you, but they pop geniuses like him in movies that are bland and dull!?!  Guys like him SHOULD BE WRITING THE COMEDIES!

Anyway, this is not a comedy you will want to re-watch.  It is barely worth a rental.  Again, only because the actors all try really hard, in my opinion.",1387756800,,856,4.438709677419355

If you like your comedy without vulgarity then you may want to skip this movie. If you have nothing else to do for the evening and want a few laughs then that is what you will get, a few laughs.

I can't sit for that long to watch a movie on my computer due to a bad back. I totally wasted my money! I don't give the movie a bad rating just the purchase,1387670400,,288,3.8983050847457625
5576970,1,B00BC36YWC,This movie is awful and not worth the money!  No funny and boring.  2 hours I will never get back.,1387670400,3,98,3.85
5576971,4,B00BC36YWC,This is a very funny film; I really enjoyed it since for some reason I can never find anything funny to watch.,1387670400,,110,4.045454545454546
5576972,4,B00BC36YWC,It was a fun and memorable film that had given the wow factor. It was a good time movie but no more than four stars,1387670400,,115,3.64
5576973,4,B00BC36YWC,"I missed the ending of this movie, had issues downloading it to my kindle... but I think there were some very funny parts that made me laugh out loud. I would watch it again just to see what I missed while I was laughing.",1387584000,,221,4.045454545454546

5576976,5,B00BC36YWC,I was happy that it was not overly trashy.  We totally enjoyed the movie.  Jennifer Aniston is always sweet in all her rolls.,1387584000,,125,4.391304347826087
5576977,4,B00BC36YWC,very good and very funny. probably not suitable for children. the comedy keeps you going continually throughout the movie making it very entertaining,1387584000,,149,5.521739130434782
5576978,3,B00BC36YWC,"It just doesn't make it.  The entire movie you are looking for Chevy Chase, John Candy, or one of the other great SLN personalities.  The acting was ok, good even, but they need to invent their own movie.",1387584000,2,204,4.342105263157895
5576979,3,B00BC36YWC,"Had a few laughs out loud during the movie but overall it's just an ok movie.  Wait for it to go on sale and rent it when you have nothing else to watch.  The actors are all good, the storyline is stupid.",1387584000,,204,3.8333333333333335
5576980,5,B00BC36YWC,"Unexpectedly funny in some subtle, passive aggressive ways.  And then the over-the-top scenes catch you off guard for max effect.

Though this nit of mine has no bearing on the movie whatsoever.... Why did the movie claim a scene at Tucson International Airport when it clearly was not. I think it might have been Albuquerque, so just say it???",1387584000,,344,4.813559322033898
5576981,5,B00BC36YWC,"This movie is hilarious!  Not for young kids, though.  There are many situations which should only be viewed by 15 and older crowd.  This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time.",1387584000,,195,4.216216216216216

5576983,4,B00BC36YWC,"Refreshing comedy with Jennifer Aniston. I think the story starts slow, but once they become the Millers is when it becomes good.",1387584000,,129,4.909090909090909
5576984,5,B00BC36YWC,This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while.  It has become a family favorite for our family,1387584000,,106,3.8181818181818183
5576985,2,B00BC36YWC,"Didn't see any chemistry among actors. Felt like I'd seen this sort of storyline explored over and over again in more interesting ways. Sorry we wasted any time on it, let alone money.",1387584000,2,184,4.606060606060606

5576987,4,B00BC36YWC,funny with a moral at the end.  Great casting. Jennifer A is suited well for these types of comedies.  The nerdy boy is well played - reminds me of the poor kid in high school who was always getting pushed in the lockers.,1387584000,,221,4.116279069767442
5576988,5,B00BC36YWC,"Loved it!!! Loved it!!!  Loved it!!!  Not that I'm a drug dealer, but it was so dead on in the way good people act in crazy situations.",1387584000,,135,3.962962962962963
5576989,1,B00BC36YWC,"What an awful movie.  Not sure why I even rented it. Typical stupid Jennifer Aniston movie. Yikes, what was a thinking?",1387497600,5,119,4.666666666666667

5576992,5,B00BC36YWC,This was a great movie and I can't understand why it didn't get any awards. Love the movie and it was wrapped and never been used.,1387497600,,130,4.038461538461538
5576993,5,B00BC36YWC,"Yes, it WAS predictable...but you still want to watch THIS one. Love the ""spyder bite"" scene.  It WAS worth renting.",1387497600,,116,4.8
5576994,5,B00BC36YWC,This movie was so funny we laughed the whole hour and half.  Especially the part with the spider bite.  Seeing Jennifer Aniston dance was a bonus!  The fellow RV family was too hysterical.,1387497600,,188,4.636363636363637
5576995,1,B00BC36YWC,"Very very crude. ALOT, ALOT OF  sex talk. Nothing really like preview. Stopped watching after couple of minutes because I couldn't stand it",1387497600,3,139,5.043478260869565
5576996,4,B00BC36YWC,"I watched this because Jen Anniston was in it but, I was delighted to find that I enjoyed it throughout.  It's funny and the ending is appropriate.",1387497600,,147,4.444444444444445

5576998,4,B00BC36YWC,"Picked it based on trailer and cast.
Very funny plus warm story plus great Jennifer Aniston strip scene.
What more could you want ?",1387497600,,131,4.5
5576999,2,B00BC36YWC,"Not as good as I had hoped. Like most comedies, all the funniest parts were in the trailer. It was still fun, and Jennifer Anniston is smoking hot, so I guess it's a win",1387497600,,169,4.0
5577000,4,B00BC36YWC,Watched this one with my husband and we laughed a lot! Recommended if you like silly humor. The clips at the end were hilarious!,1387497600,,128,4.375
5577001,5,B00BC36YWC,"At first I was afraid all of the funny moments if this movie would have been what was shown in the trailer, but this movie really has so much to offer. It kept me laughing the entire time, even into the credits with the bloopers. If you like this style of comedy, I'd highly reccomend it.",1387497600,,288,4.160714285714286
5577002,4,B00BC36YWC,Movie had a lot of laughs. 4 misfits come together to create a fake family in order to smuggle drugs across the border.  Had a lot of slap stick humor as well as some sentiment. I would recommend this movie to a friend.,1387497600,,219,4.093023255813954
5577003,1,B00BC36YWC,"I wanted to like this as I'm a fan of Jason Sudekis and liked Aniston in Horrible Bosses.  However, even Aniston as a stripper couldn't keep me engrossed.  Bad writing sunk this from the start and I had to stop watching.",1387497600,3,220,4.341463414634147
5577004,5,B00BC36YWC,"This was a great movie. I laughed thru most of it. A lot is stupid comedy. If that's what you like, you need to see this one. I even watched it twice.",1387497600,,150,3.71875
5577005,5,B00BC36YWC,Very funny movie love it. Highly recommend it!  Interesting twist and turns.  You may find you want to watch it over and over again.,1387497600,,132,4.458333333333333
5577006,4,B00BC36YWC,"Incredibly funny movie! Glad I waited until it came to rental... had to keep pausing and replaying scenes they were so funny.

5577008,5,B00BC36YWC,"I'm not usually a fan of Jennifer Anniston movies, but this one in particular had Nick Offerman, one of my favorite actors, in it, so I rented it. I laughed through out the entire movie! Drug smuggling fake family = great movie!",1387411200,,228,4.4523809523809526
5577009,5,B00BC36YWC,"great movie, We had seen it in the theater and loved it so much we had to buy it. Worth watching",1387411200,,96,3.619047619047619
5577010,4,B00BC36YWC,"This is just a fun movie.  Nothing serious.  Just lots of bad language and plenty of action.  It won't get an Oscar.  I saw it twice - first time with a bunch of guys.  Second time with my wife sitting in our living room.  She laughed through the whole movie.  If you're a prude, you won't like it.  If you're normal, you should enjoy it.",1387411200,,338,4.092307692307692
5577011,5,B00BC36YWC,"We enjoyed this movie a lot.  Totally geared to us (40-50 somethings).
We have no kids, not sure if you would want little kids watching this as there is a HYSTERICAL scene involving partial male nudity, and some mild sexual situations.
Really funny!",1387411200,,249,4.790697674418604
5577012,2,B00BC36YWC,was willing to pay 4 bucks assuming I would get some good laughs...was not very funny i think i giggled three times max.  and it was more of a (hehe ...pause...that was stupid) laughs....,1387411200,,187,4.5
5577013,5,B00BC36YWC,Great movie love it it was great can't wait for sequel. Jennifer anston is great thanks for the movie end,1387411200,,105,4.3
5577014,1,B00BC36YWC,horrible.  Couldn't even finish it. What I did watch was offensive and degrading.  What were the producers thinking to release it??,1387411200,3,131,5.190476190476191
5577015,2,B00BC36YWC,"There were some funny moments, but the language was horrid - hard to imagine sweet Jen Aniston having that potty mouth. Can't any producer ever write something without the vulgarities? And some of the crudeness in several scenes (which im not mentioning) were so distasteful! Sorry Jennifer! I love you and your acting, it's not you at all it's the producers with their writing and crudeness and language!",1387411200,2,405,4.970588235294118
5577016,5,B00BC36YWC,"This movie is funny and worth keeping! Who doesn't love a good drug smuggling mixed with crazy cartel's movie. Many laugh out loud scenes in this one. The movie gets 4.5 stars, but add another .5 star for Jennifer Annistons sexy stripper dances. HOT! This isn't Friends, this is Jenn at her best.",1387324800,,296,4.60377358490566
5577017,5,B00BC36YWC,"The movie was hilarious!  The 'family' were all down on their luck and pretty much had nothing to lose (mostly) and everything to gain by smuggling drugs over the border.  The adventure was never-ending 'what could go wrong; did go wrong' type of action.  Is a light, entertaining, movie.  Does have some use of profanity, but wasn't vulgar.  Watch it - you'll like it!",1387324800,,369,4.703125
5577018,5,B00BC36YWC,This is going to make the perfect Christmas gift.  I wasn't sure if the recipient has a blue ray or not so I'm golden either way.  This movie is hysterical.,1387324800,,156,4.166666666666667
5577019,5,B00BC36YWC,"Fully reccomend it. Finally, a movie that is not boring and really good. Please watch it. Really. A good movie for everyone.",1387324800,,124,4.681818181818182
5577020,3,B00BC36YWC,"The movie was just OK.  It did well in the boxoffice so I figured it had to be a decent flick.  And it was just that, decent.  Not great.  Had a few chuckles and one laugh out loud moment.  I know you are supposed to suspend reality when seeing a movie, especially one like this, but this thing was sooo far fetched it was ridiculous.  I think I am even leaning toward disappointed after seeing this movie.  I've certainly seen funnier movies  (21 Jumpstreet leaps to mind), and was happy I did not spend money to see it in the theaters.  Even for $3.99 it was just OK.  Not sure what all the hype was about surrounding this movie.",1387324800,,631,4.226890756302521
5577021,4,B00BC36YWC,"This movies was super funny and cute. It was casted perfectly! Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a silly, slapstick comedy.",1387324800,,150,5.04

5577023,1,B00BC36YWC,I was not impressed with this movie. Predictable and lame humor. So glad I didn't pay to see this at a theater!,1387324800,5,111,4.090909090909091
5577024,2,B00BC36YWC,I was expecting a lot more since I loved Horrible Bosses. I don't know what to say excep that it really was not that funny or inventive. Felt like I've seen it before.,1387324800,,167,4.090909090909091
5577025,4,B00BC36YWC,This is a fun adult-themed movie. Entertaining to watch. I wouldn't recommend it to young children under the age of 16,1387324800,,118,4.666666666666667
5577026,5,B00BC36YWC,"One of the most difficult movies to produce are comedy movies. ""We are the Millers"" is as funny as it can get!",1387324800,,110,4.045454545454546
5577027,2,B00BC36YWC,Vulgarity seemed to be the main theme. It did make me laugh at times but certainly one could pass this one up and never notice.,1387324800,,127,4.12
5577028,4,B00BC36YWC,"The transformations of each character from who and what they were to become the ""Miller"" family was original and I liked their chemistry. Jason Sudeikis I always find funny, Jennifer Aniston was credible as both stripper and ""mom"" and the kids were the perfect compliment.",1387324800,,272,5.066666666666666
5577029,5,B00BC36YWC,Great movie. Great plot. Lots of laughs. Way better than I had anticipated. You need to Go watch it... NOW,1387238400,,106,4.35
5577030,5,B00BC36YWC,Very funny and enjoyable video.  Sweet story line and kid actors were very good although it had a very typical lending,1387238400,,118,4.619047619047619

5577033,3,B00BC36YWC,Shock humor- a few funny moments but not a great comedy. They just don't make them like they once did.,1387238400,,102,4.15
5577036,1,B00BC36YWC,i AM SURE IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE. BUT COULD NOT WATCH. KEPT STOPPING WHILE WATCHING IT COMPLAINED BUT NOTHING WAS DONE.,1387238400,,116,4.318181818181818
5577037,2,B00BC36YWC,"Jennifer Aniston's character in this film needs money. I'm not so sure Jennifer doesn't need the money herself. She's no Oscar winning actress but she certainly pretty and enjoyable to watch but why does she keep making one annoyingly bad film after another?

The only thing that redeemed this movie was the part of the son played by Will Poulter.

Don't waste any money on this. Catch it on a plane or watch at a friends house or wait until it streams for free somewhere.",1387238400,,472,4.541176470588235

5577044,5,B00BC36YWC,"I'd seen this before but had been trying to convince my husband it was worth watching. I finally made him sit down and watch it and he laughed out loud the entire movie.

5577048,3,B00BC36YWC,This was a funny movie if you are looking for some good laughs. The characters however weren't the most believable in their parts.,1387238400,,130,4.695652173913044
5577049,4,B00BC36YWC,I really enjoyed all of the characters individually.  It was still your predictable Hollywood movie but it was fun and edgy enough not to bore you to tears.  It was a rainy day nothing else to do movie.,1387238400,,202,4.2894736842105265

5577063,5,B00BC36YWC,What a funny film.  It reminds me of my neighbors.  Of course I could never be this dissfunctional.  I recommend it,1387152000,,115,4.380952380952381
5577064,4,B00BC36YWC,Fun having Jennifer Anniston in this role.  Not really any down times like in so many comedies.  Cast worked well off of each other.,1387152000,,132,4.458333333333333

5577066,2,B00BC36YWC,"Sad, predictible lines, gross language, stupid scenes like geek learning to kiss. Rent for 25 cents or less, not worth a dollar.",1387152000,,128,4.863636363636363
5577067,5,B00BC36YWC,Funny movie. Laughted a lot. Just not a family movie. A lot of inappropriate words and nudity for young pre teen and kids.,1387152000,,122,4.3478260869565215

5577070,1,B00BC36YWC,Too many obscene words.  This sunk Jennifer Anniston to a new low - she could do better than this.  The movie stunk. It wasn't even funny.,1387152000,4,138,4.269230769230769
5577071,4,B00BC36YWC,funny and has a good ending I would not all my 12 year old to watch it. I can see why people walked out of the theater because it starts off very rude using the word anal. I would recommend for adults.,1387152000,,201,3.8095238095238093
5577072,3,B00BC36YWC,There are few funny lines and moments in the movie but overall the plot and the script were average at best.  It's probably closer to a two star instead of the three that I gave it.,1387152000,,181,4.027777777777778
5577073,4,B00BC36YWC,This movie is great for an evening of mindless entertainment.  It is vulgar to say the least and is NOT for kids!  The ending is fairly predictable.  The first quarter of the movie was a bit hard to get through hence the 4 stars rather than 5.  It is slow moving but hang in there.....a few giggles are coming your way.  Overall I'd recommend...,1387152000,,345,4.328125
5577074,3,B00BC36YWC,"Jennifer Aniston looks amazing for someone over 40 (or for any age for that matter). acting was solid. overall, I enjoyed it, but parts were unbelievable including: (1) that the border guards don't search vehicles leaving America going into Mexico. now I admit to ignorance here, never been to Mexico or out of the country, but just common sense, the border is to minimize illegals and drugs flowing in and out of the country. makes no sense guards would wave the Millers through on their way to Mexico. (2) that the border guards wouldn't check their RV leaving Mexico, just because some illegals had been hiding under the RV and scampered away. not believable that the border guards wouldn't check the inside of the vehicle for whatever reason. also I know there are drug sniffing dogs and considering how much pot was on the RV dogs should've been barking their heads off. (3) absolutely unbelievable that the guy playing the Miller teenager couldn't feel the huge spider crawling up his leg. if they'd established him with a nerve disorder where he feels reduced sensation that would have worked, but for an ordinary, healthy teenager to not feel a humongous spider crawling on his leg, not - most people can feel an ant crawling on them. the movie had some amusing bits, and more cussing than I expected. worth a watch but I wouldn't buy it. made money though so you may like it more than me.",1387152000,,1397,4.682926829268292

5577092,1,B00BC36YWC,This just has nothing funny about it at all.  The script sucks.  The acting sucks. The comedic timing sucks.  The relationship among the characters sucks.

5577154,4,B00BC36YWC,"Although it was a bit predictable, it was funnier than I expected.  Had a few nice sexy moments, too.  I wasn't knocked out by it, but I did enjoy it.  Jennifer Aniston has made some crappy movies, but this wasn't one of them.  I loved the little complainy conversation at the end!",1386633600,,281,4.346153846153846
5577155,2,B00BC36YWC,We did not like the fact that we had to watch it in SD and thought the storyline was lacking in imagination.,1386633600,,108,3.9545454545454546
5577156,5,B00BC36YWC,"This movie moves along at a great pace. The premise was hysterical. A slacker pot dealer guy creating a made from scratch family. But the good guys still win in the end! And it is surprising and funny to find out who the good guys are! I enjoyed the spontaneous group-singing scene. Overall the movie made me laugh out loud, but was also a little sentimental.",1386547200,,359,4.454545454545454
5577157,4,B00BC36YWC,"Much better than I anticipated. It will not win any  awards but silly, funny, and entertaining. There are a few scenes you will be rewinding too.",1386547200,,145,4.576923076923077

5577159,5,B00BC36YWC,I laughed the whole time during this movie.  It was really fun.  At first I wanted to shut it off because I don't like stoner type movies or movies about drugs but I kept watching and im glad I did cuz I really needed a good laugh!,1386547200,,231,3.893617021276596
5577160,4,B00BC36YWC,"I liked the clever, offbeat story and the characters were funny and believable. Any movie that makes me laugh out loud several times deserves at least a four star rating.",1386547200,,170,4.7
5577161,3,B00BC36YWC,Storyline is very funny and characters do a good job of portrayal but the language! The F-bombs are totally inappropriate. Could have been a blockbuster if the language had been more subdued.,1386547200,,191,5.0
5577162,5,B00BC36YWC,It was funny movie.  Great for a night in with others. Get ready to laugh at situations that are unbelievable,1386547200,,109,4.45
5577163,2,B00BC36YWC,"My expectations of the the movie was that is was a comedy and from the previews it look like it could be very entertaining.  While there were some humorous scenes, the content and language was not well received.  This could have been a really funny movie but for the language and some items of humor were just not in good taste....",1386547200,,331,4.409836065573771

5577165,5,B00BC36YWC,"One of the funniest, yet a bit raunchy movies of 2013!  Jason Sudekis and Jennifer Aniston do a fantastic job in this adventure of craziness.  All of the actors complement each other and the more you pay attention, the funnier it is!",1386547200,,233,4.523809523809524
5577166,2,B00BC36YWC,"Could have been a 3-4 four star show if they would have cleaned up but I guess they were wanting to appeal to the R rated crowd. They could have made it a PG13 rating by removing or changing a couple scenes it would have been more appealing to more viewers, but I guess they felt compelled to put a couple crude nonsense scenes in, thus the R rating. Regardless, I would call it a wait until it comes on netflix show rather then rent, let alone buy...lol. It has some funny moments, but that is about it.",1386547200,,504,4.153061224489796

5577168,5,B00BC36YWC,"A classy movie for this genre, where the characters encounter some relatively believable problems.  I laughed tons and really cared about the characters.  And imagine, no one had to have diarrhea in the street to get a laugh.",1386547200,,225,4.894736842105263

5577170,2,B00BC36YWC,"I wish I could give it 2.5 starts, because there were some genuinely funny moments, but overall I expected more with the high ratings.  The plot details were weak and the comedy was more zany than funny most of the time.",1386547200,,220,4.365853658536586
5577171,3,B00BC36YWC,Funny movie but not one that I will remember for long.  Jason Sudekis plays the same character that he did on Saturday Night Live.,1386547200,,130,4.416666666666667

5577174,2,B00BC36YWC,"Beware, Caution, Looks like a clean Family movie from the cover, not so... Plot and Acting is very good but again we can't make a movie in America today unless we swear in curse in every other sentence. Terrible script writing with a great plot.",1386547200,,245,4.466666666666667
5577175,1,B00BC36YWC,I rented this movie to watch on the airplane. I was embarrassed when I found a little girl watching it across the aisle. Jennifer Aniston is one of my favorite actresses and was very disappointed in this movie. There was a lot of swearing I mean ALOT. The F bomb was used alot. The whole movie was sexual.,1386460800,7,305,4.275862068965517

Big campers or any camper for that matter is/are bound to make it on film. (oh, how campers end up in highway accidents oh too often). This movie is like the four seasons. They're all so different yet end up all stuck in the same year.",1386460800,,400,4.728571428571429
5577179,5,B00BC36YWC,One of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time.  Laughed all the way through!  Hubby liked it too which is very rare for us to both like the same movie!,1386460800,,159,3.787878787878788

5577185,5,B00BC36YWC,Very clever and unpredictable comedy movie. Some of the scenes we could not stop laughing. I'm going to ask for a copy for Christmas instead of renting every time I'm down and need a pick me up.,1386460800,2,194,4.27027027027027
5577186,4,B00BC36YWC,"Cute Movie! Finally a comedy that broke the Hollywood mold by actually being funny.  It was above average length but didn't drag and moved along nicely. Wasn't afraid to be raunchy yet somehow, perversely tasteful. Well done and worth a watch.",1386460800,,243,4.926829268292683
5577187,4,B00BC36YWC,Cute film and entertaining. Certainly not a classic but still fun to watch. The cast works well together. It's nice that the real supreme douche bag of the movie gets what he deserves in the end.,1386374400,,195,4.444444444444445
5577188,5,B00BC36YWC,This was a hilarious fun to watch movie. We really enjoyed watching the events as they unfold in the lives of a made up family.,1386374400,,127,4.12

5577191,5,B00BC36YWC,This movie was hilareous I haven't laughed so hard at a movie in a long time.  Would recommend to everyone.  There are a few questable scenes so it's not for small one.,1386374400,,168,4.21875

5577193,4,B00BC36YWC,You will enjoy the laughs. Funny in many points in movie. Does not go to far with jokes to be stupid like other comedies. This is not for the little kiddies but a good comedy for those you like comedies with out all the jokes about crack/pot etc. The movie is about pot smuggling but in a funny way that does not have the characters using drugs during the movie.,1386374400,,362,4.185714285714286
5577194,4,B00BC36YWC,"All in all this movie had some really good parts to laugh hard about. I was actually surprised. I didn't expect much out of this movie. The only real negative was that it was bad enough that I am not sure I would want to tell people I watched it and definitely not encourage people to watch it. I have to give it 4 stars though, because it was above what I expected.

I will say though, more than half the scenes shown in the trailer are NOT in the movie. They were edited or changed for the final cut. Sadly they were way more funny in the trailer than what they ended up going with.",1386374400,,584,4.0344827586206895

5577197,4,B00BC36YWC,This is one of the Craziest  movie I've ever seen.  Some of the material was  a little shocking at least to me.  Very action packed.,1386374400,,132,4.16

5577203,5,B00BC36YWC,first off i watched this on the big screen and knew from the previews that this movie would be a riot and it is the most rottenly funny movie that i have watched in a long time. i don't think that their really is a dull moment in the whole movie. this was a great cast that made this movie the only thing that i would say is don't let young kids watch this movie. its not due to excessive nudity it just the suggestive terms that they use and the couple parts that are a little questionable.,1386288000,,491,4.020408163265306

5577209,5,B00BC36YWC,"This movie was laugh out loud funny.  Numerous segments were uncomfortable to watch, and it is a bit crude, but hilarious.  I would definitely recommend this movie to watch for great laughs if you're not afraid of swearing and crude humor.",1386201600,,239,4.804878048780488

5577212,4,B00BC36YWC,A drug dealer on the run from Mexico? And a comedy? I was reluctant to watch this movie until I saw the trailer. Offbeat premise and good casting/acting. Lots of laughs. Definately worth renting.,1386201600,,195,4.764705882352941
5577213,4,B00BC36YWC,"Pretty good comedy. Not the best movie I've ever seen but it kept me entertained. If your into movies like Pineapple Express or others similar, you will probably enjoi it.",1386201600,,171,4.733333333333333

Jennifer Aniston cusses a bit and takes some of her clothes off...you now who this will appeal to. I just wish she'd do something good for a change. Dancing in your underwear? Cussing? Oh come on! Your real, we get it. Now do women a favour and put your clothes back on. (Besides, she is no Sophia Vergara.)",1386201600,,390,4.507042253521127

It felt like a small budget effort where the majority of the money was spent on marketing.  I am glad I did not pay the money to see this in the show.  I enjoyed parts of it.  The script is patently obvious, but the final outcome was weird -- sort of like the writers got tired and just decided to end the movie.",1386201600,,441,4.0813953488372094

Between the trailers and clips shown on talk shows and in theaters prior to the release of the movie, there was nothing left to laugh at.  You can fill in the blanks between these clips and be left feeling like you've seen the movie already by the time you watch it, or find it bland because it's pretty predictable.  I think I would have enjoyed it had I not seen so many promotional clips of the movie.  Those who didn't see the numerous trailers prior to the release of the movie will enjoy it most, and probably rate it much higher.",1386028800,,602,4.2631578947368425

5577286,3,B00BC36YWC,very funny movie with an extremely limited vocabulary.  kind of a cross between airplane and listening to an eddie murphy comedy special.  if you want to hear the f word a few thousand times interspersed with a couple of other words than this movie is for you.  if you are watching just for the pole dance watch true lies as that was a lot better pole dance.,1385856000,,358,4.313432835820896

5577304,2,B00BC36YWC,"This movie is very funny; it is why I give it 2 stars. It also is just stupid humor which is why it was only given 2 stars out of a possible 5. The movie also centers its humor around a juvenile interpretation of funny. It also caters to an audience that not only finds a spider bite on the genital area hilarious but in addition somehow believes displaying the genitals affected by the bite (not once but 3 times in the movie) is even more hilarious to its viewing audience? If you find slapstick humor accompanied with a twist of perversion makes you laugh then I recommend this movie for you. Also, if you find viewing a teenage boy's penis with a grotesquely swollen spider-bit testicle hilariously funny and entertaining than this movie is definitely for you to go see!  Clearly the focus was not on exploiting the sexy appeal of the drop-dead-gorgeous adult body of Jennifer Anniston and was more on borderline child pornography given that the movie seemed to focus more viewing time on a teenage boy's genitals adversely affected by a spider bite!",1385769600,,1054,4.636363636363637

I could do without the same-sex-attraction of the DEA cop and his wife, who by the way in reality would not have let the Millers go on a charge of drug smuggling.  It is only Will Poulter's  (of ""Voyage of the Dawn Trader"" fame)  that carried the movie where hilarity is concerned; but his innuendos were not frequent enough make the film a howl.",1385769600,,448,4.349397590361446

The  basic premise of the movie, a drug dealer, illegally importing drugs into the US, as the ""hero"", was shallow and ill conceived. Jennifer Aniston also added to the rudimentary basics, as a stripper, showing off her body, for the simple monetary benefit of the movie and herself. In the end we were all duped into purchasing this, as best, socially lame comedy. I was sorry I rented it....and sorrier for Jennifer that she made it.",1385769600,,557,4.802083333333333

Not for children 17 and under.
Jason Sudeikis portrayal as a drug dealer completely fails. If you've had the bad fortune to have rented this movie, don't bother watching it. Just fast forward to the out-takes at the end. The out-takes are funnier than the whole movie.",1385683200,2,306,4.7924528301886795
5577322,4,B00BC36YWC,"Pretty funny, but definitely ""Adult""---Not for the kiddies!  Lots of drug references, as well as sexual overtones (hey, one of the main characters is a stripper)...I actually enjoyed the show more than I originally thought I would.",1385683200,,231,5.243243243243243

5577324,4,B00BC36YWC,Pretty funny and ejoyable to watch. Had believable humor and scenes that were captivating and exciting. Well worth a rental.,1385683200,,124,5.25

I was under stress for the past  3 days and really needed something to cheer me up...and this crazy movie certainly did the trick.  It was laugh out loud, FOYA funny  and a comedy I'll never forget!  I thought that those who gave it a bad review, like for example criticizing Jennifer Aniston for being a poor choice for the stripper  role, should never have been watching a comedy like this to begin with.  Come on already, lighten up!  This isn't a drama or a movie one would take seriously...there's no message to be conveyed and no moral conflict to portray.  The only thing to take seriously here is that it's seriously funny!!!  Besides, I thought Jennifer did a damned good portrayal!  See it...it's a little comedic gem!",1385683200,7,890,4.4875

5577334,5,B00BC36YWC,"I'll be adding this one to the collection later, funny movie, though I thought Jennifer Aniston was funnier in Horrible Bosses.

What is with Hollywood and the constant chatter of foul language in the movies of late. Are they saying that this has become the normal language in society?? Or are they trying to make people begin to use this obscene language? I couldn't take it and after 20 minutes of this storyless, foul language movie had to turn it off. Jennifer Aniston is well known in this foul language lingo, horrible bosses being another similar one.",1385596800,3,576,4.601941747572815

5577362,5,B00BC36YWC,This movie had me in stitches.  There was one part they did not have to show....however it was not that bad in order to warrant less stars.  I guess I'm just a 54 year old juvenile...but it cracked me up.  Everyone was great in the movie...just too cute!,1385424000,,254,4.25
5577363,5,B00BC36YWC,Hilarious movie and a Very entertaining comedy! Awesome cast and roles! Picks fun at the US vs Mexico drug smuggling arena,1385424000,,122,4.857142857142857

5577367,2,B00BC36YWC,Nothing more than a rank attempt at humor using some unusual things as props. Understand why it spent a short time in the theaters.,1385424000,,131,4.5
5577368,4,B00BC36YWC,Pretty funny movie! Dysfunctional family at its best! Guaranteed to make you laugh and appreciate the family you have no matter what!,1385424000,,133,5.090909090909091

5577377,3,B00BC36YWC,It was only ok.showed the funniest parts in the preview. I would probably Not recommend it to a friend .It wasn't the funniest movie I've ever seen,1385337600,,147,4.481481481481482
5577378,4,B00BC36YWC,I enjoy this movie it because it was full of humor. it made me laugh so hard I almost fell out on the floor with tears in my eyes. I just had to purchase this movie last night.

5577382,4,B00BC36YWC,I rented this movie and it stopped about 12 times while watching it.  Each time taking about 3-5 minutes to restart.  It was very annoying and really disrupted the movie.  If movie quality is poor it should let you know that before you pay the money for it.  the movie itself was very funny and would have been great if not for the difficulty in watching it.,1385337600,,358,4.298507462686567
5577383,3,B00BC36YWC,"Some very funny parts, and some very uncomfortable parts.  I don't know if Aniston as a stripper is implausible, but I do think she looks terrific.  A lot of women in their twenties have never looked so good.  The guy who plays Kenny is excellent.  I feel a little bad for Roberts, she never seems to get roles to really showcase her talents.  And Sudiekus, blah.  If this jackwagon were even half as talented or funny as he thinks he is, his ego would be better tolerated.  His transparent and obvious self adoration is the most obnoxious thing about this movie.  There is one scene where he looks at the camera...right at the camera.  And this is in the movie, not the out takes where it belongs.  So if you happen to be a Sudiekus fan, you will love this movie.  If not, some of the funny is worth putting up with him.",1385337600,,821,4.300653594771242

It was really funny but definitely not for young teens. There were a lot of curse words in it, mostly the ""F"" word and also the fact that the movie is about a drug smuggling and a drug dealer. I rented it on Amazon instant video but it is a movie that I would have paid full price at the movies. It really just had us laughing the whole time. I would highly recommend seeing this movie.",1385337600,,548,4.130841121495327

Probably one of the funnest outtakes I have ever seen.  They have a scene where they turn on the radio and the whole family is suppose to sing to it.  As a joke, that they show in the outtakes, they put in the theme to Friends instead of the song that was suppose to play in the movie",1385251200,,430,3.840909090909091

5577395,4,B00BC36YWC,Really pleasantly surprised by this film.  It had quite a few laugh out loud moments and lots of chuckles throughout.  I did not expect it to be as funny as it is.  Make sure to check out the outtakes at the end; the giant Mexican goon outtake is hilarious.,1385251200,,257,4.204081632653061

5577397,2,B00BC36YWC,"I guess I'm missing something.  Good reviews and pretty strong box office, so I rented.  I found this to be lame and boring.  There were very few laughs and you had to wait so long between them.  Nothing worse than a movie which tries and misses for humor, especially when stooping to the use of crude language and sexually gratuitous scenes.  Poor characters and weak premise to boot.",1385251200,,385,4.602941176470588

If you want wholesome, go rent the Apple Dumpling Gang... I saw this on another movie service, but just ordered the extended blu ray with Ultraviolet.

The only thing that is disappointing is that Amazon does not yet support Ultraviolet.. I have over 1,100 UV titles. it's the future of movie owning and watching. I can view my collection on thousands of apps and platforms. Most major retailers support UV (Walmart, Target, Barnes & Noble, Best Buy, etc..) and I can watch my library on any of their streaming platforms because UV movies are mirrored and free to access and watch... Even a major cable provider is set to accept UV. Amazon video titles..aren't..So I don't get why listings advertise UV on Amazon, but yet they won't support it's functionality...

5577426,3,B00BC36YWC,"Overall, this is a fairly funny movie. It has its good moments and some slow areas. It had way too many attempts at humor that were not humorous.

Premise: Pot dealer creates a fake family to help him travel to Mexico and smuggle drugs back to the US. The movie details the antics they encounter.

Acting: Top notch by all. Although all the actors do a great job, Will Poulter(Kenny, the ""son""), is the show stealer. Jason Sudeikis(David, the father) gets most of the good one liners. Jennifer Anniston, Nick Offerman, Kathyrn Hahn and Emma Roberts also do a great job.

Writing: This is where the movie sags. With such a great cast, they simply did not have enough material for the entire movie and attempted to use profanity and 'out of place' sexual content to compensate. This unnecessarily limited their audience base. If they had concentrated a bit more on the writing, this could have been an outstanding comedy that was more acceptable for a wider audience.

Funniest scenes:
[...]
[...]

Special effects: None

Family friendly: Movie is about drugs and drug smuggling, graphic sexual discussions are common, profanity is the norm. Lots of ""F"" bombs. Stripping and brief frontal male nudity are also present. This is not a movie I would show with kids, teenagers nor guests but that is just me. This is not a complaint, but simply attempting to provide info for those who wish to know.

Other: I found a new use for my BigBubba mug (you have to watch to find out).

Even with the slow and awkward parts, the movie had enough good humor in it to get 3 stars. I would watch a sequel with the same cast.",1384819200,,1608,4.5979020979020975

5577433,5,B00BC36YWC,"We're the Millers reunites Jason Sudeikis, former SNL regular, and Jennifer Aniston who both starred in Horrible Bosses.

A low level pot dealer played by Sudeikis runs into inventory issues, and has to put together an unlikely family of misfits, which includes a down on her luck stripper (Aniston), a homeless girl (Emma Roberts), and a virgin to pose as a family of smugglers who can get across the border without attracting suspicion.  Good luck.

Complications, and numerous adventures occur, and is the stripper hard hearted, or does she have a heart of gold?

What impressed me most in watching this movie was Sudeikis' vast improvement and his presence and charisma in the movie.

In previous movies he has been the also ran among greater stars, but here he occasionally displays a charisma reminiscent of George Clooney in his comedy roles, and I think this movie will prove to be a major breakthrough role for him, and put him on the map as a leading actor.

Jennifer Aniston displays her usual comedy skills, and there are a couple of raunchy stripper scenes which display her physique very well.  Emma Roberts,  Julia Roberts niece, shows that that she is a creditable actress in her own right.  There are a number of awkward and highly inventive situations developed to great comedic effect, and to tell you more might ruin the spontaneity of your experience.

Our two main stars will also be appearing in the Horrible Bosses sequel due out next year.

I think most people will enjoy this movie, and I hope this was helpful.",1384473600,,1537,4.806083650190114

This is a straightforward, raunchy, roll on the floor laughing comedy, and it delivers in those areas with proficiency that few movies show nowadays.

The cast that plays the Millers does an outstanding job in their roles. Jennifer Aniston is as good as she was in Friends, Jason Sudeikis proves that he deserves a place among the top guys in the genre today, with his perfect use of facial expressions and his switching between low-level drug dealer and family man. Probably the revelation is the kid that plays Kenny, his freshness and the naivete he provides his character promise great things to come from him.

The script is as funny as funny can be. There is a nice blend of straightforward humor, with raunchy situations, providing everyone with a little of what they like. If you are looking for a movie that will make you laugh almost non-stop and that will leave you feeling good and refreshed when you are done, look no further.",1384387200,,1104,4.598984771573604

And the last act wraps things up with a happy ending.) However, it's Sudeikis, Aniston, Poulter, and Roberts' chemistry that really makes the movie funny and enjoyable. They're a fake family that bonds and acts like a crass real family and they curse and swear enough to make them believable and funny, at the same time. Yes, the plot is clich and predictable, but the overall movie is entertaining, the stars have excellent chemistry together, and it deserves the good rating.

5577444,4,B00BC36YWC,"With a big nod to National Lampoon's and the Hangover franchise, We're The Millers is a surprisingly funny flick that's constantly aware of its own flimsiness but keeps just having a good time along the way. This is one of those concepts that writes itself and once you know the set up, you can predict 95% of the rest of the film as it unfolds, though the near-constant gags keep it going. Jason Sudeikis is funny as always but the entire family cast works well as the dysfunctional group ripping off Mexican drug lords while swinging in a camp site with a DEA agent. The whole script must have read like this by the way - it's a bunch of short phrases brainstormed at Happy Hour such as ""weed baby"" and ""kissing lessons from Jennifer Aniston"". While it runs out of steam in the last 20 minutes or so, most of the audience should be happy that at least something mildly amusing came out of Hollywood in 2013.  By the time it hits $3.99 on Amazon Prime, this is a reasonably solid night in for some adult-friendly humor.",1384128000,,1020,4.425531914893617

It's helped along by a strong cast- Jason Sudeikis is excellent, as is Jennifer Aniston. The supporting cast are uniformly good.

5577447,3,B00BC36YWC,"""While not a film to shout out about, We're the Millers, after a successful run at the box office ($150m gross to date), was surprisingly good and funny too. Jason Sudeikis plays a loser of a drug dealer who ends up on a gig to smuggle in Mexico by covering-up in disguise with a fake family consisting of a stripper, an awkward teenager, and a troubled teenager who prefers stealing things.

The film's execution is pretty much similar to what you may find in a National Lampoon Vacation film with Chevy Chase but with more vulgarity and sex and drug-related humour which explain its R-rating. Nevertheless, the film's subversive nature is what may stand out for some when you consider some of its more satirical elements present by mocking the ridiculousness and stereotypes of drug dealers, kingpins, and the U.S. Border Patrol and immigration law (if Breaking Bad was a straight-out comedy that had cannabis and Mexico and Colorado as the settings).

However, it is the more crazier scenes that are more striking here and Kenny, the awkward teenager, is the one and only character that I thought stole the whole film for me. His charisma and presence is so bizarre and simple he does not even mean to come across as crude or offensive when he does. He reminded me a lot of Milhouse van Houten from The Simpsons especially knowing that his parents hardly care for him anyways. His issues trying to deal with women by kissing his so-called sister and mother and singing/rapping out TLC's landmark song, ""Waterfalls,"" are what steal the film for me. In addition, a special scene toward the end with Jennifer Aniston (SPOILER ALERT) hearing the Friends theme song makes her smile and cringe was a stealer too (SPOILER ALERT).

But the film felt a bit ordinary at parts compared to films that I really liked before that are similar like Without a Paddle and Wild Hogs but it had more going it and was at times funnier and out-there than the modern prince of R-rated comedy, The Hangover.""",1384041600,3,1987,4.736994219653179

I liked the movie. There were a lot of funny parts. The haircut scene, and ""No Ragrets"" were the funniest.

However there were parts that really me sad and uncomfortable. Like that whole scene involving Kenny, and him never kissing a girl. I felt it went on too long, and I didn't like he was portrayed in movie. They made him look like a loser, and it really upset me. I don't like watching movies that upset me. And I certainly do not expect a comedy to be upsetting. So I have to knock off two stars for that.

5577459,5,B00BC36YWC,"WE'RE THE MILLERS is a laugh-out-loud comedy penned by the same writing team that created WEDDING CRASHERS. Thanks to that inventive comedic writing and a well-blended ensemble of comedians, WE'RE THE MILLERS delivers the funniest movie of 2013 (sorry,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Is-The-End/dp/B00FJVBELO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Is The End</a>, you're a close second).

The entire cast carries this film perfectly, hitting every note of comedic timing, both outrageous and subtle. Jason Sudeikis (SNL, HORRIBLE BOSSES) plays the character of drug dealer David Clark. Clark runs out of choices and must make a drug run for ""boss"" Brad Gurdlinger, played by Ed Helms (THE HANGOVER). Realizing he can't make this run on his own, he recruits a make-believe family, mothered by Jennifer Aniston's character, Rose O'Reilly. The entire cast deserves recognition, but a special nod is given to Jennifer Aniston for coming back to her FRIENDS-level comedy roots.

WE'RE THE MILLERS begins funny and carries the same high (no pun intended) note throughout. What starts as funny, ends as funny--even after the movie. And yes, it is worth viewing the blooper reel; at least you won't have to sit through the credits to view them. Trust me.

The only non-comedic parts of the movie are toward the end when the plot needs to start wrapping up. At that point you may start glancing at your watch thinking the movie is a bit long, but then another few more laughs come rolling in and you're back in and immersed with the laughter.

Yes, this film is profane and raunchy--and it's hilarious because of it. No, there is no nudity, but Jennifer Aniston has plenty of opportunity to strut her stuff while wearing skimpy material. If you enjoyed WEDDING CRASHERS or any of the other movies mentioned above that the actors have appeared in, then this is a must-see movie.

I strongly suggest you watch something more stimulating like Everything Must Go or even the slightly above average Crazy, Stupid, Love which are actually funny. I'd skip this film. Jennifer Aniston should stop doing these kind of roles because she comes across as very attention seeking and daft.

There is one thing, however, that I think it could have been better: Rose casting! I love Jennifer Aniston and have enjoyed all her movies but she is now 40 and the character she is playing is 30 at most.  I mean, she has a gorgeous body during the strip dance at the garage but in the rest of the movie she is playing a mom.

5577465,4,B00BC36YWC,"""We're the Millers"" is that rarest of cinematic creatures - a high-concept Hollywood comedy that actually works.

Jason Sudeikis from ""Saturday Night Live"" plays a small-time drug dealer who's sent by his skeevy drug lord (Ed Helms) to Mexico to pick up a shipment of marijuana. In order to avoid arousing any unwanted suspicion at the border, David rents an oversized RV and hires a motley crew of acquaintances to pose as his all-American family. These include a down-on-her-heels stripper posing as his wife (Jennifer Aniston); a hard-edged, homeless girl standing in as his daughter (Emma Roberts); and a big-hearted dork from the neighborhood assuming the role of his son (Will Poulter).

The story is fraught with any number of comical misadventures as David and his unlikely troupe encounter armed-to-the-teeth bad guys and another family (led by Kathryn Hahn and ""Parks and Recreation's"" Nick Offerman) in an equally ostentatious RV along the way.

What separates ""We're the Millers"" from so many other recent studio-manufactured comedies is the sharpness of the writing and the appealing nature of the characters. The script maintains a deft balance between subtle wit and blatant slapstick, modern-day crudity and old-fashioned sweetness. And even in those rare moments when the movie jumps the track, it's quick to climb right back on and head on to its destination.

Much of the credit for the movie's success goes to the actors who create tremendously likable characters, all with their own comic quirks and eccentricities, but all rooted, at least to some extent, in real life. The real scene-stealer is Poulter whose spot-on portrayal of a lovable nerd serves as the beating heart of the movie.

So effective in fact are the actors in getting us to root for the characters that the movie can play up the whole corny and sentimental notion of what it means to be a family and get away with it. Thus, it manages to keep its subversive cred while at the same time warming the heart. That's a pretty impressive accomplishment when you get right down to it.",1380499200,12,2067,4.997093023255814

I enjoyed the movie and it was entertaining, but I won't rush to buy it anytime soon. Sedekis is charming as the lead, but, not as commanding as an actor with seasoned experience. The scene with Aniston stripping is so forced it's almost pathetic. It comes out of nowhere. But again, this is a comedy. A few gross out moments as well which some find super hilarious. I prefer subtle, witty humor which this has also. Still worth a rent.",1380240000,4,570,4.653465346534653

Jason Sudeikis is perfectly cast as the dealer, Jennifer Aniston is beautiful and hilarious as his stripper wife, and Emma Roberts and Will Pouter are excellent and their chemistry is great as they play the parts of the perfect American middle class family. Sudeikas will be highly missed from SNL, his delivery is always perfect.

5577471,4,B00BC36YWC,"In truth, I'd have to rate We're The Millers as a something of an uneven comedy, parts of it being high comedy, parts of it being low comedy, and parts of it just being awkward and drawn out. But the film is rescued by a truly exceptional cast who are individually funny enough to keep things moving along nicely, even through the parts where the script and/or the director aren't quite up to the job.

David Clark (Jason Sudeikis) is a low-level marijuana dealer who lives in an apartment building, as do Rose O'Reilly (Jennifer Aniston), who works as a stripper at a local club, and Kenny (Will Poulter), a genial but utterly clueless 18-year-old whose mother we learn apparently went out for groceries... a week ago.  Because of an incident caused by Kenny's trying to be helpful, David is robbed of his stash and his money, leaving him no way to pay his supplier to whom he owes a great deal of money. His supplier, a very wealthy drug boss named Brad Gurdlinger (Ed Helms) makes  David an offer he can't refuse:  smuggle ""a smidgen"" of marijuana from Mexico for him in order to clear his debt or his thugs will take it out of his hide. While gloomily contemplating how much trouble he's about to be in for, David gets an idea from seeing a cop deal with a goofy touristy family (think the Flanders family from The Simpsons) driving a hugely oversized RV through the neighborhood.  He realizes that while one man attempting to get through customs at the Mexican border would arouse suspicion, _nobody_ would expect a family that white-suburbanly goofy driving a ridiculously large RV of drug smuggling.  All he needs is a 'family' to provide the illusion.  He ends up drafting Kenny, who's innocently eager and has nothing else better to do; Rose, who's desperate after losing her stripper job and getting an eviction notice; and a teenage runaway acquaintance of Kenny's, a hard-edged girl named Casey (Emma Roberts) to pose as his bogus family whom he calls the ""Millers"".

Everything seems to go well at first, in spite of personality clashes between David and Rose and between Casey and just about everyone (except Kenny, who's just too guileless for anyone to clash with).  But of course things quickly start to go wrong, starting with David finding out that the ""smidgen"" of marijuana he's supposed to pick up and smuggle turns out to be a thousand pounds that take up every inch of spare space in the RV. And that Brad was being somewhat less than honest on other matters of the deal, which ends up with the Mexican drug lord Chacon (Tomer Sisley) and his chief henchman, One-Eye (Matthew Willig) hot on their trail. With further complications added by another RV-traveling family they meet and then can't seem to get rid of, the Fitzgeralds, consisting of Don (Nick Offerman), Edie (Kathryn Hahn) and daughter Melissa (Molly Quinn).

The comedy comes in varying forms, sometimes high-brow, sometimes low-brow, sometimes just makes-you-squirm awkward (note: this is definitely not a movie for younger kids), and sometimes the pacing is a bit off when a joke goes on for too long, but the superb cast keep things moving with great performances. Jason Sudeikis (Saturday Night Live, Horrible Bosses and Hall Pass) is perfect as David, the small-time marijuana dealer who's been thrown into situations completely out of his depth, talking confident but then freezing up with a deer-in-the-headlights look at the worst possible time. Jennifer Aniston (Friends, Horrible Bosses, The Switch) makes her stripper Rose more than a clich&eacute;, showing her to be quite resourceful in surprising ways, including being the only one to have read the RV's owners manual. Emma Roberts is surprisingly subtle as the runaway teenager Casey, giving her the comic hard-edges one would expect but every now and then letting her soften just a bit to make her character believable. Ed Helms (The Hangover trilogy, The Office) is delightfully over-the-top as David's manipulative and screw-everyone-you-can-every-way-you-can supplier, Brad. The stand-out though is Will Poulter's Kenny, who comes across as the most white-bread white-boy in America (quite an achievement considering that Poulter's actually British) and time and again has the best scenes.  Poulter is largely unknown to American audiences, but he's done a lot of work in British TV and film, including the delightful but largely unknown Son Of Rambow (2007), and more recently The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (2010) and Wild Bill (2011). Among other comedic gifts, Poulter is blessed with these incredibly arched eyebrows that let him look constantly surprised or confused, which fit the character perfectly. And he also knows how to throw in an unexpected curve as he does in one scene where Kenny out-of-the-blue starts rapping along - quite well - to hip-hop  TLC's ""Waterfalls"" which the group is listening to on the RV radio. You get the impression from the other actors' faces that this may have been entirely unscripted.

The film also includes some blooper out-takes during the end credits which are definitely worth catching, particularly one where the crew evidently was playing a joke on Jennifer Aniston and another where Matthew Willig surprises Jason Sudeikis with a highly unexpected move.

Recommended as worth seeing for the individual performances, especially Will Poulter, though with the note that this is most definitely not for the younger kids.",1378598400,2,5449,5.019933554817276

I was waiting for this since it was announced, because I'm a huge Jennifer Aniston fan, and I like Emma Roberts too.
The story moves on quickly without anything taking your mind off the main plot (which happens a lot in current comedies), and it's filled of clever jokes that will make you laugh out loud, and even sexual jokes (but finally tasteful sexual jokes that actually make you laugh, and not feel disgusted or annoyed like it happens with other movies), for me, that was the best, the way they handled sex with comedy without getting too disgusting or too naive.
Jason and Jennifer have a great chemistry, and Emma Roberts impresses the audience with a bad girl role after always playing a nice girl on her other movies. But Kenny (played by Will Poulter), was the best of the movie. Kenny is the typical stupid guy in a comedy, but finally, this movie shows that a character doesn't have to be annoyingly stupid to be funny, just the necessary when it's needed! I hope to see this guy soon in other movies because he really has the talent.
The film counts with unexpected twists that leave the audience shocked, but still making you laugh throughout the whole movie. The only thing that I didn't liked was the ending, I thought it was too predictable, but still enjoyable! Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. I even dare to call it one of the best comedies of 2013 so far! It's totally worth the pre-order.",1378512000,,1569,4.528169014084507

Kenny (Will Poulter) is the inexperienced neighbor boy abandoned by his mother. Casey (Emma Roberts) is a homeless girl who hangs out in the neighborhood.

Of course they get into trouble along the way. The plot of the film wasn't over powering. The comedy was watching these dysfunctional people come together as a family, even if it is just a mock family. The humor is often crude (It's a skateboard!) with Aniston reviving some of her potty mouth from ""Horrible Bosses.""

There were some laughable moments, but overall it is a soft 4 stars.

On the perv factor...the Aniston striptease which comes near the end was designed to be hot as she peels down to her undergarments. However, the truth be told, Demi Moore was better and bolder. There I said it.

5577478,4,B00BC36YWC,"David (Sudekis) is a drug dealer who is in deep hock to his weasly supplier (Helms). In order to make up his debt, he has to travel to Mexico, pick up a ""smidgen"" of product, and bring it back across the border in one of the biggest RVs ever to roll of the factory line. Fearing his scuzzy appearance will be an immediate tip-off to border control and DEA, David enlists the help of a stripper neighbor (Aniston), a street urchin, and the downstairs loser kid whose mother (apparently) has abandoned him to make it look as if they are just a harmless, clean-cut, ""aw shucks"" type family, thus throwing the scent away from their scurrilous deeds.

If you think you can guess how it all ends up, you almost certainly can. The movie doesn't really try anything all that new when it comes to how these kinds of stories frame their arcs. In spite of its predictability, though, the film is legitimately funny. It plows through the standard conflicts and resolutions with the help of some really gung-ho performances and solidly delivered comedic punches, especially with the Sudekis/Aniston duo, both of whom do a stellar job. They're surrounded by more than a few tested talents (Offerman, Marino, Lennon, Hahn, etc.) who all play their characters nearly flawlessly.

A sort of anti-family family comedy, this film is full of raunch, sex, violence, and even a bit of graphic nudity, but it never really crosses the line. There are moments when it feels almost like it should have, but it's not out to do anything other than entertain (hence, for instance, the incredibly gratuitous, completely unnecessary, fairly senseless stripping scene halfway through the film, only there to showcase just how fit Aniston remains at her 40+ years of age). And entertain it does, as long as you are prepared for incest jokes (natch), lots of potty humor, and the warm-hearted finale that comedies like these seem required to have. A big part of the charm is that it seems like they had a ton of fun making the film, and that spirit is infectious and catching.

Comedies are the hardest to market I think. The goal of a trailer is to put enough in to make you want to see it but not give too much away. Most comedies fall into the trap of putting all the funny parts in the trailer and when you see the movie you are disappointed. While I would say that 80% of the trailers gives away all the funny parts the movie is still hilarious and very much worth seeing. Sudeikis is funny as always and Aniston is great in her role but the kid that plays Kenny really steals the movie and he is worth the price alone. There are some comedies that are funny the first time you see them then start to lose something with repeated watching. Some exceptions to me are Anchoman & Wedding Crashers. Those are funny every time I see them. While I don't think this is in the same class as those I still think it will be a long time before the humor is lost with repeated watching.
