7822460,5,6302236061,The chemistry between Kara Sedgwick and Kevin Bacon is incendiary hence why the movie is so funny and sexy. I have no idea why this movie is not on DVD and  why more Kevin Bacon Kara Sedgwick fans don't know about it! Get it!!!,1400025600,,227,4.159090909090909
7822461,5,6302236061,"I never got a chance to see this movie in the theater, but I fell in love with it on VHS and have since gone through 2 copies since the mid-90's.

This movie truly deserves a re-release onto DVD.  Sure, it's a little cheesy, but that's part of the fun.  I thought it was twice as funny and edgy as Reality Bites, but never quite got it's day in the sun.

To top it off, the soundtrack is absolute perfection: Violent Femmes, Soft Cell, Wild Cherry and then some.",1154390400,8,462,4.157303370786517
7822462,4,6302236061,"I was expecting a complete turkey of a film but was pleasantly surprised.  Just goes to show you can't always believe the critics, as attested by other reviews here.  As long as you're not expecting ""Children of Paradise"" or something, you won't be disappointed.  ""Pyrates"" is just a fun - and very risque - romantic comedy.  Definitely not for the kids, but adults who aren't too uptight should enjoy it.  Lots of funny lines and the direction isn't bad either.  Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick really carry this film along, and their onscreen chemistry wasn't just an act, since they're actually married in real life.  Good over-the-top campy entertainment.",1079654400,10,657,4.972477064220183
7822463,4,6302236061,"My sister rented this one night amidst cries of extreme derision... we weren't pleased until we watched it all the way through, and afterwards we had to apologize.  If this was going to be the future of cinema, the nineties seemingly had hope.
Of course, this movie got buried into obscurity (relegated to the domain of 'six degrees of Kevin Bacon'), which is a shame, because it was more insightful and a lot funnier than any other date film on the market.  It predates the pop culture leanings of Tarantino (script-wise), and the casting is brilliant.
You'll love the 'Tainted Love' serenade scene because we've all been there, and because it's amazing in it's awfulness.  The film deserved a lot better.",1006041600,11,706,4.818181818181818
