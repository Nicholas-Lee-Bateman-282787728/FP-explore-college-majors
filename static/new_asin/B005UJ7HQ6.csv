4893902,5,B005UJ7HQ6,"All the women in this DVD have had cancer. The woman who teaches wears her compression sleeve (which I have great difficulty with being claustrophobic) as she shows us the moves. It is very inspiring to see other women having been through what you have been through and how they are coping with their lives and exercising and relaxing and taking time to recover and keep fit. Seeing the trainer wearing her compression sleeve has really helped me to preserve with wearing my sleeve and vest. I am very grateful to her for that and this DVD.

There are good slow moves and some more difficult ones. This is not a tape for soon after surgery, and the trainer is always saying do only as much as you can for you - `what is available' to be exact. I enjoyed it and from the many exercise DVDs I got for exercising after my mastectomy, this is the one I will do. It will feel like getting together with my sisters and I will enjoy it.

Always get your docotr's advice on what exercise you should do, before starting.",1325289600,3,1011,4.372340425531915
4893903,5,B005UJ7HQ6,"The pain, fear, stress and anxiety that a person fighting cancer goes through are not emotions I can pretend to understand, but Claire knows them first hand. As a health practitioner, many of my clients have found that lymphatic movement (enhanced by yoga) and breath work have been a source of new life and well-being during the most challenging battle of their lives. Most exercise regimes are too strict, too high impact, or just not specialized to cater to the unique needs of the thousands who are going through treatment or healing. This DVD, and Claire in particular, has achieved that here. She has gathered a group who are familiar with the fight and willing to share their journey to inspire and call to action those who feel they have no outlet. I can think of 6 people off hand that have never suffered with cancer, but rather: injuries, fibromyalgia, severe inflammation or just a sedentary lifestyle that need the perfect place to start improving their health. This program is ideally suited for them (in fact they may be getting a copy for the Holidays.) Isn't it time that we vote with our dollars for what we value most...HEALTH AND HOPE for those we love the most? People need to be supported through this; what a perfect way to let them know that you are cheering for them to beat this thing. I witnessed Claire go through this battle and have never met a human being more raw, and real about the whole affair. She even found ways to laugh at a time when most could only cry, although, there was plenty of that too. I can think of no one better qualified to teach and lead others through this maze of emotion and emerge victorious. Regenerate, Rejuvenate, Relax and Recover...you seriously deserve this. Great DVD for beginners, people who are stressed, busy people and those who just need a few minutes in the day to call their own...sound familiar?",1321315200,8,1869,4.666666666666667
4893904,5,B005UJ7HQ6,"I am NOT recovering from cancer...but I have had tendon transplants in both hands from severe arthritis, both shoulders have had rotator cuff & inpingement repair, anterior disc repair in c5-c6 & c6-c7 with cadavar implimentation and a titanium plate in my neck and am in need of a knee replacement.
I have never done Yoga. My niece gave me the video. I watched it and thought I might as well give it a go. I fell in love instantly. When I sat on the floor I could berely cross my legs. 10 minutes into the film...I realized that I was so relaxed I was actually sitting cross-legged! The energy I have after doing Yoga is incredible. I am no pain free in my shoulders and knee. I can't speak highly enough about this DVD! And if I can do Yoga...anyone can do it! Gotta go get my Yoga on!!",1320796800,8,788,4.26
4893905,5,B005UJ7HQ6,Just did the workout at home and it is really just like being in the classroom. I enjoyed the routine and plan to do it again tomorrow.,1319414400,,135,4.037037037037037
4893906,5,B005UJ7HQ6,"I have never done yoga before taking this class.  Claire is so Professional and Balanced and Limber!!!  But at the same time, she is compassionate and completely in tune with her students.  I had never heard of Breathing to relax, soothe pain, and just give a feeling of well being.  I thought you just panted hard to give birth, kissed the baby, slapped your husband and got on with your day.  Seriously, the breathing and stretching has given my body relief and a sense of control and power.  During cancer chemotherapy with all of the tests, poking and proding I felt that I had no control and that I was just going from treatment to treatment at my appointed times.  Thank you Yoga, Thank you Claire and Thank you Breath for making me stronger.  Get the DVD and Get Started.  You won't regret it.",1319414400,5,800,4.5
4893907,5,B005UJ7HQ6,"Claire Petretti is a very knowledgeable and gifted teacher. In this excellent Yoga for Cancer Recovery DVD, Claire inspires the viewer to join her and several students- all cancer survivors- in a yoga class especially beneficial during and after treatment for cancer. Even if you have never done yoga, you can follow Claire in this class, and it will be both helpful and enjoyable. She includes several relaxation, stress-reducing exercises- very important. There is no prescription for feeling better for the cancer survivor, but an hour a week of yoga can be like a bridge to the active, healthy and happy life we all seek.",1318809600,,625,4.961904761904762
4893908,5,B005UJ7HQ6,"Claire gets us because she is one of us.  She makes sure that all are engaged and getting the most benefits.  The video is thorough and precise.  Yoga is something that every single human being should be doing NOT just cancer patients.  Yeah Claire, keep up the good work!",1318636800,,272,4.489795918367347
4893909,5,B005UJ7HQ6,"Yes, this is a video for people undergoing cancer treatment and survivors, but this is actually by a cancer survivor! From someone who has been through it! Its nice to know that the person asking you to do something bendy or stretchy knows from a personal perspective how a cancer patient FEELS.  I got mine direct from her website but wanted people to know its awesome.
I like the 30 minute one for times when I just need a break for a minute to breathe and DEAL with stuff in a relatively short period of time and the 60 minute one is good for when I want more or need more.  Focus on health and healing rather than cancer and pain? Yes please.",1318464000,,646,4.2439024390243905
8486862,5,B005UJ7HQ6,I bought this dvd to use post-chemo to try to regain some of my strength and sense of well-being.  I stopped temporarily because of surgery but can't wait to get back to it again.  Definitely recommend this!,1515110400,,207,4.5675675675675675
8486863,4,B005UJ7HQ6,"The instructions are very clear, and I like Claire Petretti's reassuring, soothing voice.  I find even the half hour program requires more stamina than I have at this point in my cancer recovery. That being said, I think I will benefit from this very good program a little farther down the road.  I took off one star because I didn't realize I'd have to buy extra materials like bolsters and blocks.  Since I've never taken a yoga class before, I thought all I'd need would be a mat and loose-fitting yoga clothing.  Except for that, though, I would highly recommend this DVD.  I especially liked the testimonials from cancer patients. They were very encouraging.",1510876800,,663,4.780701754385965
8486864,5,B005UJ7HQ6,"Gentle, supportive way to work through an incredibly difficult time.",1484352000,,68,5.9
8486865,5,B005UJ7HQ6,"When I was diagnosed with breast cancer, I began looking for a good yoga DVD to help reduce the daily stress and anxiety.  I decided to try this one, and I have not been disappointed.  I have told my friends that this DVD is like exercising while I'm taking a nap because it is so relaxing.  I love that there is a 30 minute and a 60 minute version so I can choose which to do depending on my energy level.  The yoga is gentle and modifications are also offered.  The music and teacher's voice are soothing and stress-relieving.",1477612800,,528,4.292929292929293
8486866,4,B005UJ7HQ6,"I have not done the 60-minute practice yet, but the 30-minute practice is really very good.  I'm a recent breast cancer survivor, just trying to regain the strength and flexibility I had before this illness struck.  The poses in the 30-minute practice are easy to maintain, and the feeling when I have completed the session is one of relaxation and energy to tackle the day.  I will work up to the 60-minute session as my body begins to have more endurance.  I highly recommend this video for anyone who has been through the trails and tribulations of chemo and radiation therapies and wants to ease back into a more active life.",1430524800,4,629,4.63963963963964
8486867,5,B005UJ7HQ6,"After practicing yoga for many years, when I was going through chemotherapy I was usually so tired and under the weather that I had  no energy to do my usual routines.  This DVD was the answer for me.  It is gentle and soothing.  There are two sessions - a thirty minute and a sixty minute.  All of the women are cancer suvivors of various types, and all ages including Claire Petretti herself.  I was able to practice with this DVD several times a week.  I loved it!",1418515200,3,467,4.2988505747126435
8486868,5,B005UJ7HQ6,I just purchased Yoga for Cancer Recovery as I am recovering from cancer.  I feel absolutely amazing after doing Claire's yoga DVD. One of the best things I have done for myself post-surgery.  This was well worth every penny.  Thank you for sharing your yoga instruction with us.,1407283200,2,279,4.770833333333333
8486869,5,B005UJ7HQ6,"As a person working with Stage IV cancer, this is just the right amount of work for my battered body. I feel like I am doing something to help myself, and it feels good.

I have no hesitation recommending this to my fellow Cancer friends and even those with joint problems or minor disabilities.",1403654400,3,295,4.462962962962963
8486870,5,B005UJ7HQ6,"I am currently in treatment for Stage 3C breast cancer. Post-bilateral mastectomy, midway through chemotherapy, and a month away from six weeks of radiation treatment. I haven't been able to do my practice every day but when I am up to it, this DVD (and Rodney Yee's AM Yoga) are exactly what I need. The work is not too strenuous but definitely stretches my limits and improves my well-being physically, psychologically, and emotionally. Thank you to Claire Petretti for seeing a need and making the video!",1362441600,6,507,4.906976744186046
8486871,3,B005UJ7HQ6,If I could make one suggestion that would make this DVD more enjoyable it would be to slow down the breathing on the postures that are timed to the breath. I have to put the DVD on pause and do my own pace or I would hyperventilate for certain. Other than that it's gentle and relaxing and my body feels pretty relaxed following it.,1358294400,4,332,4.203125
