8688380,5,B00PKJA9OI,Love this video and wish Pekel had more to buy.  He's really fun and paints great.,1515715200,,82,4.125
8688381,3,B00PKJA9OI,I anticipated this would focus more on landscapes and not city scapes. Also thought it would be more step by step. Still beautiful work.,1508803200,,136,4.708333333333333
8688382,5,B00PKJA9OI,"Love watching this DVD on watercolor. Herman Pekel's philosophy impeccable. This DVD is a must for
any painter wanting to up their game. Fabulous!",1505347200,,146,5.125
8688383,5,B00PKJA9OI,"My very favorite contemporary teaching painter, full of life, energy, and boundless uninhibited creativity.",1425513600,2,107,6.714285714285714
8688384,5,B00PKJA9OI,"Herman Pekel demonstrates his very loose style as he talks his way through each demonstration.  This is a DVD to watch several times as there are subtleties easily missed in a single view.  I'm not sure this is the best place for a beginner to start as there is nothing about how to get started, or specifics about materials.  If you are past the need to be told what to buy, set up and start this is a good ""next step"".  I've watched it many times and go back after a time to watch it again, gaining something each time.",1425427200,5,521,4.18
