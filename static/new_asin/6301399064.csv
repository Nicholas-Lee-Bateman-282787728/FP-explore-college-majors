I agree with the R rating because this movie is violent. A lot of people die in this movie but it's not a scary movie or anything. It's just about a guy who wants a money and a statue and this leads him to do other things. It is a very, very interesting movie. It was on T.V. one morning. I turned on the T.V. in the middle of the movie and my attention just jumped right in. Since I didn't see the beginning I'm not positive about this next statement but I think that he kidnaped a woman in her early 20's and fell in love with her. This girl helped him get the money and the statue. A lot of other things happened but I can't tell them without giving away the whole movie. I couldn't leave the room for the rest of the movie because it was so interesting and it just grabbed my attention. The acting in this movie is outstanding. This is such a great movie. I really would recomend seing it. Even if you just rent it. This movie is very interesting. It reminds a lot of other movies like ""Set It Off"". ""Playing With Fire"" is so interesting. I wish I could tell you about but I don't want to give the movie away because they're are so many unexpected things that happen through out this movie. I'm so glad I saw it and I can't wait until I see it again, so don't hesitate to see this marvelous movie.",1005868800,,1423,4.103942652329749
