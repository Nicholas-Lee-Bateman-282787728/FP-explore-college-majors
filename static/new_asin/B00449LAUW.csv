The beautiful scenes of nature and tradional christmases, combined with music that will make your heart stop, created an unforgettable experience.  The Bible scriptures telling the Christmas story and the significance of Jesus in the world lifted this dvd to a spiritual level that I have never seen before on my tv screen.  Of all the things I possess, this dvd is the most treasured.  There are just no words to describe it.  I ordered several of them to give away as Christmas gifts. I would like to add that in a country plagued by so much sickness and evil, it is refreshing to know that there are still people in this country who can produce something so noble, beautiful and true.",1355529600,8,726,4.596899224806202
