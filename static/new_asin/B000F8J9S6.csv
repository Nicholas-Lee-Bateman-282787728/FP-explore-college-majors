8118890,5,B000F8J9S6,"The movie isn't anything new or extraordinary but I found it enjoyable.  The movie has two mysteries going on at the same time.  One mystery envolves a student's paper surrounding the legend of the ""Drowned Ghost"" the other revolves around the death of a student a year ago.  Although both mysteries entertwined at times they were both resolved and explained toward the end.",1298937600,,374,4.904761904761905
