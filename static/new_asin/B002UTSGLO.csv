8451157,5,B002UTSGLO,I love this dvd. The stretches make me feel so relaxed before bed!,1405468800,,66,4.153846153846154
8451158,5,B002UTSGLO,"I needed something to get me motivated, other than a(n expensive) personal trainer and/or gym membership.  A friend lent this DVD to me, ""No you're not pregnant but just try it!""  I'm not pregnant, nor am I a dancer- my hesitation was palpable.  Sections are short and sweet, literally.  Suzanne actually makes working out fun!  And sexy.  The best part- you can modify your workout according to the time you do or don't have!",1300752000,,426,4.6891891891891895
8451159,5,B002UTSGLO,"This is a great video!  It works up slowly from breathing exercises into cardio.  The salsa fusion is really fun, and the workout is challenging enough that I partnered up with my best friend who is not pregnant!  She even touches on Kegel exercises at the end, which is helpful.  If you do not have any dance experience it may take you a while to figure out what she is talking about.  This is a video created for dancers!",1287532800,,423,4.30379746835443
