7809010,5,6300276635,"Action, adventure, comedy, gorgeous scenery, authentic-looking costumes and settings, romance, and the most beautiful musical score I ever heard in my life! ""Return to Treasure Island"" features all that and has the added plus of containing zero profanity. It is safe and enjoyable for all ages (well, probably too much fighting for small kids, but at least there's no gore).

I taped this wonderful 10-part mini-series off the Disney Channel back in the 80s. My husband, 2 sons, and I watched it over and over again until the tapes wore out. In recent years I have repeatedly checked on Amazon to see if it was out on DVD and always came up disappointed. Nothing was available except old, used video tapes. How could something this good just disappear? Finally, to my great joy, I found this series in DVD (3-disc set with all 10 episodes) on the UK Amazon site and I was able to see my husband's face light up on Christmas morning when he opened his gift.

I'm sure glad I bought this DVD set when I had the chance because I see that it's now unavailable again on the UK site (didn't last long!) except in high-priced re-sale. It never showed up on the American Amazon site because it still hasn't come out in region-1 format. We are an American family currently living overseas and all the DVD players are region-free here. Once we move back to the States, we will have to buy a region-free DVD player in order to play these DVDs since they are in region-2 format (not US format). Well, hopefully by then, ""Return to Treasure Island"" will be availble in region-1 format. When/if that happens I hope they will add subtitles. I love the pirate talk (so quirky and funny), but a lot of the dialogue is hard to understand. It would also be nice to have some bonus features (background info on the making of the movie). A series this good deserves first-class treatment!",1231200000,,1867,4.603603603603603
7809011,5,6300276635,"This ten-part video series, Return To Treasure Island, is incomparable for its adherence to the spirit of Robert Louis Stephenson's original swashbuckler. An all-star cast is topped by Brian Blessed (the quintessential Long John Silver), and Christopher Guard (perfect as handsome young adult, Jim Hawkins).

Characterizations of various characters, such as Ben Gunn (none better), and Squire Trelawny are excellent, and new characters, like Reverend Morgan and Hawkins' love interest, Isabella, round out the cast to perfection.

The relationship between Silver and Hawkins alternates between resentment and affection, deception and compassion, and by the end of the adventure, the two have developed a bond that rivals that of father and son.

Each installment keeps the viewer on the edge of his/her seat, anticipating the next one. The screenplay is clever and profound.

Unfortunately, the series is not available on DVD, and the original video cassette recordings are hard to find. Distributor Disney, for some reason, has yet to re-distribute the series, despite numerous requests and petitions from fans. Their reasons are a mystery.",1164067200,6,1141,5.578034682080925
7809012,4,6300276635,"I loved this miniseries when it aired on the Disney Channel. In fact I still have my tapes of it. I so wish it would be released on DVD.

Basically this story takes place 10 years after Treasure Island. Jim Hawkins is now a grown educated gentleman. Long John Silver comes back into his life because he is after Flint's map. Why you may ask since all the treasure was found and taken away in Treasure Island? It would seem that only the gold was taken not the gems. The gems were hidden elsewhere and only certain clues on the map can tell where. Long John says only he knows how to decipher the map.

This miniseries returns many old characters from the original Treasure Island such as Ben Gun, as well as introducing new ones such as Keel-Haul, Vanderbrekin, & two love interests for Jim Hawkins. It is an engaging adventure story but clearly dominated by Brian Blessed's performance as Long John Silver.

If you loved Treasure Island, then you'll also enjoy Return to Treasure Island.",1151280000,5,988,4.570621468926554
