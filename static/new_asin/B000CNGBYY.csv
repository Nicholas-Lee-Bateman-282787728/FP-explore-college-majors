8099585,5,B000CNGBYY,"Christine Bennett (Megan Ward) gives up being a num and goes out into the real world with a house that she inherits. A close cousin Gene Wirth (Matt Lutz) is in a mental institution near buy. Gene has a friend there Edward Talley one of a pair of idiot savant twins (both played by Rutanya Alda) they were suspected of matricide 30years ago but never brought to trial. Christine with the aid of Det. Jack Brooks (Morgan Weisser) is determined to get to the bottom of this and put the suspicions to rest one way or another.

Looks like many people had motive and opportunity; there is a lot of finger pointing and confessions. We get to speculate and participate.

A made for TV movie based on ""The Good Friday Murders"" the first of a series of mystery books by Lee Harris all with holidays in their title. Deviates some from the book but does a fair job of filling in the background and characters around the middle of the movie. Even if you guess the who did it, it is fun to watch how they figure it out or not. This looks like a made for TV pilot. Look closely Patty Duke is Mother Joseph.",1505865600,12,1092,4.296116504854369

8099590,5,B000CNGBYY,"I saw this movie on the Hallmark Movie Channel several years ago. It's based on a true story and the director and cast
did a wonderful job on this movie. It will keep you in suspense until the very end. There is no bad language so the entire
family can enjoy watching this movie together.",1346457600,,288,4.254545454545455
8099591,5,B000CNGBYY,"Using a format similar to great television series like Murder,She Wrote; the film makers have made an interesting choice. The Mother Superior played by Patty Duke  adds great support to a former nun when she leaves  the convent. This  is well done and the character work is particularly good. Not a gory movie just entertaining! The plot tries for something different and I liked it.",1332547200,,383,4.861538461538461
8099592,5,B000CNGBYY,"This movie was so interesting to me that I researched savants online to learn more about this syndrome. Sadly, there is not a lot known about them on some sites. However, I did find links to gifted savants on Wikipedia.org. I highly recommend this movie as a family movie for preteens and up. This movie planted a seed of respect, (which has matured through research) for people who are most usually misunderstood by those who are not educated about this syndrome.",1296172800,6,464,4.7407407407407405
