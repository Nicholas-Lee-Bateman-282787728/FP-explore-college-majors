8275132,5,B0019SQI80,"I purchased this particular DVD for, basically, one reason:  I know Katrina Prefontaine.  She has, arguably, the main part in this film (some would say co-star part).  We should try to agree that it was the best part of the DVD.  I don't do spoilers, so I won't give anything away; however, with the title to this review being what it is, I think I should explain a little.

The film's premise is simple:  A woman finds that as long as she is evil and does horrible things, she doesn't die.  As she lives through centuries, she has added 3 ""sisters"" to this clan.  One of the sisters, Katrina Prefontaine, is growing tired of being bad (at least, she thinks so), and so the story goes.

It is horribly funny, not in a bad way, though.  It is very evident that they are not trying to produce a serious film and have failed; it is more apparent that they have taken a comical script and completely swept it with humor until it is billowing laughing dust everywhere.  There are places you might even feel a bit guilty laughing at; however, I think you will, anyway.

Well worth renting if you like offbeat humor boarding on slapstick at points.
I give it about 4 1/2 stars.
Have fun.",1365379200,,1180,4.387096774193548

8275134,5,B0019SQI80,"I loved this film from the moment it started.  The characters drew me in and  I felt completely immersed in their world.  I'm convinced they're still around somewhere - maybe a little below ground level, but they're there!  Hi girls!  Loved your show!",1211414400,,251,4.744186046511628
