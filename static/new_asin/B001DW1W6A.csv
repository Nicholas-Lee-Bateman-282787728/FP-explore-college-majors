8295098,5,B001DW1W6A,"I saw this series of training tutorials on the trainer/producer's website. I don't own the DVD. I can recommend it very highly to beginner's and even more advanced trainers. It covers everything from introducing a puppy to sheep to working in an open field, and even how to use a sheepdog whistle. In many cases the action is shown at half speed and then normal speed. There are also animated diagrams. The trainer obviously loves his dogs and works them with the right mix of patience, encouragement and discipline. I learned a lot and enjoyed just watching the border collies work.",1440892800,3,583,4.782178217821782
8295099,1,B001DW1W6A,No training what so  ever - only explanations about why a dog will or will not make a protection dog - do not waste your money on this series - absolute rubbish.,1388016000,2,161,4.03125
