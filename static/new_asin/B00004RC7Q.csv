7920653,3,B00004RC7Q,"In 1972 the class gang played a prank on one of the students. 10 years later they are attending there reunion and things start to go wrong when the student they picked on has turned up seeking revenge. they find themselves trapped in the school and well.... watch it to find if if your interested this far.

I picked this up in the cheapie bin, and I suggest you find it there too. It isn't worth much, honestly. It's got some pretty funny moments, but it's not classic funny like Animal House and Vacation. So find it cheap and it's worth it, but don't pay more then ten bucks.

Theres no bonus features or anything, apparently the US version comes with a booklet, but even if ours did I don't think I wouldve done more the flicked through for a glance if that.

It's not dull or boring, it flows rather well, but I predicted the plot a qaurter of the way into the movie, and I think you could too, so the end was pretty much suspected. There is some pretty good effects, espeicely for an 80's film. I heard something about this movie original intended to be a sequel to Animal House, but they obviously didn't do it that way, but the guy who played Ken Dorfman in AH is in this film as a diffrent charactor, as well as a few familuer faces but I don't know there names.

Worthy of a rent, worth the money as long as you don't have to pay alot and yur sure to get a laugh or few out of it!",1120089600,8,1390,4.137037037037037
7920654,5,B00004RC7Q,"This movie takes it's place among the greatest films of all time.  First is Citizen Kane, second Casablanca, third, well you guessed it, National Lampoon's Class Reunion!  Thank you John Hughes for writing one of the most profound movies ever to be seen and heard by the human experience.",1108339200,2,288,4.857142857142857
7920655,4,B00004RC7Q,Wacky! Goofy! Stoooopid!!! Fun! This slasher film parody has me in stitches everytime I watch it. Zane Busby as the cripple who sold her soul to the devil is one of the best character performers of all time. Her facial expressions and side comments crack me up. The late Ann Ramsey (Throw Mama From The Train)as the cafeteria worker brings back memories(?) of mystery meat lunches and creamed whatever that green goop was as part of the high school nutrition program. The few off-color bits in the film are done well and not disgusting or shocking. I've heard and seen worse on late night talk shows! All we needed now was to have Elvira show up as the guidance councillor or school nurse! A job well done on DVD.,1016496000,5,713,4.534883720930233
7920656,4,B00004RC7Q,"Little known and little remembered except by those who used to watch HBO in the 80's. An early spoof of slasher movies, Class Reunion stands out for the very funny cast of well known character actors.",1004054400,2,200,4.583333333333333
