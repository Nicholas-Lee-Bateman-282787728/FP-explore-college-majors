8520306,5,B007PF5C8I,"Very highly recommended. It says on the back of the box, running time 46 minutes. I thought uh oh. Don't even worry about it. This dvd goes through the techniques on only one side of the body. Most other dvds do both sides so basically you are paying for the same length of time. The descriptions for the techniques are narrated by a woman as the instructor demonstrates. The sound is on the quieter side on my laptop, volume only adjusts so far. Not at all a problem on a regular dvd player. This is not a studio production but is none-the-less professional and organized. The content, though,is AMAZING. This is the best dvd I have ever seen on chair massage. This man, Patrick Ingrassia, is outside of the box. I think he is the man that really invented chair massage. I can't wait to look at the other dvds I bought from Nayada.",1347494400,4,832,4.409090909090909
