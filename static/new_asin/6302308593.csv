8384293,3,6302308593,"Having finally seen 'Twenty-One', it struck me how much of air of melancholy hangs over the film - even ennui. It's almost as if the film represents a kind of quiet, bittersweet recognition that the 'freedom' and 'individualism' promised by the Conservative regime of the 1980s turned out to be cold comfort, after the various shades of grey offered by state socialism had become 'so last century!'. In that sense, just as the apparently tiresome luxury of her life mirrors the dull compulsion of the marketplace (with only a heroin-addicted boyfriend and migrant musician able to add 'earthy' colours) Kensit's character seems to be rummaging around in the hinterlands of her psyche hoping she'll find a rationale for the belief that loneliness and soulless sex can be life-affirming. I realise this might read as - how can I put it - utter bollocks, but it's just something that came to me while watching the darn thing. Anyway, it's one of 3 decent films Kensit has starred in - the other 2 being Angels and Insects (1995) and Grace of My Heart (1996).",1224806400,,1055,4.802197802197802
