2337121,5,B0009Y271C,"This is one of the best Spanish-language DVDs that I've come across.  As a bilingual mother trying to raise a bilingual child, I'm always looking for good books, games, and DVDs with authentic Spanish.  This DVD contains songs from Plaza Ssamo, which is the Mexican version of Sesame Street.  Though it's sponsored by Sesame Workshop, however, it is not a dubbed version of Sesame Street, but a totally different show with many of its own characters.  For example, instead of Big Bird it has Abelardo, a large bird with green feathers.  At the same time, it incorporates some Sesame Street favorites like Bert (Beto), Ernie (Enrique) and Elmo.  I think that makes it perfect for kids who watch Sesame Street, since they'll see those familiar faces.

I also love the songs on this DVD, as does my son.  There's Abelardo singing ""Me gusta ser yo"" (I like being me), Elmo singing about the sounds all around us, etc.  The songs are catchy and creative and the Spanish is not simplified at all, which is a big plus for me.  Even for kids who are not bilingual, learning these songs would be a great introduction to Spanish.  My son is two but I think that kids up to about age 6 would enjoy this DVD.  And more than a few parents will too!",1130198400,56,1235,4.513513513513513

2337150,5,B0009Y271C,"This movie is completely in Spanish.
Many songs, dances and characters. Made with the same quality of Sesame Street in English.
Sesame Street conveys values in children than other TV shows do not.
Presenting children of all races, nationalities and physically different.
We must teach our children diversity and tolerance at an early age, and if besides learning they have fun, much better!!

2337152,5,B0009Y271C,Very difficult to find Bilingual videos without dubbing and this one is perfect not because it is bilingual but because there is absolutely no dubbing. Thank you,1354838400,,161,5.0

2337166,4,B0009Y271C,My almost 1 1/2 yr old likes the songs on this dvd.  While it doesn't keep his attention when the characters talk he will get up and clap while swaying or jumping to the music. Our household is bilingual so I want to keep him up to speed on his spanish. What better way than letting him watch plaza ssamo once per day.,1317859200,,318,4.0476190476190474
2337167,4,B0009Y271C,I bought this video for my 20 month old son who is a complete Elmo freak. I really wanted some videos he would enjoy in Spanish and I thought this was perfect since Elmo is in the video but Elmo is not shown as much as my son would like so he looses interest until Elmo shows up again. The songs are cute but for this age group they should have more upbeat songs because little kids love to dance and this video is not something you can get up and move to.,1314662400,,456,3.913978494623656

2337169,5,B0009Y271C,"Wow. GREAT DVD! We have fallen in love with Plaza Sesamo, specifically with Grover. The DVD is geared towards bilingual or Spanish-dominant toddlers who already have a grasp of Spanish to sing along and understand the songs. It's not a ""teaching"" Spanish DVD which tend to bore both my toddler and his parents. There's a very cute clip where Grover sings about being ""peludo y azul"" and is joined by fellow Cookie Monster and Pancho - also ""peludo y azul.""",1308182400,,456,4.7125

2337171,4,B0009Y271C,"I am a Hispanic mom who had a very hard time finding variety and culturally relevant and good quality DVDs in Spanish. I was pleasantly surprised with Vamos a Cantar. If you grew up in Latin America, some of the characters will bring back memories....BETO, ENRIQUE, LOLA, la Rana Renee. There are also special appearances by popular Mexican stars. I have a one year old and he loves this DVD. It's comprised of short little stories, all weaved in together nicely, and features lots of music and songs. It's good for little ones and perfect for dancing. This DVD is not ideally for someone who is wanting a DVD with a fun Spanish lesson or is wondering What is my kid going to learn by watching this? Spanish is spoken naturally (not slow like some other DVDs that make you want to snooze if you are a native speaker). This DVD is fun and entertaining for babies/kids who love music and families that appreciate the intricacies of the Hispanic culture.",1300924800,13,951,4.6

Big disappointment because the DVD was damaged and unusable.
A piece of the case broke and scratched the surface of the DVD.
I just contacted the seller about a replacement.
I'll let you know if the DVD is worthwhile when and if I get a replacement.",1253059200,,395,4.28
2337184,5,B0009Y271C,"I found Plaza Sesamo On Demand when my daughter was about two months old.  Ironically, it was the only show she would actually sit and watch and to this day, she is going to be one year next month, it is still her one and only show.  Vamos a Cantar is one of two 55 minute DVD's I found online (and in stores) which is great because as she gets older I want her attention span to develop.  The shows On Demand or on Saturday and Sunday mornings are only about 25 minutes.  I recommend Vamos a Cantar for all children; while it is all in Spanish and I don't understand it, she seems to love it.  The songs are cute, too.  The product shipped fast and is of great quality so far and we have played it at least 5 times since receiving it about one month ago.",1231632000,,755,4.033557046979865
2337185,2,B0009Y271C,"Bought this for my 17 month old (teaching her SPanish). She was not impressed. It is filled with song after song, but no skits, no real content. It gets tired, fast. You're better off getting ""Me gusta ser yo"" and ""bienvenida la primavera"".",1204588800,2,240,4.604651162790698
2337186,1,B0009Y271C,"Our bilingual toddlers (Caribbean Spanish) are bored and unengaged by this. The songs are hard for adults and kids to learn or follow.  Just plain odd.

2337187,5,B0009Y271C,"My little girl absolutely loves this DVD!  I bought this for my daughter when she was about 17 months old.  She loved it from the very first day.  In an effort to raise our child billingual, my husband and I have taught our daughter Spanish first.  We speak to her in spanish and it is the language she predominantly understands right now.  This was a great DVD because she was able to understand it and she loves the music.
One word of warning for those of you not familiar with ""Plaza Sesamo:""  This is its own show - not a dubbed version of Sesame Street.  Some of the characters overlap with Sesame Street, but most are not the same.  Also, this DVD is primarily music, not your traditional 1-2-3 A-B-C Sesame Street program.  If that is what you are looking for, try one of the other Plaza Sesamo DVDs.",1196899200,4,807,4.3624161073825505

2337190,5,B0009Y271C,"I like this video because it is full of Spanish songs for kids.

Daughter was just not into this DVD.  It probably kept her entertain 10 mins. while I was sitting with her.  The minute I stood up, she got up also.  I tried putting on a couple of other times, but it was the same.  Maybe it's not meant for 2 years olds.  I'll keep it around, but it hasn't interested her yet.",1147392000,3,460,4.159090909090909

I have searched online, and found that poor-quality compression can cause closed-captions to be lost....??  We are trying to learn spanish, and have found that Plaza Sesamo with closed-captioning on our local spanish television station is helpful - but we wanted to be able to track back to repeat sections.

So, we were disappointed that we can't get the captions.  However, the content otherwise is quite charming.",1138406400,13,645,4.944444444444445

And sadly, the time was taken for the general dialog to be over-recorded in Spanish but ALL the songs (in the menu and throughout the program) are in English! I am a native Spanish speaker as are my parents and my children. I ordered this for my toddler and am super disappointed. He is learning Spanish first. The actual Plaza Sesamo program has several different characters and Spanish speaking actors with Spanish music and songs. The Spanish on this dvd is fluent but dubbed.
