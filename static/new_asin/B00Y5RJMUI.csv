8717543,3,B00Y5RJMUI,"I am very disappointed with the English subtitles of this film.  I thought the film itself was really good but it was very difficult to follow along as I am not a Russian speaker.  It looks like the English subtitles were generated with a computer translator and it made it a chore to follow the dialogue.  At times there were even typos.  As much as I am fascinated with the subject matter, I had to take a break in the middle because I was simply exhausted from reading the subtitles.  I think if you loved Apollo 13 and The Right Stuff then you will stick it out like me.  However, if you're not into space, then I can guarantee you will quickly loose interest because of the terrible subtitles.  This is not just a Russian accomplishment but an accomplishment for all humanity.  Even Gagarin's speech at the end is addressed to not only the Russian people but to all people of the earth.  I just wish the producers of this DVD would acknowledge that and put more care and energy for the English speakers of the world.",1457136000,4,1021,4.4171122994652405
