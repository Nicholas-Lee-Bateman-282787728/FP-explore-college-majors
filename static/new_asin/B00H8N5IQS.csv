6141301,5,B00H8N5IQS,"I am a huge Jillian fan, I have 12 of her tapes. I do them 5-6 days a week and am very happy with the workouts. That being sad, this workout made me pause the DVD and ask myself if this was real or not. The moves are hard, but very effective. The strength workout consists of 4 circuits, a warm-up, and a cool-down.

 I knew I was in for trouble when the warm-up had side lunges and running man. This DVD will get you results if you can do the moves, it is NOT for beginners at all. I had to modify half the moves and I am used to Jillian workouts. Overall, I love her tapes and this one is no exception; if you're up for the challenge, buy this DVD!",1394150400,124,650,3.8796992481203008
6141302,5,B00H8N5IQS,"I just finished both workouts back-to-back and I feel great! I'm a Jillian junkie and own every Jillian dvd. This one delivers. In terms of calorie burn, it is on par with her others (I did both back to back with just one cool down and burned almost 650 calories according to my hrm). There are two workouts: One strength (4 circuits, 39 min total) and one cardio (3 circuits, 34 min). There are similar moves as her other dvds, but with many modifications (like ONE ARMED BURPEES). An added bonus: KENTA! If you've done Body Revolution, you know what I'm talking about.",1394150400,25,570,4.543689320388349
6141303,5,B00H8N5IQS,"I love this new DVD. It has some moves from her previous DVDs and some new moves. I do her workouts first thing in the morning  before work and I like that this one with warm-up and cool-down takes 30 minutes so I'm not running late.  I particularly enjoy the abs circuit on this one. It is a seriously good work out, I'm dripping sweat when done, and will be nice change to alternate with Extreme Shed and Shred, 30 Day Shred, Hard Body and Yoga Inferno (my favs).",1394150400,7,465,4.213483146067416
6141304,5,B00H8N5IQS,"This workout rocks!  As a familiar to Jillian workouts, I must say that this is a truly fun and inspiring workout! Several  reviewers have said that the moves are the same. However, I don't agree. They are all based on moves we've seen before but with an oomph to them. It is challenging and fun! It is a great workout DVD and I look forward to results!",1394150400,24,353,4.253731343283582
6141305,5,B00H8N5IQS,"I have gone through Jillian's Body Revolution & use the Phase 3 Workouts as part of my weekly workouts. When I ordered this DVD, I was a bit ""cocky"" thinking this would be a piece of cake. Jillian has proven my wrong :)  The pace is quick, the moves challenging, yet Jillian keeps you motivated throughout. I am 47 & in the best shape of my life after working out with Jillian for over a year. You have to try this DVD ~ you have nothing to loose but those unwanted pounds. Buy it :)",1394064000,12,483,4.08421052631579
6141306,5,B00H8N5IQS,"I disagree with one of the reviewers here that says all the moves are the same. I have (I think all of Jillian's dvds as well) and I only did the strength one this morning and I was sweating and struggled at times. My legs are already sore and I still have to do cardio tonight. I was surprised because I didn't realize that I would have to do 2 half hour dvds in a day. At first I was taken aback BUT after thinking about it, it IS a 7 day shred so an hour daily for seven days makes sense. I am hurting and so far think it's a great workout. Some of the moves are similar but with a twist. Perhaps cardio has moves that are from her other dvds but I so far think it was a great dvd. I think I'm fairly fit and can't wait to see the results at the end of the seven days.",1394064000,3,771,3.765432098765432
6141307,5,B00H8N5IQS,I am a workout dvd junkie and have all of Jillian's dvds. Some of her dvds I feel are kind of slow paced but this one is fantastic! I love that it's split up into an a.m. routine and a p.m routine but if you are crunched for time I'm sure you could do both together...I love that the p.m. routine is all fast heart-pumping cardio and there are hardly any breaks! It really made me sweat!,1393977600,17,387,4.038961038961039
6141308,2,B00H8N5IQS,"I guess I was expecting something different.  I have all of Jillian's DVDs and am always impressed with them, but this was just all the same moves that she ALWAYS does, just mixed into a different format.  This workout is definitely not for beginners, but at the same time,  I really didn't feel like I got a good workout.",1393977600,12,322,4.423728813559322
6141309,4,B00H8N5IQS,"This workout is meant to be a crash course for a special event.  It's not meant to be a long term workout plan (but I'm sure it can be).  She breaks up the strength training and cardio into 2 workouts which you do complete separately (strength in morning and cardio in evening) to avoid over training.  I haven't looked at the meal plan yet but I'm sure it follows the same concept of her 1-week fixes in her books.  While she usually doesn't promote losing too much weight too fast it seems like if you follow the videos and meal plans your going to tighten up, lose some lbs if fat, and mostly lose water weight.  The moves are similar to her other videos and the absence of cardio makes you feel the burn a little more (your heart rate skyrockets anyways).  I would have liked to see the male demonstrator use heavier weights as I don't really believe this is the type of workout to give him the body he has (OMG).  They use 3lbs and I only have 5s and 8s so I used the 5s for most exercises and 1 8lb weight when they doubled up (my hand weights are bulky when you try to hold 2 in 1 hand).
I am mostly using this a way to snap me back into my workout routine.  I needed something new to get me inspired to start back up again.  For what it is for (a one week crash course) I think it will do the job.  I like the production of the video and Jillian looked great!  Would love to see reviews by others on their results.  Good luck everyone.
Thanks Jillian!",1393977600,17,1459,4.098591549295775
6141310,2,B00H8N5IQS,"This is basically the 30DS on crack.......it's a lot of the same movements, just at a higher, quicker pace. I HATE that it is split into 2 segments as well (AM for strength and PM for cardio) - stick with the 30DS where you can get cardio and strength in one workout.....and if you feel really need more than a 20 minute workout, do all 3 in the same day. Waste of $$$ IMO.",1393977600,17,373,4.054054054054054
6141311,5,B00H8N5IQS,Jillian never disappoints- Great workouts for beginner through advanced. I am advanced and it is still my go to workout when I do not make it out to OT or the gym. (Shred 1 is also a great workout!!),1507420800,,199,4.128205128205129

6141318,4,B00H8N5IQS,Always happy to add more JM to my collection. Was a bit disappointed that the cardio workout is almost identical to Fire Up 1 that comes with Bodyshred set (without as many workout friends to enjoy) but LOVE the strength workout that includes several new exercises. Definitely worth the cost.,1498521600,,292,4.86

6141322,5,B00H8N5IQS,"I was looking for something I could do everyday, see results and not take up too much time. In the morning before breakfast I did the strength training exercises. In the night before bed I did the under 30 minute cardio workout. I did not follow the menu plan completely but consitenly stayed on track with 1200 calories a day.

6141324,5,B00H8N5IQS,I love JM. I do all her workouts and find that she will give you the best results. Just a warning though- this is really not for beginners. Especially the ab work and planking. I have two toddlers and even though I'm in really good shape I don't have the abdominal strength for some of these moves. I did both workouts back to back since it really isn't possible for me to work out twice each day and I can tell you that doing this in one shot is really really really hard. This makes no more trouble zones and ripped in 30 look easy. This was definitely hard!!!,1485993600,8,562,4.165137614678899
6141325,5,B00H8N5IQS,Great video. Not for faint of heart. Need to do 30 day shred or ripped in 30 before trying this one. Saw weigh lose in first two days. Def firmer and i will continue using for next two weeks till i leave for trip. Biggest negative is finding time and energy in evening. I like doing all of my work outs in am. This one you do in am and pm. I did not follow her diet followed weight watchers diet.,1482710400,,396,3.9012345679012346

6141328,5,B00H8N5IQS,"I have gotten myself in pretty great shape this year. But I was stuck in the 130s and I couldn't get down into the 120s no matter what I tried. So I bought this DVD cause Jillian has never let me down, I've been doing her videos for years. This video is very challenging, I did the two workouts a day, but stuck to my own diet. I also work a full time job and would workout in the morning,go to work for 8 hours,come home and workout again. After a few days I was completely exhausted but I knew I had to finish this. I weighed 131 before I started. One week later I weighed myself and was 122. I lost over 10 pounds I a week with this DVD. It's super challenging but IT IS WORTH IT! If you're just starting this, do not give up. So worth it.",1479513600,,742,3.9205298013245033
6141329,5,B00H8N5IQS,Really good workout! Did for the week and now have added into my weekly workout routine 2-3 days a week and have seen changes.  Only negative is the morning an afternoon workout - but the results make it worth it.,1477180800,2,213,4.325

As a 53 y/o woman who wanted more activity with quick results, this has really worked for me. Thanks Jillian!",1473552000,4,275,4.63265306122449
6141338,5,B00H8N5IQS,She is my fav. I love all of her workouts. This will not disappoint in any way. She is pretty hardcore in all of her workouts. I would buy any of her workouts and mix them up. She does a good job of motivating you to push. push push through the workouts,1473465600,,253,3.8846153846153846
6141339,5,B00H8N5IQS,"I didn't have a big event coming up at the end of the week - I was just ready to change up my exercise routine. Having 2 intense Jillian Michael's workouts under 40 minutes long has been amazing.  I have gone beyond a week because they are both really good.  They push you but just when you're starting to get tired, you move on to the next activity. I did notice that I was more toned by the end of the first week, and that was without following the diet plan.  It's also nice to pair the weight training workout in the morning with a run in the evening.  I definitely recommend these videos, especially if you've become bored with what you're doing right now for exercise.",1473120000,3,674,4.283464566929134

6141342,5,B00H8N5IQS,"Asking me to pick my favorite Jillian workout program is like asking me to pick my favorite child - but this might be it. I love this program. Even if you just use it as two stand alone workouts instead of the two-a-day for a week like the program intends, they are amazing workouts just to work into your regular routine. I hate cardio, hate it, but I actually enjoy this cardio. The cast is great and includes fan favorite Kenta. Great bang for your buck here.",1472774400,7,462,4.32183908045977

6141347,5,B00H8N5IQS,This is a great and hard workout that is done in 30 min for the morning/strength and 30 min for the evening/cardio. Just make sure to hydrate and eat a good protein and carb mix pre and post workout.,1469923200,,199,4.128205128205129
6141348,5,B00H8N5IQS,"I bought this because I was looking for a quick way to get ready for a wedding I am attending.  I wanted to fit into a certain dress and needed to lose a few lbs to do so.  I completed the full week but am going to do a few extra days, three to be exact before I leave.  I did not follow the exact diet but tried to stick to a 1200-1400 calorie a day along with the workouts.  I have a good amount of weight to lose but was able to lose a little over 6lbs in the three days that I did this and do feel more toned.

The only negatives are - you have to work out 2x a day AM & PM, which often  means, two showers, two sets of workout clothing and motivating yourself twice.  Secondly some of the moves are pretty darn hard, 1 handed Burpees, Bears, etc.  I did modify things a bit.

I would suggest this if you wanted to use it as one final push a week or two before an event or vacay!",1469491200,12,883,3.755434782608696
6141349,2,B00H8N5IQS,I usually love Jillian Michaels. I've been a 30 day shredder for years! But this was a disappointment. The exercises move so fast I can't get my form right and she doesn't explain many of them well. Lots of the exercises rely heavily on your wrists (ex: reverse plank) and I found that my wrists hurt too much to do this every day. I went back to the older 30 day shred video - it's much easier to follow and she provides better ways to make your workout harder or easier.,1469404800,4,472,4.197802197802198

6141353,5,B00H8N5IQS,"This workout is amazing. I am a runner and I do all of jillian dvds a few days a week. I have the 30 day shred, ripped in 30, 6 week 6 pack and body shred. I love them all and I love this one. The strength workout is very challenging. I was able to use 5lb weights for everything and it definitely raised my heartrate. As always jillian keeps you moving throughout the circuits. I waited about 2 hours and then did the cardio. Wow. As a runner I'm always concerned about my strength workouts not having enough cardio. The strength portion definitely gets your heartrate up and the cardio portion left me feeling like I just finished a distance run. Jillian 100% delivers with this workout series. As always she has a beginner modification but this, unlike 30 day shred and ripped in 30, is not a beginner workout. This is definitely for people looking for that extra push. Jillian had an incredible ability to make you feel like she's standing in the room yelling at you to keep going!",1467072000,3,985,4.417582417582418

It's HARD (but awesome).  I thought I was in good shape before, but after buying this dvd- it makes me feel like I am pushing myself to the limits.  I love it- but there is NO WAY I could do it every day. I do it a few days a week and sometimes just do the cardio or just the strength... Both are great on their own.  I love this dvd, but I have to be feeling ""top-notch"" to do it.  I recommend it if you really want to push yourself to a whole new level.

I used 5 and 8 pound dumbbells for the strength workout. The data is from my Wahoo Fitness HRM. This was a great workout! I see why Jillian recommends doing the workouts in the am and pm and not together. I am a runner. I keep a 6 mile base and up my millage when training for a half marathon, so my cardio is in good shape. With that said I was pretty spent after the strength workout, so I was not full throttle on the cardio workout...but gave it my all.

The other reviews are accurate when they say that if you have weak wrists or wrist problems, this isn't for you. Likewise with the aerobic work out. There are some great exercises but the ones in a plank type pose (and there are many) are quite straining on the wrists. For a great work out, with out the joint strain, I'd recommend Beach Body over this.",1464912000,2,474,4.588235294117647

6141360,5,B00H8N5IQS,"This video is amazing. Like all of Jillian's workouts, the moves are challenging, but very doable even for those who are relatively inexperienced. My caveat is that If I hadn't started with the 30 Day Shred, I would've probably found the effort required here to be too challenging. There are plenty of modifications if you need to use them, but even with a few modifications, it's still a great workout. I'm also using the meal plan, which I've modified since I'm vegetarian. After only two days, I am craving sugar, salt, and carb-heavy snack foods so much less (though I'd kill for a glass of wine).

I also can't find time for 2 workouts a day but just did them together and it was definitely doable. This is not something a beginner or somebody just starting out could do. I like it to throw in a mix to my normal routine. If you like other Jillian DVD's then you'll definitely love this. It is a bit more challenging.,1458259200,,494,4.051020408163265

6141380,5,B00H8N5IQS,"I've never watched ""The Biggest Loser,"" but I was still a little hesitant to buy a Jillian Michaels DVD because I know her reputation as an incredibly tough trainer. It's been quite a while since I worked out intensely on a regular basis, but I have been nothing but pleased with this DVD! I was surprised that I could do almost all of the moves (using the beginner modifications) and that gave me some much needed confidence to push through the workout. I did have to modify some of the modified moves, but I'm certain that as I grow stronger, I can do them as shown for beginners with a little of the more advanced moves in the mix. Jillian is motivational and not irritating. The moves are challenging, but not impossible. After doing the routines, I honestly FEEL better. It's almost like I feel leaner during the workout and immediately afterward. I look forward to doing these each day rather than dreading them. I know that it's a 7-day shred, but it's easy to see how you could do these routines for longer periods of time without getting bored by adding her modifications. I was incredibly sore after the second day, but the soreness began working itself out by days 3-4. I coupled this with a good balanced diet and was actually down almost 3 pounds and feeling a differnce in my clothes after just two days! I would HIGHLY recommend this DVD to anyone!",1455840000,3,1363,4.544715447154472

You're supposed to do one workout in the morning and the other in the evening, but I just use one or the other to pepper in with my other workouts throughout the week so I get another cardio or weight workout in as needed. The strength training is ok, but I personally love the cardio workout on this one. It starts right off out of a cannon and is done in a half an hour - great for when I have less time in the day! I'm in shape but it gets me huffing and puffing! If you are familiar with JM, you'll recognize some old moves, or new twists on old moves, and there are some new ones too. As usual she has backup people, one each to demonstrate beginner and advanced moves. I recommend this for beginners and advanced fans alike.

I have plateaued on weight which is fine as I am at my goal weight, but I still have a lot of toning to do and I need an alternate cardio option soon as the treadmill is in the garage and being in an unheated area just won't work in western new york very shortly! :-)  I am also standing up in a wedding on 10/10 and wanted the ""pick me up"" before the big day.

Before I purchased this, I read the reviews and have to say someone's comment about Jillian being Satan's motivational little sister (which was hilarious) was RIGHT.  I watch all the new videos before I actually do them, and this one terrified me to the point of using some choice words and cocking my head at odd angles to figure out just what the....heck they were doing.  I did the strength DVD for the first time on 10/2 and have done it each day since.  I am not kidding, I totally see a difference already and I have really enjoyed some of the new moves.  Pants I wore to work just last week were looser on me today!!  As others have commented, they use the 3lb weights but as always she challenges you to push yourself, so I am using my 5s.

It's been a week and without doing the meal plan and doing only 2 workouts some of the days I was able to loose 4 lbs.

I also felt that some of the moves were strange and it didn't seem to all flow as most of her workouts do. However, LOVED the cardio workout on this one.

The strength workout requires dumbbells, I used 3s, 5s, 8s, and 15s--you'll want more than one size, though I guess you could get away with just 5s.

Both the strength portion and cardio go at a fast clip, and both are definitely challenging. The trainer unfortunately stresses me out by yelling too much at the viewer/exerciser; my heart does not need to be stressed out outside of the voluntary exercise. That is one very negative point of this workout for me. Among the positive points however are the facts that the advanced exerciser of the strength portion clearly is challenged by the regimen, so if HE is, I am pretty proud that I can follow along with him (probably not as gracefully, needless to say), and the fact that the exercisers have a connection with the trainer and want to follow her along. Given the way they all look, I take it as a good sign! Lots of planks (in both the strength and cardio segments,) some push-ups ----here the  push-ups are side-to-side ones, and very difficult, excellent and lengthy ab work in the strength portion,  there also is abdominal work in the cardio  (some are done standing, some in a plank position while kicking to the side of the body), running and jumping (not just jump rope) are also big in the cardio section.

6141502,5,B00H8N5IQS,"I own nearly every Jillian DVD, and have loved most all of them.  I am in fit shape, healthy BMI and have been doing intense JM workouts for 4 years (I also run decent distances)...with that said, this DVD STILL challenges me!  Which is what I needed/wanted, so once again I am glad Jillian delivered!  In fact to be honest, when I got this and did it the first time, I was so tired and challenged, I didn't do it again for a while...it's one I kind of dreaded to do, but lately I've decided to face that fear and have been doing it consistently and I have been actually enjoying the challenge and am happy to see results!!  I feel so accomplished when I finish.

I would say this is harder than the 30 Day Shred, as well as Ripped in 30, I compare 7 Day Shred to these since they are the most similar.  Hopefully this gives potential buyers an idea of what they are getting (in for!).  If I was starting fresh, I'd do 30 Day, Ripped THEN 7 Day. It is that much more challenging.

The format is also the same circuit routines as before, you do each circuit twice.  With the morning strength it is 35 mins long (including warm up) and is 4 circuits.  The evening cardio is 30 mins and 3 circuits total.  Both have some moves you'll have seen on other DVD's like rock star jumps, circle runs, plank jacks in the cardio portion...strength has among other things deadlifts w bicep curl, pendulum lunges with bicep curl and plie hops with calf raise/arm weights.  There are also newer moves or variations of moves.  One armed burpee's are a challenge, so are side to side push ups and pike crunch with Russian twists, but Jillian also mixes in some moves that are a *tiny* beat easier to let your heart rate come down for a minute in between. I think it's a nice mix of traditional moves and moves with a twist!  I honestly don't mind some of the repeat moves, because they get results!  It's hard to improve upon lunges, squats, plank, crunches, other than adding weights which is what she does.

Overall I've **already recommended this DVD to friends as I would to any buyer who is looking to step things up.  It is hard work, but well worth it!  If you are still finding your fitness and a bit of a beginner, I'd recommend instead 30 Day Shred or Ripped in 30.",1421712000,14,2258,4.31042654028436

6141504,4,B00H8N5IQS,"Well, let's see.  Some info about me.  I am an advanced exerciser - have been working on 5-6 days a week for 7+ years - I have done all her other DVDs as well as many others and running 5ks etc.  I'm 5' 4"" and weighed about 125 at the beginning of this workout and came down to 123.5ish by the end.

The first day I did this I was very gung-ho and excited.  I didn't have a big event to get ready for, I just wanted to try to get the holiday pounds off quickly.  I DID NOT FOLLOW THE MEAL PLAN OR EVEN LOOK AT IT.  I'm already a very sensible eater and I'm a vegetarian so most meal plans don't fit me anyway.  May or may not have had better results following the meal plan. The first 3 days I did both workouts, the remaining 4 days I simply did not have time to do two workouts - this is a tough expectation even for a week I think for most people.  Who has time for an almost 40 min workout in the morning and 30 min in the evening and then you're taking 2 showers a day too?  That said, I think the workout worked well.  I wanted to lose an entire 5lbs, but that was probably unrealistic considering I didn't follow the mean plan and didn't even do the workout twice a day the last 4 days (I alternated - strength one day and cardio the next).  The biggest difference I noticed was that my stomach look flatter and I could feel myself getting stronger by day 3.  The fist day I thought she was out of her mind on some of those moves.  By the third day I had most of the moves down (not perfect, but improving), and by the end I was doing them pretty well.even the advanced version.

This workout is exactly what it's marketed as... a crash diet/exercise plan.  Sometimes you just need to get the weight off I suppose however you have to do it, but it's better to allow yourself more time than to kill yourself for a week.  These workouts left me exhausted and you put yourself at a higher risk of injury.  I was also starving after completing these, so it was difficult to watch what I was eating.  I think this type of exercise plan can too easily put you in the mindset of ""I'm working out this hard, I should be able to eat whatever I want.""  Not to mention, I think it would be very easy to put the weight back on as soon as you get back into a more normal routine.

All in all, she does what she promises.  I suppose it depends how bad you want it and what your tolerance level is if you can stick to the program.  Also, like I said - the time is an issue for anyone who works for a living.  Good luck!",1421280000,6,2511,3.9859719438877756

6141509,3,B00H8N5IQS,"Ok let me be completely honest here. You can shred weight fast but it will come back faster than you think. I like the video and Jillian but just listening to her voice over and over is annoying each day. You have to mute the tv and put on your own music. The diet plan is really what helps you loose weight. Eating just over 1200 calories along with working out is key to dropping the weight fast with this video. I am not a proponent of this method but I do understand that things/events come up and people need to drop weight. However, I will say this video definitely improved my strength. The cardio section is boring to me but that could be because I am used to running outside. I would recommend this to intermediate exercise enthusiast who do not have a gym. Worth the money to supplement your exercise routine but do not get hung up on dropping pounds quickly.",1420329600,4,869,4.337423312883436
6141510,5,B00H8N5IQS,"I am an avid Jillian Michaels fan, and I love the way her workouts are structured. I own 30 Day Shred, Ripped in 30, Shred It With Weights, 6 Week Six-Pack, and now this DVD. (Just to give you an idea of who I am, I'm 5'6"", 170 lbs, and I hate cardio.)

There are two workouts on this DVD: a morning weight-based routine, and an evening cardio routine. You're supposed to do the weight workout in the morning and the cardio in the evening, although I did them back to back the first time. You only need one set of light weights for the first workout (I used two 5lb weights), and none of for the second (although if you really want to make it harder, try doing some of these moves with light weights).

The weight workout is FANTASTIC - by far Jillian's most challenging and intense, at least of the videos I've done. Don't be fooled into thinking you're not going to get a cardio workout also; my heart rate averaged 155 during this 37-minute routine. If you're a real beginner, or if you've never done one of Jillian's workouts before, this probably isn't the place to start. The moves are often complicated and the pace is fast, so if you're not used to her style you'll be pausing to figure out what the heck she's doing. I consider myself to be pretty well versed in her workouts and even I had to stop and watch a couple of the moves. Overall, you're going to get a killer full-body workout in 37 minutes, which beats the heck out of an hour on the elliptical at the gym. (My heart rate monitor said I burned about 345 calories doing this one.) This is also a good weight training video to travel with, since you only need light weights - and really, it would be almost as effective without any weight at all. You could easily substitute two full water or shampoo bottles and get the same basic effect.

The cardio workout....I'll be honest, I kind of hated it. But in the spirit of full disclosure, I hate pure cardio anyway (a spin class is my personal hell). This one is like taking every cardio circuit from 30 Day Shred and Ripped in 30 and mashing them together into one 35-minute cardio torturefest. There are a couple breaks here and there (like plank-jacks, lucky you!) but for the most part you're jumping around like a maniac for half an hour. However, it is a surefire calorie burner - it was slightly shorter than the AM weights workout, and it burned about 30 more calories according to my heart rate monitor. So if you're a cardio junkie but you get bored on the treadmill/elliptical, this is probably a great workout for you. You can also modify it if it's too intense - especially if your knees are bad - so you can give yourself some relief if necessary.

Overall, this is a fantastic new release and definitely one I will use regularly. And honestly, it's about half the price of a movie (I live in NYC) so it's worth the investment. Happy sweating!",1419984000,60,2874,4.386491557223264

This is the longest workout style that I have been able to stick to mainly because it is predictable and it delivers results. I use this particular DVD when I need a challenge or feel like I have more in me. I am minusing one star because: 1) some of the movements in strengths like reverse planks are questionable of its purpose and just seem like a time filler, 2) some movements in the cardio like bear is way too difficult to do no matter how many times I have worked out to it and 3) the cardio is knees killer. With that, unless you have knees of steel and flexibe like a rubber band - I don't recommend anyone to do this without a break between workout days. In fact, I didn't do both workouts on the same day but broke it up like some others by alternate each workout every day. I did take a break on day 4 and resume to a total of 6 days. I saw results in appearance and endurance when I went back to do her other dvds. I also recommend to take that one day break because without it I would lose stamina due to lack of energy and painful knees and feet from all that jumping.",1419724800,3,1138,4.039823008849558

It has two parts 30 min strength and 30 min cardio. Doing both in one day is pretty challenging, however will get you shredded for sure.
If you're not in a I-need-to-loose-weight-in-a-week situation, you could alternate the two workouts.
The strength part is truly great, and for the most difficult moves there are modification accessible to anyone.
Cardio, will make you huff and puff, as expected. You get modifications here too, so no risk of despairing.
If you haven't worked out in a while, I would not start here. The biggest risk would be despairing for the effort required and quitting altogether. However, if you are somewhat fit, and used to a little sweating, this work out is GREAT!",1419552000,,730,4.848

6141528,4,B00H8N5IQS,"First off, I have to admit that I did not get this DVD to get ""shredded"" in one week. I bought it because I like a lot of Jillian's old workouts and have been a little underwhelmed with a lot of her recent offerings e.g. Kickbox Fast Fix, and reading the reviews, this promised to be a challenge, at it delivered.

Jillian returned to the things I like best about her DVDs, the short, fast but super effective workout. Sure, I think No More Trouble Zones and Banish Fat Boost Metabolism are awesome workouts (both super effective get them, if you don't have them yet, they're essentials) but usually if I can commit 50 odd minutes to an exercise DVD, it means I have time go for a run or go to the gym instead for a more comprehensive workout. With this DVD, Jillian is back to pushing you to your limits in a relatively short time as long as you're willing to give it your all.

As has been said, this DVD is divided into 2 parts, the strength training part is first and runs for nearly 40 minutes. The cardio comes second and is a little over 30 minutes long. Both workouts are very intense. This is Jillian at her best. Imagine the high points of NMTZ for the strength but MORE intense and the best BFBM for the cardio but HARDER and you can kind of know what you're in for. If you're not familiar with any of the Jillian Michaels' workouts I'm referencing, to cut to the chase, this is NOT a beginner's workout. Start with 30 day shred. I'd rate this video appropriate for an intermediate to advanced exerciser. If you've done a cycle of 30 Day Shred or Ripped in 30, then you can probably do this.

I didn't actually do the 2 workouts a day. I'm not one for 2-a-days. It doesn't really work with my schedule and I like to have one workout session and be done with it. As I said, I wasn't looking to get shredded in 1 week so I did these workouts on alternate days- strength one day, cardio the next, then strength, then cardio, and so on. I still found it pretty effective as I could tell my body was changing from doing this workout over time and I can see how doing 2 workouts a day of this, you would definitely see a change within a week. I'm a hobby runner (sub 30 5k) and I consider myself an intermediate to advanced exerciser. If you set store by such things, according to my Polar HRM, I burn anywhere from 300-400 calories doing either the strength or cardio workouts which isn't a bad calorie burn for a circa 30-minute workout.

This workout is definitely a shredding workout. I got the Amazon Instant version so I can't say that it comes with any meal plan, and even if it did, I'd probably still follow my own, but possibly on Jillian's site, there might be more info on the meal plan she refers to on the cover image. I would have called this a 5 star workout except for Jillian. Whilst she is the kind of trainer that will work you out, she has a tough love approach that has always rubbed me off the wrong way. If maybe you used to play a sport or work well with the bootcamp-style trainer, you probably won't mind this. But I'm a self-motivated sort of person, I'm either going to push myself or I'm not, and I don't do well with being pushed or ranted at by others. In fairness, this is not unique or specific to this Jillian video, this is just her training personality as one has seen through the years on the Biggest Loser etc. I remove one star because Jillian is not my style of trainer. However, it's not her fault, she has her style; I'm the one that keeps coming back to her because her workouts are so so effective.",1417737600,6,3548,4.259643916913946
6141529,5,B00H8N5IQS,Good workouts. Must start on the Weekends; because it really is hard to work out 2times a day. On work days; I just combined them together. Didn't follow diet. Protein shakes for breakfast; sometimes lunch. Reasonable dinner & salad. By Friday I had pizza:( But lost 4 pounds in 1 week. I'll try to follow diet more; that's pretty important.

I have all of Jillian's videos, I am in love with Insanity and have done p90x and 21 day fix, having said that, I am not in super insane shape by any means!! or still not trying to lose weight!! Today is day one of the One Week Shred. My alarm didn't go off this morning so I wasn't able to do the strength before work today, but I did do them both tonight. I thought they both went by very fast (but this could be because it was new to me and when you don't know what is yet to come you are not waiting for the next exercise or the end of the video). Like the other reviews said, I was veeeery sweaty during both videos, which I love! I am not really sure what I expected this video to be but I was not disappointed with it. Some people mentioned ""crazy new moves that are unnecessary"" or that there are some of the same moves as her last videos.. Well I found nothing too ""crazy"".. challenging yes, but isn't that the point of a new workout DVD?? and yes maybe a few moves I have seen before, but if they work then why wouldn't you have them in there or want to do them? Isn't that just a reassurance that the move DOES work?? Anyways.. Its $10 at Walmart.. so far after my first day I would def. say its worth the $10! I will update my opinion again at the end of my first week. I chose to not follow the diet though, so my results might not be as positive as peoples who did. I am sure the diet would make a big difference, but I eat pretty good as it is and im way too broke to buy the specific food they ask for to be perfectly honest lol. I am looking forward to tomorrow to do them both again! and in the end see what my results are.. I am not expecting the 7 pounds.. or even close to that! but knowing that I worked out twice a day for a week will just make me feel better inside and give me even more motivation to keep going!! .. Well.. until we meet again 6 days from now!",1413244800,,1945,3.914141414141414
6141536,4,B00H8N5IQS,"I would have liked to give this less stars, but the truth of the matter is that it does what it says it will do. If you stick to the workout and the diet plan, you will drop weight quickly. Having said that, this was the most miserable 7 days of working out I've ever done. Most of that is due to the fact that you have to work out twice a day. If you've done P90X doubles, this will be a breeze for you and won't bother you at all. If you're only used to working out for thirty minutes to an hour once per day like me, you'll hate it.

Jillian says the combined workouts are an hour long. They're actually an hour and ten minutes. The AM weight lifting workout is forty minutes and the PM cardio workout is thirty minutes. The weight lifting workout has four segments, while the cardio has three. I probably would have liked the weight lifting one more if it was three segments like the cardio.

For weight lifting, you use three pound weights. It's not horribly challenging, but it's still a good workout. The cardio is pretty easy. There are some moves in the weight lifting workout that had me scratching my head. I've come to the conclusion that a lot of these fitness gurus make up their own moves so that they'll have something new and fresh to present to people.

This workout is challenging. If you're extremely out of shape, don't expect to make it through in an hour. The first day of this, it took me literally 4 hours to complete both workouts. By the end of the week, I still couldn't get through them without taking a few breaks, but I had managed to drop it down to an hour and a half. Thankfully, the body adapts quickly. The moral is, the first day will be murder, but just stick with it, and it will get easier as your strength and stamina builds.

Overall, I give this DVD 4-stars. It lost a star for the split workouts, which I found to be miserable. But, that's personal preference. My favorite Jillian Michaels DVD is still 30-Day Shred.",1413072000,6,1960,4.303523035230352

She brings a new workout experience with this DVD. I consider myself at an advanced level, and this was tough. At this point Insanity seemed easier than this.

I followed her advice and did the weight training in the morning and cardio in the evening, but I am not a morning person, so had to switch to doing it all in the evening. I found the weight training more difficult than the cardio, but don't get me wrong, the cardio is not for the faint of heart either.

I didn't follow her nutrition plan, but was not looking to loose weight rather to do a challenging work out and it was challenging. Her marketing ""lose 7lbs in a week"" may work for someone who just starts and loses a lot of water weight, but not for someone who works out regularly and eats right.

If I only have one block of time in my day to work out (and not 2 separate 30-minute blocks), then I can complete both segments for one brutal (but effective!) hour.

I am into intense workouts, and I appreciate trainers who want to push you to your best potential. Having also completed Insanity, I would like to point out that Jillian makes you understand WHY you're going through the workout. You feel the muscles Jillian is targeting, you understand the range and variety of moves she introduces. I totally appreciate that she'll target one muscle group, move onto the next, and by the time you repeat the circuit you still have energy to keep going and repeat. With Insanity, I felt like all reason was out the window and I was just scrambling the whole time and sometimes I forgot why I was even working so hard.

Jillian is very motivating and has a good sense of humor. Her assistants are on-point and she always illustrates the safe way to do the exercises. I love the combination of body resistance and weights, and the killer 2-weight-in-one-hand moves too!

(I did not use Jillian's plan as it was extremely low in calories but I cut starch, sugar, and alcohol from my diet and ate a lot of veggies).
With healthy eating in place, and really giving it your best-you can achieve great results with this DVD.  I looked more toned, especially in the waist and arms and I certainly felt stronger.  I plan on using it as maintenance on the weekends  and/or rotating it in my daily exercise.
Commit to it for a week and go for it!  You will get great results!",1409788800,3,803,4.141935483870967

I can now get through it with a sense of accomplishment and feel great the next day. It feels like I worked out for one hour when it is just under 30 minutes long! You will sweat! The AM Strength section I got through without stopping the first time around, and didn't find as challenging, but it's still a good option on the DVD. I didn't make this purchase to lose weight in one week - I was just curious to see what the workouts were like. I have almost all of Jillian's other DVDs, so I thought why not try this one too. I use the cardio workout now a couple of times a week, it is especially great when I am short on time - I get a solid workout done in a 1/2 hour. You could do the whole DVD in just over an hour, with the warm up & cool down, if you were looking for some variety. As far as losing 7 pounds in one week, I am not too sure - but I lost 1.5 lbs the first week, just switching from cardio one day to strength the next day, back to cardio again...I did not do both workouts in one day as she suggested. I just rotated workouts each day for 5 days and still lost some weight, so I am happy!",1409097600,3,1277,3.896551724137931

I love taking all of her different DVD's and combining the different ones  deveryday.

I didn't look at Jillian's diet plan (which the claim is you have to do with the video), but I have just been avoiding soda and keeping total calories to about 1300 per day.  I think it is also important to note the video is only intended to be done for one week for the purpose of a big change.  Anyway, I am on day five today, and I have lost 3 pounds.  Things are getting less jiggly.  There are modifications throughout the video, so there is never an excuse to stop moving.  While the videos could get boring doing the same thing seven days in a row, the upside is if you aren't a fitness guru, you can push yourself toward the 'advanced' version of every move so even though the video is repetitive you can feel yourself doing new things each day.  While one video is 'strength' and the other is 'cardio', both have elements of both and they are pretty easy to fit into a day because each is about 30 minutes.

If you like Jillian's Banish Fat Boost Metabolism (BFBM) & No More Trouble Zones (NMTZ), then you will LOVE this DVD!!  I love both BFBM & NMTZ, but the problem is, I don't always have a full hour to work out.  Therefore, this DVD is perfect because here you have one 30 minute INTENSE cardio segment, and another 30 minute pure strength training segment.  The workouts are easy to follow and will make you sweat and BURN calories.

At this time, I have no intentions of following the one week shred program; I do however, plan on alternating days between the strength and cardio workouts. This DVD is versatile.  Even if you only work out once a day, 6 x a week alternating between cardio & strength days, I am positive you will see results!

If you plan on following the One Week program (AM & PM workout along with diet plan), I am sure it will work!  But keep in mind, results will vary. The back of the DVD itself has a disclaimer stating ""actual results will vary based on starting weight, etc,""

I didn't realize this video has an AM and PM workout, one strength training and the other cardio. I prefer her 3-2-1 method, which mixes both. There isn't a chance I would exercise twice a day, so I have to pick one over the other. Other than that, the moves are pretty much her usual torture.",1402963200,5,419,4.185185185185185

6141593,4,B00H8N5IQS,"I bought this thinking that I would just do the workouts without the diet. I looked at the diet, but it is shockingly low on carbs (there are a few, but not many). That would contribute to a significant amount of weight loss without the workout. In fact, as a seasoned South Beach dieter, there is a 2 week phase that is carb free, I have (in the past) lost 7 pounds in a week eating like that WITHOUT exercising. When I don't eat carbs, I'm dragging. DRAGGING. I can't conceive of doing this workout program for a week on that diet. Here's the rub- this workout is INTENSE. You might have suspected Jillian was trying to kill you in her other videos. She really is. This workout program convinced me of that. :-)

So I didn't get shredded. I didn't even get slightly slimmer. I got tired. And the thing is, I really like the workouts. They are good and I think they really would do exactly as they were designed if I followed all the rules of the diet.

Friendly tip: I fast forward to about 1:49 on the AM workout because I can't stand her awkward introduction to the dude that is in the video. Really? ""Something pretty to look at."" Ugh.

The AM workout is the strength training portion, and it is so weird to see a muscle-y dude using 3 lb weights. But the workout is decent and most of it is pretty intense. Three pound weights for most people is probably okay. I find the first circuit is mostly okay with 5 lb weights though. It works the back.

The rest of the circuits that use weights I use 3's, although the last move, the cauldron crunches, I used 8's.

PM- This workout is 100% cardio. If you're following the diet, I recommend eating a small snack about 30 minutes before this workout, because you will DIE. She launches into cardio immediately.

The most valuable part of this DVD for me is that I finally have a 30 minute pure cardio workout to use after an intensive weight training session. Jillian usually does workouts that combine strength and cardio, so that is usually not easy to come by in my Jillian library.  I love her Kickbox Fast Fix, but they are only 20 minutes beginning to end, so often I have to rewind a bit to repeat a circuit or two to get to 30 minutes.

Okay, so bottom line: these are both awesome workouts. I think for one week, it's doable, although I have not yet done it for a week with the diet as well.

I don't think that I could stick to this longer than a week at a time because it is soooooo exhausting. Plus, I don't like working out twice a day.  It is important to remember that this dvd is only intended to be a one week program that is used just occasionally.

As for my lack of results, I blame myself. I know Jillian hasn't let me down. This program is good- the workouts are insane, the diet will be effective. Next time I try this, I will follow both the diet and exercise plan. But it might be March or April before I feel that motivation again. :-)",1402617600,2,2910,4.253623188405797

I found the weight training portion to be awkward to do in comparison to other JM workouts. I LOVED the cardio program however, even though one morning I thought I was going to throw up from the exertion!

If you invest in the DVD I would recommend that you do cardio in the morning and weight training in the evening, which is the reverse of what JM recommends in this DVD. The reason is that your body needs carbs to burn during weight training and if you're getting up to workout before you go to the office chances are you are planning to eat breakfast a little later. Doing weight training without fueling at least 45 minutes beforehand is actually detrimental to your muscles so don't do it!

I am 60 and I have my own business and I don't always have time for an hour workout, so I skip it. Not helpful.  I found some of Jillian's workouts on YouTube and tried them - loved them - and ordered several.  For me, Jillian's commentary is more motivational than any of the others I have tried - from the dark ages - Jane Fonda - to current - Bob Harper (also from Biggest Loser).  Her workouts are challenging and she keeps me motivated throughout the entire workout.  Which is important because these are 20 to 30 minute workouts and you cannot afford to rest, lollygag, or phone it in.  Am I beat at the end? Absolutely!

So while it may be focus on weight training, you do not rest so my heart rate was up the entire time.  I clocked it at 39 minutes from start to finish and 300 calories for the workout.  I use between 5-10 lbs. weights.  The last 2 sets do have some moves that were a bit complicated for me.  I am not that coordinated.  But, I did the best I could and then went back and watched it carefully to pick up on the correct form.  I haven't done the cardio yet, so I can comment on that part of the video.  The weight training part is a definite keeper.  I like that there were some familiar moves and then some of the moves were totally new.  I like the challenge of using my brain and body at the same time.  The compound moves really make me have to think about what my body is supposed to be doing.

By day 3 I was increasing the weights on certain moves. I drank a lot of tea at night, the diet is around 900 calories so had to stay ""full"". I also walked my dog 3 - 5 miles a couple times and jogged with my other dog 3 miles just once in the week. I burnt 5970 calories in that week. Make sure to keep up your water intake, you sweat. Yesterday was my first rest day, it was appreciated! Now to figure out what to follow it up with, they were tough, but I have 10 more pounds to go.  I only went 4 stars because of the 7lb in 7 days.

I was rotating between weeks 3 & 4 of ""Ripped in 30"".  This one is harder and just what I wanted.  Jillian uses 3 lb weights and challenges you to use 5 or 8's.  I use 8 lbs throughout most of it, but the weights are not the hard part.  I'm just doing the strength workout, but have done the cardio workout a few times.  I will definitely do the cardio as a 2nd workout when I feel I need a little more.  The strength workout is plenty.  I have done ""30 day Shred"" and feel it is too easy.  I like ""No More Trouble Zones"", but it is a 45 minute workout, so I save for the weekend.  I'm 47 years old and I don't think I could live without Jillian.  I hope she comes out with more of these harder workouts.  When I first started Jillian it was tough, but after a few weeks you can't get enough. 30 minutes is all the time I have to workout, so I really want to be challenged in those 30 minutes.

I'm sore in new places and I feel good when I finish the video. I'm not following the eating plan so cannot comment on that.

6141633,5,B00H8N5IQS,"First off Id like to say that I workout pretty intensely about 6 days a week and I also use my fitbit to get at least 10k steps per day, so I'm pretty active.  I've also been actively working to lose the last few pounds of some leftover baby weight. I regularly do Bob Harper, and Jillian Michaels workouts so when I saw this I thought awesome, a new workout to add to my rotation.  I did the morning and evening workout for 3 days straight (which I swear I noticed a difference after just 1 day), then I took a day off for rest, and did 3 more morning and evening, etc.  I decided to continue the workout into the 2nd week, I probably did it morning and night about 3 more times.  Don't get me wrong it is tough and you will feel it, but it is seriously amazing how much my body has changed just over the past week and a half - my husband keeps mentioning it to me as well...like everyday!

Also I want to mention that the majority of the moves are moves I have never done before, and I have done them all, that made the workout exciting and challenging.

Just to put it in perspective, I weigh myself regularly but that's not super accurate with muscle etc, so every few months I take the same measurements and I record them in a book I have.  Last Sept I took my measurements, then again mid March, I had lost about 2.5 inches total - so whats that over like 6 months.  Well from mid March (I started the DVD about a week later), till the end of March I lost 3.5 inches.  So basically it took me 6 months to lose 2.5 inches but only a couple weeks to lose 3.5 inches with this DVD, that to me is incredible, and the main reason why I'm continuing to do the DVD morning and night, I'm seeing serious results so why not continue.  Total since starting the DVD I have lost about 3 lbs, and I don't have that much weight to lose, so that's really good for me.  But the muscle tone and the way my clothes are fitting has really changed, I still can't believe how little time it took.

Get this DVD, you won't be disappointed!!",1396656000,46,2024,4.096202531645569
6141634,5,B00H8N5IQS,I didn't buy this workout for a one week goal. I just really like Jillian's style so I have a lot of her dvds. So I don't do both of the workouts in the same day. I alternate between strength and cardio everyother day. I would consider myself in pretty good shape and I find these workouts though but not impossible. I get a great workout and feel they are challenging enough that I come back for more cause I want to do better.,1396656000,,428,4.107142857142857

I've done thousands of workout dvd's in my time, and this is one of my most favorite! I highly recommend this DVD!  It's not for the faint of heart.  The ""PM cardio"" segment is full of explosive moves: squat jumps, butt kicks, high knees, etc.  I love anything high intensity and this certainly is! I can't wait to complete my week on this but will continue doing it when I'm in need of a great workout in the comfort of my own home. :)",1396569600,,596,4.333333333333333

6141637,5,B00H8N5IQS,"This is a great DVD to add to a home workout collection!  The moves are fun and varied, the time flies by, and you are left in a puddle of sweat!  Definitely not for beginners but she shows modifications if you need to dial it down a little.  I have done many exercise DVDs and this one is different than others in two major ways.  First, Jillian recommends that you do the strength in the morning and the cardio at night.  All other advice I have ever heard/read from trainers and fitness magazines etc recommends the other way around, but leave it to Jillian to buck the conventional wisdom!  Also, if you follow her one-week plan, in which you do both workouts every day, then you are doing the same strength training exercises every day for seven days in a row, which most trainers and videos do not recommend.  For example, in Jillian's Body Revolution, you do weights every day, but you alternate muscles - working the front of the body one day, working the back of the body the next day.  But here we are doing the same exercises every day.  I think that's why she has us using such light weights (3 lbs) in this video - if you are going to do the strength every day, I think you need to go light or your muscles won't have time to recover between sessions and you might injure yourself.  One final tip:  if you don't want to shower twice in one day, you can do the two workouts back-to-back.  You can save a few minutes by doing it that way - start with the cardio workout but then stop and skip the cool down, then start the strength workout but skip the warm up because you're already warm from the cardio, do the whole strength workout, and then do the stretch/cool down at the end of strength. i did it that way and I felt just great after - and it saves a few minutes and brings the whole thing closer to an hour (its about 38 min for strength, 34 for cardio but by cutting out the cardio cool down and the strength warm up, you cut out about 10 minutes).  Fun!!  Keep 'em coming, Jillian!!",1396483200,23,2003,4.25065963060686
6141638,5,B00H8N5IQS,"If you want a challenge or quick results, this is the way to go. The cardio is the hardest, no-break cardio I have ever done. I have never sweated like that. My new goal is to be able to do it without stopping. On the bright side, it makes all of Jillian's other DVD's seem very doable. I have noticed a difference in my arms and around my waist.

6141639,4,B00H8N5IQS,I feel fantastic after doing this. Especially the cardio. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is one of the girls in the video Natalie seems half asleep and is not very motivating.

I am a Jillian addict and own all of her videos (except for 'shred it with weights') and this is definitely different than any she has done before. It's two 30 min (both actually run about 35-40 min counting warm up + cool down) workouts and she recommends doing the STRENGTH division in the AM and the CARDIO in the PM. This being said, it's a crash workout/meal plan. I was very challenged and It was painful but fun! I am only doing one of the two per day and I rotate, doing strength one day and cardio the next. I will be doing this for about a month, to prepare myself to fit better into a dress. I have gone from a size 22 in pants to a size 10 at (5'9 tall) in three years, eating healthy and doing Jillian's videos. They WORK.

I personally don't want to take two showers or am I preparing for an event to be ready for in one week so just doing one of these workouts a day is plenty for me.  I like doing the strength workout one day and the cardio workout the next and keep rotating them like that or doing her other dvd's along with it.  Both are great workouts on their own and would be very tough to do back to back.  These workouts are not for the beginner - they are definitely for intermediate to advanced people.

This workout is really hard and still under 30minutes. There's 2 workouts meant for you to use them twice a day. Once in the morning and once at night. When I say the workout is hard, here's an example. Single hand burpees!!!  ARGH. Loved it though.",1395360000,6,422,4.197530864197531
6141645,4,B00H8N5IQS,"My biggest issue with this, of course, is the concept of anyone trying to 'get into amazing shape for an event' in 1 week. Unless they're already in pretty awesome shape, nobody is gonna get 'incredibly shredded' in 1 week. Kind of surprised to see her marketing something this way since she's the first to say they are no magic pills, no QUICK FIXES.

The set is...just weird - very dark, broadway stage-ish look, w/4 stands @ the back of the stage that each have 9 super-bright bulbs on them. It's hard to see Jill & the other 2 ppl sometimes during the strength workout because they're wearing dark colors.

Having said all that, these 2 workouts are pretty challenging! They're a good addition to my ever-growing workout DVD collection, many of which are Jillian's stuff. There are some new exercises & some old ones combined in new ones. If you don't allow yourself to distracted by the odd set choice, you'll find they're good workouts.",1395187200,5,942,4.668674698795181
6141646,4,B00H8N5IQS,"I ordered this DVD for just some fresh blood in my DVD rotation. I have many of Jillian's, Amy Dixon, T25 and others.
I did the cardio yesterday and enjoyed it, kept my heart rate up and it had some newer moves. I didn't burn any more than I would have with the others but just doing something a little different challenges the body in another way. Sometimes that is all you need to bread a plateau.
I have to give the strength some more time, but on first try, didn't enjoy it as much. Some of the moves are classic, some are tough, but more to ""be tough"" in my eyes, not so much to give that muscle group a better workout. I find more straight forward moves, compound moves work well for me and I like to lift more, but safely. I remember in her Body Revolution series, I felt she tried these crazy moves to give variety which is understandable after dozens of dvd's but it doesn't always mean a better workout.

I will definitely do the cardio for a quick workout but will probably enjoy using my more athletic type strength dvd's in the future.",1395100800,12,1048,4.266331658291457
6141647,4,B00H8N5IQS,"""If you want to fight for your limitations, you get to KEEP them!""  This is not The 30-Day Shred.  This is the One Week Shred.  The program is completely different.  The time it takes is completely different and there are tons of new more intense/targeted moves from Jillian's previous dvds.  This dvd is unique, and it is what it says it is.

I did the full 7 days (plus a bonus day of the strength workout since I simply couldn't fit the cardio portion in the day I received this dvd in the mail).  I definitely saw a difference in myself at the end of the week.  I could see differences after the first couple of days.  I'm in shape (thanks to Jillian).  When I'm spending my time to workout I work out as hard and as heavy as I can.  My thighs were slimmer, my waist was smaller, and my muscle tone was more defined after the first couple of days.  After the full 7 days I see that these changes are sticking which is awesome because I had kind of plateaued as far as weight loss and working my various muscle groups.  If you are looking to change and see noticeable improvements in your body (regardless of what kind of shape your body is in now) in 1 week.. Buy This.  It does exactly what Jillian designed it to do.  If you love Jillian Michaels' workouts.. Buy This.  (It's $13.  How many other things do we waste $13 dollars on?  You can get a great workout that lasts forever and not just throw away your money on piddle-y purchases.)

I have worked out with Jillian for almost 5 years now (beginning after our second child was born... we have three now).  Because of Jillian and the results I got I am very dedicated.  I started with The 30-Day Shred.  If you are new to working out, don't have a lot of time to devote (who does!), or need to lose a lot of weight you should start there.  I own all of Jillian's dvd's, and they are all fantastic!  As the person working out you just have to decide what you want.  What do you enjoy doing?  What do you HATE doing?  How much time do you have?  Jillian gives you everything you could want in her dvd's and tons of variety.  (I do wish she would come out with a more advanced kettlebell dvd as well as a second kickboxing dvd.)

With three kids I don't have a lot of time to workout, so I use Jillian's dvds as a library of resources.  I have done all of them as time or need-for-change permits many, many times.  There are some that I enjoy more than others.  There are some that I think are more effective than others.  (I suppose one day I will make a list of those..)  Since my time is very limited I use her 30-Day Shred video as my template.  (I absolutely love the 25-minute workout time.  In and out!)  I incorporate moves from her other workouts to replace the moves that I find too easy in the 30-Day Shred, and voila! I have a kick-butt, extremely-effective workout in less than 30 minutes!  I purchase every single one of her dvds not because I constantly have the time to do them (the longer ones) but because I love to take her more hardcore effective moves out of the dvd and incorporate them into my amended 30-Day Shred sessions!

First, I loved Jillian in this workout.  This was the most passionate, directed, focused, and the most ""Jillian"" I've seen her since her earlier videos.  She's not there to be cool or ""hardcore"".  She's there because she loves what she does, and she honestly wants to help people with/get through her workouts.  This workout is fast and motivated.

Second, I love the way both workouts ZOOM by.  Wow.  Seriously.  I was shocked each time I reached the last circuit in both workouts because it seemed I got there very quickly.  I always did both workouts back to back because I can't take two time zones out of my day to workout, but everything still went by very quickly.

Third, I was very excited to see all of the new moves.  They will definitely be incorporated into my self-made 30-Day Shred sessions.

Fourth, I think the idea of using 3-pound weights throughout this workout is only realistic if you are brand new to working out, and you just want to get crazy by adding weight.  If you are in shape or rather-in-shape you need to adjust the weight to your ability to do the move.  I  use 10-pounders for the first two moves as well as for a few other moves throughout the workout.  I use 8's for the majority of the moves, and I use 5's on the fly's.  There is no way you could get a really great workout out of this dvd if you are already in shape unless you push harder.  Push harder on the weight..on how high you lift your legs or your pelvis..on how deep you sit..on how fast you go, etc.  I am constantly changing weight throughout this workout.

Fifth, this is a great workout.  If you are willing to work out for 7 days with the plan that Jillian provides (I did not follow the meal plan), you will see results as long as you don't gorge yourself on crazy food and eat yourself out of the workout.

My husband is a very happy man.  I am happy with myself although I constantly try to improve.  I wouldn't be here without Jillian Michaels.  Thank you, Jillian.",1394928000,388,5081,4.29778247096093
6141648,4,B00H8N5IQS,"I own many DVDs by Jillian Michaels.  If you like her workouts, don't hesitate to buy this one.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I bought the ""Instant Video"" version and it didn't come with the meal plan.  I'm guessing that is included in the box of the DVD version.",1394928000,,281,4.166666666666667
6141649,5,B00H8N5IQS,"I own all of Jillian's DVDs - my favorites being ""30 Day Shred"", ""Ripped in 30"", ""Killer Abs"", ""Kickbox Fastfix (workouts 1 & 3)"", and workouts 11 & 12 and cardio phase 3 from ""Body Revolution"".  Now I will be adding this DVD to my list of favorites.  Getting two totally different workouts in one DVD is great, and both being 30 minutes in length is perfect for me.  I really like ""Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism"" and ""No More Trouble Zones"", but I can't always devote 45-50 minutes to working out in the morning.

Both the strength workout and the cardio workout are fast-paced, and the thirty minutes goes by quickly.  Also, Jillian is in SICK shape - I don't think her body has ever looked better.  I highly recommend this DVD!",1394928000,7,729,4.484848484848484
6141650,5,B00H8N5IQS,"Jillian is not messing around when she says ONE WEEK SHRED.

This DVD has two workouts on it, she has a strength training and muscle building one for the AM that is about 30 minutes and then she has a cardio workout for the PM that is another 30 minutes, and I did find this workout challenging.

I have done the P90X, Insanity, and other beach body workouts and this is Jillian's most challenging yet. The cardio portion started off a little slower so I was worried it wasn't going to feel like a workout and then BAM it just picked up, she doesn't give you any breaks like she does in some of her other workouts, so I would reccomend this one if you are looking for a good workout.",1394841600,6,683,4.206106870229007
6141651,5,B00H8N5IQS,"When it comes to DVDs and workouts, there is a lot of personal preference. I am a certified fitness instructor and I prefer high-rep interval workouts like Jari Love and Angie Gorr. I just feel the burn more with high-reps. However, I realize that it is good to mix it up. Each instructor has their own style, and Jillian is great at what she does. I don't agree with the marketing of losing 7 lbs in 7 days, as I don't feel it is safe to lose more than 2lbs per week, but it is really marketed as a crash one-week shred. I actually think it is a great workout.  I like to do the DVD all at once because I don't have time to work on in both the morning and the evening, but from the research I've studied, the old research thought that cardio was better in the morning and weights at night, but the research is now showing that if you are going to do a split, weights are better in the morning and cardio at night, and that our cardio abilities peak between 5 and 7 PM.  If I am going to mix it up, it is easier for me to do weights in the morning because I don't have enough energy to be bouncing around that early in the morning. However, I typically only have time to do it all at once, so you can actually use the DVD in multiple ways. You can do 1 hour cardio followed by weights, or do weights followed by cardio or split it up. I  REALLY loved the cardio portion, so for cardio days this will be a great 30 min workout to do.

I would say this DVD is a blend between her Burn Fat Boost Metabolism and Hard-Body The weight portion combines weights and body resistance. I personally don't like body resistant moves, but I know they are good for me, so I do them. I am very advanced and had to use 8lb weights, but could probably even go higher next time. I really prefer high-reps for weights as opposed to switching it up every 30 seconds, but this is just Jillian's style and it is good to mix it up. The weight portion did have some unique moves, and you can always modify. I did prefer the cardio to the weight section. I like Jackie Warners time saver training 30 min weight section where you do each exercises for 1 min, so I would prefer the weights to be done a little longer; however, the weight section was good and there were some unique moves that work different muscles. Each weight circuit has about 6 -8 exercises each done for 30 seconds and then you do it again and move on to the next circuit.

The Cardio section was great and I love this athletic style of cardio. I agree with others that the cardio moves aren't unique, but they don't have to be, it is all about the flow of the moves, getting your heart rate up and getting results, and these athletic style moves are great, and you only do them for 30 seconds, so time flies by!

I like Jillian in this video. I think she talks just the right amount, motivates and encourages you. She also does a good job explaining the form and encourages modifications if you need it. Some of the moves are hard, so modification is easy. There is one move where you twist and kick your leg out and this can be hard for anyone with back pain. I just did jumping jacks during this portion and I kept my heart rate up.

It is a more advanced workout (the cardio is similar to insanity, but maybe not as intense, but it can be depending on how hard you work). However, for beginners you can always march it out if it gets too tough.

Some people mentioned the lights and the studio, and I agree but it really didn't bother me. Is this a good workout, YES! Will this burn a ton of calories, YES! Does Jillian motivate you, YES! Are there modifications, YES! Does she explain good form, YES!

Therefore, the workout is good. Someone also mentioned they prefer 30 day shred to get a total body workout all at once. I like the 3-2-1 format of 30 day shred (and ripped in 30 which is a little harder). However, this DVD is just a different program, and it is great to switch it up. I've done over 200 DVDs and I would say this is one of my favorite of Jillians. Here is a list of my favorites: 30 day shred, ripped in 30, Burn Fat Boost metabolism and the One week Shred.

Also, I really liked her hair color in this videowhoever did her hair did a really good job!",1394841600,159,4220,4.15422276621787
6141652,5,B00H8N5IQS,"This workout is really well rounded, tough, & true to its title.  I've seen changes in my abs, arms & legs in just 5 days.  Highly recommend!",1394755200,2,141,4.185185185185185
6141653,5,B00H8N5IQS,Another great workout video from Jillian. Hard enough but not too much of a killer. At 55 I don't need to overdo it every time I work out. Nice to have strength and cardio on one DVD.,1394582400,,183,3.972972972972973
6141654,5,B00H8N5IQS,"I love the split for morning and evening.  Definitely pushes my limits!

6141655,4,B00H8N5IQS,"I'm a seasoned Jillian fanatic, so I was excited to try this one. I did the strength/cardio workouts back to back. I was definitely tired and satisfied when I was finished. I don't like splitting up my workouts because I hate having to wash my hair twice a day, haha. If you're really serious about doing the seven week shred as a week-long thing, it's probably a good idea to split up the strength and cardio portions to make it less crazy. That's the idea.

We've seen a lot of the moves before, but who cares? They work. She still mixed it up with some new ones and the succession of moves is different from her other DVDs so it didn't bother me at all.

The strength workout was good, not the most challenging one ever but I modified with tens when it wasn't hard enough.

The cardio portion was definitely more intense than the strength workout. When she finished with twisting knee crunches like she did in Blast Fat Boost Metabolism, I seriously wanted to die, but in a good way.

Overall? Really liked it. Modifying is key.",1394582400,9,1031,4.439153439153439
6141656,4,B00H8N5IQS,"I just finished the one week shred and boy was it intense! The strength training wasn't too bad, it was the cardio that really got to me. Overall it was a great program, she has a few new moves and the bear exercises seemed to be the hardest. I felt good waking up an hour earlier to get my AM workout done, and I could definitely feel my body shredding by the PM workout. Unfortunately I didn't lose any weight, I was hoping to lose at least 3 pounds. But the scale didn't budge although I ate super clean the entire time. I do feel like I lost an inch or two so that's always a bonus, my shoulders look a lot more sculpted as well.",1394496000,4,633,4.031746031746032
6141657,3,B00H8N5IQS,"To be honest,the first segment which was strength made me realize why I had stopped buying her dvds-a bunch of moves were just too crazy for me and I'm an advanced excerciser. She recommended using 3 pound weights and evn though I used 8 pounds,I just didn't feel enough of a burn. I guess I've been spoiled with Kelly Coffey's 30 minute strength workouts,which are the best. I did enjoy the cardio segment,so I think next time I will mix that segment with a 30 minute Kelly workout. This dvd does not compare to the new Biggest Loser 6 week Cardio Crusher dvd which is phenomenal-it's the best BL dvd ever!!I think Jillian is trying to outdo herself and come up with innovative new moves,which unfortunately are too wild for the average person",1394409600,25,744,4.601503759398496
6141658,5,B00H8N5IQS,"I love love love this DVD!  For the longest time I've wished Jillian would come out with a 30-minute pure strength and a 30-minute pure cardio workout (Banish Fat Boost Metabolism and No More Trouble Zones are great but they are almost an hour long each).  Getting both types of workouts on one DVD is more than I hoped for!  These workouts are tough and I haven't seen a lot of the exercises before (one-armed burpees, the bear side-twist, plank and side plank punches, clap jacks, etc.) which made it more enjoyable.  Both workouts are challenging and very well choreographed.  Jillian looks great and it was nice to see Kenta from Body Revolution again.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1394323200,12,686,4.722689075630252
6141659,4,B00H8N5IQS,"I LOVE JILLIAN MICHAEL'S WORKOUTS and own every one and adore her as a personality.
BUT, WHO CAME UP WITH THE IDEA TO PUT THESE MASSIVE LIGHT FIXTURES IN THE CAMERA FRAME? I just finished the AM workout and it is a great workout, challenging, beautifully designed (as always), and Jillian never stops inspiring me to reach for more. But my eyes feel like I flashes have been going off at a camera shoot; I see big bright circles when I look around the room now. When she leans down to the camera her face gets lit by lights underneath which is unflattering and dramatically inappropriate for this kind of video. I say, great awesome workout in all ways but for the lighting person who thought up this shoot setup, not at all thoughtful about the viewers that are staring at the light fixtures for a straight half-hour. I will keep using it but will have to attach a second monitor and scoot the DVD player up so cut off the top of the frame where the lights are blasting from. Please avoid this going forward...
