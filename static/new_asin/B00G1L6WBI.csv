8620060,1,B00G1L6WBI,"Interviews with straight gang members mostly being extremely homophobic, & a few gay people. Marvin Gaye's 'Save the Children' is played a lot - I wonder if they got permission to use it; probably not. Lots of talk about gay youngsters being forced into prostitution - yet the obvious reason, which is them being kicked out by their homophobic parents, is never mentioned, just nebulous pious bleatings about being gay not being what God wants. I think the gay participants were conned into thinking this would be a sympathetic film. It isn't. And there's a lot of showing of photos of black youths in hardcore gay sex, one can only assume to titillate the supposedly outraged. Homosexuality is repeatedly & deliberately muddled in with child-molesting. It's also full of misstatements about HIV infection rates, life-expectancy, transmission etc. Just awful.",1418947200,,859,5.18705035971223
