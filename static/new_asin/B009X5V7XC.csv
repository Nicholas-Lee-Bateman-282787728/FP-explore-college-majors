8544835,4,B009X5V7XC,"In a world where American studios try to pander to their audiences with dumbed down English-language remakes of cutting edge shows made in non-English speaking countries, prepare for the latest entrant from the newest contender to be the TV export  global capitol: Sweden.  If you didn't find the English-language version of ""The Killing"" lethal enough for you, or ""Ugly Betty"" wasn't ugly enough for you, or ""Homeland"" didn't sound homey enough without Clair Danes having a nervous breakdown in Hebrew, then now is the time - before the inevitable cable TV broadcast debut of the remake in English - to catch the original version of this thriller of a social satire guaranteed to have you on the edge of your seat, mostly so you can read the subtitles:  enter the world of ""Real Humans""!!!

""At your service, Mr. Underhill...""

Journey to a futuristic Sweden, where man's science has perfected the technology of ""hubots"" - virtual simulacra of human beings - but people still use flip phones, laptops, the internet and cars that are destroying the environment.  It's basically present-day Sweden, only now with androids.  Hubots are consumer goods and the multilayered script shows the varied ways in which their owners lose their own humanity exploiting their replicants, parodying how human beings have already been befuddled, diminished and defeated by their cars, PC's, the internet and their smartphones.  Because hubots aren't human, real human beings take license in how they treat them - with hubot's being groped at the office, beaten to a pulp in factories, jacked by hubot chop-shops, put to work like prostitutes, gang raped or just shut down by when their owners don't want to deal with them.  In other words, there aren't that many really humane people in ""Real Humans"".

""they evolved, they rebelled, and they've got a plan.""

""Real Humans"" begins with a group of hubots wandering across the country side, apparently autonomous and on a mission.  These hubots dream of a world where they can live freely, but their means for achieving that aim are far from clear.  There's a home invasion of a remote farm house, and people (real ones) end up dead.  The group fragments, and one of their number is lost to hubot scavengers.  As the remaining hubots struggle to remain undetected, they learn to adapt, coming to greater terms with helpful or suspicious humans.  Meanwhile, we learn that a counter-movement - ""kta mnniskor"" - opposed to hubots.  These anti-Hubot Taliban are repelled by the Hubot owners' willingness to replace genuine humans with Hubots for any number of roles, whether commercial or emotional.

We meet Roger, a factory worker made obsolete both at work and home by hubots.  Roger's anger will destroy both his job and his family, and ironically drive him into the arms of what he hates most.  His neighbors, the Engmans, will finally receive their first hubot, a beautiful android they name Anita, oblivious to her origins as one of the autonomous Hubots seen at the beginning of the show.  Inger Engman is a savvy lawyer whose job will see her drawn into the hubot conspiracy, representing hubot owners, then the hubots themselves.  Lennart, Inger's father, must give up Odi - his beloved son-he-never-had hubot - for the matronly and controlling Vera.  Therese, Roger's wife, leaves him when he melts down over her hubot.  Without her husband, Therese bonds with her hubot, but even that love has its limits.  There's Leo,  a human, hubot-hybrid (try saying that 5 times fast in Swedish) searching for Anita.  Then there's Bea, the show's Blade Runner, a hotshot cop assigned to a unit specifically tasked to hunt down rogue hubots.

""So, how do we know who's human? If I was an imitation, a perfect imitation, how would you know if it was really me?""

""Real Humans"" doesn't rely on expository dialog to tell you what's going on, or kick things off with a ""Blade Runner"" style pre-credits crawl, so going in it's difficult to know what kind of show you're signing up for.  Is this a thriller?  Will we see an epic ""Planet of the Apes"" scene of laser-gun toting hubots on robot horses?  Is the show going to boil down to a series of episodes showing how human beings are degenerating because of their reliance and exploitation of these machines?  ""Real Humans"" excels when it shows itself capable of being any of these, with enough plot to let you know it's going somewhere.  Like shows on American cable, you'll have to go through a fair amount of filler before the action starts to pick up.

""Replicants are like any other machine - they're either a benefit or a hazard""

WHY REAL HUMANS DISAPPOINTS: No show is perfect.  For ""Real Humans"", the flaws become obvious near the end of the 1st season.  It's when the action heats up that ""Real Humans"" starts to break down.  The writers know that they couldn't keep the show going on with jokes aimed at people drought down by their gadgets.  They need a story and have to fall back on the conspiracy of autonomous humans and a covert operation by the government to prevent that from happening.  Various agendas on both sides become apparent on both sides of the human-hubot divide.  Unfortunately, revealing how far apart certain allies are makes you realize how underdeveloped the characters are - as if the writers needed natural allies to conflict with each other in order to stretch the plot.

Does that make ""Real Humans"" a failure?  Hardly.  This is a meaty show (real meat!!!), and there's more than enough to commit you for season 2.  If anything, ask yourself when you might next have an excuse to watch Swedish TV?  Probably in 75 years.  By then you'll be dead...or a hubot.",1423526400,10,5669,4.850156087408949

8544837,5,B009X5V7XC,"After the second episode I was completely absorbed in this society where a good part of your colleague's, friends, caretakers have been replaced by human robots (hu-bots). It's easy to imagine a hubot taking care of your grandmother, baby, dog etc. for real. Even if you look around at work and find half your colleague's replaced. The examples showed make you feel that it's true already, genius. You're also made to feel like you discriminate againts hubots if you are rude to them, treat them als pets or slaves. Also brilliantly done.",1383955200,13,538,4.858695652173913
