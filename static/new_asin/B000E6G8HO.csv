2502528,5,B000E6G8HO,"This is a useful overview of Zen practise in Japan. It reviews Soto and Rinzai temples across Japan, offering footage from both. There are quite a few interviews with different Abbotts or senior monks, giving a flavour of each temple's approach. It was inspiring to see the roots of the tradition I practise and to get a sense of the bigger picture in that respect. Lay training was also acknowledged, which was helpful.",1199750400,4,420,4.767123287671233
2502529,5,B000E6G8HO,"Absolutely amazing and wondefully shot after watching it I was truthfully extremely relaxed and ready to atke on more stress from my every day life. I can not recommend this film enough.  It showcases the most beautiful temples in Kyoto and brought back many fond memories.  Brailey did a first class job and I take my hat of to him.

2502530,2,B000E6G8HO,"so this isn't a zen guy making the film, it's a martial arts guy making the film...he doesn't really know anything about zen practice. when people that don't practice talk about zen they really try to make it dramatic and magical...and they miss the subtlety of it. it's cool that he went to all the places that he did, and it's cool to see nishijama roshi in action. but the filmmaker is handing us the same misinformed stuff we've been getting from popular media for about 50 years now.

for some reason he goes to a swordman and interviews him and the guy is like ""i don't really know anything about zen, i'm a sword guy."" and the narrator is like ""how humble he is!"" but i think the guy was being serious, he's a sword guy, not a zen guy, why was he being interviewed?

and later when they go to soji-ji he interviews the godo roshi and the godo is trying to dispel all this nonsense about cessation of thought and the godo is like ""you can't stop thinking, that's not the point"" and right in the same scene the narrator is like ""and the monks, in zazen, bar thoughts from entering the mind"" WHAT!? weren't you listening?! the godo roshi just said that they are NOT doing that!

zen is boring and people aren't willing to accept that so they try to make it into a drama. i think the german movie ""enlightenment guaranteed"" provides a much more realistic look into japanese zen monastic life because the filmmaker doris dorrie actually knows what zen practice is. or better yet if you really want to feel what it's like to be a zen monk get yourself 5 hours of sleep, hit your knees with a hammer in the morning and go pull some weeds for 6 hours somewhere. there's your ""quest for the truth""",1187568000,95,1695,4.3575949367088604

2502533,4,B000E6G8HO,"Always searching for greater insight into the secrets of Zen, i bought this DVD hoping for some clarification.  It did not give me any.  This is more of a documentary style film more than a film about giving you the true secrets of Zen.  So from a documentary standpoint, it will give the novice a good idea of what Zen is.  But if you know a lot of this practice and want greater insight, you won't get it here.",1168300800,23,412,4.177215189873418
2502554,2,B000E6G8HO,Wish I'd read the reviews before agreeing to view this minimally informative & superficial film.  The rhythm of shots and interviews was more like a travelogue than a deep look into Zen.,1425600000,,186,4.8125

2502561,5,B000E6G8HO,"I don't know why some people said it was inaccurate. It's pretty accurate in my experience. I've never been to Japan, but one thing this movie doesn't tell you is that there ARE Zen places to practice in the U.S. that are not that different from the movie. (Both city and more monastic style ones). Most/many major cities in the U.S. have ""Zen Centers""- especially in California. They also have a good number in New York state, tons in New York city, and at least one if not more in most major cities. They are not all of the same quality but there are many good ones. I live in Florida (a place where you would think to find mostly Christians) and just about every major city and some suburbs down here have a Zen Center.

So, yeah, in my experience this movie is pretty accurate. And it's an excellent movie for one that covers a topic like Zen Buddhism, which is probably best experienced anyway. You'll never have an inkling of what Zen is really truly about unless you practice and experience it for yourself. That's because a person can hear one sentence and understand it in many different ways. Plus, it's like trying to describe the color blue to a blind person. Words don't really cut it, it's got to be experienced. And I'm not even talking about satori here, I don't know what that is yet. I'm just talking about the super basic beginning parts of practice.

So anyway I give this movie a thumbs up. Five stars. Well done.",1395532800,,1434,4.448669201520913
2502562,5,B000E6G8HO,I loved the film. I don't think that it was ever intended as a complete course teaching Zen (in an hour?). This film shows so many wonderful places and introduces the major concepts so that a curious viewer will have plenty of places to start looking to find out more about Zen. Wonderful! Lovely! A beautiful film.,1383091200,,315,4.543859649122807

shakuhachi soundtrack. It is lovely
to see places that I have only heard about,
as well as places that I've been to.
However, I agree with other reviewers that
the narrative is grossly misinformed and the
narrator is not well-rehearsed in Japanese
terms. This lack of attention seems counter
to the content of the film. 3 stars reflects
my response to the visual and the soundtrack,
but not the poor quality of the research, which
only furthers decades of misinformation about Zen.",1381104000,,515,4.797752808988764

2502590,5,B000E6G8HO,"I very much liked this film because it shows how Zen is practiced in Japan from the traditional temple setting of Soji-ji, to the maze of office towers in downtown Tokyo.  Zen can fit any and every setting and situation -- it's endlessly adaptable to real life.

Several abbots and monks are interviewed from both Rinzai and Soto Zen, but their messages contain the same teachings on how to live one's life right now.",1324598400,,417,4.621621621621622
2502591,5,B000E6G8HO,I enjoyed this film. My family was bored. Zen in America can look quite different from what is shown here. The portrait of disciplined practice and the warmth of the masters together is quite good. Gentile people waith very yang disipline. Interesting how these two aspects come together.,1218499200,2,288,5.020833333333333
2502592,2,B000E6G8HO,"Filmmaker Jon Braeley did a couple of things right with this one-hour documentary on Japanese Zen Buddhism.  He hired a skilled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/shakuhachi-player/dp/B0010V5F4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">shakuhachi player</a>&nbsp;for his soundtrack and as cameraman was able to take advantage of some wonderfully photogenic locations, including Sojiji, one of Soto Zen's main monastic training centers.

It's too bad he didn't get a decent scriptwriter or a narrator able to pronounce Japanese.

If you know absolutely nothing about zen, you might learn something from this film, though you're just as likely to get the wrong idea.  The film begins with titles superimposed over monks doing zazen:  ""Zen.  From the Sanskrit word, Dhyana.  From the Chinese word, Chan.""  In fact it's the other way round.  Zen is the Japanese word for Chan.  You might also get the idea that zen has a lot to do with home and garden design.  You surely won't come away understanding how zen is different from other forms of Buddhism.  In fact you might not even suspect it has anything at all to do with Buddhism.

There's a lot of blather about one pointed concentration, freeing the mind, non-attachment, emptiness, becoming one with nature, living in the moment.  But these ideas are tossed into the pot without rhyme or reason, like someone making a stew with whatever they picked up out of the refrigerator.

There is a short section on the technical details of doing zen (how to fold your legs, how to hold your hands, how to breathe), as well as demonstrations of formal, monastic style zen.  But I really doubt anyone new to zen would be able to do much on their own with the material presented here.

The best parts of the films are interviews with zen roshis from both the Rinzai and Soto traditions. Unlike the narrated script, which is full of the platitudes you might find in an episode of Kung Fu, these gentlemen are quite practical and down-to-earth.  The Godo Roshi at Sojiji (whose name is mistransliterated as Dai Tow) explains that satori, or enlightenment, is not a special power or state of being.  It is simply becoming yourself.  There is, he explains (contrary to the narration), no such thing as a mind without thought, that as long is there is mind there is thought, there are sense impressions.  This is the nature of mind.  The important thing, he stresses, is to accept what is, without fear and without favor.

Unfortunately, the interviews with the monks and roshis account for less than one quarter of this film's 60 minutes.  Anyone seriously interested in zen would do well to skip this film and instead find a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/good-book/dp/0385260938/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">good book</a>, or visit a nearby temple or zen center.

(Note that most of the 5-star reviews are from people with only one or two other reviews, most often other products from people who worked on this film.  Looks like promotion from friends and relatives.)
