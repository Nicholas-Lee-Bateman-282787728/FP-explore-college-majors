8254661,5,B00147PCZQ,As Sabbath Keepers we rest on the Sabbath Day.  Sometimes we watch related material.  This has been a wonderful contribution to our Sabbath rest day.  The children can follow it because it is done in a story form.  3 Thumbs up for Reader's Digest.  I feel as if I have learned things thru this collection that reading alone didn't seem to imprint in my head or my heart.  I think this will be a blessing to any family seeking to spend more quality time with family members and/or to learn more about the truths that rule this universe.,1297382400,,535,4.408163265306122
8254662,5,B00147PCZQ,"I put Life After Jesus on my wish list after viewing a library video.  I was impressed with this Reader's Digest production.  I don't particularly like Hollywood's version of Bible stories as the director and/or writers tend to put their own impressions into the story, or feel they have to ""explain"" what the character is thinking, believing or doing because most probably the majority of viewers haven't a clue what Scripture really says or the historical background of New Testament times.  Reader's Digest has taken the NIV's translation of the Book of Acts and reproduced it accurately word for word.  As far as I am concerned the fact that additional dialog wasn't added to ""clarify"" the action is a miracle in itself.  I believe that using this three video set either for individual or class study would help add dimension to reading or teaching about what happened to the apostles and Paul in the years following Jesus's ascension to His Father.

There are several name actors appearing in the video.  Henry O. Arnold who plays Paul gives an outstanding performance, starting with a silent almost invisible appearance at the beginning.  I had to watch the first video three times before I realized that Paul was a visible presence in the Sanhedrin before the mention of his attendance at Stephen's stoning.

The most heart stirring moment for me was when Paul was in Lystra and he saw a crippled man trying to get to him.  You see the man through a sea of legs. When Paul commands him to stand up and walk, the man's amazement as feeling returns to his crippled legs brings tears to my eyes each time I watch.

Whether or not you are are actively reading and studying Scripture, this video, accurately produced, is worth adding to your collection.",1267747200,,1755,4.7781456953642385
