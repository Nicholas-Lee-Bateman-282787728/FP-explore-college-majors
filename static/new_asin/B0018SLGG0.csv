3420815,5,B0018SLGG0,Package arrived within approximately 10 days. Well packaged and no damage whatsoever. Individual season sleeves all in new condition and individually plastic wrapped. All DVDs inside that I have watched so far (through season 3 and started on season 4) have played flawlessly. Good product at a very good price! I recommend it!,1222819200,,327,5.188679245283019
3420816,5,B0018SLGG0,"What more can I say, it is a incredible series born of men with imaginations that will take us into the future. I only wish that the powers that be would see fit to take the series past Season 5 and follow in the steps of Stargate SG1 which ran for 10 seasons.",1222560000,,260,3.9245283018867925
3420817,5,B0018SLGG0,I'm a hugh fan of Stargate SG-1 so coming into the Stargate Atlantis series I wasn't sure about the new actors. At first... they just arn't the Stargate Team but after several episodes the series begins to grow on you. The new threats are great but the series does have it's low points. On a scale of 1 to 10 1 being low I'd have to give Atlantis a 7. I will continue to watch because I just love Sci-Fi. And the series completes my Stargate collection.,1221177600,,453,4.218390804597701
3420818,5,B0018SLGG0,I was very pleased with my puchase of the Stargate Atlantis DVD's.  I got 4 seasons in a thin pack.  My order came quickly and in excellant shape as described.,1218585600,8,159,4.266666666666667
3420819,5,B0018SLGG0,"Our family enjoys the Stargate series, but SG Atlantis is our favorite.  The characters are great, the plots are good and we really like the show.  We bought seasons 1-4 and on rainy days when we can't go outside, we pile up and watch this series. Amazon had the best price that I found and the service was great.",1218326400,5,313,4.288135593220339
3420820,5,B0018SLGG0,"I like this show (although I think that SG-1 was better).
The disks are of the good programs and also good addendum, came with a good price.
I enjoy my buying.",1217548800,,159,4.161290322580645
3420821,5,B0018SLGG0,"I know Amazon wants the reviews to be specific, but it's Altantis.  It has Joe Flanigan and David Hewlett as lead characters.  What else needs to be said?  The speical effects continue to improve with each season.  The effects in season four are awe inspiring, especially in Sins.  The music by Joel Goldsmith is a perfect mood creator, without being overwhelming, in every episode.  The writers and actors have created characters that viewers can believe and really care about.  The characters have an excellent dynamic that keeps you guessing about their connections to one another.  The writers incorporate love, humor, hate, despair, and a host of other emotions into every season.  The bad guys are chilling and have depth. At the heart of the show is the best character of all: the city itself.  If you have never watched Atlantis, I am jealous that you get to experience it for the first time.  You are in for a treat.",1217462400,2,925,4.754716981132075
3420822,4,B0018SLGG0,"One of the big arcs of the ""Stargate SG-1"" series was finding the Lost City of the Ancients, also known as Atlantis.

It also turned into fertile fodder for a spinoff series (come on, you KNEW they had to make one eventually). And though it had a slightly shaky start -- much like its parent series -- the first four seasons of ""Stargate: Atlantis"" blossom out into a solid sci-fi series with a legendary series, new alien parasites, and new nasty machines from long ago.

At the Antarctic base, Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) has finally figured out the location of Atlantis -- in the Pegasus galaxy. General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) gives the go-ahead for an exploratory unit to go to Atlantis -- even though they don't have the power to return back to the Milky Way, and will be stranded there.

So Dr. Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson) leads an international group of scientists and military to another galaxy, and arrive in the sunken Ancient city of Atlantis. After some initial problems, the ancient city is secured and has risen above the water -- but unfortunately the military unit, including Major John Sheppard (Joe Flanigan), have run afoul of the parasitic, life-sucking alien Wraith, who destroyed the Pegasus Ancients long ago.

And the Pegasus galaxy has plenty of its own dangers -- nanoviruses, spies, life-sucking bugs, cannibal Wraith, enzyme addicts, whales, an egomaniac baker, weird Ancient devices, Wraiths transformed into humans, fear machines, a race of hybrid bug monsters, crystalline nightmare aliens, and a race of ruthless soldiers pretending to be Amish-like farmers.

The Atlantis base regains contact with Earth, but this may not be enough to save them from the Wraith's attempts to gain control of Atlantis -- and the only Stargate with Earth's coordinates. To make matters worse, they encounter a planet of what seems to be Ancients, only to find that they are in fact a mechanical experiment gone horribly wrong. And they really, really hate humans -- and an attack of theirs leads to Weir being horribly injured.

At the same time, Atlantis receives a new commander -- Colonel Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping), formerly of SG-1. And it's not much easier than SG-1 was -- there are predictions of the future, a shocking pregnancy, an amnesia disease, and the sudden vanishing of Teyla's people from their world. And things take an even stranger turn when Sheppard finds that Atlantis has been abandoned...

""Stargate: Atlantis"" has an easier introduction than most series, even spinoffs. The whole idea was introduced over a few seasons of ""Stargate SG-1,"" some of the characters (Weir, Woolsey and McKay) were also recurring characters, and Tapping was a regular. And while the first season is a bit bland (""The romancing of the alien priestess? It's very 1967 of you"") the storyline hits its stride in the second season.

And it has plenty of sci-fi staples -- ugly nasty aliens, tightly wound scientists, little tubular ships, explosions, moral quandaries and a bit of classic-style horror (just look at Michael's ""experiments""). But it doesn't lose its laid-back style (Rodney massaging his feet during a conference), or its human side, such as the handling of certain characters who are lost

And the dialogue is pretty great, with lots of one-liners and snappy exchanges, with the occasional pop culture reference (""It's the ultimate answer to the great question of life, the universe and everything""). Most are from Rodney (""Just once, I would like to be taken prisoner by the sexy alien""), and Sheppard (""But then I'd be The Man, and who would I have to rage against?""). But there's humor from everyone (""He put his hand in my forehead! How can you resist that?"" ""Well, I like to close my eyes and think of England"").

One thing Atlantis does have is a high cast turnover, compared to the relatively unchanging cast of the previous series -- Higginson does a pretty good job as the scientist-command but is given too little to do,. In the fourth season she was replaced by Tapping, who brings a bit of seasoned science-military fusion to the mix, as well as some gutsy humor (such as when she stares down Ronan).

Flanigan has a nice O'Neillian snap to his performance (""I HATE clowns!""), David Hewlett is hilarious as the antisocial, ever-exasperated scientist, and Paul McGillion is adorable as a Scottish doctor. And while Rachel Luttrell and Jason Momoa are never quite as endearingly alien as SG-1's Teal'c (who makes a guest appearance in the fourth season), they are quite solid as a psychic martial-artist and a rough-edged warrior.

""Stargate Atlantis"" loses a few too many cast members, but the storylines and aliens add a fresh dimension to the Stargate universe. Definitely worth checking out -- including, one hopes, the upcoming fifth season.",1210982400,34,4815,5.005
3420823,5,B0018SLGG0,I am really enjoying the Stargate Atlantis series.  It is excellent.  The DVDs are high quality as expected.,1244592000,,108,4.944444444444445
3420824,5,B0018SLGG0,"I'm into the first season, disk two... the wraith suck, but we knew that before we bought the video.  For the Atlantis team, though, nothing but thumbs up. As they figure out character strengths and plot weaknesses, theirs is nothing different than any spin off that has to eventually make it on their own, and they will... I know... i've seen some of these episodes before.  That's why i bought the set of the first four seasons.  That, and i've suddenly developed this strange allergic reaction to citrus.",1243209600,,507,4.738636363636363
3420825,3,B0018SLGG0,"For the most part I am satisfied with this product.  The only problem is that a few of the discs skip while playing them and disc 1 of season 4&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-Atlantis-Seasons-1-4/dp/B0018SLGG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate Atlantis Seasons 1-4</a>&nbsp;doesn't even play.  I have to go through the hassle of getting a new one and returning this one.  I don't understand why a brand new disc comes damaged.",1242777600,,481,6.484375
3420826,5,B0018SLGG0,"I understood that this product was not in stock, but I ended up getting up far sooner than I expected. This TV series is an excellent SciFi adventure, with good character development and a good dose of humor. The humans who have traveled to the Pegasus galaxy are in danger, facing an enemy who not only wants to kill them but find Earth and destroy it also. Yet the show is not too graphic.  It tackles tough moral issues without gratuitous violence. It acknowledges sexual tension without indulging in sexual scenes. It shows that choices have consequences, usually beyond anything you could imagine at the time. I find it excellent entertainment to share with my teenager.",1241654400,,675,4.818965517241379
3420827,4,B0018SLGG0,"This product is definitely worth the price if you think about buying separately each season will cost you about $20. Now with 4 seasons together it is less than $60 plus it is free shipping. Doesn't that sound nice?
It is no need to talk about the story itself. If you are a fan of stargete just like I am, you don't need to think it twice about take it into your collection.
The only reason that I didn't give it a 5 star ratting is that the manu of the first season dvds was poorly designed and difficult to use on my dvd player. But from season two the problem has been fixed.",1241136000,,579,4.087719298245614
3420828,5,B0018SLGG0,"What can I say? Our family likes this series. While the wraiths might be a LOT scary for little ones, if your family is into their mid-to-late teenage years, then you might consider watching this together. -Not a bad entertainment for ""popcorn-night""!",1239753600,,251,5.0

This was a great show, and it ended far too soon.  I know they are going the movie route, but I miss my regular dose.
Still waiting for season five.",1237680000,,323,7.72972972972973
3420830,5,B0018SLGG0,"I thought I was buying 1 box with all four seasons in it. What I got was each season in thier own box as if I bought them seperately. They were bound with shrink wap. I've been watching them over and over. I'm looking foreword to getting season 5! Don't have seasons 1-4, this is the BEST way to get them NOW!",1235865600,5,309,4.0
3420831,5,B0018SLGG0,Stargate Atlantis is an exceptional series and when I found that it was much more cost effective to purchase seasons 1 - 4 as a set instead of one at a time I went for it.  Excellent service from Amazon.com,1234137600,,206,4.15
3420832,4,B0018SLGG0,I love the stargate series.  I have stargate sg-1 (all ten season) and the original movie.  I am a big sci-fi buff.  I know this is going to be a great addition to my collection. Jan Minnick,1233014400,,190,4.081081081081081
3420833,1,B0018SLGG0,"The pricing on this makes no sense for $100+ when each season is selling for $20 (*4 = $80).  Brilliant!  I don't see that you're getting anything in addition to the four seasons.  Plus the fact that the 5th season is still due out.  Why not purchase each separately OR if one must, simply wait until the collection is out in a boxed set with all the extra goodies that always come with the boxed sets.?.  Just wondering.",1232323200,3,421,4.346153846153846
3420834,5,B0018SLGG0,"Fan of SG-1 series, Atlantis didn't let me down.  Looking forward to the Season 5 DVD coming out Summer 2009. Since the the season finale for Atlantis was Jan., I'm excited that there might be another chapter of 'Stargate Universal'.",1231977600,,233,4.825
3420835,5,B0018SLGG0,Stargate Atlantis is absolutely a must buy for the Stargate junky.  Every episode is a treat for the senses.  I hope that the rumor that season 5 is the last season is false. What kind of world would it be without Stargate?,1231718400,,223,4.285714285714286
3420836,5,B0018SLGG0,"I've been a fan of the Stargate franchise since the feature film came out and always thought that Mac Gyver made a fine Jack O'Neill, but I shied away from purchasing the Atlantis season box sets till now.

For whatever reason, I kind of lost interest in the series in the middle of season two and never went back to watching them in first run broadcast.

Then, there I was one evening cruising around the sat dish looking for something good to watch when I stumbled on an episode of Atlantis in a late night syndication slot on a local station. It was a season 4 episode and I was hooked again right there in the opening teaser!

The characters are strong, the writing is crisp and the production is top notch. (The ten years spent cranking out SG1 episodes hasn't hurt this production company... they know exactly what it takes to create an hour of compelling science fiction for television)

The quality of the DVD set is also first rate with tight programming and clean sparse menu sets. Navigating the discs is a pleasure and besides the episodes themselves, the sprinkling of bonus material on each disc (with each bonis item tied in to one of the episodes on that disc) is a nice change from the ""all the bonus piled on one final disc"" approach we see in so many episodic TV box sets.

Formatting is typical for MGM TV products with the episodes (and vam) spread across 5 discs and presented in 3 thin cases (2 doubles and a single) all packed in a narrow slip cover.

I've been chugging my way through the series since it arrived and now that I've made my way into season 4, I can only hope that season 5 (the final season) is released soon so that I can order it before I hit the S4 cliff hanger I'm sure is coming!

Whether you're a fan of Stargate or just a fan of good character driven science fiction, don't miss this show.",1229212800,,1836,4.366568914956011
3420837,4,B0018SLGG0,"The quality is good but we live in Australia and our problem is that we can only watch the DVD's on our computer as they won't play on our DVD and TV. There must be something wrong with the formatting oe something, but we can watch them on the computer which is ok but disappointing.",1227312000,,283,4.163636363636364
3420838,5,B0018SLGG0,This set was awesome. My husband and I are both Stargate fans and really enjoyed watching them together.,1226448000,,104,4.833333333333333
3420839,5,B0018SLGG0,So much fun and continuing off the SG-1 series. Love the sci-fi thing and does this ever stretch the imagination!,1224633600,,113,4.7
3420840,5,B0018SLGG0,"So Glad that they changed the cases that the dvd's came in from the SG1 series, we ended up putting the SG1 series on a bulk cd spindle to prevent scratching the disks up as that set came in tight cardboard sleeves that rubbed against the disks producing scratches..bummer!!

 Now regarding the content of Stargate Atlantis......... ever since hearing Rodney McKay tell Samantha Carter that he always was attracted to DUMB BLONDES (her!) I couldn't wait for more of the witty banter & sarcastic remarks, they really were so unexpected & funny! While the other characters took more time to grow on me, my husband & sons fell right into step from their beloved SG1 series ....onward & upward to Atlantis! Bummer that we have to wait for the next years shows..we live waaaay out in the hills of TN, no TV reception so we exclusively watch DVD's, but as with SG1, you can't go wrong here, (see my review on that)PLUS you get to see your beloved SG1 characters again on ""Atlantis"" as they pop in & out of the shows as guest stars!",1224115200,,1025,4.535135135135135
3420841,5,B0018SLGG0,These dvd's came quickly with only a few marks on them that do not seem to effect the ability or quality of playback.  I had enjoyed the shows on TV and will now be able to watch them when I want with a great quality picture for my new TV.,1223251200,,239,3.78
3420842,5,B0018SLGG0,I am completely pleased.  I received the movies even quicker than expected and all was exactly as advertised.  Well done!,1223251200,,121,5.0

8270983,5,B0018SLGG0,"So far the best spin-off series I have seen. It holds it's own as a stand-alone show though it doesn't have to because it ran concurrently with its parent series, so there is plenty of cross-over references and at least 4 or 5 cross-over episodes. If you're a fan of SG-1, you're most likely not reading these reviews because you already own this show.",1363824000,,352,4.515625
8270984,5,B0018SLGG0,"One of the best reveals of the Stargate series was the discovery of Atlantis, the lost city of the Ancients, who were the ones who built the Stargates in the first place. It was the culmination of all the wonderful mythology and science fiction built into the previous seasons of the show. And finally being able to be around all the science the writers had hinted at for so long should have been a sci-fi fan's dream come true. But it never really lived up to it's potential. Which is partially the fault of the fan. It's hard for anything to live up to our sweet imagination. But overall, despite some greatness, this spin off series fell short on both acting and story.",1348444800,,672,4.471544715447155

8270986,4,B0018SLGG0,"Stargate Atlantis is not exactly the highest quality show ever but it is totally entertaining and I appreciate that I can watch it with the kids. The second season is better than the first but it is easy to see that their operating budget got bigger and thus the graphics, writing, etc. There were only two episodes (in season 2) that were even questionable but only because a woman strips to her bra and another you see topless from the back. Otherwise, it's great, clean fun.",1262995200,,477,4.558139534883721
8270987,5,B0018SLGG0,"The first four seasons were great television.  While the fifth season started to show a slight decline, the first four are very strong, and represent the kind of classic sci-fi fun adventures that used to be the norm.  They don't rely on pretentious stories, or bleak and dark futures, but on good stories and strong characters.  Recomended for fans of sci-fi.  Also, the price on all four together isn't bad either.",1259884800,,416,4.816901408450704

8270991,4,B0018SLGG0,"If you've enjoy the 10 years of Stargate SG1, you have to work a little bit to let yourself feel part of this new family. And the series producers don't make it easy. Some of the most sympathetic characters are lost way too soon; heroically, but too soon. SG1 characters make appearances, but never get to stay (except for McKay). Still, once you get into the story lines, and, more importantly, the character lines, it's a good ""child"" of the original tales of the 'Chapa'ai.' There is adventure, good science for the fictional possibilities, and some great characters that have grown in depth over the seasons.",1245628800,,612,4.783018867924528
