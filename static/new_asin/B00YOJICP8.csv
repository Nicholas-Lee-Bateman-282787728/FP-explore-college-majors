7223243,5,B00YOJICP8,"Unexpected, the new film from writer/director Kris Swanberg, is one of the few movies that Ive been truly impressed by this year. Ive definitely been hugely affected by other pictures - from Clouds of Sils Maria to Manglehorn - but the title of Swanbergs latest feature tells all. It wasn't something I expected to enjoy quite as much as I did, and thats what made the experience all the more rewarding. Its all-around great feel is not only due to the fantastic work behind the camera, but from its two leads Cobie Smulders and Gail Bean as well. Together, they just might be the most vibrant and funny on-screen pair of recent memory.

Smulders, whos most known for her roles in the The Avengers and the television series Agents of Shield, plays a Chicago high-school teacher who discovers shes pregnant along with one of her graduating students. The two form an immediate bond, with Smulders character trying her best to get the promising student accepted at the nearby Illinois University. And, obviously, the film is mainly about them dealing with their shared situation. The setup isn't particularly original, but that is easily overlooked once we see this delightful acting duo in full swing. Cobie Smulders succeeds in distancing herself from some of her larger-scale work, and the proper introduction of newcomer Gail Bean is certainly well-deserved. Their infectious back-and-forth compels you to keep watching and ultimately care about what happens to their characters.

Beyond that, the film is beautifully shot and tightly edited (coming in at around ninety minutes). The camera never really strays from our two main characters, and this adds to the already intimate quality of the film. It undoubtedly solidifies Kris Swanberg as an important dramatic director, and serves as a perfect antidote for those tired of this summers blockbusters. If you get the chance to see this wonderful little movie, take it.",1438473600,2,1921,5.075949367088608
7223244,4,B00YOJICP8,"This is a feel good story about two pregnant women. Samantha (Cobie Smulders) is a white teacher at a predominantly African-American high school in Chicago.  She becomes pregnant and gets married. She discovers that Jasmine (Gail Bean) who sports a 3.8 GPA is also pregnant. Samantha and Jasmine become friends as Samantha attempts to help her get into college in spite of her pregnancy. For some reason Samantha was unaware that her underprivileged students don't have the same values as herself. About an hour into the film, the student becomes the teacher, giving Samantha an epiphany.

While the film discusses working mothers vs stay at home moms, I didn't see it as a real strong criticism for either one. There film was designed to show the contrasting lives of the two women.

Guide: F-bomb. Brief sex? No nudity. Happy ending.",1438473600,,835,4.95

7223246,5,B00YOJICP8,"This was such a touching and excellent film. The casting is great - lots of great performances by familiar faces and new ones (Gail Bean) as well. I loved how realistic and balanced this film felt. Characters weren't overly nefarious, saint-like, or some other unrealistic portrayal - they were humans with their good moments and bad ones.

Looking back at older movies about teachers specifically - they are often filled with really problematic racial or gender tropes, and this movie greatly excels at leading a much more progressive path. Some people may not care about this aspect - but for me, it was really nice to see after seeing so many 'white savior' complexes in movies about teachers.

It's a great film to watch with others and talk about later - I highly recommend it!",1437868800,6,782,4.785185185185185

7223249,3,B00YOJICP8,"It's an ok movie  but it would help for the director to look at the Chicago map. Englewood is not close to Truman Community College - they are on the opposite side of Chicago - probably nearly 2 hours by the L! I have a feeling that whoever was responsible for looking at the map was also responsible for the poster... other than that it's a pleasant movie, nothing groundbreaking.",1437782400,2,381,4.442857142857143
7223250,4,B00YOJICP8,"It is so refreshing to find a movie that is intelligent and not a cliche. If this was a Hollywood big budget film, it probably would have had a different ending and would have been good, but not as real...and who knew that Cobie Smulders was such an excellent actress.

8718658,1,B00YOJICP8,"CONTAINS A FEW SPOILERS.....THERE ISN'T MUCH TO TELL.

A 30 year old teacher and a 17 year old high school senior are both pregnant unexpectedly and they become friends.

There were a few small parts of this movie that I enjoyed (such as the positive things about being pregnant, like seeing your first ultrasound and having a baby shower), but those scenes were very short, and so I mostly did not enjoy this movie.  This movie showed very little excitement about pregnancy, and there were absolutely no joys over feeling the baby move for the first time or picking out names or shopping for maternity clothes and baby clothes or any of the good things about pregnancy.  This movie is not about wanting to have a baby, instead, it is about coping with having a baby that you didn't want.

I always loved Elizabeth McGovern, and it was shocking to see how much she has changed.  I hardly recognized her.
I didn't like her character at all.  Elizabeth McGovern could have saved this movie if she had been given a larger role.

This movie is about a white woman who is a teacher in an all-black high school.  She was filling out a questionnaire on her computer, wondering if she might be pregnant, and the first question was whether any birth control was ever used.  She checked ""no,"" that she never used any type of birth control, and yet, she was shocked that she has become pregnant by her live-in boyfriend.  Later, ironically, she is in the teachers' lounge where teachers are discussing how so many teens at the school are pregnant and how it is very irresponsible and very preventable.  It is mentioned that condoms are available from the school nurse, and it is ironic that not just the students, but also the teacher, never used them.

The teacher discovers that one of her favorite students is also pregnant, and they start spending time together as the teacher tries to help the student to get into a college that she can afford while raising a baby alone.  They end up having a horrible argument when it turns out that the teacher was clueless to the realities facing a teen attempting to raise a baby alone while going to college and also needing to work and having no options for housing.  The teacher insists that the student must go to college for the sake of her baby, saying that the student has a 3.8 average, which I found amazing since her grammar whenever she spoke was awful.

This movie goes downhill as it becomes clear that the teacher is extremely immature about being a mother and having a career and how to handle finances and is in no position to mentor someone else.  The teacher is going to simply stay home after having her baby, letting her new husband work and comfortably support them (for a few years), so she cannot understand the struggles of a teen who is not as lucky.

If this was supposed to be a comedy, I didn't see any humor in two unplanned pregnancies in two completely different situations trying to bond.

If this was supposed to be a drama, then there wasn't much of a story.  There were few emotional scenes.  The teen breaks up with her boyfriend, but it happens off-screen, so there is no story there when there was a lot to tell.  The teacher marries her live-in boyfriend just because she has become pregnant, and there is no romance there (they don't bring anyone with them when they get married by a judge, and she wears an ordinary green dress, and they don't even do any celebrating after the wedding, not even a special wedding night).

This movie was extremely predictable with no surprises and no twists. The teacher wanted a career (she wanted to move on from teaching to work in a museum)  which did not work out for her, and she was upset about just staying home with a baby, but she seemed suddenly happy at the end, although she also appeared to be settling for a life that she didn't want.  The teen found a way to go to a college near her home  and stay home with her family so that she can have help her with her baby, and she found it all on her own, without the teacher's help.  We see the teacher give birth, but at the end, the teen is still pregnant.

So, it is a long, boring movie full of problems which are suddenly gone or unimportant at the very abrupt ending.

I have seen so many movies about ""unplanned unexpected pregnancies"" that I really enjoyed and would recommend which actually had real plots.

Such as:
""Where the Heart Is""
""Fifteen and Pregnant""
""October Baby""
""Juno""
""For Keeps?""
""Gimme Shelter""
""Angie""
""Grandma""
""The Last American Virgin""
""Unwed Father""
""Immediate Family""
""Deep in My Heart""
""Ten Thousand Saints""
""Mother and Daughter : The Loving War""
""Agnes of God""
""Plain Truth""
""Too Young to be a Dad""
""I Want to Keep My Baby""
""Saved!""
""Precious""
""Mom at Sixteen""
""Nine Months""
""Micki and Maude""
""Double Daddy""
""Daddy""
""Pregnancy Pact""
""The Object of My Affection""
""Riding in Cars with Boys""
""The Next Best Thing""
""Look Who's Talking""
""Knocked Up""
""Cradle of Conspiracy""
""The Other Mother""
""Expecting Amish""

Yes, I keep a list of movies that I have enjoyed.

The list above is regarding pregnancies that were ""unwanted and unplanned,"" of course, overlapping onto other topics also.

For movies that I enjoyed about pregnancies that were ""wanted and planned,""
my list is much longer, which includes ""She's Having a Baby"" with Elizabeth McGovern.",1459209600,,5342,4.613107822410148

8718662,4,B00YOJICP8,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Samantha Abbott (Cobie Smulders) is a young teacher with her whole future planned out. Shes recently discovered that an opening at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry has come open and has a solid chance of getting the job. It couldn't come at a more opportune time as the inner city school she teaches in is about to be shut down and students sent to another school. Then she discovers that she is pregnant.

While most movies these days would focus on the option of abortion and get into a politically correct dissertation about that being the best choice to make, this movie instead moves forward with Samanthas decision to have the child. She and her boyfriend John (Anders Holm) get married and begin making plans. He decorates a room for the baby. He is as interested in being a parent as she is.

At her job, Samantha takes a keen interest in her students. In particular she has high hopes for one, Jasmine (Gail Bean). Jasmine has the potential to make something of her life, to get herself out of the mean streets of Chicago. Samantha has plans of helping her along the way, encouraging her to try out for scholarships to various colleges since her scores are always so high. And then Jasmine too becomes pregnant.

Rather than see her star pupil continue the cycle of remaining in a low income life with few options to move her forward, Samantha takes a more personal interest in her. The two go to yoga classes together and talk about their plans for the future. Samantha tries to help Jasmine get into a college, especially the college that she once went to. But plans and dreams are often not the same as reality.

But the movie isn't just about Samantha and her attempt to help Jasmine. Its also about these two women who come from completely different backgrounds and how they interact with one another. While the desire Samantha has for Jasmine is noble it may not be the reality that Jasmine knows exist, perhaps more so than her teacher does. Samanthas disappointments in the life Jasmine may eventually come to expect shows that while she intends to do good sometimes intentions are not what reality will provide.

The movie drives this home in her own life as well. Where she once had these plans of what she wanted to accomplish it all changes with the arrival of a child. She might want the career she dreamed of but with a child in the picture that might not be possible. Does this child present something wonderful to be cherished or is it just an obstacle in her desire for more? These are the same problems that confront Jasmine but on a completely different level.

While these ideas may sound highbrow and not entertaining the movie makes them work and entertain as well. The camaraderie between the two leads weaves itself so perfectly that you feel for both women and want the best for them. You want that happy ending to watch when the film closes. But thats the point of the film. What you want and what you get may be two different things. But there is also the possibility that what you wanted wasn't what you really desired to begin with. And in the end the possibilities are always there if you're willing to aim for them.

The movie may not have been one of the top box office hits of the year but it is a film worth watching. All involved do an amazing job of presenting their characters as real people. For me the true sign of a good actor is if you can believe them in the part and not think you're watching an actor in a role. Both Smulders and Bean accomplish that here and it makes me look forward to more from both of them.

I can say that while I didn't expect it I found this movie to be one of the more pleasurable experiences Ive had lately when it comes to a mainstream movie that didn't fit into any genre title. It succeeds on all levels from acting to directing to story and holds your interest start to finish. Its one that I can honestly say is worth watching.",1445904000,2,3977,4.4594222833562585

8718664,3,B00YOJICP8,"Spoiled, self-absorbed, immature white woman aged 30 gets pregnant and the resultant anguish over her ""dilemma"" and her ""options"" weigh her down, all while she is trying to save the life and future of one of her black students with an otherwise promising outlook, except that she's also pregnant, though without the self-absorption, or anguish that comes from being spoiled and immature...so she becomes the ""teacher"" in a sense, and teacher learns from student about the bigger issue of What Matters Most In Life, though it doesn't trickle down to her own mother, played by the lovely Elizabeth McGovern.  Although I guess I really didn't like the character she plays, Cobie Smulders does a good job playing her and she & Elizabeth McGovern (one of my favorites ever since She's Having A Baby) could pass for mother & daughter.  But since spoiled, self-absorbed, immature people who have it all and anguish over whether or not they want it anyway kind of get on my nerves, this character did, too.",1444348800,,998,4.899408284023669
