2317726,4,B0009S4IR4,"Hmm, I'm the first one to review Hollywood Flies.  That must make this movie a bit underrated I believe.

It's about a woman who gets kidnapped by a couple guys she picks up alongside the road during a hitch hike, and they turn around and kidnap her when she arrives to a hotel (with her cousin).

It's more along the lines of a cheesy action movie with a slight low budget feel, and not so much drama build up.

The action scenes are pretty good, though unbelievable because the girl eventually ends up not having a problem sleeping with one of the guys that kidnapped her, lol.

Anyway, the girls cousin has to play the hero and search out to find her.

Both cousins end up in their own separate situations involving danger, and it was good enough for me to claim the storytelling was quite good.

There were a couple plot twists near the end that surprised me.  The story does a pretty respectable job delivering a couple plot twists.  You wonder how everything is going to unfold with the bad guys and the, er, OTHER separate set of bad guys, hehe.  There's a lot going on at once, but it's easy to understand and not confusing in any way.  Again, the movies strengh is being an action movie that keeps you guessing.",1248998400,9,1220,4.401785714285714

8066230,4,B0009S4IR4,"**** 3-1/2 Stars ****  A very tasty & twisty (pay attention!) crime thriller, with good production values and even better acting.  A lot of reviewers focus on Brad Renfro (playing 'Jamie'), as well they should - he was a gifted actor, but also a junkie who OD'd at just 25 years old.  This is one of his last roles.  But Renfro's real-life melodrama should not overshadow the great acting of others in this film, esp. Bianca Guaccero ('Martina') and Caprice Bourret ('Cherie') - yes, they both are world-class beauties, but they work their ass*s off here to prove their acting chops, esp. Ms. Guaccero.  Bottom line: This is a convoluted story that demands close attention, and mostly rewards it.  If you like well-made 'B' thrillers (aka, I got talent but no money), this flick is worth your time.  Thanks for reading!",1486944000,,819,4.76595744680851
8066231,4,B0009S4IR4,"This is a fairly good low budget flick
The onlly thing I didn't ;ile is the music but even that was not that bad I just didn't like the singers voice,
But the obe touch I was glad to see was even the credits were done well.
The cast were mostly new or under used the faces. However the guy in the wheelchair has a face but it's average & forgetable.",1485993600,,349,3.9295774647887325

8066236,4,B0009S4IR4,"Crime thriller, drama, action. Casino robbers, $3 million, loot stolen, ransom, a sub-plot woven in. Script, plot, and acting are B-movie. The characters are actually interesting. A hit man with end stage cancer, bad guy in a wheelchair, bimbo is clever, etc. Not going to win any awards, but better than most B-movies.",1482105600,,319,5.037735849056604
