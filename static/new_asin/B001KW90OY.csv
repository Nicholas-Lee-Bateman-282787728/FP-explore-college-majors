8316306,3,B001KW90OY,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

PROS:  I really liked the strength/cardio workouts.  They were effective and made sensible use of the bar.  Worked up a good sweat and lots of jumping kept my heart rate up.  Backup ""dancers"" were non-annoying with one as modifier for low impact moves.  Music was fine and helped keep time for the moves.

CONS:  The cardio included a lot of dance-y moves that never get my heart rate up enough to get a good workout.  Also, I have to say that stepping all over the bar on the ground --- especially as you get fatigued and sloppy --- probably isn't the best idea.  People will probably land on it and end up flat on their back or worse.  To give the instructor credit, she notes that the cardio can be done without the bar (as I did.)  For me, the main con, unfortunately, was the instructor.  While I liked that she could be serious and pushed for a tough workout, more often than not, her upbeat style was driving me crazy instead.  I'm going to date myself by saying that she kind of reminded me of the narrarator on one of my little long playing records --- like the Color Kittens, a favorite but not for working out to --- with ""whoooooa!"" and ""waaaaah!"" and ""gosh!"" all over the place I could almost hear ""pounce! pounce! pounce!""

Generally, gave this an average rating since, depending on your workout level and what kind of instructor you prefer, this may work for you.",1306713600,,1434,4.461538461538462
8316307,3,B001KW90OY,"I purchased this workout because I thought it used the Body Bar in most of the exercises.  I found that it is mostly a fast paced aerobic-type, cardio work-out and that the Bar is hardly used.  Energetic instructor and good cueing if you are looking for an aerobic workout.  I was looking for more use of the Bar.",1294358400,2,313,4.362068965517241
8316308,5,B001KW90OY,"Not to mention extreme cardio AND strength...the Body Bar intensifies this workout that I found myself mostly using the modifier who was always in clear view behind Mindy to watch.  Excellent camera angles helped.  Your options are: Strength/Cardio 1, 2, 3 & Cardio Drills 1, 2, & Floor Strength.  Get ready to use big, bold moves if you want the advanced level.  The options run about 25 minutes or so making it fast tempo workouts.  Exercises alternate between strength & cardio with little or no breaks.  The cardio portion is very dynamic & you always have the modifier in clear view, as an option.  You'll hold the Body Bar upright, like a ski pole, for all those cardio moves and then, perform multi-joint moves for the alternating strength moves.  High reps challenge your endurance as well.  I used a 4 lb. Body Bar & found myself at times leaving it aside.

As for the Cardio Drills, the choreography was similar as to working on a Step.  Mindy uses the Body Bar as a marker on the floor and you'll perform quick footwork (hops, straddles, slides) all around the bar, so use extreme caution or FOLLOW THE MODIFIER, as she works strictly as a floor aerobics workout. Strength/Cardio & Drills 1 mainly works the total body, Strength/Cardio & Drills 2 focuses on the lower torso, while Strength/Cardio 3 focuses on the upper torso muscles & Floor Strength isolates the upper torso with rows & twists while sitting, then onto the side plank (a killer) with single arm raises (I switched to my shorter Body Bar), concluding with ""not just ordinary push-ups"", but using the Body Bar as a marker, you'll alternate one hand up and below it the bar.

Mindy is just a huge shining star of hyper-motivation.  She cues perfectly, is fun to listen & watch to, and comes up with clever choreography. Never, ever boring.",1263945600,2,1814,4.7025316455696204
8316309,5,B001KW90OY,"Tough workout, but well cued and uncomplicated. As an advanced exerciser you might find yourself modifying quite a bit. She alternates cardio with toning, but each section has some of the other. If you own a body bar, it will be put to good use in this video. Mindy is superfriendly, as always. One of the other exercisers shows modifications.",1232668800,2,343,4.733333333333333
