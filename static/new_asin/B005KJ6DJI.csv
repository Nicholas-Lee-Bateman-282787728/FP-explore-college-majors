4717802,4,B005KJ6DJI,I was watching these movies by myself since my grandkids weren't due to spend time with me in the near future and I wanted to watch some 3D movies on my new 3D TV.  I loved all 3 movies.,1400630400,,186,3.769230769230769
4717803,4,B005KJ6DJI,I think Open Season was my least favorite.  Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was really good.  I would recommend that one.,1398643200,,123,4.545454545454546
4717804,5,B005KJ6DJI,Great collection. It's a lot cheaper to get these movies through this collection rather than buy them separately. You'll save a lot of money. The movies look beautiful in blu ray and the 3d was excellent!!,1398038400,,205,4.722222222222222
4717805,4,B005KJ6DJI,"To watch them again in 3-d was a treat
I like the ability to switch from 3-D to 2-D on the one disc",1394668800,3,99,3.347826086956522
4717806,5,B005KJ6DJI,"You get both 2D and 3D on the same disc, i like that a lot, so you don't need a 3D set up to watch this box set, very nice.",1391472000,6,123,3.1333333333333333
4717807,3,B005KJ6DJI,bought 3D for kids to watch. The Story monster house is a bit dark compared to the others in the pack,1384300800,,101,3.857142857142857
4717808,5,B005KJ6DJI,Great value and fun viewing for the entire family. 3D is pretty good for the price of admission. Get it!,1380240000,,104,4.25
4717809,4,B005KJ6DJI,"I was looking to purchase the Monster House 3D Blu-Ray, but when I saw this bundled deal I couldn't pass it up. All three movies look great in Blu-Ray format, and the 3D is definitely an improvement, and makes it an even better value.",1361491200,,234,4.340909090909091
4717810,5,B005KJ6DJI,"This product is an excellent value for the price. All 3 movies come in their own seperate full size blu-ray cases and as the seller states, works great on any US region 1 3D Blu-ray player. The 3D was also great and works the same as all US 3D movies, and there is english language on the packaging. Highly recommended!",1359417600,4,319,4.333333333333333
4717811,5,B005KJ6DJI,"All three of the films in this package are fun to watch. Seeing as though individually each film individually costs around $30, this package is definitely a value. I was concerned when I did not recognize the ratings symbols on the packaging. Then I realized they were packaged for Great Britain. I was then concerned about region encoding. There was no issue at all, they all played fine in my playstation 3.
Steve Buscemi gave a fantastic performance in Monster House. My four year old daughter loves darker movies, and she talks about this one a lot.
Open season feels like a Dreamworks movie. It was fun, but not as substantial as a Pixar film. The hair was great in it though.  It was Sony's first animated feature, and it had tremendous polish. It looked good. There were some great comedic moments, and some fun action sequences.
Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs is the best film of the lot. Everything in it was fantastic. Great story, great voice talent, great animation. If it said Pixar on the box, no one would be the wiser. Bill Hader was a perfect choice for the hero. He had great believability in his performance. Anna Faris was also great. James Caan is never less than fantastic. He is so good in this that you don't even realize that he is one of the voices.",1359158400,3,1278,4.532467532467533

4717816,4,B005KJ6DJI,"A Comment on the Discs Themselves:
As a one-star review states, these discs can take a bit longer to load than a standard Blu-ray (likely due to their imported, region free status) but it's certainly not a deal-breaker, especially considering the cost of this set is close to the cost of a single 3D combo pack at the store. I've noticed a 3-5 minute wait at the loading screens (if that) and then the discs play just fine.

A Comment on the Included Films:
""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" is easily the strongest film of the set, and delivers the best animation and 3D effects. ""Monster House"", while being a personal spooky family film favorite of mine, is a bit lacking in its first act, but thankfully makes up for it with the rest of the quirky, offbeat story. The motion-capture technique used to animate the human characters wasn't a big hit with audiences then, and almost ten years later, it's not going to change any minds. My boyfriend who had never seen the film before, was a bit turned off by how dated some of the animation looked. Everything non-human is flawless, but there's something cold and off-putting from the human characters sometimes. The 3D effects are great, especially whenever the house is on-screen. So even if the general esthetic of the film isn't your favorite, there's definitely plenty to be enjoyed in the 3D presentation. ""Open Season"", an animated film I avoided like the plague, was actually a pleasant surprise. I set my expectations basement low with this one due to the dread of hearing Martin Lawrence and Ashton Kutcher voice-act for an hour and a half - but it wasn't all that bad. The aforementioned voice acting aside, the movie had quite a few great laughs, beautiful animation that has held up very well, beautiful 3D effects that really add to the action and humor, and some lovely voice acting from actress Debra Messing (why doesn't she do this more often?!). It's the film of least substance in this set, but kids will surely love it and parents will probably be surprised at how much they like it too, once they let their guard down.

Overall:
As of the this posting, you can't beat the price and quality of this set (each film comes in its own case, and can be viewed in 3D or 2D). So even if you are only familiar with two movies in this set, at this price I say snag it - the third film is likely to win you over with it's beautiful 3D charm. A great non-Disney/Pixar set of animated films to add to any Blu-ray 3D collection.",1450742400,3,2488,4.538975501113586
