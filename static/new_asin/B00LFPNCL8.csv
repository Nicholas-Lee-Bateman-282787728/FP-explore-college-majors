8665642,3,B00LFPNCL8,"In so many ways, this DVD is a cheat.  I don't understand the 4 and 5-star reviews, unless they are from Dusty fans who don't own any of the other fine DVDs out there.  If you own DUSTY SPRINGFIELD LIVE AT THE BBC, FULL CIRCLE, REFLECTIONS or DUSTY SPRINGFIELD LIVE AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL, you already have most of this footage, and all of these DVDs feature superior sound and much better image quality. Being a rabid Dusty fan, I had a knee-jerk reaction to this listing, and ordered it without hesitation. One thing that excited me was a song on the program called ""When Love Has Gone."" Wow, I thought, a Dusty performance I've never heard before!  More on that in a second.

But the above having been said, there are some moments that made this one a keeper for me.  There is footage here that I've never seen, and that's pretty unusual for me, a fan who has followed Springfield's career since I was 12 years old (I'd rather not advertise how old I am now).  Although lip-synched (a common, economical practice on television broadcasts in the 60s and 70s), the footage of ""Can I Get A Witness,"" ""Every Day I Have To Cry,"" and ""A Brand New Me"" were enough fun that I will not be discarding this otherwise disappointing purchase.  Another clip, ""Some of Your Lovin',"" a big, early favorite, is one I don't recall seeing before, either, but the sound on this one is the worst on the DVD.

""When Love Has Gone"" turns out to be a brief montage of still photographs featuring Springfield through the years, accompanied by an instrumental track by some musician or group called Blue Boys. Virtually all of these photos are familiar, and some of them very famous.  After a couple of minutes, the photos and music stop abruptly, mid-note.

I'd give this release only one star, but hey, it's Dusty!",1441238400,4,1795,4.529411764705882

8665644,5,B00LFPNCL8,"There will never ever be another Dusty Springfield.  Her music got me through a particularly rough period in my life called the VietNam  Era.  Her music helped keep a lot of us sane in a difficult situation.  I have to agree with one of the other commenters that it would have been nice to know where each performance was, and presented in chronological order.  Two of the B & W were a little blurry but it didn't take away from the soulful sound of an absolutely entrancing voice.  I have almost every album Dusty made and cherish them as they are irreplaceable in my book.  Money well spent of a DVD of a talented woman we lost way too early.",1430956800,4,644,4.316666666666666
8665645,5,B00LFPNCL8,"Okay, I'll say up front that this is not a fancy production. The packaging is simple and there are no credits at beginning or end. There is a Pay All and a Song Selection choice on the menu. The small print on the back of the package tells us that it is ""Licensed from Sunset Entertainment Ltd IRELAND.

But the DVD is packed with 20 powerful performances by the wonderful Dusty Springfield - running just over 50 minutes. A few are ones I've seen before from her early appearances on British TV dance shows - where she is obviously lip-synching. But more than half are in color and include some of her last televised appearances. Dusty was always covering soul music but here she gets to do Motown as well (and just as well too). There's ""People Get Ready"" and ""Can I Get A witness?"", both songs made popular by male singers. For the clip of the Motown duet (Marvin and Tami) - ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"", we have Dusty going head-to-head with (of all people)Englebert Humperdinck (this is not noted on the pkg). The stand out for me was the performance of ""Quiet Please, There's a Lady on The Stage""  from Peter Allen's musical ""The Boy From Oz"" - not a typical Dusty song, but , boy, does she make it soar!

The performances are not in chronological order so it's a bit confusing to watch here go from black and white to color and back again. As I said, there is no info on the year or location of these numbers.

The package lists a 21st song ""When The Love Has Gone"". This is actually an instrumental by ""The Blue Boys"" accompanying a photo montage of images of Dusty.

I really am tempted to delete a star in my rating for the bare bones packaging but nearly all the prints are sharp and sound (except on two) more than acceptable. But Dusty's performances encouraged me to up the rating to 5 stars.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
