8032132,3,B0002UOZVS,This set of videos may be of interest to other genealogists as it was to me because it is about a family who immigrated to this country from Scotland.  It pictures what life may have been like for some of the immigrants.  As a Campbell whose family did immigrate from Scotland I enjoyed this video because it helped me to visualize and experience what my own ancestors possibly endured as they learned to live in a new country.,1100131200,2,427,4.461538461538462
