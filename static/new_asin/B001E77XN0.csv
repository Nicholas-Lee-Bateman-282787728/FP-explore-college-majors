3546886,5,B001E77XN0,"Purchased for the Hornblower series, however, the Napoleon series and the Lost Battalion were excellent.  I have not had a chance to view the remaining issues.  Great product as a very good price. Highly recommended.",1352160000,,216,5.142857142857143
3546887,5,B001E77XN0,This is a great set.  Everything about these films is top notch.  If these played in the theater i'd go see them. These films are far better then the crap they put out in the theater.,1335657600,,183,4.055555555555555
3546888,5,B001E77XN0,"If you want some DVD time, this is it. I so enjoyed it and I'm sharing it with friends.

  Thanks so much

3546889,5,B001E77XN0,"I just love this collection and A&E, as always, has come through wonderfully with a comprehensive and accurately vivid account of each story! A must for all history lovers!",1310860800,,172,4.9655172413793105
3546890,5,B001E77XN0,"This package is worth having as part of every home movie collection. I loved the Longitude movie and learned a lot with it. Still have to see the rest, some twenty hours of masterpieces!",1300665600,8,186,4.5
3546891,5,B001E77XN0,"This is a fabulous DVD series with exceptional acting, cinematography, and costuming.  Just fantastic!",1265587200,4,102,6.285714285714286
3546892,5,B001E77XN0,This is most certainly a must have collection for even the casual A&E fan. This set contains six of A&E's best efforts at a modest price. A purchase from a third party source makes it a steal! What a cost effective way to begin your own A&E collection.,1262217600,9,252,4.270833333333333
3546893,1,B001E77XN0,"We purchased the A&E Adventure Collection&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-A-E-Adventure-Collection-Benedict-Arnold-Horatio-Hornblower-Shackleton-Napoleon-The-Lost-Battalion-Longitude/dp/B001E77XN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The A&E Adventure Collection (Benedict Arnold / Horatio Hornblower / Shackleton / Napoleon / The Lost Battalion / Longitude)</a>believing it to be the continuation of the Horatio Hornblower episodes.  We had previously purchased the first 7 installments and were excited to find additional episodes.  However, on receipt, we were disappointed to discover that the collection was in fact some of the same episodes we already owned, with additional DVDs of other, unrelated movies.  On reading the return policy, we discovered that the DVDs are not returnable unless they are unopened.  However, without opening the package it is impossible to discover the deception.  This was our first online purchase for Amazon.  HUGELY disappointed!",1253059200,18,1006,7.341666666666667
3546894,5,B001E77XN0,"We already have two of the films (""Napoleon"" and ""Longitude"") in this collection and I'm looking forward to watching the rest. A&E puts a nice touch on everything they release onto DVD, so this new set should really be great for our whole family. Should also make a great Xmas gift, too.",1224460800,8,287,4.538461538461538
3546895,5,B001E77XN0,"This is a great collection. You get three Hornblower movies from A&E plus the miniseries Napoleon, The Lost Battallion, Benedict Arnold, Shackelton and my favorite of the bunch Longitude. All in an attractive sturdy case. Many hours of great programming for a very reasonable price.",1403827200,,282,5.288888888888889
3546896,5,B001E77XN0,"Bringing history and historically inspired fiction to the home theater .

A bargain at under $35 - for 14 DVD's , well scripted , well acted , and filmed in great locations .

MANY hours of top entertainment .",1398729600,,209,4.333333333333333
3546897,5,B001E77XN0,"SO MANY awesome adventure stories, all intelligently told and fun as hell.

I don't usually get into this sort of stuff, but MAN, this stuff is freaking mind-blowingly fun.  SO MUCH MORE ENTERTAINING THAN the latest predictable, flashy Johnny Depp crapfest or Michael Bay brain cell-icide.

Best part, every movie is *very* family friendly.  The Horatio Hornblower series is SO much more rewarding than Pirates of the Caribbean.",1389139200,,428,5.25
3546898,5,B001E77XN0,"Educational and entertaining.  The Shackleton adventure and the Horatio Hornblower videos were favorites.  In fact, we ordered the rest of the A&E Hornblower series.  The pleasant surprise was the account of the creation of an accurate timepiece for sea travel in 'Longitude' - what a great story.  Benedict Arnold was interesting from his perspective and 'The Lost Battalion' was heart-wrenching but also very good.  Least favorite - Napolean.  Overall, a great value; highly recommended!",1380672000,,489,5.54054054054054
3546899,4,B001E77XN0,"Not all of the 'adventures' presented here do justice to the subject (be that an historical or a fictional character) but the price is sure right.  I was in search of the movie Longitude when I came across this offering and truth be known I'd have paid the full price of the package for the movie and special features associated with that movie.  What an amazing tale of the triumph of one man in the face of bureaucratic ignorance and pride, not to mention the 'mirror image' of his champion going through much of the same in the following century.  The Hornblower tales (and again, the special features associated with same) were also quite good as fictional swashbuckling.  Both Shackleton and Napolean fell short in my view though I must admit it might have been too unwieldy to try to encompass the whole of either of those lives.  And I must also admit to a personal prejudice...I just couldn't stop giggling at the idea of Kelsey Grammer as George Washington...Jeff Daniels would be my choice.  The surprise treat of the package was the truly remarkable tour de force of To The Ends Of The Earth.  I place this right up there with Master and Commander as presenting a true and complete picture of what it meant to 'go down to the sea in ships'.  In all it was way more entertainment (and not a little enlightenment) than the price would suggest.  Bravo A&E!",1372032000,,1364,4.580246913580247
3546900,5,B001E77XN0,I've watched Hornblower and Shackleton and I am amazed at the way they just  seem to pull into the story. this is a great series and great value too. well Done A&E,1368230400,,163,4.09375
3546901,5,B001E77XN0,I would recommend this to everyone that might have a yearning for adventure on the hight seas.  The story lines are well planned and written.  A true joy to watch.,1359849600,,163,4.4
3546902,5,B001E77XN0,Love It... much of this is fictional (Horatio Hornblower) but set during a historical turbulent time.  The series is exceptional and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who enjoys action movies that the whole family can watch.,1358121600,,222,5.0
3546903,5,B001E77XN0,"This Great Collection Horatio Hornblower Is Great! My Dad loves it, and myself as well. The story's and the history of this great time is wonderful too watch. I would recamend it!",1356652800,,179,4.625
3546904,5,B001E77XN0,"It is difficult to find a movie series of the caliber, quality, and cleanliness of Horatio Hornblower, and the 'Longitude' series is great.  I highly recommend this!",1353715200,,165,5.111111111111111
8297012,4,B001E77XN0,Some super movies on this set. Love 'em! DOn't like that some have no subtitles so dinging it a star for that. Ridiculous. Put subtitles on the DVDs!,1522713600,,149,4.357142857142857
8297013,4,B001E77XN0,Doesn't have all the Hornblower episodes as claimed...  But a good collection for my husband who loved Longitude and Hornblower!  Others a bonus!,1458000000,,145,5.260869565217392
8297014,5,B001E77XN0,This is a great series. Wish they would do more like it. My wife and I watch it several times a year. Never get to old to watch.,1453852800,,128,3.607142857142857
8297015,5,B001E77XN0,"What a wonderful collection. The Hornblower films alone are worth the price. Their quality and attention to detail leave a remarkable impression of life on the high seas. Napoleon was good but not my favorite - it dragged on a little - I wish it had focused a bit more on his later life and what ultimately caused his downfall. But Isabella Rosalini is a terrific Josephine. Shackleton is great. Ken Branagh's portrayal shows the enigma and charisma of Shackleton-what it was about him that drew people to him-and their loyalty even after his star starts to fade. I haven't finished all of Lost Battalion-it's fairly gory and desperately sad, but I'm sure is realistic to what these men endured. Benedict Arnold was the poorest I'm afraid. He is portrayed in a very very negative light. If the film had at least shown what happened in a bit more detail after his defection this may have improved it. The price for the set is amazing. Find a rainy day, put your feet up, and have an adventure binge",1437436800,2,997,4.606741573033708

8297017,4,B001E77XN0,"Superior UK imports and decent Lost Battalion show, well above average in all respects.....Napoleonic saga is great fun, not great history, but perfectly acceptable for the period novice wishing to get an overview and feel for the sweep of events....thankfully, fine actors all round.",1423958400,,284,5.4772727272727275
8297018,5,B001E77XN0,Wow - star studded cast throughout.  What an entertainment value for adventure lovers!,1423353600,,86,5.615384615384615
8297019,4,B001E77XN0,"I bought this for the Napoleon miniseries (which is overpriced elsewhere), but wound up also enjoying Longitude and (especially) the Horatio Hornblower films. Benedict Arnold was hard to endure, given the characterization of the man as a venal and belligerent prima donna. Still, an excellent deal.",1420588800,,298,5.5
8297020,5,B001E77XN0,Actually worth watching!,1416528000,,24,7.333333333333333
8297021,5,B001E77XN0,"I read all the Hornblower books some years ago and loved them. When I watched these on TV, I was very pleased. This version really does them justice. I haven't watched these videos yet but the packaging is beautiful. I can hardly wait! (For the science fiction crossovers, Capt. Kirk was loosely based on Horatio Hornblower and you can easily see the similarities.)",1412208000,,365,4.809523809523809
