8153793,1,B000K15WBG,"Wow. My fiancee and I are planning our honeymoon to Thailand and bought the only two DVDs we could find about the country - this one and ""Amazing Thailand.""  This DVD consists ENTIRELY of ugly pictures with annoying fade-in and fade-out graphics set to annoying music (we watched at 5x speed on mute and it was still painful.) The photographs are poor quality, making even the most beautiful temples look dingy, dirty, and sad. There are lots of pictures of third-world Thailand - shanty villages, murky and polluted rivers, brownish green landscapes... No pictures of the stunning picturesque beaches we were hoping to see; no good pictures of temples or Bangkok.  In sum, this is a terrible DVD and I recommend that you buy a guidebook instead.",1176163200,5,746,4.866141732283465
8153794,1,B000K15WBG,"I bought ""Mexico City: An Ancient Mystery of Passion"", another travel guide DVD by Acacian Tales.  If you want to watch a slideshow of fuzzy pictures with crummy music playing (nothing is ever said), this is your DVD.  If you don't want to be ripped off, stay away.",1174262400,3,265,4.5
8153795,4,B000K15WBG,"I was amazed over all the different places this travel DVD takes you to, even to the golden triangle in the north. A really beautiful journey into the world of Thai, it gives some good insights on where to go. I recommend this one to anyone visiting Thailand for the first time or any one who would like to keep a great memory of Thailand.",1164067200,3,339,4.230769230769231
