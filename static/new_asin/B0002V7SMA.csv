2123442,3,B0002V7SMA,"Interesting synopsis of Karl Rove. His rise to power with local politics to serving as a senior advisor to George W. Bush. If you're looking for lots of information on Bush you'll be disappointed as the majority of the film is more backstory on Rove and his ""questionable"" ethics in running campaigns - including alleged rumours that he was behind the slandering of John McCain when he was running against Bush for the GOP nomination by saying McCain had a ""black love child"" when in reality McCain adopted a orphan from overseas.

There's also an interesting interview Max Cleland, the former Democrat who lost three of his four limbs in overseas duty who was crushed by Republicans politically for not supporting the Reb version of the Patriot Act by running ads of war vetern Cleland intersliced with clips of Saddam Hussain and Osama Bin Laden.

Overall very interesting however the best defense against the hegemony of the Neo con is to allow them to sink themselves with their own words until you have enough to sink them. This film had too much of one side of the story without using the other side of the arguement to prove the films point further.

In all fairness the filmmakers did try to arrange an interview with Rove but not without suprise he replied in writing with a ""No thank you"".

As a beleiver I found this film very interesting to view however I would *never* use this to try to swing an savvy swing voter.",1096675200,18,1428,4.632411067193676
2123453,3,B0002V7SMA,"Giving this film a neutral star rating so its rating isn't unduly altered. I've seen this film; like any political documentary, there's a degree of Kool-Aide drinking that has to occur before everything goes down unopposed. I personally enjoyed it very much, but you have to maintain a healthy bit of suspicion when you view something as politically charged as ""Bush's Brain"".

Which is why reading the reviews here is so distrubing. I should be able to find one- and two-star ratings with enlightened Bush-friendly commentary as to why this film is bogus, right? In the service of keeping an open mind?

So here's my request. If you're going to give this film a one- or two-star rating that derides it, or that explicitly supports Bush, or that personally attacks the film's producers or the book's authors, would you please:

1. Gather some facts

2. Form an idea that you can establish in writing

3. Make sure you've actually seen the film

2123454,4,B0002V7SMA,"Bush' brain depicts the tactics and character of George W. Bush's political consultant, Karl Rove. They describe Rove as an American Svenghali who will stop at nothing to get his candidate elected. They provide compelling proof of the history of dirty tricks he has been involved in.

As a nerdy kid, Rove took an interest in republican politics at an early age. As a member of his high school's debating team he would bring stacks of index cards to intimidate his opponents, opponents who didn't know that many of the cards were blank.

In college, Rove broke into the office of a democratic candidate and stole his stationery. He printed up hundreds of copies saying that there would be free food and free beer at the opening of the candidate's new headquarters. He delivered the flyers across campus and skid row. Rove's character was taking shape.

But we really get to know Rove's chicanery and penchant for dirty tricks when he is directing the campaign of the republican candidate for governor of Texas in 1986. With the race at a dead heat, Rove ""discovers"" and announces finding a bugging device poorly concealed in his office, the day before the candidates' debate. Rove implies that it was planted by the opposition. As the Texas Rangers are closing in on the investigation, a republican judge closes the investigation, and Rove's candidate wins. It turns out the battery in the bug had a life of six hours, and the FBI had determined that only .2 of the battery's juice had been used--fifteen minutes. Was it planted by Karl Rove to make it look like it was from the opposition? The interviewees in this story answer with a decided yes.

Rove's other penchant was mastering the ""whisper campaigns"" against Governor Ann Richards and Senator John McCain. These whispers implied that Richards was lesbian, and McCain had a baby from a black prostitute, that McCain had turned in his fellow prisoners to his captors in Vietnam.

Bush announces that he has no knowledge of where these attacks against John McCain are coming from, and does not accept responsibility for them. The DVD makes it quite clear that Rove was running everything about the campaign. And the candidate who was going to bring personal responsibility to the White House, denied the same.

Senator McClellan a three-limbed amputee veteran of Vietnam was attacked as a man who opposed homeland security legislation and protrayed as soft on terrorism. He did oppose homeland security legislation, but only President Bush's plan.

But Rove's penchant for revenge was also chilling. When Ambassador Wilson's refuted the president's state of the union message about Saddam Hussein seeking uranium ""yellow cake"" from Niger, Valerie Plame was outed as a CIA agent in a column printed by Robert Novak. This exposure is ironic on several levels. One, it was President Bush (41) who signed into law making it a crime to expose a CIA agent. Two, Valerie Plame's job was to identify and prevent middle eastern countries from acquiring nuclear technology and weapons. Three, it was Karl Rove who was fired from the Reagan/Bush campaign for leaking sensitive information to--Robert Novak.

The DVD falters where it attempts to show that Karl Rove really does not care at all about the troops he helped send into Iraq. The focus here is on one married marine lieutenant's family who mourn his death in Iraq. This is a deliberate plug for sympathy and anger against Rove. Rove has certainly accomplished enough for a nation to be angry about without this story.

As for the reviews that see this DVD as an obvious slant against Rove, well, that's exactly what it was supposed to be. There is no reason to create a balance when you are trying to tilt that balance in your favor. Besides, if you have to show the good in Karl Rove, this DVD may have been impossible to make.

If prosecutor Fitzpatrick's investigation is able to get at the truth, Karl Rove, President Bush, and Vice President Cheney may have a lot to answer for.",1146960000,36,3988,4.851470588235294
2123455,3,B0002V7SMA,"As a fan of Karl Rove I loved this DVD as there was plenty of old video and other things I had not seen before.  The old TV interviews were great!  This was so obviously slanted by the two ""authors"" who have always been haters of Bush and Rove if you grew up reading their ""work"" or if you have heard them speak.  So with that out in th open, the entire video has to be taken with a grain of salt.

The best example of the blatant slant of this DVD was the man who's parents died and he felt the stress of Rove had done that to her.  Come on!  The military tilt was good and I'm glad Slater and Moore are such great patriots who care for our soldiers.  For every brave soldier who has died there is a similar great story about their life.  Let me know when Slater and Rove release the video of the families of the 3,000 innocent citizens who died on September 11, 2001.  I'd also like to see a ""work"" from Slater and Moore about Daniel Pearl and the countless others who have been brutally beheaded by our friends overseas.

I recommend the DVD to everyone.  I will be saving my copy and I will watch it every now and then to learn something new that I might be able to employ as a young operative myself.  My biggest problem with the DVD is that it wasn't longer.  There could have been a lot more detail about the 1994 and 1998 elections.",1143417600,,1340,4.088122605363985

2123460,5,B0002V7SMA,"I got a copy of BUSH'S BRAIN about a year ago, but have only now gotten around to watching it.  Partly this is because at a certain point, if one has followed the Bush White House very closely, one can become oversaturated by the unceasing depressing accounts of acts that offend conscience and sense of decency.  But the conjunction of someone else wanting to see it who had not and the impending possible announcement by Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald of indictments in following the investigation of White House leaks of the identity of an FBI Field agent  Virginia Plame (contrary to the film she was no longer a field agent, but the protocol is to not reveal the identity of a field agent for five years, because knowing her identity could aide other secret service agencies in figuring out who her fellow agents might be-the threat in this case was not to Plame but to her colleagues), wife of former Bush 41 ambassador Joseph Wilson.

If one has, like I have, read thirty or forty books on Bush or Republican policies in the past decade, this documentary, based on the book by the same name by James Moore and Wayne Slater, will contain little or nothing that is new.  If one has not followed the Bush White House closely, it can serve as a useful introduction to the man many people regard as the real president of the United States.  So complete is his control of activities in the White House that little is done or undertaken without his involvement.  It is not, I suggest, a mere coincidence that Bush's outrageous recent reaction to Hurricane Katrina--which hit the Gulf Coast on a Monday creating a breach in the levy on Tuesday, but of which he was largely unaware (despite a flyover in Air Fore One) until Friday morning, when he watched a DVD put together by aides of CNN and other telecasts-occurred when Rove was in bed and out of action with severe kidney stones.

I believe Karl Rove is emblematic of much of what is wrong with contemporary politics.  The ideal of political discourse and debate is two contenders for office putting forth their views and their reasons for holding such views.  It has degenerated to Karl Rove starting whispering campaigns that John McCain's dark-skinned daughter might be the result of an extramarital affair with a woman of color.  Even if Rove did not start those rumors, as is almost universally believed, it is inconceivable that he would denounce them.  Although this is not dealt with in the film, Rove had a myriad of connections with the absurd Swiftboat Veterans sliming of John Kerry.  All of this points to Rove's strategy:  forget serious political debate, just attack, attack, and attack.  In fact, the point of attacking is in part to mask real political positions.  For instance, one of Rove's fondest dreams is dismantling social security, a massively popular program.  The is a culture of deception and mislabeling rampant in Washington right now, especially in the GOP, and most intensely in the Bush White House.  How many administrations would label an initiative to gut Environmental clean air standards the ""Clear Skies Initiative""?  It is a culture that Rove has done more than anyone to foster.

Most of the documentary is focused on Rove career before his ascendance to the White House.  A large number of people who knew both Rove and Bush in Texas provide a great deal of insight into several incidents, including Rove's famous bugging of his own office and then absurdly accusing political opponents of doing it, the strategies employed in getting Rick Perry elected head of the Texas Agriculture Board, and the whispering campaigns against Ann Richards.

Of course, rarely in political history has anyone of Rove's ilk been able to get away with such nonsense forever.  His great mistake came in talking with members of the press about Valerie Plame.  When George W. Bush inexplicably named one of the most tenacious prosecutors in the United States to investigate the White House leak, Rove's fate was probably sealed.  His career as a top level GOP operative is probably close to an end.  But the kind of political trickery and misadventures that he espouses and practices are still very much part and parcel of the GOP political landscape.  Ironically, the man credited with starting this kind of slash and burn politics, Lee Atwater, after striving to overcome a brain tumor in the early 1990s, repented of this style of politics and cautioned everyone, both in his party and without, to return to a more genteel, issue-oriented style of politics.  It remains important, as long as there are Karl Roves polluting and obstructing the democratic process to know where they come from and how they operate.  So, seeing films like this or reading the books they are based upon will remain crucial for those concerned with the kind of popular democracy espoused by people like Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Teddy Roosevelt, and his cousin Franklin.",1130112000,18,4941,4.8697729988052565

Now I've established that, let's get down to the nitty gritty...

The documentary, ""Bush's Brain"" focuses on Karl Rove--some people say he's the man behind the White House throne. The film--based on the book co-authored by James Moore and Wayne Slater certainly adopts that position. Rove's career is examined from his high school days, and many people who've crossed paths with Rove add their perceptions of exactly how Rove wins campaigns. There are details here of Rove behind the scenes on the Clements vs. White Texas governor race. In this campaign, it looked as though White would win, when all of a sudden, a story hit the press that Karl Rove found a bugging device in his office. Never mind that the device had a 1/2 mile range, and a 6-hour battery life. Never mind that the bug had been in the wall ""for about 15 minutes."" Timing is all, and the media was swept along with the bugging story and the subsequent FBI investigation. Rove's candidate pulled a win.

The documentary also includes interviews with Mike Moeller, Pete McCrea, and Max Cleland--all people who crossed Rove's path and have opinions on how he pulls off a successful campaign. Apparently, the ""mark of a Rove campaign"" is a ""whisper campaign"" or ""parallel action"" involving implications of the general unworthiness of a political rival. It's certainly proved to be a solid tactic, and the documentary includes footage from the McCain bid in 2000.

But by far the most stunning story remains the ""outing"" of undercover CIA operative Valerie Plame whose husband, Joseph Wilson investigated suspected uranium sales to Iraq and came up with the conclusion that ... dear me ... the event did not happen. Exactly what is Rove's involvement in the treasonous betrayal of an undercover CIA operative? This is a story that should have made the headlines, but it hasn't. With the mainstream media effectively hijacked and or muzzled, we have to seek out the truth of these stories elsewhere. Just watch ""Bush's Brain"" and see what Joseph Wilson, Valerie Plame's husband has to say about this.

""Bush's Brain"" is a bit dry and slow, but there's a lot of information packed into 80 minutes. I don't understand how Moore can say what Rove was thinking when he met Bush (unless he kept some diary or told people--and both scenarios are unlikely). Anyway, watch the film and judge for yourself, and Karl, if you're reading this, no offence, but I don't think I want to play Monopoly with you ... after watching this film, I know you play to win--displacedhuman",1109289600,41,2799,4.7987551867219915
2123481,5,B0002V7SMA,"I thought this movie was really good. I wanted to know more about Karl Rove and basically this movie confirmed my general belief that he is a Scoundrel. I'm sure he may be a genius, a mad genius, willing to do what others are not. I think it seems this man enjoys crushing others, and the harder the better, to win at any cost. This man has a vision and he wants to change the world to fit his vision. Actually that is where I wish this documentary would have explored deeper, I wish I understood more percisely what ultimately Mr. Rove's plans for all of us are. The only mention of these goals of his were spoken seemingly in passing. The one that really stands out is Karl's belief that the ""elite"" should rule all those financially below them because it is an indication of the poorer classes' intellectual inferiority. KARL ROVE IS THE SCHEMING LYRICIST TO GEORGE W. BUSH'S INSANE SINGING CAREER.

Throw whatever dirt you want but at least try to make a descent film; or go back to the PF Chang's where you were waiting tables.

2123493,2,B0002V7SMA,"It basically covers the same material that was in the book, but obviously in a much shorter form.  The authors of the book provide interviews as well as other people from both sides of the political fence.  Some notable names are Max Cleland, whom speaks about the campaign tactics used against him in the 2002 mid-term elections, John Weaver whom speaks about the dirty tricks employed against John McCain in the 2000 South Carolina primary and Bush critique, Molly Ivins.

I think this film version does President Bush less credit than the book did.  In the book the authors point out that Rove crafts policy for the purpose of getting his candidate elected.  Furthermore, the authors state that Bush makes decisions based on the information his staff presents him.  If they are not presenting all of the facts than Mr. Bush doesn't make a very informed decision.  That may be dangerous but not necessarily a mark of stupidity.  The film doesn't even go into that much detail and just paints the relationship as more of a Wizard of OZ sort of thing with Rove behind the curtain and Bush just all show.

Lastly, there's a segment in the film about a young man who died 4 days into the Iraq War.  The point of this is to drive home the message that Rove's callous policymaking costs American lives and the Iraq War was nothing more than a marketing tool to win the 2002 and 2004 elections.  One could make that argument with sufficient proof but it was very out of place in this documentary and in my opinion, very unseemly.

2123495,3,B0002V7SMA,"Poor editing?  Difficult to follow?

This film is not the most extraordinary piece of filmmaking to appear, but the idea that it's a hack job or a excrutiatingly boring is to reveal your own desperate attempts to avoid some straightforward and disturbing claims that the film makes.  The film accomplishes what it sets out to quite well.  It portrays Karl Rove as a meglomaniac of frightening proportions.  So maybe you have reasons to disagree, but if you are going to question the veracity of the film, at least give us some reasonable evidence for doing so.  Comments like ""it's a bunch of lies"" reek of a fifth-grader's attempt at debate:  ""I don't want it to be true, so it's not"".

Let's take the case of the South Carolina primary in 2000.  McCain is posing a serious threat to Bush's chance at nomination until this key contest.  That's not so surprising since he's pro-choice and for campaign finance reform and is attracting tradtionally Democratic voters who are uninspired by the Gore candidacy.  Not only in the film but still available in newspaper reports of the time is the fact that McCain's sanity is questioned, and he is accused of fathering one of his children with a black prostitute (in fact he and his wife adopted a girl from Bangladesh).  Phone banks spread the word and flyers are left on the windshields of cars in church parking lots.  A man who avoided any significant service in Vietnam does not directly endorse, but never makes any significant effort to discredit the rumors.  Why?  Because winning at all costs, ethics be damned is the mantra of his chief adviser, Karl Rove.

What is revealing in the film is that key Republican opponents speak about the unrestrained truth-twisting that Mr. Rove has engaged in throughout his political career.  So the Republicans end up with a nominee who has been up to that point in his life a big nothing: a failure in business and a second-rate dilettante.  They pick him over a man who was a Vietnam war veteran and an experienced senator.  There is no getting around this.  No reasonable person could claim that Bush was the right choice over John McCain.  Unless of course the facts were skewed and the election toyed with.

In that South Carolina primary there were several reports that 21 districts never opened the polls.  Districts in minority-heavy areas that no doubt would have favored McCain.  McCain called for an investigation, but nothing came of it.  The accusations of widespread voter fraud don't even start here (they go all the way back to Rove's college days and his association with the GOP) according to the film, but claims that Florida was rigged in the subsequent presidential election and that the Ohio and Florida results of 2004 are suspicious are clearly not isolated incidents in the career of Karl Rove.  It is his modus operandi.  This serious and frightening trend of smear campaigning coupled with election manipulation, if true, and there is real evidence in both the film but more importantly in documented accounts of Rove's career that it is should not be swept under the carpet.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with the country choosing George W. Bush as president if he is chosen on his merits by a majority of voters.

When, however, there is the possibility that he became president through lies and fraud, Republicans, Democrats, and indeed all Americans should be appalled at a political process that has degenerated into an ultimate-fighting death-match, right or wrong be damned.  ""We can do anything we need to to win because ultimately we're fighting for what is right.""  I am both sickened and terrified that some people believe that this is the path we should be taking.

I am also confused as to why asking the questions has apparently become a crime in and of itself.",1101254400,15,3796,4.819165378670788
2123496,1,B0002V7SMA,"This ""documentary"" commits the grave sin of being excruciatingly boring. Unless you're a chronic Bush-hater, clinging to the last straw from the bottom of an empty barrel of innuendo, you'll need toothpicks to keep your eyes open.
Based on the book by James Moore and Wayne Slater, it is 80 incredibly long minutes of meaningless accusations, going back to the '70s, with badly edited interviews with a lot of very sore losers and their campaign managers. The obsessive Molly Ivins, who has made a career of Bush-bashing, goes on and on and on...with incomprehensible blather.

They spend a lot of time in a ""re-creation"" of Karl Rove typing a fax (back-view, with the hands of someone on the wrong side of 75), as Moore and Slater stretch the thinnest of information; Rove even gets blamed for being ""so smart"", being ""the best debater in school"", and ""a Republican"". If it wasn't so incredibly dull, this film could have been funny.

I remember seeing a bogus ""documentary"" with the preposterous claim that President Clinton had been mixed up with drug smuggling in the Mena, Arkansas airport and was implicated in the murder of two boys ""who knew too much"" during his tenure as governor; the same cinematic wizardry is used here, with fuzzy cinematography, papers held up that are hard to read, and interviews with people who are verbally challenged.

To fill out their ""plot"", they spend an inordinate time on the Chamblis-Cleland campaign of 2002 in Georgia, and Joe Wilson, whose 15 minutes of fame ran out last year. Quite unpleasant is the use of a young widow's grief at the loss of her husband in the Iraq war, when it was his choice, and he was proud to serve his country.
Save your money. This is pure dribble, unless you are in need of a late night soporific. The DVD ""extras"" will fill the bill perfectly for that, especially the ""Deleted Scenes"".",1100304000,11,1861,4.755417956656347
2123497,5,B0002V7SMA,"Okay, the election is over, but Bush is still the president; therefore, the material in this film remains relevant. I'm fairly neutral on the subject of whether this is a ""liberal hack job"" as some reviewers have called it, or a testament of truth about Bush and the Republican party. I watched this film in an effort to learn more about the political process, and was not disappointed.

The film errs in at least one way by underestimating bush's intellectual prowess. It reminded me of an anecdote of Henry Ford, where a news reporter called him ignorant. Ford sued for slander and supported his case by illustrating how he could answer any question the reporter posed by accessing the brains of a huge management team. Likewise, the presidency is no longer about one man, it is about the team he or she is able to organize and command. Bush has surrounded himself with experts and is not too proud to call upon them for advice, or to blame them for mistakes and errant comments. That said, the film's focus on Karl Rove demonstrates the danger of allowing lieutenants total control. According to the film, Rove is highly manipulative and perhaps deceptive. I'm hedging my comments here, as typical of the film medium, it is difficult to ask the producers follow up questions or to check statement presented as facts.

Overall, I would not recommend you approach this film for its entertainment value. It is a low budget production whose aim is strictly to inform the audience about the Bush campaign effort. Like I said earlier, while this story is obviously already pass, its lingering affects are still relevant. If for no other reason, I would recommend you watch this film to gain an appreciation of Republican campaign strategies. Rove's belief that ""the ends justify the means,"" is reminiscent of similar expressions of belief used by revolutionaries throughout history. That is the scary part about four more years. Watch the film and make up your own mind. It's a little less than 90 minutes long and won't take up too much of your time. Perhaps you can rent it, cheap.",1100217600,9,2080,4.79108635097493

I invite anyone who watches this film or reads the book to spend a little time investigating the facts...

2123499,3,B0002V7SMA,"This work is a collection of opinions that attempt to show that Karl Rove, senior political advisor to the Bush administration, is the real force behind Bush's success in both the governorship of Texas as well as the Presidency of the United States. The work is very loosely structured, and quite difficult to follow at some places, and towards the end adds material that is irrelevant to its central thesis. The evidence that the narrators present cannot be evaluated without knowing a considerable amount of historical background. These narrators are Republicans, which relaxes some of the potential concern with partisan politics on the part of a viewer genuinely interested in the campaign handlers behind Bush.

 Some of the manipulations supposedly engaged in by Rove happened when Rove assisted William Clements in his campaign for the Texas governorship, and involved Rove bugging his own office in order to blame it on the Democrats. This scam, if true, has an amusing quality to it, and not too shocking given the stunts pulled by other campaigns, both Democratic and Republican.

Rove is presented as someone who was the ""classic nerd"" in high school, in which he was also the best debater and one who had a ""sharp ability"" to attack people. Rove is also presented as one who believes ""he is always right"", and a man that is ""very smart and clever."" Rove worked closely with Lee Atwater, who was senior political operator for the Bush 1 campaign, and both are discussed in the work as being responsible for teaching republicans how to organize and also how to engage in ""dirty tricks.""

 Other examples of Rove manipulation include the campaign by Jim Hightower in Texas. The discussion of the Rove connection in this regard is quite difficult to follow in the work, but apparently resulted in two innocent people being sent to jail. Apparently Rove received a ""plug"" for putting these individuals, who were political opponents, in jail. The campaign of John McCain for the Presidency is also discussed, with primary emphasis on the South Carolina primary. Rove is blamed for the nastiness of this primary, such as initiating a rumor that McCain had a ""black love child"". Also, the more recent outing of the wife of Joseph Wilson as being a covert agent for the CIA is also discussed, and also blamed on Rove, who supposedly told a reporter that Wilson's wife was ""fair game.""

 Throughout the work Bush is portrayed as someone who is clueless as to how to win an election and needs the assistance of operatives like Rove to help him along. A good example of this is the campaign against Ann Richards for the Texas governorship. Rove needed to ""prepare him"" for the campaign by tutoring him as to the structure of Texas government. Bush was supposedly instructed to ""keep a narrow message"", which sounds plausible given the simplistic pronouncements emanating from Bush during his presidency.

 If Rove indeed were behind these operations and political manipulations it would be incorrect to characterize him as ""clever"" or ""smart"" in any sense of the term. This type of conduct is indicative of a weak intellect, of an individual that is completely unconfident in his abilities, and one whose abdomen is clearly yellow.

2123501,4,B0002V7SMA,"Karl Rove is a Republican strategist widely admired for his successful political campaigns and widely feared for his use of underhanded (some might say illegal) tactics.  He is certainly one of the primary architects of a more uncivil public discourse, in which winning is not only more important than the honest exchange of ideas or even individual citizens, but more important than our constitution.  This documentary is filled with reports of the dirty tricks used by Rove, a disciple of GOP henchman Lee Atwater.  Writing this review a week before the 2004 election, I am braced for what Mr. Rove and his cronies will pull before we all head to the polls.  I'm sure it will be a doozy.  Mr. Rove doesn't like to lose.  Mr. Rove is a scary heartless guy who has way more influence than he should, having never been elected to public office, and the inspiration for John DiLulio's (who resigned as BushCo's head of faith-based program) charge of ""Mayberry Macchievellis"" running the White House.  Undoubtedly working hard to bring integrity back to the Oval Office.

When the one that don't werk wel skrews up, the smart brain takes over and saves the day. You might even say the two brains kinda share the Presidency. In fact the smart brain even has a name. It's called Karl Rove and it has a title too. The brayn dat don't werk too good might say Karl's title is the brayn dat gets me lected know mattyr wat but I'm sure Karl would be more humble and say he is the the Bush National Reelection Campaign Chairman.

This video is about that other brain, who besides being smart and resourceful can also be mendacious and deceitful, and how it operates in relation to and viewed by Bush opponents.

Authors Wayne Slater and James Moore, both news men take us on a chronology of the Rove political history and the Bush connection.

Authors Wayne Slater and James Moore along with a cadre of commentators lay out a case of political intrigue and sabotage against Karl Rove, once a protege of the diabolical political consultant/hit man and dirty tricks guru of the last generation, Lee Atwater. They claim he learned well, as he is now the undisputed master of running a successful, if less than ethical, campaign. One might say Rove and Bush's credo is the end justifies the means.

And a dirty means it is. The Authors Wayne Slater and James Moore and others give commentary that, in their opinion, George Bush would and could, never have been elected President without Karl Rove. Along the way the co-Authors and the commentators lay a case that Karl Rove is a take no prisoners, winning is everything personality stating he laid waste to many opponents, calling him a junk yard dog and a master of dirty tricks, outlining several campaigns run by Rove where the same third party dirty tricks were used. This includes Bush's run for Governor against popular incumbent Ann Richard and his presidential primary run against John McCain, which is sometimes cited as the dirtiest campaign in the history of American democracy.

Conclusion

Yes it's dirty. Yes it's deceitful. And yes it stinks. Bush's Brain, a recent release obviously timed for the election, is yet one more indictment of the Bush Presidency, albeit from a new direction for the anti Bush faction to get up in arms about. It may be true, however, throughout the program ostensibly outlining Rove's underhanded behavior, there is no hard evidence, smoking gun if you will, only innuendo, coincidence and circumstantial evidence. One may know it's true but he can't prove it and if he can't prove it it's a non starter.

I think Bush detractors would be better off concentrating on other Bush weak spots such as his lack of character, inability to admit a mistake and the misadventure in Iraq",1098576000,20,2835,4.703629032258065

2123504,3,B0002V7SMA,"It's getting so in order to be an avid moviegoer one must keep up with politics. So far I have seen ""Fahrenheit 9\11"", ""Uncovered:The Whole Truth About The Iraq War"", ""The Hunting of the President"" (this one is about Bill Clinton), and now ""Bush's Brain"", for me the least effective of the political documentaries I've seen.

 One of the underlying messages in the film is that George W. Bush is an inexperienced, inarticulate man who has only gotten as far as he has thanks to the people around him who tend to be more experienced than himself, i.e. Dick Cheney, Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld, and the subject of this documentary, his political advisor Karl Rove.

 Now few Republicans and Democrats will agrue over that message. If you remember in 2000 people were pleased that Bush chose Cheney, why? Because they felt Cheney will be able to counter Bush's lack of experience. So as far as that goes we are all on the same boat. Well, at least I think we are.

 But this isn't the problem I had with ""Bush's Brain"". The problem lies in the subject matter. In all the documentaries I mentioned before they all dealth with national figures. People we feel we have come to know, Bush and Clinton. Karl Rove on the other hand is not in the public limelight. And do my reaction as I watched the opening moments of the film was, ""so what""?

 The beginning of the film deals with Rove's beginning. Show some questionable moves that happened during campaigns in which Rove was part of. The problem for me was I don't know who these people are. I'm not from Texas so my interest was limited. And Rove is not a public figure so you go into the movie with some caution because you don't know what to believe.

 Unlike ""Fahrenheit 9\11"" or ""Uncovered...ect"" the movie never supplies facts. I'm sorry for those who disagree, but, I did not find ""Fahrenheit"" to be a distoration of lies. ""Brain"" however does not come up with one piece of hard evidence against Rove.

 The best parts of the film are the ones featuring George Bush during the campaigns for Governor and President. Which is what I thought the whole film was going to be about.

 In those scenes we come to notice something about Bush and his favorite line of defense. He says this when he ran against Richards for Governor, McCain in the Republican primary, and to Kerry for President. Harsh comments are made towards his opponents to which he ALWAYS response 'I had nothing to do with it' despite him actually being in the same place when these remarks are made, the McCain issue for example.

 But a film like ""Bush's Brain"" is preaching to the coverted. Those who believe what the film has to say merely want to be what it has to say. Those who don't want to believe it; won't!

 But in the film's defense I would like to remind those of the words of Bob Dole in a response to the ""Swift boat"" ads (and I'm paraphrasing) ""there has to be some truth to it. They all can't be lying Democrats.""

 Bottom-line: Mixed-bag documentary that doesn't seem as hard hitting as some of the other political films we have seen this year. It is however one more film for those oppossed to this administration to see.",1098144000,23,3158,4.526408450704225
2123505,5,B0002V7SMA,"It is easy to throw out an opinion on an (admittedly) biased film version of why G. W. Bush is an idiot.  However, it is shocking to hear so many Republicans from Texas (Bush's home state) recount the numerous scams and atrocities that Karl Rove ""allegedly"" committed for the sake of a Republican majority.  Actually, the film makes more of a case for Karl Rove's desire just to be important...period.  Tracing back to his High School years of being a `nerd', he is portrayed as an exceptionally smart person entirely devoted to politics - at any cost.  That is the frightening assumption that is spread throughout this film.  It is less about Bush than it is about Karl Rove and he is an important man to hear about. He is the co-President, if you believe in this film.",1097884800,23,770,4.550724637681159
2123506,4,B0002V7SMA,"Apparently Machiavellian politics are alive and well and thriving in Bush's presidential campaign and at the heart of it is senior Bush advisor Karl Rove. This hastily produced and released documentary may have the earmarks of a hack job, but it is actually a fascinating look at the man behind Bush...not co-President Dick Cheney but the political advisor often called the other co-President. Maintaining a relatively low profile but on the pulse of everything essential in Bush's campaign, Rove is presented as the 21st century reincarnation of Shakespeare's Iago, advisor and supposed confidante to the title character of ""Othello"". The parallels are eerie but seem prescient. Both Shakespeare's play and this documentary focus on men who are concurrently political nightmare and strategic genius, using skullduggery and deceit to become all the more powerful. So ruthless is the portrayal of Rowe that he purportedly views the Iraq war as little more than a marketing device to improve Bush's approval ratings.

Because the focus is not on Bush himself, whom one can give too much credit for the current political malaise, this film seems more credible than Moore's treatise on the subject, ""Fahrenheit 9/11"". Based on a book by Texas journalists Wayne Slater and James Moore, who followed the 2000 presidential campaign, the documentary is compelling, amusing and at times, quite poignant. In particular, there is a brief sequence near the end where the filmmakers discuss the Iraq war through the story of Fred Pokorney. But this seems like a deviation from the film's point as this is not an examination of Iraq but a primer on what one man will do to ensure victory in November. Rove is credited with perfecting ""junkyard dog"" politics, where one attacks an opponent with everything possible via whisper campaigns. The tactics seem appalling and frightening, but the filmmakers do not take a completely unilateral stance in revealing them. They actually include readings from an actual Rove fax disputing all the ""facts"" presented, so you get a sense of his reaction to the claims made by the original book's authors. It doesn't make for a balanced perspective, but it does provide some sense of Rove's perception of his own behavior. Let's hope for Bush's sake that Rowe does not completely replicate the fate of Iago in the life of Othello - after all, Othello kills himself after realizing how his trust in Iago was misplaced.

These people are going to be electing a president? It makes one think that voting should be restricted only to certain people. But that wouldn't be a republic, so, never mind. Even fools get to vote in our society. Sadly.

All of the so-called evidence presented within this documentary is hearsay. Nobody can prove that Karl Rove was behind any of the more vile and despicable campaign tactics (although it's very interesting that Reagan-Bush fired him because of a breach), but when the so-called hearsay is so mountainous in form, and when even Republican political analysts acknowledge reverence that does not stop short at fear, I find myself convinced.

The Republican Party has long been spiraling downwards. They sold their souls to the religious right to secure the southern vote (remember, Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, and he would be dismayed to the point of revulsion at his parties current mission) and thereby place themselves in a position of power. Their campaign tactics have grown more and more vicious, so merciless in fact that they will even attack each other. What Bush's campaign did to John McCain is unforgivable and amoral. The only thing more unconscionable was that John McCain spoke out in favor of George Bush at the Republican Convention.

Bush's brain isn't just Karl Rove, although this documentary makes it clear that Rove has his ear more than anyone else. Bush's brain is comprised of Cheney, Rice and Rumsfeld as well. And, I'm certain, many others, although sadly not Powell, who seems to be the lone voice of sagacity in this administration. There's no question that Bush is not in possession of a superior intellect. So he relies on a ""melding"" of brains to create his own. Why isn't the entire country terrified that half of the country is supporting a man who can't think for himself? This is our president? A man who operates as a very poorly functioning marionette? I say poorly functioning because a marionette is supposed to deliver when they are left on stage ""by themselves"". Bush doesn't deliver; he can barely speak in coherent sentences. Is our country truly comprised of people with such poor judgment that they aren't able to see through the subterfuge and haze that Rove and Associates have woven, like a web from Shelob's lair?

If I were a religious and superstitious man, I would think that if Karl Rove's head was shaved bald, the numbers 666 might be found there. That was one of many prevailing thoughts when this documentary came to a close. The other was: Bush can not be reelected. We can not be submitted to four more years of treachery and evil. If Bush is truly looking for evil in this world (a concept I really don't believe in, but hey, he introduced it), he needs to look no further than his closest political advisors.",1097625600,18,2934,4.862

He lumps a film he has not seen nor researched into all the current Bush documentaries as being filled with lies and half-truths.

His films are incredibly sharp and funny and informative.  F911 was given to a third party fact checker prior to release... and except for maybe the issue of the Sept 13 Bin Laden flights the film is solidly factual, so be careful with your cavalier accusations if you want to retain any credibility.

8032631,4,B0002V7SMA,"""Bush's Brain"" is a eye-opening documentary made in 2004 based on the book by James C. Moore and Wayne Slater.  I had read the book, however,  the documentary gives a good overview of Rove's chilling political gamesmanship.  Rove is a sharp, smart combative personality, that likes power.  He was a master debater in high school and even then played mind games with his foes.  He was fast on his feet and got away with outrageous tricks at an early age.  As Rove grows into a young man, and establishes credibility, he becomes part of the Bush family in Texas.  He mentors, directs and grooms young ""W"" to succeed in the political arena.  Rove is not a subordinate, but almost single-handedly shaped policy in the White House based on politics.  He is the trusted manager of a never-ending Bush campaign. The movie focuses on Rove and does not get into what Bush knows or thinks about the dirty political tactics.

""Bush's Brain"" traces Rove's history of dirty tricks - including bugging his own office to boost his Republican client for governor (battery only had 10-hour life, was fresh when discovered, there was no evidence of a break-in, and Rove had shortly before seen a similar tactic used in a movie), working with an FBI henchman (later shown to have planted evidence in the Ruby Ridge murder trial) to pursue political enemies, having surrogates attack Gov. Anne Richards, Sen. John McCain, and Sen. John Kerry with vicious whisper campaigns (respectively - lesbian, fathering a black child and mentally unbalanced, and not the brave hero he appeared to be).

Another interesting incident involved Rove campaigning for Chair of the College Republicans. Through ""aggressive methods"" (challenging as many opponent electors as possible through the flimsiest of reasons), the election became a tie that was appealed to George Bush ('41) when he was Chair of the Republican Party. Bush chose Rove based on his anger at Rove's opponent's exposing Rove's teaching of dirty tricks, then later asked Rove to help '43. (Loyalty over all - doesn't say much for Bush '41 either.)

Finally, the documentary suggests that Rove supported a strategy of expanding the War on Terror to Iraq, as Osama was not being caught and Iraq would provide a more attractive conventional opportunity. The Democrats then ended up between a rock and a hard place, per Rove's machinations - pressure for the Iraq resolution was intense as the War on Terror had already been declared, and the situation was acerbated by Bush's claim that ""the greater the threat, the greater the risk of inaction"" - setting up a scenario where searching for facts was viewed as counterproductive. In addition, talk against Iraq would have looked silly if it had been known that North Korea already had the bomb - so the White House (Rove?) kept this information under wraps for 12 days until after passage of the Iraq resolution.

While Bush has retreated and kept quiet after leaving the White House, Rove is still spouting off on Fox News with political views and attacks.  He shows no remorse, and continues with feisty commentary.  You wonder if he is at the gate for another run at power.",1297814400,,3153,4.900375939849624

The problem with this film is the fact that Carl Rove is such a vindictive, win at all costs, kick 'em while they're down, who cares who it hurts kind of guy, that this film comes off as being biased or nasty when its really not, its just factual.

This said - in my opinion, - this film tries to cover way too much in too short of a time skipping way too many important facts in the process. Regardless of which side of the fence you are on, Bush and what makes Bush the way he is, is a very complex issue that simply cannot be covered in the 80 minute run time we have here, esp. if we try to throw in the added task of explaining what makes another complicated character tick. This is a good start, but expect to watch and read more to get a complete picture.",1201219200,2,1043,4.189054726368159

The interesting documentary film ""Bush's Brain"" adapted from the book of the same name by veteran Texas political journalists James C. Moore and Wayne Slater is interestingly divided up between those who clearly see through Karl Rove, the film's subject, and those who do not wish to do so.  Many in the latter category have become Rove enablers and sycophants of the most repellent variety.

After watching this revealing film I thought it advisable to look up the word genius in the dictionary to learn its actual definition.  According to the Random House and American Heritage editions genius is defined as a gift for creative and intellectual activity.  The psychological definition is also mentioned involving individuals who score above 140 on a standard IQ test.

Among the Rove admirers who equate his political activities with ""genius"" an early triumph was discussed extending back to Rove's early days in the College Republicans.  When popular Illinois Democrat Alan Dixon, who would eventually serve his state in the U.S. Senate, was holding a rally at his headquarters while running for statewide office early in his career, Rove borrowed a page from the dirty tricks playbook of his political idol Richard Nixon.

In an attempt to embarrass Dixon and other local Illinois Democrats, Rove emissaries visited a downtrodden section and passed out handbills to alcoholics and derelicts, inviting them to a party replete with free food and drink.  A group of the most unfortunate citizens of the community subsequently descended on Dixon headquarters and ruined the candidate's best-laid plans.

Did this Rove maneuver embody genius?  There can be no reasonable doubt that an Einstein creating a theory of relativity or a Beethoven writing a Ninth Symphony embodies genius.

Does it require genius to engage in what would by the gentlest definition constitute tasteless mischief?  Is rounding up the most tragic and downtrodden of a citizenry and using them cruelly as pawns, motivating them to descend on a political meeting in the expectation of free food and drink, in any way reflective of creative genius?

Other incidents abound in this revealing documentary about the checkered past of Rove.  When he sought to destroy the momentum of Mark White in his race for governor of Texas against Rove's candidate, Rove called the media to report an incident of a bugging of his office.  The only person with any motive to do so, according to Rove, was the White campaign.  The bug only carried a short distance and needed periodic battery restoration.  Savvy reporters like Glenn Smith were convinced that Rove, who had seemingly the only motivation to do so to alter the race's dynamics, had supervised the planting of the bug.

Rove has succeeded because he has had big bucks behind him and too many with the insight to expose him have remained silent.",1173484800,,3106,5.114851485148515
8032636,5,B0002V7SMA,"If you want to rent a true horror movie, watch Bush's Brain, based on the book by two Texan reporters.  Their assertion that Karl Rove is running the White House is frightening because apparently he's a brilliant but ruthless man that no one elected.

This DVD was released in 2004.  Much of the information is outdated.  Only brief allusions were made to the fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq whereas much attention was paid to the background of Karl Rove -- if even 1/10 of that is true, he is a man without a soul or a conscience and he's directing our domestic and foreign policy.

The big surprise is not so much how Bush and Rove pulled this scam off; the true surprise to me is how the electorate put these men in for a second term!  The first term was quite ""iffy.""  It could be argued that Bush was appointed by the Supreme Court because that race was so damn close, but all that really says is that the country was divided right down the middle in terms of partisan politics.

When we knew perfectly well that Bush revealed himself as a war president, why, oh why elect him for a second term?  Thankfully, he'll be ousted in 2008 but that's not soon enough for the dept that he's run up, the programs that he's destroyed, the American troops that he's sent needlessly to die or be maimed, and the horrific damage that he inflicted on the country and the people of Iraq.  And this is only January.  He's got lots of time to expand his reign.
