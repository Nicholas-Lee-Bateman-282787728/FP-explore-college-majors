3978402,5,B002SAJ6E6,"A mystery?  A thriller?  A character study? A romance?  Collision is all that and more.  It is a storyline that will intrigue and surprise while constantly making one think through the events  and trying to come to a probable conclusion.  Can you figure out, why the collision?  What's the connection?  This story is skillfully written and acted draws you in immediately and never lets you go.  It is typical British in many ways, but up-to-date with the feeling that it is right from the headlines.  This film is worth the time, energy and price and one that you will enjoy viewing many times.",1268611200,3,594,4.679611650485437
3978403,5,B002SAJ6E6,"This film was shown on PBS in two parts.  I was most anxious to see the second and final episode which aired the following week. I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  At times it was a little hard to follow because it jumps from before the 'collision' to after quite a lot. The ending was a little disappointing.  Still, having said that I would highly recommend this film.",1263081600,,368,4.462686567164179
3978404,5,B002SAJ6E6,"I agree with all the laudatory reviews of this show; it's a complex story, brilliantly told, with lots of twists and surprises.

Having said that, the production of the American DVD leaves a lot to be desired. PBS did a really crappy job.

First of all, this is neither a full-screen nor a wide-screen format, but some kind of bizarro reduced-screen; even using the reformatting capabilities of my tv, I was never able to get the image to fill my tv's screen. Weird.

Also, the DVD faithfully reproduces all the Masterpiece crud that PBS added to its presentation, including the introductions, the ""thanks to viewers like you"", and the interruption of the conclusion of the show from the credits. Whereas the original had a nice musical segue into the end titles, PBS interrupts that for a commercial for the DVD.

PBS did a real disservice to the show. Just to be clear I rate the show itself five stars; the DVD production ought to be one star, if that.",1261008000,59,955,4.633136094674557
3978405,5,B002SAJ6E6,"""Collision,"" an excellent British mystery/police procedural television series, was made by ITV, for its independent television stations.  It is to be released as a DVD by Public Broadcasting Systems Direct after its recent debut on PBS stations.  It consists of approximately 210 minutes, and comes bearing welcome subtitles.  It concerns a Friday 5:57 PM rush hour, six-car collision on Great Britain's busy A12 near Chelmsford, Essex, in the vicinity of London,  that has left two dead on the scene and two critically wounded, with further deaths to come.

And it's quite unusual for a British mystery, in that the mystery to be investigated will be this major automotive crash, on which  Detective Inspector John Tolin (Douglas Henshall --<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twice-Upon-a-Yesterday/dp/B00000K13X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twice Upon a Yesterday</a>) will be assigned, after a lengthy leave of absence, to work with his former lover, Senior Investigating Officer Ann Stallwood (Kate Ashfield --<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B0006A9FKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>).  It has a large cast, is complex and suspenseful, and, furthermore, is consistently intellectually challenging, relying on none of the lazy plotting you might see in a similarly-themed American TV production.  It has also been well filmed, on location, with the typical first-class British production values, and mise en scene, with no stinting on cast, supporting characters, extras, cars, or interiors.

It appears that a quiet, little-known piano teacher, Sidney Norris (David Bamber) initially loses control of his car.  Thereafter, personal assistant (P.A.). Karen Donnelly (Claire Rushbrook), on a secretive errand, smashes into him. Next up, Daniel Rampton (Dean Lennox Kelly)in a van bringing furniture from the Netherlands, runs into them and jumps the median.  Whereupon Rampton is hit by a handsome young black couple in a silver BMW, speeding en route to the woman's 23rd birthday party, with a police car in hot pursuit. Then Brian Edwards (Phil Davis), who is driving his difficult mother-in-law (Sylvia Syms --<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Born-to-Win/dp/B000NOK0L2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Born to Win</a>) in his SUV, on another somewhat shadowy errand, runs into them, as does wealthy executive Richard Reeves (Paul McGann), in his chauffeur-driven limousine.  Finally, after the police arrive on the scene, Rampton flees it.

You would think this production must bear some relation to the 2007 American Oscar Winner&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash/dp/B000A3XY5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash </a>.  But, aside from the fact that both center on fatal, multi-car crashes near major cities - ""Crash"" is set near Los Angeles--the resemblance is surprisingly little.  Perhaps most obviously, while many of the large British cast come bearing familiar faces, the British TV production boasts no real stars, whereas the large cast of the American theatrical movie ""Crash"" is star-laden.  The largest difference, however, must be in the reputed preachy, clich-ridden nature of Paul Haggis's American film, which I have avoided seeing, versus the many-layered, cool intellectual risk-taking of the British series, as created by that brilliant scriptwriter Anthony Horowitz (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Foyle-s-War-Series-1-5-From-Dunkirk-to-VE-Day/dp/B0024OW1QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Foyle's War: Series 1-5 - From Dunkirk to VE-Day</a>).",1260057600,5,3689,6.622406639004149
3978406,5,B002SAJ6E6,"This British police drama, written and created by Anthony Horowitz, is a superb example of the best of British television drama. Well acted, directed and filmed - we take those things for granted. But the story itself, and its realization, give us more than just another police drama. Centered around a horrific multi-car pile-up on the A12 outside Chelmsford, we see the building up of a picture of several lives, including character, relationships, politics, and intrigue. Even though the scene jumps between locations, people and points in time at an almost alarming rate, it doesn't become too confusing to stay on top of. Rather this increases the tension, making it a spell-binding watch. (It was originally shown over 5 nights in Britain - this would have driven me crazy - I watched it first on PBS in 2 episodes).

Most intriguing of all for me is that this is in some way an essay in complexity, and in particular the idea that the tiniest, most insignificant action in the midst of a highly complex system (humanity in this case) can have huge, unintended and completely unpredictable consequences. For lovers of complexity theory this is a version of the butterfly and the typhoon - in this case initiated by ... well you'll just have to watch the program to find out.

It is a long time since I've enjoyed a television drama this much!",1259884800,38,1348,4.781115879828326
3978407,4,B002SAJ6E6,"""Collision"" is a departure from the typical crime film in that the detectives are auto accident investigators, not homicide detectives. Their job is to explain what happened in a 6-vechicle accident on England's A12 freeway that left 5 people dead. If they find any wrongdoing, the cases are turned over to the appropriate departments of the police force. The first senior officer on the scene of the accident that May afternoon is Ann Stallwood (Kate Ashfield). She and her former flame DI John Tolin (Douglas Henshall) work together uneasily to put the pieces of the smash-up together. This turns out to be a lot more intricate and entertaining than I expected.

A mild-mannered piano teacher named Sidney Norris (David Bamber) lost control of his car, causing a car driven on a clandestine errand by Karen Donnelly (Claire Rushbrook) to smash into him. A van bringing furniture from the Netherlands, driven by Daniel Rampton (Dean Lennox Kelly), runs into them and is catapulted over the median, where it is hit by a BMW carrying a young couple en route to the woman's 23rd birthday party, with a police car in pursuit. Then Brian Edwards (Phil Davis), driving his complaining mother-in-law, runs into them, as do wealthy executive Richard Reeves (Paul McGann) and his driver. Then Daniel disappears after the police arrive on the scene.

It's all quite contrived, as the accident is connected to no fewer than 4 crimes. That's a high crimes-per-vehicle ratio, but none of the crimes seem implausible in themselves. Reactions seem realistic. It's not just a bunch of melodramatic backstories. The script by Anthony Horowitz and Michael A. Walker is packed with intrigue but down-to-earth at the same time. Director Marc Evans has the film jumping around in time a lot, starting after the accident and then going back weeks, days, hours, but not in that order. It can be a little confusing, but more is revealed about the accident with every jump. ""Collision"" is equally dependent upon its structure and character writing to maintain interest, and both are quite competent.",1259107200,86,2075,5.02906976744186
3978408,4,B002SAJ6E6,"Originally shown on BBC TV in the Masterpiece Contemporary series, this elaborate police drama combines intrigue, romance, and international crime. When a multi-vehicle collision occurs on a dual-lane highway just outside of London, two experienced police officers (Henshall & Ashfield) are assigned to find out the cause of the accident and identify the victims involved.

Although it quickly becomes obvious that the 2 officers had been involved romantically in the past, they manage to work collaboratively on the investigation.  The circumstances of their past relationship gradually unfolds as a separate subplot that adds to the intrigue of the overall investigation.

While the ""spotlight"" focuses on Henshall & Ashfield as they piece together evidence from the crash site and pursue leads that emerge from their investigation, the various victims of the highway pile-up have intriguing stories of their own.  Their stories intensify the overall suspenseful plot, and, through a series of flashbacks, the viewer discovers more & more abt each person's life & circumstances.

Highly recommended.",1259020800,15,1101,5.648484848484848
3978409,4,B002SAJ6E6,"I have only seen the first half so far, but like the best of Anthony Horowitz's other scripts the characters are memorable and seem very realistic.  Anyone who has watched much UK telly over the past decade will likely recognize almost every actor in a major role here.  It is a fine production all around.
Though I wasn't very taken with the flashback style structure during the first part, I  get the hang of it by the time the ""event"" was shown.
This drama was intended to be shown in 5 parts over 5 nights, as it was shown in the UK (though it's premier airing was in 2 parts in Australia.)  I am curious to know how it will be presented on this PBS disc.",1258416000,5,659,4.2063492063492065
3978413,5,B002SAJ6E6,"Masterpiece Contemporary: Collision is a 2009 PBS television mini-series, which represents a combination of a murder mystery and a family drama. Its story line centers around a devastating multi-vehicle crash on the A12 Highway outside of London, England, which resulted in several fatalities and multiple severe injuries. The drivers and the passengers of each of the vehicles involved in this massive collision had never previously interacted with each other, but their lives begin to intertwine as a result of the facts uncovered by the investigation into the cause of the tragic crash. This investigation produces stunning revelations regarding government cover-ups, human smuggling, embezzlement, and even murder. The numerous flashbacks significantly contribute to the development of the back stories that provide clarity about the reason for each vehicle being on the A12 Highway at exactly the same time on the Friday afternoon of the crash. Masterpiece Contemporary: Collision is characterized by brilliant writing, clever plot twists, excellent development of the overall story line, and superb acting performances, especially by the lead actors, Douglas Henshall and Kate Ashfield. Masterpiece Contemporary: Collision is an outstanding PBS mini-series, which is intelligent, gripping, and suspenseful, and which merits a strong five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1500076800,2,1399,5.930693069306931

""A split second that changes everything."" - host, David Tennant

Five RIVETING Stars! This Masterpiece Contemporary film, ""Collision"", is a long, but very interesting 3 hour plus film which is divided into two parts. It details the people and the factors that were involved in a fictional Friday evening multi-car pileup at 5:57 PM on the A12 route that leads into and from London, England.

The 2009 British film begins after the accident when the lead investigator, Detective Inspector John Tolin starts going through the files, after being warned the government might have been involved and legally liable. As he proceeds, he places the names of the survivors and deceased on a blank white board. Generally as each picture is revealed, the film follows the victims as they go about their day leading up to the tragedy and what they intended to do if the accident had not occurred: 2 unrelated secretive meetings, an opening speech, a leisurely drive, a family dinner, the mysterious ""Home 2 Bed"" panel truck driver, and so on. And when the accident happens, it is truly quick and awful, on both sides of the median. Then a lawsuit is quickly threatened. The most interesting part begins when the relentless Tolin investigates the occupants of  each vehicle involved and finds in some cases there is less innocence than first suspected. Indeed, Tolin has his own problems, even with his female partner which is tracked throughout the film. While very long, it is often riveting material that unfolds long after the accident, as the truth about the participants is revealed. The thoughtful and unexpected ending is very well done. Starring Douglas Henshall, Kate Ashfield, Dean Lennox Kel, Phillip Davis, Sylvia Syms, Paul Mcgann, Lucy Griffiths, Claire Rushbrook, et al. Created by Anthony Horowitz. Directed by Marc Evans.

Never having been a person who wants to view the suffering of others involved in large or small traffic accidents, I find this serious investigation of the situation very intriguing and always a warning for any driver.

Although in this story, the backstories are all weighted to some level of potential or real illegal activity, the actors raise the bar in gaining my interest.

If you skip Masterpiece productions because they are too slow moving, you should see this one.  Even at over three hours, it's tight and moves at a fair pace.

This is one movie that has two streaming flaws on Amazon:  First, fast forward does not show the frames.  It would be a spoiler to tell you why you might want this.  You'll see way at the end.

Transitions between present time and flashbacks were somewhat hard to follow. I found I had to rewind in several places to really pick up on what just happened - possibly that's me, but it might as easily be the editing. Put aside 2 nights to watch (that's how Masterpiece aired it). A very satisfying set of interlocking puzzles where human nature and desires are the pieces.",1449964800,,509,4.604395604395604

It is worth the time to watch if you enjoy seeing how random incidents connect together.  A summary: it is a story of an accident on a major highway with deaths and injuries.  Each car has a story.  Each story has a pre-accident and after-accident impact.  If you don't like stories that jump around, you may not like this.  However, it is organized and easy to follow when you go from one story to another during the investigation.  And the relationships involved in those investigating the accident.  Many surprises that you have to keep your eyes open to be prepared.

The twists & turns of the story kept our interest. When the 1st ""episode"" ended, frustration!! until  a check was done to see there was still more to play & yes thank goodness there was!

3979183,5,B002SAJ6E6,"It was a well thought out plot and good acting. What started out as an extreme accident turned out into something very different. The looks of the actors were very ordinary which allowed their acting to come to the fore not their good looks and squeaky clean lives. They are real people, well as real as actors can be. There is an attempt to be real which is missing from the wham bam special effects of so many Bollywood classics. Are we hear to be entertained or just mildly amused? Are we here to use what we were given, a brain or descend into the morass of mediocrity. People watch TV for different reasons I don't dispute that.

But having accidentally deleted a raft of DVR recordings where it had been stored---I couldn't begin to remember its name or the year. Lo' and behold,in a search for Season 3 of ""Endeavor"", (not yet out,) there arrived those available DVD's, a Masterpiece Contemporary, "" Collision"". Reading the description I rejoiced it was found! As a drama/mystery it is intelligent, complex, deftly plotted; the concerns are of contemporary issues and the whole is carried by strong, interesting main characters and equally flawless performances by more 'minor' characters. I don't believe it would disappoint anyone who enjoys drama, and the drama of watching a mystery, NOT soaked in gruesome violence or blood, unravel.

3979360,4,B002SAJ6E6,"I didn't watch the PBS version of this mini-series, so I can't speak to what they did to the DVD production as others have commented.  I enjoyed the show overall.  I alrerady knew and liked a few of the actors, and I cared about the main characters, especially D.I. Tolin's daughter.  Her performance was not complex or stunning, but she made for a very appealing character and the chemistry between father and daughter was gentle and mostly realistic.  The bumpy relationship between Tolin and Officer Ann as they reunite to investigate a complicated car crash is.slow to develop, which only helps make it more realistic.

I am not a big fan of flashbacks, but this plot genuinely calls for them and they do a pretty good job piecing the story together and adding tension.  I will say I thought the idea that all of the participants in the crash having complicated back stories was  tad unbelievable, but we must cut them some slack as the story is aiming for a complex multiple plot. The same goes for a few coincidences we encounter, such as during a couple of those magical detective moments when they see something in another context that leads to a revelation in their case.  Perhaps because I write fiction and avoid too many coincidences in my writing, it makes me sensitive to them.  In any case, those moments didn't detract from my enjoyment of the show.  The series wasn't good enough to make me want to watch it again to see if I notice more details, but I still recommend it.",1442707200,,1489,4.606060606060606

3979366,5,B002SAJ6E6,"ITV produced this superb, multipart drama in 2009; the surprises as people's lives are explored hold one's interest throughout.  The excellent cast led by Douglas Henshall (Shetland) includes Phil Davis (Silk and the new Poldark) and Paul McGann (Withnail & I, Doctor Who.)  Although I support PBS and appreciate their efforts to bring quality British TV to the American masses, I echo all of the negative comments about PBS dvds.  They condensed this series into two approximately 90 minute Masterpiece Contemporary episodes and included their usual interruptions, introductions (by David Tennant,)  and omission of full credits.  Again, I like PBS but not their dvds; at least this one had a 'play all' feature.  And, this appears to be the only option to see this very enjoyable show.",1438214400,,787,5.15748031496063

to what at first appeared to be erratically different time periods prior to the main event  - the eight car highway
collision - and the numerous stories surrounding all of the parties involved, I still found it relatively easy to follow.
I also was surprised by what proved to be the initial cause of the accident even though I had to admit that there were
numerous clues fairly presented throughout the entire movie. Finally, I thought that the way the movie dealt with the
various issues raised among the various parties was very thought provoking and timely to courrent real life issues.",1428019200,,938,4.85625

3979644,5,B002SAJ6E6,"This is a smart and intelligent mystery. John Tolin is a police detective (Douglas Henshall) who is asked to investigate a pileup on a highway (A12) outside London. Three people are killed and Tolin reviews the evidence to find out what caused the crash. He ends up probing into the lives of ten people caught up in the accident. What starts as a straight forward car accident quickly turns into a story full of twists and turns as the police start to dig. Tolin unravels a number of mysteries which involve murder, smuggling, whistle blowing and a government cover-up. There are another couple of deaths after the accident.

The characters are ordinary people with complicated lives and the acting is excellent. Douglas Henshall who plays a scientist on ""Primeval"" is playing a policeman with personal problems. He's tough, tenacious, and flawed. Also examining the crash is Ann Stallwood (Kate Ashfield) who seems to be a former lover. She was also the love interest in Shaun of the Dead.

The cast is full of experienced and recognizable British character actors who have appeared in numerous films and shows like Chariots of Fire (Nicholas Farrell), Vera Drake (Philip Davis), Valkyrie (David Bamber), Robin Hood (Lucy Griffiths) and Hornblower (Paul McGann). I fondly remembered Jan Francis from 1970s shows like Secret Army and Just Good Friends.

Collision grabs your attention and is very enjoyable. However there were a few loose ends which I felt were not satisfactorily tied up. Overall, I would recommend this series.",1426809600,,1529,5.059523809523809

Seven vehicles are involved in a major collision on the A12 outside of London, with fatalities and critical injuries.  What happened, who/what was responsible, and why?  What I thought might be an interesting movie/documentary turned out to be one of the best suspense films I've seen.

There are many movies out there where one incident brings a number of unrelated people into focus, with interesting results as the facts and motivations of each person are revealed.  ""Collision"" does that, but to the nth degree.

This is topnotch Masterpiece, with well-developed characters, good actors and a great story, but the real fun is the ""gasp"" of surprise as each piece of evidence and detail comes to light -- leading up to, during, and well after, the ""Collision.""

It is quite long, over 3 hours, so I watched it over two nights just as it was aired on PBS.  It's hard to review it without giving much away, but this is well-written with unique twists that any suspense lover will enjoy.",1416441600,,1067,4.72972972972973

I dropped the rating down to 4 stars because there was no 'closed captioning'.  Like several other British imports, there is no CC, making the dialogue difficult to understand.  I have to 'lip read' a lot, but even that is difficult.  Can't they put CC on these shows???

The detective himself has a story himself that is slowly revealed as he works with his partner, a former lover of his who is part of his tangled family situaiton.

3980184,5,B002SAJ6E6,"This tapestry of interconnected details takes some attention and patience to let it get going, but is worth holding on. Because of the immense detail, it is not really so easy to watch while multitasking (doing homework, paperwork, etc.,) but it can be done.

This feature shows, through dramatization, the complexity of interdependent relations for any once-instantiated event.

In case you are not a philosopher, I will spell out one item that you might miss: the intense, relentless desire of one human to avert or kill a wasp, ends up as a key factor in a cascade of events leading to multiple deaths.

But these, while in some cases sinister, are presented as never outside the realm of ordinary possibility in the ordinary mundane lives of people of all walks of life.

Also, the acting is really fantastic, throughout, with a few A-list actors featuring. There is no poor acting in this, which is surely why PBS sells (or used to sell) the DVD for $25!

Buddhists and people from dharma traditions, secular humanists, etc. who appreciate interconnectedness of phenomena will especially not be dissappointed with this drama.

But it does take some attention and endurance to follow it all. Yet it is well worth it. You can't say that about too many other tv productions!",1366416000,,1276,4.8842592592592595

3980188,4,B002SAJ6E6,"I enjoyed Foyle's War so I went looking for other things that Anthony Horowitz had written.  I was not disappointed.  Collision has all the markings of his earlier writing in Foyle's War.  In Collision the plot lines are cleverly interweaved.  The scrambling of the time line is a bit confusing and the precision of the early reconstruction of the accident is hard to credit, but everything else is well done.  It is easy to recognize and identify most of the characters - both the pleasant and unpleasant ones.  The romance between the tycoon and the waitress is especially poignant.
I am not sure I could have enjoyed it quite as much if it had been spread out over multiple episodes.  It would have made it much harder to follow and would have detracted from the overall story. The plot lines were difficult enough to follow in one sitting.",1362268800,,843,4.655405405405405

And many of the cars' occupants have secrets to hide.  Like the chaos theory regarding the flap of butterfly wings causing a tsunami on the other side of the globe, this film shows what is set in place by a seemingly freak accident.  Or is it?  Is there something more malevolent at the heart of it?

3980204,3,B002SAJ6E6,"I cannot figure out why a remarkably well produced drama/mystery is allowed this horrible fate! Bottom line - watch this show on PBS but DO NOT buy the DVD b/c it is perhaps formatted in the worst way possible. For $24.99 on amazon it is expensive for the VERY CRAPPY DVD transfer. Just to clarify - excellent drama (5 stars) and I caught the last bit of episode 1 on TV (PBS) - looked great - not hi-res but just fine to view - crisp, clear images/ filming. I ran out to our local DVD rental place, rather than buying it on Amazon and discovered, to my horror (and relief that I had not bought it), they had used a not too bright individual to create the DVD. Instead of worrying about censoring the word ***k I think time and money would have been better spent getting the transfer to DVD right.
Aside from the censoring that goes along with the DVD, which I think is flat out stupid I am hard pressed to believe this is a 2009 production that was transferred to DVD. When watching on a Hi-def screen played through an HDMI connection it shows up like  a ~32"" picture surrounded by black borders. So, I think what happened is they decided to down res the PAL (UK format) to NTSC and then for whatever reason a blu-ray player upreses it in the truly bizarre format. I simply cannot recommend buying or watching THE DVD VERSION despite being a brilliantly written and filmed production. A real shame! Get the original version from amazon.uk else see it on TV where PBS for whatever reason has the format right.",1301702400,4,1510,4.392857142857143
3980205,5,B002SAJ6E6,"As I began watching the first of the five episodes, I did't think much of this series.  I even thought it a bit on the slow side. However, that is more the UK point of view, very understated.  What this serves to do is to make it all the more horrifying as we are drawn into a horrific multi auto collision on a UK ""interstate"" highway.  You are almost jolted out of your seat with the collision impacts intruding into the quiet buildup.

The lead detective is also deceptively quiet.  He too seems very bland until his entire demeanor can shift in an eyeblink.  When he becomes passionate about something or someone, his entire physical being shifts from bland and unnoticeable to arresting and attractive.  His blue eyes truly do blaze!

What must be done in this case is to trace every aspect of the collision, including every person.  The police department is sued by one of the decedent's fathers so it is especially crucial to get it right.  Much to my surprise, I learned that the police had bagged everything on the ground for a considerable perimeter around the collision and to solve just one aspect of the case we see our detective in a room filled with baggies looking for anything incriminating.  It is the necessary, tedious part of investigative work.  He does indeed solve one of the cases by going through the baggie room.

I highly recommend this series.  It is excellent.

Everything about it is Extremely HQ from the Out door Scenes,  The Crash/Accident is very close to real

Kate Ashfield is also Perfectly Cast even though the Front of the Cover doesn't do her justice at all (She's very Beautiful and can act much better then most of the A List ""Hot Chick"" American Actress.

I do wonder if Henshall has some sort of contractual stipulation that all his characters have dead wives....it's true in this, ""Shetland,"" & ""Primeval"" (well, technically she's not really dead in ""Primeval"" but he thinks she is).
