8258546,4,B0015HZA7A,"Punk Love is one of those kinds of movies that leave you feeling you need a shower because it deals with drug junkies living it utter squalor.  I think this movie would be best watched by traditional values teens with two things in mind.  First, this is the type of life taking drugs inevitably leads to, so avoiding drugs would do one well.  But, the second issue that families might discuss is the unfairness of life.  Sarah was once just as innocent and precious a baby as any born into any family.  But, Sarah didn't find love in her family; she found parents who were too overwhelmed by their own problems to give Sarah the attention she needed.  Then, the stepdad forced himself sexually on her, obviously for some time.  The question to discuss is what we, as loving people, can do to help kids such as Sarah.  In the end, all she really wanted and needed was love, not drugs to numb the pain.

As in any honest film dealing with drug addiction, there is a lot of bad language (especially the ""F"" word), smoking, drug use, and nudity.",1231632000,2,1041,4.436842105263158
