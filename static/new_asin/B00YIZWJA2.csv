8718371,3,B00YIZWJA2,"First of all, Oldies.com (Alpha) did a great job with the cover art on this DVD. I don't know what the original 1929 movie poster looked like, and maybe this is a replica, but it certainly looks authentic for 1920s art. Once you get past the artwork and to the DVD, though, the quality lessens. The opening credits are ruined because Alpha video chose to put their logo on the credits, not in the lower corner, but ON THE CREDITS, just below the center of the screen, blocking any words that appear center screen. Fortunately, the annoying logo disappears as the movie begins, but putting their name center screen ON TOP OF THE CREDITS says to me that Alpha is not concerned with preserving great cinema, but only SELLING great cinema and promoting themselves in the process.

The transfer is not great. No restoration has been done of course, and to give the benefit of the doubt, maybe this is the best surviving print of the film. Who knows? The picture is anything but sharp, and the contrast is raised very high to compensate---the blacks are very black so that you can't make out any details there at all. The sound is adequate, but the volume must be turned up, and a few instances occur when the actors speak their lines so quickly that it's not possible to discern the words. A very loud hissing/hum so prevalent in unrestored films is very apparent and is no help, either. A little over halfway through the film, the picture gets ""bubbly."" It's as if the original film has warped from being near high heat. This continues for a long time.

As for the film production, Gloria Swanson earned her second Academy Award nomination for her first talkie, this soap opera of a young woman who elopes and then has her honeymoon broken up by the groom's father, a wealthy snob who thinks his name is too good for his son to give it to a nobody stenographer. She leaves; the marriage is annulled; the son later remarries into his social class; and Gloria has a baby resulting from the one-night honeymoon. The groom didn't know about the baby, of course, and Gloria struggles as a single parent to raise the child. That's the premise, and the movie, even though anchored in the ""staginess"" that was film in the late 20s and early 30s, is not bad. The story is believable and Swanson does a great job of acting---for an early talkie, that is.",1532476800,,2340,4.555819477434679
