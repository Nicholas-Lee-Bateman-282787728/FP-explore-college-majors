300111,2,6300269299,"Review of Ocean's 11
Hot Toasty Rag, September 14, 2017

If youve already seen the remake, youll probably fall asleep while watching the original 1960 Oceans 11. Gone are the quick cuts, dizzying camera angles, and snappy incidental music. I didn't like the remake, despite the extras. The egos radiating off the screen were just too much for me. It was practically grotesque, how everyone seemed to say, Look at me! Im remaking Oceans 11! And considering the amount of ego present in the original, for the remake to top it is quite remarkable.

The first fifty-five minutes of the film is one gigantic set-up. All the characters are introduced and developed, and its made abundantly clear that everyone is waiting around for a big plan to be revealed. Frank Sinatra has trouble with his wife, Angie Dickinson, and his mistress, Patrice Wymore, Peter Lawford has to adjust to his new step-father Cesar Romero, Richard Conte has just gotten out of jail and wants to reconnect with his young son; the list continues. If the first half was merely character development, it wouldnt have been so boring, but the endless, When are we going to talk about that thing? got very old very fast. After fifty-five minutes, we learn that the big plan is to rob five Las Vegas casinos in one night.

This is a Rat Pack classic, with the gang in their natural Las Vegas habitat. Shirley MacLaine makes a silly cameo, and it feels like she just happened to be in the neighborhood and wanted to hang out with the guys. If you want to sit through a slightly boring heist movie, go ahead. But I prefer a little more excitement out of my Frank Sinatra movies, like The Man with the Golden Arm or Suddenly.",1505347200,,1684,4.625418060200669

All that for nothing because they burned their winnings with the cremation of their friend. Irrelevant but I hated the music and it contributed to the superficial atmosphere of Las Vegas gambling and the acting. It took about an hour to get to the action. Saddest thing about it was the guy who died was doing the job for his son whom he never sees. He chose to sacrifice his remaining time on earth getting money for his kid instead of spending time with him THEN dies leaving the kid with absolutely nothing. I am a sucker for happy endings.

Martin giving us a glimpse of his night club act is a treat. You don't see Frank Sinatra said singing in this movie so don't expect it.

300384,4,6300269299,"Inspired by ""idea man"" Spyros Acebos (Akim Tamiroff), gambler Danny Ocean (Frank Sinatra) has come up with the perfect heist: knock out the electricity on the Vegas strip at midnight on New Year's Eve and simultaneously hold up five casinos before the power comes back on.  To help in the job, he recruits 10 of his old buddies from the 82nd Airborne--Sam Harmon (Dean Martin), fresh from Hawaii; Josh Howard (Sammy Davis, Jr.), a would-have-been baseball player turned sanitation worker after the loss of an eye; former lieutenant Jimmy Foster (Peter Lawford), whose wealthy mother (Ilka Chase) has just gotten engaged (it'll be her sixth marriage) to somewhat dubious financier Duke Santos (Cesar Romero); Tony Bergdorf (Richard Conte), who's just out of prison with a terminal condition and determined to leave his ex-wife and small son a financial cushion; ""Mushy"" O'Connor (Joey Bishop), Roger Corneal (Henry Silva), Pete Rheimer (Norman Fell), Curly Steffans (Richard Benedict), Vince Massler (Buddy Lester), and cowboy Louis Jackson (Clem Harvey).  Their great advantage, as Danny points out, is that except for Tony, none of them has any criminal history or connections--and in Vegas, if you're spotted as a con, out you go.  That's why Acebos, who has a record, recruited them.  And Danny has a plan; it will require split-second timing, but if they can pull it off, even giving Acebos his cut, they'll all be rich enough ""to buy [Tony's son] his own college!""  Sam hesitates at first, unsure that after 15 years they're still the men they used to be, but he also wants to help Danny and his ex, Bea (Angie Dickinson), get back together, and figures that if Danny finally makes one big score, he'll be ready to settle down.  And, somewhat to everyone's surprise, the plan goes off like clockwork.  But then the thefts are discovered, Santos finds out that Danny and all his buddies are in town, and everything starts to fall apart.

Having seen the George Clooney remake, I have to say that I think this one is much better, even without any noticeable high tech; everything turns on the men themselves, their skills, their interaction with each other and the various outsiders they encounter (including an uncredited Shirley MacLaine, who was the only female member of the Sinatra/Martin/Davis/Bishop/Lawford Rat Pack, and comic Red Skelton playing himself), and that old deluder, Chance.  The movie's a bit slow getting started, since we have to be introduced to a large cast, and Danny and Jimmy have to assemble their company, but once that's done the pace and suspense hold up till the very last moment, and you're almost sure Danny and his buddies are going to pull the thing off--and rooting for them to do so--until a totally unexpected curve ball hits them.  (Watch for the Pack's names on the marquee behind them as they file out onto the street at the end, and see whether, like me, you can think of a way they could have gotten away with it.)",1456963200,,2962,4.894211576846307

Peter Lawford, who brought the property to Sinatra, has one of the bigger parts and one of the most complicated--a suave 40 year old man-child who has lived on his mother's money all his life. He might be the least likeable of the 11 former army buddies trying for their big opportunity with a New Year's Eve heist at five big Vegas casinos (one, the Sands, where Sinatra actually had a real-life 9% interest).

Angie Dickenson, Shirley Maclaine, George Raft and Red Skelton have small parts.  I was particularly impressed by Cesar Romero who did an excellent job with what I found to be the most interesting character of the bunch--the once-poor man who had once been a gangster, now gone straight (more or less), was charming, very wealthy and preparing to marry Lawford's mother (his scene with Lawford was probably the most interesting in the film, character-wise).

Romero not part of Sinatra's group of cons, but he brings his own brand of suave con-artistry to the part--I actually found his character more likeable than Lawford and more interestingly complex than any of the others, even Sinatra (the hip womanizer, former army sergeant, Danny Ocean who brings them all together for the heist).  Enjoyable, good ""buddy flick"", but don't expect a comedy.

And if you liked this one, I'd also recommend the even lighter ""shady Rat Pack with hearts of gold"" flick--""Robin and the 7 Hoods"" (where Bing Crosby actually steals every scene he's in).  This isn't the slick, fast paced Clooney remake, but for some reason, I actually enjoyed this one more.",1453593600,,1941,4.761904761904762

300683,3,6300269299,"Director Lewis Milestone gave the world a film with a compelling plot and the great vocalizations of members of The Summit (they disliked the name, Rat Pack) in this stylish, swinging, and swaggering 1960 caper, with music by Nelson Riddle.
  Frank Sinatra's  charisma shines forth as he plays Danny Ocean, a former member of the 82nd Airborne Division during World War II, who recruits  his old war buddies to carry out a heist in five Vegas casinos, namely the Sahara, Riviera, Desert Inn, the Sands,  and the Flamingo.
  Each of the men will have their own reasons for  participating.
  Peter Lawford plays the wealthy and sheltered (prior to wartime service) Jimmy Foster, who hopes the filthy lucre will afford him some financial independence from his mother, Mrs. Restes (Ilka Chase), who is now the fiancee of the reformed gangster Duke Santos(Caesar Romero), and Buddy Lester's  Vince Massler's  desire to relieve his wife from working as a stripper being two of the most compelling reasons.
 Some  commentaries they make are  politically incorrect by today's standards, and I could take umbrage to a few such remarks  as someone who is both Black and female, if I didn't appreciate that this was released in 1960. Even in the midst of the Civil Rights struggle, and with full knowledge of how much Sinatra did for civil rights even before the 1950s and 1960s, commentary about repealing the 14th and 19th Amendments to the Constitution was still very insensitive, even if it does depict the truth about the mindset of those characters.
 Danny Ocean's estranged wife, Beatrice is played by Angie Dickinson, who is dismayed by her husband's perpetual scheming. Patrice Wynne's Adele Elstrom is a casino girl with whom Ocean has had an unfortunate association.
  Dean Martin's Sam Harmon is a casino lounge singer who has access to the targeted areas. At one point audiences are treated to his now classic tune, ""Ain't That A Kick in the Head?""
 Sammy Davis Jr., who plays Josh Howard, gives a stunning, sharp, and beautiful vocalization of the title song. Ever the flashy triple threat while performing, even dressed as the garbage man designated to pick up the loot, his part in the  actual caper will succeed because authorities will easily overlook him.
 In the midst of it all, he will be generous enough to consider an associate in need.
 Joey Bishop plays Mushy O'Connors, and he appears to have a lesser role than the other Rat Pack members.
 Also rounding out the cast of cartoonishly shady characters are Henry Silva as  Roger Corneal, Richard Benedict as Curly Steffans, Norman Fell as Peter Rhemen, Clem Harvey as Louis Jackson, Akim Tamiroff as Spyros Acebos, and Richard Conte in the pivotal role of Tony Bergdorf. Jean Willes' Gracie Bergdorf, will help alter the course of events as well.
  Shirley MacLaine cameos as a tipsy woman outside one of the casinos who almost throws a monkey wrench in the New Year's Eve heist. Red Skelton and George Raft  appear briefly as well.
  We follow the group through the planning stages of the heist, learning how they synchronize everything with the precision of the military missions that some of them once carried out with inside and outside men in place.
  The following thought  occurred to me: I know  that military benefits may not always be adequate, but this is ridiculous!
  Well, the best laid schemes of mice and con men often go astray...Or in this case, up in smoke--a real kick in the head, indeed!
 After learning that there was a serious hitch  in their scheme, we watch the crestfallen group--who may avoid lengthy prison terms by simply keeping  their mouths shut, walking past a marquis with a few notable headliners on it.
  Well, back to an honest day's work, boys!",1394496000,,3747,4.874801901743265

Not only was it the pinnacle of Frank, Dean, Sammy, Peter and Joey's hold over Vegas, but it was their ""love Letter"" to the town as only Frank could do. Who else would come up with a premise like that?

I won't go into detail over the plot, it's been reviewed too many times, and woe be to the person who reveals the twist ending (SPOILERS!!), but the cast including the cameos throughout the film, including a hilarious Red Buttons who gets fresh with a cashier who is following Red's own orders he gave him, and Shirley MacLaine, aka ""The Mascot"" of the Pack in her little tete-a-tete with Dino.

Does this movie compare to the Cloon-Dog's remake? Of course not, and that franchise shouldn't even be considered any kind of reboot of this one, it stands on its own for a much different reason.

300804,4,6300269299,"My wife had never seen Ocean's 11.  I knew that the Rat Pack had done an earlier version, but had not seen it.  Finding that both versions were available on Amazon, we decided to watch the Rat Pack version before watching the Brat Pack version.

50 years after it was made, watching the Rat Pack ""Ocean's 11"" yields some interesting insights regarding the many ways American culture has changed - and not changed - in those intervening years.

  In both versions of the story, Danny Ocean brings together a team of talented individuals to perpetrate an unprecedented heist.  The Brat Pack team is composed of grifters, con-men and high tech criminals who come together to form an ad hoc team.  The Rat Pack version is firmly planted in the aftermath of WWII.  In this version, Danny Ocean recruits buddies with whom he had served 15 years before in the 82nd Airborne.  These were brothers-in-arms, not career criminals, who were looking for a sense of purpose and accomplishment that was lost to them when the war stopped.  Each one of those players was in some way scarred by that war, physically or emotionally.  None of those men referred to their hidden scars directly - that would have been unmanly in 1960 - but they could joke about their physical scars.  More importantly, though, they recognized that their experience in the war as a special operations unit within they elite 82nd Airborne, they were exceptional by training, by teamwork and by trial.  Danny Ocean's plan offered them the opportunity for huge financial gain, and to work together, again, as a team.

  The sub-theme of ex-soldiers still not completely at ease with reintegrating into civilian life is a reminder of the collateral damage our combat veterans have faced in all of our conflicts.  In this earlier Ocean's 11, it is only spoken of by the women who are collaterally involved.  Danny's estranged wife, the wife of the crew's electrical (not electronics) maven who was only recently released from jail, and the mother of the former lieutenant who is the operational planner.  The recognize the changes wrought on their returned soldiers.  Even they speak of the damage done with great circumspection.  Even they, however, recognize that they can never quite break into the bonds that were forged among these men who shared the war with one another.

  Were it not for the ""Greek Chorus"" of these three, almost all the women in the version from the 1960/s would be little more than pneumatic ornamentation intended to decorate the scenery behind our cast of characters. The more recent version and its sequels.  still have very little in the way of female characters, but the depth of these characters is much greater than that of the Rat Pack's.

  African American participation in this older Ocean's 11 is really something to ponder, and in retrospect might almost have been revolutionary.  Sammy Davis, Jr., is one of the veteran's involved, and we are led to understand that he left an eyeball behind in Europe.  In many ways, however, he has fared better than his previous comrades, having built a business important to success of the heist.  His business is one that is operated almost entirely by black men, and they are, for all intents and purposes, invisible to the society and authorities around them.  It is that invisibility that leads to their success.  When one thinks back on recent American history, it is not hard to recognize that this movie was set in the time not many years after President Truman ordered the integration of the armed forces, the times when the Supreme Court was handing down new rulings on civil rights, and the triumphs and tragedies that comprised the civil rights era that we recognize today as having really gained momentum with Brown vs. The Schoolboard of Topeka.  The film had no overt calls for changes to society.  But just the presence of Sammy Davis, Jr., and the acknowledgement that African-Americans were relegated to a lower rung of society while being ""hidden in plain sight,"" were aspects of the story that one would have to choose to ignore.  They were too blatant to be inadvertently overlooked, even in 1960.

  Movie making has certainly changed.  The pace of the newer films, the special effects, the availability of new cinematographic techniques, etc., all make the more recent films easier on the eyes.

  Bottom line: you would do well to watch this movie, then watch the Brat Pack version, and finally think about how those movies are alike and different.  Then think about what our nation has gone through with WWII being the formative experience of the Brat Pack, with successive generations having their life experiences formed by Korea, Vietnam, the civil rights movement, the technology booms of 70's and 80's through today, then two Middle East wars. It is well worth the considering how the two versions of Ocean's 11 provide bookends to the changes our society has experienced in that time period.  It is also to reflect on how our circumstances have changed for good or ill; and how they have remained the same - again, for good or ill.",1363392000,5,5096,4.859628770301624

300905,5,6300269299,"Russian immigrant and two-time Academy Award winning director Lewis Milestone may be better known for some of his other films such as 'All Quiet on the Western Front' and 'Mutiny on the Bounty', but 'Ocean's 11' is a solid genre film that transports its viewer to another time.

The cast is really what carries this movie. The Rat Pack had a kind of cool that just isn't around anymore. Whether it's Sammy David Jr.'s crooning the title song, Dean Martin's half-drunken wit or Frank Sinatra's smooth talking, these guys exuded a laid back, I-don't-give-a-damn-cause-it's-all-good kinda attitude that simply can't be faked. We believe it because they aren't really acting; they're playing themselves.

'Ocean's Eleven' is blessed with a raft of great actors. Fellow Rat Packers Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop help round out a cast filled with guys who carry a self-assured suave even when they're just walking down the Vegas strip in slim suits and skinny ties. They just look cool, and we want to be one of them.

'Ocean's 11' is far from a perfect film. It has pacing issues, some disjointed transitions, and only just handles the inter-weaving stories of the starring actors. With any other cast, this movie might only be an ordinary heist film. But Frank, Dean and Sammy provide this picture with a level of gravitas and swagger that makes us happy enough just to watch and admire.

While the remake 'Ocean's 11' is a technically superior action movie, the 1960 original simply can't be beat on cast and chemistry among the actors. You can see that these guys really are good friends and had a heck of a time making the movie. Their fun becomes our fun, and 'Ocean's 11' is a great ride because of it.",1354147200,,1703,4.782312925170068

Enjoy...",1348185600,,358,4.59375
300908,3,6300269299,"Oceans 11(released Aug/60) is a time capsule for those interested in seeing what the old Vegas strip and hotels once looked like along with some top talent of the era. A good thing to watch for are the signs in the background at each of the hotels,for they tell volumes on the movers and shakers of the entertainment industry then appearing there. This movie of course stars the coveted members of the,now referred to,Rat Pack. This group was its' second incarnation,and they actually referred to themselves as the Clan or the Summit,not the Rat pack. That moniker was given by the press. The original Rat Pack,by name,was led by Humphrey Bogart and the only member as a hold over from that original group was Frank Sinatra. The movie was shot,of course,in Vegas and it was an easy gig for all because they all practically lived there anyways. After or before shooting they would perform in the casinos. They and older Vegas,unfortunately,are really the only things in its favour. It is not an easy and well flowing film by any means.
The plot involves a group of ex-82nd American Airborne paratroopers. They are gathered together by their ""leader"" Sinatra,though the man who plans the actual heist is someone else. Their plan is to rob five different Vegas casinos in one fell swoop. They have guys on the inside and out and the plan is flawless. Most of the pre-heist/movie,are taken up with the gathering together of all the guys and the scouting out of each facility. When the actual heist goes down it goes down quick. The post heist takes up the rest of the film. It sees their plan become the knowledge of one of the guys mother's new boyfriends who tries to extort a 50% cut out of them for NOT going to the cops. When one of the members suddenly dies of a heart attack,they plant the money in his coffin to sneak it out of town. But the widow who comes to claim it decides it's better to let the body remain in Vegas and a church ceremony takes place accordingly. In case you've never seen it,I won't give away the ending,but let's just say they don't live happily ever after.
Frankly the storyline is a bore. Most of the film is taken up with the before and aftermath of the heist. The actual heist itself goes down within 10 minutes. And it is a long stretch until the heist and a long stretch to the finish line. The Pack and the rest of the cast do an admirable job in their roles,don't get me wrong,and in fact Dino and Sammie even get to sing;Dino his hit A kick in the Head(more than once) and Sammie doing the theme song. But there is little else to keep one interested frame after long frame. If the script and movie had been edited properly,this film might have had more pizazz than it does,but as is it just fizzles. The only thing,as I said,is the historical value of the picture. Considered the Pack's mascots,Norman Fell,Shirley McLaine and Angie Dickinson all make appearances in the film. There is even an original Rat Pack member from the first group in the form of veteran actor Ceasar Romero,who would in a few years become well known for being the Joker to TV's Batman. Also making cameos are veterans George Raft,Red Skelton and Richard Boone.
Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. There are however some bits of dirt here and there,especially in the opening credits,which were created by Saul Bass,one half of the now legendary Rankin/Bass animators. I don't know what it was about the late 50s and early 60s,but Hollywood was simply enamoured of animated opening and closing credits in their films. Extras include two trailers,commentary,some neat footage with folks that actually worked the original hotels knocked off in this film,and a clip from the Tonight Show with Frank Sinatra hosting and with guest Angie Dickinson(popular then in her new show Police Woman)reminiscing about Oceans 11.
All in all a quite pedestrian film that takes too long to get to the point,and too long to make a graceful exit. The films stars and background will intrigue historians of all kinds,but that,now,is really it's only saving grace,sad to say. 2 1/2- 3 stars.",1347494400,2,4135,4.6657534246575345

300913,4,6300269299,"Don't be fooled by recent 'remakes' that, in my experience, are just third-rate copycats. This is the real deal with the real Rat Pack. Sinatra, Martin, Davis Jr., et al. are superb in this caper which is full of the ultimate cool. Some may consider this to be 'old school & full of old men' but those kids have no idea what it means to be truly hip...and the cast of this film doesn't let you down in that department. One of the many bonuses is the great writing, quick wit, and hilarious quips that are sorely missing in so many contemporary films. The views of vintage Las Vegas are a real treat & give the viewer a glimpse into the long-gone city that, if it hadn't existed, would have never let the Vegas of today come to fruition. The Vegas of this era was also an 'adults-only' town...no kids allowed. The story line is solid, the characters well placed, and the movie moves along at a nicely crafted pace. One of my favorite scenes is where Sammy Davis, Jr. sings the lyrics to the title song...lyrics that anyone can relate to while they wait for their ship to come in. And in case you're wondering why he says ""E-O-Eleven""...dealers were often misunderstood by customers at the gambling table because ""seven"" also sounded like ""eleven"" in the din of a casino. As a result, dealers started saying ""E-O-Eleven"" instead of ""eleven"" to avoid confusion...and a potentially expensive gambling mistake. Speaking of mistakes, I won't make one by giving away the ending. I'll save that for your viewing enjoyment. The cinematography and sound dubbing could have been a little more polished, but that's the only reason I didn't give this movie five stars. Otherwise, this movie is great fun for cool cats of all ages. And, like ""Marty"" (which I've covered in another one of my reviews), this is a great ""guys-night-in"" movie for an evening of chilling out with all your buddies. Very well done movie...and a definite ""must buy!""",1324425600,,1928,4.673529411764706

300973,2,6300269299,"I hadn't seen this film until last night, at a friend's place. I understand it has been remade with George Clooney and Julia Roberts (I haven't seen that version yet either).

Perhaps I've been spoiled by seeing such good quality ""heist"" films or series; BBC's ""Hustle"", for instance, or the remake of ""The Italian Job"", ""Inside Man"", ""A Fish called Wanda""... These are works using character development, superb scripts and wonderful acting under some very, very good directing indeed.

There were some fabulous classic ""heist"" films as well; ""Bob le flambeur"", Kubrick's ""The Killing"", ""Rififi"", ""The Asphalt Jungle"", the 1955 ""The Ladykillers"".

In comparison, I thought the original ""Ocean's Eleven"" made a very poor showing. The first half of the film seems to have little purpose other than to give the rat pack some interaction, some not-very-funny lines, an opportunity for childish behaviour, and some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard. I found it very boring - and I'm normally very forgiving of films of this era. I love great snappy dialogue and scene-scetting. But this wasn't great snappy dialogue at all. The pace was unbelievably tedious. If the objective were to give the characters motivation for their plot to pull off the casino heist, it could have been done much more powerfully and convincingly in a tenth of the time.

The actual heist itself is fine (not superb - the cinematography and lighting were nothing spectacular, but it worked); if the entire film had been of this quality, it might even have deserved its classic status. But it quickly descended into credulity-stretching tedium again; the discovery made by a major criminal seeking to protect his status in Las Vegas by finding the thieves (who coincidentally happens to be newly engaged to the mother of one of the eleven men involved) about who pulled off the heist is, again, very poorly written, both in terms of plausibility and dialogue. The scenario offered an opportunity for dramatic tension which was simply... ignored.

The actors seemed largely to be bored by the film, and their acting lacked dramatic cohesion. Even had they acted brilliantly and even had the directing been better, though, I think the poor writing would have killed the film for me.

The ""twist"" ending was completely predictable as soon as the money was moved. I turned to my friend and said, ""The [...] is going to be [...], isn't it?"" (Trying not to offer spoilers...) She nodded; I'd guessed the ""surprise"" ending without any effort.

The final scene, though, was good. I enjoyed the pained look on the faces of the thieves. But a final nice scene doesn't save the movie.

In short, I was surprisingly disappointed. I'm going to watch the first series of ""Hustle"" again to wipe away the memory of this film.

The movie suffered in its pacing and tone.  When shown without the commercial interruptions on video, PBS, or cable, it fares way better.  Even though there is really a serious and understated tone to this Rat Packer film, the real treat here is just to see ""the guys""(who represented the swinging coolness of the late 50's/early 60's of America before the advent of the counter-culture late-60's, the Vietnam War, and the death of JFK) together on an adventure. The story is straight forward, and the technical jargon of the heist is easy to understand compared to its modern day remake(s), and the characters are all likeable.

SYNOPSIS--
Eleven buddies (led by Danny Ocean, aka Sinatra) plan and pull off a theft at five Las Vegas casinos simultaneously. They get away with their haul, but are later confronted by an ex-gangster who's figured out what occurred and is demanding half the take.

Shirley MacLaine's impromptu appearance as a tipsy gal is a highlight; George Raft (who was a personal friend of Vegas pioneer Bugsy Siegel) portrays a casino owner and Red Skelton appears as himself. Richard Boone is the voice of an unseen minister; TV quiz show announcer George Fenneman can be heard in a phone conversation with an interrogating sheriff. Watch for one-time cowboy star Hoot Gibson in his last screen appearance, as a roadblock deputy.

Compared to modern films this one is very slow-moving and took a long long time just to get started.

Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr were about the only actors who stood out, not least for their singing. Though the short scene with a very young Shirley MacLaine was a highpoint.

While it was interesting to see the Rat Pack in action, probably the best thing about the original Ocean's 11 was the surprise ending (and even that was a bit predictable).",1197590400,2,800,4.391891891891892
301028,5,6300269299,"The envelope please. Yes, it's Ocean's Eleven. It was a unanimous vote wow!

Why?
Stars -
Original:

Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Peter Lawford, georgous Angie Dickenson and a very young and hot Shirley Maclain(age has not been kind to you has it).

Remake:

Matt Damon (ok not too bad), George Clooney (Oh God, I'm soo bored making this movie), and Julia Roberts ( Why won't this woman take acting lessons, please for God's sake. I'm ready to start a fund?) and a bunch of other lesser knowns.

Believability -
Original:
The plot of the original seems very simple. Just cross the wires and the cages automatically open. Ok, maybe a little simplistic, but way more believable than the remake. How they get the money out of the casino's is also very clever.

Remake:
The chinese acrobat who happens to be a crook cmon. The fake cops at the end, who rush in and take away the money, cmon? The fact that the Mirage and Bellagio are connected by a common tunnel, cmon anybody ever heard of Ceasar's Palace being between these two properties? There are so many holes in the plot of the remake that you can drive a garbage truck through it.

Likeability - You actually like the characters in the original. Their stories are way more believable and reasons for pulling off the heist are way more noble. In the remake, they try to create some dramatic tension between the Julia Roberts character and Clooney, and the Steve Wynn (Casion Owner) character, but the acting and writing is so bad it works in revese. You actually end up rooting for the Casino and Steve Wynn!

Pacing -
Original:
Several reviewers have criticized this movie as moving way too slow. To me it makes the picture  more believable. Think about it. It's 15 years after the end of WWII. There is no internet. You have to find the 11 guys spread out across the US, and convince them to join you. It is going to take time. You'd be lucky to find all of them in 1960. The details of the heist are not important, plot and character development is.

Remake:
There just happens to be 11 career criminals who happen to have instant contact with each other. (What are they listed in the phone book, cmon?) They are way too slick. In the remake you could predict everything that was going happen right down to the fake cops at the end.

Depths of Characters -
Original:
You believe the characters. Sammy, ""There isn't much use for a one eyed shortstop in Mobile Alabama so you have to follow the trash any way you can"" on why he became a garbageman.

Vince , ""I don't want to have my wife ever face those bums"" as his beautiful stripper wife is on stage as his motivation for joining the gang.

The Electrician, who went to prison for trying to buy his wife a fur coat and ends up losing his kid in the process. He finds out he's going to the ""Big Casino"" and wants to provide for his kid.

Peter Lawford as the spoiled rich kid, ""Money is a hard habit to break."" , on why he's joining the gang.

Remake:
Virtually no believable character development, plus the unitentionally hysterical love triangle between Wynn, Roberts and Clooney already mentioned.

Women:
Original: Angie Dickenson and Shirley MaClaine -
Angie is absolutely beautiful as Danny Ocean's wife. You can see why President Kennedy was ""interested"" in her. Her acting is wonderful too. On the DVD edition she provides wonderful commentary along with Frank Sinatra JR. Shirley Maclaine also appears in an uncredited cameo. In 1960 she was stunning. Unfortunately age has not been kind to her, maybe that's why she's into all that crazy stuff.

Remake: Julia Roberts - Why do people continue to hire this woman? She's not even that good looking, let alone her lack of acting ability. In the remake Danny Ocean actually loses the battle and wins this doozy. Again unitentional hillarity as the Casino Owner gains by losing the girl.

Ending - Don't worry I won't spoil it for you.
Original: A great ending, with probobly one of the most famous ending shots of all time in a movie.

Remake: - Why in all modern movies do the bad guys have to get away with the crime? The movie is just too slick. You knew the cops at the end were fake, you just knew they'd get away with the caper, but at the end you just wish they wouldn't have.

Extra's -
Original:
Watch the garbage truck as it travels down the strip. There are no casino's on the west side of the strip! (save the Dunes, which wasn't included in the movie) You also see what a small town Vegas was back then.

Several people have criticized the movie for some of the racial jokes. Ok, but remember it was Frank who was on the forefront of integrating Vegas. He was the one who went to the casino owners and told them, you have to come into the 20th century.

Summation -
Original:

A wonderful time piece. A movie with beautiful music, suprisingly good writing, and just fun to watch.

Remake:

301053,3,6300269299,"The only real pleasure in ""Ocean's Eleven"" is being let into the Rat Pack circle for a couple of hours... The film stops all too frequently for guest spots and in-jokes, with a slow first hour... Compared to Jules Dassin's 'Rififi,' or to Phil Karlson's 'Five Against the House,' it pales considerably...

'Ocean's Eleven' is a weak heist film with the emphasis firmly on light humor, and few diverting escapades, but nobody cares because the cast includes the biggest stars of the day (Frankie, Dino, Sammy etc...), burning the motion picture into the collective memory of the public as the first to showcase Hollywood's notorious Rat Pack...

'Ocean's Eleven' is a buddy movie made with real buddies, and it's fun... It in't supposed to be very good... It is supposed to be cool... A playground for legendary entertainers, these guys knew how to get the job done, to pause only to knock back innumerable Whisky sodas, wear their tuxedo, hang out in bars, talk the talk, belt out a couple of classy little numbers, and have a great sense of fun together on screen... And this fun filtered off the silver screen and into the audience like a tasty appetizer before the main course...

Old Blue Eyes is the mastermind of the heist... He is carrying out a plan originated by racketeer Spyros Acebos where five gambling casinos (Sahara, Riviera, Desert Inn, The Sand and The Flamingo) will be robbed simultaneously at midnight on New Year's celebration...

During the week before Christmas, the 'special combat team' (all experts in one thing and another) arrive in Las Vegas, for the job-of-a-lifetime... The scheme of the robbery is ingenious, requiring military precision and perfect timing... An electrical tower will be blown up to black out the whole town... The swag will be deposited in garbage cans outside the casinos, and the cans will be collected by a disposal truck...

On New Year's Eve, the hold-up goes off beautifully, exactly as planned... Only one of the men has a heart attack on the street and collapses... The gang cannot get the multi-million loot out of Las Vegas but they manage to hide it in some place, unknown to them, however, that 'someone' was preparing for them all a nice wry outcome...

Dean Martin, the eternal essence of cool, is the entertainer who sings ""Ain't That a Kick in the Head,' and Sammy Davis Jr. is the perennial icon of cool who sings ""EEO-Eleven.'

Peter Lawford is the playboy with one objective and one mission: To hit Las Vegas, Nevada!

Angie Dickinson is the understanding wife, discreet, feminine and chic... Unfortunately the camera does not especially flatter her looks...

Richard Conte is the master electrician dying of cancer, who needs to leave some cash for his kid's college...

Cesar Romero is coldly menacing and very amusing: 'They shouldn't have done it while I was in town. It's embarrassing!'

George Raft is the mob with the best deal to get the money back...

Akim Tamiroff is hilariously neurotic as the master planner...

Buddy Lester wants to get his wife out of stripping...

Shirley MacLaine is the drunk gal in urge for a little kiss in a critical moment...

Red Skelton is the unlucky player, arguing with the casino cashier how to raise his gambling limit...

""Ocean's Eleven"" could never be made again... The new 'Ocean's Eleven,' 2001 is considerably different in the details.. After all, there was only 'one' Rat Pack, and if the Ocean's Eleven of 1960 is anything, it is certainly a Rat Pack movie... So if you still have a strange fascination with this gang of friends, and like to watch essentially a these guys playing around on screen, and to watch Las Vegas as it looked in 1960, well... check out this nostalgic trip back... You'll never see its like again...",1168387200,4,3748,4.8328125

301055,5,6300269299,"Granted the pacing for this movie was a bit on the sluggish side.  But then again, so was Psycho and Casablanca.  The age of flashcut editing and grainy filters (see: Traffic).  1960's films didn't need to worry about bloggers going ape over the slow pace or the fact that Frank and Co. doesn't even ""heist"" until 60+ mins into the film.  Character development was the key back then.  George Bailey be damned, but you wouldn't have known the main reason he was on the bridge talking to Clarence until you saw ALL the problems he was having.

NOW...as far as this movie goes, it is spectacular.  The music, the story, even the wardrobe.  Dean gives a couple combat fatigue'd gals a good song near the middle of the movie, Frank justifies his eager loins, Sammy contributes probably the best part of the movie.  How ironic a city employee commits a MAJOR crime, and DOESN'T HAVE A MAJOR INQUIRY OR COMMITTEE hunting him down.  Early on in her career, Shirley MacClaine was known for a Rat Pack friend.  She looks her age now, but darn it if she didn't look fantastic back then!

If you wanted to know what Vegas was like in the days after Bugsy, but before the Mob really came into town, check out ""Ocean's 11"".

Perhaps I'm a little biased as well, but as I used to work at a radio station that played Dean, Frank, Sammy songs...as well as Theresa Brewer, Burl Ives (he of the ""Holly Jolly Christmas"" fame), et al I immediately fell in love with the movie.

""Ocean's 11"" gives you the Vegas that made Vegas...well, Vegas.  Why did people spend money at a casino?  To see Dino's lounge act.  To hear Theresa Brewer belt out fantastic love songs...and to see Red Skelton's comedy act.

301057,4,6300269299,"The Brat Pack has performed one great public service -- drawing attention back to this not-so-long-ago forgotten film, ressurrecting it out of the vast tar pits of yesterday's embarrassments.  Now we can properly see it as the accidental classic that it is.  Despite epic sloppiness and goofs that have been catalogued elsewhere, the movie eerily sums up a critical American moment, when the so-called ""American Dream"" finally unmasked as big bucks, period -- and however and how fast that you could get them.

Those recently enamored with this film glory in its cool and swagger.  Without detracting at all from that, take a look at the hard edge of realism here.  Sinatra leads the unmasking, about as far from his early teen idol as you could get, droll and spooky, sweaty and obsessed.  This throw away role becomes one of his finest performances.  No romance or finesse about it, whatsoever:  ""broads"" are to be used and discarded once over the hill, but bucks could solve a lot of problems.  The needs and tawdry ambitions of the other hoods are all at least lightly explored.  Sammy, in alley cat glory, sings of the outrageous dream:  a penthouse, no work.  Lawford looks like a living dead, rarely better used.  The creepy funeral home finale and the memorable ending shot of the hoods panning out, dejected, across a parking lot says it all, and undercuts the picture at precisely the proper angle.

Well, that sounds like a downer.  Why don't you notice it?  For me, the magnificent Dino just carries it along wonderfully, especially his classic Vegas performances.  Ole number 2 comes through.  His over the hill blowsy crooner is still able to hypnotize the  nearby vixens, in a sequence so over the top it must be seen to be believed.

This movie perfectly documents the other side -- in other words the real side -- of the so-called ""Camelot"" era.  It uncannily does so by not trying to do any such thing at all.",1130889600,4,1927,4.743975903614458

301059,5,6300269299,"First off,there is a review for this film suggesting that the ideal age of a viewer of Ocean's 11 is 40 and up. Then there is a review by a sixteen year old saying that is certainly not true. I absolutely agree. I'm fourteen. I adore the Rat Pack. You know,there ARE a few teenagers out there who have good taste

  Now that that's taken care of,on to the warnings. I am probably among the most avid Sinatra fans who have ever existed,

so I may not exactly be the least biased reviewer you could find,but I'm not blind. I will never tire of watching The Tender Trap,High Society,Robin and the Seven Hoods,Can-Can,Pal Joey,AND Ocean's 11,but I have to admit,any person who enjoys gazing blankly at the screen as this group of Mobsters rubs out that one,and the main character of that movie dies a gruesome death while the main character of another is merely condemned to a life of inner suffering,will probably not be overly fond of those ring-a-ding vehicles.(I would love to say the fact of your looking up Ocean's 11 means you are not a member of that idiotic group,but some of the other reviews of this film prove that theory wrong. So if you are,don't bother finishing the review,just go watch Ocean's 12,proclaim it the best movie you've ever seen,and enjoy wallowing in your rotten taste.)

  Ocean's 11 is a fun movie. That is,it's marvelous if you like the Rat Pack. If you don't,it's terrible. This film IS star power.

If there have ever been such things as magnetism and charisma there is,in my opinion,no entertainer who posessed them more powerfully than Frank Sinatra. Dean Martin is enjoyable in this (and everything else)by being relaxed,amusing,and a pleasant crooner in small doses. Sammy was one terrific all-around entertainer,though not THE BEST in any of his talents.(I despise Peter Lawford,so I will ignore him.)

  So,three entertainers who were,and who in legacy remain, at the absolute top in show business got together and made a movie with some fun inside jokes,a painless plot,and magic. Who CARES that it takes them until half the movie to pull off that robbery everybody keeps talking about. Whoever is watching this movie just to see a couple casinos get robbed has definitely got to get some new hobbies. Who cares about the stupid casinos! People have not watched this movie for years to see Richard Conte sneaking about the hallways rigging the light fixtures. They've watched it to see Frank Sinatra,Dean Martin,and Sammy Davis Jr. in their glory days BE Frank Sinatra,Dean Martin,and Sammy Davis Jr.,for they are the rare performers magical enough to attract audiences by just being themselves. That's what makes Ocean's 11 worthy of 5 stars. I wouldn't have missed it for the world.(P.S.-To those who call Frank Sinatra a rotten actor,listen to the albums In the Wee Small Hours,Only the Lonely,and Where are You;

watch From Here to Eternity,Suddenly,The Man with the Golden Arm,Young at Heart,Von Ryan's Express,and The Manchurian Candidate,read the reviews for all those;and remember that he did win an Oscar and was nominated for another,and that Humphrey Bogart,Frank Capra,and Billy Wilder all called him one of the greatest natural actors they'd ever seen. That will prove you 100 percent wrong.)",1126310400,6,3243,4.9411764705882355
301060,2,6300269299,"First of all, I didn't see the either remakes with George Clooney and friends so I can't make any comparisons.

Starting with the movie itself, it comes across as a vanity/""let's have a good time"" piece for Frank Sinatra and his cronies. Some of them most notably Sinatra, Martin, Davis Jr. were extraordinary talents and superb entertainers in their own right. Unfortunately, except for a few pieces thrown in with Davis Jr. and Martin, you never truly experience the ""magic"" of these performers.

It takes forever for the movie to get going, I imagine the entertainment was to watch as Dan Ocean (Sinatra) gathers his old war buddies who have gone their separate ways. The gathering of rogues-schtick has been done in far more entertaining ways than in this film.

You also get introduced to the few token women who are either coniving bitches, floozies, or dignified ex-wives/girlfriends.

The part I enjoyed most was when the heist actually happened as the film moves from one casino to the next watching each member smoothly pulling off their part.

The ending which I guess was supposed to be ironic felt more anti-climatic than anything else. More like a slowly leaking tire finally going flat. I suspect the finally ""irony"" re the fate the the money has been done so often in subsequent films that you can see it coming a mile away.

The buddy dying of the big ""C"" really dates the movie. Never would that level of pathos get by a modern audience on film. Unless of course it was on TV a la Extreme Makeover or a talk show.

As I mentioned in the title, Ocean's 11 is an absolute gem of a historic relic. Like a little time capsule of the times. You get to see the Rat Pack in their smoking/drinking/carousing glory. Los Vegas, the height of sophisticated fun back then looks positively quaint. More like gussied up bingo parlors.

The REAL Ocean's 11 has the best ending, the perfect ending.  The cast is incomparable.  From all reports, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin would wander the casino after filming, and take over tables as the dealer.  Losers were declared winners, and the owner didn't care - they were bringing in too many customers for the owner to complain about paying out a little extra.

Everyone I have introduced to Ocean's 11, regardless of age, has been extremely complimentary.  One even said he liked the remake - until he saw the original.  And he was a young Vice President of a company which employed more than 500.

The remake would have been good - if they hadn't stolen the name and tried to be a remake.  As a stand alone, it's okay.  As a remake, it pales miserably by comparison.  If you want to see a great movie, see the original, the REAL, Ocean's 11.",1105056000,12,1079,4.35678391959799

The film also represents a time capsule of a Las Vegas that no longer exists, as evidenced by the destruction of the Sands in 1996. Unfortunately, there is little else that remains memorable, except for the famous ""twist"" ending and some amusing cameos by Red Skelton, George Raft and Shirley MacLaine. Director Lewis Milestone was better off filming the Rat Pack's ""Summit"" performances, which had more energy and spontaneity. For a ""caper"" film, ""Ocean's 11"" moves at a lethargic pace  bogged down by too many secondary characters and subplots. Amazingly, the heist is not introduced until the halfway mark. Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. come off best, with Frank Sinatra displaying little enthusiasm for the material.

The picture's problem is that it's dated in a way that doesn't hold up well.  Its Playboyistic slickness, which came to pass for sophistication in many sixties flicks, imparts an aura of parody that bloats the pacing and results in a plodding, strained storyline.  Had the film been done ten years earlier, it might have been made as noir, and the Rat Pack could have been great in that genre!

301089,4,6300269299,"I would have given this movie 5 stars because I like the Rat Pack, it is entertaining, and it does have a good story line with an interesting twist of an ending. Like other Rat Pack films, it must have been a fun-to-make movie for them, but it has some serious detractions. Like Gone With The Wind is a ""gal movie"", this is a ""guy movie"" with all the requisite adventure, gambling, money, smoking, drinking, and glamorous showgirls. Set in Las Vegas, it is a fantasy about eleven World War II veterans of the 82nd Airborne Division, led by Danny Ocean (Sinatra), who reunite to use their commando war experience to rob five casinos at once on New Year's Eve. Rather than focussing on ""the mission,"" the story moves off track at times because of the four extraneous characters who make little or no contribution to the story. Ceasar Romero plays the fianc to playboy Peter Lawford's very wealthy mother who provides him with some ""spending money"" when he runs a little low. Her part could just as easily have been reduced to a voice on the other end of a telephone call (""Mother, could you send me some more spending money?"" ""Alright, dear.""). With her gone, Romero can go because after the heist, he deduces that the eleven commandos are the guilty ones when he learns that Lawford's ten army buddies are also in town. What a leap! He then tries to shake down the casinos by offering to find their stolen money for a 30% fee. This ends up going nowhere because of the surprise ending, so why not delete that character? The next is Angie Dickenson who plays Ocean's wife. They love each other, but have been kept apart for some strange reason that only women can figure out. Why their love problems couldn't wait the two days this story covers is not explained. Through the introduction of a complex male-female relationship, her character provides the sole purpose of maintaining female audience interest, as though all the handsome male entertainers weren't enough. I don't care what Frank Sinatra, Jr. says on the included extra naration, the worst character of the four by light years was played by Akim Tameroff. His only contribution to the story was that he thought up the idea for the heist. Far better would have been to have cool Danny Ocean think it up and eliminate Tameroff and all the irritating, exasperating nervousness and constant telephone ringing he brings. Of course, with the deletion of four characters, it would have to be called ""Ocean's 7"".

There are also some interesting cameo appearances by Red Skelton, George Raft, and Shirley MacClain (although I could not find her name in the credits). Skelton plays gambler who has exceeded his limit, is trying to cash a check to buy more chips, gets angry when refused, and has to be thrown out by casino security. This role damages his happy-go-lucky comedian memory. A minor observation is that the film's dialog seems a bit contrived at times by today's standards, but maybe you could say that's typical Rat Pack.

After not having seen it since it came out, I did enjoy it, though. If I had it to buy over again, would I? Probably.",1053475200,2,3105,4.684981684981685

The two musical numbers (Sammy Davis Jr. singing ""Ee-Oh-11"" and Dean Martin singing ""Ain't Love a Kick in the Head"") seem kind of random, as if they started out to make a musical but then gave up on that idea along the way. I got that feeling a lot during this movie...that the guys were just wandering around Vegas, and happened to make a movie while they were there.
""Ocean's Eleven"" is still fun to watch, though, especially the scene at Bergdorf's funeral, when the boys realize what has happened, and they each turn to look at the guy next to him, going on down the row.",1041292800,4,823,4.530201342281879

The heist is fun, the lead actors are too-cool (for 1960), it was great to see a very young Shirley MacLaine in an unbilled cameo, and the surprise ending is great, but the dialogue and the pacing are awful.  And the excuse for musical numbers is so false and stupid -- it was fine to have Dean Martin as a nightclub entertainer -- but Sammy Davis Jr. singing and dancing at the sanitation depot, and behind the wheel of the garbage truck WITH FULL NELSON RIDDLE ORCHESTRATION -- all this just slowed down the pacing?!?!?!  And what was Red Skelton's reason for being in this film? (One guess:  NONE!)

First of all, if you're looking for anything other than something to relax to, go watch something else. Frank said before they even started production on this movie that they weren't out to win any awards; the goal was to simply have fun. I'll agree that ""the 2001 remake has a better script and direction"", but that wasn't what these boys aimed to do.
""How can they even try to compare the new one to the old one?""
So true. I mean really, who, in their right mind, would try to compare ANYONE to Frank Sinatra? No one in the universe will ever come close again. Basically this movie and the new one are two totally different movies and I highly suggest you watch them as so.
""I'm going to go out on a limb, and say that this movie will not appeal to younger viewers (40 and under), the same way that it appeals to their parents or grandparents.""
Um. Excuse me? I'm 16 and I am a diehard fan of Frank, Dean, & Sammy. You can't get any cooler than them.
""I didn't see the 'coolness' or 'swagger' that is associated with the Rat Pack. To me, they all looked the same, dressed the same, and acted the same.""
That's just nuts. I don't know what else to say to that.
Overall, I highly suggest this movie to anyone who's into late 50s-early 60s Vegas (honestly, I dearly wish that Vegas still looked like that), immense talent, and just having a good time.

Just seeing so many of them together is cause for celebration.  The only other movie starring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop is ""Sergeants 3"" (1962), and ""Ocean's Eleven"" throws in Vegas, Angie Dickinson and Akim Tamiroff to boot.  The plot concerns a group of army buddies lead by Sinatra (Danny Ocean) who get together to rob 5 Vegas casinos simultaneously.  The plot is fun, and the chemistry between the stars is terrific - it really feels like a bunch of friends getting together and joking around.  The movie even has an amusing twist ending.
Sammy sings an original song, ""Eee-O 11"" and Dean sings ""Ain't that a Kick in the Head?"" (both of which are available on the CD ""Eee-O-11: The Best of the Rat Pack"").  Best of all, the DVD is packed with extras, including a commentary track with Frank Sinatra Jr.  There is also a clip from the 1970's with Frank Sinatra hosting the Tonight Show and Angie Dickinson as his guest.

301127,4,6300269299,"I confess that I'm not a huge Rat Pack fan. That cool gang of stars was way before my time and I don't agree with the ethics of how they ""ruled"" things in Hollywood. Nevertheless, I do admire Frank Sinatra as a very talented actor and Dean Martin wasn't too shabby either, as long as he was completely sober or totally drunk.

With that said, I was severely disappointed by the first Rat Pack movie, 1960's OCEAN'S ELEVEN. The movie was slow, the action limited, the dialogue almost lame. Neither Sinatra, Martin, or Davis give much of a performance and that triumvirate is completely out-acted by Cesar Romero, who gives one of the few believable and enjoyable performances in the movie. Not only that, but after sitting through almost two hours of waiting for the patriotic paratroopers to get their dough, the film ends with a sour, almost cheesy conclusion.

The film is worth watching if you're a movie buff for its historical value (it was the first Rat Pack picture). It's also fun to compare and contrast this picture to George Clooney and Stephen Soderburgh's remake (a far better and much more rewarding film). Other than that, don't listen to all the hype about this being the ultimate heist movie because it's not.",1020988800,,1226,4.724299065420561

The ending was one of them -- but it was a lot to sit through to get there.  Sinatra and Martin were dry, and Sammy Davis, Jr. was way under-utilized.  Peter Lawford was excellent as the rich kid, and I think gave the strongest performance.  I enjoyed Cesaer Romero as well.
I much preferred the remake of this movie.",1013040000,4,420,4.533333333333333
301155,3,6300269299,"""Ocean's 11"", produced in 1960, was the first of a series of films starring members of the Rat Pack (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy David Jr., Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop at the time. Lawford and Bishop would kicked out by Sinatra later on) for Warner Brothers and this movie was far and away the most popular of the bunch. Many of the actors who hung out with Pack like Shirley McLaine would find themselves in various cameo roles in this film. Though Sinatra was looking for a film script that he and his pals could do together, it was Peter Lawford who found the book ""Ocean's 11"" and the rest is history.
Although the DVD cover calls this movie a heist caper, the script must rank as the most easygoing heist even presented on screen. The title character, ex-paratrooper Danny Ocean, who is played by Sinatra, calls together ten members of his old unit to plan and execute a multi-million dollar robbery of five Las Vegas Strip casinos and much of the beginning of the film is spent gathering up the team, spending time with a few of them to see why they decide to join in and spending time watching Danny tangle with the women in his life and the boys tormenting their underworld backer. The planned heist appears to be foolproof and remarkably easy as long as everyone does his job. Naturally since this is 1960 and the bad guys still can't really win, a few twists in the plot are thrown in.
Surprisely, Sinatra does not give a very good performance in the film, especially when compared to his earlier work. Of the rat packers, only Peter Lawford gives a solid performance throughout. Even Dean Martin, with his relaxed style of acting, slums it on occasion. It is the other actors like Akim Tamiroff, Patrice Wymore, George Raft, and Cesar Romero who give the best performances. In fact, Cesar Romero almost steals the show as the (almost) retired gangster Duke Santos who might just crash the boys' New Year's Eve party. It is surprising that some of the best scenes in the movie are ones without the nominal stars.
The main problem with this edition of ""Ocean's 11"" is that it suffers from an identity crisis. You suspect it was intented to be a comedy, or a suspense, or maybe even a morality play but the script cannot make up mind through most of the film. It is perhaps best to describe it an excuse for a group of people to make a movie and have a good time doing it and hopefully the film audience will join in the fun.
If you like your crime films to have lots of suspense, action and explosions, ""Ocean's 11"" is not the film to see. If you like to see a time capsule of a bygone era whose likes we will not see again, this film may work for you.",1012176000,43,2670,4.428861788617886
301156,3,6300269299,"The original Ocean's 11 is NOT about the crime itself - which takes so little screen time to pull. It is more about the idea of the crime.
Several friends of mine like this original version so much more than the recently released big screen ""remake"" - and these same friends think the original film is awful!
I don't agree it's awful. I think there are a number of clever touches that the new version has foolishly ignored. It is made clear in the 1960 film that those with criminal records would not be able to get near a casino. In the Clooney version they ALL have criminal records. And the idea of a crack military team pulling the job has a better chance of succeeding :non-professionals avoids the problem of stool pigeons among known criminals. That's very clever, and absent from the new version. The new version is clever in other ways, but too pat. And the original's wry ending is a bonus. At least the Clooney version has a few sly references to the original - but not enough. They are very different films.
I will admit I think that Frank and the boys' performances lack punch - with the exception of Cesar Romero. That is understandable when you realize they were performing on stage all night at the same time filming was taking place. I think most people who would buy this would know that - but for those who don't, the big plus of this DVD is Frank Sinatra, Jr.'s informative, knowledgable and very generous commentary. He also provides commentary for Robin and the 7 Hoods on DVD, which I regard as the superior of the two films (although it is a little disconcerting to hear him refer to his father as Frank, or worse yet, just Sinatra).",1011139200,7,1657,4.490066225165563
301157,2,6300269299,"It is very strange to see this film and then to watch the George Clooney remake. The original was the first film to star the ""Rat Pack"" that is Frank Sinatra's fellow drinking, fellow womanising crew.
It is hard to imagine a modern audience enjoying this film much. The original appeal was to see a group of starts, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis etc who oozed appeal and talent. They were filmed in a ""glamerous world"" of Vegas.
Nowdays no one would really know who most of the stars were and to a modern viewer the cast seems to be sleep walking. Vegas also seems insignificant compared to what it is now. The film appears to be shot inside the actual Casino's and in 1960 they were small one floored places which lacked the glamour they do today.
The plot involves a former army officer who gets his old outfit to do a series of robberies. The idea being that 11 former paratroopers could pull of the ""crime of the century"". As such all of the cast look incredibly straight. All of them wear suits and ties and the contrast with the George Cluney remake is starteling.
The main attraction of this film is that it captures the 50's so well. The sexism of the period, the attitudes to sex and the rudimentary technology of the period.
It is an interesting film to watch from this point of view but as a film it has dated because no viewer seeing it now would be able to see the sorts of things which viewers in 1960 saw. That is the glamour, the magnatism of the stars and a plot that in its time might have been inventive but has now been done to death.",1011139200,7,1564,4.3231292517006805

The guys shot ""Ocean's 11"" by day and took over the stage of the Copa room at night for 'The Summit,' a show filled with song parodies and racial humor that was dated even 40 years ago...
Example
Dean picks up Sammy...carries him up to the mike and announces ""I'd like to thank the B'nai Brith for this trophy.""
There's no doubt that these gentlemen were considered the zenith of Cocktail Lounge ""cool"" in 1960; they campaigned for politicians, exchanged 'broads', made movies, recorded for Frank's company and guested on each other's tv shows.
Unfortunately, the film ""Ocean's 11"" turned out to be a dull, witless bore...a heist movie with all the suspense of an afternoon in the local supermarket.
No matter...
It was a way of spending a couple of hours with the country's leading adult swingers in the city they made their playground.

and a clip from a 1977 ""Tonight"" show hosted by Sinatra with guest Angie Dickinson (who played Frank's ex-wife in the film).

Why do you think it has been unavailable for so long?  It is just that with all the pr surounding remake they thought they could sneak it in without anyone noticing it.  This is not a slur on the cast, as they set out to just have a good time, which is obviously just what they did.  However, in having such a good time they forgot a few crucial things.... such as acting, a script, a director, a plot etc etc.  Oceans 11 is great idea and in the minds of those that haven't seen in for 20 years it is still cool, but in reality it is painfully unwatchable.",1008374400,19,727,4.194244604316546

Now, I plan to see the new version of it soon and perhaps it would be interesting to see how they changed the film  to fit today's standaards. I am sure it is worth a look see for that reason alone.

301161,5,6300269299,"OCEAN'S 11 is a real time-capsule classic. The ultimate ""heist"" movie, starring The Chairman of The Board, Dino, Sammy, Joey, Peter, and the rest of The Rat Pack, this one is worth seeing just to watch ""the boys"" hanging out together and getting into trouble.

The late Fifties All-Adult ambience of Vegas is priceless, as is the hep cat cool which just oozes off the screen. Let's face it:  How many men could get away with calling the President of the United States ""Chickee Baby""? Well, Frank called JFK precisely that. Even Bill Clinton was never that swingin'!

The storyline is a standard potboiler involving a group of old Army buddies setting up the biggest theft in American history, five Vegas casinos. Frankie ain't doin' no singin', and the film's a bit slow moving in spots. They're playing it a little too straight and serious,and there are less laughs than chuckles, and no sex, but the film was a product of it's times (1960) and still had to get past the censors in those days. Peter Lawford is over the line as a forty year old Mama's Boy trying for the Big Score.

No matter how good the Clooney remake is, he won't touch this one at all...There's only one Rat Pack!

Call this an addendum:

After seeing the Clooney release of OCEAN'S 11, I decided to add a few more thoughts. Well, the new movie is ALMOST better---more action and more pacing, better scriptwriting. In short, a technically superior film in most ways, which is marred by the one thing you can't put a price tag on---the chemistry.

Although Clooney is grand (he swanks across the screen like a Bond villain on vacation), Brad Pitt is appropriately and irreverently serious, and Carl Reiner is outrageously funny, the ""new crew"" can't replicate the charisma of the Rat Pack.

Although the Eleven in both films are con artists and thieves, they are the antiheroes we all dream of. At the end of the original, you feel for the ""bad guys,"" who, after all, ain't really that bad (""Coo-coo, baby!""). The remake hardly introduces most of the Eleven, and you don't really give a Rat's Pack whether most of them get away with it or not. They're only props.

Julia Roberts is curiously flat, colorless, and dried up as Danny Ocean's wife (where in the original, Angie Dickinson was undeniably THERE in what was a really very minor role). Andy Garcia is an evil presence as the ""good guy"" casino owner.

Both films are worth your time. The one has what the other lacks. In short, if computer imnaging could ever morph the original actors into the remake, this might just be the best film ever made.",1007251200,71,2574,4.637362637362638

Everything else about this movie is legendary: the cats, the cards, the dough the heist, the attitude, the ambience, the booze, an appearance by Red Norvo backing Dean Martin on ""Ain't That a Kick In The Head"", and a bunch of guys being real guys.  Not sensitive sissy males, not trashy, not cheesy Night at The Roxbury greaseballs, but high class pallies having a good time.  In the days before dressy casual (bleh), Izod shirts (double-bleh), polyester, and before the male standard-bearers became ex-jocks in beer commercials and movies like ""Road House"" (triple-bleh) and ""Point Break"" (sextuple-bleh)...this was the living end, pure decadence, the high life personified as only Frankie and Dean could do it.

Lenny Bruce is ""cool"" to some, and Miles Davis epitomizes ""cool"" for others. For me, there isn't a man who has EVER lived who personified ""cool"" more that Mr. Sinatra. You can see what I mean here in the first motion picture that casts the infamous ""Rat Pack"" in major roles, ""Oceans 11."" Playing an ex-WWII soldier, Sinatra's Danny Oceans plans the greatest heist in history: Rob five Las Vegas casinos at once on New Year's Eve. It's a bold plot for a bold cast. There's Frank with his ""I own the world"" charisma. There's Sammy Davis Jr. with his usual flair for the song and dance routine. ""Deano"" Dean Martin also croons in the picture, and Peter Lawford, the only non-singer of the four main Rat Packers, still holds the audience with his charm and wit.
This film shows what Las Vegas was like when it was an ""adults only"" city. This was when Sinatra and his boys ruled Vegas, and we should be thankful that they had the foresight to put some of the flavor of the times on film.

Well, I will say that the sexual undertones and the comedy material was a little heavy for those times.  Nothing unusual for this day and age, but for the time when this was released, it was way ahead of it's time.

Sammy Davis singing E-O-Eleven still comes to mind when I visit Vegas today. Cameos by Shirley McLane and Red Skelton add to the good humor this film offers. Ingenous methods of breaking into the casino's, and the suspense of ""will they succeed?"" make for great entertainment.
