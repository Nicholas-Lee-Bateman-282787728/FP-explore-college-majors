7951345,5,B00005QW8R,"After trying another series of beginners' pilates workout videos for one week, I was a little discouraged and thinking that they just weren't my thing.  Then I gave it one last shot with the Zone Pilates Mat Workout.  I am glad now that I didn't quit.

Instructor Liz Gilles made this experience great and just challenging enough to give me a good muscle workout in my thighs and abs. ( I have been using the elliptical machine religiously for the past year and I thought that my thighs were perfectly worked...until now) Her instructions were clear and easy to follow.  She explained the positions and the moves in a way that made it easy for me to visualize them and get them right the first time.  Surprise!  I like pilates.

A word of caution to other beginners - this isn't an aerobic sort of workout.  You may not even break a sweat.  Still, you can expect a good stretching and toning and you will be pleasantly ""worked"" when you are done.  If you follow closely, your lower body will definitely be sore the next day.

Well recommended for those who are curious about pilates and want to give it a try before making a larger financial commitment by signing up for expensive classes or buying one of those big ball thingies.

Although I should be thankful for the amount of time spent on instruction, I was instead disappointed that I didn't feel I 'worked out' much.  Attention was given more to quality rather than quantity, which was great, but I didn't feel like I did much after the run of the tape.  After using this tape to master the Pilates moves, I will feel confident in purchasing another tape for more of a work out.",1029974400,11,458,4.3023255813953485
