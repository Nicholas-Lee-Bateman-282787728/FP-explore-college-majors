2608617,5,B000GG4Y4Q,"First of all this set is a steal when one dvd costs $20.00 it does not take a genius to know your getting three movies for the price of one.

I love all the movies in this set how could any John Hughes fan not love them.

What memories these movies bring back and I love ""getting the cast together"" on the Ferris Buller dvd. It was great to see the cast after all this time only Mia Sara and Charlie Sheen were not in the recent interviews.",1176249600,4,440,3.9886363636363638

2608666,5,B000GG4Y4Q,"No one contributed more to the image of the 80s suburban teen than John Hughes. The Too Cool for School collection contains some of his best work, and the price would be reasonable if only Ferris Bueller was in the collection. The humor, anxiety, and teen struggles still remain relevant in this work, as my children enjoy these films nearly as much as I.",1394236800,,355,4.5625

2608700,5,B000GG4Y4Q,"Would have loved if they added Weird Science and National Lampoon's Vacation but asking for more would just be too greedy. These are the definitive coming-of-age movies that will forever be the best of any kind. Also would have loved if the cases holding the separate DVDs weren't so super thin but again three awesome movies for the price of one, the satisfaction is already fulfilled.",1375488000,,386,4.863636363636363

I love Amazon!  they have become my new shopping obsession!

Very Pleased!",1348185600,,354,4.223880597014926
2608707,5,B000GG4Y4Q,These are 3 of my favorite 80s movies. I bought them for a 13 year old girl who loves to watch movies. I think she will love these classic 80s movies. I grew up watching them over and over and they never get old. I am happy to give her movies that I love in hopes she will love them too,1346025600,,286,3.7049180327868854
2608708,5,B000GG4Y4Q,"John Hughes was definitely the teen movie master in the 1980's.  Nobody has ever come close to touching him in this genre since then, and I doubt that anyone ever will.  Hughes really GOT teenagers - the way their minds worked, the struggles they went through, the way they talked, everything.  This collection - Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Pretty in Pink, and Some Kind of Wonderful - is a great way to experience the sheer genius that was John Hughes.  It's a great value, too.  I doubt you can find a better price anywhere for these three films.

One of the best things about this collection is the bonus material on each DVD.  There are interviews with the cast - which were filmed in 2006, I believe - in which they talk about their experiences during filming and their thoughts on the characters and the content of the film.  There's also footage from the 80's of John Hughes being interviewed regarding the films, and some 80's cast interview footage as well.  Sure, you'll probably only watch this material one time, but it's worth the investment.  Besides, I don't think you'd save any money by purchasing stripped-down no-bonus-material versions anyway.

I highly recommend this collection.  Each film is excellent.  I could ramble on about the plot of each movie and what my thoughts are on them, but I imagine that pretty much everyone who's considering purchasing this collection has already seen the films.  So, I'll simply end with this: Buy this collection.  It's the best price you'll find anywhere, the bonus material is great, and the nostalgia factor is through the roof.",1269043200,17,1589,4.8118081180811805
