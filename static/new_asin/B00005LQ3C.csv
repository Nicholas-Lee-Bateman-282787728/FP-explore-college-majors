7944407,5,B00005LQ3C,I have a special girl who is now 33. She sits and watches these and signs and laughs whit them. Great stuff for the little guys. She is about 3 to 4 mentally. She has even learned some things from them. Grand kids love them also.,1236124800,,229,4.0
7944408,5,B00005LQ3C,"I can't say enough about Blue's Clues!  Before we realized my son had a speech delay, he learned a lot of signs and communications through Blue's Clues and that's how we communicated with him.",1213401600,,192,4.647058823529412
7944409,3,B00005LQ3C,"I'm not really partial to this series, but the blobby blue pooch with the Bob-Saget's-younger-brother-resembling human host holds my kids' interest.  It's interactive, meaning that there is lots of dead air, as Steve pauses for the kids' response.  Is it educational?  Too early to tell, though they ask for it often and seem to love the theme song.  And that's a ""clue"" that the producers must be doing something right!",1073952000,3,420,4.957142857142857
7944410,5,B00005LQ3C,"My 21 month old loves this video.  Every night he asks for Blues Clues and flashes his hands.  He sings the songs, jumps up and waves his arms when the mail comes, and draws on his Magna Doodle every time Steve draws in his book.  He has learned his colors and shapes from this video.  One caution, in the first episode one of the clues is a cookie.  When that cookie hits the screen my son goes running for the kitchen.",1052265600,2,420,4.135802469135802
7944411,5,B00005LQ3C,"My daughter has loved Blue's Clues since she was 6 months old. Ever since her first DVD Blue's Big Musical I was forced to collect the tapes. Blue has taught her many of her first words. She said Blue, Mail, Clock and Think. Now she's 21 months and I know anything I get her with Blue on it will be her favorite. This particular video Cafe Blue is one she likes a lot. I am not sure why but I do believe it is because of the situation Steve is in when he needs to take the orders of the characters dining at the pretend restaurant. In closing I would like to say if anyone feels they need to supply their child with educational entertainment I highly recommend Blue's Clues.",1022284800,7,674,4.1923076923076925

7944413,5,B00005LQ3C,My daughter is 4 and loves the Blue's Clues tv show and videos.  If your kids like other Blue's Clues videos... this one is pretty much the same- high quality and lots of fun!,1006473600,3,175,4.147058823529412
