8676656,1,B00N9HO9GW,"Vasile Moldoveanu had a wonderful voice, but no one would suspect that to be true from this DVD.  The sound and picture are so bad that a viewer can't make a judgement about the performers.  The case says ( and I think I am translating the French correctly) that the original was a cassette and 8 mm video.  The result is so bad it should never have been  put on the market;  I know it is a DVD-R but it is the worst one I have ever bought on Amazon.  The experience is much like watching a 1950's TV with local interference so bad that the NBC peacock looks like it is shivering.  Save your dollars on this one because it is suitable only for use as a Frisbee.",1410652800,,661,4.077519379844961
