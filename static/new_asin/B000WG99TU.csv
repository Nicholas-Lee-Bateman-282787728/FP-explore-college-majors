8245108,4,B000WG99TU,"This movie is sort of a video version of a short trip through a Renaissance Festival with a simple plot.  You won't see all the acts, most notably the jousts and British Isles folk music, but the scenery and Renaissance Festival type humor are there in abundance.  If you enjoy the festival, it is worth while.  If you don't, it is probably not for you.",1388534400,,353,4.4
8245109,5,B000WG99TU,"I came upon this DVD purely by accident and found out that the players are from several Renaissance Faires I've attended throughout the Northeast. The princess is Isabelle from the Don Quan and Migel ren fair show, so are the main characters. It's not your typical hollywood flick but it has charm that might surprise you.",1322784000,,322,4.767857142857143
