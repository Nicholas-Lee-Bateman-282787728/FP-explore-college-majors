4552819,5,B0053XZ95U,"DCI Tennison gains her staff's acceptance but all is not as conciliatory with the murder investigation of a black corpse found in a black neighborhood. London's citizens and police force have some race issues. Then there's Jane's hot new ""sleep-with.""

""PRIME SUSPECT"" is also available, boxed as ""The COMPLETE COLLECTION"". A bargain compared to individual segments. If you are just finding Prime Suspect, you WILL want all 7 years. Not just tales of cops and murder, but in-your-fact realistic cop activity, which was done with so much realistic detail, it was the show to change British (and world) crime shows forever. It is the gritty type of show that all mystery film and TV now try to duplicate. Police drama was changed forever by Helen Mirren and her role as Jane Tennison.

Be aware, the cases may not always end to your satisfaction--just like real life crimes and punishment. But you will be on the edge of your seat while you watch. Compelling viewing, ruthless in the detail, definitely not for children and the squeamish, blatantly course visually and in dialogue, but oh, so realistic. This show has won 7 Emmys and always includes guest stars aplenty.

Helen Mirren makes the show as Tennison. Obsessed, work-driven, feminist attitude, course, in-your-face drive, compellingly believable, more man-like rather than the occasional romantic which does exist, she's a drinker, and she almost never smiles.

Subtitles for this series.
Tennison not only colors outside the box, she makes the box.",1314403200,5,1508,5.117886178861789

Started in 1991 and ending in 2007, every series was a hit, and done with perfection. A female cop show will never be this good again. But be warned, for language, and gritty gruesome graphic content. Tennison not only colors outside the box, she makes the box.",1295136000,4,1105,5.2727272727272725

4552826,5,B0053XZ95U,I watch this years ago I forgot how really good it was plus I never saw the ending. The downside of this if I watch it from my fire stick it forces me to buy a subscription to acorn. As soon as I finish watching I'm going to cancel the subscription.

Maybe it was the result of bad direction from the director, but by far, most of the cast was the usual high quality.  The plot was full of surprises, which is always lovely to see.

4552881,5,B0053XZ95U,"The prime suspect series is what got us hooked on British Detectives.  We still crave British mysteries while American mysteries seem repetitive and bland.  Helen Mirren is a superb actress and we never get tired of seeing her on scree.  We are repeating the Prime

4552883,3,B0053XZ95U,I thought it was a good series as I love British crime/murder mysteries. The only small complaint I have is that I did not read the series information and it was not as modern as I expected! Helen Mirren has earned her title as one of the most accomplished actors in the business and for that I am grateful. A lesser know actress would probably have been just as well as I am completely infatuated with most of what is offered to those who are not British or familiar with British cinema!

Although some of the actors in supporting roles give uneven performances, Ms. Mirren is always riveting.  The story lines are taut and the resolution to each story is, at times, surprising.

Oh, and some of the attitudes about sexism and racism.  We've come a long way since the early 1990's.  Fun to see some of the well-known British actors in their early days.  Love the plots, camera work, acting, writing.  There are always surprises in this show which keeps it original.  Like Tennison's boyfriend this season.

Helen Mirren, as always, delivers a beautiful performance, as does the entire cast, villains as well as protagonists.

It contains very adult content and the show has a fairly dark theme. However, I became so invested in Helen's ""Tennison"" character that I really wanted to know what happened to her next. This is an extremely well written, acted, and directed show.

The Prime Suspect shows always have an interesting case to solve and each show involves you in the life of Tennison. Tennison grows older in a realistic manner and her life and character change accordingly.

This episode is the dullest of them all, I think.  However, it does pick up at the end.  I liked the plot.  I like how the characters grew by the end of the season.  (It was nice to see Jerry from ""Single Ladies"" when he was younger.  He was very nice looking.)

It was interesting to see how prejudice and racial tensions were predominant in the 90s in England.  Does racial tension still exist?  There were elements of good cop, bad cop, and liability and I loved watching the inquest process.  It's interesting to see how British and American culture overlap.  Overall I enjoyed watching this season for the information and history and drama. This series is like CSI before there was a CSI.

I know Helen Mirren to be full of dignity and grace, her reserved older self.  However, when I googled her, she was quite the pretty dame back in the day, so vibrant and full of life.  She oozed charisma and beamed sunshine.  Too Cute!",1370649600,,1024,4.574585635359116

Now being older :), it's more obvious to me how serious she took her job and (in her own way) cared for people. Personally (having watch this season) I cannot imagine how it would feel to have to tell parents that the son you had in lock-up (while you were sitting in the waiting room for hours) had committed suicide.

The way she handled it was EXCELLENT and at no time ""felt"" like acting.

That said, this was really worth watching again and for those who don't mind a little real life (though from an England perspective) and grit, this may be the detective series for you.
