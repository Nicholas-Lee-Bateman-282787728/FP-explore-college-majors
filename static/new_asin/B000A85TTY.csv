2379362,1,B000A85TTY,It doesn't work.. It won't load on any DVD player I have or even on blu-Ray... It pretty much sucks.. Unhappy kids are not easy to deal with!!!,1381968000,4,143,4.142857142857143
2379363,4,B000A85TTY,"Got this for my 3 kids, and I knew this was Region 2 when I bought it hoping I could find a player in my house that would work.  I had to hack a player to play Region 2 (US is Region 1) by using codes I found on this website DVDexploder.com.  I played it and it is darker and edgier than the House of Mouse Villains DVD.  Maybe this is why it was not released in the US?  It is pretty darn scary in parts, so I will give it away to a grown up Disneyphile I know.  It is a witch trying to see which villain she will join forces with and so it gives you lots of clips from all the Disney movies with some games on there, too.  My favorite is Ursula in Little Mermaid but the rest is not very funny, just dark, but the animation and clips are beautiful to look at.",1378771200,8,761,3.7848101265822787
