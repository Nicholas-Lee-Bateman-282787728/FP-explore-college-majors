2884846,5,B000SINSZS,This is the end of a very fine series that I enjoyed to the highest extent.,1206057600,4,75,3.75
2884847,5,B000SINSZS,"As a fan of the show, I have shared in all the fortunes and mis-fortunes of the delightful characters of this enchanting highlands series.  Each season was a delight, although season six was an adjustment... Season seven brought out the very best conclusion to the series to be had. I hated to see it go, but there had to be some form of conclusion and this ending series is a satisfying one.",1202428800,6,392,4.444444444444445
2884848,5,B000SINSZS,"We fell in love with Monarch of the Glen when, by chance, we discovered the series at our public library. We were hooked! We couldn't wait for the final season's DVDs to be released. Although it only includes six episodes, Series 7 is full of surprises and the usual fun. I won't give any of that away...I'll just say that our whole family found it to wrap up with a satisfying conclusion.  We're sorry to say farewell to the delightful cast of characters and all that lovely Scottish scenery.
 If you haven't dipped into any of the Monarch of the Glen series yet, start from Series 1, gather the whole family on the couch and settle in to many hours of guaranteed entertainment--an overall feast for the eyes and the heart.",1199059200,23,724,4.519083969465649
2884849,4,B000SINSZS,"While it was sad to see the series end, I mostly enjoyed the last season.  I only wish Duncan McKay, (played by Hamish) had been more involved.  It was good to see Hector MacDonald, (played by Richard Briers) again, and it was a clever re-introduction. I only wish Alistair Mackenzie, (Archie), and Dawn Steele, (Lexie) had been available for one last hurrah, (so to speak.)  There was a bittersweet ending that will be memorable for all Monarch viewers, I wish that the ends had been tied together a little better. I guess time and finances just didn't permit.  All in all, if you've become a fan of Monarch, you won't feel right unless you pick up this last offering. It still has all of the things we've grown to love about this series, the awesome filming of the Scottish Highlands, the great characters, and the actors who portray them, and the quality we not only expect, but demand.  It's worth the money.",1195862400,55,912,4.604938271604938
2884850,5,B000SINSZS,"Fans of this series will enjoy the high note on which this series ends.  After 7 seasons of laughter and difficult times for this family, everythings ends as it should.",1195862400,10,168,4.6
2884851,5,B000SINSZS,"The Whole series is a wonderful blend of quirky characters, tradition and modern problems. The acting is superb! So Sorry to see it end. This is what American Television should strive for.",1195171200,16,188,4.90625
2884852,5,B000SINSZS,"This series from BBC Scotland was absolutly wonderful. An enthralling series about a Laird in Scotland and his family and life in the Scottish highlands. Once you get started you can't stop, it's that good.",1195084800,14,206,4.914285714285715
2884853,5,B000SINSZS,"There is an arc to all series, with a point somewhere in the middle being considered the apex. So while series 7 isn't the classic era of Monarch of the Glen it nevertheless has some great stories, quite a few endearing moments, and great acting. There are few missteps here, the primary one being Duncan's unbelievable return. I really enjoyed the Duncan McKay character but it seemed improbable that a gilly would take off for the big city to be a DJ, so perhaps that story line was destined to fall flat. However, most of the other story lines reach a satisfying conclusion.

I'll miss the folks at Glen Bogle quite a bit (including Duncan), but it was nice to have a satisfying farewell.",1194220800,34,691,4.57258064516129
2884854,2,B000SINSZS,"This Series REALLY fell off.  If the actors playing Archie and Kilwillie in particular, wanted off the show after we'd already lost Hector MacDonald, they should have called it COMPLETE while they were ahead. By the end here, even Duncan and Molly come in and out, Lexie has gone to New Zealand, and the off beat humor in the interactions of stable characters, has lost its way. It's just slapstick and silly.",1438128000,,409,4.680555555555555
2884855,5,B000SINSZS,We have enjoyed this series.,1436832000,,28,4.8

2884858,5,B000SINSZS,I love this series.,1430265600,,19,4.0
2884859,5,B000SINSZS,Absolutely loved the series. Watched all six seasons on Netflix but it was missing the seventh and season finale. Bought the DVD of season seven from Amazon and it is well worth it. It really wraps up the series in a nice package with a great interview with all the cast members at the end.,1428624000,,290,4.290909090909091
2884860,1,B000SINSZS,"I find the greed and extrortionate practices of Amazon prime to be disgusting.  I pay for prime with intent to watch free streaming of older shows but they exlude the ones I would like and offer many I can catch on regular or cable tv.  Netflix offered all except season seven and even with the higher annual fee, Amazon also forces me to pay addition to prime if I want the 7th season.  Amazon greed is unethical and would be criminal in a non coroporate controlled society.  Swallow your billions and digest in hell billionaiires.",1426982400,,532,4.568421052631579
2884861,5,B000SINSZS,"Good story line, beautiful Scottish scenery, great actors.  I feel like I am there...vacation visiting a modern day Lord of the Glen facing the joy of life in the grand mountains of Scotland while struggling to survive.  A plus is they entertain without profanity or nudity...a rare gift these days.",1424390400,,299,4.96
2884862,5,B000SINSZS,"I love this series. Trials, tribulations, humor and joy of living in a Scottish castle",1423008000,,86,4.8
2884863,5,B000SINSZS,I loved watching this series. It's family oriented which I like. The views of highland Scotland are stunning. The characters are likable and the story line is easy to follow. I'm just like a lot of others who have watched the first 6 seasons and wanted to know what happens with the last season. Glad I bought it.,1420588800,,313,4.413793103448276
2884864,5,B000SINSZS,"Sent quickly, enjoyed very much!",1420588800,,32,5.6
2884865,5,B000SINSZS,"Loved the series and needed to see how it ended. Great scenery, good storyline and good use of backstory to make an almost total change in characters and storyline flow. The end was a little slow but given the nature of the changes, to be expected.",1420329600,,248,4.413043478260869
2884866,5,B000SINSZS,Love this show! Wish there were more seasons.,1419811200,,45,4.75
2884867,4,B000SINSZS,"Enjoyed the entire series, fun and interesting.",1419811200,,47,5.857142857142857
2884868,4,B000SINSZS,Enjoyed seeing the last series. I understand why it stopped as they changed so many of the original characters that made it so interesting,1417392000,,138,4.791666666666667
2884869,5,B000SINSZS,We enjoyed the whole series tremendously...It was great to be able to view the last season of Monarch of the Glen by purchasing it through Amazon.,1416960000,,146,4.653846153846154

2884871,5,B000SINSZS,Favorite series of all time.  scenery and actors were wonderful.,1413244800,,64,5.4
2884872,3,B000SINSZS,"..unless you want to turn it around on ebay. You probably have figured it out at end of Six.  Frankly if you're looking for Duncan the clown to have large role... he doesnt.  And that's the best part.

It does wrap everything up.  As well as it can be, I suppose.",1412812800,,263,4.098039215686274

2884874,4,B000SINSZS,Excellent conclusion to the entire series. Had to buy it because only seasons 1 thru 6 were available on Netflix.,1412208000,,113,4.7
2884875,4,B000SINSZS,Thought they would return all the beginning stars but didn't. Hated to see series end.,1411430400,,86,4.8
2884876,3,B000SINSZS,"Pretty good series overall, but often - between seasons - there was a disjointed storyline.  Note: Series 7 does not have CC (closed captions), although the DVD box shows CC.  Lack of CC made the 2-DVD set unwatchable.  Disappointed.",1409961600,2,233,4.923076923076923
2884877,5,B000SINSZS,"Netflix doesnt carry Season 7, so what is one to do but to just buy it?  Worth every penny.  And you even get to see some old friends from previous seasons...",1409788800,,158,4.064516129032258
2884878,5,B000SINSZS,"My all-time 2nd favorite TV series. Downton Abbie is first, of course. I love the characters in Monarch. The scenery is spectacular. I wish there were a Monarch of the Glen II.",1409097600,,176,4.53125
2884879,5,B000SINSZS,"I got hooked on this series on netflix. Loved it, but hated to see the original cast change so quickly. I still loved to see the landscape. Awesome!",1408579200,,148,4.321428571428571
2884880,4,B000SINSZS,"after seeing one year of this show I just had to get on amazon
and by the other six!  Was really disappointed when it was
discontinued!  The only thing that was disappointing was
that some of the characters that one become fond of
disappeared from the show!  Other than that, if you
like British TV you will enjoy it.",1405296000,,317,4.338983050847458
2884881,5,B000SINSZS,I enjoyed this series!,1405036800,,22,4.75
2884882,4,B000SINSZS,"The first 3 series were wonderful, but as with many TV series, characters change.  Series 7 was good in that it wound up some story lines but I was hoping for some of the original stars to be back...Hector was, more or less, and I was happy with Molly and Golly's stories.",1402963200,,272,4.230769230769231
2884883,5,B000SINSZS,I thought it was the perfect ending to a series that I loved. With that being said I do wish there were a few more series since I enjoyed it so much.,1401580800,,149,3.6875
2884884,5,B000SINSZS,"Although this review is intended for Series 7 of Monarch of The Glen I have rated it a 5 because I enjoyed the entire series. If you are just buying this particular CD which is Series 7 I would advise you not to purchase it just to watch this last season. The wife and I started watching Monarch of The Glen on Netflix and watched 6 seasons of the show. Series 7 was not on Netflix so we bought the CD to see the conclusion. This series has a continuing storyline beginning with Series 1, Episode 1 so to completely understand the story line it is essential to start from the beginning to see how the story unfolds up to Series 7, Episode 7. Yes, you will enjoy the humor and comedy if you begin watching in the middle somewhere but not near as much as watching the complete series to watch the story complete story line unfold and the characters develop. The story takes place in the Scotland Highlands and the scenery is beautiful.",1401062400,4,933,4.337142857142857
2884885,3,B000SINSZS,"The only issue I have with the ending is that too many important characters had exited for all loose ends to be tied up in a completely emotionally satisfying way. But the final season, like the series as a whole, is well done. I like the first three seasons best, but all of it is good.",1398988800,,287,4.142857142857143
2884886,4,B000SINSZS,This last season did a decent job of winding up the saga.  Both story and production quality stay high.  Enjoyable.,1398902400,,115,4.7
2884887,5,B000SINSZS,Watched 6 series on Netflix streaming.  I am so glad I ordered  season 7 from Amazon.  It was just as entertaining as the previous episodes.  What a heartwarming and beautiful way to end. Or maybe I'll just start watching them all again.,1398729600,,237,4.571428571428571
2884888,3,B000SINSZS,I would not recommend the DVD's for anyone hard of hearing.. We watched 6 seasons on netflix and were able to have subtitles. The DVD did not allow for CC so we had to watch without understanding much. We were able to get most of the story from the action on the screen.,1398124800,,270,4.113207547169812
2884889,5,B000SINSZS,"I enjoyed all of the previous seasons, and found this to be a worthy successor to them. A very good buy.",1398038400,,104,4.0
2884890,5,B000SINSZS,"Absolutely the BEST!!!!!
Gotta watch this and you will be hooked on it!
It is a family series and we have enjoyed every minute!",1396483200,,127,4.333333333333333
2884891,5,B000SINSZS,"Sad to see that this is the last of the great series Monarch of the Glen, but there are really good stories here, I missed the heck out of Duncan, but he does make a repeat visit in one of the episodes. I wish Archie and Lexie would have come back for the finale, and Duncan for more than a two word line and a second long appearance. But there is a surprise return that you would never guess in the finale  and that was fun.and a VERY surprising revelation by Golly that I never saw coming. I can never understand why great series such as Monarch of the Glen and Ballykissangel only last 6 or 7 seasons but repetitious shows like Last of the Summer Wine, etc where every episode is just like the last one, with the same antics and the same jokes and the same incidents last forever. I find that very hard to understand. This DVD is closed captioned in English for the hearing impaired.",1394323200,,886,4.242603550295858
2884892,2,B000SINSZS,"We need CC and it didn't have it so we ended up watching it on the computer , we had watched the first 6 series on Netflix",1391990400,2,122,3.5555555555555554
2884893,1,B000SINSZS,"the acting is lame and the story line is sub pair, but this is just my opinion, i would rather watch Top Gear",1391040000,,109,3.782608695652174
2884894,4,B000SINSZS,My mom got hooked on the series on Netflix and but they didn't have the final season.  So I jumped on Amazon and bought it for her.  It arrived pretty quick,1389484800,,156,4.0
2884895,5,B000SINSZS,Sorry the series endedexcellent !  Lots of cometic  moments and tears would recommend this series for  all ages..glad I watched the complete series,1388707200,,147,5.304347826086956
2884896,5,B000SINSZS,"I had watched the rest of the series a while back, and (im)patiently waited for the final season to show up on Amazon Prime, but no luck. And having seen the rest, I was curious how the writers wrapped everything up. so I bought the last season.

They didn't disappoint me. Many of the original cast had departed over the years, but the new members were just as likable, and a few originals returned for a couple of episodes in the last season, one in a rather interesting way.

All turned out well, with a few bumps in the road, and it's the perfect wrap-up for a delightful series.",1388707200,2,583,4.339449541284404

2884901,5,B000SINSZS,"Its a good show. Its funny and sad, also it resembles real problems and solutions. Its also has great scenery!",1383782400,,110,4.55
2884902,5,B000SINSZS,I loved Monarch of the Glen!!  The only negative:  it absolutely needed sub-titles.  Hard to understand the language.  A Texan trying to understand the Scots.,1383609600,3,158,5.2
2884903,5,B000SINSZS,Loved it really nice way to end the show!! It wrapped up all the story lines and paired everyone off  happily.,1381536000,,110,4.238095238095238
2884904,4,B000SINSZS,"The  first DVD is poorly made. It freezes throughout. Great series, but DVD a disappointment due to freezing frames. Hopefully just a dud and the rest will be ok. Very frustrating.",1380931200,,180,4.806451612903226
2884905,5,B000SINSZS,I loved this series.  I thought that when they changed characters I would not like it but all of the actors were great and the storyline was very good and they blended the new with the old so well it didn't matter.  I wish that it never ended :-),1379980800,,246,4.0
2884906,5,B000SINSZS,Really enjoyed the last series where story lines were completed. Don't know why this season is not included in Netflix.,1379808000,,119,5.0
2884907,5,B000SINSZS,We watched Series 1-6 on Netflix so just had to find out how it all ends. Great series to watch over and over again!!,1379289600,,117,3.9166666666666665
2884908,5,B000SINSZS,"Watched this entire series through Netflix, and decided it was worth owning & sharing with family and friends.  Happy to have found this complete 7 season series on Amazon!  You'll love the scenery and adore the quirky characters!",1379030400,,230,5.026315789473684
2884909,5,B000SINSZS,"Even though the characters changed over time, the Glen remained the same and it was enjoyable to ""visit."" Molly was the thread that seemed to hold the whole series together.",1378425600,,173,4.8
2884910,3,B000SINSZS,Worth watching but video isn't in high definition so kind of blurry. Other than that a fun watch. :)) :),1375747200,,104,4.25
2884911,4,B000SINSZS,"This series is something to watch relax and enjoy. It will not give you the stress of the usual melodrama or the violent action  spree of most series today. Is fresh,funny and has  a little of light drama.",1375488000,,205,4.368421052631579

Love the storyline and the scenery.
The casting is genius. So entertaining.
Makes you want to live at Glenboggle.",1373932800,,207,4.777777777777778
2884914,5,B000SINSZS,"Our viewing of Monarch of the Glen was followed almost immediately by a driving tour of England and Scotland with intermittent stays in some very interesting castles. GlenBogle and the Laird are in many ways the personification of many different land & castle owners struggling to keep their ancestoral homes from the developer's bulldozer. Some succeed and some, sadly do not. Darwin applied to Scottish highlands. Too many loose ends in the last episodes but all in all, great fun.",1373241600,,483,5.05
2884915,5,B000SINSZS,"I was so sad when I watched the last of Monarch of the Glen.  I felt like I was loosing my family.  Very endearing and heartwarming series.  So wonderful to watch a show with clean language and no gross tv sex.
Each character brought its own flavor to the mix of this wonderful cast.  I love Scotland, so this was a travel log as well for me.
The scenery was so beautiful and the setting of the castle ideal.  Makes one  have the urge to go there and visit.
One more thing, I loved the fact that in this series the upstairs and downstairs, for the exception of the senior Laird, had a community life style.  All human beings making the most out of life, supporting each other.  RARE...",1372809600,,685,4.255813953488372
2884916,5,B000SINSZS,This is a fantastic series and even though the cast changed a lot through the years my family still enjoyed the cast during the last season.  It's a fun show to watch with beautiful scenery.,1372118400,,190,4.428571428571429
2884917,5,B000SINSZS,"We had been watching and thoroughly enjoying Monarch of the Glen through the six seasons available on Netflix. We completed Season 6's final episode and ran out of story. Yikes! We were confirmed ""Boglies"" by that time (though we didn't have a clue what that might be before we marched through the 6 seasons). How could we get 7th season right away? Amazon to the rescue! It was a little confusing in terms of which of the 2-DVD sets to buy, but we went with the Amazon-stocked item at about $25 at the time. It worked out perfectly, we finished the series, and we were able to play a ""Special Features"" documentary about the last episode of the series to cap things off. If you have any inclination to see all of what Monarch of the Glen offers, take the opportunity to order the final season from Amazon, get the special features, and you'll have that, regardless. May it please you as much as it pleases us. -JM",1371081600,14,914,4.446428571428571

2884921,5,B000SINSZS,"How could you not order Season 7 of Monarch after being riveted by the familiar family of characters for 6 seasons. Since Netflix doesn't carry the last season, there was no option but to order it here...there had to be closure and all those nasty ends needed tying up. Enjoyed it!",1369008000,,281,4.529411764705882
2884922,4,B000SINSZS,"After watching the endless series, and enjoying every minute of it, I found it impossible to survive the departure of Lexi for ""New Zealand,"" as I always thought Archie would come back. That would have been the right ending for me, for I always rooted for her strong presence, common sense, likeability, self-reliance, and good looks. She made a man of Archie--or in the process of doing so--when he ... left us abruptly,the magic for me was broken at that point. You couldn't keep Lexi there,vulnerable under the constant stares of Paul. And Paul was an intruder, not exactly sincere or totally likeable. The ""Monarch"" should have been Archie, married to Lexi. Just like Darcy and Elizabeth in P&P. I have genuinely liked the series to have been shorter, so the original actors could be retained, for the right ending. Too bad... and oh, well! we can't always have what we want, even in fiction.",1368316800,5,896,4.787096774193548

2884924,5,B000SINSZS,So happy to have purchased this DVD.  We watched the first 6 seasons on Netflix. I was delighted when I found out there was a 7th season available at Amazon. It was the perfect ending to a cherished TV show.,1366243200,2,207,4.175

2884926,5,B000SINSZS,"We thoroughly enjoyed this series and highly recommend it to everyone. Morals, ethics,ettiquet....all things we need to work on in today world.",1363996800,,143,5.545454545454546
2884927,5,B000SINSZS,"The story line is captivating and the scenery is beyond description.  Some the characters who were written out of the series were sorely missed because upon watching the programs, a person soon began to feel as though they were actually friends.
Series six was a bit tedious, but series seven gave a good conclusion, overall.  We missed it after it was over.",1363824000,,358,4.758064516129032
2884928,5,B000SINSZS,"I was hooked on Monarch of the Glen from the very first episode.  I haven't been so besotted with a TV show since I was in love with Dallas, so many, many years ago.  I have been watching two to four episodes each day and dread the day when I have seen the last one.  Netflix only had the series through Season 6, episode 10, so now I will have to buy Season 7 from Amazon. I can hardly wait to see how this will end.",1363651200,,417,3.8255813953488373
2884929,4,B000SINSZS,"We love period dramas.  This one could have ended after the 4th Season.  It just wasn't the same after some of the
major characters left.  I still recommend it if you love these drama series.",1361836800,,191,4.4
2884930,3,B000SINSZS,"The series went downhill after the original characters left. it was not bad though, just that we were spoiled by the first 3",1356048000,4,124,4.434782608695652
2884931,5,B000SINSZS,I'm a dyed-in-the-wool Monarch of the Glen fan.  I particularly love season 7 as Molly and Golly finally get together like we all thought they should.  I've been to Scotland several times and it looks just as magical as shown on Monarch.,1330214400,,237,4.619047619047619
2884932,5,B000SINSZS,Excellent series all the way!  We loved it and had to buy series 7.  It was well worth it.,1309478400,,90,3.6842105263157894
2884933,4,B000SINSZS,"A great Series, however I did not like the ending, seemed to much, too fast and left me feeling incomplete. Too bad the first Couple left so soon, I felt that could have been explored further, it was almost like two separate series and the spontaneity was lost. The series introduced me to the beauty of Scotland hidden in it's Glens.",1298073600,,334,4.491803278688525
2884934,5,B000SINSZS,"The complete Monarch of the Glen (a total of 7 series, about 22 discs) is for me one of the best BBC drama series, or in fact in my opinion the best drama series ever made.
A wonderful cast, beautiful surroundings, The GlenBogle estate where almost everything takes place, a breathtaking Scottish scenery and last but not least not to forget the superb music which makes it all so complete.
Series 7 was sadly enough the last series to be made, but after a somewhat less series 6. Series 7 made it all to a very satisfying series with a more than happy ending.
In one word English Entertainment with a capital E!",1291852800,3,612,4.424778761061947

2884936,3,B000SINSZS,"With the last 3 series, (5,6,7) major cast changes were made.  That in and of itself wasn't to bad but the thread of the story was rushed, often times incomplete leaving a viewer wondering what was going on or asking themselves did we miss something.  Would not recommend.",1277337600,2,272,4.645833333333333
2884937,1,B000SINSZS,"I was really looking forward to see this DVD, but it does not work. I live in Norway and my DVD-player does not accept the USA/Canda sone.  On the DVD cover it says for sale in the USA and Canada only!!!!!!!!!",1271635200,,209,4.097560975609756
2884938,5,B000SINSZS,"In all honesty, for the first part of this series, I would give it a one star rating.  Maybe even a half-a-star if Amazon allowed for it.  As the plots are very predictable and the characters acting but not really feeling it.  I don't think the writers gave them much to feel and portray in this series.  However, that being said, the final episode redeems it all.  We are treated to the presence of Hector once again in the final episode.  And his presence is proof that the entire series would have fared much better had he stayed with the show.  He just energizes the screen in a one of a kind way.  And the wedding scene between Iona, MacGregor, and Paul has an interesting and exciting turn of events that is thrilling to the heart of any romantic female.  Truthfully, nobody ends up with who I would have picked for them.  Molly doesn't end up with Killwillie, even though he's very much in love with her and nice to her.  To me, Duncan as likeable as he is, just doesn't fit Jess somehow.  And I personally couldn't stand Ewan who is the cook.  Nonetheless, for anyone who has watched the series, I recommend this installment.  Just for the final episode.",1266710400,5,1162,4.4454976303317535
2884939,5,B000SINSZS,Somewhat dissappointing that Archie and Lexie didn't make a return home to reunite with family but it was good to see Hector and Duncan. I highly recommend this collection to those enjoying comedy with a bit of drama and mystery.,1236211200,,229,4.75
2884940,5,B000SINSZS,At last we saw the final season and episode bringing this wonderful series to a close.  Too bad there aren't more.  We loved it!,1232755200,,128,4.291666666666667
2884941,5,B000SINSZS,The characters in this program began to feel like family. You are transported to another way of life and it's simply marvelous!,1227052800,9,127,4.818181818181818
2884942,5,B000SINSZS,"I still have to watch this DVD ~ only because it is the final of seven years worth of programming and I am still catching up ~ but I feel I know enough of the series to give an opinion...I have been a fan of the show for several years, and being a Scot myself, I have a built-in affinity to the locale.
The storyline is unique, with humor, drama, family relationships and mishaps, told with warmth and a wonderful backdrop of the Scottish highlands thrown in for good measure.
The characters are wonderfully written and the cast does each of them justice in their portrayals...from the lowliest Gilly to the very Laird himself...which, in this particular household, is not too far apart. :)
I would watch this series over and over again, 24/7 if I could.",1222732800,4,754,4.510948905109489

8205338,5,B000SINSZS,"I had watched this series on PBS years ago, and I already owned series 1 through 6 on DVD.  Series-7 completed the collection for me, and the price was very good. By the way, Tom Baker starred in series-6 and 7 - which is a plus for me and made the show worth purchasing.",1466812800,,271,4.018518518518518

8205342,4,B000SINSZS,"Overall, I would give the entire series 5 stars, but am giving 4 for the last part of the series. It's a show that anyone over the age of 12 can watch because there's scarcely a curse word and no real suggestive scenes or topics. That doesn't stop it from being interesting and engaging  - this show truly rocks!  Just look at its high star rating! Best of all one can learn a bit about estate land owners (Laird's) and certain customs even in modern Scotland.... and the series scenery is spectacular!. All the characters fit well and are just quirky enough to add humor and steal your heart. At times a couple of them annoyed me but then again the writers have something to do with that. Having said all the positives and there are plenty...the last leg of the Glenbogle journey falls somewhat flat which is what so often happens with really great shows who begin losing characters or adding new ones along the way. I would argue that ""Duncan"" and ""Kilwilley"" (actor Julian Fellows who breaks your heart each time he's put aside) who teased us with their returns and of course initially the loss of ""Hector"" was the most difficult. I absolutely adored their characters! Lexie and Archie while essential, for me, became the signal for the needed change in order for the McDonalds and Glenbogle estate to make transitions. Finally, I believe they should have stretched the final series to at least 9 episodes and hadn't spent so much time on certain story lines when it was clearly winding down. I'm so grateful that Molly and Golly characters were steadfast til the end. That continuity made up for the significant changes which sometimes were hard to accept as the show needed the strength of their characters. Long LIVE the people of the glen!",1444262400,,1746,4.665584415584416
