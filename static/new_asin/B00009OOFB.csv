1885995,5,B00009OOFB,"once again there will be a movie that will revive the little known facts fo the civil war.  Jeff Shaara's masterpiece Gods and generals is relieved in epic porportions on the screen.  The characters are alive and vibrant, you will be transported to the time and you will feel the power of these great men.",1045526400,15,305,4.527272727272727
1885996,5,B00009OOFB,"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed Gods and Generals & The Killer Angels, as well as having seen Gettysburg, I was eagerly anticipating the film version of G&G.  Although I was somewhat apprehensive going in, I must say that I came away pleasantly surprised and invigorated by its masterful transformation to the big screen.  How many times do you leave the theater after a movie saying, ""The book was better""?  Well, shockingly, Gods and Generals is just as amazing on screen as it is in book form.
Stephen Lang is dead-on as Stonewall.  Robert Duvall makes for a more convincing Lee than the liberal pacifist Martin Sheen did in Gettsyburg.  Furthermore, the battle scenes of Fredericksburg and Chancelorsville come to life with incredible vitality and gruesome, yet realistic, violence, that make for a much more compelling movie than the constrained made-for-tv Gettysburg.
I was on the edge of my seat for the whole epic ride.  Read the book beforehand if possible, but nonetheless, you will enjoy the movie if you don't. FYI: look for Ted Turner as well as Senator Robert Byrd(Confederate General Sims) in cameos.  Enjoy.",1045526400,30,1127,5.026881720430108
1885997,5,B00009OOFB,"This is a LONG film, but worth it.  Stephen Lang's portayal of Stonewall Jackson is incredibly compelling.  Though disturbing, this is something every American should watch; it offers many lessons on the reality of war.",1045267200,14,219,5.228571428571429
1885998,5,B00009OOFB,"It is a rare movie made today this is not ""based"" on a true story - instead, that ""IS a true story"".  I find it refreshing to see characters and history portrayed as they actually were - not a blur of reality and fiction.  Though there are some imperfections, the historical accuracy is beyond what I have seen in years.  The historical accuracy allows presenting issues normally risky, including issues of their time and ours - such as politics, race, and god. This is done even handedly...opening eyes and letting one individually consider them.  This movie is a gem and I am thankful for its production.",1044576000,44,606,4.688679245283019
1885999,5,B00009OOFB,"""Gods and Generals"" easily surpasses it's predecessor ""Gettysburg"" and lays claim to the distinction of being the finest film ever made dealing with the Civil War. Although Ken Burns PBS documentary ""The Civil War"" is the gold standard for documentaries, ""G&G"" will capture the audience's attention and imagination from the very beginning to the final curtain like no other film has done before.
Here are, IMHO, the ""pros"":
Outstanding cinematography
Authentic period sets
Impressive performances delivered by Stephen Lang (Jackson), Jeff Daniels (Chamberlain), Robert Duvall (R.E. Lee), Kevin Conway (Sgt. 'Buster' Kilrain), Sean Pratt (Dr. Hunter McGuire)
Outstanding special visual effects, including
Computer Generated Imagery
Sound editing
Superb soundtrack score by John Frizzell, including the hauntingly beautiful ""Going Home"" by Mary Fahl, and Appalachia echoing ""Cross The Green Mountain"" by Bob Dylan
Re-enactors demonstrated higher authenticity standards than in film ""Gettysburg"".
Now for the ""cons"":
Minor special effects shortcomings. (Ironically, as CGI becomes more frequently used in Cinema, and as viewing audiences become more and more sophisticated, CGI use becomes all the more obvious. However, this more of an industry wide criticism rather than a direct negative criticism of the movie itself.)
Deleted battles - Antietam/Sharpsburg (will be included in the Director's cut version when released)
Some deviation's from Jeff Shaara's book, albeit in retrospect, they do not detract from the overall storyline.
Overall:
Definitely destined to become a classic in it's own right. Powerful imagery grabbed me from the very beginning (which included the fluttering of many well known regimental flags) and continues throughout. The sequence at 1st Manassas where Jackson successfully shores up the faltering Confederate battle line imbues the film with the cacophony of sounds and confusion of battle (similar to Saving Private Ryan) and immerses the audience into the middle of the fray as a participant, rather than from the perspective of a ""mere"" spectator, and continues throughout the film.
The Battle of Fredricksburg, Marye's Height segment is faithfully recreated as the audience witnesses regiment after regiment being committed piecemeal fashion in the hopeless Federal endeavor. Stirringly poignant in this sequence is the Irish Brigade advancing up the heights only to be met by Cobb's 24th Georgia, also made up of mostly Irish immigrants. Also, the horrifying aftermath of Marye's Heights, in human terms, is conveyed with chilling effect.
Maxwell also does a superb job in combining the audio/visual elements for Jackson's flank march at Chancellorsville. By taking John Frizzell's ""VMI Will Be Heard From Today"" score and blending it with the visual swiftness of of the surging Rebel tide, Maxwell places the audience on the precipice of an irresistible wave about to crash into Oliver Howard's XI Corps.
Stephen Lang is outstanding as the fervently spiritual General Jackson, which in my opinion should earn him at least a ""nod"" from the Motion Picture Academy.
I could go on an on, but suffice it to say, you won't be disappointed. It appears the Civil War living history and reenacting community has their very own ""Patriot"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" in ""Gods and Generals"".",1044489600,41,3313,5.536489151873767
1886000,4,B00009OOFB,"I was a big fan of Maxwell's Gettysburg and I'm excited by the glimpses of the trailer for the new film Gods and Generals too.  It looks great.  I'm a little disappointed that Tom Berenger is not reprising his role as Gen. Longstreet, but I do like that Robert Duvall has replaced Martin Sheen.  I think Duvall will do a much better job.",1040342400,7,337,4.317460317460317
1886001,4,B00009OOFB,"The movie ""Gods and Generals"" is much better then the book. The movie is based on the novel ""Gods and Generals"" as well as on James Robertson's ""Stonewall Jackson"". In the movie, the director attempts to remove most of the innacuracies of the novel, while still keeping the storyline and flow intact.
  The special effects totally outdo it's predecessor, and the fact that the budget was over twice as much didn't hurt. The more stringent process of choosing reenactor extras was attempted, but falls short. There won't be any santa clause soldiers like in the opening of Gettysburg, but the Tubby Bearded Guys and Ravioli are still there. ... The only reason that I don't give this film 5 stars is because of the TBGS, modern haircuts, and real rebels. Not necessarily the fault of the film crew or director, but the faults of the reenactors themselves who don't care about history or doing it right.
  If you enjoyed the movie ""Gettysburg"", the novel ""Gods and Generals"", or anything Civil War at all, you will want to see this film. The battle scenes alone are spectacular, with the early-war uniforms present at manassas, and the frosted dead bodies at Fredericksburg. Nice details in there.

1886008,5,B00009OOFB,"The extended director's cut is far better than the theatrical release version of this classic movie. Yes, it's 280 minutes long - more than 4 hours - but the added footage goes a long way toward fleshing out the epic story. I was delighted to see that Heros von Borcke, a Prussian cavalry officer who joined the Confederate cause and rode with J.E.B. Stuart, has a couple of scenes in the extended version.

1886009,4,B00009OOFB,"This is for Civil War aficionados only, but the battle re-enactments are superb. There's some sappy dialogue and scenes, and Stonewall Jackson's eccentricities are downplayed a lot to make him a more ""sympathetic"" character. The battles are Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville only, skipping a lot in between, especially Jackson's Shenandoah Valley campaign. But heck, the movie is 4.5 hours as it is.

Jackson is the main focus of the movie, though Duvall's Lee is well-played. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain is a secondary focus, with a few scenes of John Wilkes Booth oddly inserted into the mix. Lincoln only gets a bit part, as does McClellan. (Fine, Little Mac stank as a general, though he probably should've been included more in the Antietam scenes).

Watch this for the battle scenes only, which are heart-pounding and well done. The rest is mediocre dialogue and acting. If you don't have a good grasp of the Civil War, a lot of this might be confusing, or even dull, to you.",1517097600,,1003,5.0

1886011,4,B00009OOFB,"I bought the Bluray to have a copy of the painstakingly authentic depiction of Civil War battles in high definition detail.  It was made by the same production group that produced the film Gettysburg, and I was impressed by their attention to detail in that film after I visited that battlefield.  I got my moneys worth here, as the optics are phenomenal.  I felt like I was in a time machine!  This was filmed with little CGI special effects, but instead they used armies of re-enactment volunteers who were happy to play their role in return for a hefty contribution to Civil War battlefield preservation.  The film does well in preserving the costumes, technology, and issues of a complex war.

The films has been expanded as a Directors Cut that restores the Battle of Antietam and other scenes, making it even longer.  The critics hated the film because of various reasons, including the excessive length of the film.  It should have been three films!  Dont try to watch this in one setting.

The second objection was the acting and dialogue.  There is some point there perhaps, but some of the more wordy elements of the film dialogue were the film makers attempt to orient the audience to the issues and motivations of the Civil War.  That is now very necessary, as there is much more to the Civil War than just slavery.  Robert E. Lee, the Civil War general, was anti-slavery, for example.  This background detail is what makes this film slower than Gettysburg.  With that earlier film, you didn't get as much back story of any of the combatants or discourses on their motives.  Thats worth some digression.  As for the acting, it looked good to me.  In real war, people don't wear their feelings on their shift sleeves.  I think moderns are also uncomfortable with conversation that includes reference to Jesus, but that was part of the conversational flavor of the era.  If they all talked like we do, it wouldn't have an authentic flavor, would it?

Another objection to the film was the claim that it was sympathetic to the Confederate perspective.  Here is one reason for that impression.  Most of the battles were fought on Confederate turf, and any representation of the civilians would necessarily involved pro-Confederate sympathies of the locals.  The reality is that some people act heroically for an ill-fated cause.  They spent more time showcasing General Stonewall Jackson more than any other character, and he was very Southern.

This film helps fill the vacuum in that most public school education leaves.  It personalizes the war, and shows the complexity in battles that usually get a sentence in most texts.  If the length of the battle sequences seems unendurable, imagine what it was to live it.  And, as I said, the depiction of the towns and countryside seems to be amazingly realistic.

Some reviewers didn't like the scene involving Jackson having an intense emotional reaction to the death of a child of his acquaintance, whereas he had been stoic through so much carnage.  It certainly helps humanize the character, and given the enormity of the stress of war, I didn't have an issue with it.",1514937600,2,3128,4.834274952919021

1886020,3,B00009OOFB,"Not so glad I have this in my collection. Maybe an upcoming donation to the local library is in order.

This is basically the prequel to Gettysburg (which I didn't disdain as much), with the disadvantage of having been produces later, which saddles it with that ""oh, by the way"" afterthought feel. The cover is somewhat deceiving, as this is primarily a story told from Stonewall Jackson's perspective. The sections including him have a 1950s movie-making feel, right down to the swelling music. All in all it's OK from a historical perspective, but if you don't favor the southern rationale for rebelling against the Union, expect to be challenged in your thinking -- although I must say some of the exposition feels half-hearted, as if trying to thread the needle between modern politically correct thinking and a fair but not too gushing take on southern Confederate sentiments. Perhaps this in-between approach is what robs it of impact.",1511395200,,941,4.993630573248407

1886022,5,B00009OOFB,"Absolutely masterful portrayal of Robert E. Lee by Robert Duvall. Other actors were top notch as well. Treatment of the Civil War is even-handed and fair, unlike what we see today.",1510876800,,180,4.838709677419355
1886023,5,B00009OOFB,"This film garnered much flak upon its 2003 release, the bulk of which can be traced to its explicitly sympathetic (though by no means steadfastly pious or uncritical) portrayal of the Southern Confederacy, which is highly offensive to liberal orthodoxy, and particularly at odds with the totalitarian progressive political sensibilities of the majority of established film and media critics.  In addition to this, there is a general antipathy in contemporary American culture to the grand, elevated language and themes exhibited in Gods and Generals, and especially the recurrent, unvarnished, and unapologetic display of fervent religiosity, all of which are very authentic to the period.  Concerning the latter point, it bears noting the oddness of people showing up to see a movie called ""Gods and Generals"", and then at length taking umbrage at the fact that such a movie would be permeated with talk about God.

The fact is that the culture of nineteenth century America, particularly for the upper classes comprising the aristocracies of both North and South, was heavily steeped in the Greek and Roman classical culture of antiquity and in Victorian manners and decorum.  While some of the dialogue may thus appear stilted or stodgy to a contemporary viewer accustomed to hearing historical figures anachronistically mouth unpolished vernacular or even slang, it is nevertheless an honest representation of the tastes, language, and preoccupations of the people of that time.  The critics may not like this stylistic choice, but to object to it as in itself indicative of ""woodenness"" and ""empty bombast"" is simply obtuse.

Then there are the multiple disparate story strands which crop up in different places and that do not, in the manner of a commonplace story-driven commercial film, serve as mere perfunctory devices deployed to prop up a single, overarching dramatic line, but rather terminate vaguely, unsettling churlish minds bent on a callow aesthetic of blunt, orderly functionality, while augmenting the complex beauty of the whole.  Whereas Gods and Generals attempts to put forth a visual-poetic panopticon of competing allegiances and cultures, modern philistine tastes perversely demand a distinct locus of drama and a bludgeoning narrative that cuts through with unmistakable clarity and purpose;  a conventional dramatic thrust and a relentless, focused tension building toward a clear denouement in which all elements issue logically and compellingly in a final moment of completion, conviction, and certainty.  It demands the aggressive vapidity of ""plain"" vernacularized language (misleadingly regarded as ""more authentic"") and straightforward narrative gestures and dialogue, to shepherd the viewer through without too much recourse to effort or imagination, and with few unguarded detours.  Far from falling short of any such spurious ideals, Maxwell's creation strives to furnish a very different kind of cinematic experience, one that is episodic and contemplative, poetic and solemn, besides being far deeper.  The downside of this is, of course, that those accustomed to the drivel of easy-flowing, low-investment light entertainment which routinely fills the multiplexes, will find it an unbearably ponderous slog full of pompous affectation and ""boring"" speeches.  Apropos to this, I have only to cite in response Schopenhauer's dictum concerning the unfortunate collision of certain kinds of heads with certain kinds of great works.  Comparably apt in this connection, is the ancient Roman expression: ""similis simili gaudet.""

Gods and Generals eschews the familiar tone and stylistic conventions of such superficially gratifying cliche and instead attempts to inspire us with a painterly visual grandeur, and by evoking a splendid majesty of noble gentlemen far long past.  Contrary to the harsh criticism expressed by other reviewers, the cinematography is spectacular; framed with a keen eye for stately grandeur and a profound kinesthetic sensitivity, it enthralls and even jars the senses. The battle scenes alternately elicit horror, tenderness, and sublimity, offering a vivid display of the gallantry and courage of men faced with an ominous, often brutal, undertaking that pushes the limits of human endurance to the outer edges of insanity. Ronald Maxwell's lateral tracking shots frequently generate a sense of immediacy and thrilling intensity rarely seen on screen. There are, admittedly, certain flaws in the execution of the material now and then: some heavy handed scenes and the occasional appearance of wooden acting. While indeed lamentable, such minor shortcomings are certainly forgivable, especially considering the sheer breadth of the project and the unique stylistic constraints.  Taken as a whole, the film hovers very near greatness, riveting the viewer and leaving a lasting impression upon the mind and senses of all but the irretrievably prejudiced or implacably insensate modern weaned on the pablum of mass market entertainment convention.

Gods and Generals could easily have succumbed to the trivialities and commonplaces of the ""swords and muskets"" genre so often observed in the most well known pictures based on the Civil War, drowning in formulaic scenes, exaggerated personality conflicts, stereotypical characters, high melodrama, and a stultifying adherence to bland moral certainties.  Thankfully, the producer and director of this film had the vision and intellectual courage to break with the commercial imperatives of ""easy viewing"" in order to strive for a transcendent artistic achievement.

This is a movie not to be missed by any lover of cinematic epics.  There are now two versions of Gods and Generals available: the original theatrical cut and an extended version which adds an entire new plot line and various other bits of previously elided footage running in the vicinity of an extra hour and a half of viewing time.  My preference is strongly for the theatrical cut, though I tend to be in the minority on this count.  Both have their merits and are well worth savoring.",1510099200,6,6065,5.505920344456404

1886025,5,B00009OOFB,"Hollywood seldom gets it right. This movie is an exception. My late 60s University of Maryland BA was in US history, mostly before 1865. Unlike the politically correct versions of history coming out of Hollywood in recent decades, this movie gives the viewer a historically correct view of two southern generals, their staff and opponents. Contrary to recent histories, both Lee and Jackson opposed slavery, but loved their states. As someone who lived most of his life in the north, the historically accurate depiction of the two generals was refreshing. When I studied history in the 60s at a very politically liberal university, I was fortunate to have professors who required me to research sources written by participants during the period reported on.

I love this movie, I love the acting, I love the cinematography, I even love the music. It makes itself a reminder that instead of holding grudges for what has happened in the past. We must come together as a nation and weep and give thanks for their sacrifice, they fought and died, so that we may never have to in the future. I ignore the critics who poorly discredited this film, they simply don't understand how those years of fighting over 150 years back, changed our nation forever. At least watch this film once in your lifetime, because it is story that every American must take to heart. It is the very words that came from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address that reminds us that this was a war to make the United States truly 'the land of the FREE', and we must make it our sacred duty as an American to never forget the bloodshed and the cost that was made. This movie is not trying to be biased, it is simply trying to take you back to the years of 1861-1863 and show you what has happened in order to make our nation more stronger and united. It stopped us from calling ourselves; ""Georgians, New Yorkers, Virginians, and Pennsylvanians"", it made us forever identify as ""American"", nothing more.",1509494400,2,1412,4.455598455598456

1886065,5,B00009OOFB,"This should have been the first in the trilogy however the much acclaimed 'Gettysburg' which actually
followed events depicted in 'Gods And Generals'  was made and released first....sadly because for whatever
reason this film didn't do so well, the third 'Last Full Measure' was shelved...shame.
''I never thought i'd live to see the day when the President of The United States would raise an army to invade his own Country -
'General Robert E Lee'
A war that would deepen division throughout a nation in the hope of uniting it, a war that would set brother against brother, a
war that would create far too many widows and fatherless children, a war in which both sides believed their cause to be just.
The film starts with 'General Robert E Lee' (Robert Duvall) rejecting the invitation to lead the Union-Army against the Southern
states rebellion, and resigning his post, as a southerner he is only too aware that his home state of Virginia  could and almost
certainly would join the conflict to try and repel the invaders.....He was destined to be the commander of The Southern army.
The film does try to see the conflict from both sides though centers it's attention on Confederate General 'Thomas Johnathan
'Stonewall' Jackson' a religious man, yet brilliant military man, who would lead his troops to many successes during the first
half of the war-years.
There were indeed many battles, both sides achieving victories...the film depicts three of them, two in 1862 'Manassas'
'Fredericksburg' both Confederate successes, and in 1863 'Chancellorsville' during which, though a Confederate success, saw
'Stonewall Jackson' accidentally mortally wounded by his own troops whilst out riding at night with his staff planning the next
days events.
The battle that would, though the war was only half way through, almost certainly turn the conflict in the Unions favour was
but a few weeks away - Gettysburg
The film i feel was unfairly criticised by many.....
With prolonged and well-staged and brutal battle sequences the film i feel captures the high's and lows of battle and it's effect
on loved ones, along with the despair experienced by civilians as their homes became under siege.
A well made historical film...though only telling a small portion of the overall story
(Reviewed after re-watching the theatrical-version i own, however realising there were significant additions including the build-up
and indeed September 1862 Battle of 'Antietam' in the extended-cut, i have since added this to my collection - worth considering)",1491782400,,2535,5.150485436893204

1886075,2,B00009OOFB,"Gods and Generals (a movie about characters who are in battles) doesn't have the replay-ability of Gettysburg (a movie about a battle featuring interesting characters).

While watching this, I couldn't help but think that Martin Sheen did a much better job as R. E. Lee, Jeff Daniels was a bit overweight in comparison to the Chamberlain he played in ""Gettysburg"", and it should have been called ""The Stonewall Jackson Show"" as the focus really was on him as a character and historical personality.  The battle scenes were ""eh"" alright and while I don't advocate the glorification of violence I do think that the ""eh"" factor detracted from the impact that the battles had on the personalities involved.  Ken Burns' classic documentary series strikes with significantly more emotional impact than this movie does.

The glue-on beards are still pretty bad (JEB Stuart's looked even worse than the one in Gettysburg) and the dialogue seemed more an ""accent delivery mechanism"" rather than anything genuinely developmental to the characters.

Gone With the Wind is far more so on both accounts, as was Griffith's The Birth of a Nation of course.....and the consensus that they are among the greatest movies in history (as entertainment and art) is loud and pretty unanimous.  Gods and Generals is a bad movie due to a wooden script, unimaginative filming and editing, weak character development, forgettable musical score, and generally poor acting.  Stonewall Jackson, like George Patton, was a complex historical character with some very deep flaws that could have fueled some terrific cinema (like the George C Scott film of Patton did).

In showing the lead up to the Civil War, we see characters who are very reluctant to fight against people they know in time of peace, but things had to happen for better things to happen.

Once again we have Jeff Daniels in the same role as GETTYSBURGH but taking a more of a back role than a prominent one, still fine at whatever he does.

Once again a fine ensemble cast this time Robert Duval as Lee instead of Marin Sheen reprising the role. Both gave their speciality to the same role that was required.

The extended version immerses you more in the events as it builds up towards Gettysburg. A nod goes to Stephen Lang's performance of ""Stonewall"" Jackson, a pretty zealous man who must've have been confounded in real life of what he had to do (and maybe pretty hard to take from some people's point of view), as anyone in a battle they didn't wish for or to be in.",1475107200,,989,4.387978142076503

The movie, when it was released, was panned as a mockery of the reliance of these men on God, but in fact, it very accurately portrays the history of this period of US History, and the motivations that brought us into the bloodiest war in our history.  It accurately reflects the historical story of First Bull Run, the failed attempt to take Richmond, only a smattering of Antietam, and the Wilderness campaign, up to the horrible death of Jackson by friendly fire.  It even quotes Jackson's final words as history records them.  It's a powerful and moving movie that doesn't back away from the horrible carnage that was the American Civil War.  Regrettably, as I alluded to above, the movie only lightly hit upon Antietam, the bloodiest single day in American history.

Stephen Lang's ridiculously over-the-top portrayal of Jackson makes William Shatner seem like a classically trained Shakespearean actor.  While I understand that Jackson was a devoutly religious man, the constant prayer intertwined with his insistence that his soldiers ""give them the bayonet."" was a lesson in contradiction.  As a result, the man comes across as a raving lunatic rather than the inspiring leader he was purported to be.  Ultimately, the movie suffers from an obvious bias towards the Confederate cause as well as a convenient white washing where the issue of slavery is concerned.

1886211,2,B00009OOFB,"Over the past 13 years, I somehow managed to miss watching the Civil War film Gods and Generals. I often wondered why this movie was never as popular or as critically well received as the movie Gettysburg, a film from 1993 that I really admire and enjoy.

I finally got to see Gods and Generals this week, and now I understand. This film, first released in 2003, is a prequel to Gettysburg. I found it a major disappointment. Although it stars many of the same actors as Gettysburg, and was written and directed by ""Gettysburg"" writer and director Ronald F. Maxwell), it cannot remotely compare to the far superior earlier film in terms of technical and artistic quality.

Gods and Generals takes place in 1861-62, one full year prior to the battle of Gettysburg. The film covers three major battles, all of them Confederate victories: First Bull Run, Antietam, and Fredericksburg. The battle scenes are lengthy, detailed, and, like Gettysburg, almost bloodless. My first impression from watching the battle scenes in ""Gods and Generals"" was that they were intended to show the chaos and confusion of 19th century warfare, which they do reasonably well. But, unlike the battle scenes in ""Gettysburg,"" they don't have the look and feel of real battles. They seem more like what they are: choreographed set-pieces done by Civil War re-enactors.  I also call into question some of the historical accuracy in these scenes.

The writing and acting in Gods and Generals is mediocre at best. Ronald Maxwells screenplay has the same tendency to long-winded speechifying as does Gettysburg, but overall the acting seems more stilted and overwrought. There are few notable exceptions. Robert Duvall (as Robert E. Lee), Stephen Lang (as Stonewall Jackson), and Jeff Daniels (as Joshua L. Chamberlain) are definite standouts, but many of the other actors delivere strictly pedestrian performances.

Gods and Generals could actually have been a very good film. I think the reason why it isn't is because Maxwell and his production team simply tried to do too much. I think ""Gods and Generals"" would have been a much better (and shorter) film had Maxwell decided to cover one of the battles  say, Fredericksburg, or Antietam, or First Bull Run  and left it at that. But he didnt, and the result is an over-long film (the Extended Directors Cut, which I watched, clocks in at well over four hours) that is neither particularly interesting nor very entertaining.",1461974400,,2446,4.995085995085995

1886224,4,B00009OOFB,"Wow.  The politics which many of the reviewers have brought into this......it was a different time, and yes, dominated in the south by religion...and the horrible concept of slavery....which they wrongfully thought right.  But anyone who knows anything about history understands the war, to the vast majority of southerners (who actually were not slave owners) was more about state's rights than anything.  Thank goodness many of these same people aren't reviewing The Ten Commandments or they would surely condemn Charleton Heston for allowing the Red Sea to inundate the Egyptian legion.

When it comes down to brass tacks, the two places where this film comes up short are in failing to demonstrate the dark side of slavery and too much of the personal, family issues confronted by Stonewall Jackson and Chamberlain.  Without an 8 hour mini-series, it would be impossible to adequately portray these subplots.  Where this film triumphs is in the acting of Stephen Lang, as Jackson.  As good as he played Pickett in the classic Gettysburg, he did even better here.  His farewell to the First Brigade was memorable in this film.  Quite frankly, I also believe Robert Duvall not only looked much more like Robert E Lee than Martin Sheen in Gettysburg, but his elocution was much better than the mumbling, brooding character portrayed by Sheen.

You can tell that Ted Turner broke the bank to make this movie.  I wish it had greater commercial success, however, you are pushing an elephant up a hill with a nearly 4 hour film.  If you are a Civil War buff, you will appreciate the labor that went into this production and the concomitant great attention to detail, regardless of your politics.",1456963200,,1692,4.960992907801418

This gives us a much better understanding of what took place, as well as the emotions that were inherent on both sides. The four hour long epic movie remains instilled within me in understanding that so many people lost their lives for their own cause.  What do you do when a part of the country decides to invade your own? Putting all issues aside, the decision to battle against members of your own country is senseless and lacks proper competence and reasoning. A better persuasion of words in dialogue and reasoning could have avoided such a costly war, that not only destroyed families but the common good of a country in despair. Uniting a country through the use of bloodshed is not an endeavor that I ever wish, but in this case it happened.  Although, many have forgotten what took place in American soil those fateful years, this movie brings it all back and honors those who fought for what they believed in for the sanctity and protection of their own home states against an invasion of hostility that should have never taken place. It is up to the states and it always shall be to determine the true nature of it citizens through the popular majority of opinion and reason.",1448150400,,1246,4.582959641255606

The producers did a great job of getting many (most) of the actors back who were in the earlier film, but they couldn't get 100%.  Unfortunately, at least one of the supporting actors had passed away and a few had other obligations, so there are a few new faces.  The most notable cast change was Robert Duvall as General Robert E. Lee, as well as the most featured character, Gen. Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson, portrayed expertly by Stephen Lang who HAD portrayed Gen. George Pickett in the movie ""Gettysburg.""  However, this film treated this detail well since the real Gen. Jackson (in real life) had perished several months before the battle at Gettysburg.  Mr. Lang was up to the task and was able to do a very good job portraying two different real-life characters so important in the timeline of History & he was able to portray both men with great skill and allowing the watcher to forget that the same man portrayed BOTH important characters!

It was very poorly directed. The director also wrote the screen play and the movie was four hours and 39 minutes long and full of very wooden acting. The character portraying General Stonewall Jackson was absurdly over the top and most of the other characters were gushing with plastic emotions.

The two good characterizations were Jeff Daniels as Colonel Joshua Chamberlin and Robert Duval as General Robert E. Lee. Duval conveyed Lee's strategic thinking, driven by his faith in God, while Daniels portrayed Chamberlin in a relatively understated way that felt congruent with the Chamberlin who became a hero in the battle of Gettysburg.

The battle scenes were pretty good, but I am pretty certain that the same footage was used multiple times which I drove my rating of this movie down even further.",1445644800,5,917,4.903225806451613

But there is just a general dismalness to  the whole movie that keeps it from being one that is watched often. It just hurts too much and stirs a visceral chord that makes me avoid it  more than other movie that i like.

I like this movie and think the overall product is a good one. It really takes neither side and shows the futility and flaws found in all human beings to one extent or another. One wonders when watching this, just how would i have really felt if I had been born then?, and then one remembers that the same problems faced by those people so long ago are still faced by us today.

Gladly we are not in a Civil War killing each other over the issues, but we are still humans who have to make the hard choices and live with the consequences of our actions just as they did. And perhaps that is why I don't want to watch it often, because it forces me to think and evaluate my own attitudes and actions in a fresh light.",1443139200,,1079,4.173076923076923

There was one remarkable stupidity throughout the movie. Many of the Union men were in gray, or near-gray. And many of the Rebs were in blue or near blue.

Actors: Jeff Daniels, Robert Duvall and Stephan Lang - star, in their portrayals within this meticulously detailed, accurate and historical depiction of the two opposing sides (the Union North & the Confederate South) during the initial and early stages of the American Civil War (1861-1865). Featured: Are the distinguished lives of General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson - a Confederate Military Icon and Colonel Joshua Chamberlain of the Union North from the State of Maine. In addition too, painstaking reenactments of the early battles of: Manassas, Chancellorsville and Fredericksburg. And, this unique and compelling film focuses in on Robert E. Lee's refusal of President Lincolns' invitational commission to lead the North, so as to preserve the Union. This color, 219-minute, single, 2-sided, riveting, DVD is as educational, as it is, entertaining. And, although it is a movie as opposed too a documentary type of presentation, the principle as well as battle scene Actors are so realistic, that you'd think that you were actually there. Standing in the midst of the authentic battle, itself. GODS AND GENERALS is an intense portrayal of one of Americas' darkest periods on it's own soil... with Americans against Americans, fighting to the death, for their respective beliefs. This very interesting prequel to the film, entitled: GETTYSBURG is captivating. However, the film details the Confederate Generals and their side of the War, more so than that of the Northern, Union Generals. But nevertheless, history seemingly comes alive within this insightful, epic, motion picture. God forbid..., that Americans should ever again turn militarily against their fellow Americans and fight to the death on American soil and cause a National Divide, ever again. God blessed this Great Nation with rights, freedoms and privileges for all Americans, whether North or South. And not..., so that Americans can turn on each other with battles, bullets and bloodshed. No. The Lord blessed this Great Nation, so that Americans can stand united together as ""ONE NATION under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all!"" Amen and amen.

However, it's not just a tale a Southerner would enjoy, but anyone who loves the history of this country.

The rest of the cast support them well.  Robert Duvall is good as ever, and captures the complexities of Robert E. Lee, a noble, honorable man who is led by a blind dedication to his state.

Gods and Generals is an over the top movie about historical characters who, for the past near 150 years have been portrayed in every media form as larger than life and nearly God-like.  How can a single movie change attitudes and convey anything but that?

For all its faults, and there are a few, this movie is beautiful and sad to watch all at the same time.  War IS hell.  For anyone who has never experienced it to say anything about it is about as valuable as someone trying to describe a food they've never eaten and know nothing about.

1886380,5,B00009OOFB,"Excellent film! The acting was brilliantly done. Robert Duvall did a fine piece of acting as General Robert E. Lee, perhaps partly motivated by the fact that he is a direct descendant of the famous leader. Major General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson was brilliantly brought to life by Stephen Lang, who portrayed the man in such a way that one of the foremost authorities on Jackson and author of an exhaustive biography, proclaimed this film to be the closest personification he'd ever seen of him on the screen. Jeff Daniels returns to the screen to portray Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and likewise does a fine job.
All in all, it is a story all too often told from one-side and for once it is good to see it treated in a more balanced light. Understanding that this is, of course, a work of fiction based upon real characters and events, any serious student of this struggle or of American history in general should see this film.",1427068800,,930,4.676829268292683

I could only barely make it past the first scene where Lee is being wooed by the Union: it is not accurate and the dialogue is awful. This scenario extends throughout the movie...scenes seem to be put together to anchor a famous quote or saying. The main focus of the movie is on Gen. Jackson, but entertains smaller lenses on Chamberlain and Booth...what? Why?  Booth is wholly unnecessary for this film, and Chamberlain's involvement is there only because of Gettysburg (the movie).

This film glorifies war, making it more dramatic (or romantic) than it is. While some movies rely on special effects or star-power, this one uses too much score and sweeping musical arrangements. If it would only drown out the poor dialogue and cheesy ""heart break"" scenes.

Gods and Generals does not disappoint in the battle details.  However, it is a significant disappointment in the other details.  For example, it attempts to make the Confederates (soldiers and civilians) look  like they were amicable towards slaves.  Indeed, there a scene with Stonewall Jackson talking with his cook, who is an African American, and General Jackson states that the slaves would be freed one way or another.  He talks about cementing a bond of friendship between white and black.  This is a peculiar conversation given that Jackson owned slaves.  A family in Fredericksburg, VA shows such loving kindness towards their slave maid and her children.  But this is bogus, too.

1886430,4,B00009OOFB,"What made ""Gettysburg"" such a successful film and broadly appealing film (even to a 12 year old kid like me back when I saw it) was because of the humanity that played out in it.  It did not just focus on the overall battle of Gettysburg, but it also focused on multiple perspectives of the individual commanders...their struggles, motivations, compassion, etc.  In the case of Jeff Shaara's book, what makes it so endearing is that the whole novel focuses purely on the perspectives of historical characters (Chamberlain, Lee, Hancock, etc.)...in fact, the chapters are aptly named after those characters as the perspective switches.  And what's more...both of these were based on actual historical sentiments of said figures and the actions they took and events they were a part of.  There is an extended version of this film, however I will be reviewing the ""standard"" edition.  With the thourght-provoking strength that ""Gettysburg"" displayed, and the personal depth of Jeff Shaara's book, I had high hopes for this film.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to those expectations...though its value as a historical film is still undeniable.

CONTENT ISSUES:  Absolutely nothing to fear in terms of sexual things and innuendos.  The closest is when General Jackson and his wife are discussing matters in bed.  She's in her nightgown...so is he...and they are just talking.  Considering that this is a war film, though, do expect standard violence, wounds, and everything else that comes with the territory.  This is definitely a pg-13 for that.  Also, there is not much cussing going on except for an occasional ""D---"" expletive.  All in all, this is a clean film.

CONCERNING THE FILM (ABSOLUTELY NO MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS...JUST MINOR AND NON-DEFINITIVE ONES FOR PURPOSE OF EXPLANATION):

  The American Civil War is a very intriguing period of time that has continually drawn people through the ages.  Part of that is because of the multitude of characters that had their name etched in history due to bravery, compassion, tenacity...or some combination of them all.  Whereas the sequel made it a point to highlight these individuals, ""Gods and Generals"" doesn't really spend enough time with the characters to build a sympathetic bond.  We get enough to understand their train of thought and motivations, but not enough to ""become friends"".  The only reason I care about these historical figures as portrayed in the film is because I have studied them.  I can at least say they capture much of their sentiments accurately.  Still, the lack of character-to-audience bonding is a huge blow to the film.  After all, part of what made the American Civil War unique were the kinds of people involved.

Another facet of the Civil War that made it especially unique was how it wasn't so much a war of two sides that hated each other as it was a war of multiple conflicting ideals.  Many other civil wars are often depicted as one side rising against another due to resentment and rage being allowed to fester into something ugly and destructive.  The American Civil War is not so easily categorized into such simplistic terms...and this is one thing the film does right.  Throughout, you hear multiple perspectives and angles for why people chose the side they are on.  From generals who wanted to protect their home (some saw their state as the home...while others saw the nation as a home), to slaves who shared mixed emotions (some who were fortunate to have kind masters had both an urge to protect these families yet seek freedom), to people seeking national identity.  One of the best and most heart wrenching illustrations of this in the film was when the Union Irish Brigade (the 69th Penn) went against against their Confederate counterpart who realized that they were both Irish.  One was fighting to show their loyalty their now home, while the other saw the conflict as a mirror to conflict between England and Ireland.

One more part of the American Civil War that tends to draw us is simply the scale of the battles and methods to which they were fought.  This film does it right and in a very large scale.  Plus the historical details are awesome.  For instance, especially during this time of the war, there wasn't ""one standard uniform"" for each sides, but, in fact, they featured a wide variety...which historically led to some confusion at points.

AS TO ACTING QUALITY:
I think that it should be noted that, it really was not the best.  It pales significantly in comparison to what the cast of ""Gettysburg"" pulled off.  Well to be specific...the one's that reprised their roles for this film (such as the Chamberlain brothers) came into their roles perfectly and as expected.  It was the ones who took up the new characters that seemed to suffer from over-acting their parts and whatnot.  Still, if you look at it more a a docu-drama, it works out.

I should also point out, unlike Gettysburg which had a fair balance between North/South perspectives (somewhat leaning to more Northern presentations), and unlike the book which really was balanced in the presentation of perspectives...""Gods and Generals"" really seems to focus more on the Southern viewpoint significantly more than those of the North.

SPECIAL FEATURES:
There are tons of cool sounding features and featurettes.  I have not looked them over, though.  But I'll be sure to come back and mention them when I do get to them.

ALL IN ALL:
The sheer absence of in-depth looks at individuals definitely hurts it greatly.  In fact, because of this, I wouldn't call it a true adaptation of Jeff Shaara's book.  Not focusing and developing the characters results in leaving much of the books plot behind.  But if you like history, you will be sure to find much else to enjoy about the film.  It is still very well done and touching at points.  Ultimately, though, you would do best to watch ""Gettysburg"" first before this film.",1422057600,,5901,4.91010101010101

Jackson and others may have been religious BUT- there is absolutely too much of the subject for my taste. I felt like I was being preached to.

1886458,5,B00009OOFB,"A film not for everyone.  Some folks will get turned off just at Stonewall Jackson's religious sensibilities.  I understood it in the historical perspective, and as a prequel to one of my favorite films of all time, ""Gettysburg"".

I wish they had gotten all cast members from Gettysburg to be in this film, but the re-casting, for the most part, worked well.  Robert Duvall as General Robert E. Lee was VERY good.  But missing Tom Berenger as General Longstreet was a bit of a let-down.  Of course, moving General Pickett to the place of General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson was a bit hard to get used to, but that actor is very, very good.

I would highly recommend watching Gods and Generals first, THEN watching Gettysburg.  And I certainly recommend the Director's Cut.  These are one heck of a great pair of movies.",1416441600,3,818,4.704225352112676

On releasing of the film, it was  rejected by the author of the original book and grossed only five million after costing fifty three million to produce. Someone is trying to recoup expenses by unloading a turkey.
Stonewall Jackson, sitting astride his horse on a hilltop, right hand on hip, emoting biblical and poetic dialogue was typical of scripting throughout. Emoting in Shakesperian verse while posturing and referring constantly to God and the bible by all major role players was something one would expect from a 19th century play and not a 21st century production.  Period costuming, battle scenes, general historic reenactment was good. Portraying all southern soldiers  as chivalrous, protective of women and children and especially respectful to their slaves with the slaves responding on a equal, caring level to their masters while showing northern soldiers as boorish, looting opposites to their southern counterparts was over the top.

You follow 3 main generals but I think it seems to favor following General Thomas Jackson. If you aren't into civil war history, the struggles in this movie will make you cry, or at least you'll struggle not to. Heck, I cried 3 times and I knew what was going to happen.
Since this movie was historically accurate, you will see the Southerners fighting for independence, and the Yankees fighting to free the slaves. Jackson wasn't fond of slavery, neither was General Lee, but they fought, like many others, for their home. This movie is extremely well put together and i definitely recommend it for anyone who is a fan of civil war history, southern history, or is really patient and wants to see a amazingly put together film.",1407888000,2,806,4.757142857142857

I can only hope that Ted Turner and Ron Maxwell get together for The Last Full Measure and Shaara's Western Theater trilogy. Bring back Martin Sheen as Lee.

1886525,2,B00009OOFB,While both Gettysburg and Gods & Generals are great movies they are thoroughly based on books which are complete biased towards the Southern side so much so that slavery is just glazed over.  The southern commanders are mythologized with their constant sermonizing while the northern commanders sound like godless engineers with no soul.  Typical.  Again the southern cause is being romanticized to the point of an attempt at constant sympathy for what were traitors to the United States pure and simple.  To date I have not seen a film which fairly looks at the Civil War.  The Jeff Shara movies are so biased toward the southerns it mine as well be Confederate propaganda.  There were heroes in the North.  There were great commanders in the North but not according these movies.  I have to say that Gettysburg was a little fairer in that regard.

However, there are no rules when dealing with interpreting history.  Political correctness is not always necessary to
understanding historical events.  In fact, imposing modern beliefs to historical events will never work.  So, accept the
movie for what it is, not what you want it to be.  If the facts are correct, there should be no problem with the author's and/or
director's interpretation.  The historical facts are accurate in my opinion.  Yes, the movies does seems to be rather sympathetic to
the Southern side.

Yes, the Southern side appears to be more noble and the slavery issue is highly glossed over.  But that is true in much of the

1886543,1,B00009OOFB,"This is easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

Easily.

Probably *the* worst movie I have ever seen.

I expected better. I remember a few scattered reviews at the time of its release which were fairly partisan about the whole what the Civil War was fought over subject. I chalked that up to the overly political nature of the media. So I figured I'd give this movie a chance.

I expected it to be basically something akin to a Kevin Costner movie, a Field of Dreams or a Dances with Wolves, told with a slight Confederate slant.

I was ready to accept a Confederate slant.

But not this.

The issue is that the movie itself is extremely political. It batters you over the head with its message. The Confederacy was noble. It was not about slavery.

It was not about slavery. See? We have black people cheering for the Confederates.

It really was not about slavery. See? We have a black actor being best friends with the Confederate General.

Besides being historically inaccurate, it is incredibly irritating to be battered over the head over and over with this politically motivated sledgehammer.

And it truly is inaccurate. For black America, the Civil War was their war of independence. The numbers of black Americans fighting for the Union greatly outnumbered those few fighting for the Confederacy. Greatly. Vastly. Hugely. And, as the war dragged on, the Confederate leadership grew virulently racist against black americans, Robert E Lee included. Yes, the Union was also racist. The Confederacy was more racist. By a lot.

Secondly, it glorifies the leadership of the Confederacy. The last remaining defense of the Confederate flag is that it is a battlefield flag, dedicated to the men who died for a misguided cause.

That I can accept. That is true.

But this movie is not about honoring the Confederate fighting man. Not at all.

It is about honoring the Confederate leadership. It is about honoring the Confederate cause itself.

This movie is pretty much told from the perspective of the Confederate planter class, the ones who held slaves and who ruled the South. It is not told from the perspective of the poor white fighting man who was fighting for what he thought of as home.

The scenes play this out. Everyone is spouting noble sentiments. Everyone dies quickly and bravely. There is hardly any emotion in the fighting. There is hardly any emotion in the Confederate generals being glorified in the film. They say their overly long flowery language and...on to the next scene of overly long flowery language...and then the next, this time with a black person giving racial absolution to the Confederate white supremacist generals, and--

It does this for over four hours.

Four hours is insane. Four hours of Confederate propaganda. Four hours of what is basically Springtime for Hitler: Confederacy edition.

This movie is simply an embarrassment. As another reviewer put it, less enlightened than Gone with the Wind.

And released in 2003.

1886549,5,B00009OOFB,"The Extended Director's Cut of the Civil War epic drama Gods And Generals is, in many ways, better than the theatrical cut. The additional scenes reveal more about the characters, and how life was back then in the mid-19th century. However, I'm disappointed that two scenes which are in the theatrical version were deleted from the Director's Cut. I think those scenes showed what the characters were really like, even though other scenes supply the void by the omission of those scenes. The first scene in question is when General Jackson (Stephen Lang) prayeth unto God prior to the battle of Manassas. The scene showed clearly how strongly he believed in Almighty God, and even though, of course, Jackson's faith is mentioned/made explicit in other scenes, I feel that the omission of this scene from the Extended Director's Cut was an error in judgement on the director's part. The second scene involves Martha (Donzaleigh Abernathy) quoting from the Book of Esther to a dying soldier, and its effect on General Burnside. The scene showed how strongly the women and men on both sides of the war believed in Almighty God.

The film is an hour longer than the theatrical cut, but don't let that stop you from viewing one of the greatest war films ever made. Yes, it is primarily a motion picture about the first part of the Civil War, but it's much more than that. It's a historical drama that keenly examines both sides of the conflict and the men/women involved. In this day and age, where Almighty God is blasphemed in movies, television, radio and magazines, it's refreshing to see a motion picture depicting a time where God was reverenced, and how faith in Him & belief on His only begotten Son, our Lord and Saviour Christ Jesus leadeth unto reward; if not in this life, then certainly in the next.

I think the movie's fault is it's attempt to crush too much history into one move. Trying to cram in detail from Lincoln's
offering Lee command of the Army of the Potomac thru the Virginia legislative secession sessions took a great deal of time which could have been synopsized to make room to better develop key characters like Ambrose E. Burnside who
watched as he wasted Union brigade after brigade charging up Maryes hill into disintegration, or James J. Longstreet
Lee's titular second in command, and most importantly General "" Fighting Joe "" Hooker, upon whom the wrath of the master stroke of Lee and Jackson's end around that invaded Hooker's exposed western flank and drove his army for miles past his Chancellorsville headquarters and ruined Hooker's "" Perfect Plan "" to destroy the Army of Virginia.

Many will be surprised after watching this film. The sad state of teaching American history in our country has left many without any knowledge of the blacks who fought for the Confederacy, of the serious attention to Christianity and the revivals encouraged by Lee and Jackson, of the deep belief many people had at the time in duty and honor and loyalty to ideals.

When you see Fredericksburg  the town and the hill they tried to capture , the movie makes more sense. The average moviegoer has never gone to a Civil war battlefield and to them it's just savage fighting and dying. That's why this movie was a flop. It cost 85 million to make this movie and they only grossed 12 million, so no wonder why Ted Turner won't make the final part of this trilogy.
Too bad they didn't release the Directors cut with all the extra footage and better editing. Maybe the movie would have done better when released.
I thought this movie was good , fine  acting, good battle scenes and fantastic special effects like the computer generated scene showing Frederickburg and the train crossing the Rappahanock. Stephen Lang was perfect for the role of Stonewall Jackson, very believable. Robert Duvall is related to Robert E Lee and he was more believable as lee then Martin Sheen. Martin Sheen was great in Gettysburg but he didn't look like Lee. Robert Duvall owns a farm in Virginia ( he says it's the next stop before Heaven) and there was a Civil war battle on his property and he digs up Civil war stuff from time to time. Part of Gods and Generals was filmed on his land.
People complained the movie was overly sympathetic to the South. But have they ever made a movie showing the Confederate side ? The South won one battle after another the first 2 years of the war and the movie had to show the Confederate side more then the Union side. The critics hated this movie because Hollywood would never had made this movie . Gods And Generals was much better then the recently released Lincoln movie. The movie Lincoln was garbage in my opionion. I'm a Northener and I liked Gods and Generals. This movie told the truth and wasn't politically correct.",1390608000,,1859,4.562874251497006

I enjoyed seeing the transition of the war aims from generally states rights unto slavey & the simple fact that while none are w/o sin, nevertheless our Declaration of Independence made no bones about acknowledging man's (humankind) unalienable rights from our Creator, the God of Nature & Natures Law.  All men, per the D. of I. are imbued the Rights to Life, Liberty & Pursuit of Happiness.  Granted the US contribution to slavery is minor compared to other governments even modern belief systems.  Nevertheless, in the post-modern paradigm we Americans stand on the shoulders of those who came before whether good or bad.

Nevertheless, the movie well displayed the faithfulness & brilliance of Stone Wall Jackson, his military prowess was truly impressive.  I don' believe Robert E. Lee won another battle upon Jackson's death.

It was proven out that it was a very good thing for the U.S. that the entire confederacy wasn't made of similar command structure & troops as the army of Northern Virginia & the Virginia Military Institute.

OK, I got to Stonewall Jackson's death and finally gave up in boredom and disgust.

What a bloated, vapid and over wrought movie. And I thought Jackson was a hard charging, heartless and profoundly odd commander. What a surprise to discover he is a child hugging, slave loving, crybaby. Robert E Lee hardly appears in the movie, which is a big waste of Robert Duval. And Jeff Daniels, so entertaining in Gettysburg, is a cardboard cut out.

What was most frustrating were the battle scenes. So many men! They could have been so impressive! But all you see are line after line marching on, as if the director was impressed by these huge parade ground maneuvers. And except for the a wee cameo here and there, blood and gore were seemingly absent from the Civil War battlefield.

typical Hollywood leftwing bias.  The opening title and especially the theme song was so beautiful that it brought tears to my eyes.
Sometimes I just like listening to the theme song over and over: sad  almost like a funeral, perhaps because of what happened to
Jackson at the end.  The character of Lee was well played by Duvall, though the guy who played Longstreet was weak. Actors
playing Chamberlain and his brother were brought back but they were not as effective as they were in GETTYSBURG by the same
producers.  Still, the story of Jackson was well  worth the purchase of this DVD set.  A beautiful rendition of A BONNY BLUE FLAG
was done though why such liberals as Ted Turner were there in Confederate Uniforms was puzzling.  Jackson was shown as being
merciless in battle, but compassionate other times, especially with the little girl go died.  The sets and photography were very good
and battles good, but curiously the original versions skipped over the battle of Antietiam which was added to a degree in the ex-
panded version.  This battle was played down, but  Antietiam showed up the flaws that Lee sometimes shown.  I believe that
Antietiam was the beginning of the end of the Confederacy, not Gettysburg.  Overall I give this special edition four stars and I
think it is very good purchase for those who like Civil War movies.  I do recommend this be bought with GETTYSBURG as they

one I never tire of watching! Having studied the civil war era myself, I believe the costumes and the
settings and the battle scenes to be truly accurate. For those who think the dialogue too poetic or not realistic,
you only need to read some of the journals or diaries of the time. This alone will give you a true glimpse
into how the people thought and spoke. I think it is wonderful that these dear folk were able to express so eloquently
events that normal words would fall far short in accurately justifying.
If you watch Ken Burn's civil war documentary series, you will find this fact of emotionally inspired expression also
well brought out!  And if you read the very well-researched, fictional account of Jackson's life, Stonewall, by
John J. Dwyer, you will see that Jackson was a most unusual man who did pray about as often as he turned around.

1886589,3,B00009OOFB,"This is a review of both ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals"". The ratings and titles are different.

If it isn't obvious from watching these films, the director/screenwriter explains in an interview that they're intended to present an unbiased view of both North and South, without labeling anyone as good or bad, hero or villain. What then remains, he says, is the horror of war (though most of it is shown at a PG-13 level). What, then, is the /dramatic/ point?

Little, it seems. It isn't until near the end of ""Gods"" * that Jeff Daniels says what needed to have been said at the start -- that he can't understand why Southerners rant on about freedom, when they live under a system that enslaves people. The Southern argument -- that their states are their countries -- is an accurate reflection of how people felt -- indeed, of how this country was conceived (in both senses of the word) -- but it pales in comparison with the facts that not only is slavery wholly unjustifiable (unless you believe that sub-human people exist solely to earn your bread for you), and that the war was fought over the spread of slavery. Those reaching for their keyboards to accuse me of political correctness are advised to refrain.

The wide range of personal opinions on IMDb is not surprising. Northerners tend to see ""Gods"" as pro-Southern, Southerners as vindication. Neither is correct. But at a time when legislators -- many from Southern states -- are trying to exterminate the few vestiges of democracy that remain in this country -- neither film sits very well with this viewer. I would like to point out to Southerner sympathizers reading this... You lost. Get over it. State's rights were trampled where they should have been trampled, and the Federal government affirmed its superiority over the states. Tough.

As for who's the better Lee, Sheen or Duvall, the decision has to come down firmly on Sheen's side. Photos of Lee suggest a dark personality, and Sheen captures this better. Duvall is a strong person, and there is -- except for a few moments near the end -- little sense of weakness, or any ambiguity in his views. It doesn't help that Sheen has several scenes of strong dramatic interaction that allow him to display Lee's character -- Duvall has only one brief ""dramatic"" moment (which he does well). Sheen's show of fear and anguish at the end of ""Gettysburg"" is played beautifully.

Both films are worth seeing. But their attempts to present a dispassionate perspective weakens them. It might be /logical/ to ask us to show sympathy for people who are morally wrong -- but it implies that whatever we do is the result of the Zeitgeist, uncontrollable forces we cannot avoid. But we can, of course.

* I interpret the use of ""Gods"" as referring to the different gods Northerners and Southerners worship. It's particularly striking (especially among the Southerners) how often they ascribe human events to God's will -- as if humans have no responsibility for their own behavior.",1383177600,4,2995,4.828460038986354

1886599,4,B00009OOFB,"This is an excellent film on the Civil War - told mostly from the Southern side - that could have been great, save for a couple of major flaws. First, at 229 minutes it is way too long for a theatrical release. Second, even at its current length, too much has been omitted. The Battle of Antietam was an integral part of Jeff Shaara's novel and the linchpin battle for Lincoln's issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation - it should have been covered. Other battles, like the Valley Campaign and Second Manassas should have been at least featured briefly to show how the legend that became Stonewall Jackson developed. The theatrical format was probably a loser from the get-go; a mini-series TV format would have been much better...sort of a companion piece to Ken Burns docudrama on the Civil War. But flaws aside, from a personal perspective as a Civil War history buff, I love this film. I've watched it many times...I always get a rush during the battle scenes and a lump in my throat at the end. The acting - especially by Jeff Daniels, Robert Duvall and Stephen Lang - is superb. Lang as Stonewall Jackson delivers his best performance ever (my opinion of course) eclipsing his performance as George Pickett in Gettysburg. Jackson was an eccentric military genius and it took a lot of study and talent to portray him properly...Lang's performance is dead-on. Hats off to Ted Turner for producing this and Gettysburg...he has a cameo role in both films as Col. Waller Patton, the great uncle of George Patton.

  Author Jeff Shaara was disappointed with the film and has said that the book is ""enormously different, it's radically different from the film. There are characters in the film that do not exist in the book, and a great many characters in the book that never made it to the film. It's just an entirely different story, and I have to tell you, I've heard from literally thousands of people through my website ... and the overwhelming percentage of those that wrote me said, ""How could you let them butcher your book like that?""

And the Man from Pennsylvania whose son chose to fight with his friends in Virginia against fellow statesmen from Pennsylvania; much to his father's sadness.

This version is separated into 5 ""chapters"" and truly brings you into the war almost as a participant, We were amazed at the authenticity of this film and even the smallest detail was carefully researched...except for the fact that they placed the cannons too close together, but that was probably necessary for the filming  (cannons were usually placed far enough apart that if one had a malfunction, it would not affect the others). The main characters, Jackson and Chamberlain, become real: one the staunchly religious Southern militarist and the other a philosphical, deadly serious and proper professor...both deeply in love with their wives and loyal to their causes. This is how history should be taught...less about who was right and who was wrong, but about fleshing out why each side believed so fervently that what they were doing was right.",1375142400,,1145,4.932642487046632

The movie suffers from a blatant southern bias which is not surprising since Ted Turner paid for the thing. The biggest problem is the dialogue is terrible to the point of hilarity. They act like everyone who lived in 1861 talked like they were in a Shakespearean play. Stonewall Jackson was a religious zealot but I doubt every stinking word out of his mouth was a bible verse; this movie makes you think that is all they talked about. If you come into this movie with no idea of the Civil War good luck following any of the characters outside of Jackson or maybe Lee. One of the greatest characters from the war (Chamberlain) was left under-developed and poorly executed in this film. I have read that the extended cut fixes the problems and I pray that is the case, but I am basing this review on the original, and that original is a mess and a terrible film.",1373414400,,1011,4.326315789473684
1886612,2,B00009OOFB,"Must echo the reviewer who called this product a mess, but very sad to have to do so.  Too many personal stories to keep straight, too much faithfulness to some details of battles (that one may only appreciate if one already knows those details), too many puzzling omissions and elisions.

Why nothing on the battle of Antietem?  One moves abruptly to the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation without the considerations that determined its timing, or without much context.  If, as Ted Turner says in his intro, this was meant to be in great part a historical lesson, it failed massively in this alone.

Finally, though the title of the film reveals much of its bent, it has become very difficult to see ""Stonewall"" Jackson deified without much reference to his full character and acts. (His mortal wounding and death were indeed represented well wrt historical records.) Lots of fast-forwarding by me past his many, many prayerful moments (far too reverent a treatment for my taste) and the violence -- though that's my issue, not a problem with the film.

After watching this writer's movie ""Gettysburg"" many times, and reading the Shaara books and Shelby Foote's trilogy, et al., and despite the scant attention to Union characters and issues, I'm left to warn others against this film -- with a big UNLESS:

IF you are a fan of ""Stonewall""; if you are an evangelical Christian; if your historical preferences are Southern and tolerant of painfully accurate depictions of war's violence; then this may be a film you will enjoy.

1886618,4,B00009OOFB,"It's not really a good ""movie"" in the sense of appealing to a mass audience. That's probably why it did so poorly at the box office when it was released originally in 2003. This 150th anniversary edition is the director's cut, which include several scenes not in the original, most notably, the battle of Antietam. If you are a Civil War buff, you'll enjoy this. You'll just have to looks past all the soppy melodrama and the way Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson is portrayed. It's kind of laughable, really. But the battle scenes are first-rate and done extremely well. The battle of Fredericksburg is phenomenal.

On thing that always bothered me about this film is that fact that is really does center on Stonewall Jackson as the primary focus - at least from the Confederate point of view. Yet it completely ignores his Valley Campaign of 1862, which quite honestly is what made him so well known and famous. The film leaps from First Manassas to Antietam and pretty much ignores Jackson's victory after victory after victory in the spring of 1862. Not really sure why.

So if you are a student of the Civil War, you will really like this film. If not, you'll probably be a bit bored with all that goes on between battles. I'm glad I own it.",1369008000,3,1239,4.601809954751131

1886621,2,B00009OOFB,"""War loses a great deal of romance after a soldier has seen his first battle. I have a more vivid recollection of the first than the last one I was in. It is a classical maxim that it is sweet and becoming to die for one's country; but whoever has seen the horrors of a battle-field feels that it is far sweeter to live for it.""

This is from the celebrated Confederate Raider John S. Mosby's ""Mosby's War Reminiscences"", a book of his memories of the Civil War - but little of the wisdom of the passage above is communicated in Gods and Generals. It is sad to say that ""Gods and Generals"" is a movie that paints with grade-school brush strokes a story that deserves a far finer and more detailed brush. The Civil War still remains to this day the single most important event in the history of this country - save for that of the original Revolutionary War - and it deserves a better retelling than this goopy mess.

What kept this movie from even beginning to interest me (as a big Civil War buff) was the unimaginable treacle in the tone of the movie. More sugar and sanctimony dripped off the dialog in this movie than did from three consecutive showings of the seventies tearjerker Love Story! It didn't bother me that the movie was a view of the war from the Southern standpoint - that isn't the issue. What is the issue is the view of this war in a virtual downpour of honeyed and glowing Hallmark Moments. The revision of history by scenes showing slave support and affection for their masters isn't totally without some measure of truth - but it is dreadfully close.

Yes, the war was more about economics (industry versus agriculture) and politics (federal versus state) - at least in the beginning. But by the time the war was halfway through it did become at least in part a battle for human rights due to the Emancipation Proclamation and the inclusion of African-Americans in the ranks of the Union.

Two stars for the professional editing and good job of acting by most parties - but no more than that indicator of mediocrity due to the crazily skewed view of war as a noble endeavor without a single recrimination or even some attempt at the true feelings of the overwhelming majority of soldiers and civilians whom suffered through more than four years of misery and death. If some prefer to view this as a true representation of war, then they are blessed in their ignorance of the essential and overriding components of armed conflicts - death and destruction. And the Civil War had more of those two horrors than any other war fought by Americans - something that is terribly under-represented in this film.",1368230400,4,2626,4.557203389830509

1886628,1,B00009OOFB,"For all of its faults, i truly enjoyed Gettysburg.  Yes, it adheres to the Southern Lost Cause viewpoint and yes it supports the ""Lee lost because of his mistakes and those of his subordinates"" explanation of the battle which reduces the very capable leadership of the Army of the Potomac to the simple beneficiaries of mistakes.  Still, I enjoyed it.

I did not enjoy Gods and Generals. I could barely watch Gods and Generals.  I feel that Gods and Generals does a disservice to the War, the Battles and the people involved.

In the spirit of full disclosure I have studied this war for most of my 50 years.  I am able to take a balanced view from both the Northern and Southern viewpoints.  Hanging on the walls of my study are pictures of Lee, Jackson, Meade and Grant.  I deeply respect them all and after 100's of books feel i know them and how they would act and what they would say.

This movie's dialog is implausible.  It's presentation of what people would say and when they would say it is just flat wrong.  It is NOT the actors' faults.  Lang, Duvall and the rest did the best they could with the words they were given.

Just by way of a few examples, upon seeing Fredricksburg before the battle, Lee begins to wax poetic about the city.  Hogwash.  He would be saying ""where are my guns. is longsteet up?  what are the position of those people? how many men do they have? are they bringing more up?  what can possibly be delaying Jackson?"".  The dialog spoken by Duvall's Lee is just plain inaccurate, implausible and inappropriate.

Stephen Lang was by far the most abused of all of the actors.  His Stonewall Jackson is given words to say that he just would not say.  It is not Lang's fault as his Pickett in Gettyburg, and the dialog that he speaks in that film was dead-on accurate and a stunningly accurate portrayal of Pickett.  The cold and detached real -life Jackson of whom it was said ""he would have a man killed at the drop of a hat, and he would drop it himself""  or when seeing his soldiers spare the life of a brave union soldier was heard to remark to his men ""I don't want them brave, i want them dead"", is reduced to a simpering teddy bear with gold stars.

The entire fault of this film can be distilled in one moment from one scene.  During Fredericksburg, when the Union Irish Brigade was making its assualt on the stone wall at the base of Marye's heights, it is well known that many of the Confederates behind that wall were also Irish.  The film shows a confederate soldier, tears in his eyes, firing at his fellow countrymen, barely able to pull the trigger for all of his weepiness.  Again, hogwash.  By Fredreicksburg then men of Longsteet's Corp, irish and otherwise, had already fought against the Irish Brigade at both Antietam and during the Seven Days to the point where even Lee already referred to them as ""that damn fighting 69th"".  To even insinuate that they would be overcome with emotion in the midst of the fighting destroys the entire reality of Civil War combat...its ferocity, its remorselessness.  There would have been other far better ways to convey the point that yes, Irish fought Irish and perhaps the men might have spent a moment or two, OFF of the line of battle, mulling on that.

There are as many examples of how this film gets the War wrong as there are scenes in the film.

This is my first film review as i have never been moved to this extent to make sure that no one watches this...ever.

I don't recommend it.  I wish I hadnt watched it.  I felt the need to purge myself and repent by watching Cold Mountain and Gettysburg",1365811200,48,3595,4.453292496171516
1886629,2,B00009OOFB,"One of the worst Civil War movies ever! The story seemed too big to tell in a single movie, and it became disjointed and sketchy after a while. Perhaps the producers should have narrowed the focus of the film to make it more manageable. The battle scenes are okay at best [nothing like the dramatic scenes at the Little Roundtop & Pickett's Charge in Ted Turner's other film, Gettysburg]. This movie has a pro-Confederacy slant, and there's nothing wrong with that per se. Yes, they were fighting for Southern independence and states rights [both noble goals worth contesting]. The South made a monumental effort towards the realization of these goals. However, this film was just too idealistic and seemed to suggest that slavery [the most divisive & controversial of all states' rights issues] with all of its horror, injustice & inhumanity just wasn't a significant part of the problem - when, in fact, it was at the core of the problem.",1365811200,2,940,4.84472049689441

Becoming acquainted with so much of the stories and history of that terrible war, I guess I expected more from this movie.  That is my fault.

1886677,5,B00009OOFB,"First, you need to be a Civil War person to even think about buying this.

Second, you will need about a 3-hour block of time to watch it.

Answering ""yes"" to both of the above gives you a viewing experience that can be enjoyable and/or enraging or both.

The film has a unique view of slavery and slaves that was very upsetting to the general public during the run in theaters.
The film portrays slaves as generally accepting their condition even as they wish for freedom.
Additionally, the film has a number of Afro-Americans working for the Confederate Army without any apparent problems.

This is a hagiography of Thomas Jackson!

Closer to history than most films, it omits the incidents that could tarnish the shinning image.
Stephen Lang, a better actor than his reputation indicates, is a credible Jackson.
The portrayal is more loving husband than Old Testament prophet or ""Old Tom Fool"" instructor.
Lang follows the script doing a good job in making Jackson loveable.

The battles depicted are First Manassas, Antietam, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville.
The producers use experienced re-enactors as extras, 7,500 of them, providing a very realist look to the battles.
The battles are very short on history but used as a stage for incidents involving Jackson.

Bee's gift to Jackson of a nickname, at First Manassas, is well done.

Antietam is more of a Jackson says something than the  battle.

Fredericksburg fails to mention Mead breaking Jackson's line.  In fact, the battle is more Lee and Longstreet than anything.
The movie treats Burnside harshly repeating all the discredited ""should a, would a, could a"" arguments used against him.

Chancellorsville is the best of the battles.  The attack is well done and the route of Howard's Corps realistic.  Jackson's wounding is accurate.

Left out of the movie is every questionable Jackson performance in battle and every silly argument he started or continued.
The only hint of personnel problems is in two small scenes, quickly ended.

Over one hour of additional footage makes this a true extended edition.
This is not holding a scene longer or a couple of extra camera shots.
John Wilkes Booth and Antietam are not in the original release.

Blu-ray produces a scrumptious visual feast.
This is the type of film that makes Blu-ray worthwhile with long battle lines and landscapes.
Special features are a new introduction and commentaries.

This is the prequel to ""Gettysburg"" and uses many of the same actors.
The years between the two movies has visibly aged several of them.
The result can be disconcerting with men well into middle-age playing characters in their 30s.

Much of this is nitpicking.

For a Civil War person this is a real treat at a great price.  I was very happy to find this in my Christmas stocking.",1357516800,,2787,4.950537634408602
1886678,5,B00009OOFB,"I watched the 4-hour version of this movie because I read some reviews of the theatrical release not being as good.
This movie was a huge undertaking, and Stone Wall Jackson was magnificent.

After reading much on the Southern war for Independence, it is good to see a picture that portrayed the South in a fair and realistic manner.  Everything has a cost, nothing is free and the tragedy of this war is that the South fought for the God given right of people to govern themselves and for a republican form of government.  At the start of the war, the North fought the south not for the reason of slavery but from public outrage that the South should have the audacity to leave the union.  Simply put the North was so furious that the South left the Union that they were willing to slaughter, rape, pillage and plunder their once sister states.  The issue of slavery used for the moral high ground of the North came as the war progressed.

The South lost, states rights destroyed, a long with it a Republican form of government and self-governance by the people.

The North won ended slavery, which would have ended eventually, centralized government, and open the doors for the destruction of the government as originally designed by the founders and allowed the importation of socialism.

It is surprising to see Ted Turner make a movie showing Confederate soldiers shouting the battle cry for Independence and for those (very few) honest historians that read both sides of this issue I find this movie very rewarding.

Stephan Lang as Stone Wall Jackson is deserving of an Academy Award.

If you want to see an honest movie, portraying the Confederacy at the beginning of the war of Southern Independence the four-hour version of this movie is necessary.",1357516800,,1758,4.753289473684211

Limiting this force was the intent of the U.S. Constitution. Can one question the official history ? Could slavery have ended differently without over half-a-million deaths?

Sure, Gettysburg has a little flare for the romantic in its own way but for some reason it works.  I think it's balanced better. Gods and Generals just gets carried away. There is some striking photography now and then but not enough to carry the film on its own.  It also suffers from a few distressingly bad digital effects.

If you want accuracy see Ken Burnes Documentary ""Civil War,"" which is also on Amazon.com. Now back to Gods & Generals.

Let me be clear, I have removed most of my original criticism as I feel its a waste of time. There may be some technical facts in this movie. As far as how it represents ""truth"" however is repugnant. Just a few examples, Jackson had some severe personality quirks, sadistic, but he comes off as a virtual saint in this movie. His military tactics were effective, his compassion for others, including his own soldiers--IRL--did not exist.  The soldiers in reality, were so filthy and tattered, due to lack of food, as well as being pushed to their limits. Historical evidence from written letters, etc., often, people said you could smell them before you saw them. These same soldiers in the movie, looked like they bathed in lilac water every night, and ate Caviar. The feel of the war which you can clearly get from the documentary I mentioned as an alternative, shows how this story is flawed. A since of reality includes more than sterile statistics and quotations, but an entire feel for the history. Some reviewers have said this vindicates the South, and proves the war was not about slavery. This too is a myth, but sometimes people prefer myths.",1354320000,3,1544,4.757462686567164
1886703,3,B00009OOFB,"What was the movie, Gods and Generals, actually about?  Too many things, sadly.  Others have deplored the portrayal of the Southern position on slavery as incomplete; and even a few objected to the seeming unanimity of the Northern position (which, in fact, is not portrayed as unanimous).  Had those positions, and additional battles, been included, this would have been a 9 hour movie!  The problem was not too little detail, but too much.  When the viewer makes his way through the film, he eventually becomes aware that it is a film about General ""Stonewall"" Jackson.  Why then does it start with Robert E. Lee being offered command of the union army?  Robert Duvall is magnificent as Lee, and I wished I'd seen more of him, but then that should be a different movie entirely.  Early on, it seems that Gods and Generals is going to be about religious beliefs in the war, and not about the fighting at all; but then halfway through it changes and becomes about the battles.

Following this battle in Gods & Generals, Gen Lee decided to take the army and march on an invasion of the north, - a journey which would conclude with the Battle of Gettysburg.

It was written and directed by Ronald F. Maxwell, who had previously written and directed Gettysburg in 1993. Media mogul Ted Turner provided the $65 million budget.

Gods & Generals 'visualises' the siege at 1st Bull Run (1st Manassas), Fredericksburg Town during the opening stages of the conflict. We see in this movie how Lawrence (Geoff Daniels as Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Chamberlain) and his Brother C. Thomas Howell as Lieutenant Thomas Chamberlain, are brought together prior to their roles which they reprised in Gettysburg.

The soundtrack isn't as good or profound as in Gettysburg for me, even as composed Randy Edelman as in Gettysburg, but otherwise a solid film and sweeping epics of the Civil War. It is few and far between, that Civil War films are made on this scale.

Notes: Ted Turner has a cameo in the film as Colonel Waller T. Patton. Colonel Patton, the great uncle of George S. Patton, was mortally wounded at Gettysburg, a scene depicted in the movie Gettysburg.",1353283200,3,1386,4.8354430379746836

1886718,4,B00009OOFB,"I thought this film was pretty good.  There are several reasons.

First, I find that most war films are so anti-war that it doesn't resemble the war itself - it focuses on one perspective.  This film tries to show why the South left the Union and shows how passionate the combatants were about the right of their side.  Furthermore, it shows that there was a sense of glory in fighting for the right - a thought which is lost on most film makers who attempt to tackle the subject of war.  However, the film does not shy away from the darker sides of war as we see the Irish fighting each other.

I think the film is also pretty good because it is edited quite well.  The scenes blend well and you generally don't feel rushed.

The fact that the film was based on historical fact is greatly appreciated as well.

The soundtrack as well is excellent.  I have purchased the cd since I enjoyed it so well.

""Gettysburg"" is the movie that is shown at the National Military Park in Gettysburg.  I do not think this movie was as good as ""Gettysburg"", but few will ever be.  I have been to Gettysburg and stood on Little Round Top and looked out at all the battlesfields. The movie ""Gettysburg"" stayed more true to history in my opinion and made you feel the emotions of the characters.  ""Gods and Generals"" gives you more of a view of Stonewall Jackson rather than Lee.  I will say Duvall played a much better Lee than Martin Sheenan did in Gettysburg. If you are interested in this era than, while this is not quit as good as Gettysburg, it does give you a look into the life of Stonewall Jackson, and the likeness and differences between them.",1349049600,,978,4.441340782122905

1886747,4,B00009OOFB,"When this movie first came out around ten years ago I heard through the grapevine that it was long and boring and lousy and not worth my ticket money or time! Flash forward to a week ago.  I noticed this two disc DVD in a bargain bin at FYE.  It was going for peanuts - and I did an Abbott and Costello pack/unpack routine in my mind for a few minutes.  I kept remembering all those who had told me to beware the phony beards and stilted speechifying in this flick - and that the monologues were even more bloated and bloviatingly boring than those in the same director's GETTYSBURG, of which GODS AND GENERALS was a prequel.  Anyhow, I paid the five bucks or so for the two disc turkey.  I had been wanting to wean off of sleeping pills of late - and thought that this type of big bloated boring bilge might do me in for a natural snooze.

Wow!!!

If for NO other reason than to see Stephen Lang give an Oscar-worthy performance as ""Stonewall"" Jackson, the five or so bucks were indubitably worth every penny.  How could this be the same man whose boozy breath I could smell off the screen in TOMBSTONE wherein Mr. Lang portrayed the scurvy Ike Clanton?  And remembering back, was this the same actor who incarnated Happy Loman so beautifully in the Dustin Hoffman DEATH OF A SALESMAN?  And was the General Jackson in GODS AND GENERALS once popinjay Pickett in GETTYSBURG? They were  and are all the same magnificent actor!  And because GODS AND GENERALS tragically tanked at the box office (and thereby killing the plans, it seems, for the final installment of the projected trilogy) Mr. Lang gets nary a nod from the un-astute Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Science.  Yet as evidenced in this film, Lang's General Jackson is what acting is all about.  He is captivating, intoxicatingly watchable, fully dimensioned and all encompassing.  So, as said, if Mr. Lang's performance were the only reason to watch this film, it is very much reason enough.

It is easy, yes, to beat up on this film.  It does have too many sermons, fake beards here and there, not nearly enough of Robert Duvall's visually impressive Robert E. Lee.  There is a deluge of treacly music underscoring so many scenes that would have worked much better without it.  The slavery issue is not dealt with in any depth at all.  The battles - especially those on the first disc - were mostly dull and sanitized.  The distant views of Confederate cities are too obviously paintings.  The few CGI effects are poor.  If it were not for the character of Stonewall Jackson, I might have stalled on disc two, putting it off for another day.

But I didn't.  And with disc two, the movie actually got much better.  It seemed as if it were written and directed by someone other than Ronald Maxwell.  The music, definitely, was mostly wonderful in Act Two.  The music fit the scenes and didn't work against them as it did in Act One.  The music for the build-up and attack at Chancellorsville, as well as the direction and editing of this powerful sequence, were also well worth the discount price I paid for the DVD.  In looking back at the credits, I noticed that there were two composers of the score. That might be the explanation for the seismic shift in musical style.

Other memorable moments: Jackson's heartfelt relationship with the little girl, the execution of three soldiers, the Confederate Christmas scene and the incredibly moving extension of the Christmas scene where Johnny Reb and Billy Yank meet halfway on a stone path in the river that separates them in their guard duty.  That scene in and of itself makes GODS AND GENERALS worth the time to watch it.  And in that scene of the meeting of the two soldiers, it is what isn't said that makes the scene the powerful one that it is. And thank God the screenplay didn't have them philosophizing during their brief encounter! Sometimes...silence is golden, as witness in this riveting sequence. There is also a nighttime scene where Lee and Jackson are discussing the strategy that will lead to Chancellorsville that seemed not so much a scene in a movie, but a tete-a-tete we viewers just happened upon.  Of course, Jackson's highly accurate in its depiction death and his final passing are magnificently acted and directed.  And the very last scene of the film is deeply poetic and profound on many levels.

The extras are of some interest. The JOURNEY TO THE PAST mini-documentary goes into more depth on the slavery issue than anything really in the film. The documentary on Jackson is all-too-brief, but what there was of it was okay.  Especially the shots of the statue. The music video by Bob Dylan is bizarre.  But the bottom line in all this is - GODS AND GENERALS - though very flawed, is also very fine.  Especially with Stephen Lang as the very flawed but very fine General ""Stonewall"" Jackson.  This performance in this movie is not to be missed.",1346371200,3,4890,4.627610208816705

I like the acting in this movie, especially that of Stephen Lang, who plays as Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson. I appreciate how this movie exhibits Jackson as both a fervent soldier and as a devout christian. Jackson seems to play a bigger role in this movie than Lee did. Despite an austere man in the realm of warfare, Jackson is a refreshing character: one who is a loving husband calling his wife ""my esposita"", passionate christian putting his trust in God even in the battlefield, and surprisingly compassionate. During the battle scenes, I also appreciate how the movie labels each company and grouping for context.

1886766,4,B00009OOFB,"Last night's late night movie was the ""Gods and Generals"" DVD. It was an interesting reenactment of a part of the American Civil War. My feeling was that to really appreciate and enjoy the movie, you'd have to be deeply immersed in knowledge of the war and it's participants. It would seem essential, and then the movie might become ever better. I have little such knowledge. To me it was amazing and educational to view with it's cast of thousands and all the historical sites and such. The costuming was interesting and well done. The acting seemed somewhat stiff and wooden and many of the conversations were given like little mini-speeches expected to be heard by all. The stances often looked like something you'd see in paintings exhibited for patriotic reasons. There seemed to be much too great of an emphasis on God and religion, but then I don't know what the feelings and beliefs were at that time.

The American Civil War is always listed very high on any tabulation of casualties and casualty rates. Well, if the reenactments of these battles are at all accurate, you can certainly see why the casualty rates were so high. The lines and groups of people standing and firing into other lines and groups of people who are returning the fire would certainly lend itself to high casualty rates. Good grief, war is dumb in general, but certainly it couldn't have been this dumb. What was the purpose, just to kill as many people as possible? Other things seemed seriously off. In some instances, generals were giving speeches and instructions to hundreds of men scattered about areas of perhaps 5 acres without any PA systems or without shouting. Gosh. I wonder if the movie directors have ever tried to speak to a group of people outside. Well, pick, pick, pick. The movie lends itself to this kind of petty criticism. Actually, I rather enjoyed seeing it, but the movie seemed ultra long and became somewhat tedious. I think if you're really interested in the Civil War, you'd want to have this DVD in your library.

1886799,2,B00009OOFB,"Brilliant Biography or Modern Apology?

I believe that either you will love this movie or hate it. There is no question that Stephen Laing's portrayal of Stonewall Jackson, in all his strange and warlike piety is one of the finest single performances in war film biography (one is reminded of the movie ""Patton"").

Yet, it is hard to be neutral about the idea of a Divinely Ordained Crusade, which would defend the practice of human slavery on the premise that it would one day wither away. Sadder still is the fact that the slaves themselves, because of their personal loyalties to their enslavers, would accept this as their condition.

Such is the worldview that is repeated over and over in the dialogue and scenes of Gods and Generals, and forms the context around a brilliant biography of Stonewall Jackson brought to life. To the modern viewer, this worldview is foreign, shocking, and anathema to our present way of post-Civil Rights thinking.

Strange things often happen in this film. The personal loyalty of a slave woman to her master's family is touching when Federal soldiers come looting. Yet it is so sad to hear her later speak so wistfully of how she wishes for freedom for her children. Yet when the Federal army vacates Fredericksburg, she remains behind to continue a life of slavery. Historically, this was rarely the case, and that is a well-documented fact.

Earlier in the film another strange thing happens. Robert E. Lee is offered command of the Confederate Army at a meeting of the Confederate Congress at the beginning of the war. This is supposed to mirror George Washington's acceptance of the Continental Army in the War for Independence. Lee didn't take command of the Army of Northern Virginia until 1862 during the Peninsula Campaign. One wonders at the motives for such artistic licentiousness with the facts.

At last, we are left with Stephen Laing's brilliant interpretation of Stonewall Jackson. Laing is able to combine Jackson's mixture of radical militant piety, callous disregard for all those around him, and his narcissist single mindedness, in a character that brings biography to life in a way that writers have been unable.

One is better able to understand the insanity of Stonewall Jackson at least as a product of an insane man, operating in a time when a worldview existed that allowed him the space to express all his insanity, in a few important years in our nation's history.

There is no question that Jackson was a brilliant general in the world of Napoleonic strategy and tactics, even if he was proving on the battlefield (with his insistence on the bayonet charge against rifled muskets) that this era had already passed. But that is not what this film is about.

In this film we meet a part mixture of modern revision of the Lost Cause theory and part period correct worldview. The Lost Cause theory was developed in the 1880's to help Southerners rebuild their society with some sense of dignity. There is little question that historically some Southerners ascribed to the divine crusade idea, especially during the religious revival that swept through the Confederate Army in 1864 (although that was two to three years after the events that the movie portrays), and formed the later basis for Lost Cause theory.

While we may have gained a greater understanding of Stonewall Jackson, our understanding of an era is further hindered by this wishful and gratuitous mix of fact and fiction, which has always been the legacy of the Lost Cause literature's contribution to American Historical scholarship. It is up to the viewer to sort out fact from fiction, and reflect on the relevance and place of Lost Cause Revisionism in our understanding of American History in the 21st century.",1324771200,5,3746,4.931746031746032

1886801,5,B00009OOFB,"I just plain don't understand those that don't like this movie.  I just don't get it.  Basically the negatives that are levied against this movie seem to pretty much come down to the following groups of people/concerns:

1) Those that take offense with the religious (i.e. Christian) overtones.

MY RESPONSE: I personally find this one amusing.  There are some who seem to think this is a pro-Christian movie that is trying bash people over the head with Christianity.  Let me tell you something:  I am a Christian and try to take my faith seriously, and I have AVOIDED showing this movie to unbelievers because I actually believe it can conceivably leave some people with a NEGATIVE view towards Christianity.  Yes this movie does periodically explore religious motivations and thoughts of some of the characters.  But it shows those motivations on BOTH sides (both North and South) - you get to see BOTH sides talking about how they believe God is on their side and for their cause!  I don't get what's so wrong with a film showing this and exploring the religious angle a bit, because you KNOW - especially at that time - that religion most certainly DID play a major role on both sides, with many on both sides believing that God would help them win the victory, etc.  Although much of the faith stuff is centered around Gen. Jackson (South) which generally does show Christianity in a favorable light as we see how his strong faith helped him and was a great comfort to him both on the battlefield and in his dying days, there are some points which don't do so as well, such as one where Jackson responds something along the lines that he wants to just kill all the enemy - ""every last one of them"" kind of thing (this may only be in the extended cut of the film, I can't remember).  That certainly doesn't mesh that well with the type of ""Christianity"" I'd like portrayed to non-believers.  We also see Jackson as a Christian praying for an unbelieving dying general stating something like ""I'll believe for the two of us since you don't believe"".  Any Christian that's read their Bible knows that's not how it works.

Plus, it shows a more ""liberal"" type of Christianity with how it's portrayed with Chamberlain (North) as compared to Jackson, so it's portrayal of Christianity is kind of mixed and not consistent anyway.

Personally, as a Christian, yes I did find this film to be affirming to me in my faith because of Jackson.  I saw the same peace and comfort that Jackson seemed to have and know from his faith in Jesus, as I have in mine.

But I can easily see an unbeliever watching this film coming away just thinking that all the Christianity stuff (and indeed religion in general) is nuts since both sides had people that believed in God and believed God was for them, and at the end of the day, war is an ugly ugly thing with lots and lots of people dead.  It's a very flawed argument in my view, but I can easily see people coming to such a conclusion.  Thus I don't see this as the great big ""Christian evangelism"" film that by the way some people talk (including many Christians) one might think it is.  And those non-Christians that are supposedly so offended by this film, I just don't get it.

Further, given the total runtime of the movie, the religious statements are actually quite few all things considered, so it seems to me most people could just look past this anyway if they really don't care what the characters thought in the religious sphere.

(2) Somewhat related to number 1, there are those that believe that this should have been more like Gettysburg (which has a more documentary-type feel).  These people mostly seem to be the Civil War History nuts who know every last date and battle and want a film that completely and utterly just portrays all the historical facts.  They could care less about any ""drama"" - these people scoff at the scenes such as occur between a little girl and General Jackson in the movie.  They don't really care much about humanizing the people.

MY RESPONSE: One of the absolute strengths of this movie in my opinion is that it is NOT just about facts and battles, but actually takes you into the realm of motivations, thoughts, feelings of the people involved - making them REAL people and not just some glossed-over ""fact"" on a page.  If I wanted to see a documentary on the Civil War and see every battle and every person involved, I'd watch one on the History Channel or something.  But if you, like me, want to see a Hollywood MOVIE that has stunning visuals/audio, that also by most accounts is pretty historically accurate with what it shows, this is the best one I've seen!

Some people felt the filmmakers tried to show too much in the movie and thus went too many directions - which thus made it seem ""boring"".  I never felt that way - it kept my attention all the way through and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Ironically many of the people that have levied this criticism of the movie, like the Extended Edition better (which is actually an hour longer) because they feel it is more complete than the original by setting up scenes better and including things such as Antietam.  Personally, although I like the extended edition, I DID start to find myself getting bored a tiny bit with it and can see WHY Antietam was cut from the original - its inclusion made the film ""drag on"" a bit for me.  I realize from a historical perspective that Antietam was important.  But from a theatrical movie perspective, given the other battle scenes in the movie, I understand why they originally cut it out and I don't fault them for it.  The whole added ""Booth"" subplot of the extended edition, while intriguing, is largely a waste to me unless they ever make that long-mentioned 3rd film and tie that in.  And the added ""chapter"" divisions actually kind of annoyed me a bit by taking away some from the ""flowing movie"" feel.  Between the extended edition and the theatrical, although I enjoyed the extended, I actually think I prefer the theatrical.

3) Those that believe it is too far out of balance and believe it is too pro-South, not ""anti-slavery"" enough, too focused on a few specific people, etc.

MY RESPONSE: While this movie does go against the politically-correct flow a bit, that's part of what MAKES this movie such a great film!  Yes, it does explore the Southern side heavier than the North, but plenty of other films explore the North's position much more than the South.  Most of us already have been told a lot about the North's positions - what's wrong with exploring the South a bit more??  And this movie DOES showcase the North as well (even more so in the extended edition).

Yes, it focused on only a few individuals.  But it used those individuals to try to help showcase what was going on on an individual level with people at that time.  Why can't people just accept that for what it is??  If you are expecting this movie to be a documentary on the first few years of the war, you will be sorely disappointed.  But if you are looking to see a cinematic movie that while exploring some of the events of the first few years of the war, delves deeper into the ""human element"", this does that very well.

It is true that slavery, while still clearly mentioned and portrayed as an evil in the film, is not directly shown with the few black characters in the film to be personally horrible by experience to them.  We do see some of the blacks and the whites in the South getting along (and even liking one another) which the PC police would have you believe could never have happened.  And yes that does bother some people that believe that the whole war was just all about slavery and that everyone in the South were giant meanies who hated all blacks and treated them like dirt (and that all blacks in the South were treated like dirt) and that everyone in the North were fighting solely for the blacks.  This film does mess with that commonly accepted narrative a bit, by showing that in reality things might have been a bit more complex than that...

SUMMARY: If a person is not willing to consider on a deeper human level some of the thoughts and feelings that might have been going on at that time (and for which indeed historically can be shown DID go on at that time) that one is not taught in your standard history class, including religious thoughts and motivations, then I guess one could really take offense at this film.  And if a person is expecting this film to show every battle and person involved in the first few years of the war and be balanced between the Northern and Southern views, then a person would have a problem with this film and probably find it boring (not enough ""battle action"" and too much drama)

But if a person can just take it for what it is: A Cinematic movie that tells some stories that provide some insight into historical events of the first few years of the Civil War, I don't think you'll be disappointed and can easily count this among one of the better films you've seen!

BLU-RAY review: Finally, specifically regarding the Blu-Ray Extended Edition quality, which is what this review is listed under: Overall I found it perfectly fine for a Blu-Ray. The picture quality was generally detailed and clear, though inconsistent. The color ""vibrancy"" and warmth seemed to be lacking as compared to the theatrical DVD (i.e. on my Sony t.v. with default settings the DVD actually looked better as far as the warmth of the color), but since most all t.v.'s can tweak the color settings, this isn't a huge deal.  I can't comment on surround sound, since I've only got a stereo setup, but for what it's worth, it sounded great in stereo with no noticeable problems with the mix.  All in all, I did prefer watching this in Blu-Ray.  As to whether the extended edition is worth purchasing, I would say yes, but I think I do personally prefer the theatrical a bit more (see #2 above for more info on why).",1323648000,6,9927,4.55686936936937

1886815,5,B00009OOFB,"Finally a movie on a major scale that is not Socialist propaganda.

10% of Southern people owned slaves. Leaving 90% who didn't.
Yet from the Socialist/New World Order mindset of the day, you would think the opposite percentages apply.  How you ignore 90% of anything is astounding. Yet we have it fully entrenched for those who don't think, or research for themselves.

Gods and Generals takes one back to 1860, when the States actually meant something and were Sovereign.  That war was about control, and has had it's history written; by the victors.  When you win, you get to influence the people in future generations, with your carefully controlled slants, from wordsmiths. But this movie might actually give you a glimpse of truth; that 90% of people in the South fought to defend their States from an invading horde, masquerading as ""freedom fighters"". It may actually cause you to think that such a large percentage of people; would risk their lives and property to preserve, SMALL government.  Moreover, the movie exposes the myth and lie, that Southerners fought to make a rich slave holder, more wealthy.

1886816,4,B00009OOFB,"This new ""director's cut"" is a big improvement over the theatrical release.  Historical inaccuracies (Lee riding a horse at Antietam, Lee looking down at Sharpsburg from the wrong side of the river, slaves viewed more as members of the family than, well, slaves) remain, but the less the film focuses on Jackson, the better.  Visually, it looks great.  Unfortunately, there's no way to free the film from the characters speechifying at each other rather than talking.  This goes well beyond the normal ""dialogue as conveying facts to the audience"" that inflicts many historical films.  The worst example is still Jeff Daniels reciting some lengthy Roman text out loud while waiting to go into action at Fredricksburg.

1886818,2,B00009OOFB,"Jeff Shaara inherited and tried to perpetuate the family Civil War franchise. Whether the last name is Earnhardt or Roosevelt or Bush or Shaara, sons have often found it hard to follow the footsteps of famous fathers when they pursue the same career. The comment on most of his books was ""well-researched, accurate, pretty dull compared to dad's original."" The same comparison could be made between the first movie made from the son's book and ""Gettysburg,"" the one made from dad's.

The original suffered from a few too many ""stirring"" (i.e., painfully long and dull) speeches by Chamberlain, Armistead, Lee, and others. But its saving grace was that fabulous story -- plus some excellent acting.

When ""Gods and Generals"" was being filmed, much was made about the painstaking efforts to maintain historical authenticity -- the accuracy of the uniforms and equipment, the approvals from all the historians and re-enactor groups, etc. It certainly is respectful of the history. Well, maybe a little too much ""Lost Cause"" nonsense, but that's a story for another day ...

Unfortunately, they forgot to make an interesting movie. It's just dull. In some ways, it reminds me of those outdoor-drama historical pageants like ""Lost Colony"" and ""Trumpet in the Land"" and the ""Passion Play,"" where the cast of thousands takes turns standing around and staring as one actor after another delivers a long, windy monologue.

Some of the reviewers who like the movie say the critics just can't stand the fact that the movie portrays Confederates with respect. That problem is utterly irrelevant. The producers of ""Gettysburg"" treated the Confederate leaders and cause with just as much respect and nobody complained. The problem isn't political correctness, it's the fact that this movie is boring. Authentic equipment, historically accurate speeches, and good cinematography are nice supplements for a good yarn, but they are not a substitute.",1319846400,4,1932,5.22258064516129
1886819,2,B00009OOFB,"This appeared to be a religious, preachy type film with the Civil War as its background.  While I can appreciate the historical accuracy of the film and I even enjoyed the pro-South perspective, this film flooded the viewer with biblical quotes from Stonewall Jackson as he simultaneously angrily told his men to ""Kill 'em all"" when referring to the Union soldiers.  I understand that Jackson was a deeply religious man, but when the movie had him walk out onto an empty field and lift his hands to God while discussing an upcoming battle and perhaps his death, I scratched my head and thought perhaps I had bought a film by the Left Behind directors.  In one scene, Jackson tells one of his subordinates the bible is full of battle plans and eventually hands the bible to one of him and tells him it will help him write the daily reports.

It seemed that any dialogue the Jackson actor had included a religious theme.  In one scene, Jackson and his slave cook look up to the heavens and Jackson, once again, begins to pray out loud.  When he is done, the slave prays out loud and ask God why some people are enslaved.  I thought to myself, that either Jackson was one compassionate man, or, Hollywood took creative liberty in the scene.  Seems to me that the cook would have been fired on the spot or taken out and shot.  Slavery as a whole was glossed over.  The slaves in the movie were not treated as slaves let alone employees - they were viewed and treated as family and I found that to be a bit far fetched.  In fact, the slaves appeared to love their masters, and why not - they were equals in the film.

Anyhow, rather than go on and on, I will say that if you are a religious person, you may not even be bothered by the dominating religious theme of the movie.  Enjoy this movie from the perspective of the South and if you get a chance, go visit Fredericksburg, VA.

1886821,4,B00009OOFB,"In spite of the prayerful pretensions of this film, I rather enjoyed it.
From the title, you might expect a gritty war epic in the style of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rome/dp/B0028RXXE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rome</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B0026L7H20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>&nbsp;but in its place you will get one of those lovey-dovey nicey-nicey American epics where every rough edge (e.g. battle violence, coarse language etc) is smoothed out.

Fortunately for this film it isn't too corny and the excellent battle scenes more than offset the piety of General 'Stonewall' Jackson (who actually comes across more as 'Sugarlump' Jackson).
I also found, as a Brit, that this film was an excellent education in the American Civil war. Whereas Wikipedia or books on the subject have a tendency to make battles seem dry and boring, this film fully encapsulates the First Battle of the Bull Run, the Battle of Fredericksburg and the Battle of Chancellorville, all the while enabling you to see why the Southern generals were seen as so gifted.

That said, you can't get away from the impression that producer Ted Turner (who does the commentary) makes up for his bleak news reports (""by 1990, we will all be dead from Aids"") by making historical movies that are the polar opposite. Though the battles and action are convincing, the dialogue and characters can come over a little too saccharine and pious when really, as other reviewers have commented, 'Stonewall' Jackson was far more gritty than he is portrayed. In a way, you wish that Turner had included a little bit more of his realism in the film, so that the characters were a little bit more 3D.

While on the films faults, I'd also criticize the films extras, which had very little extra information on the battles portrayed in the film. Yes - there is an exploration of 'Stonewall' Jackson, but it would have also been good to see more information on the actual history and what the battles were (the names of the battles are not mentioned in the film, and such knowledge is rather assumed).

Anyways, aside from this the film is well worth watching and is essential viewing if you want to understand the third Anglo-Saxon civil war (the first and second being the English Civil War and the American War of independence respectively).
One last thing to point out is that it is possibly a little long at 220 minutes or 3 hours 40 minutes (the type of film that is split over two DVD's). From experience, this is worth bearing in mind if you have work the next morning.",1313280000,2,2689,5.261072261072261
1886822,4,B00009OOFB,"That title is a little misleading, as I am sure Ron Maxwell would tell you that this was the way he envisioned the film in the first place. As many have commented, the additions make many of the scenes that follow make sense, where they previously left you scratching your head as to why they were included. And, perhaps most of all, adding back the batle of Antietam, which, frankly drove me crazy when I saw the original film in the theater, is more than welcome. And, what was filmed was excellent fot this reason. The story was about communicating Chamberlain's point of view. He was in one of the many regiments that McClellan chose not to commit to battle on that fateful day. One of the seemingly thousands of ""what-ifs"" surrounding the Civil War is what would have happened at Antietam if McClellan had commited all forces at his command? And the obvious anquish of the actor who played Chamberlain's commander, Adelbert Ames, really captured the feelings of the soldiers who did not see battle that day.

I also liked the John WIlke's Booth plot. I assume that it would have been a thread that was continued had they made the third book, The Last Full Measure, into a film, and that it would have continued his journey from uninvolved actor to assassin, which would have been great.

But, again as many have noted, it is still too preachy, and, at least for me, the entire subplot involving the young girl who dies and finally releases the pent-up emotion in Stonewall Jackson was totally unnecessary. But, for those of you who have never seen the film, this version is such a major improvement that I can reccomend it to more than just hardcore Civil War history buffs like myself.

Stephen Lang did a marvelous job as Jackson, Jeff Daniels was equally good as Chamberlain, and Robert Duvall, himself a Virginian, was spot-on as Robert E. Lee. Now, if only they would make the third one.....",1313107200,2,1901,4.651785714285714

1886824,5,B00009OOFB,"Being very interested in the Civil War, I have enjoyed both the films GETTYSBURG and GODS AND GENERALS. Both offered a realistic and meaningful insight into the conditions on the battlefield and the sense of duty and honor leaders displayed on both sides of the line. In today's conflicts, the fighting and killing can often be done from afar...or above. During the Civil War, it had to be accomplished, too often, up close and personal. While the carnage depicted in the battle scenes is stark and disturbing, the character and courage of the men on both sides has to be admired. Each side is treated respectfully both as warriors and human beings fighting for larger goals and ideals. The film fortunately resists the temptation to reduce the conflict to a simple struggle over the question of slavery, an approach that would have diminished the historical accuracy of the film and cheapened ideals for which both sides fought.

When I saw the original cut of the film in the theaters, I was surprised to note that the storyline jumped from the First Battle of Manassas directly to the Battle of Fredericksburg, omitting the Peninsular Campaign, Second Manassas, and Antietam. Understandably, no one film could do justice to all of these campaigns, but the omission of anything but a brief reference to Antietam surprised me. The Director's Cut restores that battle and gives better context to what follows at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville.

The director, who also wrote the script for the film, chose to build the storyline primarily around General Stonewall Jackson. The temptation might have been to focus on General Robert E. Lee, but that was done in the film ""Gettysburg."" Jackson proves to be a most interesting - even challenging - central character. ""Old Stonewall"" proves in the film, as in real life, to be a complex and at times contradictory character. He is a man of deep faith and a profound and gentle love for his wife who, when he enters battle, assumes the role of an avenging demon. He can quote the Bible chapter and verse and aspires to be a devoted and faithful servant of his Lord who commands him to love his fellow man, yet Jackson will send his beloved troops headlong into battle, knowing that the meat grinder of shot and shell will end many of their lives. He holds dearly his belief in freedom and country, having spent most of his professional life in the military service of the United States, but he will fight to his death against it when he feels it has betrayed the principles for which it stands. He proves to be an unimaginative, by the book college professor, who when placed in collaboration with General Lee proves to possess one of the most original, daring, and strategically brilliant minds of the war. Thomas J. Jackson proves to be a remarkable and powerful figure.

One can only hope that, in time, Ted Turner and Ron Maxwell will film the final book of the Civil War trilogy, THE LAST FULL MEASURE.",1311638400,7,2955,4.790196078431372

  Lots of Jacksonin the movie, as playing a God,or General etc. another annoying part of war. Not much of a movie you can make with war, many people die in close battle, oh what fun, but it gets better we can even see extremities blown off, oh what a good time. Maybe as a history film this works, for we see in this movie, Fredericksburg appears to be the end of the war for the confederates after they lost. The Yankees whipped them with more money and higher grade weapons. I love that a killing machine. Jackson treats everyone as human, and it's God's destiny that slaves serve the white folk. Jackson has a morphine dream at the end of the movie as he is dieing from getting shot up. I don't think a wonderful way to end the movie, but whatever.

1886842,4,B00009OOFB,"The 2011 Blu-ray G&G director's cut is a great improvement over the 2003 release.

My initial impression after first viewing is that some skilled editing and added scenes have made G&G 2011 less ponderous and, frankly, less boring than G&G 2003.

The music seems less funereal and a bit more upbeat. Jackson's intense religiosity - a bit of a drag in G&G 2003 even if you are religious - has been tempered with some slight levity and added ""common man"" scenes. Even though short they expand Jackon's character and make him more human. I like the added J.W. Booth scenes but wish they would have gone somewhere.

There is more to it than that small sampling of observations but generally the film seems crisper and brighter as a story than G&G 2003, which I watched just a few days ago.

On the minus side, I wasn't thrilled with the added Antietam segment. I was glad to see it included as an accurate historic progression in the film, since 1862 without Antietam is a bit dubious. But it could have used a bit more action.

In any case Gods and Generals is now what it should have been in 2003, an accurate, engaging, and compelling rendering of this monumental turning point in America's history.",1308182400,6,1198,4.605633802816901
1886843,4,B00009OOFB,"Ron Maxwell's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gettysburg/dp/B0019NG73G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gettysburg</a>"" has long been amongst my favorite films. Thus, upon hearing of the production of ""Gods and Generals,"" this time intended for theatrical release from the very beginning and realized with a theatrical budget, I hoped that it would be even better than its predecessor. However, the poor reviews upon its debut discouraged me from viewing the film until several years later, when I found the DVD in the bargain bin for $5.

I liked most of what I saw -- certainly the heightened intensity of the battles, Stephen Lang's tour-de-force performance as Jackson -- but I realized that it was not up to par with Maxwell's previous achievement with ""Gettysburg."" The story was too broad and lacked focus, the dialogue was peppered with soliloquies and quotations ad nauseum and reeked of pretense, extremely unconvincing digital matte work that pulls the audience out of the picture, and, more disquieting, the film's treatment/glossing over of the Confederate slaves rang false. I could admire the film for its ambition, but overall ""Gods and Generals"" was a film I had come to tolerate rather than one that I held in high regard.

The good news is that this Extended Director's Cut is decidedly better paced than the theatrical version of the film despite increasing its length by a full hour. By splitting the narrative into five acts, Maxwell has created a sense of tighter focus to each of these segments and improved the flow. Furthermore, additions such as Jackson's discovery of Little Sorrel add much needed levity to the proceedings and better develop the narrative and characters, and the inclusion of the Battle of Antietam helps the film feel more complete from a historical perspective. Also, the much-awaited subplot featuring John Wilkes Booth is mostly an enhancement, with Booth functioning like a Greek chorus throughout the picture and the performance of the actor is very well done.

The bad news is that ""Gods and Generals"" remains a heavily-flawed film. The majority of the faults described above still apply, and the Booth-as-commentary scenes are occasionally too on-the-nose (especially the Hamlet soliloquy over footage of Antietam's aftermath). If you thoroughly disliked the theatrical version, the Extended Director's Cut is unlikely to win you over, but if you enjoyed the theatrical version, there's more here to enjoy and it is presented in a more well-rounded manner. On a five-star scale, the original cut would earn 3 stars and the Extended Director's Cut would earn 3.5 stars.

Having upgraded straight from the DVD, I can't compare this new Blu-ray to that of the theatrical release. The video presentation is somewhat inconsistent; one minute it will look stunning while the next will look soft and mediocre. The audio, however, is spectacular. Regarding special features, the original commentary, featurettes, and music videos are ported over, and a new commentary for the Extended Cut has also been provided, as well as a welcome new HD introduction by Ron Maxwell and Ted Turner where the two men discuss their intentions with their two Civil War epics. The DigiBook packaging, while not as nice as that for ""Gettysburg,"" is still handsome and will look nice on your shelf.

All-in-all, this Director's Cut Blu-ray is definitely a step-up from the theatrical version, but it is not a miraculous revelation on the level of the ""Kingdom of Heaven"" or ""The Abyss"" extended cuts. ""Gods and Generals"" remains a respectfully-ambitious-yet-flawed epic on the most contentious period in American history, and for anyone who enjoyed the film in its previous incarnation or who is simply interested in the American Civil War, it comes highly recommended.",1307491200,10,3828,5.33112582781457
1886844,4,B00009OOFB,"""Gods and Generals,"" a prequel to the 1993 successful classic ""Gettysburg,"" will never resonate as strongly as its sibling film.  This can be attributed to many reasons - principally, the fact that it tackles a subject much broader in scope and, consequently, less focused in plot.  From the beginning, ""Gods and Generals"" seems to struggle, at times awkwardly, with both its obligation to provide exposition for ""Gettysburg"" and director Maxwell's desire to tell a discrete story about the importance of home, honor, and patriotism as those values mattered to Civil War era Americans.

The Civil War is undoubtedly the most studied epoch in American history.  ""Gods and Generals"" fits into the varying interpretations of the struggle as a sort of neo-Lost Cause treatment, suffering as well from a current reactionary political agenda that seeks to disparage any purported ""big government"" motives of Lincoln and Northern leaders.  On the one hand, we can respect the filmmakers' attempts to portray Southern mindsets at the time; on the other hand, we must accept this treatment with a heavy dose of caution.

""Gods and Generals"" is an intellectual epic.  If you wish to enjoy a war film of brutish bloodletting and Laconic morals, look elsewhere.  If you wish to hear competing, protracted explanations of the sharply divided opinions which characterized our most divisive conflict, give ""Gods and Generals"" a try.  Were the film as successful as the grandfather of Hollywood ""Lost Cause"" interpretations - ""Birth of a Nation"" - its emphasis on Southern virtues and supposed ambivalence about slavery might be more challenging to the growing consensus about slavery as the primary cause of the war.  And, had this occurred, one positive result could have been a renewed discussion of the war's causation and meaning as we approach the sesquicentennial.  ""Gods and Generals,"" however, was not a successful film.  It is loathed by many Civil War scholars who view it as unbalanced and disingenuous, and the public remains largely unaware of it because it is not a film one can simply enjoy in the background of a busy lifestyle.  That the film has been so orphaned does not mean it is not worth a chance, or, in this case, a second chance.

The extended director's cut of ""Gods and Generals"" is the way this film should have been presented - essentially a miniseries in five parts.  The film no longer feels rushed to include all that it must.  Character development, battle scenes, and some thematic elements are greatly improved.  By a wide margin the most impressive trait of this entire epic is the awe-inspiring score by John Frizzell.  Hopefully, someday in the future, we shall enjoy an extended soundtrack release; no film more merits it.  Period.

Director Ron Maxwell is a quixotic filmmaker whose gift for old-fashioned intellectual drama, like his attempt to make some elements of the Confederacy palatable to modern audiences, seems out of place today.  The thought-provoking nature of this film, however, makes it a rewarding experience on many levels if taken with a grain of salt.  Viewers must be advised that the majority of screen time, even in this director's cut featuring much more on Joshua Chamberlain, goes to Confederate personalities; it is their attitudes we hear, their arguments we receive.  ""Gettysburg"" boasted a parity of Union and Confederate sentiment.  ""Gods and Generals"" pretends no such balance.  One profound pontification by Daniels as Chamberlain explains the contradictions of the slaveholding South, but this tonic only goes so far when a divisive, albeit fascinating new subplot with John Wilkes Booth seems almost to imply doubt about Booth's ultimate characterization as a villain.  The problem with the film is not the fact that it includes these Lost Cause views (a couple of the views perhaps hold water) - the problem is simply the fact that these Lost Cause views veritably permeate the film.  We should be happy, then, that the director's cut includes more Union scenes at all, which it does.

Whatever the thematic flaws inherent in the film, it took bravery to make ""Gods and Generals""; the filmmakers attempt to interpret what it felt like to be a Southerner during the Civil War.  If the American public were not so historically illiterate, then Maxwell's film could be viewed more for what it is - a piece of art - and less for what it is not - a historical documentary.  As it is, however, the filmmaker bears much the same burden as an actual historian.  The pervasive Lost Cause themes in the movie represent only one side of history, and the other side does seem under-represented.  Having said that, ""Gods and Generals"" still deals with several topics quite maturely.  Indeed, looking back with modern eyes, we can see the flaws of the slaveholding Confederacy's experiment.  What Maxwell does is to attempt to transport us back to when Appomattox was still far in the future, to when slavery could so saturate a way of life that some slaves and masters, ironically, did not give way to overt animosities.  All that said, this is a film that requires an investment of time, patience, and attention to appreciate.  With the director's cut, ""Gods and Generals"" is more worthwhile and thought-provoking than ever.

Bottom line: If you enjoy an old-fashioned epic (albeit with some outdated views of the Civil War), intense battle scenes, a stunning musical score, and first-rate acting from the under-appreciated Stephen Lang,  ""Gods and Generals - Extended Director's Cut"" definitely deserves a place in your film library.  It will certainly get you thinking about a most important topic in American history.",1307404800,4,5670,5.06243272335845

Painfully slow, and drawn out with incredibly dull directing through all the non-action scenes, which are about 90% of the film. I was skipping through a lot of it to get to the battles after a while. Since some of the actors are very talented, I have to assume it was the the script and directing that made this so painful to watch. Although some of the acting by actors/actresses I wasn't familiar with seemed to be at a high-school drama class level. The only decent portrayal was Robert Duvall as General Lee.

1886881,4,B00009OOFB,"I would not say I disliked the theatrical version of GG.The film seemed,uneven,cut up,interiors were too perfect and clean,too freshly painted,more like the inside of non-existent sit-com houses,the exteriors were too neatly trimmed,to be set in a time without lawn mowers or bush-hogs,some sets were too back-lotish looking,computer imagery of battlefields and towns seen at a distance lacked detail and realism. The film had lots of ground to cover,in order to get us settled,and ready for the Ron Maxwell attempt to give us the Civil War in three parts. The extended version of GG does just that,yes it is long,280 minutes,because it has to be. The added scenes and re-editing makes for a better,more informing,more instructional film,that will lead us into the rest of the trilogy.
Liked:
1)The shere evergy and scope of the film is awesome(The confederate sneak attack at Chancellorsville)
2)We meet J.W. Booth--This is really good stuff because Maxwell underplays one of the most identifiable villians in American history. Maxwell reimagines Booth as a somewhat efeminant,insignificant character,who,at this point,doesn't have a story or a purpose,because we already know him and his oncoming crime against the country. Chris Conner does a really good job as Booth. Maxwell does not let the Booth character radiate evil,as you would expect,Booth does not seem special from a legendary standpoint. His good looks draws women,groupie like. He is considered a good actor from a great family of actors. Maxwell uses Booth as a backdrop to the giant story at hand. He is ominous because we know we have not seen the last of him.
3)The way the film is divided into 5 parts,gives you a sense of where you are in the grand scheme of things to come.
4)The preaching is held to a minimum
5)The beautiful little added  scene,which introduces us to a new,historical,essetial character,
 Jackson's horse  ""Little Sorrell""
6)In the extended version I sensed an integrity,a diligence to detail,which lends itself to the intensity of watching the film.
7)GG Ext. Version is a great,long,flawed movie,throw out the theatrical version,This is about as good as GG can be....
8)It is too bad the 3rd part of the trilogy was scrapped. I have a feeling Maxwell was in the process of bringing all the loose ends together so as to make his epic trilogy as one,as he maintains the end of the civil war was symbolized not by a surrender at Appomattox but by the Union bullet that struck J.W. Booth in the throat killing him,as he hid in a barn in Virginia. It was the largest manhunt in US history. It is too bad for us that Maxwell could not fimish his cinematic vision of the Civil War. The concluding movie would have probably made us aware of the greatness of the whole project relative to the first and second parts,and the unmade third part.",1306886400,7,2827,4.959915611814346

-- Dialogue from extended director's cut of ""Gods and Generals.""

Beyond the tableaus of warfare, the non-compliant anecdotes on slavery, the depictions of the home front, and the clever subplots about future presidential assassins, at its core ""Gods and Generals"" is a twofold character study, intensely specific in its focus. The studied men in question, Thomas Jonathan Jackson (Stephen Lang) and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels), were both officers, academicians, religious zealots, in their thirties, devoted to their wives, were never known to have met face to face, and were willing to go to war and kill one another for their opposing views of patriotism, freedom, and divine will. Seeing the movie again, I was reminded of how superbly nuanced the performances are by Lang and Daniels. Taken together, they comprise the key to understanding this sprawling masterwork.

On the subject of the extended Blu-ray, I'm happy to report that it sounds terrific. Visually it is very pleasing, though some of the restored footage does not match the quality of the other scenes. Occasionally it shows a slightly reddish tint and softness that may indicate the wear n' tear those particular scenes were subject to. Also, it must be said that the CGI remains absolutely atrocious. The ""plate"" shots during the battle of Antietam are far worse than the much-maligned Fredericksburg scenes. I rather wish Maxwell had eschewed these establishing overviews and left us with the characters looking off-screen. Leave it to our imaginations and call it avant-garde rather than mar your film with Windows 95 graphics.

Fortunately, what matters most is that the new footage significantly redresses the irritating ellipses in the 2003 theatrical cut.
First, a note of caution to fans of the book: this very much remains Ron Maxwell's - not Jeff Shaara's - ""Gods and Generals."" In other words, those who were aghast at the loose adaptation of Shaara's novel in the shorter version may not extract much redeeming value from its expansion. For my own money, the filmmaker's divergences are not without merit.
The dialogue is not stilted or preachy. It is written and performed so as to give a feel for the psychological, as well as spiritual, world these people might have inhabited. It is not the type of realism we get from our usual diet of history via Hollywood, but there is a kind of subtle theatricality here that is no less dramatically valid. It is also better understood in the restored context of our ""Greek chorus,"" John Wilkes Booth (Chris Conner, brilliant), as he performs Shakespeare at key intervals. The historical/literary parallels Maxwell mines from these scenes are rich and numerous.

Yes, Virginia, the lion's share remains with Jackson and the Confederacy, but Chamberlain and the Union no longer seem as if they'd been dragged, kicking and screaming, into the middle of their counterpart's biography. Chamberlain's perspective is reintegrated enough so that Maxwell finally brings into sharp relief the ethical paradoxes that were always germane to his two films.
An hour of footage is finessed back into an already lengthy running time, yet the rhythm and pacing are so much improved that the experience feels shorter. People and plot strands are properly introduced, narrative/symbolic patterns fully emerge, and the aforementioned moral/political dynamics are enhanced. These adjustments bolster the storytelling and generate a steady forward momentum that vanquishes the stifling effect of the theatrical release. By comparison, that edition has been shown up all the more for what it was: a potentially great work, whittled into a lopsided journey through disconnected vignettes. Now at 280 minutes the potential is realized. Even with the neat and handy tactic of dividing it into five easily digestible segments, the venture maintains a dreamlike progression through its two-year span. We journey from Manassas to Chancellorsville, always aware of our current place in the story while not fully comprehending what comes before and after. I believe this was always part of the filmmakers' aesthetic intent, but this is the first time that it really works.

Despite some glaring technical flaws, ""Gods and Generals"" and ""Gettysburg"" have been two of the most influential films in my life for inspiring a love of history as well as drama. For newcomers, please keep in mind that these movies spotlight small portions of a vast canvas that is the American Civil War. It follows a handful of real people and examines their exploits in microcosm, without editorializing. A reasonable case can be made that Maxwell strives so hard not to demonize any of his characters that he pushes the tone too far towards sentimentality. Even if this were the case, it would be sentiment born out of a refreshingly humanistic - as opposed to tiresomely cynical - consideration of the subject matter. And yet, the less savory aspects of Thomas Jackson's personality are not lost on the filmmakers.
Quibbles may be had with the styling of the score, the performances, the structure, or the cinematography, but the effort which imbues all of these, in trying to evoke a time and place, is never less than admirable. The fashionable argument that Maxwell and Ted Turner have done nothing more than to perpetuate a southern hagiography is ridiculous. At best, such arguments are disingenuous.

This is not a thoughtless Hollywood concoction. It is not tainted by the hermetically sealed mythology of ""Gone with the Wind,"" nor the glossy, apolitical antics of ""Cold Mountain."" It does not portend our own generation's definition of some Greater Truth. It considers nothing more or less than the thoughts and feelings of certain individuals (primarily Virginians) who endured a period of terrible strife. We must always draw our own conclusions and these films allow for that, but is it not truth enough that people such as those portrayed here - North and South, black and white, men and women - were among thousands who lived, loved, suffered, and died for as many reasons, all of which could have meant more to them than mere words and abstractions easily espoused by us today? Or should all historical fiction be propelled only by the conventions of vengeance, deceit, romance, and easily classifiable human vagaries?
It is wrong to expect all dramatic works of a historical bent to preach anything as morally narcissistic as one great, reductive truth; that would regard one group as morally bankrupt and evil while brandishing another group as a totem with which the audience is encouraged to vicariously identify itself, to reinforce unearned feelings of moral superiority. Alas, that is the conditioning we've been subjected to by decades of popular entertainment.
What any historical film should strive for is the illumination of its subject to whatever extent possible and, above all else, to be great entertainment. It is this last quality of ""Gods and Generals"" that is most easily debated, and I can only speak for myself when I say I find it immensely entertaining. Especially the director's cut.
Our understanding of any historical epoch must not hinge upon one film, but be augmented by additional reading and viewing. Within the scope of these two mammoth works, Ron Maxwell has shown us tangible glimpses of a bygone generation. He leaves it to the rest of us to fill in the gaps, with that same voracious appetite for the pursuit of knowledge and understanding as must have gone into researching and making these movies.*

These new Blu-ray books are (very obviously) highly recommended.

* FYI, Maxwell and Warner: the extended cut contains an egregious error. One of the captions during the Antietam sequence identifies the date of that battle as September 19th instead of the 17th. You might consider addressing this embarrassment upon future video releases. Cheers.",1306540800,20,8127,5.1314199395770395
1886884,1,B00009OOFB,"These reviews are all about the first version of the movie.  The newly released directors cut is an abomination and a total destruction of the film.  It has been entirely re-edited and tells a different story which will be repugnant to all Southerners. The role of Stonewall Jackson has been much diminished and the role of Joshua Chamberlain, much enhanced compared to the original.  Plus a new series of scenes with John Wilkes Booth has been added that have absolutely nothing to do with the story. Don't buy it if you are from the South as it continues the Yankee's Great Myth and the Great Lie about the War for Southern Independence.

1886885,5,B00009OOFB,"The theatrical release of the film was just one giant mess of a film. Great acting, sets, cinematography, and of course historically accurate, but still a mess. A search on rottentomatoes.com shows the film to have about an 8% rating which makes someone wonder 'did Uwe Boll direct this?' Plenty of people will hate it because the only slaves depicted in it are the exceptionally well-treated ones. Even watching it again, some of those scenes do still bother me as well, but a new viewer needs to take in account this film about the civil war is NOT focused on the issue of slavery. Of course, the theatrical version isn't focused on anything at all and the was the biggest problem with it.

I initially saw it when it first came out on DVD and expected 'Gettysburg' and what I found instead was a horrendously uneven and unfocused plot. Every scene was either dragged out too long, or rushed, and the transitioning always felt random.  With this new extended cut, the movie gains an extra hour. That's right, a near four hour movie is now a near five hour movie. Now I'm a sucker for extended cuts even when the original was mediocre at best. My personal favorites are Dances with Wolves (another hour of greatness), and Kingdom of Heaven (fixes EVERYTHING, except the mis-casted Orlando Bloom). An example of a terrible one is Alexander: Final Cut (Jesus would have trouble raising THAT from the dead).

Gods and Generals is now officially the one movie that benefits more than any other film by having an extended cut. With the added hour and re-edit of the entire movie beginning to end, the pacing of the whole film is restored. Viewers ignorant of the civil war will understand whats going on much better. The characters gain more depth with the added scenes on and off the battlefield. There's a subplot about John Wilkes Booth that adds thematically to the film in a way that's subtle and yet profound, especially towards the end (no, JWB is not portrayed as a 'hero').

In short, a well-intentioned yet disastrous film becomes (I am NOT joking) a cinematic masterpiece. If you at least appreciated what the Theatrical release was trying to accomplish you'll enjoy this new extended cut. You may not be ecstatic about it as I am, but you'll at least agree that it's a solid improvement.

1886907,4,B00009OOFB,"Even though I love the Civil War I waited a full six and a half years before catching the prequel, 2003's ""Gods and Generals."" Why? Because 1993's ""Gettysburg"" was so unimpressive. While ""Gettysburg"" has some worthwhile scenes it was merely okay on a whole, and sometimes downright tedious. How the filmmakers made the Civil War's biggest battle boring (generally speaking) is beyond me.

Gods and Generals"" is the prequel detailing the battles of First Bull Run, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, which are largely viewed through the lens of Stonewall Jackson (Stephan Lang) on the Confederate side and the Chamberlain brothers (Jeff Daniels and C. Thomas Howell) of Maine on the Union side. Also on hand is, of course, Robert E. Lee, played by Robert Duvall, who does a more engaging portrayal than Martin Sheen in ""Gettysburg."" The film starts off slow and builds momentum. By contrast, ""Gettysburg"" started off slower and never became engaging with the exception of Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge. Where ""Gods and Generals"" really pulled me in was the battle scenes of Fredericksburg and the aftermath. It showed how Civil War troops were required to march, shoot & reload in formation while rifles and cannons are blasting their way. The Chamberlain brothers had to sleep on the battlefield that night. Imagine sleeping amongst all those dead bodies and dying, moaning soldiers! This was very well done.

There are quite a few other great scenes, like the Yankee and Reb soldiers meeting in the middle of the river to exchange coffee for tobacco; the execution of three deserters; and the ""perfect battle"" for the Confederates at Chancellorsville where General Lee, with a much smaller force, takes the risk of dividing his army and executing a surprise attack. Unfortunately for the Confederates they won at a huge cost as General Jackson loses his ""right arm"" to friendly fire.

The story ends on a slow, melancholy note.

I was impressed with the battle in the town scene. The town looked so authentic. Watching the documentary afterward I learned how they accomplished this: they filmed it at Harpers Ferry, WV.

Some have complained that the Southern viewpoint is shown in a more positive light than the Northern, but I disagree. While it seems more time is spent with Jackson & Lee's story considerable time is certainly given to the North as well; the film does an excellent job of taking the middle road between the two positions.

The film was shot on location in Virginia, Maryland and Harpers Ferry, WV and runs 3 hours and 39 minutes. The Director's Cut (which I haven't seen) runs a full hour longer and features the bloody battle of Antietam and a subplot with John Wilkes Booth.

FINAL WORD: If you thought ""Gettysburg"" was boring don't let that prevent you from checking out ""Gods and Generals."" Yes, you have to be ready for a long movie and it does have some slow, dramatic parts but it builds momentum and it's one of best Civil War films in helping the viewer visualize the battles and many other aspects.

WARNING: Believe it or not, the film shows overt depictions of Bible reading, citation and prayer!! It also dares to show Christianity and marriage in a positive light!! Oh my God!!!

These two films are for intellectuals, who are not intoxicated with the ""junk"" that has invaded theaters and homes for too many decades. These two films seek to depict truthfully HOW IT WAS, presents YOU ARE THERE. It does not seek to glorify gore with sensationalism. They capture the ""spirit"" of the day, and that collides with today's American cultural values, regardless of how deceived movie goers choose to be. Whether North or South of the Mason-Dixon ( and critics may not even know what that means)  G & G shows how a split in the union was a great fear for many Southerners. Yet, when ""invaded"" by an aggressive army to subjugate them, even those in the Old Dominion had had enough, and Virginians joined their fellow secessionists.
  Most critics seem to be hung up on the slavery issue, and not appreciating the Confederacy had their own people of character. On the other hand the Union armies that brought their ""Jubilee"" South were certainly not righteous. They had their demons too. It amazes me that critics will denegrate the truth of history and then shout in praise of things like Avatar,  things of demonic-like nature.
  As a reenactor I was often asked by the public if I would have liked to lived during the war. Absolutely not. It had interesting personalities, events and issues to study, and try to understand. Gods & Generals , even Gettysburg, are serious attempts to do just that, in an entertaining way. For those who have criticized Dir. Maxwell and cast I am convinced they have attention deficit disorder, and have questionable values, of what they would look to with ""intellectual"" interest  and ""spiritual"" empathy for a generation of Americans who weathered the fires of civil war. These two films help to educate us, help us to understand  where the nation was 1861-1865 , how it struggled, how it became what it has been. My only regret is that the final film of a hoped -for trilogy,  LAST FULL MEASURE, was never done and probably will never be, knowing the cultural / economic climate of the day. What a shame there are so many shallow people! That there are those in Holywood so opposed to Ted Turner. In my estimation there should be waves of praise and gratitude shown him for funding these two films, seeing that American history is unique and is worthy of the efforts of Turner, Maxwell, Musical Scores of  John Frizell and Randy Edelman. Because this type of cinema offering is rare or not at all, it makes Gods & Generals and Gettysburg such precious creations!  Mr. J.

1886946,4,B00009OOFB,"The south was severly outnumbered and outsupplied in during the civil war, yet they made a severe fight of it during the first two years of the war. Many critics say the film only depicts union losses, but there were many union losses the movie didn't hit on also, such as 2nd Bull Run and Jacksons valley campaign - which was a stunning victory for the south as Jackson was able to drive his opponent back to Washington although he was greatly outnumbered - thus forcing McClellan to pull back from his peninsula effort to protect Washington. Superior tactics, deception, leadership, and sheer will saved the day for the south during the first couple years of the war - not to mention the obvious ineptness of the northern leadership.
Lincoln went through four generals during this period - four! Burnsides refusal to flank the rebs and instead meet them head-on at Fredericksburg (and slowly - after they were fully entrenched above Mayres heights) was blunderous. Outnumbered 2-1, the rebs slaughtered wave after wave of union soldiers.
And at Chancellorsville, Hooker had his army prepared and had a good plan to outflank Lee and destroy it. He simply lost his nerve. Again, Lees superior tactics and troop positioning forced Hookers defeated forces north of the Rappohannick. This is another battle where Lee won the battle, but lost the war. The northern losses could, and were, soon replaced. There were no replacements to replace southern losses. This is what finally did Lee in.
No matter the southern cause, Lee and Jackson were protecting their home from invasion. They were severly outnumbered and had no choice but to take the war north and threaten Washington. Lee and Jackson were two of the most tactical leaders to ever fight a war (imho) and this movie - despite its flaws - depicted this well. Superior numbers should had brought a northern victory within the first year. I mean - c'mon - nine months to seize Petersburg towards the end of the war? Hugely superior numbers finally did Lee in - the only thing that could.",1280275200,,2039,4.828571428571428

1886948,4,B00009OOFB,"And yet, it's a brilliant reconstruction of the early years of the Civil War and centers most of its attention on the remarkable characterization of Stonewall Jackson (Stephen Lang). Lang's performance as Jackson is the highlight and strength of all the non-combative scenes--a truly masterful job of bringing the man to life. One of the most vivid and colorful performances I've seen in a long while.

In ""Gettysburg"" it was Jeff Daniels who was most impressive, but here it's definitely Stephen Lang who almost single-handedly carries the last portion of the film where he is wounded and gradually succumbs to pneumonia.

The recreation of the battles is again stunningly photographed and choreographed, from Bull Run to Fredericksburg to Chancelorsville and there is plenty of heartbreak and dispair as the cruel war inflicts men on both sides of battle. But the film's strength comes in the quieter moments, such as the stunning Christmas sequence in a Virginia home where Jackson is befriended by a pretty little child who has made an ornament for the Christmas tree. This sequence, and others like it, are interior scenes that dominate the second half of the story, adding much human interest and warmth to the proceedings.

Well worth watching for anyone who is a student of the Civil War, although there is much unsaid about the glorious ""cause"" that the South fought for. Definitely not as much philosophizing is present here (as it was in ""Gettysburg""), but the quiet intensity of the homefront scenes will capture anyone's interest throughout.",1278979200,,1554,5.110236220472441
1886959,1,B00009OOFB,"""Gods and Generals"" could be the reason why there has not been a major Civil War movie released to a wide audience (with the exception of ""Cold Mountain"") since 2003. ""Gettysburg"", while not the strongest film ever produced, is a profound work of art compared to this movie, which attempts to sweep but only slightly brushes an epic story. Stephen Lang, perhaps one of the greatest, if not underappreciated, actors of the past 20 years does a wonderful job in his take on Stonewall Jackson. His performance is worth watching the movie at least once, but you probably won't come back for seconds. Maxwell's film spends so much time developing and following Jackson that other characters come off weak; their performances shallow and lacking depth, as if each actor is struggling to find something to work with. Weak writing, and weak perfomances tend to lessen the work of Lang, who is sucked into a vacuum here. Sadly, his performance will probably be forgotten in the long run as a result. Film making is hard, and Maxwell certainly tries to carry off what is obviously a passion project, but a film strictly on Jackson, or perhaps one that does not try to cover so much ground, might have been a better endeavor.",1275523200,5,1214,4.758293838862559

I am a military historian and, while not a Civil War ""buff,"" have a strong interest in the topic. But I was sadly disappointed. General Lee is a bit part. There is too much on Jackson, and too much of what there is focuses on his eccentricities (about which, I suppose, a whole film could be made). And why Fredericksburg, for heaven's sakes? A painfully dull battle that could have only one outcome, given Burnside's idiotic plan. Why not Antietam? This poor movie--it could have been so wonderful (as Gettysburg is).

For those who want to see the Confederate Army as it really was at the beginning, in victory and full glory, this is the movie to see.

Ronald Maxwell again directs, this time from the book by Jeff Shaara.  Jeff is the son of Michael Shaara, who wrote ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Killer-Angels/dp/034540727X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Killer Angels</a>"", the Pulitzer-Prize winning book that served as the source for ""Gettysburg"".

Many familiar faces appear again in roles from the earlier film.  Jeff Daniels and C. Thomas Howell and Kevin Conway again appear as Joshua and Thomas Chamberlain and the fictional Buster Kilrain.  Daniels and Conway again team to produce a few of the best scenes of this film, both of them articulating in a way most characters are not allowed. There are significant cast changes.  Martin Sheen was heavily involved in ""The West Wing"" and was unable to reprise General Robert E. Lee.  Lee is portrayed this time by Sheen's colleague from ""Apocalypse Now"", Robert Duvall.  Normally I would think that casting of Duvall would be an upgrade from almost any other available actor, but comparing the two versions of the legendary Commander of the Army of Virginia, I found Sheen's depiction elegant and serenely regal, with a temper that can be unleashed (as when Sheen's Lee tears into J.E.B. Stuart for not keeping his cavalry close as Gettysburg unfolds) and a human compassion perhaps best exemplified when the ragged rebel troops retreat from Pickett's disastrous charge and Lee rides out to tell the troops ""it was my fault.""  Duvall's Lee is quirkier and seems oddly detached in comparison.

Tom Berenger is no longer on hand to portray General Longstreet.  Early in ""Gettysburg"" you can sense the dutiful resignation as he unsuccessfully tries to persuade Robert E. Lee to force the Union Army into pursuit by moving toward Washington, then later you can feel his heartsickness as he knows Pickett's Charge is bound to fail and wordlessly waives his troops forward to the suicidal advance.  Bruce Boxleitner's Longstreet is decidedly less three-dimensional.

The excellent Stephen Lang again is cast, but instead of playing the flamboyant Pickett, this time he has a leading role as General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson.

The film is huge in scope, covering two years from the secession of Virginia (which is preceded by the offer to Robert E. Lee to command the Federal Army) to Chancellorsville.  As a historically accurate document it is selective:  the single bloodiest battle of American history, Antietam, is not mentioned (although there are reports that it was cut from a six hour version of the movie.  Curious that the full ""director's cut"" doesn't make it to the DVD - the audience that would sit through 4 hours of re-enactment would likely want the chance to have the ""most accurate"" version of the film.) But I digress.

Where Gettysburg focused on the soldiers, ""G&G"" gives us a handful of stilted subplots.  We see the wives of Chamberlain and Jackson in scenes designed to show the tender, human sides of these men, but their dialogue doesn't ring true on modern ears.  Since these scenes aren't based on historical record couldn't Maxwell and Shaara have given us more human dialogue instead of having these great men offering scripture and poetry quotations?

Amid the noble and heroic whites on both sides are two significant black characters - Frankie Faison plays Jim Lewis, a free black man with a reputation as a good cook who is hired by Stonewall Jackson.  Donzaleigh Abernathy, the daughter of Civil Rights Activist Ralph Abernathy, plays Martha, a noble and loyal slave who stays at the manse in Fredericksburg to shoo away invading Union Troops when the rest of the family skedaddles.  Later the house is occupied anyway and Martha nurses injured union soldiers and gives an impassioned plea for freedom to General Hancock. General Jackson is kind and respectful toward Mr. Lewis, and tells him that he's certain the south would also free the slaves, so it's going to happen on way or `tuther. Although Jackson and Robert E. Lee were reported to be against slavery, it would not be difficult to say that having these two characters be the only blacks in a movie of this scope and scale trivializes the fact that millions of blacks were enslaved, scant few were free, and hardly any were treated with the respect these characters receive.  It's almost as if Maxwell wants to portray something 180 degrees from ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"", but if you didn't already know about slavery you wouldn't learn much from this film.  I think the filmmakers wanted a movie that would stand almost as a historical document, but whether or not you agree that the Civil War was about slavery, you'd be nave to not acknowledge that it was on the minds of all participants to some extent or `tuther.

For those who might wonder: I'm a white Son of the Glorious South.  There are wonderful things in this film, but there are significant gaps as well.",1265500800,,5179,5.22463768115942

1886966,5,B00009OOFB,"Divers of other reviews lament the double-sided DVD, but I'm a veteran of handling these enough that it isn't a gripe with me at all.

However, it is a minor gripe that the conclusion of one side pulls you out of the movie. With the Gods & Generals release, you're pulled out during the charge of the Irish Brigade, and the movie is cut kind of funny, so you aren't inserted right back when you flip to side B. This is a shame, because this is walking into the part of the movie where Joshua Chamberlain's role really shines.

Mary Fahl's 'Going Home' theme at the beginning should win over viewers right away. From there, through the fine instrumental scoring throughout, and even to Bob Dylan's melancholy whaling at the credits, this is a greatly scored film, scoring that could hold it's own with anything.

The central character is General Jackson. At times, it will seem more like a Jackson biopic than a movie where the Civil War is the subject. This make Stephen Lang unquestionably the star of the film. Contemporary audiences will definitely flinch at times at what may seem an absurdly melodramatic portrayal, but I can't honestly say there's any other way one could really inhabit the role of General Jackson. I certainly don't question his casting.

And I also don't question the casting of Robert Duvall as General Lee. He may be the only living actor with the gravitas for it, and he marked a vast improvement over Martin Sheen. Now, Sheen was fine in that TV series as President Bartlet, but there's the gravitas for playing presidents, and then there's a level for Robert E Lee. Duvall had the quality to inhabit the role. It was perhaps the strongest supporting role ever, with the possible exception of Gerald McRaney as Patton in the much overlooked 'Ike'.

I have a lot of enthusiasm for what I saw in this picture, but will admit going in not looking for a movie. I went in with the eye of an editor, and must agree with all the other reviews concerning pacing and whatnot. The craftsmanship is perfect, but this is a miniseries shoehorned into a movie. You'll love it if you make those allowances, and you too will find yourself daydreaming of cutting this into the perfect miniseries.",1260316800,,2208,4.651282051282052
1886967,1,B00009OOFB,"The best thing about this film is the song during the opening credits sung by the great Mary Fahl. After that it's a fast downhill slide. I'm amazed at the amount of four and five stars that reviewers here have awarded this mess of a movie and can only guest that they are coming from that strange breed of person known as the ""Civil War Re-enactor"". Bad acting, bad beards(like it's sequel Gettysburg), bad computer generated images and above all fake battles using overweight civil war re-enactors. Director Ron Maxwell directs this film like he was back in the 1950's with 50's sensibilities. Any war movie, this one in particular, that ignores the groundbreaking vision that Steven Speilberg gave us in 1998 with his magnificent ""Saving Private Ryan"" deserves the failure this film had at the box office. What an opportunity Maxwell had. First of all he ignored two of the most fundamental rules of the post ""Ryan"" battle scene, no soundtrack music during a battle unless it is provided by the fife and drum corps existing in the scene and plenty of handheld camera work. Maxwell uses romantic battle hymns during the big battles and there are plenty of smooth slick tracking and crane shots during his essentially bloodless events. Nowhere do we see the visions of hell that I have read about by survivors of these hideous conflicts where modern industrial weaponry met napoleonic battle tactics.
Some fine actors were wasted in this film most notably Jeff Daniels and Robert Duvall as an incredibly pale Robert E. Lee. These men were sunburnt and weathered, they spent all of their time outdoors on horses. Steven Lang plays a romantic version of ""Stonewall"" Jackson, a departure from the tactical killing machine who was Lee's right arm. Oh I could go on and on. A really great film about our nations most horrendous folly has still never been made. Until that happens I would suggest instead of ""Gods and Generals"" either Ken Burn's monumental series ""The Civil War"" or the small independent film ""Pharoahs Army"" with Patricia Clarkson and the great Chris Cooper.",1259884800,,2071,4.886363636363637

1886993,4,B00009OOFB,"This is probably one of the most difficult and involved assessments of any product I've reviewed here at Amazon.com.  Rather than critiquing the movie from either the controversial politically-correct or conservative viewpoints, I will try to point out some things about why I feel the movie failed to succeed at the box office (or on DVD) vs. the actual Jeff Shaara novel, which I have read, and I feel is more successful.

We must remember from the outset that the Jeff Shaara novel was likewise written in the same vein as father Michael Shaara's ""The Killer Angels"".  Both essentially are narratives and character studies of the participants' thoughts, responses, and reactions to historical events that they were jointly a part of.

First, the movie does not faithfully follow the Jeff Shaara novel as did father Michael Shaara's novel, ""The Killer Angels"" in the movie, ""Gettysburg.""  While the vast majority of events presented in the movie are historically accurate, the movie emphasizes the Civil War service of Confederate General Thomas J. ""Stonewall"" Jackson, whereas Jeff Shaara's novel gives equal character treatment to Jackson, Confederate General Robert E. Lee, Union Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, and Union Major General Winfield Scott Hancock.  While the first three are dealt with rather well in the film, worst of all, the movie pushes Hancock into the background as a minor character vs. his being a significant contributor to the action as was in the novel.  Much of Hancock's involvement in the novel as a battlefield general is given in the 1862 Peninsula Campaign of General George McClellan (omitted from the movie) and at the Battle of Antietam (also omitted), of which other reviewers lamented its movie exclusion.

Second, there is the timing of appearance of Shaara's novel on the market and that of the mammoth, authoritative Jackson biography by Dr. James I. Robertson, Jr. of Virginia Tech, who is featured in the extra features on the DVD.  Shaara's novel appeared in 1996 and Robertson's Jackson biography appeared in 1997.  When the time came to make the movie version of the novel, the attendant excitement of the discovery of a tremendous amount of information about Jackson's life from Robertson's biography in the intervening years probably somewhat affected the decision to make the switch in emphasis for a movie version to make Jackson the main character.  In addition to the appearance of the Robertson biography, there had to have been the intervention of Executive Producer Ted Turner to make this so.  What puzzles me is why novelist Jeff Shaara allowed this to happen, even though he seems enthusiastic in the DVD extra features about it happening as it did.

Third, while admirers of Jackson were pleased to see Jackson the Confederate become the main character in the film, this obviously would not set well with a movie-going public, the vast majority of which would know little about Civil War history and also which the majority would prefer to see themes in films dealt with in a politically-correct manner.  While Civil War enthusiasts can carp all they want for the politically-correct element's failure to study their Civil War history before delivering judgment on a part of the war's history that is not to their liking, that realistically is something that would and will not happen.

Fourth, with the switch in character emphasis to Confederate Jackson as opposed to an evenly-distributed one amongst four characters, significant screenplay modifications needed to be made.  The first major change in the movie from the novel action deals with the First Battle of Bull Run, or Manassas, which is dealt with only in passing in the novel.  Jackson is the only character amongst the four major players in the novel involved at Bull Run.  Obviously, if Jackson has now become the major character in the film, a significant departure from the novel needed to be made to depict how Jackson got the name of ""Stonewall"" at Bull Run.  This departure from the novel is dealt with rather expertly and is historically accurate, even if not to the liking of the politically-correct.

Fifth and last, I don't know how or why two folk/rock singers (Mary Fahl and Bob Dylan) were allowed to contribute two songs to the beginning and ending of the movie that seemingly were opposed in approach and tone to each other.  Of the two, I feel that Bob Dylan's contribution was the least meaningful, and didn't contribute to the tone of the sad moment at the film's end that viewers had just experienced with the death of Jackson.  If anything, I would liked to have had a reprise of the Fahl song, which seemed better to fit the sobering ending.  Rather, I could have done without either singer's input, and relied on the contributions of film composers John Frizzell and Randy Edelman.  The input of Mary Fahl and Bob Dylan was likely Ted Turner's decision to attempt to generate a wider appeal for his film.

In summary, if the film had been more faithful to the novel, I think it would have had a better chance of succeeding as ""Gettysburg"" had.  Still, as other reviewers have stated, there simply was too much history to cover in what had already become an extremely long film (three hours and thirty-nine minutes), with no intermission.  ""Gettysburg"" covered only four days, whereas ""Gods and Generals"" covered two years.  ""Gettysburg"" was originally conceived and filmed as a TV mini-series, and with proper editing, succeeded as a long movie (four hours and fifteen minutes) with intermission.  ""Gods and Generals"" should not have been conceived as a movie and would have been more successful as a mini-series, following the novel more faithfully than it did.  But as it is, it was good in accurately depicting the historical events of the time period it covered.

The unfortunate lack of success that ""Gods and Generals"" suffered was a financial setback for Ted Turner, which resulted in his decision not to fund filming of the last part of the Shaara trilogy, ""The Last Full Measure.""

1886995,1,B00009OOFB,"For some reason, Amazon has listed this film on my profile page as belonging on my wish list.

Unfortunately, my only wish is that I had not wasted any time being disappointed by what is supposed to be historically accurate. I guess this film proves that historical accuracy is not enough for make a compelling film. Yes, it does have the presence of Robert Duvall, one of my favorite American actors who is so compelling and believable in BROKEN TRAIL.

Fortunately, we do have such well-made films about the US Civil War as GLORY, MAJOR DUNDEE, and, as a weak third, COLD MOUNTAIN. Even more fortunate is the fact that we have such superb films about our great country's history in THE NEW WORLD and REVOLUTION. Both of those latter films have been made even better by their release in revised or extended versions. Of course, we also have the literary classic brought with rousing excitement to the screen by Michael Mann in his version of THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS.

All of those above-mentioned films were blessed with having talented directors and equally talented cast members.

Except for the appearance of Robert Duvall, GODS AND GENERALS has neither. I am mildly curious about the third film in this series THE LAST FULL MEASURE, but if it is as plodding and as poorly acted as the first two produced by fellow Georgian Ted Turner, than I will forgo that curiosity and leave it unsatisfied. I have seen high school plays with better acting. All of the major characters are constantly being touted by other characters in the film as being flawless and so superhuman that one wonders if these people were thought of as being real people with real human flaws or as merely types -- cardboard at that.

Bring back directors of the talent of Sam Peckinpah. We have seen what he did with such films as MAJOR DUNDEE, particularly as released now in its extended version. Only those who missed the point of Terrance Malick in his poetic vision of the founding of Jamestown in 1607 called THE NEW WORLD and thought it to be boring would have the proper perspective to appreciate GODS AND GENERALS.

In the meantime, Amazon, please remove this film from my wish list.",1252195200,,2166,4.686842105263158
1886996,3,B00009OOFB,"As I say in the title, I saw ""Gettysburg"" first, and seeing that ""Gods and Generals"" was made by the same people with many of the same actors, I was looking forward to seeing the second film. I was quite disappointed, it is no where near as good.  The main problem is that the film is basically unfocussed, except in attempting to show that Stonewall Jackson was a ""great"" man and that everyone involved in the war, particularly the Confederates, were ""noble fighters"".
I was quite surprised to see the film showing slaves who were quite devoted to their masters, not because that there wasn't such a phenomenon (the movie ""Gone With The Wind"" which came out in the ""pre-Civil Rights Movement"" year of 1939 shows that as well), but with the current suffocating climate of ""political correctness"" it is surprising to me that we would see a modern film depicting such attitudes.  The ""correct"" thing to do would be to show Southerners as monsters supporting the inhuman institution of slavery and everyone who is associated with its cause would be required to be portrayed as evil, at least to some extent. I guess I should give credit to the producers of this film for not falling into this trap and giving the audience a feel for the nuances of the period, which are not really understood today. Similarly we see Stonewall Jackson expressing his hope that slavery would soon be abolished (other Confederate Generals such as Longstreet and Lee were also in favor of abolishing it).

Stephen Lang's portrayal of Jackson is good and, having seen ""Gettysburg"" I realize he is quite a versatile actor. In ""Gettysburg"" he played the ebullient George Pickett, whereas here he portrays a very different type of man-the super-intense, fanatical, almost crazed Jackson, and we see this in his eyes.  Too bad they didn't include a quote of his which I got from Shelby Foote in the TV documentary ""The Civil War"" in which Jackson asked about where a certain suborinate was. He was told that he was killed. Jackson replied ""very commendable!"". Very strange how such a ""pious"" man was so indifferent to the endless slaughter that was going on around him.  In ""Gettysburg"" we do see Longstreet and Lee being affected by it. It is for this reason I refuse to see Jackson as some sort of great, noble man as many do, but rather as someone who needed psychiatric treatment.
On the other hand, I missed Tom Berenger as Longstreet and Martin Sheen as Lee. Although Longstreet is a minor figure in this film, Berenger's replacement is flat and unremarkable. I am aware the Robert Duvall is a fine actor (he once played Josef Stalin in an outstanding performance), but here he is also bland and I didn't get the feel of Lee's personality as I did from Martin Sheen.  I felt the scene at the beginning where Lee is offered command of the Union armies did not really bring out the tormenting dilemma that Lee faced in making the decision to support succession.

When I say the film is ""unfocussed"" I mean that it drags on and on in places and the historical context of the scenes is missing. I could not believe that they showed the battle of Bull Run without showing the bravado of the Union commanders and leaders in thinking that they could have an easy march to Richmond which would then bring a nice, clean, early end to the war. No mention whatsoever of any of this.  Similarly, no mention of Antietam and its effect of bringing Lincoln to making the Emancipation Proclamation.  These are crucial events in understanding the progress of the war. Such context was given in ""Gettysburg"" when it is explained at the beginning of the film the reason for Lee's invasion of the North and during the film Lee's strategy is described within the context of his earlier battles.
Yes, the scenes of the battles at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville are very good....they are, in my opinion, the main justification for recommending the film in spite of its drawbacks. The clash between the two Irish units is especially moving.
Thus, people interested in the Civil War in a general sense may enjoy the film in spite of its boring segments, but someone with more than a casual interest in it may find the whole thing a waste of time.  Too bad, because it seems that the problems with this film doomed the attempt to make the third film in the projected series which would take us to the end of the war.",1250553600,,4372,4.673602080624187
1886997,5,B00009OOFB,Great service. Recived order in a timely manner. I would shop here again. Great job.,1249516800,,84,4.666666666666667
1886998,1,B00009OOFB,"To review a movie about a war and its generals, it is important to understand what war is.  War is passionate, horrific, miserable, frightening and heartbreaking, amongst many other things, to a human being.  There is never a dull moment and there are always central figures in a war movie to tie all these emotions together.

""Gods and Generals"" is a movie that should be filed under the category of a well budgeted documentary from the looks of the props and settings and its cast.  There are a few pleasant surprises in the movie such as the execution of army deserters, General Jackson's injury, and the passion in his last words.

In the execution of army deserters, the scene starts with a jolly pipe tune completely out of place which thankfully stops as soon as the order is given to proceed with the sentence.  The fear in the deserters was well portrayed with a close up of one of the deserters as he was being blindfolded.  The somber horn sounds creeping in carried the grave mood as the firing squad completed its task.

General Jackson's injury was a great scene because the setting of friendly fire was well captured; in darkness, riders and their horses going in circles because they were unsure of where the shots were coming from.  As the General fell, his aides rushed to him and struggled to whisk him away to safety to the sounds of gunfire and ominous dark music.  It lent to creating the fear and bravery of soldiers under fire.

The last words of General Jackson were captured with a good close up of his face, portraying the intensity of his passion for his troops and the war.  Unfortunately, the camera did not zoom away above him as he passed on to create a climatic effect.  Instead the camera turned to his widow and showed her slump over him with great restraint before zooming away; terribly uncharacteristic of a woman who was supposedly deeply in love with her husband.

There was an abundance of missed opportunities to make this film very different in its delivery, possibly better.  The remarkable event of two soldiers from opposing sides coming together in peace to exchange a smoke and coffee was not exploited to create contrast.  Instead the scene stood alone without showing them ever meeting in battle.  There was also a lack of focus on facial expressions of the two soldiers which would have spoken volumes about humanity and the fleeting hope of friendship.

Another wasted moment in the film was the scene where a confederate soldier was telling another about his feeling of impending death on the battlefield and returning the gold coin to his father.  There was a lack of close ups and emphasis on human frailty.  Instead the camera chose to keep a distance from the soldiers and rolled along to a Disney classic Lassie-like soundtrack.

The sneak attack on the Union camp started off steadily with the confederate soldiers charging stealthily through the woods.  This was well supported with exciting music that kept the pace and energy up.  The missing ingredient that would have propelled this charge forward, was close ups on the soldiers that would show the adrenaline of charging into battle.  The slight repetition of this charge by soldiers following behind became a deceleration of the excitement of the whole invasion.  The human element in a war is an essential one that cannot be ignored if a war movie is to be made.  Close-ups of the human actor can engage the audience to make them feel what it was like being there at the fore front of a war.

In trying to paint the vulnerable side of General Jackson, the film hurries through his friendship with the child, plying scenes of the General tying a ribbon around her head, carrying her on his shoulders horsing around, sharing a lemonade moment, and visiting her when she was sick.  There is a considerable lack of depth in those scenes because the camera seems to be shy about getting close up in their faces to spend time studying their emotions.

There are many scenes in the movie that continually challenge the audience to stay awake during playback.  The war scenes were too statistical in nature because of the safe camera angles.  Soldiers charging and falling simply became images instead of real people getting hurt, scenes of soldiers reloading their weapons became a manufacturing process, and chaotic retreats became footage of a rowdy football crowd dispersing.  Even scenes in the army hospitals were devoid of tension and worry as sounds of the moaning injured were painfully absent.  Movie making discretion went AWOL when a casual tone of voice was used to narrate the story of David and Goliath during troop deployments prior to battle.  The poor choice of soundtracks caused the movie to stumble into disinterest in the opening scene of war because they used a Disney like movie theme music.

Overall, the film is plagued with a lack of engagement with the audience and it relies on covering a lot of ground resulting in superficial characters and dialogue.  Had the film direction of ""Gods and Generals"" been different, this film could have risen from the proverbial graveyard play-list of die-hard history buffs and school assignments.",1249430400,4,5170,4.821995464852607

1887010,3,B00009OOFB,"Gods and Generals is the prequel movie to Gettysburg, but was filmed nearly ten years later. Many of the actors reprised their roles, but are obviously much older (and stouter) than in the first film.  Stephen Lang plays Stonewall Jackson in G&G (he played Pickett in Gettysburg) so it seems odd to have the same actor play two different roles in both films, especially when viewed back to back. This movie is even more beautiful than the first movie, and the opening song by Mary Fahl is a work of art.

The movie covers the civil war from the beginning to just before the battle of Gettysburg, and shows the story from both sides, as did Gettysburg. However, unlike the novel from which it is taken, the filmmaker threw all objectivity to the winds and slants the whole story in favor of the south, even going so far as to add dialog to the movie blaming the whole Civil War on the north. I found this revisionist view of history and lack of objectivity annoying and disturbing. However, if you are able to ignore this few bits, the movie is both beautiful and the story touching.

Like ""Gettysburg"", the movie interweaves story lines telling the story of Northern and Southern soldiers, focusing mostly, on the northern side, on Colonel Chamberlain, the hero of Little Round Top, and on the Southern side, on the story of General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson, with the heavy emphasis on Jackson. General Jackson was, along with General Grant, one of the under-appreciated military geniuses of the Civil War. By the sheer force of his personality, which at some times seemed to border on insanity, drove his troops to perform miracles on the march and in the battlefield. Stephen Lang gives the character of Jackson life and believability that is often lacking from written accounts of his life.

Unlike ""Gettysburg"", there is no extended edition of this movie, which is a pity because the previews and trailers of the movie show scenes, including one showing President Lincoln disembarking from a train at a rustic depot, that aren't included in the movie. Perhaps an extended edition of the film would have restored the missing balance of this movie.

Because the movie tries to cover three years in less than three hours, it is unable to do justice to the original novel, as ""Gettysburg"" did. The production values are actually higher in this second movie. Sadly, due to the ten year delay between ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals"", and due to poor promotion and marketing, and also due to the pro-Southern bias of this film, this movie did not fare so well at the box office and plans to film the third book in the trilogy were dropped. It's sad to think that we may never see a movie version of ""The Last Full Measure"" but, given the director's decision to blame the whole Civil War on the North, perhaps that isn't altogether a bad thing.",1246752000,,2847,4.720321931589537
1887011,2,B00009OOFB,"Although the photography in this movie is breathtaking, I can't recommend it. It seems to me as if Ted Turner is trying to rewrite the history of the Civil War, only this time the South wins. Purportedly, this is the prequel to ""Gettysburg,"" but a major battle is missing -- Antietam. The only major battle in the East which the North won before Gettysburg, yet it is completely omitted from the movie. How can this movie be historically accurate when a major battle is omitted?",1246579200,,478,4.635294117647059
1887012,2,B00009OOFB,"I loved ""Gettysburg"", and I had high hopes for this movie, but I'm afraid I was disappointed.

This doesn't mean there isn't merit here.  ""Gods and Generals"" is very faithful to the book on which it is based (probably over-faithful in fact.  They are, after all, very different media).  It is beautifully filmed, it is painstakingly historically accurate.  The acting is superlative, especially Stephen Lang as ""Stonewall"" Jackson.  It is well produced, and well directed.  There are some very touching moments - especially during the battle of Fredericksburg, when opposing Irish regiments clash, and the famous display of the Northern lights after nightfall.

One thing I particularly like about it, and also about ""Gettysburg"", is that there is no conventional ""good guys vs bad guys"".  Fundamentally, ""Gettysburg"" is a pro-Union movie, while ""Gods and Generals"" is more sympathetic to the South, but in both movies at least the other side is given the courtesy of explaining their side of the argument, and to point out the reasons why they are fighting this bloody war.  This enables you to see that neither side has a monopoly on virtue or vice, and that helps to show them as real characters.

The problem with ""Gods and Generals"" is that it is too ambitious.  While ""Gettysburg"" shows what everyone was doing in an intense period of three days, this movie covers the activities of several major characters over two whole years.  With a book that is a difficult act.  In a film, even a long one like this, that inevitably means that events are going to be skipped over, and the result is a huge sprawling mess of a movie.  The individual scenes are excellent, but they just don't connect to each other with any kind of coherence.  If you are a Civil War ""buff"" the omissions will irritate you.  The general viewer is just going to get lost.  Really, it would have been better to have expanded this and made it into a 26 part series.  Instead, the makers were just unable to decide which of the very interesting characters they had would be the focus of the film, so they tried to show all of them, and the net result is that the film has no focus at all.

1887014,5,B00009OOFB,"It is my attempt here to clear up the confusion that this film created. I think many out there need to take some blinders off and look at this movie for what it is trying to portray: a victorious south. Prior to Gettysburg, the Confederates had won many battles and had proven their resolve well against the better funded North. In addition to this, they were lead by a brillant military general: Thomas Jackson. Stonewall represented not only the strength of the Southern cause but also the tactical ability for strategy that Lee always lacked. With Jackson, Lee knew he had the upper hand on the Federal Army. However, there were also brillant minds in Union colors who understood and caught on to Jackson's ways. This explains his death.

To me the focal point of this film is to demonstrate how determined the south was to continue to fight and also portray the specific way in which their cause was justified. The director showed many simply defending their homes. That was something never done on film before, and for that we should all give Maxwell the credit he deserves. If this film does anything, it convinced me that the Civil War was the most difficult experience Americans ever faced.",1244505600,2,1198,4.732057416267943

I've also done reenacting for decades as a hobby.  Having said all that, this movie is okay, but it attempts to do too much in too little time - and it suffers from that.

Gettysburg was a superb movie and gave that epic event in our history the time it deserves.  Gods and Generals attempts to cram two years of war into the same time it took to give a decent impression of just one battle.  This is more of an attempted biography of Stonewall Jackson than anything else, and it loses its focus on that attempting to jump around from subject to subject.  There are numerous historical errors, particularly in regards to Robert E. Lee's early days as a Confederate commander.

Robert Duvall in particular struck me for his excellent portrayal of Robert E. Lee, as did Jeff Daniels as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain; the other actors were quite good too. As some other reviewers have mentioned, Stephen Lang is superb as well. The talent of these three actors really comes out here.

I loved the script as well. I think they did a good job being fair to both sides and the motivations of all the characters, staying relatively true to the book (although some stuff had to be cut of course), and being historically accurate.

In spite of being a very long movie, the film never drags. In response to those that think that this movie is ""too long,"" I seriously wonder about the American attention span these days. In an era of sound bites, it's refreshing to see a movie that takes time to actually tell a story. No, this isn't an action flick, and criticizing it for not being one is like criticizing a horse for not flying.

This movie is not the least bit boring; rather, it does a great job making history come alive.

What's very impressive about this movie was (1) not overdone violence; (2) beautiful cinematography; (3) an unusual and refreshing reverence for God, the Bible and Christian thought and (4) a better portrayal by Robert Duvall of Robert E. Lee than Martin Sheen's version in ""Gettsyburg.""

On the point 3, all it was - to those atheists/agnostics who were offended by Jackson's reverence - was showing an accurate portrayal of how people thought and believed back then in the south. That's simply the way it was and the way people viewed everyday life, though Biblical standards and language. So kudos, to the filmmakers here for at least giving us an accurate description of the times, even though they probably don't share those beliefs. Of course, the critics - almost all of them secular - hated the film.

One thing I did miss from ""Gettysburg"" was a bigger role from Jeff Daniels, who was so good as ""Col. Chamberlain."" His role here in that capacity is limited.

It was dull, over-acted, and the screenplay was horrible -- filled with flowery speaches, no real character development, no real-life conversations.  I can understand why all these ""South will rise again"" folks like it -- it's pro-confederacy, hardly mentions the word ""slavery"", and makes it look like all the southern slaves just loved their ""masters"".

1887058,5,B00009OOFB,"It may be that some reviewers who complain about the length are just too 'antzy' to sit through this 'prequal' movie. I found it a fascinating portrait of General 'Stonewall' Jackson during the early years of the civil war, and to some lesser extent his relationship with General Lee. This movie was not intended to be a 'fair and balanced' depiction of the years 1861-1863 for both North and South; it is about stunning victories of the South due in no small part to the generalship of General Thomas Jackson. Although there is some view from the Northern perspective in the battles depicted, it is really a movie about Jackson and how pivital he was to the early Confederate victories.

Joshua Chamberlain and the 20th Maine Regiment is given some lengthy treatment at the Battle of Fedricksburg in great part due to the pivotal role the 20th Maine would play later in the eventual defeat of Lee at Gettysburg and is featured in this movie's sequal ""Gettysburg"". It was a good attempt at continuity between the two movies.

The 'commentary' on both ""G and G"" discs is also excellent and very informative with a good discussion of the events surrounding Stonewall Jackson's accidental shooting by his own men during the Battle of Chancellorsville. It is interesting to speculate about the outcome of the war had Jackson survived. Lee was a stratigic genius and Jackson was his tactical genius. When informed of Jacksons injuries, Lee reportedly said ""General Jackson has lost his left arm, I have lost my right arm."" There was no one to step up and fill the tactial void left by Jackson's death.",1219622400,6,1596,4.8

1887061,4,B00009OOFB,"This ""prequel"" to Gettysburg is a truly fine film, but I do state this with some viewer-oriented reservations.  In terms of historical accuracy, overall cinematography, most of the casting, and battlefield realism, it is indeed a fine film.  However, while some of the ""reservations"" are of a strictly ""personal preference"" nature, others are not.  Considering the history of the Civil War, General Stonewall Jackson definitely deserved deep coverage, especially in view of the impact of his absence at Gettysburg, which may have turned out differently had he been there.

I was relieved that Jeff Daniels repeated his role as Col. Chamberlain, as this is a key character in the overall tale, as were other actors who appeared as members of his command retained.  But despite the fact that they played their roles very well, I do not believe Robert Duvall and Stephen Lang should have appeared as Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, respectively.  Perhaps they had other commitments when the film was scheduled.  I would much preferred to have seen Martin Sheen back in the role of R. E. Lee, and any one of several actors in Jackson's role.  Lang portayed a memorable General Pickett in Gettysburg, and it rendered his role as Jackson ""uncomfortable"" for me, having loved Gettysburg.

Perhaps the film's most obvious drawback was its sheer length.  I am not sure what I would have edited out of the story, but more than likely it would have been some of the very lengthy dialogues.  The human interest side of the story is very important, of course, but something had to go.

All-in-all, I did enjoy the story greatly, and I will get around to watching it once more, when I have the time set aside.  Again, the quality of the film is truly great, and well worth watching and owning.

Many sequels suffer from repeating and rehashing the majority of the material from the original. Some suffer from not being enough like the original. Some are lucky and...

Sometimes movies are bad because they are simply moving at a slow pace with little to no interest or substance. Sometimes sequels just have too much to live up to.

This is an example of just about every bad quality I've mentioned. It doesn't outright stink and suck, nor does it leave you cross-eyed with perplexion or indifference, either. But it doesn't really inspire any particular feelings for you at all, really. Positive or negative.

""Gods and Generals"" is a movie that might be perfect for recovering war veterans in trauma wards. A movie that moves on a quiet, comatose pace. ""Gods and Generals,"" a prequel to the famed and magnificent ""Gettysburg"" has little or no energy. Everyone just appears to be back to set things up for ""Gettysburg.""

This whole movie is a 2 1/2 hour set-up for a punch line we've already seen---with nothing happening or really going on here.

Oh, I'm not saying it's horribly made. It's put together with skill---the whole look and sound of the civil war. It might be the kind of movie that would be shown in a history class.

It's complete with big-name actors like Jeff Daniels and Robert Duvall in full civil war garb and giving famous and poetic quotes as if they're striking a pose. They appear to be posing throughout the entire movie. It's a civil war re-enactment.

But they're just goofin' like any other group of men doing a civil war re-enactment.

There is one real battle sequence where everybody lines up and charges to die and to kill. The body count begins to pile up---like ANY war movie worth it's salt should.... but it doesn't capture the true stink and ugliness of war in a ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Braveheart"" sort of way, or even the original ""Gettysburg.""

Perhaps because all those were R-rated movies and this movie doesn't want to lose it's PG-13 movie, it's more about poetic stories and makes the civil war a backdrop for all this.

At least in my opinion, the actual problem with the fact this movie runs at the pace of a comatose snail. Still waters run deep? Not here.

The movie moves so slowly at times that these people seem to have started the civil war simply out of sheer boredom and so they could say thing that would become historic. This is part I to a III-part series (""Gettysburg"" was part II). I look foreword to the next in the series.

""Gods and Generals"" all felt like set-up where ""Gettysburg"" delivered the actual punch-line. I hope the final in the series (these are all adapted from books) doesn't just tie up loose ends.

Let's all hope, shall we?

On the film scale--every scale--""GODS AND GENERALS"" rates as two stars out of four, 3.5 out of 10, a dozing viewer in his seat (that's the rating system from the Chicago Examiner""). Eh...

SPECIAL NOTE HERE: Matt Letscher, a really good actor (""Gettysburg,"" TV's ""Good Morning, Miami"" and ""The Mask of Zorro"") at least is given more to do than his nameless and bit character in the original movie--but it's still just not a good movie, I'm afraid.

While the movie may try to convey the opposing mindsets of the northern abolitionists, and the souther slave-holders, the dialog through which they present their opinions is hard to watch without feeling insulted.

The only saving grace in the movie (as far as I care to recall) is Robert Duvall's adept and nuanced portrayal of General Robert E. Lee.",1207785600,4,432,4.904109589041096
1887065,5,B00009OOFB,"A splendid adaptation of the Shaara novel of the same name, many reviewers seem to feel that this is (or should be) a history of the first part of the American Civil War.  However, that is just not the case, nor the intent of this film.  What the film IS about are the career and personal natures of a very few seminal characters, and in particular, General 'Stonewall' Jackson.  As such, lengthy treatment of the 'causes' of the Civil War, who was right and who was wrong are not particularly appropriate, nor is such discussed.  Instead, we are treated to the 'causes' that brought Jackson HIMSELF to the war, as well as Robert E. Lee, and Chamberlain too.  That is the point; to bring the focus not to huge overarching national and regional issues, but to the reasons and causes why INDIVIDUALS fight, and will go to a great war of unknown length and violence inconceivable, even though they know they themselves are unlikely to survive.  Yet these causes are considered by the INDIVIDUALS concerned to be SO important, SO fundamental to their own perception of what is, and is not tolerable that the time comes where they have to make a very personal and terrible choice, and live (or die) by the outcome of that choice.

Anyone who has ever gone to war will recognise that mental wrestling match that all who take that unalterable step must engage in.  What makes the scenario of the American Civil War so poignant is that virtually everyone involved understands and KNOWS that he will not just be going off to fight some vaguely perceived and relatively undefined 'enemy,' but that they will be fighting and killing their OWN friends, neighbors, and even family members in defense of that which is perceived to be absolute.  The choice therefore, is even more terrible, as are the consequences.

This is why there are some long soliloquys in the film, as both the author, and film maker work to get the audience to UNDERSTAND and appreciate the depth and breadth of the sacrifice contemplated, and acted upon.  Further, it should be remembered that the people of that time actually spoke and thought in the manner presented (not just an 'author's conceit'), as is recorded in the many journal entries and letters from the time (these were NOT 21st century men and women, but a product of their times, and thought and spoke accordingly).

In sum, if you are simply looking for a Civil War 'action movie' with lots of explosions and little plot, then you might not like this (though there are indeed plenty of explosions, and the most splendidly filmed battle sequences ever done).  You might not like it if you are looking solely for a history of the Civil War either (PBS did an excellent documentary on the Civil War, if it's strict history you are looking for, that's your source!).  But if you are looking for a film of breadth and scope on a personal level, comparable to the incomparable film 'Glory,' then you will agree that 'Gods and Generals' is an excellent choice.",1202947200,4,2981,4.696737044145873

1887067,2,B00009OOFB,"After I viewed Gods and Generals I really pondered what the problem was with this film.  I thoroughly enjoyed Director Ron Maxwell's film of the novel The Killer Angels more popularly known as Gettysburg.  (This despite Martin Sheen's Cornpawn depiction of Robert E. Lee.)  In this outing for Turner Pictures director Maxwell tried too hard to hold true to the novel of the same name. And this is the problem.  The film is almost 4 hours long and filled with long winded romantic speeches by southerners about ""The South.""  And the ""Shirley Templesq"" scenes between Stonewall Jackson and the small child, well...one almost expected for that kid to break out singing ""On the good ship Merrimac.""  Corny.  The Director tried to give the novel its due but only ended up with a too long movie that had dialogue that just droned on.  I mean if these historical figures, Jackson, Lee, Chamberlin et al really gave these long winded speeches the common soldier of the day would have fallen asleep in the middle of a charge.  To be fair Robert Duval gave a fine performance as Robert E. Lee.  I have read a few biographies about Stonewall Jackson and the film did capture his personality.  He was deeply religious, devoted to family, and a military genius.  Finally, on the DVD you get some great extra features most notably to music videos, one by Bob Dylan, and another by Mary Fahl.  There is supposedly one more film to this trilogy and I hope Director Ron Maxwell learned his lesson from this 2nd in the set.",1201219200,7,1505,4.67680608365019

At 30 minutes in, one buddy hit stop, and the two of us left and went home to finish the movie, thinking our first friend was being too picky and not giving it enough of a chance to get going. Well, it never got going. The movie is basically a construction of average to occasionally better than average civil war skirmish scenes, that then break to 15-20 minute speeches by main characters. Yes, you heard that right, 15-20 minutes long, with one character in a head shot, delivering what I'm sure are historically accurate soliloquies. I hit fast forward a good 5-6 times through these endless black holes. This is fine for a PhD thesis, but for a movie? No way. Very amateurish mistake.

I appreciated the story being told from the southern perspective, even not having an ounce of personal connection to the South, but this movie did not do justice to the drama of the South as shown in Ken Burns and other documentaries. Ted Turner directed it, I believe, and it shows it. The dynamic between Jeff Daniels and his brother turned enemy keeps the movie from being an utter joke, but he almost looks weighed down by the lumbering clod that is this script - if the bullets don't get him, this movie will.

Robert Duvall and Jeff Daniels have their moments, but these are few and far between. Stonewall Jackson is flattened into a couple of shticks, which is really too bad because the book by Jeff Shaara was the only thing I've seen or read that gives him dimension and humanity.

Don't bother with this movie. Instead, see 'Gettysburg' again and hope they do a much better job on 'The Last Full Measure' - if they ever make a movie of it, unlikely considering how 'Gods and Generals' flopped.

In some ways it's almost the most expensive home movie ever shot, with Ted Turner paying for this account of the early years of the American Civil War out of his own pocket. For the first hour it's almost as if the Union never existed, the film shown entirely from the Southern side, and with a very partisan view at that (all down to Yankee aggression, with Fort Sumpter conveniently dismissed in a single line). Too often lengthy quotations take the place of dialogue and even the better actors in the cast often seem ill at ease while the surprisingly weak daylight photography and poor CGi matte painting in early scenes giving it an air of storybook unreality. Indeed, Ronald Maxwell's approach at times seems pure D.W. Griffith, with a fondness for awkward tableaux and unconvincing sentiment (poor Mira Sorvino gets a couple of particularly painfully hearts-and-flowers scenes to deliver as a consolation prize for missing out on playing Joan of Arc when Maxwell's version was dropped in the wake of Luc Besson's film). There are a few moments here and there - an intimate scene between Stonewall Jackson and his wife confiding his doubts, a scene between Jeff Daniels and Kevin Conway's sergeant about friends on the other side - but as the over-ambitious film tries to cram too much history into its four hour running time (and still scenes filmed dealing with Lincoln, John Wilkes Booth and the Battle of Antietem didn't make the cut) the people just get lost.

Thankfully, the second half rallies considerably as the film reaches the Battle of Fredericksburg and the 20th Maine's disastrous charge, and the contradictions in Stephen Lang's ""Stonewall"" Jackson, a deeply religious man yet one who advocated taking no prisoners, become more interesting despite the film's determination to turn him into across between Jesus Christ and a vengeful Old Testament prophet. Yet sadly the lasting impression is of a film that is too sprawling and unfocussed for its own good and one that not only either needed to be a lot longer or a lot shorter but also much better written. As for the somewhat nonsensical title, it's an abbreviation of the novel's Faith in Gods and Generals. Incidentally, be warned that the DVD has one of the worst side breaks ever.

1887074,5,B00009OOFB,"WOW. Until Gods and Generals I despaired to believe that anyone anywhere could somehow make a decent Civil War movie.  The Vietnam War had its Platoon. The American Revolution had its Patriot (although it was no Brave Heart) and World War II had its Saving Private Ryan.
Yes, we've seen films such as Glory. Glory--great action scenes to be sure and Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington were amazing. Yet, it was one sided.
Who walked out of the theater after viewing Glory knew that two years before the black 54th Mass regiment was mustered in the north, there were free black volunteer units serving for the South, one including the 1st LA? (Not to mention the 90,000 other free African Americans who served and died in the Southern armies.
Glory was like...making a movie about the horrors of Nazi Germany without including the holocaust or a movie about the old west without including Native Americans. You shouldn't make a movie based on historical events if you plan to hack a truth in half. The 54th Mass had its 15 moments of fame...when will the 90,000 black soldiers of the South get theirs?
Blue & Gray and even Gettysburg was more fiction than historical.  In the movie Gettysburg there is a scene of a runaway slave being liberated in the 20th Maine's camp. It never happened.  However there are both testimonies and written accounts of free black Confederate soldiers in Gettysburg, one of which Lt. Colonel Fremantle (who was portrayed in the movie) had written about in his book after the Civil War.
Then came Gods and Generals. Based on the reviews I've seen, most people think the truth sucks. Stonewall Jackson, the great SOUTHERN general recruits and befriends a black citizen named Jim Lewis.  Throughout the movie the Southern characters proclaim their cause is not slavery but independence. How many of you cringed when Lee's character quoted to Blair's character his understanding of the Northern cause stating, ""I never thought I would see the day when the goverment would raise an army to invade its own country."" Boy, this pissed off some PC pukes and some other views naive to true history.
It may piss them off even more to know that Jim Lewis was a real Confederate soldier. Or...that nearly every account written by a Confederate soldier on why he enlisted was to defend that state and secure its independence, just as the movie told. Who would question that the armies from the Northern states invaded the Southern states. Battle of Manassas,VIRGINIA. HELLO. Many of you may have had ancestors who had been POWs in Japan or Vietnam or Germany. Three of my ancestors were POWS in... Chicago, ILLINOIS.
Furthermore, every major speech in the movie spoken by Jackson's character was historically to the T.
My advice to the critics who shammed this movie--shut up. Gods and Generals was the most unique experience in your movie-viewing lives because you actually learned something.
Truth aside, I loved it! Where Gettysburg and Glory used women less than even as extras but more as props, Gods and Generals provided the screen with beautiful and talented women in leading and dramatic roles.
Where in the series', Blue & Gray or North & South the battle scenes looked as deadly and real as local cable wrestling, Gods and Generals provided us with three of the Civil War's most explosive battles that included thousands of actual CW reenactor extras, sound effects, and visual effects. I was blown away.
Lastly, where other CW movies centered on childhood history book poster boys, Gods and Generals blessed us with not only the most well known heroes of that time but also their deep, dark, and dramatic personal stories and emotions. Also featured were the unsung heroes. Again, remember Jim Lewis.
Even the sound track blew me away. The music lifts a spiritualness in your deepest core.
Gods and Generals is a lovely movie. Because of the movie's amazing historical backgrounds, battle scenes, and larger than life (but very alive) characters, I recommend it to everyone.

While the movie does have it's own value entertainment, it does not follow the book very well at all.  The movie does not develop the characters at all, especially the relationships between the various Generals for both sides.  The book particularly hit on the close relationship between Hancock and Armistead that was never even mentioned in this movie. I actually ran into Jeff Shaara in Gettysburg a few years ago and expressed my disappoint in the movie and he expressed his disappoint in how the movie was portrayed also.  It would be nice if they finished the series and did a screenplay of ""The last full measure"" but it would need to be a mini-series or at least 3 hours long.",1178409600,6,763,4.588235294117647

1887087,5,B00009OOFB,"About twenty-five years ago, when I was in the Canadian Armed Forces Reserve, ""Soldier of Fortune"" used to get passed around. As I watched this film I couldn't help but remember a t-shirt that was always for sale within the magazine's pages: ""GOD GUNS & GUTS MADE AMERICA GREAT."" That seems to be the message of this historical epic, except that, here, the message is that they made the Confederacy great too.

The film starts out with Robert Duvall, as Robert E. Lee, expressing his sympathy for the Southern cause to a Federal official offering him a high position in the Union Army. The film portrays the Confederates as being moved not as much by support for slavery, but against what they see as an armed invasion of their lands by their own countrymen. We also get to hear the Northerners side of it, and neither side is demonized in this film.

It's not about good guys and bad guys: The film tries to show that both sides had moral reasons for going to war; that men on both sides were brave and honorable; and that Christianity and God loomed large in the hearts of Confederates and Unionists alike. For example, when asked why he is so fearless, ""Stonewall"" Jackson replies: ""My religious beliefs teach me to feel as safe in battle as in bed. God has fixed the time of my death. I do not concern myself with that but to be always ready whenever it should overtake me.""

The film ultimately tilts to the Southern side, only because it focuses more on Confederate General ""Stonewall"" Jackson than anyone else.  The film takes us from the dawn of the War right up to General Jackson's death by friendly fire at Chancellorsville.

It is a long film - very long - and those with short attention spans may not be able to last to the end. But it is to the Civil War what Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of Christ"" was to the last day of Christ's life on earth: A Masterpiece.",1177891200,8,1872,4.461988304093567
1887088,3,B00009OOFB,"It seems that most reviews of G&G are either five stars or one star -- people either love it or hate it.  I'm somewhere in between.  As a reenactor who participated in the filming, I was counting the days until it was released in theaters.  I must confess that I was disappointed by the finished product (the best thing about it was seeing myself on screen a few times!).

First, the GOOD:

The film's greatest strength is its excellent portrait of people of faith.  Christians are usually portrayed in the media as either uptight hypocrites, ignorant redneck simpletons, or demented serial killers.  It's refreshing to see a movie that honors faith and shows the Bible and prayer in a positive light.

Stephen Lang does an excellent job portraying Jackson, perfectly capturing both the fiery warrior and the pious, loving husband and father.  By the way, in person he's a heck of a nice guy.  I also think that Duvall makes a better Lee than did Martin Sheen, although he doesn't get much screen time.

The battle scenes are generally good (except for the CGI), and the music is effective.  Some would say the score is maudlin, but I thought the emotion was appropriate, and I liked the full orchestra better than the more synthesized ""Gettysburg"" soundtrack.  G'burg's main theme is more memorable, though.

The DVD also features some nice extras, more than the typical movie.

Now for the BAD:

As other reviewers have pointed out, the dialogue sounded stiff and wooden.  Ron Maxwell did take much of it from letters of the period, but that's the problem.  Writing (and even speaking to some degree) in the Victorian period tended to be flowery and overly sentimental, something that Michael Shaara took into account when he wrote ""The Killer Angels"" (he mentions it in the forward).  It's no wonder that everybody in G&G seems to be giving a speech.

The book on which G&G is based is not the easiest book to turn into a film; unlike ""Gettysburg"", it covers several years instead of a single battle.  Nevertheless, the film is a poor adaptation.  The first hundred pages of the novel are completely skipped, and Maxwell devotes way too much screen time to Jackson.  Hancock is a major character in the novel, but here he's hardly more than a bit player.  His relationship with Confederate general Armistead is one of the most moving elements of Gettysburg, and Maxwell wasted a golden opportunity to expand on it.  Even General Lee gets shortchanged.

Although the film is generally accurate, it presents a skewed vision of the issues surrounding the war.  ""Gettysburg"" was more balanced, highlighting the issues that honorable men on both sides cared about.  G&G on the other hand is a valentine to the ""Lost Cause"".  For example, we see a montage of Southern men preparing to leave home and gear up for war.  We get to see their wives, children and sweethearts, but we never see anything like this for the Northern side other than Chamberlain's wife Fanny.  At the same time that the South was mobilizing, thousands of Northern men were lining up in droves to defend the Old Flag and the Constitution.  They were just as sincere and passionate about their cause, but we see none of that in this film.  Slavery is glossed over completely, and even made to look downright pleasant.

The one problem that dwarfs all the others is pacing.  Anyone who has watched TV or movies much has a sense of the timing or rhythm of a scene, but whoever edited this film had no ""feel"" whatsoever.  In G&G, some scenes open and nothing happens for a full minute of screen time.  The camera pans around the room as the characters sit placidly sewing or sipping punch.  The whole film practically screams ""EDIT ME!""  I don't mind a slower paced movie (""Unbreakable"", for example), but G&G absolutely crawls.

Dyed-in-the-wool Civil War buffs like me can enjoy the film to some degree, but I'm afraid everyone else will find it a tedious bore.  For sentimental reasons, I give ""Gods & Generals"" a generous three stars.",1174608000,8,4003,4.7601744186046515
1887089,1,B00009OOFB,"We felt the book was pretentious - no real depth to the story. A weakness as some characters were not as prominent in the same time period.

1887090,2,B00009OOFB,"Some 10 years after a good effort with Gettysburg, director R. Maxwell tries to comply with Ted Turner's wishes to make an 'anti-war' war movie.  Instead he made an 'anti-viewer' movie.  Lang's talent is wasted trying to cope with the stilted dialog of a 19th Century version of a Shakespearian drama.  While generally true that both the North & the South thought they had God on their side, I suspect that there was quite a lot more on their minds during the day than discussing Old Testament passages and looking up into the night sky to discern the mind of God.  And what was the special effects cloud routine near the end of the battle of Fredericksburg all about?  Even a good cast couldn't defeat the writers and director in this tedious film.",1172275200,8,749,4.601503759398496
1887091,5,B00009OOFB,"There are many reviewers who say Gods and Generals is a terrible movie, but I find these reviews appalling.  This movie does explore the Civil War from a southern perspective, which is one reason I believe this movie is thrashed by critics.  Today, while I watched a few scenes from the movie, I reflected on the great Stonewall Jackson.  All men are flawed and he is no exception, but I truly believe he is an excellent example for modern Christians to follow.  He truly trusted the Lord in all things and believed in providence, which people often question in this modern age.

Steven Lang did a wonderful job of bringing life into Thomas Jackson.  I loved watching Jackson's interaction with his wife and even a small child he befriends.  Personally, most movies fail to place beating hearts into characters, but Gods and Generals gives life to the generals, soldiers, and civilians of the North and South.  Although some people seem to prefer Martin Sheen over Robert Duvall, I enjoyed seeing Duvall portray the heroic Robert E. Lee.  Lee isn't the main character in this movie, but when he does appear, Duvall realistically displays Lee's Christian virtues, wisdom, and leadership.

As a history teacher, I showed this movie to my eighth grade students and many of them enjoyed it.  Any person who is trying to learn about the Civil War will gain a lot of insight from this movie.  The subject of slavery is debated from all perspectives in Gods and Generals.  Viewers will see that many slaves were respectful of their masters, but still hoped to gain their freedom.  Many southern generals and soldiers didn't own slaves, but fought for their homeland.  This historical issue will always be debated, but I think this movie fairly addresses both sides of the debate.

This DVD is dual sided and is a bargain.  It offers many bonus features that should interest students of history and the average viewer.  Both of the included music videos are enjoyable to watch and paint a vivid image of the impact death had on Americans during the Civil War.  The Stonewall Jackson mini-documentary is interesting, but parts of it seem nonprofessionally filmed.  Many of the critics of this film should praise it for bringing a tragic war in our past to life in a balanced perspective.  For too long, historians have bashed the South and uplifted the North to a fault.  Both armies had heroes and villains; both had just reasons to fight too.  Do not let all the critics of this movie hinder your choice in watching it.  Give the movie a chance.  Even if you dislike it, you will gain a better understanding of the Civil War.",1171929600,10,2618,4.751662971175167
1887092,2,B00009OOFB,"First, let me say that I was not a huge fan of the book, which read like a docu-drama.  In this regard, the film captured the essence of the book.  In all other areas, the film shared only the name in common.  Whereas ""Gettysburg"" is intensely loyal to ""The Killer Angels,"" this movie doesn't come close to capturing the book on film.  In the book, we get extensive coverage of Hancock and Chamberlain, among other Federal commanders.  Jackson is a major focus of the book, since he was a large part of the early war, but he is not THE focus.  Gods and Generals was a mediocre first attempt by Jeff Shaara, who I give a lot of credit to (the man was a stamp collector, not a writer like his father).  Gods and Generals the movie was a southern apology and a love letter to Jackson.

Second: what the hell happened to Ron Maxwell?  Gettysburg was a decent movie (remember, it was made to appear as a TV miniseries in the early 1990's, so it was not intended for a post-Private Ryan audience).  Maxwell seemed to be a capable director and adapted the book remarkably well.  Gods and Generals was, as one reviewer correctly put it, a bad high play.  There was no conversation, merely soliloquy.  There is no excuse for this movie as far as the script goes...it was horrible.  I cringe when I watch it.  I love the Civil War and the Victorian Era and this did it absolutely no justice whatsoever.

Third: The acting was just as miserable as the script.  For proof, watch the scene with the woman talking out the back of the covered wagon while evacuating Fredericksburg.  Ben Affleck has produced better work.  In addition, Stephen Lang is not a very good Jackson (he was a great Pickett, I have nothing against Lang, and I admit that the writing couldn't have been saved by anyone).  Even Jeff Daniels didn't perform to his Chamberlain-esque standards.  Perhaps the one convincing character was Robert Duvall as Lee (much better than Martin Sheen with his ""deer-in-the-headlights"" look).  But then again, he may have been the best character because he had about 3 lines (one of which Lee himself wrote at Fredericksburg).

Perhaps the saving grace is the better-than-Gettysburg battle scenes.  Again, this is probably because it was made for theaters 10 years after the original, when ratings are less strict as far as violence is concerned.

In summary, I am a huge Civil War buff.  I reenact it, studied it in school, have written about it, etc.  I would have LOVED if ""Gods and Generals"" was the greatest Civil War movie ever made.  I was hoping it would be the Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers of the Civil War.  Unfortunately, the release of Gods and Generals has probably doomed any Civil War Hollywood project for the next decade or so (if you don't believe me, they aren't making The Last Full Measure because of the absolutely horrible reaction to Gods and Generals)",1171670400,9,2879,4.6232741617357

I think this opinion the South was somehow wicked and the North was good is wrong. People need to read true sources of history and find out the truth.

I also liked the fact that it was a very Christian video.

Now I finally know the truth!  All those slave-owning Southerners were just saintly bible quoting gentlemen, and the South was populated with contented, satisfied, happy and ""employed"" slaves! Huh?  Apparently, those Black Americans (Oops. I forgot, Southerners did not consider them Americans or citizens--thank you Dred Scott decision) must have absolutely loved all the murder, beatings, whippings, and legalized rape that they were brutalized to live under.  At least that is the impression one will come away with after viewing this piece of revisionist garbage.  Thankfully there will be no final chapter to this film trilogy, since it was long ago reported that the concluding episode would be cancelled due to the miserable box office take of this dishonest and deceitful motion picture.  What more could the producers do?  Change the title from ""The Last Full Measure"" to ""Birth of a Nation Part II?""  It was already obvious that there was a pro-Confederate slant in the Gettysburg movie, but the producers were very careful in presenting it with some filter, and also allowing for some (minor) balance in the portrayal of the Union position.  In G&Gs though, that delicate balance in simply thrown out, and instead what you get is pure untruthful propaganda and a complete distortion and fabrication of the historical facts.  Finally, the movie itself does unfortunately have some positives to recommend: excellent acting from Stephen Lang, intense battle reenactments (although the CGI is horrible), and just ONE outstanding scene between Johnny Reb and Billy Yank as they exchange coffee and tobacco. Other negatives are Daniels and Duvals acting (how could such fine actors give such flat performances?), horrible make up (the beards are simply laughable), extremely distracting music that is neither compelling nor somber but instead becomes increasingly tedious, awkward and saccharine dialogue that attempts to capture the time period but instead suffers from the difficulty and inability of the actors to portray and verbalize it convincingly; instead  they come off looking very embarrassed and uncomfortable.

This movie tells the truth about that period.",1168473600,5,386,4.375
1887098,1,B00009OOFB,"I posted a review of this movie back in December 2006 that was highly favorable, 4 out of 5 stars, full of sugar plums and dandylions complaining only about the speechified dialogue and the casting decisions.

I am an adult now, and having done a lot of reading and research on the Civil War, this film is dismal.

The Civil War was fought over slavery.  Straight and simple.  Anyone who says otherwise is either misinformed, clinging to the romantic ""Lost Cause"" notion, in denial, or a straight-up liar.  The only ""State's Rights"" the South fought to defend were the State's Rights to maintain slavery.  Ironic given that the very same South raging over ""State's Rights"" proceeded to use the EVIL Federal government to enforce their Fugitive Slave act, which FORCED Northern states to help track down and return runaway slaves to their masters.  THAT IS A VIOLATION OF STATE'S RIGHTS.

But I don't fault this movie for bashing us over the head with the slavery argument, or even for avoiding it--- ""Gettysburg"" avoided it, and I still feel that was a spectacular movie despite it.

Here, though, they bash us over the head with the idea that it was NOT about slavery, with more scenes added in the Director's Cut that only FURTHER bash this idea over our heads in the most ridiculous and borderline-offensive way possible.

Going back to the original film, there are moments that make me cringe or outright roll my eyes in disgust or bemusement, such as early in the film, where a man is decrying secession, and says there is no reason to secede, and that slavery will eventually die of natural causes.  Slavery, not the 4 million slaves Southerners all owned.  Another is particularly mind-blowing in its insanity is one with Robert Duval's Lee telling a Major that Fredericksburg is meaningful to him because it's where he met his wife, and it's something ""these Yankees"" will NEVER understand.  Even now, -I- can't understand how a man like that thinks that other men would not understand the significance of a place to someone else.  It's almost as if Duval ad-libbed it and no one was brave enough to question the legendary actor on the lack of common sense of such a statement.

But the aforementioned border-line offensive new bit added in are several new scenes involving the slave man Jim and one of the other black ""free"" men working with him as cooks to the Army of Northern Virginia.  This ""free"" black man gives some convoluted story about his master buying him and freeing him once the war started, and the man apparently being so grateful, he followed his former master in to the war for service.

This absolutely STINKS of Paternalism.  Paternalism was the Southern DELUSIONAL belief that slavery was a humane system peculiar to the American South, and that Africans were so inferior as a race that they NEEDED to be enslaved in order to be RAISED like children into being at least partly civilized.  Slave-owners genuinely believed and deluded themselves that their slaves were HAPPY under them (obviously so long as their masters didn't cruelly abuse them needlessly.

This sentiment was ALMOST present in the scenes involving the slave woman Martha, but I feel it was realistically handled, particularly with Martha confessing to Union General Hancock that despite the sympathy she has for her masters, she above all wants to be free.

This sentiment is wholly absent in the aforementioned story of Jim's friend, so in love with his master he weepily brings his coffin home when he dies in combat.

And then there's John Wilkes Booth.  Holy hell.  I would've endured all the speechifying of all the little characters in this film if it meant the character John Wilkes Booth was completely out of this film altogether.  A full SIX scenes of Booth are included in the director's cut, and they're all EXACTLY the same; Booth whining and complaining about the war and childishly blaming Lincoln for it entirely.  He's obviously not portrayed as a hero OR villain, but he comes across so melodramatic and whiny and self-important and so completely useless that it's an absolute pain to endure his scenes.  They literally contribute NOTHING to the film, and the highly unsubtle foreshadowing of his assassination of Lincoln obviously amounts to nothing, since the event isn't covered in this film, but is ultimately frustrating because of how foolishly blunt it's handled.

Additional scenes PADDING out this 4 hour and 40 minute length (yes, PADDING) include training scenes of the 20th Maine regiment (which actually aren't dull but quite entertaining), scenes of Jackson picking a horse and riding his horse around the countryside, a COMPLETELY USELESS AND PAINFULLY SUGARY scene involving a Prussian colonel presenting a new uniform to Stonewall Jackson from General Stuart, and more post-Fredericksburg moping by the 20th Maine people.

The battle scenes were somewhat grand, but the scope was far too limited; you got no sense of what was really happening beyond ""people slowly trudge forward, point and shoot, people fall"".  This is especially true of the First battle of Manassas/Bull Run, the new scenes in Antietam, and everything outside of the initial charge in Chancellorsville and most of Fredericksburg battle.

Most decried for being cut out in its entirety, the Antietam battle sequences are probably the most useless in the film.  All we get are some scenes of men fighting in a corn field, and a brief shot of who I think was supposed to be General McClellan, looking far too skinny and slender to be the beefy-looking man in the photos of the real guy.

Overall, the ""6 hour"" completely new ""Gods and Generals"" people were expecting is the exact same movie, with loads more padding, and the novelty of some new scenes cut into the same film you've been watching for 8 years.",1167004800,,5809,4.906952965235174
1887099,2,B00009OOFB,"I loved Gettysburg.  For me that remains the best Civil War movie yet made.  I very much looked forward to Gods and Generals coming out in the threatre, and I dragged several friends along to see it.

I was embarassed.  First let me say, the parts with Jeff Daniels were well done - he's an excellent actor.

However, every scene with General and Mrs. Jackson made me ill.  They were poorly scripted and poorly acted.  It was like an overly melodramatic Bugs Bunny cartoon, but not funny.  The whole script seemed to focus more on melodrama than on making the characters seem real and genuine, as they were in Gettysburg

I'm wondering if the problem has to do with the book's author.  I have read historic books by Jeff Shaara, and he is not a great writer - his historical facts tend to be wrong, among other things.",1166659200,8,818,4.466216216216216
1887100,4,B00009OOFB,"... I think this is a good film in the hands of the right person but in the hands of neo-Confederate southern apologists, particularly those with an agenda to distort history, it could be a problem.

It's obvious that Ron F. Maxwell (writer, director and producer of this film) truly loves history and put a lot of thought and care into this movie. But the problem is he messed with the wrong period of history. The Civil War is the Holy Grail of American history, and the battle for its legacy is still being fought. To one side, the bottom line of the conflict was southern black slavery- to this opinion, it doesn't matter if the Confederate soldier owned no slaves, the economic system which sent him off to war was fueled by slavery. To the other side, the War Between the States- or the War of Southern Independence- or the War of Northern Aggression- was about state's rights versus the federal government in DC telling people in Georgia or Arkansas or wherever what to do. A lot can be added to the opinions on both sides in this debate, and neither side looks to back down anytime soon.

""Gods and Generals"" has been so roundly criticized for being soft on slavery and too pro-Confederate. This was supposed to be the first part of a Civil War trilogy (1. Gods and Generals 2. Gettysbug/The Killer Angels 3. The Last Full Measure) based on books of the same names by Michael and Jeff Shaara. I think the intention of Maxwell was to present both North and South with dignity and respect, to show that there were heroes on both sides. This intention is true. But this movie was a bigger bomb than the explosion of the Crater in 1864. As a result of the flop, ""Last Full Measure"" has been canceled and will probably never be made. And I must say... I don't think I've ever seen a film so hated before in my life. Some people who wrote reviews here come off like watching this film was not just a waste of their time, but their lives have actually been ruined as a result. I almost think that if Ron Maxwell goes around introducing himself as the director of ""Gods & Generals,"" somebody's going to hit him.

Personally, I can't respect the Confederacy at any time for wanting its independence while enslaving people. The deal's off at that point. But there is something fascinating about those who are willing to risk it all- their lives, for a cause, even if that cause lacks nobility. In other words, I study the Confederacy as social and military history rather than condemning all things southern.

As I said, I personally liked this film. I liked that many of these scenes were very accurate, such as John Janney's speech before the Virginia Secession Convention and Stonewall Jackson's speech to his soldiers. Lt. Col. Chamberlain's speech (this movie has a lot of speeches) to his brother before Chancellorsville is tremendously powerful. This is the first Civil War film I've ever seen that has shown black camp servants, which were used by both sides. I've seen a lot of camp photos from the war and these African-Americans are clearly visible, yet they have been omitted from so many ""accurate"" films with ""attention to detail."" I loved the film's Christian theme. And I appreciate that the movie included a lot of people- Janney, Dr. George Junkin, Francis Preston Blair, Sr., Mary Anna Jackson, Jim Lewis, Sandie Pendlton, Dr. Hunter McGuire, and Colonel Adelbert Ames- that previous films have left out. This movie gave me a lot to think about, as it was intended to do.

But like many, I do think it sugar-coated slavery and even went so far- I think unintentionally- to make the north look like the evil aggressor. One example is the comparison presented in the film of the soldiers' behavior. In one inspiring scene, General Jackson salutes his men and commends their respect for the ""rights and property"" of citizens. Then, during the battle of Fredericksburg, Yankee soldiers are seen looting and vandalizing in the streets of the small southern city. The truth is, BOTH of these events are factual. The speech was recited virtually word for word, and Union soldiers did engage in drunken vandalism. But this is only part of the war. Starving southern soldiers stole food and clothes on frequent occasions and the movie mentions nothing about the fact that General Robert E Lee, who I still believe was a Christian man, allowed soldiers in his army to kidnap free blacks in Maryland on their way to Antietam. Splicing history to this effect is like one of those crazy YOUTUBE videos where somebody takes ""Mary Poppins"" and turns it into the exorcistic, possessed ""Scary Mary."" Neo-Confederate apologists will walk away thinking theirs was the just cause. I can think of one of them. A few years ago, I visited the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park in Virginia. While touring the museum, I observed a white woman look at the exhibits and then bow down to her young daughter and remark, ""See, honey? It's too bad the south didn't win- we would have been better off!"" Furthermore, she made this comment while standing next to a black man.

If you see Gods and Generals, make sure it is not the only Civil War film you see. Please include PBS' ""The Civil War,"" ""Amistad (pre-war)"" ""Andersonville,"" ""The Day Lincoln Was Shot,"" ""Gettysburg,"" ""Glory,"" ""The Hunley,"" ""Wicked Spring"" and ""Ride With the Devil."" Even these will not tell you everything about the war. There are many great books, such as William C. Davis' ""Look Away! A History of the Confederate States of America;"" ""With My Face To the Enemy: Perspectives on the Civil War"" by Robert Cowley and others; and James McPherson's ""Battle Cry of Freedom."" These books and others will give you more education than these movies ever will.",1165190400,6,5731,4.7374749498997994
1887101,5,B00009OOFB,"Perhaps one of the best book adaptations ever done.  Mr. Maxwell's work to keep the complexity of the issues in tact in order to tell the whole story is commendable.  Mr. Shaara's novel provided a great resource and Mr. Maxwell gave the visual display its magic.  The depth of the characters could be equallied only by the real characters themselves.  Mr. Duvall gave a performance expected of his talents.  Mr. Lang provided the quintessential ""Stonewall"" in all his intense humanity and passion in faith.  For the lover of history, the detail is exceptional.  It may drag too long for those wanting pure entertainment but for those wishing to immerse themselves in the time, this is the film where you can.  Admirers of ""Stonewall"" will especially appreciate this film.  Those unfamiliar with ""Stonewall"" will see why his character looms so large in our history as the ideal example of a man.  His intensity still shines forth more than a century later.  It is a melancholy movie that helps us live the horror of those days and recognize the complexity of war where there is no one who is clearly right or wrong in the end.

In addition, the special features including the interviews and the haunting music videos are superb.  I had the opportunity to preview this movie before its initial release in theatres and I am very pleased with the result that has survived in this DVD edition.

1887102,4,B00009OOFB,"An almost endearing stiltedness undergirds this fine film's narrative, as though set pieces have been prepared in order to allow the characters to deliver solemn speeches Though this may appear artificial and even insincere to modern movie-viewers, it is a dramatic technique at least as old as Homer's ILIAD and ODYSSEY. What GODS AND GENERALS shares with those ancient poetic ballads is the celebration of the fighting man's nobility, his rage, and the juxtaposition of profoundly ordinary human sentiment alongside the most inhumane deeds one can imagine.

GODS AND GENERALS sustains a tone of deep sadness throughout, the director's way of highlighting the tragedy of a war fought among brothers. This nation's founding fathers achieved their political miracle at the cost of leaving the issue of slavery unresolved. It was bound to raise its head in a union-threatening manner eventually. The events of 1861-1865 were the bursting of a wound that had festered as long as it could.

True, Lincoln took the nation to war over the matter of the union's preservation, but it was slavery and vastly different social visions that placed the union in danger in the first place.

The film follows the trajectory of General Lee and - more prominently - Virginia's 'Stonewall' Jackson. The latter preferred that the eponym be used only of the brigade he led, not of himself.  But his grateful men would have it no other way. 'Stonewall Jackson' he would be from Manassas on, and 'Stonewall' he would die.

Robert Duvall, Stephen Lang, and Jeff Daniels do their characters proud, though it is perhaps Duvall's General Lee who most rings true to the man's decency, calm, and painful array of allegiances.

Mira Sorvino briefly lights up the screen as the Maine Lieutenant Coronel Chamberlain's wife, Mrs. Fanny Chamberlain.

'War', one of the characters is early heard to say, 'is the sum of all evils' and its reputed provocation by Mr. Lincoln 'a most dreadful mistake'.

The achievement of GODS AND GENERALS is to show that the waging of war sometimes falls to the most decent of men, who at times find fratricide thrust upon them, carrying the dreadfulness of their predicament to their graves.

This film should be seen by all who care about the formation of the American republic, a city upon a hill that has nonethess found bloody water lapping upon its gates, staining its streets, and drowning numbers of its finest.",1157846400,2,2418,4.9950248756218905
1887103,3,B00009OOFB,"To start out with, I am a history buff and have studied the Civil War more than any other period in American history.  I found some of the language in this movie to be more indicative of diary entries or writing than people actually speaking to each other.  As an example, there's a scene in the beginning of the movie where the woman who later on in the movie has to leave her Fredericksburg home is seeing her three sons off to war.  She sounds more like she's reading Oliver Wendell Holmes than she does talking to actual people.  Perhaps the producers tried too hard to emulate the language of the period.

Another qualm I have with this movie is the lack of ""continuity"" between this film and ""Gettysburg"" with respect to the actors and their roles.  Stephen Lang, who played Gen. George Pickett in ""Gettysburg"", all of a sudden is Stonewall Jackson in this movie--did I miss something?!?  Robert Duvall dons the general's overcoat in this film as Robert E. Lee even though Martin Sheen did an excellent job in that role in ""Gettysburg"".  And what's going on with Bruce Boxleitner playing James Longstreet?  Shouldn't Tom Berenger have picked up where he left off?  It seems that Hollywood still hasn't learned that when doing a prequel/sequel, for the sake of continuity you should stick with the same actors.

That said, historically this film is very accurate.  From the northern lights display at Fredericksburg to General Jackson's fondness for lemons and his death at Guinea Station, the producers did an excellent job keeping with historical fact.",1157155200,2,1559,4.819548872180451
1887104,2,B00009OOFB,"It is hard to believe that the same team that made Gettysburg made this verbose waste of time.  This movie almost guarantees that The Last Full Measure will never be filmed and that is a shame.

It was a mistake to take Stephen Lang and put him in the role of Jackson.  Jackson was considered, even by his contemporaries, a military genius but crazy by half.  The film missed the mark with their attempt to show his religious convictions and his devotion to duty.  Lang had him speaking in long winded prose that sounded like bad soap opera dialog desperately trying to be Shakespearean.  The prayer scene in the morning? PUKE!  It could have been a voice over with battles scenes or soldiers marching, or anything else rather than what became just a terrible scene.

Most of the ""women"" folk of the south were equally sappy and long winded, and I hate to say it but I was glad when the too precocious for words overacting child died of scarlet fever I was glad to be rid of her.  Her scenes should have been left on the cutting room floor.  I get it Jackson was ""such a warrior and a peaceful lover of children at the same time what a diametrically opposed individual"" give me a break, I hate being force feed like that.  A better Director could have gotten the same point across quicker and more subtly.

Then there is Chamberlain quoting Shakespeare while all around him look off to the distance with thousand yard stares.

There is supposedly 4 to 6 hours of footage lying around to this film.  I would love to see it reworked by a better director into what it should have been.  A narrative like Gettysburg that goes back and forth between a few central characters in a logical sequence without all the ham fisted attempts a proselytizing and all the noblesse oblige.

If you must see it borrow it, rent it, but don't waste money buying it unless it is in the $3 bin at the local dirtmart.

Yes, there's always going to be some interpretation done, but overall I thought the acting was well done and the information reliable.

1887107,1,B00009OOFB,"To begin with, allow me to say that I have never in the past felt inclined to review a film, whether good or bad. This is the first time that I deemed a film so poorly done as to merit a warning to potential purchasers.

I have greatly desired to like this film for some time. My background is in history and I have a fairly extensive knowledge of the subject matter. I was scared off from purchasing this film for quite some time due to a number of reviews on this site. A friend who owned a copy, however, loved the film, while another friend (from a foreign country) expressed that he had learned to really understand the US Civil War from watching this film. I therefore decided to borrow the film and give it a try. It was, in short, a mistake.

  This was the first time I ever shut off a movie in progress. I found the acting and screen writing to be incredibly poor and amateurish, a surprise from such an otherwise talented group of professionals. I found the film to drag excessively, while at the same time jumping indiscrimately from scene to scene, so that it was difficult to follow. I cannot help but feel that unless a person were fairly familiar with the subject matter, one would be substantially lost throughout the movie (at least the portion which I was able to endure). In the same light, I found the editing to have been fairly poor as well.

  But even these are not my chief complaints for this movie. I understand quite well that the Civil War was far more complex than most presentations allow. I do not care for historical distortions on either side, whether in favor of the North or the South. I am not necessarily a historical purist either, and am open to a fair degree of poetic license. I understand the limits of film-making, which often necessitates sacrificing clarity or depth in favor of brevity. I nevertheless found this film very highly imbalanced in its presentation (in favor of the noble South), anachronistic in many ways, caracaturized and highly simplistic. The film frequently projects modern sensibilities into a 19th century context. The end result is a grossly distorted view of the events described, regardless of one's view of the conflict. It is poor history, poorly done.

  Why does this matter? Because the extent of many people's knowledge of and conclusions about the Civil War will be derived from this work. If that is the case, they will have a very distorted and inaccurate view of history, whether they are sympathetic with the North or the South. I am disturbed that afficionadoes of all things pertaining to the Civil War often seem to accept anything purporting to be a historical presentation as long as they can see dramatic battle scenes (actually, even these have been much better presented in other period films). It would be better if they used their justifiable interest in insisting upon higher quality productions and more historically accurate and balanced presentations. Instead, it seems (at least in this case) that the interest is more in being entertained by the tragedy, rather than in seeking a genuinely honest understanding of it. Hollywood has capitalized on such interests and has made a substantial amount of money as a result. Rather dishonoring to those who suffered and died in that conflict, don't you think?

  I have to conclude that this was probably the worst film I have attempted to watch. I would not want my daughter to have her understanding of the war shaped by this movie (not that that was a large problem, as she was completely lost, despite a fairly good grasp of the events for her age of 13). My wife, who is less discriminating about the movies she watches, says that it was without question, the worst film she has ever watched, despite the fact that she enjoys historical content. It does not bother me to watch a film that may (or may not) disagree with my personal conclusions. Its just that this is simply a very, very poor effort. That's a great pity, considering the great effort and expense put into its production. It would be best for potential buyers to invest their money elsewhere.",1153785600,16,4104,4.683333333333334
1887108,1,B00009OOFB,"Gods and Generals failed to hold my interest in any capacity and I do not recommend purchasing this DVD.  Arguments in favor of the Union or the Confederacy aside, the film did not engage, entertain or inform me.  On a positive note, it did cure bouts of insomnia on two occasions.

Having thoroughly enjoyed Gettysburg and the novels of Michael and Jeff Shaara, I looked forward to viewing this film.  The opening, segueing through images of various regiments' battle flags, and the beautiful soundtrack were well done and I settled in anticipating a great movie.  Things rapidly went down hill.  The film progressed from scene to scene without providing sufficient background on characters to understand their motivations, sacrificing depth for breadth.  Several of these scenes also lagged, as characters engaged in dialogue that did not advance the plot.  The battle scenes, while interesting, were too few and far between to save the movie's plodding tempo.

In the end I was left with the impression that Gods and Generals was for ""insiders"".  If you did not already have sufficient knowledge of the Civil War, the Army of Northern Virginia, or Thomas Jackson, you were not going to ""get"" it. This film will appeal to adherents to ""Lost Cause"" mythology, Civil War ""buffs"" who may be interested in the level of detail paid to costuming and props, and die-hard admirers of Jackson.",1152921600,13,1386,4.98695652173913
1887109,2,B00009OOFB,"First, a little personal background.  My ancestors in Tennessee and Texas were Unreconstructed Confederates to the core.

When the Civil War aka the ""War Between the States"" aka the ""War of Northern Aggression"" aka the ""War of the Rebellion"" was won and lost, the hopes and dreams of the Southron States (as they would soon take to calling themselves) were toppled and smashed flat.  Many ex-Confederates began to rethink their past and to redefine themselves.  Leading the parade of redefiners was no less a personage than ex-President Jefferson Davis.  Not far behind him on the military side was Jubal Early, a cantankerous, unlucky general who had managed to set off the Battle of Gettysburg by accident, just missed capturing Washington, D.C. [""Early was too late,"" chortled Sherman to Grant], and had the boom lowered on him--hard!--by Phil Sheridan.  Davis, Early and a host of others collectively created what has come to be known as the ""Lost Cause.""

Included among the many tenets of the Lost Cause is the notion that the South was a natural country, a freedom-loving nation driven reluctantly to take up arms by the rapacious greed of coarse, indifferent Northerners.  And, oh yes, a nation in which slavery played only a limited part among a narrow segment of the population, but which, nevertheless, conferred social and economic benefits for all.

The Lost Cause was, of course, unmitigated baloney.  And it still is.

Slavery was the evil core of the Confederacy.  Don't take my word for it.  Read the pre-war speeches of southerners extolling its God-ordained virtues.

The economic impact of slavery was overwhelming.  Consider just the cost of giving up slavery: a typical male slave in good physical condition had a market price of about $1200 dollars in 1861.  That was an enormous sum, far greater than the annual income of a free working man in the agrarian South.  Multiply that amount by the number of slaves and understand why the South was reluctant to release a major portion of its population from servitude.  The Lost Cause to the contrary, financial greed and rapacity were not the exclusive property of the Damyankees.

This movie is very much a piece of Lost Cause thinking.  Like many of the advocates of the Lost Cause, it uses half-truths to tell great whopping lies.  The most egregious of these half-truths involve the slaves portrayed on the screen.  Offhand, I can't recall coming across Stonewall Jackson's cook in Douglas Southall Freeman's magisterial, three-volume history ""Lee's Lieutenants,"" but I am willing to accept that there was such an individual much as portrayed in the film.  I am further willing to accept that at Fredericksburg and elsewhere were, as portrayed on screen, house slaves who displayed great loyalty to the persons and property of their owners.  But I am NOT willing to accept the movie's refusal to acknowledge that first thousands and then tens of thousands of slaves flocked to the Union army encampments.

The blue coated soldiers were initially at a loss to know what to do with them.  A few believed that they were still property and returned them to their owners, sometimes by force.  General Fremont declared them to be free and earned a blistering retort from Lincoln which forced him to rescind his premature Emancipation Proclamation.  At last a bright spark of a Yankee decided that the inflowing slaves were contraband of war and therefore subject to confiscation from owners who were in rebellion against the lawful government of the United States.  ""Contrabands"" they became--and their efforts contributed greatly to the Union cause.

Another half-true lie is the scene in which that singularly admirable man of peace and war, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, contemplates the forthcoming Battle of Fredericksburg.  He is shown quoting a classical passage on the return of Julius Caesar and his legions to the stream forming the boundary between Italy and his designated command area in Gaul.  By crossing that otherwise insignificant stream, Caesar placed himself at war with the legitimate power of the Senate and People of Rome.  He set on the path to seizing unlimited and tyrannical personal power.  The placement and set-up of this scene clearly implies that Chamberlain identified his army on the verge of crossing the Rapahannock River with that of Caesar's crossing the Rubicon, and that this crossing into Southron land was the beginning of a tyrannical seizure of power.

Now, Chamberlain, among many other things, was a college professor and far more learned in the classics than most of us today.  He might have even have made just such a quotation.  If he did, it is irrelevant.  First, the Union had already occupied territory in Virginia and had done so from the first day of the war, so the Army of the Potomac crossing that particular river had no significance for tyranny or otherwise.  Second, Lee's Army of Northern Virginia had just three months before invaded the North (and had paid a bloody price at the Battle of Antietam aka Sharpsburg.)  And third, to Yankee minds if anyone had crossed a Rubicon in willful defiance of his country and its laws, it was Confederate General Beauregard when he fired on Fort Sumter.

This is a film made up of several strands.  ""The Life of Saint Stonewall"" is such a strand, one closely related to the Lost Cause.  The nearest thing to a central figure in the film is Thomas Jonathan Jackson, whose life is loosely followed from the time he was a major in the US Army to the day he died as Lieutenant General Stonewall Jackson, commander of the Second Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia, slain by ""friendly fire"" after his set-piece triumph at Chancellorsville.  Jackson is by any measure extraordinary, a man as much out of the normal course of humanity as George S. Patton (whose ancestor and namesake, by the way, died commanding the 22d Virginia under General Jubal Early).

A biopic of Jackson might have been something to see, but this is not it.  Here, Jackson is made much less than he really was.  Like most of his contemporaries who grew up on the classics and devoured the works of Charles Dickens, Jackson was given to what seem to us to be pompous statements about duty combined with excessive sentimentality where children were concerned.  The movie gives us plenty of that--too much, in fact--but it shortchanges us on Jackson the man who kept his secrets, Jackson the man who waged ferocious feuds with other generals and, most of all, Jackson the man of war.  It entirely ignores Jackson in independent command in the Shenandoah Valley, carrying out one of the most brilliant campaigns in all of military history.  It is blind to Jackson at Second Bull Run, playing the anvil upon which the Army of Northern Virginia hammered poor, befuddled John Pope in Robert E. Lee's most perfect battle.

Finally, there are the battle scenes offered up by re-enactors in the thousands.  Specifically, we are shown a portion of the battlefield at the First Battle of Bull Run (aka Manassas) in 1861, Fredericksburg in 1862 and Chancellorsville in 1863.  These are the core of the movie.  The volunteer re-enactors devote vast quantities of time, money and discomfort to accuracy.  The producers virtually crow over the perfection of their images.

And I don't buy them for a second.

Bull Run was a complex series of encounters between two newly-raised and largely untrained armies.  It most certainly was not won by Jackson's brigade making a single frontal assault.

Fredericksburg was a three-phase battle that began with the building of a bridge while under heavy fire, a skirmish in the town and then the great, tragic assault on Lee's impregnable position.  It is the third phase that is unique.  A union brigade would march up the heights, be shot to pieces and another brigade would pass over the survivors to be shot to pieces in turn, again and again ... and yet again.  The stupendous bravery of the affair was matched only by the unbelievable stupidity of it.  In the movie we see the first Union brigade attack and fall, a second attack in parade ground order and a suggested third.  There were many, many more than that.  The unspeakable futility of this most futile of battles is hardly suggested.

At Chancellorsville, Jackson moved his corps swiftly and silently over mere country tracks to get to the unprotected flank of the much larger Union army.  Jackson's men were famous and tireless marchers but even they realized that their feat was something extraordinary.  They emerged out of the trees and routed the 11th Corps of the US Army--to the endless shame of that particularly luckless outfit.  The movie shows Jackson's corps begin its move and then it tells us they've arrived.  The grueling march that is the very essence of the battle is barely suggested.

Then the movie, in true pageant form, shows Confederate soldiers, hidden within the tree line, standing silently to attention in their extended line of battle, waiting for Jackson's order to attack.  Well, I for one do not believe that any Confederate soldier anywhere ever stood silently at attention while waiting for the order the move out, especially not exhausted, foot-weary ones.  And if I did believe that, I flat out do not believe--based on the universal testimony of the Confederates themselves--that any Confederate attack was ever made in straight and closely aligned lines of battle.  And even if I believed THAT, I still wouldn't believe that Jackson and his whole staff would ride twenty yards behind his skirmishers and in front of his main battle lines through the whole depth of the enemy position.

Finally, those re-enactors.  They are too healthy.  Too well-fed.  Look at the contemporary photographs.  By 1863, the Army of Northern Virginia was a fantastically skillful military machine composed of rail-thin, mad-eyed scarecrows--in no way resembling those good ol' boys on the screen.

""Gods and Generals"" is undramatic, misleading and ultimately unconvincing.  Too bad.

1887110,1,B00009OOFB,"Anyone who enjoyed the Jeff Shaara novel should stay away from this movie. After doing a marvelous job of translating ""Killer Angels"" into ""Gettysburg"", Maxwell seems to have abandoned this novel completely and decided to rewrite the screenplay from scratch.

Maxwell believes that the war was not a contest of good versus evil, but a complex event with many shades of gray. However his idea of bringing balance is to give us long winded speeches about the evil of Northern moneymen and a cast of compliant Black characters that could have been lifted out of the pages of ""Gone with the Wind"".

Worst of all, Maxwell has bought into the central myth of the Lost Cause, that Slavery was not the primary cause of the Civil War.  In one scene he has Jackson tell his servant that many Confederate Generals oppose slavery, and that he hopes that the Confederacy will have the wisdom to abolish slavery before the Union makes it an issue.

This is pure historical nonsense. It also undermines the integrity of the movie. Later he has Chamberlain say that the suffering caused by the war can only be justified by the elimination of the scourge of slavery. Has he forgotten that a few scenes earlier he had Jackson claim the South would abolish slavery on its own? Instead of a struggle for the soul of America, the audience is left with a tragic misunderstanding of people too stupid to figure out that they really didn't have anything to fight about.

Maxwell has stated his intention to make the third movie in the trilogy ""Last Full Measure"". The hope that he would return to the discipline of ""Gettysburg"" is slight, given that he has dismissed all criticism of ""Gods and Generals"" as the product of Political Correctness.",1152230400,10,1720,4.739130434782608

I just recently got around to seeing it on DVD.

I wish they had a section of deleted Scenes. No sence good editing getting rid of good scenes that are not good enough to keep to keep the air time down.

I wish the commentary had been longer and included the North rather than restrict itself to Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. In peticular I wish it had covered teh scene of Winfield Scott Hancock confronting Burnside. Burnside is one of the more fascinating officers of the conflict though not among its better generals. He did not want for courage. He did not want for innovative ability. He designed and built one of the war's better breachloaders. The uniform he designed for his Rhoad Island volunteers was certainly better suited to the southern summers than the regular one issued to most Northern troops. Long before the Marines he created the natian's first amphibous assault corps. Unfortunately he did lack flexability and a capacity for follow up. His business manufacturing his carbine went bust for his lack of advertisement. His amphipeous corps spent most of its use as a regular formation. Fredericksberg speaks for  itself.

I enjoyed the movie. I just wish it had not centered around the south in the beginning. Northerners were just as intense. Just as Southerners were mobilizing for war so were Northerners who were just as mad as they. We have to remember this fight had been thirty years or so in the brewing.  Now that northern interests were taking over the Federal government which the southern elite now understood they could never recover, the south was trying to cut out so to preserve their  power in the area of the nation where they were strong. The North wasn't going to let them get away. Indeed, we don't see the North in its actions until Chamberlain makes his appearence.

Other than these flaws which a later DVD can correct I very much enjoyed this movie. I loved the committment to detail and authenticity. I liked that it gave blacks an authentic place. Acting was first rate. Battle scenes were spectaculer.

1887116,5,B00009OOFB,"This is an outstanding film. Based upon Michael Shaara's Pulitzer prize winning book, ""The Killer Angels"", it tells the story of the battle at Gettysburg, which took place over the first three days of July in 1863. For the most part, the film examines that pivotal battle, one of the bloodiest of the war, from the perspective of the commanders who were calling the shots (no pun intended).

The viewer will be enthralled by the film's recreation of the battle at Gettysburg, which examines some of the militairy stratagems employed and the reasons for them. It attempts to explain how it was that over fifty thousand (50,000) men lay dead or injured at its conclusion. It also recreates one of the most amazing routs in history, when Union Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, defying the odds, held off the Confederates at Little Round Top, part of the high ground that the Union needed to retain at Gettysburg. Chamberlain, who was not a professional soldier but a professor at Bowdoin College in Maine, ultimately received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his valor and success in holding the Confederacy at bay at Little Round Top. Jeff Daniels, who plays the role of Chamberlain, is superlative.

The rest of the star studded cast is likewise marvelous. Tom Berenger as General Longstreet, Martin Sheen as General Robert E. Lee, Richard Jordan as General Lewis Armistead, and Stephen Lang as General Pickett, in particular, all deserve a standing ovation, as does Jeff Daniels. This is a film that attempts to be historically accurate, and it succeeds brilliantly. It does not glamorize war, but shows it in all its heartbreaking reality. It even depicts General Pickett's audacious charge, which saw the loss of an entire division of Confederate soldiers. This is a film entirely about the men who took part in the battle at Gettysburg and the outcome that set the course for the country we know today. Kudos to director Robert F.

The battle scenes seemed choppy, and that's the main reason why I wanted to see this movie.  Being a prequel to the FAR-SUPERIOR ""Gettysburg,"" I guess I was expecting too much.  Sure, ""Gettysburg"" didn't have the budget of ""Gods and Generals,"" but it sure felt more epic.

There are only a FEW good things about this movie:

1) the actor who played ""Stonewall Jackson"" was really good.

2) the scene where the Union Irish charged the Confederate Irish was really powerful, I thought

3) there was some kind of Union raid in some town that I felt was kinda cool.  I haven't seen this movie in a few years so you'll have to forgive my lack of precision here.

Anyways, when you get down to it, this movie doesn't belong anywhere NEAR ""Gettysburg.""  ""Gettysburg"" puts this movie to shame.  Heck, ""Glory"" puts this movie to shame.  ""Andersonville"" puts this movie to shame.  ""Dances With Wolves"" puts this movie to shame.  Just about any movie set during the Civil War period puts this movie to shame.  This movie is a disgrace, and its failure will probably deter future filmmakers from tackling another period piece set during the Civil War.

Jeff Shaara's book was a carefully balanced look at the Civil War from the point of view of two Northern and two Southern soldiers.  Maxwell elected to drop Winfield Scott Hancock, and I think that's a great pity.  Hancock differed from Chamberlain more than Lee differed from Jackson.  Hancock's story offered a different and very interesting perspective; I think it was a great shame to lose his retort: "" ... it is not God who will assemble us on the battlefield, nor position our troops, nor place the cannon, and it is not God who will aim the musket.""

Maxwell has made a Civil War Southern.  He claims that he attempted to broaden the book by adding civilians, but all are loyal to the Confederacy, including the two African-Americans.  One of those is a freedman who wants to work for Stonewall Jackson in order to do his bit against the damnyankees.  The other is a slave woman, mother of three children, who dresses like a middle- or upper-class white woman and is devoted to her owners.  Both of these characters deliver anti-slavery speeches, but both scenes are played in a way that undercuts the message.  I think these are fig leaves so that Maxwell can try to wriggle out of a charge of whitewashing slavery.  [added coments: I wouldn't have minded Maxwell telling the story from the Southern point of view if he hadn't been so dishonest about, maybe with himself as much as with the audience.  I think that taking the movie by itself, the average viewer would get the idea that it was to be taken as balanced.  In that sense, Gone with the Wind was a better movie.  It was clearly from the point of view of wealthy plantation owners, and the slaves, while they don't complain, aren't made to quite so blatently embrace their slavery.  We don't get into the heads of the GWTW slaves as we do in this movie.]

Maxwell claims that he did the movie this way because our view of the conflict is so skewed toward the Union that we cannot understand the Southern point of view.  Given the number of Sons and Daughters of the Confederacy, the vast and varied number of books published on the topic, and perhaps most especially, Shelby Foote's star turn in Ken Burns' Civil War documentary, I would have to say that Maxwell is delusional.

But, let's skip all these issues.  Maxwell presumably paid for the movie rights, he has the right to adapt the book however he wants, and it's a free country: he can make a Southern if he wants to.  It's still a painfully dull movie.  I left the room briefly about a half hour into it and told my friend not to bother stopping the DVD on my account.  I later apologized for having wasted her afternoon by suggesting we watch this.

My willing suspension of disbelief will overcome reenactors who are not utterly authentic, weird beards, actors playing younger characters when they are older, etc.  The acting is incredibly uneven, however.  The actor playing one of the minor southern generals, I have forgotten which one, turned in the worst performance I have ever seen anyone bother to preserve.  I think that I would have at least redubbed it with someone who doesn't sound like a semi-literate trying to read cue cards.  As a general rule, whenever a character voiced an authentic quote, it sounded so stilted that I felt I could see the quote marks and citation hanging in the air.

The worst problem is that Maxwell simply doesn't edit his material down to a manageable, satisfying length.  Many of the scenes went on long after most of the audience must have gotten the point; by the time the opposing Irish brigades finished bewailing having to fight one another, I wanted someone to put the lot of them out of their misery.  Considering how Maxwell has done most of this movie, Joshua Chamberlain, much as I admire him, is an anomaly and should have been cut to a minor character; I suspect this is another fig leaf.  It didn't provide balance, just pointless narrative bloat.  Indeed, except for streaming across the battlefield, we should never have heard from any Union troops except as narrative bridges.  Maxwell's heart was clearly in making a Southern about Stonewall Jackson, and that should have been the focus of the movie.

I actually enjoyed the Jacksons - I can't say that I am terribly knowledgeable about them, but they seem consistent with what I know about them and their mutual affection and deep religious faith are touchingly portrayed.  Stephen Lang does an excellent job of embodying a rather unusual man.

I have abandoned my plans to see Maxwell's previous effort, Gettysburg, and he certainly needn't make the third movie in the trilogy on my account.  Meanwhile, I suggest reading the book.  At almost 500 pages, it didn't seem nearly as long as the movie.  [Added later:] At the urging of G.T. Howell's comment, I did watch Gettysburg.  It was MUCH better.",1146960000,18,4958,4.67358708189158

It is finally a good movie that is done to the ""right side"" without making the Confederates look like racist idiots.  I could have done without the Yankee side in this movie, but overall it is fantastic.  The movie follows Stonewall Jackson and his devout belief in Christ and his fierce moves on the battlefield.  The beautiful relationship with his wife is also handled well, showing how complex this man was and where his heart and soul lay.",1146700800,6,607,4.4818181818181815
1887120,3,B00009OOFB,"Gods and Generals is like a record album containing three or four very good songs worth hearing over and over, while the rest are forgettable.  The major problem with this film is that it is really too long; the great scenes -- and there are several -- are spread over filler that could have been substantially edited.

The second major issue is the unnatural dialogue.  While 19th century Americans (particularly Southerners) might have written to one another in flowery, Victorian prose, it is doubtful that they actually spoke to one another in lengthy soliloquies.

Those criticisms aside, there are magnificent moments in the film that make it memorable.  Robert Duvall is simply perfect as Robert E. Lee, and he subtly casts a shadow of doubt over this revered historical figure.  The last scenes in the film capture this: as Stonewall Jackson lays dying, Lee is asked by Jackson's personal chaplain if he will come see the fallen hero.  ""No sir...no sir, I won't,"" says Lee, unable to come face to face with the final moments of his best lieutenant's life.  Yet, Jackson's wife proves to be as brave (if not more so) as all the gallant soldiers and generals, as she fortifies her husband's faith and grants him permission to ""cross the river, and rest beneath the shade of the trees.""

The Confederate route of the Union right flank at Chancellorsville is spectacularly photographed, owing much to the cinemagraphic effects of the long tracking and deep focus shots found in the works of Stanley Kubrick and Sergio Leone.

There is enough provocative history and stunning visuals to warrant making a purchase of this difficult but ultimately rewarding film.",1145577600,5,1664,4.953237410071942
1887121,3,B00009OOFB,"First off, I am a war movie buff --- I enjoy most war movies simply because they show the brutal reality that soldiers have to go through, and I appreciate that insight. I first watched this movie 3 years ago at a time when I had little to no historical insight, knowledge of the Civil War, or interest in war movies. Within 30 minutes, I had to turn the movie off --- it bored me intensely. 3 years later (about 2 months ago), I went out and bought the movie and its sequel (Gettysburg) and watched them at length --- I was far more impressed this time around.

Positives:

- Battle portrayals: amazing battle scenes. Although not necessarily perfect, the battle scenes in this movie are the best I've seen in any Civil War movie. Realistic, historically accurate, and raw.

- Amazing actors: they have a great cast in this movie. Robert Duvall makes a far more convincing Robert E. Lee than does the guy who played him in ""Gettysburg"". Stephen Lang's portrayal of Stonewall Jackson is absolutely amazing --- for Civil War buffs, Lang's acting alone is enough reason to see the movie. Jeff Daniels' acting, again, is on the spot; nothing to complain about.

Negatives:

- Some bad acting: I was disappointed that, in the brief scenes where General Pickett was portrayed, he wasn't as lively a character as he was in ""Gettysburg"". However, this is due to the fact that in ""Gettysburg"", he was portrayed by Steven Lang, who played Stonewall Jackson in this movie --- so I guess it can be forgiven. ""Gettysburgs""'s General Longstreet was far better than this movie's Longstreet, and I was disappointed to see that they got another guy to play him; but he doesn't play a major role in this movie so it's not that big of a deal.

- A Southern bias: It is certainly true that not all Southerner's were racists, slaveowners, or secessionists, and many (or most?) were just defending their homes, as anyone would. However, I think this movie over-idealized the South. While it is true that General Lee was far from racist and in fact very anti-slavery, as was General Jackson, I can't help but notice that the entire Southern movement throughout this movie is portrayed in a benevolent tone while the Federal armies don't recieve near similar treatment.

Overall, good movie to watch, intense battles, significant portrayal of battlefield tactics, amazing actors for the main characters... etc. But, 4 hours is too long, and it's not perfect. 3 out of 5 stars.",1145404800,12,2453,4.730679156908665

A friend of mine recommended it highly to me (I love epic films), and I thought it was a masterpiece.  I was entralled for all of it (229 minutes or so).  It goes into detail on why the South fought the North, and it skews the tiresome cliche that the South only went to war because of slavery.  I would like to compare it to another Civil War film, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (yes, the Spaghetti Western).  Critics didn't like that one when it came out (even though they recognise it as a masterpiece today), because it didn't have a nice, tidy view of the Civil War either.  Neither of these 2 films are simplistic, which is perhaps why critics dumped all over them, because they challenge the status quo.  Stephen Lang gives a commanding performance as Stonewall Jackson.  The scene in which he finds out a little girl he once knew died is so vividly acted you can't help but come away affected.  He should have been nominated for an Oscar.

This movie is based mainly on the life of Stonewall Jackson during the Civil War (it does also make a good bit of reference to his life before the war). I had read of Jackson in history books before but never went in depth to find out details. After seeing the movie, I have a strong respect for the man that he was and the life he lived for the Lord. He lived a life that inspires you to examine your own and live just as fearless and brave.

There is also a good documentary on this DVD that overviews Jackson's life and how things for him lead up to the war.

Needless to say, I highly recommend this movie to anyone.",1143158400,3,822,4.256410256410256
1887125,2,B00009OOFB,"I have to agree that this film effort doesn't quite match up to the work of Gettysburg. But hell, even with the latter film, which I mainly enjoyed, I could only assign four full stars, as it, too, dragged in places, plus it did not convey a convincing portrayal of the sole battle of its subject line, much less the campaign which led up to it, or for that matter the retreat afterward and all that that portended for the South and the North. The thing is, even with as much time and effort and raw film footage as was actually expended, Gettysburg did not in any sense afford a jointed portrayal of the battle. Many significant events were wholly ignored throughout, enough so that the battle action that is on the screen could only makes a kind of half-sense even to people who already know and comprehend the historical lines of that three-day struggle. The worst example of this is Ewell's refusal to storm Cemetery Hill in the early evening of the first day. Now who could possibly understand that nonsensical night speech in front of Lee which relates to this critcal juncture of the battle, or for that matter realize who that unnamed Confederate General was who was talking to Lee, who did not already know this battle's particulars inside-out? I call that kind of confusion ""history"" on the cheap. Still, I do hope that someway somehow someday that the third Shaara installment will find its way to the big screen, if for no other reason just to be ""complete.""

I have a lots of relatively-minor quibbles. For example, I do not understand the re-casting of Mr. Lang this time around as Stonewall Jackson, and I agree wholeheartedly with those before me who view the movie's seemingly never-ending fits of drawn-out dialogue as a boring detraction from the unfolding events of the otherwise semi-compelling scenes of actual battle. The American Civil War was not about endless talk, it was about certain slaughter on the field which owed itself to regrettable political misunderstanding and amateurish administration both North and South. As for the gentleman who curiously observed that the Confederacy surely would have eventually known its day in the sun had only old Tommy not been gunned down by his own troops in the gloaming of Chancellorsville . . . well, like I said, or at least meant to strongly imply, neither of these two films necessarily teaches much history.

As for myself, for all my carping I'm about to buy this second title, but only to have it in my library, just in case, as it were. Really, it's not so hot as epic films go. If I had to somehow relate these two titles to what's gone before, I'd say Gettysburg compares a little bit to the okay Harrison/Taylor beginning to the Joseph Mankiewicz over-hyped Cleopatra, while the ACW prequel under consideration relates unfortunately and much more surely to the Burton (wasted again)/Taylor sleepy conclusion to that 1963 excess.

1887127,2,B00009OOFB,"... That's what I thought after viewing Gods & Generals. To followup a masterpiece like Gettysburg with this mess is a travesty. Sadly, because of Gods & Generals' terrible box office performance, we will never see the conclusion to the Shaara Civil War trilogy onscreen. Anyhow, here are some things you may wish to know about this film:

  Gods & Generals the movie is based on the book by Jeff Shaara. His father Michael wrote The Killer Angels, which the movie Gettysburg was based on. Jeff wrote the book as a prequel to The Killer Angels, then he wrote The Last Full Measure, which is a sequel to The Killer Angels (thus forming a Shaara trilogy). After the success of Gettysburg, a low budget made-for-television affair, Ted Turner decided to go all out and produce a HUGE budget follow up. The obvious choice was Gods & Generals.

  Now, here's where things get interesting, as Gods & Generals follows a strange pattern that Hollywood has developed. When ever a followup is given a larger budget, larger scale, etc, that film is always MUCH worse than the original cheaply made film! Typical of bloated Hollywood. Gods & Generals had a MUCH larger budget than Gettysburg, it had more production time allowed, it had more expensive sets, a more expensive cast, more of EVERYTHING, and it is a MESS of a movie. Not only is it boring, it is long winded, not well acted, not well choreographed, and incredibly disappointing. How did things go so terribly wrong?!

  First and foremost, I feel I must mention Steven Lang's performance as Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson. The real life Jackson was a VERY odd man, because he had strange quirks to his personality (like covering himself with icewater soaked cloths every morning), some strange beliefs (like he had to stand so his internal organs would be 'properly stacked'), and an INCREDIBLY intense zeal for battle, which he (oddly enough) attributed to his DEEP, DEEP Christian religious convictions. All of this is well known to Civil War historians. However, Lang seems to focus soley on Jackson's oddities, almost as if it was the definition of the man. Jackson had quirks and oddities, but these were just that: QUIRKS and ODDITIES. They were NOT Jackson's whole being, as Lang's portrayal would lead us to believe. The portrayal is so over the top as to be a parody, and Lang's average acting makes it just that much worse. (as a side note, Lang quite deftly portrayed George Pickett in Gettysburg. Here, Pickett is portrayed by another actor). In addition to Lang's performance, virtually the entire cast seem to phone in their performances, almost as if they are just here to get their paycheck. In a historical drama, that is VERY BAD news, since the whole movie hinges on you believing these characters are the REAL people. Even Tom Berringer and Jeff Daniels, who gave EXCELLENT performances in Gettysburg, seem more subdued. One bright note is Robert Duvall, who gives a more even portrayal of Robert E. Lee than Martin Sheen's slightly histrionic version of Lee in Gettysburg.

  The battle scenes are few and far between in Gods & Generals, and are nowhere near as well done as in Gettysburg. It appears the director wanted to focus more on battlefield drama than on accurate depictions of Civil War battle. The Battle Of Bull Run (Manassas) is poorly depicted, with unrealistic violence and pacing. The choreography is second rate. Fredricksburg doesn't fare much better: One of the truly great 'unintentionally funny' moments in film history comes as Union troops shoot a rebel soldier on a rooftop. In a FANTASTICALLY cliched moment, the rebel breaks through a railing to fall to the ground. 'B' western, anyone?????

  Sadly, the movie focuses too much on Jackson, and not enough on the events of the Civil War. The interpersonal relations in Gettysburg worked because they were wrapped around the framework of the great Civil War battle; here, the battles feel like an afterthought that were thrown in hastily so the movie can get right back to focusing on Stonewall Jackson's personal life. Very misguided, very bad movie making.

  All in all, this film shoots so wide of the mark it is a bit embarrassing. Throw in the expectations set by the EXCELLENT Gettysburg, and you have a terribly disappointing movie in Gods & Generals. My actual rating for this movie is 2 and a half stars (not two), because it is not a AWFUL movie, it just isn't very good. Plus, it gets a little extra credit for at least attempting such an ambitious project as this. The fact that it fails in the attempt is saddening mostly because we will never see the final movie in the trilogy, and that is a shame. Had it been as good as Gettysburg, The Last Full Measure could have been another 5 star historical drama, which there is dreadful shortage of.

The reviews I have read which rate the film low tend to disagree with the southern philosophy, not the portrayal of the characters on film.  These reviewers can't accept the fact that people of the south actually thought that way - in spite of what was going on in the rest of the world.

The Civil War is complex, has many individual events and people, with many different viewpoints.  The film takes on a difficult task and makes it understandable, hitting some of the key events and people.

I look forward to the third installment of this series to complete the telling of the Civil War.  I recommend the series for anyone who wants to learn about the war in a form other than documentary, or who wants to grow to know some of the main characters.",1137801600,5,862,4.35625
1887131,2,B00009OOFB,"This movie is rather intelligent and moving, but its production crew seems to have been dominated by Johnny Rebs.

First of all: it is indeed true that Victorian people, including upper class Southern people, talked as they do in the movie, cried and prayed readily and generally worked themselves into a State as does Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson. The film's makers and Shelby Foote knew this and present an historically accurate picture of what at its best was nobility but at its worst, simple hypocrisy.

It is however a Big Lie that African Americans were as loyal to and as loving of ole Massah as is shown. It is a Big Lie that (as implied by a comment of Jackson) the South was a-fixin' to free the slaves, and documentation for the truth is in the Confederate constitution, which while banning the slave trade (there being enough slaves to reproduce naturally) banned any repeal of slavery.

The South was in fact a primitive police state in which house slaves professed a loyalty they did not for the most part feel.

In a throwaway line, Jeff Daniels in an excellent portrayal of Union general Joshua Chamberlain, one of the more likable characters in the film, says that slavery is common in other parts of the world, but that the USA should be an exception by means of the Emancipation.

This is another lie. By 1863, slavery was unknown in the European world and in European colonies except for Brazil, in which emancipation did not come until the 1880s. Serfdom, a Christian evolution of slavery that recognized some basic rights of the serf, was on the verge of being abolished in its last stand, in Tsarist Russia.

Joshua Chamberlain and his brother were fighting a primitive police state whose noble ""cause"" was a New South for the immediate postwar doing a land office business opening new resource markets in crops adapted to slave labor, a South that would have become a Fascist state in the 20th century.

This was to the shame of Americans worldwide who throughout what was then known as the civilized world were in fact reviled for their Peculiar institution.

The movie is also an insult to the memory of Abraham Lincoln, because its perspective is class biased towards the gentry and to the Northern and Southern gentry, Lincoln was an uncouth self-made man. The fact that Lincoln, unlike Jay Gould and the Vanderbilts, did so fair and square as a lawyer was held against him by a Northern bourgeoisie a-fixin' to enslave the immigrants to wage labor and by a Southern slave-driving ""aristocracy"" consisting of the scrapings of Stuart England.

Lincoln is an offstage evil genius who sends the weeping and prayin' fellas to their death. The fact is that Lincoln was an agnostic because he couldn't figger out jest how men like Stonewall could reconcile slavery and ""the black flag"" of secesh piracy with ""Christianity"" EXCEPT with a weep and a pray in a boneyard.

The secesh generals were in modern terms war criminals because they waged an unwinnable war based on an overly narrow agricultural basis in the name of the violation of human rights. It is high time that the true story be told of the Union generals who unlike Burnside knew their trade and who without the nauseating hypocrisy here displayed by Bobby Lee and Stonewall set about their grim task, with old Grant being exhibit number one.

Old Sam would be hard to sentimentalize and that is why he, and Lincoln, were more attractive to an older generation of Northern civil war buffs like Illinois poet and socialist Carl Sandburg.

This film Manufactured Consent to a southern adventure: the crusade in Iraq. It sentimentalized war, because you can be as ""realistic"" as you want and avoid silly errors such as the grossly fat, body by McDonald's ""re-enactors"" who cheer Bobby Lee in the earlier film Gettysburg (news flash: the Rebs were on short rations), but the Big Lie remains, with digital flash and precision: ""dulce et decorum est"".

Against this nonsense, despite its being innately moving to any American like me, the recent French film Joyeux Noel is much to be preferred, because the latter film presents war honestly, as a rich man's ""war"" but a poor man's ""fight"".

Lincoln was showing restraint at the period narrated in the beginning of the film, and it was treason for Virginia to refuse to defend the union plain and simple. This film is at base an intelligent and moving celebration of a Higher Treason: that treason of a ""noble"" Brutus who for a Cause overthrows his sovereign.

Dante condemned Brutus to the lowest point in Hell, and this continuation into a second century of filmic celebrations of The Cause (starting with Birth of a Nation) is a celebration of treason, one that today preserves racism in America.

Where are the films about Lincoln (such as John Ford's Young Mr. Lincoln)? Or John Brown? These Secesh films are like D. W. Griffiths' Birth of a Nation rewriting an American northern immigrant history in favor of a small slave owning class. The great-grandchildren of this class now control entirely too much of the US with Sunbelt domination of our culture.

I tried to see Gods and Generals in the theater and couldn't even last until intermission (was there an intermission?).  If you are a civil war buff who is only interested in the big battle scenes, you may like some of this. If you are interested in the human element of the war--which is what makes the Civil War so powerful even 140 years later, this film is horrible.

All the sanctimonious speechmaking that fills the non-battle scenes are intolarable.  In terms of accurate portrayals and white-washing of the characters, I'll leave to other reviewers.

But even during the open credits music, I could tell I was in for a rough ride. Instead of just showing us and letting us make our own emotional conclusions, this started with the ""oh, I'm telling you audiences this is going to be a powerful and moving story--If you are not deeply moved, there is something wrong with you!""--sort of a technique Spielberg uses in his historical films--which is why his are so over-rated!

Missing where the interactions that were so moving in Killer Angels and Gettysberg: Armistead's opening up to Longstreet about his conflicts about fighting his closest friend, and Chamberlain's--well most everything about Chamberlain was remarkably dead-on in the first movie.  Remarkable historical characters portrayed with remarkable human performances by Jeff Daniels and a sadly missed Richard Jordan.  Daniels, so great the first time, should had stayed home. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain is one of my true heros; Jeff remarkably captured the essence of the man the first time; despite obvious aging (double chin and all) between films, I assume at least part of Jeff's problem was the material.

And that brings us to the main problem: I think most of the problem is in the source: Jeff Shaara's novel (which I did try to read) was just lacking in everything that made his father's novel so powerful, especially when considering the scope of the event.  The emotional resonance in Killer Angels was honest and intimate; Gods and Generals is dishonest and contrived. Since Maxwell did so well the first time, I just assume the fault is with the material--He had nothing to work with.

As other reviewers have said here, Gods and Generals is a quick history of 2 years of the Civil War with simplistic and artificiallay reverent views of the primarary characters and expressed in a style of santamonious and other artificial wrappings that do nothing to capture the real power of these events.

This movie was pretty faithful to the book as far as Stonewall Jackson was concerned.  But so much was left out about the other characters.  Yes, the movie contained much about Lee; however, the rising winds of war in California and Texas were nonexistent.

The movie takes us from 1861 to before the Battle of Gettysburg.

This movie is the prequel to Gettysburg, an excellent Civil War movie based on the book, Killer Angels, by Jeff's father.

I felt compelled to offer my own opinion. And it won't be a historical essay like an earlier person wrote, who obviously hates the South and didn't even MENTION the movie!

This film has great ambitions that it lives up to in a lot of areas. The acting is overall excellent, it was nice to see a lot of actors in minor parts recreate their roles from Gettysburg, and Robert Duvall and Kali Rocha (as Stonewall Jackson's wife) are especially good. The battle scenes are exciting and painstakingly recreated, and the photography is gorgeous.

This is one of the few films that try to show a balanced view of the war, and especially the South, not an easy task in these PC times. It is overlong, and some of the dialogue borders on speechifying, but this can be overlooked because of the films merits. It gets better with each viewing. And the opening song, Going Home, should definitely have been nominated for an Oscar. Definitely worth seeing.

1887139,4,B00009OOFB,"There is a lot to like about this movie.  However, the movie is not faithful to the book in all matters.  As mentioned a million times in regards to this movie, Jackson recieves a great deal of attention.  More importantly, Jackson's portrayal is nothing like the book and nothing like he is portrayed in Foote's history.  In the movie he is contstantly giving long speeches and seems quite the outgoing sort.  Elsewhere he is described as being rather detached and very private.  Thus, when he does express himself, ""kill all of them,"" or crying at the death of an innocent, it is much more powerful than the movie can capture.  I fast forward through most of this.

DuVall on the other hand is given little help.  Although he is great, his scenes offer him few foils or collaborators.  Partly this is a casting problem. Longstreet, Lee's adjutant, and others Lee interacts with through the novel offer DuVall almost nothing to work with.

Still, the movie captures essential aspects of the book.  The battles are more realistic than many would like to watch.  More painful is the decision making (on the Union side) that throws so many brave men to their deaths.

Perhaps the mini-series, less glamorous, is the better medium for the great books this and ""Gettysburg"" were based on.",1126137600,2,1284,4.777272727272727

If you are from the South and follow the Civil War, you REALLY like this movie as it shows all the good and little of the bad of the Confederacy and their view of slavery.

But, let's face reality, this is a long, long film, that tried to be too ambitious and too broad in terms of the audience it was trying to reach. I suspect given the $50mm+ budget, that the studio wanted the scenes with Chamberlain's wife, Jackson at Christmas, Jackson with his servant, the musical interlude, and the cute little kids to entice women to see a movie featuring civil war battles. To me, by trying to have a little something for everyone, they made it less enjoyable for their true audience - guys who like war movies and long for a decent Civil War movie.

Maybe they'll try and recoup their investment in this film by packaging it in chronoligical order with Gettysburg as a 2 film set. (Notwithstanding the issues of cast changes.) If they do, leave only those scenes directly related to what this should have been - a war movie.

1887142,3,B00009OOFB,"This DVD is a faithful screen adaptation of the book ""Gods and Generals"", by Jeffrey Shaara.  It deals with the very beginnings of the American Civil War and progresses through the battle of Chancellorsville.  The book (and movie) are part of a three-part trilogy on the Civil War.  The movie is produced by Ted Turner, who makes a small cameo appearance as a southern soldier. This movie is a prequel to the 1993 hit ""Gettysburg"".

The movie (like the book) centers on the major generals of the war, Robert E. Lee (played to a ""tee"" by Robert Duvall), General ""Stonewall"" Jackson (excellently played by Stephan Lang), and the union's Lt. Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain (played by the very capable Jeff Daniels).  Of course, the leadership on each side believes in and prays to a God that they hope will deliver them victorious, thus the title ""Gods and Generals"".

While the movie has sweeping visuals and equisitely accurate battle sceens, the movie is simply too long at nearly 4 hours in length.  Proper editing would have resulted in a more enjoyable film.  Too much time is allowed for elegant proseic speeches by the generals, generally to their wives.  The movie really bogs down in these sections and one is tempted to fast forward past them to the action that lies ahead.

The actors do a remarkable job; all are believable and truly become the character(s) they portray.  The battle scenes are the film's strength and are an eye-opener for anyone not familiar with the bloody brutality of the Civil War, our nation's bloodiest conflict.  The courage of the soldiers facing an 800-yard march across an open field being pounded by cannon fire is something to behold.  The historical accuracy of the film is also a draw, as it teaches Civil War history.

I believe the average viewer will tire of this movie due to its excessive length.  However, the Civil War buff will revel in the great detail and the effort to make the film historically accurate.  The film is appropriate for all but the youngest members of the family, as some of the killing is graphic.  I doubt that children will be able to watch the film to its conclusion, as they will lose interest in the non-battle scenes.

With proper editing, this could have been a 4 or 5-star movie.  The best I can give it is a 3-star rating due to its length.

1887144,4,B00009OOFB,"*Some Minor Spoilers*

In a way, this film plays out like a greek epic, a good lens to approach the Civil War dramatically. There is even the metaphysical element in the faith of both sides, manifested especially in Jackson, and events like the aurora borealis appearing at night (which really happened).

The center of this movie is Stonewall Jackson, whose faith and committment to his home make him a fanscinating character.  As a evangelical myself, I have to say I like this portrayal of Jackson better than others I have seen.  Jackson's devotion to God, family, and Virginia and his beliefs are uncomprimisingly presented, but so are the less comfortable aspects: such as his ruthlessness in battle and his naive perspective on slavery.  It's an honest, nonjudgmental portrayal that let's the audience come to it's own conclusions.

With regards to slavery, one may well ask: ""Where are the auctions? The floggings?""  These aspects and stories of the South have been (and should be) told in other media, but the focus here is different.  Here we have honest, God fearing people like General Lee, who was against slavery, faced with the paradox of defending their freedom, which will mean saving a system which deprives that freedom from others.  We see Jim Lewis (who really was the slave cook of Jackson, on lease to the General), who sees Virginia as his home and worthy of being defended from outsiders as much as the Jackson, yet in his prayer before the onlooking General wonders aloud how good Christian people could allow slavery to continue.  We see another slave woman, with a family, who has grown up with a white family (a true luxury for many slaves, it wasn't uncommon for families to be broken up when one family member, be it a husband or wife or child, was sold), and clearly shows concerns for their safety in light of the incoming federal invasion.  Yet, when she's left with federal troops who use her house as a hospital, she clearly desires the north to win, for her and her children to be free.  To me this highlights the contradiction of slavery in a supposedly free, supposedly Christian society.

The film has several poigant moments, from the charge hopeless charge of the Northern Irish Brigade against the Georgia Irish Brigade, Chamberlain's speech as he notes the parallel between them and Caesar crossing the Rubicon, to the exchange between Billy Yank and Jonny Reb.  The flaws, as I see it, are that the film gets a bit misdirected.  Is it just about Jackson, with a few token spots for Chamberlain, or are was the perspective supposed to be evenly spaced between North and South?  It ends up being neither.  Also, it's clear from watching Gettysburg that the director wanted to pull a parallel between the Union's hopeless charge at Fredericksburg and Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg, but to me it just didn't pull off.

But I think it's a good movie, and well worth the four hours time spent, for both the Civil War buff and the causal movie fan.",1122076800,6,2987,4.7894736842105265
1887145,3,B00009OOFB,"I'm a Civil War buff, I've seen ""Gettysburg"" by the same film crew and loved it, so I was excited to see ""Gods and Generals.""  But what a frustrating mixture of good and bad!

The good:

(1) A thought-provoking look at the jumble of attitudes about, and causes of, the Civil War.  Lee and Jackson are devout Christians who dislike slavery, but see the country as a league of states and therefore give their primary loyalty to their home state.  Thus, they are thrown into leadership of a horrific rebellion.

The tragedy, hinted at in the movie (but which might have been brought out more explicitly), is that these decent men FAIL to see that the war IS about slavery.  In one exquisitely written and performed scene, Jackson prays with his slave and reassures him that the military high command is pushing the southern politicians to free the slaves so they can fight for the South.  Yet, as the slave seems to understand, Jackson is fooling himself.  The southern politicos weren't about to do that and Jackson has become a pawn of their pro-slavery agenda.

Yet despite the hypocrisy and wrongness of their cause, many southerners were, as Jackson, Lee, and others depicted in the film, otherwise honorable people -- and that was the tragedy.

This is counter-balanced by scenes showing the forces of the North as salted with courseness, ineptness and brutality, yet still in the end fighting for the right reasons and the right cause, and soldiers such as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, also a devout Christian like his foes Jackson and Lee, perceiving this fact and therefore finding some redeeming feature from all the carnage.  The movie gives a good glimpse of these internal conflicts, contradictions, and tragedies.  The first half of the film seems pro-South, but the last half brings balance.

(2) The film is not filled with compressed action and suspense like ""Gettysburg,"" but as it meanders and wanders, the cinematography is gorgeous and the visual sense of history is wonderful.  Amidst the slowness, there are some priceless scenes and a building wistfullness that supports the epic tragedy you see unfolding.  ""Gods and Generals"" is less a typical movie narrative and more of a series of scenes that carry you along as they tell their story in words and, especially, in visual images.

(3) You do learn something, though not enough, of the characters involved in the war.

(4) The movie was one of the best I've seen at showing a realistic picture of Christianity.  The prayers seemed sincere and heartfelt, and the interactions between Jackson and his wife were done well, especially in showing the complexity of their relationship as a couple.  You observe a man who at many points shows great faith, yet at others confesses his own struggles and doubts and must be brought back to center by his wife -- in other words, it was a very human portrayal, not an idyllic and unrealistic one.

Bad:

(1) Bad editing.  Appalling at times.  Leading to . . .

2)  Unbalanced historical narrative and a serious lack of context.  Unless you're familiar with the period, at many points you're not going to know what's going on, or why a certain event is significant. You'll also think the South was just winning everything with little effort.  But the film leaves out the battle of Antietam (I believe the movie crew shot it but then edited it out), thus undermining the importance of the resulting Emancipaton Proclamation when it is mentioned later in the movie.  This is just one example of its historical failings.

(3) It's TOO slow.  Despite what I said above about cutting the film some slack and letting the story slowly unwind, it goes too far in this direction and becomes too ponderous, and spends too much time on gratuitous period-piece scenes that should have been cut down or out.  It can become boring and plodding.  Combined with the lack of mention of Antietam, etc., this slowness sucks a lot of dramatic tension from the film.  Much should have been cut and repackaged.  It isn't the length that hurts it as much as its slow pace and lack of dramatic tension.

(4) It's too reverential of characters like Jackson and Lee.  With some exceptions (like Jackson's relationship with his wife), the characters are robbed of depth and seem more like moving artwork than real people.  ""Gettysburg"" was much better in this respect, much better.

(5) The musical score is lacking.  It begins with a beautiful Celtic-syle ballad that brings tears to your eyes, a perfect set up for a reoccurring musical motif.  But you never hear it again!  Instead you get some very dour and downbeat overlays.  A real disappointment after the musical tour-de-force of the ""Gettysburg"" soundtrack.

1887146,3,B00009OOFB,"As review #647, I wish to point out that this handsome film is not as bad as some of the reviews indicate, but it is not as great as Gettysburg either.

(1) Martin Sheen projects Robert E. Lee (in Gettysburg) much more effectively as an aristocratic Southern gentleman than Robert Duvall does in this picture.  Duvall is a great actor, but more suitable for workingman roles.

(2) Whatever the other causes for secession, the fact that it happened right after Lincoln's election and also John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry in 1859 shows that slavery was a primary motivating force.  The South was afraid that the North was aiming to free the slaves.  It turned out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, since Lincoln's main goal was to preserve the Union, but that is another story.

There is nothing wrong with presenting the Southern point of view, if that is what this movie is supposed to do.  You don't have to believe everything you see in movies, and ""balanced"" movies can get rather bland too.",1120435200,,998,4.7011494252873565

1887148,2,B00009OOFB,"So, Mr. Wile-e-coyote, the Civil War was all Lincoln's fault and slavery had nothing to do about it?

That Washington's first prerequisite for the Nation he helped to found at the Constitutional Convention in 1787, as he stated to a friend, was an ""indissoluble"" union doesn't sink your Federalist versus States Rights argument? There has never been a legitimately argued right to secession.

That the Fugitive Slave Act was used by the South to overide state and local laws against slavery doesn't make a lie of your statement that the South was for State's Rights against a over bearing Federal government? How about the Supreme Court's ""Dred Scott"" decision, which your hero Jeff Davis hailed as restoring the right of slavery to exist any where in the nation regardless of the desires of local citizens? The South had no compunctions in using Federal power to preserve slavery. Secession only came about when the South lost the ability through its solid block in Congress to secure its perpetuation.

Lincoln never threatened slavery in the South, another lie you and your fellow Southern revisionists have created. The Republican Party plank only sought to forbid the importation of slavery into Federal territories and the states which would arise from those territories. Nothing was ever mentioned about eliminating slavery in the South. Lincoln himself in many of his speeches before his arrival in Washington, DC stated he would not ""disturb"" slavery where it currently (1860) existed.

Secession came about from the Southern elites inflaming the passions of white people in the South over the impending social, economic and cultural doom facing them when the slaves were arbitraily liberated. Words were put into the mouths of Lincoln and others to justify this act of rebellion. Another cause was the South's inability to compromise. The Supreme Court had made slavery legal anywhere in the country, and so it would be, regardless of what the new Congress said about it. Finally, the secession was preceded by acts of mob violence, instigated and condoned by local and state authorities. This included violence against pro-Union candidates and newspapers through out the South. Federal property was being seized throughout the South without provocation. Thus Lincoln was right in calling for militia, as the Constitution gave him the power to suppress armed insurrection. He was also bound to protect the 25% of the population in the seceded states that had no desire to leave the Union. All of western Virginia eventualled seceded from Virginia, and areas of eatern Kentucky and Tennessee, wetern North carolina, northern Alabama, northern Arkansas, southern Missouri and western Texas raised troops for the Union. Keep in mind that 25% of the white Southerners who fought in the Civil War fought for the Union. As far as slavery not being the central issue, wouldn't you find it interesting that in Congressional districts in the seceded states, only those where 33% or more of the voters owned slaves went for secession. In every Congressional district in the South where the were, according to the 1860 Census, less than 5% slave owners as voters, secession was rejected. As far as Federal oppression of the South, exactly how did a Federal governement with all of 15,000 Regular soldiers and NO federal law enforcement agency exercise an oppressive rule over an area which counted over 250,000 registered militia?

And taxes and tariffs are another ""red herring"". Tariffs were placed only on imports. The country imported luxuries and finished industrial products from Europe. Those were the only items duties were charged on. And they were charged at the port of entry. Only New Orleans, of all Southern ports, ranked in the top twenty revenue collection points. Three times as much revenue was collected in the port of New York as from all Southern ports together. The tariffs involved were on British manufactured items like farm tools. This was done to protect and encourage the growth of industry in America. The South could have used this to build its own industrial sector, as it did later during the War, but was wedded to slavery and agriculture. A Southern ""dirt scrabble"" farmer was paying no more for his tools than a similar farmer in Ohio, upstate New York or Iowa. It was the Southern plantation elite that was bothered by tariffs as it forced them to pay more for the British and French luxuries. The reality of the 1860 Census and Budget was that the South received more Federal monies in construction, river, port and canal improvements, militia support and the building of coastal forts, than it paid in to the Federal government.

Slavery was and remains the central issue, and IT WAS THE SOUTH that made it so. Both Jeff Davis and Stephen Alexander, President and Vice-President Select of the Confederacy made ""keynote"" speeches to adoring crowds and newspapermen, where they re-affirmed that the purpose of secession was to creat a ""white, Christian nation"" in which the ""perpetual subordination of the black man to the white"" would be established and guarded. It should be remarked on that in 1859, Arkansas passed a law forcing all free men of color to either leave the state or be re-enslaved. Georgia in 1860 had three seperate similar bills awaiting action in the Legislature. Of the 450,000 free blacks in 1860, 360,000 lived in the South. There is absolutely no evidence to prove that any significant number of the 36,000 of so men of military age served the Confederacy as combat troops. The total number that can be confirmed by muster rosters and pension applications is less than 1,000, free or slave. Until Feb 1865, it was Confederate policy to limit blacks of any status to non-combatant roles, like teamsters and bandsmen. Compare this to the over 150,000 Southern black men, documented by muster rolls and rosters, that served in the Union army. Grant captured three seperate Confedrate armies, yet not a single black combat soldier has been identified from the parole and prisoner rosters.

It is time that the myth of the ""Glorious Cause"" under the ""Stainless Banner"" fostered by Southern revisionsists and unreconciled Rebels dies the death it deserves. The lies, mistruths and fabrications created by this faction have distorted American history for too long.",1118966400,9,6317,5.074109720885467
1887149,1,B00009OOFB,"I've given up any hope I may have ever had that there will ever be a good American Civil War based film. 'Glory' is probably about as good as I've seen, and it has plenty of flaws. Most of the efforts I've seen don't even attempt to portray participants as they really were--there's too much emotional and historical baggage to do that, so most of them do what Gods and Generals does in spades: make them all insuffereable windbags, who don't hold conversations, but only deliver overly precious sounding speeches. Add in the fact that many film makers on the subject have an agenda, which is also evident in this movie in spades, and you generally get extremely tiresome results (as in this movie....).

This is as uninteresting and unenlightening movie on an historical subject as you're likely to ever see. You'll see the famous generals brought to the screen, speechifyin', and, in general, acting nothing like real human beings, and especially not like the human beings on which the characters are based. You'll see battle scenes which match any battle scenes ever filmed for boredom. You'll learn next to nothing about why the battles actually occurred, if you didn't already know.

It is interesting, I must admit, to read some of the reviews here. It seems as if the bulk of the positive reviewers are praising the movie because of its glorified depiction of the southern cause rather than any of its film elements. Not really surprising. It's basically indefensible as a piece of entertainment. All that's left to praise is the agenda the film is pushing. Over 200 years after the events, and many still play historical revisionist.

Special effects were only fair and overall the film did not have the same quality feel as ""Saving Private Ryan"".  Yet, this film was as good or better than that one because it excelled so well in the areas mentioned above.

The battle scenes, while only being average for combat sequences, bring much more in other ways; the Irish vs. Irish battle scene being one moving example.  The portrayal of Robert E.

My biggest problem with this film, from a historical perspective, is how it skips entirely over key events.  It was interesting to see the 1st Battle of Bull Run (July '61), but then the film skips over more than a year straight on to Fredericksburg (Dec '62).  Several key events and campaigns unfolded during that time that are critical to understanding how future events transpired, and also how the characters were affected.  Yet the film ignores these events entirely.  Nothing is even mentioned about them.

Sure, skipping over historical events might anger scholars, but to the lay person the absence of these events also detracts from the flow of the entire film.  Often, things just don't make a lot of sense.

1887155,2,B00009OOFB,"They used some fine horses. These sleek, muscular beasts stood through the task of filming a 220 minute movie and looked great doing it. They whinnied, ran, jumped, bucked, fell marvelously.

As far as the movie, dissecting why it is worth only two stars is a challenge in a short space. The horses, I can say, keep it from being one star.

""Gods and Generals"" is like bad Shakespeare. Good Shakespearean actors are hard to find, since there is a tendency for everything to come off amateurish, thanks to overacting, inaccurate or overstated accents, and body language that reviles even the most staid and stuff personality.

With amazing vistas and meticulously researched and detailed sets, I expected an equal acumen when casting. After Robert Duvall and Jeff Daniels, the bar was dropped pretty far.

Apparently, the director though it was a good idea to hire Civil War reenactors. Civil War reenactors are those noble, hardworking people putting on shows of various battles. They offer a great service to the education about a tumultuous time in America. They aren't trained actors, and here, in ""Gods and Generals,"" it shows.

The reasons for the war are sugarcoated, as are the atrocities within. While Jackson and Lee may have been terrific gentlemen about the sport of war, the average soldiers were often uneducated, uncouth young men advancing the deaths of one another. Sword wounds did not drip lightly, but the war was a gory mess.

In reducing this film to PG-13, the directors did something as blandly misleading as CBS' white-bread ""Jesus."" Jesus, as Mel Gibson capably showed us with ""Passion of the Christ"", was whipped into the ground. Similarly, the Civil War had almost 1.0 million casualties. We are provided powerful battles, but somehow the directors managed to avoid the horror. Reality is skipped, and, as result, so is accuracy.

Jim, a black cook, is treated with a cliche, ""Yes'suh, whatever you say suh,"" personality. Blacks in general are glazed over as almost nonentities.

The ""gods"" part of the title, reflecting on the role of Christian faith within the war, is handled by taking a character, tossing in a Bible quote, and making it look like he had faith. Faith is more rich than that, just as the lack of faith. Atheists and Christians alike were made out to have paper-thin reasoning. This oversight in the midst of trying to make a major point indicates a church history theologian was not consulted in the making of the film.

Even the Bob Dylan song was average, and I like him. The extra-feature video of his song, ""Cross the Green Mountain,"" had some intelligent lyrics but felt too Bruce Springsteen-esque.

On the DVD is Ted Turner's introduction. He may manage a huge corporation, but he came off like a guy with almost a high school diploma. His presentation was poorly scripted, providing no real information. A historian or major actor should have tackled this one.

If you are interested in Civil War reenactments, see one live. At least then, it'll be more believable.

BUt This movie was a love song to slavery and the antebellum south. Wheras in Gettysburg, there was a wonderful balance of view points ie South V North. Every effort in this ""historically accurate"" film was made to demonize the North. Evil businessmen were responsible for the war didn't you know! The seeds of division were sown in 1771 ""All men are created equal"" (except Negros). This is why the South seceded. To perpetuate Evil. But in this movie it was evil Lincoln, evil businessmen and those rotten abolitionist from the North who casued the war. Talk about revisionism! Ols Stonewall HIREING a black man as a cook!!!! Talking to the Black man as an EQUAL about politics family and religion!! AS if!!! What a hoot!! How about the black slave guarding her precious White Owner as if she were her best friend against the rapacious North!!! The southern Irish can't understand why their Northern Brethern are fighting against them !!! Could it be that they are fighting for what Kilrain was fighting for in Gettysburg? Does Maxwell try to rewrite his won history. The north is shown to be as invaders instead of preservers of the Union and the Southerners are happy go lucky nice white folk singing and dancing about ""states rights"" when the first thing they formed was a strong Federal Government under Jefferson Davis that overuled ANY pretense of indiviual states first. This movie insulted any student of History, And if I were of African descent I would be angry at the ghastly inaccuracies of  genteel whites taken so very good care of their wards. And to focus Stonewall as a devoutly religious man with a higher moral purpose than any one else in the country just angered me. HELLO he was fighting to preserve slavery of an entire race!!!! Millions of souls!!!!  How about the GOOD people of the North? There must have been one other than Joshua Chamberlain!!! The sacrifice these men and boys. Lincoln was reviled then as much as he is revered today. What he did was to answer to a higher purpose and held to that ideal despite all.",1114128000,8,2165,4.722222222222222
1887157,2,B00009OOFB,"The movie Gettysburg was a faithful onscreen rendition of Michael Shaara's The Killer Angels.  Grant it - transferring Gods and Generals to the big screen was more of a challenge.  Gettysburg took place in three days, Gods spans years.  Having said that, there is no other way to describe this movie other than disappointing.  Here's three reasons.  First - NO ANTIETAM.  How can you depict the first half of the Civil Ware and SKIP SHARPSBURG!  Stunning omission! Second - the acting was contrived and overly dramatic.  Although Gettysburg did show signs of this, Gods went overboard.  Like a very bad made for TV movie. Third - absolute unacceptable use of computer graphics.  I want to like this movie. However, it is awkward to watch and at times downright painful. Ron Maxwell should say, ""It's all my fault!""",1113350400,5,814,4.875912408759124
1887158,4,B00009OOFB,"I rated Gods and Generals four stars because I felt it is overall a good movie. It quickly became one of my favorites, however, some parts of the movie, like the part where the mother is saying goodbye to her sons doesn't seem real. It seems to be the work of an ancient novelist.

Stephen Lang does a wonderful job portraying Gen. Jackson. It amazed me how he changed roles so beautifully from playing Gen. Pickett in Gettysburg to playin Gen. Jackson in G and G. Also, his relationship with his cook, Jim Lewis, to me showed that Jackson wasn't racist towards black people as many believe. Jim Lewis truly was a remarkable man. I can't remember the name of the man who played him, but he did a wonderful job. Jackson and Lewis showed how slavery was dying out. One way or another, the slaves were going to be freed. Many people in the south were too poor to afford slaves, and only 5% of the entire Confederate army were slaveowners.

Another part of the movie that really impressed me was the acting of Jeff Daniels in his role as Col. Joshua L. Chamberlin. The real Col. Chamberlin would be proud of the way Daniels portrayed him. I'm more a supporter of the south, however I think my favorite character was Chamberlin.

Ron Maxwell knows how to pick his actors. Kevin Conway was excellent in portraying Sgt. Buster Kilrain, and the way he showed the division of the Irishmen brought tears to my eyes. No one can imagine the pain they went through when they, as Kilrain says ""left Ireland to escape tyranny, then end up shooting at one another in the land of the free."" I know I can't imagine it.

Robert Duvall does a good job portraying the great Gen. Robert E. Lee, however I think he portrayed the role too harshly. I've done extensive research on Lee, and the way Duvall portrayed him, in my opinion, doesn't match his true character. Lee was a Christian man, and I don't think he was as harsh as Duvall portrayed him to be. In the beginning of the movie, I think he did a good job, but as the movie went on, I think his portrayal of the true Robert E. Lee as I know him faded.

Before I conclude, one part of the movie I was extremely pleased with is how it showed that the Confederate army wasn't fighting to preserve slavery, rather, it was fighting for the freedom from what it considered to be an invading foreign power.

I wouldn't recommend this movie to just anyone. You really have to love history, I think, to enjoy this movie. Gods and Generals is rather long, but the Civil War was a long war. God bless, and enjoy!",1111190400,7,2536,4.3965884861407245

(G-burg)Thomas J. Jackson, the greatest military stratigist ever is portrayed and that is probably the only reason I even bother with this Piece of trash! They make it seem as if everybody back in the 1860's knew every word in  the dictionary. Two characters will be talking using 16 letter words and they make it seem like everybody was like that. If you read most soldier's (Even Generals) letters they have poor grammar and limited vocabulary. At last count I managed to recognize a whole 278 inaccuracys! Inaccurate battle scenes plague the film, yet the worst part is the ""quotations"". There will be a dramatic conversation and then all of a sudden it will get real quiet and then the camera will zoom in on a character's face. Then they will say some universaly known quote, only to get it wrong by two words or so! (One time I remember laughing almost 20 minites non-stop!) Back to the grammar thing, characters (from private on up) quote classic literature as accuratly as the poor writers could get it yet fail to get it right. Of the 4 hours or so at least 72:32 is spent quoting the bible. It is also so very scary how seriously obsessed with the bible they make General Jackson. In the DVD extras they say: ""We wanted to make Jackson seem religious so we make him quote the bible often"" Even preachers will get annoyed at the scenes where they quote the bible sometimes for 8 minites nonstop. And it is also scary how they fit quotes from the bible (Especially the 23 psalm) in character's common dialect.

I bought it on Amazon nearly two years ago and watch it all the time--at least segments of it.  The Thomas Jackson that is presented here is the epitome of manliness and goodness and his characterization (albeit obviously a very idealistic one) embodies everything noble about our lives on this earth.  With Lee and Jackson as the book focus, it is easy to tell a story of grandeur.  These may have been the two finest southerners in history, and, to those who say that this depiction is a manipulation of history, I would counter-argue that they simply are not acquainted with history.  I read Roger Ebert's review and it was absolutely revolting.  Political correctness has no room for the truth and arguments that every picture about The Civil War must include a discussion of slavery are fallacious.  It is like insisting that ""A Bridge Too Far"" must analyze the Holocaust.  Critics like Ebert are fools and ""Gods and Generals"" is one of the few pieces of art from this century that will last and last after all the trendy charlatans who embrace cultural Marxism are long dead. From the serenity of its opening song to the beauty of its sets, this movie is an artistic triumph.

The battlefield sequences were well done and could have used more blood and graphic depictions to show how real war is.

""Gods and Generals"" could have been a much better film.",1108771200,8,729,4.4772727272727275
1887164,2,B00009OOFB,"As a Southerner, my attitude towards the Civil War has always been complex.  From the time I could first read, I have been working my way through histories of the Civil War, and works by such able scholars as Shelby Foote, Douglas Southall Freeman, and Bruce Catton were staples of my childhood.  On the one hand, I have always lamented that the South fought for such a misguided cause, and ideologically the person I have always agreed most with was Abraham Lincoln.  Nonetheless, like previous Southerners like William Faulkner and Foote, while I lament our cause (which for all the talk of states rights was really about slavery--any reading of American history from 1790 to 1860 reveals that the main right the states were trying to protect was that of keeping slavery alive, and the war itself was provoked by issues of the extension of slavery into the new territories obtained during the Polk administration), I swell with regional pride over how well soldiers fought.  We continue to honor and esteem our heroes.  My mother, for instance, grew up in Cleburne County, Arkansas, named for General Pat Cleburne, regarded by many as one of if not the finest field general the South possessed (and ironically a strong opponent of slavery, like most of the Confederate leading generals).  I'm glad we lost, but I'm also glad we lost heroically.

As a student of the Civil War, I loved the previous film based on a novel by a Schaara, GETTYSBURG, based on Michael's THE KILLER ANGELS, and was eagerly awaiting this new film by Michael's son Jeff.  But this has to be one of the most disappointing films that I have seen in my life.  I was expecting a great epic of the central historical event in American history.  What we got instead was a stuffy, stiff, and stunningly boring baggy monster of a movie.

The film gets a number of things right, but the things that it gets right could be just as easily appreciated watching a documentary of Civil War reenactors.  It gets a lot of knick-knacks right, but it does so while completely failing to find a narrative voice or presenting believable, interesting characters.

All of the major figures are presented more as talking statures, always striking poses, than real, live human beings.  While all of the central characters are guilty in this regard, but Stephen Lang's Stonewall Jackson is far and away the worse.  Without any question, Stonewall Jackson is one of the most delightful weirdoes in American history, and with George Patton one of the two most wonderfully eccentric figures in American military history.  Any of the biographies of Jackson capture this.  His narcolepsy (he fell asleep in one battle and for several hours could not be awakened, and while deeply religious, perhaps never heard a sermon all the way through, instead falling asleep every time), the oddity of his religious beliefs (he would not mail a letter that would be in the post on a Sunday, yet he loved to fight battles on the Sabbath), his hypochondria and fixation on quack remedies (Jackson would famously raise his left arm over his head and hold it there for a while to attempt to restore the balance in his body's circulation), his odd beliefs on a host of topics from pepper to his intense love of the state of New York (though dedicated to Virginia, he loved New York much the way that Sherman loved Louisiana and the South), all of these would seem to provide a world of opportunity for the writers to produce an utterly fascinating film character.  But Jackson in this film is duller than one can possible imagine.  It isn't really Lang's fault (though he does show a tendency to declaim rather than talk); it is primarily a function of the way the character is written.

Much is made of the historical accuracy of the film, but Joshua Chamberlain is elevated to the position of a major character, even though he was an almost completely unknown figure before Ken Burns's THE CIVIL WAR.  I think it is wonderful that Burns rediscovered this fascinating individual, but odd that the Schaara's give him such a central place in their narratives.  I am also uncomfortable with the way the film as a whole exonerates the South in the War.  The film wants to shift the cause of the war away from Southern secession (which might have been prevented from spreading if James Buchanan hadn't been so utterly inactive during the period of time between Lincoln's election and inauguration--it was during this time that things went badly), as if breaking the country into pieces was in any way possible (read Lincoln's Second National Address for a powerful and cogent explanation why union was not only essential but why disunion was ultimately an impossibility), to the military aggression of the North.  This is simply irresponsible history, and the filmmakers would have done well to have someone like Shelby Foote or James MacPherson to save them from such silliness.  The brute fact is that the war was fought over slavery, and no cogent historical account of the war can avoid this.  Yes, state's rights was proffered as a cause, but apart from keeping limitations on northern industrial production (which threatened to overwhelm Southern agricultural production) the only real ""right"" the South insisted upon was the right to keep slaves.  The only time they started talking at length about states rights was when it appeared that expansion into new territories would produced more non-slave states than slave-states.  This film not only produces a simplistic understanding of the cause of the war, it presents a misguided one.

These are failings of history and in the credible presentation of historical figures.  But the film completely fails both as a dramatic narrative and in producing interesting battle sequences.  The story is just wretchedly uninteresting.  The focus of the film seems to be more on generating a somber and respectful mood rather than creating anything approaching dramatic tension.  And how is it possible to produce such incredibly boring battle scenes?  It isn't just that the depictions of the battles provide absolutely no understanding of the battles themselves (I defy anyone to tell me what happened apart from Thomas J. Jackson acquiring a nickname at the first battle of Bull Run from the film's account).

The performances don't really matter in the film.  For the most part, they function merely as props.  Duvall is good as Robert E. Lee (better, in fact, than Martin Sheen in GETTYSBURG), but this isn't a film about characters so much as large tableaux, and he is always pushed to the side during the film.  Jeff Daniels does a good job as Joshua L. Chamberlain, and is probably the only major figure who manages to make his character seem like a real person.

I really can't recommend this film.  It is accurate without being historical, and as a film it lacks dramatic tension, interesting characters, or a compelling narrative.  Rarely have I anticipated a film with so much hope, only to be so completely disappointed.  I do recommend GETTYSBURG, and instead of seeing this I recommend seeing that instead.  One last complaint:  there is simply no excuse for a film to be this long.  It is very nearly this long unless it is doing a great job along the way.  It clocks in slightly under four hours, but one gets the sense at the end that nothing much happened.  If I ever do a list of the most disappointing films I have ever seen, this one would unquestionably be on the list.",1108598400,30,7465,4.837136113296617
1887165,4,B00009OOFB,"""Gods and Generals"" is a movie which sheds new light on the American Civil War.  I have read several reviews and critiques from various unhappy reviewers who seem to spend a lot of time complaining about how long and disappointing this movie was.  I think they've missed the whole point of the movie.

This movie is not an action movie and it requires a greater-than-average attention span.  But neither is it an historical documentary.  I believe this movie was created to show the human side of war and how ""close to home"" war can be. Coming from the South (my Great Grandfather fought under Jackson at Chancellorsville), I thought it was nice that this movie forces the viewer to see the war through multiple viewpoints (North, South, Slave... etc) which, in my opinion, is how a movie like this should be made.

Here are, in my opinion, the reasons that an average movie-goer (like myself) would like/dislike this movie:

Pros:  Great character development, historical accuracy (all scenes were shot on location), dramatic musical score, remarkable acting by Stephen Lang, costumes

Cons: 231 minutes long (be prepared for a long ride), some landscapes look painted",1108512000,10,1169,4.984536082474227

The flaws have been catalogued and commented on by other reviewers.  I will confine myself to saying that this depiction of Stonewall Jackson is downright bizarre.  Not eccentric.  Bizarre.  It is utterly unlike any account of the man that I have ever read.

The obvious and important thread between this movie and the vastly superior _Gettysburg_ is the inclusion of the character of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, his brother, Tom, and ""Buster"" Kilrain-- along with the 20th Maine.  This is, of course, consistent with the novel and viewers can be thankful for such a merciful distraction.

If you are to derive any enjoyment of this film at all, you will need to focus on certain scenes.

The candid talk between Chamberlain and his wife Fanny tracks with what we can know of such an intimate relationship.  It is also a showcase for Mira Sorvino who, in a few minutes, outshines virtually every other performer in this film.

The Battle of Fredericksburg is the most watchable of the three battles covered, though I do not recall ever reading of the Irish Brigade retiring in disorder after being shot to pieces on Marye's Heights.  God knows they could have, but they did not, and the film does them a disservice in depicting them as near routing off the field.

1887169,4,B00009OOFB,"Although this film has some biases and issues with it, this is a good film.  I want to  highlight some the reasons why and provide some issues that I have with it.

There are some excellent scenes in this film.  The sacrifice of the Union troops has never (and probably never will) been more memorably shown than in the charge of the Union brigades up Marye's Heights.  The charge of the Irish brigade in this battle has always been a memorable event in paintings, and books, and this movie does an excellent job of showing that.  To increase the human interest, the fact that an Irish regiment from Georgia was fighting them is provided (which is true)..., and the irony of their statements, ""don't they know that we are fighting for our freedom?"" and the fact that they are the Irish brigade troops are being duped, etc.  Well, who is being duped and really understands the cause of this war?  This is brought on a little later when a Negro lady housekeeper talks with General Hancock, the same housekeeper who helped the strong Confederate supporting family leave the home, over the wounded and dying Union soldiers, thanking him for fighting for her freedom.

There are other scenes like that, the attack of the 20th Maine, Chamberlain's regiment is handled beautifully (if something as shocking as this can be called beautiful) with very reverant music in the background right in line with the sacrifice that they were called on to make (by a stupid General - Burnside, I might add).

Well, now for the negatives: the movie does lean too much to the south - playing General Jackson as this demi-god, although giving some time to his eccentricities.  At the end, when time was spent and spent at his death bed, I found that I couldn't finish watching this.  OK, he was a great general, but... And, all the scenes of the Confederate army and their parties and other events.

Yet, all in all, this is a good movie.  Another highlight is the start of the movie which shows Union and Confederate flags flowing while a beautifully sung song is in the background.  It showed good taste for the start of a good movie.",1106438400,3,2114,4.630026809651475

Lee's surprising views on slavery would have been interesting if they could have been plausibly woven into the story. A more detailed developing of the reasons for Virginia's desire to leave the Union would have greatly added to this film's subtance. Some of those beards looked a bit fake, but hey, I had friends who looked like that back in the seventies! I disagree with those who found the battle scenes  lacking. What's needed? More splatter?

Having done quite a bit of research into the Civil War, I've found that this video is surprisingly accurate, and that Robert Duvall played a much more authentic General Lee than did Martin Sheen.

The result is a movie that is not only entertaining but a lesson of life too.

1887175,2,B00009OOFB,"Ok, obviously we have a lot of folks who still aren't over the fact that the South lost the Civil War.  Being a big (and unbiased) Civil War buff, I have to say this was one disappointing experience.  In a nutshell, this movie has enough fake beards, bad accents, and biblical cliches to last a lifetime.  It is amazing that, despite the lengthy running time (3 hours and 45 min!!) and the meticulous attention to detail, I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters in this film.  I believe that's because all the characters were portrayed in ridiculous proportions.  The actors delivered their lines as if they were all reciting the declaration of independence.  Everything is overdone, the acting is melodramatic, and the dialogue is both cheesy and predictable.

Another problem with this film is the fact that Maxwell can't decide if he's making a dramatic film about the Civil War (ala Glory) or making a Ken Burns type documentary, or a History Channel renactment.  I also was surprised that given the number of reenactors involved (somewhere in the ballpark of 7-thousand or so)...the battles all felt very bland.  Fredericksburg was one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War, and yet it seemed less people died there than in the (smaller) siege of Ft. Wagner that was portrayed in the end of Glory.  In this case...the reenactors worked against Maxwell's favor.  Their marches (which Maxwell showed at great length...which prolonged the sense of boredom in the film) were still and lacked the intensity of men who were marching to their doom.  Here, it seemed many were so into the fact they were in a movie, that it just seemed so stiff and unrealistic.  So much of the movie was focused on the historical accuracy of the battles...but missed the essences of these fights.  Even Gettysburg captured the sense of desperation and sacrifice in battle batter.  We spend so much time focused on senselss points (such as the exact location of the battle!!  it was fought EXACTLY here!)...that we aren't treated to an exciting action battle sequence.

Bottom line, aside from the ridiculous sympathies to slavery,  (Sorry, but Gone With the Wind captured the slave/master issue much better), everything else in this film was just mediocre.  Bad, melodramatic acting, lousy dialogue, an overuse of cheap and boring compression shots (to create an artificial sense of grandeur ... basically I can tell that there wasn't more than 7 thousand people involved in the battle, which is pretty bad given other directors (Oliver Stone, Edward Zwick, Ridley Scott) did a lot more with less human reenactors/actors) all made this film a lot worse than a lot of the reviews here say it was.

But who can blame Civil War buffs for getting overzealous with their reviews?  After all, there aren't a lot of good civil war films to choose from these days ... and I think too many civil war movie fans are setting with way too little.",1102291200,14,2934,4.85140562248996

1887179,1,B00009OOFB,"Oh man, was this movie a painstaking experience. The little dialogue that was there was poorly written and not very well acted, except fro Duvall, Daniels and Lang.  15 minutes of boring dialogue where you really didn't learn anything. 45 minutes of speeches, which didn't enhance the story.  2 hours of the same battle scenes and same shots of soldiers lined up and shooting. We get it. There is no reason to show it 30 times.  Who ever thought of making this movie 4 hours must have been out of their mind.

I didn't care about the characters and couldn't care less about either side. Mainly because they really never explained why they were fighting in deatils. Just a few boring speeches with no substance.  Clearly the war was not about slavery and they should have explained more about the real reason for the civil war. They should also have shown more blacks fighting for the confederate army.

If you want a GREAT historic movie of American history rent The Patriot and/or Glory. Much better battle scenes, acting story and action. This movie is essentially a mediocre TNT mini series, but not for the big screen.  Overall just absolutely terrible writing and I am not sure for the people that gave it good reviews what they were watching.  Just way too predictable.  However, if you suffer from insomnia rent this movie and you will sleep like a baby.

1887180,4,B00009OOFB,"I watched Gods and Generals last night; right after (also finally) watching Babylon 5's ""the Gathering"" movie (bleh). Out of the two, Gs&Gs is far better. (Sort of like comparing apples and turnips, I know: but ""Firefly"" has spoiled me: I can hardly stand the sight of rubber-masked aliens anymore.)

I agree with those who have said Gs&Gs is a good movie; not great but good. It greatly simplifed the book, and I agree that some added battle material and a little less *preachy* dialogue would have been a wise move.

But what we have is a very good depiction of the feelings (especially the Confederate view) of the participants at the time. It wasn't some Hollywood (politically correct) rewrite of history. The war really did start over Lincoln's refusal to allow secession, and the slave issue only came to the front well into the war. Feelings over slavery on both sides were anything but cut and dried.

The religious characters of Stonewall, et al, are perfectly in line with reality (though I admit this aspect might be slightly exaggerated at the expense of other character *quirks*).

And I think the battle scenes are horrific enough. This is not an antiwar movie so we did not need greater realism (like with ""Saving Private Ryan""): it is a story about understanding the attitudes, views and feelings of the nation, through the medium of the main historical characters (the book brings this out very well), and I think the movie succeeds adequately in this.

""Gettysburg"" has been a favorite movie for years. After all the negative tripe I have listened to about ""Gods and Generals"", I was expecting a piece of poorly made trash. It is anything but: and now I look forward to the completion of the *trilogy*, with ""Last Full Measure.""",1101340800,7,1747,4.790697674418604

1887182,4,B00009OOFB,"I was with the core group  ,a soldier in the film. The movie is accurate down to the buttons on the uniforms. I agree that the more you know about the Civil War the more you will like this film.

 The movie is a bit long for theater goers,but those who saw it at the theater,let out a collective gasp when they saw 7000 Union dead at Fredericksburg.

 There is still a stigmatism attached to the Confederate viewpoint. The film tries to show there were causes for the war,and slavery wasn't the main concern for Southerners. It was a war over states rights.

  Actor Stephen Lang plays Stonewall Jackson,and everyone needs to see this film if just to see his performance.

  The public wants to be entertained. Historians like to learn about history as it really happened. The film is about the first two years of the War Between the States,when the Confederates routed the Union troops,while being outnumbered at nearly every battle.

1887183,2,B00009OOFB,"Whereas ""Gettysburg"" gives a more balanced perspective (abeit a bit pro-North) on the American Civil War, ""Gods and Generals"" goes WAY over the top in romanticizing the Southern ideology and gives a rather coyish treatment of slavery.  Maybe the slavery issue is an over-exaggerated cause of the Civil War, but it was nonetheless a major question before and during the War that deserves far more attention in ""Gods and Generals"" than it actually got.  Don't expect to see any black slave being flogged in this movie because such a scene would shake up that indefatigable Southern pride which this film tries so hard to depict.  There is nothing wrong with a little patriotism and every nation has a right to self-determination, but glossing over an unjustifiable social evil such as slavery in this day and age?  What was Maxwell thinking?  You don't have to be politically correct to agree that the South had deprived itself of potential(and needed) French and British support by not keeping up with the times.  As a Canadian, I could tell you that Mother England and loyalist Canada at that time would have loved to see the United States divided in two and show that the American Revolution was a mistake.  (It was the survival of the American Union that prompted the Canadian colonies to form their own pro-British union in 1867.)

Politics aside, this movie is simply downright slow and boring.  It seems like half the movie is essentially a biographical story of ""Stonewall"" Jackson.  As a military history buff, I admire ""Stonewall"" for his unique piety.  However, in this 21st Century age of minimal attention spans, do we really need to hear him speak out his ENTIRE pre-battle prayer?  Do we really need to hear him sing ""Silent Night"" in its ENTIRETY?

Yet, the worse sin of all is the way this choppy movie mindlessly omits important episodes occurring between the firing at Fort Sumter and the start of Gettysburg.  WHERE IN GOD'S NAME IS THE BATTLE OF ANTIETAM????  WHERE IS GENERAL McCLELLAN???  You would think that a movie lasting close to 4 hours could squeeze these important Civil War elements in somewhere, but instead a lot of screentime is wasted on scenes of Southern genteel domesticity (like ""Stonewall"" developing a father-like love for a little girl who admires the General) that are best described as ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.

Watch ""Gettysburg"" for a good military focus on the Civil War, and watch ""North and South: Book Two"" for a good civilian focus.",1100908800,14,2484,4.9326923076923075
1887184,5,B00009OOFB,"I think that one of the reasons this movie was panned by reviewers as too pro-Southern was the common inability of modern persons to transport themselves back to the time being portrayed.  It is difficult for many ""moderns"" to grasp how men of faith and principal could fight and die for a society that had slavery as one of its indisputable pillars.  I serve in a Civil War reenacting unit based on rural South Carolina and I can attest that not one of our men thinks that slavery was a good thing or that Blacks are inferior to Whites - and we are comprised of a cross section of Southern society: lawyers, truck drivers, accountants, doctors, copy machine repairmen, and the like.  But, and this is the point, none of these men would hesitate to take up arms today if their values and way of life were threatened.  ""Gods and Generals"" does a superb job of portraying this Southern mentality as it existed in 1861 and still exists today.

1887185,4,B00009OOFB,"Being a Civil War enthusiast myself, I have read the other reviews with interest. They cover the entire spectrum from outstanding to abysmal. Well, I guess you'll just have to watch it and judge for yourself.

This was a film which centered on Thomas (Stonewall) Jackson. It was long and had many slow moving parts to it. It did try to cover (too much?) roughly a third of the war. And yes, it did leave out some of the momentous battles of the first couple of years of the conflict.

Still, unless the makers were to intend having almost a serial, it would be hard to include all the battles without making the movie inpossible to watch in a sitting or two.

The film, as you've probably read, hits on first Manassas (Bull Run), first Fredricksburg (yes, there were two of those also) and Chancellorsville. It gives one a depth of insight into the charactor of Gen Jackson and his outlook on the war. For those of us who delve into the war, it shows the slaughter at Fredricksburg thru the blunder and stubborness of Gen Burnsides, and the overwhelming Confederate victory at Chancellorsville (probably Lee's greatest victory).

The acting IS good and the human element runs throughout the film making this more than just a documentary.

As to a recommendation, I'd say that if you are a student of the war, you will probably enjoy the film in spite of the faults it has. If you're looking for just a night's entertainment and don't really know much about the American Civil War, you'll probably want to watch something else.

Just an afterthought to the producers. Why hasn't anyone done a movie of this sort on the events leading to and culminating in the shelling of Ft Sumter?",1100304000,8,1681,4.624161073825503
1887186,1,B00009OOFB,"This might be one of the worst movies ever made, right up there with Exorcist II the Heretic.

Where do u start with all the suck in this film? Well lets start with the poor acting (except Duvall). Absolutely D-grade acting worse than what you expect for TV sitcom.

Then there is the script. Every cliche war scene ever -- the sad son leaving kin-folk behind... The joke of the scene between Stonewall and his slave, showing how Stonewall really thinks that all men are equal...

Then there is the ""recitation of song."" They want to sing a song in this movie... and then they sing it -- IN ITS ENTIRETY -- while we sit in the audience like a guest in the room listening to the whole song. Boring if I was there... WORSE than boring when in movie audience. And then, as if the first song wasn't enough, they sing ANOTHER song... Or when, they read from the Bible -- the ENTIRE passage. I'm not against the Bible at all, just having 6 pages of ANY text read to me straight in a film. Not good film-making.

And then there are the ""battle scenes."" Weak CGI. The scale of the fighting didn't look epic -- Heck the end scene in Glory was more impressive. And how does this director attempt to show thousands of troops leaving a tree-line in a single charge? Would he use the EXACT same footage three times in a row? Um, yes he did... Oh, and about those troops... Yep they were wearing the correct uniforms, but  gosh those 260 lb. reanacters look great chugging along (those rebs sure ate well I guess) -- and while they tried hard, they're not actors and it shows in many of the ""combat scenes"" with fights choreographed as well as 7-year olds playing cowboys and indians.

This is bad filmmaking, plain and simple. I'm an avid military history buff who craves accuracy in my war films. However, I also want to see good film making. I have no beef with the ""southern perspective."" Hell, I cheered the Germans in Das Boot. But I'll call a bad film what it is, and no amount of historical accuracy can save it. Want super accuracy and great story line? See the Finnish film ""the Winter War..."" you'll never see a BA-10 on film anywhere else and yet the art of filmmaking didn't get lost in the shuffle. Want a huge epic of 7 hours with civillian interest and the biggest battles? See Sergei Bandarchuck's ""War and Peace"" it never loses its sense of film artistry.  But don't tell me I don't like  ""Gods and Generals"" because of my limited knowledge of history.  This film just sucks :P",1099267200,8,2481,4.411378555798687

I think this movie will be enjoyed maily by history buffs, but I think there is room for the causal student of the civil war. The movie is not overly Hollywood in its delivery.

1887188,2,B00009OOFB,"As a life-long student of the Civil War, I wanted and expected to like this movie. Yet when it screened at a local theater, I found it so boring that I left the theater at the intermission. This week, I picked it up on DVD at my library to give it a second chance, and this time, I managed to watch all the way through. Unfortunately, my original opinion of it was only verified. Its problems are legion, but its greatest sin is that it was unable to infuse any passion or drama into the single most passionate and dramatic chapter of American history.
There are three major battle scenes in the movie - First Manassas (Bull Run), Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville. These scenes are long; a significant section of the movie, yet they are so totally lacking in realism and emotional believability that I was never able to suspend disbelief and imagine that I was viewing real combat. Instead, they never appeared as anything other than what they were - pageants put on by re-enactors, who obviously enjoy what they do, but lack the acting skill to deliver the necessary emotional realism, and lack the budget to deliver anything close to the physical reality of battle. (With the exception of a few cannon hit shots, most of the casualties of battle look no more realistic than kid's games of war where they simply drop to the ground to play dead when shot.) The movie's orchestral score played almost constantly behind the battle scenes, further removing them from any semblance of actuality. The post-battle hospital scenes also lacked anything approaching realism. Here, instead of showing the chaotic, hellish cauldrons of screams and carnage, the movie gave us only quite, almost orderly scenes where speeches could be delivered over the dead and dying.
Had the rest of the movie been engaging in any way, I might have been able to forgive the unrealistic, non-believable battle scenes. It, however, failed on all counts. There is almost no real dialogue in this movie. Instead, the actors deliver speeches to each other, like lines memorized for a Passion play. Scenes that should have been electric with passion, such as when the students at Virginia Military Institute struck the Stars and Stripes to raise the Stars and Bars, and when the Virginia Council called for leaving the Union never appear to be more than play-acting, and lack any sense of realism or true passion. At no point did I feel that this movie pulled me into its reality - it always left me feeling that I was watching a second-rate play.
The acting ranged from understated, to bad, to non-existent. Robert Duvall played Robert E. Lee as the ""marble man"", restrained and reserved. This may have worked if he had been surrounded with other, more animated actors. He was not, and as such, delivered the only performance of a great career that I found boring. Jeff Daniels was considerably less effective in his reprised role of Joshua Chamberlain than he was in the movie Gettysburg. Indeed, considering that the bulk of the movie was delivered from a Southern perspective, it would probably have been stronger if the character of Chamberlain and the small amount of screen time given to the Union point of view had been eliminated all-together. Stephen Lang's Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson actually had a few moments of passion, and if not limited by a stilted script, might have been able to deliver a fine performance. As it was, much of his screen time sank to the level of the rest of the movie. The actor who played the dashing cavalier J.E.B. Stuart was almost totally lacking in verve, dash or flamboyance, and the man who played the gallant, young General Sam Hood, a man barely past 30 years old, appeared to be in his late 50s. No other roles even rise to be worthy of mention.
The two stars that I do give this movie are because of its general historical accuracy, both in its portrayal of events, and its look and feel. Also, the story line of Thomas Jackson showed promise that while unfulfilled, was a worthy attempt to capture the totality of an enigmatic and complex man. (It may have been a better movie had it concentrated wholly on Jackson's story, rather than trying for a broader sweep.)
This movie was too long, too stilted, and too poorly cast and acted. It never managed to engage the viewer in its reality, or rise above the level of a particularly complex re-enactment. It was a tremendous disappointment, and I cannot recommend it on any level.

1887189,2,B00009OOFB,"This movie has to hold the record for the worst fake beards ever.  The fake facial hair is so bad that it is very distracting.  The beards look just horrible on all the stars.  The facial hair is fine on the extras in the film, but that is probably because it is real.

The other problem is that the acting is so wooden.  The actors speak emotional lines, but show no emotion in doing so.  Are we to believe that all the high ranking officers were such boring people?  No, these were very colorful people.

For an epic movie, the cinematography is bland.  It looks like a TV movie.

With the bad make up, wooden acting and boring visuals, it is very difficult to get into this movie.  It starts out with many religious tinged monologs that are just not engaging.  If there were some fire put behind the sermons, this might be a great concept:  how the religious beliefs impact the military leaders.

This is supposed to be a historically accurate film.  It is only historically accurate in terms of who the people are and what happened at the battles.  It is not accurate in what the social climate was at that time.  Not all slaves loved their masters.

The battle scenes almost save this movie.  These scenes plus the scenes leading directly up to the battle are very intricate and make you feel like you are there.  Like the rest of movie, the battle scenes seem like they go on for ever.  You could complain that the are stretched out to long and repititious.

1887190,5,B00009OOFB,"Gods and Generals is a superb follow-up to the magnificent Gettysburg - a second instalment of top-quality storytelling, gripping drama, breathtaking action sequences and haircuts that defy the imagination. This time we go back to the tumultuous opening days of the conflict.  The action spans three separate engagements - Chancellorsville, Fredericksburg and Bull Run- from all of which the confederate forces under General Robert E- Lee emerge triumphant. Robert Duvall fills Martin Sheen's shoes as Robert E. Lee for this movie and is, I feel, better cast. Facial hair enthusiasts will also have a field day- more strange moustaches and beards than you can wave a stick at - with Tom Berenger winning the Most Ridiculous Beard in a Civil War Movie award hands-down (with Jeff Daniels's handlebar moustache in the first Gettysburg movie coming in a close second) .

I find myself at odds with many of the reviewers below who have dismissed Gods and Generals totally. Well I've seen this movie a couple of times now and I've seen nothing that justifies the mangling this film has received below. The music, for instance, is superb - defintely a notch up from the synthy washes we had to endure in Gettysburg. But it is, exactly like Gettysburg a beautifully made, lovingly crafted Civil War movie that is highly educational too boot. It created a whole new genre with art nestling comfortably alongside education.  Gods and Generals is not just a great movie, but a major cinematic endeavour.",1096156800,8,1721,5.099290780141844
1887191,3,B00009OOFB,"This epic film is the first in a trilogy of Civil War re-enactments and tells the story of events that took place in Virginia and West Virginia during 1861-1863.

I was very impressed with this film and the seeming accuracy with which the filmmakers stayed true. While I am shamefully unaware of all of the complex history that took place during the Civil War I imagine most of this film to be a just depiction of the history books. The film is very long and almost impossible to get through in one sitting unless you are a Civil War fanatic. Many of the scenes are devastating and bring to life the horrible reality of what real war was all about. These men, and sadly many boys, went to battle with nothing more than their own feet, woolen coats for armor and felt hats as helmets with their hearts as their only shield. Just watching the effort it took to fire one shot and then to re-load and hope to not get hit by fire in return was shear torture to observe. Life is just much easier all the way around for Americans these days. This film is powerful, inspiring and extremely sad all at the same time. But it is after all how America came to be and shows the integrity with which our Nation was created.

While I found myself being disappointed at times with the endless stream of unknown actors who graced the screen and the often comical mis-glued beard, I did enjoy a few of the noted performances. The always brilliant Robert Duvall portrays Gen. Robert E. Lee with a quiet extremely conservative conviction. Duvall masters dignity in this role and enforces the greatness of Gen. Lee. Beside Duvall, portraying the great ""Stonewall"" Jackson is Stephen Lang. Lang is absolutely superb as Jackson and showed him to be a faithful servant of the Confederate campaign. Lang has touching scenes with a young child he befriends on Xmas day and during his breakdown on the field once he learns of her demise. I have to say that for the majority of this film I was rooting for the Southern Confederates because of their extreme integrity and awesome faith in something higher than themselves, but then I remembered my history lessons and realized they were for slavery ( an idea I abhor!) so I switched sides....yes, I flip-flopped!!

This movie is epic in proportion using a cast of thousands of extras to fight in the battle scenes. My only complaint is that sometimes some of the scenery and little details come across a little on the cheesy side but then it would be impossible to be perfect on such an extraordinary historical set with so many people to tend to. I felt as though the film was pretty one-sided with the emphasis on integrity and faith resting with the South and the Northerners being the sneaky, stealing side resting their laurels on the faith of old Roman soldiers rather than a true God. Slavery had to end for democracy to continue so all of the good ole Southern faith and glory couldn't be as wonderful as this film tends to portray. But an important aside stems from such a film, it makes you want to learn more about American history and how we came to be. It seems a country built from such hardship, strength and honor would remain planted in roots sown so bravely but divided we begin to stand once again. Hopefully our new generals find faith in some of what the old ones left behind, not in history books but in every American heart.",1094515200,2,3368,4.536184210526316

1887193,5,B00009OOFB,"Into the dark, dark world of political correctness and historical revisionism explodes this radiant masterpiece. The ""its too loooong"" whine says more about our pathetic attention spans than it does about the film. 19th century Americans were different. They were sentimental,romantic and devoutly religious. They counted many things more valuable than their own lives.

  First of all, this is so much better that ""Gettysburg"" (which was really a B movie) that any comparisons to the contrary leave me wondering if there is ANOTHER Gettysburg out there I have not seen. The acting from Duval's Lee to Lang's Jackson is riveting. The painstaking attention to historical detail and overall cinematic skill makes this feel more like time travel than a movie.

  What really infuriates the critics is the complete and total destruction of the anti-South construct that has been so emphatically propounded all these years. The South saw this as it was, another war of independence. The Republicans did not set out to abolish slavery, Congress affirmed the goal of the war in 1862 (by resolution) was to ""preserve the union, not free the slave"". Even a cursory study of the Emancipation Proclamation reveals it freed no one. A post mortem which includes a census review indicated 95% of the slaves were owned by just 5% of the population and 30% of free blacks living in the south were themselves slave owners.

  Unfortunately this film was so savaged by the so-called open-minded and tolerant that it was DOA when it arrived in the movie houses. A shame. Together with ""To Ride With the Devil"", (an Ang Lee film about the border war) these films could introduce Americans to the most significant chapter of their own history with real history. Other than one comment made by Jackson (concerning ""the Institute"") just before the climatic charge at Chancellorsville this film is a dead ringer. It is time travel. Ignore everything you have ever heard, open your mind to  brand new experience, give yourself a few hours to experience this and absorb it at its own pace. If you can do this Gods and Generals will permit you to actually visit the American Civil War.",1092700800,6,2158,4.9529085872576175

The only semi-redeeming quality of this movie is that it is very historically accurate,but that doesn't make a movie good...and did I mention it was long?When I saw it at the theater(only God knows why) they had an intermission in the middle of the movie...a f*#@ing intermission!!!!!What the hell?I thought only plays had intermissions. So all in all please do not see this movie unless you're a civil war buff or are interested in american history...but for entertainment purposes. Oh,and just because I say this movie is too long DOESN'T mean I have a short attention span...nothing captured my attention throughout the movie,it was just slow,plodding,and lethargic in it's presentation.

If the film has a fault, it's the effort to portray the humanity, which sometimes becomes a bit boring and bogs down in places. The performances are excellent, and the dialogue, although decried by some critics (who obviously don't realize these are DIRECT QUOTES), is authentic and gives us insight into the motivations of the men who fought - and the truth that for the majority of the soldiers, the cause wasn't slavery. Could have been better; impossible not to give an accurate portrayal of the war by leaving out the carnage of Sharpsburg/Antietam. Still, should be required viewing for any serious student of the War and the period.",1092009600,4,716,4.736
1887196,5,B00009OOFB,"I was terribly disappointed with Martin Sheen's portrayal of Roberyt E. Lee in Gettysburg. Sheen - whether by his own design or by Ted Turner's - made Lee look indecisive, too reliant on J.E.B. Stuart (and Sheen portrayed Lee as confused and near-clueless due to Stuart's absence in the fiorst two days of Gettysburg, when Lee did have Cavalry under his Nephew, Gedneral Fitzhugh Lee, who as as able a commander as Stuart), and basically hopelss in the face of the coming battle. In Gods and Gernerals, Robert Duvall made General Lee look like the man he was: capable, decisive, able, and brilliant. After watching this classic, I am convinced that the way Duvall portrayed Lee is exactly how the man was! My breath was taken away by Duvall's portrayal of General Lee! This movie - along with ""Open Range"", ""Lonesome Dove"", and ""Secondhand Lions"" has made me into a huge Duvall fan! His portrayal of Lee, as well, showed the General as he was in his Christian Faith: a man who led, but was also led by a Greater Leader.

 Stephen Lang, as well, did an awesome job portraying Thomas Jonathanm ""Stonewall"" Jackson. Many times in this day and age, people who are died-out-to-Christ Christians are often protrayed as brainwashed, crazy, Pharisaical, prudish, and/or out-of-touch with reality. This has been done in some history books when describing and covedring General Jackson. Lang's portrayal of Jackson was as down-to-earth and real as Duvall's portrayal of Lee was, and Lang made Jackson look like a real person, who - though he had an intense faith and high belief in Jesus Christ -didn'tg leave his brain and personality at the door, as Hollywood has done to prior and later charachters who professed some kind of faith in Jesus Christ. As with Pickett in ""Gettysburg"", Lang went over-the-top with this rendition of General Stonewall Jackson, and showed him to be a real man of living, breathing flesh, but also a down-to-earth believer of Jesus Christ, and a man who was comitted to doing what was right.

 Finally, Jeff Daniels' portrayal of Joshua Chamberlain was, again, well-done. As in gettysburg, Daniels showed us the real side of a man who is only known of from History. As with lang and Duvall, Daniels made Chamberlain come to life in a way rarely seen. Mira Sorvino, as well, portraying Mrs. Joshua Chamberlain, did a great job, though her part was brief.

 This movie is a great improvement over Gettysburg, and if the third installment of this trilogy again uses Duvall, Lang, and Daniels, I'll be on the front row watching the whole thing!",1091577600,3,2559,4.844393592677346

1887198,2,B00009OOFB,"Gods and Generals is a film focusing on General ""Stonewall"" Jackson (Stephen Lang) and his accomplishments during the Civil War, which is heavily influenced by his strong Christian belief. General Jackson is often making speeches to encourage his soldiers to fight and he justifies it with Gods gospel as he believes that he is protecting his home from the Northern invaders. There are also other characters that occasionally give different views such as Lt. Col. Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels) who gives a speech about why the war is worth fighting for as well as General Robert E. Lee (Robert Duvall) who refused leading the Northern forces into his home state Virginia.

 The epic cinematic experience that Gods and Generals offers is profoundly affected by its script, speeches, acting, direction, music, and mise-en-scene. The characters seem as rigid as statues with hidden tape recorders that gives dry history lectures in the form of speeches. The only character that seems somewhat real is Robert Duvalls character, Robert E. Lee, as he seems to be alive. The distant shots of Fredericksburg are not convincing as they look miniature-like and the battle fields are bloodless, which evokes a false sense of heroism amidst the horror of war. Francis Ford Coppola could use Die Walk?re by Richard Wagner in Apocalypse Now, but is does not function with the same effect here as with grandeur music as the soldiers fall like domino bricks on both sides. In the end, Gods and Generals offers an awkward cinematic experience that is difficult to watch as it is well over three hours long.",1090281600,7,1586,5.026615969581749
1887199,1,B00009OOFB,"Glory was a great civil war film, it had characters with character, it had a story with a story, it had a believable premise. But, this movie I don't know what this movie was all about. The acting was like a cross between stage acting and politicians trying to act emotional about their causes on a debate stage. And to have it centered in the 19th Century south in this format is like having the cast of the Andy Griffith Show deliver their lines with Shakespearean drama, it just doesn't work. I really don't think General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson would be proud to be remember for his endless droning philosophy on lemonade.
This movie has been playing endlessly on cable for the last few months, and I admit I keep getting drawn into watching it, and if you turn the sound down it's not so bad as a silent movie, but the dialog is, well it's what it is. I could care less about the message personally. The facts about the motivation of the Confederacy are so muddled due to southern pride and political correctness I really don't expect a movie to portray them accurately.
Glory did at least make an effort not to sugar coat the reality of the time to a degree. You can't be politically correct about a time that just plain wasn't politically correct, and unfortunately in the times we live in this means that our history is being rewritten all around to either exaggerate the ""bad"" guys or glorify the ""good"" guys in whatever perspective the author seems to think those ""guys"" are. The simple fact is that 19th century America was a terribly racially divided place and it went much further than skin color and the South.
I guess I keep watching it trying to figure out how someone could bankroll so much effort in costuming and location shoots and battle scenes and all and wonder if they actually watched it before they released it. Does the director of this movie actually have conversations like this? I think the real problem with this movie is that it tries to hard to be politically correct, and that the Author, the Director, the Producer, the Editor, or someone feels that you can't portray the glorious careers of men who don't fit into the political correctness mold of the modern day. This is a serious disservice to historical fact.",1089417600,6,2251,4.601990049751244
1887200,4,B00009OOFB,"I like to study history, and the civil war is one of my favorite points in American History.  Mainly because it was so controversial, the reasons, the bad guys, the death toll, etc.....  It was one of the bloodiest battles in our history, not because both sides were american, but because of the percentage of dead per battle, sometimes reaching 30%.

I do believe that the South got a raw deal for a long time.  They weren't blameless, but they also weren't the evil group of racists that were potrayed.  Plus this delves into the fact that the war wasn't about slavery until the later stages, something the North didn't even want.  But that is all up for debate in another forum.

This movie is well filmed, the characters feel more three dimensional and close to their real life counterparts, and the recreation of some of the battles are done in an almost loving fashion done by those who spend their pasttime recreating major events.  It shows two major early battles where the confederacy won stunning victories causing heavy losses for the Union.  This movie also goes to great links humanizing both sides of the conflict.  They try to show that the soldiers on both sides are people, that don't like having to go to war, but believe in their respective causes enough to do so.

The main characters of the movie, Robert E Lee, and General ""Stonewall"" Jackson, are accurately portrayed, and well casted.  Jackson looking almost identical to his potraits, with a scary intensity in his eyes.  Robert Duvall is in classic form, playing a cautious and calculating Robert E Lee.

On the side of the Union is Jeff Daniels as Lt Col Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and Kevin Conway as Sgt Buster Kilrain.  A pair of men that make it obvious that they would rather be at home with family than battling this war, but answer to duty.  You sympathize with them when they are put into poorly planned millitary engagements likely to their death.

The main complaint from people who like this movie was that it left a lot out, there were a lot of smaller battles that where, but it would have added another 2 hours easily to the already 4 hour movie.  Maybe we can hope for a special edition some day.

This movie is very pro southern, so if your views tend to favor the union, this is probably not for you.  If you don't love history or recreations of battles, especially ones using Napoleonic Tactics and weapons, it probably also is not for you.  It is like marzipan, not a lot of people like it, but those that do, love it.",1089158400,4,2516,4.571428571428571

The movie is way too pro-southern and by taking out most of the Winfield Hancock parts of the book from the movie, the Union perspective is left out until Chamberlain arrives.  The battles are indeed accurate and well done, but overall this movie lacks the emotional punch of Gettysburg and is not really all that accurate in describing the moods of the north.  This limits the ability of the movie to provide an accurate look at the Civil War.  Plus, the fact that several key battles were filmed yet never show up in the DVD release earns this movie a 3 star rating.  If you want a movie on the Civil War watch Gettysburg.",1088985600,5,726,4.553846153846154
1887202,1,B00009OOFB,"The swelling music that accompanies every battle scene - and every preparation-for-battle scene - and a lot of other scenes too - put me in mind of a big budget 1940s musical.  So I couldn't help but be disappointed when the promised dance-and-song number never materialized.  Or maybe it did toward the end; I walked out after about an hour and a half, a first for me.
Gods and Generals suffers from a ridiculously selective view of history, betraying a virulent political bias.  But this would be forgivable, if the movie succeeded as entertainment; it does not.  The aforementioned over-the-top music, along with poor editing, stilted dialogue, and caricature accents, conspire to make it basically unwatchable.  The language, in particular, is the most surprising disappointment.  There was a great opportunity here to portray a rich spoken Civil War vernacular.  Unfortunately, someone decided to have the characters speak as if they were reading proclamations all the time.  It actually might even have succeeded, had they taken it further in that direction, into (say) completely stylized rhyming couplets.  But alas, it was not to be.
This movie has to be the greatest waste of resources and human ingenuity since, well, the Civil War itself.  If you want to spend four hours watching Civil War battles, give Gods and Generals a pass, and instead get ahold of some camcorder footage of one of the many excellent amateur re-enactment societies.",1088726400,16,1451,5.110169491525424

Ultimately, the best feature was seeing the authentic weaponry and uniforms the soldiers used.
The camera work was either distantly fake or staged close-up.  Nothing flowed, nothing drew me in, it just happened as I casually observed.  The acting of some was plain horrible.

A reviewer on IMDB pointed out that despite being absolutely stunning to look at, the battle scenes are strangely boring and I have to echo this comment.

1887206,1,B00009OOFB,"This wonderful film did away with the following misconceptions I had about the civil war(among others):
1. Slaves disliked both slave masters and slavery as a whole.
2. Southerner confederates were pro-slavery.
3. The civil war was, at its roots, perpetuated by the Southern states' desire to maintain slavery as an institution.
I had it all wrong. I now know that slaves were perfectly happy with their enslavement, so much so that even when they were freed they still stuck around to fight for their former slave-masters' rights to own slaves. I am a little confused as to how slavery existed at the time despite virtually all southerners objecting to it (even the Confederate leaders themselves, which really baffles me). No, this war was for states' rights! To do what I can only guess, but certainly not to enslave blacks, since no confederates had any interest in doing so.
Enough of the sarcasm. The point is that just because this movie is presented from some other viewpoint besides that of the ""liberal hollywood revisionist elite"", DOESN'T mean you God-fearin' simple-folk need to take it as fact. Sure, I can have an open mind - I can envision a white confederate, with a black man at his side (on a rare, paradoxical occasion or two) praying TO END SLAVERY. But the fact is that the confederates wanted slavery so bad, wanted to dehumanize blacks so bad that they chose to die for it. The confederate cause was wrong and dispicable, as were all those who tried to propagate it. Few times has a movie so enraged me - and I loved ""Gettysburg"".",1086134400,17,1554,4.7380073800738005
1887207,4,B00009OOFB,"Given the mostly negative reviews that this film has received on Amazon, I can only conclude that it appeals exclusively to history buffs. And indeed, if you're not interested in the U.S. Civil War or American history in general, there's probably not much of interest for you in this film. But if you are, you'll be pleased to know that in terms of historical drama, it is a quite remarkable document. It was produced by the same team that made the 1993 film ""Gettysburg,"" and indeed ""Gods & Generals"" is billed as the first part of a trilogy of which ""Gettysburg"" is the second part. However, apart from the fact that a few of the same actors play identical roles in both films, there is very little similarity between them in either style or substance. ""Gettysburg"" focused exclusively on a time period of four days and a single battle, while ""Gods & Generals"" attempts to cover more than two years of history in the same amount of running time. Also, ""Gettysburg"" went for intensive, realistic depiction of combat, while ""Gods & Generals"" instead consists primarily of melodrama. And rather than the war itself being the focus, as was the case in ""Gettysburg,"" in ""Gods & Generals,"" the life of General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson is the point of focus for the surrounding action. Only three battles are featured: the First Battle of Bull Run/Manassas in 1861, Fredericksburg in 1862, and Chancellorsville in 1863. While each of them are interesting, none of the battle scenes in ""Gods & Generals"" even come close to the intensity achieved in ""Gettysburg,"" but I suppose this is the inevitable result of trying to squeeze so much into so short a time. Frequently, the film seems more like a stage play than a film, with many of the characters delivering long monologues in lofty language while looking directly toward the camera. Still, I found this to be a strength of the film rather than a weakness. It may not make for the most realistic dramatic action, but unlike most war films, we actually come to know something about the thoughts, feelings and motives of the major characters as opposed to reducing them to moving targets waiting to be shot down. We glimpse something of the cultural and intellectual milieu of the time, with the characters making frequent reference to the Greeks and Romans, and we see a bit of the aristocratic culture of the Virginian upper class of the time, from which the Confederate officer class was derived. Although in their zeal to portray the Confederates in a sympathetic light, the filmmakers tend to whitewash the realities of slavery at the time - as in one scene, in which Gen. Jackson expresses to his personal Black servant his hope that the Confederate government will free the slaves before the U.S. government can beat them to it. This seems to suggest that the Confederate leadership didn't see themselves as fighting in defense of the institution of slavery - which, if one knows the circumstances which led to the outbreak of war, rings hollow. But as the film is more about the war itself than its causes, this is an excusable blemish. Stephen Lang's performance as Jackson is definitely the highlight of the film. One wishes that Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee would have been given more screen time, as the little bit of his performance that we do get is quite remarkable, far outshining Martin Sheen's portrayal of Lee in ""Gettysburg."" One hopes that Duvall will reprise the role for the conclusion of the trilogy in ""The Last Full Measure."" If the producers manage to combine the dramatic intensity and performances of ""Gods & Generals"" with the kinds of battle scenes in ""Gettysburg,"" it could very well end up being the greatest Civil War film to date.",1086134400,9,3713,4.803125
1887208,2,B00009OOFB,"**1/2 ""Gods and Generals"" plays less like a movie and more like a three-hour-and-49-minute long lesson in Civil War history.  Grueling and plodding, the film is almost the antithesis of ""Gone With the Wind,"" in that while both films are epic tales told from the viewpoint of the defeated South, ""Gods and Generals"" (unlike the earlier film) has been essentially drained of all emotion, drama and characterization.  ""Gods and Generals"" may be a more ""realistic"" war film than ""Gone With the Wind"" (what wouldn't be?), but it's not nearly as entertaining.
""Gods and Generals,"" which begins right after the firing on Fort Sumter and ends shortly before the Battle of Gettysburg, is the first part of a planned trilogy.  Despite a handful of ""name"" players in the cast (Robert Duvall, Jeff Daniels, Mira Sorvino and even Ted Turner in a ludicrous cameo appearance), writer/director Ronald F. Maxwell is unable to bring a single character in his film to convincing life (with the possible exception of ""Stonewall"" Jackson, who gets to carry the burden of what little drama the film has almost single-handedly).  In lieu of dialogue, the actors spend most of their time looking wistfully up to heaven or scanning the mist-shrouded horizon while delivering endless homilies about the rightness of the cause and the place of God in human affairs.  To keep it all palatable for more enlightened and egalitarian-minded modern audiences, the filmmakers are quick to have the Southern characters declare that, even though the South is forced to fight against the North to protect its God-given right to sovereignty, they, as individuals, are all personally opposed to slavery as an institution and firmly believe that their resident blacks will be freed someday as a matter of course.  Hell, the Northerners in this film seem more prejudiced against black people than the Southerners, who just can't say enough good things about their sycophantic slaves.
The battle scenes, though well staged and appropriately graphic in nature, are strangely unmoving, primarily because we have no emotional stake in any of the characters we see doing the fighting.  Without anyone for us to focus on and care about, the audience becomes little more than curious bystanders, passive and unengaged observers of this brutal display of ritualized slaughter.  Although the visuals are splendid throughout, the musical score, except in a few places, is like a thick, heavy syrup poured over the entire film.
By providing subtitled identification of the principal people, places, dates and battles, ""Gods and Generals"" does provide a service as a history lesson of sorts.  As a drama, however, the film is woefully lacking in every way imaginable.  ""Gods and Generals"" may thrill the heart of the diehard Civil War buff.  The rest of us will have to stick to our dreams of Scarlett and Rhett, and of a romanticized vision of the South that only a Golden Age Hollywood mogul would have dared come up with.",1085788800,9,2971,5.067622950819672

1887210,4,B00009OOFB,"(This is an essay I wrote for school about the movie.)
The Civil War has always fascinated me.  When my brother and I were little, my Dad instilled this interest into me by reading two books to us - one about Robert E. Lee, the other about Thomas Jonathan (better known as ""Stonewall"") Jackson.  Through those books, I came to greatly admire these two men.  They were both such great Christians and role models, and they were also brilliant generals.  For two years they managed to utterly confound a much greater and better-equipped foe and win earth-shattering victories in the face of great odds.  But they happened to be on the side that lost the war, thus making them the ""bad guys.""  Although they fought on the south, neither of them supported slavery; they did what they felt was right (fighting to preserve their home state), were great generals, incredibly good role models, and two of my heroes.  I've always especially admired Stonewall Jackson.  Yet there was never a movie or radio drama made about him.  He got killed during the war, and his side ended up losing, so his story was - except for in books - pretty much just ignored.
 I recently watched a movie, Gods and Generals - the prequel to Gettysburg, which was a famous Civil War movie.  Gettysburg's greatest achievement was that it did not unfairly paint the South as an evil slave machine that must be destroyed, but instead tried to show both sides of the story in a clear light.  Gods and Generals basically does the same thing, and that fairness is what makes it capable of finally giving the first positive, accurate portrayal of Stonewall Jackson in a major production.  Political correctness does not exist in this movie, nor is it a radical political flick about how Dixie was right and the world would have been a better place with its victory.  Gods and Generals simply tells the story of Stonewall Jackson.
 I am often disappointed by movies that either stain the characters of the people they portray, change history, or completely distort the books they're based upon.  Gods and Generals does none of these - it faithfully shows Jackson as the brilliant leader and devout Christian man with an honorable character that he was without making fun of his faith.  He was not perfect of course, and Gods and Generals tries to demonstrate that aspect of him too.  Jackson had doubts, fears, and he made mistakes - one that cost him his life.
This film contains none of the overly graphic violence, language, or sexuality that has become far too common in modern movies; and it respects - even applauds Christianity.  Despite the fact that this film is a bit too long, and the first part can get kind of slow, Gods and Generals masterfully weaves together Jackson's personal life, his legend as a general (along with a suspense-filled portrayal of his military genius in his surprise attack on Chancelorsville), and his dedicated Christianity into a long-overdue, well-done portrayal of one of my heroes.",1084665600,3,2983,4.779727095516569

Many black men fought for the South of their own free will. According to one Union office in Winchester, VA. Jackson's army consisted of more than 3,000 armed black soldiers. Yes the movie is long, and yes they did skip over Jackson's valley campaign (which is where he showed his true leader ship qualities.) The worst part of the entire film is where Jeff Daniels give his little speech of how the south is not fighting for states rights. If you listen to what he say he is being a bigot. As the north was trying to keep the south in the union at the point of a bloody bayonet. The other bad part is when the Yankee soldiers are looting Fredricksburg, but stop at one house because they think a black woman owns it. The truth is they would have rapped her, looted the house, and burned it down as many Yankee soldiers thought that no black person could own property in the South.",1084406400,5,1043,4.381443298969073

The director should have ben more careful about the height/weight ratio of the reenactors. I am 5 feet 6 inches tall and weigh 150. Even that's a tad overweight for people of the day. There were too many fat soldiers. Also, Maxwell should have shown more of the horrors of war, the blown off limbs, the blood (ala Saving Private Ryan). People need to understand that Civil War battles were just as horrible as other battles from WW1, WW2, etc. War is war, and it's all horrible. As an extra in the movie, I wish I could give it a higher rating, but the shortened version and long winded dialogue keeps me from doing so.

Despite the focus on Jackson, you come away with little insight as to what made this man arguably one of the greatest generals of history.  I was excited with Robert Duvall as Lee, but you can measure his screen time with an egg timer, a waste of a good actor who could have explored the complexities of the man.

I watched this well after all the critics who totally panned this movie went on to rave about much simpler and amusing offerings. Remember that ""musing"" is defined as ""To be absorbed in one's thoughts; engage in meditation"" and ""amusing"" is the lack there of.
That appears to be the basis of most critics' comments; lack of thought or meditation on what they saw. The movie was too deep for them; they looked for, and did not find, a simple protagonist / antagonist relationship or a quick and complete resolution to the conflict at hand. Perhaps the critics themselves couldn't pick which side to cheer for given the complexity and conflict of the issues at hand. But it is precisely those things that define why the civil war was so tragic and why it had such a profound impact on our nation. I dare to say there are not many today who would take up arms for causes such as those.
The treatment of the topic in both script and cinematography brings the conflict deep into the heart and mind of anyone daring enough to ask the question, ""what if I had to choose?"" This was a very low-tech war fought with what we now consider to be antiquated tactics; this movie does not need special effects to accurately depict what took place (sorry critics).

I seen the movie COLD MOUNTAIN I give it 5* to but I love G&G the best. I was gooing to be in the movie since I'm a reenactor but i didn't have enough time but a lot of guys in my group where in the film as well. I love the battle scenes in the movie the reason why there is not alot of blood is because they did not want to make the movie raited ""R"".Another thing is that they called the movie Gettysburg, instead of The Killer Angles, is because they though that the viewers would have thought that it would be a movie about biker ganes.

1887227,2,B00009OOFB,"I find it ironic that this movie (along with Gettysburg) is so meticulous in regards to getting the uniforms, the settings, the flags, and the weapons ""just right""-- but fails to understand the true nature of the Civil War. The Civil War was a bloody, gruesome affair that in all fairness could never really be captured on film. Men did simply fall down when they were shot; they were blown to pieces and they tended to writhe in agony on the battle field for hours. Men starved, were ravaged by disease, and had inadequate clothing. ""Boys"" fought along side men. This film over-romanticizes and over-dramaticizes this conflict of conflicts to the point of disparaging its legacy. This is a movie for the ""reinactors"" who are more concerned with buttons and hats then they are with understanding what the civil war was really like.
Let me go into a few specifics: First, the soldiers in this film are laughable. Since when were so many civil war soldiers overweight men in their 50s and 60s? How did they keep their uniforms so clean? Jeff Daniels is such a pathetic Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. Chamberlain was one of the great heroes of the North and to have a stiff, awkward Daniels, who is probably about 15 years older than Chamberlain was, is an insult to Chamberlain's memory. Second, the constant background music is so annoying. It just serves to heighten the phoniness of this movie. Third, this film tries to convey the broad scope of battle, but only succeeds in creating a confusing mess. Furthermore, the greatness of Lee, Jackson, and Chamberlain are not even conveyed. Chancellorsville was considered Lee's greatest victory, but if you watch this movie without knowing that, you might still be wondering who won it! The same can be said for Jackson. Without knowing Jackson's background and what he exactly did, the uninformed viewer might leave the film wondering ""why was this guy so great-- other than being a good Christian?""
The Battle of the Crater in Cold Mountain conveys more realism and authenticity in 20 minutes than Gods and Generals does in 3.5 hours. Gods and Generals was ambitious, which is why I give it 2 stars instead of one; however, it's just too bad that this ambition came from individuals who don't know anything about the Civil War (except maybe for what kind of buttons an officer in the 5th Wisconsin might wear).",1081728000,10,2357,4.822222222222222

He put his trust in God and Heaven and feared not death. But this doesn't make good film! The scenes with the General praying drags out and gets so boring that it makes you wonder if it really is a war movie or a churchschool-movie... I was bored beyond belief. The reason for that I gave two stars in stead of one is because of the battle scenes. They really show (except the Manassas scenes) how the Confederate Army under leadership of General Lee gave the Yankee invaders a serious whooping! Other than that the movie is a sad, sad attempt on making a good Civil War movie...

1887229,3,B00009OOFB,"It seems that Hollywood directors who make civil war movies are infatuated with titles that begin with a ""G"" -- Gettysburg; Glory; now Gods and Generals. It's difficult to see why this filmathon was needed as a sandwich between Gettysburg and The Killer Angels (yes, they'll be making a movie out of the book, again!)
Reviewers in-the-know here seem to be bothered by the ""Southern point of view"" but in my mind that's the least of G&G's worries. One could argue that the film whitewashes slavery (no pun intended) and offers apologetics in the place of facts -- when a character makes a racist or insensitive comment he's always wearing a blue uniform, and there are essentially just two fawning slaves.
No, the film's pains are much graver. Unlike Gettysburg which focused on 3 days of actual war, G&G casts its net wide and far. I'm sure it is impeccably accurate from an historical perspective, but in his attempt to be accurate about the sensitive subject matter, the director here seemed to have overextended himself. The result is sloppy, rambling, and poorly paced.
There are times when everything even grinds to a complete halt. The Irish soldier and the cook are dead weight, and Stonewall's wife is another aspect we could do without. Robet Duvall plays a minor role, that is a big mistake. The battles scenes are just uninspired and morose. The film smacks of a documentary with no narration, the structure is so poor.

1887231,3,B00009OOFB,"In the film ""Gettysburg"" Colonel Joshua Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels) utters ""there's nothing so much like a god on earth as a general on a battlefield."" Based on Jeff Shaara's novel of the same title ""Gods and Generals"" is the prequel to ""Gettysburg,"" which itself was based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel, ""The Killer Angels,"" written by Shaara's father, Michael.
Directed and adapted for the screen by Ron Maxwell (as was its predecessor) ""Gods and Generals"" presents the first two years of the American Civil War as the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Northern Virginia struggle against each other in the battles of First Bull Run, Fredricksburg and Chancelorsville.
Much has been made of the film's historical accuracy but, little of the gore and carnage of war can been seen in its sanitized battle scenes filled with smoke, explosions, and men falling to the ground.  Though the battle scenes themselves are expertly choreographed, hardly any thought seems to have gone into the cinematography of these scenes as they lack imagination in their framing and execution. Yet, I found the battle scenes alone worth the price of admission.
I cannot say the same for Maxwell's bloated screenplay which is filled with flowery dialogue, long-winded speeches, and droning soliloquies.  Yes, citizens of the nineteenth century spoke differently than we do today, but the dialogue is so jarring to the modern ear that it is nearly impossible for an audience to maintain a willingness to suspend its disbelief.
The narrative in Mr. Shaara's novel is nearly equally split between four major characters: Colonel Joshua Chamberlain and General Winfield Scott Hancock on the side of the Union and Generals Robert E. Lee and Jonathan ""Stonewall"" Jackson on the Confederate side, while Mr. Maxwell's adaptation can nearly be considered as a Stonewall Jackson bio-pic with the other characters merely as supporting players.  Shaara's book maintains a balance of viewpoints of both North and South but, Maxwell's film tilts the majority of screen time to the Confederate side.
Stephen Lang does an admirable job as the highly religious Stonewall Jackson.  Indeed, the film's shining glory is that Maxwell's screenplay and Lang's performance come closest to capturing the man that Jonathan Jackson was in reality as anything yet set forth on film.  Though it is hard to separate Lang from his earlier portrayal of General George Picket in ""Gettysburg.""  Jeff Daniels competently reprises his role as Chamberlain, though he lacks screen time and is saddled with reciting Lucanus' ""The Crossing of the Rubicon"" as he watches elements the Union Army crossing the Rappahanock River into Fredericksburg, Virginia.  The films greatest disappointment was Robert Duvall in his lackluster performance as General Robert E. Lee.
Randy Edelman's sentimental score is adequate to the task at hand, and though pleasurable to listen to it does not rise to meet the challenge of the material presented.  Mary Fahl's contribution, ""Going Home,"" played over the opening credits of windblown battle flags, in a movie which the director well knows is going to come in at 3  hours, should have fallen to the cutting room floor, though I love every note of it.  And Bob Dylan is as raspy as ever in his ""Cross the Green Mountain"" played over the end credits.
Is ""Gods and Generals"" the greatest movie ever made about the American Civil War?  No.  Is it the most accurate movie about the Civil War?  Quite possibly.  But accuracy could not save this movie.  Editing could.  Edit the screenplay.  Edit the dialogue and speeches.  Edit the opening credits.  Edit.  Edit.  Edit.",1081296000,9,3643,5.1096121416526135
1887232,2,B00009OOFB,"I had been eagerly awaiting this film since I finished reading ""Gods and Generals"" several years ago.  Maybe I should crack open that book again, but, as I recall, this movie has little resemblance to the book.  The movie is filled with cheesy civilian scenes, long, boring, and irrelevant speeches, and confusing plot connections.  Because of my background in Civil War history I was able to follow the plot, but those who don't know a lot about the war would be thoroughly confused and misled (especially concerning the causes of the war and the institution of slavery).  The movie gave hardly any time to General Hancock (who played a huge role in Shaara's book).  That was a major disappointment.
I must commend Stephen Lang's performance as Stonewall Jackson.  I think he single-handedly kept this movie afloat.
I have a hard time believing that this is the work of the same Ron Maxwell who directed such a masterpiece as ""Gettysburg.""  ESPECIALLY since ""Gettysburg"" followed the plotline of ""The Killer Angels"" so carefully.  I have no idea why Maxwell deviated so much from Jeff Shaara's ""Gods and Generals.""

The Confederate south hadn't suffered from the invasions of Sherman and Grant, and Sheridan hadn't burned out the Virginia Shenandoah Valley.  Lee was a hero and Jackson was the archangel Stonewall.  There was, too my mind, an almost surreal atmosphere surrounding the initial stages of this terrible conflict.  Picnics to the battlefields, war and glory, honor and all of the other attributes associated with this period.  Twenty First century thought would never look at war in such a positive light.  A few bad days of bloodlettings during the civil war probably changed the soldier's attitudes.  Not to mention the American's who personally experienced the horror and destruction.  Early in the Civil War the mindset was different and this film brings it out, piously.  I liked Turner's Gettysburg better. As is true to form with both these films the accuracy of the gear displayed great attention to detail, employing re-enactors for both Army's and civilian lent credibility to the historical representations.

I liked the film's opening with Mary Fahl's ""Going Home"" with the various state battle flags. It's a shame that ""Gods and Generals"" didn't come out before the half-baked ""Gettysburg.""
Ted Turner certainly put more of his heart into ""Gods."" Look for Turner's cameo appearance at the film's mid-point. I believe the film would have been better if more details would have given to events leading up to the war from both sides. That I guess would have added at least another hour of footage.
From the film, I enjoyed finally seeing overdue justice given to Stonewall Jackson. Having read extensively on Jackson's life and military campaigns, I always believed a movie about him would be great project. ""Gods"" brings a deeply personal sketch of Jackson's Christian character as a devoted husband, soldier, and servant of the Lord. Unfortunately, contemporary film viewers may find ""Gods"" difficult to identify with.

1887239,5,B00009OOFB,"Gods and Generals is a film for Civil War buffs abroad, it is not--I repeat--it is not a typical film that if you expect plenty of action and melodrama you will be greatly mistaken.  This is a film that was intended to tell the story of the Civil War, at least some parts of it.  As much as I think Gettysburg was more put together and flowed so much easier, Gods and Generals is still a fine work of art if you look at it with a fair mind.
This film created much controversy because it viewed the South as something different than ""slave whipping white men who were evil.""  They were viewed as humans, with purposes and reasons to going to war besides keeping slavery.  Southerns fought for their way of life, whether you think that's right or wrong is beside the point, the movie had a right in portraying its characters as such.  Southerners lived differently than the North.  They had a different economy with a different form of thought over what America is and was.  In their minds, America was a nation made up of many nations or states that were to be free to make up their own minds.  But the North viewed America as one country and it was to be controlled by a central government composed of represenatives from every state.  So you can say the war was over States Rights not slavery.
Now, talking about slavery, some folks here seem to think that this is what the film should've been about.  Some throw hissy fits in their reviews because Jackson prays with a black man?  So where is it written that every southerner was a racist and wouldn't be caught dead talking to a black man less praying with him?  Don't generalize, it's very unbecoming when I read your reviews.  Keep an open mind, please.  And yes, blacks in the south--initially--were for the confederacy.  Why you ask?  Because they didn't care much for Yankees either.  The South was their home too, and they viewed the North as invaders not liberators.  Historical fact: slaves knew not a different life different from their own.  Another historical fact: slaves did not always hate their white masters but revered them at times as patrons and leaders.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not promoting slavery or making excuses for the South's way of life, but I do want to make it clear that blacks were not always mistreated and not always resentful of their white brethern.
Now, there have been some quote ""civil war buffs"" who claim that Jackson is painted out to be some ""Christ like character.""  I honestly have no idea what they mean.  Jackson was a very religious man, often considered a fanatic, that's all opinion.  He was ruthless on the battle field, his losses were high, so some have called him a ""killer"" as one reviewer called him.  Another opinion, take it for what it's worth.  I suppose some reviewers wanted the film to show Jackson as a mad man and not as a man who's maybe a little extreme when it comes to the battlefield.  I'm sorry, I have a hard time taking the word of a reviewer who takes an extreme view of Jackson and expects me to swallow it.  I never knew the man, we only know of what historians tell us and what his biography displays, and from what I understand this movie does that well.
My one complaint about this film is balance.  It does come across that this is a film told primarily from the Southern point of view.  This sucks because we don't really understand much of the North's reasons to go to war and we don't get the equal balance of strategy before each battle.  Like Chancellorsville: how come Jackson's corp was able to ambush Hooker's right flank?  What was Hooker thinking?  We don't know, because he's never given the opportunity.  I think there is a little too much Thomas Jackson in this film, to be fair, and it goes a bit overboard with his personal life.  Lee and Chamberlain, the other main characters are brief in their roles because Jackson hogs the entire movie.  This was a mistake, I believe, and it created some bore.  But it isn't that bad to demote a star.
The flow of the film is a bit choppy, jumping from Manassas to Fredricksburg to Chancellorsville.  They did leave some battles out in between, but because of time restraints, I understand why.  But again, if they trimmed some of Jackson's over abundance of personal life time to military strategy and battle sequences, I think the film would've surpassed Gettysburg.
In summary, Gods and Generals is a historical film.  It teaches you quite a bit about that period, it gives the viewer an opportunity to see the southern view point for once and does enlighten you on some of the battles.  It's worth seeing if you like historical films.  But if you go into it with a narrow mind, as other reviewers here have done, you'll end up being bitter.

1887240,4,B00009OOFB,"Many of the reviews here seem to divide into 2 main camps, depending upon the reviewers' political and cultural views.  I am a Civil War buff, and a ""amateur"" historian, if there is such a thing.  And thoroughly Southern (before I moved into the great white North).  First off, this movie deserves, in my humble opinion, to be honored for its historically accurate depictions of the basis of the conflict as well as the emotions of those who fought.  I felt the acting was superb, except for some of the ""large"" reenactors.  Was it biased a bit more towards its overview of Jackson?  Absolutely.  But I believe Ron Maxwell wanted it that way to ensure that this would not turn into the normally self-righteous Civil War period movie we've seen before.  For those who wonder about the feelings of Southern people, read closely this quotation of George Eliot that appears during the opening credits:
  ""A human life, I think, should be well rooted in some spot of a native land, where it may get the love of tender kinship for the face of the earth, for the labors men go forth to, for the sounds and accents that haunt it, for whatever will give that early home a familiar unmistakable difference amidst the future widening of knowledge.  The best introduction to astronomy is to think of the nightly heavens as a little lot of stars belonging to one's own homestead.""
That quote sums it up quite well, even for how we Southerners feel today.  For Jackson, his portrayal was accurate.  I would not doubt that Jackson's prayer with his black cook could have certainly happened.  Before the war, in Lexington, Jackson personally ran a Sunday School class for slaves.  During the war, whenever he encountered someone who was from his hometown, he would ask about the status of that class.  Jackson's religious fervor was well-known among all at that time.  Though the movie did not (and could not) get into the religious implications of the war, I think that it simply was God's plan (for those of you who believe - others please bear with me) to humble the North in the beginning, then take Jackson out of the picture, then lead Abe to issue the Emancipation after Sharpsburg.  Make no mistake:  our nation SUFFERED because of the evil of institutionalized slavery.  The South in particular.  So that is the one complaint I have about this movie - it glossed over slavery a bit too much.  Otherwise, it is indeed a haunting and emotional drama, truly depicted.",1078704000,6,2457,4.704918032786885
1887241,2,B00009OOFB,"Preface: I loved ""Gettysburg"".  Although it was preachy historical fiction, it was entertaining and well balanced between North and South, although I would say it was 60% South, 40% North.
With that in mind, how can you describe how bad this movie was without sounding petty?  You can't.  Instead of Gods and Generals, the movie should have been called ""Stonewall Jackson... Oh, and Some Other Guys.""  I really went to the theater hoping the critics were wrong. After all, ""Gettysburg"" was not hi-tech, but it had heart.  The lights dimmed, and then I sat for hours in the theater hoping that the movie would pick up the pace slightly.  ""Look how wonderful of a person Stonewall Jackson is"" screamed the movie, and I wondered if anyone writing the movie bothered to read the book.
The book, for those of you who loved the film, was about four leaders (Generals Lee, Hancock, Jackson and Chamberlain), and Stoney was only supposed to be 1/4 of them.  Instead, the movie focused about 60% of its time telling me that Stonewall Jackson was a good man, who loved his wife and daughter, and was loved by his men.  Hancock and Chamberlain seemed to be mere afterthoughts, although Lee seemed to get at least 25% of the screen time.  If this movie was a four hour expose about Gen. Jackson, I think that I would not have been so disappointed.
But, whatever, take these comments for what they are worth (free advice).  If you want to torture yourself, watch this movie.  While you are at it, check out Matrix Revolutions, Gigli, and any one of the many Adam Sandler movies are on the shelf.

Sorry, but the amazon initial review betrays the fact that there are not only misguided priorities, but that it really is valuable for the study of the Civil War, as to see the difference between history and romance.
The portral of Jackson was quite interesting nevertheless, and especially his moving tribute to his first brigade-which should at least be watched by military commanders to see how a good speech can move military men.
One wonders whether Jackson would have had a prayer with
his cook, a slave.",1078444800,5,869,4.6797385620915035
1887243,5,B00009OOFB,"My God!? 539 reviews? It would seem that a lot of folks who didn't like this movie brought their own political views to the table. Should you bother to buy this movie? It depends what you're looking for and depends on whether or not you'd like to know how things really were, or if you'd prefer the politically correct pabulum that's being pedaled in our society today.
WHO SHOULD NOT SEE THIS MOVIE:
If you are looking for thrills, spills, chills, and the mindless Hollywood drivel that passes for entertainment these days, then skip this movie.  Stick to ""Dude Where's My Car"" or the ""Matrix"" or better yet,""The Dominatrix"".
If you have the attention span of a fruit fly and you're running low on your Ritalin, then skip this movie. The people of the 19th century, for all their shortcomings, had better attention spans than we do. No ""time outs"", no video games, no Reality TV. Life itself was the reality and they had little time to be bored. Words meant something to them. Those words will mean little to you because you've never learned to listen.
If you are the type who wrings his or her hands whining and pontificating about ""chattel slavery"", then please skip this movie. You'll give yourself carpal tunnel and a nervous breakdown to boot. You'll also give the rest of us a headache with your incessant, self-righteous reviews.  You obviously know little about history, because if you did, you would not be engaging in ""presentism"", that is, the judging the people of the past by contemporary standards. Slavery has been around since the dawn of time. Everyone's had it, including the Africans. Get over it already.
And finally, if you're the super-patriot, chest thumping, ""I'm a PROUD American and the Confederates were all Traitors"" type, then skip this movie. You obviously never read William Rawle's ""A View of the Constitution"", which was required reading at West Point before the war. You obviously are not aware that 16,000 Confederate soldiers are buried in Arlington National Cemetery with the full blessing of the United States Government. And despite your professed love for America, you just can't seem to get it through your head that the America you know was born in a crucible of blood we call ""The Civil War"".
WHO SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE:
Want to know how southerners of this period saw the war? Do you want to gain that understanding without having to read a hundred books and invest years of your life doing it? Then see this movie! It's that simple. Ron Maxwell does a rather masterful job of portraying what was, and of giving us the opportunity to see it through the eyes of the people who lived it.
The DVD has a few perks added on. The music videos by Mary Fahl, who is absolutely gorgeous, and Bob Dylan were superb! There are some interesting clips on the DVD that ended up on the cutting room floor. And there's a discussion of the movie by a couple of historians at the end of the film.
Yes, the film is full of religious references. Jackson was devoutly religious and old Massa' Robert wasn't far behind. Religion played an important part in these men's lives and in the lives of the men they led.  To fail to understand the south's affinity for religion is to fail to understand the south.
The slavery question is conspicuously underplayed? Read the letters and diaries of southern soldiers. You'll not find much mention of it. For that matter, you won't find it much in the diaries and letters of the northern soldiers either. What you will find a strong emphasis on is the concept of ""home"". Today the word ""home"" is most often a building that we purchase and live in until it appreciates in value. Then we sell it and move to a more upscale ""home"". There was a time when the word ""home"" meant something quite different. You fought for it, and you died for it if necessary.
And no, you don't need a repeat of ""Saving Private Ryan"". To be sure, the wounds inflicted by weapons of this period caused the same kind of trauma to the human body, but bloody stumps that were once legs and intestines strewn on the ground are not present in this movie. It simply isn't necessary.  If you pay attention you'll see that there is plenty of gut wrenching in this movie, but it's the emotional kind. I have to admit that I found myself with a lump in my throat watching the Irish Yanks and the Irish Rebs slaughter each other up on Marye's Heights.
If I'd level one criticism, it would be the so-called ""special effects"", or CGI. There are a couple of shots of Fredericksburg and of the Union troops advancing on Marye's Heights that resemble a bad video game.
And finally, yes, there were a few fat reenactors, both in blue as well as gray. It goes with the territory I suppose. The average civil war soldier was 24 years old, weighed 140-150lbs and stood 5'6"" tall. He could walk 18 miles in a day and there were no McDonald's, no KofC, and no Wendy's around! The average civil war reenactor is twice the age of the soldier he represents, generally has a job and a family and like most of us who are getting up in years, he's fighting his own personal ""battle of the bulge"". But several times a year, he gives up his spare time to join others who share his passion. Together, they attempt to give us a glimpse into what was. Thousands of such people gave of themselves and their free time so that this movie could be made. As a sometimes reenactor myself I salute their efforts and their self sacrifice.",1078185600,36,5433,4.574948665297741
1887254,5,B00009OOFB,"Ok first off I saw this movie and thoroughly enjoyed.  However, I cannot stand reading reviews by people who do nothing but complain.  Some slaves returned to their ""masters"" after the civil war to continue to work for them!  Slavery as an institution is bad and though not excusable there were slave owners who treated their slaves with respect while you had your bad lot as well.  Please don't believe I'm advocating or you are an idiot.  South went to war with the north cause they were being driven into nothing financially by the feds.  This war was about economics, freedom, fairness, and self rule....the south rebelled and that does not make them traitors....that was not law at the time only after the war was secession made illegal.  If you honestly believe Lincoln gave two nuggets about the black and poor down trodden slaves you are a fool....this war had nothing to do with slavery...but all the complaints by idiots is nothing more than garbage and should be ignored.  Its just like the left to lie, they distort everything to gain advantage....Then you have reality and they are just so appalled and begin their propaganda machine.",1077494400,9,1147,4.816326530612245
1887255,5,B00009OOFB,"Definitely a great epic Civil War movie and one of my personal favorites, Gods and Generals, brings to the screen three of the most important battles of the early stages of the War: Manassas/Bull Run, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville.  In addition, the movie portrays General ""Stonewall"" Jackson (played superbly by Stephen Lang) in great detail, both as a man and as a general, providing an important insight on one of the key figures of this military conflict. Gods and Generals is a movie about honor, bravery, fear, and heroes who fought and died in the name of Freedom and above all, love- love of country.  There is one scene in particular in which Irishmen fight Irishmen on opposite sides of the battlefield which will bring tears to the eyes of most.  A great movie indeed!",1077321600,3,786,4.850746268656716
1887256,3,B00009OOFB,"I'm afriad I have to agree with Gregory S. Suszkowski on several points.  ""Gods & Generals"" is replete with flowery speaches and simply unrealistic dialogue that do nothing to propel the movie forward.  Great movies demonstrate inner conflict, they do not release it in extended verbiage (see Matthew Broderick or Morgan Freeman in ""Glory"").
Now, that being said, I must admit that there is a lot to like about ""Gods & Generals"". Stephen Lang gives a classic performance here as General Thomas Jackson.  Even though he, too, must grandstand occasionally with the rash of long rhetoric, he does it passionately and with so much color that if I ever meet the real Stonewall Jackson I will have a hard time with it if he is nothing like the character in this film.
Likewise, Robert Duvall seemed born to play the part of Robert E. Lee -- but you know he's going to be good, you expect it.
The underated Jeff Daniels turns in an acceptable performance as Lt. Chamberlain, but again, he is saddled with some, uh, ""spacious"" dialogues (the script almost becomes cartoonish when he is telling his wife he will be serving).
But who cares, the battle scenes are phenomenal!  This movie is an optical masterpiece, not only with the battle scenes but the way these 19th century towns are brought to life.  It's worth watching (i've seen it 3 times), I just wish it wasn't so encumbered with so much ridiculous dialogue.",1076630400,3,1408,4.7306122448979595
1887257,5,B00009OOFB,"Although I am life-long Civil War buff, I have always had difficulty understanding how a man could take up arms against neighbors and relatives of another state.  Gods and Generals allowed me the experience of appreciating the human side of this war and insight into the historical and spiritual complexities that haunted each side. The result was overwelmingly powerful.
I've seen the film several times and discovered new meaning and understanding with each viewing.  It is rich, alive and authentic film making.",1076630400,5,514,5.2560975609756095
1887258,1,B00009OOFB,"Where to begin? As an avid Civil War hobbyist I would have to say that this is the worst representation of this period I have seen. Well maybe not worst as the costumes were great, battlefield scenes were adequate and some actors actually were somewhat believeable.
However, one must compare this work with ""Gettysburg"" and this is where is falls apart for me. The flow of this film is not like ""Gettysburg"" at all. If this is about the war, where are all the battles and the men and generals of those armies? Where is Antietam? Jackson and a little girl? Sweet but this has NOTHING to do with the early dominance of the Confederate forces. Where does the movie make ANY reference to the mistakes of and the incompetence of the early war Union leadership? If this movie is the prequel to ""Gettysburg"" then these things must be presented for the events in ""Gettysburg"" to make more sense for those not entirely schooled in this subject.
I won't even go into the preachy, speechy, flowery script that is just so unnecessary. What happened to the way everyone spoke in ""Gettysburg""? That movie seemed to be about right, at least in my opinion. At least the movie does get Lee's reaction to Jackson's death correct (left arm, right arm statement) and Jackson's last words correct but holy cow, it would make people believe that an answer to a simple yes or no question would take a 20 minute oration quoting Homer and/or Julius Caesar with a prayer thrown in for good measure. Surely the people of this time were more religious but this is a movie and all these speeches makes this movie plod along.
In short, if you must see it rent it. Do not buy or just wait for Last Full Measure.",1076284800,32,1680,4.529605263157895

1887260,2,B00009OOFB,"After I saw Gettysburg I wandered around yelling ""Bayonets!"" at the top of my lungs like many other fine Americans, disconcerting both my wife and dog. After I saw G&G, I wandered around yelling ""Where are the #*%$&# bayonets?"" disconcerting my wife, my daughter and both my dogs. Though the same creative team made both films, G&G sorely lacks the center around which Gettysburg revolved, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlin, whose above-mentioned order saved the Union. To be fair, Thomas J. Jackson is a worthwhile character to explore, but the portayal of Southerners as God fearing Protestants in the best Martha Stuart tradition, and Northerners as Pagan-quoting bespattered vulgarians aggravated me no end.
True, Jackson was a religious man, true he was a near psychopath in battle, and true, the 19th century had a deeper tolerance of such flamboyant characters than the 20th or 21 century does, but to make him into a perfect Saint is to deny the truth; he and his cause were based on human chattel slavery. The relationship Jackson has with his cook is dubious at best, harmfully untrue at worst, and does little to show the actual conditions of slavery.  In fact, only the house slaves (I would use the correct term, but I hate the word) are visible. The Christmas scene after Fredricksberg made me gag; I thought I was watching ""A Southern Living Christmas.""  Jackson comports with a five year old child, preaching Christianity and vowing to ""Kill them all.""  I don't doubt that's all true, but somehow his death is elevated to a religous transcendance - choirs and big music - I felt like I was watching history written by the Republican National Committee.
Steven Lang, for what it's worth, is hypnotic as the saint of the Confederacy, and I even liked Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee more than Martin Sheen, but most of the actors here were simply too old to play their roles.
If I'm going to invest four hours of my life, I would like at least to be treated like an adult, and this film plays like an over enthusiatic small-town football coach of really good intentions got hold of fifty million dollars and went wild. (This is no slam on small-town football coaches.)
Spare me. The Ante-Bellum South, while pretty if you were White and Rich, was a bad cause to fight for. Northern factories weren't pretty either, but to claim that all the killing at Bull Run, Fredricksberg and Chancherivlle was to defend the South from banks and factories is a lie, a bad lie, and bad history.  Also, sure, reenactors are fine, but put most of them on a 12-week diet of rice and beans, march them up and down hills and give them dysentery before you put them in front of a camera and tell me there were this many obese footsoldiers in the Civil War. Also, in a post Saving Private Ryan world, the lack of realistic battle trauma all undercut this film deeply. This was the first instance of industrialized butchery, a percursor to the industrial butchery of the 20th century, yet men die like they did in 1960's television.",1075939200,11,3016,4.717267552182163
1887261,4,B00009OOFB,"War. It is a prequel to ""Gettysburg"" made 11 years ago yet the first of a planned trilogy.
  The war is pursued thru its protagonist, General  Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson. By the way, he disliked that nickname. He was a very devout man & believed in predestiny,  therefore was utterly fearless. As he fought it, this movie is definitely rebel friendly. Jackson was portrayed as a highly moral man with integrity. Questions such as slavery are neatly glossed over. The first three battles are nicely outlined without getting bogged down in boring (to some) details.
  Training & recruiting of civilians without a clue is covered. This use of nonprofessional soldiers & the advance of weapons technology since the last major conflict, the Napoleonic wars, 35 years before, make this one of the first modern wars in history.
  The south had the best generals such as Jackson, Beaureguard & Lee, played superbly by Robert Duval. It was as I imagined him.
  As good as the southern general were the northern generals  were insubordinate, (to Lincoln) cowardly & incompetant. They delayed after Bull Run allowing the Confederates who were out-gunned & out-manned to build impregnable defenses. Stupidly, the union generals threw waves of young men into frontal assualts repeatedly. I imagine that is where the term ""cannon fodder"" was coined. The carnage yielded nothing & the Yankees retreated. This failure ensured a long, bloody conflict.
  The ""Making of..."", commentaries & two fine songs by Dylan & Mary Fahl were nice additions to the DVD version.",1075939200,4,1547,5.091269841269841
1887272,5,B00009OOFB,"Gods and Generals has a running time of four hours. The length of the program may make it desirable for some people to plan to watch the film over two evenings. The first half of the film introduces us to the cast of characters, the Southern point of view for the Civil War, and some opening skirmishes. When the film begins we meet Colonel Robert E. Lee. He has a chance to take command of a large union army that will most likely have to march into Virginia. Lee declines the promotion saying that he will not fight against his friends and neighbors in Virginia. He is not for slavery or secession, but he is intensely loyal to his state and its people. When Virginia secedes from the Union, Lee becomes commander in chief of the confederate forces. More than simply an able commander, he is is revered and even loved by his men. Robert Duvall does a fine job bringing to life the quiet capability and humanity of General Lee.

Gods and Generals is less about Lee and more about General Stonewall Jackson, a religious man who hates war, but when it is forced on him, he becomes totally committed to the Confederate cause. They named him right. Stonewall Jackson is most unlike a typical general. He is not afraid to put himself in harms way. His men respect and even idolize him for his willingness to lead by example. An intensely religious man, Jackson believes his fate has been predetermined. He will go to his heavenly home when God calls him and his place with the Lord is the better place to be. He loves his life and family, but he is not afraid to lose either of them. He believes his cause is just and all his will and energy is spent pursuing his goal to drive the invading Union Army from the south.

In contrast, the Union Army is led by cautious men who think they can win battles from the rear in headquarters safe from harm. At Fredericksburg, for example, one of the major battles of the early war between the states, the Union generals send their troops into battle when they have little chance of succeeding. The Confederate army slaughters thousdands of hapless and badly led Union soldiers. Jackson takes no pleasure in seeing so many brave yankee soldiers die to no good purpose, but he remains committed to killing as many of the enemy as possible. While out at the front with his troops, Jackson is ambushed and seriously wounded. He dies and his loss is a disaster for the Confederacy.

Gods and Generals moves slowly. History should not be rushed. Those viewers who wish to be introduced to the minds and hearts of Generals Lee and Jackson will not, I think, be disappointed. Through their eyes we see the best intentions of the men who fight for the Southern cause. From the distance of almost 150 years we have the chance to be objective and to try to understand how men of courage and integrity could fight for the southern cause.",1075852800,,2861,4.508670520231214
1887273,5,B00009OOFB,"I've always been sympathetic to the cause of the Confederacy, having learned that it wasn't just about slavery.  For two good books currently in print on the subject, see ""When in the Course of Human Events""  by Charles Adams and ""The Real Lincoln"" by Thomas DiLorenzo.  The three main criticisms I've seem of this film was that 1) it didn't portray the sufferings of the slaves, 2)there were too many long and drawn out soliloquies,and 3)it was too sympathetic to the South.  Well, I think the liberal elite hates the fact that Lee and Jackson were devout Christians.  Lee, by the way, had freed his slaves long before the war (whereas U.S. Grant still owned some rather late in the game!).  I didn't see the speeches and prayers as being too drawn out.  The problem is, people want action and blood.  Listening is too difficult.  As to the slaves, I think this movie portrayed their plight very well.  The 2 or 3 slaves featured were very eloquent in describing their desire to be free, despite the fact that they loved their masters.

Having read Shelby Foote's trilogy I found that I was able to string together the rather disjointed episodes that made up this movie.  Whole chunks of the war are missed out and events that shaped the main characters are not even referred to.  This is no doubt due to the constraints of compressing a large chunk of history into a manageable length for release at the cinema.  Stephen Lang is superb as Jackson and Duval makes a very believable Lee.  As for the rest of the performances, they are more soap opera than grand opera.

The battle scenes were very well done and made child-safe, but during the battle of Bull Run, I noticed one scene of Confederate soldiers advancing was used 3 times.

1887280,2,B00009OOFB,"As a student of Civil War history, I looked forward to seeing this film.  It was a big disappointment: too long, and extremely BORING.  The battle scenes, which really are what the whole thing is supposed to be about (Civil War, remember?) get lost in all the contrived, stilted dialogue and preaching.  Every statement-particularly from the Confederate side-reminds one of the bombast from a Cecil B. DeMille religious epic (The Ten Commandments comes to mind).
The three great battles of Bull Run, Fredricksburg, and Chancellorsville are separated by long, long stretches of tedious conversation.  Nevertheless, I certainly give credit to Stephen Lang's portrayal of Gen. 'Stonewall' Jackson; he humanizes the legendary Confederate leader, who genuinely believed that God was on his side.  The battle scenes were sanitized a bit too much, in my opinion.  Due to such films as 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Gladiator'audiences are now more accepting of war movie violence than in the past, so such watering down makes the film less believable.
There is much to like in this movie.  The overall 'look' of the film is believable; the creators actually saw fit to have artillery recoil after firing (many war films forget to do this).  The large numbers of men standing out in the open in Napoleonic fashion while getting shot to pieces is difficult to watch-even though there are no body parts to be seen when struck directly by cannon fire.  The scene of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain and his men in the field of the dead and dying after Fredricksburg is particularly poignant.  The uniforms, weaponry, and tactics are very accurate indeed.
Some gaffes are inexcusable in a film of this magnitude and historical importance.  An example?  The scene portraying Jackson's famous flanking attack at Chancellorsville contains a blatant faux pas: One of the reenactors in the Union camp fleeing the Confederate onslaught has a HUGE SMILE on his face as he runs toward the camera!  Isn't this what editing is for?  In addition, most modern moviegoers KNOW what good CGI effects look like...and there are several instances in this film where they are just plain bad.
'Gods and Generals' could have been a great film, but instead it is just mediocre.  I feel 1 whole hour could be excised and the movie would lose little in the translation.  There is always a fine balance between historical accuracy and entertainment; a feature filmmaker does not want his creation to appear like a documentary.  This film may be historically accurate, but overall is just not very entertaining.  I found Ken Burns 'Civil War' far more interesting.",1074038400,7,2619,5.051162790697674
1887291,3,B00009OOFB,"There's a trend in modern movies (Dances with Wolves, The Last Samurai)to feature western characters who disavowe their own history and culture to take new identities in (highly idealized)cultures alien to their upbringing. The question Gods and Generals asks is, does your own culture, despite all of its defects and sins (both past and present), merit preservation and loyalty -are you willing to fight to keep it?
This is what makes the Civil War so important, beyond the issue of slavery. It is a contest between an agrarian, religious, aristocratic culture, and a city dwelling, industrialist, secular one. None of this is to obscure the issue of slavery, but, if you are going to say that the confederacy was illegitimate because of slavery, then what world culture, in it's roots, is legitimate? Is it worth asking whether slavery (as an unnatural institution and with the advance of new technology, etc.) would not have soon died out on its own, without the massive blood shed and destruction the interference of the north caused, and perhaps with a lot less of the undeniable racial acrimony that the Reconstruction era caused, extending even into the present day?
Gods and Generals is the only movie which even hints at asking these (in our politically correct, present day) almost unspeakable questions.
As for the movie itself:
At almost 4 hours it is a very long and not particularly focused movie; as opposed to other movies of the same genre, say, Braveheart. It's often hard to follow the thread of events from one scene to the next. There are very powerful scenes next to scenes that left me completly baffled(the train conductor scene, the bonnie blue flag folk dance). In some ways it works almost as well as a sort of anthology of civil war video images, as it does a movie. The battle scenes get the job done, sometimes very realistically, but director Maxwell's decision to use re-enactors instead of real soldiers was kind of unfortunate.. Re-enactors tend to be people who have the money and leisure time to pursue such an expensive, involved hobby (middle aged men).
I would second all the praise that's been given to Stephen Lang's perfomance as Jackson, and I'll advise you not to pay any attention to reviewers who characterise the movie's characters open (and historically correct) expression of their religious faith as smarmy televangelist displays of religion. These reviewers strike me as people with a chip on their shoulder, who would most probably describe any display of Christianity in such a broad, stereotypical manner.
To finish, just let me say that, yes, people very probably did talk like that! The educated of those times lived and breathed the classics of western civilization and it was almost certainly reflected in the way they chose to speak. If you don't believe me look up the letters and writings of some of the movies characters. They are readily available on the internet.",1073692800,3,2927,4.963340122199592

I support this movie's effort, but it was definitely not what it could or should have been.
Many people complain of the movie's Christian allusions and references, but in actuality Civil War commanders were very religious, and they sought God for strength and guidance.
I enjoyed this movie, but I would not recommend it to anyone who is not a big enough follower of the Civil War to watch four hours of mainly soliloquies of perhaps one of the most skilled generals of the Confederacy.  The movie focused too much on General Jackson, and I felt that it could have been improved with separate views(like those from Gettysburg).

The movie was so long and drawn out that at times we had to rewatch  parts to refresh our memory on certain events.

1887294,1,B00009OOFB,"This movie was bad bad bad!  I was looking forward to seeing it because I liked Gettysburg and I thought it would be at least as good.  I saw this movie with a friend and when it was over all we could do is look at each other and chuckle.  ""I payed $9.50 for this?""  This is not a movie about the Civil War.  This is a movie about Gen Jackson and how he prays all the time.  I know people are religious and war makes them more so.  I know Jackson and many men on both sides of the war prayed and asked for divine guidance as their soldiers killed and died on the battlefield.  But come on!  Jackson says a prayer in almost every scene and he even has one extra hokey prayer with a slave asking God why there is slavery.  If Jackson would have thought about it for a few minutes he might have figured out that people had slaves because numbskulls like Jackson were willing to fight to protect the political institutions that fostered and supported slavery.  I think this film was an attempt to rehabilitate the Southern cause and make it more noble.  Every attempt was made to strip away the issue of slavery from the motives of the Southern cause and generals.  Big speaches are given about ""States Rights"" ""sovereignity"" and ""revolution.""  Only the damn Yankees worry about slavery when they make their long speaches.  But why were the Southerners worried about Yankee encroachment on their ""rights"" or ""sovereignity""?  Were they worried that the Northerners would make them speak with a Boston accent or stop drinking mint julips?  No the ONLY issue they were worried about was the institution of slvery.  They felt that the States had a ""right"" to allow slavery and the ""sovereignity"" to have slavery, and that God had given them the ""right"" by His divine approval in the Bible for the institution of slavery (as a positive social good as John C. Calhoun would say.) Seeing Gen Jackson standing there with a slave as they both pray to God about slavery was just too much for me to take.  Maybe that is why God let the North kick the crap out of the South in the Civil War.  The North was right, the South was wrong, the end.  I cannot recommend this movie.  And in case you are wondering, My Great Great Grandfather fought for the South in the Civil War.  He was a poor farmer and did not own one slave.  But he got shot by the Yankees and died of his wounds after the war in 1868.",1073260800,13,2384,4.365909090909091
1887295,3,B00009OOFB,"I have been waiting for a producer to make the Civil War equivalent of Saving Private Ryan. God's and Generals is not it.
The film covers secession to Gettysburg, and since this is the period of the war that was dominated by the South, our focus is there, with Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee. This is Gods and Generals' strong point, in telling us the story from an unfamiliar perspective, the South's, showing us that they were God-fearing men and women who believed they were doing the right thing in defending their own land, which was being invaded by a rebel force (the North.)
Despite the epic length and acting, there is really nothing epic about this film. In fact, it's so generic you're not even sure what battle you're in or who's fighting in it. Every southerner has the same, overdone fake accent and speaks in maxims, as though there is a scribe there to write down everything that comes out of their mouth. Apparently, because we have some proverbial-style quotes from people of this era the screenwriters assumed everyone just *talked* like this. With every awkward burst of dialogue you feel like the stage should darken with a spotlight on the orator, as he/she gives us a lengthy dictum about the state of humanity. Others in the room crease their lips and exchange solemn gazes, all to aware of the weight of their undertaking.
This is called the ""romanticizing of history"" and I thought Ronald Maxwell (the director) would be above it. I suppose we all have an image in our heads of these noble people conscious of their place in history, knowing future generations would be scrutinizing their every letter or speech. Of course they didn't know, any more than we are aware of our place in history right now. But don't try telling that to the characters in Gods and Generals. They say every line and give every speech with the same emotion that we read those things on the page - teary-eyed and fully aware of their implications. However, we have the benefit of 150 years of knowing how these people would affect history; they did not. The power of a historical film should *not* be in seeing the actors deliver lines their characters are famous for saying, with all the angst of history behind them. Why? *Because they didn't have the angst of history behind them when they actually said it.* What makes a historical film great is watching a character deliver a line in an ordinary way, loading it with a wryness that only we, on the other side of history, can fully understand.
Gods and Generals is essentially a blur of battle-speeches, poor Maine accents, clichd slaves and PG-13 battle scenes. For anyone truly interested in the Civil War, and willing to invest the hours that this film requires, you would do much better to get the Ken Burns DVD series. The facts are presented in the right way, to make you understand that these were just normal men and women who were only doing what they knew to be the right thing, not self-aware ""Gods and Generals"" who knew they were on the stage of history for all to see.",1073260800,7,3043,4.637037037037037

1887297,1,B00009OOFB,"This is a film about the battles of Fredericksberg and Chancerloville. It is apparently the first of a trilogy that attempts to be some sort of history of the Eastern Campaigns of the American Civil War. The film is told largely from a Confederate perspective with portraits of the Generals Lee and Jackson. The Union side is represented but by more lowly ranked soldiers.
Historically the two battles portrayed were significant Confederate victories and led to Lee feeling confident enough to launch his disastrous Gettysberg campaign.
Most treatments of the American Civil war see it as an epic struggle in which both sides are glorified. The North, representing the ideals of modern Enlightenment and the South as romantic freedom fighters. One would think however that there is a stronger case for presenting the struggle as a war of bungling amateurs.
Sherman in his memoirs characterises the battle of Bull Run as that of bumbling amateurs. The North not able to launch an attack and the South not able to destroy the Union forces after inflicting a defeat. The battles that followed repeated the pattern. McClelland must surely rank as one of the worst generals in the history of warfare. He led a huge army into the South and when attacked by Lee simply retreated. Although Lee has been for years portrayed as a genius his tactics could only work against a fool such as McCelland. Any other general worth his salt would have noticed that Lee had expended the lives of his soldiers at such a rate that he would not have been able to defend against a counter attack.
After McCelland was sacked the command of the Union forces moved to Burnside who launched the disastrous Fredericksberg campaign. He ordered his men to ford a river and to attack piecemeal well fortified confederate positions. Another disastrous defeat saw Hooker take over the responsibility for the Northern forces and this led to the disastrous Chanceroville campaign. Despite having overwhelming numbers Hooker was again able to lose. Lee split his forces and using heavily wooded country sent Jackson around the rear of the Union Army to take them by surprise. This tactic worked and another Confederate victory. Of course against a general of moderate competence this strategy would not have worked. If one held firm then Lee was happy to simply destroy his armies by pointless attacks. Something discovered by General Meade at Gettysberg.
The film adopts the epic struggle approach. The incompetence of  Burnside is acknowledged but Chancerloville is seen as a tactical masterpiece by Lee and Jackson.
The film is split between a number of battle scenes and some human interest scenes with most of the human interest scenes dealing with Jackson. The battle scenes do not look that realistic. They look more like overweight civil war fans doing re-enactments. Some of the things portrayed are inaccurate such as the use of exploding artillery charges and the sight of infantry loading guns with the bayonets fixed.
The human interest scenes are generally ponderous an often like tableaus. There is little dialogue and it unnatural and staged.  Still not doubt it will be a great hit with civil war buffs.",1073088000,5,3183,5.003773584905661
1887298,5,B00009OOFB,"After seeing the movie & reading several reviews, it is obvious that the problems that resulted in the civil war have not been resolved, & need to be addressed. I thought the movie was an excellent attempt to historical accuracy, while still making a small profit for the investors, on a limited budget. Massive sets would have been costly & would not have added that much to the movie. Although wordy, much of the dialog was gleaned from the letters written & saved from the time, & people did & do speak as they write. But by being less bloody & gory, its makes the film viewable by the very young, who truly need to be the ones to learn the 'lessons' of the civil war. The remaining problems still need to be resolved, & we must learn to forgive both the North & South for the transgressions of the other, & move on as a stronger, more powerful nation, respecting the views of each. I spent 20 years in active military service & another 15 as a civilian & reservist. I have served with all five services & lived in both Northern, Southern & Western states. Although born in Ohio, I hold no specific allegiance to any other than the ONE United States of America - Under God. This movie is certainly worth seeing, & investing in a copy for ones own home library, along with Gettysburg, The Last Full Measure & the PBS series ""The Civil War"", recognizing that we can only gather as much information as possible, & each one make our own decisions. I will submit that had we not remained one, United States, our efforts during Worlds War I & II may have come out much differently.",1073088000,4,1578,4.407534246575342
1887299,3,B00009OOFB,"The era of the Civil War, a time of great conflict in our nation, has been of great interest to many who study the history of the United States. The Civil War was the bloodiest conflict on American soil for many years and the last great war to be fought in our own country. As southern states quickly succeeded from the Union, young men of the north were asked to help fight the rebels who wanted to rip this great nation apart. The North fought for preservation of the Union while the South fought for state rights and the preservation of slavery. The war was hard on everybody as brother fought against brother, sons against their fathers, families against families. No war had ever divided a nation so greatly as this one. The film Gettysburg, original planned for television viewing only until it was decided to be released into theaters, gave a glorious view into possibly the greatest and most well known battle of the Civil War. Though the film was not a box office success, it was glorified for its artistic merit. Can the prequel Gods and Generals do the same or will the lengthy film be killed in action?
The story follows the early days of the Civil War all the way up to right before the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Much of the focus of the film follows T.J. Jackson, who is commander of the Virginia division for the Confederate army, but the film also follows around General Robert E. Lee, who is in charge of the Army of Northern Virginia, and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who is an officer in charge of the 20th Main division of the Union. Several battle are shown within the course of the film including the Battle of 1st Bull Run, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville. The story for Gods and Generals is well done but there is some disappointment. There was a feeling that the film spent too much time involved in the small stories and speeches then on the battles that actually occurred within the early days of the Civil War. The fact that the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest battle in the Civil War, was not included in the film was of huge disappointment. There was also too much confusion trying to keep track of so many personal stories that it became too much within the course of the four hour film.
It is hard to focus on just one performance with a film such as Gods and Generals but maybe it is best to focus more on the lead characters then anything else. Possibly the best role within the film was performed by Stephen Lang, who portrayed Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson. Lang gave a stirring performance as ""Old Blue Eyes"" showing the great difference of Jackson's actions on and off the battlefield. Jackson's death at the end of the film should bring many historians to tears for being so dramatic. Another fabulous portrayal was of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain performed by Jeff Daniels, who was in the film Gettysburg as well. It was kind of disappointing that he is not seen at the end of the film to transition into the film Gettysburg but not a huge flaw. Robert Duvall takes over for Martin Sheen as Robert Edward Lee in the prequel to the famous film. Duvall has the look down as well as some famous lines from the Confederate general but Lee is not seen much within the film which is quite disappointing as the ads make it seem like he is the main focus. There are too many small performances to make huge note of but they are brilliantly performed by this great cast.
Overall, Gods and Generals is a good film on the Civil War but not a spectacular one. With success in many areas comes some failures. The time length was too much at a stunning four hours but the intermission was well placed. Some conflicts involving the Southern view of slavery and blacks in the army argues against historic records. The focus of the film also seemed to be too Southern biased as much focus was placed with the Union as much as the South. The biggest disappointment was exclusion of the Battle of Antietam, which Jackson was a part of. Though there were errors, the film wasn't all disappointing. Civil War buffs will be proud to hear lines like ""He may have lost his left arm but I lost my right"" from Lee or Jackson saying, ""Let us rest under the shade of the trees"" right before he dies. Another great surprise was the inclusion of songs like ""Dixie"" and ""Bonnie Blue Flag"" though the film could have included some Northern songs as well. The original song ""Going Home"", which can be heard in the opening of the film, was masterfully well done. Gods and Generals does what it was set out to do which was to give an epic portrayal of the early days of the Civil War. Though some may be disappointed with the toned down versions of famous battles, they will be happy to see that history can be brought to life in such splendor.",1072742400,3,4761,4.511574074074074
1887300,5,B00009OOFB,"Gods and Generals is one of those movies not done justice at the box office. But it seems a lot of people made up for it by getting the DVD. Perhaps it was the movie's length that put people off sitting in the theater. I am sorry I missed the spectacle of seeing it on the big screen, but having bought the DVD, I rejoice in possessing this well-made and stirring film.
I commend Creighton Lovelace for his insightful review and roundly chastize Cheryl Zaleski for her patronizing and insulting remarks. I did not grow up in this country and so got my understanding of the American Civil War from Hollywood, as many non-Americans would. I imbibed the common and flawed view that it was all about slavery. It seems any other history about the reasons for the war was suppressed until recently. Now we have books like The Real Lincoln, by Thomas DiLorenzo. Now it is not only die-hard descendants of Confederates who know the truth - that Lincoln had far less noble reasons for invading the south.
There are many remarkable things about this movie, but what is really striking is its devotion to authenticity, probably more than any other movie made about the Civil War. And this from the funding and production of arch-liberal Ted Turner. What a shock! It seems Ted does have some redeeming values. Any story about the life of ""Stonewall"" Jackson that diminishes or ignores his Christian faith does not honor the man or history. In this movie we are blessed to see how profoundly Jackson's faith guides his relationship with his wife, his response to the Virginia secession and his life as a soldier. He had a difficult task at a tragic time in history, but he responded with prayerful deliberation. We see him praying with his wife, with a black cook working for the Confederate Army (both voicing their petition for God's justice to be done), and before doing battle.
With this sometimes word for word dialogue from official historical documents and personal diaries, and with the battle scenes often re-enacted in real time, some people could get bored with this movie. But that is to miss its value as a documentary drama, an antidote to decades of misinformation about the Civil War. We could do with more re-appraisal of Lincoln's saintly status, delving deeper into his ambitions (and success) in creating a highly centralized, activist state as opposed to the limited form of government intended by the founding fathers. Also the revelations that Lincoln never believed in racial equality.
As for the reviewer who complained about the army uniforms being inauthentic, you are obviously wrong because this production went to great pains to recreate exact duplicates of the various uniforms. Also, do you think every footsoldier would be personally outfitted in a form-fitting uniform? Duh, with a war on you don't exactly have time. See the behind the scenes feature ""The Authenticities of the Film."" The same goes for using Harper's Ferry for Fredericksburg.

The battle scene I saw was quite well done, but everything else was slow, preachy, and painfully obvious.  It is a sad movie when the extras (probably Civil War reenactors who do this sort of thing on the weekends) were more engaging than the main characters.  The dialog was stilted, and the actors gave us neither grand passion nor subtlety.  I would've given it ""zero"" stars, but that wasn't an option.",1072051200,12,545,4.42

""Gods and Generals"" focused very heavily on the military leaders such as Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson and Joshua Chamberlain. Time spent showing us Jackson talking to God time and again (ALRIGHT! We GET it, Jackson is a spiritual man!), or Chamberlain quoting literature (as inspiration?) just before going into battle, could have been deleted without taking anything away from the film. Or, better yet, that time could have been devoted to showing some of the average soldier's life, or citizens of Virginia discussing secession, or even some of the Virginia legislature, which had to involve some passionate arguments.
The redundancy was also hard to get past - how many times do we have to hear soldiers quote some variation of ""To those about to die, I salute you""? Or see every brigade involved in one battle, clearly labled for the viewing audience, charging through the same spot of woods and up the same hill? The actors that seemed so inspired in Gettysburg feel like they are merely going through the motions on this one.
The third part to this trilogy still holds some promise; let's hope they keep it shorter and more engaging.",1071964800,10,1389,4.914893617021277

In the first 2 hours and 15 minutes there are two battles. The first one lasts all of three minutes, and the second one was the only thing that kept me from walking out at that point. Then there was the intermission! Gee, I don't know if I can handle another hour and a half of that much excitement! If I wanted to see people revel in the confedracy and praise god in the same breath, I could have tuned in to Jimmy Swaggert marathon instead, and saved myself the trouble.

The very little authentic dialogue between the characters resulted in not really even caring about their fates.

I must agree with most of the Amazon reviewers, ""a lost chance at telling a great story."" A line-up of great actors cannot salvage the poor dialogue and action sequences, and lack of historical perspective in this movie.
Forget any notion that this film will tell the South's long suppressed and much warranted provocation for battle. The film focuses a great deal on Stonewall Jackson, but mostly in his bonding with a child while wintering between battles.
The film supplants motivation on the part of its participants.
You'll hear melodramatic conversations between the great Civil War officers (Jackson, Chamberlain, Lee) and their wives and associates; explaining ""why I am going to war for this side or against that."" Unfortunately, these conversations are more revealing of the director's missed desire to hit a theatrical high note than a historical revelation. You'll also view exchanges between ""common soldiers"", trying to encapsule those elements, opposite of their noted leaders, rooted in simplicity and humor in the face of great events and tragedy. Simple, but not endearing. I was little stirred by any character in this movie.
The war scenes are not very telling of historical significance or bearing much resemblance to the likeness of battle. My pulse gradually slowed watching these scenes, but I did remain awake. An amazon reviewer wrote that he cheered for the Rebels and booed the Yanks like a sporting event. What else could make these scenes entertaining except perhaps consuming a large quantity of alcohol and imagining naked women, wearing only bandoliers and carrying muskets, charging Stonewall's brigade at Bull Run while he fires rose petals from a Napolean Smoothbore.
Most all wars, especially the U.S. civil war, contain a wealth of story-telling opportunity. This opportunity was squandered. It is my fortune to know many of the stories, but I cannot thank Gods and Generals for any enlightenment. In short, the movie seemed to aspire for epic proportions, but I fear will fall into the category of so many outdated 'made for T.V. historical dramas""... Soon forgotten.",1070928000,4,2225,5.183333333333334

The first hour could have been cut down to about 15 minutes without the hokey dialogue between Stonwall Jackson and himself, and God.  This DVD is the Southern Apologetic for the Civil War on a much grander scale than Gettsyburg, which was much more fair and balanced.  The good parts to this DVD were the movie camerawork was brilliant, but it just moved along way too slow.  A smaller version may have been a lot better.

1887307,5,B00009OOFB,"I finally had the opportunity to watch _Gods and Generals_ last night. I watched it, my wife went to bed after 2 hours of the 4 hours, partly because she needed to get up to go to work this morning, but mostly because i think she gets tired of me cheering for Johnny Reb. I am an unashamed Southern sympathizer even though i was raised in southern California, it may very well be genetic however as my mom's people come from the Eastern Shore of Maryland and the one time i met my grandfather it was pretty obvious he was Southern. I watched the movie, absorbed by the characters, heart raced by the battle scenes, in tears at the horror and destruction of war. I yelled at the lines of foolish men throwing their lives into a pit as the walked into the hail of cannonfire and minibullets (come to think of it my wife might of disliked that part to), laughed as 1 of the 3 main characters hailed from Maine (my wife's adopted state), a college professor of history and philosophy, but warmed up to him as he quoted Julius Caesar's crossing the Rubicon at length just before a battle. So in general i acted like a crazy football fan at the finals, cheering the Gray and booing the Blue.
But as i reflect upon the movie, it is the Christianity of the Generals that comes through most strongly, and here i am as little impartial as i am to the participants. I share in the conservative faith of Jackson, i think Robert Dabney is one of the best theologians America has ever raised up. I was truely amazed that a movie would be done in modern secular anti-theistic America where the lead characters really pray, really believe, really love the Lord, (Wow, how did that get past the censors?) or be thought to make any money? Their faith is not dumbed down, the hard parts are presented as in where Jackson sits and cries for the death of a little girl by scarlet fever as his men remark-but he didn't cry for all the men we've lost. The minority view of the war is presented straight forward at several places: the Civil War as the Second American Revolution, the role of the Irish, slavery as a side issue not the important one, the contradictory role of the races in Jackson's praying with his black cook, or the protection of a white family's house by their brave women slave and her children and her talk to northerners about wanting to be free, for example. I had even hoped that somewhere on the extra disk would be several alternative endings where the South won.
And this is where my thinking is pushed by this most extraordinary movie, alternatives. They all revolve around the Faith and slavery, Biblical Christianity and ethnic relationships where a history of such epic proportions and such real horror intertwine with fundamental principles and good sound religious belief. This is the great value of the movie being as true as it possibly can to the historical conditions of the Civil War, for it was a religious as well as an economic, (industrial v. agarian), political (right to sucession), or what-have-you war. This is often minimized in our era of weak believism, mild feelings about religious things, a general feelings that religion isn't a great motivator, money and politics are. Well, secular America meet your great great grandparents, see their religious beliefs mirrored in the young suicide bombers in Israel, or the car bombers in Iraq. Religious beliefs are worth dying and even killing for, today as they where in 1861-4.
But it is in the mixture of truth and error that the movie hints at in the relationship of the races that is to me the takehome message that i need to dwell on, for those issues are not finished in today's America and the war was finished so long ago. Jackson (not in the movie but in real life) knelt with slaves in church, praying to the same Lord. Lee owned slaves, Dabney defended slavery in a book 20 years after the war. The South did fight to preserve the 'peculiar institution', slavery, abolitionists where Christians as well, although often Unitarians not Presbyterians. And this is where the present hits 1861 headon, and the power and the bright coloration of history so as to make it alive and real in the movie has great value. This is the extraordinary opportunity that the movie gives us, to revisit and re-evaluate our past, as if the issues are meaningful to us, important to us as they were to Jackson, or Lee, or whats-his-name you know the Maine guy. That is why i recommend even Yankees to watch the movie, to learn what moved our ancestors in a way that a book just can't do.

For those that have seen Gettysburg, Martin Sheen presents Robert E. Lee as a weak, limp wristed and insecure character. Duval's strength of character can only be rated as ""Oscar"" quality.
  Even more descriptive and the majority of the movie was Stonewall's character which was also awe inspiring.

1887309,3,B00009OOFB,"I really don't understand some of the negative criticism this movie has received.  First, people like to throw the term ""Lost Cause"" around.  As someone who has spent a good amount of time studying the Confederacy and ""Lost Cause"" writings, I don't see it in this film.  Essentially, the ""Lost Cause"" theory, advanced by Jubal Early and others, was that the South fought bravely for its independence from an opporessive North, but despite the valor of its generals and soldiers, it was overwhelmed by Northern resources and manpower.  It generally slights Union valor and generalship, and expresses pro-slavery  and racist sentiments.  Now, how is that directly present in this movie?  Northern soldiers are portrayed equally as valiantly as Southern.  Union generalship in the moive is portrayed as it was in 1861-3--bad.  I also don't think the movie in any way depicts the Union's victory as inevitable.  The movie ends with the greatest of Lee's victories--Chancellorsville.  Some have criticized for downplaying the role of slavery as a cause of the war.  I defy anyone to find one single pro-slavery element in this film.  Well, neither Lee nor Jackson fought for slavery.  Their characters are accuratly portrayed for the most part.  Jackson, if anything, could be been played as even more eccentric.  But the filmakers capture the great contrast of his being a fanatically religious man, and yet a cold-blooded killer in war at the same time.  It is, however, disappointing Antietam and the major outcome of the battle (the Emancipation Proclamation) were not at all included in film.  In that sense, the movie does fail to deal with the transformation of the war from one for the old union to one for a new union.  In any case this is not a work of history.  It is historical fiction and essentially the stories of three men:  Lee, Jackson, and Chamberlain.
Is the movie flawed?  Certainly.  First, the subject matter is just too large for a 3.5 hour treatment.  We jump from Manassas to Fredericksburg, with virtually no reference to what happens in the mean time.  A lot of time is wasted with sappy, and poorly acted scenes involving several Virginia families.  Why we need Ted Turner and Robert Byrd cameos is utterly beyond me.  It was probably a mistake to turn this into a theatrical movie, and would have made a much better miniseries.
I would say its strengths far outweigh its weaknesses though.  Despite some poor acting, the main cast is quite good, with Stephen Lang's Jackson being the highlight.  The only problem I have with his performance is that I can, at times, see his General Pickett from ""Gettysburg"" coming through.  The look of the movie is very good, and the battle scenes are quite stunning (though a bit sanitized).  Personally, I also really enjoyed the score.  The DVD itself is a major let-down.  The special features range from moderatly interesting to utterly pointless.  No deleted scenes.  I sense Turner is going to at some point release an extended version of this ala Lord of the Rings.
So, give this film a chance and accept it for what it is:  A mostly accurate piece of historical fiction that would have made a better mini-series than a movie.",1070064000,5,3194,4.871747211895911
1887310,1,B00009OOFB,"I'm a lover of Civil War history and could barely sit through this one - to say there was poor editing would be an understatement. The surrender of Harper's Ferry to Jackson right before Sharpsburg, the last minute arrivial of A.P. Hill could have been done with excellent effect instead of the overly long Fredericksburg episode, which as a battle was inconclusive to both sides. Very unfortunate - a lost opportunity to tell a great story.",1069459200,10,441,4.815789473684211
1887311,1,B00009OOFB,"Gods and Generals is the worst Civil War Film I have ever seen.  The film has many major flaws, but by far the worst is the dialog.  The characters do not interact with each other; they make long, contrived, speeches.  Joshua Chamberlain tells his wife that he is going off to war; he does so in a twenty minute speech.  She, chagrined by his decision and worried for his safety, responds with a twenty minute speech of her own.  The actors do their best, but it appears on screen as if they are being used as talking statues, the dialog is so stilted and contrived that there is no opportunity for them to actually act.
The film's best sequence, the attack on Fredericksburg, is marred by bad model work in its opening scene; the train and town are unconvincing, but it bounces back with an excellent depiction of the bridging and street fighting in the town.  Then, just as it's about to reach its climax, time for a speech!  The action stops and we are treated to Joshua Chamberlain reflecting on war.  Then they march off to the stone wall.
It has to be remembered that ten years separate the making of Gettysburg and Gods and Generals, and the most of the lead actors in this movie look ten years older.  Jeff Daniels and C. Thomas Howell, look oddly out of place when compared to Gettysburg because of this.
Stephen Lang does a credible job as Stonewall Jackson but this film does not portray Jackson as he was.  He was the prototypical religious warrior who thrived on battle.  They called him ""Old Blue Light"" because it was said he actually glowed during combat.  He was full of eccentricities that were a key part of his character.  The film barely brushes these critical traits, instead demonstrating his religious fervor through a series of impromptu prayers, including one while he is in bed with his wife!
Finally the soundtrack fails to enhance this movie at all.  It does not compliment the action or the time period.  It's almost like Bob Dylan is sitting behind you humming off-key though the whole film.

In summary, buy Gettysburg and enjoy it, no film portrays the Civil War more accurately or in a more entertaining way.  Leave Gods and Generals on the store shelf, unless you suffer from insomnia, which this film will cure instantly.",1069200000,16,2257,4.616541353383458

First of all I'm from Texas so I'm not a yankee...even as a true southern I was disappointed by the delieverance of Gods and Generals- I read the book loved it but, hated the movie first of all the acting done in this is like watching a REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY bad high school performance-frankly it-
SUCKS...
it so over-dramatic...
Not to mention the epic long battle scenes that go on and on by the end of the first battle you won't care about who won the war anymore...
Their is alot of religious stuff involved in this movie so if your not a very religious person you will not enjoy this movie...
The only thing that I found remotely interesting about Gods and Genrals is the fact that it finally depicted the South's view of the war which I wouldn't say is biasis so much as ""new look"" which was refreshing to see...so if your interested in seeing what the South has to say then see the movie or read the book...
But warning you will see little to no info on the North's view in this film...You'll end up wondering who the hell the South is fighting anyway....

It looks at events largely through the eyes of the Confederacy, which was a bit of a shock, and it spends most of its time focusing on General Stonewall Jackson, another shock. It reveals the religious faith of the period in all its fullness: more shocking still! And it shows a black siding with the South and Southerners talking about discarding slavery. Can this be? How refreshing to see a movie with such integrity which is able to portray in such a human terms the tragic drama of the Civil War era.",1068595200,14,672,4.56198347107438
1887314,3,B00009OOFB,"As a student from a major university I had big expectations for this movie.  I had read the book by Jeff Shaara, a nice read even if he exaggerates the truth too much, and therefore thought this movie would be good for Civil War historians because it could reach out to the public.  I believe Ron Maxwell tried too hard making this movie ""great"".  He focused on the wrong people.  Chamberlain was a small piece of the puzzle at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville and his quoting of Caesar before his charge at Fredericksburg was too much for me.  Maxwell should have focused more on Hancock or perhaps Meade who were directly involved with the fighting at Fredericksburg.  Maxwell also gave important people such as Robert E. Lee, Burnside, Hooker, Longstreet, and others little or no screen time.  In doing so he fails to tell the whole story and therefore is historically inaccurate. Also, it seemed to me that every time a person spoke the impression was a speech was being delievred,no matter if it was two friends doing small chatter.  The dialogue at times was too careful to detail.  Its no wonder the movie did so poorly for not many historians I know went to see it and the public caught on very quickly that this was not worth 3-4 hours of their time.

I do give Maxwell credit for making good battle scenes and presenting Stonewall Jackson mostly accurately.  Maybe in the future new Civil War films will focus on being historically accurate and being shorter in length.  I wasn't thrilled with sitting in a theater for 4 hours and neither was the rest of America.",1068508800,4,1576,4.670289855072464
1887315,5,B00009OOFB,"As I reviewed the so-called reviews I couldn't help but notice that all but 1 of the 'low-ratings' stemmed from those persons located outside of the Confederate States of America. As many know, to the victors belong the spoils (i.e. - Winners write history the way THEY wnat to) that is why former Confederates used the Pen instead of the Sword to retaliate against the Yankee Propaganda machine. Notice the Southern Historical Society Papers (52 Vols); Confederate Military History (12 Vols); The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government by President Jefferson Davis (2 Vols); The Coming of the Glory and Facts the Historians Leave Out by John S. Tilley (ca. 1940s). I could continue about the scores of supressed books out of print today like: United States ""History"" as the Yankee Takes and Makes It (pub. 1900); Things the South Didn't Fight For (pub 1917 by UDC). Thus we see from those who lived through it that the conflict was instigated by the United States when they Invaded another nation called the Confederate States of America. Over what? Taxes, Revenue, and Land Posession. Only after numerous defeats and possible European Recognition of the CSA did Lincoln throw out the Race Card (Emancipation Proclamation) which freed no slaves at all. Thus it is the beautiful thing about Gods and Generals, we are allowed to re-live 1861-1863 through the eyes of Gen. Thomas J. ""Stonewall"" Jackson, and too keep people happy Through Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlin's eyes. Jackson and Lee were fierecly devoted Christian men (not fanatics) and led their men into battle expecting the Lord's Will to be accomplished. Even the tragic wounding of Gen Jackson is portrayed accurately if compared with Dr. Hunter Holmes McGuire's attestment of the situation as seen in the Southern Historical Society Papers. Without Yankee Propaganda and 21st Century Commentary the movie Gods and Generals presents one of those rare opportunities to see things as they really are. As a Pastor, SCV commander, and descendant of brave Confederate soldiers I HIGHLY recommend this movie.

Although a lot of the complaints about this movie have to do with its length at 4 hours I actually think the longer version may be more watchable/coherent, since I thought a number of the scenes and characters seemed abbreviated and did little beyond supplementing the dominant character of Jackson.

1887317,5,B00009OOFB,"The film starts slowly. Like all good historicaly accurate dramas, the film makers take a few minutes early to establish a few background facts.
After the groundwork has been laid, the story begins as the state of Virginia votes to leave the union. The Civil War has begun.
The small stories, within the story, here are the secret. We see insights into the personality that was Thomas (Stonewall) Jackson. We get to see him as a sensitive, God fearing man, who belived in his cause.
My own personal favorite Civil War hero, Jashua Lawrence Chamberlain, is also portried as a dedicated, God fearing man, who has learned that war, especially a civil war, changes the dynamics of any cause.
The film has tender moments that underscore the fact that life went on regardless of the hardships impossed by war. We see a Christmas scene at a Southern Mansion the shows life as normal while the reality of the day was this aweful war being waged within miles of where they took pause to celibrate. Life continued and there were fleeting moments of personal joy.
The battle scenes are graphic without being overly bloody. You get the sense of just how aweful the kind of warfare that was waged in this war realy was.
I have two of the three films in this trilogy. (Gettysburg & Gods and Generals) Both of these wonderful docu-dramas help to advance the understanding of this terrible event in our past.",1067040000,4,1392,4.685714285714286
1887318,3,B00009OOFB,"While this prequel to ""Gettysburg"" most definitely had the booming action of adventure films, it's really more about the lives of its characters, such as the legendary ""Stonewall Jackson"" who is played by Stephen Lang. It charts the early years of the Civil war from Manassas to the Battle of Fredericksburg. It explores the days of the Soldiers and their leaders and examines the lives those who waited back at home for their loved ones to return.
While I thought that GODS AND GENERALS was a great movie, I feel that it did not reach it's full potential, as far as violence goes. Maybe they wanted it to be this way, or maybe not. The should have opened their minds to what the civil war was actually like, and not let their authenticity be severely compromised for the endlessly long scenes of dialogue because of the pg-13 discretion. Still, this part of the trilogy was extremely well done and I feel, putting it's authenticity aside, it is a great way to be able to get the feel of the Civil war, without having to actually be there.

I had read the poor reviews of the theatre release but thought them misguided- 'Gettysburg' turned out fantastic and I figured surely 'Gods and Generals' would be even better.  What a disappointment it turned out to be. This movie sets a new standard for over-stuffed oration.  To those who actually sat through this movie in the theatre, I commend you.  The amount of pontificating in this movie simply gets in the way of a strong story and made for long passages of outright boredom.  This is a movie made for DVD only in the sense that it is easy to skip over the speeches to the battle scenes, which are well done, but even then not as good as 'Gettysburg'.  Note to the director of the last installment in this series:  tone down on the oration, develop a few main characters, and maintain the excellence in the battle reenactments.  Then you will have done service not only to the Shaara series but also to those who look forward to the very rare historical movie made these days.",1066348800,6,1065,4.510416666666667
1887320,4,B00009OOFB,"I can definitely see why this movie might not have appealed to the average film audience.  While it definitely has the ""boom"" and ""action"" of adventure films, it really is more of a study of personalities, and moves almost as slowly as the Civil War itself.  It is, however, a fascinating and very real portrayal of war and its effects, not only on its participants, but on its own rationale.  The latter is something with which most of the audience has become more intimately familiar with the Western world's recent involvement in war and politics in the Middle East and the changes in rationale that occurred to justify it.
When the credits first began to role at the beginning of this film and I realized that Ted Turner, who lives himself in Georgia, was its primary motivator, I anticipated that Gods and Generals would be a document of purely Southern sympathy, which to some extent it is.  The movie was based on a book by the same title, which I have yet to read, so I have no idea what the author's original intention might have been.  I have to admit that although the film focuses on the colorful personalities of the generals-as its title implies it will-it doesn't hesitate to confront the issues that modern audiences would expect of it.  It does, however, deal with them in a rather patronizing way.  The issues of the South defending its homeland and way of life, the heretofore unaddressed issue of constitutional right of secession, states rights verses the rights of the central government to maintain the nation's integrity, and the failure of the founding fathers to resolve the paradox of slavery in the world's first real democracy, are all confronted rather politely.
Lee and Jackson speak with eloquence of the need to protect their homeland from aggression and of their being the inheritors of the mantel of their Revolutionary War forefathers.  They honestly believe that they are carrying forward the torch of freedom against the tyranny of an oppressive government as their forebearers had.  They seem almost oblivious to the paradox of slavery in the midst of this great fight for ""freedom.""  Nor does the film itself really deal with it.  Beyond the prayers of the only two black people who are allowed to be individuals on screen, slavery is seen as hardly there.  Everybody is ""family.""  Apparently some are just more ""family"" than others.  While there is a great show of the brutality of war, there is very little show of the brutality of slavery.  The movie keeps it all nice and tidy, doubtless out of respect for the delicate sensibilities of the audience.
On the plus side, it does deal with honesty the fact that neither side started out to change the status of the black population so much as to resolve the problem of the right of states to secede from the union.  As Jackson points out to his aide, if the North loses, the powers that be will retire on their earnings from war speculation; while if the South loses, it loses everything.  In effect he was all too right.  A great deal of money exchanged hands in the industrialized North during this time period.  Speculation and graft were rampant, and doubtless great fortunes were and would have been made, win or lose.  Lincoln, lionized in our own times, was reviled by many, North and South, in his own, and at times with reason.  In order to achieve some of his goals he occasionally gave away patronage to those who didn't deserve it.
As Jackson and Lee both indicate in the film, and as shown vividly, each foot of land in the South was dearly fought for by people with everything to lose.  Watching the carnage and devastation which took place almost completely on southern soil, makes the viewer realize why the Civil War is still very much alive in the hearts and minds of our southern citizens.  While many of us in the North may have ancestors who fought in the war, those of us in the South have ancestors who were fighting for their land, field by field.  While many of us in the North visit Civil War battle sites, most of us in the South live near or on them, and see them every day.  Some of the areas in the rural South have yet to recover to this very day from the devastation visited upon them by the war and its aftermath.
Robert Duval is the quintessential Robert E. Lee.  He brings the man fully to life.  His graceful portrayal, especially when he is engaged in discussing battle plans, makes the viewer feel as though present at a real moment in time, the parlay before Chancellorsville especially so.  It is impressive work.  He makes it abundantly evident that Lee was a man who understood the personalities of others.  Lee's summation of General Burnside at Fredericksburg was brilliant.  Indeed Duval's portrayal of the man makes it evident that he used his knowledge of his opponents as part of his strategy against them and did it very effectively.  (My personal favorite, not included in this film, is his summation of McClellan, that that general's biggest problem was that he had made the mistake of bringing himself to the battle.)
Although Lee is an important part of the film, the cental character is General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson, tightly portrayed by Steven Lang.  A more fitting subject for central stage would be difficult to find.  Like Lee, Jackson was a complex character.  As biography shows, he was a somewhat stiff, rather rigidly religious person, who was intolerant of the foibles of others.  Like many men of the time, his life had been crossed by a number of personal tragedies: a difficult childhood, the loss of his first wife and child, the loss of his first child by his second wife, and the alienation from a sister with whom he had once been very close because of their differences over the war.  A professor of science and artillery at Virginia Military Institute before the war, he was not particularly liked or even respected by his pupils or their families and almost lost his position because of it.  The war in fact gave him a stage upon which to exhibit his true brilliance, military strategy.  As Lee says in the film after Jackson loses his arm in battle, ""Jackson has lost his left arm; I have lost my right,"" as in essence he had.
Also giving a fine performance was Jeff Daniels as Joshua Chamberlain, a schoolmaster who raised a militia and proved particularly skillful as a military man.  He acts as the audience's moral tour guide, quoting extensively from various literary sources popular at the time among the intelligensia.  Also a real person, it's almost too bad that his story was not more fully presented.  What was shown was so tantalizing.
A great Civil War reenactment, with stellar performances by Duval, Lang and Daniels.  Rather superficial on the ""hard"" issues, but certainly adequate given the limitations of time and budget.  Impressive cinematography, but CGI portions are a little obvious.  With the above caveats noted, it might make a good instructional film for high school US history students.",1065916800,20,6985,4.74110835401158

Regardless of what the main characters in this film allegedly believed (states rights and all that) the objective fact is that they were fighting to save slavery. IF they were fighting to defend their state AND AT THE SAME TIME were planning to free slaves, then their defense of their state would be fine. But this was not the case.
Those who praise the nobility of southern leaders need to confront the ethical issue involved in holding protection of one's state as having a higher moral claim than freeing enslaved people.",1065830400,12,773,4.568345323741007
1887322,3,B00009OOFB,"I had such high hopes upon seeing this movie and now thinking back on it I really have no idea what went wrong but I can divide this review into the good parts and the bad parts
The Good
Music-Whatever my own problems with the movie were the music is not one of them weather it's ""Virginia will be heard today"" or ""I crossed the Green Mountain"" its all great.
The actors9most of them)-One of the greatest things i saw inb this movie was the actors' vallent attempts to keep it alive even after the past of the movie where I ceased to care.  Everyone, with the exception of one or two did a good job.
The Fredricksburg battle sceane-My God that was great, you have to see the movie to know what I mean.
The Bad
Several things conspired to kill this movie
Lenth-What Ted Turner and the other forces behind this movie fail to understand was my inability to keep a jumbo coke in my bladder for three and 1/2 hours
The Dialoge-Sounds like it was ripped from the classroom of the most bombastic self-absorbed english teacher on the face of the planet.  They could have done alot better.
The cast was large-I think there were something like 80 speaking parts.  You meet someone you like them and than they disappear never to be seen in the movie agian.  Am I the nly one that had a problem with this?
I loved the movie because I am a history major.  The average person who goes and rents this on a lark has to know what they are getting into.  There is a lot of detail that the average Joe sholdn't be expected to reemember.",1065657600,3,1517,4.286713286713287
1887323,3,B00009OOFB,"I bought Gods and Generals thinking it was going to be similar to Gettysburg - historically accurate, full of realistic battle scenes, and a wide and even spread of characters from both sides, with characters deep enough to understand their motivations, and the motivations of either side in the Civil War.  With the same producers, director and many of the same actors, Gods and Generals promised to be similar.
While the movie was historically accurate and the battle scenes quite realistic (though not to the point of Saving Private Ryan, say, ie it avoiding being gory), the characters were not evenly spread, mainly concentrating on Southern generals, and in particular ""Stonewall"" Jackson.  The movie seemed more like a Stonewall Jackson biography than a recounting of the first 2 years of the war, up to Chancellorsville, which it pertains to be.  Yet, if it is a movie about Stonewall Jackson, why not include Jackson's Shenandoah campaign, surely, after Chancellorsville, his greatest contribution to the Southern cause?
The other problem I had with concentrating on Jackson was that Stephen Lang was probably not the best choice of actor for the role of Jackson.  His acting seemed wooden and forced, like many of the actors in the movie, and I could not stop myself from thinking of him as Major General George Pickett, the character he played in Gettysburg.  Pickett was a very different character to Jackson, and to think of Jackson as Pickett does Jackson no favours.  Clearly the producers wanted to retain as many of the Gettyburg cast as possible, an admirable idea when they are playing the same characters as before (eg Jeff Daniels as Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, the same actors for Gen Hancock and the 20th Maine sergeant), as one recognises them immediately and can fathom how their characters fit in the time-line of the war.  Yet having Stephen Lang play Pickett in Gettysburg and Jackson in Gods and Generals makes no sense, for the reasons outlined above.  Maybe they wanted to reward him for his role in Gettysburg, and he couldn't play Pickett here, as Pickett was not a significant figure in this part of the war.
Another miscasting was Jason London as Jackson's adjutant, Captain Pendleton.  He was not believable as a military character, especially one in authority.
As Jackson was the central figure, there seemed not enough time, or inclination, to develop the other characters involved.  Jeff Daniels probably has the 2nd most screen-time and does a good job of showing us Chamberlain's motivations and philosophies.  Nobody else really appears for long enough for us to get a handle on what they're about.  I thought Robert E Lee would be explored significantly, as he was a more important figure than Jackson or Chamberlain, especially in the context of the entire war, and especially as a he was played by a major actor, Robert Duvall, but we just scratch the surface of his character.  Robert Duvall did an excellent job in the role, though.
The most irritating aspect of the entire film is the amount of grandiose speeches.  Hardly a scene goes by without someone waxing lyrical about what the war is all about, and means to them, all with accompanying stirring music.  It all becomes so predictable after a while - the movie starts starts to resemble a musical, with every scene geared towards leading into a speech/song.  While each sides motivations for fighting the war need to be explored, there are more subtle and less pretentious ways of going about it.
The producers clearly wanted to fit in as many of the famous quotes of the period too, sometimes they seem to appear in dialogue for no rhyme or reason, and, like the speeches, whole scenes are geared toward just being a platform for the quote.
This all said, there is a lot of good to be said about the movie too.  As mentioned, it was historically very accurate and it does stay pretty much on track as regards the flow of events, only wandering off for the inevitable speech-scenes.  The battle scenes are very well re-enacted and do give you a good insight into the battles of First Manassas/Bull Run, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville.  Fredericksburg was especially good, as one got to really experience how futile, pointless and courageous the Union attack was, and see how the topography of the area played a major role.  The confrontation between the two Irish brigades was an especially emotional moment.
The movie certainly did add to my knowledge of the Civil War, and should do so for anyone but the most expert of civil war buffs.
Overall, a good attempt, but it could have been better.  By spending less time on speeches and more time on the battles (maybe adding Jackson's Shenandoah campaign, to show where he really made a name for himself, and Antietam, the ultimate demonstration of callous death and destruction) and the major characters involved, and getting the right actors for the parts, the producers would have had a great movie on their hands.  Cynically, I think the producers rattled this off in a hurry to cash in on the world's current war fever, the success of Gettysburg and the current trend of movie series (like Lord of the Rings), as there is a third movie planned.",1065052800,3,5207,4.879818594104308
1887324,2,B00009OOFB,"In Ted Turner's ""Gods and Generals,"" Confederate general Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson is an impeccably noble Southern Cavalier who loves his wife and little children, and in turn is loved by his soldiers and black servants. Unlike Turner's last Civil War epic, ""Gettysburg,"" which attempted some semblance of balance, ""Gods and Generals"" is the most unabashedly pro-Southern Civil War epic since ""Gone with the Wind,"" or even ""Birth of a Nation.""  Southern commanders (and for that matter, nearly every Southern character in this exasperatingly long-winded movie) are portrayed as Bible-quoting speech mongers .  The Southern blacks are, every one of them, loyal to their masters.
This is not history, but a misguided crusade to canonize Jackson and the ""Lost Cause,"" which manages to both bore and offend.  As a Civil War buff, and having appreciated Turner's willingness to stick to the script of Shaara's wonderful book ""Killer Angels"" in the movie ""Gettysburg,"" I was willing to give ""Gods and Generals"" a try.  But by the time the Disneyland minstrel show arrives to sing the ""Bonnie Blue Flag"" to Lee, Jackson and assembled officers including the grinning Ted Turner, it was hard to fight the urge to smash the DVD player.  A heathy dose of Rhett Butler's cynicism from ""Gone With The Wind"" was badly needed here.  Without it, we are subjected to sonorous lectures about ""protecting the Southern way of life"", which never mention the dreaded ""s"" word - slavery.
Sorry to say, ""Gods and Generals"" is a mediocre film and a poor biopic.  ""Stonewall"" Jackson was not a saint, but a brilliant general (mostly) whose religious fanaticism, notable even by 1861 standards, and disregard for the lives of his soldiers, were legendary.  Most historians agree that he was respected by his ""foot cavalry"" for his victories but not loved.  He was a ruthless, cold-blooded killer and had no compulsion regarding executing deserters.  His students at V.M.I. thought he was a weirdo.  Unlike ""Patton,"" we don't get a feel for Jackson's well-documented faults.
The film is doubly-bad history because it doesn't even explain why Jackson was considered the South's best general.  This elephantine movie leaps from First Bull Run to Fredericksburg in late 1862, skipping over Jackson's classic Shanandoah Valley campaign, and his heroic defensive efforts at Antetiam and Second Bull Run.  If just one of these battles had been substituted for the endless speeches or languid scenes of Jackson cuddling with his wife, we'd having something to measure Stephen Lang's Jackson with. Needless to say, Jackson's lethargic performance in the Seven Days' battles outside Richmond in 1862 (where is McClellan in this movie?) are not mentioned.  The film only hints at his chronic petty warfare with other Southern commanders such as A.P. Hill.  Jackson's surprise attack at Chancellorsville is well-presented, but when Jackson is accidently shot by his own troops, the movie goes AWOL and instead devotes itself, accompanied by soaring heavenly choirs, to the slow death of the Christ-like Jackson.
What saves ""Gods and Generals"" from a single-star is Robert Duvall, as General Robert E. Lee, and the choreographed battle of Fredericksburg, which should have been the movie's sole object.  Duvall's Lee, with a twinkle in the corner of his eyes, is superior to the zombie-like performance of Martin Sheen in ""Gettysburg,"" and hints at the complexity and worldliness of the real Lee.  Better yet is the Fredericksburg battle itself, which captures the indescribable bravery and terror of Union troops senselessly marched up and knocked down the shallow hills where Lee's troops blasted cannon and rifles from behind stone walls.  The experience of the surviving Union soldiers (including Jeff Daniels' Joshua Chamberlain and the 20th Maine regiment) left exposed overnight on the chilly slopes before the Confederate lines is heartrending, as is the emotional confrontation between Union and Confederate Irish brigades facing each other across the stone wall. Turner's use of Civil War reenactors and attention to detail such as uniforms is to be commended, especially in the early scenes where Confederate troops are depicted wearing everything from Union blue to brown, red and white.
For die-hard Civil War buffs, I recommend skipping the hours of pious Southern ""if the Lord wills"" pontificating and head directly for the Fredericksburg scenes and the first day of Chancellorsville. For anyone else, stick with ""Gettysburg"", ""Glory,"" or for good history, Ken Burns' ""Civil War"" epic documentary.",1064966400,6,4573,5.292817679558011
1887325,2,B00009OOFB,The movie was interesting (to see maybe once) but there were lots of sub-plots that didn't make sense. It seems as though they couldn't decide between making it a mini-series or a movie and the end project is pretty scrambled. All and all it was an hour and a half movie crammed in to 4 hours.,1064880000,2,293,4.25
1887326,1,B00009OOFB,"This was a bad movie...bottom line!  I really don't understand why they even bothered to portray an important piece of American history so badly.  I can explain the movie in three sentances:
1.  More like a play, with old men  (bad actors) talking and deciding and then going off onto a battle won by one side or another, persistantly, throughout the movie.
2.  FOUR HOURS!
3.  There is no bad side or good side, because...God is on both sides, therefore canceling the point.
I don't exactly know how to explain it fully within one review, but all I can say is that if you want to see a movie that's about two sides battling it out, with the movie makers trying to film it from both perspectives in a way that makes it confusing, pointless and boring, and a movie that's four hours long (including the intermission) then go ahead, watch this.  But if not, be glad because then you can watch actually good movies like, say, ""Good Will Hunting!""
Bottom Line:  FOUR HOURS!!! (I give it an F)",1064793600,4,988,4.4804469273743015
1887327,5,B00009OOFB,"If this movie has a fault it is that it lacks many of the usual Hollywood romanticisms.  It is neither about the Civil War in its entirety (not even getting to the pivotal 1862 battle of Antietam, let alone the far better known Gettysburg), nor is about Southern politics - spending little time exploring the politics of the antebellum South.  Although Duvall, as Robert E. Lee (Duvall is a distant relative of General Lee) figures into the story (as he surely must), Lee is not really even the central character in this story.
What ""Gods and Generals""  is about is Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson and the first three major battles in Virginia.  This was an era when the Union army was still poorly commanded and making major, almost comical (if they hadn't been so costly in human life) errors on the battle field - errors they eventually corrected.  Although I am not usually a Ted Turner fan, my hat is off to him for helping to bank-roll the telling of this story.
This movie is (probably) less for the casual movie-goer, and much more for the student of 19th century American history.  Expect to be entertained, as ""Gods and Generals"" is a good movie with the usual cast of thousands in the battle scenes and street scenes from Fredericksburg (actually shot in the real village of Harpers Ferry, which has a lively Civil War history in its own right), but also expect to be educated.  As a prelude to viewing the movie ""Gettysburg,"" this movie is essential, as one can then get the feeling of how devastating the untimely loss of General Jackson was to General Lee.",1064793600,9,1565,4.648550724637682
1887328,2,B00009OOFB,"I have never understood the American obsession with the Civil War.  I live in Louisiana, and have always been perplexed by how southern people still use the words ""us"" and ""them"" to describe this national tragedy.  Furthermore, there is a wierd mythology surrouding the participants of our countries biggest bloodbath.  General Lee and General Grant have always been canonized as American Heroes, and their battles have been endlessly romanticized.
All of this hullabaloo is perhaps to gloss over the fact that this war involved pointless mass death.  Had the war been avoided, our country would be largely the same today.  But millions would not have been slaughtered.
Gods and Generals is rife with this same romanticism, and doesn't do the war justice.  When a movie about America's bloodiest war earns a PG-13 rating, you know you are in trouble.  Given how this film bombed at the box office, its doubtful that an ""R"" rating could have made things financially worse.  Most people who will flock to see this kind of thing are  college graduates anyway, so what gives?
The soliloquies in this film are agonizing.  The battle scenes look like a civil war re-enactment, with no blood or even broken skin.  If you want good battle scenes, without the stupid dialogue, you're better off taking a trip to one of the Southern States and checking out a civil war dramatization.
Robert Duvall, as usual, gives a good performance as General Lee.  I've always been biased when it comes to Duvall, and that is what saves this film from the dreaded one star.",1064448000,3,1549,4.870229007633588
1887329,2,B00009OOFB,"I waited oh-so anxiously for the release of ""Gods and Generals"" - anticipating a movie as good as - if not better than - ""Gettysburg""... but, left the theater wondering, ""What the ---- was THAT rubbish?!""
A title such as ""Gods and Generals"" woud lead one to believe that there would have been more focus on the various commanders during the early part of The War Between The States. Maybe a little more character development and relationship building amongst the commanders and their regiments - after all, it WAS supposed to be a ""prequel"" to the previous film. But, I soon realized what the movie was turning into: ""God and Stonewall Jackson"".
A completely one-sided view of the war, it made Jackson out to be like Christ, and the Union army of the Potomac a bunch of sad, mislead (ideologically speaking - they WERE mislead militarily speaking) bafoons. It had potential at the beginning. I felt it had captured the atmosphere surrounding the prelude to war quite well. But, after the First Bull Run segment was over, it collpased into a mess.
How can you leave out the Battle of Antietam - completely - while dealing with the first half of the war? So many great vignettes were lost in favor of such rubbish as a friendship being built between Stonewall Jackson and a little 6-year old (?) Virginia girl... (""All the daddys will come home..."") GET ME A BUCKET!!!!
I am the biggest Civil War buff I know. I'm not some old grouch, either who likes giving negative reviews on Amazon.com. I really wanted to love this movie and own in on DVD the first day it was released. But, I'm not wasting my money.
For a movie that had such potential, ""Gods and Generals"" falls flat in nearly every respect. ""Gettysburg"" remains Ron Maxwell's best effort yet.....
Can't wait to see how ""Last Full Measure"" turns out.... but, I'm looking forward to ""Cold Mountain"" more than anything else.
Added on 10/28/03:
I just read here, on another user's review, that a 6-hour DVD version will be released soon... and that many deleted scenes that were integral to this movie's success will be included there in. This, at least, gives this movie some hope of being a little more interesting. Maybe I will buy it. As it is, the theatrical release was nothing more than a long-winded, over-blown Confederate love-fest.",1064275200,3,2294,4.723192019950124
1887330,2,B00009OOFB,"""Gods and Generals"" is the second of a film trilogy based on the Schaaras' historical novels of the Civil War.  Whereas the first film, ""Gettysburg"" concentrated on its eponymous battle, GandG tells the story of the war from its inception until Chancellorsville.  The movie also follows the life of Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson during the same period.  The producers made much of their painstaking attention to historical accuracy in rendering the details.  No doubt, the uniforms, accoutrements and weapons are as accurate as it's humanly possible to recreate.  Also, the producers accepted the input from historians regarding the re-enactors in the previous film.  The main gripes were a-too old (average age was 23-25) and b-too fat, especially the Confederates.  These minor issues were corrected in GandG.  One lesson from ""Gettysburg"" went unlearned though.
As my stolen quote from Frederick the Great implies, there's just too much movie here timing out at roughly 4 hours.  Simultaneously describing the war in the Eastern theater and details of General Jackson's life is doable in a novel; it just doesn't work on screen.  Much screen time is consumed in introducing non sequitur characters/events that add nothing to moving the plot ahead (and hey, I'm a military historian).  Two examples:  as Jackson moves towards Manassas Junction, he encounters Trimble entraining troops.  He exchanges words with him, and we don't see him again, except as a callback to the previous film.  Second, at Fredericksburg we see line after line...after line of Union troops moving against Marye's heights.  But we as viewers have NO idea who these brigades and leaders are, or why they are highlighted.  Finally, the one holdover from Gettysburg is the dialogue; lifted apparently from the Schaara novel.  Neither the Schaaras nor the screenwriters seem to appreciate that 19th century written and spoken English were two different dialects.  Written English was very flowery and indirect:  exactly what the characters recite, making every conversation sound like speechifying.  Speaking of actors, Stephen Lang's Jackson is excellent, though not as eccentric or politically incorrect as in history.  He was a hypochrondriac among other things and believed slavery ""ordained by God"".  Duvall's Lee is better rendered than Sheen's though reduced to the marble-man by the script.  Jeff Daniels reprises his outstanding role as Chamberlain.  The history's excellent but gets in the way of the story. With aggressive editing an outstanding 21/2 hour movie about the war or Jackson is in here, somewhere.  Slightly recommended for the historical detail.",1064102400,2,2639,5.393643031784841
1887331,4,B00009OOFB,"Once you remember that movies are made to entertain, you can put the content and presentation into perspective.
The movie focuses on a narrow subset of events/battles involving the Confederate general Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson. In particular the battles presented in the movie are First Manassas, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. The battles happened from July 1861 to May 1863. The feel I got from the movie was that these battles took place over a much shorter period of time (even though the movie includes a little date stamp at the bottom of the screen prior to each battle).
Historically, the movie provides an adequate rendering of the events in question. Consider that Gods and Generals presents three battles and an attempted wartime biography of Thomas Jackson in a period of about 4 hours, whereas Gettysburg presents a single battle in about the same time. Details had to be cut and liberties taken, but aside from a somewhat choppy feeling at times, the movie comes off fairly well. The picture and sound are well done. The acting is believable and well cast.

1887332,5,B00009OOFB,"After reading some of the many negative reviews about this film, I almost fell into the trap of not ordering it..
However now that I have taken the plunge I am so very glad I purchased it  and have watched it three times already.
We bought the book of the film first which has the script at the back, and was hoping to see included the Battle of Antietam plus John Wilkes Boothes involvement  but the DVD I received is only 219 mins long yet is long enough to hold total interest without having to take time out for bathroom and tea stops.
I am not critical about clean uniforms and perfectly combed hair, even after sustained fighting, and nights sleeping with the dead. However, I was surprised to see how ""Chamberlain"" and his Segeant had aged and become plumper from Gettysburg into this prequel..
But I cannot and will not fault the fim...I am a Civil War buff of many years standing, and these films have served to turn the written word into how it was..
The script represents the era and I feel the critics must take this into account and forget the Schwarzenneger/Willis type of script translation..
I look forward to the final part of the trilogy and can only offer the highest praise to Mr Maxwell for his two films of the Civil War..

1887333,4,B00009OOFB,"When this particular movie was released in the theaters, I definitely wanted to see it, but who ""really"" wants to sit in a theater for four hours; hence the decision to wait until its much anticipated release on DVD.  Given several months anticipation, I'm glad to say that I wasn't ""thoroughly"" disappointed, but slightly put aback by the ""dry"" nature of this film.  Dramatically, this film just doesn't put forth a great effort.
Historically, I'm sure this film is a real boon to Civil War buffs and I'm quite sure, every historian that relishes in this era probably rather enjoyed the authenticity of this film.  I, myself, enjoyed the authenticity of this film, between over seven thousand re-enactors and the production crews efforts to put forth as accurate a film as possible, they accomplished that goal with flying colors.  In the filmmakers efforts to keep the rating of the film down to a PG-13, they more or less sold out on the ""authenticity"" of the horrible type of combat that was engaged in during this era, which when comparing other films, most notably those starring Mel Gibson, somewhat lessens the experience.
Performance wise, all of the actors and re-enactors performed quite admirably.  Of special note is the exceptional performance by Stephen Lang as General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson.  Robert Duvall and Jeff Daniels both perform to their high standards in their respective roles in this film.
Director Ronald F. Maxwell set out to recreate three of the civil war's most pivotal battles in Manassas, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville.  All three of which were, as I understand it, seamlessly recreated for the purpose of this film, bringing to it an authenticity that few other films have accomplished.  High praise goes to Ronald Maxwell for his efforts here.  Unfortunately, this film will most likely not go down in history as one of the best or the most successful, but it will most likely go down in history as one the most ""required"" films for students of this era.
The soundtrack for the film is truly ""dead on"" for the events as they're being depicted; credit to those involved in this particular aspect of the film.
The premise:
Based on Jeffrey M. Shaara's bestseller, ""Gods and Generals,"" this film takes on the role of depicting, in part, the story of select individuals during some of the events leading up to the beginning of the civil war and for a couple years thereafter.  The film primarily focuses on southern generals, General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson, General Robert E. Lee and northern Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Chamberlain.  In a way, the director portrays an almost ""clinical"" look at these characters and the events.  From General Jackson's devout religious beliefs to Lieutenant Colonel Chamberlain's initial doubts, the authenticity of the plot and the portrayal abound.
I would definitely recommend this film, not as a dramatic success but as a historical success of a film, that given fours hours to watch, can be an enlightening experience, as I learned several things about these historic figures.  {ssintrepid}

1887334,3,B00009OOFB,"Film Editing is not a concept that jumps to mind when assessing the success of a movie.  After all, who outside of the film industry, gets excited about the ""Best Film Editing"" Academy Award?  Good editing escapes our attention while bad editing grabs it.  The worst film editing I can recall was in ""The Thin Red Line"" but the editing of ""Gods and Generals"" may take its' place.  Let's be frank here;  This movie is at least an hour too long.  The main reason for this is that it elaborates far too many scenes.  A good film will spend only as much time as necessary to make the points it wants to make.  Great films are noted, among other things,  for their subtlety.  I will mention two scenes by way of explanation.  The first that comes to mind is one in which, on the eve of battle, Colonel Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels) quotes Julius Ceasar.  We got the message early on but had to stay for the whole page and a half of the quote.  The second scene that comes to mind was the long, drawn out illness and death of Stonewall Jackson.  I spend a lot of time wondering whether this movie is about the early days of the Civil War or the last days of Stonewall Jackson.  That question, as well, is the fault of failing to edit with a story focus in mind.  Another complaint of the editing was the sense that I was seeing the same scenes over and over.  I realize that a battle often has ebbs and flows but we were immersed in too much repetition.  Finally, I was struck by the lack of a sense of direction as to where the story was going.  I realize that this is about the Civil War but why did we have all the different related stories that we did?  It seemed that we were going from scene to scene at random.  For example, we have, in this movie, the best ever film about the battle of Fredricksburg.  In that battle we DO get the subleties as well as a great overview.  We had the one example of an officer making a sound suggestion of strategy only to be dismissed by General Burnside who had his mind made up.  There were, of course, many such mistakes as that one made by Burnside but this scene is sufficient to make the point.  There are the frequent scenes of the Rebels three deep at the wall on the hill.  By passing the guns back for others to reload, we could see that the Rebels were able to fire at least twice as often as the Yankees.  These and many other scenes were very impressive.  Why is it, then, that we view the battles of First Bull Run and Chancellorsville only through the eyes of Jackson's troops?
I can tell from other reviews that there is a large element of fans out there who appreciate this movie for going out of its' way to show the ""real"" Civil War.  I can certainly see the many elements in this movie that brings out that reaction.  My point is that it is possible to accomplish that AND have a slimmer, better edited movie.  There are other complaints I have about the movie such as the mediocre acting.  However, there is much to admire about it as well.  I give it an ""A"" for effort.  Now if we can just send it back to the cutting room...",1063497600,5,3079,4.224699828473414

The acting and storytelling are top notch, and the battle scenes, especially the recreation of Frederickburg, are the most powerful ever filmed. This is epic storytelling on an epic scale!

The VHS version is beautifully rendered! The sound is crisp, making you feel like you're actually on the battlefield. The only quibble I have is that the subtitles are very small, unlike on the DVD.

Let's hope The Last Full Measure, the final installment in this trilogy which also features Gettysburg, is on par with the aforementioned Gettysburg. The movie, for the most part, felt like a high school play...and a bad one at that. Lofty and highly unbelievable dialogue combines with actors who seem to feel uncomfortable in their wool reenactment costumes, creating an overall awkward viewing experience. Furthermore, had the film editors used a more discerning eye, the movie may have been more enjoyable. One finishes feeling like an hour could have easily been cut from the product. Something must be said for the battle sequences however. Often impressive and sometimes extremely poignant, they help to redeem the film. Overall, however, one could find another way of spending four hours. For a more moving and watchable Civil War experience turn to Gone with the Wind, Glory, or Gettysburg.

The authenticity and much of the passion of the book is there, however I feel that there was something missing even though it is a long film.  Maybe I expected too much because having seen Gettysburg (one of my favourite films) I went on to read the trilogy Gods and Generals, Killer Angels (on which Gettysburg is based) and The Last Full Measure.  These books are some of the best I have read. Gods and Generals the book is epic in scope detailing many battles and themes and as such I believe that it should have been made into more than one film.  The film doesn't quite convey the other stories; The John Brown episode, Hancock and Armistead's relationship and the history of the relationships of the other officers from both sides in the Mexico campaigns etc that tied the book together and showed how the war brewed up slowly and how divisive it was.

1887338,3,B00009OOFB,"A film by Ronald Maxwell
Gods and Generals is the Civil War epic that is a prequel to Maxwell's own Gettysburg.  It is based on the novel by Jeff Shaara.  Rather than telling a narrative story with a plot, Gods and Generals is an examination of the men (mostly Southern) during 1861-1863.  The major players are General Robert E Lee (Robert Duvall) and General Stonewall Jackson (Stephen Lang).
The movie itself is a collection of scenes, personal glimpses into the lives of the soldiers that don't really amount to much.  We see that Stonewall Jackson is a very devout Christian and that he believes in the rightness of the Southern Cause (as presented by the movie, this cause is not slavery but rather the encroaching of the federal government on the rights of the states).  The Southerners are presented in an even handed light and not as evil slaveholders.  They are men, just like northerners, who believe their view of government is correct.  This is more of a sympathetic view of the Confederacy than I have ever seen in a movie.  The movie contains several intense battle scenes, and even though it may seem incredible to the modern man, these are highly accurate accounts of Civil War battles...men walking right into the line of fire because that is how the battle is fought.
Gods and Generals comes off feeling like more of a re-enactment of the Civil War than a film telling a story.  On one hand, this is a good thing.  The accuracy of the movie helps the believability of the movie.  The downside to this is simply that there is so much detail in getting everything right that Ronald Maxwell forgot to tell a story.  The movie is just lacking a narrative spark.  As a historical portrait, the film works.  As a movie, it fails.  Recommended to Civil War buffs.",1063238400,4,1775,4.644230769230769

This is a fantastic movie that dipicts the realities of the Civil War like no other movie I have seen.  I like how it depicts the toll that the war took on families, a side of the Civil War not to often seen.  Also, this movie showed the true side of Stonewall Jackson, depicting him as a Christian, which he was.  The battle scenes are amazing, and the prayer scenes are touching.  If you want a movie that shows the South side of the war, then this is the movie I would suggest to you.  A true, historically acurate film.

1887341,3,B00009OOFB,"It's kind of hard to put down a movie like this because it is such a sincere effort, and because the historical events depicted are so rarely treated in film for contemporary audiences and are so intrinsically intersting. It is, sad, though, to see so many chances missed in a single film.
Stonewall Jackson (the overriding subject of this film) is probably the most interesting American Military leader in our nation's history and deserves a film at least of the caliber of Patton; yet in this film so little is really revealed about him, other than that he is devoutly religious, loves his wife, enjoys the company of children and wins a lot of battles. More focus, better casting, and less attempted breadth of scope would have produced a more biographical film to be much more valued and enduring. The strangest irony of all is that the perfect actor to portray Jackson in such a biograpy was already in the film, cast as Lee. (The fact that Duval was so disappointing as Lee only adds to this irony.)
The greatest disappointment, however, was the portrayal of the battle of Chancellorsville, which was so hurried that it only occupied about 20 minutes of film time. Chancellorsville was in fact the most significant, greatest and longest day of Jackson's life (probably also the greatest single day for the confederacy) perfect for him in every way, including, perhaps, the fact that it also happened to be his last day in charge of his army. Such an end for him, mortally wounded by his own soldiers at the close of his greatest victory, seems almost too perfect not to be scripted. So many wonderful details about this battle were missed, such as the fact that the union soldiers, who were cooking breakfast, were first surprised by deer and other animals bounding from the forest in the path of so many confederates moving rapidly toward them through the woods. To a film which paid so much attention to historical detail, this sort of detail would have added much to the proper mood and the almost mystical qualities of the battle.
The worst thing about this film, however, besides the cameo appearance by Ted, which was certainly the low point, was the really sappy music, which intruded frequently on dialog, unnecessarily distracting and annoying any earnest viewer who might still be trying to concentrate on the actors.
The film is not entirely bad, however, and does provide at least a cursory view of the early stages of the civil war, and does provide well intended attention to historical detail, setting and costume.",1062979200,,2535,4.81651376146789

  There are an ample amount of devastating conflict scenes in ""Gods and Generals"", but the movie presents a more complete picture of the men from both sides of the war.  We see them with their wives, involved in family life.  The language is 19th century, and that helps to draw us into the culture of that era, which included the firm belief of all the combatants that God was on their side.
  Hundreds of Civil War re-enactors, along with well known people like Ted Turner and some Congressmen, appear in the movie, bringing to life Schaara's story of those meaningful days, perhaps the most emotional, violent, and poignant time in our nation's history. Kudoes to Robert Duval and to Jeff Daniels for their excellent portrayals of Robert E. Lee and Joshua Chamberlain. The central character is Stonewall Jackson, a complex, devoutly religious man who often seemed able to embrace two opposite concepts simultaneously.  He is played masterfully well by Stephen Lang.

I sincerely wish I had never seen ""Gods and Generals"".  My opinion of the Civil War has changed from fascination to disappointment.  I guess I should be thankful.  I can now stop wasting my time reading about that thoughtless massacre.  To justify killing fellow human beings on the basis of politics is completely ludicrous.  And to use ""God"" and ""prayer"" as a way to feel good about killing is equally stupid.
I felt as if I was watching a twisted reigious after-school special.  According to this movie, Thomas Jackson was an insane, self-centered idiot with a death wish.  Robert E. Lee was depicted as a lethargic, senile turncoat (Not unlike other U.S. leaders who have led lower-class citizens to slaughter).
I could rant more about this movie, but it's hardly worth the time.  To use Stonewall's words, let us pray to the glorious saviour that Ted Turner does not produce another film.",1062979200,9,1168,4.742574257425742

I read the book shortly after it came out in the late 1990's and was excited about all the rumors I heard about a movie being made based on the book Gods and Generals.  However, I found that the book was much better than the movie.  I've watched my copy of the DVD about 4 times since it came out, and each time I see it, I find I like it a lot better than I did the time before.  The movie was too much of a biography of Lt. General ""Stonewall"" Jackson.  In the book, General Lee, General Winfield Scott Hancock, General Lewis Armistead, and Lt. Col. Joshua Chamberlain were much more prominent, and at times, more interesting than Jackson.  However, despite leaving out the Battle of Antietam and the Peninsula Campaign of 1862 (both included in the book), the movie had some excellent stories and accurately portrayed how things were for slaves and soldiers alike.  Robert Duvall, Stephen Lang, and Jeff Daniels were phenomenal actors and delivered excellent performances in this movie.  I am a history major, currently in my second year of college, so I was very happy with the historical accuracy.  There were only two miniscule problems in the entire movie that I found, unlike in Gettysburg, where I was able to pick out numerous problems.  Gettysburg is still a much better movie, but if Director Ron Maxwell would've stuck closer to the book, Gods and Generals would have far exceeded it.",1062892800,,1453,4.640625

1887349,2,B00009OOFB,"What an effort, I refer both to the effort taken to make the movie, and the effort required to watch it! .  Obviously creating this movie was a labor love.  But the end product is too much for the average viewer.
The attention to accurate historical detail makes the movie suffer as a whole.  I think judicious editing to remove an hours worth of Chamberlin's rambling neo-classical soliloquies, parlor ballads, camp songs and  Jackson's playing with paper dolls would have made the movie much easier to watch.
Dialog in the movie seems to be taken from writings and letters of the time.  Though this may be an accurate reflection of the way people thought at the time, using these writings as actual dialog comes off awkward and forced.  I swear I saw one of the 20th Maine point his rifle at Chamberlin during one of his rambling muses about the glory of war.
The dialog on both sides about slavery works better.  It reflects the thoughts and ideas of the time about the subject, rather than the revisionist-history, self-righteous soapboxing that is usually seen in films of the last 20 years.
Often, the movie's attention detail does not work.  The movie attempts to show two sides of Jackson: the fierce warrior and the devout Christian.  But he comes off more like a senile grandfather than the lunatic zealot his actions and recorded statements suggest.
Likewise some battle scenes work, while others don't.  The film's rendering of Fredricksburg and Chancellorsville capture the chaos and carnage with accuracy.  But Bull Run seems staged and phony.  (Can anyone believe that a rank of green solders standing at attention in the middle of the battle would not even flitch as a canon blast decimates a group of comrades standing twenty feet away?)

One of the biggest problems with ""Gods and Generals"" is that it's basically structured as a series of long-winded, overly earnest speeches.  By the time I heard the actor playing Stonewall Jackson undertake his third or forth such effort, I was just exhausted.  For all of the film's accuracy in battle depiction and costumes, God help these people if they actually spoke like that.
Furthermore, the film presents an apologist point of view for the Confederacy--their cause is God's cause, the war has been thrust upon them.  Never mind that their cause was treasonous, too.  I recently visited the State capitol builing in Austin, TX where memorials still stand representing this point of view (e.g., the war as being ""the war of northern aggression""), which was rather surprising.
Particularly irritating is the depiction of slaves being so devoted to their owners that they volunteer, and even risk their lives, to help the Confederate cause.  Even granting the remote possibility that a few slaves may have felt this way, is this really how we want to depict slavery?  It seems to me that a consistent ""slavery is bad"" message has a lot to offer.
Finally, I hope this review won't be construed as a condemnation of the South.  Southern culture in the U.S. has much to offer--it's a shame some within it choose to invest all of their cultural identity in a portion of history that is best left behind them.",1062547200,11,1648,4.7177700348432055

The accents and language are also spot on. If only the tempo and characters were as believable. Robert Duvall is great as Lee, a marked improvement over Sheen in ""Gettysburg"". Many of the actors coming back to reprise their characters lent a continuity that helped the viewer immeadiately feel at ""home"". Unfortuneately, the director allowed the glaring (and confusing) error of Stephan Lang switching from Gen Pickett (Gettysburg) to Gen Jackson. Lang is a fine actor and did his best to fill out his poorly written character. Jeff Daniels looked to be about 40 pounds overweight and 40 years older than the character he played in ""Gettysburg"". Another jolting and foolish bit of hubis that detracts from the video is the intoduction of Ted Turner (ego-man) in a frivilous cameo that contributes nothing and generally detracts from the video's flow.
The bad stuff: This video has all the dash and tempo of a dead cat. Even the battle scenes seem to drag. Many of the scenes drag on and on while the director rubs your nose in a particular point. Shoddy editing and heavy handed direction detract from an engaging and memorable story line. Suggestion: Don't buy it, rent it if you must see it.",1062460800,,1338,4.847161572052402

There is just too much in the book to cover in the movie--remember that ""The Killer Angels"" was about just one battle.  G&G was too much about Jackson and not enough about the horrors of the Civil War, which all three books (including ""The Last Full Measure"") seem to deal with at least as much as character development.  Maybe the producers thought that we've been reminded too much of how terrible war is, so they treated that subject as an afterthought.
And, I'm sorry, but I thought Duvall did an awful job as R.E. Lee...even though I don't like ol' Marty Sheen's political views, I thought he did much better.

Yes, the film is that long, a full 229 minutes.  And yes, it's supposed to be authentic.  After all, Ted Turner was the executive producer of this adaptation from the Jeff Shaara novel.  They even hired authentic ""re-enactors"" for the battle scenes.  The history is well researched.  And the cast consists of several well-known actors such as Robert Duvall, Jeff Daniels and Stephen Lang.
But the film is just plain ""sappy"".  And everyone overacts.  Between the battle scenes there are long, boring speeches quoted verbatim from either the bible or classical literature.  There isn't a character who doesn't seem a stereotype.  And there are so many tearful partings from families, orations about honor and duty to the cause and overdone sentimentality that I soon lost track or who was who.  Nor did I care.

Not so with a movie about the Civil War. It's a divisive subject, and for good reason. I think it's pretty important in a day and age when racism still exists to approach the Civil War with a sense that while all war might be tragedy where good and innocent people of many creeds die for what they believe to be truth, it is BETTER that the North won, and that slavery was abolished and Southern feudal aristocracy was (mostly) dismantled. This movie is complete revisionist history where the South and its cause are shown as being identically moral (if not superior) to the North and its cause. The few black characters are shockingly and cynically shown to be some kind of southern patriots, loyal to their slaveowners.
Why make a movie like this today? Why, pardon the pun, whitewash the Confederacy? Why garner sympathy for an institution that was 100% bound up and identified with chattel slavery and the dehumanization of African-Americans?
Fortunately for all the frightening implications of these questions, this movie is too long, talky, unbearably self-important, and just plain soporific. As historical dramas go it's really third-rate.

Battles only occupy the screen in a seemingly secondary role, you have to really be paying attention to even know they happened. Excessive canned repeat shots and horrible CGI ruin any battles that are shown on screen.

I now recognize that most of the criticism of the movie can be attributed to the political correctness of those (i.e., Northeasterners) who cannot tolerate a movie that portrays historical figures of the Confederacy sympathetically without counterbalancing that sympathy with the Northern viewpoint.

The officers on both sides are shown as family men who left their wives and children in order to fight for the principals they believed in.  Emphasis is given to Jackson's strong Christian faith which sustained him and his family through difficult years of the war and strengthened his leadership skills.  Battle scenes are done without the usual blood and gore which have become almost standard in today's movies.  The acting is well-done, especially considering the long and lofty speeches which the actors are required to give.

This is an excellent film! The main reason I rated it only 4 stars is not based on any sins of commission , but on the errors of ommission. The film jumps from the first battle of Manassas to Fredricksburg and then to Chancellorsville without Lee's invasion of the North through Harpers Ferry and Antietam. The producers of the film skipped the bloodiest battle of the entire war!
On the very positive side , the acting by Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee was magnificent. Frankie Faison portrayed ""Big Jim"", Stonewall Jackson's cook very well. Historical accuracy: as many other reviewers have pointed out , the war was NOT simply about slavery. This film brings into focus many of the other issues involved , primarily the issues of sovereignty and federal coercion. The major issue of the economic impact of southern secession is not even touched upon.
Anyone who is from the south or has freinds and relatives form the south can testify that the depiction of religeous fervor is accurate (altho' many reviewers have commented in a negative manner on this issue!).

Here one area that the film is taking hits.
They say that the diologe is way to long.  That is so not true.
The way the people in the film talk is very accurate.  Americans in the 1860's spoke very different than we do.  They were more into reading than we are today.  Even poor people spoke better, they mostly read the bible.  There were less books back than there are today and people then were better educated. Americans today cannot understand that this is how people spoke. People even spoke well when they were praying with each other.  Their is a scene in the film between Jackson and his wife praying.  The spoke by praying, and this was very acuratetly prortrayed in the film.  That was not over done at all.  Don't listen to those air head critics.  They do not know what they are talking about.  I would like to talk more about how accurate this film is, but there is not enough room.  I will say it again, i think this was a wonderful film and i wish more people would see it.

Seeing the flags of the civil war regiments at the opening credits was haunting, as tho it was the ""threshold"" we as viewers were to cross to get back to the U.S. in the 1860s.
The primary complaints that most people are apt to pledge against this film too long & too pedantic.  As far as length, it was appropriate for the scope of its story - just as the sequel, GETTYSBERG was.  [Even tho GETTYSBERG was made before the present movie, it is still the sequel].  You can't make an epic movie and still have it be under 2 hours;  is just the nature of the epic.
As for it being overly pedantic, for myself I relish lines such as ""We train by day and read our Xenophon by night.""  We must remember that the service academies gave much more credence to classical history in the 19th century than they do today.  Also, Xenophon had a far greater reputation as a trustworthy historian than he does today.
The cast of the film is top-knotch.  Robert Duvall plays Robert E Lee in a more stoic fashion than Martin Sheen's portrayal in GETTYSBERG.  Bruce Boxleitner is an even trade off for Tom Berenger in the role of General Longstreet.

The humanizing protrayal of Southern legends such as ""Stonewall"" Jackson.  Let's face it.  When was the last time a film or documnetary about the Civil war portrayed a Confederate such as Jackson being intimate with his wife or holding his newborn child? Just like films about Americans in World War II, we are almost always portrayed as the ""good guy.""  The Nazis are always evil.  Same for the Civil War, the Confederates are always out back whipping their slaves.  One can quibble with the portayal of Fredericksburg by the use of Harpers Ferry, W VA., but the events that took place there are what matter.  Jeff Daniels continues to perform in an outstanding manner as Joshua Chmaberlain (and George Washington but that's another film).  I doubt few quibbled about the intimate scenes of Chamberlian and his wife, unlike Jackson. Let's face it.  Any portrayal of the Civil War is bound to upset one side or the other.  It is just such a topic.

I suppose the most glaring weakness of ""God and Generals"" was the overall low-budget quality. Crowd scenes are forced, battle scenes are stilted and shots of re-enactors cheering resemble old home movies. The odd casting choices will also cause viewers to scratch their heads. It is abundantly clear the filmmakers sought unity with the film ""Gettysburg,"" re-casting many of the same actors in their former roles (Jeff Daniels, C. Thomas Howell). So one wonders why Stephen Lang, who played the role of Pickett in ""Gettysburg,"" was cast in the role of Stonewall Jackson in ""Gods and Generals."" Lang is a terrific actor, and he gives a splendid performance in this film. It's hard to imagine there were not other actors available for this meaty role.
I also had problems - and I can't believe I am going to say this - with Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee. It is one of the few times in this actor's historic career in which he gives a weak performance. I truly believe Martin Sheen was far more vibrant and alive in the same role in ""Gettysburg."" And the list goes on. Jeff Daniels seemingly sleepwalking in the role of Joshua Chamberlain - a role in which he gave the finest performance of his career in ""Gettysburg."" A weak musical score (Bob Dylan?!) also detracts, which is odd because another highlight of ""Gettysburg"" was the splendid music by Randy Edelman.
Several scenes also feel so staged as to be gag-inducing. Lang certainly sinks his teeth into the role of Jackson, but his constant prayers to the Lord Almighty eventually become forced and tiresome. These scenes come off as hammy as a 19th century play. If this was intended by the filmmakers, it was a severe miscalculation.
Eventually, ""Gods and Generals"" must be termed un unfocused mess. The filmmakers tackled more than they could handle, jumping from one battle to another, threading it along with staged scenes in an attempt to redefine the public's perception about this brutal war. A tighter screenplay and a focus on one specific battle would have aided this leaky tugboat of a movie.
The same filmmakers who gave us the noble and spiritually uplifting ""Gettysburg"" also gave us ""Gods and Generals."" I was moved, stunned and inspired by ""Gettysburg."" ""Gods and Generals"" just left me wanting to watch ""Gettysburg"" again.",1060214400,6,2795,4.911205073995772
1887378,2,B00009OOFB,"I went into this movie expecting a long period piece with the flowery language of the time.  Those items were of not an issue for me at all.  I LOVED Gettysburg.  Finally, I personally believe that almost all of the Confederate troops fought because a bunch of forgeiners (as they saw them) were telling them how to run their states (which were more independent then) and because Northern troops invaded their homes.  Slavery may have been the catalyst but it just was not the full root cause!  It is certainly noble that the war ended slavery in the USA, and that may be one of the only things that can allow people to accept the full horror of the war, but the average Conferate soldier owned no slaves and had not been drafted to fight by any ""evil"" Southern government devoted to slavery.  Because of this the handling of the slavery issue did not upset me as much as many others writing reviews.
I do not pan this movie for any of the above reasons.  I am panning it becasue it was poorly written, directed and editted.  Scenes such as in the Wilderness and other battles went on and on with multiple camara angles (some times the same ones repeated) of troops marching.  It seems the director, after suceeeding with Gettysburg, had too much money and film to burn.  Every scene with somebody speaking was shot with the intention of it being played on the big screeen at the Acadamy Awards prior to the envelope being openned; becuase of that fact none of them will make it there.  Everything was just too forced!  The dialogue went well past flowery and descriptive, moving far into tedious and unbelievable.  Re-casting Daniels as Chamberlain (with an added 10 years and 30+ pounds) was a mistake.  He was correct the first time around but has aged too much to be believable based on his earlier performance.
The only major character I could feel anything for was Jackson, who I believe was cast well.  I liked that character, as portrayed, in spite of some of the horrible dialogue forced out of his mouth and surrounding him.  Something about a man capable of such duality intrigues me (Death on a Pale Horse on the battlefield but tender with his wife and with children).  Watching him I could only think of the word FANATIC.
Because of Jackson, the genre, and some of the film time devoted to the battle scenes I can avoid just giving just one star. Otherwise, as I am very very sad to report, this is just a BAD MOVIE.
I understand all of us fans of the first movie WANT this film to be great but we must be honest if we are going to have any hope that the makers are going to make a better film in the future.  If the film makers had cared about the critics they would not have made Gettysburg, and thank God they did!  It is the devoted students of this era to which they directed these films.  We can appreciate what they have tried to do but we owe them the truth for their efforts.",1060128000,,2898,4.432075471698113
1887379,5,B00009OOFB,"This movie hurts those who know nothing about true history.  I love to read the reviews by the people who hated this movie who write things like ""I remember my history"".
  Let me tell you, your history teacher, especially up north, probably didn't have a clue as to the true Southern mind-set at the time of the Civil War and if he did he wouldn't tell you the truth.
 Don't tell me to 'deal' with the fact that the South lost, the South lost for only one reason, because slavery was wrong.  Had slavery been abolished by Jefferson Davis at the outset of the war, I believe God would have truly been on our side and the Yankees and their liberal descendants would be living in Canada today where they belong.
This movie has the guts to be completely honest about the convictions of the people it portrays.  Most Americans today cannot fathom what deeply held religious convictions mean.  They are too busy watching trash television and getting their body parts pierced.
  We are living in a growing pagan society that worships themselves and material possessions.  That's why this movie is so hard for some to understand, and easy for them to deny.
  We again are headed for a cultural Civil War, only this time the lines of battle won't be as clearly drawn.  Watch this movie and understand what people with conviction and faith are capable of.",1060128000,3,1345,4.600840336134453
1887380,1,B00009OOFB,"First of all, it is not historically accurate. The movie glosses over Stonewall Jackson's failings and foibles to present him exclusively as a sympathetic man of piety. His famous obession with lemmons is only obliquely hinted at in the movie character's taste for lemonade. His peculiar habit of riding with one arm in the air to ""balance his equilibrium"" is also dismissed in the movie as being due to an injury in battle.

The movie is too pro-Southern. I am certainly not one to subscribe to political correctness, but if you are going to make a movie about he South in the Civil War, you should address the slavery issue more forthrightly. There are hardly any blacks at all in the film, despite the film's almost exclusive Southern location. The two main black characters are embarrassingly pro-Southern themselves!

The battle scenes are cursory and very short. Whereas you could watch ""Gettysburg"" and actually learn a great deal about the battle, there is little that can be learned from the battle scenes in this film. The concluding battle of Chancellorsville should have been a fantastic opportunity to gain insight on Lee's battle strategy and Jackson's brillance. Instead it is glossed over, and is included only so Jackson's final reconnaissance ride can be covered.

Whole years of the war are skipped, which at least could have been alluded to. There is no mention at all of the Peninsular Campaign or Antietam.

Last and most importantly, the movie is a series of monologues. The actors don't talk to each other as much as they talk at each other. The dialogue is stale and lifeless, as is much of the movie in general. I greatly enjoyed Turner's ""Gettysburg,"" and was extremely disappointed by this film. It was a waste of time and money, and not just my own.",1060128000,8,1778,4.838815789473684
1887381,5,B00009OOFB,"This movie is excellent. Beautiful music, excellent acting of Generals Lee and Jackson. Gods and Generals is Pro-South and portrays the Union army for what they really were: the non-Christian North and the Christian South.
 Most people don't realize the Civil War was not about slavery. The governemnt was raising taxes to such a point it was hard to afford. That is why people in the South seceeded.
 I highly recomment this movie to everyone. It's a wonderful story of the war and the unwavering faith that General Jackson and General Lee had the Heavenly Father",1060041600,10,564,4.864583333333333
1887382,3,B00009OOFB,"I have not seen the DVD yet, but I do plan on buying the film. I saw it in the movie theater and it did at times feel like a trying experience. That said the film has a lot to offer.
On the positive side:
1)The production quality and makeup is a marked improvement over the paste-on beards of Gettysburg.
2)It is one of the first films on the Civil War that attempts to investigate a very important historical character, Stonewall Jackson.
3)The film, much to many peoples' annoyance, effectively conveys the religious nature of the Southern soldier. I believe that this cannot be stressed enough. So what if Stonewall Jackson quotes Scripture and appears to preach more than fight. Christianity was a tremendous driving force for soldiers on both sides of the war and a great religious revival happened in the army camps in the middle of the conflict.
4)I really enjoyed the music. The opening sequence of the changing flags was extremely well-done and how can you argue with Bob Dylan doing music for a war film. Strange isn't it?
5)Jeff Daniels once again did a fine job portraying the idealistic Joshua L Chamberlain.
6)The scene where the soldiers meet in the middle of the river during a truce shows the unique bond between soldiers present in all wars but especially in the US Civil War. It is a very important scene.
Unfortunately, the movie has many negatives which overshadow alot of the positives:
1)The biggest negative is the absence of either scenes or reference to major campaigns of 1862 and 1863. Conspicuously absent are Shiloh(understandable since the war focuses on the Eastern theater), The Seven Days Campaign around Richmond in June 1862, where Lee developed as an army commander and Jackson was arguably a failure and a nonentity because of fatigue, Second Manassas, a brilliant defensive battle fought by Jackson,  Sharpsburg/Antietam, a nominal Union victory with far-reaching consequences and the biggest blunder of them all, The Valley Campaign of 1862 in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. This is an inexcusable blunder on the part of the director and the editors. Jackson developed his mystical reputation in Valley. The movie tries to argue that the Jackson mystique somehow developed at the First Battle of Manassas, not really true. The Valley Campaign defined Jackson as an independent commander and gave Robert E Lee the confidence to send him on detached duty in later campaigns like Second Manassas, Sharpsburg(where he captured Harpers Ferry) and his great flanking manuever at Chancellorsville.
2)The absence of General Hancock. Hancock is an extremely important character in Jeff Shaara's novel. He is given little more than passing treatment in this movie. While it is arguable that Hancock is a bit overrated historically as a general, he is an intriguing character, that we first meet in Gettysburg and wish we knew more about after Gods and Generals.
3)The montage scenes of Fredericksburg and Harpers Ferry are very poorly done. They look like paintings or really poor animation. I was very bothered by this in the theater.
4)The choice of Harpers Ferry as a location for the Fredericksburg urban fighting sequence. Anyone that has been to Harpers Ferry WV should recognize the steep streets and store fronts of Harpers Ferry. They are very unique. Director Ronald Maxwell should have selected a different location. I realize that this is nickpicking by a student of the Civil War, but it was still bothersome. Additionally, Fredericksburg had undergone serious bombardment before the infantry assault and in the movie it appeared that little damage was done.
5)The treatment of the slavery issue. Ultimately, aside from the absence of battles important to the development of the characters, the way Gods and Generals deals with slavery is quite weak. It is highly unlikely and probably historically inaccurate to contend, as the movie does that Stonewall Jackson had a deep relationship with his manservant. Granted the two may have been close because of the nature of the master-slave relationship, but to see the two waxing philosophically about slavery and religion in one sequence borders on shameful and made me uncomfortable because I have never seen evidence to support the notion that this scene contends. The two men are almost seen as equals, a reality that did not exist in the South in the times of slavery.
Despite the negatives, Gods and Generals is still a decent film and one that I will own and watch multiple times, but I will not enjoy it as much as Ronald Maxwell's Gettysburg. I just hope that the last installment in the trilogy, The Last Full Measure irons out many of the problems inherent in war films, especially those dealing with very sensitive social, political and cultural issues.",1060041600,3,4753,5.031725888324873
1887383,4,B00009OOFB,"This movie has been villified by revisionists who believe that the south was wrong, bigoted, hateful, and fought for opression.  Though this may be true in some regards, the majority of the people who fought in this war fought for other reasons, whether it was for state's rights, protecting their homeland, or because they were asked to.  To understand this, you can better appreciate the sacrafice soldiers on both sides had to endure, and this movie captures that idea.
There are plenty of extras on this 1 disk DVD, from documentaries on the making of the film, to an interesting biography of Thomas Jackson.  Very interesting is the slave perspective, with viewpoints from the actors who played Martha and Jim, two prominant slave characters in the movie.  The DVD also includes 2 music videos of songs featured in the movie.
If you are a history buff, you will most definately love this movie and cherish its themes.  Fans of DVD extras will love the many extra featurettes.  Either way, you can't lose.",1060041600,,1009,4.837209302325581
1887384,1,B00009OOFB,"For fans of the movie ""Gettysburg"" - and possibly anyone who is not Ted Turner - this movie comes as a major dissapointment.  Poorly directed, badly edited, with an overabundance of syrupy, sappy dialog and contrived sentimentalism. The film consistently fails to engage the viewer for any length of time, though it cannot be faulted for lack of trying.  Gen. Stonewall Jackson is the centerpiece of the story, and his life is interesting enough.  One wonders, however, why it was necessary to drudge up the characters of Chamberlain, his brother, and the crusty Irish sergeant from ""Gettysburg,"" even when they seem to have no particular relevance to the story - other than as a plum to ""Gettysburg"" fans.  Even so, Jeff Daniels at 10 years older and 20 pounds heavier is no longer the spry, young Chamberlain we remember from ""Gettysburg,"" and it makes one feel uneasy watching ""G&G"" knowing that this timeframe of this movie takes place BEFORE the battle at Gettysburg.  Mira Sorvino, although a beautiful Hollywood actress, seems miscast as Chamberlain's wife, as well.
Martin Sheen's protrayal of R.E. Lee in ""Gettysburg"" is bested by Robert Duval in G&G.  Duvall does an excellent job, as always.  One wonders who Duvall might have felt attending the premiere of G&G, only to be dissapointed seeing how badly the editors hacked up the film while still managing to leave us with a movie that is entirely too long to watch.
A tribute to the Southern cause, G&G tries deparately to show the people of the south in a sympathetic light, but fails.  In our modern times when it especially fashionable to champion the loser, this film champions the lost cause of the South by showing how tender and God-fearing the hearts of the men were who launched the conflict.  Viewers are continously bombarded with prayers and supplications from Generals and others throughout the entire movie, to the point of nausea.  While this is supposed to tug at our heart strings, it only serves to portray the South as a pathetic band of misled men and women who while mindlessly performing lipservice to god continue to fight and die to support one of the most pernicious evils ever brought forth against god by man - human slavery.
This movie could have been great.....unfortunately, it is not even good. It is bad on so many levels.  A major production flaw, for example - in the midst of the battle of Fredericksburg, you are forced to flip over the DVD and there is an abrupt, unsettling shift of scenes when the DVD begins on side two. From the script, to most of the acting, including the editing and production - this film is a sad, sad waste of talent and money.

Gettysburg was a great movie and I believe Maxwell did another great job with this one. The attention to detail was amazing complete with the sight of the Nothern Lighs after the Battle of Fredricksburg, which is well documented on both sides. It showed both sides rather well and I think Stephen Lang was better as Jackson then I expected him to be. I believe that at least Sharpsburg, (Antietam for you Northern Folk) should have been shown. This was Chamberlian's first view of war and a very important battle. I also think they could have followed the book a little more.

1887390,4,B00009OOFB,"The movie 'Gods And Generals' is the  second of a Civil War trilogy, based on the works of Jeff Shaara and his father Michael Shaara, and is a prequil to the movie 'Gettysburg.' This movie seemed to be either loved or hated by the public, and one person I talked to said his wife found the movie confusing. This is not surprising considering the general lack of knowledge
of American history. When Jay Leno goes 'Jaywalking' and asks people basic questions such as who was George Washington, many people do not know. But there may be another reason for the dislike of the movie. 'Gods and Generals' flies in the face of our drive to be politically correct. In an age when people try to regulate God to the sidelines, and make it seem as if people of faith are all extremists, here we have a film about a group of men and women whose references to God, faith, a heavenly confidence, the Savior, the Bible, etc., overflowed in their words and letters. In fact, it would be safe to say that letters from the Civil War era are often saturated with religious expression even in ways we are not familiar with, no matter how
strong our religious fervor. Such was the case back in the 1860s, and often less attention was given to the very battles that threatened to take their lives.
So imagine going to see this movie and expecting a nice Civil War tale, only to find its key figures quoting from the Bible, giving thanks to God for victories, encouraging each other to pray ""if it be thy will,"" and having a confidence that in life or in death a person belongs to God. Surely, this cannot be, since we are told that we have a separation of church and state,
or we don't want to offend anyone with our beliefs, or that religious expression by past leaders is simply myth. The film is not pushing religion, but is simply expressing the nature of the main characters. This is in stark contrast to so many Hollywood historical films, where a 1990s era morality is imposed on characters from 1865, so that any married woman from that time
period will naturally take off her clothes and hop in bed with anyone she sees. According to Hollywood, there is not one chaste woman from the mid 19th Century. It seems it is better to be immoral than to be moral.
Perhaps another reason why a person might find this film confusing, is that these people were living in confusing times. Why would the South fight to defend their own freedom, while denying that right to others--their slaves? And did the North even have the right to force the South to stay in the Union when they wanted out? After all, our Declaration of Independence clearly says that, ""....whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness."" It also says, "" But when a long train of
abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security."" It would seem that the rights provided by our Founding Fathers were not the same rights applied to the South. In the end, the North wanted to preserve the Union, and the South wanted their States' Rights,
with no interference from Washington, let alone an invasion. To add to the confusion, there were families and relatives in both the North and The South who fought against each other. And what is an immigrant supposed to do when an Irish Brigade from the North is ordered to attack a Southern Irish Brigade?
To add to the confusion, Northern and Southern pickets, each guarding a side of the river, would often meet half way to trade coffee for tobacco. And how does a Union soldier explain to his commanding officer why he walked over to the Confederate side for an evening of card playing? That would be enough to get your hand and foot shot off. If these two sides were enemies, weren't
they supposed to hate each other?
For the rest of us, who may have a more balanced view of religion in American history, this film is refreshing. The battle sequences are very well done, and what is interesting here is how the leading characters have a social life outside of their army life. Unlike the movie 'Gettysburg,' where all of the attention was focused on either the battle or plans around a
campfire for the next day's battle, we see the tender side of these warriors, who can go from a tender husband and lover of children, to having an attitude of almost cold duty to deserters as well as the enemy. As a result, we see these people as being very human, and having to do often impossible jobs that they would look back as unbelievable.
And there is the human ineptness of some Generals--hardly gods--that got their men killed for no reason. The Union Forces were once on the outskirts of Fredericksburg unopposed. All they had to do was cross the river, take the town and high ground, and wait for Robert E. Lee. This should have been simple, but instead the Union Commander decided to wait for some boats to
arrive, and by the time the boats arrived, The Southern Army had fortified the city. Now the Union Forces had to build their bridges under enemy fire, fight in the town building to building and street to street, and then charge across an open field against Confederate soldiers protected by a stonewall. All of this is expertly handled on film. So much slaughter. Six hundred thousand men on both sides--about as many as the rest of our wars put together. No wonder soldiers were pinned down and
used the dead bodies of their comrades as protection from the incoming bullets. And yes, you do see and hear the bullets plunk into the dead bodies that are used for protection.
What is a great aid to this film is that all the scenes were filmed on location whenever possible. The town of Harper's Ferry served as Fredericksberg, and as a result the film makers had at their disposal an entire town with the original Civil War era buildings still in place. They even had empty lots upon which to add the buildings that would be blown up to show the results of a town being shelled.
The dvd is also loaded with extras, and once you are done watching this nearly four hour movie, you can easily spend another 90 minutes if not more watching some of the dvd documentaries.

So why did the South loose the war? Perhaps it was because of their mistaken assumption that the South was on the same par as the Kingdom of God, and to fight for one was to fight for the other. Then there is the fact that the cream of Southern leadership were killed in battle. Then there are the lack
of resources. After nearly two years of fighting, you would think an army would be adequately supplied by that time, but still soldiers were marching without shoes. Then there is the chaos of the Confederacy. How does a government order a war draft, while at the same time not interfering in state's rights?
Perhaps the bottom line is that the South never really had a
chance. They had no cannon factories, and largely relied on older technology for firepower. It was really a question of who would outlast each other--the North that suffered defeat after defeat after defeat in the first couple of years of the war, or the South, which was always lacking anything needed to fight a war--except spirit.
'Gods and Generals' takes the viewer through these opening years of the war when fighting a battle was more of a guessing game by untried and untrained troops. Who would ever guess that as much of a slaughter as these opening years of the war were, they would only get worse, as the North would go on to lose 50,000 men in 1864 alone. That will be the subject of the next Civil
War film, 'The Last Full Measure."" Both sides gave it all they had, and 'Gods and Generals'  does about a good a job as one could hope for in getting the story right. This is a rarity in Hollywood, which tends to print legends over facts. Still, the movie is four hours long, and even then it skips over details.",1059955200,3,8206,4.509738079247818
1887391,2,B00009OOFB,"I live in the Capital of the Confederacy so naturally I awaited with great anticipation the release of Gods and Generals.  What a waste of over 3 1/2 hours.  The battle scenes were good, but the story lines never get developed nor do the characters.  Rather I am left with the feeling that I watched Thomas Jackson lead sermon and quote scripture for two hours of the movie.  Not what I expected at all.  Jackson may have been an EXTREMELY pious man and have been compelled to feel as though he were serving God's will by casting out the invading horde (the Federals), but the movie gets lost in the constant dialogue to this end.  Truly lost unfortunately.  Do yourselves a favor and pick up the book instead.",1059782400,5,710,4.5
1887392,4,B00009OOFB,"The road to historical accuracy is paved with good intentions. Yet Ronald F. Maxwell's prequel to his award winning ""Gettysburg,"" proves that the best laid intentions of film makers to depict historical events, sometimes go astray. Gods and Generals is a valiant effort and enjoyable film. The obstacles that presented themselves to Maxwell, however, result from the length and breath of the events he has transposed to the screen. Whereas ""Gettysburg"" occupied a time window of three-days, Gods and Generals covers most, but not all the events within a two year span. This longer historical time frame leaves what Maxwell brought to the screen, and what he omitted, open to more scrutiny than his previous effort. Maxwell treads a tightrope between a chivalrous southern perspective and a ""Lost Cause"" interpretation. The only two African-American characters in the film, Jackson's loyal cook Jim Lewis ( Frankie Faison) and a housekeeper of a well-to-do Fredericksburg family, have their own motives for survival. Yet clearly Maxwell had not even scratched the surface of the complex issue of slavery. In addition, the focal character of Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson (Stephen Lang) adds to the multitude of choices the film maker must decide concerning the opposing forces of myth versus the ""human face"" approach to this well known historical figure. Recruiting Civil War historian and Jackson scholar James I. Robertson, Jr. as a consultant to the film, Maxwell chose to dispel the common myths of Jackson and convey the human side of this complex man. Absent are the eccentricities and foibles that have become all too familiar: the constant eating of lemons, even in the heat of battle, is strangely replaced by a symbolic penchant for lemon-aid. Jackson's hypochondriac obsession with his own body (particularly concerning his arms and hands) is replaced by wounds suffered in battle. Amplified are his deep religious zeal; his devotion as a loving husband and caring father. Absent too is the full impact of Jackson's military genius. Along with not more than a hint of America's bloodiest day, the battle of Antietam/Sharpsburg, is the complete omitting of the campaign that sealed Jackson's place as a great captain-the Shenandoah Valley Campaign. Perhaps a mere montage to suggest the process of Jackson's string of military victories between First Manasas and Fredericksburg would have benefited this film greatly. The team work between Robert E. Lee (Robert Duvall) and Jackson, that culminated in the famous council of war between these two great military tacticians at Chancellorsville, likewise, did not come across as it could have in the film. The focus on Jackson as the film's central character, consequently regulated Lee to a backseat role. Even the outstanding acting talents of Duvall, (one of my all-time favorite actors) could not rectify this position bestowed upon him by Maxwell. On the plus side, the battle scenes are spectacular. The film's climax, the battle of Fredericksburg, is depicted accurately from beginning to end. The hand full of actors that return to their characters from ""Gettysburg"" lend a welcome continuity to what should emerge as one of the epic film trilogies of recent times. The DVD's many extras reveal the film maker's noble intentions for historical accuracy. Unfortunately, in four hours of film, some of these good intentions fell short. In spite of its shortcomings, Gods and Generals deserves a place in any history and film lover's library.

1887393,5,B00009OOFB,"This part of the series is much better than the first: better cinemetography, more historically accurate, etc. The movie is about soldiers and the war that they fought. I was again sickened to hear a few people lament that it didn't talk much about ""the cause"" in their mind, i.e., slavery, etc. Why don't they say such things about any other war movie? Did Private Ryan sit there with a solilique on why he fought? Did you hear it in the Band of Brothers? Here it was done well and in the right measure. When my cavalry squadron was deployed to Bosnia, I can tell you for sure that we didn't talk about ""the cause""; that's up to the politicians. We talked about our families,home, each other, and ""the enemy."" For those of you who have never been in the military and still hang on to the fallacy that Civil War soldiers all sat around the camp fire discussing ""the cause"" through glasses 150 years later really need to get a grip. And for all those that worship at the Glory alter, albiet a great flick, it was less historically accurate in my view and was not representative of the war. The 54th Mass was the exception and not the rule. Here, in Gods and Generals, both sides are viewed; the majority is viewed. Granted, it does mostly revolve around Stonewall Jackson, but that is a good thing. I thank Ron Maxwell and all of those who made this historically important film a reality.

1887394,5,B00009OOFB,"I find this film to be an excellent, detailed, highly accurate portrayal of the spirit of the time in which it took place.  People tended to speak in flowery phrases and religious convictions were central to many, if not most, lives.  Ron Maxwell and cast deliver the goods when it comes to these issues.  I strongly feel that the central irony of the Civil War (there were many) was captured in this film - that people of good will and strong moral certainty, motivated by concepts such as honor, loyalty, courage and devotion to home and family find themselves committing the ultimate sin of murdering one's fellow human beings in the name of those values.  Was this film too long?  In my opinion, it was not long enough.",1059696000,3,723,4.6171875

1. It is unconscionably long and tedious for no reason. You will want to scream.
2. It does feature overweight, no-talent reenactors who lumber slowly up the battlefields towards their equally pudgy enemy.
3. It does glorify Stonewall Jackson until I wanted to vomit, and gives him credit for having a sense of humor and a racial tolerance that are simply unhistorical.
4. It does leave out Shiloh, Antietam, and in fact any battle that does not glorify the Confeds.
5. Pointless dialogue, bad music, horrible appearance by Ted Turner, endless parlor scenes of people talking drivel, poorly-conceived battle scenes, etc. etc.
6. It does whitewash of the slavery issue. The Civil War was fought to preserve slavery---that's why those 11 states seceded. Their elite, slave-owning leaders were afraid Lincoln and the newly-elected Republican administration were going to start taking away their slaves. The Confederates had a BAD CAUSE, and they lost, and they should have lost. Get over it, Johnny Reb, and move on.",1059609600,22,1132,5.026595744680851
1887396,5,B00009OOFB,"Though it has been the point of critical controversy, Gods and Generals comes out way on top. Ron Maxwell's creative storytelling shows the civil war with such authority and authenticity that no other film can even match up to it. What makes this movie special is that it is not all blood and gore, but it shows what civilian and home life was like in that era. Gen. Jackson (played brilliantly by Stephen Lang) is the true American hero in this film. His couragous nature and love for God makes him a person that every young man should look to as a hero. Joshua L. Chamberlain (played again by Jeff Daniels) continues his complex character in this film. Although he appears older than in ""Gettysburg"" he is still able to make his authority known quickly. There are numerous other chracters who are played by the same actors in this film who were in ""Gettysburg"". A few of the establishing shots of the cities are a bit cartoonish. However there have been many who have been pounding on this issue. I feel that visual effects do not make a difference in this film, for it is a film about a strugle between humans.

The only complaint I have is that the movie is about three and a half hours long.  But I loved the fact of the movie that the reason our country is here is for freedom to worship God!! I know and appreciate that is why we have America today. I was extremely impressed that Ted Turner even let that be shown in his movie.  Even though God doesn't sell movie tickets but to show this country's history true to the core is to show that we were had very spiritual leaders in battles.  I really loved that about this movie because not very many people are so bold to put facts like that in any type of movie. So I have to give this movie 4 stars!!!!,1059523200,2,742,4.089655172413793
1887399,2,B00009OOFB,"After Gettysburg, Gods and Generals was an acute disappointment. One would have expected a great deal more, given that director Ron Maxwell was again at the helm, that ""the formula"" seemed clear, and that Robert Duvall replaced Martin Sheen as Robert E. Lee - an urgently needed up-grade. But, no, they tried to do too much, they let the tentacles of political correctness creep into the mix, they let Ted Turner have a speaking role, and ""in general,"" the whole thing was sub-par: a nearly four hour mess that had you wondering if this could POSSIBLY be the same gang that made Gettysburg. Some specific irritations...
The script seems to be 80% speeches and Great Discourses on Events of the Time. Few people have real, back and forth conversations. It is maddening - like a string of Shakespearian soliloquies.
The music isn't worth a grade B film, much less an epic. At one battle scene from out of nowhere comes a chorus of women's voices with a ludicrously inappropriate piece that distracts from, rather than adds to, the tapestry they are attempting to paint.
Most of the story is woven around Stonewall Jackson. Now, in real life, he was either a ""deeply pious"" man or a religious whack job, depending upon your personal perspective. Here's a guy who wouldn't mail a letter just before the weekend because it might be carried on the Sabbath (but who found some convoluted reasoning that allowed him to fight on Sunday). Watching the film, however, you soon get tired of his sanctimonious prayers and his invoking God incessantly. Strangely, too, Maxwell choose Stephen Lang for the part - he who played George Pickett in the earlier film; makes you do some double takes. Lang has come along way from his wooden ""Crime Story"" performances, but he ""ain't no Errol Flynn,"" and that's what the part called for.
There's a black character, a head cook, that's apparently supposed to add historical perspective to the film, specifically the ""role of the black man in the war-torn South,"" and after introducing him, the movie drops him for over two hours! He then gratuitously pops up at the death bed scene. I'm not sure, but I doubt that Stonewall's cook was at his side as he expired. Certainly his widow's written account of the deathbed scene makes no mention of him.
At one point in the story, two soldiers on opposite sides of the war and a river they're standing beside, shout greetings and agree to exchange tobacco and coffee. These kinds of things are well documented from the war; but, in order to be ""deeply philosophical"" and/or ""arty,"" Maxwell decides to have them come together, exchange coffee cup and pipe, and just stand there SILENT for a long while as the scene fades to black. With these two men taking a break from hell, after trying to kill one another but still being ""brothers,"" hundreds of miles from home, getting to see the human measure of the enemy up close and personal, we are expected to believe that they wouldn't say a single word to each other? It's just absurd.
There were three major battles depicted, and that's simply too much for an audience to assimilate. It worked in Gettysburg because it was all in the same place and the strategic issues were all the same. In Gods and Generals, they should have focused just on Chancellorsville, Lee's greatest triumph and where Jackson is mortally wounded by his own soldiers. Speaking of Lee, he should have been MUCH more prominent in the story.
Joshua Chamberlain was ""but a shadow of his former self,"" as portrayed in Gettysburg, but not in girth: Jeff Daniels was at least 40 pounds heavier, which was disconcerting.
So, it is disappointing indeed. Let's hope they get back on track with the last part of the trilogy which is currently planned for, but may be imperiled by the understandably poor showing Gods and Generals had in theaters.",1059523200,7,3827,4.765060240963855
1887400,2,B00009OOFB,"I am not normally compelled to write a movie review, but as with many here, I feel the need to do so for this movie.  This film could have been so much, if only the production staff had seen to it that the technical details were taken care of.
Cons:
1)  For Heaven's sake, hire a writer!  Having just re-read the original book, it looks like the writing staff for G&G was paid by the word.  Could have been better off lifting the lines verbatim from the original....
2)  Completely left out Gen. Hancock, one of Shaara's main characters from the book.
3)  The soundtrack was ponderous and did not always match the visual image and was overdone.
4)  The editors obviously were paid by the foot....of film left in the final reel that is.
5)  The battle scenes were excellent, but the true high drama of some of these actions were not well explained to the casual viewer (those who aren't history buffs).
6)  Ted Turner's awful cameo....
Pros
1)  First feature film to genuinely tackle the historical background of the Civil War.
2)  Solid, at times excellent, acting (unfortunately, they could not consistently overcome the script).
3)  Filmed on location at the actual battlefields.
Bottom Line:  Detailed, yes, however detail enhances a film, rather than makes it.  PLEASE, Ted Turner, take care of the basics (script, editing, balanced character development) before worrying about the details for the Last Full Measure!!!",1059436800,11,1422,4.822314049586777

1887402,5,B00009OOFB,"""Unrelentingly brilliant"".  Those aren't my words, but they could be.  That was the description by columnist Greg Kane of the Baltimore Sun.  God's and Generals is a film made for a different audience than most of those going to theatres today.  If you're idea of cinematic brilliance is Spiderman and Matrix, don't waste your time with this.  If, however, you love the great epics of the past, Ben Hur, Gone With The Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, you'll love this.  This is a film that harkens back to a time when character counted and entertainment meant more than stringing together 10 car chases.  The performance of Stonewall Jackson by Stephen Lang is remarkable and turns what would be a very good film into a great one.  One criticism I read of the film is that it is a movie that was made for people who read.  YES! Exactly.  But that shouldn't be a criticism of Gods and Generals.  That's a criticism of what passes for movies in our culture.  If you want to watch a film that will move you, educate you, and stay with you, then watch Gods and Generals.

1887403,5,B00009OOFB,"Reviewers have been very unfair to this film. The intention of a film drawn from a book are often revealed by the changes a scriptwriter or director makes.  By making Jackson the focus of the film instead of Lee(who was the hero of the novel)the focus was placed on the competing spiritualities.  Jackson enters the battle after prayer Chamberlain quotes a classical author's narrative of Ceasar at the Rubicon.  Jackson represents a style of spirituality no longer tenable in our world, which was fading even in his own time, yet many of us are nostalgic for this simplistic faith. neither is Chamberlain's clacisism a replacement.  We still search for a spirituality to replace the lost style represented by Jackson.  The film deserves the title even more than the novel.  The film has a spiritual depth that is rare in a modern film.",1059436800,3,836,4.852112676056338
1887404,4,B00009OOFB,"This is a great movie for anyone seriously interested in the Civil War. I say 'Seriously interested', because it's nearly four hours long, and much of that time is taken up with speeches, rather than action.
I can find only one shortcoming in the movie--it doesn't cover Antietam. Rumor has it that the battle was shot (no pun intended) and will be released a part of an even longer version of the movie at some point in the future. I came away from this movie feeling that I knew Stonewall Jackson, and I was blown away by Robert Duvall's portrayal of Robert E. Lee. I thought he did a far better job than Martin Sheen did in 'Gettysburg'.
One reviewer on this page harrumphed that 'Gods and Generals' is the first film to cover what the Civil War was really about. I think that reviewer missed a very important point. The war was about different things to the North and the South. Of course the South wasn't fighting a war to preserve slavery. Slavery was dead, and most Southerners new it. A surprising number of Southerners were opposed to it on the same moral grounds as their Northern neighbors. But they resented like hell having a bunch of Yankees telling them what to do.
To the North, the war really was about slavery, as any school child north of the Mason-Dixon line knows. Lincoln tried his best to confine the issue to preservation of the Union, but he was forced to issue the Emancipation Proclamation to keep Northern support.
'Gods and Generals' has been criticized for a supposedly pro-Southern bias. If you grew up in the North, it does offer a glimpse of how Southerners view the war. There's a reference elsewhere on this page to the war having been referred to at the time as 'the Rebellion'. But those who grew up in the South will recall the old-timers referring to it as 'the Late Unpleasantness'. A quaint term for the bloodiest conflict in American history.",1059436800,4,1884,4.593471810089021
1887405,4,B00009OOFB,"Gods and Generals can only be described as a near classic.  Not as good as Gettysburg, but clearly an incomplete vision of the director's total movie, due out December of 2004.  G&G has a clear Southern slant to it.  In fact, in some ways the movie would have been better off focusing solely on the Confederates in this movie.  Jeff Daniels is wasted in a role that was really unnecessary and in which he obviously showed little interest.  Duvall was much to old for the early war RE Lee, who actually had very little gray.  The movie lacks the necessary showing of the relationships between the generals, especially Lee and Jackson.  It makes it hard to accept Lee really being too moved by Jackson's death when they have shared only about 2 minutes of screen time.
In spite of all of that, this movie portrays Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson as a hero of the war, which he clearly was.  Brilliant and eccentric, Stephen Lang turns in a totally authentic, Oscar caliber performance.  Brian Millan is equally effective as reluctant Union general Handcock, although he needed much more airtime.  This movie must be taken for what it is, a historically accurate albiet incomplete portrayal of a different age.",1059436800,,1202,4.79126213592233

Having read the book, I was sorry to see how much of the story had been left on the cutting room floor. The movie also does not quite capture the full sense of the impenetrable defenses of the battle for Marye's Heights in Fredericksburg, but felt it was a good reenactment.  The best narrative of this battle I have read is in the book Bayonets Forward by J.L. Chamberlain.",1059436800,,477,4.3
1887407,2,B00009OOFB,"There is, I suppose, two schools of thought when viewing these historical semi-documentary films. One is to watch it for the entertainment value and disregard the historical accuracy. Gods and Generals, I'll admit, does succeed as an entertaining film even with the almost four hour duration and should be appealing to non-history (read non-Civil War) buffs. The other school is, of course, the historian's perspective and how the film realistically (or not) paints the subject matter. Here, Gods and Generals fails terribly on many levels and made the movie for me a somewhat major disappointment.
The only real redeeming value in this work is the battle scenes. When a film's producers take the time and trouble to try to accurately depict major Civil War struggles such as First Manassas, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville on the actual battlefields (although the jury is still out in my mind as to whether the Fredericksburg battlfield shown is real or computer enhanced) they get my attention. The battle action shown is somewhat accurate although the producers greatly needed to ""set-up"" each battle...it's easy for the Civil War buff to understand the charge and counter charge of Henry House Hill at Manassas or the importance and relevancy of Stonewall Jackson's flanking march around the Federal right flank at Chancellorsville, but the general viewer is left to assume that what is shown is how it was and this detracts from the quality of the film in my view.
Another downside to this film is the portrayal of Stonewall Jackson...if the producer's intent was to have this as a biographical work, then they should have advertised it as such and let the prospective movie-goer discern whether to see it or not. And if it was the intent, then they've failed miserably. Stephen Lang portrays Jackson not at all like the Jackson thats depicted in the history books...the real Jackson was extremely eccentric (he would occasionally suck on a lemon during a battle), aloof (subordinates never knew where they were headed or why) and very unkempt. The Lang version shows him as clean, warm, personable...almost omnipotent. Nowhere do we see the independant Jackson of Cedar Mountain or the Jackson who pouted so badly during the Peninsula Campaign that he slept under a tree during the critical maneuvers to the Gaines Mill battlefield. These were extremely important components of his character and should have been given equal billing.
Another inexcusable omission...how in God's name can any film that portrays the early portions of the Civil War not include George McClellan, the afore mentioned Peninsula Campaign and (the almost criminal omission) the battle at Antietam?? Perhaps the producers could have taken some of the time spent on the contrived scenes like the Confederates singing around the Christmas tree or the ridiculously idealistic conversations that every person (important or not) seemed to have to show these important battles. It would have succeeded in making the film the requisite four hours and would have greatly enhanced the quality of the movie.
The movie ""Gettysburg"" had some of these flaws, but the over-riding virtue of that classic film was the driving intensity and dogged adherence to the standard history that made it stand out. Sadly, Gods and Generals seemed to concentrate too much on the ""atmosphere"" and lost the big picture because of it. I have not as yet read Jeff Shaara's book that this film was based on, but I'll bet that it was much better organized and much truer to history's version of the initiation of the Civil War.",1059350400,7,3579,5.098807495741056

1887411,4,B00009OOFB,"Let me begin by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed this film, which I did not have the opportunity to see in the theater.  This is probably just as well--this is a long movie, almost a miniseries.  It is lovingly done, with an attention to detail that is almost astounding.  As others have noted, about the only consistently wrong detail in this movie is the well-fed look of the re-enactment extras; real Civil War soldiers on both sides were lean to an extent that is hard to appreciate today.  Some of the chubby fellows in this film would have slimmed down very quickly on the skimpy rations and forced marches that characterized this long hard conflict.  Having said that, it seemed to me that at least these re-enactment actors were a bit slimmer that the chubbers in ""Gettysburg.""  No big deal.
This is the story of the early portion of the Civil War, as written in Jeff Shaara's fine novel ""Gods and Generals,"" a prequel to ""The Killer Angels"" by his father, Michael Shaara.  The acting is consistently good, but this is not a perfect movie.  It follows the ""Dances With Wolves"" genre in that it is far too long in my opinion, and many scenes could have either been deleted or truncated.  They were not, and this film contains many long scenes that contribute little to the main storyline, which is essentially the story of the early Confederate victories in the war, and Thomas (""Stonewall"") Jackson's superb generalship and unique personality.  ""Gettysburg"" the movie to which this is a prequel, is not a short movie either, but its storyline moves along much snappier than this one, even though this film contains three battles rather than one, and in my opinion this should have enabled the director to concentrate better on the storyline since he had plenty of material to work with.  Just my opinion; there are doubtless many others.
All that having been said, I really enjoyed the film.  Although some may not approve, one thing that this film did was avoid the ""Politically Correct"" interpretation of the Confederate cause and the Civil War itself.  While it acknowledges that slavery was one of the central issues in the war, it also emphasizes that there were other factors that led to the war, and that early on most Union men felt that they were fighting to preserve the Union, not to end slavery.  Some will criticize this film for being somewhat pro-Southern, and I think that this is probably true in the sense that the film relentlessly reminds the viewer that the Southern cause derived from the belief that the Confederate Army was defending the very homes and hearths of its soldiers.  This is emphasized in the film far more than the Union cause is, and for that matter it seemed to me that there were more scenes dealing with the Southern side than the Union side.  To that extent it is fair to say that this film gives a suprisingly favorable treatment to the Southern cause in these days of political correctness.  But another interpretation of this point of view is that it is an undeniable fact that the Confederate Army, always outnumbered and outsupplied, nevertheless marched from victory to victory during the early portion of the war, and not all of this can be explained by good generalship.  In fact the men were motivated by a cause in which they believed deeply, and this combined with skillful leadership caused the Confederate Army to become one of the great armies of all time.  By emphasizing what was undeniably a sincere belief in the Southern cause, this film does a creditable job explaining why the Confederate Army was so remarkably successful, and why this war was, and remains, the bloodiest and hardest war Americans have ever known.
Overall, if you interested in the Civil War, you will appreciate and enjoy this film.  If not, this maybe is not for you.",1059091200,8,3808,4.749620637329286

1887413,1,B00009OOFB,"10 reasons this movie was bad:
1. Battle scenes featuring slow-moving, overweight, middle-aged reenactors of zero talent. (These were YOUNG armies, remember.)
2. Unexciting and uninspired staging of the battle scenes--even Chancellorsville.
3. No mention of Antietam or Shiloh (these were not Confederate victories, however.)
4. The sugar-coated deification of Stonewall Jackson (fervently religious, yes; a nice guy beloved by his troops, no.) There is a ludicrous scene in which Jackson, a fervent proponent of slavery, prays with a devoted black servant for divine guidance over whether slavery is a godly institution or no.
5. Robert Duvall's wooden portrayal of Robert E. Lee, and the fact that Duvall looks at least 20 years too old to play Lee. This was Duvall's personal Appomattox, I'm afraid--the only time he ever gave a less than sterling performance.
6. Cheesy, painted-on-glass special effects.
7. An obtrusive and weirdly inappropriate musical score.
8. An ideological bias that ressurrects that worn-out, totally fabricated Dixie rationale the the Civil War was fought for Southern Independence against Northern Aggression and not at the behest of the wealthy planter class in order to preserve the institution of slavery.
9. Sentimentality runs amok as Irish regiments on both sides are shown to be (oh-so-tragically) killing each other at Fredericksburg. The tragedy of this is only apparent to crazed Celtophiles who think the death of any Irishman, for any cause, whether good or bad, is the world's great loss.
10. Dull performance by Jeff Daniels as Joshua Chamberlain, who is singled out for the benefit of the sequel, apparently, and because he is one of the few Union heroes who really appeals to the right-wing fundamentalists who are the target audience for this picture.",1059004800,11,1798,5.334507042253521

As a big fan of the movie Gettysburg, my hopes where shattered at the portrayal of Stonewall Jackson, and his fanatic worship with the Lord, it almosts seems as if he is insane. The battle of Manasas is extremely lame, especially the birth of Jackson's nickname, which was poorly acted by whoever said it. The battles where weak, and it seemed they did not go into the extra depth as in Gettysburg. I gave it two stars and not one, because the Battle of Fredricksburg is worth seeing.

The film fails on numerous fronts chief among these is the fact that it tried to do too much and too much of the story was focused around one man namely stonewall jackson,while i have no problem with his strong religious convictions the audience was beaten over the head with it and after the second prayer vigil it became downright overbearing infact i'm convinced that if he survived the war he would have blown his brains out because it would prove conclusively God didn't believe in the ""Cause"" G&G would have worked as a film if like its predecessor Gettysburg it focused on one pivotal battle which in this case would have been Chancellorsville which was without a doubt the highwater mark for the Confederacy and a showcase for the dynamic duo of Lee and Jackson. Men in battle and under constant fire gives more insight to their characters than how many times a day they pray. That said the battles scenes were ok though they failed to evoke the true carnage of a civil war battlefield and stephen lang turned in a fine performance , but if you have absolutely no interest in the civil war then you may as well skip this one , which is a shame because one of the hallmarks of a good movie is that it sparks your interest where before their was none.",1058918400,,1359,4.461847389558233

If I was a soldier in the 20th Maine standing behind Joshua L Chamberlain as we prepared to assault Maryee's Heights, and he ran off into a speech like that, I think I'd have shot him myself.
I thought I might take it better if I rented it so I could advance the video. But now my wife was even laughing at the dialogue. ""Me espousa"" Oh puhleeeze ! And Jackson's death was treated like the death of King Arthur.
The men on both sides in the awful conflict were valorous in the extreme. They deserve to be presented better. I'd love to see a REAL director handle this story,not some ego maniac who wrote AND directed it. I would've loved to see ""The Angel of Maryee's Heights"" a Confederate soldier who couldn't take the agonizing crys of the wounded Federals anymore so he filled up canteens and climbed over the wall and onto the battle field to give then drinks.

1887417,5,B00009OOFB,"I eagerly awaited the prequel to Gettysburg, and was much gratified by the movie. It's very historically accurate and entertaining, though the dialogue gets to be a bit much at times. As an avid ACW buff, I'm often very critical of movies in that period but this succeeds admirably. While Gettysburg shows much of the reasons the North fought (espicially in the scene between Chamberlain and Kilrain) Gods and Generals provides a more Southern viewpoint. It also delves deeply into the rather enigmatic character of Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson, who all-to-often is shown as a dogmatic and legalistic white supremacist. Stephen Lang brings an energetic spin to one of the greatest military leaders of all time. Robert Duvall's protrayal of Robert E. Lee leaves Martin Sheen sputtering in the dust. Still, Duvall looks way to old to be playing Lee early in the war, Lee was a still an vigorous, brown-haired man then. While he's still not what I think of when Lee is mentioned, Duvall does well. I do wish, however, that Longstreen/Berenger could have been involved. While the CG leaves much to be desired and the movie's complete ignoring the pivotal battle of Sharpsburg, I give the movie two thumbs up, for its willingness to go against the flow and show a viewpoint in the Civil War that is all to commonly ignored. Instead of showing the assumed and informed viewpoint that the war was solely about slavery.",1058918400,,1409,4.899581589958159

1887420,3,B00009OOFB,"History buffs, no doubt, will love this film. I am not meaning that armchair variety which enjoys its history in leather-bound illustrated volumes accompanied by a nice cup of tea, but those arguably insane fanatics who re-enact every footstep and skirmish of the Civil War forces and seem to enjoy camping in dripping tents on soggy ground, reminiscing of better days.
I think this film would have worked better as a mini-series for television, seeing as TV viewers seem more willing to put up with a very, very long film if it's split up into segments (witness the behemoth, North and South). As it is (9 minutes shy of four hours) not even the DVD format can save one from inevitable yawning.
However, this aside, it is an interesting summary (that hardly seems the right word) of Stonewall Jackson's career. The film is somewhat flowery (the principal characters, of which there are many, all speak in dialogue that resembles a combination of history textbooks and Byronic style) and rather glosses over the hideous injustices of the war (all of the slaves shown, of which there are few, seem very much to love their masters, something which doesn't strike me as realistic) but the battles are portrayed in vivid, painstakingly precise detail - even down to the labelling onscreen of the participating parties. (Perhaps the re-enactors at work here?)
It focuses more on the South's perspective, as seen through General Stonewall Jackson's point of view (the film could very nearly be a biopic of his career), but the scenes with Colonel Chamberlain of Maine and his brother are touching in their familiarity and sincerity. I wish they had included more of this; Chamberlain as portrayed by Jeff Daniels in ""Gettysburg"" (1993) was my favourite character and he is not given enough room to work here.
Robert Duvall is properly crusty as Robert E. Lee, a better choice in resemblance (and, surprisingly, performance) than Martin Sheen was in ""Gettysburg."" He is not onscreen often but his scenes are well-acted.
All-in-all, this film is nice for history buffs with an afternoon to kill, but not one to watch repeatedly. Much more enjoyable and superior to its ""prequel"" is the 1993 ""Gettysburg"", which features much of the same cast but is better balanced on the whole.

1887421,1,B00009OOFB,"As a high school U.S. History teacher I wanted to respond to an earlier post by saying that I would NEVER show this movie to a class of mine. The fact that the movie is painfully dull is reason enough. As a Southerner and decendent of Confenderate veterans I think this movie is disgraceful in the way that it tries to promote the old southern myth that the Civil War had little to do with slavery. I know that makes me ""politically correct"" but that is something I will have to live with. Slavery, racism and segregation were evil and we as southerners should try to admit it rather than trying to deny that it ever happened. I loved Gettysburg but perhaps that was because it did not seem to have such an agenda to it. Hopefully, the last movie in this series will be better. I felt like I had to rent this movie because I knew someone would ask me about it sooner or later. My advice to the rest of you is to avoid this movie and instead buy a book like ""Battle Cry of Freedom"" by James McPherson or any other good history on the Civil War.",1058832000,13,1043,4.1940298507462686

Gods and Generals by Jeff Shaara was much more detailed and much more moving than the movie that seemed to drag at points. Sometimes it seems as though it took longer to watch the movie than read the book. The books starts out with the John Brown raid at Harper's Ferry which helped develop the characters of Lee, Stuart and Jackson. The book also developed Chamberline's character early while he was a professor being penalized by the administration of Bowden college for speaking out against the rebellion and supporting the many students who joined the army. Also the scene where he tells his wife that he joined the army was much more moving and detailed in the book than in the movie. The build up to the war, was very important to get people to understand what was going on. I believe th
The movie was good in its description of the battles, but they forgot one major battle, the Battle of Antietam Creek. This was more bloody than Gettysburg and it was a union victory. I also wished that the end of the movie showed Lee and Longstreet planning the invastion of the North like in the book. A much better ending than Jackson's funeral march.
I did like the addition of the cook though, he was a powerful character and the book only showed one black character, Nate, one of Robert E Lee's former slaves.
I hope that if Ted Turner goes through with putting together the financing for ""Last Full Measure"" Ron Maxwell uses more of the book.

How many prayers do I need to listen to about keeping them safe and that they return? I've only managed to watch half the film because I got so bored. I then put in Gettysburg (which is just as long...I do have a long attention span) and enjoyed every minute. This is from the same director...I wish he'd done the movie the same way.

I believe this movie was one of the best Civil War movies I have seen.  It ranks up there with GLORY.  It's strange that while Ted Turner may be considered a nut by some, yet he continues to produce incredible historical epics.
I pray that the 3rd book of the Trilogy, THE LAST FULL MEASURE, is also brought to the cinema.  It is movies like this that remind us of the cost of our freedom that many now take for granted.",1058745600,8,676,4.25

You are probably aware of the story (and if not, you should be) as this is a prequel to the very succesful, and equally lengthy Gettysburg. This movie has historical accuracy and period detail overload, and I did wonder whether the armies of extra's who played in the film (most of whom belong to the actual relevant regiment historical societies) had more fun watching this movie, than general viewers. I would have loved to give this movie a better rating, but I just can't - it's long, lumbering, drawn out and what little story there is gets lost in the spectacle of it all. Another popular criticism was that for a movie dealing with slavery to have only two small talking roles for black actors is also a bit of a joke. There are a few small saving graces however, not least the excellent sombre performance of Robert Duvall, and the DVD has some nice extra's,  but on the whole it's a bladder testing exercise, and history lesson docudrama that would be just at home on the Discovery channel, as the big screen.

1887427,4,B00009OOFB,"I am a legitimate historian (not just self proclaimed).  Gods and Generals was still better than ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Glory"", etc.  I know I am risking my credibility, but I liked the movie.  Yes, it was not as accurate as I would have liked.  No, Jackson wasn't that one dimensional.  Yes, it was a lot more complicated than it appeared to be in the movie (the war, the politics, etc).  I was entertained.  There are times when historians and Civil War buffs alike must toss aside the historical accuracy anger and enjoy something.  Other than a re-enactment, that is as close to the real thing I will ever get.  There is just something about seeing it all bigger than life on the big screen (and little screen with the DVD).
It is a long long epic and one must realize this before watching the movie.  If you don't have the attention span to watch a 4 hour movie, then this is not your film.  The DVD offers the short attention span individual to start and stop at will.  This DVD version is a very good work with behind the scenes footage and music videos.  However, if you are serious about your ""Gods and Generals"" fix, hold out for the six hour version.  That one will have the Battle of Sharpsburg, John Wilkes Booth, and Abraham Lincoln (in addition to other footage not seen in the movie release).
""Gettysburg"" is a movie about an event and the people involved.  ""Gods and Generals"" is about the people (Jackson, Lee, Hancock, and Chamerlain) and the events around them.  Remember, this is a film based off a historical FICTION.  Although very accurate (for a hollywood film) there are hollywoodized parts.
Too many historians and buffs dislike it, because they were expected to.  Well, not I.  I've written works and have spent many many hours researching both for fun and requirement.  And, consarn it, I like it.  The movie (as did Gettysburg) pulled in a lot of non-historians into this genre.  That is important.  Was it the best movie of all time?  Nope.  Was it the worst?

Creative liberties asside, This movie is way too long.  It probably could have been about an hour long if they would have cut out all the irrelevant Hollywood mumbo jumbo.  Scene after scene tries to get you to identify with characters and understand their reasons for entering the war.  I get it already.  I don't have to see Stonewall Jackson spout out another ten minute prayer to understand that he's religious.
Part of the problem with this movie is that it tries to make everyone look like they were fighting this war for all the right reasons.  That way you'll feel really bad when they die.  It don't think that the Civil War was always that heroic and simple.
Now maybe they toned the violence down to get a PG-13 rating, but a movie about the Civil War is not a place to do that.  Every time someone gets shot in this movie, they die instantly and painlessly.  It wasn't that painless in reality and  I think showing it that way takes away from the horror of the war that claimed more americans than any other.
My final criticism is that the fake beards used in this movie were absolutely terrible.  There were scenes where I couldn't pay attention to what the characters were saying because I was too busy stareing at the aweful beards on the actors faces.  Some of them actually looked like they were coming off.  The actors have these smooth, young faces and a beard that would take five years to grow.  It just looks bad.
The only good thing is the cinematography.  The film does look beautiful, even during the most pointless scenes.  But there's plenty of other great looking films out there with much better stories.",1058659200,8,1832,4.5426829268292686

I won't even make an effort to address the problems with this movie. There are simply too many reasons why this film failed so miserably.

Where and why?
Where is the rumored 6-hour version of this film?
Where are the other important battles?
Why are Lee, Chamberlain and Hancock turned into a supporting cast for Jackson?
Where is the dialogue between characters?
Why so many speeches and quotations?
Why cut out battles but leave in long scenes of Ted Turner singing?
Why so one sided? I can't remember Gettysburg so blatantly taking a side.
Why ignore history and just plop Lee into command of the Army like that?
I could go on but I won't.  Its not an awful movie and is worth a viewing if you are interested in the Civil War or more particularly Stonewall Jackson but it could have been so much more. I can only hope that a longer cut of this film surfaces at some point because I believe it would fix many of the items I questioned above.
Of all the things that killed my enthusiasm for this film I would say the two biggest ones are the never-ending speeches and the lack of development of the other major characters. To be honest I fell asleep watching this DVD the first time after the first hour because it was 45 minutes of preaching and speeches. In regards to the other main characters I feel that Lee, Chamberlain or Hancock would have made even more compelling main characters than Jackson.

In Gods and Generals, all the characters are speaking as if a reporter were sitting in the corner or a tape recorder on the table.  Every dialog was constructed as a soliloqy delivered upon a stage.  I know these events were life changing and history making, but when you befuddle the actions with words dripping with life and death sincerity the message is lost.  The watcher is forced to endure language rather than the display of war.  The battle scenes were great I admit, but this was ruined by the tone.

It is rare that I find a movie so unwatchable that I have to augment it with more appealing pastimes such as balancing my checkbook or chewing on aluminum foil. The writing is a clicheed amalgam of every soap opera known to mom, the soundtrack a cheesy sendoff to every far superior period film, and the acting lends new meaning to the term honey-glazed Virginia ham. I can understand why so many of the characters sported gargantuan facial hair. If they need to find work in commercials after this elaborately failed opus, they would do better to conceal their identities. Don't get me wrong. I am a huge fan of Robert ""napalm in the morning"" Duvall and Mira Sorvino was a brief respite from the 25 other shameful deliveries, but on the most part, I am convinced that poor direction can make any seasoned artist look like a novice. I got the impression that all of the actors were told to deliver their lines in a cadence more bombastic than bombs and with such monosyllabic and quavering emphasis that even Arnold Schwarzenegger could laugh his way into the California governor's mansion. I'd be hard pressed to imagine even the most ardent civil war scholar to be satisfied with the emoting in such lines as ""Look! There is Jack-son! Stand-ing like a stone wall!"" Vomit! Never mind that the film has the historical integrity of a revisionist clansman or that the few African Americans portrayed ""was jess damn happy to haves a job workin fo dey nice massah,"" because the pitiful affectations of all the perpetrators on the screen renders that more sinister subtext practically innocuous. You figure at least with period films shot mostly on picturesque landscapes that the cinematography could be an occasional distraction from the events in the foreground, but even that had an uninspired, made-for-television superficiality that makes me think fondly of the old Ponderosa. I will say that the costumes were passable and the parlor scenes good for a laugh, but on the most part I didn't think the Civil War was supposed to be that funny.

After waiting an exceptionally long time (10 years) from Gettysburg we revist the prequel and for 4 hours listen to speech after speech after speech about people's personal views on the war.  There is dialogue that unless you've read several books on the battles or generals that you won't understand plus someone felt like they had to bring back as much as the original cast as they could so you see everyone stuffed into poor excuses for uniforms trying to play generals they have no business playing.  The guy playing Hancock looks very bloated and in lack of a neck.  One of the biggest dissapointments in the movie was Robert Duvall.  Usually a pleasure to watch, was stiff and looked like he was going to have a heart attack at any moment.  Bruce Boxlightner(sp?) was a poor excuse for a general Longstreet.

However, those who have both read Jeff Shaara's novel and seen the movie come away with a much more complete picture of the events and the people of the Civil War.  Most of the negative reviews I've read here focus on two points -that the film is too biased towards the South, and that the dialogue is boring.
The first complaint is why I recommend reading the novel.  The book recounts the stories of four men - Lee & Jackson from the South, Hancock & Chamberlain from the North. If Ron Maxwell had covered all four of these stories in the detail they all deserve he would have a 12 hour movie on his hands.  Instead he chose one facet to focus on, and it happened to be Stonewall Jackson.  I guess too many people just can't get their heads around the idea that not every Confederate was a whip-toting Simon LeGree - or the fact that a Black Virginian might feel compelled to defend his home from invasion.
To the complaint that the film was boring - maybe those who feel this way would have liked it better if Maxwell could have gotten Vin Diesel in it and hired Limp Bizkit to do the soundtrack.

Actor Stephen Lang gives an inspiring and remarkable performance as General Thomas J. Jackson.  If he doesn't get an Oscar, it only proves the poor taste of the Hollywood wine-and-cheese set. Fittingly, Stonewall Jackson becomes the focal character of this film, which covers the earlier years of the War Between the States up to the time of his tragic death. This movie has drawn criticism chiefly from the amoral minority who scoff at the pious portrayals of Christian faith, chilvary and nobility in a time when character counted for something. The reviews are quite polarized obviously. The critics are chiefly limousine liberals, those who loathe southern culture and people smug enough to believe the 1988 film 'Glory' captured the essence of the war and the historicity of the Union cause. Also, I'm kind of tired of hearing how it is too southern in its perspective, which probably comes because the Confederates were winning the battles during the time this film was set. (I'm not going to scoff at 'Gettysburg' as being ""too northern"" merely because the Union takes the upper hand.)

Anyway, Ron Maxwell has outdone himself with this film... it is quite a step up from Gettysburg; for the chief reason that the casting is better, the script is good and the cinematography is nothing short of a masterpiece.  There were some historical discrepencies like the two Irish brigades clashing. The soundtrack is beautiful.",1058486400,9,1575,5.0038167938931295
1887440,1,B00009OOFB,"The domination by the character of ""Stonewall"" Jackson and his, in the film at least, utter devotion to the predestination taught by Calvin leaves the film with no other major characters of interest.  Having read the book I'd hoped for visual insight into other generals in the book who were involved in the early Civil War; but they are essentially omitted.  Too bad; I believe that the war ended long after the death of Thomas Jackson and even when Jackson was alive many others, including several very interesting generals were also involved.  Others seem to have become transparent; Jackson, only Jackson, is protrayed with any depth here.  This may be the first DVD I return for a refund.",1058486400,4,693,4.8474576271186445

I decided to to watch this movie because I remember the one before they made this one wasn't bad.  From what I've heard, this was originally a 6 hr film cut down to a 3 or 4 hr film.  Maybe they should have cuttin it even more with with scenes added with fillers and this movie seeming to be more about God than the Generals.  On top of that, it was based mainly on one general and seemed to take a more biased favor for the South centering on General Stonewall Jackson.  The acting wasn't that great either. The only reason why I gave this movie 2 stars was for the fact that it was about American history, though this movie is a disgrace to American history.

The action sequences were very loud and the dialogue sequences were too low.  I found myself adjusting the volume throughout the film.  As a student of history, I would want to reccomend this film to young students as well as everyone elso who have no idea what went on during the Civil War.  This film brings lets one see an accurate depiction of what the war was about.
  This film was more about Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson than Robert E. Lee or Joshua Chamberlain.  It brings to bare the subject of why the South seceded.  It was not over slavery but over the rights of individual states. This film humanizes all the individuals and the stories/histories I had been raised with making them come alive.  This is what a historical film should do. It must teach a lesson, that war is hell and this war was fought to make all men free which ever side they fought on. This film does just that.

This was actually the Stonewall Jackson and the freedom loving Confederates story. I got a little tired of this revisionist saga especially the Black cook as one of the good ole boys in the Rebel camp. While Gettysburg focused mainly on the Confederate side it did offer a balance of compelling Union soldiers also. Gods and Generals throws in a few scenes with Jeff Daniels and that's about it. Characterizations on both sides made Gettysburg the classic that it was. I cared about everyone in it. G & G is strictly Jackson. If you love the South and Stonewall Jackson this is for you. If not, stay away. Only the carnage and slaughter of the Union forces at Fredericksburg was noteworthy for it's depiction of war and why we should try to avoid it.",1058400000,8,886,4.72258064516129

Sadly, nothing has changed, it is still a stunningly bad movie. Whenever I see a new Turner production has been released I think they can't get any worse than the others, but Gods and Generals has proven me wrong again, it approaches Ed Wood dimensions for plumbing the depths of dullness, tedium, and sloth. There are very few positive moments in Gods and Generals - Robert Duvall is always good (think how much he would have improved Gettysburg) and the scenes depicting Joshua & Fannie Chamberlain [Jeff Daniels/Mira Sorvino] are also very good, but after that you can stop watching this mess of a motion picture. Name any movie made about the Civil War - Glory, Red Badge of Courage, Shenandoah, The Birth of a Nation, Disney's Johnny Shiloh, and yes, even Gettysburg - they are all better productions than Gods and Generals.",1058400000,10,1005,4.748571428571428

1887446,2,B00009OOFB,"Note: the run time of the DVD is that of the theatrical release. Ron Maxwell (the director) had promised that the Battle of Antietam would be in a 6 hour version of the DVD. Either the lackluster box office returns prevented it, or there will be a special edition later.
As a Civil War enthusiast and amateur historian, I really wanted to like this movie. Instead I was disappointed. There are major story telling problems, and the vaunted ""accuracy"" of the film is debatable.
The Southern viewpoint is not as incorrect as some have suggested. The people portrayed as fighting for states rights historically _were_ fighting for states rights. Conveniently left out, though, is any pro-slavery viewpoint. Deliberately or not, _Gods and Generals_ is a shining example of ""Lost Cause"" orthodoxy.
Slavery itself is not well depicted. Only two African-American characters have speaking parts. One is fiercely loyal to her mistress, the other is Stonewall Jackson's cook (who shared an uncommonly close relationship with the general in real life). Both portrayals are accurate in themselves, but the picture they paint is far from complete. Nowhere do we see the legions of slave labor that followed Confederate armies, or the brutal living conditions endured by most slaves. The female slave loyally protects her mistress' home from Union looters in Fredericksburg. Missing are the slaves who openly helped the Yankees loot _their_ masters' houses.
If the Southern viewpoint is sanitized, so is the Northern. Nowhere does Maxwell mention the near mutinies in the Union armies over the Emancipation Proclamation. Unionists are all seen as anti-slavery. This was not the case. The U.S. of the 19th century, like most other countries at the time, was deeply racist. All of the Union characters appear as abolitionists, though abolitionists formed a small minority amongst Northern soldiers.
Maxwell's sins are mostly of omission, not commission. Individual surface details are accurate but only if they don't get in the way of the story.
The inaccuracies that do exist jar against the parts that are correct. Some inaccuracies are relatively minor (Jackson addressing his troops as the 2nd Corps well before the Confederacy could legally create corps). Others are far worse (Jackson learning of Hooker's movements at the beginning of the Chancellorsville campaign). Jackson's dying words don't include his call for A.P. Hill (one of my favourite bits of Civil War trivia, as Robert E. Lee called for Hill when he was dying, too). Am I being picky? Perhaps, but if Maxwell spent the time to get the cap badges and buttons correct, why did he play around with the more important elements? Like most Hollywood directors he was happy throwing accuracy out the window if it got in the way of the story.
This wouldn't be so bad if the story was well told. It's not. There are huge gaps in time and space. We jump from the spring of 1862 to December of that year, completely ignoring the bloody spring and summer campaigns. The battle of Antietam was filmed, but cut from the finished version (and left out of this DVD). Stonewall Jackson is the major character of the film, yet his valley campaign and his role at Fredericksburg are completely ignored. The Chancellorsville sequence ignores the first and third days of the battle. There are a lot of long speeches, a deliberate nod to _The Killer Angels_/_Gettysburg_, but they are overly long and terribly repetitive. At least half an hour of talking could have been cut easily without affecting the story.
Maxwell did get some things right. Jackson's passionate love life with his wife is brilliantly shown. The battles looked like they involved vast numbers of men (though they are not altogether accurate; don't expect a realistic depiction of gore and suffering, ala _Saving Private Ryan_). The period costumes are wonderful. I loved the shots of Harper's Ferry, Fredericksburg and some of the other lanscape shots (in spite of what some reviewers have said about them). This was the first film I have ever seen that gave me a true sense of what the Civil War would have looked like. For this reason I recommend seeing the film, but I can't recommend it as a good movie.
Maxwell tried to cover too much time and too many people. If he had focused on one or two battles, or just on Jackson, it could have been a superior film. Instead, it suffers badly from having to act as _Gettysburg_'s prequel, a more satisfying movie due to its focus and better source material.",1058400000,16,4507,4.962962962962963
1887447,5,B00009OOFB,"I enjoyed every minute of this movie. The only improvement I might have made would have been to start the story earlier in the time frame.
The movie was - despite being a little sterile - very accurate historically and should go a long way to fix may peoples misunderstanding about the war. Much as Gangs of New York showed much of the strife in the north during thre war like the Draft Riots.
The war between the states was not even a real ""civil war"" anyway. A civil war is defined as a battle between two factions fighting for the control of a county. The south never wanted control over the north, merely the right to seceed and have some modicum of self determination much as the 13 colonies seceeded from England. It was truly a war of agression by the north against the south - at time an independant sovereign nation.
I wish the movie went a little deeper into this. What was portrayed was accurate even is some people don't like it.
I loved the acting and the scenery and ther was a sense of a larger canvas in the background.
In spite of what a previous reviewed said about the ""good guys"" winning. I cannot imagine anyone thinking that Lincoln and Shermans behavior in any way qualified them as ""good guys"".
In just world they should have both been hanged as war criminals.

This is Top Knotch entertainment at it's finest. The Civil War brought to life right before your eyes, the portrayal of a period of history so realistic that it will transport you to the 1860's and offer you a time capsule into the conflict that shaped the future of America and resounded all over the civilized world. Ron Maxwell and a team of expert's have combined with a story so compelling that it leaps from the television screen and into your parlour. Thousands of dedicated reenactors willingly donated their time and authenticity to ensure that the hero's of yesterday are able to depict their reasons for engaging in this most costly of conflicts as well as providing a means of bringing the voices and mannerisms of a time long forgotten for most North Americans. It is a military history on celuloid, a religious experience from a time where men and women made their faith a centerpiece in their lives and soldiers fought for ideals and dreams. It is the defense of hearth and home; a springboard for the fight for liberty and freedom. It brings to life the trials and tribulations of Thomas Jonathan Jackson, his belief and faith in God, his absolute conviction as a soldier do his duty for his country and his loyalty to his comrades in arms. It is the story of Robert E. Lee, Joshua Chamberlain, and Jim Lewis, the cook, servant and friend of General Stonewall Jackson as they live through the tumultuous times of the American Civil War. It is a tale of brother fighting brother, father fighting son in a classic battle to the death in the cause of states rights versus a centralized Federal government that results in a most accurate depiction of the first two years of the War Between the States.

Gods and Generals was an okay film for entertainment purposes only it would seem though I found it's depictions of American Slavery to be more than insulting. I am thinking the black cook was either too ignorant to know what was going on or that he was a dear friend to Stonewall Jackson who was clearly fighting a war for Southerns to have the ""freedom"" to enslave African Americans. In either instance I felt the need to use the dvd for a frisbee. I would seem that the director and screenplay writer wanted to play towards some nostalgia for the Southern Confederacy which I found just as nauseating. Let us remember that the Civil War was an unfortunate event in American history but clearly the ""good"" guys won if there were truly good guys in such a conflict.

I felt, however, that this installment was inferior to its predecessor, Gettysburg.  The script, cast, and editing of Gettysburg were much tighter and finely honed than here.  The style of speech is not the problem in Gods & Generals, its the lenght and cheesy sentimentality; Chamberlain's speech quoting from Julius Caesar, for example, is over the top and unnecessary.  Yes, the treatment of slaves is a bit PC and soft but within the realm of reality.
While this film is about conflict and resolution, it is precisely this quality that falls short with respect to the people in the film: conflict and resolution between individuals and within individuals.  This was done so much better in Gettysburg.  Overall, I'd say that, buoyed by the success of Gettysburg, the director just tried too hard.

It seemed the movie was more about him than the Civil War and I was very disappointed with how little screen time Robert Duvall got portraying Robert E. Lee which he did a fantastic job of. If you knew nothing of American History, you would never know there was such a thing as slavery watching this film except where Stonewall ""interviews"" a black man to be his personal chef. After watching this black man have midnight talks with Stonewall under a starring night, sit in on battle plan meetings with other generals, and march with the cadets at VMI at his funeral one would of thought that racial equality had reached a pinnacle during the civil war. The southern blacks were even actively helping the confederates. If any one was portrayed as racist it was the union sgt calling them ""darkies"". Gettysburg on the other hand I came away knowing more about the Civil War than when I first started watching it. I was emotionally attached to both the characters from the North and the South expecially when Lee sent his troops across the battlefield and the knew they were going to be slaughtered but went any way.

1887456,1,B00009OOFB,"As a student of American History, especially the War for Southern Independence/Civil war, I was thoroughly bored and dismayed by this love letter to Major Gen. Thomas Jackson. Showing his imagined ""softer side"" was revisionist history in the highest. Jackson was a hard man, a religious mystic and fanatic, with Napoleonic ideas of battle that were debunked once and for all after his death by Lee's ill-advised frontal assault at Gettysburg known as ""Pickett's Charge."" Stephen Lang is an excellent actor, but Jeff Shaara's Jackson and the historical Jackson are two completely different animals. Jeff Daniels did a yeoman job, but his restricted role would have co-starred him in any other film: I see this as a concession to the Northern Contingent, as they were not remotely given equal time on screen.
I am so very glad I rented this instead of running out to buy it as planned. If the novel is anything like the film, I shall be certain to avoid it; Jeff Shaara is certainly not the author his late more famous and Pulitzer Prize winning relative was. I am sorry if our Southern Brethren wish to preach about ""The Cause,"" but it should be remembered that when they speak of their ""rights,"" they are largely talking about their PROPERTY rights, in that they saw Lincoln as an Abolitionist. Anyone doubting this should simply look up the archives of the Charleston Mercury, and they can be disabused of their illusions.
I count Lt. Gen. James Longstreet as a personal hero, I was more than disappointed at the one-sided, and often silly portrayal of the first years of the war. Let us only hope that the last episode (""The Last Full Measure"") does not follow the same treatment. I thought Ted Turner would do better than this.",1058313600,12,1730,4.789297658862877

The most notable asset of this movie is the masterful acting job done by Stephen Lang, who plays ""Stonewall"" Jackson. In an Oscar caliber performance (the Academy I hope will award Mr. Lang for his efforts), Lang gives us a great view of a very complex man.

In my opinion, there are few war films that surpass Gettysburg for epic storytelling and historical fidelity, and I expected the same from this movie.  That having been said, I must say that Gods and Generals lived up to my expectations in nearly every respect.  Granted, since this film covers from the beginning of the war until Chancellorsville (roughly two years), something has been lost in the storytelling, and in fact anyone who does not already know something of this time period will likely be lost in the fast pace in which the first part of this film moves.
This movie does an excellent job of depicting the battles of Bull Run, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville, and lives up to the reputation of its predecessor (Gettysburg) as far as action sequences go.  The cast does a great job (especially Robert Duvall), but it WAS disappointing to see some characters played by different actors (most notably Longstreet, Stewart, Armisted, Pickett, and Ellis Spear).  Still, the acting was great.
Civil War buffs should be right at home with this film, and will have little to clamor about in the way of historical accuracy.  4 hours may be a little to much to bear for the average movie-watcher, but those willing to invest that much time in the film will not be disappointed.

With that said, it was a bit disappointing. I've given it four stars, but that is largely a default I have awarded for the civic service this film does in teaching some of the history of the Civil War. With that said, I had two main disappointments:
1. The screenplay and direction sacrificed much of the rest of the story in order to focus on Stonewall Jackson. The book is a largely balanced work that seeks to make the attitudes and beliefs of the contemporary participants real to the reader by focusing on four soldiers, two on each side: Jackson and Lee for the South, and Hancock and Chamberlin for the North. All but Jackson are reduced to minor roles. This is wrong, not merely from an historic standpoint, but also from a cinematic one: Jackson, while an American icon, is just too weird for the audience to relate to and nearly 5 nonstop hours of his odd habits and religious fervor begins to wear on the audience.
2. The slavery issue. Frankly, this movie softsoaps the slavery issue to a point I consider embarassing. I am a conservative New Englander. I now live in the south. My ancestors fought, and several died, in this war. While the technical study of history does indeed point out that there were many social, economic, and political factors that contributed to this war, the ultimate cause was undoubtedly slavery. Remove any one of the other ingredients and the war would still have happened, remove slavery and the disagreements would have been minor and easily dealt with. Slavery was an atrocity. Period. It should be portrayed honestly for what it was: while it is certainly OK to show that Southerners were not monsters and that many treated their slaves quite well (and most treated their slaves with at least the forbearance of someone who understands the value of their perishable ""property"") it should never be portrayed in the one-sided way this movie depicts.
See this movie. Buy it. It is worth the effort and cost. But director and writer take note: you could have done better. I look forward to your next work.",1058227200,4,2188,4.656330749354005
1887464,3,B00009OOFB,"To a previous reviewer, I must set the record straight.  When it comes to the Civil War, slavery (in the territories) was for all practical purposes was the prinicpal cause of the War Between the States (or secession, which was an inevitable result of the volitale issue).  Nevertheless, this does not mean the South was necessarily in the wrong, contrary to the politically correct viewpoint endorsed today.  The Supreme Court decision in Dredd Scott v. Sandford (although posthumously denounced as immoral) was constitutionally correct.  In the Nullification Crisis of 1830-31 the North (namely Daniel Webster) had demanded the South look to the Supreme Court in constituional crises, but now that the Supreme Court sided with the South, the ""Black"" Republicans and Abraham Lincoln (admittedly a great man) simply ignored what Webster had called the ""supreme ruling body.""  Obviously the North displayed a conspicuous disregard for Supreme Court supremacy when their interests were crossed.  In the final analysis, both the North and South played the states' rights card for their own benefit.  Thus the South, outnumbered by a North whose views diametrically opposed their own (and theoretically facing perhaps a constitutional amendment in the future outlawing slavery if the Republicans succeeded in ignoring the Dredd Scott decision and admitting new free states for the territories), was left with no viable option but secession, and made a decision for which it would, as history tells us, pay dearly.  In the end the Civil War was firmly rooted in the struggle over slavery in the western territories, and anyone who says otherwise is either misinformed or does not possess a comprehensive and unbiased knowledge of American history.
  Nevertheless, it would be foolish to believe that I endorse slavery as morally justifiable.

1887470,3,B00009OOFB,"Having spent a few years in the reigon this movie was made I can tell you that the overall depiction of the genteel society is right on, albeit a bit dramatic.  I was dissapointed that several key historic battles were skipped, but especially Jacksons's wilderness campaign as he seemed to be one of the pivotal characters in the movie.  I did find some of the pontification on the part of some of the actors a bit preachy at times, but the long winded speaches were usually mitigated with very realistic depictions of the battles that were covered.  Among the most poignant moments was the meeting of the Irish brigades during the battle of Fredricksburgh.  I give credit to the director and the writers for avoiding the mistakes made in the first movie, there is little apology or examination of the socio-political reasoning behind a very dark time; and the depictions of characters are less charicatures and more true to what you'd expect of soldiers from both sides of the fence.
On the whole a good movie for the fan of history, and chances are that if you're a student of southern and confederate history you've gotten used to the long-winded speaches southern men and women are oft guilty of.  General Lee provides the most important lesson of the war; ""It is well that war is so horrible, else we should grow too fond of it.""",1057881600,2,1334,4.659574468085107

I was relieved when I was under the impression that it was ending, and I let out ""oh thank god"" as it faded to black.  As the word ""Intermission"" came on screen I swore quite loudly, that had only been near two hours, yet it felt far longer than the three hours and forty minutes this movie was supposed to be.  The movie is too drawn out, has for all practical purposes one battle scene, and focuses on people from the North for no reason when they seem to be making a point about the South during the period.  If they want to talk about the South, then focus solely on the South, if they want to focus on the North, then do that.  But both is a ticket to boredom and an incoherent plotline.  And that's just what Gods and Generals gives you.  Don't buy this film unless you like pain.",1057881600,7,865,4.174698795180723
1887472,5,B00009OOFB,"Gods and Generals is an excellent movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't fit the current demographic of target moviegoers (teenagers), and convinced Ted Turner to basically forget ever releasing the third part of the trilogy (The Last Full Measure). Also too bad is the fact that the supposed six hour cut might never be released, as I suspect some criticisms of the movie may be answered by this version.
Contrary to many people's opinion, this movie is not Southern propoganda. No Dixie propaganda piece would have Chamberlain's discussion about the war with his brother in it. It is just telling the story from the point of view of southerners. As this movie is the story of Stonewall Jackson, the Last Full Measure would likely be the story of Ulysses S. Grant, and would amazingly seem too biased to the North.
Despite this, I could have used a little more mention of why northerners joined the war. Showing men from Illinois and Massachusetts as well as Virginia going off to war would have been a nice addition to the movie. I suspect the six hour version has more Chamberlain and Hancock, which is why this version must be released.
Please buy this movie, and buy it as a gift for someone else. Despite being almost four hours long, it is a very smooth flowing time. Hopefully, Shaara and Maxwell will convince Turner to move forward with ""The Last Full Measure"". Good sales returns on the DVD of ""Gods and Generals"" will definitely help.",1057708800,74,1440,4.764
1887473,5,B00009OOFB,"As I have stated in previous reviews that I've written, I despise political correctness in every sense of the word. And when it comes to historical epic movies, I feel there is absolutely NO PLACE for political correctness. That being said, Gods and Generals is not only pretty much HISTORICALLY CORRECT but is totally engulfing to watch, from the southern 19th century language usage (including many original quotes from the period such as the last words spoken by General Jackson as he lay dying) to the way the characters interacted with each other to the war itself. The camera angles played a major role in the feel of this movie as well. The way the whole flick played out gave me the feeling that I was right there, in the company of the major players of that awful war.
It was nice, also, to see a Civil War movie that spoke of the reasoning behind the war itself - states rights. Now, no president in his right mind, whether it be Lincoln or, if by some twist of fate, Jefferson Davis, would have allowed any states to secede. As much as I understand why those states wanted to secede, as president, I would have done whatever I could to prevent that from happening. Was the way Lincoln handled it correct? Well, hindsight is 20/20 and that discussion has been played out for over 140 years. We know the route Lincoln did take - right or wrong - to keep the union as one, and this Gods and Generals shows how the beginning of this situation played out, at least from the southern point of view. A little more of the northern perspective would have been nice. Oh well, maybe in the extended DVD version.
Unfortunately, too many people take all of these Hollywood historical movies as fact, and, since that town is run by politically correct liberals who would rather change history to fit the way THEY feel it SHOULD have been, rather than the way it actually was, the majority of movie watchers usually do not get a good part of the truth. And that's a shame and a crime. Gods and Generals is the exception, which is a breath of fresh air. As Jeff Shaara, author of the original book this movie is based, stated in a recent interview (from the Gods and Generals magazine), ""Hollywood has a dismal record of portraying history. Historical films have one purpose - to make money - and it seems they have two means of realizing that. One, tell a story the studio thinks the audience wants to see, and thus tilt the story to whatever political correctness is in vogue. The second purpose is to allow one particular big time actor the chance to do 'cool things' on the screen. Though many of these films are entertaining, the one thing missing is any responsibility to give the audience the truth about the event being portrayed.""
Do not let the length scare you off. From beginning to end, I was held to my seat, greatly anticipating the next scene when I saw it at the show. Matter of fact, I saw it twice in one weekend - once with my wife and once with my two eldest sons - and I'm ready to see it again!
Gods and Generals, Gettysburg, and the third part to be released next year (whose name escapes me) should be required viewing for all history students in school history class. Historical viewing at its best.",1057536000,15,3220,4.477891156462585

The ""essential"" reading Fremont suggests is anti-Lincoln and pro-Southern apologias, and any historian worth his salt, when studying the record, will note the increaingly violent and intractable rhetoric on the Southern side concerning one issue following the Mexican-American War: slavery. Certainly the South was concerned about the increasing economic power of the North, but after the Nullification crisis was squashed by Andrew Jackson, such considerations were accepted as inevitable (if not positive).  The one Southerns thing feared above all else was the free black man, and even when white manpower was depleted in the last years of the war, even Lee couldn't convince the Confederate government to grant freedom to slaves who fought to preserve the institution.",1057363200,9,1067,5.5060975609756095

Everyone else will enjoy the film and come away with the sense that the war was very complex.

I loved Gettysburg and hoped that Gods and Generals would be as good. Unfortunately I was wrong. Gods and Generals is perhaps one of the least accurate Civil War movies that I have ever seen. This four hour long disappointment shows nothing but the revised Pro-South version of the Civil War. All of the battles shown are Southern victories. The South is portrayed as merely defending their homes and the Battle of Antietam (a Southern invasion of the North), the bloodiest single day in American Military History and the Union victory used to justify the Emancipation Proclamation, is left out of the movie as is the fact that Lee's Confederate Army kidnapped free blacks in the North and sold them into slavery during his invasion of the North). Also, all of the ""touching,"" ""emotional"" scenes focus on Southern families. No Northern mother is shown tearfully sending her sons of to fight. Finally, the book Gods and Generals is completely changed. Hancock's role in the book as a major character is shortened in the movie to a few lines. With the exception of Chamberlain, the entire movie is told from the point of view of the South. In lieu of any Northern point of view Ron Maxwell decided to add ridiculous characters like Jim Lewis (Jackson's cook) in laughable scenes where he and Jackson pray to end slavery.

1887477,5,B00009OOFB,"Without a doubt this is the most historically accurate Civil War movie ever made.
  Steve Lang did a fantastic Stonewall Jackson. Robert Duvall did a Great Robert E. Lee, and is a superb horseman.
Some people complained the movie talked too much about God, and faith. Well, that is what the most of the people did back then, and especially the Southern people, more so Jackson and Lee. ( there is NOT ONE CUSS WORD IN THE MOVIE!)
Some people complained the movie didn't show 'reality'! ( with blood, guts, etc.) Please use your imagination folks, the REALITY of the Civil War, does not really need to be splashed on the screen.
The other plus's--the authentic REAL Old South accent; and most of the lines read were quotes from REAL history.
If one reads histor; or is from the South, the relationship between the black slave, and her mistress, was just as described in the movie. ( which is a very loving and caring relationship)
[ Northern people always have a hard time realizing this. They don't understand black and white children grew up together, and played together on the plantation. Segeration occured in the North during the Civil war, in all most all areas)
FACT: Stonewall Jackson taught Sunday school for black Children, sent their school money during the war, and like Robert E. Lee, wished to see slavery abolished.
Was Jim ( Jackson's personal cook and aid,) --who was black-- a real character?
Answer: If you know where Jackson is buried, look over your shoulder, and you'll see Jim's grave.
Errors on the Movie:  1.)The Union TORE THE STRINGS OUT OF THE PIANO, and DESTROYED IT. ( though they MAY HAVE played it first)
2.) JEB Stuarts cloak, ( normally red lined--though he may have had one that wasn't)
3.) The Irish Brigade--Here is an interesting point.
The Southern Irish, fought for independence; the Northern Irish fought for Empire and SELF. ( Aggrandizement)
Example: CSA General ( Irish) Patrick Cleburne--""a man should bow down to no man but his creator""
US  General ( Irish) Thomas Meager--fought to make a name for himself, and become a strong political figure. ( which was his idea from the start)  Meager left the Union army under a cloud of distrust and other crimes were alleged to him)
This movie really states the war for what is was; Independence and leaving the Southern states to fight for what the REAL design of the founding fathers wanted.
  The North fought to create and EMPIRE. It shows the CREATION OF THE MONOLITHIC OUT OF CONTROL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, that we have today.
Further reference reading:
1.)""Cultures In Conflict"" by Charles E. Jennings ( Outstanding 113 page book, bluntly truthful. About the religious and cultural differences between the North and South, during the Civil War.--a MUST READ FOR SOUTHERN PEOPLE)

1887478,5,B00009OOFB,"I saw this movie at the Premiere in DC, and I was blown away by it.  The critics saw the flaws in the film, I saw them too, but it all worked together for me. I was impressed that someone actually pulled off making an epic, and the aesthetic beauty of the film, and the genuine warmth, heart, and soul it had, something many a movie lacks these days.
Quick rundown of flaws: Some of the history is un-researched (but what can you expect from Hollywood?), especially concerning the costumes. But, despite complaints, the dialogue is correct (yep, those speeches were how they talked. Just go to your local college's library and pull out a war-time newspaper chock full of ""going away speeches"". Oy),a nd it would have been a shame to revert to monosylables. The script is untidy, but one must keep in mind that this film was originally cut from a 6 hour version, still Maxwell could have done much better with the screenplay. The women in the film were rather awkward and unecessary, though, unlike many, I liked the feminine touch. Some scenes seem to come out of nowhere and lead into nothing, and the movie moves quickly, jumpng over huge portions of time. The movie doesn't follow the book closely at all, choosing to make this the ""Stonewall Jackson Movie"", which can be an ambiguous (either negative or positive) choice, depending on the viewer. Thus, a great many of the beloved characters and scenes from the book are out.
But on top of all it's flaws, the film has charisma and heart, and does work, at least for me, despite what many of it's critics think. It doesn't feel cliched; rather, it feels fresh. The battle scenes, though lacking in gore, are extremely well choreographed and awe-inspiring. The score is amazing, and there's one song, ""Going Home"" which plays at the beginning, which is downright Oscar worthy. Stephen Lang brings in a true tour-de-force theatrical performance (he was, after all nominated for a Tony Award for A Few Good Men), in the legacy of many a great character actor. Mr. Lang doesn't have the most startling resemblance of Ol' Stonewall, but his sheer presence convinces you that he is. Jeff Daniels and a plethora of supporting actors deserve kudos for fine performances as well.
The film doesn't lack in poignant moments and, in it's own way, drives home the horror of war in scenes too numerous to count. Unlike many war films these days, this film is quiet. It makes you think, makes you pay attention. In many ways it reminds me of classical plays performed for the stage, or even Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (though it shares the same thoughtful, intellectual pace and graceful, natural visuals, it moves much more swiftly than dear Barry does).
This is a different film, to be sure. Don't be turned off by counting it's flaws. It has a deep, profound undercurrent that makes up for those. It can alternately wring genuine tears from or inspire it's viewers, without the use of cheap cinematic manipulation; this is a slow cooked film. This is a fine film about our national tragedy, not the best, but certainly fine, respectful, thoughtful, sorrowful, and indeed, stirring.",1056672000,21,3127,4.769372693726937

I saw this movie in the theater on the first night it was released ""generally"" on 2/21/2003. I was looking forward to it, I so wanted this to be blockbuster. I was depressed and disappointed. It was just plain terribly done and dragged out. I can't believe the same Ron Maxwell who made the movie ""Gettysburg"" made this movie.
Here's the facts people.....
""Gods and Generals"" started playing at 1,500+ theaters when released on 2/21/2003 and was playing in only 81 theaters one month later. By 5/2/03 it was only in 16 theaters.
This movie cost $55 million to produce, and another app. $35-40 million on top of that to market it. ($90+ million total)
It's total cumulative gross over its entire run in the theaters never topped $13 million. It was a grangantuan box office LOSER.
Numbers like the above don't happen for NO GOOD REASON! People and theaters voted with their pocketbooks. Word of mouth and reviews. The movie stunk... and was poorly done. The only thing done worse was the awful ""Gods and Generals"" computer game they made to launch with the movie.
I think the big problem that Maxwell just plain tried to cover too much material in one movie... It's a shame because a good movie would have heightened interest in the Civil War, and I fear if this movie is anyone's preliminary contact on the war, they will lose any interest in wanting to learn more about the Civil War.
I heard the DVD was coming out and that's what brought me here. I see this upcoming DVD to be released 7/15/03 is the ""theatrical release"" and I keep hearing that a DVD with a couple of hours of cut footage was in the offing.

1887482,1,B00009OOFB,"I think the overwhelming number of 5 star reviews here are from those who place more emphasis on the re-enactors wearing the correct cap badges rather than good filmmaking.  Even with that the movie still has its failings.  While I find it fresh and interesting to have Jackson as the central character and Lang does a decent job acting, the character as presented is far less eccentric than the actual man was.  Either Shaara or Maxwell toned down his character because they feared the audience might not empathize with the historically accurate Jackson.  And, in addition, other attitudes and ideas presented by various characters have the smell of revisionism about them.  But other than these things, I have no major problems with the history.  It is accurate, although in a clumsy public school textbook sort of way.
Now judging it as a movie, it is atrocious.  In Gettysburg, the characters made long, Shakespearean speeches that, while a little stiff in delivery sometimes, stuck with you and helped to define the character and the moment.  In contrast, the speeches in G&G are interminable and forgettable.  Various historical quotes and tidbits (like the aurora borealis at Fredericksburg) seem to be pasted into scenes more out of obligation than artistry.  Now, maybe the problem is that the theatrical release wasn't long enough, since they definitely try to cover enough material for 3 movies.  Lengthening it could help, but I doubt it--it would probably just contain more pointless speeches or repetitive battle sequences.
The strength of Gettysburg was that it was a movie centered on just the Battle of Gettysburg and the story of the individual characters brought the history and the battlefield to life.  The weakness of G&G is that it is a movie that tries to cover so much the whole film loses focus and character.  Compounding this problem is that the characters and their meaningless dialogue do nothing to enhance the film except increase the amount of footage.
It's too bad, because I really looked forward to this movie.  Hopefully the last movie in the series will not be mistreated this way.",1056153600,15,2119,5.0

1887488,4,B00009OOFB,"Gods and Generals accurately shows the South winning the first few battles, but completely lets slip the importance of Manassas in the South's loss of the war.
It was fought in late July 1861 (known as the Battle of First Manassas in the South, the Battle of Bull Run in the North). The Federal army, under General Irvin McDowell, had amassed some 33,000 troops and attacked 22,000 Confederates thirty miles west of Washington, D.C. There was great optimism in Washington that the war would end on that day, July 16, 1861. Many Washingtonians rode out to Manassas Junction in their carriages with their packed lunches in hopes of watching the rebels surrender soon after the first shots were fired. General McDowell himself was confident that he could end the war then and there.
It didn't turn out that way, for the Battle of First Manassas was a resounding Confederate victory in the sense that it thoroughly convinced the Federal government that it was not going to be easy to defeat the secessionists. The battle ended with a wild scramble of Federal troops and civilians retreating back to Washington, D.C. The retreating army became a wild mob several miles long and a hundred yards wide as soldiers and civilians raced each other for whatever safety the Northern capital offered. It was here that ""Stonewall"" Jackson earned his nickname by fearlessly turning back a seemingly overpowering Federal force. After the battle he approached Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who had just arrived on the battlefield, and said, ""Give me ten thousand men and I will take Washington tomorrow."" Davis refused, and he would speak of his regret over that decision for the rest of his life, considering
it ""one of the great mistakes of the war.""
In a single day, Lincoln (and most of Washington) must have moved from a belief in the possibility of immediately putting an end to the ""rebellion"" to a fear that the capital city (and Lincoln himself) could be captured by the Confederate army of General P G. T. Beauregard and forced to sign a peace agreement.
None of this was evident in Gods and Generals.",1055721600,,2102,4.874301675977653
1887489,1,B00009OOFB,"""Gods and Generals"" is targeted directly at the CWBs out there, a.k.a. the Civil War Buffs. It is so painstakingly boring and dull that only the fanatics could care about it. It is as if any interest in the film is tossed aside, just so the small amount of true CWBs out there can enjoy it, and nudge each other when their favorite historical figure comes on screen. Which, by the way, is easy to note, as every time anyone comes on screen--or any location comes on screen--white subtitles appear at the bottom of the frame, telling us who or what we are looking at, in such a fashion that only the true illiterates in the audience would have a hard time following who's who and what's what.
""Gods and Generals"" is notable for being a prequel to the 1993 hit ""Gettysburg."" I've not seen ""Gettysburg"" yet, and after seeing ""Gods and Generals,"" I'm not so sure I want to. Unless ""Gettysburg"" is an entirely different breed of film, it will be boring, dull, unmoving, and 100 % cheesy.
In ""Gods and Generals,"" every line muttered by a character is some grand, psychological metaphor. Sometimes the quotes are true, such as when Robert E. Lee found out that General ""Stonewall"" Jackson had lost his left arm. ""He has lost his left arm, and I have lost my right."" But when Lee (Robert Duvall) says it in this film, it seems forced. Everything they say seems forced. As if they are reading off a cardboard slate off-screen. And every scene is at least ten minutes long, even the most non-important snore-fest scenes. In one scene, Jackson lies in bed with his wife and expresses his wishes to have a child. Well, he could easily say it and they could end the scene in two minutes flat. But by sticking to what I will call the ""Every Line Must Be Memorable and Be a Metaphor"" pact, which no doubt was formed before the film went into production, Jackson mutters on in fancy style for TEN minutes (yes, I checked my watch) about his desire to have a child. There are only so many words that can express the feeling of wanting a child. Jackson uses them all, and after that, uses a few more. No wonder it took so long for him to have a child - after that long speech, all his wives probably died of boredom.
""Gods and Generals"" has good potential to be a sweeping epic, but it tries to hard to live up to something it can never be. Every scene is at least ten minutes. Ten minutes short for history buffs, and ten minutes long for a regular audience. Every line is smart yet forced. And as every minute went by, another person in the screening room left. I wish I had.
Just for the record, in the course of exactly 3 hr. 40 minutes running time, the screening I participated in went from about twenty viewers to eight.

Roger Ebert began his critique with ""Now here's a film Trent Lott would like"" proving he is more qualified to perform in an exercise video than understand and review this movie.

I appricate the book ""The Killer Angels"" and I think that ""Gettysburg"" was also a great movie. All the books written by the Sharras are very well done and the movies capture the important themes of theses great American novels.

1887504,5,B00009OOFB,"This is one earth-shattering film.  Unlike others in the last 30 years of dealing with the subject of the War for Southern Independence, this one treats the subject evenly, and is extremely historically accurate.  Characters like ""Stonewall"" Jackson, his wife, and Jim are complex, passionate human beings, not just historical figures pasted on the screen.  The Calvinistic faith that guided Jackson's every breath is REAL, not just given lip service.  There is no PC view of history here.  Jackson and Lee were both Christian men who believe slavery was not for the betterment of man, and wished to see it ended.  This is told, as are the war crimes committed by Union forces invading the South.  What will be lost on all but  the most astute historians is the parallel between Lincoln and Caesar.  Both men ended the Republics that established their countries, a soft point only the better historians will know.  The film also shows clearly that racism was not limited, by any means, to the areas south of the Mason-Dixon.
As a film, it is simply incredible.  Stephen Lang gives an absolutely wonderful performance, rivaling that of George C. Scott as Patton so many years ago.  He should win the Oscar for best actor hands down, but in ultra-liberal Hollywood, it'll never happen.  Jeff Daniels is also very good, as is Robert Duvall, who looks amazingly like Lee.
To some, the battle scenes may seem somewhat drawn out, but I don't feel that way at all.  The wonderful thing about these scenes is that it becomes clear how truly horrible war is, without the excessive bloodiness of moves like ""Saving Private Ryan"".
The music is absolutley wonderful.  The haunting opening song alone will bring tears to your eyes.

1887506,2,B00009OOFB,"""Gods And Generals"" is a very good movie in only one respect- the battle scenes were very well done. However, it would have been a much better film if Ted Turner had just stuck to history and laid off the ""damn yankees"" attitude reminiscent of ""Gone With The Wind"". Previously, in ""Gettysburg"", Turner was able to temper his pro-southern passion with fairness to both the North and South, and it was very balanced in that regard. But in ""Gods And Generals"", Turner came out with all guns blasting and turned what should have been a great film into a lot of Yankee bashing. History is history and nothing can change it, but Turner must realize that the South was fighting to preserve slavery and that was nothing to glorify. My own southern ancestors owned slaves but that didn't make it right.
 The authenticity in the uniforms and battle scenes was rather impressive but I wish more time was spent on the Battle of Chancellorsville. But instead of battle scenes, the death of Stonewall Jackson was the main focus and his death was portrayed as that of a saint. Jackson was a brilliant general but was not a saint. The scene made me sick.
 Also, the film focused on three Southern victories, the Battles of First Bull Run, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. Conveniently left out was the Union victory at Antietam, which should have been shown between Bull Run and Fredericksburg. So much for balance and fairness.
 Cut out the ... and watch the battle scenes and you have a good film. But come on Mr. Turner. Stick to the business world and lay off the movie production business.",1055116800,8,1582,4.703971119133574
1887507,4,B00009OOFB,"Gods and Generals is arguably the first major film to treat our Civil War in both depth and breadth and not veer into political correctness. As reviewer Lynn Hopewell aptly describes, those participating had a broad variety of convictions and motives. Previous fictional (e.g., Glory) and documentary (e.g., Ken Burns' The Civil War) treatments hew to the tired old line that slavery was either the only cause for the War or the only one of consequence (it certainly became the major Northern motive later).
This war's cause was no more about slavery than WW II was about saving the Jews from the Holocaust or the recent Iraq war was about weapons of mass destruction. Current events are instructive in the way leaders often seek to recast events and decisions in their best light and distance themselves from unsupportable things they said prior to a conflict.
If the film had even briefly covered the decades leading up to the Rebellion (as it was known in those times) it could have more clearly revealed how both sides were manipulated into the conflict by their extreme elements:
- rich Northern businessmen sought to protect their uncompetitive manufacturing from European imports with heavy tariffs which fell disproportionately on the South.
- Republican leaders focused on wiping out states rights and strengthening the Federal government in order to build an American empire and reward their wealthy constituents through massive political patronage
- Northern abolitionists (a minority within the Republican Party), and
- wealthy Southern plantation owners fearing future restrictions on the future of slavery.

1887508,4,B00009OOFB,"For anyone who is a follower of the trilogy, it is obvious that the film has some faults. When comparing The Killer Angels and its theatrical version, Gettysburg, the movie is essentially based on the novel alone. This is not true for Gods and Generals. Vital parts of the book are omitted or significantly changed in the movie. Also, the movie wastes time by focusing on several things that aren't in the novel, such as the family in Fredericksburg and the punishment of the deserters. The movie could have been so much better had those extras been left out and if the novel had been followed more thoroughly. Doing so wouldn't have affected the length that much. Besides, Maxwell and the others must remember that their first priority is following the book, not trying to make a Hollywood thriller. I thought that the devotion to details that existed while making Gettysburg was supposed to still be there. I hope that this is rectified in The Last Full Measure. On the positive note, the battle sequences are even better than in Gettysburg.

That said- this is an excellent movie.  I took my 11 year old son to it, and he was enthralled.  Stephen Lang as Jackson is one of the best examples of perfect casting I've seen in years.  Duvall as Lee really was much better than Sheen as Lee in ""Gettysburg""
In short- see this.  Maybe you don't sit down and watch it all at once, maybe you wait for a day that you're home sick from work- BUT SEE THIS MOVIE!

1887510,5,B00009OOFB,"...The fact is that ""Gods and Generals"", which covers the first two years of the war and is the prequel to ""Gettysburg"", is a great movie. It is painstakingly accurate, wonderfully filmed and scripted, and the acting was suburb. Stephen Lang deserves an Oscar for his brilliant portrayal of Gen. ""Stonewall"" Jackson. Robert Duvall is also excellent as Gen. Robert E. Lee. Jeff Daniels, who played Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain in ""Gettysburg"", reprises his role in G&G, as do other actors from ""Gettysburg"".
If you're expecting something like ""Saving Private Ryan"", you'll be disappointed. It's not that kind of a movie. ""Gods and Generals"" is part documentary, part drama, with the right mix of both to make it both highly entertaining and historically intriguing. As you listen to the characters, you almost believe that they're from the period and places in which the story is set.
What stuck in the craw of the critics is that this movie didn't present the Confederates as fire-breathing, racist, slavery-defending apes, and the Federals as saintly freedom-fighters. It would be simplistic and wrong to characterize the war as a struggle between good and evil. The vast majority of the Confederate soldiers didn't own slaves and didn't fight for the right to keep slaves. A lot of the Union soldiers, probably most, weren't fighting to free the slaves. There were flawed men on both sides of the war, as well as deeply moral men.
You can debate all you want about how much slavery was an issue in the Civil War, but as to this movie, all points of view were well represented through the characters: Lt. Col. Chamberlain of the 20th Maine, a professor-turned-soldier who was sympathetic to the plight of the black slaves; Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, a man of outstanding military service in the Federal army prior to the Civil War and a most beloved commander, who chose to defend his home state of Virginia against what he saw as an unlawful invasion by the North; Gen. Stonewall Jackson, a fearless and deeply religious man, devoted husband and a brilliant military tactician who loved the Union, but was fiercely loyal to Virginia; Martha, the house slave, who bravely turns away looting Union soldiers from her masters' home during the seige in Fredericksburg, but later takes in the Union's wounded, and who yearns to be free; Jim Lewis, Gen. Jackson's black cook, who prays that one day all of this family will be free. Unforgettable characters, all of them.
If you are uncomfortable with religious overtones and poetic dialogue (sorry, but that's how people were back the), don't buy this DVD. If you don't care at all about American history, skip this one. If you can't watch any historical movie without the filter of 21st century values or political correctness, this movie isn't for you. If you have a short attention span, forget it. This movie clocks in at about 3:37.
If you are interested in the Civil War, or just curious and want to learn about it, if you're tired of all the [stuff] coming out of Hollywood these days, and you're willing to let a movie make you think for a change, if you can put your 21st century frame of mind on hold, I think you'll enjoy this DVD.

1887521,5,B00009OOFB,"Just as he did in Gettysburg, director Ron Maxwell avoids drawn-out fight scenes and distracting special effects, choosing instead to delve into the complexity of the characters. His vision, along with the Stephen Lang's superb portrayal of Gen. ""Stonewall"" Jackson, brings to life one of the most elusive and enigmatic figures of American history. A sheer joy to watch from beginning to end, this masterpiece will surely go down as one of the greatest historical films of all time.",1054857600,,482,5.113924050632911
1887522,5,B00009OOFB,"The Civil War movie Gods and Generals is a prequel to the movie Gettysburg. Gods and Generals covers much more than a single battle-the two years from the beginning of the War to Gettysburg. Ron Maxwell wrote, produced and directed both films.
Movies about the War have been regularly produced for one hundred years, as is appropriate for a cataclysmic event that is still reverberating though our culture. The most successful was a four-hour epic, Gone with the Wind (GWTW).
GWTW is a romantic monument to the Old South -homage to a vanquished culture, told though the eyes of the O'Hara family. The opening title tells the story: ""There was a land of Cavaliers and Cotton Fields called the Old South. Here in this pretty world, Gallantry took its last bow. Here was the last ever to be seen of Knights and their Ladies Fair, of Master and of Slave. Look for it only in books, for it is no more than a dream remembered, a Civilization gone with the wind.""
Wildly popular, GWTW is the most successful film ever. But, it has been sixty-four years since GWTW was released in 1939, and the times have changed-boy, have they changed.
Maxwell has tried to combine entertainment with historical accuracy and a balanced treatment of North and South. He does not impugn the motives of either side. He presents the characters as they saw themselves and not as the Politically Correct (PC) crowd sees them today.
This means that Robert E. Lee, with dignity and honor, rejects command of the army raised to attack his native state and home. The Virginia legislature gives command of its army to Lee, not to preserve slavery, but because the state was being invaded, something Virginia would ""never do to other states."" It means that Colonel Joshua Chamberlain admits that the War was not started to end slavery and believed the Union should be preserved, even if by force.
Although quick to condemn slavery, reviewers exhibited collective amnesia about the Union army's depredations against civilians revealed in the Fredericksburg battle scenes-acts that would be punished as war crimes now under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
Most notably, the movie reveals Stonewall Jackson as a complex and admirable person; a lover of the union, a man who started a Sunday school for Negroes, and a dedicated family man. It also shows him as the superb warrior he was who was determined to defend his homeland. Because Southern military successes dominated the war during the period of this film, Jackson is the central character and is presented non-judgmentally and honestly; and for this, the PC press cannot forgive Maxwell, calling the film an ""apologia.""
Many critics disliked the movie for its success in delivering Maxwell's objective: the truth. They can't stand the truth that many blacks had conflicting loyalties; wanting to be free, but having bonds of affection to the white families they served.
A family servant says goodbye with unfeigned love for the two sons of her mistress that she helped raise and who are marching off to war. Jackson's cook, Jim Lewis, a free black, serves with Jackson to ""help defend his country."" Political Correctness (PC) is the dominant ethic of most of the movie critics.
They simply will not allow for the expression of a cordial relationship between slave and master.  More importantly, they do not realize that their view is in itself racist and denigrating. It denies to the slaves their own humanity, and the prospect of rising above their involuntary servitude to have meaningful lives and relationships.
The critics bridle at the presentation of Confederate motives for fighting as anything other than the desire to maintain slavery. One reviewer was livid at Jackson's condemnation of the commercial war motives of the North.
The movie reveals the embarrassing fact that most Union soldiers wanted nothing to do with blacks and were outraged when Lincoln said that emancipation would become a war aim. Desertions increased dramatically and the New York Draft Riots ensued.
As with any film, Gods and Generals is not perfect. The music, while adequate, does not have the majesty of Gettysburg. The characters explain themselves by extended dialogue. Thus, the film is a series of historical vignettes. It is a learning experience delivered with great care, faithfulness and honesty.
The only legitimate claim of the critics is that the entertainment objective of the movie was sometimes sacrificed to Maxwell's desire to tell the complete story. Perhaps, in trying to cover the entire story, he told a few too many stories.
But, every American should see this movie, because it provides a needed antidote to the ""big lie,""-one-dimensional portrayals of Southerners as evil people with no humanity and the invading Yankees as virtuous warriors slaying the dragon of slavery. It accurately shows the struggle both sides had with defining patriotism and duty.
It is not surprising that most reviewers were bored. Most are immersed in the glittering entertainment-celebrity culture, focusing on the star of the moment. They find history too slow, too boring. In addition, most have been taught the current revisionist history that makes students ashamed of their past and have little hope for the future. They think we are much superior to our ancestors. Their attitude is self-righteous and ungrateful. Gods and Generals contradict those ideas and the reviewers squirm.
So, if you simply want to be excited, and not think too much, or take too much time, and have no curiosity about your heritage, go see Ben Affleck in Daredevil. If you want to learn about your country's history, told truthfully, free of conformist PC genuflections; watch the three hours and forty minutes Gods and Generals. Don't trust the critics.

The acting is great, Stephen Lang's portrayal of Stonewall Jackson is magnificient, and this movie portrays the many viewpoints and causes of the civil war.

Granted this is a long movie filled with historical detail and dialogue quite similar to that of countless letters filling the attics of Civil War descendants.  Instead of acknowledging this to viewers, it seems that some in the movie reviewing community prefer to simply mock this movie as ""epic-length"" and filled with ""silly dialogue"".  While I am hesitant to be so blunt, I'm afraid that some of this criticism comes simply from either the inability to recognize such historical accuracy or simply a short attention span.  This is NOT a movie for the person wanting to view yet another example of Hollywood's ""movie-in-a-box"" formula that countless ""blockbusters"" seem to follow these days.  You will not see a man and woman argue, somehow fall in love, find their love challenged in some way, and then discover a quick resolution.  No, the only formula here is one that carefully studied a broad sample of both Northern and Southern lives and compiled them into a story that follows Jeff Shaara's novel somewhat, though not completely.  I found it refreshing, not offensive, to see religion used in a movie in a non-derogatory way.  It is a simple fact that Thomas Stonewall Jackson was an incredibly devout man-- a fact substantiated in many letters.  To ponder his convictions against his brutal demeanor on the battlefield in fascinating.  Stephen Lang in this role is simply amazing.  He personifies Jackson.  I also find the sanctimonious criticism of how slavery is handled in the movie quite ironic.  Gone With the Wind's most memorable characters are slaves who are ""part of the family"", so to speak, who struggle with both fear and excitement at the notion of freedom.  Because Gods and Generals portrays two different slaves who show affection to the families of their owners, the movie is called ""racist"".  What is ignored are the direct statements these slaves make expressing their desire to have the same freedom for their own families that they are witnessing in their owners' families.  It required little critical thinking on my part to see the character development that some of the reviewers failed to see.  I think that our culture has become so quick to point out racial oppression that those with shorter attention spans are unable to follow a less-than-mainstream movie's journey to a quite satisfying conclusion.  So yes, if you're looking to pass a Sunday afternoon by watching the latest Hollywood mindless formula, you probably won't want to purchase Gods and Generals.  If you desire to make a truly positive, mind provoking (not mind-insulting) addition to your movie collection, especially a war collection, Gods and Generals is a must.",1054684800,4,2779,5.081497797356828
1887526,5,B00009OOFB,"Perhaps The Best Civil War Film Ever Made

""Gods and Generals"" should be on the ""must-see"" list of all fans of great movie-making. This historical epic is the second installment in what well could be director Ron Maxwell's supreme life's work -- bringing Jeff and Michael Sharra's novel trilogy of the American Civil War to dramatic and unforgettable life.
It is perhaps the best film ever made about that conflict. This film is worth every minute.
Joshua Chamberlain is portrayed by Jeff Daniels (who played the same role in ""Gettysburg"" and returned for this prequel). He is drawn as a noble northern officer whose reflections on the Emancipation Proclamation (in the new film) reflect accurately a steady shift in the war's stated purpose -- away from preservation of the union into a crusade against the ancient institution of human slavery. The two films contain enough hints about Chamberlain's character and certainty of purpose that his remarkable post-war career (as an educator at Bowdoin College and one of the most successful politicians in Maine's history) is understandable.
The new film gives a balanced and faithful (to the novel and to history) treatment of Thomas Jackson (portrayed by Stephen Lang), the professor at Virginia Military Institute who, as Robert E. Lee's strategist, worked his way onto the lists of the world's greatest commanders. (Lee is portrayed subtly by Robert Duvall.) Again and again, in 1861 and 1862, this man of absolute faith and confidence led the heavily-outnumbered Confederate Army of Virginia to victories over the Union. The North simply had no one to match wits with Jackson, who earned the nickname ""Stonewall"" for leading his brigade's heroic stand in the first Battle of Bull Run.
Maxwell's framing and use of characters are beautiful. Many things about ""Gods and Generals"" are distinctive. Perhaps the most notable is the explicit portrayal of the touchstone of Christian faith that illuminated the lives of warriors and observers on both sides of the conflict. Women play a much larger role in this film than in ""Gettysburg."" Mira Sorvino's portrayal as Chamberlain's wife is luminescent. Jackson's wife, Anna, is played with sensual emotion and believability by Kali Rocha. The love and fidelity of both couples is central to the story of this film. The desire and care at the heart of each relationship seems so authentic, so faithfully rendered, that it becomes, in the viewing, remarkable and mysterious. The passionate bonds of marital love portrayed here are an extension of the love the characters themselves feel for God.
Similarly, excellent black performers appear in notable supporting roles in this film (that was not the case in the middle segment of the anticipated trilogy). Particularly notable is Frankie Faison's rendering of Jackson's servant and cook, Jim Lewis, who conveys the awkwardness and complexity of that era's black-white relations in even the most cordial circumstances. In another scene, as a young soldier lies dying in a home shattered after the Siege of Fredericksburg, Martha, a slave portrayed by Donzaleigh Abernathy, tearfully discusses the war's course and purpose with a heart-broken General Winfield Scott Hancock, portrayed (as in ""Gettysburg"") by Brian Mallon. These utterly believable moments further humanize this most human of conflicts.
Jackson's victory at Chancellorsville is rendered with integrity. Maxwell conveys memorably the heroic long march of Jackson's soldiers before a bold attack. He captures the utter surprise of Union forces -- and the late, desperate stands that prevent complete collapse of the North's cause. This, rather than the South's victory under favorable conditions at Fredericksburg, is probably the emotional high point of the film -- as was the collapse of Pickett's charge in ""Gettysburg"" (where a different-looking Lang gave a sympathetic reading to the unfortunate division commander). The depiction of Jackson's demise is unforgettable -- including Lang's delivery of some of the most memorable last words in human history.
""Gods and Generals"" is an authentic retelling of key moments in the first two years of the Civil War. It can help today's audience understand why honorable men who worshipped the same Creator and who lived on the same continent could come to such a horrible and bloody crossroads of division.",1054598400,2,4357,5.296242774566474

Think about it...600,000 Southerners fought; 11,000 of them plus or minus were actual slaveholders. Regardless of your stance on slavery, do you really think 589,000 people would want to die for the wealthiest 11,000??? Sure, it was about slavery, but it was state's rights too.

In these regards, Gods and Generals was a wonderful movie experience.
Gods and Generals primarily portrays the way the Virginians saw the conflict and why they fought so hard and long, in a way that prolonged the war and led to awful losses of life and limb. Without Lee and Jackson (and all the Virginians who loyally fought for them) the Confederacy arguably would not have lasted a fraction as long and the war would have been far less bloody. This movie reminds that the Confederacy easily could have been denied Virginia's participation and that Lee -- and perhaps Jackson -- could have fought for the Union. Gods and Generals suggests miscalculations on Lincoln's part that raised the spectre of invasion and changed Virginia's vote against secession to a new tally in favor.
Exploring timeless themes of a people's mystical ties to land and culture and abhorrence of any semblance of invasion, Gods and Generals provides an empathy for the fierce-fighting Virginians, if not full respect. Because the movie covers the first half of the war in the East, it is one of the few Civil War movies that could be made in which the South is actually victorious.  Nonetheless, for all its focus on the Confederate Virginians, the moral center of the movie clearly lies in the characters of Maine's professor-soldier Joshua Chamberlain and a Fredericksburg, Virginia slave who deliver the same judgment: For all their passionate defense of their own liberty, the white Virginians were mostly blind to the same innate desire for liberty among the enslaved black Virginians who in many ways shared a similar love for the land and even the culture.
Viewers of the DVD will have a much better experience than those who saw Gods and Generals in the theatres because they will be able to stop, rewind and to view again and again.  I saw the movie three times and found that during each viewing rich new insights were revealed.

1887530,5,B00009OOFB,"Stephen Lang was magnificent as Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson! The emotion and kindness of the man as well as the steely nerves of the general are so well expressed. The viewer is with both sides of the conflict. Is either side right? Is either side wrong? The viewer feels the reasoning and emotions of both North and South, union and secession. Thank you Ron Maxwell for your writing and direction, and thank you Ted Turner for your financial support. Seeing Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee is extra special as he is related to Lee on his mother's side and looks so much like Lee in the film. The continuity of using many the same actors in the same roles they played in ""Gettysburg"" (such as Jeff Daniels, C. Thomas Howell, Patrick Stuart, and Brian Mallon) in key roles in ""Gods and Generals,"" however, is much appreciated, as well. But thank goodness that Stephen Lang plays Jackson rather than reprises Pickett in ""Gods and Generals""! Jackson is a relative of mine and the heart and soul that Lang poured into the role is amazing and very much appreciated. History buffs should appreciate the hard work and painstaking details that went into producing the film. Yes, there will be nitpickers, but it wasn't their money or their writing or their producing that went into creating this work. I hope that those who are not familiar with the the characters and the battles depicted in ""Gods and Generals"" will want to learn more and see the film again and again. You will see something new and learn something new with each viewing. This film should be treasured both as a teaching tool as well as good cinema.",1054598400,6,1608,4.665492957746479

I actually like it, because it is not Hollywood and not slick and polished, but more like about how things really were in the war.  Acting of Stonewall Jackson was excellently done and well portrayed in the movie.  The level of detail was tremendous, but if you just want a regular fast paced, low detail, low frills movie, then you will hate it...I have watched movies less than half this length and been bored stiff.  This is a very complete movie with truth that makes its mark and wish more historical dramas/war movies had this detail, because sometimes it is so hard to beleive what really happened in the past unless you see and understand the smallest details.",1054512000,92,726,4.561538461538461

1887533,4,B00009OOFB,"This is much better than the theatrical release. Amazon should have created an entirely different set of reviews for the Director's Cut instead of lumping all the reviews into one.
The scenes that have been added are all good for the most part. Virtually none of the deleted scenes that you can view on the movie soundtrack were included - and that's a good thing - they were pretty lousy.

A scant few other scenes have been shortened or deleted altogether from the original. They would have been wise to do more of that. To be specific, the conversation between Jackson and Jim Lewis in front of the Chancellor house was cringe-inducing. If the director felt he HAD to include Jackson's views on slavery, he easily could have made his point in about 20 seconds rather than 3 minutes. The rather dry scene between Joshua and Fanny should have been shortened as well.
Although the portrayal of Ambrose Burnside was not what I expected, the inclusion of scenes with McClellan added to the film.

There are still a few nagging issues with this film, which brings it down a notch or two. I don't think the director gave much freedom to Robert Duvall's ""Lee,"" which may have caused his less than exemplary performance. A more powerful soundtrack would have helped as well.
But overall, I think it's a good film to add to my library.

To my disappointment I was aghast at this long, tedious, boring film with one of the worst scripts in decades. I have to admit that I left the theater during the intermission; I could not continue to watch this film.
The battles are full of redundant scenes filmed with the camera almost in the same spot shooting the death of soldiers one skirmish line after another as they boldly march towards the low wall.
And, probably one of the most embarrassing scenes ever filmed by a good actor is Jeff Daniels incredibly lengthy, dreary and overacted monologue to his men as they wait to enter the battle.
The problem with the script, that absolutely ruined this film is that the lines given to the actors to read are actually from the letters written by the real characters. These letters were written in a flowerily prose of the times -- people just didn't speak that way then nor now.
I love epic films, but this is one epic about nothing -- don't waste your time or dollars on this DVD.",1054512000,11,1084,4.535714285714286
1887535,4,B00009OOFB,Ron Maxwell has offered up his finest work so far with an outstanding cast and an unbeatable story of one of the finest generals on either side of the War Between the States.  Bring your hankie and prepare to be transported to a different time. The spoken word was different and so were the men who fought so bravely for such different causes.  Thomas Jackson's portrayal by Stephen Lang is nothing less than magnificent and Robert Duvall breathes life into the character of Robert E. Lee in direct contrast to the bumbling fool Martin Sheen would have us watch in Gettysburg.  It's long...and so what?,1054425600,2,602,4.714285714285714
1887536,4,B00009OOFB,"""Gods and Generals"" could have used some tighter editing, just as many of the professional and online reviewers say. But some of their more hostile comments tell more about the reviewers than about the picture. World magazine writer Gene Edward Veith gigged them nicely with this mock content advisory:
""Warning! This movie contains explicit Bible reading. Scenes contain graphic depictions of prayer. The language may not be suitable for viewers offended by nonprofane references to Jesus. Viewers are strongly cautioned due to intense moralizing, violently affectionate marriages, and gratuitous displays of selfless behavior.""
It's hard to portray piety well on-screen, and Hollywood these days scarcely ever tries to do so. But Stephen Lang pulls it off. His Jackson is stern, warm, charismatic and convincing. I had long imagined a film about Stonewall, and this is almost all I could have desired.
I had envisioned Ed Harris in the role, as he bears a strong resemblance to Jackson, but I don't think Harris could have outdone Lang or even equalled him. If you doubt Lang's acting chops, just watch him play Pickett in ""Gettysburg."" What a contrast to Lang's Jackson! Each portrayal has a life of its own. Lang's performance outdoes even the great Robert Duvall, who here and there lets the hint of a ""Lonesome Dove"" mannerism slip into his portrayal of Lee.
""Gods and Generals"" is especially welcome in that it contains none of the puerile nonsense that spoiled the recent would-be epics ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""The Patriot."" Plodding it may be, but it should at least get credit for its maturity.
Here's what I missed in ""Gods and Generals"" and hope to see in the 6-hour DVD when it is released next year:
* Some sense of how Jackson and Lee earned their immense reputations, in the Valley campaign and at Second Manassas.
* Some more attention to the Federal commanders, who were the tragicomic foils for Lee's and Jackson's brilliance. In the movie, that parade of bunglers and blowhards is represented only by Burnside. I understand the eventual 6-hour version will include Antietam, so we may meet McClellan there, but I want to see Pope and Hooker huff, puff and fall on their faces, too.
* Speaking of bunglers and blowhards, a hard look at the secessionist firebrands who brought the war on might have mollified those critics who found the Southern cause way too idealized in this picture. Especially on the issue of slavery and race, a contrast could have been drawn between Jackson and someone like Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, who prattled about the ""great moral truth"" of white superiority. The South's bigotry resided in its politicians, not in men like Jackson. (One critic doubted that Jackson would ever have called the free black cook he hired ""Mr. Lewis,"" as he does in the movie. But ""Tom Fool"" Jackson was known in pre-war Lexington for tipping his hat to black men on the street. Said he: ""I could not be less polite to a Negro than he is to me."")
I look forward eagerly to seeing the conclusion of Mr. Maxwell's Civil War trilogy. In the role of U.S. Grant, the Union general who finally took Lee's measure, I'd suggest Russell Crowe. Like Grant, Crowe looks a bit surly, ""as if he had determined to drive his forehead through a brick wall and was about to do it.""
And if Crowe isn't available, just call on Lang again. Embodying Jackson, Pickett AND Grant --- now, THAT would be an acting trifecta!",1054425600,4,3442,4.8654173764906306

1887539,5,B00009OOFB,"I saw this film during the few hours it was in the theaters.  Gods and Generals has a profound emotional impact if you are willing to let it in.  The massive sacrifice made by both sides is made very clear.  If you dislike religion and are so thin-skinned that you can't let that go in favor of a realistic portrayal of the times then this film is sure to rub you the wrong way.  Technically, the film had highs and lows, but overall we were treated to some amazing views of our history.  However, the cannons used in the Civil War did not gently recoil 1 to 2 feet as shown, and, when firing grapeshot at 100 yards, the result was a huge swath of bloody destruction, not just a few men falling over. On the minus side, it is true that the film depicted a remarkably genteel relationship between slaves and their owners, but perhaps something of a contrarian view on this subject is not such a bad thing.  I think we all understand now that slavery was a great evil.  This movie is not going to reverse that understanding.  Also, let's not forget that the overwhelming majority of the South's soldiers were there to defend the homeland, not to specifically uphold slavery (Of course, the result was the same, and we will have to let God sort out their responsibility). I personally thank Ted Turner for this fine film with its unique perspective, and I hope that its poor reception by the critics will not deter him from completing the trilogy.",1054425600,3,1444,4.4638783269961975

I have visited battlefields in numerous states...I have read countless history books on the subject...I will this year be visiting Gettysburg, PA on my vacation for the 5th time. When Gettysburg the film came out I couldn't wait to see it, simply because there are not enough films made about the Civil War.  I commend Ted Turner for his devotion to the subject.  BUT, this film like Gettysburg lacks the flow from scene to scene...the battle scene's are also cut up or never finished. The endless speeches that Ron Maxwell seem's to think all characters need to have makes me want to nod off....they never make you care about the character.  The most interesting person in God's and General's is Stonewall Jackson...this is for two reason's.  One, because finally someone brought him to the screen and second, because Stephen Lang portrayed him.  He does a wonderful job.  I own Gettysburg the movie, and I will also own God's and General's when it comes out...not because they are a great piece of filmmaking but because it's the characters you want to know and see come alive.",1054252800,4,1131,4.739795918367347
1887542,2,B00009OOFB,"I have read Jeff Shaara's book twice, and thoroughly enjoy his writing.  I have seen ""Gettysburg"" often, and think Ron Maxwell's direction is masterful. I have been to countless Civil War battlefields, and have three degrees in history.  All of this adds up to why I was very disappointed in ""Gods and Generals.""
Mr. Maxwell was so consumed with making an accurate protrayal of events in the earlier part of the Civil War that he forgot that he was directing a film.  And that is why the drama of this conflict is so sadly lacking.  I honestly believe that the director believed the hype of Civil War buffs (and I am one of them) when they idolized ""Gettysburg.""
Continuity is lacking.  Some of the incredible drama surrounding the First Bull Run is missing.  Northern civilians really believed that this would be a very short war, so short that they could have a picnic while this battle ensued.  This is missing.
The brilliance of Stonewall Jackson's end around maneuver at Chancellorsville is muddled. A few maps of explanation would have helped.  Instead, we have a bunch of soldiers running without any understanding of what was occurring.  Luckily I know the battle, so I knew what was happening.  My wife had no idea, nor did many people around us.
The major characters that Jeff Shaara flushed out in his excellent historical drama are given short shrift.  Little is seen of Hancock.  Most is devoted to Jackson, yet we have very little character study.  Why did Jackson behave as he did?  You will not find out in this film.  And that is a fatal error in any novel or film.
And slavery is treated as a some silly little divertisement.  Whether or not you agree that slavery was a major cause of the War, it certainly played a huge role in events leading up to the War.  You would not know it from this film.  You would think all slaves were treated as part of the family.  There is no notion of some of the inhumanity.
And the speeches!  Mr. Maxwell, this is a film not a play!  I just hope you have not destroyed any chance of Shaara's ""Last Full Measure"" making it to the screen.
I would recommend reading some of the historian's critiques in Civil War magazines.  As a group, they were also disappointed.",1053993600,3,2216,4.571065989847716
1887543,5,B00009OOFB,"I will first reveal to you that I'm a huge fan of gargantuan epics and sweeping romances like ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Barry Lyndon"", ""Giant"", and ""Havana"". Although, ""Gods & Generals"" is not a romance, emotions I've never seen so passionately portrayed before on the screen are bountiful in the most glorious picture I've seen in years.
""Gods & Generals"" relays the facts and tribulations that lead up to Gettysburg and is more than successful in doing so. Humanizing the generals is most apparent in General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson played by Stephen Lang. In all three key battle scenes he has the ability to remain calm as bullets pass him by. His secret? His devotion to God and his Christian religion. Jackson doesn't waste his time and when he has a free moment, he's usually praying to God. This is how he stays so calm; he understands that his life is in God's hands. If it's his time to go, then it's his time to go. This strength in character is charming and as is his relationship with a five year old girl whom he meets at a quiet Christmas party. This subplot (my personal favorite) is so emotionally driven, it's hard not to feel as though you've met these people once before, as they seem so real and genuine. When tragedy strikes, its oddly welcomed as it advances Jackson's emotional development. All in all, ""Gods & Generals"", with its beautiful imagery and haunting score, including the gorgeous masterpiece theme ""Going Home"" performed by Mary Fahl, is a vast and most extraordinary cinematic epic that is nothing short of beautiful.
When the four hours are up and the credits role to reveal Bob Dylan's original ballad ""'Cross the Green Mountains"", you'll want to take out the DVD and put it back into the player and watch it again. I know I did. This coming December, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" is coming out, no matter how well its done it will be unable to surpass the majestic grandeur of ""Gods & Generals"", it is most surely the best film of the year 2003, and even quite possibly the new decade. Rumor has it, in the near future, maybe two years from now, the complete film will come to DVD. The complete five and a half hour version. :) I pray every night for it.",1053561600,55,2213,4.548872180451128
1887544,3,B00009OOFB,"The prequel to the movie ""Gettysburg"", ""Gods and Generals"" deals with the period between the start of the American Civil War and the Battle of Gettysburg. Like it's predecessor, ""Gods and Generals"" isn't destined to be a box-office hit and is more likely to see more success in video release. It's too long; when I went to see this movies, the theater had placed an intermission in it.
While ""Gettysburg"" was a great movie, and the book ""Gods and Generals"" by the son of ""The Killer Angels"" author Mike Sharra was excellent, this movie falls short. This is probably the first movie I've ever been to where I felt like walking out before it was completed. The problem lies with the period of time ""Gods and Generals"" is set. Unlike ""Gettysburg"" and ""The Killer Angels"", which covers a period of four to five days, the book ""Gods and Generals"" covers a span of five *years*; from several days before John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry in 1859 to the days leading to the Battle of Gettysburg. This is where the movie failed to deliver.
Because of the span of years, and the already insane length of the movie, several key events in Civil War history are skipped. The movie features the Battles of First Manassas (or Bull Run), Fredricksburg, and Chancellorsville. As a result, John Brown's raid, the Pennisula campaign and Seven Days, Second Manassas (Bull Run), and Antietam are left out. The result is a movie with more holes in it than Swiss cheese. Also, in writing the book, Jeff Shaara gave a more even handed version of the events during the period before Gettysburg. Through Hancock, we see the frustration of the Union troops as they encounter one inept commander after another. The movie, however, focuses on General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson almost primarily; Generals Lee and Hancock are pushed to almost supporting characters in a complex story. I do not include Col. Chamberlain in that comparison, as he wasn't seen that much in the book, either (Fredricksburg being the only exception).
That's not to say the actors didn't do a good job with what they had. Stephen Lang, originally the ill-fated Pickett in ""Gettysburg"", does a fabulous job as the eccentric Stonewall. Robert Duvall does a somewhat better job than Martin Sheen as Robert E. Lee; I only say that because I think Lee was underused in this movie. Jeff Daniels once again shows why he is perfect for the role of Chamberlain. And with several actors reprising their roles from ""Gettysburg"", it does make the movie worthwhile to see.
However, the actors cannot take away the fact that this was a movie that would have been better off as a TV Mini-Series. Whoever convinced Ted Turner that this would do well as a feature film should have his or her head checked. As a mini series, this could have been broken up into several parts, allowing the writers and director to expand the story. The parts could have gone like this:
Part 1: Harper's Ferry and First Manassas
Part 2: The Rise of Robert E. Lee as General of the Army of Northern Virginia; the Peninsula Campaign and the Seven Days
Part 3: Second Manassas and Anteitam.
Part 4: Fredricksburg, Chancellorsville, and the days before Gettysburg.
As such, we are left to wait for the video release and hope Turner and Maxwell can redeem this movie that way. And perhaps the lessons learned from this experience will help save ""The Last Full Measure"" from a similar fate. I only give this move 3 stars, as there are no half stars. Actual rating: 2 and 1/2 stars",1053561600,,3487,4.727422003284072

I never believed that Hollywood could or would produce a movie that actually shows the true historical facts about Southern leaders and the cause of INDEPENDENCE for which they fought and died, or that Hollywood would actually show the yankee army as they really were. A mostly uncontrolled mob of rapist, thieves, and murderers, whose only superiority to the South was in numbers. Numbers of men, arms, and supplies and an endless supply of new immigrants for cannon fodder.
  Only the real Idiots, biggots, or those with a social agenda to push are condemning this movie as fictional or false. Those that have an open mind or have actually studied true documented historical facts from federal, state, and personal sources, will know the difference in this movie and the lies and propaganda that has been shoved down the publics throat since the north decided they had to cover up what they had just done to the South.
  This movie is a must see. True Southerners will find themselves cheering for the South in battle scenes as the bad guys get theirs, and crying unashamed as Jackson breathes his last, and there is a sense of lost hope for the Confederacy, but it will also swell you with pride for the sacrifices our Southern ancestors made, and the true Honors they are due.",1052956800,3,1334,4.737068965517241

The movie does have its flaws.  The sentiment tilts too much to the South and its cause and the movie devotes so long to the depiction of Jackson that we can call it ""Gods and Stonewall.""

  Gods and Generals is somewhat historically accurate. Most battles are resonable portrayed but the section where Lee is ""affirmed"" as the Southern Military leader is absurd. In relaity, Lee only was promoted to the head of the Army of Northern Virginia when Joe Johnston was injured.
  Furthermore, all the brilliance of looking at the events through the eyes of one character is simply lost. What does the Civil War early days have to do with Jackson drinking lemonade?
I will never know.
  Gods and Generals could have been a magnificent movie, but it spent maybe 40 mins portraying the war and about 1 hr and 40 mins looking at Jackson.

1887551,5,B00009OOFB,"As I have stated in previous reviews that I've written, I despise political correctness in every sense of the word. And when it comes to historical epic movies, I feel there is absolutely NO PLACE for political correctness. That being said, Gods and Generals is not only pretty much HISTORICALLY CORRECT but is totally engulfing to watch, from the southern 19th century language usage (including many original quotes from the period such as the last words spoken by General Jackson as he lay dying) to the way the characters interacted with each other to the war itself. The camera angles played a major role in the feel of this movie as well. The way the whole flick played out gave me the feeling that I was right there, in the company of the major players of that awful war.
It was nice, also, to see a Civil War movie that spoke of the reasoning behind the war itself - states rights. Now, no president in his right mind, whether it be Lincoln or, if by some twist of fate, Jefferson Davis, would allow any states to secede. As much as I understand why those states wanted to secede, as president, I would have done whatever I could to prevent that from happening. Was the way Lincoln handled it correct? Well, hindsight is 20/20 and that discussion has been played out for over 150 years. We know the route Lincoln did take - right or wrong - to keep the union as one, and this Gods and Generals shows how the beginning of this situation played out, at least from the southern point of view. A little more of the northern perspective would have been nice. Oh well, maybe in the extended DVD version.
Unfortunately, too many people take all of these Hollywood historical movies as fact, and, since that town is run by politically correct liberals who would rather change history to fit the way THEY feel it SHOULD have been, rather than the way it actually was, the majority of movie watchers usually do not get a good part of the truth. And that's a shame and a crime. Gods and Generals is the exception, which is a breath of fresh air. As Jeff Shaara, author of the original book this movie is based, stated in a recent interview (from the Gods and Generals magazine), ""Hollywood has a dismal record of portraying history. Historical films have one purpose - to make money - and it seems they have two means of realizing that. One, tell a story the studio thinks the audience wants to see, and thus tilt the story to whatever political correctness is in vogue. The second purpose is to allow one particular big time actor the chance to do 'cool things' on the screen. Though many of these films are entertaining, the one thing missing is any responsibility to give the audience the truth about the event being portrayed.""
Do not let the length scare you off. From beginning to end, I was held to my seat, greatly anticipating the next scene. Matter of fact, I saw it twice in one weekend - once with my wife and once with my two eldest sons - and I'm ready to see it again!

For the sixty million Ted Turner put into this mess, and with GETTYSBURG's Ron Maxwell directing, I was hoping for something alot better. Yes, there are moments when it almost starts to grab you, but it never quite gets there. The only redeeming factor is Stephen Lang's wonderful performance as Jackson. This film would be great if they trimmed everything out except his part and retitled it ""The Stonewall Jackson Story"".",1050019200,6,615,5.03921568627451

My wife and I found it excruciatingly sappy and dull, the last adjectives one would imagine pertaining to the Civil War.  We walked out before Gettysburg. What a massive waste of landscapes and re-enactors' time, not to mention investors' and movie-goers' money!  The southern accents are corny; the dialogue so naive and jejune that it is painful to listen to; and the vignettes and tableaus are patched together with little other narrative logic than a timeline.  This movie needs a screenwriter, an editor, a director, some acting talent, and a producer with the sense to say ""no way.""  Some good footage of carnage might be saved for a better story on the Civil Way.  Perhaps it is fitting to make a movie as disastrous as the war itself.  One lesson the makers of this disaster might have learned from Homer is that a war by itself doesn't make a story, much less an epic.  The story is inside the war, and it takes some talent if not genius to tease it out.

I believe it would have been better and would have quelled some negative reviews had it been two movies.  The one you see concentrates on Stonewall Jackson, which is fine in an of itself but because they had to make the movie four hours or less they had to cut.  So Antietam and the Emancipation Proclamation are missed, along with the agony Lincoln had in trying to find any commander to compete with Lee.  The movie shows well the organization of the Confederate Army and should have shown the overwhelming confusion within the North from McDowell toMclellan to  Pope to McClellan to Burnside to Hooker to Meade.  Unless you are schooled in this you have no clue the level of disorganization of the North and how close the south came to getting the North to stop.  I can't say the South could have won for it was only Lincolns tenacity that kept things going and saved the nation.  I hope the third movie highlights the efforts of the brave men of the North like Gods and Generals highligthed the brave men of the south.  IT IS WELL WORTH IT.",1049932800,2,1117,4.49009900990099

So, obviously, since Gettysburg is my favorite movie of all time, I was really hyped to see this.  The acting was great, especially with Stephen Lang jumping from Pickett in Gettysburg to a more serious General Jackson in Gods.  I also enjoyed Jeff Daniels reprising his role as Joshua Chamberlain.  Also, Robert Duvall far exeeded Martin Sheen in his portrayal of Robert E. Lee.  Also, the story was very good, but I do have some criticisms.  I felt that it focused too much on Jackson.  If Ron Maxwell would have stuck closer to the book and included more on Lee and Hancock and others, the movie would have by far been better than Gettysburg.  As a history major about to enter my second year in college, I was especially thrilled with the historical accuracy of the movie.

1887556,5,B00009OOFB,"I take issue with many of the reviews that have panned GODS AND GENERALS. I have taught American history for over thirty years and have a deep interest in the civil war. The movie is
not perfect and there are ommisions. What we have is the start for providing a new generation of Americans an interest in our
past. The Civil War was a defining moment in American History. Too few Americans understand how that war shaped us as a nation. As Shelby Foote stated in Ken Burn's Civil War, The war made us an""is."" GODS AND GENERALS shows that in 1861 many Americans were
unsure where their loyality belonged...to the state or to the nation. This is a conflict many do not understand today.
  The film also is the first film to bring to life in a partial and incomplete way on of the key figures of the Civil War - Thomas Jackson. The film is in no way a complete picture of Jackson. A lot is left out concerning his secretivness and
habits, but it is a start. It motivates interest. Certainly, there is room in the future for a more definitive biography of Jackson, but this film introduces him to a new generation of Americans.
  I feel many of the critics were overly harsh in some of their criticisms. One deplored that the film gave the impression that the South was victorious. During the time period of the film, it often was. One deplored the lack of ""Blood and guts"" in the film. To produce a film of this scale, the producers and director produced the best film they could given what would be astronomical costs to do blood and guts special effects. One critic lampooned the film because ""all of the actors were talking through beards."" Look at our penny and Abraham Lincoln! Beards were the style!

THE IMAGES THE ACTORS PORTRAYED, LIKE CHAMBERLAIN AND JACKSON WERE SO SOLID AS TO WARRANT A NOMINATION IN SOME OSCAR AWARD CATEGORY. TO SEE JACKSON PORTRAYED, WAS A FIRST  IN ITSELF. WHERE HAS HE BEEN? I FELT I WAS WATCHING HIS BIOGRAPHY AT TIMES. HIS ECCENTRITY CAME THROUGH AS WELL AS HIS LOVE OF WAR.
 AT LEAST HANCOCK GOT MORE AIRTIME, BUT COMPARED TO THE BOOK IT WAS FAR LESS. CHAMBERLAIN WAS HIS USUAL INTELLECTUAL SELF.  THE ACTORS WERE PREACHY AND LONG-WINDED AT TIMES, BUT SO WERE THEIR PERSONAL WRITINGS. THEY SPOKE AND WROTE WITH GREAT DELIBERATENESS AND EMOTION.
 I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME DIGITALIZED BATTLES COMBINED WITH REENACTORS. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WHILE WAITING FOR THE NEXT MOVIE IS FIGURING OUT WHO WILL BE GRANT. MY VOTE IS FOR HARRISON FORD. MAYBE BRAD PITT CAN DROP IN AS CUSTER. WE NEED A SHORT, FEISTY, AND FIGHTING IRISHMAN AS SHERIDAN. HMMM.

SHERMAM WAS A FIGIDTY, NERVOUS, AND LONG WINDED TALKER ON ALL SUBJECTS T, BUT HE AND GRANT ARE THE BEST OF BUDDIES AND THAT IS A KEY INGREDIENT AS THEY PLAN THE SOUTH'S DESTRUCTION. I VOTE FOR HYPERACTIVE PERSONALITY AT MIDDLE AGE LIKE JAMES CAAN AS SHERMAN

1887559,5,B00009OOFB,"Ronald Maxwell has taken on one of the most difficult tasks in movie-making, the crafting of an historical period piece about which almost every viewer approaches with a prior attitude, and replacing time-worn icons with flesh-and-blood characters. ""Gods and Generals"" dispells the mythology of 140 years of rancorous historiography to take its place as the instant classic movie of the War Between the States.
The scope is epic, with obvious effort at attention to detail and accuracy, with the recreation of the havoc and savagery of battles fought with weapons far deadlier than the tactics of the day. (A notable exception is the deletion of the carnage of Antietam.) Some may wince at the slaughter at Fredericksburg, but, in truth, if the images of Matthew Brady and others are to be believed, the movie is probably too gentle in its depiction of the gore of battle. More to the point is the metaphor that Irish against Irish in that battle portrays of the truth of the addage of ""brother against brother"" of the Civil War.
The film's greatest strength lies in its portaits of the storied combatants.  Here, the performances shine. Stephen Lang's virtuoso rendering of the complexity that was ""Stonewall"" is surrounded by an excellent Jeff Daniels's Joshua Chamberlain and Robert Duvall's marvelously muted Robert E. Lee. And Maxwell's faithfulness to Jeffrey Shaara's novel results in the abolition of icons with the inclusion of the intimacy of Anna Jackson and Fanny Chamberlain and the family love that both men cherished.
It is interesting to note that Chamberlain, professor of religion and classic studies, has not yet reached the height of his reputation, which would come at Gettysburg, the film of which has already been made. And Jackson, whose religion is inseparable from his being, dies at Chancellorsville. But director Maxwell unapologetically renders the Christian character of Lee, Jackson and Chamberlain as a fact, in the context of the 1860's mindset. And his doing so is a fulfillment of his duty as an historical film-maker, just as our look at the wives and families of Jackson and Chamberlain are his expositing of truth, not a nod to political correctness.
The Thomas J. Jackson who Stephen Lang brings to life was a slave-owning Presbyterian who saw God's hand at work in everything. Among those things were his starting a black Sunday school (to the amazement and displeasure of the townspeople of Lexington, VA) and paying Jim Lewis, another man's slave, to be his manservant. Impossible? In 2003, most surely, but certainly not in 1861. It is a combination of this kind of complexity and Maxwell's depiction of the great conflict with such circumspection, rare in our video-game-attention-span lifestyle, which gives credence to the joy of reading a letter at home and devotion to a palpable God among men who held hundreds of others' lives in their next decision.
The PC police will cringe at ""Gods and Generals."" Those who come to this opus without that baggage will be swept along with the intensity of a mimi-ball and most likely come away with a greater appreciation for the character of those whose feiry conviction forged this nation on the anvils of Bull Run, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville and Gettysburg.",1049068800,8,3252,5.078504672897196
1887560,5,B00009OOFB,"I do feel very excited about Gods & Generals.  It was exactly the movie I wanted to see.  It's showing of the Civil War and the various thoughts and ideas that were around in era were tremendous.  I thought that all the major views of the politics at the time were represented and shown in an organized,thoughtful way within the story.
The scene between the Martha the slave & General Hancock in the hospital over a dead Union soldier were a very strong announciation of her fight for freedom while being loyal to the absent family.
The scene between Jackson & his cook also showed a poignancy of the problem of being a slave who wants his freedom and would love to hear the words from his owner and the knowledge that if one keeps up in the same vein one is likely to get his owner mad and receive some retaliation.
I loved the family scenes even though the wives weren't happy to let their men go to war. Just like now-a-days, hunh.
I liked the through line of the young man staying in the South to fight for Jackson.  Later on he got caught switching sides and paid for it with his life as Jackson had promised earlier on.  According to my reading that happened alot on both sides.  It's the small details that make a movie fun to watch.  That was a big deal depicting man's responsibility for his actions.
The battle scenes were great. I especially liked the Irish scenes; although I have one quibble with the scene that shows Jackson alone when General Bee said that his brigade was standing there like a stone wall.  Jackson would have argued about that as he did in life and in the movie that it was his men that were the stone wall.
Chamberlain & Buster must be real friends by now.  They are able to convey so much in their scenes together.  Also the slavery speech that Chamberlain lays on baby brother Tom.
Mr Maxwell I salute you on the wonderful job you did on this movie.  I have been supporting and recommending it to all I see and sending email to the cineplexes to bring it back.  They don't seem to have local numbers.",1048982400,2,2036,4.357142857142857
1887561,5,B00009OOFB,"God and generals is a very good and interesting movie which is part one of a trilogy based on the civil war.  Stephan Lang did an excellent job as general Sonewall Jackson his performance gives me a better look as what the real Thomas Stonewall Jackson must have been as a leader of the confederate army.  Robert Duvall made a great Robert E. Lee a better performance than Martin Sheen in Gettysburg.  Jeff Daniels returns as Lt. Chamberlain a roll which stands out in Gettysburg and continues to shine in Gods and Generals.  The battle scenes in this were a lot clearer and had more of a punch than the battles in the film Gettysburg.  The battles that really stood out in this movie were Fredericksburg when the two Irish Birgades on opposing sides were shooting and killing each other.  Between the music score and the way the battle was filmed it really has a powerful impact.  The battle of Chancellorsville the films final battle really stood out when you see all these confederates coming out of the woods without making a sound made my heart race.  I enjoyed Gettysburg and it makes a very good sequal to gods and generals but between the two Gods and Generals had the most impact on me.  If you have an interest in the civil war these movies along with Glory opens your mind and gives you a strong image to what it was like actually being there.  The things I wish they had in Gods and Generals is the battle of Antietam the bloodiest day in the civil war, and the rebel yell I've read that it was used by Stonewall Jackson just before he advanced his troops to attack.  I look foward to seeing The Last Full Measure keeping Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee and bringing Jeff Daniels, and Stephan Lang back.

1887565,5,B00009OOFB,"This is not a perfect movie.  I gave it 5 stars based on its perfection comparative to other recent movies.  First, the negative aspects:  The women's clothes are often very bad.  I can spot [store] lace a mile away, and the dresses were often ill-fitting and/or inappropriate for the venue, which I found distracting.  The same can be said for the civilian men's clothing.  The CG scenes were likewise bad.  The film-makers seemed to be laboring under the handicap of never having really studied the classes of people they tried to portray.  One of my acquaintances remarked that the Virginia legislature looked like an aging motor-cycle gang.  I agree.  Like it or not, many of these men were but little removed from Brit nobility.  Several acquaintances have remarked on the inappropriateness of Mrs. Pendleton's hair--this is nit-picky, but was, nevertheless, distracting.  Many of the minor roles are badly cast--the scene depicting a gathering of Confederate generals was no better, if as good, as what one can see at any re-enactment.  I thought Ted should have gotten more for his money.  Most disappointing was the score.  As flawed as Gettysburg was, the score was magnificent--I expected something comparable for G&G, and it just wasn't there.
On the positive side, Stephen Lang WAS Stonewall Jackson.  There is really no dichotomy in Jackson's personality--he was an integral man.  Lang was able to portray him as such.  Truly the most masterful acting job I've ever witnessed.  The dialog was appropriate for its time.  That's how folks talked.  Live with it.  The constant affirmation of Faith was likewise authentic.  It's easy to mock something that one has no conception of.  The apparent dichotomy of slaves who loved their owners yet wanted to be free is unfathomable only to shallow minds, and is, in fact racist.  People who would never bat an eye at the loyalty of the physician Keptah to Lucanus and Diodorus in ""Dear and Glorious Physician"" nevertheless fume when the same attributes are displayed by Confederate negroes--as if they were incapable of loyalty and patriotism surpassing personal interest.  For shame.  The love story between Stonewall and Anna is powerful, touching, and completely convincing.  The film is not afraid to portray the conflict as ""Lincoln's War"", and deals fairly with the president in including his outrageous message to the Union troops after the slaughter at Fredericksburg. However, more kindness could have been shown to Burnside, who did not, in fact, behave in as arrogant a fashion as the film portrayed.  Perhaps this was done to lessen the degree of guilt which ought to have been Lincoln's.  Best of all, Martin Sheen did not appear in this movie.  The wonderful Robert Duval misses General Lee, but manages to at least do him honor in his dignified and strong portrayal.  This is a movie which I will purchase as soon as it is released on DVD.  I hope that the director can correct his mistakes before he films ""Last Full Measure"", but I also hope he will not revert to the political correctness and historical revisionism displayed in ""Gettysburg"".  He has taken a giant step toward making the perfect ""Civil War"" movie.  A few tweaks here and there should do it.",1047772800,13,3230,4.973831775700934

It was unbiased and only revealed both sides of the conflict from the North and South's perspective. Although it had a 12-minute intermission, I wanted the movie to keep flowing without any interruptions. I was never bored and the battle scenes were amazing. Stephen Lang deserves to win some kind of award for his portrayal of ""Stonewall"" Jackson. He was fantastic. Terrific movie! I can't wait for the DVD to come out.

I've heard people complain about this movie glorifying the south.  Unfortunately, they do not realize that during the time period this film takes place, the south spanked the north.  Okay, so there was slavery in the south.  Was that the reason for the war?  Heck no.  How many soldiers in the Confederacy actually owned slaves?  This movie does a wonderful job of portraying the real reasons for the war.
I've also heard complaints of the movie being too long.  I feel the movie was too short.  The 6-hour version soon to come out will do the story greater justice as you can not take two and a half years and justly squeeze it into less than four hours.

Prior to seeing the movie, we strongly recommend reading the history of three battles on the war, First Bull Run or First Manassas, Fredericksburg 1862 and finally the Wilderness and Chancellorsville, 1863 prior to seeing the movie.
This will clearly set the time of the American Civil War and help follow the leading characters depicted in the book by Jeff Shara.  One will see how well Jeff's book mirrors the history of these events.
As compared to Gettysburg, this movie becomes very personal on the life of Stonewall Jackson.
This movie provides a novice historian a good prespective of the hardships of the soldiers and the horror of war.

1887569,4,B00009OOFB,"I apporached this movie with some doubt, not because of the politically correct panning that this picture has picked up but because of the poor acting and plotting in Gettysburg.  I was pleased to see that such fears were totally unwarranted.
Gods and Generals is an excellent start to the trilogy, a start which actually improves Gettysburg by its existance.
DuVal in my opinion was born to play Lee as much as he was born to play Tom Hayden, in addition Stephen Lang give an Oscar worthy performance as Stonwall Jackson, (far superior to his job in the first movie as Pickett.)  however since this is a sympathetic portrayal of not only a Confederate General but a believer in Christ that is as likely as Ms Streisand joining Demorcrats for Bush.  It would not be a stretch to say that this movie is Turner's love letter to the south and some might object on that basis, that however ignores two relevent facts:  This is a quality picture in its own right and it will not change the outcome of the war.
Howell and Conway repeat their fine performances from the first movie and a stockier Jess Daniels frankly improves on his first performance.
The action scenes and the battle scenes were also an improved over the first picture.  I suspect practice makes perfect and the next movie will likely be even better.
The Character development on the home front and the torn loyalties of both slaves and their masters are portrayed well.  This great contradiction which Daniels expands on in his final speech make the movie more interesting and also makes it dangerous to the PC crowd.
I can't shake the feeling however that it should have been two movies.  Like the Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter movies this movie delivers quality and a lot of picture for your money, unlike those movies which didn't feel long this one did.  It is the only thing that keeps it from 5 stars.
I will without a doubt buy the extended DVD when it comes out and will await the final move with pleasure.  I hope the poor box office doesn't prevent it from being made.  (After all Turner can afford it.)",1047254400,14,2085,4.565683646112601
1887570,2,B00009OOFB,"Needless to say, a disappointment. This film is inferior in almost every respect to its predecessor, ""Gettysburg,"" for the same reasons its source material is inferior to that film's source.
""Gettysburg"" and ""The Killer Angels,"" Michael Shaara's Pulitzer-winning novel, covered three days and focused on four primary characters. His son Jeff's prequel, which this movie is named after, attempted to condense five years and four lives into one book with mixed results. Civil War novices could not appreciate much of the sequence of events nor learn the underlying causes.
""Gods and Generals: The Movie"" compounds this glancing approach to key moments (e.g., don't blink or you'll miss General Hooker!) by adding nonessential scenes, tacked-on gilded speeches, and lengthy quotations of poetry. And it's laudable, overt portrayal of the spiritual devotion of the principals - something I was eagerly anticipating - is also hurt by the same melodramatics.
There are a few honest-to-goodness quality moments. I cherished those. But it is all completely overshadowed by the horror I shall now describe.
I know he paid for this movie, but someone needed to step up and cut out Ted Turner's suspension-of-disbelief-shattering cameo and the misbegotten sing-along that surrounds it. Not only does he look like a time-traveling corporate executive but also the sight of Ted jawboning with Robert E. Lee and his commanders and all of them merrily joining in as a fey troubador sings ""Bonnie Blue Flag"" is a shock from which I may never recover. Or, as this script would put it ""The sight of the general and his most trusted lieutenants, in such a state of unabashed and idle revelry, would cause my heart such piteous fright that I may not soon - unless providence intervene and the good will of others reign supreme - recover to my previous healthy and heretofore vital state.

Shucks, Chamberlain even became ill in my hometown of Remington (then Rappahannock Station, VA). All I can say about GODS AND GENERALS is that it is a must-see. I can't wait for the third installment to arrive.
The only disappointments I had were as follows:
1. cheap looking distant cannon flashes at Mayre's Heights in Fredericksburg (budget cuts I'm sure).
2. vastly inferior music score compared to GETTYSBURG (No, I didn't like Green Mountain...I think the wrong person sang it).
3. Waiting too long to shoot the 2nd installment(and losing Berenger in the process).
4. Lack of perceived recoil of firearms in closeups (hey, these things really did kick some, you know!).
I don't like ""fluffy"" movie scenes, but the ones depicting the women in the lives of the CW characters were done with grace and dignity. It kept my wife's attention, and I must admit mine too!!

1887572,5,B00009OOFB,"Gods and Generals is an amazing film, one that I didn't think could ever be made in America today, I'm sad to say, because it unashamedly portrays historical characters and events in their TRUE contexts, not dressed in the politically correct thought and language of today.  Southerners are presented in this film thinking and acting as they actually did, not as dunderheaded Hollywood types imagine they should.  Judging both from the reviews of the overwhelminging leftist, liberal movie reviewers across America, they are shocked that Hollywood, not to mention one of their icons, Ted Turner, would let such a film be made. Their utterly predictable expressions of outrage towards the film's depiction of the Southern Cause, slavery and religious faith just confirm that this is a remarkable film, a landmark in the history of American filmmaking.
I look forward to with anticipation to the third installment of the series, The Last Full Measure, and for the role of U.S. Grant , I would suggest, based upon his recent work, Mel Gibson.  He has proven that he can play understated, subdued, yet determined characters, such as in 'The Patriot', and 'Signs', and he resembles Grant enough, that I think his portrayal would be historic.  I would very much enjoy the scene of Mel Gibson and Robert Duvall meeting in the McLean Parlor at Appomattox;  I believe it would be very memorable, indeed.",1047081600,2,1394,5.017316017316017
1887573,3,B00009OOFB,"Does this top Gettysburg?  Probably not in my opinion.  For the person who doesn't have much knowledge of the Civil War this movie may seem confusing at times. I asked myself, ""Is this a movie about Stonewall Jackson?"" or ""Is this a jab at Union leadership during 1861 to 1863?"".  Based on Shaara's novel, the movie does skip some interesting chapters in the book which may have helped build several characters confusingly added as history unfolded.  Truly it is very hard to capture the years of the war without skipping key events such as Antietam or 2nd Manassas and fit it all in nearly four hours.  The romantic and mythic feel of Lee and Jackson somewhat come to life though their aura rarely shines as compared to the novel.  Maxwell has truly taken on more than moviegoers may be able to handle or understand in this wildly ever-changing film.  For the non-Civil War buff, I would rate it 3 stars.
Now for the Civil War buff rating:
1 star.  For a Civil War Historian like myself it skips too many things, introduces unimportant individuals to timeline with important events.  Over glorified characters are brought forward and Union leadership is horribly constructed to explain their motivations or history.  The fighting is extremely clean (made for television someday) and confusingly demonstrated as to explain the battles. Large scale battles such as Fredericksburg and Manassas are near skirmishes on film which can make a novice think few were involved.  Uniforms and grit are better conveyed compared to Gettysburg although some battlefield pyrotechnics are constructed on computers that look very fake and laughable.  This leads me to say to Maxwell, does the movie ""Glory"" mean anything?  If you want to demonstrate action, please watch the first 15 minutes of Glory to get a better feel of battle and put that same action into your movies! Maxwell's cleanliness unfortunately reappears and poorly defines Civil War fighting.  The silly romances of Stonewall Jackson and his wife along with model-like actresses made this movie a poor representation of how people looked and lived in 1860.  I hate to nitpick, but this movie just didn't have it.",1046995200,3,2163,4.986072423398329
1887574,5,B00009OOFB,"I was very impressed by 'Gods and Generals'. The theater I went to was packed and the people in the crowd were very appreciative. Everyone stayed until the end. Stephen Lang did a excellent job as Stonewall Jackson. Duvall, Daniels, and Mallon were very good in there roles. I wish there would have been more Lee, Chamberlain, and Hancock but I understood they were focusing on Jackson. The battle scenes were excellent. Fredericksburg with the street fighting and the charges against the stonewall at Marye's Heights were mesmerizing. The scenes of the Confederates coming out of the woods at Chancellorsville were also well done. The death of Stonewall was very moving. I'm glad to see a movie about the Civil War that is not afraid to portray both sides fairly. I can't wait for the extended DVD which will expand and enhance this excellent movie.",1046908800,3,850,4.86896551724138
1887575,3,B00009OOFB,"The movie was poorly edited. Several times we see the same shot over and over again. We see the Union soldiers carrying back the injured and you can tell it's the same actors again and again. They just repeated the scene. Panning across the stone wall you see every 5th person get hit. Each person dies with the most overdramatic movements I've seen, reaching to the camera. The plot is mild. The thought of making a proper civil war movie was nice, but you can't have the extras fooling around in the back of a shot. If they didn't repeat scenes they wouldn't need to have an intermission. Watch it on a rainy day rented from the local video store.",1046908800,,649,4.416666666666667

  Jackson was alright.  Brian Mallon as General Hancock, was
  overshadowed, this actors part was not only intregal but
  important.  The 12 minute intermission was needed.  I would
  rate the movie as 3 stars.  There were however imperfections
  historically only one attuned to this era would pick up.
  I felt that Ron Maxwell's Gettysburg had more feeling.  I do
  however like the use of the actors, especially how Maxwell
  was able to gather many from Gettysburg.  I wish I could have seen the Antietem Battle, as this battle was pivotal.  I understand it is part of a future DVD release.",1046908800,,655,4.851851851851852
1887577,4,B00009OOFB,"I went to see the movie on opening day.  I have been looking forward to seeing this film for a couple of years.  I am a big Shaara fan and his books are outstanding.  I was disappointed right from the opening scene when I immediately recognized that about a third of the book had been left out of the movie.  I don't feel that the movie lead us into Gettysburg very well.  There was not enough about Hancock, Champerlain, and Lee in the movie.  Leaving out the pre-war material and skiping so much that was in the book weakened the movie and kept it from having a good flow.
The movie should have been called the Stonewall Jackson story.  That would have made me enter the theater not knowing what to expect.  I did enjoy the movie, but like I said, I was expecting a movie based on Jeff Shaara's book and in that sense I was disapointed.",1046908800,,838,4.2594936708860756
1887578,4,B00009OOFB,"Personally I thought the box office hit GETTYSBURG was not such a hit.  I am a Civil War buff and living only a few miles from the town of Gettysburg I know the history well.  When the movie was filmed it focused only on the the battle and not on the aftermath of the town or any of the major skirmishes that occured.  I recently went to see GODS AND GENERALS hoping that it would be a better rendition of the war, and it was.
Although it focuses more on the life of Gen. Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson it was very good.  I did see some of the effects on the town of Fredericksburg, however I believe that including only three battles in the movie was a mistake.  Robert Duvall made  a more believable version of Gen. Lee than Martin Sheen, however, he did not have a very large part in the movie which was more of a surprise.  GODS AND GENERALS focuses more on the Confederacy than anything and other than a clip or two of Gen. Burnside we really did not see how the Union was losing so many battles.  The much Older Jeff Daniels does an equally wonderful job as Chamberlin again, but he gets a bit long winded and annoying at times.
This movie is a wonderful insight to the war becuase of the script, the footage, the slaves, and the towns people.  It gave a view that GETTYSBURG did not.  This movie focused on everyone, not just a small portion of those who suffered and why.  I made this a 4 star review because I think it could have been better and some if the times spent praying and talking could have been spent on the smaller stories and other battles.  Other than that I feel that this is a must for a civil war buff, it is a fast four hours, but a silent one because it really does show the hard times of war and the people who suffered it.",1046822400,,1748,4.169642857142857
1887579,4,B00009OOFB,"The movie is certainly different than Gettysburg which depicted one great epic battle in American history.  Gods and Generals took on a little more ambitious project of trying to cover three battles.  This of course leaves out such notable battles as Sharpsburg, the single bloodiest day of combat in American history and the Peninsula campaign which brought Robert E. Lee into command of the Army of Northern Virginia.  As one on commentator also brought out, the movie just barely touched on the marvelous campaign of Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley which really catapulted his reputation as feared military commander.  However, this movie portrayed an aspect of the Civil War not really covered in Gettysburg and which the critics seem to want to gloss over and that is the impact of the war on civilians.  This was really brought out particularly in the Fredericksburg battle.  It also imphasized the great influence on religion not only for Jackson but for all who fought in that day.  This is not really brought out in most popular books on the Civil War, but a reading of the letters of soldiers to and from their families, really stresses the importance of God in their lives.  So from this cultural standpoint, I felt Gods and Generals was excellent.",1046822400,3,1260,4.910377358490566
1887580,1,B00009OOFB,"The rating above is for the historian.  For the average filmgoer, 31/2 stars would do it.  First off, the 1 star rating:  this film is NOT a ""true"" story of the Civil War, nor even of Jeff Shaara's book.  The plain fact of this film is that it is rife with historical inaccuracies.  To go into all of them would take longer than watching the film.  Most severe, however, is the portrayal of Thomas Jackson.  Stephen Lang would be my first choice, though of course, he's an excellent actor.  But Jackson was NEVER the man portrayed in this film.  Not even in the book.  It's almost laughable (but ultimately embarassing) what Ron Maxwell reduces him to.  You Civil War buffs out there will know what I'm talking about.  Another point definitely worth mentioning here is the absolute radical changes made from Jeff Shaara's novel.  There were no minor dramatic liberties taken, this film is almost entirely different.  Character's dropped and even added (what's with the 5-year-old girl from Fredricksburg?).  Characters given MUCH less treatment in the film (Lee plays a much bigger, completely rounded part in the novel, as he did historically, and was never the father figure he's always made out to be).
I could go on, I really could, but this review only allows me 1000 words.
Now, just so I cover all bases and not get anybody completely mad at me, for the average filmgoer, this movie rates high.  It takes a very broad story and moves it at a lightning pace (the four hours went by quite fast).  It's very nicely edited within scenes and shot very well, also (which is the most striking difference from Gettysburg, which had the same crew).  The musical score and the songs are great, adding much to the visuals.
But, there are problems I have with the film as a film, too.  The CG work is WAY below par.  Let's face it, Ted Turner's got more money than God and is the cheapest person alive.  If New Line Cinema can create 10,000 Uruk Hai storming Helm's Deep in the Two Towers and do it so well, it looks absolutely seamless, then I would be inclined to think that the $4 billion Ted Turner could afford some better effects, not so here.  If Maxwell were a more aggressive director, the film would have been better.  There of course are many things to point out and nit pick at, I just need to rant about the main points.  One last one is something I think a more able writer/director could do: subtlety.  Why is it that EVERYTHING in this film has to be done with such fanfare?  Maxwell didn't do it in Gettysburg, but it's done to death in this film.  And it's not just the battle scenes (those deserve it more than anything), it's the dialogue, it's the movements, etc.  I know people in the nineteenth century were more articulate and grandiose, but it's like these actors are performing Shakespeare, tone it down a bit.
This film is filled with could have's, should have's and would have's.  It could have been the absolute blockbuster of 2003, I have been waiting for this film for years, but to no avail.  Read the book and you will understand.
Anyway, Gettyburg this ain't.  But I would still recommend this film to people and let them make their own opinions.  If anyone is in dire need of a REALLY good Civil War film after seeing this, the obvios choice is to watch Gettysburg, but I cannot recommend Edward Zwick's film Glory enough (which in my opinion is the finest war film ever made).  Watch Glory and be stunned, watch Gods and Generals and be glad you got it out of the way, then go read the book and be stunned.",1046822400,11,3537,4.519685039370079
1887581,5,B00009OOFB,"In my first viewing I was startled to see what my genealogy research has proven to be so; An Accurate Southern Movie with a social science approach to the invasion of the Southern States, amazing.
On my second viewing I now had presence of mind to assimilate more details - again just amazing!
As to the slavery question - again social science discipline, although brief did show why slavery in the South was called: ""Our Peculiar Institution"" and was over 200 years old when the war started; Our Peculiar Institution was not understood or known by new foreign immigrants or peoples of the industrial NE. We believed and still believe that it was our soverign right to decide when and how all slaves would be freed so that they could be as fine a people as they could be. We are the ones that lived and worked side by side with them. In our ""Peculiar Institution"" even Frederick Douglas, ex-slave,and the NE abolisnist was treated with respect by his masters, and he learned the better and finer points of living as a child at their knee which is evidenced by the fact that he so much appreciated their culture that he patterned his home in the NE and his life style after theirs.
I sincerely hope all will see this movie more than once and will further their studies to include Southern writers and points of view - for peace and harmony in this Nation nothing less will do.",1046736000,14,1375,4.526104417670683

The biggest problem in this film is with the editing. Some scenes deserve to be left on the cutting room floor, unfortunatly three quarters of this film falls into this catagory! I also have a real problem with the depliction of the slaves in Gods and Generals, this film makes it look like slavery wasn't a problem for anyone and that it really didn't even excist.
I will say that the battle scenes were very well done, unfortunatly that isn't enough to save this cluncker!",1046563200,5,691,4.448818897637795
1887585,5,B00009OOFB,"Maxwell hit the nail on the head with this one.  The antebellum south and war-torn U.S. were captured perfectly and the performances were awesome.
I read the other reviews and you have to be an atheist or historically illiterate to not give this movie the highest rating!  Some of these reviewers would probably give ""Dumbass, the Movie"" a much higher rating!
I'm not particularly religious, but the religious fervor in the movie was very appropriate.  Stonewall WAS extremely devout and so was Lee (though Roger Ebert apparently wasn't aware of this fact).
Lang's portrayal of Stonewall Jackson was award-winning and even a bit eerie - if you've seen a photo of Stonewall the resemblance is amazing, even to the piercing eyes.  Duvall as Lee was also a vast improvement over Sheen's puffball performance in ""Gettysburg.""  As for the shallow blasting by some critics of the age differences between some of the returning stars of both movies, I believe the book, ""Gods and Generals"" was released after the the movie ""Gettysburg"" so it would have been quite difficult to have the same actors look younger than they did a decade ago.
Concerning the length, the injection of the Battle of Antietam, though historically important, would have either meant removing another vital element of the film or adding another hour or so, thus really making those poor marshmellow-butts whine!
Personally, I found it very satisfying to watch ""Gods and Generals"" at the theatre and immediately throw the longer ""Gettysburg"" into the DVD player when I arrived home.
If these two movies are any indication of the last installment, ""The Last True Measure"" will be a fantastic piece of film-making.",1046476800,50,1677,5.03971119133574
1887586,2,B00009OOFB,"The War for Southern Independence, aka The Civil War, is one of my passions. I own over 200 books about the conflict, most published between 1860 and 1899 and written by the people who were there. I know the real causes, the politics, the battles, the geography, and the major officers on both sides of the conflict. Therefore I couldn't wait to see this movie.
Even though our local reviewer complained about too much talking, I decided to go anyway. I left two hours later at the intermission. I overheard one woman asking another ""Did these people pontificate like this all the time?""
TOO MUCH TALK
None of the dialog in this movie was simple or direct. Every time someone spoke it was a speech, sermon, poetry reading, a bible reading, or all of the above. They even had one slave quoting Napolean and another reciting a long biblical passage in perfect English, only to fall back into black dialect immediately after.
AND NOT ENOUGH ACTION
Most of the battle scenes looked like what they were; namely, shots of people re-enacting battles. Some were better than others but nothing like what you saw in Brave Heart or Private Ryan.
You would see a lot of people fall while marching up the hill, either from rifle shots or cannon, but then when the battle was over and you were shown the field, there weren't that many bodies on the ground. There was no real sense of the horror of battle like you get with Kurasawa's movies for example.
I was very disappointed in this movie.",1046390400,8,1478,4.6022727272727275
1887587,5,B00009OOFB,Gods and Generals is truly the other side of the historical coin. The flags at the beginning of the movie I thought were a great touch of showing that the Civil War was really a war between the states. The movie was very graphic and powerful. I remember thinking the first 5 minutes of the movie that Mr. Maxwell had guts to make this movie. Then about halfway through the movie I started thinking how much Ted Turner has done for the restoration of films and history. I admire Mr. Turner for the financing of this film even though the prospect exists of losing money due to the historical/political subject matter of the film. The movie is a true historical masterpiece while giving tremendous insight into the Southern belief of independence. I thought Robert Duvall did an excellent portrayal of Robert E. Lee. I still believe Lonesome Dove is his best work. I like Martin Sheen but Duvall projected a strength that Sheen was unable to demonstrate in Gettysburg. Mr. Lang as Stonewall was just incredible. He played him I believe perfectly demonstrating great passion between being a pious man and a blue eyed killer. Mr. Lang's performance was able to bridge Jackson's beliefs of God and War by events of scripture. His belief in God allowed him to be the great leader in battle he became. This is kind of a paradox in itself if you think about it. I will be disappointed for Mr. Lang that his Oscar caliber performance will go unrecognized due to today's social sense of political correctness. I can't wait for the next installment. I hope the DVD comes out within the next year.,1046390400,10,1584,4.660714285714286

This movie rarely stayed on plot! I understand they want to get into to the minds of Jackson and Lee, but, come on' after watching Jackson (Lange) widdle wood for 10 minutes I got somewhat bored. And that was ONE OF MANY completely pointless parts of the film! 4 hours! WHAT DID THEY CUT OUT? Personally, this movie could have been 2 or 2.5 hours GENEROUSLY! The acting was pathetic!

They were men of constant prayer and knew that they were Christians. They were fearless in expressing their faith in Christ to their fellow soldiers. They believed if they were to die on the battle field they would be instantly eschorted into heaven because of what their Savior did for them by dying a vicarious death.

1887594,1,B00009OOFB,"The Civil War era affords a great opportunity for filmmakers and audiences alike who want action, drama, tension, and all of the elements that make movies well remembered and worth watching throughout the generations. It is certainly a fascinating period of US History and thus warrants the Hollywood attention it has attracted in the past years. Gods and Generals fails, in every possible respect, to capture the mood and emotional tension of the Civil War, as overall quality must have seemed a fair trade for supreme historical accuracy.
The script is certainly an important part of a movie; it delivers the character interaction and provides a gateway into understanding chemistry of various situations, as well as a means toward advancing the plot. Unfortunately, the script suffers from ""Soliqui-tus."" People do not in real life speak to each other in Soliloquy, and so, in a movie, a conversation will inevitably appear unnatural when characters exchange fifty line speeches. This such mode of communication epitomizes almost every scene in the movie, and remember that you won't be watching a Shakespearian work, where such theatrical modes enhance the quality of the art. In Gods and Generals, the oral theatrics is wholly devoid of anything that might be construed as emotionally gripping or believable, both the result of poor direction and editing decisions as well as a script bogged in over-extended, vaccous dialogue.
Don't expect the battle scenes to redeem the film's other numerous theatrical shortcomings, either. The battles are more lame and disappointing than the plot. Instead of drama and energy, a torrential field of war fraught with death, blood and passion, the audience struggles to stay awake as unmotivated extras jog at each other and half-assedly pretend to be locked in the throes of deadly combat. The battles look like a movie Steven Spielberg made when he was a kid. The special effects are seriously wanting; there is no blood (this is a war movie, not a Disney Special), the cannonball and grapeshot explosions are entirely unconvincing. No one actually seems to die in the movie; they simply fall down. If it weren't for the fact that I've read a bit about the weaponry used in the Civil War, I wouldn't understand why explosions in the air were causing men on the group to collapse. They should have tried to explain some of these kinds of things.
The actors should not be to blame, mind you; Daniels, Lang, and Robert Duvall all have established careers. Had the directing been better executed and the script wrought with some semblance of thoughtfulness concerning what makes a movie long-standing, I am certain that their roles would have shined. Bad camera angles, awful special effects, a poorly written and poorly thought-out script and lousy editing choices make this a painfully long four hour movie. Just imagine a movie that you really love, now imagine the farthest thing from it; you'll have Gods and Generals. Simply put: avoid this movie like the plague. Don't even waste your time renting it when it comes out. Thucydides of antiquity claimed that the recollection of history be useful. If you want to know more about the Civil War, I can recommend the movies Gettysburg or Glory, or even better read the Shelby Foote trilogy; whatever you do, DON'T watch this movie.

1887597,3,B00009OOFB,"The latest movie epic about the American Civil War is really Part I of a trilogy that started with part II, ""Gettysburg."" As to cinematography goes, this part is very good. However, a more appropriate title could be ""Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson: fearless warrior, Faithful knight."" This is so as this good story totally centers in General Jackson's humanity, religious believes, and glorious deeds. Possibly, that is why the role of Robert E. Lee is very limited and the battles shown are limited to Fredericksburg and only part of Chancellorsville. Of note are the vignettes used to interject some of the non-battle aspects of the War like the feelings of the affected civilian population, and the southern slaves, also the briefly discussed Emancipation Proclamation.
As for the two major battles, Fredericksburg is well depicted and two things surface clearly. The imprudence of General Burnside in sending his troops to attack Lee's well fortified troops, and Lee's mastery in choosing the field and in enticing his enemy to attack. As for the common soldier, the viewer could get the impression that the combatants were Irish fighting Irish.
As for Chancellorsville, the presentation is one sided and limited to Jackson's flanking of the Union's Eleventh Corps. In fact, the Union top commander, Joseph Hooker is mentioned only once. The screenwriters certainly missed a great opportunity to show this battle as the High mark of the Confederate wave. Shining by his absence is General Hooker, no to mention his brilliant pincer movement across the Rappahannock River to flank the Army of Northern Virginia, while General Sedgwick's forces worked from the Confederate Rear trying to force its retreat. By not showing Lee's other two splitting of his outnumbered army, Lee's mastery is surely diminished, his intrepidity is missed, and the Union Army intactness is totally disregarded.
The overall writing appears to have a good amount of partiality towards the cause of the South. Hopefully, Part III gives equal attention to the efforts of both Armies and to the duel between the last great old fashioned General and the first great modern General. Hopefully, there will be a lot more than just the showing of military engagements, but a message as to of the horror of war, the positive results of longsuffering and endurance, valor, honor, discipline, and specially patriotism. Hopefully, the last part will close with Joshua Chamberlains' and the V Corps' noble welcoming of the defeated Army of Northern Virginia represented by Stonewall Jackson's old Corps. If that happens, watching the taking of the oat of allegiance to the Grand Old Flag is likely to revive that old flame of patriotism deemed by apathy and a lost of fundamental values.",1046044800,,2749,5.165919282511211
1887598,5,B00009OOFB,"Thomas Jonathan Jackson is a relative of mine, and Stephen Lang did an outstanding job of bringing him to life. Those blue eyes are critical, but Lang is a also superb actor and nailed the the complex Jackson just right. I don't suppose folks without a keen interest in the Civil War or those battles detailed in Virginia will be much interested in this film. But try to watch it anyway. You will learn something from eye-witness accounts that aren't in most history books. Much of what the author, Jeff Shaara, used to create Jackson in the book was taken from memoirs written by his wife, Mary Anna Morrison Jackson for her daughter Julia and her grandchildren. This is a treat for anyone interested in learning about Thomas J. Jackson the person and not just the general. The emotion and kindness of the man as well as the steely nerves of the general are so well expressed.
In general, the viewer is placed with both sides of the conflict. Is either side right? Is either side wrong? The viewer feels the reasoning and emotions of both North and South, union and secession. Thank you Ron Maxwell for your writing and direction, and thank you Ted Turner for your financial support. Seeing Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee is extra special as he is related to Lee on his mother's side and looks so much like Lee in the film. The continuity of using many the same actors in the same roles they played in ""Gettysburg"" (such as Jeff Daniels, C. Thomas Howell, Patrick Stuart, and Brian Mallon) in key roles in ""Gods and Generals"" is much appreciated, as well. However, since Maxwell decided to concentrate on Jackson, I am thankful that Stephen Lang plays him rather than reprises Pickett! The heart and soul that Lang poured into the role is amazing and very much appreciated. History buffs should appreciate the hard work and painstaking details that went into producing the film. Yes, there will be nitpickers, but it wasn't their money or their writing or their producing that went into creating this work. I hope that those who are not familiar with the the characters and the battles depicted in ""Gods and Generals"" will want to learn more and see the film again and again. You will see something new and learn something new with each viewing. This film should be treasured both as a teaching tool as well as good cinema.",1046044800,3,2324,4.643203883495145

The New York and Los Angeles critics will be offended as they learn that slavery was not why the Civil War was started.  Robert Duval and Jeff Daniels are great, but the real scene stealer is Stephen Lange. Should receive an Osca nomination!  Excellent! The movie is almost four hours long, but it does move fast. The next one, Last Full Measure, should be another exceptional film. I highly recommend this film. It combined with Gettysburg should be used in all US History classes throughout the nation.

1887600,4,B00009OOFB,"After viewing this movie last night, I am again reminded why I question the alleged professional ""critics"", who blasted this film. Is it perhaps because of the politically incorrect subject?
I loved the movie ""Gettysburg"", and went to this one concerned about the negative reviews, but I, and my entire family, found this film touching, dramatic, and engaging.
It moved extremely fast for the extended length of it, and brought my wife to tears at two points. She cried like a baby when the Irish were killing the Irish at Fredricksburg, and of course, at the death of Jackson.
The battle scenes were riveting, more professionally done than even Gettysburg, and kudos for Duvall and Lang for their performances. If the critics are ripping this movie because of its reverence for Jackson, well ....excuse me....to the South, he WAS both ""God and General"". You cannot change the fact that these were men of their time.

1887601,3,B00009OOFB,"I mean no disrespect to the thousands of Civil War re-enactors and enthusiasts who put their all into this movie.  I can tell it was a labor of love.  You will want to see it if you are 'into' the Civil War, but it's not a good movie in any absolute sense.  It had much the same effect on me as if I had seen a sixth-grade history class perform it:  breathtaking in its sincerity but amateurish in its drama.  Let me say why:
The cast: Many of the professionals have become far too long in the tooth for their parts in the 10 years since the filming of `Gettysburg.'  Jeff Daniels, 46, plays Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, age 33.  General Hancock was 37 in the fall of 1861 but Brian Mallon, who plays the part, appears to be at least 10 years older...  Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee is believable but underutilized.  Only Steven Lang as Stonewall Jackson is believable.
Similar casting problems plague the smaller parts and the extras as well. The huge majority of the cast, including speaking parts, appear to be non-professionals.  In scenes in which a group of enraptured adjutants are meant to be listening intently to some general, their eyes wander about the scene as though looking for someone in the audience.  The average age of the typical soldier appears to be 45. White-bearded and paunchy, they are doing their very best to generate the spirit of the age, but their age is a constant reminder that we are only play-acting.  It's not their fault.
The production.  The computer-graphic shots of Fredericksburg, etc. look very fake.  There are several major lapses in continuity:  for example, in one shot, Lee appears to be overlooking Fredericksburg from the Union side of the river.  Ted Turner appears in cameo in one scene seated a bit to the right of Robert E. Lee (Robert Duvall), then in the next shots he is seated behind him.
The script.  No wonder this movie is almost four hours long.  Nothing is said once when there is an opportunity to say it twice or four times if possible (`You are the first brigade!  Repeat ad infinitum).  The borrowed phrase `we who are about to die salute thee' appears twice.
For all that, however, if you are a war buff you will want to see it.  I thought my 8-year-old fanatic would want to leave at the intermission, but he wasn't having it.  Someday someone will make a movie that conveys the weight, drama, and emotion of the American Civil War, but this movie is not it.",1046044800,19,2432,4.5425287356321835
1887602,5,B00009OOFB,"A beautiful and excellent telling of the first half of the War Between the States in the East.  Dr. James I. ""Bud"" Robertson, who was the historical consultant on the film, has said that Stephen Lang should get the academy award for his portrayal of Stonewall Jackson and I agree.  His is a superb performance.  All of the performances are excellent although Robert Duvall as Lee seems a little subdued.  He looks much more Like Lee than does Martin Sheen and certainly has more of his bearing, Sheen being too short and not erect enough.  It is too bad Robert Duvall was not available to portray Lee in in the film ""Gettysburg"".  And Jeff Daniels again does his excellent portrayal of Chamberlain.  But the film really belongs to Stonewall Jackson with a very sympathetic portrayal by Stephen Lang.  In fact, I cannot recall Jackson ever being portrayed in a movie.  This is definitely NOT a boring movie.
Thanks to the reenactment community and the Shaara novels and the labor of love given them by Ronald Maxwell, two films portraying the War between the States as it ought to be portrayed have been produced.  Dr. Robertson has told me the DVD will be over six hours so many of the scenes in the theatrical release should be tied more closely together helping fill in the historical record more completely.  I eagerly anticipate it's release.
There are a few discrepancies in the film such as the first scene showing Lee with his beard and white hair which he did not have at that time but these are for the most part minor inaccuracies so I will not nitpick.  Just as there is no perfect book so there is no perfect movie but Mr. Maxwell's films are by far the best feature films ever done on this subject.  I eagerly anticipate the third film of this trilogy, ""The Last Full Measure"".",1045958400,5,1790,4.591194968553459

Gettysburg was almost realistic except for the tubby bearded guys and the hardcore re-enactors' obsession with the ragged rebel image.  Well, it probably wasn't violent enough, but they really couldn't blow up the hallowed ground, could they?
G&G looks into the minds and manners of nineteenth century Americans in a way that government-school orthodoxy just doesn't countenance.  There are honor, duty, courtliness, literacy, and religion; all strange to Britney Spears and Snoop Dog's world.  For the serious student of the war there are technical errors, but they're mostly minor.  There's a certain amount of political correctness: they changed the words to the first verse of Bonny Blue Flag.  If you noticed it, you read too much or were brought up in the waning days of the old South.

Generally, when a film is so praised in advance of debut I experience a sense of disappointment after I've actually seen it. Gods and Generals was in no way a disappointment. Quite the contrary, I believe it to be one of, if not the best, historical films ever made. Stephen Lang does a masterful job in his interpretation of Gen. Jackson, the central figure in the movie. Robert Duvall's Gen. Lee was memorable. Jeff Daniels made the role of Col. Chamberlain poignant. For a movie of almost 4 hours duration I felt no impatient uneasyness but was thoroughly engrossed in the passions, values and courage of these extraordinary men living their ordinary lives. I found it also remarkable these days to view a war film with virtually no obscenities. These were men of honor and dignity and, without a doubt, Gods and Generals tells their stories with all due respect. I've taken my kids (teenagers) to see it. I will encourage as many as possible to see it. I know I will see it again to remind myself that honor and duty are not just words.",1045958400,5,1097,4.630769230769231
1887605,5,B00009OOFB,"Robert Duvall as General Lee and Stephen Lang as General Jackson were brilliant, fantastic.  As much as any actors can, they not only looked the parts but captured the essence of the men's motivations, piety, compassion, toughness, humanity and military genius.  This movie should be taught in schools to help people better understand the Civil War, why it was fought and the people who fought it.
  Martin Sheen as Robert E. Lee in ""Gettysburg"" was quite simply a ""joke.""  Not only is Sheen not the President, he is not the General, either.
  I would love to see Sheen's parts in ""Gettysburg"" reshot with Duvall as General Lee.  And I look forward to seeing Duvall as Lee in the ""The Last Full Measure.""  (Who should play General Grant?  Not Sheen. General Grant is a person of integrity and courage, too, a true American hero.)

1887606,4,B00009OOFB,"G&G was very much like I expected, a lot of history and some love and other subplots to make it a story and not a documentary; similar to Pearl Harbor or Titanic (Which were ""Love Story' on a ship and in a war. It chronicled the life in the 1860's and what had to be one of the greatest group of Generals known to man, headed by Gen RE Lee, who should be a model for all men.
The acting was weak at times, but the slavery angle of ""I jus wanna be free"" was totally patronizing. ""How can you be fighting for freedom and holding slaves."" The men who were leading this war were sons of slave owners that founded this country....so to base the war on freeing the slaves (which to correct the film, the Emancipation Proclamation only freed the slaves in the Confederacy) is Hollywood speaking.
These men's fathers framed a Constitution that was based on States Rights. They revolted to be freed from a all powerful central government. The States elect a President and a vice President, not the populous. All powers not given to the Federal government is reserved by the States. This is what this War was all about.
What really sturck me as ironic, is that Ted Turner would make a movie which highlighted a group of God-fearing and God-loving leaders. I looked for a ending ridiculing or disparaging such a life. If it was there it escaped me.
Other than some poor acting at times, which I beleived was a result of poor direction, it was a great 3.5 hours. Waiting for the 3rd film. At least Lee did not come out as he did in Gettysburg as a worn out confused person, and the story being written by the accounts of Longstreet.

1887607,1,B00009OOFB,"As a history buff in general, Civil war student in particular, and big fan of Maxwell's ""Gettysburg"", I did not walk, I ran to see this film when it opened. Good God almighty. . .This is a great film if you're Pat Robertson or Jerry Falwell, being that a good third of its running time consists of insufferably pious Southerners rolling their eyes toward Heaven and droning scripture. But in all fairness, the secular speeches are every bit as bloated and boring, as personified by Jeff Daniels' leaden rendering of a particularly thrilling slice of Roman history. The depiction of the fanatical, maniacal Stonewall Jackson--the Confederacy's equivalent to John Brown-- as the Very Soul of Christian Benevolence was grimly laughable. (One of my favorite reviews of the film depicts him as a cross between a Pentacostal preacher and a member of ZZ Top). The film's depictions of slaves makes GONE WITH THE WIND look positively enlightened. There wasn't a shred--not one iota--of humor in this four-hour film, the only thing even resembling a chuckle coming from a Union grunt's offer to trade General Burnside for a lame horse. The acting was straight out of community theater, the screenplay like something Norma Desmond would have written. And where in bloody hell was the film editor?
Perhaps the most unforgivable of Maxwell's transgressions came in the battle scenes. As majestic and sweeping as the battle scenes in GETTYSBURG were, that is how flat and static they are in GODS AND GENERALS. And to completely skip over--to not even MENTION--the battle of Antietam is simply unfathomable. (Yes, I know, it'll be in the director's cut. Oh boy, I can't wait.)
As horrible as I found this film, I'm looking forward to the third part of Maxwell's Civil war trilogy. I hope he learns from the mistakes of GODS AND GENERALS and becomes once again the Ronald F.

They show that southerners were people of thoughful character who saw the federal government's actions as an invasion of their respective country (i.e., each state is their country and not blind loyalty to the monolithic confederacy). It is shown that southerners knew that slavery would end, yet it was their right to decide when and how. Slaves are shown as multi-dimensional people who yearned for freedom, but did not resent or hate the whites. Southern women are shown as people of great strength and character. More than anything, it shows that at the start of the war, the South had the best, most experienced Generals. That the Christian religion helped to build positive character in people.

1887609,3,B00009OOFB,"I went in to this movie with high hopes that Gods and Generals would turn out to be a movie in the same vein as Gettysburg, which I rather enjoyed and in fact turned me into something of a Civil War buff.  Unfortunately, Gods and Generals, while a moderately good film, falls far short of Gettysburg in nearly every respect.
The film focuses on two overlapping subjects - Confederate General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson and his role in the first two years of the American Cival War.
One of the worst problems with the film, for those of us who saw the film Gettysburg, is the casting, which is similar enough to Gettysburg (Jeff Danials, C. Thomas Howell, Brian Malloy, Tim Conway all reprise their roles, as do several other more minor characters) to make it feel like a prequel to the earlier film, but different enough to be distracting.  Many of the major characters from the earlier film are now played by different actors, including Stephen Lang's character from Gettysburg, George Pickett, played by another actor so that Lang could play the more major role of Jackson, James Longstreet now played by Bruce Boxleitner rather than Tom Beringer, and Robert E. Lee by Robert Duval rather than Martin Sheen - in fact, I dare say that despite Sheen's shortcomings as Lee in Gettysburg, his performance outdoes Duval by a considerable margin.
Gettysburg was criticized far and wide for the fake looking beards that were used.  Gods and Generals really does not overcome this flaw - while a few of the actors appear to have actually grown their own beards for this film (Robert Duval and Jeff Daniels in particular), some of the other beards are simply attrocious.  Stephen Lang's Jackson looks as if there is a dark brown Chia Pet growning from his chin, and the first time C. Thomas Howell's Tom Chamberlein appears on screen, we can actually see gaps between the skin of his face and the fake beard - inexcusable(!)
The film's length is as epic as the events it tries to portray.  There is nothing wrong with making a four hour movie if the film is interesting and good for the entire four hours.  Gods and Generals is not - there are a lot of scenes that are either entirely unnecessary or simply unnecessarily long.
The strong points of the film are Jackson and Stephen Lang's portrayal of him, as well as the battle scenes which themselves never quite seem to capture the majesty of the battles in Gettysburg.  Three battles are the focus of the film - First Manassas / the first battle of Bull Run, Fredericksburg and Chancellorville.
At Manassas, where Jackson earns the name Stonewall, we see Jackson's supreme confidence in both himself and God, as he rides his horse unflinching through a hail of bullets and shrapnel.  He maintains discipline over his men and this leads them to victory, even as other Confederate commanders allow impulse to overtake them.
At Fredericksburg, the Federal troops are ordered to make a hopeless attack against a very well defended Confederate position, despite the misgivings of some Federal generals.  The carnage the Federals suffer is astonishingly well captured, as the Confederates pratically set up assembly lines to fire and reload their muskettes at the Federals as they fight behind the protection offerend them by a stone wall at the top of a hill.
At Chancellorville, we again see Jackson's confidence, conviction, and discipline over his men as they stage a silent march and then ambush the Federals.
Unfortunately, the film tends to loose focus in between the battles, spending time on often ineffective character development. While the focus is on Jackson, the film goes off on several tangents in order to temporarily focus on other minor players and bystanders. These tangents are, for the most part, too short to really develop well, but at the same time are too long to not distract from the main plot thread of the film, Jackson.
I think the film suffered from a rather lackluster screenplay.  Whereas Gettysburg followed the novel on which it was based, ""The Killer Angeles"" by Michael Shaara, nearly scene for scene, the film takes a lot more liberty with Jeff Shaara (Michael's son's) ""Gods and Generals"" novel, adding and deleting scenes at will.
In the end, the stronger book lead to the stronger movie.
Also, ""Gods and Generals"" was meant to refer (in Michael Shaara's original book) to the quote that ""there's nothing quite so like a God on earth as a general on a battlefield"".  In this movie, however, the phrase seems to refer more towards the deep religious convictions of many of the players, especially many of the Confederate generals, and their beleif in ""God's will"".",1045958400,2,4644,4.843631778058008
1887610,3,B00009OOFB,"A couple of years back, a spectacular war epic had the Japanese launching a sneak attack on a love triangle and PEARL HARBOR just happened to get caught in the collateral damage. In GODS AND GENERALS, several Civil War battles serve to interrupt the idyllic home life and prayers of Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson.
There's a core of usefulness to this film, which is its reputedly and apparently accurate rendering - such as they are - of the battles of First Bull Run (1861), Fredericksburg (1862) and Chancellorsville (1863). For the historical knowledge to be gained, I would rather that today's young generation watch this than the steady diet of silly, albeit spectacular, fairy tales served up on the Silver Screen. Unfortunately, the combat footage is interspersed with too much overwritten and pretentious dialogue played to the tune of an overly melodramatic soundtrack. And since they're almost carnage-free compared to such recent war epics as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and BAND OF BROTHERS, the battle sequences have been criticized as glossing over the horrors of war. But how else does the studio get the film a PG-13 rating that will allow younger audiences in to see it? To be sure, its 3 hour and 40 minute run time could have been slashed by an hour, at least. GODS AND GENERALS makes GETTYSBURG (1993) seem like a great film in comparison.
Stephen Lang (General Pickett in GETTYSBURG) does a creditable job as the screenwriter's vision of Jackson, though I'm not convinced that this and the ""real"" Stonewall resemble each other. Unfortunately, much of the General's career and reputation was established by his brilliant Shenandoah Valley campaign of early 1862, events outside the scope of this epic. From reading, my impression of Jackson is that he was an austere, aloof, brilliant and eccentric commander who drove his men to the breaking point, and won their devotion in the process. The Jackson played by Lang comes across as almost warm and fuzzy. I don't know which version is more accurate, but this relatively pallid cinematic one isn't what I expected.
Robert Duvall plays General Robert E. Lee in GODS AND GENERALS, and his rendition is much more robust and believable than Martin Sheen's in GETTYSBURG. Jeff Daniels, a little chunkier and nearly a decade older, pretty much reprises the Joshua Chamberlain character of the 20th Maine Regiment, although he occasionally falls victim to windy monologs about the sanctity of the Union and the evils of slavery. In GODS AND GENERALS, unfortunately, there's no Little Round Top to valiantly defend to the last minie ball. The best Chamberlain can do is get pinned down by Confederate fire below Marye's Heights at Fredericksburg
Civil war buffs such as myself will certainly enjoy this film while fidgeting between battles. First Bull Run comes across rather stiff and awkward, but the troops are fully into it by Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. It also helps if the viewer has some pre-knowledge of the battlefields and the locations of the opposing lines because there's too little elucidation provided by the on-screen tacticians. Those who've seen GETTYSBURG will recognize many of the actors who reprise their roles from the earlier sequel.
See GODS AND GENERALS and appreciate it for what it's worth. But don't expect a profoundly moving or satisfying experience.",1045872000,25,3341,5.098540145985401
1887611,5,B00009OOFB,"After viewing the complete film, (I was priviledged to see some of the pre-directors cut footage), I must say - WELL DONE!  The film had depth, multidimensional characters and not the usual love story plot that has been the ""norm"" for the latest historical releases.
Steven Lang WAS ""Stonewall"" Jackson
Kali Rocha as Anna was incredible.
Jeff Daniels is a bit heavier but played Chamberlain to a ""T""
Robert Duvall WAS Robert E. Lee
Senator Robert Byrd's ""Amen"" was quite impressive.  It was also the only add lib part in the entire movie.
Bradley Schmehl was indeed an excellent horseman and filled out Jackson's entourage quite nicely
Ted Turner's cameo was good.
Shawn played Dr. Hunter Mcguire perfectly
Dennis Frye at Fredericksburg?  Nailed his lines perfectly and looked the part.
The remianing actors, far too many for me to list in this review played convincing parts and never seemed to upstage the others in the shot.
Some of the digital effects, such as the far away shot of Fredericksburg and the Union Charge at Marye's Heights were not as sharp as I had wished but impressive none the less.
Harper's Ferry was truly transformed into Fredericksburg, and if you're not from the area you may not even notice.
The soldiers, both Union and Confederate were authentic and had a rugged harsh look to them.  I never noticed watch tan lines or traditional hair cuts.  Dennis Frye did an excellent job in going over the extras to ensure authenticity.
Without going on and on, I will end this with stating that the movie was very energetic, authentic, and kept my attention and that of my wife for the entire play time.  (And my wife is NOT a Civil War buff, more a Civil War Widow.)
This movie is definately a keeper and I look forward to Ron's release of the the ""Directors Cut"" in a few months.  In seeing how  well the movie played out, I can only imagine what the entire movie will look like with the addition of Antietam and the sub plot of John Wilkes Booth.

1887612,5,B00009OOFB,"""Gods and Generals,"" a Ted Turner Films Production, is a four-hour epic that drips with history. From the opening scene of Robert E. Lee refusing Lincoln's offer of command of the entire Union Army, to the final scene of Thomas P. ""Stonewall"" Jackson's death, ""Gods and Generals"" captures not just the history of the titanic struggles on the battlefield, but also captures the character and chivalry of the times these people lived in.
Some may find the dialogue stilted. But such critiques fail to acknowledge that the people of the 19th century chose their words more carefully, and enjoyed simplier pleasures and a slower pace that gave words a more crafted quality.
Writing a letter in 1861 was an all night affair where thoughts were collected over hours, and pen to ink to paper represented as much an act of craftsmanship as it did communication. The movie captures this flavor of the past in rich and vibrant action. And what you witness is the evolution of America from an innocent and guilded age to a stark age of battle and suffering.
The viewer is transistioned from the painful, yet naively optimistic revelry of 1861 to the brutal acceptance of a long and violent war where the stakes of the South are survival or total defeat.
Each battle carries a faithful insight into the unique character of each period. The confusion of myriad uniforms and inexperienced leadership is captured faithfully in the opening battle scenes at First Bull Run creek.
But, the movie also captures the bitter reality of new war. The pandemonium of civilians under seige and barrage at Fredericksburg is presented in real and terrifying action. The destruction of homes and looting by the Zuave troops is a stark reminder that the South considered themselves very much under invasion by a foreign army. These scenes also paint well the painful enlightenment that warfare of the latter 19th century represented a far more painful experience that today is known as total war, but in the day, as a dark harbinger of things yet to come.
The battles of First Bull Run, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville are three carefully crafted lessons of history in action. The power and scope are faithfully reproduced using live scenes interwoven with the latest in computer animations. At times, it is easy to tell the differences, but such visible seams are forgiven because they convey in brilliant moving color such scenes that were before merely presented in oil paintings and faded black and white photography. One appreciates the efforts when he sees the panoramic scenes of Fredericksburg and the pontoon bridges that Ambrose Burnsides foolishly waited on before deploying forces in the town.
Of course, by this point, Lee had massed his forces behind prepared and integrated defensive positions. You may have read the narratives of the stone wall, and the creek, and the advance of Union troops to their slaughter. But, now you get to experience the reality in stark and palpable action. No Civil War film has ever captured the realities of 19th century warfare as well as this film. The scenes are better than those produced in the second installment ""Gettysburg.""
Yes, that is correct. ""Gods and Generals"" is a prequile that starts a three-episode Civil War trilogy produced by Ted Turner films. The second installment ""Gettysburg"" was of course released years ago. The final installment will be ""The Last Measure,"" and this fact was presented in the movie's final credits.
My earnest advice is to put aside your 21st century senses and sensibilities and immerse yourselves into the psyche of the 19th century American. If you do this before entering the theater, you will appreciate the movie as a beautiful glimpse into the history of the American people on the brink of monumental war, and in their efforts to come to grips with the horror of life ruined by modern total war.
Approached with historical appreciation, you will walk away from the four-hour epic with a deeper understanding of the Civil War. This movie fills in the blanks of narrative prose, oil paintings, and still photographs. It brings alive what previously had been merely imaginations devined from the inadequate imagery of the period.
There is one more earnest piece of advice. Perpare to be emotionally challenged. The scenes of family reconciling the pending deaths of their loved ones and trying in vain to preserve the quaint qualities of their ultimately doomed Antebellum life, are heart renderingly presented. This isn't merely an object lesson in the history of war. It's also a real lesson in the realities of lives torn asunder and of dreams of the future destroyed in ash and blood.
And in a particularly poignant scene, you are reminded that not all the peril of the period was found on the battlefield. This scene deserves to remain fresh and unknown, but when you see it, you will be reminded that this is, indeed, a moving painting of life, rendered in stark color, sound, and faith.
Do yourself a favor, spend four hours of your life and immerse yourself into the realities of life in 19th century America at its most challenged time of war. ""Gods and Generals"" is rich and vibrant history.",1045872000,7,5172,4.945977011494253
1887613,3,B00009OOFB,"Gods and Generals tells the story of the first two years of the Civil War leading up to the battle of Gettysburg. Based on the novel by Jeff Shaara, the film shows both sides of the war although overall it is probably tipped more to the south. Stephen Lang, who played General Pickett in Gettysburg, is excellent here as General Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson, the famous Confederate leader. Jeff Daniels returns as Colonel Joshua Chamberlain. His role is not nearly as large as the previous film although his scenes are well played. Robert E. Lee is now portrayed by Robert Duvall rather than Martin Sheen. Duvall is much more believable as Lee than Sheen was.
 Gods and Generals does have its holes but overall it is an excellent picture. The battle scenes are beautifully put together with some computer generated scenes inserted, especially at the battle of Fredericksburg. The surprise attack on the Federal camp at Chancellorsville is one of the best scenes in the whole movie. People who have seen Gettysburg will recognize many faces who return in their roles as well as many returnees who take different parts. Ted Turner makes another appearance as a Confederate colonel during a sing along for the leaders of the Confederate army. Kevin Conway and C. Thomas Howell return as Buster Kilrain and Tom Chamberlain in excellent performances.
 Gods and Generals is an excellent historical epic that keeps the audience interested. A downfall of the movie may be that it tries to do to much. Unlike Gettysburg where only four days had to be covered, Generals has to cover over two years of material leaving some things by the wayside. However the movie is still excellent with great battle scenes, performances and also a good musical score. If you haven't seen it yet go out and rent Gettysburg too.",1045872000,11,1799,4.875816993464053
1887614,5,B00009OOFB,"""Gods and Generals"" is great and very amazing! So much detail and story in a long 3 hours 49 minutes, but it was worth every minute. I am a ""History Crack Addict"" and I give this a movie a hell of a job well done. The movie showed you many view points of the South which made them seem less evil then we learned in history class. This movie showed you many great American soldiers even if they wore gray. The music for this movie was fantastic and the battle scenes were great by showing you different ways how the Civil War was fought. The actors were unbelievable. The American's cause and their way of life were very touching in this movie. ""Gettysburg"" was excellent and now ""Gods and Generals"" has joined it to share and take on an excellence of its own. Some new faces in the movie, they did splendid including Robert Duvall. And many returning who that once again have done a job well done. So when does this flick come out on DVD?",1045872000,2,938,4.305084745762712
1887615,3,B00009OOFB,"The very first time I saw this film in the theatre, I came home extremely disappointed in it for what I felt was its being an overly mawkish paean to the Southern ""Lost Cause"". After all, it had been financed by none other than Ted Turner, Atlanta native and known Southern sympathiser. I was totally turned off by the overt religiosity of the film, especially the scene where Stonewall Jackson and his slave pray together. Oh, puh-LEEZ. That seemed just way too over the top for my druthers, and it was just one of a long list of problems that I had with this film's emphasis on the South and the Southern viewpoint.

Then I saw it again at home on video. I tried putting my personal biases aside and just enjoying the story for what it was, a biographical film of Stonewall Jackson, something that had never really been explored before. When I saw the film originally, I fully expected it to be, like the book, devoted to the main four characters: Hancock, Chamberlain, Lee and Jackson, but the other three characters got minimal screen time compared to Jackson, and that really upset me a lot. I had remembered how in the film ""Gettysburg"", equal attention was paid to both sides of the conflict, so that it felt as if we were going back and forth to either side of the battlefield and watching events unfold from both viewpoints. This film gave but mere lip service to nearly every character except Stonewall and I felt that was a problem for me.

Then I realised that what had me so out of sorts over the film was, in fact, my own strong personal bias against the Southern cause. I was born and raised a Northerner and was taught in school that we were right, they were wrong. And therein lay the problem for me - how to get past the very thing that tore this country apart 140 years ago and watch the film with unbiased eyes. It's hard, but once you do, you can come to appreciate the study of the personage of Stonewall Jackson, played to the hilt by Stephen Lang, whose blue eyes shone with the battle madness that often gripped Stonewall when his forces were engaged. We last saw this actor in the flowery role of George Pickett in Gettysburg, complete with perfumed ringlets. To go from that to the dour Stonewall, I felt, was a real leap, and Lang accomplished it beautifully.

Sadly, we scarcely ever get to see the other characters. Robert Duvall's masterful Robert E. Lee gets all of about 15 minutes screen time, the single best film Lee I have ever seen. The resemblance is uncanny. (I understand he's related to Lee in some way, too.) Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, reprised by actor Jeff Daniels, looks heavier and older than he should in this role and somehow lacks the passion he poured into the role in his earlier portrayal in ""Gettysburg"". He's downright wooden in this film compared to his previous performance. I wonder if some part of him did not wish to revisit this role.

Still, every time I see this movie, my reaction varies. It still drips with a bit too much mawkishness, but then, I also forget that the way people spoke and talked back then was very different from how we think and speak now. If director Ron Maxwell has established a reputation for anything, it's devotion to historical authenticity, and this film is no exception. I have to put aside my modern eye and ear and remember that people were different back then. One has but to read the letters, diaries and journals kept by people back then to realise this fact. I still have to work hard to overcome my feelings that this film laments the ""Lost Cause"" that so many of the as yet ""unreconstructed"" southerners seem to mourn. There are parts of the South where, when you speak to people, it's as if the Civil War happened yesterday. In fact, don't dare call it the ""Civil War"" in certain parts of the south. It's known there as ""The War of Northern Aggression"" or ""The War Between the States"", and they'll tell you ""there wasn't anything civil about it!""

I suppose I will always have mixed reactions to this movie. A friend who was the re-enactor liaison for this film told me that there were such poor relations between the film crew and the re-enactors that none of the re-enactors will ever want to do another Civil War film again for certain people, and this film lost so much money at the box office that the making of the final film in the trilogy, ""The Last Full Measure"", is certain to be forever doomed, as Ted Turner has pulled the plug on financing it. That's a shame, because I had so looked forward to the entire trilogy of books becoming movies, as the final chapter is perhaps the most dramatic of all. The years as the war ground down and it became more of a war of attrition were some of the most bloody, awful and dramatic as the war reached its denouement. Sadly, we will never get to see that final chapter filmed.

Watch this film several times before reaching a judgement on it. I still watch it from time to time and react differently every time. I suppose it just depends on my mood at the moment. Not the greatest Civil War film ever - that honour belongs to the movie ""Glory"". But this one deserves several watchings, at least.",1045872000,,5150,4.496794871794871
1887616,3,B00009OOFB,"The events in ""Gods and Generals"" take place before those in ""Gettysburg,"" but this first film in the Shaara Civil War trilogy was made ten years after the 1993 epic.  Consequently it is a bit discordant for the audience to see some actors a decade older playing younger versions of the same characters, while other familiar characters have new actors in the roles, and one original actor is not playing a different role.
Some of the flaws of ""Gods and Generals"" are inherent to not only the film but the Jeff Shaara novel as well.  Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning novel ""The Killer Angels"" told the story of the Battle of Gettysburg from the perspective of a handful of key historical figures.  It was as much a psychological profile of John Buford, Robert E. Lee, James Longstreet, and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain as it was a historical account of the battle (as the latter the film had major gaps, reducing the events of the second day to the pivotal assault on Little Round Top).  ""Gods and Generals"" does not cover four days but rather a period of over two years, during which it focuses on three major battles: (First) Manassas, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville.
The film might begin with Robert E. Lee's decision not to accept command of the Federal armies, but the main character is clearly Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson, especially since the film ends with his death.  The high point of ""Gods and Generals"" becomes the Battle of Fredericksburg, mainly because it is the only one of the three battles that is explained to the lay audience (I know about what Jackson did at First Manassas and at Chancellorsville, but the average audience member is not going to have a clue).  In that battle, it is the charge of the Union Irish Brigade from New York, going up against a Confederate unit of their fellow Irishmen entrenched behind the stonewall, that provides the most emotional moment in the film.  But this appex comes before the intermission.
Yes, there is an intermission, which surprised several audience members at the first showing yesterday; jaws dropped when I informed them this movie was 3 hours and 49 minutes long.  My complaint is not that the film is that long, but rather that the film only rarely engages the audience over that long period of time.
Writer-director Ronald Maxwell has made a big effort to make ""Gods and Generals"" different from ""Gettysburg.""  The effective opening of the latter, where the actors morph into the historic figures they play, and the afterward update of what happened to these characters (lifted from the novel), are both gone.  The psychological dimension of hearing the character's thoughts are omitted (except for the ironic echoes of earlier words).  In ""Gettysburg"" the use of music was superb, and has turned up in dozens of trailers as well as the broadcast coverage of the Olympics.  But in ""Gods and Generals"" the music of Randy Edelman and John Frizzell constantly overwhelms the images and gives us not a sense of heroism but rather one of sacred sacrifice (the angelic voices are overdone as well).  The exception that proves the rule are the almost cameo like appearances of many of the characters/actors from ""Gettysburg"" (Oh, look, there is Ted Turner again).  When we have different actors playing Generals Armistead and Pickett having a conversation foreshadowing Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg, it was just way too forced.
Robert Duvall is one of the greatest actors of his generation and he certainly looks the part of Robert E. Lee, but there is too much of a twinkle in his eye and a slight smile upon his lips to read true for me.  Stephen Lang has the major role as Jackson, who is reduced to the paradox of a devout religious man whose solution to the Northern invasion is to kill all of them.  Jeff Daniels is the principle actor from the previous film to return, but then he is playing Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, the Civil War hero who was effectively rediscovered by the Shaara novels and the Ken Burns PBS documentary.  Even given the literary impulses of the age, it did seem over the top when Chamberlain launches into a lengthy quotation of a Latin poet historian regarding Caesar crossing the Rubicon as the 20th Maine prepares to be the third assault on Marye's Heights overlooking Fredericksburg.  But then Chamberlain spends the next two nights huddled behind a barricade of Union corpses, and the irony between the beginning and the ending of the charge certain captures the death of the illusion of war's grandeur.
""Gods and Generals"" succeeds when Maxwell is choreographing his battle sequences, even if we rarely provided with a clear understanding of what is happening in terms of strategy and tactics.  Where it fails is in making the characters and the issues of the day seem real, the way they did in ""Gettysburg.""  The slavery issue is treated in such a fashion, with Jackson having a conversation on God's will with his black cook (Frankie Faison) and the loyalty of a slave woman (Donzaleigh Abernathy) who still years for freedom, that is just not believable.  ""Gettysburg"" casts an imposing shadow over ""Gods and Generals,"" and those who have watch the films in chronological order in terms of history rather than production will undoubtedly enjoy the overall experience more because those of us who admired the other film are constantly taken out of ""Gods and Generals"" by noting that Buster Kilrain (Kevin Conway), Tom Chamberlain (C. Thomas Howell), General Kemper (Royce D. Applegate) and several others have virtually nothing to do in this film.
The bottom line lesson here is that if you thought making a successful sequel was nearly impossible, the odds are stacked even more against making a great prequel.",1045872000,10,5728,4.902792140641158
1887617,5,B00009OOFB,"This is easily the best movie about the Civil War ever made, better by far than even its predecessor, Gettysburg.  It is a beautifully filmed movie, full of action and life, characters and costumes, unlike G-burg, which often appeared like a bunch of re-enactors running around a field for a weekend, which is what that movie essentially was.  That having been said, it is a looooong, convoluted, and not terribly coherent movie which led some people in the theater to walk out (not me!).  If you understand the history behind it, it makes much more sense, but the movie really does not go out of its way to explain things  too well.  It also has too many characters, which is OK because the Civil War had millions of characters and nobody seems to mind that too much.  Some reviewers have complained that the movie is too pro-Southern, and that Stonewall Jackson is too saint-like, and that may be true to a certain extent, but I think that everybody involved went out of their way to balance things and make the movie historically accurate.  Gods and Generals is certainly not as biased as Gone With the Wind, and nobody has ever said GWtW was not a great movie.",1045872000,4,1164,4.594202898550725
1887618,4,B00009OOFB,"This is a movie custom-made for Civil War buffs. Someone headed out for a quick hour & a half of fluff is not going to want to choose this one!
It is long, with large snatches of preachy dialogue. It also totally dismisses large areas of the war: the Penninsula campaign, Second Manassas, and (very surprisingly) Antietam. Just as surprisingly, it pretty much drops any reference to Jackson's Valley campaign. This is a bit much, seeing as Jackson is THE major character in the film. But I suspect that the producers, having such a LARGE canvas to paint, had to make some choices, or the movie would be eight hours long instead of almost four!
The acting: sometimes it can be a bit stiff, to be sure, but it was engaging. Robert Duvall? Let's be honest, how can you go wrong! He did a very fine job as Robert E. Lee. Stephen Lang as Jackson? I was less than optimistic here, seeing as Lang had already played Pickett in 'Gettysburg'. I'll tell you, though - he nailed it. Jackson was, to say the least, a peculiar individual, and Lang carries that very well, while keeping Jackson human and believable. Jeff Daniels is always good, and his Chamberlain is as good as he was in the last film.
Some of the supporting parts were well done, also. Brian Mallon will forever be Hancock; he really shows the man's tenacity and strength. Matt Letscher was a surprise - his Ames was very well-done. You're not going, 'Oh, yeah - the guy from 'Good Morning, Miami!' A very memorable moment in the film, when he turns with an exasperated, 'WHAT?!' at the Stone Wall - to find one of his soldiers with an arm blown off, asking permission to retire from the field.
They take some liberties with history: the reference to lemons with Jackson (What? No reference to black pepper and his leg?), the historical timing of some of the statements characters make, etc. All in all, though, a fine effort - I disagree with some of the film critics out there, who are riding this movie into the ground. If you know the basics about the Civil War, you'll be better served - it DOES cut back and forth, place to place, character to character. But again, it's a very ambitious project here! And even if you don't know, you'll at least be able to follow Jackson's story well enough. If you DON'T know anything about the period, you'll be surprised by HIS story arc! And it's true!
One last comment: the score. First, I'm a soundtrack hound, so, yes, I picked it up before the movie came out. It's beautiful, well-done, a very fine companion to the film. It does nothing but add to the film as a whole. Actually, it's playing right now as I write this ('Too Much Sugar', at the moment!)
A good, solid movie about a very important part of US history.",1045872000,,2720,4.485887096774194
1887619,4,B00009OOFB,"First off, let me start with the NEVERS...
1. Never make a ""prequel"" 10 years after the ""sequel"" and try to use the same actors.
2. Never make a ""prequel"" after a well loved sequel without using the same actors.
3. Never EVER make a CW movie without Stephen Lang.
Now that that's out of the way- definately see this movie if you have any interest at all in US history, romance, faith, big guns or epic stories. While it may seem stilted and badly done to certain peawhit reviewers (who most likely never read the book) this film accurately portrayed the book ""Gods and Generals"" Ron Maxwell has done it yet again- pulling together a Cecil B. DeMille cast of thousands and melding them into a great movie.
Casting Stephen Lang as Jackson was indeed a coup. There are those who would argue that since Pickett was in this movie as well as Gettysburg, that he should have stayed in that role. However, his talents would have been wasted. Plus, it was neat to see Billy Campbell again on the big screen.
My only real disappointment was the casting of Bruce Boxleitner (forgive the spelling) as Longstreet. While I do like him very much as an actor, I just don't think he had the brooding darkness that Longstreet possesed and Tom Berenger so ably portrayed in ""Gettysburg.""
It was interesting to see actors reprise their roles 10 years later. A little more grey here, a few more pounds there, a few less in some cases. I imagine though, if you haven't seen ""Gettysburg"" a hundred times it won't make much of a difference.
Bottom line- go see this movie. It doesn't deserve the lousy ""professional"" reviews, and it doesn't deserve a quick box office death.",1045872000,2,1650,4.577702702702703
1887620,4,B00009OOFB,"""Gods and Generals"" could have used some tighter editing, just as many of the professional and online reviewers say. But some of their more hostile comments tell more about the reviewers than about the picture. World magazine writer Gene Edward Veith gigged them nicely with this mock content advisory:
""Warning! This movie contains explicit Bible reading. Scenes contain graphic depictions of prayer. The language may not be suitable for viewers offended by nonprofane references to Jesus. Viewers are strongly cautioned due to intense moralizing, violently affectionate marriages, and gratuitous displays of selfless behavior.""
It's hard to portray piety well on-screen, and Hollywood these days scarcely ever tries to do so. But Stephen Lang pulls it off. His Jackson is stern, warm, charismatic and convincing. I had long imagined a film about Stonewall, and this is almost all I could have desired.
I had envisioned Ed Harris in the role, as he bears a strong resemblance to Jackson, but I don't think Harris could have outdone Lang or even equalled him. If you doubt Lang's acting chops, just watch him play Pickett in ""Gettysburg."" What a contrast to Lang's Jackson! Each portrayal has a life of its own. Lang's performance outdoes even the great Robert Duvall, who here and there lets the hint of a ""Lonesome Dove"" mannerism slip into his portrayal of Lee.
""Gods and Generals"" is especially welcome in that it contains none of the puerile nonsense that spoiled the recent would-be epics ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""The Patriot."" Plodding it may be, but it should at least get credit for its maturity.
Here's what I missed in ""Gods and Generals"" and hope to see in the 6-hour DVD:
* Some sense of how Jackson and Lee earned their immense reputations, in the Valley and Peninsula campaigns and at Second Manassas.
* Some more attention to the Federal commanders, who were the tragicomic foils for Lee's and Jackson's brilliance. In the movie, that parade of bunglers and blowhards is represented only by Burnside. I understand the DVD will include Antietam, so we may meet McClellan there, but I want to see Pope and Hooker huff, puff and fall on their faces, too.
* Speaking of bunglers and blowhards, a hard look at the secessionist firebrands who brought the war on might have mollified those critics who found the Southern cause way too idealized in this picture. Especially on the issue of slavery and race, a contrast could have been drawn between Jackson and someone like Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, who prattled about the ""great truth"" of white superiority. The South's bigotry resided in its politicians, not in men like Jackson. (One critic doubted that Jackson would ever have called the free black cook he hired ""Mr. Lewis,"" as he does in the movie. But ""Tom Fool"" Jackson was known in pre-war Lexington for tipping his hat to black men on the street. Said he: ""I could not be less polite to a Negro than he is to me."")
I look forward eagerly to seeing the conclusion of Mr. Maxwell's Civil War trilogy. In the role of U.S. Grant, the Union general who finally took Lee's measure, I'd suggest Russell Crowe. Like Grant, Crowe looks a bit surly, ""as if he were about to drive his forehead through a brick wall.""
And if Crowe isn't available, just call on Lang again. Embodying Jackson, Pickett AND Grant --- now, THAT would be an acting trifecta!",1045872000,39,3374,4.879790940766551
1887621,5,B00009OOFB,"Gods and Generals was wonderful in that it depicted the civilians and women encompassing the men in blue and grey.

The film succeeded in showing the emotions behind the uniform and for that depiction I applaud!",1045785600,2,286,5.1063829787234045
1887622,1,B00009OOFB,"I am bit amazed to see all these positive reviews of this film. I wondered if they saw the same movie as I did? Although I am a Civil War fanatic, I found the movie to be totally boring. It was an effort to stay awake. I thought the movie should have been titled ""Stonewall Jackson"" or something like that since most of the movie centered around this general. Stephen Lang who played Jackson, however, proves to be quite [inadequate]. Whether this was due to cutting room floor or the script, I am not sure but historically, Jackson was one of the most bizzare and eccentric characters of the war. This made him very controversial but there is none of this in the movie. Lang's protaryal of Jackson almost make him very normal and that was one thing Jackson never was. The film was definitely pro-south in outlook but there is nothing wrong with that. However, the speeches made in this film does make the southerners sound very pompous. Civilian scenes proves to be a total waste of time because they are cut-scenes with two diminsional characters with little or no depth. These scenes add to the boredom to the film. It was nice for the director to put in couple of black characters in the movie, if you like your black characters to be ""Uncle Tom"" type. The combat scenes was pretty limited. Only three battles were shown in the movie, First Manasas, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. Of the three, Fredericksburg was the showcase battle of the movie - and this was the most boring of Civil War battles. One of the battle scenes of Fredericksburg involves the role of the Irish, where the southern Irish were condeming the northern Irish. Funny that northern Irish serving in Union armies outnumbered the southern Irish in Confederate armies by what -- 7-1 or 6-1 during the war. Actually it was the southern Irish who were out of line with mainstream Irishmen in Civil War. (Beside, why should these southern Irish be shock? After all, Irish Brigade of the Army of Potomac played an important parts in other battles prior to Fredericksburg and found fame because of it. Not to say that while there were few Irish regiments in the south, there were several Irish brigades in the north!...) The other two battles were only touch lightly and centered around Jackson's role. Northern view point in this movie proves to be rather limited. So limited that it would be better if it wasn't presented at all. Jeff Daniels definitely looked older and fatter then his slim tirm fighting mode of ten years ago. Northern dialogue sound so much somber and reflective compared to the southern speeches although the film could have done without Daniels' Caesar speech. It took three and half hours to do justice to three days of Gettysburg. The same time cannot do justice to two years of the Civil War. This effort only cheapen the story and the characters. Worst, putting in the dull civilian scenes slow the movie down considerably and add nothing in return. This is the worst kind of history movies, a kind of movie that put a superifical light and pretend to convey what it cannot deliever. Only a hard core Civil War reader can sit through this movie without losing perception or understanding of what the filmmakers are trying to do. A casual movie goer will probably be lost and bore to tears by all the cross-cutting of [inadequate] slitted scenes and stories. (PS: For the nitpickers: Lee in 1861 didn't have gray hair or beard.)",1045785600,3,3430,4.708818635607321
1887623,5,B00009OOFB,"""Gods and Generals,"" the greatest novel ever written about the American Civil War, now becomes the movie event of the year. Director Ron Maxwell (""Gettysburg"") is able to tell the stories of the personal lives of the men AND the history of the events with a great balance. Stephen Lang IS ""Stonewall"" Jackson, in my opinion. And Robert Duvall's portrayal of Robert E. Lee single-handedly overshadows Martin Sheen's performance, even though Lee is featured much less in this one. Jeff Daniel's return as Chamberlain is awesome, especially as he quotes ""Julius Caesar"" as regiment-after-regiment marches over the pontoon bridges at Fredericksburg. True, he has gained a little weight, but this is the only shortcoming.
As for the length, the 215 Minutes pass by with a breeze. The battle scenes are grand and well-done. The recreations of First Manassas and Chancellorsville are great, but the recreation of Fredericksburg is, in my opinion, the best Civil War battle scene ever committed to film, complete with some fine visual effects.
The only problem people may have with the film is that it does jump around some, especially when the film jumps from July of 1861 to April of 1862, then jumps from April to December, 1862. This may confuse some people who never study history. However, I'm pretty sure that this shortcoming will be fixed when the six-hour ""Director's Cut"" rolls out on DVD later this year.
Overall, a masterpiece. And if you think this is good, wait for the six hour cut! It'll be even more incredible. Grade: A+",1045785600,10,1531,4.961089494163424
