3645556,5,B001HZ4K6W,"Shiva Rea's Creative Core And Upper Body features the Agni Namaskar including the 108 prostration push ups.

Until this DVD, the only way to experience this Namaskar was to train with Shiva live.

Now, everyone can experience the power of Agni in their own lives.

The DVD is beautifully filmed.

The instructions (and modifications) are clear.

I was not able to complete the Namaskar without modifications the first time I tried.

But now, it rocks.

This is a great DVD and belongs in your yoga collection.

Now, I have to buy another copy to travel with.

Get this.

Namaste.",1231459200,5,579,4.757575757575758
3645557,5,B001HZ4K6W,"When I first saw the preview where she says there are going to be 108 pushups I thought she was crazy! but then I discovered it is broken up into 9 sets of 12 within the ""Agni Namaskar"" (fire salutation) the first 24 minute segment which is based on the traditional B salutation structure but with different variations of hero/crescent lunge and chair pose every round (with twists or with hands clasped behind the back) and different backbends (from cobra to bow) and of course 12 pushups instead of the usual one! that was quite challenging and I couldn't finish 12 pushups in the last 3 sets because my upper body was quivering and fatigued but after every push up set you do get some rest with a counter pose stretch. The music is also great on this DVD , there's no drums this time and I recognized 2 songs from ""Yoga Trance Dance"" .The second segment ""Creative Core"" (8 min) is different than the one on the lower body DVD , it is a nice mix of yogic ab exercises like bicycle with bent and straight legs (similar to the core abs segment on Yoga Shakti) and more creative and free form exercises similar to the original creative core abs DVD. I definitely felt it my core and my upper body ,although it is not a complete upper body training , it is a fun yoga workout and another great addition to my Shiva Rea and Yoga collection.",1230076800,28,1337,4.373493975903615

3645574,4,B001HZ4K6W,"I chose this DVD since I wanted a video that I could do on days that I cannot make it to pilates which is my strength training mode of choice. I do yoga regularly but more for flexibility than strength building. I was prepared for all of the push-up after reading a couple of reviews. I am not going to lie. It is hard work. I did a similar exercise in a class on arm balances in order to build upper body strength. If I can get to the point where I can do all of them without dropping to my knees, I am sure I will be pretty strong. I was less happy with the core section. I am not sure that I like Shiva Rea's form of yoga since it is pretty hippy dippy (a lot of talking about inner power) but it is pretty difficult.

3645577,5,B001HZ4K6W,"This yoga flow consists of an upper body workout (alternating sets of regular style push-ups and short vinyasas), followed by a core segment & shivasana.  The push-ups are performed in nine sets of 12 reps, but Shiva encourages you to modify on your knees and/or simply do as many reps as you are comfortable with.  I prefer not to do the same exercise repeatedly, so I swap in push-up variations such as yoga (arms close to ribs), decline, wide hands, hands on upside down bosu...  The upper body segment is very challenging, moving quickly from push-ups to stretches & yoga poses - no time to flop on the floor & rest unless you hit pause.  I can hang for the 108, but I make some decidedly un-yogic utterances and come away from the breath several times in the process - whilst Shiva cranks out push-ups with a serene expression on her face.  But that's part of the fun!  The core segment is do-able and I am always thankful to collapse into shavasana at the end.  One thing to note is Shiva starts in with the push-ups fairly quickly - so if you're doing this first thing in the morning, (as am I) you might want to warm up with some arm circles, etc. before you hit play.",1358812800,4,1176,4.391705069124424

3645592,5,B001HZ4K6W,"I've been practicing yoga for about a year, but I am having trouble improving and moving on to more advanced poses because I lack upper body (or arm) strength. I have twig arms. Anyway, I got this dvd to work on that. For a 35 minute workout, which is a perfect length for a quick yoga practice, I feel like my arms are actually getting stronger.  I can't do as many push ups as Shiva (the woman is a MACHINE), but maybe someday. This is my first Shiva dvd, and I liked her voice and style of yoga. It may not be good for first timers, but it definitely isn't too difficult, as long as you don't beat up on yourself for being as perfect as Shiva.  The 9 sets of 12 pushups lasts about 25 min, and then there is a good core workout that lasts about 8 min, followed by a 2 min savasana.

3645594,5,B001HZ4K6W,"I have been doing yoga on and off for several years and really enjoy it.  Recently I discovered the joy of going regularly to an actual yoga class instead of doing a DVD at home.  I'll have to admit, it has spoiled me alot.  i got a Rodney Yee DVD (Power Yoga for Total Body) for this period during which my favorite yoga teacher is on pregnancy/maternity leave and found myself somewhat bored.  I mean, it's a good workout and very much back to ""basics"" but i missed the variety and creative moves I had become accustomed to.
So, i sought out Shiva Rea videos because I've heard she's very dynamic.  And that's completely true.  Unfortunately, some of her other videos are a little too dynamic for me, like the Trance Dance stuff.  However, this video was spot on and I really, really like the matrix system on her DVD's.  This DVD and her Daily Energy Vinyasa Flow DVD are going to be used often.  Once again, I love the matrix system.  i can't say it enough.  It's so obvious, I find myself wondering why all workout DVD's don't have it.

One note about the ""Creative Core"" section.  It's wild.  You basically lay on your back and do all sorts of ""free"" movements with your shoulders and legs up off the ground.  Some of it is a patterned movement but then she just tells you to let go and follow your own body while she does all sorts of spontaneous and mixed movements.  Personally, I don't mind it.  It's a great time to discover your own strength & flexibility.  We often had ""creative periods"" during my yoga class while doing shoulder stands.  I like them.
I'm not sure I really want to give it a 5 star rating because I would like stronger poses, but when I compare it to numerous other yoga videos, 4 stars isn't quite enough.",1302393600,3,1737,4.38871473354232
3645595,5,B001HZ4K6W,"I purchased this in November 2009, but just now (August 2010) got around to using it.  I was so intrigued by the idea of doing 108 toe pushups when I first spotted this DVD, but I decided to start with the agni namaskar on her Surf Yoga Soul DVD first because the workout on that DVD was shorter and I wanted to really focus on the pushups.  I worked my way up from 3 sets of 8 toe pushups (stopping the DVD when I couldn't do any more as I had decided I didn't want to do modified knee pushups) to the full 9 sets of 12 full toe pushups over several weeks and decided it was time to try this DVD.

The agni namaskar on this DVD is about 7-8 minutes longer than the one on Surf Yoga Soul and has a little more variety for backbends and some of the standing poses.  It also moves at a little slower pace.  I liked the variety and since I've continued to do Shiva's pushups once a week having this as another option will be good.  The scenery was very nice.  I also liked the inclusion of her Core work as a nice add on.

Pushups have been one of the most rewarding exercises I've ever done as far as upper body, core, lower back strength.  I have carpel tunnel but the pushups have never bothered it.  I do stretch my wrists after.  I have hip dysplasia as well and the pushups have really helped it as well.

I don't think that you need a lot of yoga specific experience to do this DVD (pushups are not exclusive to yoga), but don't think it would make a good choice for a beginner to exercise.  It is much more appropriate at an intermediate level.",1283385600,7,1549,4.089403973509934
3645596,4,B001HZ4K6W,This is almost like Power Yoga. It is not for relaxing but it is stress relieving as you get to sweat it. She pushes you and I did my upper body muscles all worked up after this DVD. I love it when I want a great workout without machines.,1274918400,,238,3.877551020408163
3645597,2,B001HZ4K6W,"Just tried once; the endless press-ups are boring and killed my shoulders or arms, don't know which. Don't want to do it again. I have two other very good yoga DVDs so don't have time for this one.

They are: Spirit of Vinyasa Flow with Deb Dobbin. I like it. Just like it.

Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders Body Slimming Yoga - I like this one even more as easy to do. Very good after a hike or when I want relaxation, strength or even to lose weight.",1272240000,2,447,4.186046511627907
3645598,4,B001HZ4K6W,"I'm a total Shiva fan.  My first every yoga DVD was Shakti, & that did it for me.  I refuse to look at another yoga instructor's DVD.  I took off 1 star for this one b/c it's too short - not good value for the money.  I use it together with the Core + Lower Body DVD to give myself a longer workout.  I can't do a single push up, but hopefully one day I will build up to it. :-)  I'm not too fond of the forest/mountain backdrop on this one cause I'm more of a beach/sand person.  But Shiva's beauty makes the background tolerable.",1270944000,,531,3.952830188679245
3645599,5,B001HZ4K6W,"I have about 30 exercise DVDs, but this one is one of my favorites. Push-ups are one of the best exercises you can do, and breaking the sets up the way that's done in the DVD, makes it much easier. I was wearing a tank top a few months back and everyone commented on how great my arms looked. Do a lot of different exercises, but I attributed the bulk of my success to this DVD.

The core segment is pretty good too. My abs hurt after the first couple of times doing it. It's hard to find a good ab workout.

I only have one complaint. The breathing. I can't believe no one else has said anything about it. I don't know how anyone can breathe that slowly. I don't have any problems with any of my other yoga DVDs. I breathe almost twice as fast as her cue's I'd say. I just ignore her and go at my own pace, but it's kinda distracting.",1256342400,4,835,4.024096385542169
3645600,5,B001HZ4K6W,"Although this DVD is focused on the upper-body strength it is still very well balanced incorporating forward bends, twists and backbends that increase in intensity as the practice continues.  The practice starts with a short warm-up before beginning agni namaskar.  Basically there are three main rounds.

ROUND 1:  consists of three sets of up to 12 push-ups totalling up to 36.  In between each set of 12 push-ups in round one you incorporate cobra pose, an option upward dog, downward facing dog, warrior one holding the legs still while raising the arms overhead on the in-breath and lowering the arms with the out-breath.

ROUND 2: consists again of three sets of up to 12 push-ups totalling up to 36.  In between each set of 12 push-ups in round one the intensity of the backbend is increased from round 1, substituting salabasana for cobra.  You practice the backbend three times between each set of push-ups.  Again in round 1 you have the optional upward dog, and then move to downward dog.  This round you move to warrior one and clasp the hands behind your back.  Lift your chest on the inhale, keeping warrior 1 legs bending the crown of the head to the inside of the front foot on the exhale.  You move with the breath 2 or three times.  This is done between each set of push-ups.

ROUND 3:  consists again of three sets of up to 12 push-ups totalling up to 36.  The intensity is increased this time.  Before moving into the push-ups you take twisted chair pose to each side.  In between each set of push-ups you move into warrior 1, then high lunge with twist.  The backbend intensity is again increased as you now are doing bow pose (danurasana) instead of salabasana.  The first time you do bow pose you focus on tilting back and lifting the chest, second time tilting forward lifting the legs.  The third time you lift everything.

After the three rounds are completed you move into the core section.  This core section is short but I definitely feel like I have ignited a fire in my belly.  Shiva consistently reminds you to engage uddiyana bandha lying on your back.  I have to take some breaks throughout as I cannot hold it as long as Shiva does.  I love this core practice as you are encouraged to bring some creative flow to the practice towards the end.  She also gives options such as bending the knees or not holding shoulders off the ground the entire time, or supporting the head with one hand while the other arm reaches out.

Even though this is a short practice, I really feel like it is a complete practice.  Even though you do some push-ups, it feels like a yoga practice and not a ""work out"" per se.  Every time I complete this workout I feel strong all day and tell myself that I need to do it more often.  Shiva also includes this 'agni namaskar' sequence on her surf sould DVD and her new daily energy DVD, however this DVD has the longest most complete version of it.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1255046400,16,2935,4.520912547528517
3645602,5,B001HZ4K6W,"I own all three of Shiva's Core dvd's and I love them all for different reasons. This one is my favorite, however, because my upper body does need more strengthening and Shiva is so strong that she is by far my favorite teacher thus far for upper body. The wording of ""Creative Core"" really does fit. This isn't your average doing crunches and regular, boring ab routines, this is interactive, and it moves along quite quickly! As with her other core routines, I combine this after I go running or with other Yoga DVD's (usually the upper body with a Kundalini set). Doing this DVD by itself is definitely not enough!",1254960000,,617,4.5675675675675675
3645603,5,B001HZ4K6W,"I love this DVD!!  It's short, but it gets the job done!!

As others have mentioned, this DVD features ""Agni Namaskar"", which is Fire Salutation.  You will move through a sun salutation- like sequence with 108 prostration push-ups.  There are 9 sets of 12 push-ups, which makes it very doable.  You can either do them traditional style, or with bent knees.  Building your strength and endurance each time you do this practice.
I do this Agni Namaskar about once a week, and I am so much stronger.  I am also seeing more muscle definition in my arms.  This increased strength and stamina is helping my yoga practice in more ways than I would have expected.
The core work is good too, but nothing too spectacular.
It's the Agni Namaskar that you want this DVD for!!!  :)",1248220800,,768,4.588235294117647
3645604,4,B001HZ4K6W,"Although the workout is very good, I have a problem with the way the dvd is being advertised. First off, it is DEFINITELY NOT FOR BEGINNERS. There is no warm up period to speak of and this isn't proper form no matter what the level of the practitioner. Secondly, the asanas (poses) are intermediate level at least. I can see where a person new to yoga could become very discouraged (or worse, hurt) viewing and then trying this workout. I like Shiva Rea and believe she does wonderful work, yet I am surprised that she would allow this dvd to be marketed as is. Otherwise, it is an excellent series of dynamic moves that delivers on it's promise of strengthing the core and upper body.",1244764800,,685,4.488
3645605,4,B001HZ4K6W,"Although the first section (agni) was focused on 109 fustration push ups, the stretching and other poses in between sets of 12 push ups were just enough to allow for recovery.  Normally, 109 of them would seem completely unattainable to me... yet with this format I was able to do it.  I am feeling it today!  The core portion was good. Shiva allows for lots of time to flow and move arms and legs while pulling the pelvis and shoulders up, I personally would have prefered more instruction or specific poses or flow sequences.  Nonetheless, I do feel as if my core did get a decent work out.  I do plan on keeping this in my work out DVD rotation, and look forward to my next session.",1242259200,,685,4.362204724409449
3645606,5,B001HZ4K6W,"Do not purchase this DVD if you are new to yoga.  As a intermediate level yogi - this still kicks my butt.  There is little instruction on how to move into each pose, as she assumes the audience is familiar enough with asanas to move with her verbal cues.  That's not to say this isn't one of my favorite Shiva DVDs.

Hello arms!  I could not do 12 reps for each segment, so I started with 6, and now I'm up to 10.  I can feel myself get stronger literally every time I practice with this DVD.

The core section is simply amazing too.  I have a pretty strong core and I was totally feeling it the next day after my first session.  Her positions really work deep muscles that even my pilates DVDs don't touch.

So my recommendation - if you're comfortable with yoga and would like to build strength - this DVD is perfect.  If you're a newbie - pass on this... for now.  Come back to it later!",1240012800,27,891,4.146198830409356
3645607,5,B001HZ4K6W,"Shiva's latest offering is superb!

On my first attempt I modified most positions and only managed 64 of the 108 push ups.  Fast forward three weeks and today I did 100 push-ups - you definitely build in increments and this work out cultivates that growth.

The most notable sensation I have after completing the program is incredible energy. I have started using this workout in the afternoon - around 4pm when energy levels start to drop.  I am currently studying, so when I reach those moments of mental fatigue it offers an effective 35 minute study break that gets my energy levels soaring.

Thank you Shiva for another brilliant workout for my collection!",1237680000,,661,4.814159292035399
3645608,5,B001HZ4K6W,"...but I did! I had to drop to my knees from set 3, but I made it all the way through. So I hope the dread of pushups won't keep anyone from buying this workout. A lot of yoga instructors have made vinyasa dvds that entail extended surya namaskars (sun salutations) with other yoga asanas intertwined between the traditional flow, but this one stands out. Here, in every surya namaskar sequence you do 12 pushups. The surya namaskars end with interesting variations of prone backbends and standing poses that give your upper body time to recover before the next set. I thought this was very cleverly organized. The music is excellent, the production is wonderful as can be expected from Shiva.",1236988800,4,693,4.735537190082645

3645610,5,B001HZ4K6W,"I love the sequences in this DVD!

The first part includes the ""Fire Sequence"" along with the  infamous 108 wide leg push ups.  It sounds daunting but you can go at your own pace (I did 10 push ups per round to start instead of 12) and if you shoulders/wrists are too sore to do more push ups, you can hold plank pose, drop into chaturanga dandasana and hold that position, come into side plank, or just sit back in downward dog.  I have enjoyed assimilating this sequence into my practice since I found myself doing alot of transitions between chaturanga to up-dog and back to down dog during my practices so much that my left shoulder began to  make this clicking sound and I developed a knot in my left pectoral.  The fire sequence really helped me retain my upper body strength while introducing new movements and a nice counter pose (Anahatanasana) to open up the shoulders and chest.

The second part (""Creative Core"") made me realize just how weak my deep hip flexors are!  Rea starts doing these supine wide leg circles she calls ""mandala legs"" and when I tried it the first time my legs didn't want to go any where and I just laid on my floor and laughed.  But I've noticed a great improvement in my knee/hip range of motion after practicing the ""Creative Core"" section a few times.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone who has practiced yoga for a while and are looking for a quick routine to have fun with and become more familiar with areas of the body that may not get much use.

If you are new to yoga or if you have shoulder/wrist issues, this DVD is not for you.  I can recommend that you find a qualified teacher in your area who instructs a yoga style that you are comfortable with.  Rea provides little instruction with respect to proper alignment in each pose and the pace at which she goes through the sequence may seem rushed for those just learning yoga.",1235865600,46,1878,4.424418604651163
3645611,1,B001HZ4K6W,"I wanted to start practicing yoga and needed to tone up my upper body for my wedding in November. I searched and found this DVD, read the reviews for it, and decided to purchase it. I first watched the DVD all the way through and ""thought"" that I could surely do it, it didn't look that hard. Let me tell you, it is alot more difficult to execute those transitions and poses than it seems. The transitions, the poses, and even the evenly spaced 108 postural push-ups. It's definately NOT for a beginner. I am sure that someone who has practiced yoga for a while and maybe even done some of Shiva's DVDs would do just fine. I am just really disappointed!",1234828800,9,653,4.360655737704918

8310127,1,B001HZ4K6W,"I have enjoyed Shiva Rea's ""Yoga Shakti"" and ""Fluid Power"" DVDs, but this is a waste of money. Sure it's fast, but with no substance. My core may have been truly engaged through the chataranga pushups, but they go by in seconds. And yes, this does not really have me thinking of ""yoga practice"" while doing the movements. Pass.",1406592000,,327,4.559322033898305
8310128,3,B001HZ4K6W,"This yoga DVD was plenty more challenging than I expected. I currently do yoga once a week with a instructor, so I'm not completely new to yoga, but I think this video is defiantly meant for the more seasoned yogi :)",1405036800,,216,4.2926829268292686
