8414088,5,B00432QLAO,"The documentarian was involved with her partner, Humberto Enriquez, in the struggle to build a new Chile in the 1970s, a struggle that was cut short by Gen. Pinochet's coup in 1973, which resulted in one of the most brutal regimes in the history of Latin America--all aided and abetted by the US.  The film is a melancholy reconstruction of the events leading to the Chilean coup, and the ensuing death of her mate, killed by the Pinochet police in a shootout in which she was herself seriously wounded, and her own years of exile in Latin America and eventually Europe. Historical memory at its best.  Highly recommended.",1320192000,,622,4.75
