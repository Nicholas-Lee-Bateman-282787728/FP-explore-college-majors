5766939,3,B00D1BODEY,Movie was good. My only complaint was how the movie ended. What happened to the guy who  drugged and raped Rick?,1402012800,,112,4.333333333333333
5766940,3,B00D1BODEY,"Basically a good movie,however some scenes were way too long holding up the suspense. The movie needed more editing to change it to 4 star.",1401580800,,139,4.6
5766941,3,B00D1BODEY,"Just finished watching ""Tumbledown.""
The classic 1950 Japanese period drama Rashomon came to mind while I was watching Todd Verow's movie which he directed, co-wrote, and starred in.
Like Rashomon, ""Tumbledown"" essentially tells the same story for opposing viewpoints in three thirty-minute segments.
Yet each of these segments each feature a disturbing and graphic rape sequence that is definitely not for everyone that is seen, and in the middle segement. justified from the perspective of  each of the three individuals involved.
Actors Brad Halldwell, Todd Verow, and Brett Faulkner are compelling to watch on the screen as the prelude to rape and its aftermath of HIV is explored in a rather simple revenge murder plot that is concocted over bowls of ice-cream after sex.
With it's explosively graphic sex sequences, how this movie escaped getting an NC-17 or X rating is beyond me.  The rapist eating hamburgers after raping his drugged victim was a curious moment. [Yes, I know, it's unrated, meaning it wasn't submitted for a rating.]
Verow and his co-writer/co-writer Brad Haldwell could have gone the route of smartly done Hitchockian psychological thriller - but sadly they didn't.
Two-and-a-half Stars.
Recommended only because of its use of the Rashomon effect of story-telling.",1397865600,3,1291,5.323529411764706
5766942,2,B00D1BODEY,"I watched about 45 minutes of this movie, and turned it off. I really did not enjoy most of those 45 minutes of this film. It just was not my cup of tea. I think, overall, I did not enjoy the movie because it gave gays a bad name, in my opinion.",1395878400,,245,3.730769230769231
5766943,1,B00D1BODEY,"LGBT movies mostly deal with HIV in someway, like every gay man deals with HIV. Copied by Tabloid-mania, classically mis-informed people, will now believe all gay men rape other gay men to spread HIV, this movie is Stereotypical Heterosexism.",1395446400,2,242,5.230769230769231
5766944,1,B00D1BODEY,"This is without a doubt the worst piece of filmmaking I have ever subjected myself to.  It was actually offensive to watch on so many different levels.  It did not even rise to the level of bad pornography. The dialogue is poor, the storyline muddled.  The sex scenes are unenthusiastic and unbelievable. I would be embarrassed to have been involved in the production of this dog of a film in any way.  This is one piece of film that should be destroyed.",1393804800,8,454,4.5
5766945,1,B00D1BODEY,"A really crappy storyline; bad acting, hollow package. Watch at your own risk. A huge waste of precious time. Nothing much here.",1393632000,6,128,4.863636363636363
5766946,1,B00D1BODEY,Really bad acting. Like some of the worst I have seen. The camera work is horrible. It is like someone bought a camera and had no idea of how to set up a shot. Could not watch the whole thing it was so bad.,1392768000,5,206,3.7045454545454546
5766947,3,B00D1BODEY,"This outing is a typical Todd Verow film. The plot is twisty, the production values are iffy, and there is plenty of nudity. I'm never quite certain whether the sex scenes are simulated or real. They are quite naturalistic, at any rate. Verow is a great-looking man, and he appears to enjoy being nude in his films, many of which show off his muscular body and his rather large ""manhood."" This one is no exception.  He also has a talent for finding other actors who are willing to drop trou and go full frontal, as is the case in this film with the very-handsome Brad Hallowell.",1392422400,,578,4.452830188679245

5766951,2,B00D1BODEY,Hard to believe these two overweight twinks would turn down the HOT older muscle stud.  Now that's acting!,1449100800,,106,4.888888888888889
5766952,4,B00D1BODEY,"I think it was a pretty good movie because I understand it completely which I think Todd was just pointing out sometimes you gotta becareful who you meet and hangout with, or things like that end up happen and the ending I have a feeling that Todd's character got killed and the other characters move on with there lives",1446163200,,320,4.440677966101695
5766953,3,B00D1BODEY,"Like Todd Verow's VACATIONLAND, TUMBLEDOWN centers on a horrific rape and its effect on a young man, played again by Brad Hallowell. The rape scene seems to go on forever, but it doesn't really give us any insight into the character of the rapist who remains a cardboard villain. He's creepy from the get go. Dividing the film into three chapters is a bit pretentious. The structure suggests that each chapter focuses on a different character, but actually the entire film centers on Hallowell's character. Perhaps that's because Hallowell is the only one who can act.",1441584000,4,568,4.927083333333333
5766954,1,B00D1BODEY,"that's what i get for watching a film to see peckers and sex.  cannot blame anyone other than myself.  i was forewarned that it sucked big time.. it features the awful acting and so-so story line that seem to be a requirement for many gay-themed films.  and so many laughable features:  the ""vacation"" home that looks like it's in the suburbs;  the numerous holes in the story/plot (what DID they do to the supposed bad guy when they went into his house??);  the complete lack of chemistry between any of the actors..  and worst of all, i'll never be able to get that $3 nor those couple of hours back.",1439596800,,602,4.418181818181818

5766958,1,B00D1BODEY,"I would think by now Todd Verow would learn how to make a movie. The production values are so bad I'm not sure it wasn't shot with an old home camera. The sound is hollow and distracting. Brad Hallowell is the only redeeming factor in this piece of crap. His acting is decent, given the terrible script he had to work with. It would be nice to see what he could do under the direction of a competent filmmaker like Victor Mignatti  or Jim Fall. He actually co-wrote the script with Verow. Stick to acting, Brad. I have seen student made films that were much better scripted, directed, and shot. It is just a bad film.",1425686400,3,617,4.318965517241379

5766962,1,B00D1BODEY,"I have seen strand releasing movies that are low budget, but come off with a good story and decent acting and this is not the case. The bald guy cannot act to save his life and was not believable in any scene, whether he was the antagonist or misunderstood depending on whose story was being told he was just the worst.  The guy with the glasses was bad too for the little amount of time he was in it. The bar owner was the most credible out of the 3 but even he could not save this train wreck

Having said that.. the movie is about 3 men who decide to spend some time in a secluded cabin the woods and there a sexual relationship starts and depending on who is telling the story(which btw this is apparently a true story but names have been changed) you get am opportunity to see where the threesome went wrong.  Is the bald guy actually a rapist or was he the third man left out of the bed while the bar owner and the man with glasses get acquainted. The ending was sad, but by the time you get there you are just so happy it is over and you can quit looking to see how much time is left.

The called it tumbledown I say it should be called tumbleweeds because it is just not something that is interesting to watch let alone mess with.",1414972800,5,1238,4.082304526748971
5766963,2,B00D1BODEY,This movie has a very weak plot and disjointed scenes that leads the viewer in circles and dead ends.  Not recommended.,1410307200,,119,4.666666666666667

8588302,4,B00D1BODEY,"Why is it that in so many films, including gay ones, there's no real ending ?  ""Tumbledown"", a case in point .
How did Rick and Mike finally take care of the problem with Jay ?  It's left to one's imagination.  Obviously, Jay's a mental case.
However, he's quite attractive, and shouldn't have to drug guys for sex.",1515888000,,315,4.396551724137931
