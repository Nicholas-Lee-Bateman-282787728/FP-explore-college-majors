3713907,4,B0009NJFPO,I always enjoy the Rock movies - this one was funny - I enjoyed.  Would recommend as a funny stay home watch a movie night.,1522108800,,123,3.92
3713908,5,B0009NJFPO,"I have watched this more times than I can count. It's what could be called ""infinitely Re-Watchable"". I've always been impressed with storytellers who can so seamlessly combine action with comedy, it's really a lot harder than it looks.  I've never been a wrestling fan so I was unaware of The Rock and I must say I found him to be quite a delight. He has a charisma that really grabs a hold of the screen and he stands out even more so with such an amazing supporting cast. Ewen Bremner, even with such a small role, truly shines and pretty much steals every scene he is in. I first found him in Trainspotting and thought he is most talented and at the risk of sounding odd I am just glad he is working in Hollywood so steadily, he deserves it. Walken rocks! I've always enjoyed his ability to play heavies and still make them somewhat likable. So, click buy and get ready for fun ride!  :)",1521244800,,891,4.3293413173652695

The Rock Dwayne Johnson stars in this action adventure as Beck, a bounty hunter who has been sent to the Amazon to retrieve the son of a wealthy underworld kingpin, who has been hunting for treasure there. But when Beck meets his quarry, Travis [Seann William Scott], he realises he's not the wayward good-for-nothing he'd been warned about, and he ends up joining forces with him to hunt for a priceless idol. But the powerful owner of the mine in the area where they have been searching, Hatcher [Christopher Walken], insists that anything found on his land belongs to him, and Beck and Travis end up having to fight their way out of the jungle. The film boasts an uncredited cameo appearance by Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE RUNDOWN [2003] features the professional wrestler known as The Rock (real name: Dwayne Douglas Johnson) makes a formal announcement of his candidacy for the post recently abandoned by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Mr. Schwarzenegger himself graciously appears in a cameo, leaving a wild party in a disco as The Rock makes his way in. As they pass each other, Mr. Schwarzenegger salutes his would-be replacement. ''Have fun,'' he says, as if offering two words of career advice to his younger (though perhaps even larger) successor.

It has been a while since Hollywood has produced a bona fide action hero, but it appears that one has finally emerged, so look out Vin Diesel, because The Rock appears ready to roll and also to step into the shoes of Arnold Schwarzenegger, which would be a good move, especially with a comprehensible accent, so the symbolic torch has been passed. Now, however, Arnold Schwarzenegger is more interested in a new kind of The Running Man, opening the door for a pro wrestler-turned-movie star.

THE RUNDOWN is a lot of fun because it is a definite genre throwback and the screen isn't polluted by excessive razzle dazzle. The filmmakers have wisely kept their computer animators on a short leash. There are some obligatory pyrotechnics, but, for the most part, this is the kind of testosterone-charged action we saw often during the 1980s. Another reason why this film works is because it employs a simple story. There's no need for passage after passage of exposition to keep the viewer informed. I have often felt that if an action film takes more than a few sentences to explain, it's too complicated.

Beck [The Rock], a self-described ""Retrieval Expert,"" finds himself in Brazil on his latest job. His mission: locate Travis [Seann William Scott], the son of his boss, and bring him to California. Unfortunately, Travis doesn't want to be caught. He is in pursuit of an artefact, and he doesn't intend to leave the monkey-infested jungle before he finds it. Travis isn't the only one after the gold statue. A local bartended/fortune hunter, Mariana [Rosario Dawson], wants it, as does the detested regional despot, Hatcher [Christopher Walken], who has turned the locals into a slave labour force. So Beck chases Travis while being pursued by Mariana, Hatcher, and Hatcher's goons.

Director Peter Berg, who has spent a fair amount of time in front of the camera during his career, crafts THE RUNDOWN film like a seasoned veteran. The action sequences are crisply framed and edited. The suspense is not stalled by too many cuts, and the movie never goes more than a few minutes without something happening, even if it is just The Rock being menaced by a horny baboon. Neither the actor nor the director takes things too seriously, which keeps the proceedings light hearted. There is a fair amount of comedy sprinkled throughout, including a number of deliciously cheesy one-liners.

The Rock (real name: Dwayne Johnson) has everything he needs to be a staple in this genre: the steely stare, the jutting chin, the furrowed brow, and the bulging biceps, as he was his first major film The Scorpion King and The Rock shows screen presence, and definitely seems more at home. Seann William Scott [Travis], plays the time-honoured role of the comedic sidekick. Rosario Dawson isn't quite the love interest as Rosario a little too tough for that. And Christopher Walken plays a wonderfully philosophical and self- confident villain. He never shouts or froths at the mouth, preferring instead to tell stories about the Tooth Fairy. It is a very typical Christopher Walken performance in style and substance type role. Regardless of whether or not it was written for him, he quickly makes it his own.

THE RUNDOWN offers everything a good action packed film of this genre offers: plenty of suspenseful action, a few good laughs, and a share of obligatory ""reluctant buddy"" bonding and if you are in the mood for this sort of light hearted entertainment. THE RUNDOWN is all wild action, all the time. In-between the fisticuffs and elaborate stunts, we get fast and furious humour courtesy of Seann William Scott who is slightly Stark Raving Mad and whose mouth runs at 100 miles a minute throughout the film and sometimes gets himself into serious trouble. His scenes with Beck, after the two become lost in the jungles, are worth a lot of laughs. Quick quips aside, the film is a nonstop action, with enough high-wire acts, extreme wireworks, and physical punishment for the stars and their stunt doubles to fill up three action films. What makes the films stylised visuals even more impressive is that its all under the direction of Peter Berg [The Last Seduction], who is best known for his acting. THE RUNDOWN is Peter Bergs second feature-length film, and it uses just about every camera trick and high-tech special effects Hollywood can offer.

THE RUNDOWN is definitely for those who want nonstop and mindless action, snappy patter from its two charming leads, and little else. I would normally deride the film for being so shallow and unsubstantial, but the film does what it does so bloody well you cant help but tip your hat to it. The screenplay by R.J. Stewart and James Vanderbilt is so brisk that by the time the excellent final 30 minute action sequence comes around you wonder where all the time has gone, and definitely shows you the execution is that good.

THE RUNDOWN is, without a doubt, totally brilliant and a joy to watch. See it for all the crazy stunts, the Hong Kong inspired wireworks, and forget about carrying a useful thought for about 104 minutes. I promise that you won't be bored for one moment throughout the film.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Universal Studios Home Entertainment brings you something really special with this Blu-ray disc, because not only do you get a stunning 1080p encoded image, but an equally impressive 2.35:1 aspect ratio and the transfer is actually really good. The film THE RUNDOWN benefits from its many outdoor jungle scenes that allow colours to pop out of the screen and offering plenty of detail. Skin tones can appear a little too reddish at times, but it fits with the style of the film. The image quality is super sharp allowing you to see every age line on Christopher Walkens face whenever he has a close up. Those of you who like looking at Rosario Dawson will also be pleased because she has plenty of cleavage shots that ready for Blu-ray. All in all, the transfer always appears sharp where it should. Blacks are marvellous, slipping to a dark shade of grey only once or twice. There is some very heavy and seemingly random blocking during a few interior shots inside a cave in chapter 17, but otherwise, there is little to complain about with this one. THE RUNDOWN is another visual winner from Universal Pictures.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Universal Studios Home Entertainment brings you something really special with this Blu-ray disc, where they offer you a real killer 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound mixes, where THE RUNDOWN sounds absolutely brilliant and great at the same time and is a huge leap over the inferior DVD release. There is plenty of action to keep you on the edge of your seat, so all in all your speakers will get a workout; particularly noticeable is the rear speaker because you get to hear all of the jungle ambience sound experience. Dialogue is very clean and sound effects are nicely meshed to immerse you in the action. The film's music plays precisely. It is primarily front-heavy but offers excellent fidelity. The sonic highlight of the film comes in chapter 17 as a cave collapses around the characters and it is loud, scary, and rattles from every single corner of the soundstage, making for a thrilling listen. The film's climax, too, comes complete with some of the heaviest and most consistent uses of bass yet. THE RUNDOWN makes a strong case as one of the most exhilarating and action-packed listens yet on Blu-ray, so crank up the speakers.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: Apart from the Audio Commentaries, the main video extras are comprised of seven featurettes, all quite short and not in high definition.

Audio Commentary: Feature Commentary with The Rock and Director Peter Berg: At the start of the audio commentary we are introduced to The Rock and Director Peter Berg, but slightly annoyed that The Rock informs us that they are doing the audio commentary for the DVD, now how crass is that and Universal Studios Home Entertainment should be totally ashamed of themselves for being very unprofessional, because they should of done a brand new audio commentary with references to viewing the Blu-ray disc. On top of all that I had to crank the volume up to hear them much more clearly audible. Despite this, the audio commentary track is completely off-the-wall, mixing real information with hilarious jokes galore. It's hard to switch off, and flows very nicely and it is definitely different to be sure, very relaxed, and often completely hilarious at times with brilliant anecdotes on certain scenes that were filmed the way it was. We hear a nice comment at the start of the film from The Rock and Director Peter Berg about the cameo appearance of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the The Rock walks into the disco. You hear about the people in the jeep who are not the two main actors. You hear comments about the stunt doubles that really injured themselves very badly to the point of broken bones. By the way, when you see the scene with the jeep going over into the chasm below, we are informed by the director that they are real stunt doubles and not dummies going head over heels down the side of the chasm and really injuring themselves very badly when they finally arrive at the bottom of the chasm and land in the sacred lake in Hawaii, that use to have a King bath with is young ladies and The Rock and Director Peter Berg were very surprised that the authorities allowed the jeep to land in the lake. Also we hear that certain jungle shots were actually filmed on Stage 29 at Universal Studios. The director informs us that when you see the three actors Dwayne Johnson (The Rock), Seann William Scott and Rosario Dawson dive into the lake to retrieve the golden artefact called ""El Gato do Diabo,"" when they surface inside the cave, this was actually built on the film lot because of the logistics of filming in different angles and of course they could control the situation. Other insightful comments includes keep going on about drawn-out stories pondering the best way to square off against Tom Arnold, which completely mystified me and must be an American thing, because he is not built like The Rock and checking out his profile I finally remembered who he is, but still confused why The Rock thinks he could go up against Tom Arnold, as the fight would be a bit one sided, so again very confused why they kept on about this situation, very strange. We also get to hear an obsession about mulling over what The Rock's hair would look like if he let it grow out for a full decade, also debating whether or not cows can get anxious, and swooning over how smoulderingly sultry Rosario Dawson is, which again they kept getting very obsessed about, which slightly annoyed me, which is a typical boring heterosexual Men thing attitude. But despite some of the slightly obsessive comments about certain subjects in the film, it was still very enjoyable 80 minute audio commentary and well worth a listen.

Audio Commentary: Feature Commentary with Producers Kevin Misher and Marc Abraham: Here we get introduced by Marc Abraham and Kevin Misher second, who mention they like the song at the start of the film and that the director Peter Berg wanted it included. They also mention the unusual way to open the film and that you are hearing an audio recording in the background of the Iron Chef whoever he is, as he must be someone very known in America. We are also informed that the club we see The Rock enter at the start of the film is somewhere in Hollywood. Also when The Rock has the massive fight scene and you see him pick up the record deck, well when you see the nasty guy run away and The Rock throws it across the room and knocks the guy to the ground, well that was a one take shot. When you see The Rock walks into the supposedly Brazilian town bar, which was actually shot on the film lot, you see the actress Rosario Dawson drinking the lemonade, which you will see is nearly empty, when Rosario walks round to the bar to give The Rock a beer, you see there is continuity mistake, as you will see the glass is now half full of lemonade and the continuity person who did not spot this mistake, should have been fired. When you see The Rock and Seann hanging upside down and the baboons suddenly appear to cause havoc, well the one that cause a sexual act on The Rock was for real, but most of the other baboons were animatronic puppets. Producers Kevin Misher and Marc Abraham give great praise to the film score and really praise Harry Gregson-Williams for creating really atmospheric music score and especially in different parts of the film and certainly gives great homage to the film The Raiders of the Lost Ark. The scene where The Rock and Sean are given that special fruit to eat that knocks them out, well the filling is pears and the name of the fruit is made up and you will notice the letter K is emphasised and especially at the end of the film with Seanns Father. When The Rock and Sean at the end of the film arrive at Seanns Fathers home, well take note of the two bodyguards sitting in the background and when they eat the fruit, well they are two totally different actors that you see at the start of the film. We also hear that they feel that there should be another THE RUNNER 2 film and it is discussed what different location it should be set in, but obviously no one has come up with a good script or storyline, oh well we can only hope, as I really enjoyed this film and the director did a really excellent job. By the way, this track is much drier and more technical in nature, and seems to drag on considerably after the light and funny easy going nature of the first audio commentary with the actor The Rock and Director Peter Berg. It's still informative and worth a listen for fans, but easily more of a run of a mill standard commentary. Unfortunately, I would have preferred it if they had been edited together so that both audio commentaries merge into one track, because on their own they are a bit of slog to get through.

Special Feature: My Scenes [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] There are no true high-definition exclusives, though Universal has enabled the disc with BD-Live. You can share your favourite chapters with My Scenes Sharing, or log onto the Universal web destination for links to info on other studio Blu-ray titles.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [13:50] There are a set of nine deleted scenes and some of what you view is quite interesting, but definitely are very typical run of the mill deleted scenes.

Special Feature: Rumble in the Jungle [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [10:32] This small feature documentary shows you behind-the-scenes filming on how THE RUNNING films extensive fight scenes and stunts were choreographed and executed and of course The Rock [Beck] gets the most of the screen time here. Other contributors included are Peter Berg [Director], Seann William Scott [Travis], Ernie Reyes Jr. [Manito] and Rosario Dawson [Mariana].

Special Feature: The Amazon, Hawaii Style [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [5:26] Here is another short documentary feature on behind-the-scene location of THE RUNNING where we get revealed how the production substituted Kaua'i, Hawaii, USA for the Amazon jungle. Originally they went to Brazil to do the filming, but as soon as they arrived they were robbed by bandits of all their equipment at gun point. Contributors include Kevin Misher [Producer], Peter Borg [Director], The Rock [Beck], Seann William Scott [Travis] and Rosario Dawson [Mariana].

Special Feature: Appetite for Destruction [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [8:20] Once again we get to view behind-the-scene short documentary of the filming of THE RUNNING and looks at the making of some of the film's special effects explosive stunts and especially how the cattle stampede was staged. Again we get contributions from the crew and actors that includes Burt Dalton [Special Effects Coordinator] and The Rock [Beck].

Special Feature: The Rundown Uncensored [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [6:08] Here we have a slightly silly extra which features basically a spoof inside joke scenario of a fake news pieces made by the film's animal trainer Kevin Keith about some bonding between The Rock and Kamila and some sexual tension that was supposed to have happened between them on the film set. We are told at the start of this short documentary that what we are about to view and hear is based on a true story, except all of the facts have been changed. But we also get other contributions from Kamila [Baboon], The Rock [Beck], Sean William Scott [Travis] and Peter berg [Director].

Special Feature: Running Down the Town [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [4:00] This extended behind-the-scene documentary in which we have a look at how the film's fictional Amazon Brazilian Rain Forrest jungle town that was recreated in Valencia, California, which is a suburb just outside Los Angeles. The brown earth dirt road we are told was actually brick dust that was supplied by a Company that made bricks. Of course the big question people that was asked, was they going to leave the town standing for an amusement park or get demolished, well that question you will have to find out when you view this short documentary. Contributors to this documentary included Thomas Duffield [Production Designer], Karen Glasser [Producer], The Rock [Beck], Kevin Misher [Producer], Marc Abraham [Producer], Christopher Walken [Hatcher] and Rosario Dawson [Mariana].

Special Feature: Walken's World [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [5:32] This final short documentary on behind-the-scene look at the filming of THE RUNNING film, but here we have a lot more fun with this piece on the actor Christopher Walken [Hatcher], who they all say is a great and funny actor. But we also get other contributors that include Thomas Duffield [Production Designer], Peter Berg [Director] and The Rock [Beck]. We also get to see several clips from the film.

Special Feature: Easter Eggs [480i] [1.37:1] Universal Pictures has hidden a wealth of Easter Eggs with the film THE RUNDOWN where you will find six in all. The first five can be found via the ""Scene Access"" submenu by selecting a specific scene number, then clicking the ""Right"" navigation arrow on your remote two times and what is revealed is the following:

Scene 4: Flowers for Mariana: Here we have an interview with actress Rosario Dawson.

Scene 9: They Got My Tooth: Here we have an interview with The Rock Dwayne Johnson.

Scene 11: Peek Break: Here we have a second interview with The Rock Dwayne Johnson,

Scene 17: Behind the Movie: Here we have an interview with actor Sean William Scott.

Scene 28: End Titles: Here we have a second interview with actor Seann William Scott

BONUS: The last Easter Egg can be discovered via the main menu screen. Press you're remote's ""UP"" button and a small icon will appear. Press ""ENTER"" and watch a short clip of star The Rock discussing working with a very dangerous bull on the set.

Finally, THE RUNDOWN is a completely predictable action-fest, and is definitely one of the best The Rock Dwayne Johnsons film to date, and can actually pull off this film 100%. I very much like The Rock and his sense of humour and willingness to poke fun at the clichs of the genre. This Blu-ray definitely offers good picture quality and a great sound experience this Blu-ray definitely delivers, and a solid spate of extras. THE RUNDOWN is a definite '80s buddy comedy-slash-action packed film that at times leaves you breathless that will give you that adrenaline rush with a no holds barred that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and there's something about this exact combination of director, cast, and backdrop that makes for a ridiculous amount of good fun action packed film, exceptional good 1080p image on this Blu-ray disc and well worth a spin! Highly Recommended!

3714011,5,B0009NJFPO,"Dwayne Johnson's appearance in The Rundown was truly the beginning of the end of his wrestling career and the beginning of a very enjoyable (and lucrative) acting career.  In The Rundown he stars as Beck, a chef (which is one of the reasons why I like this as I teach culinary school) who is hired by his boss, a mobster, to hunt down the mobster's runaway son Travis (Seann William Scott).

Beck soon finds out that chasing down Travis is the easy part.  Getting Travis back to the States is going to be the pain.  Enter Hatcher (Christopher Walken).  Travis knows where there's a huge stash of valuables.  Hatcher's been looking for it.  With Travis on the hunt it's Hatcher following Travis to get it first.  Beck and Travis form a decent relationship.  Travis' false bravado often leaves Beck to clean up the mess created by his charge.  This leads to a lot of fun conversation.  Both Johnson and Scott are known for quips in their movies and this leaves no quip unturned or untried.  In fact, it's almost Abbott and Costello worthy.

The Rundown is a laugh.  Originally I didn't want to watch it but was persuaded to do so by a friend.  I'm glad I did.  I've seen watched it several times, each time getting a little more out of the movie and laughing a little more louder as well.  Johnson is clearly a star.  All he needs is the right platform to shine.",1462752000,,1360,4.459349593495935

His career seems to be following the same arc as another muscle-bound actor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who makes a brief 1-second cameo in the first 5 minutes of the movie.  The Rock tries to retrieve a dopey, surfer-looking guy playing Indiana Jones in the jungles of wherever, looking for some artifact.  And he's pretty funny in this movie.  They're a great comedy matchup.  This film belongs to the genre of action-comedy buddy films.  So if you're into films like Midnight Run (with Robert de Niro), you might like this.  If you hate buddy films with a lot of punching, shooting and violence - well, you might hate this.",1452902400,,781,4.642335766423358

This was one of the first movies that (I think) showed he can be great in any role.

Dwayne Johnson is...Dwayne Johnson. In the same way that Christopher Walken is Christopher Walken in the movies he plays (this one included). This isn't a bad thing. For this movie it absolutely works, and the Walkenisms are hilarious.

3714069,5,B0009NJFPO,"This is the movie that, to me, proved The Rock had some bona fide acting chops.  That, of course, is not always a given (see Hulk Hogan and Jesse Ventura for the laughably bad end of the spectrum) when it comes to pro wrestlers turned actors.  It was a role that allowed him to be the action hero everyone thought he would be coming from the pro wrestling world, show off his sometimes underrated comedic side, and even allowed him to make fun of himself a little.

The story involves his character, Beck, who is basically a bounty hunter for a rich loan shark.  He calls himself a retrieval expert.  He is tasked with tracking down the boss' son (played by Sean William Scott in his most ""un-Stifler like role yet) in Brazil as his final job, after which he will be paid enough to open a restaurant and pursue his real passion as a chef.  Along the way he crosses paths with the head of a strip mining operation played wonderfully (albeit in an almost over the top ""more cowbell"" SNL parody of himself) Christopher Walken.  Rosario Dawson also stars as a member of the local resistance trying to get the mining company out of town.

It is certainly not an overly complicated plot, nor does it take much thought or energy to watch.  That said, it is more than just a ""shoot em up"" kind of action movie, although there is also plenty of that.  If you are a fan of The Rock, or just a fan of action movies, it is definitely worth checking out and makes for a good way to kill a couple hours.

For those who get the actual disc, for bonus material there are two different commentary tracks, one with The Rock and director Peter Berg, and another with a couple producers.  Then there are about 45 minutes or so worth of behind the scenes and making of features and deleted scenes.  Good for what is there if you like going through the extras.

It is definitely not a movie that will appeal to everyone.  It would not ever win an academy award, but it is a good action movie that does not take itself too seriously.  Definitely worth a look.",1436054400,,2036,4.3465608465608465

3714081,1,B0009NJFPO,"This movie is not funny and in fact is gruesome, trivializing the plight of many South American countries. It is supposed to be funny when The Rock's character cannot understand the invectives thrown by the man he is sent to bring back to the U.S., thereby causing the rebels to want to fight him. It's just not funny. And Christopher Walken is in it as a nasty head of a labor camp that is mining gold. He seems to play a somewhat farcical character, with a slight edge of some of his previously played serious roles. And it seems this is supposed to be amusing. But, ugh, it is not.",1431820800,,584,4.318181818181818

Ernie Reyes Jr, gives a stand out performance. He should of played KATO in Seth Rogan's GREEN HORNET. Maybe it would have been a hit instead of the lousy film that it was.

He was tough & he was funny. Watching ""The Rock"" & Seann William Scott go at it it throughout the movie was great. I don't recall seeing Seann in anything before either. These two guys made the movie. You can't forget Chris Walken & the beautiful Rosario Dawson. I'm glad they shot this in the 2:35:1 ratio rather than the somewhat common 1:85:1 which would have filled the screen, but you would have missed a lot of the picture. Not really a fan of 1:85:1 ratio aspect. I got this for under $10.00. I saw this at my buddy's house & ordered it the next day. The sound seemed fine to me but I listen through my stereo system & not one of those high end speaker systems they got today. The Special Features are really good too !!

3714140,4,B0009NJFPO,"Interesting action movie.  But you will notice it is of a different type.  Normally action movies have a lot of shooting and fighting and car driving.  Well this one has all these too but different - it is mostly in the jungle somewhere.  But the different part of this is that most of it had some amount of slow motion camera action in it in a exaggerated way something like that movie where everyone wore black robes and bent over backward when they were shot at.  What is that movie?  Well, because of that and the action was just a little over the top, there was a little humor tossed into the script along the way.  The BIG guy ROCK was the primary actor and he didn't like to use guns for some reason in the past.  But near the end of the movie he picked one up... and well... I don't want to tell the whole store line but there was more action.  Without a gun he sure moved well in the action parts.
I wasn't the best movie I ever saw and it wasn't the worst.  I'm giving it a 4 star because it was not BAD and a 3 star would maybe a bit harsh, but I'm being honest to you, don't expect the best movie you ever saw.",1408060800,,1122,4.013513513513513

3714179,4,B0009NJFPO,"Dwayne Johnson is a great actor, but it wasn't until his later movies (Fast Five, Snitch) when he was really being noticed and appreciated for his greatness. But, even among his older, first movies that were goofy, ridiculous fun blockbusters (Doom, Walking Tall, The Scorpion King), there was a movie that he was fantastic in: The Rundown. Directed by Peter Berg (The Kingdom, Battleship), The Rundown centers around Beck and Travis Walker, who Beck is ""assigned"" to bring home to his father. But Travis is in Brazil, where a diabolical man named Cornelius Hatcher (Christopher Walken) who owns the land and a gold mine, wants Travis to give up the Gato do Diablo, an ancient, priceless artifact. Fighting rebels, Hatcher's men, and baboons, Beck and Travis must team up to survive this rundown of epic proportions.

The Rundown is one of the best action-comedies of all time, hands-down. The script is well-written with very smart and witty jokes, the acting is top-notch, especially Dwayne Johnson as Beck, and Berg's directing helps to make this action-comedy also a jungle-adventure movie, to an extent. The musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams helps to create the fun atmosphere and fuel the intensity of the action scenes. To be honest, i really want to see Sean William Scott and Dwayne Johnson team up for a sequel in a couple years, because the two have the potential to do another hysterical and action-packed adventure. The movie is not perfect, but it's not trying to be, though it is a must-see and own for anyone who watches action/adventure, comedies or thrillers.

3714192,5,B0009NJFPO,"This is my favorite Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson movie.  I love most of the others too, but he seemed like he fit this part so well.  I hoped it did well enough to get a sequel.  In fact how did ""The Marine"" get a sequel and not ""The Rundown""?  Personally I think The Rock is a better actor and has lots of potential to make movies like Schwarzenegger.  This movie not only has lots of action and comedy, it has a great back story with Johnson as a wannabe chef that is chasing down collections like a bounty hunter.  I love the intro of this with him narrating about the football players.  All-in-all good movie with some great acting by the entire cast and kudos to Walken as the head bad guy.  Rating due to violence.  Well worth at least a rental.  I bought it because it has great replayability.  Picture and sound are excellent. Support cast is first rate with stand out performances by Christopher Walken, Sean William Scott, Rosario Dawson, and Ewan Bremner. Watch out for the native fruit. Here it is 2018 and I still want a sequel. Hope to see it soon. Maybe the Rock is a chef now, but moonlights as a bounty hunter for special cases.

3714251,4,B0009NJFPO,"Featuring professional wrestler `The Rock' in the lead role of Beck, a professional bounty hunter, this is an action comedy film that's not about intellectual stimulation, but sure is ideal for pure entertainment and eye candy.  Beck heads to Brazil in order to retrieve his boss's son, Travis Walker, from a small town and mine run by the bad guy Hatcher.  But Travis isn't too cooperative because he first wants to find an ancient golden artifact, and Hatcher isn't keen to let him go, not least because he wouldn't mind the artifact for himself.  Add Travis' barmaid friend Mariana to the mix, some rebel forces, and you're all set for some action packed drama.  Beck stars in his role, and as a hero figure who doesn't like guns, he comes across almost as respectable rather than vindictive, and its evident that when he needs to resort to violence it's only because he has to rather than that he wants to.

While the plot isn't always plausible, and the characters don't have any real depth, the film never has any illusions about being serious - it's deliberately larger than life, and all about fun entertainment. The stunts and fights may seem silly and far-fetched at times, but that's partly the point.  The violence isn't gratuitous or gory, and while there's enough of it to make it unsuitable for younger kids, for the most part it's an innocuous and fun ride, with some good cinematography and extended fight scenes with special effects.  Aside from a couple of incidences of blasphemy, the film is also relatively free of the foul language, sexual content or other objectionable material that can sometimes plague films of this sort (although there is one `bathroom humor' scene involving urination and another making crude reference to it, and some minor profanities on occasion).  In the final analysis, The Rundown is a solid success for The Rock, and can be appreciated as half-decent escapist entertainment for mature viewers. - GODLY GADFLY",1312761600,,1961,4.903323262839879

3714261,4,B0009NJFPO,"THE RUNDOWN

I have always been a fan of the Rock or should I say Dwayne Johnson especially in villain roles [film and wrestling], but what ever I have always been a fan. This movie in particular was really the first time Dwayne shined, I know the ""Scorpion King"" and all that was out first but that really was in his wrestling/action realm. This was the first time he was put a little out of his norm [although there is a lot of action and fights] with addition of comedy. He was always good a making people laugh and it was a natural fit and I must say that he pulled it off nicely.

Beck [The Rock] is working for a rich guy retrieving late payments form various people and he is really good at his job. After crashing a party and knocking out some pro football players he thinks his time working for this man is done, but he has one more job left. He can't refuse to do it because he needs the cash to open up his own restaurant. So off he goes to the Amazon to hunt one Travis [Seann William Scott] and bring him back home to papa, Travis has other plans as he is close to finding a priceless artifact. Unfortunately for both of them Mariana [Rosario Dawson] the leader of a rebel group and Hatcher [Christopher Walken] the leader of the oppressors of the natives both want to stop them. So the fun begins as they must fight both groups, each other, the jungle, and some monkeys in a quest to get home.

Naturally this is a funny movie and very enjoyable particularly the cast, every one is excellent in this movie. The Rock is very charismatic and has a great presence on the screen, he gives a great performance here. Seann William Scott is excellent here which is nice because he can be really annoying in certain roles, can you guess what those are? Rosario Dawson is fine and also gives a great performance and once again is very much, fine. Christopher Walken as always is a legend and commands respect every time he is on screen, always great to see him. Ewen Bremner is a scene stealer in this one with his whip wielding ways, oh those silly oppressors.

The script by R.J. Stewart and James Vanderbilt is great and full of some great and funny moments but it is the action that marks my favorite parts of the film. There is one scene in particular that has a lot to do with Capoeira or Capawara depending, although Travis calls it some kind of Jiu-Jitsu or something. Director Peter Berg did a nice job with this film adding in that art form in particular. Add in some excellent shoot outs, fights and some excellent scenes involving monkeys and you get a very entertaining movie.

This is not the best movie ever and may not even be the best WWE produced film either but it is close in the latter. I would recommend a purchase on this one but you could go with a rental if you prefer. This is a very entertaining movie and is perfect for a Saturday at any time, love those lazy days.",1246147200,,2898,4.3100917431192665

3714271,4,B0009NJFPO,"First and foremost, The Rundown has one of the best opening sequences in movie history.  Beck (The Rock) is a collections expert who is in a packed club attempting to collect some cash from an NFL quarterback who has reneged on a wager he lost.  After being denied by the QB, and having alcohol thrown in his face, Beck proceeds to an epic beatdown.  The coolest part about it is the fact that since they are all football players, the movie does an introduction of sorts, with the players' vital statistics like height, weight, and position.  It's highly entertaining to watch Beck demolish a group of guys; it's even better when we know how big each guy is, and that they are professional athletes.

After the initial beatdown, in which it's clear that Beck is one of the baddest men on the planet, Beck meets with his employer (William Lucking), who just happens to be the father of a wannabe archaeologist named Travis (Sean William Scott).  Unfortunately for Beck, Travis is in the Brazilian rainforest, where there's sure to be a ton of trouble.

Upon arrival in Brazil, Beck soon meets Hatcher (Walken), an over-the-top, slave-driving, gold-mine owner who refers to his cast of workers as oompa-loompas.  Hatcher's character is completely ridiculous in a good way, a megalomaniacal way that can probably only be accomplished by Walken, or maybe an early Apocalypse Now version of Brando jacked up on caffeine for the hyperactivity, and Adderall for the blinkless focus.  Why he has an interest in Travis is inconsequential, other than the fact that it serves as a plot fodder and a hindrance to Beck's mission.  Nonetheless, he doesn't want Beck to take Travis out of the rainforest.

What follows is a collection of oddities like monkeys that molest people, outrageously long sequences of Beck falling out of trees without turning into a cripple, fruit that has incredibly strong halleucinogenic affects, and a handful of Walken lines that are hilariously quotable.  There's also an irrelevant ancient artifact (El Gato) that Travis is hunting, and a resistance force of trapeze-artist capoeira fighers, led by Rosario Dawson, who battle Hatcher's dictator-like control.

He's clean-cut, well-spoken, modest, etc. Supposedly this film was supposed to be The Rock grabbing the action mantle, so to speak, from the king - Arnold Schwarzenegger - who will no longer make movies. They even have Arnie make a quick cameo, wishing The Rock good luck! That was a good touch.

I didn't realize until the second time I watched it (which is where I stand now) just how stylishly this was filmed.

Along the way, they have run ins with the local who runs the town (Christopher Walken).

He doesn't quite have the charisma of the slow-talking, talk-with-an-accent Arnie.  However, The ROCK can still carve out a niche for himself and make many more movies to come.

I rented this on VHS first and then later bought the DVD, and I have enjoyed it for quite some time.  The director's and the Rock's commentery are just as funny as the movie.

A tight, good-humoured, and surprisingly well-made film, with some eye-popping effects and well-constructed fight scenes alongside the typical buddy-flic humor.

3714303,3,B0009NJFPO,"In the opening scene of ""The Rundown,"" the current governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, stops by for a brief moment to pass the torch off to Dwayne Douglas Johnson - a.k.a. The Rock - officially anointing him as the action hero star for the new millennium.

In this film, The Rock plays a wannabe restaurateur who finds himself in hock to a vicious mob boss.  To work off his debt, the rock-solid behemoth becomes a retrieval expert, strong arming other people into paying what THEY owe to the gangster.  For his final assignment, the Rock is sent off to the jungles of South America to find and bring back the boss's recalcitrant son, who is busy searching for some buried Indian treasure and making a general pest of himself.  While there, The Rock becomes involved in a small war between a gold miner who has virtually enslaved the native population (who else but Christopher Walken?) and the band of rebels out to defeat him and regain freedom for their people.

""The Rundown"" is a fairly standard action adventure film in which the ever-resilient hero is able to pulverize a whole army of armed-to-the-teeth bad guys with little more than his own bare hands and without suffering a single scratch in the process.  No matter how many times he gets punched, kicked, stomped on, thrown into the air or tossed over a cliff, The Rock always manages to pick himself up, dust himself off and fight again.  Writer R.J. Stewart and director Peter Berg make it a point to emphasize The Rock's humanity by having him rarely use a gun when fighting (and then only as a last resort) and by giving him a homey domestic dimension in the form of his culinary talents.  There's something downright incongruous about having a human side of beef beating everyone he meets into a bloody pulp, all the while declaring that he is really opposed to violence on principle.  The film is also filled with all the verbal bantering, wisecracks and quips one has come to expect from these big budget action pictures.  Some of the humor works and some of it doesn't.

Although The Rock has yet to develop his chops as an actor, he has a certain laidback charm that works well on screen.  He is effectively paired with Seann William Scott (Stifler from the ""American Pie"" movies), who has a ball playing the hyper kinetic jokester who just happens to be hiding a heart of gold under his mercenary exterior.  The two develop a kind of nagging, love/hate relationship that generates a few laughs along the way.  Rosario Dawson, with her seamless, pearly white teeth and perfectly coiffed hair, is far from convincing as a woman who is a bartender by day and a jungle-dwelling revolutionary by night.  She is so grave and serious in her overall demeanor that she seems to be acting in a whole other movie entirely.

The Rock has a long way to go before he finds a vehicle even half as good as the best that Arnold has done, but ""The Rundown"" has its moments.",1107043200,,2939,4.633911368015414

Scott is in a role here that 1) shows his estimable physique 2) displays quality comic timing and 3) lets us see him in a role that actually requires skill.

3714309,4,B0009NJFPO,"Wham. Bam. Pow. Huh? Kaboom! Chuckle chuckle.

Yeah, ""The Rundown"" was one of those films.

In Dwayne Douglas Johnson's (The Rock) finest on-screen performance to date, he portrays Beck, a retrieval expert/aspiring chef with a titanium endoskeleton. Or so it seems, at least, as his massive frame is contorted in every way imaginable, only to remain in first-rate condition.

Beck is sent out to Pele's playground, Brazil, to haul home a Stanford dropout by the name of Travis (Seann William Scott). It goes without saying that Travis has a serious knack for adventure, whether it be treasure hunting or cluelessly ensnaring a married man's wife for a night or two.

As it just so happens, the short-term Stanford attendee is the son of Beck's boss, who couldn't care less about what becomes of his own as long as he doesn't lose his business with the man Travis mistreated.

After being taken aback by the ultra-machismo hand-to-hand smackdown Beck lays on an entire NFL defensive line, there's no reason not to think such a dynamo could pulverize the stalky likes of Travis and have him riding wrist-in-cuff, homeward bound, in no time.

Instead, acting as a foil to Beck's objective, Hatcher (Christopher Walken), attempts to ward Beck off with his gun-toting henchmen. To elaborate, Hatcher is bent on locating the golden gato, an Amazon relic projected to fetch millions upon millions on the black market. Hatcher's intense longing for the artifact drives him to purchase a humongous plot of Amazonian soil and forcefully hire all natives residing in the fertile valley to assist in the mass excavation.

However, fully aware Travis may have stumbled upon the pristine lair of the long-lost remnant, Hatcher will do anything to exploit Travis' insight, most notably taming Beck with an entourage of whips extraordinaire.

Throw in a frenzied clan of backwoods renegades, led by the sly yet stunning Mariana (Rosario Dawson), that are eager to claim what is rightfully theirs and reap the profits to propel their civilization to affluence, and you've got yourself one tantalizing flick.

It is the unintended quirkiness and comical relief provided by Walken that makes this film worthwhile. By far his best movie of the summer, it outduels his characterization in the sex-starved dung mound of a motion picture starring Al Pacino, a lesbian J-Lo and a self-effacing Benjamin Affleck.

If Walken isn't rallying support from his gun-slinging search party by rambling off inaudible chatter about getting scammed by the tooth fairy, he's commenting on the explosive action unfolding around him with one or two words. Other times, not even I have the faintest idea what the hell he's doing or alluding to. Bellissimo.

I must commend this film in being a highly amusing action-adventure stocked to the brink with aroused baboons, gnarly scuffles and even a cameo of some Austrian-accented hulk running on the California governor Republican ticket.",1096243200,,2946,5.129436325678497

The first section before the real story is interesting, with an action sequence more akin to a music video than action movie with rapid-fire camera work and stylish choreography. Once the story gets going, the movie hits a nice stride, with the Rock doing a fine job in his various situations, switching effortlessly between disarming humor and cold-steel seriousness. The supporting characters are fine as well, being irritants to the Rock's serious mission, but somehow working well as an ensemble, and the action sequences are true action rather than wrestling-transferred-to-screen as you would think.

A couple of minor complaints, however. It's always nice to see Christopher Walken in another over-the-top performance, but his ranting seems more suitable for some other movie than this one.

3714323,3,B0009NJFPO,"""The Rundown"" is the latest entrant in the ""action musical"" category, a movie so entrenched in its belief of brawling that director Peter Berg occassionally stops the narrative to spin the Hawaiian jungle (filling in for the Amazon) in a tizzy and throw some bodies at each other. These fight scenes, most of them starring The Rock as a straight-arrow skip tracer, are at least devoted and energetic, more joyous than angry. It's jungle war, all right, but they're loving it.
The Rock is Beck, hired muscle for a loan shark looking to bring his son Travis (Seann William Scott) back from South America for reasons the movie never even cares to explain. Travis is a Stanford dropout and a treasure hunter; he is currently looking for a hidden, ""priceless"" aritifact called ""El Gato,"" which in Travis-speak translates to ""My Gato!"" As in ""You're not going to take me away from My Gato!"" This is before he's even found the Gato.
Travis seems to work for Hatcher (Christopher Walken) the Kurtz-like mayor of El Dorado, a gold-mining town. A barmaid (Rosario Dawson, on the 12th of her 15 minutes) has her own buried agenda. El Dorado is a mix of sadist soldiers (whips, chains, old Jeeps), kung-fu natives and a Scottish pilot (Ewen Bremner) given to drunken, biblical, incoherent stump speeches. ""Indiana Jones"" and ""Romancing The Stone"" are influences, as are any of the hard whiskey movies of William Friedkin and Sam Peckinpah.
Amidst this, The Rock brings a dash of Schwarzenegger with him, a detached, comical disbelief that, one, he's in movies to begin with; and two, that anybody inside the movie even bothers to mess with him. Scott still tries to channel Jim Carrey, but he's beginning to settle on becoming a more gifted version of Ashton Kutcher. Berg, praise be, shoots and lights the film without any artistic flourishes: There are no washed-out skies, no sepia jungles, no cool blue interiors, no high contrast. It's bright, lucid, crisp. Doesn't seem like much, but the natural scenery is its own character because of it.
""The Rundown"" aspires to escapist, Saturday matinee entertainment. It succeeds, although Rock-ogling aside, women will likely want nothing to do with this movie.",1088726400,,2196,4.953929539295393
3714324,4,B0009NJFPO,"If you haven't seen ""The Rundown"", you're probably wondering about how good it really is. Prior to viewing - what are your expectations? You can look at this movie in two ways: One - as a big blockbuster action flick with the WWF's ""The Rock"" and all kinds of incredible fight scenes, an incredible story, bombs going off, and the bad guys getting what they deserve. Or two, have no expectations at all. I feel that if you go into ""The Rundown"" with high expectations thinking Dwayne Johnson will be the next ""Terminator"", ""Commando"", or ""Predator""... you might be let down. However, I went into this movie with NO expectations. I've never been a fan of the WWF and the only thing I've seen The Rock in was the ""Mummy Returns"" (and was unimpressed with him and his claymation double). I watched some of the behind-the-scenes features before the actual movie and was pleasantly surprised at the Rock's smarts, athleticism, (Hawaiian) charsima and sense of humor. I never knew the Rock was such a smart, let alone a funny guy. As for co-star Seann William Scott - he remained true to his other well known characters...a bit obnoxious and often funny at times. The other shock in this movie was director Peter Berg. I had no idea this guy could direct! I only remember Berg from Copland (""Joey""), and probably more so as Corky Romano's illiterate brother ""Paulie"". Don't look for an incredible plot here; ""The Rundown"" is a very simple story. ""Beck"" (The Rock) is a ""Professional Retriever"" or bounty hunter. He wants to retire from the mobster for whom he works for and with his last big pay-off, open a restaurant where he can be the chef. The mobster's son ""Travis"" (Scott) is deep in the jungles of South America and is mixed up with some of the wrong people (namely ""Hatcher"", played nicely by Christopher Walken). It's Beck's job to bring Travis back home to Los Angeles. The trip home is a long one and there's some great action, explosions, jeeps going off the road and the stars tumbling down a mountain side, fight scenes, monkeys going ape, etc. The opening scene (prior to Beck hitting the jungles) takes place in Los Angeles. Beck has to confront a football quarterback with a betting problem. As Beck walks into the night club he passes many people (one being Arnold Schwarzenegger in his shortest movie role ever). Beck finds the QB, but he's surrounded by his entire offensive line (and they're huge). The QB won't cooperate, and Beck whists thru these larger-than-life guys one by one while the strobe lights flicker and the music blazes... a great scene! Only thing out of reach in this movie was some of the stunts where you just knew the actors in the fight scenes were on ""wires"". Sure, they were fun to watch, but you knew they were physically impossible - even for The Rock. Go into this movie expecting nothing and you'll get much more out of this movie. I was entertained... I found ""The Rundown"" had a good pace (I never looked down at my watch), plenty of action, great fights, some good stunts, and good dialogue between the characters (humorous and not).",1088035200,,3080,4.6740331491712706

And in a genre where leaden or hammy actor is par for the course - where the best actor in the bunch may be Schwarzenegger and it goes down from there to the VanDammes, Seagals and Lungrens - the Rock fits right in.  He is not bottom-of-the-barrel, but the odds of him showing up on Oscar night are roughly equivalent to a lightning strike.
Of course, in an action movie like the Rundown, we don't expect to find the next Olivier or DeNiro, but even in its genre, the Rundown is nothing special, only notable for the Rock being in it, and as discussed, this is no great feature.  The story has him as a bounty hunter named Beck who wants to be a cook in his own restaurant.  (That's around the extent of the cleverness of this film:  the idea of a macho character actually wanting to be something considered non-macho is supposed to be ironically funny, and maybe it would be if it hasn't already been done before numerous times.)  Hired by a mobster to find his son, Beck goes off to South America where he runs into complications involving a ruthless miner (played by Christopher Walken in one of his weaker performances...and he's still the best in the bunch), an ancient artifact and a bunch of rebels (who actually aren't rebels in that they are defying Walken, not rebelling against the government).  The result is a mishmash of many, often better movies, most notably Raider of the Lost Ark and Midnight Run.
How is the action itself?  Okay, but usually overly stylized, as the director tries to show off how clever he can be.  The result is that the direction is on the same level as the acting and writing, which is unimpressive at best.  Beck is neither particularly bright and his fighting level seems to fluctuate with the demands of the scene: early on, he takes on several football players without breaking a sweat, then later on he has his problems going one-on-one with a small (albeit nasty) rebel, and even Sean William Scott is occasionally a challenge.
With okay action and little else to recommend it, this barely gets two stars.  This is a movie that is overdirected, underwritten and woodenly acted.  If you're stuck watching it, you will survive, but even in the field of cheesy action movies, there are a lot better films out there.",1087344000,,2458,4.5867579908675795
3714326,4,B0009NJFPO,"God bless Dwayne, he's a talented guy whose thirst for knowledge in the acting arena is admirable and sadly, rarely seen these days but some of the movies he's been in have seriously lacked the plot to hold my attention.  This movie had some hilarious parts (monkey scene, eating that fruit that made you high) and some rather pathetic moments (""thunder and lightning"", tooth fairy speech and the fact that Dwayne is supposed to be a CHEF!?!--no backstory on that and a waste of lines).  But if you're looking for an action movie that is pretty non stop, this is it.  The fight scenes are good and the action is enough to keep you interested despite the poorly executed plot.  Dwayne is charismatic, funny and believable in his role...I think he makes the absolute best in what he was given to work with.  Sean makes the best of his role as well but for someone who has outsmarted the long arm of the slumlords for so long, some of the lines he was given were totally cheesy.  I think they make a good duo though and if the script were a little more developed there's the possibility to be the next Lethal Weapon-esque buddy movie stars.  (Dwayne did state he'd be interested in that type of role...interesting thought)
But if you're renting/buying this movie to see The Rock and/or a good action movie,  you won't be disappointed.  If you want that AND a plot, well...2 outta 3 ain't bad!
Onto the DVD extras.  THIS is the reason I'm buying the DVD.  My husband and I were laughing so hard we could barely breathe.  It was like a whole separate bonus comedy after the movie!!  Their chemistry is even more apparent on this section and the behind the scenes stuff was just great.",1087171200,,1679,4.5198675496688745
3714327,3,B0009NJFPO,"In my younger teen years, I admit it, I was a fan of The Rock on what was then called WWF (now WWE, of course). He just always made me laugh whenever he delivered his hilarious insults and one-liners. ""...If u smelllllllll what the Rock is cooking!"" Which self-respecting wrestling fan couldn't resist that, hehe? Now he is trying his luck as a Hollywood action star, and I've always thought that if there was to be a new action star on the level of Schwarzenegger and Stallone in the '80s, The Rock (he should really start crediting himself by his real name, Dwayne Johnson) could be it. Who cares if he ain't a great actor? Charisma, a tough physique, and even a tough presence is all an action star really needed (anything else is a bonus), and The Rock pretty much has all three.
Okay, I'm not the biggest Rock fan in the world. I have seen neither THE SCORPION KING, in which he got his first top billing, nor the recent remake of WALKING TALL, in which he plays the role Joe Don Baker played in 1974. I have, though, seen this movie, Peter Berg's THE RUNDOWN. In it, he plays a bounty hunter named Beck who has to go through one last mission down in El Dorado before he can retire the business and open his own restaurant. And what a mission it is! Having to deal with a brat looking for treasure (Seann William Scott), a mad dictator (Christopher Walken), and a bartender (Rosario Dawson) who turns out to be a tribal leader (I think) also looking for the same treasure as Scott's character. Needless to say, it's more than Beck bargained for.
Unfortunately, the movie he's a part of is a little less than I bargained for. I respect director Berg's attempt at being something other than the usual frenzied, overscaled brainless action spectacle that is seemingly the norm today, and perhaps it can be argued that the Amazon settings of the movie are worth the extra time. Still, I couldn't truly work up a lot of enthusiasm for THE RUNDOWN. Despite some interesting plot twists and turns, it seems to me basically another genre picture, and ultimately a forgettable one at that. It had more intrigue than most, but overall it wasn't as much fun as I expected.
Who knows, though? Maybe it's simply b/c I saw it on the reduced proportions of a TV screen rather than on the much-bigger, wider screen of a theater that I react this way. It might seem grander---particularly its pictorial imagery---on a big movie screen then it would on the small screen, with its grandeur vastly reduced. At least, though, the small screen doesn't diminish the performances, which were all at the very least competent. Seann William Scott may simply be playing a slightly smarter version of his Stifler idiot in the AMERICAN PIE movies, but at least he does it well. Rosario Dawson also doesn't have much of a developed character, but at least she looks very nice (as she always does) and delivers her lines with conviction. I gotta say that, to me, Christopher Walken seems to be on autopilot in this movie, but at least he resists overacting as the bad guy---his madness is subtle---and Christopher Walken on autopilot still isn't totally without interest for the audience.
And as for The Rock...well, once again he may not blow anyone away with his acting skill, but in the confines of this role, he has that formidable presence and conviction that a powerful action star should have. He shows here that he certainly can be an action star, and while this movie doesn't totally succeed for me as an action flick, it at least tries to be smarter and better than those dumber-than-dumb star vehicles for Stallone and Schwarzenegger in the '80s.
Still, despite its noble ambitions, I would not recommend THE RUNDOWN.",1086998400,,3702,4.6448170731707314

3714330,4,B0009NJFPO,"When I saw the Scorpion King I was completely convinced that The Rock was nothing more than another muscle bound hunk looking for hollywood action to ad to his wrestling career.  He was impressive physically of course, but his acting was nothing more than a drawl.
So when the Rundown first came out I was convinced it would have no more substance and I opted to not see it in theaters.  It's a decision I regret.
This movie has changed my entire view of the Rock as an actor.  His performance is actually quite impresive for an action star, his character is not only memorable, but likeable.  The action is top notch, showing some of the most incredible camera shots and stunt work i've seen in a while.  It's got to be the most original action movie this year.
If the movie has one failing, it is its plot.  I know that sounds like it might actually ruin the entire movie but it doesn't.  The plot is just very cliche, which is ironic because the characters, particularly Beck(The Rock), are all so original.  Trust me, this movie is very good, at times you might go ""ah common"" at its plot twists, but there is very little to criticisze about the action, the directing, and even better, the acting!",1086480000,,1201,4.477064220183486

""The Rock"" gives a pretty good performance as a bounty hunter who is tasked to bring back a family member (Seann William Scott) from an Amazon jungle.  The stunts are almost too good to be true.  The story almost falls apart with the ridicuous dialogue.  However, the action is enough to make this a pretty reasonable movie to endure, much like bubble gum.",1085961600,,484,5.0125
3714332,4,B0009NJFPO,"""Rundown"" is a surprisingly good action film, perhaps better than ""The Scorpion King,"" starring The Rock, whose mustles and humors will always entertain you.  Slick, funny, and most of all bone-crunching, this is what a good action flick should be.
The Rock is ""Beck"" who wants to own an Italian restaurant (seriouly, and he is a cook), but now has to work as a ""retrieval expert"" for a mobster.  Now he is assigned another job, hopefully the last one, of bringing back the gangster's son Travis (Seann William Scott) from the Amazon, where he is seeking for a treasure somewhere in the jungle.
The Rock flies there; among the beautiful rain forests, he finds Travis, who is not happy to meet him.  To make things more complicated, greedy baddie Hatcher (Christopher Walken with his usual quirky mannerism), the king of ""El Dolado,"" a goldmine where the natives are forced to work for criminaly low wages, steps in, to require the secrets of the treasure Travis is after.
Against the backdrop of the green jungles, the great actions go on with the Rock in top form.  One of the unique points is that he refuses to use guns, relying on his physical agility and strength, and it works nicely in each moment.  The gravity-defying stunts of the Rock are all well-choreographed, without using too much wire-works.  They are exciting and funny, the best kind of actions coming from Hollywood.
Rosalio Dawson and Ewen Bremner appear as support, and they are good.  But the real scene-stealer is Christopher Walken, who can infuse slight touch of comic (perhaps without his knowing) into the simplest word like ""wow.""  Actually, he is the kind of the villain whose first appearance on the screen would make you cheer and applause eben if you know that he is a villain.  That is something you are not going to see in Hollywood films everyday.
The fascinating jungle location (of Hawaii, in fact) works well as a bonus point to ""Rundown,"" great action film.  And don't miss the cameo of Arnie whose short line is very meaningful.",1085875200,,2019,4.775862068965517
3714333,4,B0009NJFPO,"And very funny.
I can honestly say I seriously doubted I would like this film and I only went to see it because it was on and I was there. I'd never seen a movie with The Rock before or even watched any wrestling so I was kind of dubious as to whether or not he would be any good.
In fact he was a great actor, full of personality and charisma, willing to make fun of himself and was great with the action. The Rock is definitely the next Arnie. Vin (Donald Duck) Diesel is the next Jean Claude Van Damme.
Seann William Scott was also pretty funny in a rare NOT Stifler performance. As an actor he does have genuine talent that's usually wasted in low-brow teen sex comedies.
The Rundown is a sort of Indiana Jones-lite movie. The Rock plays a bounty hunter/chef who is sent to track down Seann William Scott south of the border. Against his will The Rock ends up on a trek through the depths of the Mexican jungle looking for some ancient artefact. Unoriginal it may be but director Peter Berg keeps it moving with plenty of stunts, action and laughs. Christopher Walken's villain is a bit of a cardboard cut-out but how evil are you allowed to be in a PG-13?
I look forward to the next movie starring The Rock. With talks of a third Conan movie I can only imagine him being the best choice. And keep a lookout for Arnie in the nightclub at the very beginning. 'Have fun' is his only line. And fun The Rock will certainly have as the next BIG action hero.
Keep a lookout for Scottish actor Ewan Bremner (a zillion times the 'star' Ewan MacGregor is) in a funny role as a slob pilot.",1085788800,,1583,4.245033112582782
3714334,4,B0009NJFPO,"""The Rundown"" features the Rock in his second outing in a Hollywood leading role and he lays the smackdown.
THE STORY:
Beck (The Rock) is a bounty hunter sent on his ""last case"" to bring back his boss' errant son, petty hustler Travis (Sean William ""Stifler"" Scott) who is running amok in the Brazilian Amazon.  While in the Amazon Beck runs afoul of the ruthless local Overlord, becomes part of the people's revolution and along with Travis finds the secret fortune hidden deep in the jungle.
THE COOL THINGS:
Overall, this was a very satisfying action-comedy flick.  The fight scenes and big money stunts were awesome and the comedic chemistry between Rock and Stifler was top-notch (monkeys and paralyzing beans anyone?).  The Rock's billing as the ""2nd Coming of Schwarzenegger"" is pretty well justified by this film.  The story wasn't the best but I seriously doubt anyone's checking this film out for a good story.  You're watching this to see some bad guys get their butts kicked and this film definitely delivers.

3714335,4,B0009NJFPO,"The Rock lives up to his billing in this action adventure flick that is just plain fun!
The story is fast-paced, filled with action and smart. Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) has all the moves, muscles, and mouth to make this a rocking good story. Classic good vs evil plot makes this reminiscent of the Raiders of the Lost Ark trilogy. While the Rock gets top billing, Christopher Walken is the perfect bad-guy-you-love-to-hate.
The dialogue is crisp and surprisingly witty. This is a sit-back and enjoy your popcorn and cold beverage type of movie.",1084924800,,544,4.860215053763441
3714336,3,B0009NJFPO,"Even with three movies released (well, technically four, if you count The Mummy Returns), it's still difficult to tell if The Rock is going to have a strong film career. Reasons? He's not much of an actor and his movies haven't exactly ""rocked"" the box office, if you'll pardon the pun. But he's got plenty of charisma that just radiates ""movie star,"" and that speaks volumes more than anything solid talent can when you're starring in a brainless action flick.
And brainless action flick The Rundown is, with its generic title and equally generic plot, starring The Rock as bounty hunter/aspiring chef Beck who heads into the Amazon to retrieve amateur archaeologist Travis (Seann William Scott) at the orders of Travis' own mob-boss father. But Travis is highly reluctant to leave, seeing as he's on the verge of discovering a gold artifact worth millions, but said artifact is also desired by two warring groups, slave-driving operators led by Hatcher (Christopher Walken) and the local rebels fighting Hatcher's mining establishment, all with Beck and Travis caught in the middle.
Despite the fact that The Rundown is a bit of a return to the 80s-style of bone-crunching action extravaganzas, it comes up short real fast. A perfect example of a missed opportunity comes in the film's opening scene; after a delightful ""pass the torch"" cameo from Arnold Schwarzenegger, The Rock lays the smack down on the entire offensive line of football team for the sake of a superbowl ring. This should have been a hilarious, wildly thrilling setpiece, but the constant quick cuts and flashing lights make the action almost incomprehensible.
After this brawl, the film slows down considerably during its endlessly draggy exposition before finally picking up with a decent barfight about a half-hour into the picture. It's at this point we realize the film has the same basic problem that permeates Arnold's mindless action thrillers; the sight of a hulking hero beating down on smaller opponents just doesn't generate much in the way of suspense or excitement.
Most Arnold flicks usually compensated for this with great one-liners or even bigger villains, but in The Rundown's case, there aren't nearly enough laughs and the action just doesn't thrill. Where the film does truly come to life is at the forty-minute mark, when a full-bladdered but hands-tied-behind-his-back Travis desperately has to pee, leading to several mishaps that result in a baboon just hankerin' to fornicate with Beck; you have to see it to believe it.
This is, unfortunately, the only scene where the film genuinely comes to life. The following action sequence, a showdown between Beck and several quick-footed local rebels, is pretty inventive, but marred by quick cuts, the obvious use of stuntmen, and an awful soundtrack that employs beating drums and, of all things, a whistle.
The final battle is almost a complete letdown, with director Peter Berg once again unwisely editing the film in MTV-style. It's when the action slows down enough that the real impressive moments stand out, like Beck's fight with the whip-slingers. And let me say this, when our hero makes a huge point throughout the film about never using guns and we the audience actually find this pretty unique, it's very disappointment to see the climax feature the hero resorting to shooting down all the bad guys, without even cracking a smart-ass one-liner, to boot.
The cast is actually pretty engaging for this sort of film (with the only real weak link being Rosario Dawson, who's utterly bland); I kinda like The Rock, I also kinda like Seann William Scott, ditto for Ewen Bremner, and I definitely like Christopher Walken, but the film puts this cast's considerable action and/or comedic talent to waste. This is an average action film, period.

Tasked with the retrieval of a wayward son, he ends up in a three (or four) way hunt for a mysterious golden idol, along the way enountering everything from homicidal gold miners to jungle rebels to packs of angry monkeys.  It is one funny movie, and the action scenes are great.  Most importantly, the cast has both charisma and quality, and the dialogue isn't nearly as stilted as you'd expect in a typical action film.

The plot isn't anything special, but there aren't many action movies out there with superb plots.  The Rock plays Beck, a bounty hunter, who's sent to the mining town of El Dorado to bring back Travis, played be Seann William Scott.  Christopher Walken is just chewing up the scenery as Hatcher, the heartless boss of El Dorado, and doesn't make things so easy on Beck to take his latest capture home.

Of course, to get it, Beck has to go through the Clubs bouncers and the teams Offensive linemen to collect in a well done action sequence.
Beck seems to be in debt to this mobster and agrees to one last job to clear his slate and open his restaurant.  He has to go to Brazil and bring back the mobsters son (play by Seann William Scott) from the Amazon jungle.

What is astonishing about The Rundown is how visually interesting it is.  This is surprising because it is directed by the actor Peter Berg, who was the male lead in The Last Seduction.  He comes up with a lot of interesting techniques and special effects, which is important in the action genre because we've seen it all before.
As an actor, Berg seems to have an intuitive sense of how to get good performances out of people - in this case, The Rock.  He comes off sufficiently charming and heroic in this movie, if somewhat rough around the edges.  He is also allowed to play some of the gags for laughs.  Christopher Walken turns what could be a forgettable villain into an interesting part.

The movie is about Beck(the Rock) who goes after his bosses son(Beck is a police officer of some sort)who is trying to find an extremely rare relic in the Amazon jungle. There are many more subplots(i won't tell you though) but that is the main plot. Easy huh?
With excellent action, excitment, and comady, I HIGHLY recommend this movie!

3714348,5,B0009NJFPO,"I haven't had this much fun at an action movie since the Schwarzenneger heydays of the mid- to late-1980s.  This movie has talent, humor, heart, and action galore.  The Rock is a surprisingly capable actor who plays a very powerful (yet sympathetic) ""retrieval expert"" and wannabe-chef.  In this generation, the Rock has no peer as an action star.
Christopher Walken is, as always, the perfect villain (he steals ever scene that he's in), and Sean Willian Scott (better known as ""Stifler"" from American Pie) plays a humorous sidekick who manages comic relief without being annoying.  Rosario Dawson rounds out the cast as a shockingly beautiful and steel-spined heroine:  a strong and capable woman rather than a damnsel in distress.  The scenery is beautiful, the action sequences are remarkably good (more enjoyable than Matrix, as far as I'm concerned), and the cast has a great time working with a fun storyline.  From bagpipe-toting Irishmen and voracious baboons to expert whip-masters and Inca traps, you can't ask for more in an action flick.
Why this movie didn't make a bigger splash than it did is a mystery to me.  This is EXACTLY what action movies should always aspire to be.  I actually cheered at several points!",1082851200,,1228,4.980392156862745
3714349,4,B0009NJFPO,"Well, I for one was pleasantly surprised by this action/adventure flick. Truth be told I like Seann William Scott, Christopher Walken, Ewen Bremner, and Rosario Dawson, who all have roles, but it was The Rock (the films main character), who is surprisingly charming and amusing and - lest I forget - the action star and highlight of this film. Sure, if you were already a fan of his pro wrestling star status, you would buy this DVD anyway, but I only knew him from the recent The Mummy movies, where I wasn't overly impressed with his CGI-assisted Scorpion King character. So really, it was kind of a first meeting for us.
The plot is fairly straightforward: Beck (the Rock) has to find Travis in the Amazon jungles and return him to Los Angeles. It&iexcl;s like the late 80&iexcl;s DeNiro movie Midnight Run in this way. Given that it takes place in the Amazon and Travis is seeking an ancient treasure, it also plays a bit like an Indiana Jones instalment.
Christopher Walken plays a bad guy again C no surprise there, and he seems to relish the lines he&iexcl;s been given. Seann William Scott buffed up for this role, but he retains his smart-ass humour from the American Pie movies, which he is most known for. Rosario Dawson is probably one of the better up-and-comer actresses, and though she looks great and acts well in this, I really was annoyed by her awful attempt at the Brazilian Portuguese accent - sounding a bit Russian, Jamaican, German etc at times. But I&iexcl;m nitpicking here, right? Ewen Bremner (best known from Trainspotting) is on the other side of the spectrum being (intentionally) fairly difficult to understand with his thick Scottish accent.
Last but not least, The Rock is just oh-so cool and yet he plays his role straight and &iexcl;real&iexcl;. Despite the &iexcl;Rock&iexcl; name, you don&iexcl;t feel like you&iexcl;re watching the typical action star (Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Vin Diesel), who is always posing or looking mean with squinty eyes. Rock actually acts a lot more natural than most actors in general; in the DVD commentary he's modest, amusingly self-deprecating, and seems at ease with himself, and those are qualities that are rare in Hollywood, let alone most people you meet. Director Peter Berg&iexcl;s commentary is only bearable because he has Rock to play against. Berg also oozes a bit too much for Rosario Dawson at times. It&iexcl;s almost embarrassing to listen to.
Harry Gregson-Williams, who is director Tony Scott&iexcl;s loyal composer, does the score for The Rundown and it is indeed great, mixing the right amount of energy into what&iexcl;s required to pace an action movie, but also adding lots of flavour appropriate with the Amazon/Brazil reference.
There are the usual plot holes and at times weird and typically American kind of humour attached to violence (&iexcl;you tried to shoot me&iexcl; ha, ha, ha) as well as the predictable kind of action movie: will-you-choose-to-free-the-slaves-or-get-rich? life altering decisions to make&iexcl;like we can&iexcl;t guess the ending. The running joke &iexcl;Option A, Option B&iexcl; is also used one too many times for my liking.
However, for an action/adventure movie, The Rundown is really funny and mostly well-acted. It also sounds and looks good C visually C and most of the effects and stunts are fun to see. The DVD extras aren't exhaustive, but The Rock and cast look like they had fun on the shoot. I&iexcl;ve watched this DVD a few times now, and it just feels like a different take on a common theme, and a lot of that comes down to the play between the Beck and Travis characters (Rock & Sean).

The movie itself it four stars, while the DVD is flat out five for the commentaries, and ESPECIALLY for the deleted scenes, but I couldn't get myself to take it all the way up to five stars.
One thing I love about this movie is the way Travis fails to be the traditional side-kick.  He isn't up to the hero's standards, but he isn't useless either.  That brings me to my biggest beef with the movie: THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR CUTTING OUT TRAVIS'FIGHT SCENE!  While I can understand the commentary explanation that it interferred with the whip-fights pacing, I'm sure a competant editor could have moved it somewhere else.  I honestly can't help but feel that it was cut because of the old paranoia that action movies can't be intellegent, and hence can't hold attention for a full standard two hours or longer, despite the Matrix and LOTR films.  That's why this movie was cut down to an hour and forty-five minutes, removing not only Travis' showdown with the henchman guy, but also an extended arrival that made it clear the scotsman wasn't just an indifferent pilot, but did feel some desire to see Hatcher go down.",1082246400,,1242,4.6438356164383565

3714354,5,B0009NJFPO,"This movie is truly Rock-solid; the inimitable pro-wrestler turned actor admirably struts his stuff here in terms of sheer muscular star power and heavyweight charisma, and proceeds to turn the Amazonian jungle upside down in the process. This is certainly no dramatic masterpiece, but all of the cast are excellent in this incredible action movie, especially Christopher Walken, doing a turn as a witty yet egomaniacal villain who simply isn't prepared for the consequences as `Beck' (the Rock) arrives on his doorstep in his part of the jungle to retrieve the errant son of a gangster he is indebted to. The murder and mayhem that ensue make up two hours of first class entertainment as we find Rock against the world, and the world getting the worst part of the deal.
The movie is wonderfully photographed, and the comic moments flow from the opening sequences, when Beck step into a crowded bar to retrieve a debt from a pro football player. The ensuing madness is so well choreographed and played out that it is entirely believable despite the fact that it is strictly super-heroics that the character Rock plays has to deliver to punch, elbow, and drop-kick the whole offensive line of a pro football team in pursuit of his man. Likewise, the bar-room fight scene that sets up the rest of the movie once Beck arrives in Brazil is a study in athletic make-believe, so far out it is both fun and amazing to watch, as long as you can suspend your critical faculties long enough to not laugh out loud at the silliness of some of the supposed stunts. But the Rock never disappoints, and he always entertains!
Indeed, like some of the better early Schwarzenegger movies (e.g. `Predator'), the wit and winsome qualities of both the characters and the plot are indeed quite entertaining despite the fact we all know who is going to win, and thus have very little doubt as to how things will progress as the tale spins along toward its conclusion. Also, one can see that Rock is rising very quickly to fill the action hero void once held by Arnie and Sly Stallone. He has a lot of screen presence, and is a joy to watch in action. What's more, he seems to handle himself very well, and is quite believable on the screen, which is no small feat given the cartoon-like aspects of the story line. All in all, a great action flick, and one you will likely want to include in your video library. Enjoy!",1081987200,,2394,4.635294117647059

3714357,5,B0009NJFPO,"Anyone who has read my reviews knows I don't pander to crap.
A typical `bad'-good-guy-trying-to-clear-his-lfe flick, this film really is a fun movie to watch. First off, after The Scorpion King, I was sure The Rock's celebrity was destined to be one-dimensional. After this film, I have to admit I was wrong. He can act, he can do the tough scenes, and he can actually be funny in a long cut rather than short one-liners.
From Christopher Walken cast as a Jungle Gold Slaver, to Deklan, the moronic Scottish bush pilot no one can understand, this film is filled with a deluge of characters.
Sean Scott is the son of a gangster, and is living in the jungles trying to find `El Gato de Diablo' a gold artifact. The Rock is a truly honest strong-arm who hates guns (""Nasty things happen when I am involved with guns...""), and is hired to bring him home. Seems like a typical formula film. But every character, including the jujitzu forest rebels (""they are very short..."") is bizarre in their own right. And there is a slew of humor in this film (my favorite is The Rock getting face-humped by a Rhesis Monkey while he's hung up in a pig-snare, and Scott is yelling at him to be dominant...hilarious!).
Walken is...well...Walken, and a perfect choice in his role. He says every line in the Walkenesque prose we have learned to love.
Scott shows he can play the rough adventure hero. He gets his ASS kicked over and over. This kid has such a future...
The soundtrack accentuates, rather than creates, the scene and tempo. The action sequences are a la Brian De Palma (quick clips, snap close-ups) and there's a bit of the Matrix thrown in. The whip-fight scene near the end is phenomenal!
This flick was FUN. A great mix of humor and adventure. And I can see a sequel with Scott and the Rock coming.

3714358,2,B0009NJFPO,"This flick is carried by the charisma of THE ROCK.  The plot, which centers around a 'recovery specialist' named Beck (THE ROCK) who is sent to the Amazon to collect the son of a mobster (SCOTT) who is on a treasure hunt, is solid at its base, but way too top heavy with silly fight scenes, hit or miss humor, and MTV style direction.  This is one of those films that doesn't take itself seriously, hence the action/adventure angle is always on either side of the goofy line between funny and exciting.  You can't help but like THE ROCK, there is something about him that captures your attention, but by the end of THE RUNDOWN, you feel slightly embarassed for him.  It will be nice after a couple more movies to see him in full-on TOTAL RECALLish action mode.

3714359,4,B0009NJFPO,"As far as action-comedies and buddy flicks go, ""The Rundown"" is just about as good as it gets.  It also introduces The Rock to the general public as the forerunner of the next generation of action movie stars; someone who has the physical chops to truly be as menacing as his on-screen persona, but also can play self-deprecating humor quite well.  In fact, it's the humorous bits The Rock played (screaming at monkeys; ""these guys kick HARD!"" although that latter bit never made it into the final film) that stuck in my memory the most as the most entertaining bits of the movie and showed a dimension to The Rock that longtime wrestling fans always knew were there, but which has not been displayed before the general public until now.  The Rock proved that he can carry a film all by his lonesome with this movie, and solidified himself as a force in the action movie genre for some time to come.
Seann William Scott, much to my surprise, comes off as something more than another typecast Stiffler character, which is admittedly his greatest strength.  He convincingly plays a character who should be despicable and loathesome to the audience, but by the end of the movie, Scott has managed to make him sympathetic and praiseworthy.  Unlike the role played by Johnny Knoxville in the recent ""Walking Tall"", Scott's role in ""The Rundown"" is much more important than comedic relief.  It's through him that Beck (The Rock's character) comes to terms with the conflicts inside himself.
Rosario Dawson's character could have been easily written off as annoying or just plain far fetched.  A beautiful, female rebel leader who speaks perfect English and works as a barmaid by day?  Ridiculous.  But Dawson plays the character so convincingly that you quickly forget the ludicrous premise.
To director Peter Berg's credit, he appears to simply get out of stunt coordinator Andy Cheng's way with the fight scenes and allows Cheng's strengths to shine through.  There is a marked difference in quality between the fight scenes in ""The Rundown"" and ""Walking Tall"".  ""The Rundown"" exhibits more kinetic, frantic and poetic fight scenes that are simply beautiful to watch.  They can be watched again and again.
The bonus features of this DVD should be better labelled.  On the first screen of bonus features, one can view more features by clicking on ""Back to Menu"" (or something like that) at the bottom of the screen, even though that function would appear to take you back to the title screen.

He portrays Beck a wannabe restaurateur and ""retrieval expert"" for loan shark Billy Walker.  However, Beck wants out of the business.  Walker makes him a deal.  Retrieve his son Travis (Seann William Scott) from the Amazon and all is even.
From the very beginning there is pure action with Beck fighting single handedly against five gigantic professional football players in a nightclub.  Beck always one to give a person options (usually ""A""- the easy way or ""B"" - the hard way) doesn't like using a gun.
Beck heads to Brazil for Travis and there he faces an assortment of obstacles from Travis himself, a crazy pilot with a plane held together with duck tape, his jeep going over a cliff, walking lost through the jungle, aggressive attaching monkeys, a local rebel faction who thinks he's the enemy, numerous fights, shoot outs and a ruthless mining magnet named Hatcher (Christopher Walken) with his psycho paid band army.  It seems that Travis has discovered the whereabouts of an ancient priceless artifact that everyone is after while Beck just wants Travis to go back home.  Rosario Dawson adds the feminine touch in this male dominated film.  She is a bartender by day and rebel leader by night.
The Rock displays action skills, depth and charisma.  Seann William Scott is funny and quirky.  Rosario Dawson is sincere and tough.  And Christopher Walken is well in yet another film.

THE RUNDOWN is a higher energy, slightly less entertaining remake of almost the same story.  Thankfully for us the audience there is not one boring moment in the movie and it is fun the whole way through.
Rock in this film plays Beck, a quoted ""Retrieval Expert"" who specializes in picking up collatoral from deadbeats or troublemakers who owe money, favors or whatever.  After a job goes sour, Beck demands out of the business so he can pursue his own future but his boss tells him he has one more job:  Travel to the Amazon, pick up his son Travis and bring him home.  Piece of cake right?  Sure it is.
Beck quickly finds the amazon a place not to be triffled with.  His destination is a gold mining town (slave labor camp) run by it's iron fisted ruler (Christopher Walken complete with bad guy hat).  The jungle, as his screw loose pilot tells him is full of poisonous animals and rebels and if thats not enough, Becks quarry Travis has got a motor mouth, who for the life of him can't keep his mouth shut after Beck makes it crystal clear, ""your going home, no breaks"".
That doesn't prove to be the case as Travis has gotten into trouble with Hatcher, Walkens character.  Hatcher knows Travis is on the verge of finding a rare idol that can be worth millions on the Black market.  Beck gets in the middle and helps keep the idol out of Hatchers hands and his hands on Travis so that he can't get away.
One thing about THE RUNDOWN is the things that surprised me.  First of all I'm not a big wrestling fan and I at first dismissed Rock as ""a dumb wrestler"".  I was wrong.  He was funny and kept the action for the most part real even though the stylized action in this movie is off the chart.  Seann William Scott as Travis also surprised me in that he was funny and had the skill to pull off the role.  It's roles like this that I hope make people forget he was in those turgid American Pie sequels.  In a rare move, Beck our hero avoids guns.  He tries to rely on his fists and skill to win.  Even after fights in the movie when he gets his hands on a gun, he casually discards it.
Rock is clearly the best of the new line of action star.  He's younger then Arnold, less stodgy then Seagal and is more likable then Cage.  When somebody out there said that Rock was selected as the most likly candidate as Arnolds replacement in the Terminator movies, I believed it.  Purists everywhere won't give him a chance, but I will, I bet he could do a great job in that role.  He certainly did here.",1080777600,,2647,4.2730923694779115

It didn't leave me wanting to remember why they were fighting, just that the fight was good. The comedy was not slap stick... just natural time & place humorous adventure.

This is a by the numbers action flick, in which the Rock plays a bounty hunter sent to Brazil to retrieve the son of his boss, played by Sean William Scott, or Stiffler, as everybody knows him. The combination seems ridiculous from the start, but it actually works on some level. The two have surprising comic timing, giving this movie some funny moments.
The action here is pretty good, as there are some good old fashioned fist fights. It's nice to see a movie where every action sequence is not kung-fu or something like that, because it has already become a cliche after only a few years in popularity. Good scenery as well, shot in the Amazon forest in Brazil, looking very lush and impressive.
Overall, this is a worthwhile action movie, one that could surprise alot of people. There is some hope for The Rock, as long as he stays away from that Mummy franchise and makes slightly more intelligent choices with his career. If he strays as much as possible from his wrestling career, then he could gain tons of credibility in the movie world, in my opinion, maybe one day even going by his real name instead of a cheesy nickname.",1080604800,,1400,4.515748031496063

3714370,4,B0009NJFPO,"The film focuses on a bounty hunter named Beck ( WWE's The Rock)who works for a loan shark named Walker ( William Lucking). Beck longs to get out of the business and open up a restraunt. Walker agrees to release Beck of his obligations if he pulls one last job. That job consists of Beck traveling to Brazil to bring home Walker's son Travis ( Seann William Scott). Travis is currently trying to find a priceless and ancient artifact refered to as ""The Gato"" which is a solid piece of gold in the form of a cat. Beck assumes that it will be an easy job. However, when he gets to Brazil, Beck discovers a local slave driver/ gold prospector named Hatcher ( Christopher Walken) who needs Travis to lead him to The Gato. Now Beck must not only deal with Hatcher and his men, but Travis's repeated escape attempts as well.
Before I watched ""The Rundown"" I had some serious doubts. I have been a fan of the WWE for years, and I respect The Rock as a sports entertainer. But after seeing his last film ""The Scorpion King"" it became apparent that The Rock could not act his way out of a paper bag. However, after watching The Rundown, I was majorly suprised at how good this film turned out to be. It is incredibly similar to ""Midnight Run"" because it involves action, comedy, and aspects of a buddy flick. At times, this film is funnier than Midnight Run because it is set in the jungles of Brazil, and Beck and Travis must deal with crazy villagers, sex crazed monkeys, etc.. This provides for a lot of entertainment. The Rock actually did a very good job. He was smooth when he delivered his dialogue, he did very well in the fight scenes, and he brought aspects of his WWE character into the role with his skill for comedy and even a ""rock bottom"" in one of the fights. Seann William Scott also did a very good job and worked extremely well off of The Rock. Christopher Walken and Rosario Dawson also did a nice job in their roles as well.
While ""The Rundown"" might not be the best movie ever made, it offers a solid mix of action and comedy, and turns into the best buddy flick that I have seen since ""Midnight Run"". The fight scenes were extremely well choreographed, and all of the actors did a nice job in their roles. This is definately a film that enforces the rule of "" don't judge a book by its cover"" because I went from thinking this film was going to stink, to buying it shortly after I watched it. The DVD itself brings excellent picture and sound quality, as well as some cool extras.

Once in Brazil, Beck finds that Travis is beholden to a man named Hatcher (Christopher Walken), the megalomaniacal owner of a huge gold-mining operation. He becomes embroiled in a  race to find an ancient treasure hidden in the jungle that is sought by Travis, Hatcher, and the local tribespeople who want to free themselves from Hatcher's mines.

""The Rundown"" is a comic action adventure movie. It has a silly plot and acrobatic fight sequences that are more preposterous than anything from The Rock's pro wrestling career. But if you can get past that, ""The Rundown"" features 3 good comic performances that are the backbone of this film. The Rock is often compared to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone, but he's a lot funnier. And whereas Schwarzenegger and Stallone are known for their stoic countenances, The Rock has an unusually expressive face, which he puts to good comic use here. Pro wrestling fans may like Beck's fight sequences, but a wider audience will enjoy his comic scenes. Seann William Scott once again proves that he's an actor who will do anything for a laugh as Travis, a kooky would-be archeologist. And Christopher Walken's deadpan delivery of Hatcher's ruthless, preposterously funny lines is priceless. These three actors are the only thing that makes ""The Rundown"" watchable. But if you're a fan of The Rock, Walken, or Scott, this might be worth seeing. It's no surprise that The Rock is a competent action star, but even a mediocre film like ""The Rundown"" shows him to be a very charismatic screen presence with a good deal of comic talent. Better script next time, hopefully.

The DVD: This is a nice package for a single disc. Bonus features include 2 audio commentaries, 6 featurettes, deleted scenes, a DVD-ROM (Windows only), and bios for cast and crew. One audio commentary is by director Peter Berg and The Rock. The other is by producers Kevin Misher and Marc Abraham. The featurettes: ""Rumble in the Jungle"" is a documentary about the film's fight scenes. ""The Amazon, Hawaii Style"" is about re-creating and filming the Brazilian jungle in Hawaii and features a lot of mutual comic criticism by The Rock and Seann William Scott. ""Appetite for Destruction"" is about the film's special effects. ""The Rundown Uncensored"" is a faux (spoof) documentary about The Rock's illicit onset relationship with the film's baboon star, Camilla. ""Running Down the Town"" is about the creation, in California, of the small Brazilian rain forest town where the film takes place, narrated by production designer Thomas Duffield. ""Walken's World"" is about the Hatcher character and his domain. All featurettes include interviews with the film's stars and director Peter Berg. Looking for a simple making-of documentary? Try ""Rumble in the Jungle"". Like the film's humor, particularly in the style of Seann William Scott? Try ""The Amazon, Hawaii Style"" and ""The Rundown Uncensored"". ""Running Down the Town"" is impressive, if you're interested in production design. The disc has 3 unavoidable previews before the film.

3714373,3,B0009NJFPO,"The Rundown

 The Rock has nailed himself another movie. The Rundown stars Dwayne Johnson, a.k.a. The Rock, as Beck the ""retrieval expert."" This  movie was much better than last years The Scorpion King, and definitely had more of a plot.

 Beck's mission takes him deep into the Amazon, to a town called El  Dorado. El Dorado is run by a ruthless warden named Hatcher (Christopher  Walken), who has turned his people into slaves. He runs the kind of town  where you work all day, and hand in all of your earnings at the end in exchange for food, and shelter. Beck is assigned to bring a treasure hunter
named Travis (Sean William Scott) back to his father in L.A. Obviously he doesn't wan to go back, so he wrecks their Jeep, and sends them down a hill, and deep into the jungle. Now their stuck, and the movie takes time for some humorous fights with village people, and crazy monkeys. This part of the movie gives us a twenty minute humor break until Christopher Walken's
character arrives, and terrorizes the village people they are staying with.

 There is also another sub-plot about a golden cat statue that Hatcher wants as well, and this gives reason to capture a few people and create tension. Everyone has something different they want to use it for, Travis wants to sell it on eBay, Mariana (Rosario Dawson) a local bar tender, wants to use it to help her people, and Beck doesn't care either way. The only thing he's interested in is getting back home, and opening his own Italian restaurant. This movie makes a classic example of Christopher Walken's line: ""Hero wears a normal hat, sidekick wears a funny hat, villain wears an ugly hat."" And Hatcher's hat is truly ugly, I wouldn't be caught dead in it. But I think Hatcher's only reason to wear his hat is to cover up his hideous hair-do.

 Overall, the movie was pretty funny, and had some great scenery; but some of the fight scenes were over the top, and there was clearly some wire action going on. In some scenes, the Rock will be beaten to a pulp, then stand up and smile, revealing one or two bruises. The movie got a little old after a while, too.

Rated PG-13 for adventure violence, and crude dialouge. Fist fights, knife fights, and shootouts. Your classic adventure movie. Not too graphic of course. A little crude humor here or there too. Not too crude, though. A bit of language as well.

In his own unique way Arnie has made known the successor to his throne - Great. And Rock has shown he is worth it in the role of Beck.
It was the role of Christopher Walken though that I thought overshadowed everyone else's in the movie. His cool calculating presence with a menace lurking under the easy going facade. His lines - "" Thats a lot of cows"" and his crazy laughter before he anounces "" shut down the town"" are memorable and it makes you feel that you are watching a pro at work here. Great performance.

In ""I Spy"", those two totally lacked any chemistry and spontaneity together, adding friction to a relatively boring plot, whereas in ""The Rundown"", The Rock's and Seann's opposing quips and dialogue work together very well, yielding surprising results in the process. Beck (The Rock) is given orders to go to Brazil and bring back the son of a moderately well-to-do businessman (Scott). Once he is found, Travis refuses to go with Beck, and an ongoing series of melees ensues. Travis unwillingly ""agrees"" to remain in Beck's custody, all the while getting involved in a mysterious caper, headed up by an unscrupuolus leader of a band of Amazonian natives (Christopher Walken) and an Amazonian beauty (Rosario Dawson). What they're after, is a priceless ancient ""trinket"" known as ""The Gato"" - an artifact that's worth it's weight in gold. Our two male heroes are out to thwart Hatcher's (Walken) and ""The Amazon Queen""'s (Dawson) plan, that is, if Beck and Travis don't wind up killing each other first, to which they come extremely close to doing during parts of their tumultuous journey. Here's ""The Rundown"" of some brief facts concerning this movie: The locale of the Brazilian landscape is actually substituted for the beautiful scenery and majestic greenery of the Hawaiian island of Oahu (for obvious budgetary reasons, as well as any avoidance of paying foreign taxes), and the Brazilian ""natives"" are actually local extras, who would physically pass as Brazilian/Portugese, since Hawaii has traces of Portugese (""Portagee"" in local slang) heritage etched into its proud immigrant past. With a hearty, man-sized plot on its bountiful plate, including a rich, semi-all-star cast topping off the thick, zesty gravy (not to mention the well-manuevered, fast-paced action-packed physical adventure contained within these delectable ingredients), ""The Rundown"" is sure to please even the most persnickety of ""cuisinards"" - including both gourmet and standard fares. So, if you want to catch this breathtaking cinematic gem, here's ""The Rundown""; you can either A) view it at your local venue (which has pretty much passed, for the most part), B) or you can wait until it is released on DVD or VHS, or...there's option C), which means, should you decide not to view ""The Rundown"", ""The Rock"" and his WWE cronies will be sent personally to your home, thus ""Layin' The Smack Down"" on your ""candy a**"" (which is so not likely to happen, and BTW, I'm only kidding!!!).

3714385,4,B0009NJFPO,"Do you smeeeeeelll what the Rock is cooking? Well The Rock has been cooking up a whole load of goodies ever since his less then stellar debut on the WWF circuit. Not only has his popularity in the wrestling ring improved greatly from the days of ""Rocky Sucks!"" but he has been able to do what few fellow wrestlers can: Break away with a successful acting career. After a largely hyped appearance in The Mummy Returns, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson starred in the Mummy spin-off film, The Scorpion King, which was able to gross $84 million in the summer of 2002 and have him labeled as the next action star. Universal Pictures, seeing the great investing potential of this former wrestling icon, quickly signed him up with his next project teaming The Rock up with Seann William Scott, who has already had success this year with American Wedding. Dwayne Johnson has been able to work well in the action area but can he bring comedy into the mix? The studio definitely hopes so after investing $75 million in The Rundown (aka ""Helldorado"" aka ""Welcome to the Jungle"") and releasing it in a time period that is not known to have too many top earners.
The story centers on a hit-man who's out for one last job but this small assignment is more then he bargained for. Beck, an efficient man for hire, is not the normal kind of person in his line of profession. He gives people options, he would prefer cooking to fighting, and hates to use guns. After a brawl in a bar one night, Beck decides he wants out but his boss isn't going to let him off so easy. He sends him out on one more job: Travel to the Amazon, picking up his no-good son, and bring him back to the house. If he completes the job, he gets out of the hit-man profession and can open his own restaurant, the one thing he seems most passionate about. Beck believes this will just be another typical job but things change quickly. Not only does he have to deal with horny monkeys and quarrelsome natives, Beck knocks horns with Hatcher, the ruthless tyrant of Helldorado. Both men are after the same thing and both will do anything to get him but the question lies on who wants him more? The story for The Rundown is, quite surprisingly, fabulous. This is quite possibly one of the most original action/comedy films of the year with a wonderful blend of well choreographed fight scenes, hilarious comedy, and a balanced story to back it all up.
Though the cast is small, most members perform beyond expectations while others achieve the normal acting level. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson flattens Stalone, Willis, and even Schwarzenegger becoming the next cultural action star. Every fight sequence is packed wall to wall with high testosterone action and The Rock proving he can kick some serious ass in a grand style. And who knew he could be so funny? Well, a good amount of people who saw him perform on Saturday Night Live last year, but outside of that group, not many. For those not lucky enough to catch that one of the few truly funny SNL episodes in recent years (And, yes, the show has been pretty bad for a couple of years now), he proves all the skeptics wrong in this film. Seann William Scott, who performed earlier this year in Bulletproof Monk and American Wedding (the latter being the much bigger success), sure proves he has the comedic idiot act down pat though not as hilarious as he was in the last American Pie film. Perhaps it was the absence of using the F-bomb so many times but maybe it was the fact that the movie-going public isn't use to seeing him as the idiotic yet nice guy in comedies. Christopher Walken, as usual, never fails to amaze us. Once again he is able to mix comedy and drama well together without balancing one or the other. There were several jokes made by the talented actor that took awhile to get the point of but when the punch-line came, the jokes really paid off. And Rosario Dawson, a not too well known performer, was moderate at best but the main problem was that, as semi-important as her character was, wasn't featured as much as she should have been. There weren't too many that showed off her acting chops, which is quite a shame since there could have been plenty of potential had they allowed her to showcase her talent.
Overall, The Rundown smashes, blasts, and bombards the movie theater with everything its got and, quite surprisingly, the audience is left wanting more, which, for once, isn't a bad thing. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson proves he can live up to all the hype declaring him as this generation's action star and shows off some true acting chops that few from his former line of work can do. As good as the film was, it wasn't quite as funny as other comedies like American Wedding were. The problem lied in the fact that The Rundown took awhile to really get going by setting up a decent back story and stuff like that, which can be good on its own but when you're dealing with a buddy comedy such as this, it can come off as being a bit of a disappointment. The time length of the feature seemed a little too short but this is quite a minor squabble compared to all the praise one can say about this film. The Rundown is another valiant effort from The Rock and Universal Pictures that proves action flicks can be funny, intense and dramatic all in the same feature without outbalancing itself.",1073088000,,5320,4.513989637305699

He wants to leave the business and run his own restaurant, but he gets stuck on one last assignment - bring the loan shark's son home because he went and got himself in trouble.
So Beck heads down to South America to get the son, Travis (played by Sean William Scott, aka Stiffler from American Pie).  It turns out to be a little harder than he thought because Travis is off searching for an artifact in the jungle and the local bad guy (Christopher Walken) wants to nab the artifact once Travis gets it. Rosario Dawson plays the eye candy bartender with a hidden agenda.
The action scenes are great - especially the climactic scene at the end.  They are especially fun because Beck hates guns, so he has to kick butt without using them.  There are a few scenes that I felt the film would have been much better without - the main ones being the monkey scenes which I just felt were unnecessary, juvenile and NOT funny.

3714390,3,B0009NJFPO,"THE RUNDOWN stars ex-wrestler and NFL wannabe Dwayne Johnson (aka The Rock) in a mishmash of just about every sort of action flick you've ever seen. It incorporates elements reminiscent (to me at least) of the Matrix, Indiana Jones, Jackie Chan, Romancing the Stone, Lethal Weapon, the Terminator, and Mad Max. Ok, ok - maybe I'm exaggerating. But you get my drift?
John is Beck, a ""retrieval specialist"", sent by his boss to the Brazilian Amazon jungle to recover his errant son, Travis (Seann William Scott). Trouble is, Travis doesn't want to leave - he's too busy tracking down an artifact of native treasure, a solid gold statue hidden in the jungle. This trinket thrusts Beck and Travis between battling armed nationalists, led by bar-owner Mariana (Rosario Dawson), and the stereotypic Evil White Man, Hatcher (Christopher Walken), whose empire is an enormous open-pit gold mining operation worked by downtrodden locals kept in line by whip-wielding thugs.
To my mind, THE RUNDOWN is saved by the likeable Beck and a strong performance by Walken. Otherwise, it's just a series of confrontations, mostly kung-fu action sequences, with a gun battle and a vehicle chase thrown in for variety. Mariana simply serves as eye-candy.
Is The Rock destined to be the next generation Tough Guy action hero? Perhaps. In a blink-of-an-eye cameo at the beginning of the film, Arnold Schwarzenegger passes Beck on the way out of a nightclub and says"" Have fun!' Arnie is off to be Governor of California, leaving the heavy lifting to his successor.
This isn't a bad movie, and is an entertaining introduction to The Rock as a leading man of the genre. I just hope the plots of his future releases are a little more focused and, um (dare I say), intelligent. Also, THE RUNDOWN ends with the impression that Beck and Travis will continue on as a team. Oh, I hope not since the latter is one of the more clownish and irritating characters I've seen on the Big Screen lately. There's not the chemistry between the two as between Gibson and Glover (of the LETHAL WEAPON series), or Wilson and Chan (of the SHANGHAI series), or Smith and Jones (of the MEN IN BLACK series).

3714393,5,B0009NJFPO,"Personally I didn't think much of this film when i saw the previews. After the horrible  ""scorpian king"" rocky shows us he can act and is very funny. Same kind of humor he's shown in ""saturday night live"" At first i didn't think much of the film, but now that you look at it it has a Quasi allstar cast. They all are funny and they all CAN ACT!. very fun very very fun! HONEST! have i ever steered ya wrong. You can't go wrong with ""Stifler"" from american pie. He alone with his semi qwerky semi sarcastic sense of humor could carry the film. But he makes a great team with ""the rock"" and christopher Walkens Is extrememly funnyas the villain. And we have the sultry rosario dawson! what could go wrong?... well alot But its good! I PROMISe

3714394,4,B0009NJFPO,"Director Peter Berg has crafted a well-paced action movie. Some clever choices, such as the ""player stats"" in the opening sequence, and some quick edits make the movie interesting to watch.
The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) becomes a movie star here. While his last effort, ""The Scorpion King,"" suffered from a rehashed script, he stood out. This time, the script is ever-so-slightly better. But the charisma that Johnson brings to the role of Beck is what makes it work. He's obviously been working on his acting skills as well.
Christopher Walken makes the most of his latest bad guy role. He's played it a hundred times before, but he's always interesting to watch. As is Rosario Dawson, though she seems to have a little trouble keeping her accent in tact throughout the movie.
Overall, it's a fine summer movie that just got released in September instead of June.",1065398400,,860,4.857142857142857
3714395,4,B0009NJFPO,"The Rundown, directed by Peter Berg (Very Bad Things)and starring The Rock a.k.a Dwayne Douglas Johnson, Seann William Scott, Rosario Dawson and Chrisotper Walken is one cool, action flick.
  The Rock, who plays the natural action hero shows us he can act (much better than in the dreadful, ""The Scorpion King"") as well as his softer side.  Seann William Scott is funny and amusing as always, though he's best known for playing Stifler in the ""American Pie"" films.  Rosario Dawson, (looking better) pulls off her role too as a rebe leader of a village and who could forget Christopher Walken as our villan playing a typical role here, who is also reasonbly amusing.
  The storyline to this movie is nothing amazing, but it's a little different than the formulaic plots to a lot of action films coming out these days.  The Rock plays Beck, a bounty hunter who is collecting debt for his mob boss.  Though he wants out of the business and wants to retire to open up a restaurant his boss says that he has to do one more job for him, in which he'll gain 250 thousand dollars.  He of course agrees, this time to rescue his boss's estranged son in the Amazon.  The film takes on an interesting path from here with nice and new might I add action sequences.  With stylish stunts done by the big guy himself.  This film is pretty humorous too, mainly due to Scott and The Rock, the rapport between them is well portrayed.  Rosario Dawson plays the love interest of Scott as a  rebel leader who is more deceptive and dangerous than she seems.  And Walken plays a mine owner who is on their trail when he finds something of interest to him that Scott's character has.
  The Rundown is rated PG-13 for Adventure Violence and Some Crude Language.  There are mainly intense but bloodless gun, knife, and whip fights.  Also some nice fighting sequences, which are well choreograped and different.  There is also toilet humor, reasonably mild sexual innuendo and as stated earlier some crude dialogue & language.  Worth seeing in theatres as I have luckily and possibly owning on Video or DVD.",1065225600,,2079,4.656593406593407
3714396,4,B0009NJFPO,"In life, it is often good to have a career that combines your talents and interests as there can be nothing more frustrating than not being able to utilize your talents to their full extent. For Beck (The Rock), his talent for finding people who do not want to be found has made him a very in demand individual albeit reluctantly. Beck longs to get out of the business and start his own restaurant, but a poor decision from his past has caused him to work for until his debt is repaid.
Hope arrives for Beck when he is sent to South America to retrieve son Travis (Sean William Scott) who has caused issues for his father and must return to make amends. Beck is promised $250,000 and a complete erasure of his debt upon completion of the assignment. With the chance to at last open his restaurant in sight, Beck arrives in El Dorado and locates in a mining town that is run with an iron fist by a man named Hatcher (Christopher Walken), and his army of goons.
Beck is allowed to take Travis home for a fee but things do not go as planned, as Beck and Travis seem find themselves at odds with Hatcher and running for their lives into the dense jungles.
An interesting subplot to the film has Travis looking for a valuable artifact known as El Gato that has great interest to a local lady named Mariana (Rosario Dawson), who sees the idol as a chance to release the towns people from the control of Hatcher who also covets the artifact for his own needs. What follows are some humorous and segments as Beck and Travis verbally and physically spar with one another, rebels and over amorous monkeys as they attempt to avoid Hatcher and reach the airfield.
What makes ""The Rundown"" work is the solid chemistry between The Rock and Scott who seem to be having a great time making the film. The action in the film is fun and blends in well with the humor without being forced. Walken is good as the comedic yet evil Hatcher and gets the majority of the films best lines. Yes the story is not that deep but director Peter Berg keeps things moving at a steady pace and makes ""The Rundown"" a pleasant surprise and should establish The Rock firmly as an action star to contend with.

After all of the buddy-action flicks I have seen, this one seems to succeed where they could not.  Everything comes together to make a funny and entertaining action/adventure movie.  Its very easy to follow through the plot and the action is probably the best you can get for a movie like this.  Not only that, but its easy to see what is going on!  No crappy camera work or shady editing!  There are so many good parts to this movie!  I don't know how people didn't seriosuly get hurt in the stunts....maybe they did?

3714400,5,B0009NJFPO,"Option B- I MAKE YOU go see The Rundown.
  The Rundown marks the arrival of Dwayne Johnson, A.K.A. ""The Rock"" as a bona-fide movie star. As Beck, a ""Retrieval Expert"" who longs for a simpler life as a chef, he displays for the first time on film the humor and charisma that won him ""Millions....and MILLIONS!"" of fans in the WWE. Dispatced to the South American town of El Dorado (Called Hell Dorado by the locals) to fetch Travis Walker (Seann William Scott), the wayward son of his shady boss, Beck gets more than he bargained for. He finds Travis easily enough, but getting him home might pose more of a problem. Not only does Travis not WANT to go home, but local land baron Hatcher (The hilariously nutty Christopher Walken, at his eye-popping best here) won't LET him go...At least not until Travis finds a mythical golden idol for him. The Rock vs. an army of gun-toting slave-drivers......Place your bets!
  As I said earlier, The Rock is awesome in his role, bringing a mix of self-effacing humor and quiet strength to the mix, balancing out the potentially irritating Scott's whiny character. Walken is, as always, a joy to watch. His diatribe about The Tooth Fairy is worth the price of admission alone, and hearing him say ""Oompa-Loompa"" is sure to go down in history as one of my all-time favorite movie lines. Director Peter Berg shows himself to be equally comfortable with comedy and action; He keeps the film moving along at a brisk pace, and the action scenes are simply stunning- Not only are the fights choreographed beautifully, but the action is easy to follow, with none of the choppy editing and shaky photography that has ruined many an action movie.
  The Rundown is just what it portrays itself as: A fun buddy picture. I had a blast, and so did everyone else in the theater. If you're in the mood for action, The Rundown is a sure bet. If you smell what I'm cookin'.....",1064793600,,1898,4.617210682492582
3714401,5,B0009NJFPO,I was astonished on how good this movie was.  I really didn't think it was going to be that good.  The movie made me laugh so much.  It was definitly worth the time and money to watch that movie.  The Rock out does himself in the fight scenes which is great.  His work with Seann William Scott was incredible.  I think they should probably work together again.  This movie is a must see if you have nothing else to do or watch go to the movies and see The Rundown you will not be disappointed.,1064793600,,493,4.126315789473685
3714402,3,B0009NJFPO,"The Rock goes from bodyslamming his opponents in WWE rings to doing likewise to the bad guys in The Amazon in his second major starring role. Unlike his role in the somewhat boring ""Scorpion King"", a prequel to ""Mummy Returns"" with Rock reprising his role from that franchise, the big guy actually gets to do some acting in this one. He's no Al Pacino here but he does have some decent acting chops. He seems to be going that Vin Diesel route here.
The Rock is essentially a loan shark who is sent in by his boss to retreive a wise-cracking treasure hunter named Travis Walker (Sean William Scott). As one might guess, Walker is rather hesitant to give up his mission and go home. Enter Hatcher (Christopher Walken), a mean-spirited overseer of sorts who breaks his deal with Rock's Beck and this results in battle after battle. Along the way, the mismatched duo comes in contact with hyper monkeys, exploding jeeps, and a rebel group that just happens to be led by the local bartender.
""The Rundown"" has received some rather overblown reviews likening it to such classic buddy comedies as ""48 Hours"" and calling it one of the best action films ever. Reviewers like this seem to be so hypnotized by the ""star power"", thus ignoring a lot of other elements. Peter Berg gets props for the presentation. The action sequences look amazing but there are a lot of other things that aren't done so well. Looking beyond the glossy packaging, the script is thin. The comedic pairing of Rock and Scott is cute at times but nowhere near on the level of Nolte and Murphy or Gibson and Glover. Walken is always gonna be good but this is not one of his better roles. He is having fun with the role and so are we in watching him but he made for a much effective villian in the five minutes he appeared in ""True Romance"" then in the more than hour we get him here.
If you know what you are getting into, ""The Rundown"" is a real fun movie. I was not expecting too much from The Rock here but he surprised me. There is nothing ""landmark"" about this film though Berg's visual flare makes for something different. This movie is for the most part, a more visually-developed version of Deran Sarafian's ""Gunmen"" with a much more high-profile cast.",1064793600,,2224,4.521091811414392

It is the one movie in recent years that I am actually thinking about seeing twice in the movie theatre.
Go see it.
If you are squemish about blood, don't worry.  The Rundown has lots of action and violence, half of which is slapstick, but the blood is kept at a minimum.",1064707200,,503,4.239583333333333
3714404,4,B0009NJFPO,"Sorry, couldn't resist the pun. But in the same vein as ""Romancing The Stone,"" Indiana Jones"" and about a dozen other find the treasure in the jungle action-comedies, ""The Rundown"" succeeds as a big noisy popcorn flick. It also proves that The Rock can carry his own picture when surrounded with a cast of A-List actors.
It's worth noting the opening quick cameo with Arnold S., who, in a significant ""pass the torch"" moment, mutters ""have fun"" to our hero. And that The Rock does. There's enough scenery chewing here to feed a few starving nations, all of it delightfully shot in ""Brazil"" (ne: Hawaii). Christopher Walken is the baddy, but he does get to hammily play something other than a deranged villain for a change, Sean William Scott continues to grow into a mature comic actor, and Rosario Dawson gets the tough but gold-hearted female heroine in peril role. All suit their roles well. Given the generally disappointing action movies of the summer, it's nice that one was saved till fall to redeem the genre.",1064707200,,1017,4.784090909090909
3714405,5,B0009NJFPO,"""The Rundown"" takes place in the Amazon and has The Rock and Seann William Scott fighting each other. The Rock is Beck, a bounty hunter who has to do one more bounty in order to get his job and to have his own restaurant to be a chef. Seann William Scott is Travis Walker, the last bounty he is hunting. Travis is the son of Beck's boss, strangely enough. The beginning of this movie is dynamic with The Rock taking out a whole offensive football line. Unfortunately, when trying to grab Travis, Beck runs into a little trouble from Hatcher, played brilliantly by Christopher Walken, at a bar runned by Mariana, played by Rosario Dawson. Beck and Travis ended up in the Amazon jungle, trying to survive for their lives running from Hatcher. Unfortunately, they again, run into Mariana, who is strangely enough, the leader of the rebels. Travis, Beck and Mariana, look for the artifact that Travis is looking for. They find it, but, unfortunately, falls into Hatcher's hands, as does Mariana. Beck and Travis both return back into the town and get the artifact and Mariana back. The ending is amazingly funny and brilliant. The movie is excellent and I very much recommend it. Go see it any time.",1064707200,,1195,4.668246445497631
3714406,4,B0009NJFPO,"In ""The Rundown,"" the Rock plays a ""retrieval expert"" named Beck, whom we first meet when he has to get either $50,000 or a ring as collateral from a NFL quarterback (Stephen Bishop), who is hanging out at a club with some of his teammates.  When his initial overture is rebuffed, Beck checks in with his boss, pointing out that the QB has his entire offensive line with him.  But the concern is not over the obstacle that these hulking gridiron giants might pose to him, but that the team has a chance to make the playoffs again.  The clear implication is that if Beck gets rough, the boys will be out of commission, and the tone he takes shows that the Rock has found the perfect note for creating his big screen persona.
This is just the prologue to the main adventure, which is when Beck is sent to the Amazonian jungle to retrieve Travis Walker (Seann William Scott), the wayward son of his employer.  If Beck does this he can pay off his own debt and get the startup money for his dream: a restaurant.  Travis is looking for the Gatto, a legendary ancient artifact made of gold.  Unfortunately he is doing this on the land owned by the evil Hatcher, who is exploiting the natives right and left.  Hatcher is played by Christopher Walken, who has another one of those legendary moments in his career when he tries to explain the idea of the tooth fairy to his troops through an interpreter.  There has to be a woman in this type of movie, and here the lady is Mariana (Rosario Dawson), who does a lot more than tend the local bar.  Basically, everybody wants Travis and/or the Gatto, complicating Beck's life, and that is before we throw those fun loving jungle monkeys into the mix.
The Rock sets the tone for the film, Scott supplies the comic relief, Walken has fun chewing on the luscious scenery, and Dawson provides the brains and beauty.  Scott takes a half-step back from the quantum leap forward he took in ""Bulletproof Monk"" in getting beyond the Stifler character from the ""American Pie"" movies, but he holds his own against the Rock.  It will certainly be interesting in the future to how both actors can build on what they have established here.  The film takes as much effort to set up the comedy sequences as the action ones, which is why the end result is pretty solid.
My only serious complaint with ""The Rundown"" is that the action sequences consist of a series of rapid jump cuts, which probably help to cover up the wires and mirrors and whatnot, but which also make it rather difficult to follow the action.  I understand this is the current language of cinema, a legacy spawned by music videos and fast paced commercials, put sometimes I just want a nice minute long tracking shot or to just have the camera stay put for a while.  But director Peter Berg certainly brings some flair to the proceedings.
""The Rundown"" is the best action-comedy of the fall, which is not exactly the most desirable honor to be won in Hollywood and rather surprising.  You would think a film that takes place in the jungles of Amazon (filmed in Hawaii) would be a natural to put out in the summer, but I guess that would make too much sense.  This is not a great action film, but it is a solid one, which is apparently the best we can hope for nowadays.  The title does not have any real meaning, besides initially paralleling the name of the film's star.  Producers ditched ""Helldorado"" and ""Welcome to the Jungle,"" which probably explains why the television spots are talking about the Rock rather than the film's title.",1064620800,,3529,4.530708661417322
3714407,5,B0009NJFPO,"The year started off with ""Daredevil."" Decent but not good enough. Lighter action films took place such as ""Agent Cody Banks"", ""The Core"", and then ""Bulletproof Monk."" Then a few bigger ones came like ""Bad Boys II"", ""Lara Croft Tomb Raidor The Cradle of Life"", ""SWAT,"" and ""The Medallion."" But none of those hold a candle to the fun, excitment, and action packed laughs as ""The Rundown"" the film where The Rock proves that he can be a good actor. He is joined by ""American Pies"" Sean William Scott and ""Catch Me If You Can's"" Christopher Walken, along with the help of Rosario Dawson of ""Men in Black II."" But I think that the best performance is The Rock. He started his acting career in 2001's ""The Mummy Returns"" but wasn't in it enough. He then took another movie spinoff of The Mummy in his ""Returns"" character ""The Scorpion King."" But the problem with that movie was that there was not enough dialouge to make me think of him as a good actor. It was mostly running or him doing his trademark look from wrestling. I don't think in any of the 104 minutes of ""The Rundown"" he does anything close to his trademark look.
In this movie The Rock plays Beck, an expect finder. He always gies people two options. For instance, in the beginning when trying to get a ring he gives them option A which is ""Give me the ring,"" or option B which is ""Have me make you give me the ring."" Most people always choose the latter which NOT the way to go. He then proceeds to give you the beating of a lifetime. But he wants to get out of that and open his own resturant. His boss Billy agrees to let him be out, as long as he does one last job for him. The job is to travel to Brazel, the jungle, to get Billy's son Travis, who has been in the jungle searching for treasure. But he's gotten into so much trouble that his father has had to bail him out of prison. He is flown there by Declan and thinks that finding Travis will be a quick job, in and out. But of course problems arouse. Beck meets Hatcher, a businessman who uses the locals as slaves to mine gold for him. Hatcher finds Travis for him but when he finds out that Travis knows where a great artifact is, he decides not to let Beck take him back to his waiting father. But a fight between Beck and Hatcher, has Hatcher and his men wanting to find Travis and Beck dead. They do flee into the jungle, with Travis sturggling to regain his freedom. They do get help from local bartender Mariana who is looking for the same artifact that Travis knows where it is, so she can liberate her people.
""The Rundown"" is loaded with action, effects, and comedy. It's loads of fun as well. It's not just a predictable action comedy, and they don't even use the character of Mariana as a love intertest to the character of Beck. Beck basically wanted to finsh the job so he can fullfill his dreams of becoming of chef in his resturant. I think that after this great work of film, The Rock can finally start starring in action movies that are worth seeing on the screen. His ""The Scorpion King"" was a good movie, but it's more of a movie that you rent rather then pay a large sum of money to see on the big screen. ""The Mummy Returns"" he had a very smaller part and it was his film debut so you pretty much didn't know what to expect. But he is a movie star now, because ""The Rundown"" proves it.
ENJOY!
Rated PG-13 for adventure violence and some crude dialogue.",1064534400,,3393,4.270186335403727
3714408,4,B0009NJFPO,"In THE RUNDOWN, Dwayne Johnson stars as The Rock who stars as Beck who's an enforcer for an LA mob boss who really wants nothing more than to open up a restaurant with the tips on food preparation he's learned from renowned chef Emeril (yep, the chef from the Food Network). However, for that to happen, Beck must do one last job for his employer. He must go to Brazil and ""rundown"" Travis (Scott), his employer's estranged son who has gone to Brazil to find a stolen treasure known as the ""El Gato"". As you can imagine, things don't go as planned and Travis and Beck find themselves fighting together against big gray monkeys with bare asses and big fangs, short but mean as hell Brazilian rebels, poisonous fruit, and of course, the always brilliant Christopher Walken.
At the beginning of THE RUNDOWN, Arnold Schwarzenegger (yes, California's ""soon to be"" new governor even though I wish he'd just do T4 and the next CONAN) passes the Rock in a crowded by bar and says, ""have fun"". That's it. ""Have fun"". It's great because it's almost as if Arnold is passing the action star baton to The Rock and with this movie The Rock really assumes the position of successor to Mr. Schwarzenegger.
With THE RUNDOWN, I must say, I was thoroughly impressed. It's a fun action comedy, which has just the right tone. It's never too serious and it's never too stupid. Director Peter Berg (I always think of him as the guy who referred to his father as ""da"" instead of dad in Wes Craven's forgotten but always fun to watch at Halloween film, SHOCKER) has done something I didn't think was possible these days. He created action scenes that came off as new and refreshing in a time when everyone else is still trying to be THE MATRIX. Congrats go out to Mr. Berg and The Rock, who with this film assures us that he has the potential to be a big action star.
I can't right this review either with out saying something about Stifler a.k.a Seann William Scott. What can I say? The man's funny. He's always been funny to me in an annoying kind of way. Maybe it's because I feel like I know people just like him. I don't know but I always find the guy funny. Anyway, Scott and The Rock end up making a good team and a couple of characters that are enjoyable to watch.
 In the end, THE RUNDOWN isn't the masterpiece of the millenium or anything but it is an action romp that makes for a hell of a good hour and a half at the movies and isn't that what makes the movies so much fun? The people there when I saw it thought so as applaud filled the room when the credits rolled. That's something I haven't seen in a while. So check it out. It's the type of movie that's fun to watch with an audience. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
