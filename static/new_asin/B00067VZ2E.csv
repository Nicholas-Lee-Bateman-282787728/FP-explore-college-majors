8040007,3,B00067VZ2E,"I bought this movie (Big Show) for one reason alone, which is that it was mostly filmed at the 1936 Texas Centennial at Fair Park, showing the Art Deco buildings as they existed then, including many buildings that no longer exist. For fans of Fair Park in Dallas, which is the largest collection of Art Deco exhibition halls in existence, it is a treat. For anyone else, it is a very pleasantly fun movie but not something I would necessarily buy unless I were a Western Comedy fan or a Gene Autry fan. The other movie, Springtime in the Rockies, I have not seen.",1231286400,,563,4.423076923076923
