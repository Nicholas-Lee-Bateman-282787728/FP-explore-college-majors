8726507,4,B012SP0ZJU,"I like the movie because I thought it was gonna be a boring movie, but actually the plot surprised me, and actually made me feel. Love some of the songs so catchy!!!!!!",1468800000,,168,4.28125
8726508,4,B012SP0ZJU,"A lot goes on in this film, so even though it's normal bollywood long, complete with 'interval', the overall pace feels rushed.  Too much slo-mo violence gave the production a cliche tone which was hard to shake given it's gangster noir styling.  Ranbir and Anushka both put in some character work, and the style is top notch.  Just wish the story had more engaging value.  At the end of the film, there's not a whole lot to pity except perhaps the loss of the talented singer.",1465516800,,477,4.511627906976744

8726511,3,B012SP0ZJU,"The VERY beautiful songs and lyrics can not redeem this dark thriller. Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma have no chemistry between them and the contrived story (Chinatown? L.A. Confidential?) is just that - contrived. Karan Johar's debut in acting after directing so many of Bollywood's evergreen masterpieces, is a pitiful event.",1449014400,,329,5.470588235294118
8726512,2,B012SP0ZJU,"This movie has some of the worst music I've heard in a long time.  And, even though the actors were OK, they could only be as good as their material.  I was very disappointed in the plot.  It was a poor steal from some of the old Hollywood black and white gangster movies.  And, Karan Johar should stick to producing and directing.",1447372800,,331,4.290322580645161
8726513,1,B012SP0ZJU,I couldn't get through this one.  I like the actors in other films but this one did not hold my interest.  It is very rare that I can't watch something to the end.  I would skip it.  I gave it one star because I thought the art direction was beautifully done.,1446681600,,259,4.019607843137255
8726514,5,B012SP0ZJU,"Nice Movie, I liked it.
I purchased the blurray disk for 12$ which is like a steal for an hindi movie (generally it is ~20). For this price, this movie is awesome. This is the first time that a decent view of the old Mumbai culture is shown in any movie. I totally agree that the screenplay is not as crisp as anybody would expect from a big star cast movie. Also the movie's story wasn't something seen for the first time, there are 100s of movies on similar line. It seem like Anurag (Director) made a movie which he and his producer believed in, but it has no commercial or movie craft quality, except for the filmography and special effects.

Looking at some of the other movies which Ranbir recently did (not sure why), Besharam, Roy etc, this movie is much better choice.

Pros: Location, Ranbir Kapoor, song visuals
Cons: Screenplay, songs

I still rate it 5 as for the price this movie is still a worthy buy.

Note: This movie is All Region, there is no issue playing it anywhere in the world.",1444867200,2,1001,4.394594594594595
