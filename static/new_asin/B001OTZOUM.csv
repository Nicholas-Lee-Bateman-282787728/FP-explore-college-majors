8331595,2,B001OTZOUM,"This is a Powerpoint-type presentation... slides with narration.  It covers 2 basic areas: simple candlestick formations and basic pivot points.  If you have ready any books or articles about candlesticks you already know half of what's covered on this DVD. If you understand basic support and resistance lines you already know what the other half of the DVD covers.  I was hoping to expand my knowledge on these subjects, but I didn't realize how extremely basic the scope of this DVD was.  It was a waste of time and money for me.  If you are a rank amateur and want a simple explanation of candlesticks and support/resistance spoon-fed to you, you might like this DVD.  Be prepared for frustration though, because the chapter titles that are used to access the information do not match the different topics.  In other words, to view chapter 1, I had to select chapter 3.  Fortunately, there were only 6 very short chapters.",1247961600,8,926,4.8164556962025316
