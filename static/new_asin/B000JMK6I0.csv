Written and directed by E. Paul Edwards, ""Fighting Words"" is a low-budget romantic drama set in the fringe world of slam poetry.  Jake Thompson (Jeff Stearns) is the pained poet and Marni Elliot (Tara T`Agostino) the HIV-positive book publisher who takes an interest in the promising young man's person and work.  C. Thomas Howell appears as a slime ball, cutthroat poet (and ex-boy friend of Marni) who will stop at nothing to keep Jake from winning a competition and the book deal that goes with it.  Fred Willard puts in an appearance near the end as the emcee of the contest.

The movie is certainly well-intentioned, and it earns at least a few points for its unusual subject matter, but an overall amateurishness in the performances and direction relegates it to minor league status.  Moreover, an air of contrivance in the storytelling - especially in the final third - goes a long way towards undercutting any credibility the film might have had.",1219536000,,961,4.865030674846626

In the beginning, there are about 5 minutes worth of early footage where the movie-makers sound like they know what they are doing. They manage to touch on two very salient and common feelings/occurences within slam....which could have led to some great, insightful work or at least entertaining musings, but both of these quickly go out the window and for the rest of the film....it becomes painfully obvious that any research into slam and performance poetry they may have done was cursory at best.

Throughout the movie, what we end up with is a jumbled mess of story-telling with no real resemblence to slam. The venues they shot in are ok, but they really have no sense of what slam is and since this is the foundation of the film that wrecks anything else they may have tried to accomplish.

What really made me angry with the lackluster and frankly degrading portrait they have painted here is that (A) everyone in the film is a victim...and a willing one. Nobody in the flm has the heart to stand up for themselves even once. Poetry is about finding your voice and all anyone in this move could do was whimper throughout.(B) Watching this, slam begins to look....boring.

Sorry folks, but slammers and poets alike can testify to a couple of things about slam poetry. It is always a dynamic, breathing entity. The poetry here, with very few exceptions was obvious, repetetive, end-rhyme heavy, and delivered perfunctorily as if they were taking out the trash.

Worse yet, they really tried to tout this as a sort of linguistic Rocky?! NOT EVEN CLOSE>>>>where that movie is about the triumph of the human heart, this one appears to be about being willing to lay down and watch as life rides over you. Poets can certainly be sad, pained, even victimized.....but they are also the curators of experience and minute details. To put it bluntly, this film should have been made by poets. At the least, they might have tried consulting a few....",1202083200,2,2038,4.732394366197183
