5616160,5,B00BG4RPLQ,"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer included here is David O. Selznick's 1938 version which is possibly the best adaptation from book to film I've ever seen.  Very accurate, very faithful.  They do away with one segment, but don't stint on the end result, so it works.  I also prefer the demise of the bad guy in this movie version.  Perhaps Aunt Polly reads as not as mean as they make her in the movie; perhaps Sid is much more snotty in the movie than the book; perhaps Huckleberry Finn is short-changed in the film, but these are minor considerations.  If you've been reading the book out loud to your young ones, this version is a sweet follow-up.  Where the Red Fern Grows is also well done, fairly accurate to the book, too.  Not as moving emotionally as the book, but a very nice movie for school-age to pre-teens.  And then you have The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn!  Three movies for the price of one!!  Good buy.",1373414400,7,918,4.475903614457831

5616174,2,B00BG4RPLQ,"Firstly I actually purchased and viewed the Echobridge release of these four movies unlike several reviewers who have given 4 or 5 stars for a product they haven't actually seen.

The release has 4 films: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938), Huckleberry Finn (1975) The Painted Hills (1951) and Where the Red Fern Grows (1974).

There are 2 redeeming features that elevate this release from 1 star to 2 stars.  The fact that it has four movies and is cheap as well as The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938) being an alright transfer. From there it's all downhill.

The buyer should first be wary that you are getting 4 colour movies on 1 DVD disc. That in itself should ring alarm bells about transfer quality.  Huckleberry Finn (1975) is below DVD quality and both The Painted Hills (1951) and Where the Red Fern Grows (1974).are very sub-par. In fact The Painted Hills (1951) is so bad in transfer quality it is hardly a ""bonus"". As usual there are no sub-titles.  If you intend watching these movies on a 1960s analogue TV then they are fine otherwise hunt for better releases.",1403481600,13,1077,4.6421052631578945
5616175,4,B00BG4RPLQ,"Didn't care for this particular Lassie - Don't recognize it and I grew up
with Lassie. I didn't think there was a Lassie movie that
I hadn't seen
.
However, I purchased this DVD for the original movie, re:  Tom Sawyer
This was great!!  I remember it from long ago and it was great to watch
this again with my family..

Love Ron Howard, but I'd have preferred  the original movie re: Huckelberry Finn
be included in this collection instead.",1402444800,,439,4.45

5616180,4,B00BG4RPLQ,I enjoyed Huckleberry Finn better because it was made in the 70s. The Tom Sawyer movie was made in the 30s so the quality of the film was not as good.  Both films however were true to the books which I appreciated.,1376524800,3,214,4.095238095238095
