It tells the broader story of the battle from the perspective of the individual soldier and how small units and single soldiers were what saved the day.  It portrays the tenacity and bravery of these men in such a way, you almost feel like you were there...it forces one to ask the question...what would I have done?  Many war documentaries and movies have been produced...this one stands apart on its own merits...nothing I've seen before compares to it...well worth the hour required to watch.",1342483200,2,612,4.764150943396227
8242885,5,B0011X976I,"There have been so many films made about World War II that sometimes they all sort of morph into the same film. This one is different and well worth watching. It profiles several unsung heroes of the Battle of the Bulge - previously unknown to all but their families. These are young men who gave their lives to hold back the German advance just long enough to accomplish a goal. One of these young men, Corporal Donald Hollenbeck, was my uncle, and he is profiled in this film. Even our family did not know just how he died, or how courageous he had been, until this film was made! This film takes a close look at decisions made by young American soldiers, without thought for their own lives, to give their army time to regroup in response to this last German offensive. Well-researched and filmed, this will not disappoint anyone.",1290816000,2,833,4.56
