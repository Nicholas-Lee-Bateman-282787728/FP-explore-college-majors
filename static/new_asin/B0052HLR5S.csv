4530054,3,B0052HLR5S,"Wish I could say the the 'Final Season' (4) of Showtime's ""Secret Diary of A Call Girl"" ended with a 'bang' but (for me) it was more of a 'thud'. I really got into the whole mythos of 'Belle de Jour' - read all of her books (based on the infamous blog that launched the series) and really enjoyed the way that the TV series initially portrayed the characters and sexy situations that (the real) Belle described in her autobiography. Billie Piper was gorgeous & fresh as the liberated call-girl with a heart of gold, the tension between characters was nicely balanced, the dialog saucy, and even the 'tricks' were interesting & believable - with just enuf skin to remind you that this was an 'adult' cable show. Things moved very smoothly thru the first 3 seasons. For those that are perplexed at the lack of availability in North America of the third season ( I agree - what the heck!?!) the 3rd Season IS out there but only in a Region 2 PAL version (available from Amazon. UK) - yet another good reason to get a 'region free' DVD player!

The 4th Season manages to chip away much that the show had working for it. Not to say that there aren't a few choice moments to be enjoyed during the 8 final episodes - but the series seems to have run out of gas (and ideas).  The edgey chemistry between Belle and her 'best mate' wanna-be boyfriend, Ben, devolves into a lot of unattractive squabbling when they try to attempt a live-in relationship and a somewhat annoying new character, Poppy (daughter of Belle's temporarily incarcerated 'madame', Stephanie) is introduced to further muck things up. A new, rather un-likable, male 'detective' character is also injected as a counter-foil to Ben adding yet more aggravation to the mix.  Generally,  everything seems taken a bit too much to the extreme - Belle's 'clients' fetishes become comically absurd (less 'human' & sexy) and the make-up and hair styles manage to make even the lovely Ms Piper look like a trashy streetwalker much of the time. Possibly some of this is 'intentional' as much of the drama of the series is based  on the duality of Belle's character struggling between wanting to be 'normal' but also loving the excitement and wealth that her escort business ensures.  Thus, despite the efforts to glamorize the 'pay for play' lifestyle - the old morality creeps in and the tawdry aspects of a 'life of sin' are emphasized via the make-up... one would have to imagine that the show's producers must own 'stock' in a mascara francise!  I noted there were a couple of 'new' directors for the final season and maybe it was their 'vision' that sorta changed the tenor of the show to one of shrillness approaching outright parody - where even the beautiful & sophisticated Belle is made to appear grotesque in numerous scenes. By the time the plot concludes in a tumultuous flurry of tortured indecision and a rather haggard looking Belle stalks resolutely off into the darkness with great rivers of black eyeliner streaming down her face - I was feelin': 'Yeah, enough already - time to wrap this one up!'.  Doubtless, die hard fans of the series will wish to see how it all culminates - but be prepared to be under-whelmed. I sincerely hope that the 'real' Belle/Hannah is having a happier time in her life than what was crafted for her celluloid counterpart's denouemont.",1313712000,10,3332,4.693493150684931

This fourth season is okay and I am happy to see Belle (Hannah) as she is progressing in life because I grew attached to her character in the first two seasons.

4530079,5,B0052HLR5S,"Had no idea they'd produced a 4th season! And why can't you buy the 3rd? Geesh...

That said, this series was fun! Billie Piper was made for a role like this and in retrospect, I truly wish this show had been backed by a network that could believe in it 100%. My favorite aspect to the 4th season was Charlotte, the Dominatrix who was divinely saucy. Love her!

I think the series continued to tackle the fascinating dynamics between high-class call-girls, escort services and their clients who often have very specific and peculiar needs. It also unfolds as more about Hannah's very busy, full and fabulous life that is ever-complicated by dueling needs, wants and desires. All the conflict is engaging, if not downright fascinating. She finds herself battling choices between a private life, a public life and being able to juggle both. Fun, playful, enjoyable. Good for those who enjoyed 'Sex & the City'. Similar type of episode-telling but with the class of the British. Love that it's based in London.",1421193600,,1007,4.848837209302325
4530080,2,B0052HLR5S,I really can't give this season any stars because I haven't watched it. My wife and I bought season 4 thinking that we had seen season 3 (it's been a while since we watched it). After watching the first 30 seconds we realized that we haven't watched season 3. I looked for season 3 but couldn't find it anywhere. Apparently it's not available in the US. I then wanted to return Season 4 because we are not going to watch it unless we can watch season 3 but Amazon doesn't allow you to return instant video so now we are stuck with it.,1420070400,,534,4.194174757281553

4530085,4,B0052HLR5S,I recalled this series from several years ago when it aired on Showtime. It deals with a British high end cal girl trying to balance her profession with her private life of family and boyfriend. The series is entertaining. It is a light-hearted drama. Despite the suggestive title it is not porn.  Billie Piper does a good job playing the role.,1402963200,,344,4.639344262295082
4530086,4,B0052HLR5S,"Really fun show to watch, particularly if you're tired of/having withdrawals of Sex and the City. The 4th season has the best costume design of the series. What's disappointing is that the series ended. There should have been a season 5 without Ben, and possibly with Belle crossing over into being a madame. You can tell that Billie Piper really found her stride in this season, not to mention that the director and producers kicked the fun into high gear over previous seasons. All in all it's good fun to watch, lots of eye candy, and gives you some great ideas, just didn't give the 5 stars because it wasn't enough.",1400025600,,620,4.594594594594595
4530087,4,B0052HLR5S,Enjoyed it but wish I could have seen season 3. Where is season 3 and why is it not available?,1398211200,,94,3.75
4530088,2,B0052HLR5S,"First three seasons were great with the show starting to derail by end of Season 3, resulting in a full train wreck (aka ""hot mess"") by the close of the final series, Season 4.  Storylines become ridiculous and convoluted, and the character development is unrealistic -- the protagonist becomes the antagonist by the close of the series.  You are ""so over"" Hannah/Belle's so called travails.  By the end of the series, the audience can hardly care what the main character decides to do with her life.  The writers and directors manage to transform the main character into a caricature of what had once been a self confident yet emotionally vulnerable prostitute.  It's what we love about Hannah/Belle.  In Season 1, Hannah/Belle is introduced to the audience as an intelligent woman who has made a calculated decision to earn her living as a call girl.  She is sexy and smart, possessing the self awareness that her body and sensual talents are a commodity like any other high demand product.  The writing is witty.  The lead character unapologetically loves how she makes her living, and it's not without sacrifice.  There is the tricky intersection of Hannah's life outside the professional world of Belle.  Hannah's relationship with her best friend and ex boyfriend Ben is an interesting complication, at least in the beginning.  The writers make the ill fated and formulaic mistake of Hannah and Ben realizing they love each other and be together as a couple.  It's all downhill from there.  Really?  Like we couldn't see the relationship demise from a mile away.  Special props to the Bambi character introduced in the third season.  The storyline of Bambi falling in love was actually kinda sweet.  Ashley Madekwe and David Dawson were great.  Cheri Lunghi is fantastic as Belle's madame.  End note: series finale is bizarrely Felliniesque (oxymoron), and I don't think it was meant to be.",1390176000,4,1896,4.977707006369426

4530094,2,B0052HLR5S,Only season 1 and 2 of this is worth viewing.  I wish I knew what season three was like---cant view it in the Usa because it doesn't fit with our dvd players or something like that.  Season 4 is boring and the boredom even shows on the actors faces I think,1377993600,,256,4.0
4530095,1,B0052HLR5S,"I watched one episode and that was enough. I feel like I have no idea what happened in season 3 and the show has completely changed. Obviously relationships between characters are going to shift, but I felt like the actors weren't capable of playing the same character anymore. Seemed very forced.",1368662400,2,297,4.8431372549019605
4530096,4,B0052HLR5S,A John has a vampire fantasy when he visits his favorite call girl. But this night he dies in his coffin. It's a new twist on an old profession. Worth a look.,1365897600,,158,3.96875
4530097,5,B0052HLR5S,"I was curious to watch ""Secret Diary Of A Call Girl: Season 4"" both because it is based on a true story and due to my previous familiarity with Billie Piper.  I own one of Billie Piper's greatest hits music collections (which is pretty good) and I have seen her in a few Dr. Who performances (also strong performances).  Billie Piper gives an excellent portrayal as Hannah Baxter. Hannah Baxter happens to be an intelligent high class escort who is incredibly gifted in her job.  Baxter's character is shown to be living in a lavish house and having clients from very affluent backgrounds. Hannah Baxter even ends up working temporarily as a London madam for her boss Stephanie (played in a fantastic way by Cherie Lunghi).  Snippets from the song ""You Know I'm No Good"" by the late Amy Winehouse are used for the theme of ""Secret Diary Of A Call Girl"". It is made very obvious in season four that she makes a good living as a high class call girl and is even offered the chance to have her life story translated into a movie.  By the way, the episode where the movie idea gets pitched to Hannah Baxter is extremely humorous.  Hannah Baxter also deals with strong professional competition from Charlotte (played in a convincing way by Gemma Chan). In season 4, Hannah Baxter must also choose between Ben (well played by Iddo Goldberg) or her job.  I confess that I think that ""Secret Diary Of A Call Girl: Season 4"" would make an interesting film.  Obviously, it would also be a good idea to consult with the woman that the whole series is based on (to strengthen the plot and message of the movie). ""Secret Diary Of A Call Girl Season 4""is best for those who like shocking and racy tv shows.",1365811200,,1692,4.506535947712418
4530098,5,B0052HLR5S,"This is a great series, and I really wish they would do more, and resolve some of the relationships that are left hanging in the balance...
What happened, Showtime? There was so much more to explore with her character. For instance, what does happen when her ""assets"" devalue? Does she settle down to a ""suburban hell"", (in her opinion), become a Madame like Stephanie, or does she get a REAL job?
Leaving these characters so lost and dangling was a bad call on the part of Showtime, and dropping this clever, cheeky dramedy for shows like ""Californication"", ""Shameless"" and ""House of Lies"". At least Belle is endearing and has redeeming qualities. She's honest about what she does and why she does it.",1359849600,,702,4.762295081967213
4530099,4,B0052HLR5S,"I really enjoy this show.  Billie is amazing to watch, and I find myself rooting for her always, even if I am not sure what I want most for her...Ben? maybe?..YES!  The only small thing I was a little upset with was that when she was in America she didn't meet even one semi-decent person.  Unfortunately they were all either stupid or misogynistic.  As an american, I love this show- please don't think we're all that way.  Yikes!",1357603200,,431,4.4743589743589745
4530100,2,B0052HLR5S,"Every season of this show was super amazing and good, except the final season.  It was awful.

4530103,2,B0052HLR5S,"SDoaCG has always been fun and racy, but much of what has made it great for me is the creativity of the writers and the great characters that I've grown to really like.  In Season 3 we had Bambi, a great character, getting romantically involved with a client, and Belle had some really interesting clients herself.  A romance gone wrong and another potential romance on the way. And Belle, as always, was brave and beautiful and so caring for her clients.

Something changed big time in Season 4. You immediately know it, b/c Belle has returned from a client getaway to suddenly be living in a house, rather than a flat - we don't get any explanation as to how this change happened so quickly, and the house doesn't add anything at all to the ambiance of the episodes, no character at all.  The opening credits music has changed dramatically - why would they change that detail in the final season? It sucks.  And two great characters - Bambi and her love interest - have disappeared with no explanation!  They are replaced with a whining college student and a dominatrix, who just don't fill in that gap very well and are mostly kind of irritating. (Okay, the dominatrix has a few fun scenes.)

I think the writers must have changed as well b/c it just doesn't have that playful romp and great dialogue that it used to. It seems ponderously heading towards its death after 8 episodes. And the final episode is just not terribly satisfying and seems really rushed. (Well, each episode is only about 21 minutes, so I guess they had to rush it!)

I would recommend that if you can get ahold of Season 3 (hard to in the US, might need to visit some file sharing websites), just watch that, finish up at the end of that season, and just skip Season 4. It doesn't even seem like the same universe as the previous 3.",1331164800,14,1810,4.480243161094225

8453937,4,B0052HLR5S,"I love series 1-3 and was worried when Showtime took over they were going to Americanize the show. Unfortunately, I was right. Series 4 is crap. Every time a British show is taken over by American producers, they completely ruin it, and this one is no exception. Gone is Belle/Hannah's humor, warmth, strength and vulnerability. This show was never supposed to be ""porny"" but Showtime made it just that, and the show suffers for it. Worse, they made it camp. If you haven't checked the show out yet, watch seasons 1-3, they're brilliant, but skip season 4 or you will be disappointed.",1509840000,,584,4.735294117647059

Wish Showtime would have really committed to it, esp Season 4, which was rather phoned in, but still watchable, although I wanted to slap Belle a few times.  And Hannah.  She became very strange and pitiful, losing much of the strength that we knew and loved her for.  I guess they couldn't have a show about a hooker who doesn't cave in?  Why can't strong women just ever be strong?  The storyline started in Season 3 with Ben went just where we all knew it would and Hannah did inexplicable things to move the plot in that direction.  You can't just say that your client had a horrific um, 'accident'?  Loved the blooper reel after the credits of the finale.  I binge watched all 4 seasons and was reminded of Sex and the City (if they had only had more than 1 bestie, like SITC, it might have approached that show's appeal; the cast got very limited after a while).  All in all, not a bad way to waste time and I had such low expectations, due to the subject matter, that it was all good!  Showtime's commercials in the beginning weren't, and no way to opt out, so I won't be extending my subscription after the trial.",1498953600,,1149,4.347417840375587
8453939,4,B0052HLR5S,I fell for this series hard! I was saddened by the final season being so short. Also baffled as to why season 3 hasn't been released stateside/region one DVD and Blu-Ray. Love Billie Piper she's just funny and quite cool. I mean playing a high class escort with a wink - definitely dig the show breaking the fourth wall.,1492300800,,320,4.440677966101695
8453940,4,B0052HLR5S,"The final season of ""Secret Diary of a Call Girl"" features Belle attempting to run the escort agency, make a relationship work with her boyfriend, deal with a client who plays mindgames, and the usual hilarious antics of the series. There are several flashbacks to earlier seasons when topics come up in the plot and these can often feel a little too much like looking back at the end of a show rather than an organic part of the story. The overall pathos of the final episode is interrupted a bit with a blooper reel following the final credits, but it's still enjoyable. Like many of the other reviewers of this film, I'm disappointed that Showtime never made a Region 1 release of the third season, so some of the flashbacks at the beginning of the first episode refer to things you can't see unless you have a region-free or Region 2 player.",1487376000,,845,4.529411764705882
