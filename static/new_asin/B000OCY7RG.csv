8184364,4,B000OCY7RG,"Race Against Time: The Search For Sarah was a 1995 TV Movie of The Week based on a true story about a young girl, known for getting herself in trouble, who disappears, thought by Police not to be in danger, but in fact is the victim of a car jacking and robbery that could lead to her death.  The sub plot dominating much of the film revolves around the family patriarch John Porter (Richard Crenna) who is well known in the community for charity work and a willingness to help those in need but is uncomfortable making emotional connections with his children, stemming from his own father's death at a young age and how deeply it hurt him. Porter's reluctance to show much affection is tested when his wife's (Patty Duke) suspicions of foul play seem more and more plausible, tested even more when he himself suffers a near fatal heart attack.

Seemingly clichd at times the film is still entertaining and has several tension filled moments (though not much violence).  Crenna in particular excels, managing to bring likeability to Porter despite his penchant for emotional detachment, and convincingly showing that he does loves his children in spite of his cold demeanor, contrasting personality traits many actors would have hard time making as believable as Crenna does.  The scenes between Crenna & Duke in the hospital mid film are the film's best.  Not as much a Crime Drama as a family oriented film it is none the less an entertaining movie with enough plot twists to keep you interested in the final climax in which Porter risks his life to save his troubled daughter.",1397433600,,1579,4.748175182481752
8184365,5,B000OCY7RG,A family finds it must search for their missing daughter themselves when the police won't help. Keeps you on edge wondering how it will play out. Patty Duke as the mother gives another fine performance.,1369526400,,202,4.8
8184366,3,B000OCY7RG,"In the true crime made-for-TV film RACE AGAINST TIME, a young woman disappears and her parents try to find her when the authorities fail to.

While car-jack victim Sarah (portrayed by French actress Ele Keats) is held against her will by a psychopath and his goons, the police botch search efforts. Sarah's parents, John and Natalie (Richard Crenna and Patty Duke) conduct their own investigation. This ends with John confronting the kidnapper at gunpoint.

A dramatic story is diffused and its fine cast handicapped by a clich&eacute;-ridden script.
