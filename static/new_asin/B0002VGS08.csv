8033098,5,B0002VGS08,"...if Rice Girl (the movie, not Cheryl herself) ""bit the big one"", i wouldn't even bother writing this review...soooo when i say Rice Girl is worth watching, i'm not just blowing sunshine up your kiester (aka ""butt"")...i just watched Rice Girl again, and it was more fun than the first time i watched it...

...believe me when i say that i'm not biased whatsoever...sure, i know Cheryl, and we have our differences in opinion on a LOT of things, BUT(T) this doesn't take away from the fact that i'm 1000000000% objective about what she does, ESPECIALLY when it comes to her projects, and as Mr. T says ""Enough jibber jabber, foo!"", see Rice Girl for yourself, and you'll see how much fun the cast is having putting this nutty faith-filled Christian comedy ""into the can"" (as it were)...

...anypoo, Rice Girl isn't trying to save the world, or make some profound earth-shattering statement, it's made by people you'll see sitting across from you at Fatburger or Wang's scratching themselves inappropriately 'cause they're everyday Joans and Joes...don't listen to me, or any of the knuckleheads claiming to know what YOU will/won't enjoy, see Rice Girl for yourself...

...get it? got it? good!

p.s. ...ok, ya know what..? i'm gonna give ya more of a motivator 'cause i'm feeling generous and all warm and fuzzy inside, and 'cause i love my gal pal Cheryl so much, and this is all in good fun, SOOOOO when ya purchase the Rice Girl (DVD) from either Cheryl's MyRiceGirl (Amazon) store, or (my) L.A. Zen (Amazon) store, I'll donate $1.00 to the Breast Cancer Research...

...AND WAIT!, if ya use the promotion code: gollygeegollygeefufufu53 (which i just made up...no pat on the back required, this ain't brain surgery, folks), i'll make sure some candy or sumptin' gets thrown into your order, so you and your sweet tooth can enjoy the movie all hopped up on sugar, not that you'll need it...NOW GO ENJOY THE MOVIE!

Happy Holidays (yup, whichever one ya' celebrate), stay safe...and, as Cheryl would say, God Bless!

~:) !YAY! (:~",1324771200,,2032,4.838616714697406
8033099,5,B0002VGS08,What's funnier than a 350 lb man chasing a weird asian chick around a wrestling ring.  Rob Busboom is the next Chris Farley.  Need I say more.  They try everything to make you laugh and that's what so funny!  Great movie!,1231804800,2,221,4.317073170731708
8033100,5,B0002VGS08,"Wacky, good natured comedy...I'm not that familiar with Asian comedy, but it reminds me of the few Asian comedies I have seen.  Like Hong Kong action cinema copies American gangster films of the 30's and 40's, this broad comedy has roots in American slapstick comedies of the same period.  Cheryl is a riot and it has a good cast of familiar Hollywood character actors...what the heck, give it a try and laugh out loud !",1169078400,2,420,4.586666666666667
8033101,3,B0002VGS08,"I was very entertained watching ""Rice Girl""--I smiled or laughed all the way through. Cheryl Monk's facial expressions were precious--so much fun to watch. Fairly impressive cast for an Indy film with Pat Morita and Dean Haglund. Eddie's character was a clever use of anthropomorphism in switching between animal, human, AND guardian angel--quite cute.

My only concern: to enjoy this movie, one must appreciate the occasional sideline comedy ""shorts"" spread throughout the movie. It will probably be hard to find them all funny, but still clever nonetheless.",1156982400,,559,5.425287356321839
8033102,5,B0002VGS08,One of the funniest most refreshing movies I've seen in awhile. Cheryl Monk and her crew kept me in stiches through the whole movie. Not only that Cheryl is a very pleasurable woman to look at. Even the Fish had me laughing....Pat Morita too. Definitely a movie for the whole family...I still think about it and chuckle out loud.,1140134400,,329,4.593220338983051
8033103,5,B0002VGS08,"A little like a more sweet-natured Asian version of ""I'm Gonna Git You Sucka"", ""Rice Girl"" manages to mix up ""The World of Suzie Wong"" and about a dozen Chop-sockey shoot-em ups, and still manages to be a movie with genuine wit, heart and humor.  You laugh at the movie, but you're laughing with the characters, not at them.  Cheryl Ling is a genuine hoot as the eponymous heroine Windy Yee, so determined to get the title role in the movie ""Hooker X"" that she's willing to go (almost) all the way to do her research.  This puts her in the way of Martin Kove and Ian Lithgow, undercover cops who blithely (and hilariously) explain their peculiar take on the pimp look (Mary Kay pink deVille, and clothes that look like a cross between the old duffer department at Sears and the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders) by announcing they're from Texas.  Naturally, Ian falls for our Rice Girl- who wouldn't?

There are very few false noted in this movie- the cast is obviously having the time of their lives: Martin Kove has more fun in 5 minutes with a powdered donut than any of the actors in the past 5 movies I've seen has, and Pat Morita's delivery of the line ""It's FRIED RICE you pdick!"" had me laughing out loud.  I also really respected that this movie actually had the stones to gently suggest that perhaps selling one's body might not be the healthiest thing to do, physically or morally, but still never, ever isn't light, frothy and hugely fun.

I love finding independant movies like ""Rice Girl"": this is the best of Hollywood.  It's not as slick as what you're going to find at the google-plex, but it being a little raw is part of it's charm.  Plus, you can discover performers like Cheryl Ling while reveling in watching pro's like Martin Kove and Pat Morita given the grren light.

Worth every penny- buy this right now!",1119657600,3,1825,4.536585365853658
8033104,5,B0002VGS08,Cheryl Monk is outstanding playing a wanna-be actress leading her through a bizarre chain of humors events. Rice Girl is destined to become a cult classic!,1113091200,2,155,5.0
8033105,5,B0002VGS08,"A good family movie. Watch as Windy tries to get a part in the upcoming movie ""Hooker X"" and the adventure that ensues. You'll lagh out loud! Pat Morita is very funny and this is a must for X-Files/Lone Gunmen fans!",1113004800,,215,4.2682926829268295
