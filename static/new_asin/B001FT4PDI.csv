3588792,5,B001FT4PDI,How can it NOT be great It's Duckman! What more can I say. The best animated series of it's time. It actually made me a fan of Jason Alexander. (But I still hate The Sienfeld Show). Lots of hours of Duckman in this collection. (Running Time: 1077 minutes). Just Buy It! You Know You Want It!!!,1276041600,,293,4.25
3588793,4,B001FT4PDI,"My video library is all about preserving things for MY future, for those terrible postapocalyptic contingencies, when the hordes above ground will be scrounging for entertainment.  And now with the third and fourth seasons of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Duckman/dp/B001FT4PDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Duckman</a>&nbsp;in my possession, my collection is complete.  If the apocalypse comes, I can crank up the generator, heat up an MRE, pull out my DVDs and laugh at the people banging on my steel-reinforced door.  ""Too bad,"" I'll shout, though they will not be able to hear me, ""You should have practiced more forethought.""

This latest set surprised me.  Some of these episodes I hadn't seen since USA originally aired it.  And though I considered myself a real fan, and was sure I never missed it, I must have, because some of these episodes I never saw at all.  This was a cartoon with a underground aesthetic, aimed at adults, as you'd expect from any animated series about a sexually frustrated, profligate, perverted duck with an extensive arrest record.  With it's thousand-words-a-second literate and pop-culture references, it has stood the test of time (so far, anyway; I suppose eventually the references will be so far in the past, no one will get them).  The benefit of having it on DVD is that now you can turn it back to pick up the asides; and you can take a second look at all of those signs in the background, or the notes on the refrigerator, and so on.  There's a lot to catch, making each episode fun to watch a few times.  Its pluses are many.  It jibes the audience that's NOT tuned in as perhaps TOO dumbed-down while mocking the audience that IS tuned in by intentionally shooting over its head; it creates its own inside jokes; it parodies itself, the network it was on, and our film- and TV-influenced culture in general.  It's a smart show, period, coming at you from all sides.  And considering the low character of Duckman himself, a lot of it is raunchy.  Yes, there are some newer adult-oriented cartoons out there, but they seem rather tame in comparison.

It's all very, very weird; very, very hip.  My favorite episodes are those with a science fiction element in them.  My LEAST favorite are those that centered around Ajax.  For easy laughs, the writers made him mouth-breathing stupid, and his lines had no cleverness to them, aimed low, like sitcom schlock.  The intended jokes about his dumbness become just plain dumb.  However, for the most part, the series demonstrated what television can be when creative people are allowed to think way outside the box (and, as an aside, you have a network with little to lose by taking a chance on something totally new).  The voice talent has to be commended as well.  I can't picture anybody else but Jason Alexander as the voice of Duckman.  He added so much frantic detail to the character, his contribution to its unique flavor can not be overstated.

Season 3 and 4 comes on seven discs.  I've noticed that the opening title sequence is truncated for some episodes.  Duckman's obnoxious wolf whistle has been eliminated, along with the credits for all the other principal characters; it's all skipped and goes right into the episode.  Back in the original broadcast, with a week between episodes, I wouldn't have noticed this change.  If this is how it originally aired or if some of these episodes are from the syndicated broadcast, I'm unable to say.  Sometimes a syndicated series is clipped to allow for more advertising time.  Anyway, not all episodes have that clipped credit sequence.

The special features menu comes at the end of the seventh disc.  There's a video of the original anamatic drawings (a bare-bones thing, most of it in color) from an unaired pilot, about sixteen minutes long.  It's strictly a demo to present the concept to a network, never intended for our consumption.  For our benefit, Everett Peck (the creator) and Gregg Berger (the voice of Cornfed) give a running split-screen context for it.  The second special feature is a very rudimentary animation (just a couple minutes long), literally just a crude set of sketches, of the walking cycles for a few of the characters.  And the third feature is a storyboard for the episode ""I, Duckman.""  The most interesting of those three bonus features is the demo pilot with the Peck-Berger commentary.  There are no commentaries on any of the actual episodes.

I think it's worth mentioning that there's more Duckman this time out: either season in this set has more episodes than either of the first two seasons on the first set.  There's a lot of stuff here.

And there's a hell of a cliffhanger for the last episode.  At the conclusion of the credits, some of the production staff are chuckling as they wrap it up.  They KNEW it was good-bye.  They just decided to break it off in us.

3588794,5,B001FT4PDI,"The quality of these dvd's is great.  Well worth the price.  Bought a complete set somewhere else and the quality was awful.  Grainy and not a legitimate copy, I guess.  But this set is great with lots of extras and good storage boxes too.  Arrived well within the shipping time. Thank you very much.",1261612800,2,300,4.481481481481482

3588796,5,B001FT4PDI,Duckman is duckman. If you've never seen it you don't have a clue. The seller shipped it quickly and it works well. I'm proud to have it.,1234483200,,137,4.111111111111111
3588797,5,B001FT4PDI,"""D'wah!"" This box set greatly compliments the first one just right. It doesn't have the hysterical and outrageous moments as the first and second seasons but the edge is very slight. Seasons three and four actually delve deeper into the shows characters and gives you a good perspective of why they are the way they are. Doing this kind of gives a more human feel and adds a lot of depth to an already well-detailed show. I love it and recommend it to anyone who's a fan of Family Guy and South Park-type humor.

3588798,5,B001FT4PDI,"Duckman releases well over half of it's episodes in this fantastic set! Seasons 3 and 4 feature some of the best episodes, including ""Grandma-ma's Flatulent Adventure"", the Star Trek parody episode, and the unbelieveable finale where Duckman does nearly everything right!

Between the unbelieveable comments that come out of Duckman's mouth, the sweetness of Fluffy and Uranus, and Cornfed's actual solving of the cases, this show is a perfect mix.

I can only hope that perhaps one day the cliffhanger ending may be resolved.",1233705600,,526,5.25
3588799,5,B001FT4PDI,"Yes, I said Duckman rules.... I love this type of socially dysfunctional satirical cartoons...  If you enjoy the same type of cartoon taste as I do, Duckman is for you. The price is right since you get 2 seasons for the cost of 1 season.",1233705600,3,237,4.266666666666667
3588800,1,B001FT4PDI,I've rarely been as disapointed as I was when I found out the best scene in the Duckman series possibly the greatest  scene in TV history was missing on the dvd. In the episode when they do the Star Trek reference the scene where Duckman seduces the women by recreating Will Shatner's unforgetable rendetion of Tambourine Man is CUT OUT!!! Are you kidding me?! It makes me ill just typing this. Yes I think this was one of the greatest TV shows ever but when the distributors do this it's just inexcusable. So you've been warned. Paramount and CBS you owe us all a huge apology and a refund.,1233619200,32,591,4.422018348623853
3588801,5,B001FT4PDI,"I have never been so impressed by a show, yet so disappointed for it's premature cancellation since Family Guy! And like Family Guy, this show should be reincarnated by it's audience's demand through DVD sales! I can assure you, if you're a fan of the same offensive, crass humor that is both high-brow and low-brow with it's pop culture references and witty dialogue that Family Guy offers, then you'll also be a fan of this show. Albeit this is a very quirky show, it is also very brilliant in it's writing and humor, and truly deserves a few more seasons on DVD. (There were seven in all.) Hopefully if there is enough demand for these DVD's of Duckman, then it will have it's rebirth on Adult Swim!! These 2 seasons display what many think of as the peak for this show, so if you've enjoyed seasons 1 and 2 then you will DEFINITELY enjoy these as well! And if you haven't seen any, then get these anyway.",1228089600,6,908,4.4431137724550895

3588805,3,B001FT4PDI,"Duckman is one of my favorite series, but it kind of lost its magic in season 3 and 4. I don't know the behind-the-scenes but I wouldn't be surprised if the creative team had a major shakeup. The tenor and pace is all wrong compared to season 1 and 2. It kind of feels like they forgot they were writing for adults.",1389571200,,315,4.096774193548387

3588807,4,B001FT4PDI,"Duckman season three and four was seven disc because its much more shows then first two seasons.  These two seasons were entertaining also because of how many ways Duckman finds to kill his secataries fuffy and the other bear.  Warning though my review contains mutiple spoilers about both seasons.  I will give some basic highlights for fans of the Duckman show.  The season starts with a parody of a film noir where cornfed is telling the story and looking like he is all alone and looking like he has lost everything. As the seasons progresses the cuddly bears end up using bad language against Duckman because he has messed up their home and everything inside it.  They use songs in almost every show both season three and four and the actor doing cornfed seems to be able to change his voice to a soul singer or popish so forth.  In one show Duckman actually saves the city from King Chicken with past knowledge of dry ice.  One show proved to very funny was Duckman seeing future versions of himself and trying not to become the bad ones but the good ones.  One best ones for season three was Duckman doing a paraody speech of Full Metal Jacket in the show called The longest weekend.  Then Season Four more musical numbers and mutiple hollywood actors making guest stops on the show Duckman like Coolio, Sly Stone, Arnold, Bruce Willis and so forth.  They have a great flashback scene of Duckman Cornfed and King Chicken in high school, Cornfed ends up becoming dumb for one show becomes of a dumb potion he drinks by accident.  To keep the hollywood feeling going the parody Friends.  Even Ice T and Samuel L Jackson guest star voices on Duckman, I enjoy lot the haunted house show as Duckman and Cornfed as plumers then they have Homer Simpson come into the show at end of the show.  One of better shows of the season was Duckman and family camping and Fuffy and other bear get bite and turn into killer beasts.  They even use Law and Order theme for one show where Duckman gets community service, and finally they parody Star Trek with Duckman characters playing the cast of Star Trek. Now for the last show of the season four ended up asking myself what the writers were thinking Duckman, Cornfed, and King Chicken in a triple marriage scene...then a shocking end and made me think really after watching all these shows of Duckman a twist like that made me go your kidding right Beatrice alive? Then Cornfed says to Duckman I knew there was something I was forgetting.",1361836800,,2479,4.566591422121896
3588808,3,B001FT4PDI,I was a huge Duckman fan back in the mid nineties when it used to be on t.v.  After not seeing it for 15 years my taste in humor had changed.  I find some of the jokes funny but not as funny as it was when I was sixteen years old.  I still would rather watch Duckman over some other cartoon comedy shows.  However my favorite cartoon t.v show is still Family Guy.,1345420800,,363,3.9315068493150687
