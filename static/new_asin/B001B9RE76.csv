8282420,5,B001B9RE76,"I was initially unsure as to whether I would find the information in this DVD truly beneficial to my training. I wanted to improve my reaction times, by using sticks.

I had no need for doubts.

The learning just from watching, before I even picked up a stick, was massive.

The justifications for each section are supported in reality, not theory. The training drills have brought a new aspect to the training in my house. I love the hubod drills, and now I have one for sticks.

If you have ever wanted to expand your training with skills that strengthen your basics, quicken your reactions, and incorporate an additional skill base to your self reliance and defense, then this should be considered.

Thanks, Sammy.",1286582400,,717,4.75
8282421,5,B001B9RE76,"I was looking to improve my eye and hand coordination and a friend suggested this DVD.  I got so much more out of this DVD.  ""Street Stick Fighting"" covers the proper grips, ranges, and fighting stance.  Mr. Franco clearly explains the different techniques and practice drills.  I have to say, when I started this video, my stick work was atrocious.  After practicing the drills for some time, I dramatically improved my stick work and thus my hand-eye coordination and my offensive/defensive reaction time.  I have incorporated these drills into my regular training.  Good dvd.  I recommend it!",1273708800,4,595,5.061855670103093
