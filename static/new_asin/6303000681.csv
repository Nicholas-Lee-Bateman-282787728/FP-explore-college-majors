Bolo Yeung plays a master on the mountain.  He has only a few minutes of screen time, doesn't perform any action, and speaks a few lines that are dubbed over by some other actor who I still couldn't understand what he was saying.  I also knew there was a tournament in this movie and I enjoy martial art movies with tournaments because there is a variety of fighters and styles.  That was a joke too.  The fights were so brief and cheap and the tournament locale was outdoors on some cheap platform.  Not that this all really matters overall.

Fortunately, the story, for what it is, is actually the brighter side of the movie.  Jalal Merhi plays a man who's brother is killed by drug overdose.  He sets out for revenge and travels to Hong Kong to learn Tiger Claw kung fu, leaving his soon to be wife and business oportunities behind him.  Jalal has some pretty decent martial art skills, but suffers badly in the acting department.  As for the rest of the actors in the film - pitiful acting.  Not to mention, most of the characters are just lame lame lame.

There is not a whole lot of action throughout, and when a fight scene comes around it doesn't last very long.  Even the final fight scene in the film lasts shorter than it could have been.  Its a good fight between the Jalal Mehri character and the villain in a theatre backstage, but it ends too quickly.

Well, if you were hoping to check out Bolo Yeung in action, this is not the film.  If you're looking for a top martial arts film, this still isn't the one.  It's not the worst ever but its pretty low.",1155859200,2,1707,4.3280757097791795
