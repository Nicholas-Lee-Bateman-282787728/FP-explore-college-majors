8051415,5,B0007TKNWO,"In this DVD, Norio Hayakawa has a lot to say about this ""non-existant base"".  He gives a series of lectures about the base and it's obscurities like black projects, conspiricies to cover up the facts of Area 51, and enormous underground facilities.  One would be shocked to know that there's an even huger base underground featuring restaurants, tennis courts, swimming pools, etc.  From what former workers say that it's an extremely oppressed environment to work in, there seems to be somewhat of an upside underneath it all.  Also, Norio tells about his personal encounter with the security measures at the base.  He continues saying that he and his crew were on public land and were dangerously chased out of the area by military helicoptors.  This is a 2 DVD set but the same facts are basically repeated on both (with the second disk having more info).  Very thorough and informative.  Very well said Mr. Hayakawa.",1249948800,,920,4.890322580645162
