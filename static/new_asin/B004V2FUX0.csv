The songs are very stimulating. the song 'ashaon ke sawan me' is a masterpiece. jeetu and rena looked extremely radiant and classic. jeetu is ever good in love songs. he is extremely gifted, and directors who understand how to exploit this gift and ability in jeetu enjoy the comfort that he radiates in doing love scenes. he is really a blessing to Hindi filmworld. Aasha is a film to watch any day !!!",1304812800,,658,4.681034482758621
