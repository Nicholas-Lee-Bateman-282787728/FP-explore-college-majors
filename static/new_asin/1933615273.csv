7801789,5,1933615273,"wow, this series has changed my ENTIRE perspective on food preparation. I bought this for my dad since he loves to cook, I may buy one for myself.

Now I know the importance of flavors, quick kitchen techniques TO GET THE MOST OUT OF MY INGREDIENTS!

So much more that I could've learned if I went to a cooking school (which is EXPENSIVE and you may not even learn a thing!)

I have rekindled my passion for baking thanks to this dvd set.

No, I am not paid by the people making these cheap dvds, yes the boxset doesn't hold the cds in place at times.
But yes, they WILL show you how to make really good food.",1266105600,,609,4.135593220338983
7801790,5,1933615273,"The shows are excellent.  I found the quality of the production to be very good.  The recipes are great, the episodes are fun to watch and they are often humorous.  I personally would prefer more cooking and less equipment and product taste testing, but that is just a personal preference.

[Note: There are no recipes included on these DVD's - of any season - until Season 9.  Season 9 does have recipes.  Presumably they will be included in future editions, as well.  Clearly they wanted to sell the recipes either in the companion book or online, so it is to their credit they have started including the recipes on the DVD's.  Also, there seem to be parts of episodes missing from the DVD's that were part of the actual season.  The web site has all the episodes listed with each and every recipe they did.]

I have copies of all seasons and I would recommend them in spite of these issues because they are very helpful, instructive, and fun to watch.

You can get all old seasons on their web site for 50% off and with quite reasonable shipping costs.",1262995200,2,1055,4.5
7801791,5,1933615273,"Even if, like me, you have no cooking ability and very little experience, this is a fantastic show.

America's Test Kitchen concentrates on real meals that people are likely to make, not fancy gourmet treats that look fantastic, but nobody will ever try.  These recipes are intended to be used.

ATK tests recipes many times (since this is a DVD, not a book, the fact that they don't test indexes at all will have no effect).  This is the seventh season, so they have their roles down and each show is interesting.  I watch the equipment and taste testing even when the topic itself is of no interest to me, they are short and fun.  Read the review entitled ""Finally a Quality Cooking Show about Cooking"" on the page for ""America's Test Kitchen Season 7"" (why two products?  I don't know) for a list of what is covered in season seven.

The DVDs do not include written recipes, so you may want to check out the ATK website for availability and price of the DVD and hardcover recipe book set.  I bought that version of Season Nine, for roughly the same price as the DVD alone.

I used to grill and make the occasional breakfast food.  My wife liked my first ATK stew better than anything she'd made in our nearly 30-year marriage, and the kids loved it.  Now I make many things and the only question is what to try next.  The downside of the show is that you'll want to spend more time cooking, and so spend more on cooking equipment and gadgets, and more time eating.  But the show itself is great.",1255651200,3,1498,4.4
