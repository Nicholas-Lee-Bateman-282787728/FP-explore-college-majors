6153955,5,B00HCRKFRC,"Nobody does ""old style"" country like Marty Stuart and he applies the same principles and power into his gospel writing and singing.  Back by the  ""Fabulous Superlatives"" (this is his Signature Group) and hosted by Bill Gaither, you will have a wonderful time listening to great music and hearing the stories and meaning of what you are hearing.  ""The Unseen Hand"" is worth the price of the DVD!",1402704000,3,394,4.764705882352941
