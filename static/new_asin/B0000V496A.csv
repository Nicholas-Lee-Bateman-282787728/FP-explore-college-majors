8114048,4,B0000V496A,"Nice 2 disc set with a variety of TV detective show from the 1950's. Sound and picture quality are good for these bargain discs. The 7 Dragnet episodes are a lot more gritty and realistic than I remembered. The second disc has a single episode of Burke's Law (Who Killed Jason Shaw), 2 Peter Gunn shows, and 2 episodes of Richard Diamond Detective staring David Jansen. The Richard Diamond shows include original commercials for Maxwell House Instant coffee and Minute Rice. In addition, disc two also has full length movies from the 1930's; Mr. Wong Detective and Bulldog Drummond.",1292198400,2,582,4.888888888888889
