7132669,5,B00WIFR5CG,"My five-year-old son is obsessed with the Teen Titans.  I had never heard of it before, but I'm glad I did.  I suppose I should be reviewing the product itself rather than the show...  From that perspective, the DVDs themselves are fine, definitely original product and not a bootleg...it was wrapped in plastic...  yeah.  Five stars.  No problems.  Now back to the show itself.  As a 33-year-old ""adult"", I love watching this show with him (and love that I have an excuse to watch a kids' show again).  It's absolutely brilliant.  Yes, it does often poke fun at various aspects of the superhero genre as a whole, which I guess offends certain people (who take things way too seriously).  It's a great show.",1478217600,,707,4.666666666666667

7132672,5,B00WIFR5CG,"I'm a 33 year old woman with 3 kids, 2 girls (12 & 10) and one 3 year old boy.  I love that we can all sit down as a family and watch something and it's not torture for me.  In fact, I enjoy it as much as they do.
A product of the 80s, I've forced my children to watch shows I grew up on.  I'm not a fan of strange shows like Adventure Time, etc, that are made for today's kids.  I hate Spongebob. So it's with relief that I found something we can all watch.",1462060800,3,458,3.642857142857143

I know some people can't get with this version of the Titans: ""They're making fun of the Teen Titans"", they whine.
Yeah, they are! And it's funny!
