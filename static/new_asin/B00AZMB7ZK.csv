8559793,4,B00AZMB7ZK,"Enjoyable documentary about iconic 1960s and 70s children's book author, creator of powerful, anti-war and other political posters, and artist of
erotica, often with a bondage or S+M theme. As diverse as this work is, it all shares Ungerer's trade mark dark sense of humor.

The film follows his interesting life, from Childhood in Nazi occupied Alsatia, to his coming to America, his success as an illustrator, and then
hugely as a children's book author, his politicalization and involvement with erotic, to the fateful moment when they all came together after
he was attacked for his sexual drawings at a children's book convention, and was almost immediately black-listed. His books were taken out
of libraries, publishers dropped him, publications (including the New York Times) refused to review his work. Much of the film is Ungerer himself,
a very engaging interview subject, now in his 80s ruminating on everything; art, life, death, sex, politics, success and failure, children, fear.
He is eccentric to be sure but in a way that feels very open and inviting.

All that said, there's a lack of emotion for the great majority of the film. Also, I'm just slightly mistrustful of how complete a portrait the film
actually is. Growing up in NYC I happened to know Ungerer's daughter when we both were about 10 years old. Yet there's no mention of her,
or her mother in the film, which gives the distinct impression that Ungerer was a wild man bachelor until he met his later wife, with whom he
moved to Canada, and then Ireland. It troubles me a bit that feels like such a thorough portrait and deals so much with children, sex, morality,
and `the swinging 60s,' there's no touching on what his `first family' situation was like, or even that they existed.",1386201600,,1762,4.87
8559794,5,B00AZMB7ZK,"Far Out Isn't Far Enough: The Tomi Ungerer Story preview on ""56 UP"" documentary is wonderful!

This a review of the preview I saw part of another video.  I haven't seen the whole movie, but it looks good.  There seem to be problems for USA people getting this at an OK price in an OK format.......

Not sold in USA Region 1 format (July 29013)?

Why?

The sales pitch I saw for this movie (previews only, not the entire movie) got me interested.

I can't afford the prices now charged for the Region 2 version now sold by Amazon. Com

Please get this movie available in the USA in a Region 1 DVD format!

It seems like a possibly very important treatment of art by an important, worthy (if eccentric and far out....aren't they all?) artist!

------------------

Here is additional information I got about this movie and sent to others discussing it:

-------------

About the FAR OUT ISN'T FAR ENOUGH: LIFE OF TOMI UNGERER (2012) video now distributed in the USA by First Run Features (contact them and get their monthly newsletter which will have updates about this video at: WWW.FirstRunFeatures. Com)

It appears the documentary movie is brand new and simply moving through the ""pipeline"" for distribution in the USA slowly. It seems already to have been release in Europe, and a used Region 2 DVD format (can't be used in the USA which uses Region 1 format only) is now for sale from Amazon. Com.

It is easy to purchase an inexpensive ""All Regions"" DVD player from Amazon. Com for roughly $30 plus shipping of roughly $16. You can play ""Region 2"" videos (used in the UK) if you get one of these. I think every video enthusiast should own an ""All Regions"" DVD player in order to play videos from other regions of the world than the USA.

I'm quite certain this important video about the life of German artist Tomi Ungerer will be sold in a Region 1 format useable in the USA in time, and probably soon. Perhaps within a few months, certainly within a year.

I just obtained the latest ""UP Series"" UK documentary of fame episode titled ""56 UP"" which was broadcast, publicized, and reviewed in the UK last Spring 2012, but only a year later made available in the USA in a Region 1 DVD format. The ""UP Series"" documentaries are distributed in the USA by First Run Features, which also sells some, not all, of the movies they handle (some are only handled for theatrical release, are not for sale currently).

In time, hopefully soon, First Run Features ""DVD Video Store"" will sell the Tomi Ungerer movie directly.

Those who sign up at the First Run Features website (WWW.FirstRunFeatures. Com) for the monthly newsletter are provided with a one time use ""gift certificate discount"" of 25 percent off purchase of any First Run Features video available for sale. This can be applied to the FAR OUT ISN'T FAR ENOUGH: The Tomi Ungerer Story documentary video when it is finally available for sale.

I think the main thing here is to be patient with the overall process of a non-USA video making its way to the USA market, which often involves a considerable time delay, as was the case for ""56 UP"" video documentary from the UK and First Run Features this year.

The Tomi Ungerer biography video is not a mainstream product which appeals to the mass audiences of the USA like BATMAN and SPIDERMAN feature movies. It is an art history movie, interesting only to a relatively small audience (like us) without much financial clout (I'm an example......I didn't buy the Amazon. Com used video of the Tomi Ungerer bio movie for roughly $50 because that is too much money for me...and I own a Region 2 player machine and other Region 2 videos).

Usually people interested in art history are ""poor student"" types of all ages, always watching their pennies. We all must be grateful to First Run Features (of NYC USA) for catering to customers like us with high standards of artistic taste and not much in our pocketbooks or bank accounts!
