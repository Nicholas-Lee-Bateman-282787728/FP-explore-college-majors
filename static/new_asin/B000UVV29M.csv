8215222,4,B000UVV29M,"UFC 73 was an event packed with good fights. I didn't expect much from it, but after viewing it, I found myself wrong. Tito's fight was exciting. The bonus which includes countdown is above average. Considering the price of this item, it is a real bargain.",1255996800,,256,4.586956521739131

8215224,4,B000UVV29M,"Ok, what's the deal here? This was the first time I've watched a UFC with 4 fights featured in the gladiator introduction. I've seen 3 plenty of times, but it promises a huge night of fights! It promises explosion, and the only thing that waits is a fuse to be lit. They don't call this STACKED for no reason!

Four gladiator introductions, I still can't believe that! The first one is 2 big heavyweights who have faced off in Pride more then one time. Heath Herring and Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira are ready to tough it out in the Octagon this time! Then you have a couple of fighters who can't stand each other. These two happen to be Tito Ortiz and Rashad Evans. And the trash these two talk, there's nothing nice to say about the other. Then you have a couple of title fights. The first would be Sean Sherk defending his belt against Hermes Franca. This is the lightweight title on the line. I was excited for Franca, and was convinced he deserved this shot. Sherk has only lost to Matt Hughes and GSP. And last, but certainly not least, not in the least a middleweight belt to fight for! Anderson Silva will defend against a man named Nate Marquardt. Anderson thinks that Marquardt would be crazy to stand with him, and he just may be right.

Ok, but what about the other fights? You take a look at the undercard, and it isn't exactly filled with cans. Like for instance, what about the return of Stephan Bonnar? Chris Lytle is also an undercard competitor. Why aren't they on the main card? Just look at the main card! The names deserve to be there, and have more than earned it. It is STACKED, just as promised. But while a flashy title can promise great hype, it doesn't always mean happy endings. There are a couple of disappointments. Disappointments that simply shouldn't have happened. But the fights I will list below, and the DVD is worth the purchase.

Frankie Edgar vs. Mark Bocek: Mark Bocek knew he wanted to do this since UFC 2. But Frankie Edgar always has an answer for who wants a go at him. This ends with a first round TKO.

Chris Lytle vs. Jason Gilliam: A couple of Indiana boys ready to square off. They both want hands raised. One of them gets what they wish for, halfway through the first round with a submission.

Jorge Gurgel vs. Diego Saraiva: Two Brazilians ready to rock! I thought this was a great fight, and it went to a decision. I thought it was indeed unanimous, but I didn't think it was 30-27 the whole way around. Still a great fight!

Stephan Bonnar vs. Mike Nickels: Mike Nickels has his tattoos polished and ready, but is he prepared for ""The American Psycho"" to replace them with scars? This doesn't go too long, and a submission seals the deal in round one.

Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira vs. Heath Herring: WHAT?!!? This should've been over by late round 1 or early round 2! Instead, it goes to a unanimous decision.

Sean Sherk vs Hermes Franca: Good fight. But in the end, after the cards are tallied up, a major disappointment ensues. Franca accepts his suspension without much question. Sherk appeals his on his own dollar. In Sherk's case, he should know as much as the next person as to what's going into his body. As for both fighters, they both need to set examples, and not be the exception that disproves the rule. All I can say is good fight, because nobody is champion in either case.

Tito Ortiz vs. Rashad Evans: This should have been a fight that had a clear winner. Instead, a point was taken away, and it was a unanimous DRAW!! Nobody fights for a draw, especially these two. The rematch should be better.

Kenny Florian vs. Alvin Robinson: Throughout the whole DVD, this is one fight where they don't include the pre-fight interviews. Oh well, it was still a good scrap. It still ended in the first round.

Anderson Silva vs. Nate Marquardt: I don't know if it was simply what we expected, or if it just ended too quickly. It almost went a full round!

The only thing that dumbed this down was the stupid stuff, plain and simple. Otherwise, it was STACKED!! STACKED Indeed!",1198195200,4,4031,4.491803278688525
