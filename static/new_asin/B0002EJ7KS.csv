2081423,5,B0002EJ7KS,This movie really touched me because of it's realness and emotion.  I think the actors did well in showing real emotion and trying to convey the message that I think the movie had.  What a powerful depiction of peer pressure and abuse.,1090627200,13,235,4.571428571428571
2081424,5,B0002EJ7KS,This movie is so gooooodddd!  I taped it off the lifetime network one day after seeing it months before.  Tiffani plays a great role as a couragious and determined teenager who wants to see the people who hurt her get punished.  Not only does she end up going against the whole town but she becomes outcasted and hurt by people she considered to be her friends.  Brian Austin Green's character is awesome as far as dealing with peer pressure and in the end just going with what he feels.  I cried in this movie and I laughed...it belongs on every girls movie shelf!  I gurantee you will enjoy this movie as much as I do now!,1089849600,14,624,4.336206896551724

2081426,1,B0002EJ7KS,TD from Amazon.com not knowing if I get rested and the movie was going great till the end when it started messing up not worth the money I couldn't do that again,1357603200,,161,4.0625
2081427,5,B0002EJ7KS,"Well, Where to begin? This movie had a lot of extremely good point's in this movie! I would buy this movie in a heart beat, but it's pretty expensive. But I really want it!",1319673600,,172,4.088235294117647
2081428,5,B0002EJ7KS,Don't spend $139.99 for this movie... go to Future Shop and pay only $26.99 brand new. It's robbery to charge so much.,1295568000,2,118,4.409090909090909
2081429,3,B0002EJ7KS,"If you love slightly cheesy Lifetime-style made-for-TV movies, this is a good one to add to your collection!  My favorites have former Saved by the Bell or Beverly Hills 90210 cast members, so this one has both.  Brian Austin Green was such a geek on 90210 but he really grew into a hottie - if you're a fan of his you'll love this movie!  Tiffani Amber Thiessen plays the lead role, looking like the SBtB College Years version of Kelly.  This movie isn't Oscar-worthy art, but it's good entertainment.  The DVD contains the movie only - no special features.  Parents should probably review content advisories before purchasing since the movie is about rape and depicts sexually active high school students and underage drinking.  As far as I remember, BAG is shown with no shirt on and TAT is shown in her underwear in some scenes.",1235001600,3,832,4.696551724137931
2081430,5,B0002EJ7KS,"If every young or adult male who raped, was punished by being raped, then rape would never happen. Let justice be served and the consequences fit the crime. A highly powerful electric cattle prod should do the trick.
Or the offending ""member"" could be forcibly removed with a small portable guillotine, no anesthesia required!

Same thing goes for child molesters and baby killers.",1219708800,,381,5.0476190476190474
2081431,5,B0002EJ7KS,"What a wonderful story that allows viewers to see that they, too, can stand up and be heard no matter what the circumstances are. Tiffani Amber Thiessen was amazing in portraying real life events that happen to girls and boys every day.",1215475200,2,236,4.642857142857143
2081432,5,B0002EJ7KS,"Another of those rarely seen TV movies, Very strong subject matter dealing with rape and its aftermath. Worth buying the DVD.",1209427200,,125,5.0
2081433,5,B0002EJ7KS,when i was a little kid this was my fav. movie to watch on TV now i don't have to wait for it to show on Lifetime i can just watch it whenever i want & i don't come on TV any more.,1181865600,,180,3.2093023255813953

2081435,5,B0002EJ7KS,This movie was not only a great one but it showed how life can really be like this. making it a very good twist and change to a what we see as normal teenage life.,1173312000,2,163,3.6857142857142855

2081437,4,B0002EJ7KS,I wanted to see this movie because of Tiffani Amber Thiessan and Brian Austin Green.  Although this movie was predictable I still liked it alot.  Its got a good story dialog to it. I give it a 4.,1151193600,,195,4.105263157894737
2081438,5,B0002EJ7KS,"High school sports be it in a small town or urban area, take a front seat to academics. The star of the football team rapes a student and the student is made to be the villain. Tiffani Amber-Thiessen, all grown-up from ""Save By the Bell"" plays a student trying to elevate her popularity by hanging out with the ""cool"" crowd only to be an outcast becasue she refused to allow her attacker get away with a crime. Her girlfriends are unsupportive of her because they are too caught up in this ""hunk"" who is nothing more than a senseless jerk.

The principal, a female and mature woman, seems to turn a blind eye to this. She is part of the problem as to why our education system is failing. The lack of academics and student conduct and too much emphasis on the school winning a team doesn't make an upstanding school. She at first isn't willing to take drastic action until a lawyer comes in and lets her know what the law is and says. That is when she starts to panic and gathers her senses.

This is a movie not only for the audience to watch, but a tool for educators who think they can sweep up problems like this under the rug.",1146268800,28,1130,4.275700934579439
2081439,4,B0002EJ7KS,"I've always loved this movie.  It is a popular one on Lifetime Movie Network.  I am thrilled that these ""B"" movies are starting to be released on DVD.",1138406400,2,150,4.321428571428571
2081440,2,B0002EJ7KS,"I liked this movie but I also didn't like it.

the story line was very predictable. I saw a similar movie of true movies.

the acting was fairly good. it does go to show how ignorant people are when it comes to Rape.after watching this movie I realise why many rapes go unreported.",1129852800,5,281,4.283018867924528
2081441,5,B0002EJ7KS,This was a very good movie. In the other reviews people have never seen it until it came to Lifetime tv. But I can say that yes I see it the first time it was ever on tv which was about 1995 on NBC Monday Night Movie of the week. It doesnt really matter where or when you seen it most people will agree that it is a good movie. I think it detailed out some of the abuse that many young teenage girls take from jocks or boys peirod while in high school.,1127606400,4,452,3.8191489361702127
2081442,5,B0002EJ7KS,"this movie is about a young girl who is outcast because of a rumor in school that a guy started. he hurt her them made it seem like she wanted to get him in trouble. so that crew starts making her life miserable until she gets the courage to stand up for herself and luckily she makes an aly in a guy from that crew, he helps her be strong. she takes on the crew and the school administration. it's a good movie but has two sexual scenes. the acting done by tiffany amber theisen is terriffic.",1122076800,5,493,4.092783505154639

8027234,5,B0002EJ7KS,I had seen this movie years ago and really liked it. I am glad was able to find it and add to my collection. The main plot still resignates in today society. Peer pressure can make a group turn against 1 person who try's to stand up for the truth.,1405209600,,247,3.96

Thiessen stars as Caitlin Rose, a teenager who joins the coolest group in high school, boosting her popularity and giving her a chance to get closer to Ethan (Brian Austin Green).
