A man goes into a back room to tell Ace that Trigger Morton is in town. Morton goes to see Ace, he wants to know who framed a job on him. Ace admits to it! The lights go out, there is shooting. Ace needs a doctor now. Townsmen need a new Sheriff to keep Tom Holman from ruining business in town. Riders come to town shooting pistols, then enter the tavern. Will his men stay out of town? No! Morton enters and orders water to drink. He is quick on the draw! But a man shoots him in the back. He recovers quickly (to avoid a big bill). Zeke offers him the job of Sheriff to clean out Holmans gang. He accepts the job. There is a poster to the Bar-X men to behave while in town. Sheriff Morton waits inside the saloon. Morton fights their leader and knocks him out. Put that sign back! The Bar-X men ride away. Holman rides into town to meet the new Sheriff. He shoots at the Sheriff but is hit; the Bar-X men will stay out of town.

Zeke arrives to talk to Morton. Molly cleans up the office and finds an old wanted poster for a bank robber! Two of Mortons friends arrive to offer him a deal. What will he do? Molly asks Jim about his past, but he doesnt answer. Later Morton visits Chuck to tell them to stay out of town. Mortons younger brother has joined this gang! There is a fight. Morton is overpowered and tied up. Jim talks to Ed again. Chuck tells the gang what to do. Morton rides back to town. Chuck enters the postmasters office at night, opens the safe, and takes out a satchel of money. Morton rides back to town to catch them, there is shooting! Morton pursues Chuck and takes the satchel. Other men ride after them. Morton puts the satchel back in the safe; Molly watches. Ed is brought in as a prisoner. Molly overhears their talk, then gives coffee to Ed. She tells Jim what she did. Jim will stay and look forward to a happy future.

This is sort of an unusual story of a lawman who has a past. Yet is all works out for the good. Ken Maynard was a rodeo rider who became an actor in the Westerns that were popular in the 1930's and 1940's. A hero protected peoples businesses from those who would take them away; an echo of the Great Depression.",1507161600,,2195,4.172169811320755

7903963,2,B000006AJ1,"Ken Maynard and Tarzan have seen better days in this no-budget Grand National outing. Apart from the traditional Maynard stunt work, ""Six-Shootin' Sheriff"" (1938) is a plodding affair. Nevertheless, any ""B"" Western featuring Walter Long, Dick Alexander (who slugs it out with Ken in a hokey barroom brawl), Earl Dwire, Glenn Strange and Richard Cramer can't be all bad.",1341532800,,369,5.271186440677966
7903964,3,B000006AJ1,"As Jim ""Trigger"" Morton, Ken Maynard portrays a man recently released from prison after being framed for bank robbery, who returns to his former community with but but cause in mind - to clear his name and avenge himself upon the one responsible for his unjust conviction: Ace Kindall (Warner Richmond); however, fate decrees an additional role for him as the eponomyous crime fighter in this well-made Grand National feature. Maynard, a trick rider for Buffalo Bill's barnstorming troupe, later performed an identical function in Hollywood during the silent era, and his equestrian skill aboard his unique white stallion Tarzan helps to lift this work above the routine ""B"" Western level, as director Harry Fraser assures that the action moves smartly, with spare dialogue well delivered by such excellent character performers as Walter Long and Earl Dwire.",1107129600,,858,5.2700729927007295
