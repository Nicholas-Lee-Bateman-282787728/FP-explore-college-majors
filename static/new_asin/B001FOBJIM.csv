8302155,5,B001FOBJIM,"The Christmas Cardio portion is a fun and uplifting cardio to do during the Holiday Season if you enjoy Christmas music and Christmas decorations.  The exercises in the Christmas cardio section include light weights, so it helps to get your heart rate going and to tone up.  The  exercises are easy enough for any levels yet still effective.  I enjoy the cute extra effects added to the dvd, like the home video setting to make you feel like you have been invited into their home for the holidays.  Plus the other video effects add to the interest, like raining candy canes and a cute dog wearing reindeer ears.  The other cardio (non-holiday), is very energizing, and set outside on a beautiful lake.  The music is great.  I like the shortness in length yet effectiveness of the simple exercises.  Sometimes I will perform the cardio and then also do the workout with weights segment or sometimes I will do just one of the segments.  It is nice to be able to have such a variety all on one dvd.  The workout with weights segment is awesome.  In just a short time, I can tone up and burn fat.  All, while enjoying myself with the music and the great scenery on the dvd.  David, the trainer on the dvd, is very encouraging with a heart warming personality, which makes me want to use the dvd often.  Definitely worth the money.",1220918400,,1326,4.512605042016807
