8271009,5,B0018SNYQ0,"Garden Story is a wonderful production from PBS. Each episode inspires the gardener and non-gardener alike  to explore the impact green areas measure on our souls. The format lends itself for group discussion and perhaps an inspiration to form some sort of ""garden action plan"". The photography is beautiful and the entire work is well edited",1218240000,13,342,5.107142857142857
