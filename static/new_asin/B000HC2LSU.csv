8138179,5,B000HC2LSU,"This 21st century artifact conjures the start of the previous one amazingly. It captures so much of the B&W silent era so wonderfully - including the flickery thing that came from uncertain film and development back then. Faces, features, and gestures take the place of effects and voice, and add a delightful ambiguity - what are they really saying, doing, thinking?

But it's not a 1900s story, The family is one that's always existed, but only lately has taken on legitimacy as ""family."" Makeup and gestures aren't true to that era, and importing a Japanese myth into American culture would never have been considered. I don't know the original Kaguyahime, but I've seen at least one other rendering - different beyond belief, and even more abstract. It's not a long flick, under an hour, but very moving. This one isn't for every audience, and I'm not sure just how to define the audience I imagine it for.

But, if you don't need to follow and anticipate every detail, if you can throw yourself into a different style of visual storytelling, and if you can blend images across generations as other blend cocktails, you'll love it.

8138180,5,B000HC2LSU,"Claire is a black and white silent movie that plays with an orchestra performing a score written for the film. It was made with an antique hand-crank Mitchell Standard movie camera using techniques available to filmmakers of that era. It's a retelling of a Japanese Faery Tale -- in this version, a gay couple, living in the Appalachian mountains prays to the moon for a child and the moon sends them one made of moonlight who can heal and grant wishes, but not without causing herself damage. She must return to the moon from whence she came. My friends Sister Soami DeLight is one of the stars, and as he is male nun, he is something of a ham actor anyway -- which was perfect and glowed within a media that required the actors to tell their stores without words, just with their physicality.

Claire is a marvel and a delight.",1373241600,3,829,4.490066225165563
8138181,5,B000HC2LSU,"I saw this at the Maryland Film Festival with the live orchestra. Even my 2-year-old daughter was enthralled. I'm SOOOO glad it's available on DVD now. Simply stunning and luminous, reminiscent of the work of F.W. Murnau. A truly unique re-creation of a lost art. With an estimated 90% of the original silent films now believed to be lost, we need more people to step up to the plate and make movies like this! I have long had a fantasy of being in a silent film myself; the nearest I can manage is an opera with a heroine that recalls that era -- Google ""passion of persephone""",1210377600,6,578,4.411214953271028
8138182,5,B000HC2LSU,"Unique idea, well-executed, screened with an original score performed live by an orchestral group which makes it that much more emotional, charming and touching. Shot on, I believe, a hand-crank 1920's (?)camera for the most part (or perhaps entirely). Even if it weren't so absolutely compelling and interesting to watch and listen to, the story itself is so charming, uplifting, enlightening, if not a bit heartbreaking, that it alone deserves to be experienced. Loved it, and would see it again live in a heartbeat if it were to come back to town. Bought the dvd. It won several awards, I believe, in one of the San Fransisco film festivals, and I expect is the first of many great films by Milford Thomas. He is a director with a natural talent for both creative film-making and strikingly touching visual storytelling.",1168646400,5,823,4.928057553956834
