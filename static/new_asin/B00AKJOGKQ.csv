5447935,5,B00AKJOGKQ,"I started watching this movie and then my wife came home. She saw the box and said ""you're watching a kung fu movie?"" and rolled her eyes... 4 minutes later, she was on the couch beside me deeply involved in the story.
This is a great movie for anyone who's ever been interested in kung fu, china, Shaolin and history. It's also showcases the lives of 4 people who followed their dreams and have to deal with all sorts of obstacles on the way (I don't want to give away too much of the plot).
Highly recommended and would love to see more from this director!",1356134400,,558,4.273584905660377

8553135,3,B00AKJOGKQ,"I love martial arts and watching all the mystical things of shaolin monks...I already knew from the reviews this wasn't going to be a bunch of amazing demonstrations, but it takes place mostly in China and has storylines split to follow four main individuals, and their quest towards becoming the real shaolin.",1397088000,,310,4.980769230769231
8553136,5,B00AKJOGKQ,I always love watching martial arts and was curious about Shaolin temple now. What I saw was the reality of this beautiful legend...,1389571200,,132,4.782608695652174
8553137,4,B00AKJOGKQ,"This film is set up in perfect doc form. It follows a young monk in training and a few young men from the ""west"" experimenting with their interest in shaolin ways. Their dedication is tested, thier focus is tested their romanticism is blended with reality, thier exhaustion is documented, the high moments too. This piece shows a full spectrum for the viewer to understand the basics of what dedication and devotion to a art such as this would take to incorporate into your own life.
I say it's shot in true doc form because the camera is not ever played to, its more about visual access,  it's just easy and shot very raw and real which makes you feel welcome and able to study the access into a wonderful world that you would most likely not be able to get into. Check this film out it was made with great energy and dedication and shows the viewer a small window into a art you could spend lifetimes mastering..... Well done!",1385337600,,928,4.458823529411765
8553138,5,B00AKJOGKQ,Loved this film. It gives some real insight into the present-day culture of kung fu in China. A bit more elaboration of how the styles have evolved over time would have been nice.,1359331200,,179,4.454545454545454
8553139,5,B00AKJOGKQ,"I appreciate that this documentary not only depicted both the mystical nature of Shaolin, but then went about showing the reality of what it means to live it, both as an insider and foreigner. It made me wonder whether or not I would have tapped out, at what point, and for what reasons. Westerners seeking eastern practices, but eastern traditions influenced subtly by western culture as well. Very interesting!",1357603200,,412,4.9855072463768115
8553140,5,B00AKJOGKQ,"This documentary is an excellent glimpse into the real Shaolin, which helped to dispel the romanticized view that I had.  The director's choice of subjects was very well done and the footage is amazing.  The film provides incredible access to this way of life.

Highly recommended !!",1357430400,,283,4.9787234042553195
8553141,5,B00AKJOGKQ,"Having also seen the Shaolin monks perform on stage before like one of the previous reviewers, this excellent documentary provides great insight not only into the dedication and will that it takes to get there, but also does this by providing the fascinating story of the journey of 4 very different individuals as they pursue their dreams of training in the Shaolin temple. Excellent!",1357344000,,385,5.03125
8553142,5,B00AKJOGKQ,"I don't typically bother to write reviews, particularly about movies, but after watching the Real Shaolin I felt compelled to take the time to add my thoughts.  I have actually seen the Shaolin Monks perform live on multiple occasions, and was always blown away by their grace and the unbelievable moves and stunts they performed.  In my mind, these disciples honed their craft in small mountain monasteries a la The Golden Child.  (I, uh uh I, uh uh I want the knife....)

This movie changed all that.

The reality of Shaolin is that the schools are more like gulag-style factories where abandoned children train night and day in squalor in the hopes of escaping a life as a farmer.  Beatings are the norm, and nutrition is a pipe dream.  And the ancient arts of kung fu have given way to the pageantry of Wushu and the UFC-styled marketable fighting of Sanba.

One of the most eye-opening documentaries I have seen in quite a while.  Also, I watched it with my fourteen year daughter (not a martial arts aficionado by any stretch of the imagination) and she was glued to it as well.  Highly recommended.",1356652800,,1105,4.649484536082475
8553143,5,B00AKJOGKQ,"As an avid student of Shaolin Kung Fu, I've been fascinated by the idea of training in China. The Real Shaolin is the first documentary I've found which has gone deeply inside this world and shown what life is like as a westerner in the world of Chinese martial arts. It provided excellent perspective on the different types of students who come to China to train, their motivations, their triumphs and their disappointments. Production values are excellent and the storytelling quite good. Thank you to Director Alex Lee for going deeply into this world and showing how it works.",1356307200,,580,4.8686868686868685
