970832,4,6305072795,"I first saw this film on a scratched-to-heck DVD from Netflix from back in the day, which eventually led to my buying it, which led to me buying the new DVD release, and then to this Blu Ray. The original DVD looked like crud though a layer of mud, and the new DVD release had aliasing problems (like an early-gen PlayStation 2 game). Is this at last the perfect version of this classic? Well...

First of all this film is an absolute classic in my book. The story, the characters, the dialog, and especially the music, animation, artwork, and action and absolutely exquisite in that ultra-cheesy 80's way. Seriously, this is the ultimate 80's sci-fi action anime film that grows on you more every time you see it.

The first time I saw this film I thought it was an incredible but somewhat pointless film as the biker-derby gang took on a tank for no good reason, and found themselves kicked around from one situation to another without a real message of good and evil or even what they were fighting for. In truth though, after many, many repeat viewings I've come to appreciate that the characters are so strong, the world so compelling, and the direction so fantastic that the whole adventure-film feeling of having no idea what's coming next sears this film into your consciousness. Seriously, the biker derby at the beginning, the attack on Io, the monobike chase to flee the city police, and the showdown with the Octo at the film's conclusion are some of the greatest scenes in any anime ever made.

This Blu Ray has outstanding picture quality (such that it looks like a brand new film made yesterday). The artwork looks absolutely gorgeous and the the animation is beautiful to behold. The sound has been greatly improved over previous releases to the point where I feel like I'm watching this film in the theater on my projector and stereo. The wonderful original English dub is still present which is a joy, but it touches on the only big downside of this release in terms of the actual film.

The English dub is slightly off in its timing which is really annoying. But given how great the picture and sound is, I guess I'll have to live with it (there's no going back to the previous releases). There's pretty much no extras at all (a crummy trailer and English credits aren't exactly what I'd call ""special features"").

Conclusion?

If you don't mind the dub being a little off this is likely to be the best release of this film you will ever see in the United States. This is a film that is absolutely essential to own if you love action anime from the 80's.",1460764800,2,2573,4.570498915401301
970833,4,6305072795,A classic reborn on Blu-ray. The picture is not a huge step up from the DVD which was excellent but this movie does have those extra seconds of footage cut from the original release to make it less Japanese. The original dub and Japanese are here in excellent audio. This is an excellent movie overall about coming of age and sport great animation in the style of AKIRA. Really good. A fan favorite and most people simply don't give this movie a chance. The Blu-ray is excellent and I'm glad I bought it. Sound and picture; great. Extras: almost none.,1455148800,4,551,4.52
970834,5,6305072795,"Beautiful print and transfer.  Excellent use of the movie soundtrack for the menu loop, a step ignored by nearly everybody making disc media.  There are two whole albums of music from Venus Wars and it makes total sense to use that asset.

The movie itself is quite interesting.  The basic scenario is completely original, unlike anything Hollywood has ever imagined.  YAS has tons of superb ideas in all of his work and I really have no idea why Hollywood is not raiding his works for the new material they desperately need.

Not all of the Venus Wars story works, and there are a lot of elements here that seem like YAS wanted to see what they looked like and tossed them  in, but that's the sort of thing that happens with great artists and it doesn't hurt the production.  The snippets of live-action footage at the end are an example of ""what were they thinking?"" but it feels like the answer is ""trying something new"" rather than being cheesy.

The amazing soundtrack from Joe Hisaishi has been a favorite of mine for years.  For those inclined, there are two CDs from this movie.  A Soundtrack and an ""Image"" album and you'll want both, if you like the music.",1454803200,10,1166,4.5576923076923075

970840,3,6305072795,"And to think at one time I enjoyed this movie. It's rare for me to go back and see an anime film I only slightly enjoyed, but I found some time and decided to watch this film again so that I could write a review on it. Unfortunately (or fortunately, however you want to look at it) I guess my standards for anime, and film in general, are higher now then they were when I first watched this film. It was fun back then, now its just wasted potential.

In the year 2079 Venus is an inhabitable planet and home to thousands of people who scratch off a living off the barren soil of their home world. Although it was supposed to be a paradise, free from the wars and violence which have plagued earth for thousands of years, Venus has taken to looking more like a post apocalyptic earth than the green paradise the people envisioned with they first settled the planet. Plants don't grow, corrupt governments rule the land, and war looms ahead for the entire planet. For amusement the citizens of the city of Io, capital of the nation of Ufrodia, preoccupy themselves with dangerous X game like sports involving mono bikes, which are BTW really, really cool.

Sound cool? Well it very well could have been EXTREMELY cool, but ruins all potential it has with an inane script which will make even the most tolerant of anime fans blush with embarrassment. There is simply no describing how awful it is on a consistent basis. Every line, every sentence, every word from either the sub or the dub, is just pathetic. Who wrote this junk? My ten year old little brother has more talent then the writers of this movie. Along with the bad writing, the characters are also pretty badly portrayed, although that could also be attributed to the script. The reluctant hero rebelling against authority, the naive blonde (I don't care how hot she it, she's just too stupid to believe), the feisty red head, the tough/wise mechanic, and all the numerous stupid bikers and overly confident military guys make up the bulk of the clich character types to be found here.

However, this movie has one saving grace which brings it out of the bowls of obscurity and makes it something half way decent, or at least watch able; it has action, good action, and lots of it. If you can put aside the bad writing and horrendous characters (something I'm sure many of you will have no problem in doing) Venus Wars is about two hours of stuff blowing up, people getting shot, and really awesome military hardware destroying everything in sight. It's a riot, there's no mistaking it. From the moment Ishtar invades with their superior weapons and overwhelms the defenders, reminiscent of Germany's invasion of Poland in 1939, until the end the action rarely lets up. The obvious WWII parodies are also there for military history buffs who like seeing old wars fought with new weapons. Venus Wars is WWII; WWII with mono bikes. Cool.

Unfortunately this movies age really shows in the animation. Although the battle scenes are pretty good overall, backgrounds and motion shots are blurry, which could just be the DVD, either way it hurts the eyes. The music was done by the amazing Joe Hisaishi, composer for such amazing scores as Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke.  The music has its moments here and there, but there isn't anywhere close to enough to justify the bold printing on the cover which says ""Features music by Jo Hisaishi, composer for Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro."" The music isn't anywhere near special and is kept as silent as possible for the most part.

Is this a film worth watching? Probability, for those who could care less for character development and realism. Is it worth owning though? I don't think so. Rent this one if you can, otherwise let it go.

Replay Value; low.",1210723200,6,3768,4.6656626506024095
970890,5,6305072795,This is one of the first anime movies I ever watched remember when the sci-fi channel used to do those anime weeks.  My dad used to let me stay up and watch them with him!!!!

970891,3,6305072795,"There are a lot of characters in this cartoon.  So, I am expecting some sort of id-ego-superego (or what the other one called?) kinda model used in many American movies. like... One character represents the ego, another represents the id and the other represents the superego. However, this is not the case.  Character development is very little. The boy is a kid and then half an hour later, he is a man... with little development at all.  It is like they cut away a big piece of the cartoon right in the middle.  And I think this is what this cartoon is all about: from boy to man and becomes a hero.  The story does not focus much on the other characters either.

On the other hand, the animation is very good. It is one of the best looking cartoon I have seen.

So, to sum it up, if you look at this as an epic movie, it is a bad epic movie with a little bit of action.  If you look at this as an action flick, it is pretty good action movie but it is very short.",1190764800,3,967,4.079365079365079

970893,4,6305072795,"I watched this on TV and I will give a review. I watched it because there wasn't anything better on. So it's about a hostile takeover in Venus and a group of ordinary people try to survive the war-torn planet. I liked this movie it gave a nice amount of action and it has this feel in a war movie where all you give a damn is will the characters make it or come back in a body bag. However, thrilling as the movie is I had a problem for liking the characters some of them are stupid and some I don't give a care. Like this one girl where she left the safety with the gun trying to kill the general I was laughing and crying at the same time. Not to mention the story I cared less of the nonsense dialogue.

970894,5,6305072795,"This is the first manga film that I watched, and the reason to develop my interest and look for more movies. And thanks to the baby I found ""Akira"", for which I won't stop being gratful. The movie, simply said, has it all. There's action, thrill, criticizing general issues, a bit of romance. The big influnce comes from Hiro - he's a boy, deeply interested and amazed by all the unfairness in this world, and as we can see, does everything in his powers to fix it all. He's an amazing character cause of his seriousness and bravery.

970895,5,6305072795,"When you go back to the 80s anime and early anime, you see less of the bouncy fanservice existent EVERYWHERE. You go back to the anime/manga back then, it had more of the violence and grit you would crave for. It had less of that feeling where it's quickly hashed out, or obviously influenced and tailored to the American viewers.

The only gripes is the views of back then, such as sexism against women (who usually play the extreme princess who can't fight), and music from that time (this is selective to some). Hiro isn't the usual gundam main character: why're we fighting? oh well, i'll fight to protect. Hiro is more of what you'd expect, a hotheaded teenager. Another, thing is that action sci-fi in general, is great at retelling lessons completely based on reality. This is no exception. Venus Wars resembles a lot of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (it only took a couple days to gain a surrender). The monobikes w/ railguns, chase scene, liberation, etc. Its all there. The rousing action, where the whole city gets pissed off and overthrows their occupiers!

After growing up on handpainted cels, you just don't feel the love and dedicated work presented in modern anime, which uses computer. It feels so impersonal and for the money. Don't get me wrong anime is great, no matter what era its from. Its just that, it's no longer as conceptual art in motion, you no longer see any of the stages, its too clean and straight lined that its like standing in a decontaminated room. Or eating a well-done steak. When you have an explosion, it's supposed to be messy, and this anime gives that to you.",1117670400,24,1608,4.698581560283688
970896,4,6305072795,"Gundam veteran Yoshikazu Yasuhiko's  ""The Venus Wars"" is a great war anime with a moderately well-done, if somewhat cliched plot and surprisingly deep characters. It deals with many themes: how occupation affects people, the role of journalists in war, as well as the loyalties and feelings that drive people to fight.

  Released originally in 1989, the style of animation is very much of the time with muted colors and large smoke filled explosions. The film begins with an Earth reporter, Susan Somers, landing on a colonized Venus, hoping to get a great story out of the brewing war between the states of Aphrodia and Ishtar. Meanwhile, Hiro, a reckless young battlebike racer, is busy trying to win a race for his team The Killer Commandos. After a few laps the people in the stadium notice a group of airships approaching, tanks begin to descend and the Aphrodian capital of Io is bombed. Hiro and his friends leave the stadium, running into Susan who was taping the chaos and from then on her life becomes intertwined with that of the Killer Commandos.

  The film is filled with beautiful shots of the battered Venus landscape, using light skillfully to highlight the different shades of red, which is the predominant color of the planet. The action scenes are fast paced and well directed, the scene where Hiro and his team decide to take on an Ishtari tank occupying the stadium is especially well handled. With the characters treating the attack as a game until they realize just how dangerous their situation is. The film also has many somber scenes where the characters reflect on the cost of war. One scene that stood out in particular, was when Maggy, Hiro's girlfriend, is brought to tears when she sees her favorite shopping spot littered with bullet holes and bomb damage.

  The Japanese voice acting is good if not spectacular. The English dub is fairly well done with the voice of General Donner standing out, being appropriately rough, yet elitist. Though the English dub script does swerve radically from the subtitle translation, changing the meaning of entire scenes in the process.

  The music by acclaimed composer Jo Hisaishi is fantastic, at times optimistic and in other times crushed and cynical. Fast paced during the action scenes and slow during the more evocative moments. Though it does get redundant, since the majority of the music is just a variation of the main theme.

  Overall, ""The Venus Wars"" is a great science fiction action film mixed in with interesting characters and a satisfying story. It is not a classic, yet it is a great war film to watch from time to time.",1095120000,10,2614,4.853603603603603
970897,5,6305072795,"This is a great moive for anime lovers. Its story is nice and well put together.

970898,5,6305072795,"takes place in the far future, where humans have already colonized several planets including the planet, Venus. People lived in peace for many years until the humans meet up with an alien race (which look and act human), trying to dominate the universe. The humans were no match alien's weaponry and technology. They weren't even able to make a dent on their battle tanks. The Human alliance did not know how to penetrate the armor of the monstrous tanks the aliens used. The aliens eventually conquered every colony on Venus and became the new world government. The people of Venus were oppressed by the alien's tyranny until a small group of rebels started to fight back and win. Venus wars can be compared to  World War II and how the Germans, tried to dominate the world. Especially the analogy of the tyranny of the aliens and their battle tanks with thick armor which the allies had trouble penetrating. Good story telling with a science fiction twist, and the characters where well developed. Venus Wars feels like an epic movie, but without have the epic length of one (which is a good thing). My only complaint with this movie is that it seems like it was supposed to continue, but a sequel was never made! Silky animation, minor blood and gore.

970899,5,6305072795,"If you're looking at Venus Wars, then it probably means you saw it Saturday morning many years ago on the Sci-Fi channel. Hey, it's nothing to be ashamed about. We all did. And let's face it, their Saturday morning animes really did introduce many of us into the genre. Without it, very little of us would know of anime, except for things like ""Spirited Away"" or ""Princess Mononoke"". Venus Wars was the first anime I had ever seen (save Gigantor), and I still hold a special place for it.
For starters, its art style is very interesting. Venus has a very post-apocalyptic type atmosphere to it. Most of the places are destroyed from war and very deserted. All of the combat takes place while the characters are riding on futuristic motorcycles, so the movie is very fast paced. To top it all off, it has one of the best soundtracks ever to grace an anime. Unfortunately, the movie suffers from very mild characters. Hiro is just a punk kid who happens to be able to drive, and his girlfriend is really annoying. To further annoy you, some of the voice actors are beyond horrible. So, it can be mixed.
But if you just look past the voices, you will find that this is a very good movie. If you just want a fun ""blow up stuff"" movie with some distinguished style to it, then you will definitely enjoy this.",1054339200,,1303,4.456066945606694
970973,5,6305072795,"Venus Wars is a great feature film that combines great animation, compelling story-line, and realistic action.  Those new to anime might think that anime is too gory or too lude to watch.  While others think that anime is just a cartoon and should not be taken seriously.  Venus Wars is middle ground for anyone who wants to start watching anime.
  The animation is very detailed, from the monobikes to the landscapes and characters; they are all well done.  The charachters have depth.  They are not confusing with no history as to why they behave the way that they do.  There is death and violence, but its not overdone and is in line with what's going on in the movie.  The story line seems believeable, in my eyes, and its an anime movie that doesn't do anything so unrealistic that its totally unbelieveable.
  The main character is Hiro, a rebellious mono bike (motorcycle with one wheel)racer.  He and his motorcycle racing team are busy with the ins and outs of living on Venus, when they are thrust into a war with another country.  All of their lives and dreams are put on hold and they must choose to fight for what they believe in.  He and his friends learn that fighting for what you believe comes at a great cost.  Many of Hiro's friends die fighting for their freedom.  Its also a tale of lost love.
  The action sequences between the monobikes and tanks are spectacular.  It makes you want to run out and race on a motorbike yourself.

When one of the two continents  on Ishtar moves in, devastating the weaker one, anything goes.  Monobikers  (racing teams of single-wheeled motorcycles) are soon caught up in the  resistance movement to battle against the oppressive occupational force.

You feel the thud and rocking of the  tanks as they send steel rain down range, and you see the smoke, and debris  kicked up in a warzone.  Fantastic animation, and not bad voice acting on  the part of the dubbed version (one of the better dubbings I have seen).  I  highly recommend it...and...a wonderful point: there are no dead parts.
