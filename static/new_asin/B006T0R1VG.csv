5015453,5,B006T0R1VG,"I have literally fallen in love with Brunetti and Venice, despite the German with english subtitles.  Beautifully done and topical.",1349136000,,131,5.55
5015454,5,B006T0R1VG,The German staff has done an excellent job of transferring Donna Leon's novels to the TV screen. The acting is top notch and the setting is superb. The only negative is the way Elettra smiles at the Commissario Brunetti. It seems more provocative then Leon intended.,1339718400,,266,4.804347826086956
5015455,5,B006T0R1VG,"Amazon for amazing service!
Product excellent as I expected.
Very good cinematography, respecting the novel,
the characters are as I imagined them when I red the book.",1337040000,2,167,5.222222222222222
5015456,5,B006T0R1VG,"I have all of Donna Leon's books and look forward to new ones as they come out every other year.  Now I like the videos as well, particularly with Uwe Kockisch as Brunetti.  I didn't know how it would be with the dialogue in German rather than in Italian, (I speak neither), but with the subtitles it doesn't seem to matter.  The video follows the written story very closely, and the subject matter is always current.  I hope they will continue to make videos of all her books.",1333756800,6,477,4.386363636363637
5015457,5,B006T0R1VG,"This series is -- at least for the American viewer who is sick and tired of the same old same old -- a revelation. The filmmakers took great writing by Donna Leon and faithfully executed her vision of a muy simpatico Venice cop doing his job in Italy's most scenic setting. In each of these 90-minute stories, Brunetti is allowed to be a caring father and husband, a non-violent thinking policeman who solves crimes by gathering and evaluating information, a citizen's citizen. No car chases (in a city without them), no shoot-em-ups, just patience and brain power. Finally, a mystery series that appeals to the heart -- and shows that truly good police work need not pit a citizenry against an adversarial police force. Each of the double DVD sets in these (up to now) six volumes is worth buying and viewing again and again.",1331424000,11,826,4.703448275862069

5015462,4,B006T0R1VG,The transfer from book to screen have been very successful and we love to see Venice over and over again!,1399766400,,105,4.3
5015463,5,B006T0R1VG,The females in this series are all very beautiful and they are treated with respect for just being female and the men treat them as equals without showing any malice.,1367193600,,166,4.566666666666666
5015464,5,B006T0R1VG,"The series comprise an intelligently written crime drama in German (English subtitles) set in Venice, Italy which I originally saw on public TV. The setting will certainly puzzle some on account of the language chosen, but the stories are very well done, the level of gun fights is quite restrained, and perhaps not least, I enjoy listening to the original German.",1364774400,,364,4.983606557377049
5015465,5,B006T0R1VG,Was a bid different to have Italian mystery spoken in German with English subtitles. But it was Venice and Brunetti so who cares!,1364083200,,129,4.6521739130434785
5015466,5,B006T0R1VG,"Beautiful Venice.  Great plots.  Took some time getting used to German being spoken rather than Italian.  The characters speak
Italian only with greeting words.",1362614400,,160,5.583333333333333
5015467,4,B006T0R1VG,"Great entertainment, quality production. Never get tired of Venice. Acting is good, miss hearing Italian spoken. The family episodes add depth to brunetti's caracters development.",1353888000,,179,6.2

8503855,5,B006T0R1VG,"I love the Donna Leon mysteries as brought to life in this tv series.  The acting is superb and the views of Venice are wonderful.  I wish I could go there.
The stories are faithful to the spirit of Donna Leon's books, but do not stick slavishly to the books.",1470787200,,259,4.16

8503857,5,B006T0R1VG,"I discovered this series at our library when I was looking for something to practice my German and immediately fell in love with the shows. They are Masterpiece Mystery, only better -- charming, real-life characters with individual quirks, good, well-crafted mysteries, and gorgeous Venice as a backdrop (I don't want to know if it's all really a painted movie set!). I've watched them all now (and am starting to rewatch) and have begun buying them as gifts. I would skip the first four -- Brunetti and his wife are played by different actors and they just are not as good. But starting with #5, with Uwe Kockisch and Julia Jaeger, they are superb. Our library only carries 18, but I see there are 24 out now. Something to look forward to! (I love this little tidbit from Wikipedia: As a youth, Kockisch spent a year in jail for trying to escape from East Germany.)",1453248000,,866,4.62987012987013
