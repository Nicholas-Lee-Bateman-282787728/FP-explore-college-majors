8688492,5,B00PKRKBJS,Hilarious commentary by Taz and Tenay !!!  Great matches too !!,1456790400,,63,4.7272727272727275
8688493,3,B00PKRKBJS,"The The British Invasion (Magnus and Douglas Williams)-Gunner and Chris Sabin tag team match was a really solid opening match with a hot crowd, which is always good. The Samoa Joe and Bad Bones-Robbie E and Christopher Daniels tag team match has a better flow and pacing overall along with some better overall action then the opener. The Rockstar Spud and Bully Ray-Mr. Anderson and Austin Aries tag team match was too long but had it's entertaining moments. The Wolves (Richards and Edwards)-Beer Money (Roode and Storm) tag team match was basic and slower beginning, good heat segment and then really got going down the stretch with some bear falls and great tag team moves and a reactive crowd. The ending felt a little anticlimactic, but this was the best match on the show thus far. The Ethan Carter III and Eric Young-Kazarian and Curry Man tag team bout was solid and shorter then the earier bout thus making it less painful to watch. The Sam Shaw and Abyss-Zema Ion and Jessie Godderz tag team match was too long and unenjoyable. The Elimination Tag Team Match: Gail Kim, LeiD Tapa and Alpha Female vs. ODB, Velvet Sky and Madison Rayne was a dud. The Joker's Wild Gauntlet match was also too long,nothing really special and poor at best. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10.",1421020800,,1277,4.629955947136564
8688494,5,B00PKRKBJS,"I was a fan of the Jokers Wild concept. This time we get a few team reunions. I have never laughed harder watching a wrestling event. It was filled with great ""feel-good"" matches that are hilarious with funny commentary. The team of Bully Ray and Rockstar spud was awesome. This is a great event to watch if you need some great entertainment.",1420502400,,342,4.532258064516129
8688495,4,B00PKRKBJS,"This PPV is part of the second season of the ""TNA: One Night Only"" series which are just stand alone PPV events (shows that occur outside the current storylines & happenings on IMPACT Wrestling) with each one having a special theme with this season being more recently taped than the previous season so it reflects the talents current gimmicks & feuds.  The second edition of ""Jokers Wild"" was the theme of this event taped during their tour of the United Kingdom where tag teams are put together via random drawing to compete against each other with the winning teams advancing to a gauntlet battle royal with the sole winner receiving a check for $100,000 as Mike Tenay & Taz did commentary on this show.

Gunner & Chris Sabin vs. Douglas Williams & Magnus - The former tag team championship combination of the British Invasion reunited in their home country here with them looking like they hadn't lost a step with their classic double team offense & diverse strategy of grounding their opponents to take away their individual advantages of the other team while there were clear issues between Sabin & Gunner as Sabin was heavily on defense with Gunner regaining control with his power advantage only for Sabin to attempt to steal the spotlight resulting in both men tagging themselves back in frequently.  This was a nice tag match that told a good story of two people working as a team against their opponents working as individuals.

Robbie E & Christopher Daniels vs. Samoa Joe & Bad Bones - Bad Bones was a local talent who participated in the  international Gut Check as him & Joe dominated both Robbie & Daniels with their power advantage easily catching both men various times while avoiding their offense causing Daniels & Robbie to resort to cheating tactics to gain the advantage for the team in what was pretty much an easy dominate match for one team.

Bully Ray & Rockstar Spud vs. Mr. Anderson & Austin Aries - Rockstar Spud heavily trash talked his opponents while standing behind Bully Ray only to show how much ""his bark is as big as his bite"" from the moment Bully Ray tagged him in & hurt his own hand in the process with him getting beat up so bad that the crowd was actually getting behind him with Bully trying to motivate him & even work together as a team while Spud kept doing Bully mannerisms & trying to channel the spirit of his former partner Devon only to not have the same effect on more than one occasion including one time where everyone just stopped & look at him with a result that pretty much left everyone speechless & one of his opponents couldn't help but just laugh when it happened.  This was the most talked about match from this event not because of the actual wrestling but because of the heavy entertainment value of everyone involved with Rockstar Spud being the highlight as I personally just couldn't stop laughing at his antics from start to finish & his interaction with Bully Ray was classic comedy.

The Wolves vs. Bobby Roode & James Storm - One of the best tag team in TNA history in Beer Money reunited here to face off against one of the greatest tag teams in recent wrestling history (in & outside of TNA) in The Wolves as they took control with various double team combinations that ultimately left Roode & Storm in a compromising position before Beer Money was able to regain control once they were finally on the same page singling out one member of their opposition & heavily working him over before The Wolves were able to regain control & use the same strategy against them as both teams continued to trade momentum executing their various trademark double team combinations against each other.  This was a modern day tag team dream match that delivered & was the match of the night strictly based off their wrestling.

Kazarian & Curry Man vs. Ethan Carter III & Eric Young - ""Is the enemy of my enemy my friend or my enemy?""  Well both sides of that catchphrase applied here as Curry Man & Eric Young had no problems facing off with each other's partners but decided to take a different action whenever they were face to face while Kazarian & EC3 got on the same page attempted to work together only for one man to go into business for himself as the referee had to keep reminding them who their partners were while even one man had to remind the other that he was his partner in the match only to get the response ""I know, IT SUCKS!""  Eric Young's comedy is usually hit & miss but everyone played it out perfectly here as this was another match that was very entertaining.

DJ Zema Ion & Jessie Godderz vs. Abyss & Samuel Shaw - Two thirds of the the BroMans against what can be described as the most mentally disturbed tag team in TNA history as Abyss was easily dominate from the start without taking much effort including Ion getting completely burned out doing repeated chops with no effect but Shaw & Abyss kept having the issues with each other starting from each other giving blind tags to Shaw constantly focusing on Christy at ringside to the point where even Abyss of all people called him ""creepy"" allowing the BroMans to take advantage of the situation with double teaming when possible.  This was another match similar to earlier where it was about one group working as a team against the others working as individuals.

Elimination Match: O.D.B., Velvet Sky, Madison Rayne vs. Gail Kim, Lei'd Tapa, Alpha Female - Alpha Female was another local talent TNA used during this tour as this match as the match started out as a battle of the ""pigeons"" between Tapa & Velvet only for Tapa to showcase her dominance over each member of the opposing team individually at some points in the match while Velvet attempted to use a ""hit & move"" strategy only to get an unexpected distraction on more than one occasion that did help benefit & not help her team while issues were definitely surfacing between a set of partners with one constantly ordering around the other with things really coming to ahead when she decided to go into business for herself & let her ego get out of hand.  The match wasn't much past telling the story of the two teammates having constant issues with each other.

Gauntlet Battle Royal Match - This battle royal happened ""Royal Rumble"" style where a new competitor entered in after a certain amount of time with the last man standing receiving a winners check resulting in some moments such as who the first two participants were, the interaction between some of the teams from earlier in the night, everyone on the same page as far as who was the most dominate man in the match, and the antics of Rockstar Spud as this was entertaining & served it's purpose.

The talent from TNA both in & outside of the ring praised this event as the best ""One Night Only"" event to date & I'll agree to a degree that this was without a doubt one of the best ones they've done as everything clicked here from start to finish with the various tag team reunions to the most unusual tag team combinations complete with solid wrestling & entertainment throughout the matches with Rockstar Spud definitely making the lasting impression of the night so it's one event I would check out.",1416441600,,7166,4.602664576802508
