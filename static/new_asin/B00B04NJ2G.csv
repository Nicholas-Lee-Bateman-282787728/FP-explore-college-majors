Thie version is very, very different (as of course it would be!) from the staged version. I was quite surprised to find Bette Midler in the lead. She just doesn't look the part!!",1379030400,,273,4.372549019607843
5539881,3,B00B04NJ2G,Better milder in Gypsy is just great! a fantastic production all the way around. South Pacific is one of my favorite stage shows but this production does not thrill me.,1376006400,,168,4.633333333333334
5539882,4,B00B04NJ2G,"Both productions are given full film treatment, featuring two leads who are ideal for the roles they play -- Bette Midler as Rose and Glenn Close as Nellie Forbush. Would be a five-star review except for the fact that Mill Creek made it a no frills package. Just the disks. A sheet with lists of musical numbers and performers would have helpful.",1373328000,2,346,4.596774193548387
8560134,3,B00B04NJ2G,"These two TV Versions are classic examples of How TO-- and HOW NOT TO-- bring Broadway Musicals to TV. My goodness, talk about your musical mixed bag!! One production gets everything wrong, while the other gets everything right.
  ""SOUTH PACIFIC"": While this TV Version of ""South Pacific"" does not commit the great sin of the 1958 film version-- putting color filters on the camera, giving every musical number a changing color hue, far different sins are committed against this Putlizer Prize winning musical here. I love Glenn Close. She's a wonderful actress in dramas like ""Dangerous Liaisons"", but she is far too old and totally wrong for the role of Nellie Forbush, the young nurse forced to confront her prejudices while stationed on South Pacific islands during World War II. Since Close is the executive producer, perhaps she couldn't resist playing Nellie? In any event, her desire got in the way of good casting sense. If she loved ""South Pacific"", why didn't she respect the original musical? Scenes and songs are moved around and altered so much that Rodgers and Hammerstein's powerful messages are muted or missing completely. The cast, including Harry Connick, Jr., flounders around and is mostly terrible. Rodgers and Hammerstein are undoubtedly rolling in their graves over this destruction of one of their greatest musicals.
  ""GYPSY"": By rights, Tyne Daly should have played Mama Rose in this TV Version of ""Gypsy"", since she had won a Tony Award for a Broadway revival. But ""Gypsy"" was offered to CBS with Bette Midler as a package deal. Take it, or the musical goes to NBC. CBS took it with Midler (and Ethel Merman also lost the movie version to Rosalind Russell, but that's another story). This ""Gypsy"" cooks on all cylinders because composers Jule Styne and Stephen Sondheim insisted this version follow Arthur Laurents astringent Broadway libretto. It does. All that is missing is a brief scene change reprise of ""Some People"", where Mama Rose picks up some chorus boys on the road.
  Normally, I don't like Bette Midler, finding her too loud, obnoxious, and overbearing. Well, loud, obnoxious and overbearing also describe Mama Rose, the ultimate stage mother from hell, perfectly. So Midler's casting is perfect. Mama Rose is also tragic. She's so ambitious and driven, she does not see she is driving everyone away from her. Rose is even unfazed when her favored daughter June runs away. She has a ""spare daughter"", the untalented and cast aside Louise (Cynthia Gibb) left over, so she will become the star instead. Peter Riegert is fine as manager Herbie, and Cynthia Gibb is very good as Louise, especially when the tables turn, and Louise, now transformed into star stripper Gypsy Rose Lee, tells Mama to let go of her and get a life of her own. Nothing is coming up roses now, and Mama Rose can't take it. Midler sings ""Everything's Coming Up Roses"" like a crazy lady. But that, remember , is before her real ""Rose's Turn""  musical nervous breakdown at the end. Watch out! ""Hold your hats and halleilujah-- Mama's gonna show it to you!""",1444608000,3,3068,4.922630560928433

8560138,5,B00B04NJ2G,"This is my favorite version of South Pacific, mature and deals with racial prejudice.  More realistic about life in Pacific in WWII.  Bette Medler is a great Mama Rose, more brash and vulgar than Merman or Rosalind Russell.  Authentic.",1431561600,,235,4.9743589743589745

8560140,5,B00B04NJ2G,"These are very decent TV versions of two of the masterpiece musicals from Broadway's Golden Age.  It's probably impossible to do them badly with any kind of network TV budget behind them and decent casting.  Mitzi Gaynor in the movie version of South Pacific had to beat out Jack Warner's first choice: Elizabeth Taylor.  Even stranger, Doris Day was passed over reportedly because she wouldn't ""audition"" a few songs for some W.B front office suits attending a party she was at.  Mitzi Gaynor was fine, but the movie version  might  have been even better with Doris Day in the role.  Glen Close in this TV version is also fine, but Juanita Hall's Bloody Mary shoes remain a little too big for anybody else to ever fill.  One could debate forever whether the love interest in the movie version, France Nuyen, or the nameless beauty in this TV version, is the more breathtaking to behold.

Ethel Merman's performance, in Gypsy's original Broadway cast, is considered by many to be one of great major musical performances of all time (think Rex Harrison and Yul Bryner).  If it weren't for Ethel Merman, Bette Midler in this TV version might be my own first choice for Mama Rose.  And Peter Riegert seems way more appropriately cast here than, say, Karl Malden was in the movie version (fine actor though he was).

Heck of a bargain getting these two war horse musicals, more than adequately performed, in a single DVD package for a rock bottom price.",1403827200,2,1449,4.729083665338646
8560141,4,B00B04NJ2G,"TV adaptations of two of Broadway's greatest musicals at a great price. Well worth watching if for no other reason than Bette Midler's performance as ""Madame Rose"".",1398124800,,164,5.111111111111111
8560142,4,B00B04NJ2G,"Saw the Glen Close SOUTH PACIFIC television version & enjoyed it much. Its well done.  Glen does a stellar singing job & takes on Mary Martin's nuances. GYPSY? I'm very familiar with this musical. Have seen it on Broadway several times with different Momma Roses. I do daresay, that while Bette has a bit of a 'struggle' with a few song ranges, she absolutely NAILS the performance within EACH song and outside of it as Momma. Loved Herbie. Unexpectedly fell head over heels for Tulsa's 'All I Need Now Is The Girl'; a vivid athletic virtuoso dance performance. Nureyev-worthy. They kept almost the entire original script. Good good fun. Bette is heart-rendering as Momma Rose. She is earnestly LIKABLE which separates her from some of the others who've taken Rose on. ROSES TURN is gut-wrenching. Good quality DVD.",1388448000,5,815,4.905797101449275
8560143,3,B00B04NJ2G,"The movie ""South Pacific"" is so much better then the tv version in every way.  ""Gypsy'' was good mainly because of Bette Midler.  Neither  production was more then just ok as far as video and sound.  The dvd was so cheap I couldn't pass it up.",1386201600,3,243,4.217391304347826
