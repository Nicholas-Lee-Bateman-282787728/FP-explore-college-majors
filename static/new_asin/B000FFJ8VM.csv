2562473,5,B000FFJ8VM,"I will be brief, as the stories are familiar. These stories have been seemingly ""Done to death"" over the years. With knowing that, I believe you will be surprisingly pleased with these versions. I found many of the musical numbers very entertaining andthe animation is not bad. What made me take the time to write this 5 star review is the way the writers spin each tried-&-true story in a manner that kept me entertained and somewhat guessing how it would end. To accomplish THAT with this material deserves 5 stars. That and the way they handled the very unfortunate Romanov family. Kudos to the entire creative team. Well done, with many thanks!",1425686400,3,648,4.743362831858407
2562474,3,B000FFJ8VM,I prefer more of the old-school tales. The magic mirror being a comedian was pretty annoying for me and my child.  But it was okay.  Entertaining.  if they were all like that I probably wouldn't watch anymore of them.  I'm not trying to teach my four-year-old sarcastic impersonations and over her head humor.,1425340800,5,309,4.773584905660377

2562515,5,B000FFJ8VM,"My 3 and 4 year old daughters love the three stories in this series: Snow White, Anastasia and Mulan. Each of them takes great poetic license from the original story lines that I grew up with, but they are well narrated and the graphics are pleasing. I have watched all three with my girls to make sure they are appropriate. They definitely are. I REALLY enjoyed watching Snow White because the ""Mirror, Mirror on the Wall"" is a real character and the famous voice impersonations are excellent. They are good enough that I thought maybe Rich Little had been employed to do them. However, there are no credits given for impersonated voices, so I have no idea who does them. That's a shame - the person deserves credit!",1437696000,,717,4.609375
2562516,2,B000FFJ8VM,"The characters look a bit strange, and it is, so far, the worst version of Anastasia I have ever seen.  As I haven't seen the Mulan or Snow White version,  I can't really judge them, but for the Anastasia one, the songs are strange and the characters are weird.  I feel like it doesn't really have that much of a purpose, and doesn't have any strong themes and valuable lessons.  It's okay though,  I guess.

The characters are obnoxious, songs are annoying, animation is weak, and comedy is pathetic. It must be student animators, because No one could've made money on this.
