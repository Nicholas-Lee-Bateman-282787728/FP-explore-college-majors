8624245,3,B00EUEWRXA,"I had such high hopes that Eagle Rock Entertainment would take the opportunity to provide ELP fans with an early 1970s concert experience of just the band.  Pictures At An Exhibition (1970) is practically unwatchable with all the ""original seventies special effects"".  Why can't they just give us the concert footage, and if they want to include these outdated effects, make them a separate selection from a DVD menu.  And to make matters worse this DVD is only a portion of the show.  The bonus features from Pop Shop 1971 maybe make the purchase worth the money.  The Birth Of A Band-Live At The Isle Of Wight Festival 1970 DVD follows the same pattern.  If I wanted an Isle of Wight documentary I would have ordered one.  The constant clips of the festival aftermath, power boat races, people on the beach, etc. get in the way of such a phenomenal performance.  The interviews are a nice touch but just put them before or after the show.  Give ELP fans what they deserve - JUST THE CONCERT EXPERIENCE, please.",1382745600,4,1012,4.640449438202247
