8185925,1,B000OPMPYA,"I bought this as a gift. The DVD was damaged. The gift recipiant didn't tell me until it was too late to return. I bought the DVD a second time. When I saw the gift recipiant again, it was after 30 days had passed. He took it home and found it had the same defects as the first. So, my friend now owns TWO defective, unplayable DVD's, and I am out $$$ !",1525737600,,353,3.8493150684931505
8185926,1,B000OPMPYA,"Ordered one, it was a blank. Ordered another, it was a blank too. Hoping Amazon understands that I have two, now, to return and need information about the return procedure please. Zinzendorf is very important in my family history. Loved the book, ""Zenzendorf and the Moravians"". Really looking forward to the DVD some day .....",1523750400,,327,4.963636363636364
8185927,5,B000OPMPYA,Too good,1498608000,,8,3.5
8185928,5,B000OPMPYA,"I am enjoying this 4 part (1/2 hour each) video on Count Zinzendorf and the Moravian brothers.  It is a narrative style, with lots of little facts given by various historical experts (most appear to be from the Moravian church, which is fine).  Done pretty well I think. Not only did Christ live through these ones, He was also living through them!  This video has encouraged me to find other materials to delve more deeply into how this group of believers fostered the pure love of Christ in them for others.",1438732800,,509,4.571428571428571
8185929,5,B000OPMPYA,worked well for the class - we were studying the life of Zinzendorf,1425686400,,67,4.230769230769231
8185930,5,B000OPMPYA,Great!,1423180800,,6,6.0
8185931,5,B000OPMPYA,"Great DVD, entertaining and informative.  Wish they would have done some later follow ups going deeper into specific parts of his life. His missions adventures, ecumenical efforts, theology of the heart, etc.  This is a GREAT video that can inspire your faith and open your heart...and shock you that someone 300 years ago was pushing for ideas that created serious conflict in his day but would be embraced by many today.  There is so much that people push for thinking its ""new"" but good Ol Zinzendorf was already rocking it with small groups, devotional strategies, printing press, mission trips all over the world, trying to unite Christians, embracing diversity, teaching his group to walk the talk and not Bible beat of intimidate people with fear or confuse people with doctrine.  To walk in love and share Jesus in stories and in lifestyle.  Plus he developed  a system of education for all, including children and women, vocational training, language training, the list goes on.  This video will also lead you to further resources to dig into because of whom they interview.  Dr. Craig Atwood at the Moravian seminary seems to be the leading Zinzendorf guru in North America since Arthur Freeman has passed.  You get to hear great interviews with Dr. Atwood.",1417564800,3,1267,4.966824644549763
8185932,4,B000OPMPYA,I had never heard of the Count and was introduced to him in a text on the history of Christianity. This video is a wonderful effort to fill in the gaps. This man had a great influence on his own time and still continues to influence us today and many have never heard of him.,1357084800,3,275,4.0181818181818185
8185933,5,B000OPMPYA,I would highly recommend this documentary on the life of man who was so instrumental in Christian missions and yet few have heard of him.,1330992000,2,137,4.52
