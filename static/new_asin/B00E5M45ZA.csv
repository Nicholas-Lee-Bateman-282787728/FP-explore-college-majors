8601481,5,B00E5M45ZA,Great PCT film!  I wish there were more!,1428105600,,40,4.0
8601482,5,B00E5M45ZA,"I laughed, I cried, I threw up in my mouth a couple of times. If you love blisters, gluttony, debauchery, and endless miles of walking this movie is perfect for you!

Seriously, this is a unique take on the pct. Best I've seen, very entertaining even if you have no interest in the pct.  I can't recommend this high enough.",1421366400,,323,4.366666666666666
8601483,5,B00E5M45ZA,"The Wizards of the PCT will keep you entertained again and again. Not only are they hilarious, but they are all sexy as hell.",1417392000,,125,4.25
8601484,5,B00E5M45ZA,"Ah.......I remember when I first met the Bad Wizard.  We were sitting at a picnic table at Lake Morena, and Girl Scout showed up with the Wizard.  One look at the Wizard, and I was SURE it would not make it to Canada.  Looks can be deceiving, especially when you're talking about the Bad Wizard.

""Wizards of the PCT"" shows how much FUN a Pacific Crest Trail thru-hike can be.  If that doesn't convince you to watch this movie, it's worth it just to experience falling on the ground with Jester......over and over and over.

Watch ""Wizards of the PCT"", and you'll quickly decide that you MUST hike the PCT.

Then, get this book to plan your hike:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yogi-s-Pacific-Crest-Trail-Handbook-Yogi-s-PCT-Handbook/dp/1627490000/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yogi's Pacific Crest Trail Handbook (Yogi's PCT Handbook)</a>",1376092800,2,874,5.78125
8601485,5,B00E5M45ZA,"The blood, sweat, tears and laughter of hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.  Unrated, but some scenes and words inappropriate for people under 14.",1376006400,2,142,5.173913043478261
8601486,5,B00E5M45ZA,I've thru-hiked the PCT and this film captures the true spirit of the trail. Jester and co. should be very proud.,1376006400,,113,4.428571428571429
8601487,5,B00E5M45ZA,"The cast of characters/misfits in this documentary are thoroughly enjoyable to watch and learn from all at the same time. I recently got into the serious business of hiking & long distance backpacking and ""Jester"" and the gang really depict an accurate portrayal of trail life. Building relationships with completely strangers that will last a lifetime and never taking themselves to seriously. Extremely enjoyable to watch, and highly recommended as I have already loaned my copy out to more than a few friends...but I will require my friends purchase the DVD now.",1376006400,,565,5.1521739130434785
8601488,5,B00E5M45ZA,"Great music, hilarious characters, lots of trail.  If you enjoy seeing people enjoying the outdoors when you aren't yourself out enjoying the outdoors, or prefer to live vicariously, then you must see this film!
