8125365,3,B000FP94X4,"Maciste contro i Mongoli (1963) or Hercules Against the Mongols (USA) uses the same two sons of Genghis Khan that were in Hercules Against the Barbarians (1964).

Mark Forest as Hercules/Maciste is again a stiff bore.

Hercules/Maciste fights against the three sons of Genghis Khan. Not much happens. Scenes are recycled from this and put into Hercules Against the Barbarians (1964).

Sub-standard peplum/Sword-and-sandal flick that has nothing to do with the Sword-and-sandal genre. I think it's just a re-titled Maciste (a Hercules-like figure) flick. Hercules aides the Russians against a Mongol invasion in the 13th century.

Mark Forest plays Hercules and he's a complete bore. Most scenes are dull and boring. There's a bit of interest in the Mongol bad guys played by a few hefty European or American weight lifters, other than that, it's sub-standard stuff.",1405123200,,865,5.291970802919708
8125366,3,B000FP94X4,"""Princess of Troy"" with Gordon Scott is set in classical Greece and is definitely the better of the two films.  Contrary to the impression of the title the story actually is a reworking of the Perseus-Cassiopeia story with a scheming king thrown in.  While intended as a pilot of a children's TV series the acting is reasonable though the special effects leave much to be desired (especially the monster).

By contrast ""Against the Mongols"" with Mark Forrest is just plain weird.  Hercules works best when kept to his Greek roots and this film goes about as far away from those as is possible.  The plot of Hercules facing off against the three sons of Genghis Khan is not helped by the acting, the make up for the Mongols, the occasional soldier dressed in pseudo-Crusader armor, or there is not much action actually involving Hercules, and way too many scenes of the Mongols raiding helpless villages and the brother arguing among themselves.",1265414400,,944,4.838509316770186
