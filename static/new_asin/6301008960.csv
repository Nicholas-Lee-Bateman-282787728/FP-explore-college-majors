314679,4,6301008960,"Film is can be a very personal medium--both for the creator and the viewer, because we both partake in its authoring.  What do I mean by that?  Obviously, the producers, director, actors, etc. participate the in the physical realization of the film.  As an audience, however, we are always creating and recreating the meaning for this content.  As viewers, our minds, experiences and emotions create part of the viewing experience and as we age and change as people, so does our viewing--and hence the authorship--of the film.

For example, I first saw this when it came out in theaters and if I'm not mistaken, I was just about to begin my freshman year in college. I was 18 and had a rather optimistic and callow understanding of the world.  I watched this movie and was entertained, never once did I question the motivations of the main character, nor the logic of the plot.  I really enjoyed this movie.

Of course, years later, I've had the opportunity to watch it as a much older man.  Guess what: I was still entertained, but for different reasons.  The man of today, looks at that film and sees a time capsule to the life he knew back then; he also cringes at the stupidity and sense of entitlement demonstrated by Patrick Dempsey's character, or his immaturity and desperation.  Call it what you will.  Is that the right reason to like a movie?  I don't know; it's probably too slow for what would be the presumptive target demo growing up today.  Or, it might be fun in the same way that watching old movies from the 40s and 50s on TBS was when I was a kid--who knows?

For the pittance Amazon is asking for the DVD, it's worth looking in to.",1512864000,,1652,4.515151515151516

I mean, who couldn't love a young, handsome Patrick Dempsey (I SO wanted his wavy hair!)? Did anyone else buy Goodwill dress shirts, to rip the sleeves off of, after seeing Ronny's makeover?

I still love this movie as much as I did the 1st time ever watching it. It's funny, some cheesy romance & a deeper lesson about money not being able to buy true love & happiness.
 For me, the most memorable scene in this film is Ronnie  learning an African dance he saw on television (he thought he was watching ""American Bandstand""). After learning it, Ronnie performs it at the big dance, not knowing that it would become a huge hit (because everyone followed what the ""popular"" kid did).",1457395200,,600,4.396396396396397

Don't get me wrong, it is not Oscar material; but I'd much rather watch this movie any day of the week than a ""superior comedy"" favored by critics such as the heavily lauded ""Big Chill,"" a film that frankly bored me to death.  ""Can't Buy Me Love"" is utterly watchable; the scene where the kid learns to dance by watching those cheesy videos makes me giggle even today.  I will admit, the happy ending belies a fiction about the reality we live in (no, the good guy in the end most certainly does not get the girl; the pretty girls are always the spoils for the bullies), but there are a lot worse films out there.  It made me laugh quite a few times, and it kept my attention; not many comedies can do that.  Definitely worthwhile to watch at least once.",1436227200,,904,4.357142857142857

316067,3,6301008960,"For some reason, the Powers that Be decided to run an 80s retrospective on HDMN today.  And for some other reason, I decided to watch this film today, mostly because I was too tired to do anything else.

So, let's get this straight:  Patrick Dempsey has to pay some gal a thousand dollars -- and remember, a grand used to be real money, back in the 80s before Obama and the Fed decided to completely ruin the American dollar -- so that she would go out with him for a month, and so that other gals would then want him as he would be deemed desirable.  Hmmm.  Well, evidently, Mr. Dempsey is, or at least was, modest, since gals would surely pay him a lot more than that nowadays to, err, ""date"" him.

Granted, while Mr. Dempsey may have been somewhat of a Pretty Boy back in the 80s, he probably wasn't the Girl Toy that he is nowadays.  Not that he necessarily takes those gals up on those offers, since he's married, and as we all know, married men don't fool around with other women, let alone even look at them.  Look at another 80s and 90s icon, Bill Clinton. as an example, an example of how a man can show true love to only one woman over time.  Ah, how romantic; that's one thing about the 80s that I wish we could bring back. . . .

Well, besides all of the obvious snarkiness of this review, the biggest problem with this film:  it is filled with -- well yeah, it certainly is filled with that, but that's not the only thing it's filled with -- all of these long-winded soliloquies that just would never happen.  And worse than that, you have actors standing around listening to those soliloquies, instead of say punching Mr. Dempsey in the mouth when he says something stupid.  Like that baseball player who Mr. Dempsey disses, where that athlete just stands and listens while Mr. Dempsey talks to him about the good ol' days, and how they used to be such good friends.  Ahhh. . . . .

Well, just another example of another 80s film that probably was a bad idea.  But if you have to watch, get out your leg warmers, open a wine cooler -- or perhaps two, since the more the better with this ""film"" -- and get ready for some good ol' fashioned 80s cheese. While I would like to give this film a higher rating, it is just like that bad bottle of wine that the guy holds at the party, while pouring way too much in that gal's glass, only to regret it later.",1405641600,,2364,4.243303571428571

  Can't Buy Me Love Has Become A Classic Of Its Genre

  Thanks To The Quality Performances Of

  Amanda Peterson & Patrick Dempsey

  And The Inherent Chemistry Which They Shared On Screen

The premise behind ""Can't Buy Me Love"" is that if you attempt to purchase love you are inevitably going to  fail to do so.

The basis for the story is simple enough.  In his desire to become popular,  Ronald Miller (portrayed very convincingly by Patrick Dempsey) attempts to rent the head cheerleader at his high school, Cindy Mancini, played superbly by the beautiful and talented actress, Amanda Peterson, after a suede outfit which she borrowed from her Mother without permission, is ruined when it is stained with wine.

On the following day, while Cindy is unsuccessfully attempting to exchange the damaged garment for a new one at the store her mother purchased it at, Ronald happens to be across the mall at another store, in the process of purchasing a telescope that he has worked all summer, mowing lawns to buy.

As luck would have it, as he is looking through the lens of the telescope  he spots Cindy at the store, and decides to forego the purchase of the telescope, and to instead pitch his idea to rent her in order to become popular.

 As Cindy looks on doubtfully, Ronald explains his plan to her regarding  his intent  to have Cindy's popularity  rub off on him, simply by associating with her for a few weeks.  He confides in her that once he has done so he will be able to join the ""cool"" click of students who'd managed to evade him since they'd all entered high school.

Her hilarious response is that she thinks Ronald has mowed too many lawns.

However, when Ronald starts to leave and Cindy faces the prospect of having to tell her Mother that she's ruined a outfit that she was told not to wear, and the possible grounding that might come with it, she decides to take him up on his ludicrous offer.

Forming a verbal contract, they eventually agree to go through with Ronald's plan for one month, and begin their charade on the first day of their senior year in high school.

Along the way, Ronald's best friend, Kenneth, played convincingly  by actor Courtney Gains, attempts to remain friends with Ronald as he negotiates the landmine set before him, in attempting to convince Cindy's clique that he really is her boyfriend, and as such worthy of their admiration.

Except that Ronald becomes so obsessed with being popular that  he is  willing to do nearly anything to become so, including discarding his old friends in the interest of becoming cool.

As such,  using his innate  charm and the ""new look"" which Cindy has fashioned for him,  Ronald quickly succeeds in doing so.

However, and unfortunately, he also assimilates many of the negative aspects of being popular as quickly as he can acquire them, becoming mesmerized by  his newly found popularity, while completely ignoring his old friends.

Moreover, while in the first few days of their faux relationship we find Cindy attempting to do as little as possible to honor their contract, something interesting starts to happen.

She suddenly finds herself enjoying being around Ronald.

Not only does Cindy  find him to be witty and intelligent, but also down to earth, and displaying a kindness towards her, which allows Cindy something that her popular entourage does not.

 The ability to be who she really is when she is with him; unafraid to reveal things to him about herself that she would never tell her friends, or even her old boyfriend, Bobby, who is now away at college.

Over the next few weeks of their contractual ""month long"" relationship, Cindy finds herself spending more and more time with Ronald as her friends take to him as one of their own, also admiring how genuinely likeable he really is.

Unfortunately, this seems to escape Ronald, as he now, finding himself in unchartered territory, does not know exactly how to deal with his newly found popularity, which he fears he may lose at anytime.

In fact, instead of realizing that under the facade of his new wardrobe and ""Ronnie"" persona, it is really the old Ronald and his charm that has enabled him to gain his new friends.

As such,  Ronald  is now trapped between his old and new worlds, while failing to even notice that the girl of his dreams, the beautiful Cindy, has fallen deeply in love with him by the time their last official date takes place.

When they are sitting together in her car at the end of their date, he disregards Cindy's romantic advances that evening, thinking that she is still just playing along with him as part of their contractual agreement.

 He even fails to notice how affectionate Cindy is being towards him, wanting to kiss him for the first time, and how truly devastated she is when Ronald instead asks her how they should initiate their breakup upon the completion of their contractual arrangement.

Amanda Peterson's performance in this scene is really something special, as she shows  her vulnerability in such an emotive way that you really feel compassion for her character.

 Does she tell Ronald how she really feels about him and risk being spurned, or does she simply conceal her feelings and misery from him, while reverting back to their contractual relationship?

The scene ends with Ronald, now joyous that he has developed a new ""reputation"" as the most popular boy in school, and Cindy, completely frustrated at how clueless Ronald has become to her newly found love for him.

Even the following day at school, once Cindy essentially confronts him in a furtive manner, wanting to discuss their relationship, yet not daring to actually admit that she's fallen in love with him for fear that Ronald may not feel the same way about her - the two characters get sidetracked.

This is the pivotal scene in the movie where what could have been a beautiful moment between the two instead takes an at times very frustrating detour,  which leaves ""Can't Buy Me Love"" viewers desperately wanting to see these two flawed yet wonderful characters finding their way back to each other.

On the way home from school that day, Ronald follows Cindy and remarks in regard to how the slap she gave him during their official breakup was Academy Award worthy.

 Cindy, now accepting defeat in believing that she has lost Ronald, attempts to give him some advice about being popular; describing how she must work at it, or how she herself could easily become an outcast.

Before they part, Ronald gives Cindy a folder to keep her poetry in (she earlier confides in Ronald that she is a poet and that he is the only person who knows about this), while she tells him that ""no matter what happens with the popularity thing"" to not change to please them, and to instead just be himself.

Or course, Ronald then undergoes a significant personality transformation as ""Ronnie,"" becoming far more outgoing, while the real Ronald hides behind this persona, awaiting the inevitable train wreck that later takes place, when Cindy has finally had enough of his obnoxiousness and decides to put him in his place.

Interestingly enough, while Ronald is becoming more and more immersed in his new found superficial personality, Cindy is growing as a young woman, discovering a depth to her person that she had been previously afraid to reveal to anyone.

During the next few months of the fall term of school, she suffers quietly as her two best friends move in on Ronald, while she attempts to come to grips with the fact that she is now truly miserable without him; having realized that not only did she lose someone whom she had unintentionally fallen in love with, but also someone who had in reality become her soulmate.

This situation only becomes worse after the Thanksgiving Holiday where she ends a superficial relationship she began having with an abusive college freshman named Brent,  after her contractual breakup with Ronald, and then attempts to win Ronald back, only to end up being belittled by him.

The climax soon occurs when at a New Years Eve Party, Cindy shows up alone.

Having had a bit too much to drink herself, Cindy soon finds a tipsy Ronald with another young woman, and quoting the poem to her that Cindy entrusted Ronald with while they were still dating under their contractual agreement.

Once  again, Cindy is devastated, dejected, and totally confused by Ronald's behavior, when her old boyfriend, Bobby shows up at the party (after having never called her while he was away at college) and is told that Cindy has been romantically involved with Ronald.

When Bobby confronts her with this information, Cindy tells him that they were only pretending to be dating because Ronald had paid her, to which Bobby replies that that made her a prostitute, and storms out of the party.

Cindy, now having spent the past three months in misery, unleashes her anger at Ronald, exposing the fact that he'd paid her to be his girlfriend, while she berates her friends for being such followers of his.

Ronald is then immediately shunned by the clique which had grown to worship him, and Cindy is now torn between a deep love that she still feels for Ronald, the pain which he has caused her, as well as the guilt she now feels for betraying his confidence at the party.

Over the next few weeks we see how much Cindy has changed and developed into a strong person, as she quietly defends Ronald when her friends continue to demean him for betraying them.

 Moreover, in getting to know and care for him, Cindy now understands the desperation that Ronald experienced in attempting to retain the popularity that he never envisioned himself having, and forgives him for his cruelty and insensitivity, even if she is not quite ready to let him know it.

Ronald, having now managed to rediscover himself, is again interested in developing a real relationship with Cindy, his goal all along.

However, he finds it a challenge as Cindy still won't speak with him.

She won't answer his phone calls, however, with each subsequent time that he calls her, the invisible wall that has built up between them begins to gradually erode, as Cindy comes  to understand that Ronald still truly cares about her, in spite of his terrible behavior.

Ronald even attempts to reach Cindy by calling her Mother's phone line and introducing himself as Donald, since before they formally met on the day that he offered to rent her, Cindy had always thought that his name was Donald instead of Ronald.

When her Mother enters her room and tells her that someone named Donald is looking for her, Cindy  tells her Mother that she does not know anyone named Donald, even though she knows it's Ronald, and soon comes out to ask her Mother what Ronald had to say after she hung up with him.

Here we  can see that Cindy truly cares for Ronald and is dealing with her own frustration in wanting to completely forgive him and become involved in a romantic relationship with him, yet still feels hurt that he treated her so badly once he had become popular.

In his frustration to win her back, on the following morning, Ronald takes his lawnmower over to Cindy's and starts performing dangerous  stunts on her front lawn, which not only awakens Cindy,  but has her running out of the house to his rescue, feeling that he has finally snapped under the mental duress he has suffered since the night she ""demolished"" him at the New Years Eve party.

As she berates him for waking up their neighborhood, stating that her Mother was about to call the police until she told her  that Ronald was ""suffering from a chemical imbalance and seeking psychiatric help,"" Ronald finally has the chance to tell Cindy how he really feels about her.

How all he ever wanted was to get close to her and to become part of her world, yet when he finally was able to do so, he had lost his own identity in the process.

Ronald then implores Cindy to join him in soul searching so that they can truly discover who they really are and if they belong together.

 Now,  Cindy finally knows that Ronald really does love her, and is no longer fearful about telling him how she feels.

The movie gets a bit confusing here, because they agree to meet later on that day to discuss their relationship.

However,  we never know if that actually takes place or not.

Instead, the next scene occurs at school where Ronald's best friend, Kenneth, is helping one of Cindy's best friends, Patsy, with a math problem, in which Patsy shows real affection towards Kenneth.

So now we see another romance in the making between one of the popular girls at this school and one of the nerdy guys  who is obviously very taken with her.

Of course, this is met with derision by a jock named Quint (well played by actor Cort McCown), who decides to bully Kenneth for what he states is  Kenneth's  intent to ""pull another Ronald Miller on them.""

Moreover,  when Cindy turns to two of her other male friends who are both jocks, and asks them to stop Quint's attack on Kenneth, they sheepishly look on, yet do nothing, even though they know that Quint is wrong.

Ronald  soon shows up with a baseball bat in hand threatening to  break Quint's arm if he fails to let Kenneth go.

 There is a tense moment before Quint does so.  However, the scene is important given Ronald's speech about how foolish the segregation is between those who are popular and those who are unpopular in school, when it is tough enough for teenagers to just be themselves.

It is a strong message, given how difficult it is to be a teenager, with all of the obstacles that they must overcome before becoming adults.

We see Cindy looking emotional during this speech as her eyes follow Ronald as he leaves the cafeteria, and his speech is eventually met with applause from all of the teenagers sitting within the outdoor cafeteria; especially as Quint apologizes to Kenneth.

In the final scene we see Ronald on the now famous Snapper lawnmower, just finishing cutting the Mancini's front lawn, when Cindy comes out to pay him.

A number of Can't Buy Me Love fans have wondered if in addition to the money which Ronald was supposed to receive for mowing the lawn, Cindy may have also given him back the $1000 he'd  paid her as part of their initial agreement, when she says ""this should cover it.""

In this writer's opinion, this is exactly what Cindy does in order to show Ronald that her feelings for him have changed, and that she now cares deeply for him.

They converse for a few moments with Ronald describing how he had been looking at the moon the evening before, and Cindy saying how she had done the same (in reference to their last official date which was filmed at an airplane graveyard in Tuscon, Arizona).

It's obvious at this point that Cindy wants to tell Ronald how she really feels about him, yet, her clique suddenly shows up in order to pick her up for an outing, and as she tells him that she has to go, it appears that all Cindy and Ronald will ever be are friends.

This is where this movie really leaves its viewers hanging for a minute or so, because that is exactly what we think is going to happen here, as Cindy and her entourage drive off, leaving Ronald by himself.

However, as he enters the road on the way back to his home, lamenting his loss of Cindy, we hear the screech of tires as the car Cindy is in stops, and she calls him by the name Donald, hearkening back to the day that they decided to first enter into their rental contract.

Instead of telling Ronald that she forgives him for everything that has happened between them and that she truly does love him, Cindy instead decides to show him
this, as she hops onto the tractor seat behind him and cuddles up next to him
saying:  ""Now let's get this deal straight""  - the same words she spoke to Ronald  on their first day of school, when their rental contract actually began, and Cindy was outlining her responsibilities within this contract.

Many of this movies' fans have described this as their favorite scene in Can't By Me Love, as Cindy and Ronalds' fates are finally sealed, and they fall in love and ride off into the sunset in each other's arms, in the finale of what has become perhaps the finest romantic comedy ever made.

This ending may sound clich, but it sure does work on an emotional level, as the audience celebrates the joy that both Cindy and Ronald experience in overcoming the obstacles throughout this movie that had once served to keep  them apart, while they both emerge as better people for their suffering.

Can't Buy Me Love  is a movie that you will want to watch over and over again,  because there  is a purity and sweetness to the way in which these characters are played by the ever gifted Amanda Peterson and her costar, Patrick Dempsey, that has attracted millions of loyal fans to this movie over the past 27 years, and made perpetual teen icons of both Amanda and Patrick.

There is also a beauty to Can't Buy Me Love that unfolds as we watch these two soulmates navigate the complexities of their teenage years before ultimately finding each other.

And they leave an indelible impression on us as they do, when they discover what true love is really all about.

316115,4,6301008960,"This is a bit of a guilty pleasure movie for me.  Having been a nerd in high school, although nerds in my school weren't considered quite so on the fringes, I could relate to Ronald's wish to be popular.  If you don't already know this movie, Ronald (an adorably young Patrick Dempsey) pays the most popular girl in school $1,000 to pretend to go out with him for a month.  She's skeptical, but true to his prediction, the ""in"" crowd immediately decides he must be OK and they take him into their fold.  But when the secret gets out, he becomes more of a social pariah than ever.

The only things in this movie I don't like are 1) some fart humor that just isn't that funny, and 2) the inevitable slow clap started by one person that spreads through the crowd.  What a tired cliche, although I admit that the speech that inspired the slow clap was good.

What I really like about this movie:  1) the funny scene with the African anteater ritual dance; 2) Patrick Dempsey's appeal; 3) the chemistry between him and Amanda Peterson (who plays Cindy); 3) a VERY young Seth Green as the obnoxious younger brother; and 4) the overall message (even though it's a little heavy-handed).

Can't Buy Me Love (1987) ** / 4
D: Steve Rash
C: Patrick Dempsey, Amanda Peterson, Courtney Gains, Tina Caspary, Seth Green
P: High school nerd (Dempsey) pays the most popular girl in school $1000 to pretend to be his girlfriend for a month, expecting that her popularity will rub off on him.

In Can't Buy Me Love, Patrick Dempsey's character of Ronald Miller suffers an identity crisis-- trade off his individuality to be popular or stay true to himself, but be a loner in the process? Can't Buy Me Love suffers from an identity crisis very similar to Dempsey's. Does the film stay true to its original premise and do something more meaningful & more considered or does it sell out to be more marketable? Unfortunately, the film goes with the latter.

Watching Can't Buy Me Love, I could see there was a good film just beneath the surface. Amanda Peterson's character and the object of Dempsey's affections, stars as the most popular girl in school. She hates it. Popularity is more like a job to her. Her friends are superficial. Everyone treats her like an object. No one can really see the real her. These are interesting ideas that could have made for a very intriguing film. Peterson seems game as she has a solid grasp on her character and what makes her tick, but these story elements are only scratched upon and not fully explored. [PG-13] 94 mins.",1389830400,,1468,4.7042801556420235
316300,5,6301008960,"This is a great 80s romantic comedy especially for teens.  I remember watching it as a teen myself.  There are two scenes you might consider censoring for tweens involving some heavy petting.  There are a lot of innuendos, but a lot of that would go over a tween's head.  There is also some drinking at high school aged parties.  Always can be a teaching moment if you are a parent.  The message is really great though, and it is funny to see Patrick Dempsey (aka Dr. McDreamy from Grey's Anatomy) when he was so young.",1389744000,,519,4.410526315789474

If you have high hopes about this, settle down.  This movie is a sweet, feel-good movie meant to be watched on rainy days to remind us of the carefree and simple innocence of love.

I applaud the actors, and the storyline.  It has a unique (for the time it was made) take on young love.

This movie is something I would love to watch with my teenage niece, or catch up on a girls movie night with my friends.  Anyone can appreciate the music, cars, high school struggle that almost anyone can identify with one way or another.

As the saying goes, the grass isn't always greener on the other side.  On the other side, being popular can feel like a job.  Cyndi warns Ronald not to get carried away by status, but Ronald doesnt heed the warning and betrays his best friend in the process.  We also see how shallow Cyndis friends are as well.

Whats not explained is why Cyndi stays and continues to stay.  Theres even one scene where she rages against them, yet despite nothing changing afterwards, all is happy again.

I want to go back to the old days where the nerds wore glasses with tape on them and pants up to their necks, held up by suspenders. And well, I want to go to any place where they have a collection of women that look like the young ladies in this whopper of a film.  That's not to say this movie is all about hot women.

The heart-warming moments where you really feel all mushy inside. The light-hearted moments that make you fall out of your chair.

316792,3,6301008960,"As I plan to head back into the 80's with occassional reviews that I plan on doing, I came across this 1987 film that I was never overly familiar with, but I remember seeing way back when. It was never in the group of ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", or ""Sixteen Candles"", ""The Breakfast Club"", or ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" for me, and after having now seen it for the first time since the 80's, still isn't, but that's okay. It doesn't have to be. It's a fine little film all on it's own. So, what's the plot?....

Patrick Dempsey(who is pretty much known as ""McDreamy"" nowadays)plays Ronald Miller, a 17 year high school kid who mows people's lawns over the summer. Ronald is not one of the cool kids. Hangs with the ""loser"" crowd, has glasses, unruly hair, etc. For years, he has had a crush on the most popular girl in school(of course he did)named Cindy Mancini(Amanda Peterson, and who wouldn't when your as adorable as Amanda?). When Cindy finds herself in a jam, Ronald swoops in to the rescue....but at a price. He wants Cindy to hang with him for a month and act like they are an item, in hopes of making himself more popular at school and getting to belong with the cool, popular kids. The plan goes into motion and works, but maybe it works a little too well, and Ronald will soon have to come to realize what's more important - being somebody your not to belong, or being liked and accepted for who you are.

Plot-wise, ""Can't Buy Me Love"" is not exactly original, but what makes it work is that it is performed sweetly, naturally, and honestly. You see what happens to Ronald and how it touches everyone around him, for better or worse. One of the best aspects is his relationship with his best friend, played by Courtney Gains, and the lows that come with it once Ronald becomes popular. Their confrontation in the video arcade is affective. Most of the cast are 80's types, but it's two main stars, Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Peterson, bring sweet life to the characters that helps make it's plot less obvious. Okay, it's obvious, but they make it likeable and watchable. Dempsey does a great job as geeky Ronald, popular Ronald, and back to geeky Ronald. We like him and feel sorry for him in the start, and then are shocked and disgusted with him and the way he acts and treats others when he becomes one of the ""cool kids"", and then it's back to liking him again and wanting him to have what he wants when the old geekster comes back to the forefront. Amanda Peterson is the popular girl, but she plays it with a sweetness that never makes Cindy Mancini a nasty caricature of these types of characters - Popluar captain of the cheerleading team with her own little clique. Life isn't exactly a bouquet of roses for her either. The two of them, and their characters, really make the film. Elsewhere, you will find a young Seth Green(""Buffy"", ""Austin Powers"") as Ronald's little brother, Chuckie. He's a hoot in the role. Ronald's father is played by Dennis Dugan, who went on to become a successful comedy director, having filmed a lot of of Adam Sandler's films.

What's not to like about the movie?. Not much. ""Can't Buy Me Love"" won't win any awards for originality, and that's probably the only big thing going against it. For most of the movie, it never delved into cheesiness, until the end. Ronald's final speech outside in the cafeteria bringing the ""cool"" and the ""not so cool"" kids together gets washed away with a little too much cheese with big, sweeping music played as it goes along, but this can be overlooked when you have such a charming little movie played very well by it's two main stars. I love the 80's. Some see the dated fashions and everything else as a detriment to these films, but that couldn't be further from the truth. It enhances the movie and helps make it what it is. It only adds to the charm.

At the end of the day, ""Can't Buy Me Love"" is a pleasant, harmless, little comedy, that has grown over the years into a real teen/high school classic for a lot of people. No, Ronald, you can't buy love, but you can achieve it by staying true to who you are.",1242000000,2,4105,4.469333333333333

316796,4,6301008960,"""Can't Buy Me Love"" is a charming 80s classic that never gets old. I've always had alot of affection for this film, and was pleased to locate a copy on Amazon. This was from Patrick Dempsey's pre-Grey's Anatomy, feature film stardom period. He turned out several funny, heartwarming, & charming films during this time. I personally wish he would stick to films and bid adieu to Grey's Anatomy & Dr. Derek Shepard. While I am a big fan of both GA and Dempsey, I really have no love for ""McDreamy"" as a character/sex symbol--WAY overrated in my POV!!!",1224547200,,549,4.612244897959184
316797,5,6301008960,"One of the biggest dorks in school, Ronald Miller's (Dempsey) life is consumed by telescopes, astronomy, and his similarly socially awkward friends.  After countless yards mowed, sacrificing even the remotest possibility of popularity, he's finally accumulated enough money to buy the telescope of his dreams.

Meanwhile, Cindy Mancini (the gorgeous Amanda Peterson) is the hottest, coolest girl in school, the captain of the cheerleading squad, and pretty much the envy of everyone.  Men want her, and women want to be her.  At a ""back to school"" party she wears her mother's suede outfit.  Insert the dumb, clumsy jock with wine glass, and the outfit is ruined.  Later, when both Ron and Cindy end up at the mall - Cindy to replace the outfit and Ron to buy his telescope - the opportunity presents itself and Ron buy's his popularity.

Predictably, some shades and a little hair mousse transport Ronald into the popularity stratosphere.  As one of Cindy's gorgeous but promiscuous friends says, ""He went from totally geek, to totally chic.""  Once part of the clique, he becomes arrogant, dips his pen in the cheerleader ink, and distances himself from his real friends, going so far as throwing feces on his best friend's house.  Tired of Ron's big head, Cindy breaks the bombshell at a crowded party, and drops Ronald from big man on campus to social leper.  Ron learns the valuable lessons that he should never sell out his friends or principles, and that notoriety isn't always the best thing in the world.

I love this movie.  It's classic 80s, and wildly entertaining.  The only problem I have is that this should have propelled Amanda Peterson into superstardom, yet she was barely heard from afterwards.  There is no justice in a world that shuns Peterson and allows fugly shrews like Sarah Jessica Parker stardom.",1218153600,,1824,4.953947368421052

316851,4,6301008960,"This was filmed in the 80's but other than some of the fashions you'd never really know it and that are where I think reviewers here miss the mark. This is not a ""typical 80's teen comedy"" in the way that phrase is generally understood.  There are no references to pop culture (movies or music) in this film at all.  Many of the songs used in the film are either not from the 80's or, with the exception of the Billy Idol song used, obscure pop tunes.  The soundtrack to this movie is barely noticeable.

There are no decade defining actors or actresses in this film either.  No Anthony Michael Hall no Molly Ringwald et al.  Other than Patrick Dempsey in ""Loverboy"" I don't remember any of the people in this film in anything else during the 80's.  This movie should never be lumped into the ""Sixteen Candles/Breakfast Club/Pretty in Pink"" trilogy of sorts.  It's a much different type of movie the most obvious reason being John Hughes did not direct or produce this film.

I originally saw this movie in 1988 on VHS while I was a freshman in HS.  The plot of this movie could easily be set in 1967, 1977, 1997 or 2007.  I may be mistaken but I don't think cliques in High School were an 80's phenomenon that disappeared after 1989.  As far as I know there are still jocks, nerds, and being ""cool"" in HS is still and always will be defined by who you hang out with.

This movie used the still annoying habit of trying to cast 23 year olds as high school students.  Most of it is obvious but amazingly enough Amanda Peterson, the prettiest girl in school, was really 16 at the time.  Perhaps that is what makes the movie more enjoyable.  If you are looking to watch a teenaged HS comedy that most of us can relate to on one level or another you might like this.  If you want to watch a ""decade defining 80's movie"" you should look elsewhere.",1174694400,3,1842,4.3391812865497075

If you love the 80s then you should see this movie. It is better than several other options. However, it is not the best option. I think ""Say Anything"" is my favorite. I am partial to John Cusack.

The acting, story, and overall feel of the movie is fine. One of the other reviewers mentioned that some actors went on to huge careers and it shows in some scenes. However, some show their inexperience.

So if you love the 80s you should see this film; if not rent ""Say Anything"" because every one should see this movie once.",1174608000,,719,4.350746268656716

Years before ""McDreamy,"" Patrick Dempsey plays Ronald, who like most guys in town, has a thing for Cindy Mancini, the captain of the cheerleaders the prettiest girl in Tucson. The nerdy Ronald is constantly picked on and is tired of being considered a nerd. Wanting his senior year to be more than ""cards with the tards"" as his brother Chucky calls it (played wonderfully by Seth Green when he was just a kid), Ronald finds himself in a position to help Cindy out of a predicament. She needs money to replace a suede outfit she borrowed from her mother and ruined, and he needs to be popular. Cindy doesn't think Ronald's plan will work, but she has little choice. She agrees to pretend to be his girlfriend for one month, but not even Ronald expects his plan to go over with such initial success. But soon, things unravel as they tend to do, and Ronald and Cindy both learn a lot from their mistakes. It's a great 80's movie with a wonderful message about being yourself entwined in it. If you grew up in the 80's and you missed Can't Buy Me Love, for shame! Go get it now. It rocks!",1155686400,,1208,4.279475982532751

I read a review here stating to the effect that the movie had no moral compass (I'm paraphrasing), did we see the same movie? It's basically a tale of how to not go about trying to be ""popular"". How we can lose sight of what is really important.

316899,1,6301008960,"1987. One of the worst years for movies. There were a string of losers that came out what seemed like all at once. There was the remake of ""Wanted: Dead Or Alive"", ""Stakeout"", ""Adventures In Babysitting"", and then this one. These were all losers because they had a shallow plot, a lack of talented actors/actresses, and no moral fiber to them whatsoever. With ""Wanted"" every 2 seconds there was swearing, ""Stakeout"" was just plain stupid, ""Adventures In Babysitting"" showed me that the young were starting to yell back at authority, and this one what people will do to be noticed and accepted in the popular group. I just feel that the world has come to this, and it wants to go even further until there are absolutely no moral absolutes. I witnessed this in my late teens early 20's, and now as I'm pushing 40, and have a child of my own I look back on this, and want to grab him, and run to hide. I know my outlook on life has been altered a bit....maybe a little anyway, but I have to still deal with what my son learns out in the world, and if it's not of strong moral fiber then it must be rid of; this goes for me too. It's still terrible after almost 20 years.",1145664000,6,1167,4.285067873303167
316900,5,6301008960,"""Can't Buy Me Love"" (1987) was probably made to cash in on the rush of 80s romantic comedies but it succeeds where others fail, mainly because ""Love"" has a real message to send out - - be very careful what you wish for; you just may get it and it may not be what you thought you wanted.

Patrick Dempsey, pre-Grey's Anatomy, is Ronnie Miller, a nerdy, smart kid who hates being in the unpopular group, who can't sit in the home section at football games and can't sit anywhere near the ""cool"" kids in the school cafeteria.  He's been saving up for many summers (cutting grass) to buy a really awesome telescope.  He goes to the mall to get it and instead runs into Cindy Mancini (Amanda Petersen), the girl of his dreams, who is pretty, popular and the head cheerleader.  Although they go to school together and Ronnie cuts her grass, Cindy doesn't even know his name.  Cindy is in a predicament - - she has worn her mom's off-limits suede outfit to an end of summer party and got wine spilled on it.  A replacement is a thousand dollars - - which Ronnie happens to have handy.  He forsakes his telescope, instead ""paying"" Cindy a thousand dollars to pretend to be his girlfriend for the first month of school. As imagined, the alleged match is met with skepticism and horror by the ""in crowd"" and just plain skepticism by Ronnie's old friends, who he will soon abandon for life in the fast lane of the popular kids.  Cindy makes Ronnie over, to make him look more hip and cool, and she soon begins to see more in Ronnie than originally met her eye.  But their one month contract is up, and Ronnie has come to believe his own popularity.  Will Ronnie fall from grace with the popular kids?  Will he realize that Cindy has fallen for him?  Will they get together?

Pretty basic stuff, but ""Love"" is such a fun movie because it will really remind you of high school.  The popular kids look down on the ""nerdy"" kids, picking on them when bored.  The popular girls that never gave Ronnie a look when he was sitting with the nerds are now falling over each other to date him, once he is ""seeing"" Cindy.  Cindy proves to be a pleasant surprise - - she is pretty, blonde and a cheerleader, but she has depth.  She is a secret writer, something she shares only with Ronnie - - and she complains to him that she doesn't ""do"" anything but hang out and shop, and she wants to do more, but people don't expect anything else from her.  Touching stuff.

Amanda Petersen is wonderful as Cindy - - you can feel her admiration and affection for Ronnie building, and feel as crushed as she does over Ronnie's transformation into the media monster who believes his own hype.  What ever happened to this appealing actress anyhow?

The message the film sends across is perhaps a little schmaltzy towards the end (only filmmakers in Hollywood think that popular kids in school are going to applaud what a perceived nerdy kid says in the cafeteria) but incredibly satisfying.  While feeling that Ronnie deserves the come-uppance that he gets, you also feel sympathy that he was exposed in such a public manner and that he is blacklisted not only by the popular group but also by his former friends.  Patrick Dempsey brings a tenderness and yearning to Ronnie that makes him so appealing, even when he's being full of himself.

Does Ronnie get his girl at the end?  Well, it is a romantic comedy and an 80s movie, so that answer should be fairly clear, but it's a fun journey to get there!

316936,5,6301008960,"While this was far from the greatest movie ever made, I give this 5 stars because it speaks to a part of us that wants so badly to be accepted and another revelation that people are nothing but followers if you know the right buttons to push.

Ronald, a dork, has been mooning over the most popular girl in school whose lawn he's been mowing for years.  He also wishes to be invited to all the A list parties, be liked by others than his fellow nerds, and just be liked.  When the most popular girl in school, Cindy, is in a moment of peril, he offers her a large wad of cash to buy himself popularity.  The two pose as a couple at their school, with her at his side he is able to walk down the Popular Kids' hallway, eat at their lunch tables, and become included in their social activities.  Eventually, according to plan, he and Cindy split and his popular status is secured.  Ron, however, gets a swelled head as he feels he has accomplished something when others haven't, and leaves all his former nerd friends in the dust.  When Cindy, in a moment of tipsy anger, reveals that the whole thing was a plot and that he bribed her affection, he gets a sudden cold shoulder from his true friends that he spurned and the cool kids who he thought were true.  Now Ron is really alone.

People are followers, no doubt about that.  Ron finds out that the people whose admiration and friendship he sought so hard for are actually shallow, arrogant and insecure.  He himself became shallow and arrogant, and forgot who his real friends were.  The sweetly awkward nerds were more genuine friends than he ever hoped for.  Even the sluttiest girl in the school (who gave more rides than Greyhound) was ashamed she's done the deed with him!  As this was still a fantasy type movie, things work out in the end that Cindy discovers she really does care for him because he's not shallow like her other friends he just wanted to be liked.  Even his nerd friends accept him back, and everyone in school learns a valuable lesson about acceptance.  This is also, as so many of us learn over time, another part of our growing pains.  Many of us can and will achieve a certain status in life where we feel that we are better than others and we let it get away from us until we encounter someone even smaller than we are who takes facts or even some trivial piece of information and rips you to shreds with it.  It hurts, to be sure, but it's part of the maturing process.  And remember, life after high school does not change all that much.  All you can do is cope a bit better.  And you know what?  As an adult, you can be way cooler than you were in high school, the rest of them stay there.

And RIP to Amanda Peterson who played Cindy.  Ironically it seems that while she played so clean cut and fresh in this movie, she was hiding a much darker side of herself and died in 2015 at age 44 of a drug overdose.  Just like all the other child stars, she didn't make it.",1127692800,10,2951,4.283393501805054

317028,4,6301008960,"Viewed as a genre of its own, the 80's Teen Comedy produced some fun, enjoyable movies. One that holds up quite well is Can't Buy Me Love. Starring Patrick Dempsey in what was probably his best role of the era, it's the story of a geeky kid who pays the captain of the cheerleading team to pretend to be his girlfriend for a month. While not entirely realistic, it has a good ending. The humor holds up well after 16 years, as does the movie overall.
The DVD was hugely disappointing, and my 4 stars are based on the movie itself. Unless you consider chapter stops a special feature, the disc is devoid of any extras.

This movie is fable-lite, in that multiple morals are presented throughout the movie, but are somewhat camouflaged. Perhaps the biggest moral is that you should not be what you are not. Smaller, but no less important, morals might include knowing who your true friends are, friends stand by you when all others leave, love can not be purchased, and on and on.
With all the morals presented in this teen fable, you might wonder whether I was joking about this being a light movie; not at all. The fable is presented in such a laid-back fashion that you may not realize that this movie is a fable.
Patrick Dempsey is a classic nerd. He hangs out with his friends, equally nerdy, and plays cards (I am a nerd, I can say these things because I DID these things). Their idea of excitement is a new video game. Patrick loves astronomy. His friends generally believe academics in school are the most important thing they can do. Patrick has been mowing lawns nearly forever to buy a $1000 telescope.
On the day that Patrick goes to buy the telescope, he sees beautiful Amanda Peterson trying to buy a suede jacket that has red wine spilled on it, to keep her mother from finding she borrowed it after her mother specifically told her not to borrow it. In a moment of insanity, Patrick Dempsey offers to give Amanda Peterson $1000 to buy the jacket if she will ""go out"" with him for 30 days. Even though Amanda thinks Patrick is crazy to think that everyone will think he is cool if he goes out with her for 30 days, buying a replacement suede jacket is more important than being seen with Patrick for 30 days, so she takes the deal.
Of course, you realize that all this has to end up badly, but between the time that Amanda accepts the deal and the end of the movie, the viewer gets to see how shallow the difference is between geekdom and stardom, and how shallow the people are that determine which is which.
This movie has a few outright laughs, and a lot of smiles and chuckles. However, it is a feel-good movie. The story is compelling and unless you are not paying attention, the story will suck you in. You stay because you want to know the outcome, and the story line is sufficiently interesting to hold your interest to the very end. In the event you haven't seen this movie, the ending is poignant, and worth the wait.
This movie was one of the endless teen movies released in the 1980s. However, it has the distinction of being one of the funnier movies of the bunch. If you like light comedy, I strongly recommend this movie, even for young teens.

Pat Dempsey gives a stellar performance as Ronald McDonald Miller, the RoboNerd who fakes his way into the fast lane, and Amanda Peterson proves she is more than just serious eye candy with a sensitive and intelligent portrayal of the head cheerleader and Ron's dream girl. Yet in spite of a brilliant performance in a very very hip teen movie, Amanda didn't seem to do any films worth a dang after this classic. What an outrageous waste of talent.

317095,4,6301008960,"One of the better non-John Hughes teen comedies of the 80s, ""Can't Buy Me Love"" is not your typical boy meets girl flick. Ronny Miller (Patrick Dempsey) is a nerdish grass-cutter going into his senior year in high school. He has a yearning to join the 'popular clique,' and hook-up with its head beauty, Cindy Mancini (Amanda Peterson), a seemingly shallow cheerleader who lives next door to Ronny without hardly a glance in his direction. When Cindy ruins her mother's suede outfit at a party, she is desperate to replace the very expensive clothing. Enter Ronny, who offers to bail her out monetarily, on one condition - date him for a month at school. Ronny believes this will get him in with the popular crowd, and put him together with Cindy. She grudgingly agrees, and for a month, it seems to work. Ronny works his way up the social ladder, and Cindy opens up to him, revealing a not-so-shallow person underneath that beauty. She even starts to fall for our hero. Unfortunately, the quest for popularity has overshadowed his quest for the girl's heart, and he sacrifices her affections and his old 'nerd herd' friends for his new-found hipness. The picture proceeds to chronicle Ronny's rise (and fall) as the King of Hip, and Cindy's journey into maturity.

This is a fun film, though the message (Be yourself) does come off a bit heavy-handed. Most of the characters are one-noted. Dempsey puts in a great performance in one of his earlier roles as Ronny, who puts everything on the line for his shot at popularity. Peterson puts in a wonderful, natural turn as Cindy, who rises out of the shallow end of the popular pool to become a better person. A young Seth Green (Oz, 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer) turns in a spirited role as Ronny's brother Chuckie, and Courtney Gains is great as Ronny's put-upon and nearly-forgotten best friend Kenny. A highlight of the the film involves Ronny's dancing attempt at a high school mixer (He was watching National Geographic, not American Bandstand, while learning his moves). Paula Abdul choreographed the 'dance.'

All in all, a wonderful film about finding yourself, and not judging or being friends with people based on what 'clique' they belong to.

The DVD provides only Fullscreen, with Dolby Surround, but the film doesn't suffer from this form one bit. So Enjoy!",1029369600,2,2317,4.831234256926952

Let me put it this way, it's a teen story version of ""Indecent Proposal"". Of course the two movies are very different and ""Can't Buy Me Love"" is extremely innocent movie compared to ""Indecent Proposal"" but still there is a thin line that matches between them... the use of money to buy love!
Amanda Peterson was incredibly sexy in that movie... she was HOT!

I think a deeper message to this story is no matter how life changes and the world around you changes don't get caught up in all.  Stay who you are and true to yourself and everything will work out in the end.  On another note Im very happy that Buena Vista Home Entertainment is finally going to put this movie out on DVD this summer.  So to all of you Can't Buy Me Love fans out there lets hope they include some special features.  I myself would love to hear a commentary from Patrick Dempsey and Amanda Peterson and some deleated scenes.

317101,5,6301008960,"Through the years, I've loved this film for many, many reasons (actors & characters, storyline, happy ending...) I think it's one of the best 80's comedies. All actors are really wonderful.
By the way, what happened to Amanda Peterson?",1011484800,4,235,5.051282051282051
317102,5,6301008960,"In ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" Patrick Dempsey plays Ron, a high school nerd who Machiavellianly seizes a chance to become ""popular."" He happens to bump into Cindy Mancini, the captain of the girls' cheerleading squad, at a moment when she is desperate for a quick thousand dollars -- an amount of money which he has on him, because he was on his way to buy himself an awesome new telescope. He arranges with her to pretend that they are a couple, in public, in return for which he will bail her out of her predicament. They shake hands on the deal, and things start getting weird immediately.
This is really a pretty nice movie. Ron shows the magic of being a nerd -- he takes Cindy on a date to an old airplane graveyard, where he regales her with stories about the histories of the old planes. He knows the geography of the lunar surface as though it were the back of his hand, which is kind of a cool thing to be clued into. Basically, he really is a pretty interesting guy. HOWEVER... the more popular he becomes, (due to Cindy's charm rubbing off on him), the more of a scumbag he gets to be. He doesn't even seem to realize that Cindy actually falls in love with him for his real self, he's so caught up with trying to be someone he's not. If he had remained the Astro-nerd he really was, right from the beginning, he would have had a lot more self respect. In that case, of course, there would have been no movie, so maybe we're all lucky that he chose to temporarily alter his customary modus vivendi.
This movie has real heart. A lot of 80s movies were pretty fluffy, but this one actually makes you think. It sticks to your ribs, that's all I can tell you. This next part of my review might sound a little tangential, but if you see the movie you'll see that it's actually extremely relevant...  ""Can't Buy Me Love"" makes you really think about a lot of things that happen in high school.  That's why it's so powerful.  I found myself preoccupied at some points with how little energy people in the high school portrayed expend thinking about science, or ideas, or foreign lands, or history, which at least in theory should be the whole point of school.  Or, to put in another way -- Ron's smart, nerdy friends actually DO think about such things, but generally outside of the academic environment.  The social pressures of the experience of being in school are so overwhelming for Ron, at times, that sometimes he can barely even THINK, let alone LEARN.  Without his cerebral, escapist daydreams of the moon's geography (lunography?), it seems that his mind and spirit would have been crushed altogether.  Ahhhh, institutionalized education.  You've gotta love it -- NOT!  Makes you think, I guess.
But back to the movie. ""Can't Buy Me Love"" has two overriding themes. First, ""to thine own self be true."" I, for one, was WELL into my twenties before the first time I let myself BE myself enough to go ahead and buy a telescope, rather than spending the money trying to impress someone. The younger you are when you start being yourself, the better off you'll be. Second, don't be such a heinous, evil fiend to the other people you are trapped in school with for four years. Even nerds have a lot to say, a lot to offer, etc. This is a really good movie, almost a fable in some ways. I recommend the living daylights out of it. Also -- if you like this movie, you might also enjoy ""Lucas,"" or ""Dazed and Confused."" Two thumbs up.",1000944000,13,3433,4.453821656050955

317153,5,6301008960,"Amusing story of a nerdy high school student Ronald Miller (Patrick  Dempsey) who discovers that becoming popular isn't the greatest thing in  the world. After she accidentally ruins her mother's suede dress with some  wine, Cyndi, the most popular girl at school (played wonderfully by Amanda  Petersen) will do anything to replace it before her mother gets back from  her trip.
Enter Ronald. After seeing her desperate attempt to replace the  dress at the mall, Ronald makes a deal with Amanda. He'll use the money  that he has earned all summer by mowing lawns to buy a new dress, in return  for Amanda's help in turning him to Mr. popularity.
Along the way, Ronnie  learns lessons about the true value of having real friends, and towards the  end of the movie Ronald discovers that he is still himself.
This film,  which is no longer produced by Touchstone Video (a division of the Disney  Corporation) features many couple of stars before they hit it big. Gerardo,  the Latin-singing star who scored a one-hit wonder with ""Rico  Suave,"" plays one of the football jocks in the film. However, the real  scene-stealer in this film is Seth Green (""Austin Powers"";  ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" ""Can't Hardly Wait"") who  plays Ronald's annoying, yet hysterical little brother, Chuckie. By taking  a look at Seth in this past role you can understand why he is such a big  star today. He is always a trip when it comes to comedic performances.
I  loved this film for many reasons, but I think the most memorable scene in  this film probably has to be Ronald learning an African dance he saw on  television (he thought he was watching ""American Bandstand"").  After learning it, Ronald performs it at the big dance, not knowing that it  would become a huge hit.

7809925,4,6301008960,"RELEASED IN 1987 and directed by Steve Rash, Cant Buy Me Love is a high school dramedy about a geek at an Arizona high school (Patrick Dempsey) who pays the most popular girl in school (Amanda Peterson) $1000 to act like she likes him for a month so he can move up the social strata. Of course, this creates unforeseen problems. Courtney Gains plays his geek friend and Seth Green his little brother.

This is better than some 80s teen flicks (e.g. Molly Ringwalds movies), but not as good as others (Fast Times at Ridgemont High). Its arguably on par with Just One of the Guys and Some Kind of Wonderful. Unlike those films, however, it has a semi-campy vibe wherein the cast members often exaggerate their lines in an artificial way, which telegraphs that whats happening isn't real.

If you can roll with this odd element, theres a lot of good in Cant Buy Me Love and the ending is genuinely moving. There are many serious/realistic scenes, like the notable airplane graveyard sequence. The two protagonists have good chemistry and their relationship arc is convincing. Tina Caspary (Barbara) and Darcy DeMoss (Patty) are serviceable on the fringe female front.
