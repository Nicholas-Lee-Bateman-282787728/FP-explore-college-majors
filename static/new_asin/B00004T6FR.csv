I must admit that I do not like the P.M. video as much, Carole McPhee's routine is good but she does not give you as complete an understanding as David-Dorian Ross does on the other video.  He spoiled me!
Overall both videos are exceptional and quite worth your investment.  If you decide to get this set, enjoy it as I do!
(I actually came online to buy my next step, energy Chi for Beginners and had to write this review!)",1032912000,5,653,4.380165289256198
7922298,5,B00004T6FR,"I bought these videos separately. They do not have to be used together,  and using only one does not in any way diminish the effectiveness. These  videos have been a key component in my stress reduction program. They work  better for me than Yoga because you are actively moving with control  throughout the routines, which I find keeps my mind from being able to  dwell on whatever is stressing me. By the end of each tape, I feel relaxed,  centered, and balanced (which is quite an accomplishment!). Both  instructors have pleasing voices and demeanors. It does help if you have at  least a little previous experience with either Tai Chi or Chi Kung, but it  is not strictly necessary. Another advantage is that you can perform these  routines in a limited amount of space. Excellent production values and  soothing music in a tranquil setting.",965260800,22,846,4.805555555555555
