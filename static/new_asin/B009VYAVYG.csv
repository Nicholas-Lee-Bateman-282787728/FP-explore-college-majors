5369737,5,B009VYAVYG,"This is a correction on 2/25/13 to my original Nov. 20, 2012 review of the '97 release.
My apologies to you and my mistake was believing and cutting and pasting the THEN listed '97 contents from the BBC America site. I actually cut and pasted the episode listing from the then BBC America site for the '97 release when I posted that review, it turns out they later changed the contents and instead included ""Extra Extra"" as the special in the '97 release rather than the ""Here Comes The Groom"" special which the website then listed as part of it's contents. So NOW it looks like, according to the BBC America website episode list of contents, ""Here Comes The Groom"" will be on the new '98 series DVD set rather than the '97 set. I wish they could get it straight on what the contents are. My apologies for quoting the source, who I thought knew best.  Now here is my original review, keep in mind, ""Extra Extra"" is now the special on the '97 release, not ""Here Comes The Groom"":

Oh my, a mixed reaction to this set.  First it's one of the best of the series because Foggy is still the third man, but then it's sad that this is the last season Foggy played the 3rd Man role.  In fact the last episode of this series was a ""special"" from Dec. '97 where the new third man is introduced, Truly of The Yard.  The episodes included in this 1997 installment were all originally on from April to June of '97 and then came one of tne never broadcast in the U.S. ""specials"" in Dec. '97 ""Bride of The Groom"", this is where Truly enters while Foggy is doubled in one  scene by someone else as supposedly Foggy ""sleeping it off"".  Very uncharacteristic for the real Foggy, I might add.

But let us rejoice in the 10 Foggy filled regular episodes here along with the never before seen in the U.S. Special included here ""Bride of The Groom"".  OK folks, I'd recommend this set just for the wonderful Foggy episodes alone.
Once again Mr. Perfect invites you to partake in one of the best shows ever on TV.

Now for the ""devil in the details"" listing of this installment's episodes, quoted from the source with my corrected placement of episodes:

1. The Love Mobile - The trio comes across a mobile ""lonely hearts agency. this time it seem it's the owners of the agency who need a bit of marital advice. Smiler tries to get rid of a tandem Auntie Wainright sold him. He ends up being the perfect client for the lonely hearts agency.

2. A Clean Sweep - The trio meet an unlucky sweep, and help him drum up some business.

3. The Mysterious C. W. Northrop - Ivy's getting some love letters from a mysterious man that calls himself C. W Northrop. the trio wants to know who this person really is, and end up having a little surprise

4. A Double for Howard - When Pearl's ""security"" at home becomes too much for Howard to handle and Pearl starts suspecting his furtive encounters with Marina, the trio tries to find a double for Howard, so Pearl can see them together, and think she was mistaken all these years, regarding Howard's secret love

5. How to Create A Monster - The trio tries to make Smiler become more aggressive, so he can stand up to Auntie Wainright, but they end up getting a little more than they asked for

6. Deviations with Davenport - the trio gets lost in the woods with Mr Davenport, a man in serarch of wisdom

7. According to the Prophet Bickerdyke - Foggy, Compo, and Clegg meet the (sole) follower of Yorkshire's own doomsday prophet. It's one thing to predict the closure of your local railroad--but is the world really likely to end on a Wednesday?

8. Next Kiss Please - Compo bets Foggy he can get Nora batty to kiss him before sun set. will he manage to win the bet?

9. Destiny and Six Bananas - When a primate is said to be loose in the local woods Foggy organises a search party, accompained of course with the right uniform and military discipline

10. A Sidecar Named Desire - Remembering Nora used to enjoy a ride on a motorbike and sidecar when her husband was alive, Compo hires a motorbike from Auntie Wainright, and envites Nora for a ride. Wesley tries to fix Barry's car (again), with disastrous results.

11. (Special Episode) There Goes the Groom - Compo and Clegg are getting ready to attend the stag night of Edie Pegden's Niece's husband to be, but when Compo's ferret, Stella, gets lose, they need to turn their attentions to making sure Compo's front door is on securely! Arriving late, Compo and Clegg find that the majority of the crowd have already had quite a lot to drink and one of the few still standing is Herbert Truelove, former policeman recently returned from his time in London back to his roots in Yorkshire. Clegg receives a phone call from Foggy who has been taken away to Blackpool by the post lady and is now, engaged quite by accident, to be married.",1353369600,34,4804,4.424036281179139

5369805,5,B009VYAVYG,"I love, love, love the Last of the Summer Wine programs.

Being a little hard of hearing, especially when it comes to some of the Yorkshire accents, I especially appreciate the subtitles options. I have never been able to decipher the ""closed captions"" feature of my TV or VCR player. With the subtitles option on the discs, I can click ""on"" and then I'm able to understand every word.

I have every Last of the Summer Wine DVD that has been released. I am so excited each time I read about another one on the way.  They are sometimes released first on BBC America's site, but I wait to get the free shipping and much better price here at Amazon.

My only complaint is that all thirty seasons' episodes are not released as one huge collection. I know the Dark Shadows drama was released as a complete series of more than 1,000 episodes. I believe LOTSW has just over 300 episodes.",1363132800,2,880,4.447204968944099

5369809,5,B009VYAVYG,"Another great series to add to my collection. I have never watched a Last of the Summer Wine program that I didn't like. Well, at least while Bill Owen (Compo) was still around. No problem with video and audio quality.",1361491200,,218,4.475

Some of us your primary audience are geting up in years and the release system neeeds to be accelerated to accomodate the audience that has supported them all these years.

  The special, XTRA! XTRA!, was number one on disc one of the two discs included in the set.
  The special titled, "" Bride of the groom"" IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS SERIES.

A double for Howard makes me laugh all the way through.
Howard is looking for someone his height to trick Pearl. Even
gets under the car with Westley to check his height but
tells him he is to tall. Compo, Foggy, and Clegg tell a salesman

I  especially like Extra  Extra, The Mysterious C. W. Northrop and A Double For Howard. So many surprises are in those episodes along with Eli's cameo appearances.  They are all hilarious.  The second discuss is equally as funny.  How to Create a Monster  (Smiley gets rambunctious),  and  Destiny and the Six Bananas will keep you in  stitches.  Foggy  hunts for two  giant apes.",1454889600,,528,4.565217391304348
