8703736,4,B00U0SSEVO,The US title Evil Eye is completely misleading because this is basically a great murder mystery film Bava incorporates great cinematography to keep things visually interesting utilizing creative camera angles and clever visual techniques. The story drags a bit near the end but it's a good movie if you like crime suspense flicks.,1491523200,,330,5.245283018867925

8703739,5,B00U0SSEVO,"Very good early 60's Italian-made thriller directed by Mario Bava.  A young woman comes to Rome to visit an elderly relative.  During the night the old lady dies and girl runs out to get help.  On the Spanish Steps she witnesses a murder, faints, and next morning is found by the cops and believed to have been on a bender.  The only person who believes her story is the young doctor who had been attending her relative.  Now begins a cat-and-mouse situation with the killer.  The part where the girl booby-traps a house she house-sits is hilarious.  She nearly brings the house down.  The Kino Lorber DVD is excellent quality.  It has the English-dubbed version titled The Evil Eye and the Italian-language version titled The Girl Who Knew Too Much.  Highly recommended.",1452902400,5,771,4.7727272727272725
8703740,4,B00U0SSEVO,"Bava pays explicit homage to Hitchcock in this fun, mostly light hearted black and white mystery.

An American girl vacationing in Rome witnesses what might be a murder (or is it her overactive imagination, spurred on by her love of cheap mystery novels?).  And before you know it, shes the possible target of a serial killer.  The black and white photography is beautiful, and Bava tones his style down just a bit, and it works, so the photography compliments the story, without swamping it,.

There are weak spots, like a very annoying voice over that insists on explaining what the images make very clear by themselves, and performances that are uneven (especially in supporting roles).  But, the bottom line is,  if it wasn't in Italian, one could believe this was a lesser Hitchcock film, which is a pretty high compliment..",1449187200,2,829,4.885714285714286
8703741,5,B00U0SSEVO,"This was as delicious as it was the first time I saw it when it was brand new. Beautiful people, beautiful location, and campy. When I was a child I didn't realize that it was campy. The scenes on the famous Spanish Stairway stuck in my head for decades and it was just a thrill to see this through adult eyes. I could not remember the name of the movie so I googled Spanish Stairway and that's how I found the DVD.  I'm sure I will get together with my sister again and watch this. The title sounds like a horror movie, but it is innocent and amusing and frightening. I don't know a lot about film production, but this was pleasing to the eye, especially the scene at dawn when our heroine lies unconscious at the foot of the stairs.  It had the same feel as Los Angeles at dawn, another favorite memory of mine.",1436832000,5,813,4.205128205128205

8703743,5,B00U0SSEVO,"* I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

When discussions about iconic directors of the horror genre arise, several big names should always come up:  Lucio Fulci, George A. Romero, John Carpenter, Dario Argento, and many othersand of course, Mario Bava.  If you are unfamiliar with Bava or his works, you still owe him a great deal of thanks; he is considered by many (and I would wager most) horror aficionados to be the godfather of the slasher film.  He pioneered the Italian giallo films, which were basically murder-mysteries that often contained horror elements as well as a nice dose of eroticism.  These giallo films were the precursors to modern-day slashers.  EVIL EYE is one of his earliest giallos, and although it is in black-and-white, it is still a powerful and influential film.

I have to confess I didn't realize EVIL EYE was a giallo until I got the press info for this Blu-ray release.  Because its one of the first, its rather tame when compared to later giallos.  But that doesnt mean its not good.  Horror fans and thriller watchers both should enjoy this non-colored gem.

EVIL EYE is shot well and looks great onscreen, especially when you consider its time period.  Bava's films have a unique cinematic style, in that they use light and shadow exceptionally well, even better than many modern day films.  This aspect is clearly evident in the film, and it heightens both the tension and the terror.

The acting is great, with Leticia Roman playing the lead of Nora, and John Saxon portraying her love interest, Dr. Bassi.  Both do a fantastic job, however Valentina Cortese steals the show as Laura Craven-Torrani.  Her performance is both charming and terrifying, the perfect character study for a film like this.

The Blu-ray transfer of EVIL EYE looks great, however there are a couple of transitions that cause the picture to wobble every now and then.  This is not overly distracting, but it is noticeable.  The picture clarity is excellent, however, and theres practically no graininess anywhere.  Likewise, the sound is top notch as well.

EVIL EYE is a big win for me, and I recommend it to anyone not experienced with Bavas work.  This is a great film to start your journey with, and its a title every horror fan owes it to themselves to own.  The Blu-ray offers two versions:  the U.S. release, which was titled EVIL EYE, and the European version, which was released as THE GIRL WHO KNEW TOO MUCH.  Regardless of which one you watch, you're sure to appreciate the impact this film had on our much beloved modern horror genre.  This Blu-ray hits store shelves next week, so make a note.",1431648000,7,2654,4.7527352297593
8703744,4,B00U0SSEVO,"There is a huge following for director Mario Bava. The director was one of the major players in the Italian film industry when it was first beginning to be noticed in the 50s and 60s. What many note him for though was his status in the world of horror films, creating some of the most amazing images in the genre that can still make your skin crawl to this day. If you don't believe me try watching his anthology film BLACK SABBATH. Scenes from that still scare me.

But Bava was also a director who made more than horror films. He also directed drams, sword and sandal move and has been called the father of the giallo film. The giallo film is an Italian genre that deals with thriller that generally involve some sort of crime fiction or mystery. Perhaps the most well-known director of this genre is Dario Argento, but Bava is considered the one who began it all. And while it is disputed as to which movie he made that began it all, many credit this film EVIL EYE (or as it was known in Europe THE GIRL WHO KNEW TOO MUCH) as the first.

The film opens with a young woman named Nora Davis (Leticia Roman) flying to Italy to stay with her aunt. She arrives safe and sound and finds her aunt being tended to by Dr. Marcello Bassi (John Saxon). On her first night there she wakes to find that her aunt has died during the night and runs to find help. On the street she is mugged and knocked unconscious. In a stuporous state she wakes to witness a young woman struggle to the nearby steps only to fall with a knife plunged into her back. As Nora watches, she sees a man come up behind the girl, remove the knife and retreat as Nora passes out.

The next morning a stranger whose face we never see approaches Nora to help only to run off when the police arrive. Taken to the hospital the doctors there think she is an alcoholic due to the brandy the mysterious stranger poured down her throat and it is only the appearance of Marcello that saves her. Reporting the crime to the police they find no body or evidence of foul play having taken place.

As Nora buries her aunt with Marcello by her side, she meets Lora (Valentina Cortese) at the cemetery. Feeling pity for the young girl, Lora tells her she was friends with her aunt. Rather than have the girl stay in the huge house where her aunt just passed away, she invites Nora to stay at her home nearby. She explains this will help her as well since she is about to leave town and it means someone will be there to watch over the house.

As Nora begins to look deeper into the whole problem of the murdered woman she saw, she finds out that there was a rash of deaths attributed to a serial killer that ended ten years prior. Called the Alphabet murders, they ended with the third victim whose last name began with a C. Putting together the pieces of the puzzle Nora now fears for her own life as her last name begins with a D. With Marcellos help the couple try and find out who the serial killer was with little or no help from the police. But as they get closer to discovering who it might have been will it also mean that Nora will die at the hands of the dormant killer who seems to have returned?

As with any movie that is made overseas it seems that there is something lost in translation. But in this film its not near as noticeable as with many others. Made in 1963 this was Bavas last film to be shot in black and white and he makes the most of it. His use of shadows and light here create so much mystery on their own. Not only that he uses them to expand some locations and to shrink others, an interesting method Ive not seen put to use before.

While some of the mystery involved here might seem quaint by todays standards the movie does offer clues slowly and surely rather than pouring them all out at once in the end. Coupled with the growing love story between Nora and Marcello it makes the film hold your interest from start to finish. The performances by the two main leads also flows naturally which is a credit to their acting abilities.

As with any film made longer than 40 years ago I highly recommend that the viewer take the time to place themselves into the theater experience of that time. Forget that weve had Michael Myers and Jason Vorhees to haunt our nightmares since the release of this film. Instead just sit back and enjoy the movie as it unfolds, take the time to discover the mystery and the clues that are presented and just have a good time.

This new blu-ray release of the film from Kino Classics offers two versions of the film. The first is as the US release EVIL EYE. This version runs 92 minutes long and offers a soundtrack composed by Les Baxter. The other version is the European version known as THE GIRL WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, featuring a soundtrack by Roberto Nicolosi, and runs 85 minutes. The quality of the blu-ray is excellent and lends itself to the sharp contrasts in the black and white photography that I mentioned earlier.

If you're wondering what the classic horror or mystery giallo films is all about then this is a good place to begin. It entertains and holds your interest from start to finish and keeps you guessing throughout. Once you watch this one you may find yourself seeking out more films by Mario Bava. I would suggest the aforementioned BLACK SABBATH as well as BLACK SUNDAY. Or you might want to check out the films of Dario Argento. In any event start with this one and you may discover that you enjoy it enough to seek the others out.",1431043200,9,5467,4.319688109161794
