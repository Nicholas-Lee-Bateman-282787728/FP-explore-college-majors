3842830,2,B002436WF8,My 15 month old loves Elmo. This DVD however had too much talking and conversation and he was quickly bored. He didn't seem too fond of Elmo's daddy either. His appearance should have been as friendly as Elmo only bigger and with glasses maybe. Those eyebrows and unfriendly voice kept my son very far from the TV set! lol,1253059200,12,322,4.47457627118644
3842831,5,B002436WF8,"This video is great for kids.  My child already knows who Andrea Bocelli is, so it was an extra treat to not only get Elmo, but Andrea as well.  It has an interactive storybook too that reads the book and follows along on the screen.  All in all, a great buy.",1251676800,,259,4.03921568627451
3842832,4,B002436WF8,"We bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter who just got a big girl bed and was having trouble falling asleep.  She could not express why, so we thought this video might help her articulate her feelings.  It made everything worse.  Now she is afraid of monsters in her room and everywhere else in the house.

I think if your child is already afraid of things in the dark it is GREAT, but if your child has no ideas about monsters, or total darkness fears you should not purchase it.",1251158400,33,484,4.228260869565218
3842833,5,B002436WF8,I purchased this for my grandson who is 13 months old.  He loves it and will sit still and watch the whole thing.  Highly recommend as it has great content and variety to keep kids interested.,1250640000,,192,4.305555555555555
3842834,5,B002436WF8,"This is the perfect video to snuggle up with at bedtime. Our son is only 15 months old but he just loves the songs and soothing tone of this dvd. My husband and I also find it to be a relaxing part of our evening! It's so good that I don't even want to go to sleep without it!

It cleverly shows the muppets all over town getting ready for bed while singing the most delightful songs. Bert and Ernie are classic and have never lost an ounce of charm, Baby Bear and his cousin are funny and adorable, The yip yip yip alien from when I was kid makes an appearance with Telly, and the ""Happy Thoughts"" song that Elmo and Abby sing is sweet, catchy and will become a favorite to sing with your little one. ""Time to Say Goodnight"" with Andrea Bocelli is the icing on the cake. My baby claps at the end every time.

What a great gift for a child. Don't hesitate buying this one.",1249430400,,872,4.093567251461988

3842841,5,B002436WF8,"This is another fun, educational program from Sesame Street. My two-year-old daughter loves it. We have watched it many times and it never gets old for her. It shows betime routines, strategies for falling asleep, how to get over fear of the dark. My favorite part is that Elmo's dad clearly has the same feelings as anyone who has tried to get a young child to sleep.",1451692800,,368,4.507462686567164

CHARMING!  Our ""Delightful Delilah"" was all eyes and ears as she watched it.",1428192000,,256,4.906976744186046
3842844,5,B002436WF8,I have owned this before but my kids lost it. Bought this again for my youngest since she now loves Elmo. It is a great movie for little ones. I love the songs and scenarios. I like that the dad tries to help comfort baby David with his bedtime worries.,1424390400,,253,4.08

3842850,4,B002436WF8,"It's a cute little show about getting Elmo and his friends to go to sleep. My daughter did seem to get a little bored with it after about twenty minutes, but it's not annoying so it's okay to leave on in the background while she plays.",1407196800,,235,4.130434782608695

3842854,2,B002436WF8,"I borrowed this from the library and just saw it on the shelf and thought, oh, nice!  My 2 yr 8 month old might get in a better routine as a result of this.  While there are a few cute lullabies and other snippets that are nice (Ernie and Bert singing ""Imagination Song"" we have the book), so much of it focused on Elmo's insomnia, Abby's fear of the dark, the 2 coming together after lights out to discuss their respective insomnia.  #nothelpful!  Elmo's Potty Time showed a successful Elmo engaging around a range of potty issues, but there was a successful model.  this was far from that.",1395360000,,591,4.435185185185185
3842855,4,B002436WF8,my daughter loves this video. She has to watch it every night before bath and bedtime. The songs and stories are very relaxing.,1394668800,,127,4.565217391304348
3842856,4,B002436WF8,"I'm really not a fan of Elmo, I grew up watching Big Bird and Jim Henson as Ernie. But alas, Elmo is like crack to my daughter. This really is a great night time DVD. I enjoy Sesame Street's Sleepy Time Songs and Stories better because Big Bird is the host and it's got the original Ernie (no Elmo) but Bedtime with Elmo is a great updated version. It goes through scenarios in which different characters have trouble falling asleep and playfully helps each overcome those issues. It also show how various children in other cultures prepare for bed. And yes, plenty of songs too. There's a really cute bedtime story that Elmo's dad reads that very unfortunately isn't a real book because my daughter absolutely adores it. Btw, she's almost 2 and has enjoyed this DVD for a few months now.",1389312000,2,788,4.556338028169014
3842857,1,B002436WF8,We were not able to watch the video so there is nothing to review.  Need help with getting the video to preview.  Purchased it but cannot view it,1385510400,,145,4.142857142857143
3842858,4,B002436WF8,"I got this dvd for my 2 year old son to watch prior to his bedtime. He loves the songs and characters. I love how Elmo's daddy Louie interacts with Elmo and his friend Abby Cadabby: from explaining why he reads books to Elmo at bedtime, to teaching Abby not to be afraid of the dark(by looking at everything in the room when the light is on to see that nothing in the room is scary). The only thing that I disliked was towards the end of the dvd, where Elmo lies and tells his father that his stuffed toy ""Baby David"" is having trouble sleeping, when Elmo is really the one having trouble sleeping. Even though Elmo's actions are somewhat typical of a 2-3 year old child who doesn't want to go to sleep, I felt that Louie should have addressed the lie and taught Elmo that HE was the one having trouble sleeping instead of his toy. Overall, I would recommend this dvd to any parent whose child loves Elmo and is looking for a quality dvd for their child for bedtime.",1370476800,,966,4.255434782608695

3842860,5,B002436WF8,Our 12 month old loves best of Elmo 1 & 2 and he loved this one too. He usually loses interest if there is A Mr noodle part but this movie doesnt have that. It's perfect,1348185600,,169,3.7222222222222223
3842861,4,B002436WF8,"MY GRANDSON GOES TO SLEEP TO THIS EACH NIGHT, HE'S 8 MONTHS. I WISH IT WAS LONGER MORE SINGING LESS TALKING BUT OVERALL ITS GREAT FOR ALL AGES. I WOULD BUY AND RECOMMEND THIS VIDEO",1346457600,,180,4.171428571428572
3842862,4,B002436WF8,"After watching this video, and a few roll plays, my daughter stopped the rough battles to avoid going to bed at night. No more crying no way struggles, Elmo did it this way, Elmo said so and so... She followed right away.",1346198400,,221,4.285714285714286
3842863,5,B002436WF8,I had rented this movie from the library and my daughter loved it. So I ordered it used from here. Great quality plays well. So another great buy to add to our collection of must have movies.,1323648000,,191,4.1891891891891895
3842864,5,B002436WF8,"This DVD has been indispensible for us.  Our daughter is now a year and a half old and has been going to bed to this DVD for about 6 months.  As with anything related to children, what works for one may not work or may not be appropriate for another.  However, this has been great for our family.  Some folks have complained that some of the music is too upbeat and that their kids don't relax to it.  For us the key has been to watch the entire DVD.  Our daughter finds the upbeat songs that are earlier in the DVD engaging and helps get her settled in to watching the entire disc.  Then when the pace slows down later on, it mellows her out.  For us, the big advantage was being able to say, ""See, Elmo's going to bed now.  Now it's time for you to be like Elmo and go to bed too.""",1321488000,2,783,4.0

3842867,5,B002436WF8,"My little guy loves this! Some reviewers complain that it's too upbeat for bedtime, but it slows way down after the first few songs. Besides, TV isn't a substitute for a quiet bedtime routine; watch the video, turn off the TV, and then start your routine. Also, what doesn't work for a child at one age might be great a few months later, so if your child doesn't respond well, put it away for a few months and then try it again. My only complaint is that it doesn't cover toothbrushing.",1300147200,2,486,4.351648351648351
3842868,5,B002436WF8,"This movie is cute, entertaining and made my little one very interested in potty training.
We bought this for her when she was about 18 months to introduce her to the idea of the potty - no pushing, but to introduce the idea.  We assumed it would take ages before she used the potty on her own -- nope.  Within a month, she decided she'd potty just like Elmo and has basically potty trained herself, thanks to Elmo!",1298073600,,415,4.3076923076923075
3842869,5,B002436WF8,"My son loved this video. It covers everything from being afraid of the dark, to not being tired, to needing to say goodnight to everything in the room, it introduces Elmo's Daddy which is really sweet. Would highly recommend this video.",1291334400,,236,4.780487804878049
3842870,1,B002436WF8,"I wish I had read these reviews before buying this DVD at a local store.  I had to turn it off because of the focus on scary things at night.  My child is not fearful, just misses her crib. Hopefully she will not be fearful after watching this. I was looking for a nice fun relaxing time with Elmo to help cast a positive light on bed time and the big bed.  This was NOT it.  I will stick with bedtime stories and ditch this DVD.",1290470400,2,429,3.953488372093023
3842871,1,B002436WF8,"Until watching this video my son thought monsters were all good and friendly, like Elmo and Grover.  That was until Ernie starts talking about being afraid of monsters and the dark.  For days now all our son keeps saying is that he is afraid of monsters and the dark.  WHY would Sesame Street introduce the concept of being afraid of monsters and dark??????  This make me very angry and has now affected our son.  We love Sesame Street, and have every elmo DVD available, but this one should be changed.  It is just not healthy for kids with the introduction of fear!  Only buy this video if you want your child afraid of monsters and the dark.  Awful!!!",1278633600,12,654,4.483050847457627
3842872,5,B002436WF8,"Like many other 2 year olds, my daughter is in love with Elmo.  She especially loves this video.  It's perfectly targeted to toddlers. We watch it almost every night as part of her bedtime routine with milk and a cookie.  It has cute and catchy songs, really clever use of characters and language, and best of all - it has a calming effect on her, so she goes to bed without any drama.  I can't decide which section of the dvd I like the best - the outer space world section is very amusing, the baby bear and cousin bear section is adorable - and helps kids understand there's nothing to fear about shadows in their room at night. Elmo's Dad figures prominently in this dvd - great for fostering good family bonds. The short cartoons about children in Haiti and India are especially nice, too, as they show bedtime routines for children in other parts of the world, and are told in a child's voice.  We have watched this dvd for almost a year now and I still find it to be very clever and interesting how it effectively appeals to children's best qualities at an early developmental stage...
