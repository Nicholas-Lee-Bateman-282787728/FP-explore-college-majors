1409915,3,B000059ZW9,"I guess after the blush of success by such like-minded comedies like Groove Tube, Kentucky Fried Movie and other skit-based films (and we're also in the first couple years of SNL by this time, 1977) Neal Israel produced this to cash in on a new youth culture.

Featuring members of Ace Trucking Company, Firesign Theatre and Credibility Gap all improv-type comedy troups to perhaps duplicate the growing success of Second City and Cheech and Chong at the time this film, the plot is ostensibly related to California falling into the sea after a large earthquake. The film collects a series of skits that have little to do with California or earthquakes. I guess they thought everyone who would see this would be high.

I saw this at a sneak preview in 1977 double-billed with of all things the new King Kong.  I was attracted by the promise of another Groove Tube and seeing some of the Firesign Theatre on screen.  It was horribly uneven and went on much longer.  Now at barely 80 minutes, I seem to remember a lot of dead weight that has been trimmed, including some of the wraparound with Fee Waybill as a scientist which seriously slowed things down.  Also, things have been moved around from what I remember from 30 years ago. The great bit in the mattress store was near the middle and had people rolling in the aisles during the preview, clearly the best bit. It is now almost at the end, better placing for their strongest skit.

Although this is no great movie, it is a great snapshot of the comedy troups working at the time.  The bit in the mattress store and the concert promoters who are booking the Who, Guess Who, etc are both based (the 2nd one literally) on Abbott & Costello-style word-play misunderstanding. Pretty dated comedy.  Wildly uneven and sporadically funny it at least has enough nudity and politically incorrect humor (before such things bothered us) to give it an R rating. For that, it's kind of amazing and certainly nothing like they would make now.",1400716800,,1983,4.675287356321839
1409916,1,B000059ZW9,"Quit after five minutes.  I normally get a kick out of this genre of throw-it-in-Hollywood's- face movie.  Maybe I wasn't in sync with my ""campy"" personality trait.  Sorry.",1388880000,,172,5.071428571428571
1409917,4,B000059ZW9,"I was fortunate enough to have worked as a theater projectionist when this movie came out.  You know, all the fresh-popped popcorn and soda I could consume for free and the opportunity to see this film about 14 times in the two weeks that it ran.  This is one of those movies much like ""Airplane"" that you need to see a few times to catch all the gags.  True, the budget for the movie was pretty low, but that was idea.  Basically, a lot of comedians and comedy troupes got together and performed skits that were loosely woven around a central theme, that Los Angeles had suffered a 9.7 earthquake.  If you like shows like Monty Python, Saturday Night Live, and Mad TV, you may enjoy a lot of these wacky skits.  One of my favorites is one with Fred Willard as the boss in a bed store who gets into a conversation with a potential customer about mattresses, but somehow the poor customer misunderstands the subject and thinks Willard is speaking of something much more personal!  At this price, you could always record over the movie if you didn't like it.  Somehow, I think you'll want to save it.

One thing that puzzled me and ticked me off a little was that they changed the original theme song on this tape.  I don't know if there was an issue with rights or something, but the original theme was very different.

[UPDATE]

This movie was only about $6 when I wrote this.  I guess my review has increased its value!  Not sure why but it says $20 at the main Amazon screen, but only $7.99 here.",1074816000,4,1498,4.380434782608695

7934456,3,B000059ZW9,"Watch it when you are either drunk or stoned. It will be more enjoyable that way. Requires a very short attention span, as the gags come fast and loose. If you don't like a certain skit, sit tight. The next (loosely connected) one will be along in a few minutes. The producer used every segue trick in the book to make this movie hold together, and there is a certain art to be appreciated in that.",1452297600,,398,4.25
