5554154,4,B00B2Y7AL0,"I love Leslie Sansone.  Her workouts have truly been life changing for me.  That said, there are workouts of hers that are definitely better than others.

This new workout is very lively and includes new steps. I'm not a fan of the mambo step, which is used quite a bit, nor do I feel comfortable doing lunges during an aerobic workout.  (I am 57 with some health issues.)  So I found myself doing alternate moves for some of this DVD.  I don't mind doing that - I often substitute moves when I feel a move will be a bit difficult for me.
However, I have to be honest:  I spent a great deal of this DVD substituting moves.

I loved the pace and I always love using the band.  But I am not coordinated enough to do some of the moves and I have to be careful about how I move my back, so again, I used the band but substituted moves, using moves from her earlier DVDs instead.

Again, allow me to reiterate: I LOVE LESLIE.  But I have to say this:  I can't hear the music. Maybe I'm going deaf; not sure.  But I know I can't hear the background music.  I'm not a fan of Leslie's music anyway, but I can't even hear this well enough to complain about it.  :)  The production team really goofed on this one.

I do believe I'll keep this DVD, because the pace is fabulous.  But it's definitely not my favorite.  However, it may well be yours if you like to mambo and can do a bit more with the band than I can.  I do not recommend this for beginners.

Leslie is a wonderful woman and I always look forward to her new DVDs.
This one is fun and lively and a bit different.  It's just not exactly right for me.",1347580800,4,1602,4.083601286173633
5554155,5,B00B2Y7AL0,This is a fast paced 3-mile walk....that is a new walk! I like this walk better than some of her other DVD. The use of the bands(which comes w/the DVD) in only in the 2nd & 3rd mile. As always these are great for a beginner or someone who wants more of a challange. Its all up to the viewer how hard you want to push yourself.  I prefered not having the timer ongoing on each mile....there is just a quick 10sec count down when you end each mile(s). For me this is great when I cant get outside or I when I'm sick of the treadmill.,1347580800,3,531,3.9626168224299065
5554156,4,B00B2Y7AL0,I really enjoy most of Leslie's workouts.  The one thing I will say about this one though is the music is a little too low so it is hard to keep with the beat.,1347494400,3,159,3.676470588235294
5554157,5,B00B2Y7AL0,"I couldn't wait to try out the three mile workout as soon as it arrived in the mail today. There are lots of new moves and Leslie, as always, is a great instructor and makes the time go by quickly.",1347062400,3,197,3.95
5554158,4,B00B2Y7AL0,"Leslie's newest DVD is a nice strong 3 mile walk.  The workout incorporates some new moves and Leslie incorporates the resistance band (included with the DVD) during miles 2 and 3 to provide strength training.  There are enough new moves to make the miles go by quickly and Leslie incorporates more arm movements with the walking to keep your heart rate up.  The resistance band work is also done while still walking so that you don't cool down too much while doing the strength training.  I liked the pace of this workout --Miles 1 and 3 are 14 minutes each, while Mile 2 comes in at 12 minutes.  A short cool down and stretch finishes off the workout.  Leslie does miles 1 and 2 with a group and is alone for the last mile.  The music isn't too exciting but the set is nice and light.  Overall, a nice addition to add some variety to my walking workout library!",1346803200,14,863,4.383647798742138
5554159,4,B00B2Y7AL0,"I had a hard time rating this DVD because I have very mixed feelings about it. My experience with Leslie's videos goes back more than 20 years, off and on.  For the past 2 months I have been doing one of her DVDs every day; usually 2 to 4 miles with either her stretchie band or walkaway belt.  I was looking to add a little variety when I bought this one.

Here are my reactions to this video:

-  If you're used to Leslie's usually easy-to-follow steps, be prepared to learn some new moves. Some were quick to pick up, and some were not. Many were simple variations on her standard leg and arm moves.  As always, Leslie went through the usual walk, knee lift, side step, and kick instructions at the start of the routine. But she did nothing to prepare us for the mambo and other more complex new steps. She also did no announcements like she usually does during the workout to give us a chance to learn a new combo. It was just ""Okay, now we're going to mambo.""  That's fine if you know how to mambo, but not so much if you don't.

  Leslie always makes a big deal about how her exercises are NOT about learning dance steps, and she even says this at the start of this one. So I was surprised when she threw in dance steps with no preparation for us. If you're like me (klutzy), you may be stressing over following some of these new steps. For some of them that I couldn't follow I just did side steps or knee lifts until they were over.

-  The music is lack luster for the most part, assuming you can even hear it. It did nothing to energize me.

- The stretchie band included is thicker and more resistant than her other ones.

- Leslie does her normal talking throughout the workout. This doesn't bother me unless she loses track of the steps and has you doing 20 reps on one side, and 50 on the other. But I didn't notice any of that here.

- This video moves fast. Which is good. Because it's so intense, I didn't think I could do all 3 miles, but I did.

- Whether or not you can follow all the steps, as long as you just keep moving with the beat, you will get a very intense full-body workout. Even though I exercise with Leslie every day, this DVD had me sweating profusely, more than usual, and I could definitely feel the burn from using the new thicker band. My arm muscles are still feeling it after working out last night.  I recommend getting this DVD for the band alone.

- She does some band movements for the triceps (back of the arm), which are seldom targeted in her other workouts. Since this is a problem area for many women, this is a great addition.

- My bottom line recommendation is that you should get this DVD if you're ready for a more intense workout and want more variety in the moves. This workout will deliver both. If you're a workout newbie, and just starting to get back into shape, you might want to wait on this one, unless you just get it for the awesome stretch band.",1346803200,100,2912,4.2144144144144144
5554160,5,B00B2Y7AL0,"she keeps you motivated, her talking makes the workout go by fast which is Great:) always been a fan:) the only thing I wish she would change up the basics.but she's a great instructor . Her dvds great for begginers also",1346284800,,220,4.390243902439025

5554182,5,B00B2Y7AL0,Love love LOVE Leslie Sansone's workouts. This one is amazing. Three miles with a warm up in the beginning and cool down at the end. She uses the bands in this one too which i like. I love the things she says during the workout. They keep me inspired and motivated to keep going. I've tried several other home workouts throughout my life and Leslie is hands down my favorite instructor. Her videos are easy to follow and yet super effective. I've been working out solid for a month with her and I already see changes and have lost inches all over!,1508976000,3,547,4.372549019607843
5554183,5,B00B2Y7AL0,Great .... See my other Leslie Sansone review.,1506816000,,46,4.875
5554184,5,B00B2Y7AL0,"I get a great cardio and fitness workout using this video. The bands are 3 different strengths, so I only use one of them, but they were a nice addition. This is done in Leslie Sansone style so she talks and promotes walking throughout. She incorporates what she calls the mamba and her explanations for you to learn some of the moves are a little sudden, but it doesn't matter if you do it right every time and after a few times, you will have it down. I am surprised as I come to the end of each mile segment, but you will work up a sweat if you complete all three segments to make 3 miles. Includes a casual interview with ""Father Scott"" at the end who became a walking leader to share his exercise success with members from his congregation. Interesting!",1504483200,,758,4.3076923076923075

5554187,5,B00B2Y7AL0,"Absolutely loved this one of Leslie's work outs. I was surprised how sweaty I was when through! Okay, so the first mile is your standard Leslie mile with walker filled with  her usual inane chatter. Mile two is Leslie and two walkers performing a mixture of aerobics and the stretch band. What I loved about this mile was that she mixed up moves that really helped pass the time quickly. Mile three is Leslie alone, just you, her and the fitness band. I found her very likeable on her own, not quite so UP, UP, UP. I own a lot of her DVD's and this is one of my top five.",1496361600,2,571,4.1441441441441444

5554189,2,B00B2Y7AL0,I can't review this since dvd would not play in dvd player.  I had to return the first copy I ordered due to disc appearance issues and it would not play even after I  cleaned it.  Second disc looked really bad and would not play so attempting to clean wouldn't help.  LOVE LESLIE and her workout and only bought this for variety but can't recommend unless you stream it and have a backup stretchy band purple or green as you use it in workout... as you see in pictures it looks pretty bad and not sure what would do that.  Dvd was brand new in packaging... Can't recommend buying it...,1493683200,,586,4.290909090909091
5554190,3,B00B2Y7AL0,"I love the Leslie sansone videos however, she talks so much it's hard to hear the music without turning it up really loud.

Leslie's giggles took a little getting used to, but her enthusiasm and encouragement help keep me going. The 3 miles did not show as three miles on my FITBIT, but I did work up a sweat and feel more tired than when I walk 3 miles outdoors.  I like that strength training with the band was also included.",1491609600,,446,4.235294117647059

5554216,5,B00B2Y7AL0,"Nice workout video to do when you aren't able to get outside or just want a change in your work out routine.  At first I thought it would just be easy walking, but at mile 2 the workout added the resistance band which proved more challenging than I thought it would!  I'm adding this workout to my regular routine and I'm looking forward to getting her other work out videos.",1485561600,,375,4.3428571428571425

That being said, I do not like the music on any of these videos or listening to her jibber jabber the whole time.  My fix for this is to mute the video and listen to a playlist that I've put together of music that I like and has the pace I want.  I basically use the videos to help me change up the moves.",1482883200,,452,3.880434782608696

5554228,5,B00B2Y7AL0,I always use and benefit from Leslie Sansone videos - my children like to mock the way she talks and her enthusiasm but she has helped me lose weight and improve endurance and I don't feel lost or confused by hard to follow routines.  I find her encouraging and inspiring.  I recommend all her videos as even the most sedentary and out of shape person can get started with at a least a one mile walk and work up from there.  Her videos are my go to solution when I've been sedentary and I need to get going again.,1476057600,,513,4.161616161616162

5554269,1,B00B2Y7AL0,"I miss the old Leslie...the funny, spontaneous, fun Leslie. I did about 10 minutes of this workout, and I was so bored I thought I could fall asleep. I immediately went back to one of my favorites: the 4-Mile Super Challenge.

The new variations on the four original moves (side steps, kicks, walking, knee lifts) in this 3 Mega Miles were not fun at all, and in fact felt just flat awkward, such as ""walk forward and kick; walk backwards and kick."" Then the ""heel down, heel down"" movement with the heel touching the front wasn't nearly as effective as one she's done before with a twist, rotating your core muscles and touching the heel down. Then there was this almost pointless pushing back of the hands during the kickbacks. I prefer it when she says with a giggle, ""Throw your hands up to heaven!"" I don't care if you're religious or not, her joy is contagious in the older videos. I feel like the wonder and beauty of Leslie has been marketed right out of her as the years go by. It makes me sad. It's like losing an old friend.",1444089600,5,1035,4.390625
5554270,4,B00B2Y7AL0,"I'm a big fan of Leslie Sansone's.  About 5 years ago I lost 85 lbs and wanted to keep it off so I began doing these Walking workouts.  They've helped me maintain my weight at 105 lbs and I'm now 45 years old, so I'm thrilled.  I own 20+ of her DVD's from the walking workouts to the weight lifting to toning and do one every day.  This one is a pretty good workout out if you work really hard, I'm obviously an advanced walker by now and am in good shape.  She does quite a few variations on her normal moves including walking forward three steps and kicking then walking back three steps and kicking, she adds a kick to her double sidesteps and alternates the double sidesteps and kick with the job forward three steps and kick.  So for someone well acquainted with these workouts, this one shakes it up a bit.  She uses the stretchy band on the 2nd and 3rd miles and gives you a pretty good workout for the upper body, I even started feeling a little muscle fatigue when doing the pulses.  The only complaint I have is when she does a session of combination squats and lunges.  I love squats, I love lunges, I don't like combining the two because you can never get into a full lunge doing it that wasy so I feel it doesn't work as much muscle, so always complain when she does this.  It's particularly bad on this DVD because she doesn't in time with the music so you're doing a half squat and a half lunge because you don't have time to do anything more intense.  That said, that accounts for about 1 minute of this 50 minute workout.  She does do a little ""boosted walking"" in this DVD, which is basically high impact moves but you can keep it low impact if you have a medial issue that prevents you from doing high impact.  The music is alright, nothing great.  It has a good beat to it for a workout but it's not my favorite DVD music-wise.  All in all, I recommend this DVD to those wanting to stay in shape or beginners looking to push it to the next step.  For an advanced walker, it's not going to boose you to any new plateau's.  I'd say it's for intermediate to advanced walkers.",1442275200,5,2092,4.2292191435768265

Leslie has some new moves that are fun and the band work is ""not for sissies.""  The time flies by! You can do one, two, or three miles. The warm up and cool down are separate, so you can design your own work out. Some reviews complained about the music being  too low. It is a little, but I'm glad I didn't let that deter me.

My only complaint is the audio is poor.  I can hear Leslie well but it's more difficult to hear the music.  I really need to hear the beat and struggled to do so with this dvd even with the volume turned almost all the way up on my laptop (digital order).  Overall a good workout.

5554304,5,B00B2Y7AL0,"I've been an enthusiast of Leslie Sansone's Walk At Home program since first discovering it in 2008. Since then, I've made working out with Leslie and her team of walkers a daily routine and a top priority, beginning with the 2-mile walk I originally bought, then later the Walk Away The Pounds Ultimate Collection. For the many years, I mainly worked out to the 4-mile walk on that DVD collection, interspersed with the 3-mile walk with ""stretchie resistance band"" and -  depending on my schedule - the 2-mile version, which still offers an excellent workout in about 30 minutes.

Aside from the effective moves set to perfectly paced music, Leslie's programs distinguish themselves from the competition by virtue of her genuine, upbeat and effervescent personality which shines through on each and every offering. She manages to walk (pardon the pun ;)) the fine line between encouragement and ""tough love"" expertly, while creating programs that can be easily modified to fit every walker's age and health requirements. As a result, after a few years with the Ultimate Collection, I experienced noticeable results without ever getting bored.

However, once the stretchie band finally tore apart from constant use, I decided to break out of the routine and purchase the 3 Mega Miles DVD. And I've been hooked ever since!

As a former ballroom dance instructor, I was thrilled to discover dance sequences like the ""mambo combo"" along with squats, lunges, boxing moves, tap-outs and even a 90-second jogging session forward and back. The stretchie band from the Ultimate Collection is replaced here by a much thicker toning band, which Leslie features prominently in both the second and third mile, utilizing new moves such as the lat pull and the ""push-pull"" (used very effectively while tapping out), in addition to familiar exercises like the chest press.  It felt exhilarating to kick it up a notch by challenging my muscles with this innovative workout set to fast-paced music. Like Leslie's other DVDs, 3 Mega Miles also focuses on balance, coordination, and muscle-strengthening and lengthening, while also providing the all-important warm-up, cool-down and stretching sessions.

How nice it was to see fresh faces on this DVD too -- it's obvious how much affection Leslie and her walkers share for each other! You can't help but be motivated by their inspiring interactions.

Don't worry if you're not a dancer or feel that you're uncoordinated; the beauty of Leslie's programs is that you can always go back to a basic walk or one of the other three foundational moves -- side steps, knee-lifts and kicks -- without ever having to miss a beat. But if you're looking to improve in these areas, I can't recommend a better program. Purchase 3 Mega Miles today and start walking your way to a healthier body!",1412294400,3,2812,5.034408602150537
5554305,4,B00B2Y7AL0,"Good workout! I'm getting my cardio in and toning my arms which is much needed. I took a star off because I don't like the toning band. Not as thick as expected, so I use my own weights.",1410393600,,186,3.9210526315789473

5554314,2,B00B2Y7AL0,"sorry i cant get myself to like this dvd for several reasons:

-can hardly hear the music and music isn't that great.  I like to hear some music when i am walking or doing monotone exercises but i can hardly hear it in this dvd (and i have to say i am blessed with the hearing of a dog....almost).  Music, if you can hear it, itself isn't inspiring either.

-just a boring workout.  i cant seem to put a finger to exactly why i think this way.  I love leslie's overall attitude and here it is no different.  Her walkers didn't seem energetic....granted there is a whole team of walkers in 1st mile, 2nd mile is just two people ( i really liked Carrie and Nikki in her 5 day plan dvd) and last mile was only leslie. The band exercises can be challenging (this is one thick band and a very good quality one).  but again, the workout just  plain  to do boring.

I loved, loved 5 day plan dvd....i play it almost everyday and it is my only leslie dvd until i got this dvd. I felt that dvd had so much energy overall.  however, i DREAD doing this dvd b/c i find it just so lackluster.",1407024000,,1079,4.110047846889952
5554315,5,B00B2Y7AL0,"Finally Hit the Jackpot with Leslie Sansone's walking videos.  The Amazon sales dept knows how many different exercise dvd's I've ordered over the past few months - all in an effort to find the exercise routine that was hard enough, easy enough, interesting enough, not boring enough, etc.  Buying and trying so many videos has not been a fun quest made more complicated given I'm mid-70s, not in terrible shape but not in great shape either.  Nevertheless, I've found that I can do this 3-mile exercise routine although some of my kicks are approximations, my side steps are a tad slower, etc.  It helps to have competitive juices and think ""if they can do it, I can do it.""  And apparently I can:  I've already seen improvements and not teeny tiny ones, either.

My advice to old timers like myself is to throw away your doubts about being able to do these exercises.  Start with Leslie's 1 mile walk and progress.  I was done with the 1 miler in a day, moved to the 2 miler, tossed that one away and now here I am doing 3 miles -- every day!!  Nike is right:  Just Do It!!",1406678400,3,1075,4.406091370558376

There are some spots where it's hard to follow the footwork, but I've only done it once so far. The only part I really had a problem with was mambo-ing side to side. Now, I can mambo front to back no problem, but my feet refused to do it side to side. It kept ending up as a side step. I really liked the newer moves with the band. I thought it funny how she kept losing cast members as the miles went on, lol.",1406678400,,503,3.9411764705882355

Nothing super complicated but I found myself having to concentrate a lot more on getting the steps right. One of the things I liked about her older videos is the ""Get up and go, don't worry about the steps"" attitude.

This one also had a lot more intense movements like jumping and jogging back and forth. As I am pregnant and was looking for more low-impact, I found this to be a bit out of character.

The moves are not complicated, the upper body work was challenging (not overly so), but you really get the steps in (if you're counting).  For me, about 4000 steps in this workout.

Perhaps the ""cover"" is new.  This DVD appears Years old and wasn't even H D.  The Music is nothing to be happy about, rather drab, and too soft.  Leslie's voice is much, much, louder than the music.  You can do the 3 miles as a long walk, or choose each mile.  I like that.  As always, and something that bothers me, is Leslie continually Chit-Chats the whole tape and this one does not have a ""music only"" option (most don't).  All that aside I liked the walk.  I believe it does have More Muscle movement in it, even during a walk when you don't use the band.  Wish it was bright, and new - but it isn't.

I really like her newer, brighter sets in the past few dvd's.  And I like some of her newer walkers (although it would be nice to have more variety in body types and ages like in her older ones).  This workout definitely got me sweating.  The first mile was pretty standard and had several other walkers.  The second mile had just 2 others and it started off like a regular mile but then used a short boost and some stretchy band work.  This mile went really fast as it was 12 minutes, but it got me working for sure.  The last mile is just Leslie, and uses the band for the second half.

I am not sure if it's just my tv, because it's larger, but a lot of her newer movies seem to blur at times in the middle of the workout.  Not sure if others have this problem or not.  Also, you can't hear the music at all.  She talks about ""catching the beat"" and even talks about a particular song during the second mile with the ladies, but I can't actually hear what she is talking about.  I have heard people complain about not hearing the music on some of her dvd's in the past, but I think this one is the worst.  I literally could not tell what any of the songs were.

So, if you want to rate it for the workout itself, it's a good one, but there are some other issues that make it impossible to give this a perfect star rating.",1376524800,2,1454,3.986159169550173

It was also very hard to follow in many places because she started a new step routine with no introduction.  The steps changed after only 4 reps, and not enough (for me) to keep from tripping over my feet.  There seems to be a lack of quality control for this DVD before it was released for sale.

It also combines toning/sculpting while you walk. Anyone of any age can do this! the beat is easy to follow with the music. It was worth the purchase price. It is so much fun it does not even feel like exercising. I look forward to walking with Leslie. I have also lost weight without even trying!

I have about 15 Leslie Sansone videos and alternate between them all with my favorites changing from time to time.  Her style is something I can be consistent with for life - like a diet that becomes a lifestyle choice.

This one, even though it says Mega Miles, is not very tough to do. I went through the first 2 miles and barely broke a sweat. It seems like I had to really concentrate on the moves to follow them. I normally would add arm movements, etc. to add to the intensity, but it's hard to do with this video. I like more knee lifts and leg lifts to get my heart rate up.

5554387,5,B00B2Y7AL0,"I've been exercising with Leslie for about 15 years.  I love that her routines are easy on my cranky knees. As a veteran, I do 3 mile walk videos with 4 lb weights in each hand.  Everyone's looking for something new so I would try new Leslie videos as they came out.  The recent ones disappointed me.  The seemed to be filmed in her own studio which is dark and she is alone.  It's kind of depressing.  This newest video is back to the old form- a bright and cheerful studio and ""friends"" that she chats with during the video.  Some reviewers have said she's trying to play to a younger crowd.  Change is good!  None of us wants to stagnate.  There are some new (very easy) moves and a tiny bit of choreography but they are both very simple.  If you don't like them. you can easily substitute your favorite move.  Some have said the music is wimpy.  I get around this by creating my own playlist of itunes.  I mute the TV and play the playlist on my laptop.  (You can check out my playlist on itunes- it's got Leslie Sansone in the title.)  I find that having my own playlists keep pumped up and motivated.  Finally, I've used the hand weights for 15 years but LOVE using the bands instead.  It's a much smoother and more intense feeling but you can adjust the distance you keep your hands to personalize it for you.  Again, great for cranky joints.  So, I thank you Leslie.  You've been a good and constant ""walk buddy"" throughout the years.",1359158400,2,1442,4.325842696629214

I feel this one can give you as good a workout as some of her longer ones.  The workout for the arms with the bands is excellent. As we all know as woman we need it.  The reason for the 4 stars is even though she stresses you're not learning dance moves, some of these are. And she goes pretty fast from one to the other.  Now I am a Leslies Sansone person but someone who is starting out would have a problem with this.  I am finding I do this one most often though as it is a terrific workout.  When you're finished you feel like you have done something. Thank you Leslie!",1358985600,2,736,3.827814569536424
5554389,5,B00B2Y7AL0,"I've been walking with Leslie for over 20 years. Last year I completely stopped, parked myself on the couch each night after work and went up to 175 lbs. I'm 5 feet tall, so that's a lot of weight. In the beginning of 2013 I started walking with her again and promised myself that I would walk 3 miles a day everyday. I've been doing that with Leslie's videos, but the same old moves with the same faces in the background was getting a little boring. So, I looked online saw a clip of this video and thought I'd give it a try. I absolutely love it. There are new walkers, new steps and the stretchy band adds a lot more moves. I couldn't complete all of the stretchy band moves, but I'm going to do each 3 mile walk for a week and then move on to another. I love Leslie, her constant chatter is okay. She does get a little silly when she's with her old group of cronies, but that's okay. Try this new video. I think everyone who does will really like it.",1358640000,5,954,4.106951871657754

5554392,5,B00B2Y7AL0,I liked the new combinations they make it so you have to pay more attention. I think its a perfect though shorter workout. It gets your heart rate up you tone muscles and sweat. New and fun. My new fav however is her four mile power walk not a beginner workout but its great. Love them both.,1356739200,,291,4.12280701754386

I have been using her videos for years now.  These recently released ones are really good with different moves and more intensity, of course you can always adjust to fit what is right for you.  The music in this one is kind of low but you can hear it.  I did have a sweat going.  Leslie's is so inspirational I just love her videos.",1351728000,,493,4.072916666666667

5554402,2,B00B2Y7AL0,"First, I have been disappointed in most of Leslie's newer workouts.  I feel like she is forgetting her core fan base and pushing them aside while trying to cater to the younger, already fit crowd.  I liked seeing a variety of ages, body types, and fitness levels, not a group of young, fit, overenthusiastic girls with a token man or overweight person.  The new workouts are just too ""bouncy"" for me (and I love the boosted jogging in earlier DVDs) but can't do the bouncing without severe pain. More importantly, the music is sooo low that you can't hear it but Leslie is soooo loud that you can't turn it up.

I don't recommend this one.",1348358400,31,639,4.482758620689655

She changes moves so quickly that you miss the next moves and her own steps were off quite a few times.  This DVD was a big disappointment for me because I am a HUGE fan of Leslie's and this is the only DVD that was a waste of money for me!",1348012800,19,411,3.869047619047619
5554404,3,B00B2Y7AL0,"I am a longtime Leslie fan, and have about 15 or so videos. One of my preferences is for a single start-to-finish walk rather than a bunch of separate one-mile walks strung together.  Now, I understand that some people might like to be able to only do a certain mile, but I don't like the ""stop-and-start"" of the individual miles. And I certainly wish that the makers of the videos, including this one, would just label them as ""three separate miles"" or, in the case of a continuous video, ""one complete 3 mile walk.""

That said, this video is ok.  I used a band I got from one of Leslie's other videos, so I didn't know that the included band is thicker than those included with her previous videos.  The music is really nothing to write home about, and the cueing could use some work- I find it hard to believe, that after all these years, there's not someone offscreen signaling ""1 minute left"" so that Leslie and those at home wouln't be doing 4 sets of ""mambo combos"" to complete silence (as happens here). But, as is the case with all her videos, if you put the work into it, you'll get a good workout.

By the way, what happened to all the old walking buddies Mary Kay, Linda, Joanne, and Carol?  These walkers are all MUCH younger than that group, and most look as if they could easily run a half-marathon.  The one exception in this video is a visiting Catholic priest who is now a walk leader back in my home state of RI- he's the only one who looks as if he needs to lose weight.

Regardless of all my complaints, I'll probably buy the next 20 videos Leslie puts out- they work, and I can do them in my small living room without getting down on the floor. I just hope in the future they label them so I'll know what I'm getting before the package arrives in the mail.",1347926400,44,1778,4.286567164179105

  It is a fresh dvd, with new faces, new moves, new music, etc. It also has good sound, and it is good visually overall.
 This is totally worth every penny, and I sweated more, and felt more of a burn, during this workout then some of her other intense 5 mile workouts.

I bought this one because it has the ""stretchy band"" (although she just calls it the band this time around).  I did note that the band is thicker, as reviewer K. Richardson stated, and so far I've been using one of my other bands -- will work up to the thicker band.

There are new moves I've never seen before both with and without the band.  You get a good workout with a lot of variety and an upbeat group.  As always, she provides alternatives for more advanced/higher-impact moves.

There are some new moves in this one which she doesn't show you how to do, she just goes into them and through the whole thing, she just doesn't come across as the bubbly Leslie that everyone loves, she seems rushed.
