1064443,1,6305742510,"Urban Collectors advertised something they didn't have. When I asked for a substitution, they hemmed and hawed about the price I paid. I said when a realtor has an item on the shelf with a price, they come through with the very article or a sub for the same marked price. I got a ""I have to talk tg management and will get back later to you"" then ""Our phones are out"" the ""We lost your order..start again!""",1291852800,,406,4.217948717948718
1064444,2,6305742510,"Foolish is a decent flick from No Limit Films. Eddie Griffin does what he can with the script, but it almost takes away from his acting chops. This film should have just been a stand up comedy film, because that's all it really is",1207612800,,230,4.25

 if you have an OUNCE of a sence of humor, u HAVE to see this movie

1064448,4,6305742510,"Other reviewers have given this movie a hard time, but it is unwarranted.  While it is true that the plot is a bit on the weak side, the whole purpose  of the movie is to make you laugh.  It succeeds admirably in this.  Foolish  is basically an Eddie Griffin comedy show intermingled with a movie.  The  movie itself is your standard fare.  It was fun to see Marla Gibbs again  and Master P made further strides, successfully I might add, to become a  mainstream actor.  The spot where Foolish really shines is the stand-up  routines.  Eddie Griffin is one of the best comics out there.  It's  unfortunate that he hasn't had more exposure.  All of his material was  fresh and funny.  When he was onstage, I couldn't stop laughing!  Only once  during the film was I disappointed.  This was when Griffin gave a monologue  that Chris Rock originated in Bigger and Blacker.  Even though it was a bit  plagerized, this single flaw doesn't detract from the film, especially if  you haven't seen Bigger and Blacker.  Overall, I feel that you will  ultimately be satisfied by this film if you keep your expectations in line.  This film is not the outstanding plot-driven comedy you may be searching  for, but if you are looking for some hilarious standup, Foolish will have  you rolling!",967680000,12,1279,4.656108597285068
