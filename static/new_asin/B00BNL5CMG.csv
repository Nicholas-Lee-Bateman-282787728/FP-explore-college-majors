5660233,5,B00BNL5CMG,"I had not been aware that there was such a video, until I saw it mentioned in some one of the JFK memorial commentaries, and was excited to see it was about the Johns, whom I knew a few years back. Sweet and wonderful people. I knew of his job, but not the details shown in the tape. Thought it was very well done. He was a strong man of convictions. Proud to have known them both.",1386460800,,381,3.961038961038961
5660234,4,B00BNL5CMG,"In the late 50's early 60's (right before they left for Washington) the Johns were our neighbors on Adina Drive in Atlanta.  I was so in love with Jeff, but he did not know I existed.  Though I was little my mother always thought Mr Johns a very nice man.  I'll never forget her telling the story of when she was standing on the front lawn talking to Mr. Johns and a bird flew over depositing it's poop on her cheek - finding Mr Johns in a awkward position, my wonderful, beautiful, funny mother did not miss a beat and quickly said "" birdie birdie in the sky why'ed you do that in my eye? I'm a big girl and will not cry, I'm just glad that cows don't fly!"" With that she said Mr. Johns burst into laughter, and afterwards they became fast friends, both big fans of the Kennedy's.  It was several month after that they moved to Washington, and I remember my Mother showing us his picture on Air Force One after the assignation of President Kennedy - I was 10 yrs old. My parents were huge civil right supporters and all hell was breaking lose in Atlanta...",1378512000,5,1057,4.243781094527363
8571670,5,B00BNL5CMG,This was a really interesting movie. All those who serve as Secret Service Agents have a near impossible task of protecting the President of The United States. This movie shows the aftermath of Dallas and how Lyndon Johnson becoming President in November of 1963 impacted the life of Lem Johns.,1491696000,,294,4.9

8571672,1,B00BNL5CMG,"just awful ....it could have been an interesting story but was delivered like one of those really bad 70's era movies they showed in high school social studies.

not sure why this isn't included in prime for free - not worth the 3bucks - and i don't think there was a trailer so i feel a bit ripped off.",1482624000,,303,4.135593220338983

8571679,5,B00BNL5CMG,"This documentary delivered more than I initially thought. It was compelling, insightful, and engaging. The Lem Johns story from perusing moonshiners to protecting the President of the United States is a story worth telling and it was told with great skill. I give this documentary five stars and two thumbs up A must see documentary.",1387584000,,333,5.072727272727272
