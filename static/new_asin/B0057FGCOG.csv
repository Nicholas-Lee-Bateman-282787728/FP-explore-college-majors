The rest of the DVD is very good Vintage Erotica! ... This Guy knows his business!",1419897600,,165,4.0
8460528,4,B0057FGCOG,If you want hardcore instead of strip loops and aren't a Uschi fan look elsewhere. The sound track of a 8mm projector instead of tacky music makes this a real trip back in time.,1363651200,,177,4.235294117647059
8460529,5,B0057FGCOG,"I like all the movies in it and it does not have much of story, but lots of nudity,and it it worth what I paid for it",1346716800,,117,3.3703703703703702
8460530,4,B0057FGCOG,"I liked this collection of videos because it features Uschi and well they just make them like her anymore. Don't expect anything hardcore here, the picture has been transfered well, NOT the best but it will suffice. Three hours thats a long time for the price I paid $10.",1335657600,,271,4.551020408163265
8460531,3,B0057FGCOG,"While the women are lush and their moves provocative (and skillful in their own right), this collection of old loops is hardly hardcore (though there is suggestive touching, and a couple of reels where some facial contact is implied but not shown).  The introductions by 42nd Street Pete from time to time do break up the monotony.  The majority of these reels are simply topless/nude dancers swaying to show their prodigious assets to good effect.  There are a couple of scenes of light bondage and spanking, in case this particular variation especially offends (or attracts) you, but they're not a large part of this collection.  The time period seems to range from late 1950s to the early 1970s.

The women are attractive.  Not all bombshells, but they certainly fit the criteria of this collection's title.  Uschi Digard and Candy Samples are far and away the best.  There is one reel with a woman purported to be Marilyn Monroe, but I'm skeptical.  It could be, but it isn't unquestionable.  Expect quite a bit of fur (though well-trimmed, by their contemporary standards), real bodies, and natural volumes.

Overall, this is a good representation of nude dancers' reels.  Seductive and attractive women, but still tame enough that they could fall under the more restrictive obscenity laws of the time.  I remember a time in my youth when this would have thrown me for a loop, but now it seems fairly naive to my jaded eyes.  Fun for a while, and historically significant, it's fun to watch once.",1331251200,6,1501,4.858267716535433
