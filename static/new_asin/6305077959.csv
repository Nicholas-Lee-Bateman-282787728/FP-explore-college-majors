972073,1,6305077959,"For the Blu ray it earns 5 stars and I received the package very quickly. But the information given by Amazon is not so correct. As I live in Holland I always look if a movie has english subtitles. I also did with this one and it said that it had only spanish subtitles. Because I was misinformed by Amazon before, I looked at ""Beaver com"" a very reliable source. And there was mentioned it had english subtitles. Besides that, Universal most of the time indeed does have english subtitles, so I mailed to Amazon if someone could look at the back of the Blu ray to see if it had english subtitles after all. The answer I got was ""if it is not mentioned on our site you must wait for the next release of this item, perhaps that will have subtitles"". Not very satisfying, I immediately answered that I was not satisfied and why they didn't take the little trouble to look at the Blu ray
what was correct. No more answer. So I decided to rely on ""Beaver"" and take the gamble, and that was correct, it had english subtitles. Then I complained at Amazon again and they said how I could change the information on their site when it was not correct. The world upside down. This was not the first time this happened.",1338163200,4,1208,4.302631578947368
972074,5,6305077959,"How studios and their, so called, executives decide not to keep printing copies of REAL entertainment like this amazes me.  NO talent HACKS like will ferrel and jack black have so many discs made of their TRASH and LEGENDS like Abbott and Costello go undiscovered by todays society.  It's disgraceful.

This is a great comedy/musical and a very Patriotic film.  Showing the FACT that America is the greatest country in the world and showing it in a good light.  Then again, those might be just the reasons it's been taken out of single print and hidden into box collections.

Buck Privates is a FINE Family film from a better day.  And the sweet sounds of the Andrews Sisters only adds to the Class and Greatness of this film.  It's a 5 Star Film, no questions asked.  If you don't think so, you don't know entertainment.",1277337600,4,821,4.606896551724138
972075,5,6305077959,"Bud Abbott (1895-1974) and Lou Costello (1906-59) were comedy giants for two decades, wowing the public on screen from 1940 to 1956 and on TV from 1951 to 1953. They were the true successors to Laurel and Hardy. ""Buck Privates"" was their second film, and the one that propelled them onto the A list. They followed this with nearly 40 films, the best of which were such classics as ""Hold that Ghost"" (1941) and ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948). The ""A & C Meet..."" films alone spawned 7 films. By the mid 50s the comedic style of Martin and Lewis gained the upper hand and personal disputes between the partners brought the comedy to an end. As they had eclipsed Laurel and Hardy, Martin and Lewis stole their thunder, but even today one can't help but laugh at the gags.

""Buck Privates"" is probably their best film, aided in no small part by the terrific songs and dances of the Andrew Sisters, who would join them in two more films (""In the Navy"" and ""Hold that Ghost"") that same year. LaVerne, Maxene, and Patty not only worked with Abbott and Costello, but also with The Ritz Brothers (""Argentine Nights"") and Crosby and Hope (""Road to Rio"") and also appeared with the top musicians of the 40s and 50s. At the time of ""Buck Privates"" the sisters had already established a name for themselves with such big hits as ""Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen"", ""Hold Tight"", ""Roll out the Barrel"", ""Ferryboat Serenade"", and ""Beat Me Daddy Eight to the Bar"". They perform four songs in the film - ""You're a Lucky Fellow Mr. Smith"", ""Apple Blossom Time"", ""Bounce me Brother with a Solid Four"", and ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy""  and ""Boogie Woogie"" was nominated for an Oscar as Best Original Song.

Abbott and Costello were originally a vaudeville act, and what they did was to bring their act to the big screen. Films were a series of smaller bits strung together with a plot. In this they copied the style of the Marx Brothers (even though their pedigree makes them look like successors to Laurel and Hardy, who used a completely different motif for their films) right down to the minor love plot, the menacing heavy, and the musical numbers.

There are so many funny bits in this film it's hard to list them all. Lou initiates his ""I'm a bad boy"" catchphrase that would last for more than a decade. The drill routine was originally scheduled for a few minutes but went nearly 5 due to the ad-libbing (watch closely for the reactions from the actors who participate). The verbal patter between the boys is priceless, as Bud convinces Lou that if he marries a younger woman she will eventually be older than he is. Here's a sample -

Bud - You're 40 years-old and you're in love with this little girl that's 10 years-old. You're four times as old as that girl and you couldn't marry her, could you?

Lou - Not unless I come from the mountains.

Nat Pendleton (1895-1967) plays the heavy who pursues the boys. Pendelton was famous for the ""slow burn"" and he appeared in over 100 films. He reprieved his role in 1947's ""Buck Privates Come Home"" - his last film.

Look for Shemp Howard (1895-1955) for a minor role as a cook. Shemp had been acting since 1932 when he broke away from ""Ted Healy and His Stooges"". He appeared with W.C. Fields, Fatty Arbuckle, Lon Chaney, and even John Wayne, but was making no real headway. In 1946 when brother Curly had a stroke he re-joined the Three Stooges and they made 73 short films together.

1941 was a terrific year for films - ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Maltese Falcon"", Sergeant York"", ""How Green Was My Valley"", Meet John Doe"",  ""They Died with Their Boots On"", ""The Sea Wolf"" ""High Sierra"", ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", and ""A Yank in the RAF"". With such an impressive list, ""Buck Privates"" came in at #9 at the box office.

The NY Times called it ""an hour and a half of uproarious monkeyshines."" The film grossed a record $4 million, although some placed it as high as $10 million. It received 2 Oscar nominations but no wins -  ""Boogie Woogie"" lost to ""The last time I saw Paris"" from ""Lady Be Good"" for Best Song and ""Dumbo"" won for Best Music. The film was so popular it generated a radio show later that year on the Lux Radio Theater. The Japanese were so impressed they showed the drill scene to their troops to demonstrate how poorly trained US soldiers were.

This is a great film from a great comedy team.",1267920000,11,4342,4.515923566878981

972171,5,6305077959,"Although Buck Privates would merit a 5 star rating just for the scene with the Andrews sisters belting out Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy, it more than earns it by adding in the team comedy of Abbott & Costello in their first big film, other numbers by the sisters, and liberal doses of American patriotic sentiment so characteristic of the time. The story revolves around FDR's peacetime army draft of 1940 and the unintentional enlisting of Bud & Lou as lowly buck privates. The ensuing musical comedy is very enjoyable on its own for those who like classic American pictures, but I appreciate even more the historic window this film opens onto the patriotic character of WW2 America. With all its characters in uniform, Buck Privates can be mistaken for a war film, but it actually came out in early 1941, almost a year before Pearl Harbor. The simmering levels of pre-war fervor and energy in the scenes go a long way in explaining the extraordinary mobilization that was about to occur. So when you sum all of this up, you have a bona-fide 1940s classic.

And did I forget to say that the Andrews sisters really outdo themselves in Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy?  Their definitive take on this tune must be among the top musical moments of the era. Accept no substitutes!",1456099200,,1263,4.684684684684685

Andrews Blu-ray Review: BUCK PRIVATES [1941] was the film that launched Abbott and Costello into Hollywood superstardom. In the fall of 1940, with the Draft Bill freshly signed into law by FDR, the Hollywood studios were scrambling to develop screenplays cantered on the selective service. Amongst those houses was Universal, which opted to roll the dice and place their project square on the shoulders of a pair of burlesque comics who had only appeared in supporting roles in one previous movie, the unmemorable musical revue One Night in the Tropics [1940]. The end result, BUCK PRIVATES [1941], launched Bud Abbott and Lou Costello as the dominant draws of WWII-era show business and spawned numerous. The film also grossed $4.7 million in a time when tickets cost a quarter, and outdrew such prestigious contemporary productions as Citizen Kane, How Green Was My Valley, Sergeant York and Here Comes Mr. Jordan.

What passes for a plot in BUCK PRIVATES would set the formula for Abbott & Costello's run in Hollywood, providing just enough story to give the gifted clowns of patter a setting to perform their stage-honed shtick. Sidewalk hucksters Slicker Smith [Bud Abbott] and Herbie Brown [Lou Costello] are rousted from their attempts to earn a marginally honest living by an angry cop [Nat Pendleton], and duck into a busy theatre in hopes of escape. They wind up realizing too late that the movie house has been converted into an enlistment centre, and that the ""prize drawing"" they signed for was a stint with Uncle Sam. Things get even worse when they report to boot camp, and discover that Pendleton is their master sergeant.

Basic training lent a contemporary context for Bud Abbott and Lou Costello brand of comedy, and audiences of the day responded enthusiastically. This was best demonstrated in the sequence where Bud Abbott attempts to guide the hapless Lou Costello through drill (""Throw your chest out!"" ""I'm not done with it!""), which necessitated a dozen takes because Lou Costello kept cracking up according to director Arthur Lubin. Editor Phil Cahn was under orders to preserve every foot of it, and the end result of his cobbling is brilliant. Arthur Lubin recounted how the stage veterans had some initial trouble adjusting to their new medium. ""They played to the people on the set instead of the camera. They were used to having a live audience and missed getting laughs. But they learned quickly and we had a lot of fun on that picture."" From Bud Abbott's attempts to fleece the alleged novice Lou Costello at craps, to goading him to blast the radio in defiance of Nat Pendleton's orders, their interplay is captured in peak form.

Beyond Bud Abbott and Lou Costello's foible-filled escapades in basic training, the story presents a romantic triangle between a pretty camp hostess [Jane Frazee], an arrogant playboy [Lee Bowman] certain that his father's pull will get him out of service, and his pushed-to-the-limit former valet [Alan Curtis]. Jan Frazee's support staff includes the singing Andrews Sisters, who use their multiple interludes to deliver such hits of the period as Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy from Company B, Bounce Me Brother With a Solid Four and I'll Be With You in Apple Blossom Time. In structure, Bud Abbott and Lou Costello feels like a filmed vaudeville revue, alternating comedy skits with musical numbers. The only thing I felt that let this film down is that some of the comedy between Bud Abbott and Lou Costello just did not resonate with me, and at times I found that the comedy was not funny, especially when Bud Abbott would want to belittle Lou Costello, which I found cruel and very unfunny, but luckily there is a lot more going on in the film and the brilliant songs performed by The Andrew Sisters helped me to enjoy this 1941 Black-and-White film, and especially seeing it in the glorious Blu-ray format, like it should be seen and not in that terrible inferior picture quality DVD format.

The film was a huge hit with audiences at the time and made big time movie stars of Bud and Lou. They were the top Box Office Stars in 1942, remaining in the top tier at the box office for the rest of the decade. A sequel to BUCK PRIVATES aptly titled Buck Privates Come Home with Nat Pendleton recreating his role as Sgt. Michael Collins. Even though it is seven decades since BUCK PRIVATES was in the cinema and The Andrew Sisters and the music of the time, the military draft, both now things of the past, it is easy to see why this film was such a big hit in its time and remains even today a bundle of laughs. The Abbott and Costello routines remain classic bits of comedy spreading laughs  across generations and the music has a rhythm that is as toe tapping today as it was back then. The romantic subplot is such a dud that it barely even registers, but there are some gags that make good use of the props determined by the setting Abbott and Costellos best gags often involve their play with the genre of the film they're in, and BUCK PRIVATES best scene involves Bud Abbott serving as a drill sergeant for the incompetent Lou Costello.

Blu-ray Video Quality  This Universal Pictures presentation of BUCK PRIVATES is presented in a stunning Black-and-White 1080p encoded image, with an equally impressive 1.33:1 aspect ratio. Some scenes show very clear evidence, particularly the wargames exercise, where any cut from the rougher stock footage of tanks and planes to the close-ups of the lead players immediately shows a quantum drop in the grain presence and it is evidently due to the use of DNR [Digital Noise Reduction] to smooth out the image when the cast is involved.  There are several other scenes where the DNR is evident, but there are also scenes where the picture quality is quite good. A shot of the enlistees marching past a pond, to the tune of Ill Be With You When Its Apple blossom Time, shows a lot of lovely detail in the reflection of the water.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  This Universal Pictures presentation of BUCK PRIVATES has a choice of two audio tracks, which are 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo and 2.0 Dolby Digital Stereo, that provides the best possible sound quality from the elements. The songs by the Andrews Sisters come through loud and clear, as do the rat-a-tat back and forth between Abbott & Costello. This is a solid presentation of the audio elements.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Abbott and Costello Meet Jerry Seinfeld [1994] [480i] [1.33:1] [45:41] Jerry Seinfeld pays tribute to the famous comedy team of Abbott & Costello. This NBC TV Special features classic film and television clips of the duo as well as never-before-seen home movies narrated by Lou Costello. When we first meet Jerry Seinfeld it is a mock up Vaudeville type theatre, with lookalike American old comedy stars, but it is just to set the scene on why Jerry Seinfeld loves this comedy duo of Abbott & Costello. Here we have a great wealth of information about Abbott & Costellos rise to fame. We also get a great deal of material is shown, including the complete Whos on First? routine from The Naughty Nineties, and a selection of hysterical clips from their 1950s live television programme.  Where things fall short is in any thought of depth about the lives of the comics or what was actually happening behind the scenes.  Some quick mentions are made to the tensions and competition between the two men, as well as a cursory mention of the tax problems that plagued them in the latter half of their career. But what we do get to hear a lot about Abbott & Costello from contributors like Budd Abbott, Jr.; Vickie Abbott-Wheeler; Paddy Costello-Humphreys; Chris Costello; Buzz Belmondo; Tisa Hibbs; Bart Williams; Burton Richardson; E.E. Bell; Debby Dodds; Eric Sharp and James Tumminia [Film producer].

Special Feature: 100 Years of Universal: Restoring the Classics [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [9:12] Here we get a great presentation on how Universal Pictures decided that the old classic films and some more up-to-date films needed restoring for the 21st Century and to explain the whole process, we have contributions from Bob ONeil [Vice President of Image Assets/Preservation Universal Studio Vault Service]; Peter Schade [Vice President of Universal Studios Technical Services]; Rick Utley [Vice President of Preservation Services at KODAK Pro-Tek media Preservation]; Henry Ball [Engineer at Universal Studios Digital Services]; Phil R. Defibaugh [Mastering Supervisor at Universal Studios Technical Services]; Ken Tom [Mastering Supervisor at Universal Studios Technical Services] and John Edell [Supervising Sound Editor at Universal Studios Technical Services]. But what we also get to see how they take the whole film into a digital format so they can get rid of lots of tears that was in the original negative, as well colour fading and a really bad hissing soundtrack and again make it fit for the 21st Century, so making future generations appreciate these classic Universal Pictures films.

Special Feature: 100 Years of Universal: The Carl Laemmle Era [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [8:40] Carl Laemmle was born in Germany in 17th January1867, and at the age of 17 years of age he persuaded his Father that his future was in America. The year is 1912 and seeking refuge from Thomas Edisons aggressive patent-enforcement tactics, a Chicago-based film producer named Carl Laemmle sets up operation in the rural Californian sanctuary of Hollywoodland.

We also delve into characters that had disturbed minds like in Alfred Hitchcocks PSYCHO [1960], but we also take a look at quirky characters that have appeared in the Universal Pictures films and the announcer says, Lets hope we can look forward to another 100 years of films produced by Universal Pictures.

Theatrical Trailer [1941] [480i] [1.33:1] [1:34] This is the Original Theatrical trailer for the film BUCK PRIVATES. This sadly is of very poor quality, but despite this, it is a great presentation.

BONUS: The Deluxe Limited Edition DigiBook includes a 28-page stunning booklet about the film, the stars Abbott and Costello, the Andrews Sisters and the other actors, is in the center of this hard-shell 2 disc case, with stories about the boys and the other performers. Includes script dialogue from several skits, such as the ""You're Forty and She's Ten"" sketch. Also press book cuttings, reviews, a list of stats about the career of Abbott and Costello, and bios of all the performers.

Finally, at its finest, BUCK PRIVATES achieves a measure of pre-war patriotism, and the worst it can be called is corny by today's standards. BUCK PRIVATES is a relic of a bygone age, with a decidedly different comedy ethos than a lot of what's on display nowadays. But for those who grew up with Abbott & Costello, especially in the cinema, BUCK PRIVATES remains one of their simplest, least forced entries, one which retains just the right amount of lunacy mixed in with some fantastic music interludes courtesy of the winning The Andrews Sisters. But who can resist the timeless humour of stars like Abbott & Costello, especially when so lovingly restored for this surprisingly accomplished Blu-ray debut. This new Blu-ray offers BUCK PRIVATES for the first time in high definition with a fantastic and clean transfer. In fact, this is one of the better transfers Ive seen of a black and white film, let alone one thats more than 70 years old. Highly Recommended!
