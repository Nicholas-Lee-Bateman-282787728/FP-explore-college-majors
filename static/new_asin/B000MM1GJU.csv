2737006,5,B000MM1GJU,Everytime I watch this video I am jamming along with the ladies especially B! I never get tired of this Blu Ray!,1352592000,,112,4.136363636363637
2737007,5,B000MM1GJU,"I was initially hesitant to purchase this blu-ray disk of Destiny's Child because for a baby boomer I was not sure this is for me. But there isn't enough of what I want out there yet on blu-ray so I took a chance and ordered it. Alas, it's excellent in performance, not to mention superb video and audio quality. Yes, this is a concert for my children's generation (there is some dirty dancing) but who wouldn't want the Halle Berrys of the world on his arm? We need some of those to draw us out of our shells now and again. Much effort went into the staging of this concert and the result is an excellent disk. Go for it.",1264204800,,622,4.191666666666666
2737008,3,B000MM1GJU,"High quality production delivered with high energy albeit tasteless at times with stage dancers pulling their pants down on stage to display their ""package"" in briefs, backup singers bumping talent from behind in sexual innuendos, and a call to several males in the audience that comes too close to a lap dance for my taste. I'm all for sexuality, but this performance crossed the line on several occassions. Recommended to DC fans for its presentation, superb lighting, and strong stage performances. VQ and AQ are excellent with deep blacks, beautifully saturated color, and well balanced sound. For a classy presentation  watch Shakira's Oral Fixation, or Beyonce - The Beyonce Experience concert.",1243641600,,700,5.306306306306307
2737009,3,B000MM1GJU,"If you are a Destiny's Child fan or know someone who is they will surely enjoy this disc. Some may say you don't need the Blu-ray version just the regular DVD and a player that does the upconversion, but who am I to argue? It's simply a matter of opinion!",1232323200,,255,4.12
2737010,5,B000MM1GJU,"Anyone who likes the music of Beyonce or Destiny's Child will be blown-away by this concert.
A Dazzling HD Audio & Video Feast for the senses. The Technical Engineering of this Atlanta concert is outstanding. A definite demo disc to show the perfection of your new High Def TV and HD Multichannel Surround System.

The concert is a High Octane Good Time. Great music and visually stunning choreography. Enjoy solo or at a party. You will be entertained!",1221177600,,453,4.8076923076923075
2737011,5,B000MM1GJU,"Another great release. Despite being only 1080i, the PQ is excellent. SQ is very good. Highly recommended.",1202860800,,106,5.294117647058823
2737012,5,B000MM1GJU,"I was blown away by the fabulous performance put on by Destiny's child.  These women just dance and dance and go on forever!  The color coreography of the show is nothing short of amazing, and the blu-ray really shines here.  This is no concert where people just sing and dance to a few numbers on a stage with a light show -- this is a massively coreographed visual and audio feast that just doesn't stop.  The use of big-board lighting/TVs/Projectors are computer-mixed to perfection.  And then there is the dancing.  Wow!  Highly recommended, even if you are just a casual fan of Destiny's Child, like me.  The Blu-ray explodes with awesome audio quality as well.  I especially loved the losslesss PCM 2.1 and 5.1 channel audio capability.  It really made me feel like I was at the concert!  The ladies are just gorgeous, the costumes (they changed at least six or seven times) and make-up match everything on stage perfectly during every number.  The fabulous display of colors, which changed during each number, was breathtaking, and reminded me of the awesome colors I saw on the Blu-ray movie, ""Curse of the Golden Flower.""  My girlfriend and I watched some of the numbers over and over again, just to comment on how amazing the coreography was, and how the colors blended seamlessly.  Absolutely a must-own on HD instead of standard definition!  Especially at this price!  The only bad thing I saw in the video was that one crowd camera, only used 5 or six times during the show for quick cutaways, showed some static.  Otherwise 99.9% of the show was spot-on.  I will also note that I was watching this on a 50"" 768p HDTV (1366x768 resolution).  It would look even better in 1080p, due to the stunning light board effects in the background.  I've noticed on numerous other blu-rays and TV shows that some light board backgrounds with multiple dot-sized lights can wreak havoc on screen resolutions around 720p to 768p, for some reason.  I had a 1080p set before, and it didn't suffer from those issues.  Luckily, this is rarely an issue on this Destiny's child blu-ray.  Get it!",1193356800,4,2087,4.736111111111111
2737013,5,B000MM1GJU,"Okay, I know a lot of people haven't committed to Blu-Ray or HD yet, but I did for DVD's like this one. My wife was captivated by the crystal clarity of audio and video. She is a fan and really enjoyed the show, singing along with the video. Seeing it in full HD is almost like being there. Beyonce's performance was as expected, flawless and crowd inspired. What better place to perform than before hundreds of Hot-Lanta screaming fans? The stage performances given by Destiny's Child (and her guests like T.I. and Lil Wayne) is well worth twice the cost of the disc... so this is a deal. If possible, I would highly recommend viewing this concert in HD.",1188864000,,655,4.512605042016807
2737014,5,B000MM1GJU,This was such a great deal for the price...13.99 when I bought it.  The music is great and the HD video quality is extremely good.  This is something I will watch over and over.,1187568000,,177,4.176470588235294
