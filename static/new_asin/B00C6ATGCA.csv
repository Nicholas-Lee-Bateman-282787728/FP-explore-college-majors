5691546,3,B00C6ATGCA,"I hoped this was a good gross-out slasher movie.  It started out promising.  It is even grounded in gaelic pseudo-folklore, so I was willing to give it a chance.  I'm not sure how much of the folklore is true, though.  The acting is convincing enough.  The scenery and shots are beautiful, and often very moody -- appropriate.  There are a few plot points that get set up, and not followed through.
A few gross-out scenes are great; others, don't work so well.  Texas Chainsaw Massacre overloads a viewer with gross-out scenes, then throws one funny gag scene in for laughs.  That works well.  This movie can't decide the right mix in these scenes.  The end of this movie is predictable.  You decide if the lead up is worth the payoff at the end.",1376784000,,746,4.533834586466165
5691547,3,B00C6ATGCA,"What a mess of a ""horror"" film. I'm a firm believer that a horror film should make audiences squirm in their seats with horror, but this movie becomes comical after a while. For no good reason we see the fiends moving intestines, stomachs, kidneys, and other severed human body parts from tables to pails and back again. After 30 minutes of this, the gore just becomes part of the background---not scary or horrifying anymore. The bad guy in the lair talks way too much and is laughing cynically almost all the time---like the villains in cartoons who state that they will conquer the earth, and then go ""harr-har-har!"" His assistants are not that much better. To make matters worse the ""good guys"" all seem incompetent and boring, or at least not worth cheering for. In fact, half-way through the movie I found myself feeling that I did not care if they were killed or not. Not worth the effort worrying about their lives! Maybe unwittingly, David Hayman, playing the character of cannibal Sawney Bean, turned out to be the star of the show, not because the role required great or truly menacing acting, but because he did a very good job in spite of being surrounded by blood and human body parts most of the time. And he was given a lot of screen time. Besides him, there is nobody else to root for---they all can die. So, if you like gratuitous gore dripping from buckets, tables, chairs, and walls, this is the film for you, because I would give it 5 stars or an A+ in that respect. But otherwise this film will make you laugh, and will scare you a little bit here and there. No, you won't need to sleep with the lights on afterwards, but you probably won't want to eat hamburger meat or chopped liver for a while.",1374278400,,1719,4.49520766773163
5691548,3,B00C6ATGCA,"Serves the purpose of providing a few good thrills and scares, with lots of gross thrown in...B-grade script with better-than-B-grade filming.",1374105600,,142,5.809523809523809
5691549,4,B00C6ATGCA,Saw this film at the Glasgow Film Fest . Great film of its genre . For fans of real blood and gore with some very black humour thrown in . Filmed in and around Aberdeen in Scotland and includes beautiful scenic shots of Glencoe and the Isle of Skye . Very impressive debut feature film by young director Ricky Wood who is supported by some great acting performances .,1366070400,,367,4.333333333333333

8577640,5,B00C6ATGCA,"At last, a straight to DVD horror movie that I found genuinely scary!  it was disturbing and chilling and the ending was awesome.  Inspired by the Scottish legend of Sawney Bean, the cannibal family borrowed a little bit from The Hills Have Eyes, but it was still a great stand alone movie.  I found myself clutching a pillow during several suspenseful scenes, and I even shed a tear for the girl that I was hoping would get away.
I rarely care about the victims in slasher movies.  This one, i did.
The backdrop of the Scottish Highlands was beautiful, but the underground lair of the family made me claustrophobic.  I also loved that, unlike most horror movies, in which the last survivor is a girl, in this one, it's an intrepid (and cute) reporter who discovers the family and finds himself in their hands.
There are a couple of plots twists that I didn't see coming, which made it better in my opinion.  I all around loved this movie.",1414108800,,939,4.5266272189349115
8577641,5,B00C6ATGCA,Great movie. It arrived in perfect condition.,1410825600,,45,5.571428571428571
8577642,1,B00C6ATGCA,"Perfectly awful. I rarely despise a film as totally as I did this one. If they would have stuck with the REAL legend, they could have had something, but this poorly acted, shot and presented film is not only a waste of time, but it sours you to search out really well done low budget horror.",1408752000,,291,4.214285714285714
8577643,4,B00C6ATGCA,"I did not mind paying for this rental one bit, it is a well done horror movie. The filming and acting totally professional, I don't get into dissecting horror movies, they are either cheesy and bad or just fun to watch, this was good. I also enjoyed the scenery of Scotland and hope this crew makes some more horror films.",1380326400,,322,4.383333333333334
8577644,4,B00C6ATGCA,"Extremely bloody horror flick about the Sawney Bean clan (Google it) kidnapping people for their meals and a reporter searching for the truth when a friend is found in the woods (wait until you see how she is left!). If you like gore and decent acting, you can't go wrong with this film.",1380326400,,287,4.433962264150943
