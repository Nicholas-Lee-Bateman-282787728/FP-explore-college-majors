5775117,5,B00D65P9HK,"""Blueprint"" is a wonderful story about the desire to connect with someone -soul to soul- on a level that goes deep below the physical.  It's about two people taking time out to begin a friendship and develop a meaningful relationship. ""Blueprint"" is less about sexual orientation and more about the need for human companionship. Keith and Nathan's interactions display restraint in choosing quality time spent together getting to know each other personally, rather than sexually. Their parts are written so well that they are able to become intimate with each other, without becoming sexually involved. Even though they had the opportunity to explore each other sexually, they display gentle, affectionate touches instead. Touches of affection that last beyond the day spent together and extend beyond the borders of NYC. ""Blueprint"" moved at a slow pace which is a good thing, because it gave me time to feel what Keith and Nathan were feeling for each other. Kirk Shannon-Butts wrote a beautiful screenplay about what can happen when two people choose to share something deep and real, rather than something superficial and false. Movie critics may find several faults and flaws in this film and miss out on its simple beauty. This movie is best enjoyed while not sitting in the movie critic chair. Don't be misled by the packaging, which is simply a wallet like case the size of a CD case. ""Blueprint"" is a low budget movie that will leave you on an emotional high.",1405468800,7,1468,4.967479674796748

see more ambitious movie projects
in his future.  Maybe something inter-racial?
He seems to be at a good start.",1399939200,,150,4.518518518518518

8589826,3,B00D65P9HK,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this film. I thought BYF's character was a bit standoffish / rude, and I couldn't figure out why this character was written the way it was. I thought Damion Lee's character was on point. Could have done without the white guy encounter, not sure if it added or diminished that particular scene of intruding upon their privacy in the lake...",1438560000,,373,4.582089552238806

8589832,3,B00D65P9HK,"About 5 minutes into watching this DVD, I realized it was something I had already saw on Youtube. In any case, the movies stand out star for me was Blake Young- Fountain. He is so adorable! And I remembered him from Patrick Ian-Polks""The SkinNY.  I would have liked to seen the bromance blossom over the course of more than one day. It seemed like it was a little fast paced and rushed. I really enjoyed seeing some very familiar Harlem neighborhoods,especially 135th st. I spend a lot of time in that area when I visit NYC. Overall, it was entertaining and I recommend it!",1422316800,2,573,4.509615384615385
