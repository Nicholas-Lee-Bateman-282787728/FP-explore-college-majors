8211681,2,B000U07EKE,I bought 3 Little Bear DVDs.  Poor quality.  Would not buy more.  These are more the quality dollar stores used to sell.,1375142400,,120,4.363636363636363
8211682,5,B000U07EKE,I love Little Bear and all that the stories.  They send a good message in manners and how to care about others.,1363132800,,111,4.045454545454546
8211683,5,B000U07EKE,This is an awesome video for kids. My 1 year old loves them. It ships right away. Little bear plays music in the back ground as it has little topics. There is more then one show.,1340582400,,178,3.9722222222222223
8211684,5,B000U07EKE,"I have always loved these Little Bear episodes on NickJr. It's one of the only genuinely sweet shows left on TV for kids. I like this array of episodes on this disk. I also purchased Feel Better Little Bear, Grandmothers House, Halloween and Rainy Day tales. You should purchase a bunch of these DVD episode sets (each one has 10 shows on them). I'll probably end up buying more to collect them all! P.S. It's better to buy the used versions... half the price usually and same quality!",1337472000,4,485,4.5227272727272725
