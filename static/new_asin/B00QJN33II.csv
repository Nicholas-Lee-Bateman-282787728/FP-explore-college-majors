Hair by Mr. Bean of London

Next he goes to a pet show, starting of by cheating at a dexterity game by unplugging the fault-detection and next deciding to play 'hit the headmaster' not just with the provided wet sponges, but wit anything not too heavy for him to lift; then he enters his teddy-bear for the obedience ...",1422921600,45,5546,4.479723046488625

6872860,5,B00QJN33II,"I first watched this show on HBO back in the 90's, and fell in love with it. So when the first ""Whole Bean"" came out I got it. I thought something was missing when I watched, and when checking reviews sure enough the top review mentioned cut scenes. Well, I checked Shout's website, and this release contains the missing scenes (""Turkey Weight,"" ""Armchair Sale,"" ""Marching"" & ""Playing With Matches"") which is fantastic. These are however, listed as bonus features, so I don't think their in the show where they played. I'm not sure if these are all the missing scenes, so if anybody knows any others please mention it. The $20 price is great, sellers are asking $120+ for the old set, which is a laugh itself!",1419638400,66,709,4.590551181102362

The initial order was as a Christmas gift for my husband - we eagerly sat down to watch the Christmas episode and found that that specific disc (and another) wouldn't play. Promptly received a replacement; however, none of those discs worked at all. Based on the multiple negative reviews indicating similar issues, we will not be trying for a third time. Highly disappointed as there were many people who were able to leave 5 star reviews. Thank you Amazon for the great customer service with the returns, but clearly there must be a quality control issue which hopefully will be remediated.",1515974400,,658,4.883928571428571

As far as the physical product itself, it's a bit of a mess.  Whoever manufactures this DVD case really needs to reevaluate their product - the clips that hold the discs are designed so badly that you can't press the DVDs into them.  They're not even broken, they just don't work somehow.  I'm amazed my discs weren't scratched to hell when it arrived because 2 of the 3 were free to bounce around inside.",1471046400,,443,4.432098765432099

But my husband laughed out loud all through the movie. Recently, I bought another movie for him, and discover our grandchildren LOVE Mr. Bean. They watch the video over and over. So I bought this one and they love this too. And I confess, the more I watch Mr. Bean, the more I realize he is pretty clever. I mean, to keep you entertained, even laughing, for two hours without speaking more than 12 words the whole time -- that really is rather brilliant.",1468627200,2,610,4.359649122807017

6872963,5,B00QJN33II,"After all these years, Mr. Bean still holds a special place in my heart. Normally I'm not into slapstick comedy that much, but when combined with the incredible social ineptness of Mr. Bean and his extreme bumbling , I think it is comedy gold.  Rowan Atkinson will always be my go-to for hours of pure laughs.

This set has 14 Episodes on 3 discs, each episode contains 1-3 comedy sets, in which Mr. Atkinson displays his comedic genius with facial contortions and impeccable timing.

Mr. Bean always tries to be graceful, and wants to be admired while at the same time being frugal. One almost aches for him as he goes to a fancy restaurant  , signs and sets out a birthday card for himself, and then goes into sticker shock at the prices.

But his inventiveness is incomparable. Late for a Dentist appointment, Mr. Bean has to dress himself while driving through town...in his iconic Mini Cooper.

You can get a sense of English living as you watch Mr. Bean at his home, a small flat with only the basics, but anyone who has ever redecorated may appreciate Mr. Bean's efforts ( DISCLAIMER : Do not try this at home, kids ! )

Younger children may snigger at the scenes of brief nudity, so if you get offended by mild naked humor, some discretion may be necessary.

 Overall, this set will give you hours of laughter and somehow they never get old. I highly recommend this box set to anyone who enjoys laughing!

Its funny, witty, of Mr. Bean does not talk very much but the funny situations he gets in can and has happened to many of us in real life. He is like the British Male version of Lucille Ball with the slap-stick comedy.

6873074,3,B00QJN33II,"Please note I am reviewing the product and not the show. Mr. Bean the show receives 5 stars from me.

With regards to this new Shout release: it appears to me that Shout has done something with regards to the frame rate and I'm not sure if I can get used to it. I've watched Mr. Bean enough to where I'd notice any slight changes and the ""pacing"" of the show seems to have been altered.

At the very beginning of episode 2 (from which I took the screen grab) Mr. Bean almost appears to be walking in slow motion. Popped in the A&E set and it does not have that issue. Also you can clearly see in the screen grabs they've messed with the resolution as well.

Why oh why can't they just give these masters a high quality scan and leave everything else be...

Accompanying this short review are two pictures. 1st from the A&E set, the 2nd from the Shout set. The picture quality is much improved on the shout set, but changing the pacing of the show is something I may not be able to get used to.

The packaging itself is ok with me except I would have liked a better place holder for the episode guide. I also commend Shout! for including the Best Bits of Mr. Bean as well as the deleted scenes.",1432166400,26,1193,4.1695652173913045

Rowan's specialty is ""physical comedy""--getting an audience to laugh simply with his facial expressions and motions.  This is on full display in Mr. Bean, in which long portions of time go by without any dialog at all: simply watching him get himself into some ridiculous situation and keep making it worse.

If you enjoy physical comedy without a lot of dialog, this show puts Mr. Atkinson's talents on full display.",1430524800,4,689,4.854700854700854

6873090,4,B00QJN33II,"I grew up with Mr. Bean. It is some of the greatest english comedy I've ever seen. The quality of this new set is amazing. I've never seen the show look this good. This has the same stuff as the previous ""Whole Bean"" set from a few years ago, so I won't go too much into that. I'll just talk about a little problem that bugs me. I've only watched a couple of episodes so far, so I can't speak to the whole set, but at the end of the episodes, in the upper right corner, a little rectangle appears for a few seconds. It's not that obtrusive and not a major problem, but it is annoying. I asked Shout Factory, the people that made this set, about the box and they said that it was on the master tapes they were sent to use. They said it's some sort of mark to denote where commercials should go when aired on tv.

But this is odd, seeing as the last set didn't have this mark. If my OCD kicks in enough about this, I'm going to track down a copy of the previous set just so the little box doesn't bug me.",1429228800,4,1002,3.9603960396039604

6873096,4,B00QJN33II,"If you never owned Mr. Bean on DVD, this is the perfect set!  Picture quality is improved over the previous set and the same extras are ported over minus two UK comic relief skits but some new pieces are included.

If you are deciding whether or not to replace what you already have, here are a few things to consider:

-The case is pretty flimsy and cheap, and might cause scratching (which happened to my third disc in the set).

-The frame rate of the video has been changed.  I believe this was done to have the footage shot on tape match the outdoor/film footage, so you will notice a big difference in the look of the show.

-Audio is pretty good, however, I do notice audio level popping when music is present.

-Lastly, the editing is top notch.  The previous set had some awkward cuts and different intros.  This set has been streamlined and is more consistent which is nice, no more awkward cuts.

All in all, for the price, it's not a bad upgrade.  I think I would have been just fine with keeping the previous set.  But once I got used to the new frame rate, it's all good!",1427932800,17,1085,4.316831683168317

6873099,5,B00QJN33II,Wonderful Content. Rowan Atkinson is a top notch comedic performer.  Be careful about getting good discs though- the slim packaging does not protect the discs and your brand new discs might have many scratches and marks even though they've never been played.,1427587200,35,258,5.142857142857143

6873101,5,B00QJN33II,"My Favorite Parts...
I purchased this set pre-order for $18. It was worth every penny! I never seen the original set that was released but this ""remastered"" set is really good looking. While it's not HD, it's the best picture quality I've seen with the Mr. Bean series. Crystal clear and sharp! Hard to believe it was SD video from the late 80's. The documentary of Rowan Atkinson's journey to Bean stardom was really interesting, boring at times, but definately worth a watch. The deleted scenes were short but really nice to have since I've never seen them before. The case is nice and compact, fits on the shelf like a 1-disk DVD case. It securely holds all the discs without any problems. The booklet inside clearly states what episodes are on which disk and a brief summary. The menu on the DVD's look similar, showing a summary of each episode as you scroll through. A really great way to design a DVD menu for a bunch of episodes.

Negative impressions...
The sound seemed a bit off, as if it distorted a little but this was only a few times. It still wasn't distracting and I believe most people probably won't notice it. Overall, the sound is still clear and non-muffled. The Mr. Bean movies are NOT included but can be easily purchased anywhere cheaply. The DVD case has problems snapping shut sometimes and I almost broke the tabs that close it together. Fortunately, the plastic is thick and durable. It hasn't broke yet but may require special attention when being closed up. The booklet MUST be kept in the front. Otherwise, the case will not close right.

If you never bought the Mr. Bean series before, buy it now! This is a great collection that's actually affordable AND great quality.",1427328000,3,1703,4.6544850498338874
6873102,3,B00QJN33II,it was good to see they rereleased the set though it was a decent job at best. I received it in the mail today. The quality is not crisp but looks the same as a vhs tape. Special features are okay but doesn't seem to include as many as the old set did. Someone could bootleg something as good as this. Not worthy to be called an anniversary edition.,1427328000,2,349,4.072463768115942
8691684,5,B00QJN33II,"Classic Mr Bean collection of funny episodes.  No different from silent movies where acting takes center stage, where facial expressions tell the story, and situational comedy keeps you laughing uncontrollably.  Aside from the latest Mr. Bean movie, this is a must have for your comedy selection albeit short episodes, when binge watched, it's definitely a movie.",1531958400,,363,5.464285714285714
