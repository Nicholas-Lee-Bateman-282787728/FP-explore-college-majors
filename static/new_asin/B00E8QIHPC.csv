8602630,5,B00E8QIHPC,Peter Follansbee is a real master craftsman and a masterful teacher.  He shows how to approach the 17th century carving in a series of simple steps.  He pays great attention to details such as how to hold the gouges and how to position your body for various cuts. The DVD ends with 3 detailed examples of carving.  I am not an experienced carver but I tried pattern #2 and it looks much better than I could have hoped for.  This can only mean that the instruction was clear.  It seems that it would not be difficult to make variations from the patterns shown once the basics have been mastered.,1424304000,,594,4.412844036697248
8602631,4,B00E8QIHPC,I got this dvd because the style of Peters work is very unique.  there are several things going on when you look at some of his work.  This dvd helped me get more familiar with carving in his 17th century style. Thanks Peter! I really dig that the cuts are not actual carving but individual shapes from the chisel.  Looking forward to more!,1387670400,,340,4.365079365079365
