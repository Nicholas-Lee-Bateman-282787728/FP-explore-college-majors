7950639,5,B00005QJIM,"So much more than a ""horror movie""!
A steady pace and secrets are discovered at the right time.

The story is somewhat told from a 3rd person perspective.
The story revolves around two girls that are in love... and are not!

The story includes a ""murder mystery""!

There are plenty of ""ghost themes"" and ""gay themes"" are also heavily explored without having to show it.

Human themes are also explored such as rejection, betrayal, forgiveness, and manipulation!

Don't worry! All of the nudity has been cut out... along with about twnetly minues of storyline.",1454284800,,559,4.904255319148936
7950640,1,B00005QJIM,"I may have loved this movie but since it has no captions and I don't speak the language, Amazon gets one star.  Having experienced a lot of frustration trying to watch Amazon movies these days, it's is so disappointing I may just go back to Netflix.  Bet this one doesn't get published.",1452124800,,286,4.480769230769231

7950642,1,B00005QJIM,"This movie was made by people who DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEIR FILM IS ABOUT.  It makes absolutely no sense at all, and if that's how you like your movies, then go ahead and buy this junk.  I guarantee you - you will be absolutely confused and angry by the end.  And any 'good' reviews you see - well, read them, please - and you will see that those clowns are afraid to admit that this is a convoluted mishmash.  And you will find that none of those folks can even figure it out.  Not a single critic can tell you what it's about.  THAT MAKES FOR GOOD FILMMAKING??!  No way.  Granted, the film contains great production design, beautiful photography and (initially) fine editing & performances.  But trust me - when it goes into the final half hour, the film bugs out like the worst, most idiotic of 4th-year film-student existential essays - and on drugs.  You will be massively pissed at having been taken.  By the way, I love symbolic filmmaking, & loved MOMENTO and Lynch's MULHOLLAND DRIVE.  But those films are laser-clear compared to this ungodly mess.  Pass on this one!!",1093132800,,1094,4.49238578680203
7950643,2,B00005QJIM,"Muddled and mediocre Korean supernatural soaper shows some technical and compositional finesse but is ruined by a nearly incoherent and unrewarding script (and one of the shrillest casts ever).  Like some (...) child of an indie sapphic coming of age tale and a Sixth Sense style atmospheric horror flick, Memento Mori starts out on a promising note but soon falls apart to the point where a prop, an elaborate diary/scrapbook belonging to one of the film's tragic heroines, is the most compelling thing on the screen.  Die hard Asian genre fans may want to check it out, but will likely be disappointed by it's art house pretension, afterschool special melodrama and clumsily, sometimes laughably executed chills.
The story, told with the aid of frequent, and often confusing flashbacks, focuses on one girl's obsessive love for another and a third girl's discovery of the second girl's diary.  After an eternity of pointless set up at the bizarre high school where the film takes place, the film still waits until the last few minutes to decide what direction to go in; it chooses horror, and proceeds to waste everyone's time again until the credits finally roll.
Memento Mori is subpar as art house drama, school drama, lesbian romance, suspense film and horror movie.  One can only assume it's art house elements are what have led to it's gaining a stateside release while dozens of far more effective Korean and Japanese genre efforts languish unreleased.",1085875200,,1461,5.024793388429752
7950644,2,B00005QJIM,"I am sitting here reading reviews of this movie and I see words like ""fright"", ""scary"", etc.  What?  If this is scary, then ""Beaches"" is a hardcore snuff film.  This movie is totally not scary.  It's about Korean high school girls and that's it.  Yeah, one girl offs herself, and the others sit around and discuss her.  It's weak.  No nothing.  If you think this is scary, I bet you are deadbolting your doors after a good healthy dose of Barney or Dragon Tales. Watch Ju-On if you want scary.  If you want Korean scary, watch Bloody Beach or Scissors.  This is the weakest link.",1068681600,2,579,4.428571428571429
7950645,4,B00005QJIM,"Well, I was not disappointed with Memento Mori, and found that the director too a very old type of ghost story, and turned it into something beautiful and haunting.  The only thing that holds the movie back from being amazing is the sloppy pacing, and some weird plot device that never really pan out to anything. Other than that a highly recomended film.",1052524800,,355,4.634920634920635
7950646,5,B00005QJIM,"This movie is more than just a good scare.  It puts into perspective the relationship between girls in an all-female environment.  It's very competitive, it's very aggressive, but also very sexual.  The plot gives an interesting twist to a lesbian relationship that is more than sex.  It is more than attraction.  It's obsession.  It's completeness.  The girls are part of each other.  The Carrie-like ending is the climax of the jealousy and frustration.  It really is quite a stunning movie, and it is beautifully shot (I'm thinking of the introduction scene for example).  The diary is also incredibly beautiful.  Really, a movie to see.",1032307200,2,640,5.0576923076923075
