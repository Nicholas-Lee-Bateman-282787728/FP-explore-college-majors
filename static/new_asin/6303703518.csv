to stay away from men that are too handsome. Some things are too good to be true. She was wise.

I would not recommend this to anyone.",1513900800,,285,3.830508474576271
8031430,4,6303703518,"An excellent slightly ""B"" picture. The acting is a little stiff and canned, but all in all good entertainment, especially if you like a twist and turn filled murder, mystery, little sex type flick. It kept you guessing about what was really going to happen right up until the end. Highly recommended. Amazon had a great price, just wish there was an original DVD of it.",1316736000,,369,4.606060606060606

THE PLOT HAS SOME GREAT THRILLING MOMENTS ,IF NOT TOTALLY UNEXPECTED, HOWEVER ENOUGH SEX APPEAL IS CREATED BETWEEN THE TWO LEADS TO MAKE THIS AN EROTIC THRILLER TO WATCH.",988416000,5,481,4.239130434782608
