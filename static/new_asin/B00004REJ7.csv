This is the film you'll watch if you're looking to see people living traditionally. It is one of a few documentations we have today that shows us something that will possibly be extinct in later times. These people's lives are changing today and maybe one day we won't see them like this any more. That is why I liked this documentary - because I was seeing something that is rare to see in this time.",1291420800,,584,4.3090909090909095
