5408435,4,B00AB2O0TO,"I mainly wanted to write this review to temper the expectations of some.  It is a very good movie, but not great.  Marquand wrote a number of novels, the best movie adaptation is clearly H.M. Pulham Esquire with Robert Young and Hedy Lamarr (see that for sure).  If you are a Ronald Colman fan as I am you will like this movie as well, but it is carried mostly by his character.  Most of the supporting cast is fair, but clearly of B status to the star.  Like ""Pulham"" the story centers on people trapped in their east coast class structures and both move at a slow pace.  The missing element is the great love story in ""Pulham"" that isn't really there in this tale.  His kids' love affairs are very backseat to the father character.  In some ways, Charles Coburn's character in the ""Pulham"" film is Colman's character here, but thrust into a secondary role.  You will enjoy the movie, but don't go in expecting a classic.",1377129600,2,922,4.440476190476191

5408437,4,B00AB2O0TO,"I doubt this film could have been pulled off without Ronald Colman in the title role as a descendant of the prominent Apley family of Boston. His entire life is taken up with people of similar background, and he considers anything outside of the Back Bay of Boston to be a foreign country. The film is set in the years prior to WWI and horse drawn forms of transportation are still the norm. He believes in his own form of noblesse oblige, and is very satisfied with his ways of giving back to the community - Tuesday Night Club on Tuesday, Wednesday Night Club on Wednesday - need I say more?

In this rarefied museum piece of a life, George's children are about to turn everything upside down. His daughter is in love with a Harvard professor - so far so good - who is a Yale man! And the young man is teaching that Emerson is a rebel! Even worse, his son is in love with a young lady from Worcester whose father is president of a tool and die works! ""A foreigner"" as George himself says. To top things off a flashing electric sign advertising Grapenuts has been put within sight of his front door.

Like I said before, if the part of George was played by anybody else but the dapper and charming Colman, this guy would probably come across as insufferable. As it turns out, George really has a generous soul, a point that is driven home by Colman's portrayal, but his point of view is crowded with traditions that are centuries old whose origin he doesn't really understand himself, and to step away from them - or to see any member of his family step away from them - leads to a sense of discomfort that makes him feel that he perceives a wrong that must be righted.

I'll let you watch and see how this all works out, but it really is a delightful comedy of manners with real heart and delightful character actors in the supporting roles. Highly recommended.

As for quality, the sound and picture are excellent.",1370736000,8,1917,4.391549295774648
5408438,5,B00AB2O0TO,"This is one of those movies I saw as a child and I never forgot it.  It was a book first, then a successful play, and finally a movie with Ronald Colman perfect as the lead.  My whole family quoted from this movie for many years and it was never available on any kind of release.  Now, it's out and it is so enjoyable.  Thanks to Fox!",1360540800,13,334,3.9402985074626864
5408439,5,B00AB2O0TO,"""The Late George Apley"" is a true comedy classic.  I held my breath when this DVD arrived hoping for a good print.  I wasn't disappointed.  It delivers a top-notch cast (including some of Hollywood's greatest character actors), wonderful script, excellent photography and masterful direction by Joseph L. Mankiewicz (""A Letter to Three Wives"", ""All About Eve"").  If I have any complaints it's that a snippet of film is missing (it's the same in all the prints I've seen).  In the scene where Vanessa Brown is about to play her piano waltz there's an obvious, sharp cut and when it returns Peggy Cummins is suddenly in the scene without actually having entered the room. Did some TV station cut the solo and neglect to put it back in?  Regardless, anyone who buys this DVD is in store for pure entertainment.  ""The Late George Apley"" had it's New York premiere as the Easter attracion at Radio City Music Hall and earned rave reviews.  It hits Boston snobbery but always with humor and warmth.  I often chuckle thinking of it paired on a double bill with ""The Shocking Miss Pilgrim"", a fun Betty Grable musical, with Gershwin lyrics that proclaim in Boston ""even a salad must have dressing"".  Ignore the comments about the print.  This is as good as it's going to get.  Any classic film fan will appreciate this quality production.  Sit back and enjoy it.",1357171200,24,1354,4.735042735042735
5408440,5,B00AB2O0TO,"The 20th Century Fox Cinema Archives reissue of ""The Late George Apley"" is a fine transfer to DVD-R, as clean as when I first saw it on television. Disregard the misapplied review that claims it is an inferior transfer from videotape. That was written for a shoddy bootleg version that is no longer being sold through Amazon. You may place full confidence in this product. I'm glad to have it, because I've waited for a playable DVD version for years.",1356912000,15,451,4.65
5408441,2,B00AB2O0TO,"I have wanted this movie for sometime.  Unfortunately the  tansfer to DVD from another media is amaturish, badly flawed. . . I am not a happy camper and will think twice before I buy at Amazon in the future.  This DVD is not of a quality one would expect from Amazon!  If I had paid $5.99 it would have been too much.",1348444800,5,317,4.064516129032258
8549539,3,B00AB2O0TO,"I'm a big Ronald Coleman fan and hail from Boston so when I saw this on Turner Classic Movies I enjoyed it but could not find it anywhere on DVD or VHS (yes, I still have a VCR). I was happy to finally be able to get a copy but when I watched it this time it didn't seem as funny/entertaining and the quality wasn't that great.  But at least I have it in some form.",1514419200,,365,3.8026315789473686
8549540,4,B00AB2O0TO,"For the record I liked the Marquand book, The Late George Apley but I found it sad. Ronald Colman makes George Apley the proper, Boston Brahmin the perfect straight man for a movie that is funny and touching and never maudlin. Backing him is a cast that plays their snobbery, their irony and their family frictions such that all are believable sources of fun. Rather than give way to suggestive words it is sufficient to say that nothing is said, done or seen that would tend to embarrass any family member. This is a movie for everyone.

By focusing in on the last sections of the Marquand novel we are never told that this is a biography of a man now deceased. Instead we have a lively, if stuffy, wealthy and tradition bound head of the large Apley Family, George. During the movie he will have to face snobbery at his expense, a not so close deceased relative who is so forward as to be interred in the wrong spot in the family plot. Ultimately he must deal with a daughter who is his equal in strength and independent where he is almost incapable of independence.

Yet between the writers and director we see that within George Apley has the potential to break out of some habits. This keep the character from devolving into caricature.

All together a relaxing and for the family movie night.",1498089600,2,1298,4.514893617021277

friend, he and his wife must learn how times and people changed. The youngsters show 'em the
mirror how they are. Mankiewicz is a master of silent comedy. You don't laugh loud. You smile.
Coleman is perfectly cast in this very amusing movie.",1398124800,,339,4.573770491803279
