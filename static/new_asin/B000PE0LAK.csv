Innovative composition and application.  Only limited by his lack
of exposure to the rest of the world.  A true genius.",1251590400,2,187,4.78125
2816990,5,B000PE0LAK,"Me declaro un fan de Cerati, desde el disco de Nada Personal por aquellos das de Soda, ahora bien Gustavo a sabido mantenerse en la cresta de la ola y este trabajo demuestra que es as.

En trminos de mezcla 5.1 el concierto explora territorios que aun hay gente que no ha visitado, como ejemplo pongo el trabajo de mezcla en ""Planta"" es sencillamente extraordinario, pero como todo no es perfecto, se puede decir que el uso de SW est en los limites del abuso, aun as es algo que yo perdono porque me gusta el balance general de la mezcla.

Los documentales de la gira y la grabacion del disco estn muy bien y son  sper ilustrativos de lo que hay detrs del trabajo musical de Gustavo Cerati, para mi ha sido una gran compra.",1234828800,,723,4.301470588235294

2816992,4,B000PE0LAK,"After the extraordinary ""Ahi vamos"" tour from last year, it became kind of obvious that this was Gustavo's best moment to release a live album.  When it was announced that Sony/BMG would release a live DVD+CD we all thought it would be a live CD and a live DVD (like other similar releases); for some bizarre reason, this release contains the original studio album ""Ahi vamos"" with the bonus DVD of the concert Gustavo gave in Buenos Aires on 2006. If we are to assume that Cerati's fans already own the studio album, why not give us a choice? Why should we buy this CD+DVD with an album we already own just so we can get the concert on DVD? I understand that by including the CD they can justify a higher price, but why not release a single DVD and a separate presentation for those who didn't own the CD? The missing star I did not give to this release is because of this.

The abum presentation is interesting, the digi-pack version is the one I found more compelling, the graphic design is very similar to the one used in the ""Ahi vamos"" album with some small twists in it.

The concert

Mastered in both stereo and Dolby 5.1 and presented in 4:3 format, the disc captures the essence of the concerts from this tour. The concert contains 11 out of the 13 songs from the studio album ""Ahi vamos"" (""Otra piel"" and ""Dios nos libre"" are not included) as well as songs from his solo career and Soda Stereo's. The performance is excellent, even though there is not too much production, the lights and screens behind the band are used creatively to enhance the experience of the concert. It is difficult to mention any highlights as most of the ""Ahi vamos"" songs are great; from Soda's catalog he included ""Ecos"", ""Te para tres"" (one of the best songs of the show), ""Profugos"" and ""Planta"". ""Engana"" (in a very interesting alternate version), ""Cosas imposibles"", ""Vivo"" and ""Puente"" are also included.

The band is great and Gustavo's performance is at his best moment as a solo artist. Maybe the only complain I have about the DVD is the excessive edit it has, there are some songs (take ""Caravana"" for example) in which the excessive use of different takes doesn't let you enjoy the song as you'd like, sometimes you don't even know what you're looking at.

Extras include a comprehensive documentary of the recording, another one for the tour (similar to the one in ""una parte de le euforia""), a bonus live version of ""Crimen"" with Ricardo Mollo and the three existing promo videoclips at the time this DVD was released (""Crimen"", ""La excepcion"" and ""Adios"")",1189900800,8,2558,4.598684210526316

2816994,4,B000PE0LAK,"Si te gusta Cerati, claro que te va gustar Ahi Vamos DVD. The camerawork is intentionally choppy and is themed in the black and white presentation of the album packaging, with understated colors.  It's not as smooth or colorful as Soda Stereo's ""El Ultimo Concierto"", and it's a little tough to focus on the video portion.  Audiowise, the sound quality is a little rough around the edges as well.  The volume rises and falls and is especially noticeable if you burn the audio down to MP3.  Trackwise, the selections are excellent featuring songs mostly from Ahi Vamos but also including songs from other Cerati albums ""Siempre es Hoy"", ""Bocanada"", and songs from Soda Stereo.  My favorite parts of the DVD are the ""extras"" which include documentaries on how the tour was produced and another documentary on how the album was made.  The packaging is nice and simple featuring simple and features what I might describe as Asian/Gothic/ Escher-esque artwork inside.  The ""extra's"" make up up for the audio and video deficiencies. If you're a fan, you'll like it!",1180137600,3,1059,4.915730337078652

8190828,5,B000PE0LAK,"Desde hace ms de dos dcadas soy hincha oficial de Soda Stereo. He venido siguiendo la trayectoria solista de Gustavo Cerati, y este DVD es fabuloso. Pese a que Cerati ha intentado hacer una fusin de rock con msica electrnica, cosa que no le agrada a todos los que son fanticos de Soda, Ah Vamos supone una vuelta a las races rockeras que le hicieron famoso con el tro argentino. La puesta en escena de Ah Vamos, la que est en este DVD, es increble. Por eso considero que quien se precie de ser un autntico fantico de Cerati debe tener este trabajo.",1297382400,,548,4.330097087378641
