8251891,1,B0013LP9MY,"I purchased the "" Vampire collection "" meaning more than one movie,  I have only received  "" Twins of Evil "" and I was sent the 15 rating instead of the 18 rating, I am owed 2 additional films  "" Countess Dracula "" and "" Vampire Circus"" and growing EXTREMELY frustrated with you. You promised complete delivery of a collection ( once again meaning more than one film ) by March 11 th, today is now the 12th, where are my other films ? VERY UN - IMPRESSED with your degree of customer satisfaction !!!",1394582400,,500,4.242105263157895
8251892,5,B0013LP9MY,"The DVD I was supposed to receive contained two films: twins of evil and the vampire circus, the DVD I received contained only ""The Twins of Evil"".  For me that was not a problem because the film I really wanted was that one and it turned out a great copy with an uncut film just like the one I watched way back in 1972 in a cinema. If you like Hammer films this one is a great surprise eventhough, being a vampire film, doesn't have Christopher Lee or Ingrid Pitt in the cast. The twin sisters Madeleine and Mary Collinson are a real treat to the sight and Peter Cushing playing a religious fanatic is impeccable. Good amount of nudity in this one and a thrilling story with two good villains the fanatic and the vampire Count Karnstein.",1354147200,,738,4.3478260869565215

First off, yes this is the movie starring the Collinson Twins the first twins as Playboy Centerfolds. Yes they are beautiful & sexy. Yes any guy would sleep with either or both. The note worthy thing here is that both put in a tremendous acting performance.

Mary plays the pure virtuous sister Maria & Madeleine plays the I want to be bitten in the neck sister Frieda. As Frieda asks in the show, What if I don't want a good man? Peter Cushing is excellent as their witch hunting uncle that burns all evil to purify it. The usual group of Hammer Film supporting cast is here & as great as usual.

This was surpassingly good & told as the simplest vampire tale I have seen. Two nieces are sent to guardianship with their uncle played by Peter Cushing. He, of course, lives in the village directly below Karnstein Castle. Although the twins are impossible to tell apart by sight they do not remotely resemble each other in spirit. Good vs evil, Greedy vs content, dominant vs submissive all play here & very well from both. If you're looking for lots of nudity as in Lust for a Vampire you'll be somewhat disappointed but not totally. As I said earlier this is a straight forward & refreshing vampire story with a few surprises in story line. I am choosing to leave those out of this review & hope others have too.

It is the great sense of Evil that this movie portrays so effectively. Against that, Peter Cushing's puritanical over zealous errors play powerfully. The vivid desire to be evil (Frieda) is shown against the desire to only be contented, be pleasant & a refreshment to others (Maria). Set against the village elders misguided tyrannical rule that bears fruit non-the-less in the end. Don't miss this 3rd installment of the Karnstein Castle & Mircalla / Carmilla / Marcilla Karnstein. The pacing of the scenes is ideal & the flow of the story perfect. I found no errors here. 5 stars all around & Thank You to Hammer Films.",1265328000,3,1972,4.562146892655368
