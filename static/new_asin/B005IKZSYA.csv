4709539,2,B005IKZSYA,"I wish I could be more enthusiastic about this film.  Nanni Moretti is a very engaging actor and director and I started off 'on his side'; but I have to say that the film is disappointing.  It is not even very funny.  'Mildly amusing' is nearer the mark; but the main problem is that it starts with an interesting idea and doesn't take it anywhere.

The plot turns on the idea that traditionally the Pope (like the British monarch) does not resign; and therefore, a Pope who feels that he does not have a calling, has a real problem; but there is no real resolution of the problem.  Various possibilities are suggested, but to suggest possibilities is not the same as constructing a plot; and the main character - the psychiatrist, played by Nanni Moretti - puts his energies into a rather silly subplot involving the Cardinals, rather than in developing the story.

In fact, there have been Popes who have resigned, most famously Pope Celestine, who resigned in 1294 and whose 'Grand Refusal' was referred to by Dante in his 'Divine Comedy'.  Celestine's resignation was hardly a great success: he was kidnapped by his successor and died in imprisonment.  Dante placed him in Hell.  I hoped that the ending of the film, at least, would be dramatic and possibly uplifing; but instead it is simply sad.

Sorry, Nanni

4709547,4,B005IKZSYA,"I think any minister, priest, monastic might find this funny and enjoyable. It is said, that only someone who does not want to be Pope should be the Pope; well this story explores that. The Pope is newly elected. He is scared to death of the responsibilities of the job and terrified that he can't do it...and so, runs away. The others that elected him can not leave until a Pope is presented to the people...but they can't find him, and don't know that he ran away because he is afraid he can't do the job...because this is hidden from them. A psychologist is brought in, when he does come back...but he can not ask the questions he needs to because the ""Pope"" can not be interviewed without witnesses present. So since he can't do HIS job, he wants to leave...but he can't...because it can't be known that the Pope is scared out of his mind.

4709548,5,B005IKZSYA,"This movie might seem superficial in the depiction of the Catholic Church, its policies, and its authorities. However, it is neither about the religion institution nor about a crisis of faith (at least not completely since there are some thoughtful and funny moments); it rather shows the human struggle to great challenges...it happens to be embodied in a guy that just became Pope. Instead of representing an intricate plot, Moretti chose to portray the fallen facade of a human being and his attempt to find himself; but his endeavor is truncated by the ""theatrum mundi"" in which people are unable to exert control over their own lives. Thus, the open ending is distressing to viewers: it does not provide answers but questions. This movie is not about what it would happen to a powerful institution if left with no representative of God on earth but what happens when a human being chooses to not follow the game of representation. On the other hand, the apparent disconnected subplot of the psychiatrist, the Cardinals and the game, offers an exact account on how humans prefer to to look away in order to keep the order of things. Finally, leading actor Michel Piccoli offers a marvelous performance!",1400630400,,1206,4.916666666666667

4709550,4,B005IKZSYA,"This film reminded me of the 1985  movie, Saving Grace, in which Tom Conti plays a young pope who sneaks out of the Vatican, has an incognito adventure which restores his faith, and then returns to re-assume his papacy. A much more earnest film than the one here. We Have A Pope is as funny as it is moving. In the hands of director Nanni Moretti, Michel Piccoli manages to convey the tortured soul of a life missed without resorting to easy melodrama. Instead, we see a simple man who, in the end, knows himself better than what the world keeps telling him he has to be. And of course, with that wisdom comes a good deal of pain and sacrifice. Nanni Moretti couldn't have known how prescient this charming movie would be, considering that not even two years later, the then Pope Benedict would shock the world with his abruptly announced resignation.  Did he see this movie, I wonder?",1396569600,2,885,4.525
4709551,3,B005IKZSYA,"The movie presents a powerful look at the job of Pope, and how a newly elected Pope struggles to come to terms with the magnitude of the job, what will be expected of him, and of his desire to remain a simple priest, albeit a cardinal.

The movie could have offered so much, and in many ways it still does, but I would rather have had an ending that had the new Pope accept his role with the help of God than run away from it. I realize not everyone will see it this way, but a different ending would have been a powerful example of how we process the difficulties we can face in the journey of faith.

It sounds like it could be a drama or a comedy and in fact it is a bit of both, yet both aspects of the movie are subtle.  The humor is soft and understated, the drama is subtle with excellent acting from the lead character.  Being Italian, many the ins and outs and processes of Vatican life are revealed and the whole situation is handled with tact and compassion.  Wondering how they will resolve the issues keeps you guessing until the end.  Very good DVD.",1376784000,,534,4.3

4709566,4,B005IKZSYA,"Even though I am not Catholic, seeing all the Cardinals as they would have gathered to elect a Pope is awe-inspiring. The actors who play the Cardinals are great character actors that demonstrate the different nationalities and personalities of these august figures. Imagining what they might actually be thinking about taking on such a monumental role is hysterical. The gentleness and spiritual maturity of the one who gets the short straw, contrasting his complete terror is poignant. The Italian with subtitles makes this a little slower for an English speaking audience but more realistic also. I enjoyed it!",1373587200,,613,5.26530612244898
4709567,4,B005IKZSYA,"Although made several years before the recent papal election, this movie seems especially timely this year, and makes one wonder if other popes have been elected against their will. Rather than the rollicking fun and satire of most of Nanni Moretti's films, a more gentle humor and poignancy prevail here, as when the unwilling new pope says to an unsuspecting psychiatrist, ""I'm an actor."" The movie seems about 15 minutes too long, which could be remedied by drastically cutting the substory of the theater and real actors.",1369353600,,525,5.045977011494253
4709568,4,B005IKZSYA,"First of all, the details were excellent.  Unlike other movies/TV that gets the details of the vesture and ceremonies of the Catholic Church wrong, these people did their homework.

4709569,3,B005IKZSYA,"Disappointed that the best scenes are in the trailer.  The story seemed to veer all,over and never explain Cardinal Melville's issue.  And the volleyball game, cute but how was it relevant to the story?",1366156800,,202,4.911764705882353

4709574,5,B005IKZSYA,Saw this movie at a film festival and chose to watch it again.  What does it feel like to be elected Pope?  This movie takes you down that path.  I recommend it!,1363219200,,161,3.96875
4709575,5,B005IKZSYA,"Recently, I coached my 10-year-old granddaughter, Emelia, on the value of doing a pro and con list when making decisions.  I gave her a template with two columns: five reasons for Plan A and five reasons for Plan B.  After a few minutes of fourth grade discernment, she presented her work:
--Plan A had five excellent reasons in favor.
--Plan B had just five words: None, None, None, None, None!

I chuckled and thought, ""Memo to Self: Read another book on coaching!""

So with Plan A and Plan B fresh in my mind, I treated myself this weekend to a second viewing of this wonderful film, We Have a Pope (Habemus Papam).  My wife and I first enjoyed it at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2011 (Italian, with English sub-titles).

If you view it this week (March 11-15, 2013), you get a twofer: 1) an entertaining film (1 hour and 45 minutes) with a tongue-in-check, inside-the-Sistine-Chapel look at the selection of a pope, and 2) comparisons to the real life conclave in Vatican City this week.

No spoiler alert is needed because I'll just set the stage for you.  The papal conclave is in session--and balloting has begun.  The thunderous murmuring from dozens of cardinals needs no sub-titles: ""Not me, Lord! Not me!"" No one wants the job.

Finally, a pope is selected--and that's when the fun and the soul-searching begin. The reluctant leader is not sure he wants to be pope. (Plan A or Plan B?) He is unprepared, he thinks, for this one-in-a-billion leadership challenge--and the cardinals (still locked in the Vatican, without cell phones) are not much help to their new leader. Yet he had their votes. Hmmm. Plan A or Plan B?

It's a humorous, but eye-opening study in leadership trauma.  It's the perfect video to watch this week--as we watch Rome. Enjoy!

By the way, I recently reviewed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pope-The-CEO-John-Paul-II-s-Leadership-Lessons-to-a-Young-Swiss-Guard/dp/1931018766/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pope & The CEO: John Paul II's Leadership Lessons to a Young Swiss Guard</a>, by Andreas Widmer.

4709576,5,B005IKZSYA,"One wonders if Moretti knew something the rest of us didn't when he wrote this movie. Growing up in Rome he surely knew that Pope John XXIII used to slip the Swiss Guards and walk around Rome incognito. He was very possibly aware that it would be next to impossible to fill the shoes of a rock star Pope Like John Paul II.

I believe Moretti has unintentionally managed to give us a prophetic, affectionate, and endearing glimpse into what Pope Benedict might have struggled with as he realized his decision.  The Church needs to face tremendous issues in an ever complex world where more than a billion people look to one man to show them how to live their lives.  It's no wonder the modest, introverted and, yes, aging Benedict found the task more than anyone could ask of him.

Exceptional movie well worth seeing.",1362960000,,817,4.575342465753424
4709577,5,B005IKZSYA,"Wonderful movie - charming and sweet.  Numerous funny moments (the conclave voting, the cardinals' volleyball tournament, and the Swiss Guardsman who impersonates the pope.)

4709578,2,B005IKZSYA,"I wanted to love this movie, really I did, but, the ending was AWFUL.  Just because one person decides he cannot do the job does not mean the end of the world, figuratively speaking.  I kept thinking about what is said when English royalty dies-- ""the king (queen) is dead; long live the king (queen).""  The Church goes on regardless of any one person.

This is one time when I really wish I had heeded the other reviews instead of going with my hopes that this movie would be all it could be.  I gave it two stars because there WERE some cute scenes and the trailer was good.  All the sub-story lines just kind of wandered around into oblivion though and the ending was so depressing.

I liked writer/director Morretti's earlier film ""La Messa `e Finita"" (""The Mass is Ended"") about a young priest's struggle with staying or leaving the priesthood perhaps even better.  In the earlier film, the reasons why the priest was wondering whether he should leave the priesthood were _none_ of the typical ones discussed here in the United States.  Instead, it was simply: ""Would anyone really miss me if I was gone?""  A similar question underlies Habemus Papam as well even if it plays out on a larger stage.",1360540800,2,754,4.913385826771654

However, amazing as this movie's timing is, there are plenty of other good reasons to enjoy it, starting with Michel Piccoli's career-best performance. Nanni Moretti does his usual great work as actor and director.

4709584,5,B005IKZSYA,"This movie is about decisions and choices. What happens when everything you ever wanted is offered to you?Most of us would accept it. What happens if you know within your heart that you are not the one?  Would you be willing to stand as a minority of one to say, ""I'm not up to it.""  It can be a moment when we face a fork in the road.  A moment when we know no matter what our choice is, we will never be the same again.  That is the question that ""We Have a Pope"" keeps asking. It holds a mirror to our own souls.

This movie begins in the conclave of cardinals to choose a new pope.  The cardinals are in a deadlock.
Again and again, they try to arrive at consensus.  They can't. They choose a compromise candidate instead.  The new Pope is aging, very kind, and bemused by it all. When he learns the news of his elevation, he screams and passes out.  Against all urging, he knows that he is not the one to be Pope. Its not stage fright but his deep personal conviction.  What does he do? He slips out of the conclave and onto the streets of Rome.  He encounters people of all kinds.  He asks himself is he one to be Pope? Or would he rather have a simpler life?

This is a gentle, spiritual, and humorous movie. Its most amusing moments as the church officials try to explain the absence of the new pope. Its most touching moments are as the new Pope discovers his path.

But is makes its point: all of us need to follow the journey to find our true selves.  If you are a Christian, it means finding your soul.  Alan Minarcik",1357862400,9,1529,4.132203389830509
4709585,3,B005IKZSYA,"As a kid in Catholic high school about 50 years ago I was surprised to hear my most-admired priest say that he had been called upon to speak at a meeting where he hadn't expected it, in front of the bishop and other big wigs and he panicked.  But he remembered Luke 6:38, ""Give and it shall be given unto you"", and decided to open his mouth and see what would come out.  Cardinal Melville as the unwilling pope-elect could have done the same and made it a much better movie.  It's just hard to believe that a professional church man could invest decades of service and then fumble when it counted most.  I'm wondering, what is it?  Has he been diagnosed with cancer which he is hiding or some other dark secret ... some explanation.  To take my time and money and then not deliver any reason at all made this a very disappointing movie.

From this moment on the film loses its way very badly. The main challenge is that we know nothing about the new Pope and don't really care about him. The Vatican calls in a leading psychologist to examine the reluctant Pope-to-be and he decides to spice things up by arranging a volleyball tournament between the various cardinals. The director then decides he is Fellini and the film makes less and less sense as we progress tortuously towards the end. This was a big missed opportunity.",1356480000,4,721,4.511450381679389

There is a strong farcical element, however, that takes up too much viewing time and detracts from the seriousness of the story--namely a wacky psychoanalyst organizing a volleyball tournament for the Cardinals.  Otherwise, this film is pretty unique and provides some useful philosophical food for thought.",1349740800,9,430,5.402985074626866
4709593,1,B005IKZSYA,"An alledge comedy about a serious topic depending on someone's religious affiliations.
In my case it was about an elected Pope who turns out to be morally and emotionally weak.
He is unable to fulfill an enormous responsibility bestowed on him by his colleagues.
After viewing this movie,it left me in shock unable to fathom how a loser was even elected.
A feel bad movie,I could not recommend it.",1349481600,3,397,4.768115942028985

4709596,5,B005IKZSYA,"I was highly impressed with this gem of a film, one that obviously understood the beauty of a subtle and meaningful approach to a controversial subject without shying away from inserting needed moments of humor and charm.  Tackling the idea of doubt, insecurity and wavering faith, `We Have a Pope' addresses a concern that may not be thought of very often but one that deserves our attention.  By centering the affair on a newly elected Pope who feels inadequate and quite frankly overwhelmed by the assignment bestowed on him by God, `We Have a Pope' adds a serious depth to the age-old topic of personal spirituality.  With a blisteringly authentic performance by Michael Piccoli, this beautiful film moves with grace and highlights emotional assertions that one cannot help but feel akin to.  Piccoli should be up for Oscar consideration, but that won't happen.  The way he balances out this conflicted man's fears and enchantments is astonishing to watch.  Such a soulful performance, one imbued with sharp passion and integrity.  At the end of the day, `We Have a Pope' never backs away or exposes a lazy or easy out but instead rounds out to a moment of responsibility that shines bright despite the crushing reality of the decision made (crushing on most, but freeing for one).  It is a beautiful film that remains provoking while wholly entertaining; something most films strive to be but fail miserably to become.",1348012800,23,1423,4.949579831932773
4709597,3,B005IKZSYA,"""Habemus Papam"" (""We Have a Pope"") is an Italian comedy drama directed by Nanni Moretti (""The Son's Room""). Michel Piccoli plays Cardinal Melville, who, after being elected Pope, insists that he cannot take the office and flees the conclave. The story may remind you of a William Wyler classic, but the intriguing premise is less effectively used here.

The director's bold attempt to portray a pope as a human is a worthy one, but his approach is tame at best. Michel Piccoli is wonderful as Cardinal Melville, but even the veteran player like Piccoli cannot make the character of Cardinal Melville credible, because the unfocused script fails to delve into his personality as deeply as it should. His interactions with people in Rome do not reveal much about the person for which the film is made. The reference to a stage drama (Chekhov ... what else?) is too obvious. After all, we are all actors.

Moretti himself plays a psychiatrist, who is called in to talk to the newly elected pope (while other cardinals are watching). The nicely understated comic scene is pretty funny, but his character overstays its welcome and becomes a little annoying when he starts organizing a volleyball tournament for the cardinals. This subplot adds nothing to the film's intriguing theme.

I think there is nothing that would offend the viewers. Not one person is described in a negative light. I respect Moretti's decision to tell the story in this way, but maybe he went too far. Despite the interesting idea, the film's narrative lacks the emotion and tension between the characters, most of whom look one-dimensional. How would other cardinals feel and react (when we know through their voiceovers that most of them, like Cardinal Melville, did not want to be elected), for instance? You will not know.

This is a big problem with the film because here we see possibilities for a more dramatic storyline, which Moretti seems to ignore. ""We Have a Pope"" is most effective when it shows the subtle performances from Michel Piccoli. It is regrettable that they didn't come up with a better story to tell for his character.",1343865600,11,2113,4.893854748603352
4709598,3,B005IKZSYA,"When Cardinal Melville unexpectedly finds himself elected Pope, he panics, literally running away screaming from the papal balcony and his first benediction of the faithful. This situation might have set up a comic restoration of the pope to his nerve, or a satirical look at church politics. It does neither. Though sumptuously filmed and well-acted, the film finds itself wandering among various plot threads, none of which is thoroughly explored or exploited. Why did the pope run away? There are hints of hysterical memory loss, the unresolved matter of a sister turned actress, and perhaps a sense of his inner unworthiness. But nothing comes of these hints.  The psychoanalyst brought in to treat the pontiff is secular, but little is made of his role, other than a long scene in which he organizes the cardinals (locked in the Vatican until the pope recovers) in a round robin volleyball tournament. The film's sudden and baffling ending left many viewers unsatisfied.

If there is any action in the movie at all, it is at a subtle and symbolic level. The shrink (played by director Nanni Moretti) is a member of a Freudian priesthood that runs counter to that of the church. Psychoanalysis has at least as many certain and unassailable ""answers"" as the church, and there might be some point in setting these institutions against each other. The volleyball game has a touch of church geopolitics about it. The cardinals are teamed by continent, each wearing colored markers similar to priestly chasubles. The analyst's organizing the teams then becomes a stand-in for the way the Vatican organizes the church's worldwide leadership. But if there was a point to be made, it was lost on me. The pope's dalliance with an acting troupe showed him as a sentimental thespian manqu. But otherwise, his association with the troupe was wasted.

""We Have A Pope"" is teeming with such unfulfilled promises. Michel Piccoli is frail, human and bewildered in the role of the pope. But his character does little more than wander aimlessly, meandering through the streets of Rome with no purpose, no goal and no final destination. Like this film. A sad waste of talent.",1338422400,2,2160,4.977839335180056
4709599,4,B005IKZSYA,"When I was watching this, I thought it was a true story, so I was confused who it was. It is a fiction, but it is not an impossible fiction.

*** Spoilers alert,  this review does contain spoilers.

The Cardinals come together to elect a new pope. I liked very much the scene where they came together to decide. It was clear that several did not want the job and as it happened the person they pick does not want to be pope. He goes through many emotional traumas, so they get a psychiatrist to help him, but their pope run away. The pope goes through some escapades, until the pope finally decides to refuse the job which he does publicly.

The story was good, but I think it could have been better. The psychiatrist interaction with the pope could have been much longer and more interesting. More could have been done with the Cardinals. As it was when the pope ran away much of it was a let down.

Still, the story was original with some good twists. I thought some of the characters were interesting but much more could have been done here.

Would I see it again, probably not as I know the story, but I would recommend it.",1326067200,2,1127,4.2924528301886795
