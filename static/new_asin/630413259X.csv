7864948,1,630413259X,"I reviewed this once, and my previous review is no longer listed.  The part of this video where David slays Goliath is quite graphic.  Bright red blood actually spurts out of his head as he is falling.  I watched it once, and then got rid of it.  I thought that part of it could have been handled differently.",1097020800,,309,4.275862068965517
7864949,5,630413259X,"I felt like The Beginners Bible's Movie on The Story of David and Goliath was very true and went with the Bible. I am a Sunday School teacher and I have shown many of these movies to the children I teach and they have all loved them and learned form them. And that is the main reason I was so happy with the Movie of The Story of David and Goliath. And right now my church is making a skit about the story of David and Goliath, and the people who are going to be init watched my tape. So I thought that was pretty neat. But if you have any doubts about it then I would go to my Pastor and ask him about it.",1095379200,,606,3.8174603174603177
7864950,4,630413259X,"This is our family's favorite in the Beginner's Bible video series, especially because of the song David sings, ""I've Got a Giant of a God  with Me."" The Bible story is told well and the song really brings  across the message that God is bigger than any problem we face.",965001600,6,270,4.38
