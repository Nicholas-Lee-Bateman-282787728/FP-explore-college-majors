8096195,5,B000C6NPGS,"Great info for the small scale gardening. I had fun trying the
tips and tricks in this DVD. Gives the new gardener a good perspective
to start from. But, if you have plants like corn that hold lots of
water in the leaves next to the stalk. They may not react well to
the tobacco juice. Treat them separatly and make sure you don't over
do it. I loved this DVD and Jerry Baker keeps your attention.
I still review it now and again.",1246147200,7,430,4.130952380952381
