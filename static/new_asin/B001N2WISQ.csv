3709281,5,B001N2WISQ,"I'm a huge fan of Jillian's and have done several of her Biggest Winner workouts as well as 30 Day Shred.  I consider myself an intermediate exerciser, and this workout was TOUGH!  She hits every major muscle group in combination of classic moves and creative compound exercises, and REALLY burns each muscle to the point of exhaustion.  Some of the moves are just plain sadistic!  But effective!  My hands are shaking right now as I try to lift my water glass, lol.  I couldn't make it all the way through the whole DVD without taking a few breaks on my first try, but I'm the type of person who is inspired by a challenge; if I can make it all the way through on my first try, it's too easy.  This one is NOT EASY by anyone's standards and I will be coming back to it again and again!

Having done Jillian's workouts, it's great to see how she has matured and evolved as a teacher/trainer.  These circuits are set up to exhaust each muscle group just enough and then move on; just when you think you're about to die it's time for the next exercise.  Never gets boring!  She gives good tips on form, makes some nice motivational points, and even cracks a few jokes.  She's still got that brutal Jillian style but seems like she's having fun this time around, which makes her fun to work out with.  I LOVE this dvd, definitely a new favorite!!!

If you like to challenge yourself, you'll love it too.  Treat yourself!  You're worth it!",1234137600,32,1435,4.399239543726236
3709282,5,B001N2WISQ,"I did this DVD on Saturday morning and it definitely kicked my butt like ""Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism"". I highly recommend both of these DVDs if you are serious about staying in shape.",1234137600,4,185,4.636363636363637
3709283,5,B001N2WISQ,"I own all of Jillian's DVDs, so when this one and it's companion DVD came out, I ordered them immediately.

This one is like ""Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism"" but the circuits are weights based. At about an hour long, she has you run through 5 exercises 2 times a circuit and most are with weights in hand. Towards the middle, she does matwork for the abs (some with weights!) and in the last circuit she does old school matwork for legs and glutes.

This kicked my butt in a good way. I was sweaty and tired at the end. I completed it, but having to modify some exercises, so now I have something to work towards.

Having owned so many of Jillian's DVDs, I was worried she would use the same exercises over and over but she keeps it really fresh! She has a lot of exercises I have never seen or done before and all I can say is WOW! She does this exercise called ""The Surrender"" Oh. My. Goodness. It is super hard and I had to stop. It's also a little hard on the knees. Again, one of the ones I have to work towards.

I can definitely see this DVD transforming your body and making you more and more toned. A great workout and so worth it!",1234051200,241,1138,4.135746606334842
3709284,5,B001N2WISQ,"This is a tough workout, but for those who know Jillian, it is to be expected. I did this workout twice and feel markedly stronger. I have been doing her ""30 Day Shred"" for two months and was getting bored, so I ordered this and found it to be just the boost I needed (I felt it the next mornings--a lot)! She pushes just hard enough and knows when to let you rest a bit. The proof is in the results-- I have had excellent ones. If you are serious about transformation, check out the DVD.",1233964800,28,488,4.09375
3709285,5,B001N2WISQ,I have done Jillian's Shred workout as well as the Biggest Loser workout and as always she challenges you. I did a shortened version of this workout On Demand and it was hard!  But not impossible.  jillian's workouts always are difficult but the moves are easy to master. I lose interest if I can't master a move. Although this was a toning workout I wore my HRM and my heart rate was up for most of the workout.  Worth 10 bucks!,1233792000,14,429,4.271604938271605
3709286,5,B001N2WISQ,"I am a huge fan of the Jillian Michael's approach to fitness. I used her Shred 30 program and lost 29 pounds in two months by doing the workouts and following the diet recommended on her website.  Let me start by saying I am not one of these people who just ""LOVES"" to workout. I do it because I need change. I tried this workout yesterday as it is available on Exercise TV/On Demand and I have to tell you, it was the most transformational exercise experience I have ever had. Jillian's coaching and motivational speak are reverberating in my head even now. For this workout you will need 3 to 5 pound weights and about an hour (trust me this hour is worth it).  She starts with 5 minute warm up that is cardio and dynamic stretching infused. SHe cools down with a yoga style static stretch that is just wonderful.  There are roughly (six) 7 minute segments in which you do about 5 powerful arm and leg focused or ab focused work. The intensity of the arm, ab and leg work basically guaranteed me that I am going to see the results I want to see over the next two months. I usually don't feel a burn in my glutes and hips which are a real trouble spot for me, did not have that problem this time.  Working out is not really my thing, as much as wanting results and knowing I have to do it in order to get it, but the strength and euphoria I felt after doing this workout is indescribable.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to believe in themselves and begin transforming themselves into the person they wish they were. This comes with the highest recommendation I can offer. I will post updates as I continue the program. GET THE DVD, its the least you could do for yourself.",1233792000,502,1680,4.287066246056782
3709287,5,B001N2WISQ,LOVE Jillian's videos! This one is a hefty 50 mins and a fantastic work out!,1518825600,,76,4.133333333333334

3709292,5,B001N2WISQ,I started this dvd along with the banish fat boost metabolism.  I've been alternating them around a month now. I have been running for 3 years and doing some other cardio as well. I'm 35 year old female and I work a full time job as well as raise 2 children. So time of coarse is an element to me working out. I've never been a gym person so i wanted to try something i can do at home. I can definitely see a difference in the toning of my body . I'm noticing that the scale may not be exactly what I want it to be but my body is looking better and more toned. I'm excited to see where I will be in a few more months with these . I plan to keep them up. It's definitely worth trying!,1511654400,,683,3.8098591549295775

3709296,5,B001N2WISQ,Good video. She is little weird in this video lol but it works well except i really hate lunges and she seems to really like them.

3709298,1,B001N2WISQ,"So it took me a while to actually open and use the cd. When I finally did open it up, I put it right in the player and I am able to play maybe 5 seconds of the cd. It starts, ""I'm Jillian Mic"" and the cd keeps skipping and repeating. She doesn't even get to finish her name let alone go into the workout. I took it out and examined the cd, cleaned it with a soft cloth and attempted to play it again with the same issue. Bummer. CD looks fine, just doesn't work.",1504051200,,462,3.8229166666666665

I used this video to cross-train during XC and track in high school and I definitely think it helped me get to state, because I was stronger upper-body wise.

It's a hard workout but extremely effective! I am an ectomorph meaning I am tall and thin and it has helped immensely chisel the fat and carve out definition.. but in all areas!!! Legs, stomach, ass, arms, shoulders! It's a full body workout!! One hour and I clap every time I am done along with them because it truly feels like an accomplishment, getting through her video! It's tough!! But- Best workout video EVER!!!",1493856000,2,568,4.8061224489795915
3709310,5,B001N2WISQ,"I have been using this DVD off and on for a few years. It's one of the best fitness videos from Jillian. I have almost all of her DVD's however this one is extra special to me because it helped me transform my body. If you use this workout consistently, you will look amazing in your clothes (and naked) and ppl will definately notice! Trust me! I use 5lb and 8lb weights now but I started with 3lbs. Start slow and work your way up to finishing the entire workout...you won't regret it and you'll look fabulous. At one point I was using this video four to five times a week and was almost too skinny! I had to fall back a bit because I still want some curves:o) You'll sweat like crazy and the fat just melts off...this is a winner!",1492214400,7,733,4.169014084507042
3709311,5,B001N2WISQ,"I really loved this workout. I have been doing 30-day shred and ripped-in-30 for several months now in conjunction with other cardio activities. I wanted to up the intensity of my workouts a bit, especially in regards to strength training and toning, and this video did the trick! For those familiar with JM, it is like her other videos with several rounds of circuits. However, these circuits are definitely more focused on strength training and compound moves. IE., there is very little cardio during the circuits. Instead, JM takes you through each trouble section of the body, combining lower body moves with arms.

I wound up buying this video while visiting my parents, and did most of the circuits using five-pound weights. I liked the video so much I also bought a copy for home. (However, at home, I will do the exercises with three-pound weights.) It got me sweaty, out-of-breath and was very challenging.

The only negative is that sometimes I think her moves are too complicated. But that would be my comment with JM overall. That sometimes, she chooses moves that are like  SPINNING-PLANKS-WITH-SIDE-KICKS-WHILE-HOLDING-WEIGHTS... and I feel like some of it is a bit unnecessary. I wonder if I could get the same benefit from an easier to accomplish move. Also, if you have knee problems (like me), many of the moves rely on lunging and squatting, etc... and needless to say, that can be a real pain. But otherwise, it's a great workout for those with an already decent fitness level looking to tone problem areas.",1491523200,,1527,4.888030888030888

Those DVDs are 25 and 35 minutes - this one is 55 minutes. In addition, rather than rotating between strength, aerobic, and abs, as her other DVDs do, here she has you toning the entire time, but at a rate fast enough that you're getting some aerobic in as well. Jillian does have some attitude, but she's enthusiastic and encouraging. The day after I did this routine the first few times it was hard to move; I had aches in places I hadn't known there were muscles. Which is exactly why I like it so much.",1468195200,2,632,4.410256410256411

3709377,5,B001N2WISQ,"Very good workout. I'd suggest not doing it week after week after week because it wears you down and for an hour long workout video, it gets lengthy! It definitely does the job BUT mixing in her other workout videos helps break up routine.",1467331200,,239,4.454545454545454

I felt like my muscles were constantly sore and aching (and not in a good way)... Maybe if I was doing it 3 times weekly, my muscles would at least have the chance to adapt a bit to the routine.  Every week it felt like I was starting over from scratch... I had to switch to a different workout, this one is just too much for my 51 year old body right now.... lol....",1467072000,2,542,3.7787610619469025

I attribute most of my weight loss, as well as the way my body transformed, to this video, which is by far my favorite of Jillian Michaels. People say it's not enough cardio...but,mid you're really giving it your all, the process of working both upper and lower body simultaneously will definitely get and keep your heart rate high.

Overall I think it's great. I consider myself in pretty good shape, but this routine definitely makes me work! I just did it the other day after having taken a 3 week break and I am really sore. The only complaint I have about the workout is that since I am a runner my legs are stronger than my arms and I feel like I'd prefer some more arm focused exercises. The workout itself is a bit longer than 45 minutes. I often do this on my lunch break, and usually have to skip one circuit to make sure I have time to shower and get dressed & back to work. I have this on both DVD and streaming through Amazon. I love the DVD because you can pick and choose the segment you want to, and can skip around. The streaming version is just one big video, which is annoying because I have to fast forward through circuits if I want to go on to the next one.

I bought this video along with her Banish Fat Boost Metabolism video after a friend recommended it and boy are these killer (in a good way).

3709454,5,B001N2WISQ,"Oh my.  This DVD is the real deal.  I consider myself an intermediate exerciser--and I absolutely love Jillian Michaels and Bob Harper.  It's very possible that the reason I had so much success with this DVD is because I'm in better shape than I have ever been before--very possible!  But out of all the DVDs I've ever done, this one gave me the most visual results I've ever seen.  My arms and shoulders and upper back have gained a lot of definition, my quads, my butt and my abs--oh, my abs!  I almost HAVE abs!!  Each set is difficult in its own way.  I've read some reviews that say that the first set is easy, but HA, try doing it with eight pounds weights and then tell me it's easy!  The first four sets, in my opinion, are incredibly difficult.  By the fifth set, I was usually pretty roughed up--but what I love about this DVD is that she really brings it down at the end.  I love that the last two exercises she does are donkey kicks and roundhouses--two quad/butt moves that really make me feel strong.  Jillian is great in this DVD--and the results I saw were amazing.  The first few times I did this DVD, my body was so sore in the best way--and with all my exercise experience, I sometimes struggle to get that sore ""I've really worked hard"" feeling.  I can't say enough good things about this DVD--if you want results, get it NOW!

One day when I went to put it on, it was no longer included in the free list. i had been using it often enough to justify purchasing it,  so I spent the10 dollars.  I learned the moves, and came up with my own routine,  selected from those in the video.  I no longer use the video,  but I do use the  moves i learned from from it almost every day.  I had never done any kind of exercise routine in my life and I have been at this for over a year now.  The tape  motivated me, inspired me,  and got me moving.  It's a really long hard physical work out and there are a couple of moves I still can't do.  But for me it's about moving and sticking with it.  This is the video that got me doing it.  I am much stronger and much more toned  and this video is the reason why.",1449878400,2,891,3.839779005524862

The thought of it being a longer dvd did put me off but I am glad I tried it.  It seems to fly by where as sometimes the others ones would drag.  I also have just started this one BUT feel that it leaves me with the perfect level of feeling like I have worked my ENTIRE body, something I didn't get with the other ones.  This one I am confident is gonna give me amazing results.  IF you are going to try one dvd I would say do this one!!! Yes she isn't as encouraging as in other dvds BUT with this one you only do the exercises twice and they are managable....so you also don't need it as much....",1447200000,,719,3.8904109589041096

This is my go-to workout, and also my arch nemesis. I hate to do it but love the results and love how I feel afterwards! Even as I get more and more in shape, I still find this workout to be a killer. Jillian explains proper form and of course gives modifications to make the exercises easier or harder. I have done this workout so many times I can quote every line, but it is still my favorite. No other Jillian workout tops this one, and I have done almost all of her workouts!

I have never ached this much after shred. I'm a runner and need some cross-training and this is just the ticket.

Her combination moves are really smart and effective, and I think this is an excellent all body workout. If you have problematic joints, you may need to modify either by skipping certain chapters or doing only a portion of the workout. I have an ankle that has been surgically fused and high impact work is off limits for me. I didn't think of this workout as particularly ""high impact, "" but after doing it for a while, my ankle began to throb in pain. So unfortunately I now have limited myself to doing the ab workouts, the mat workout at the end and 1-2 of the weights workouts.",1444608000,,704,4.3007518796992485
3709465,5,B001N2WISQ,"Fantastic workout. I have been hesitant to try much other than P90X (of which I am a huge fan and have lost nearly 100 pounds doing) but after a year of the same routine I decided to give a few of Jillian's workouts a try. I literally just finished this one for the first time and it was fun, quick, and full of movements that have my muscles aching. I LOVE this workout. Obviously, I can't possibly have ""results"" yet, but I feel fantastic and can tell this one delivers. I can't wait to try her other DVDs!!!

Update: I have had this a couple weeks and still love it. I've read a handful of reviews claiming injury, particularly to the knees. I have a tip for this and also the 30 Day Shred routines: work with your body, not against it. If you feel tweaky, or the pace is too much, MODIFY IT. There is no point scrambling to keep up or doing deep repetitive lunges if you will injure yourself. Take your time and keep good form. That's what I love about Tony Horton of P90X; so motivational, and he always always always offers a modified move. Jillian is fun and intense, but keep in mind that stressing your body is the goal; but too much stress will lead to injury. No one has to lose 30 pounds in 8 weeks. Two pounds (at most!) a week is fantastic, and a much more realistic goal and easier to keep off long term. Keep at it and take care of your body as you go. Work with what you have and you will gradually build strength and endurance and minimize risk of injury. Cheers! :)",1444348800,16,1484,4.188811188811189

I feel this exact same way about her other videos I've tried; for me, they're just too much. I'm sure these videos are amazing for certain people, but I'm just not one of them.

I have used Jillian's 20 minute shred and her killer abs videos. Unlike those videos where she has higher levels that you can work up to this video does not have that. That is the only criticism that I have. Although in this video, she does give tips to either make certain exercises easier for beginners or how to  advance it for more of a challenge (but, again, only on certain moves). But I have been using this video for about 2 1/2 months, 5 days a  week, and it doesn't really matter to me that much that the video doesn't include higher levels. It is still kicking my butt. The video does have the option to only play circuits individually too if you want to target and personalize your workout more. I would recommend this video. I also like that you only need to invest in 3 lb weights. At first I thought 3 lb weights? I can do more, surely. But after the whole workout you will be glad it is just 3 lbs!

Surprisingly, it is totally manageable. The first 2 or 3 circus are harder for me since they involved a lot of weight training. But coming to core training and floor exercises, I can finish them relatively easily except for push-ups. I think my flexibility helps me a lot.

I don't bring this up to brag, but to tell those out there who are similarly blessed how awesome this workout is even when you start out with a low fat content.

The first time I began the workout I could't finish it, and the first three times I actually started dry-heaving :( Thin I may be, but in shape I am certainly not. After that I wouldn't say it got easier, but I wasn't struggling. Run time is an hour, but give yourself an extra 15 minutes to properly stretch. She does a warm up, but doesn't stretch first (and this is absolutely necessary!). You'll need a yoga or work out mat, and a pair of 3lb weights. She does circuit training with no breaks- it keeps the heart rate up and makes every movement you make count. Planks, pushups, weights, dead lifts, squats, crunches, mat-work- all the stuff that suuuucks and makes your body look super hot. I call this my ""look good naked workout"".

I only work out once to twice a week with this program, but I would say even after the first month I began to notice results. My butt was tighter, and slowly but surely the cellulite I had begun to get is disappearing. My abs starting getting results around the Spring. By far the biggest difference is in my arms- they are looking REALLY nice. Great muscular definition. I know if I worked out more often I'd be seeing even greater results, but I am rather lazy and committing over an hour is really a big deal to me. But you honestly don't need to do this every day if you have a hill to climb instead of a mountain. I am VERY impressed with my results even putting in the bare minimum of effort ;)",1436227200,5,1777,4.3014925373134325

I love how she works two muscle groups at the same time. This old skool Jillian is the one to get because I find her newer ones cheesy,  maybe she's gotten a big head since this dvd.

Its short enough that I can finish and shower and have a protein bar while my kids nap but hits all body parts and is intense enough to make you sore. As she says in this dvd, this workout is no joke. If you want a real workout this is it. You can always make it harder down the road by increasing weight.

3709513,3,B001N2WISQ,"I have had this video for years and it has been awhile since I last followed along. I am not really a ""fan"" of Jillian as a personal trainer, but after using the 30 Day Shred, I realized that I like the 3-2-1 style. Unfortunately, this video does not follow that method since it is more for toning.
I am currently using this dvd to add strength training to my running routine. I am only giving this dvd 3 stars because Jillian does not clearly state what the exercises are nor does she explain how to do them. In circuit 3, she says to do alternating back lunges, so I alternate each leg as I do a backward lunge. Then after about 12 reps, she says, ""now let's do the other leg."" Since I often do not look at the screen but just listen to the what is said, I do not see that everyone in the video is doing one side at a time. So frustrating. She even calls the side lunge ""alternating"" lunge.

I am forgiving of that and made a note on my cover to do lunges on one side at a time. Overall, I think this is a good workout and I am breathing heavily and sweat is dropping down from my forehead by the time I am on circuit 5. I alternate between 3 and 5 pounds weights because I have some shoulder issues and I do not want to hurt myself. I would highly recommend doing research on how to do these exercises properly because you won't get much information on correct form on this one.

Jillian is one of the few trainers that I can actually follow along, so many other trainers have so many steps that resemble a dance rather than exercise and Jillian's workouts have a good structure that I can follow without feeling clumsy. For that reason I like some of her dvd's; I stopped buying them after I purchased this one because of the lack of clear instruction.",1432512000,,1756,4.176991150442478

3709518,5,B001N2WISQ,"I love Jillian. This is a 45 minute workout, which is longer than her Shred DVDs.  Unlike the Shred DVD, she doesn't incorporate cardio in between circuits, which is why I got this. I have Shred and I don't love the 3-2-1 formula w/cardio as much as I love this DVD. She's very thorough and covers all the areas that need attention. I can tell my thighs are tightening up and so are my arms. I do this along with intervals on my treadmill and it's enough for me. I do this DVD about 3 times a week.",1431129600,4,498,4.081632653061225

I think part of it is making sure you follow good form and wearing a brace if you have weakness. I wore a brace on my ankle, which was weak from an old stress fracture, until it got used to my exercise routine and got stronger. Overall, great video.",1429401600,,553,4.595959595959596

3709526,5,B001N2WISQ,"Wow! Jillian has mastered the whole body workout with this one. As I write this, it's been two days since I did the workout for the first time and I am still sore. It's mostly strength exercises, but it definitely gets the heart rate up. I needed to pause several times for a quick break and drink of water. I love the circuit concept because I get bored easily. So changing the movement every few seconds keeps it interesting. And working two (or more) body parts at the same time maximizes what you can accomplish in only 40 minutes. And unlike most workout DVDs, Jillian's commentary is great. I usually mute the commentary after I've heard it about 3 times but Jillian not only explains the moves and tells you what to do next, she encourages and motivates you to keep going and try your best even if you have to modify the moves. I've collected a lot of workout DVDs over the years and this is my new favorite.",1428537600,,915,4.3882352941176475

I have only had it for two weeks, but I know this is going to get me to where I wanted to be.  I am looking to drop 5-10 pounds, but more spec., I want my flat belly back. I have not doubt this will do the trick.  If you are in shape, but haven't worked out in a while, I suggest not doing 100% of each rep.  Maybe stop 2-3 reps early for the first and second time you do this.  If you are inexperienced, I recommend you only do half of what she is telling you to do for the first two times, you will be SO sore if you don't.  It is very intense, but in a good way!!

Just a heads up, it is a non-stop circuit DVD.  She goes through 7 circuit's (two rounds of each set in each circuit) and does NOT stop, there are zero breaks. You will get a great work out which will very much include cardio!",1428537600,7,1098,3.689655172413793

3709547,5,B001N2WISQ,"30 Day Shred is the first of about a million workout dvds I've tried to actually get visible results for me. I love it, but I had been searching for something a little bit longer.  I've tried others of her videos, but I couldn't stick with them - I didn't like them as much as 30DS.  I read a review that mentioned this video as a close second favorite to 30DS so I gave it a try. I've only done it twice, but so far, I really like it.  I am sore in my ""trouble zones"" - tush, hips, saddle bags, abs, upper back. The moves are simple, if you've done her videos before, and there is only one set of alternating side lunges (which I hate) with a bicep curl- the rest (and there are several) she does one leg at a time - you're still going from standing to the lunge position, but you're doing one leg at a time instead of alternating. I'm sure alternating is much better cardio, but I feel like doing one leg at a time gives me a better opportunity to really focus on form and targeting the muscle/s. I also don't lose my balance and miss a rep or two.
This video is less intense that 30DS, but because it's longer, I still feel like I'm getting a great workout. There are more exercises but fewer reps in the circuits than in 30DS and no cardio intervals so my heart rate doesn't stay as elevated, but I do feel like more of my body is getting strength training. As I said, the moves are pretty simple (if you've done other JM videos) so you're getting targeting training from multiple angles to fatigue your muscles. I especially like the targeted abs/glutes circuits. Some reviews have mentioned that there is too much emphasis on abs, but that's definitely one of my trouble zones, so I expected and appreciate that.
I've also read that this video isn't challenging for some. For reference, I am a mother of two, and about 50% jiggly. ;) I'm 5'6"" and 153lbs. I try to workout 5 days a week when I'm consistent (and then I go down to 40% jiggly or so), but about once or twice a year, I'll go one or two months without working out and all the jiggles come back. I consider myself to be pretty strong, in terms of lifting things, but I'm not supertoned...or toned at all really. Ha! I still have to do push-ups on my knees, for example. I can finish most of the reps on most of the circuits. I use 3lb weights, except for the bicep/glutes circuit when I use 5lbs.",1423785600,6,2363,4.2234513274336285

As you may have noticed from my other reviews, I have a total of four JM DVDs. I have been using them in a rotation.

NMTZ is definitely one for every other day use. Your muscles will need a day off in between. I'm not going to break down the circuits.  Someone else has already done that, but I will say that if you stick with this for a few weeks, you WILL see results!",1414195200,3,627,4.131147540983607

3709595,5,B001N2WISQ,"I also own Jillian's ""Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism"" DVD, and when used with ""No More Trouble Zones,"" I'm feeling better than ever. I alternate between the two, exercising for 45-50 minutes a day, four days a week. In that time I can complete 5 workouts from ""Banish Fat"" and 6 workouts from ""No More Trouble Zones."" This DVD will get you lean in no time if you stick with it and keep pushing yourself to use higher weights.

Unlike ""Banish Fat,"" however, there are no modifications for beginners in standing exercises with the hand weights other than, well, to use a lighter set of weights. They use 3 lb. weights in the video, but you could use anywhere from 1 lb. to 8 lbs. I've been using this DVD for a little more than two months, and I've worked my way to 5 lb. weights (up from 3 lbs.--I have little shoulder and arm strength to begin with). My goal is to get to 8 lbs.

There are considerably more modifications for beginners with the exercises done on the mat, though, which is nice. There is only one set of mat exercises in ""Banish Fat,"" but ""No More Trouble Zones"" has four. You begin your workout with a a standing work out, then do mat work, then have two more sets of standing exercises, and finish with three more sets of mat work.

Just keep in mind that when doing weighted exercises, it's better to either do them every other day. Your muscles need the extra time to heal. Doing various aerobic exercises on the days in between will help keep you from getting too stiff.",1414022400,4,1489,4.38768115942029

3709603,5,B001N2WISQ,"This is probably my favorite workout dvd and there is nobody I would rather have than Jillian Michaels training me. She does a great job of keeping me motivated because I'm not one to willingly work out. She even throws in a couple jokes to make you giggle. I'm more of a beginner to working out and that's why I enjoy this dvd so much. Jillian does a great job at explaining each move and for those who are just starting out she shows modifications that you can do to make it a little easier on yourself. On the other hand if you are more advanced she has modifications for that too. In total the workout is about 50 minutes long and consists of a warm up, cool down, and 6 circuits that last about 6 minutes each. The circuits all have 5 exercises that are supposed to be done for 30 seconds each and then repeated after the last exercise in the bunch. All the circuits focus on toning a certain area of your body while burning calories. There is also an option that I like where if I don't have time to do the full workout I can just pick one circuit to do, which for me is usually my core area. You will need dumbbells for a few of these exercises (I would go with either 3 or 5 lbs ones)  the ones I bought were&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tone-Fitness-Hourglass-Shaped-Dumbbells/dp/B005IRWWGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tone Fitness Hourglass Shaped Dumbbells</a>. These are great for me because they are surrounded by rubber and don't cramp up my hands like the ones that are all metal that my husband uses and they don't slip out of my hands either. She also uses a mat, but since I don't have one I am fine with just doing the exercises on my carpet. I'm sure many of you, like I was, are curious of the exercises she uses in each circuit so I will try and write down as many as I can remember for you.

The initial warmup of this dvd is the easiest part for me. There is some jump roping, arm circles, jumping jacks, and marching in place.

The first circuit focuses on toning the shoulders and legs. Some of the exercises she uses in this are squatting,lunging, and press outs. I find this circuit to be easier than the others, but I am sure we all have different opinions. Moving onto the next circuit you will find that it focuses on your chest and abs. A few of the exercises in this circuit are chest presses, bicycle crunches, push ups, and a few others in which I cannot remember the name of. When I first started this program I would often find myself running out of energy after this circuit because I found it to be pretty difficult. Once I gained some energy back I would proceed with circuit 3 which consists of targeting your biceps and butt. This circuit mainly focuses on different types of lunges with curls. The fourth circuit aims to target thighs and triceps and has exercises ranging from chair poses with tricep kickbacks to surrenders. The last 3 circuits all have targeting the core involved. The first is focusing on the core alone by doing crunches, different types of planks, and windshield wipers. Then you move onto the upper body and core and do some supermans, scissor kicks, and pelvic thrusts. After that to finish off the workout it focuses on lower body and core with some side planks, donkey kicks, and leg raises. Finally at the end you get to cool down with some yoga after all that hard work, which of course is my favorite part.

I was using this dvd everyday and on days when I didn't have enough time to do the full 50 minute workout I would just do 1 or 2 circuits. With this dvd's workout alone was averaging a 1-2 lb weight loss per week and was seeing some changes mainly in my core area. It is challenging and depending on your level of fitness it will most likely make you break a sweat. I've been doing this for about 3 months and the first few weeks were a real hassle for me because I continually ran out of energy and felt like it was hard to keep up. I looked into a few different products that would help with keeping my energy up and help me to burn fat faster. I began using&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/T5-RXD-Clinical-Strength-Thermogenic-Fat-Reduction-Formula-Highly-Concentrated-T5-Weight-Loss-Fat-Burning-Supplement-90-Capsules-1-bottle/dp/B00MXAIHSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">T5 RXD - Clinical Strength Thermogenic Fat-Reduction Formula. Highly Concentrated T5 Weight Loss, Fat Burning Supplement (90 Capsules) (1 bottle)</a>&nbsp;along with my routine, after seeing on several websites that it is the best rated fat burning formula and also gives you extra energy. I've been using the t-5 with this dvd for the last month and a half and have been losing almost 4- 5 lbs a week now compared to the 1-2 lbs I was losing previously. I am also not running out of energy as easily, especially after that second circuit that always seemed to drain me. I'm sure there are other supplements that might work just fine, this is just the one that I felt good energy and lost the most weight with.

I'm a 5'5 female and I weighed 185 lbs before I started and over the 3 months that I have been using this combination I have been able to lose a total of 41 lbs. With some hard work and dedication I was able to go from an unhealthy weight to a normal weight and I couldn't be happier with the results I have seen. This is a challenging program, but if you stick with it and don't give up I am sure you will all be able to see great results. I will keep doing what i'm doing until I reach my ideal weight and figure and I wish everyone else the best of luck with their goals as well.",1413417600,234,5635,4.625374625374626

This workout focuses on strength, abs, core and lower body. I would recommend alternating between this video and 30 Day Shred or something similar if you need to add some cardio into your weekly routine.

3709634,5,B001N2WISQ,"This is the best all round strength based workout out there, bar none. To give you context, I started two years ago as a couch potato, at 158 lbs that was too much for a 5'3"" frame. Started with Biggest Loser Power walk series. Switched to NMtZ in jan 2013. I did it four days a week with 3lb weights for nine to twelve months. Went to 139 lbs over the same time, and a size 14 to a size 8. I also got tons of increased energy and freshness to live life. This workout is very tough. I still cannot do it all the way through. I only started alternating with cardio 3x a week in jan 2014 (doonya the bollywood workout). I have tried all of the other biggest loser videos, most of Jillian's other videos including killer buns and thighs, extreme shed and shred, her 30 day video and her most recent seven day weight loss. None comes close to the pure perfection of NMTZ because this video has the perfect balance between multiple trouble zones, a very healthy cardio component and good emphasis on form. In this video she had not yet started pandering to the mass market so she does not come across as too obnoxious, just her natural sassiness. After two years i decided i had had enough of it and moved on to toher workouts but two days later severe withdrawal set in and i had to reincorporate her video into my routine. I have tried doing it with 5 lb, hope to get there someday but cannot manage it yet. I now have a 6-day rotation with 3 days cardio that includes amy dixon's breathless body videos, jillian's banish fat boost metabolism as well as the doonya bollywood workouts all of which i love. Nmtz is the mainstay of my strength routine, i also do weight loss yoga by bob harper, which is excellent. Now training with kettlebells for additonal strength variety.  But no matter what, i cannot imagine ever not doing NMTZ. It is the best to leave me breahtless and feeling energetic and toned. Hope this helps",1411257600,8,1916,4.366946778711484

There is very little recovery between circuits, which is good because it keeps the heart rate up but is difficult. The entire video is about 58 minutes long with a 5 minute warmup and cool down. Each of the circuits is about 6 minutes (with 5 exercises each) and you do each exercise (which is usually a combination exercise to get at multiple muscles) for about 30 seconds each and you do each exercise twice. It's hard but a good workout. If you are a person who is exercising for the very first time, this is probably a video to work up to because it is very difficult.

3709675,4,B001N2WISQ,It is a great workout but it's definitely for someone who has been exercising for a while. There are no alternatives for people who are new at this.,1407628800,,148,4.321428571428571

3709677,5,B001N2WISQ,"Arrived on time; got 2 for the price of 1; one thing I noticed about the DVD is that it starts where it last finished when the DVD is put back in the next time, rather than starting over. Not a big deal.",1407456000,,203,3.744186046511628
3709678,5,B001N2WISQ,"This workout video is GREAT!  After having my first baby I was desperate to get back into shape and regain my strength.  I started paying for a cross-training class at the gym, but it was way too much money to continue.  I came across this video and felt that is gave the same benefits as the circuit training class and I could do it right in my living room during my son's nap!!  After doing the video for a few weeks I definitely feel stronger and more toned.  I am back to my pre-pregnancy size and weight and I am feeling great!  I highly recommend this workout to anyone who is looking to tone up and lose weight.",1407369600,3,618,4.194915254237288

On the positive side it does have very challenging moves that I had never seen at a gym.",1407283200,,311,4.15
3709681,5,B001N2WISQ,I already feel tightening everywhere! I'm not afraid to admit I was out of shape when I started this DVD & I had to quit on multiple sets the first time through -- don't let that discourage you. My second time through I was so much better & only quit two times...I know it will be onward & upward from here.,1407283200,,307,4.049180327868853
3709682,5,B001N2WISQ,I've been doing this for several months now but I don't do the whole thing through at once. It's been great to add on 10-15 minutes of strength training to my other (Jillian Michaels) workouts - and I can still tell it has positive effects on my muscle groups. I definitely recommend!,1407196800,,284,4.480769230769231
3709683,5,B001N2WISQ,"I'm a big follower and fan of Jillian and her workouts. I own many of her videos. Prior to purchasing this one, I'd say that her Ripped in 30 was my personal favorite; both for it's effectiveness and feeling that I wasn't neglecting any muscle groups. Now that I have No More Trouble Zones, I find myself choosing this one over Ripped! She works you HARD in this workout. I am in a full-out, dripping sweat usually ten minutes into it. What I really liked about this one is that even though you work each circuit twice; each move is only executed for 30 seconds; so you never feel that you won't be able to complete the set of any exercise. I love the combination of upper and lower body moves and she's also got some ab moves in there that I have never seen before. This is one of her longer videos; about 45-50 minutes including warmup and cooldown. Trust me, by the time you get to the end; you'll be begging for mercy! I've been doing Jillian's dvds for several years now and she never fails to make me curse out loud at her! DO THIS WORKOUT!! I promise...you WILL see a difference in your body; overall muscle tone and general endurance level! It WORKS!!",1407196800,,1159,4.345622119815668

3709686,5,B001N2WISQ,"I can feel a big difference after only three weeks of using this video three times per week. The exercises focus on the arms, abs, and legs/butt, with some work on the back and chest. The pacing is fairly quick for a weights/mat video, I think, and often two groups are worked at once (crunch with a chest press, or lunge with a shoulder raise).",1407110400,,345,4.323076923076923

3709688,5,B001N2WISQ,"The workout is excellent! You definitely feel and see the results when combined with a healthy diet including a calories deficit according to your body/age. It is not really for beginners, though. I mean you could start by doing it without the weights if you are beginner.
I would recommend it!!!!!",1407110400,,298,4.862745098039215
3709689,5,B001N2WISQ,"If you liked the 30-Day Shred, you'll LOVE this workout.  This is a TOTAL body workout.  When you're finished, you'll feel like you've worked EVERYTHING!  The intervals are mixed well so that you are focusing on different body parts as you move through the workout.  Each interval contains a nice mix of exercises, and is long enough to feel like you're working, but short enough to muscle through the ones you find difficult.

I run 15-20 miles a week, so I'm not looking for cardio in a DVD, just strength intervals that get your heart rate up so you manage to burn some calories at the same time.  This video delivers exactly that!  I love that it has no plyometrics, just focused, controlled toning moves, that are not rushed like some of her DVD's.  Some are oldies but goodies, but they work.

As some of the other reviewers mentioned, Jillian does move through some of the moves a little quickly, and I had to pause to take a look at what she was doing a few times.  I think this is good, though - I find once I've done a DVD once or twice and learn the moves, the lag time for a ""demo"" is a little frustrating.  I've found that you either like her style or you don't, but personally, it works for me.  Music is typical for all workout DVD's.  The only improvement I could suggest is to get instruction without music - who doesn't love to work out to their own tunes?",1407024000,,1374,4.341176470588235

I have been searching for a workout routine that still gives me a great workout but doesn't involve such high impact as some of Jillian's other videos, insanity workouts, etc. This workout is PERFECT. She takes you through lots of moves that really do target those trouble spots, yet they don't hurt your joints in the process. It's worth trying for everyone, but especially those who want an intense workout (I am a runner) but without the burpies.",1405987200,,542,4.597938144329897

3709702,5,B001N2WISQ,I love this workout.  Excellent for toning.  I've been doing workout tapes for many years.  Jillian is tough but this workout showed that you need to vary your exercise routine.

It makes you really sweaty but nothing you couldn't do. Somehow its planned so that every time you want to give up they throw in an easier exercise. I wouldn't suggest this to people that have knee issues since part of this workout is you kneeing and getting up and my healthy knees get a serious stretch.

I enjoy this one and do it about 2 x a week as it is a little longer and really targets the areas I want to tone. I always feel I work up a good sweat and some times will pause the video and do 2 min cardio interval (jumping jacks, butt kicks, or something)
I have been using her videos for about 6 months and doing weight watchers and have lost 30 lbs and notice my arms are toner. I went from not being able to do a push up to now 10 at a time not on my knees. I credit the videos and all the plank and arm work. I do wish it had subtitles as I like to blast my own music.

3709723,5,B001N2WISQ,"I really liked this DVD, but there were a few things I wish I had known.
1. You should watch it once before doing it. She often doesn't explain the moves or give modifications for beginners until halfway through the first set, sometimes the second set. It isn't like the 30 Day Shred, which is really aimed at workout novices. This assumes you have a baseline of experience and fitness.
2. There's no cardio in the circuits - they're all strength moves, but they're mostly combinations (quads and shoulders, glutes and triceps, chest and abs, etc) and they move fast, so your heart rate definitely gets up.

I am a former dancer who hasn't worked out in several years (when I did work out - before kids - I pretty much ran, did the elliptical machine, yoga classes or pilates; I've never really used weights). After two kids and two c-sections, I have about 20 lbs to lose. I have been doing the 30 Day Shred for about a month (I don't do it every day), and this was a challenge for me, but totally do-able. As someone who has never worked out in a gym, really, the first time through this video was kind of annoying - I just don't know the names of all the moves, and they just jump right in.

Jillian keeps it interesting, moving quickly between 4 revolving circuits of exercises that keep you in the cardio zone toning muscles and burning fat--if you are working with intensity.

The workout is also easily modified by dropping the weights and decreasing range of motion or intensified by going heavier on the weights.

I have done several of Jillian's workouts, including the ripped and shredded series and this is right up there with them, albeit a bit older. But the exercises are solid and Jillian even kicks it old school for a few mat repetitions featuring donkey kicks!

3709746,5,B001N2WISQ,"Awesome total body workout.  This is my favorite from Jillian. I've done her BFBM, 30 Day Shred, Ripped in 30, and Shred It. It gets your heart rate up because there are no breaks and she uses combination moves that work your lower and upper body at the same time. She's good at showing proper form. There are 7 circuits and they're all challenging.  In my opinion, if you can make it through circuit 5, you can make it through the entire workout.",1401580800,,447,4.373493975903615

3709751,4,B001N2WISQ,"Wow - I was pleasantly surprised by Jillian's demeanor in this.  I expected an ""in your face"" drill sergeant, but she was supportive and caring, reminding viewers why we work out.

Workout:  I really like the workout.  Five minute warm up, 45 minutes of circuits involving weight or body weight, five minute stretch.  I was surprised that she had mat workout at the end.  I liked the entire workout very much.  She stresses light weights with high reps in this workout.

Music:  upbeat and pleasant enough.  If it's not annoying, that's great.  It's typical workout instrumental.

Set:  gym style but with brick and light.  Pleasant.

My one gripe with it is that she has two backgrounders doing the workout with her. She should have modifications shown at all times for all three levels, if an exercise has three levels.  I'm knowledgeable enough to know how to modify up and modify down, but not everyone is.

This is a nice workout for anyone who's getting back to working out or who's beginning but in decent shape. If you're really out of shape, I think you'll find this challenging, but if you stick with it, you'll get stronger and fitter.

I bought this a few years ago when I found it on sale and it's been gathering dust until tonight.  This is definitely one I'll do again when I'm looking for a nice workout when I can't get to the gym.",1401148800,2,1348,4.564853556485356

3709761,5,B001N2WISQ,"I purchased this DVD in fall of 2011 and used it three times a week (or parts of it) until last week.  I am so grateful to Jillian for making this DVD!  In summer of 2011 I had trouble going up stairs due to excess weight.  By December of 2011 I could easily go up stairs carrying a heavy load and had dropped almost 15 pounds, bringing me to a weight with which I was satisfied.  I hated, hated, hated doing the workout in fall of 2011!  But my mantra was ""fit by forty (years)"" and I gave myself a non-food (with friends) treat that I could do at the end if I lost the weight and kept it off for at least six weeks.  I did it!  I also altered how I ate based on Jackie Warner's book ""This is Why You are Fat"".  Not a nice title, but her advice worked.  I added things into my diet for the first two weeks and found I was so full from eating what she recommended that I ate less of other types of food.  Dropping the sugar was huge for me - and I found out after talking with a nutritionist due to low energy levels that I shouldn't try to keep natural sugars below 9 grams.  Anyhow, that is a different product to review!  But really, weight loss can't be done without altering the diet (unless you don't eat any more despite being hungry due to more exercise).

For a long time, Jillian's workout provided cardio for me.  It was exhausting!  Almost right away I did use 5 pound weights despite how hard it was, due to reviews which said 5 lb worked for them.  Then for a lot of the workout I switched to 8 lb.  Going beyond that, while trying to do it in a cardio fashion, hurt my joints a few times, so I went back to 8 lbs.  Speaking of joint pain reminds me to mention that losing the weight and gaining muscle through this workout pretty much eliminated my backaches, which had been a problem for years.  Again - you are amazing, Jillian!  Thank you!

Having a video for cardio does help me because I can just ""push play"" and try to keep up with whomever is on the screen.  That works better for me than making up my own cardio.  But since this no longer provides a cardio burn for me (except the warm-up) and I can't lift heavier weights while doing cardio, I have finally decided to move on.  My arms in particular are so nicely toned from this workout that it took me a long time to decide to switch.  This is a great DVD to start with when you are out of shape - and you may end up using it for 2 1/2 years like I did!  In those 2 1/2 years I have received countless compliments from people, including a statement from my husband that I look like I am in high school again (and he knew me then!).  I am stronger than I was in high school - and this is thanks to God for giving me the willpower to persevere through Jillian's workouts.

Oh - you may have read this in another review, but you can play the DVD with just music or with Jillian's instruction plus music.  I pretty much have her talk memorized!  You may notice that a few times you do more reps on one side than the other.  I did alter the ""Surrender"" exercise so that for one round I go down on my right knee and for the other round I do the left.  And toe taps I changed so that I wasn't tapping, to make it harder.",1400630400,,3189,4.036682615629984

3709772,5,B001N2WISQ,"This is my go-to video if I want a full body workout. It is fast enough pace to give you cardio benefits while working and toning individual muscle groups. The first time I did this video I was sore all over (in a good way)! Eventually I lost 15 pounds, worked my way up to using 5lb weights throughout (started with 3lb that she recommends), and felt generally toned. I've now tried p90x and Insanity, but if I'm having a week when I'm feeling a little extra fluffy, this is the video I put in first. She is so motivating in all aspects of life and keeps you focused.

Here's a snapshot of the video: Total length is about 50-55 minutes with the warm-up and cool-down. The warm-up consists of cardio moves with static stretching. The main workout part of the video consists of 7 circuits focusing on biceps, tricpes, forarms, shoulders, chest, back, abs, thighs, and butt. Each circuit contains about 5 different moves that repeat.

Beginners, I would recommend to take it easy the first time. I went all out doing full squats and could hardly sit properly the next day!! I know my mom does the first part of each circuit then fast forwards to the first part of the next circuit. But work your way up!! You can do anything you put your mind to!",1399766400,,1245,4.432314410480349

3709779,5,B001N2WISQ,"I've been doing workout videos since high school and have lots of opinions on them. Most are not great. Some are terrible. But pretty much all of Jillian Michaels's workouts are excellent. Yes, they'll kick your butt. Sometimes you'll think you're going to die. But you don't. In fact, you just get better and better.

This is not a short workout (if you're pressed for time, I'd go with Jillian's 30-Day Shred or Kickbox Fast Fix -- each workout is 20 minutes). But in 7 circuits you hit every body part multiple times and truly challenge yourself. Jillian uses the ""low weights, high reps"" method here; I do most of the moves with 3-lb. weights and a couple with 5 pounders. I've definitely increased my endurance and my strength, especially in my abs and upper body.

The first few (maybe even several) times I did this workout I had to modify several moves, but it worked its magic impressively fast. It's worth it to push yourself in this workout and take Jillian's messages to heart. You really are stronger than you know, and your workout is SUPPOSED to be hard. You SHOULD sweat and get out of breath. These are good things. They don't mean you're weak or out of shape. They mean you're working.",1399507200,,1203,4.590697674418605

So far, I have done Shred it with Weights, 6 Week Six Pack, and BFBM. I think this video might have made it to the top of my list! It was nice to finally do a lot of work with weights. I opted for weights heavier than the 3-lb ones used in the video and did less reps. It was a pretty killer workout and I am definitely feeling it today, especially in my shoulders and obliques. I think I'd like to point out that I don't think this is really for beginners.. there isn't much time spent explaining things and you have to have some knowledge of proper form for squats, deadlifts, and curls.

I'm a medium to aggressive exerciser, but short on time.  20-40 minutes in the morning is what works for my schedule.  I bought this one because it said that it was a 40-minute workout, but thats not true.  The entire run time is closer to an hour including the warm-up and cool down.

However, the workout is very good.  The moves are challenging, but not limiting.  I would have liked there to be someone demonstrating the modifications for some of the moves, but at least Jillian tells you what the mods are if you're just starting out.

I really don't like to waste time doing a lot of ab work, and the second half of the video is all on the floor.
I use a variety of weights depending on the circuit, from 3 to 12 lbs,. You can definitely up the weight and make this worth your time. If you use three pounds the whole time, you'll probably be disappointed, but for one of the moves (surrenders), 3 lbs is all I can handle.

3709801,2,B001N2WISQ,I did not care for this workout because there is too much done the wrist and my wrists have problems.  The intervals are good but some of the exercise are too painful for my wrists.  But she is very motivating but too hard for me.,1398124800,,230,4.088888888888889

3709803,5,B001N2WISQ,I had this video and used it for months. I reordered it for a second copy. It is one of my favorites are there are circuits that you can do in order or select one at a time. I'd you have knee joint issues you will need to modify some of the squats and lunges,1398038400,,258,3.709090909090909
3709804,5,B001N2WISQ,This is a great workout.  I am always pleased with the guidance and explanations Jillian gives for each move.  I felt the burn and worked up a sweat.,1397779200,,149,4.285714285714286
3709805,5,B001N2WISQ,I love Jillian's workouts.  You will definitely see results if you stick with it.  I find that working out at home with her videos makes it more likely that I will be consistent with my workouts.,1397779200,,195,4.388888888888889
3709806,4,B001N2WISQ,A great work out. If you follow through you will most likely see results. It gets easier as you use it more. She talks too much though and it's hard to follow without sound.,1397779200,,173,4.117647058823529

3709814,2,B001N2WISQ,"There are few proposition here as a workout interesting. Really few.
I find Jillian Michaels same like Bob Haper. They are very much concerned to her image. They got trapped on this business of image and looks like can not get rid of this, or maybe does not even know that this is happening.
I guess when Jillian Michaels started to be a fitness teacher she was amazing, caring and very energetic. I can still see those qualities on her and even more. But all is hidden behind a business mask that demand her to be like this, or like that. Pity. her potential is there. Hidden thou. If she was empowered of her own strengths without care for the fitness film industry this DVD will be completely different and great!",1397088000,,716,4.473282442748092
3709815,5,B001N2WISQ,"I do not feel like I'm exaggerating when I say that Jillian and her kick-butt DVDs are the secret to my success.  In my quest to get healthy (and work out despite my dislike of gyms) her DVD has offered me a way to work out at home, and get the intense exercise that blasted me into fitness.

I am already a fan of her 30 Day Shred DVD, and used that religiously when I first started to get serious about working out.  That particular exercise was the reason I lost my initial 10 pounds.  This DVD - No More Trouble Zones - was the next step in my self-imposed fitness regime.  It is not for beginners.  It is only one level.  Unlike the 30 Day Shred, which is three levels increasing in difficulty, this is one level of workout that's 40 minutes (approx) long.  Not every exercise can be modified, but for those that can, Jillian will call out the ""beginner"" form.  Even though I had already been working out from her other DVDs, I was unable to get all the way through the sets (there are 7).  It's intense.

This workout went a long way towards toning my abs.  My core is very very strong, and I can go all the way through the workout.  I would recommend pairing this with the Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism.  It is very cardio heavy, while this is very strength heavy.  I alternate days (one day NMTZ, next day BFBM).  Please keep in mind though that this does put some wear on the knees, so every fourth day for me is a rest day.",1396915200,5,1432,4.209558823529412

3709818,4,B001N2WISQ,"i did this workout today for the first time. i am already accustomed to working out with weights, so i used the 8 lb dumbells. i think they must use 3-5 lb dumbells on the video.  This workout lasts around 50 minutes and includes a warm up and a cool down/ stretching. Everything else is hardcore toning. With each exercise she will work your whole body (eg squats while doing biceps curls), so this is not for beginners. i like this workout, but i wish it was a little shorter (e.g. 30-40 mins) because the exercises are so complete and intense that a slight shorter workout would suffice and one would be more motivated to do it.... i am sure that this workout will deliver the results it promises because it makes a gym session sound like a breeze...",1396828800,,753,4.41726618705036

It was a very effective and efficient workout that you can do at home. I didn't have 3lb weights so I just filled up two water bottles, and it still worked out really well.

3709830,5,B001N2WISQ,"If you want to work on your trouble zones of tummy, wiggly arms and saddlebags, this video address those areas.  Jillian does circuit work so you can keep exercising for about 50 minutes, focusing on these different areas.  The circuits consist of five moves with 2 sets.  Most of the work is with weight,s and you use a yoga mat for mat work.

She coaches her two other exercisers - Kristen & Saleemah - who were on another of her videos.  Jillian explains what muscles the exercises are working on such as quads and glutes, triceps etc.  Her goal is to burn the calories and fat and grow the muscles.  You will work up a sweat and feel some burn doing these exercises.  Beginners may want to do 20 minutes at a time.  There are seven 6-minute circuits with a five minute warm-up and cool-down.  This video would be great to do as complementary to walking and yoga.",1396310400,,866,4.424050632911392

3709832,5,B001N2WISQ,"This takes about an hour to complete with the warm up and cool down but it is a very good head to toe workout that ingegrates cardio and strength maneuvers.  None are too terribly difficult to execute, so it's a workout I'm more likely to start and finish.  I supplement it with my gym workout weekly and you WILL feel it the next day.",1395878400,,335,4.21875

+ Each movement easy to learn
+ Clear instructions

- Too ""spa"" like pacewise; I'm used to the fast speed of Insanity
-  No timer/clock on the screen; I want to see how long each segment is, and total time left

It's one of the few that I can do most if not all the moves and still feel it. The first few times I did it I hurt quite a bit the next day. I used 5lb weights and I like the amount of instruction and motivation she provides throughout. Usually I don't care about what they are saying outside of helping me do the moves correctly, but in this video I found that the commentary added to the video. I also liked that they have variations to make the movies easier or more challenging which is important since everyone is at a different level or have injuries that effect their ability to complete the moves. I would say I'm at an intermediate level of fitness, I've lost 98lbs and exercise at least 5 days a week and while I still have more a bit more to go this video helped me get past my last plateau.",1395187200,,912,4.15819209039548

3709864,2,B001N2WISQ,"She's very dedicated. The workout was good, hard. I think her words got a little harsh at times, weren't super encouraging but rather said things along the lines of ""this is going to be so hard!"". I don't dig that kind of talk, makes it seem almost harder than it is. Also, making it an hour and incorporating more stretches would be more beneficial.",1395014400,,350,4.484375

Jillian's got some awesome dvds, but somehow this one always feels most effective due to it's length and total body work (vs, say, 20 min for abs only). Music is spot-on if a tiny bit repetitive, Jillian is focused (vs giggly which she often gets, especially in older dvds) and her two helpers are super adorable and smokin' fit. My husband has never tried this one, so I'd have to say its appeal is definitely more women-oriented (vs. 30 Day Shred which he likes), but I find myself saying over and over as I workout, ""this is a really good workout!"" Jillian's new Yoga Inferno is pretty darn awesome, too, one of my new favorites (despite absolutely hating Yoga Meltdown).",1394582400,3,860,4.554838709677419

I regularly do pilates, yoga, cardio, and light weight training.  Like most women, I always feel like anything that claims to better tone my thighs, butt, abs, and arms is worth trying.  I have to say I like everything about this workout.  Jillian and her two back-up trainers are fun and inspiring.  The workout is well balanced as far as time spent warming up, working out, stretching at the end, and equally hitting the ""trouble zones"".  When I first started, there were definitely times I needed to do the modifier or put my weights down.  As I've progressed, I can successfully get through the whole thing and actually look forward to the harder parts of the program.  I think it will soon be time to up the weights I'm using!  As far as results, I am very happy with the way my body looks.  I have increased muscle tone and strength in my legs and arms and my abs are getting more and more defined as the weeks go by.

I have not cared for her recent dvds because the moves seem too crazy,like she's trying to outdo herself-but for normal people,the moves are just way over the top! I am an Intermediate to Advanced excerciser but at the age of 47,I cannot to crazy 1 armed jumping pushups or crazy moves where you need to twist your leg over your shoulder! This dvd is still in my regular rotation and it still makes me sweat bullets. I still think this&her other earlier dvd,Banish Fat,Boost Metabolism are her best!!",1393977600,,600,4.564814814814815
3709885,5,B001N2WISQ,"Tough but worth it! I get her DVDs and she will always be my favorite trainer and the only exercises that show results after a short amount of time! The more i do the harder it is to stop! It is addicting and easy to follow along for anyone no matter what level of training you are on. However, it is still challenging enough to actually give you the results promised and expected!",1393977600,2,381,4.232876712328767
3709886,5,B001N2WISQ,Jillian Michaels is very good at keeping you motivated and busy while always making sure you are checking your posture/position so as to not hurt yourself. One of my favorite workout videos and seeing results. 5 stars for sure.,1393891200,,227,4.846153846153846
3709887,5,B001N2WISQ,This video is great for beginner's just starting out in weight lifting.  Still very much of a challenge. You will really be sweating.  It's a combination of cardio and weights.,1393891200,,176,4.833333333333333
3709888,1,B001N2WISQ,"I thought I'd give her DVDs a try. In my opinion, I don't feel like any of her moves are working for me. I honestly don't even break out in a sweat during these exercises. I think if someone is new to exercising, this might work, but I know of so many other exercises that give you better results than what she is exhibiting in the videos.",1393632000,3,339,4.074626865671642
3709889,5,B001N2WISQ,Love this work out. Hits the trouble spots for sure! So easy to just click on Amazon and have a work out right in my own living room!,1393632000,,133,3.7857142857142856
3709890,5,B001N2WISQ,Love this tape. It shows results fast and it's only 45min. I alternate it with another one of her tapes and I can see and feel the difference. The workout is intense but well put together.,1393545600,,188,4.25
3709891,5,B001N2WISQ,Jillian Michaels is a great motivator!  There is enough variety to not get bored.  Moves are not too hard for beginners.,1393545600,,120,4.666666666666667
3709892,5,B001N2WISQ,I love this workout video! I do this video every other day and it still makes me sore after doing it.,1393459200,,101,3.857142857142857
3709893,4,B001N2WISQ,Hits the key areas and meets expectations.  Make sure you have light weights to use with this workout. Great program to work in to your exercise routine.,1393372800,,153,4.666666666666667
3709894,5,B001N2WISQ,I ALWAYS like Jillian Michael's workout videos.  With this video I didn't always use the weight when shown on the video-I think mainly because I don't have a weight less than 5 lbs. (like they were using).,1393372800,,205,4.54054054054054
3709895,4,B001N2WISQ,Jillian Michaels covers all the muscle groups in her video and works out multiple muscles at the same time to burn calories as well as tone muscles.  This is a tough workout and will get you fit quickly.  I've done the workout 2-3 times a week and have noticed an improvement in my muscle tone.,1393372800,,294,4.327272727272727
3709896,5,B001N2WISQ,"Jillian brings it once again. She is the best. This workout targets all the areas a woman wants. I bought a lot of her workouts because I never get bored, stay in the best shape. She is the best trainer out there right now. I have worked out all my life, I was a coach for TeamBeach Body for 3 years, and Jillian to me is better than all of it out there. Love her workouts, love how she pushes you. I can't wait to get home from work and do another one of her workouts.",1393200000,2,469,3.8958333333333335
3709897,5,B001N2WISQ,"I've been doing Zumba for about a year and after one session of this video, I had
stomach and thigh muscle hurting for days! It is low impact, but you'll be sweating before it's
over. Great muscle workout, I can't wait to do it again! I'm going try some of her other videos for a good cardio workout, too.",1393200000,2,305,4.186440677966102
3709898,4,B001N2WISQ,It does what it says.  It targets those unwanted bulges in the stomach and arms.  It is also includes a good cardio workout,1393200000,,123,4.304347826086956
3709899,5,B001N2WISQ,"I love how she mixes strength training with cardio. I was sore for 2 days after this workout! I will definitely be doing this workout again. It was great for abs, thighs, and triceps!",1393027200,,183,4.411764705882353
3709900,4,B001N2WISQ,"Very difficult for beginners, but targets the areas for stomach, arms, and back. Challenge for sure..But if you wanna look good for the summer this will do.",1393027200,2,156,4.814814814814815
3709901,5,B001N2WISQ,this workout is very effective and comprehensive.  I am the second week and start it as soon as I get home from work.  Jillian works several different muscles at the same time and it is not boring,1392940800,,196,4.27027027027027
3709902,5,B001N2WISQ,"I've been working out to Jillian Michaels for 5 months. I started with 30 day shred and then did 30 day ripped.  Once I finished both workouts I decided to  mix it up with this one  Wow! I haven't been this sore in a long time.  I have also been doing couch to 5k and nothing has been this intense.  I have obviously plateaued and now I have a new workout that challenges me and I can feel it the next day.  This one may be hard for beginners and it is a longer workout.  I started with her shorter circuits and its honestly the only way I would have stuck with it, but now that I have made it a habit I'm happy to increase the intensity and length.  This is just what I needed!",1392940800,3,678,3.9338235294117645

I also have been doing the 30 day shred, I found no more trouble zones to be harder but I enjoyed the slower pace.",1392940800,,313,4.508771929824562
3709904,5,B001N2WISQ,"This workout is tough for beginners, but if you're up for a challenge, you'll be fine. A few years ago, I started with Jillian's 30 Day Shred (great for beginners) and moved on to No More Trouble Zones after that. This time around, I started out doing No More Trouble Zones and it was a little tougher. I do like how you can do each section individually instead of having to do the whole video at once.",1392854400,,402,4.233766233766234
3709905,5,B001N2WISQ,"And I appreciated it for that! I love Jillian, I think she is very motivating and always seems to really be loving what she is doing! My body shakes the whole day from this workout and I LOVE IT!",1392854400,,195,4.0256410256410255

3709907,5,B001N2WISQ,"Challenging, toning, great workout. Jillian is awesome, as we all know. I hate her during the workout, but love her after when I feel amazing...and what her workouts do to my body is pretty amazing, especially in such short amounts of time.",1392681600,2,240,4.738095238095238
3709908,5,B001N2WISQ,"This is a great overall workout. If you don't have time to do the full body 45 minute workout, then you can choose any circuit that you want to work on. I got this DVD last month and it never gets old.",1392681600,,201,3.8095238095238093

3709911,4,B001N2WISQ,But Jillian talks way too much.  If you can find someway to do it without her talking then it is perfect.  I have to hear her to be able to know when to change moves.  :(,1392508800,,170,3.6666666666666665
3709912,5,B001N2WISQ,"This was the first dvd I ever did from Jillian Michaels and I must say, I love it!  I have done several workout dvds, and this by far, has to be one of the most effective and challenging home workouts I have done.  It works every muscle, while burning fat and calories, due to the workouts being done in circuits.  I like the fact that she does exercises that incorporate more muscles, working out more than one body part, therefore giving your body a better and more effective workout.  I used this dvd when I can't make it to the gym, and since it only takes about 50 minutes, it's easy to fit it into my day.  I look forward to trying more dvds by Jillian.",1392422400,,659,4.198412698412699
3709913,4,B001N2WISQ,"I like this workout a lot because it's easy to follow, but gives you some sweat. Jillian also helps to motivate you throughout the workout, which helps to push the limit. I wish it were longer,i think a 90- minute version will be a kickass workout.",1392422400,,248,4.413043478260869
3709914,5,B001N2WISQ,Very challenging yet achievable.  I felt this the next day - in a good way.  Will do this one again.,1392336000,,100,3.95

3709916,5,B001N2WISQ,"This is a great circuit training video.  I have never worked up a sweat like this with a toning exercise video. I normally just run about 5-6 miles during my workouts but wanted something to help tone some areas.  In this video you not just work your muscles but also burn calories because of the type of workout this is.
During the circuits you are working two areas at once to maximize calorie burn and work your muscles.  So for example you will be doing lunges to work your legs while doing tricep curls with weights to work your arms since just working the arms alone doesn't burn the calories.  Great Combos in this video. I felt like I really worked out after the video.",1392249600,,677,4.392
3709917,4,B001N2WISQ,I gave this a 4 star because I haven't made it completely through this workout. I do a cardiocore workout at a MMA gym so I consider myself fairly fit for 52. It's always harder to push yourself at home. I like the fact that each exercise is working more than one set of muscles.,1392163200,,279,4.090909090909091
3709918,2,B001N2WISQ,"Sometimes I feel like the only person who doesn't love Jillian Michaels. This is an okay workout; some of the moves felt effective, but it's cued very poorly (no counting reps, no preview of what move is coming next, and she begins each exercise by saying ""and,"" which is annoying). I kind of like the circuit format. But it's definitely not for beginners, as Michaels offers few modifications and her form is questionable at times (although she doesn't spend much time doing the exercises; she's frequently commenting on the other girls, which is not very motivating). I find her personality and tone extremely abrasive and condescending. Most of her comments sound like they're scripted, not natural or sincere, and she's a terrible actor. And she talks throughout the entire workout. If I do it again I'll probably choose the option to turn off her instructions, but this video may not make it into my regular rotation.",1392163200,3,922,4.916666666666667
3709919,4,B001N2WISQ,"This is a kick a** work out, I absolutely love that this gets me sweaty & wanting more!! I am 9 months post partum with our third child. I have been trying a little bit of everything, including her 30 day shred.
Compared to the 30 day shred videos this is what I would consider a step up, not too mention the added time but it really did fly by just like her 20 min videos.

My glutes, abs & hips are sore... Let me just add my abs don't normally get sore. I have a very strong core area because I also do Pilates and this videos did AB moves I have never seen before (I really thought I had seen them all!)!!

Overall this video really gives me some fresh new moves which in turn is great for muscle confusion on your body! The ONLY reason for 4 stars is that I wish this came in a set of 3 different work outs like JM's 30 day shred. I'm going to be using this video in my work out rotation but you certainly shouldn't do this one every day.",1392076800,,943,3.931937172774869

3709921,5,B001N2WISQ,This workout is long but worth it!  It makes all my muscles hurt...but it's a good hurt.  I have bad knees so I can't do lunges as low as she does but I still feel the burn with little to no knee pain.  I highly recommend this for trouble areas!!,1392076800,,246,3.88
3709922,4,B001N2WISQ,"I typically don't care for at home workout videos, I preferred to hit the gym. This one was better than I expected and I actually woke up sore the next day. It really does work on problem areas.",1391990400,,194,4.131578947368421

3709926,4,B001N2WISQ,"i love Jillian's workout because she splits them into 5 or 6 minute chunks w 2 sets in each chunk.  Makes you feel like you can get thru each chunk since it is ""only 2 sets"".  And you look forward to the next new chunk while trying to breathe.  She mixes the chunks up with very difficult ones and ones that are ""easier"" than the last.  So very doable.",1391731200,,352,4.057971014492754
3709927,5,B001N2WISQ,"This workout is a great compliment to Jillian's 'Burn Fat, Boost Metabolism' workout.

3709938,5,B001N2WISQ,Really good workout which makes you feel sore for days. But worth every second of it! Some parts are tough but Jillian guides you through it and gives modified exercises for beginners. I thoroughly enjoy working out to this video.,1390953600,,230,4.775
3709939,5,B001N2WISQ,"I love Jillian Michel's DVD's and this one is no exception!  She gives a great workout and really maximizes the time you have.  I find her motivating and easy to follow.  Some moves are harder than others but she usually gives a modification.  I like this DVD in particular because the work-outs are 20 min long (about 27 with warm up and cool down)... so it's perfect if you don't have a lot of time to work out.  Plus there are 3 levels, I get bored easily so it's nice to have different options.",1390953600,,498,4.25531914893617

I've gotten other people's workout videos, but I keep coming back to Jillian--she's my favorite! I started with her beginner front side/back side workout, then went to 30 Day Shred and Ripped in 30. Then I bought this DVD and Banish Fat Boost Metabolism. This is my favorite by far. Other than the warmup, there are no moves that are just cardio, which is what I prefer. It still gets my heart rate up and makes me sweat buckets, but it does it with strength training moves. It's hard, but still doable, and I feel great the rest of the day after I've done it.

This one definitely kicks my behind (just like all things Jillian Michaels) and I can see how it would target trouble zones.  It just doesn't keep me as out of breath and moving as those other work outs- I feel the ""burn"" (pain!) more after this one, but I don't feel like I got as good a cardio workout. I also find this one pretty dry and boring.  I will rotate this in to my weekly routine because I do think it hits some muscles that my other workouts miss, but it probably won't make it in often.",1390348800,3,604,4.050420168067227
3709950,5,B001N2WISQ,"Not quite as intense on the cardio as 30-Day Shred, the workout I started with, but that's not necessarily a negative.  Great for sculpting the arms, shoulders, upper back, and abs.  One of the things I like about 30-Day Shred is that it's only 20 minutes, so it's hard to come up with excuses not to do it.  I was initially concerned that this one was a full 50 minutes.  Turns out you have the option to view this by segment, so if you just want a 20 minute abs workout one day or 10 minutes of arms another, you can customize the routine to your problem areas and available time. I find the abs moves particularly effective at targeting various muscles that can't be defined by crunches alone.  As others have pointed out, the Surrender move is intense - I usually end up yelling ""I hate you Jillian!"" at my television several times during this one - but as she rightly points out, she gets results. Whether you're a die hard Jillian fan, or just looking for something new, definitely recommend working this one into your routine a couple of times a week.",1390176000,,1058,4.43298969072165
3709951,5,B001N2WISQ,I am completely impressed with this video. There is not a muscle group that isn't working while you're doing this workout. She really knows what she is doing and I can't wait to see the final results!,1390176000,,200,4.4324324324324325

3709953,5,B001N2WISQ,"My tush, abs, quads, arms, etc. are screaming.  It's going to be a long fall to the porcelain first thing tomorrow morning, but I got a really thorough workout.  I had to get a little creative to substitute for the exercises I couldn't do.  And I'm really glad only the cat was watching!  My balance was challenged (But I didn't fall down--YAY!), and my pathetic arm strength should improve!  I had fun trying to do the exercises; and I have something to shoot for as I learn the routines.

I feel this workout IS NOT for beginners.  No way.  Beginners need something more basic to teach the principles of core work and how to recognize if they're using the right muscles and how to isolate the core muscles.  If you're not familiar with the basics, you can wind up not getting the full benefit of the workout (just flailing along).  Or someone may earn an injury or set themselves back by overdoing.  Many beginners also need to get the hang of balance when learning to control muscle movements. This is more for people who already understand how to do those things safely and who would like to challenge themselves more.",1390003200,2,1122,4.56

3709955,4,B001N2WISQ,"This workout kicked my butt in a good way, and I think that if I stick to it I'll see results fairly quickly. I noticed that she gives several tips for beginners (ways to help make it less strenuous, like doing push ups on your knees if you can't do regular ones) more towards the end but not so much in the beginning. I also don't think she does enough commentary on correct form. Again, if you're a beginner, you need more direction of what to do and what not to do when performing a certain move. But all in all, I think it's a great work out and will continue to do it with hopes of getting rid of my trouble spots.",1390003200,,619,4.040650406504065

This video is like the Shred, but more intense.  I feel like I've gotten a much better workout without having to add extra to it.  I alternate between this and Banish Fat Boost Metabolism.  Weekdays when I don't have as much time, I cut out two of the seven circuits, and I do the whole thing on weekends.  Love, love, love this workout",1389830400,,487,4.138297872340425
3709959,1,B001N2WISQ,"DISCLAIMER- I've done many workout dvds and consider myself intermediate at it.
CONS- 1) She doesn't do all the moves with you. She stops suddenly, walks over to a girl and starts pointing at her form, which is distracting if you were trying to follow Jillians moves.
2)She doesn't explain the moves that well or at all
3)She assumes you can do push ups, jumping jacks and planks at an advanced level
4) She doesn't focus on beginners. She has more advice about how to make the workout harder than on how to make modifications for beginners.
5)Music wasn't as intense as the the workout
6)If you have bad knees or sensitive knees, forget it
7) Workout sequences don't flow well from one workout to another (very jerky and abrupt)

I don't know who this video is for, but its not for beginners at all.
Jillian doesn't explain anything, shes not a teacher, she's more of a military person yelling at you. If you like someone who will talk to you in a rough tone and yell at you, and not explain anything, this could be for you.

If you want a good teacher and trainer, I personally would pick Denise Austin videos.",1389830400,20,1112,4.472906403940887
3709960,5,B001N2WISQ,I love this video. Its a full body workout that I like enough to turn on and keep on till the end. Its hard and I feel great once I have finished it. Just 2 repetitions of each circuit seems doable and also keeps the workout from feeling at all boring. Jillian is funny and all her instructions are very clear and easy to understand. I recommend it fully!,1389830400,,355,4.159420289855072

3709963,3,B001N2WISQ,"The workout was great (though, a bit squat heavy in my opinion.) The biggest problem with the dvd is that Jillian doesn't take the time to show the exercises before you begin them. It's worth the time it takes to be shown the proper form for each exercise in a circuit. Secondly, I don't like that there's no clock or countdown - you're just doing the same exercise until she says to stop - I like to be more involved with my workouts and count or count down for myself. Otherwise it feels like it'll never end and I lose motivation.

Great workout - just not executed to my liking.",1389657600,,582,4.290909090909091

3709969,5,B001N2WISQ,"This is tough. It says it's  40 minute workout, but I think it's longer. Jillian actually spends more time actually working out and less time talking. She's a little nicer in this one. But it is a very effective workout! You will sweat and be sore the next day, but she always delivers results and that's what it's all about. I've been in the gym for decades and have never had the results I've had with her workouts. Being a fat teen as she was, I totally get the motivational factor.

(An hour well worth your time) Usually when working with free weights I can do several reps with 7-10 pounds. I started with 7 pounds and had to downgrade to 5... I'm not saying that's bad... the workout is -that- good! It is just what the title says - it works your trouble zones. Triceps, glutes, hamstrings, hips, ABS! And when I say works them, it does. I felt the burn in places I rarely do... I'm in pretty decent shape from running long distance for almost a year now. I got this DVD to help do some toning and strength train on my days off. I recommend this to beginners and seasoned athletes. You will feel GREAT after you do it. I just did it for the first time tonight, so I'm anxious to see just how sore I am in the morning. Call me crazy, but I'm looking forward to it!",1388966400,2,865,4.154761904761905
3709980,5,B001N2WISQ,I love this video! I did it religiously almost 5 days a week every week and saw fast results! It tones you and slims you and does make all those trouble areas nice and tight! I am someone who isn't the biggest fan of cardio so this was perfect for me the moves she has you do gives you a good cardio workout without wearing you out fast.

When I do not have to finish all the sets, I stop at a set that is reasonable and still walk away, sweating after 20-25 min.",1388707200,,335,4.123076923076923
3709984,5,B001N2WISQ,"I am 26 and not overweight, but definitely in need of some toning and light fat burning. Let me tell you, Jillian delivers! I always have to turn the air temp down and make a large glass of water before I start this workout. The first circuit is the hardest to me. I usually have to take a breather before its over but I'm working on doing it all the way through and I'm getting closer every day I do it. Since I started this DVD ( a month ago) I have noticed better tone in my legs, butt, and arms. As with any DVD, however, it's hard to stick with for people like me. You just have to make yourself do it every day and I promise you will see results. I also love Jillian because she's not annoying or too peppy. I think the only annoying thing about the DVD is when she stops doing the workout with you to go over to one of the other girls to talk about the correct form. I just want everyone to suffer together! Haha. Overall, highly recommended.",1388707200,2,949,4.080213903743315

3709986,5,B001N2WISQ,"My favorite of all of Jillian's DVDs. While not a true beginner, this workout was HARD but I got through it.  Unlike the shred and ripped workouts, this one focuses more on toning with some ""old school mat work"" and less on jumping around, but she keeps the pace moving so you burn fat.  Trust me, your heart rate will be up!  It takes a little under an hour, but for those of you who are better going the distance than sprinting, this is the one for you. I have been doing this DVD for several months - I started to actually see and feel the results within about 3 weeks and that really motivated me. I would love to see more of this kind of workout from Jillian.",1388620800,,664,4.131782945736434

I started with the 30 day shred and I use this dvd along with Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism to supplement.  She really does a good job at helping you target those trouble areas.  I personally feel the most effects in my abs but I'm sure that if I stick to this consistently, then other trouble areas will improve as well.  This is definitely one of my favorites.

She does hit many muscles and gives a slightly different spin on a combo of moves to make them effective.  If you are a newbie to working out or even an intermediate stage exerciser, this video will do well for you.

I love her ""motivational"" phrases too- like certain body parts not being invited to this party lol.  I like this compared to the 30 day shred because it is one 45 minute workout.  I did this once or twice a week in addition to my distance running before my pregnancy.  It toned my arms and helped my core (which is important for running!).  I attribute this to helping me have strong abs and helping my stomach come out relatively unscathed from pregnancy.  I'll be starting with this again soon.

I will say that after a while, you will notice yourself getting stronger and the dvd will become pretty easy.  I like that she has some suggestions on how to ""step it up"" to make things more difficult.  I also started to use heavier weights.",1387670400,,827,4.46

I am a healthy body weight, but at this age I've noticed that muscle tone and strength disappears FAST! Even though I had been a runner for years, running gave me a fit heart but no muscle. My knees are very creaky, (sound like stepping on rice krispies when I bend) so I had to be careful of all the lunges and squats. This type of exercise will build the muscles that support my knees. I would recommend starting with very light weights, I could only find 8#s today, which I couldn't do all the reps with. I might suggest this is not a great workout for true beginners, as it may be discouraging instead of motivating.",1383955200,2,735,4.183098591549296

My abs and my arms are also getting toned.  The workout is challenging, but I really enjoy it.  I workout with the dvd 2-3 times a weeks right now.  It is tough and she mentions in the video that 'beginners' need to work up to the full routine.  The workout is about 45 mins total.

I bought it because I wanted some variety in my workout routine.  It definitely provides that.  If you want to change things up a little, I would try this.",1383264000,3,596,4.149122807017544

This is a great video for all because they show three different levels for all the exercises. So throughout my weight loss program, I was able to stick with Jillian's DVDs since I was able to start off easier, move to a harder level, than really push myself. Definitely helped lose the weight and tone at the same time. Love Jillian!",1381104000,,497,4.354838709677419

I still cheat a little and modify the exercises, especially a lot of the arm ones in order to get through the entire video, but I am still progressing.

Recently I participated in a boot camp, and it was during this experience that I realized I may have been being a little too easy on myself.  I became aware of serious weak areas.  So, when the boot camp ended, I launched a search for a DVD that I could use to continue my workout at home.  I confess I purchased this DVD based solely on the reviews. Although I had heard of the program, The Biggest Loser, I had never seen it, and I didn't know who Jillian Michaels was.  I should have known I was in for a  bit of a shock when I mentioned my purchase to friends, and they let out this little gasp. One person even said, ""I would never buy a DVD by her; she's an animal.""  Well I did purchase the DVD and I must say I am very happy with it.  I have only been doing it for a couple of weeks, but I can already feel improvement.  I was a bit shocked at first that I could not complete some of the sets, but at the same time I was happy that this DVD would keep me engaged - mamby bampy it is not.  With each workout I see slight improvement, increased strength and the ability to do a little more.  So, all in all, for the price a GREAT VALUE, it will easily keep me from being bored for a LONG time.  I want those arms!!!",1377129600,4,1320,3.8805970149253732
3710051,5,B001N2WISQ,"Just got the DVD and worked out with it for 2 days so far. Looking to lose a few pounds and tone and sculpt my body. I don't really enjoy cardio workouts and this definitely gets the heart pumping!  I do feel the soreness after the workout which tells me that my muscles are getting  good workout. I have done ab exercises in the past but nothing has worked my abs quite like the exercises in this DVD. I am hopeful that I will get the results I want if I stick to it and will try to update a week from now.
UPDATE-So after 3 days of consecutive days of workouts I really started to feel some discomfort and a few sciatic and knee issues..I generally don't have any problems but I think the lunges were tough on my knees when trying to maintain the pace. I don't regularly do lunges so my technique may have been bad. I now use the DVD to target specific areas like abs and chest and stay away from the lunges and squats. I still love the DVD but have found it better to chose specific exercises and mix that in with my regular gym exercise routine.",1376697600,,1049,4.137254901960785
3710052,5,B001N2WISQ,I borrowed this DVD from a friend and enjoyed it so much I decided to get my own. The moves are easy and don't wear you out very quickly. The DVD arrived earlier than expected and in mint condition. Can't wait to get started!!!!!!!,1376438400,,231,4.2727272727272725
3710053,1,B001N2WISQ,"This did not work, no matter how bad I wanted it too.

I started this in May and started right away, with a free online trial of her diet plan to help with this I was onboard and using her DVD's M-F with the weekend filled with out door activity. I was keeping track of my work outs, activities and food. I just gave up after only loosing 8 pounds, no where near the 30 I thought I would be on my way to loosing. Even at 2 pounds a week I should have lost more and I gave up with complete disappointment.

So I loved the video and it was easy to follow. Jillian has a great body and that inspired my, she is a great teacher and the video was not bad at all. This video is broken up with different circuts to work on different trouble zones and cardio. It wasn't a bad dvd it just didn't give me results.",1376352000,,803,3.920245398773006
3710054,5,B001N2WISQ,"After you do this workout you won't have anymore trouble zones! When i started this full body workout, I was used to the Jillian Michaels Ripped in 30 video. That video is 30 minutes long and has 4 workouts you can do over a months time. I've had it for a year now and just keep redoing the program with heavier wights.

When i first picked up this video, it was only because i had lost my Ripped in 30 disc. I had been using 12 lb dumbells for the Ripped video so i did the same for this one. When the video started, i thought it was going to be such a joke and was considering getting heavier weights- it looked so much easier than Ripped in 30! Man did i have another thing coming! The first time i did it, I got about 10 minutes through the video (its 50 minutes long) and had to start modifying the exercises to make them easier. Eventually i put down the 12 pounders and got out my dusty 5s. That first day i only got 35 minutes through the video. I felt like i was using muscles i had never used before!! To let you know, I am very athletic and have done sports starting with gymnastics when i was 2 and cycling through soccer, volleyball and swimming. I started working out seriously with weights when I was 13 so the whole fitness thing is not new to me. This video killed me!! The next day i did it again and finished it using half 12 lb weights half 5 pounders.

Another thing about this video...since the actual working out part almost an hour long, the circuits were a TON longer and harder than my usual 30 min workout. I don't think i realized it would be that hard. I really like the fact, however, that you can very easily modify the exercises to make them harder or easier by adding or taking away weight or tweaking the exercise.

I think Jillian Michaels did a FABULOUS job with this DVD. It is great for any experience/fitness level and really does get rid of those trouble zones.",1376352000,4,1901,4.2027397260273975

3710073,3,B001N2WISQ,"I bought this because I had been waiting for it to stop raining for 3 days now so that I could do running...no such luck.  I wanted to do some kind of exercise so I chose this through the instant format.  It was okay.  I am in pretty good shape (I have run marathons and used to do Crossfit...I can't afford Crossfit anymore but I still do a home-made version on my own) and I felt like I got a decent workout.  I wouldn't say that it was the hardest workout I have ever experienced by any stretch of the imagination.  Some of the exercises were more tricky to figure out your first time through like the Surrender one, but if you have a high level of base fitness, you should be fine.

The thing that I didn't like about this DVD was the idea that you are working on 'problem areas.'  Sure, you might get some toning from this, but the best way of working on problem areas is to lose weight overall.  'Spot training' doesn't really work.  Being fit as a whole does.  If you are hoping to get tighter anything, I would recommend adding a cardio DVD or two to this.  You need to slim down overall to look slim anywhere.",1372723200,2,1118,4.177570093457944
3710074,3,B001N2WISQ,"I liked that it targeted specific muscle groups, but I didn't like that it didn't incorporate cardio. I feel like unless I use 5 pound weights, I can get a better workout in 30 or 20 minutes with one of Jillian's other DVDs.",1372377600,,224,4.232558139534884
3710075,5,B001N2WISQ,"I got this to get me in shape for my wedding, my arms were burning 10 minutes into it.  It's a great workout, I love all her DVD's.",1372291200,,131,3.6785714285714284
3710076,4,B001N2WISQ,"For those of you that are less than active this will be a hard workout to get through. I made it successfully through the warm up on my first day! The next time I made it through the warm up and the 1st circuit set and then I was sore for 3 days. So if you are a person who does not lift weights or do much more than walking and house work this DVD will kick your flabby butt, which is good, but also hard to keep motivated to go have my butt kicked again. The best part of the workout is Jillian. Even though she is on the TV she still scares me and I feel that she knows when I am slacking - which I know isn't true, but she is very intense and the way she words the work outs makes it seem like you can totally do this and don't worry, only a bazillion more to go.

In all sincerity, I am giving this DVD a 4 star rating because I really like Jillians intense coaching, the workouts used minimal equipment (a mat, some small weights, and mostly my heavy body resisting gravity) I was able to do the workouts in my living room without bumping into anything other than the over excited dog. I didn't feel that it moved too fast either, of course the first time you watch it, it will be a bit difficult to switch between workouts, but on my second time I had the jist of what was going to happen. The way Jillian does circuits you kinda flop around on the first circuit, but by the second you should be prepared without much flopping.

The only reason this DVD did not get a 5 star from me is it is a tiny bit advanced. I am sure as I go along this will become easier and easier, but starting from 0 this DVD is quite tough.

Best of luck you living room work out fiends.",1372291200,5,1671,3.9672619047619047

3710080,4,B001N2WISQ,I really like this workout. It is a great follow up to 30 day shred when you are looking to move to the next level for your workout. I use it one the weekends when I have more time for a longer work out.  It is close to an hour with warm up and cool down.  I am able to do all the moves and keep up with Jillian.  I only consider myself in moderate shape.  I really enjoy her motivation speech during cooldown,1370822400,,409,3.8333333333333335

3710084,5,B001N2WISQ,"I have four of Jillian's workouts, including 30-day Shred, Ripped in 30 and Yoga Meltdown.  Each of them have their place in my workout routine, depending on what I feel like doing.  However, this video is my favorite!  The variety is awesome:  if I want to workout for an hour, I can.  But if I only have 30 minutes, then I can pick and choose among the well-chaptered circuits to get it done.  Better still, if I have a particular area, e.g. triceps, that I want to whip into shape for those sleeveless tops and dresses, then I can do that too.  I feel so ""tight"" after this workout, so I know I'm really working; even if I only do 30 minutes.  I use 3 lb. and 5 lb. dumbbells, depending on the body part.  With Jillian's workouts, you don't HAVE TO go to a gym or get a personal trainer to get the body you want; no matter how far you are from your goal.  As long as you eat as healthy as possible and watch those portion sizes, doing her workouts consistently will get you awesome results.  I'm in the best shape of my life as a 53-year-old grandmother, without stepping foot in a gym. This is an effective workout for a great price...don't hesitate to purchase!",1370390400,13,1166,4.2785388127853885

I am not looking to work all muscle groups each workout, therefore the option of choosing is great for me. Each of the 6 circuits goes by quickly and does burn.  To get the most out of the workout I think you need to challenge yourself and use heavier weights.  I like the approach and motivation offered by Jillian Michaels.  I have only done the whole workout from start to finish once however, I have used the chapters 3-4 times a week.  I will continue to use this DVD regularly for a while.",1370390400,,591,4.288288288288288

I owe my weight loss to her. Working out with her DVDs for 6 months, I reached my weight goal. Even when I was doing insanity, I had to do some Jillian exercises after, to get motivated.
She is great. This was one of the last DVDs I trained with, to get rid of my muffin top - and those last 5 lbs are the hardest to loose, but with her help, I did it.",1369958400,6,488,3.7941176470588234

3710093,5,B001N2WISQ,"WHAT a video! I used this when I was getting ready for a wedding. I did the full video once a week, did cardio and another video on the other 4 days a week. Excellent shape. Then came the baby... Over 40 lbs later, there was a lot of work to be done postpartum. So I started cardio a couple weeks after he was born (I could only do 15-20 min initially) and then I started incorporating some of the circuits in this video (not the ab ones for 8 weeks) and then started doing this once a week once I got the okay from my doctor. I lost all my baby weight within 3 months. Yes, I was breastfeeding and watching what I ate (no junk food), but it just disappeared. Plus, the toning is amazing. I am in better shape now than I have ever been. My abs are FLAT (no sign of a baby and the 40lbs.) and I only do this video once a week and I usually throw in a Ripped in 30 level one day a week and then possible Bar Method another day a week. Plus, I can do it during naptime, which is a huge plus. No gym membership required. Anyway, I don't share it much, but this is my big secret. I have to do this once a week.

I can see how this could be intimidating for someone who is just starting to work out or get back into shape, but my advice is to take it slow. I made the mistake of trying to keep up with it right from the get-go and I ended up being so sore the next few days that I couldn't work out at all. When first starting out, find a balance between pushing to better yourself and pushing yourself to injury, and eventually you will be able to do the entire video doing all reps and from start to finish.

3710113,5,B001N2WISQ,"About 3 months ago I began exercising regularly and this time around I wanted to find something I could stick with.  I bought several of Jillian Michaels' DVDs and have found that this one is the biggest staple for me. The main reason I like this workout is because it is entirely strength circuits and no cardio. I always work out at the end of the day, often after having eaten dinner, and I'm not always in the mood to be jumping all over the place.  No More Trouble Zones gives me a great all around work out and CHALLENGES the heck out of me!  I have actually never made it through this entire DVD and I've been doing it for months now.  (I also use 7 pound weights so I use this as justification for cutting out early).  Although I use some of Jillian's other DVDs as well (namely Shred and Six Week Six Pack with occasionally Banish Fat Boost Metabolism and Killer Buns and Thighs mixed in) I am convinced that my newly toned body has come mostly from NMTZs as I do this workout most consistently.  Additionally, I am the type of exerciser who gets super bored/annoyed with doing the same workout over and over (although convenient for its efficiency, 30 Day Shred just annoys me after awhile!) but I find that NMTZ's always seems ""new"" and ""fresh.""  Even though I am very familiar with it it remains challenging in just the right way, and Jillian hits the perfect tone in her instruction.  The pace of the workout is also perfect.  Often her other workouts seem like a whirlwind and I have trouble establishing proper form.  In this DVD she actually gives you the chance to sink down into certain positions and gives you a bit of recovery time.  I often begin this workout after a nap when I am only half awake and am able to wake up as I do it.  This is my go-to Jillian Michaels DVD and I highly recommend it if you want a great strength workout and a break from all the cardio.",1366156800,5,1888,4.332386363636363

Jillian works out nearly every muscle on you in this workout. You will burn calories as well as tone muscles. She doesn't do even reps to often, but you will learn that you might want to start on the opposite leg next time, or set up your own count, for example, tell yourself that you will do 12 reps on each side regardless of what Jillian's counts are.

I have had two kids and because of this DVD, I look and feel better, now, than I did before the babies!! I'm not saying that to brag, I'm saying it as a motivation! If I can do it, anyone can!!
I now have a defined 4 pack with a 6 pack that sneaks in here and there :) , awesome arms, nice legs, and goodbye mommy butt!!
I did ""Shred"" for like a week, but I felt like I was going to hurt myself (wrist, knees, wrists). When I started this, I felt empowered! In the beginning, very tough (lots of burning and ""I think I can"" behavior), but with the modifications, its doable. The more I did it, the more I was able to increase my tolerance of the exercises . Its all about consistency! Not giving up! I couldn't do everything at first, which  I felt kinda bad about (no one wants to NOT keep up). I did all I could do, everyday and stuck with it. Before I knew it, I went from 2lb weights, to 3lb weights (which they use in the DVD and I still use in the beginning part of the workout) to 5lb weights during the second half of arms, just to add extra resistance!
I do it at home, NO GYM, and in front of my  boys so they can see how important movement is. I'm taking care of myself and setting a good example for them. Now I keep up with the girls working out and I'm feeling great! If I can do it! YOU CAN DO IT!! You'll thank me later!! ""No more Trouble Zones""!",1364774400,6,1655,4.009090909090909

I haven't bought workout dvds in years, but someone mentioned Jillian Michaels and after seeing so many positive reviews, I thought I would rent it before buying it.  It was so enjoyable!  I ride a recumbent bike 7 days a week while I watch movies, but thought I needed to amp up my workout to get even better results and this dvd and others by Jillian that I've purchased since I bought this one, are the answer.  Some people say they don't like Jillian's tough talk or the music playing.  I don't even notice any of that, because I'm too busy trying to do the exercises correctly and huffing and puffing.  I have been singing her praises to people at work and found out that alot of people agree and already own quite a few of Jillian's workout dvds.

3710137,5,B001N2WISQ,"Let me start by saying that I HATE exercising, but having just turned 40, I realize that it needs to become part of my daily life in order to keep me healthy and set a good example for my 2 young kids. I started out with the 30 Day Shred after a recommendation from a friend, thinking that I can't make an excuse for a 20 minute workout.  It gave me good results, but I found Jillian to be pretty abrasive in that video.  It also moves along at a pretty fast clip, so it's difficult to concentrate on good form/mechanics, and my knees took a beating as a result.  I thought I'd give NMTZ a try, knowing that Jillian knows what she's doing.  I have been very impressed with this workout.  Even though it's 50 minutes, I find myself wanting to push through the whole thing because it feels so good, which coming from someone like me, is really saying something!  I thought about trying to narrow it down to a few key circuits so that I could abbreviate the routine when I'm pressed for time, but I like them all for different reasons, and couldn't choose!  I can tell which trouble zone groups are being trained with each circuit, and I swear after only 4 full workouts, I can see results in the mirror.  Jillian's personality is softer and more encouraging in this workout, and it moves a little slower, so it's easier to work on proper form.",1364428800,2,1341,4.336

Throughout Week 1, I felt like I was going to DIE, and I am in good shape! But don't worry, as you do this workout, your body is getting stronger so it does feel like it gets easier. I have lost almost 8 pounds. A month ago, I did the Ripped in 30 workout, and slimmed down quite a bit. NMTZ to me is tougher than RI30. With RI30 you are alternating muscles and pace often, whereas with NMTZ you are hammering away at the same muscles for the entire 50 minute workout. I am a fan of all JM's workouts!

You really do get a full body workout.  Since the pace is fast, you get an added bonus of heart rate being up. I have a love/hate relationship with these exercises.  I hate it while I am doing it but then feel so good that I got through it at the end. This workout is accessible to all by simply adjusting weights or modifying some moves. Her compound exercises really get you going and provide you with the best workout bang for your buck. I actually started drinking protein shakes yesterday after this workout. I feel I need something to supplement and help with recovery as well as help build more lean muscle.

3710148,4,B001N2WISQ,"I like this video better than some of Jillian's newer videos because she doesn't try to do any really awkward moves that require a lot of balancing or hurt your knees/wrists/back. Her moves are compound, which is great, but they are also somewhat ""plain Jane"", which I actually appreciate. The workout is fairly long, and moderately intense. There isn't tons of emphasis on planks like in some of her other videos, but there is some, particularly in the last two circuits.

Jillian does not engage in some of the annoying banter with her assistants that she does in some of her other videos (ie. Ripped in 30).

This is a better upper body/core workout than it is for lower body workout or cardio. I found myself wanting to use lighter weights for the shoulders (5lbs) but heavier ones for the rest. Unless you are a beginner, you probably won't get much out of the 3lb weights you see them using in the video. I actually found the abs section quite good. There is little to no jumping, except that in the warm up segment there are jumping jacks and skipping.

The thing I like about Jillian herself is that she has great muscle and looks awesome, and it's something to aspire to. A lot of trainers these days seem quite thin to me, but Jillian has awesome upper body and arms.

3710150,4,B001N2WISQ,"This is a solid workout. It has a good warm up, and incorporates in a bit of cardio. The strength training is serious business(but with only light weights), and addresses pretty much the entire body. I was definitely sore the next day! My only complaint is that very little time is spent focusing on proper alignment and making sure that you keep your body safe/injury-free. I can only assume (this is the first Jillian workout I've ever done) that she must focus on these things in other videos and that this one is for more advanced/knowledgeable exercisers? ? She does provide some modifications for beginners, but sometimes not until after you've already done a full set on one side. I would not recommend this workout for a true beginner. I think it's pretty much asking for an injury. But if you already have a pretty good understanding of safety and alignment this is a very effective workout.",1363219200,,900,4.738853503184713

While I end up sweating more than a grill master on the Fourth of July after all of the DVD's, this one is BY FAR my favorite. The exercises are shorter which makes it easier to focus and really push through them, even though you have to repeat them twice. After working out to this DVD you should, assuming you didn't half a** it, feel accomplished and like you really put in some valuable effort. Despite what may be said about Jillian Michael's, I think she makes fantastic products that are worth the money. She is very motivational and helps you push through the moves while also doing them herself. At least at the end of her workouts everyone is sweating and not standing around with their hair still perfectly in place, like most workout DVD's.

3710173,5,B001N2WISQ,"I have several of Jillian's dvd's - I use them daily during the week - during the weekend I spend a lot of time walking with my fiance.  This dvd is a good, intense workout - in the beginning you may think it's sort of easy, especially if you've done her 30 Day Shred and BFBM because some of those exercises come back in to play in this one.  However, she increases the intensity of the workout and due to the other moves she throws in, those ""past"" moves are harder.  You can also make it harder, bend a little lower, stretch a little further, etc.  There are some great stretches in this workout.  I like the way she ends it with floor work and slowly brings you down, but during this she still keeps you working out and getting a good workout to the very end.  Listen closely to her when she tells you during the cool down to stretch until you feel the pull but don't push yourself, when I heard her say now grab your toe and pull it towards you during the cool down until you felt the pull, I just went, ""wow! that feels fabulous!""

I am 48, I love these workouts - they are intense, they feel quick but you do get results.  My fiance told me he could definitely see definition in my sides when I was changing the other night.

Update 2/28/2013:  After working out to Jillians 30 Day Shred every day and then alternating her other dvds every day of the week, this has been a wonderful one for toning.  One thing I realized today, I love that this one did not involve a lot of jumping around, not that there is anything wrong with that.  I do that enough with all her other dvd's.  I kept thinking I'd love to find a dvd that involves more weight training for those days that I'd like a break from all the jumping.  This is it!  After I did the 30 Day Shred, Level 2 today, I took a break and then popped this one in.  I was very pleased with how I focused more on the parts of the body the weights were working on.  I do this dvd once a week due to all the other dvds I try to work in.

Thanks Jillian!  Keep these dvd's coming!",1360800000,3,2033,4.075566750629723

I've gained some noticeable muscle and its ripped.  I use 8 lbs.  Would love to get up higher.  The only draw back is if you want to bulk up your legs she doesn't have enough weight to do that.  Keeps you thin but not bulky on the legs.  Mine look like toothpicks so I could use some extra weight there.,1360627200,2,464,3.924731182795699

I've tried Tracy Anderson's DVDs and Insanity to name a few, but, was disappointed with the lack of results and found the workouts not as challenging or free-from-injury as expected. I just ordered Michaels' NMTZ and can honestly say I loved it just after the first workout. I could feel my body responding immediately within the first five to ten minutes. I know that this is the perfect addition to my regimen. Each workout, I am drenched in sweat, can feel all areas I've worked and it feels grand.
Since I've been working with 20-25 lb KBs, I decided to begin with 8 lb hand weights (for fear of injury or strain) and NMTZ has been kicking my rear hard - plus I can feel that I've actually worked hard on my abs and arms - I know I'm going to be happy with the results.

Even though it was super hard, I am looking forward to doing it again just to see if the second time will be easier.  At first I didn't realize that she was using 3lb weights and I started the workout using 5lb weights so it was VERY hard. I then switched to 3lbs and then the workout become more doable. If you are a beginner, definitely start with 3lbs or you will not be able to get through the workout. I almost gave up a couple of times during the workout but I liked that Jillian was making sure to tell you not to give up and get through it...so I did! I think this is a great workout! The only thing is that she doesn't really give you a second to catch your breath. I am trying to slowly get back into, I don't have the strength yet and need a couple minutes here and there to catch my breath in between circuits.  I had to stop the video a few times and drink water and breath for a second. I suggest beginners do that also or it will just be too tempting to give up all together.

Sure, there are day's I don't have that time, so I'll instead do Ripped in 30 or Killer Abs...but when I DO have the time (and I MAKE the time because I enjoy this one), I do this workout!

People before me have detailed the circuits, so I won't do that, I will say, there is a circuit that targets every part of your body: abs, legs, but, arms etc.  And for abs there are 2 great circuits, one in which is very intense, and I have very strong abs, it's about the only Jillian Ab circuit of all her dvd's where I actually FEEL the burn at that time.  The first circuit on the dvd I consider mainly arms and it's a KILLER...however, since doing this, I have never gotten SO many compliments on  my arms!!  I know over-all this one has really helped my strength and tone me.  I like that my heart rate gets up, so I'm burning calories. According to my garmin, I burn between 250-275.  But I also like that this isn't as intense and high intensity as The Shred or Ripped in 30.

I would definitely recommend this DVD to friends.  Don't be nervous because it's Jilllian and it's over a half hour, I was at first, but was happily surprised that due to how she does these circuits and the exercises in them, I had no problem keeping up for the full workout.  Which reminds me, this dvd does offer you the option to choose a circuit, so you could skip one you don't like or if you are short on time only do 3 or 4.",1360368000,10,1573,4.1381578947368425

Not intense on cardio, but still pretty exhausting in a good way.",1360368000,,326,4.030769230769231
3710181,5,B001N2WISQ,"It's very simple- Jillian Michaels is a beast.  If you are not ready for this workout it will kick your butt and your legs will be wobbling and sore for a couple of days.  My suggestion is to ease into it.  Do a couple of sets a day for maybe a week before jumping into the whole workout.  None of the moves are difficult on their own but put the whole workout together and it's pretty tough for the average person.

If you want to buy it, I'd say go for it, it will get you the results you want as long as you use it regularly.  Good luck!",1360108800,2,540,3.908256880733945

I have been building up my upper body muscles recently and found this workout DVD suits my needs. The first 5 circuits of the workout focus on upper body and abs, and they are really effective workout! As for the lower body workout, I found it much lighter than the upper body workout (probably because I have a stronger lower body).",1359590400,,421,4.861111111111111

Many of her videos are sprints, but this is more like a marathon in the sense that it's spread out more and not as intensive. I also like how you can choose between different body part workouts, especially if you don't have time to do all of them. I recommend this for people starting with Jillian.

Her style is perfect at motivating me to become a stronger person and even a better person. She has changed my life for the better and I hope she's aware of all the lives she has touched. I am so glad to see her back on the Biggest Loser. That show really went downhill when she was gone...too many contestants with their nonsense. Not anymore....Jillian doesn't put up with that garbage.",1359504000,,581,4.290909090909091

It's the 30 Day Shred times twenty and by far one of the best workouts I've done in a while. For the past 3 years I've worked out nearly every day, doing strength training 3 times a week. However, this workout makes me feel like I'm just starting out. Jillian jumps right in and works the arms in circuit 1. This is the hardest part for me. When I'm finished I feel so accomplished. Granted, my arms feel like they're going to fall off and my legs are shakier than a fawn's, but I can tell I'm getting stronger! While I shout expletives to Jillian during the workout, I take it all back at the end and divulge nothing but pure respect for her ass-kicking abilities. Thanks Jillian!",1358467200,3,776,4.25

This is a good workout.  Left my muscles well worked and feeling fantastic. My arms burn after this DVD.  It goes through several circuits that focus on specific body parts.  I find after each circuit, that particular body part burns.  It's a good burn:)  They use 3lb weights in the DVD and occasionally I use 5lb. I can see using the 5lb more as I get stronger.  There are standing circuts and also some mat work.  Nice ab sections too.  This is a great all over body workout.  It gets my heartrate up a tad, and I get nice and sweaty.  I like the length, it's a little more than 40 minutes.  Some of her other DVDs are great too, and shorter.  I use this with some of her other DVDs on days when I am shorter on time.  I do this DVD about once a week and really enjoy it.

Jillian is tough, and this workout will make you feel like you got a great workout in.  Great as part of home exercise DVD library.",1358294400,,1158,4.098214285714286

I actually look forward to this video and I can do it without stopping and without skipping any of the repetitions.  She uses circuit training so when you feel like you've really exhausted a muscle group, it gets a rest while you move onto another part of your body.  This workout is effective but also do-able for those with average abilities.  And it's not boring like a lot of other workout videos that I do.",1357862400,,533,4.3

After my second child, my body changed and my tummy would not go away so I am using this along with 2 other michaels dvd's to focus on this problem area. Highly recommended!",1357776000,,494,4.15625

3710211,4,B001N2WISQ,"I have Jillian's 30-day shred and kettlebell workout DVDs so I'm pretty used to her style. I like to say that Jillian Michaels and I are in an abusive relationship - she keeps beating me down, but I love her for it! I am a pretty big runner but had knee problems for years that kept me from running much. Jillian's workouts are hard on the knees, but if you pace yourself they are really amazing at strengthening weak knees. After a year+ of Jillian workouts I have learned to do one of her DVDs 2-3 times a week and run on the other days. I haven't had bad knee pain in over a year!

Since I'm such a fan of her other DVDs I decided to give this one a try. I am sitting here now, having just completed the workout for the first time. I know other reviewers have said this is easier than the 30 day shred, but I disagree! It may be because I only have 8-pound hand weights (I am going out today to buy at least 5 pound weights - 8 nearly killed me!), but it was a struggle. The 30-day shred is intense, but it cycles through exercises so that parts of your muscle groups have time to rest a bit. This workout puts much more emphasis on arms (or maybe I just felt that way due to how heavy my weights started to feel).  At about half way through I begged for it to be over - and remember, I've been doing her workouts regularly! But, I never fully collapsed, and in the end it felt very rewarding. The workout is longer than the others which I hope will mean I see more dramatic results. The cardio isn't really featured in this workout, but I tend to have cardio days anyway. I think this DVD will be a good 1-2 times/week addition to my workout and I'm confident it will be a huge payoff in terms of strength training. I'm seeing more and more proof with Jillian's other DVDs that strength training helps me with my running - not only is there less knee pain but my pace is faster overall and I have better form. So thanks, Jillian, for another great workout!",1357603200,3,1960,4.141732283464567

This is a more for those that have done some of her workouts but aren't doing the expert moves and want a longer workout. Some of the moves she does in the 30 day shred are in this workout but this workout gives you time to catch your breath (which 30 day shred, not so much) because its longer.",1354406400,,593,4.120689655172414

Review at One-Month:
Okay, so I've been waiting to write this review, hoping it would earn all five stars... and it has!

So, okay... First about me:  I am already a slender person within my healthy weight range. Minus the muscle and add a little soft girly flab, I am very near the size of Jillian. However, I am soft... really soft!  I am the kind of girl who needs help opening jars in the kitchen, and I basically am never asked to carry anything.  I am the person who holds the door as other people carry stuff in and out, right?!  Well, that is me - I haven't always been enthusiastic about exercise, but in the past couple of years, I have liked it more... if only because the years are beginning to show.  I realized I must relent at some point and exercise.  So, I was cycling for about 9 months straight every night for about an hour each night. Before that, I was doing various repetitive exercises. I am religious about this stuff; I want to be fit.  Well, when the temperatures started dipping, I decided I wanted an indoor option for exercise.  Enter Julian Michael ""No More Trouble Zones.""

So, I have exercised to this streaming video (via Amazon) every night for just over a month.  At first, it killed me.  Wow - Although my legs are very strong from the cycling, virtual NOTHING else was strong.  Past tense being the emphasis there.  The first four days or so, I was so sore that I didn't know if I could continue.  However, I persevered, and the soreness subsided.  The first few weeks, I started feeling stronger, but I really wasn't seeing a lot of results.  I felt better, yes, but in the mirror, it looked about the same.  I decided around the 1-month mark that I needed to cut more calories in a day.  After all, I had been burning serious calories cycling every day, and although this video gives you a solid workout, it doesn't equal the calories I was burning cycling.  So, I cut about 200 calories out of my diet daily, and lo and behold... I am seeing results.

Jillian is cute as a button but tough as nails!  Here are just a few observations I've noticed along the way:

-- Knees:  If you have bad knees, then is may not be the workout for you.  There are several exercises that may compromise your situation.

-- Abs:  I can feel every part of my stomach by the second round of Circuit 2.  Lord, that one is killer, but it's so worth it from what I can tell.

-- Side lunge:  To me, this one is so difficult, not because it hurts but it seems like something could go wrong easily.  Jillian is barking so many orders about how to do it right, that I am always afraid I am doing it wrong.  The producers may have benefited from showing the audience a profile view of one of the girls doing this lunge.  I am always afraid I am not leaning back enough.  Just my thoughts.

-- Sumo squat:  Okay this one is killer if you try your very best to keep your elbows pointed at the ceiling.  That is the trick to make this one burn like holy hell.

-- Plank:  For someone as muscle-challenged as myself, the plank moves really are tough.  Even after a month, I struggle with them.  However, I feel the burn like crazy in my abs after the push ups, so I recommend suffering through them.  The Plank Twist and Toe Taps are very tough if only because you have to stay in plank for so long, and the chick moves into plank so quickly.  This is just my experience.

-- Very quick water breaks:  When her two helpers take the mat, I always grab a quick sip of water.  This is just about the only allowance of time you have to stay hydrated apart from pausing the tape.  Just my observation.

So, okay... I recommend this one for sure if you are disciplined enough to stay at it and cut calories if you don't visibly notice results within a few weeks' time.  I will definitely continue using this, and I shall try to update this again at the beginning of the year to report progress.  Good luck to all - I welcome your comments or questions.

***Three-Month Update****

I have used this video everyday for three months now, missing only a few days total.  I am still in love with this workout, and most importantly, it really is working.  I think it's important to note that I do feel thinner, although I'm not sure if I actually am thinner.  I am, however, stronger, and the shape of my body is much more toned than it ever has been before.  My stomach is always flat, my arms looks kind of ""muscly"" even when they are not flexed (but very strong looking when flexed), my legs are firm, and my bottom is definitely super toned. In this time, I have tried other workouts, but I must say that not all workouts are created equal.  Jillian's No Trouble Zones is great because even when it feels like it's getting a little old, you always feel like you're getting a workout.  At about 2 months, I upgraded to 5 lb. weights, which was a real challenge; however, I adjusted and the results are showing.  I would suggest building up to 5 lb weights, though. I definitely could NOT have done taken the extra weight sooner, and I think it may have been discouraging enough for me to quit.  I have made a few modifications other than the incorporation of 5 lb. weights, which I'll itemize below:

-- Radio - Once I became familiar with the workout, I turned the video volume down to ""just audible"" and listened to a streaming Internet radio.  This is nice because you never know what you'll hear, and it makes the workout a little more interesting, especially when you hear an old song you love. I listened to the comedy channel once, and be sure not to do that!  I was laughing and it was hard to keep my pacing or positions.

-- Surrenders - I know some people really struggle with ""surrender,"" but it was a little boring to me. I know pump my arms up and down just as I do in ""sumo squat"" while I execute the surrenders.  I just find it to be much more difficult than holding the weights upright. That makes for one tough circuit!

-- Windshield wipers - After your second set of windshield wipers, Jillian has a rather long set-up before ""plank with a row."" I use this time to do about six more windshield wipers.  Usually by the time she pounds on her abs with her stomach (see the video), I stop and then set up for ""plank with a row.""  I find windshield wipers to be challenging and effective... might as well sneak a few more in!

I still love this workout, although I have watched and done it every day for three months.  I can definitely see the results, although I do think you have to be VERY thin to see the actual six pack abs.  I think I likely have six pack abs under a thin layer of girl fat. I guess if I were going to the beach, I might eat super, super lean that week and be able to see them!  But, I still have definition in my abs where none was before, and that is pretty amazing.  This is a great video!  I'll update again soon.  I check for comments, so please be sure to send them my way.

************ NEW!  12 Month Update! ************
Okay. So, here's the story.  At about six months of doing this workout every day, I realized that YES I was firmer and better toned; however, I felt like I was gaining weight - as if I were thicker in places that I didn't like.  Things weren't fitting quite right, and I thought it was probably best to jump on the scale.  Well, sure enough, I had gained weight.  The inevitable thought... I've added muscle.  Yes, I do believe I did - HOWEVER - not this much muscle.  So, I decided to clock how many calories I burned during a workout using a heart rate monitor. I burned around 250 calories during the 60 minute workout.  I decided to get a stationary bike and see how many calories I could burn in the same amount of time, not being too crazy but definitely breaking a sweat.  Well, it was more - by about 200 calories more, and at times, even more than that.  So, truth be told, this workout is great for muscle and toning; however, you aren't burning a lot of calories here.  Sad but true - It was sad for me, because I had to lose that weight all over again : (  But, a stationary bike and watching my calories had me back to the size I had aspired to maintain when I started the Julian Michaels workout.",1353888000,31,8276,4.296248382923674
3710243,5,B001N2WISQ,"I purchased this video about 2 weeks after having a baby. I was very in shape before my pregnancy, and this video was very difficult- but in a good way! I felt sore the next day after doing it, and with addition to cardio and other exercise videos (variety is key for me!), it helped me lose weight, and more importantly, tone all my muscles. She explains everything well and it is great for me!",1353283200,,395,4.28
3710244,5,B001N2WISQ,"I love Jillian's workouts and own a variety of her dvd's. I don't get sick of her workouts and they keep me motivated, especially since I am seeing results. This is a long workout but worth the time. I feel so good about myself after doing this and I am toning muscles I didn't know I had! Of the 4 dvd's of hers that I have, this one is my favorite.",1353196800,,350,3.943661971830986
3710245,5,B001N2WISQ,"This lady doesn't lie! This workout will change your body for the bettter. Most weeks I onlly get to this program twice. It takes time, but ifor the return it is worth it.

I would not recommend this for a beginner or for someone who is extremely overweight, because the moves could be tough on your knees if you are carrying extra weight. This would be a video that would be a goal for fine-tuning some of your stubborn areas after you have dropped some weight and want a good challenge.

Jillian Michaels seems to know exactly when to say,""Don't quit!"" How does she do that?! It really pushes me on and I don't stop. If I were working out without it, I would probably stop, thnking I just coldn't do any more.

I rarely look forward to this workout, but I go back because my body testifies of its results.

Very happy I purchased and use this video...and so is my husband!",1353024000,,874,4.343558282208589
3710246,5,B001N2WISQ,"I really like this Jillian Michaels video because unlike some of her other videos there isn't too much jumping. Because I have knee problems, I can't hop around too much, but I still want a challenging workout. This video banishes those awful trouble zones and gets your body looking fit and toned. I LOVE IT!",1352419200,,309,4.636363636363637
3710247,2,B001N2WISQ,"I found out the hard way this program includes exercises not recommended by docs and physical therapists. You will hurt your back eventually, even if you are moderately fit and not overweight. This would be awesome if Michaels would take out or modify the dangerous moves like fully bending over with straight legs, and legs lifted doing windshield wipers and scissors. Also, superman is so much better for the back if modified. The warm up is inadequate too. I am so disappointed because now instead of working out I have to rest my low back until my overstretched muscles heal. What's the point?",1352332800,6,597,4.805825242718447
3710248,5,B001N2WISQ,"I only did half of it the first day and I was sore for two more afterwards. I finished the second half the next day, and was sore again. Great Workout!",1352332800,,151,3.903225806451613
3710249,5,B001N2WISQ,"This is a really terrific full body workout and moves quick and before you know it you're at the cool down part.  I do think that the more conditioned one becomes from doing this routine you'll need at least three different sets of dumbells (5,10,15 maybe even 20lbs) for the various exercises.",1352246400,,294,4.653846153846154
3710250,3,B001N2WISQ,Only tried once but like it...I may have purchased too many DVD's for my own good at once and with a personal trainer now.  But I know this will be a good DVD to have.,1352246400,,167,3.7714285714285714
3710251,4,B001N2WISQ,I really like this DVD. Jillian Michaels is a great motivator. You really end up sweaty and exhausted by the end of the workout. She mixes in cardio and strength training for the most effective work out and keeps your heart rate elevated. Would recommend.,1351468800,,255,4.688888888888889
3710252,4,B001N2WISQ,This workout is awesome and if you follow it all the way through you will definitely see the results. For me personally it is high intensity and the workout should start after a month of constant exercising otherwise you might get discouraged and quit exercising.,1351382400,,263,4.866666666666666
3710253,5,B001N2WISQ,Great dvd! This is a serious workout for the whole body! After the first few times i was very sore. Prepare to sweat and work hard.,1350950400,,131,4.076923076923077
3710254,5,B001N2WISQ,"Bought this for my daughter, she's a teenager.  She really likes this dvd and has been doing it each day.  It is very motivational. Recommend it fully.

Update - 8th February, 2015
I have been doing this workout.  I find Jillian Michaels very encouraging - as I like to exercise with other people find it hard to get motivated to do so alone this is good for the motivation.  A but - my back aches the next day from the ab exercises - so you may need to watch that.  Haven't lost any weight but definitely toning up and more muscle definition and I eat balanced healthy diet.",1350259200,,575,4.277777777777778
3710255,5,B001N2WISQ,"wow, this workout is really tough, i have to modify a lot of the moves, but i still get a lot out of it.  this really is a great workout, and i pretty much can't move when i'm done.",1350259200,,181,3.641025641025641
3710256,5,B001N2WISQ,"This is a crazy hard work routine!  It is a great way to get in shape.  I usually run about 10-12 miles a week and thought I was in decent shape.  I was not prepared for the arduous workout but it WORKS!!  I can see significant results in 3 weeks!  If you are serious about shaping up and will commit your self, this is an excellent work series.",1350000000,,345,4.014705882352941
3710257,5,B001N2WISQ,"I love this DVD!! I feel like I have a personal trainer in my own home telling me to not give up! I first heard of Jillian when she was on Biggest Loser, helping obese individuals lose weight and gain their lives back. I have much respect for her and trust her exercises will change my body and push me to new limits. I am by far a fit person and am trying to get back in shape and build my overall endurance and tone up. I am 5'7"" and weighed 148 lbs a month ago and now I am down to 144 lbs. I feel stronger and look forward to sweating!! My boyfriend is also exercising with me and was 207 last month and now 202! We exercise 3-4 days of the week. We usually do parts 1 and 2, and only did part 3 twice as that really is difficult for us. I feel that my limbs, core, and bottom is firmer and stronger. Also, after 20 minutes of this dvd we will sometimes exercise longer, whether it be walking, doing yoga, core strengthening, etc. If you have a busy lifestyle, 20 minutes a day will give you the energy you need to take on anything! Do please give this a try!",1349568000,,1063,3.97196261682243
3710258,5,B001N2WISQ,"As, Jillian says several times, this workout is no joke. Prepare to be very sore and unable to easily traverse stairs for a while. That being said, it makes you sore in all the right places so you know that it is truly working your problem areas.  I have been doing it regularly for several weeks and am definitely seeing improvement.  I still am unable to complete every rep of all the moves so I know I still have a ways to go.

I think that it is the perfect blend of cardio and weight training to give the desired results. Absolutely worth the price.",1349395200,,554,4.257142857142857
3710259,5,B001N2WISQ,"This is a great workout. Totally worth the buy. I have her other DVDs too, I like this one b/c there is less cardio. I am not a huge fan of cardio so this is just right for me.",1349222400,,176,3.5384615384615383
3710260,5,B001N2WISQ,I'm totally team Jillian after purchasing and using this dvd.  She motivates you and pushes you through the workout!  The exercises are great: not too tough but not easy.  I've noticed great changes in my body and I'm happy about that.  Thanks Jillian!,1348790400,,252,4.790697674418604
3710261,5,B001N2WISQ,"I love this DVD. After becoming an avid 30-day shredder, I bought ""No More Trouble Zones"" because I wanted a longer workout. I do it a couple of times a week, and I am consistently dripping with sweat and happily fatigued at the end.

As usual, Jillian works out your entire body and encourages you to hang in there and to get through the tougher parts. The DVD has a great rhythm/flow to it when you do the entire workout, which is fantastic. You also have the option to focus on specific ""trouble zones,"" which I have not done yet because I enjoy the entire workout so much.

I've been using this DVD for many, many months now and I still have trouble with a few of the moves because they're so hardcore, but I'm getting better at them and I'm definitely seeing results.

My only piece of advice is to know what your limits are, particularly if you have old sports injuries or joints that are not in the greatest condition. Knowing how to modify some of the moves when Jillian doesn't show you how to will help you get a fantastic workout while protecting yourself, particularly in some of the more intense moves she has you do.

All in all, I can't recommend this DVD highly enough. I love it and am thankful to have it in my [at-home] workout arsenal.",1347840000,,1255,4.373390557939914
3710262,5,B001N2WISQ,"It is a great workout video.  I highly recommend it, even for beginners :) It has helped me get into shape and lose weight and I have only been using it for 4 weeks.",1347840000,,165,3.8529411764705883
3710263,5,B001N2WISQ,"I have a collection of Jillian's DVDs, including 30 day shred, yoga melt down, and banish fat. Love them all, and this video becomes one of my favorites now. It gives you a great ""total body circuit"" training, from head to toe! I have strength training classes at the gym twice a week, and if I miss a class or feel like doing something extra, I pick up this video. I have pretty good fitness level with years of training, and still this video makes me sweat a bucket!

Jillian is always inspiring and encouraging in her training. Two things that she says and I love the most in this video:
- ""Focus on the muscles you are training."" ""Visualize the change in those problem areas.""
That makes the workout easier because you are recruiting those targeted muscles, instead of tensing up other areas as compensation.
- Eat healthy. Don't ruin your hard work by eating badly.

When you choose this workout, you are on the right track of a healthy lifestyle. Keep it up, folks!",1347148800,,971,4.511363636363637
3710264,5,B001N2WISQ,There's absolutely no way not to be in a good shape if you do this work out on a regular basis! I've been working out with Jilian's 30 day shred and it made me feel so much better. Adding this work out to my daily routine is bringing it to a new level.,1347148800,,252,3.7735849056603774
3710265,5,B001N2WISQ,This is a heart-pumping workout that is good for beginners. Jillian does a great job of showing both beginner and advanced moves.,1346889600,,129,4.909090909090909
3710266,5,B001N2WISQ,"This is an excellent all-over body toning DVD that moves quickly enough through the exercises to keep your heart rate somewhat up.  I started to incorporate this DVD into my routine after alternating Levels 1,2, and 3 of the 30-day Shred for 4 workouts a week over the past 4 months.  I started to get a little bored with the Shred and felt like I wanted some more in-depth strength training to get more muscle definition.  This workout really delivers an effective strength training routine that makes sense for a woman's body.  I started seeing results after just a couple of weeks of doing this workout a couple of times a week, and I literally feel an increase in my strength each time I do this DVD.

I will continue to alternate it with the 30-day Shred workouts however, in order to keep getting that killer cardio and fast pace that the Shred provides.  No More Trouble Zones moves at a slower pace and is about 50 minutes from start to finish, so it is a greater time commitment and may not be practical to do more than a couple of times a week if you are busy or active in other ways.

I think that this DVD will be a favorite of mine for a long time and I will keep it in the rotation with some higher intensity cardio workouts for a great all-around routine.  I would definitely recommend this workout to anyone who is looking to get stronger and look better in (and out) of their clothes.",1346803200,,1401,4.361538461538461
3710267,5,B001N2WISQ,Hard workout at first totally worth it. The first time my body hurt I saw a difference in my muscle tone in good time I would recommend to everyone,1346284800,,147,4.103448275862069
3710268,5,B001N2WISQ,"I did not miss the cardio that Jillian usually provides in her circuit training vids like Ripped in 30 (RI30) or 30 Day Shred. I did not like RI30 due to some of the routines but more so Jillian's attitude. 30 Day Shred is awesome of which you get cardio, abs and strength but if you just want straight up strength training, get this video!

I run 7mi twice a week then once a week, zumba, boot camp & Bikram (hot) yoga so having a DVD (which I was looking for) that focuses on strength without cardio by Jillian is awesome. The actual workout is 45mins w/o the warm up and cool down. She includes some yoga, not much at all or over the top poses, in her cool down and I LOVE it. None of her other DVDs include these types of stretches as a cool down so thumbs up for that! I also LOVE having the option of playing the DVD w/ her instructions & music or music only and NO Jillian! Why didn't they make ALL of her DVDs like this?

If you're looking for cardio, this is not the DVD for you!",1345593600,,988,4.035714285714286

3710270,5,B001N2WISQ,"As always, I love Jillian Michaels and her workout DVDs. I purchased the 30 Day Shred about one year ago. I did the entire thing and felt amazing. I also am an avid jogger and do Pilates quite regularly. After my 50 lb weight loss goal was achieved (taking a little over a year and a mixture of exercise and diet modifications) I decided to keep this dvd as a ""fill in"" workout for days when I was pressed for time. After a year of doing this dvd, I decided  it was time to try another of Jillian's programs. I was told to check out Ripped in 30 due to the fact that it has the same structure as the 30 Day Shred. I ordered this DVD roughly a week ago and have been doing Level 1 every day since. I absolutely cannot say enough about how effective this program is! I already feel like my body is toning up even more, and I am so glad that I got back on another one of Jillians programs.

The 3-2-1 formula for this workout is familiar and one that I can see results from. As a busy single mother, I find that this style of workout fits nicely into my busy day. It is a challenging workout, but after mastering the 30 Day Shred, I feel that my stamina is high and I am able to complete this workout without any struggles.

In a nutshell, another fine DVD from Jillian Michaels. I would recommend this DVD to anyone, and will be trying the ab workout DVD next.",1344643200,,1358,4.097744360902255
3710271,4,B001N2WISQ,"After trying Jillian's DVD for beginners I decided to try this DVD, and it's a lot at first! The warmup alone leaves me out of breath, but I guess that's good. I like that you don't need any special equipment besides free hand weights; I don't even use a mat, just carpeted flooring. Jillian's instructions on proper form are especially helpful for me, since I am fairly new to exercising on a regular basis. I would purchase again, and may buy more DVDs of Jillian's in the future for variety!",1344470400,,494,4.5

I have noticed that my muscles are being used, especially a few I obviously haven't used, because I have been sore after the workout, mostly thigh muscles.  You can start off as easy or difficult, so I feel it is a good video for beginners and some advanced people.  I would definately recommend it!",1344211200,,411,4.368421052631579
3710273,4,B001N2WISQ,I love this video! I started working out every other day and after the first week I started seeing results..it was kind of hard for me at first and I was extremely sore after my first work out but my body got use to it after a while and it was totally worth it!!!,1343606400,,263,3.888888888888889

3710275,5,B001N2WISQ,"I consider myself an intermediate in terms of my health and fitness. I work out several times a week but just pilates and the elliptical. However, I've noticed in my 30s that things are starting to get flabby and I needed to kick it up a notch to tone up and look good in a bathing suit, not just skinny.

I only had 5 lb weights instead of the 3 lbs recommended for this video. Let me tell you, I could not finish the video. I had to pause after 20 minutes and take a break, but I had hit full muscle failure within another 5-10 minutes. I ordered 3 lb weights and that made all the difference. Now I can go through the entire workout, but it is still incredibly challenging and I can't do everything to full form - yet. But the results are QUICK. Just two weeks and I'm seeing a lot more definition.

If you're totally new to exercise, I wouldn't recommend this. I think it would be too challenging to the point of being demoralizing. You should at least be at the intermediate stage.  If you're a crossfitter or into P-90X and are at high levels of fitness, you can still do this video. Just add a few pounds to the weights you are supposed to use. The difference between 3 and 5 is enough to cause full body muscle failure, so I'm sure moving from 5 to ten would be enough to make this challenging even for the most seasoned athlete.",1342828800,4,1337,4.19455252918288

3710280,5,B001N2WISQ,"This is an amazing video with alot of great moves and some old school throwbacks, but they work!  This is my first week back on the exercise circuit after not doing ANYTHING for 4 years.  Prior to my four year break, I used to be a gym rat 6 days a week and took advanced dance class 20 hours a week.  So I know where my body used to be... needless to say, it's not anywhere close now.

That being said, I started this video like a true beginner because I didn't know how much my body would take right off the bat.  If you are new to Jillian or to exercise DVDs in general, I would highly recommend that you watch the segment first THEN perform it with her.  As other reviews have mentioned, Jillian doesn't really break down every movement but that's ok with me because once I get enough stamina to perform the entire workout without gulping for air, I don't want to be thrown off by alot of explanation babble.

So beginners, you can do this workout!  Just start with the warm-up, one segment, then the cool down.  Each day, you'll be able to do a different segment and slowly build up to the entire workout.  If you need to modify a position or lose the weights, do it.  You'll be your own cheerleader if you know you stuck with the day's workout than if you kill yourself trying to do one more weighted rep and injure yourself.  This progression also helps one part of your body have a small break while you work a different section every day until your body gets to the point where you can do more segments per day.

After a week of progressively building up to the whole video, I've still managed to lose 4 lbs. I'm sure it's mostly water weight, but it's encouraging nonetheless.  Can't wait to see what happens after a month of this kick-ass workout!  Thanks Jillian!!!",1341100800,5,1777,4.326283987915408
3710281,4,B001N2WISQ,"This is a really intense workout that makes you really burn and sweat. The first time I did this, I think I realized how out of shape I was AND how body crushing it would be. I literally had a hard time sitting and going up stairs dayS after the first workout. That's the negative, I couldn't do it again until a week later, and slowly I got a little better at it.  The second week, I could do it three times, and now I'm trying to do it four times a week. The video promotes losing 5 pounds in your first week and I trust you can with water weight, but it's getting up to doing it five times a week. We'll see. I like it so far, didn't give it a full five stars because I haven't been able to settle into a 4-5 times a week routine. I still think you need to mix additional, less body crushing cardio with this, and give your muscles a rest.",1340755200,2,842,3.9529411764705884

3710285,3,B001N2WISQ,"I have been doing the 30 days shred for about 6 weeks now (and I love it). I am comfortably on level 2 but not quite ready for the sumo ringer on level 3, so I decided to add NMTZ to my workout because it had great reviews. Let me first say that NMTZ is indeed a great workout for upper body and abs. I don't really feel it working on my legs, at least not the way the shred does.

What I really like about the shred is that Jillian explains every exercise in detail, what it's called, what you have to do (right body position etc) and which muscles you train. Then you have those two ladies in the background, Anita and Natalie, who either do the beginner's or advanced style of the exercises. And they do so at a reasonable speed.

In NMTZ, Jillian just calls out an exercise and then jumps into it, often without much explanation. I'm not very good at copying a movement if I don't know what body position and muscles to concentrate on, and I don't have a mirror in my workout space to see if I'm doing things right. I'm sure I don't always, and I hope that will improve once I'm more experienced with the exercises.
Secondly, there not really a beginner's version in many of the exercises. I usually follow the harder version as much as I can so that's okay for me but might be difficult for people that are new to Jillian's workouts.
Thirdly, many  of the repeats are being demonstrated too fast for me to keep up. It's true that the background ladies perform all exercises in perfect form, as far as I can tell, but I often cannot match their speed. For example, Jillian let's us do bicycle crunches and says 'slow and smooth', so I'm doing slow and smooth (and I don't mean sloooooow), then I look over and see the ladies pumping away like crazy. Another one, sideways lunches with arm raises .... they are going so fast I would loose my balance if I tried to keep up.

In summary, this workout DVD is a good addition to any full body workout you might already own but I would not use it as my only workout, nor if I were a beginner. As I said, NMTZ is great for abs and arms/shoulders. I am going to alternate between NMTZ and the shred.",1339977600,15,2145,4.224390243902439
3710286,4,B001N2WISQ,I really enjoy this workout - I started seeing more definition in my arms and legs within the first week. I have been working out for a long time and am in pretty good shape and this workout was definitely a challenge for me. Jillian's commentary is pretty good most of the time but I am at the point where I've played the DVD several times so I mostly tune it out now. She is pretty motivating though - and she keeps it real.,1339804800,,426,4.083333333333333

It is AWESOME.  My shoulders are toned; my arms are toned, my abs and my thighs and hips are toned.  The first time I did this video I could not get my body off the floor during the side planks in the last circuit but a few attempts later and I had done it.

I have heard good things about her line of videos, but the expectation that you are buying a professionally made DVD that will play in all devices seems like a pretty basic one.",1339372800,6,448,4.114942528735632
3710289,4,B001N2WISQ,"First let me start by saying I'm not a workout buff by any means. I wanted to start working out and the title of this DVD caught my attention, so I began using it. As a beginner, I found the moves themselves to be easy to execute, but I did have to gradually build up resistance and endurance to be able to perform all the reps. It definitely kicked my butt in the beginning, which I thought was great! I did a little bit each day until I was able to do the complete DVD in its entirety. After only a little over a month of doing this DVD daily (with no other workout), people started commenting on my ""ripped"" arms and abs, and asked me if I had been working out. This video definitely produces noticeable results! Using this DVD by itself and eating healthy is enough to start noticing changes. Moreover, it's not a long workout, so it's great for people who are crunched for time. Now that I'm more advanced, I've moved onto other DVDs, but this was great to begin with and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone. The only issue I had with it (and it's why I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5) is that she loses count of the reps...so sometimes she will do 14 reps on one side and 11 on another. But, with that being said, I didn't think it was a huge deal - I just had to remember to count myself.",1339286400,8,1300,4.142292490118577

I think I will invest in the 3lb weights and see how far I get :)  So far, I have done the workout twice, and feel like I kicked my own arse both times! You can really feel the areas you are working.

It could also be because I used 5 pounds weights (the only ones I had) instead of three pounds, so I would definitely recommend following the instructions on this one.

With nothing more than two 3-pound dumbells, a mat and sneakers, Jillian Michaels shows you the workout that will give you killer abs, ass, and arms in a very short period of time. I've sent this DVD over to my mother, but I use my favorite exercises when working out alone at home. There are 7 sets, but those not used to such rigorous routines can just start off with two or three or four and move on up.

It is hard but the results are very satisfying.  I have gained strength, endurance, and defined muscles in my legs, stomach, arms, sides, even neck.  Not bulky, Arnold muscles - just toned.  My college aged daughters started doing it after seeing my results and my teenage son started comparing his arms to mine!  I have had lots people comment on how my figure has changed.  Even had strangers say how I must be blessed genetically to stay slim at 49.  It is work, but the results make it totally worthwhile.

No more trouble zones is an excelent workout for toning your body, it is about 50 minutes long with a warm up and cool down included.

That being said i did find this one challenging yet not impossible, you can def feel your muscles working but it is not cardio focused where you are out of breath the entire time.  I did this DVD for an entire month 6 days a week and the results were awesome!!  I didn't lose much weight but I lost a ton of inches and really sculpted my muscles more!!

Yes - Jillian has a tendency to yap a lot, but, I really love her exercises, she means what she says. I am sure that I will see some good results soon. I want to get to 123 lbs, which is my goal weight, and hope to accomplish that by doing JM's DVDs. They are cheap ($6 - $11 max), you don't have to spend $90 to $100 a month on gym membership.

3710309,5,B001N2WISQ,"I have been doing this workout now for several months. I did 30 day shred then was looking for something more intense and longer so I purchased this and Banish Fat Boost metabolism. I currently do NMTZ 3 times a week alternating with  cardio 3+ times a week - BFBM,breathless body, or running. I am 5'3 and 147 pounds, I've lost about 5 lbs since I started this regime and am a lot more toned. Gone from size 8 to 6. I eat healthy but have trouble staying on low calorie diets. I'm sure if I had the will power to go 1200-1400 I would have lost a lot more.

Pros of this workout :
1. Easy to follow, basic exercises that work
2.  customizable - started out with lighter weights and am now up to ten lbs. When it gets easy again, I know it's time to add another pound or two on. Also there are periods when she gives you mini rests and you can add extra reps, or during the pushups, double time it to her count, etc. lots of places you can amp it up as it gets easier with time... or if you're a super beginner than you can only do half the reps, or use tiny weights, etc.
3. Not loud- I don't want to irritate the neighbors but I do this at 8am guilt free
4. Doesn't take up much space
5. Good results
6 . I quite like how the first 4 sets are the hardest and then you cruise home on last three. It's like... make it the 30 minutes.. then... well might as well keep doing the rest,since you've done all the really hard stuff.
Cons -
1. Uneven sets. the counting does get off - I just alternate starting legs. Do all sets starting on right one day, then switch left the next time, so it'll all balance.
2. I find some of the ab moves just don't seem to really work me out, the plank twists, tried and tried, and now just sub exercises I can feel the burn on

I found i had more energy and wanted to start exercising. so for the last three weeks or so i have been doing NMTZ, i chose this based on the great reviews. i have done exercise videos before and kind of expected not to get any results, just wanted a boost to lose those last few pounds. wow, was i surprised!! i have now completed this workout 8 times. after the first 2, i realized that something amazing was happening and my body was already changing, so i started taking my measurements. (wish i had done that before the first workout but didn't really think about it then). so i measured after 2 workouts and after 8 workouts, just out of self-curiousity. here's what happened: i have lost 4.5 lbs and about 5.5 inches, mostly from my abs (baby weight). needless to say, i am blown away! i have dropped several sizes in clothing and feel great, i am only 7 lbs away from my goal weight! i will update this review after my 16th workout for comparison purposes. Get it, do it, you won't regret it!! Thanks jillian!

UPDATE!!!!: April 30, 2012. i lost count of how many times i have done this video but since it had been a month since my first review, i decided to measure today, i got unbelievable results!!! i have lost 5 more inches and about 5 more lbs in 1 month. jillian is incredible!!! i really like how she works your muscles from every angle so that no matter how your trouble zone is shaped, it is gonna get blasted. Thanks jillian! i'll be ready for the beach in no time!!!",1333065600,10,1632,4.350819672131148
3710315,4,B001N2WISQ,"I just tried out Jillian's No More Trouble Zones DVD last night, and boy am I feeling it today. I wouldn't consider myself a beginner (I've been working out for the past 4 months, so I'm no expert) but I thought the DVD was very challenging. Jillian only uses 3lb weights so I should've known it'd be tough. All I had was a pair of 5lb dumbbells, so it was pretty tough. She recommends working out 5 days a week, but I think I'll have to build up to that. Overall, I like the DVD since it forces you to push yourself.",1332892800,,517,4.078431372549019
3710316,5,B001N2WISQ,There's a reason this DVD is so popular -- it's great for toning.  The ab segment is particularly good (and hard!).  Love this work out.,1332806400,,136,4.4
3710317,5,B001N2WISQ,"This was one of the first workout DVDs I tried, and up to this point I've tried about 15 different ones -- a lot of them Jillian Michaels. This is definitely my favorite. It was really challenging at first, when I was new to working out and even now after months of keeping up with exercising 4-5 days a week, I've improved, but its still challenging! I like that there are modifications for beginners and advanced in a lot of the moves and of course, you can always increase the weight to make it harder. This workout really feels complete - like my entire body is challenged, from biceps, to triceps, to abs, butt and legs. And I'm sweating the whole time! And at about 45 minutes all together, I feel like its a substantial workout, without being TOO long. (Gotta squeeze it into my busy schedule!)",1332633600,,801,4.45578231292517
3710318,5,B001N2WISQ,"Wow! Jillian sure does make you work in this one! This is one of my favorite workout dvd's, when you're done, you feel like everything is really worked! If you want to feel like you've had a great workout at home, I suggest you give this dvd a try :)",1332547200,,250,4.02
3710319,5,B001N2WISQ,"I like to work out 4-6 times a week.  I was getting bored of my old workout DVD's and decided to give Jillian a try. OMG! I thought I was in pretty good shape, but she made me feel some muscles I never knew I had. And I love it!!!  If you are a beginner, take it slow and work your way up to the full DVD. Don't stop because your sore, do the warm ups and get loose and enjoy. I have been using it two weeks and I already see a difference.  Thank You Jillian for giving this almost 50 year old the best body ever !!! I have more energy, I can tackle anything from running up the stairs at work to raking leaves to taking long bike rides. Be sure to watch your diet, eat healthy, get lots of colors in your foods (fruits & veggies) and stay away from the Whites (rice, flour, potatoes, sugars, etc.)  All I can say is... LMJ (Love My Jillian).",1332460800,,842,3.9352941176470586
3710320,5,B001N2WISQ,"this is by far the most effective workout i've done in terms of muscle definition. i definitely sweat a lot while doing this and i've seen results after using it for only 4 times. while i haven't tried insanity/p90x and hence can't compare, i think this should be a ""must at least once a week"" for every woman :)
warning: not for beginners!!!",1332460800,,342,4.444444444444445
3710321,4,B001N2WISQ,"I definitely like a lot of the moves and find them challenging, so I'll probably integrate them into other workouts (maybe sometimes changing out the moves in ""shred"" or ""ripped"" for variety). BUT, if you've been doing ""30-day Shred"" or ""Ripped in 30"" for a while, well, you'll barely break a sweat on this one! (I just finished, and I'm really not sweating, nor do I feel absolutely SPENT, like I do after ""ripped"" - in a GREAT way!) What I really missed was all of the cardio that you see in her usual 3-2-1 circuits in ""shred"" and ""ripped"", because THAT'S what KILLS you on TOP of everything else, when you feel as if you can go no further but then you HAVE TO - and then you're right back into the exercises again!! Guess I just love that whole format! So, I guess if you're new to Jillian or are just starting out exercising, this is a good place to start. Or, if you're looking to incorporate some new exercises into your routine, it's good for that, too, and has some great ones to target the areas you need! After this (or perhaps at the same time, doing the modified versions), a beginner should probably move to ""30-day Shred"" and then to ""Ripped in 30"". Overall, LOVE Jillian's stuff (with the exception of her new kickboxing one - at almost 43 with prior shoulder, hip, and knee repetitive use and heavy weightlifting injuries, it's just TOO hard on one's joints with all of the pivoting and twisting, and I just think the learning curve is way too high for me to want to invest my time in learning all of the punches and kicks, even if I WERE physically capable of doing it!)
ADDENDUM: One day after doing NMTZ, I have changed my opinion slightly. While I DID miss the cardio and the lack of a 3-2-1 format, BOY DID I FEEL THE EFFECT ON MY MUSCLES THE NEXT DAY, especially lower body! I felt tighter everywhere (even to TOUCH, including my hamstrings and butt!), and when I tried to do a higher level on ""ripped"" (level 3), I HAD to stop, because I simply COULD NOT do it - my legs were BURNING from NMTZ! (And I NEVER quit ANYTHING!) So, definitely a good workout to incorporate in your usual routine!!",1331942400,,2116,4.373096446700508
3710322,3,B001N2WISQ,"While I think in time this will be a great workouts, there should be a warning on it: If you have not worked out in a long time, or are just starting out, don't start with this one. The first few circuits aren't too bad (I still couldn't complete all of the exercises, though) but once you get into circuit four, the moves get super challenging and if you don't already have some strength and endurance built up, you're not going to be able to do the exercises -- and you could get hurt attempting them. After a few weeks or months of regular workouts though, this will be a good addition.",1331856000,4,589,4.267857142857143

3710324,5,B001N2WISQ,"As stated in my other reviews, I love Jillian! Having done BFBM consistently for 6 months I decided to add another tape to my collection. 50 minutes (not counting the cool down), this delivers a great workout. I am 25, 5'5 115lb and workout 6 days a week with Bikram Yoga, Running, Plyometrics and doing this tape with 5 pound weights (instead of 3) kicked my butt.  It is a fun workout and her circuits fly by effectively working EVERY muscle! It isn't as jumpy as BFBM so it is a nice alternate. My sisters and I swear by Jillian and actually look forward to her workouts, that alone makes it worth it!",1331769600,,604,4.345132743362832

3710326,5,B001N2WISQ,"I like that you are given the option of doing the full, 40-minute workout or breaking it out into 5-minute circuits. She emphasizes proper form throughout the workout, minimizing risk of injury. Each circuit works multiple muscle groups, making for an efficient, effective workout. I recommend starting with very light weights until you are accustomed to the moves, so you can concentrate on form.",1330992000,,397,5.21875
3710327,5,B001N2WISQ,"I first tried this workout on Comcast's On Demand and loved it!  Of course then they took it off of On Demand, so I ordered the DVD.  She really kicks your butt with an overall body workout.  I like that she incorporates lower body & upper at the same time.  You really feel it the next day.  Would definitely recommend if you like overall strength training with weights & floor exercises.  It won't disappoint.",1330992000,,411,4.486486486486487
3710328,5,B001N2WISQ,"I just got this DVD, so I can't really speak to its long-term effectiveness, but I've done it twice now and it is definitely a tough one. I've been doing 30 Day Shred for 2 months and wanted something longer for when I had more time. The total time clocks in at 55 minutes. 45 of those are actually working out with a 5 minute warm up and 5 minutes of stretching. It definitely isn't for beginners. There aren't a ton of modifications like there are in 30 Day Shred. If you are just getting started working out, I would start with the shred but if you've finished that or are looking to add in some longer strength training workouts, this is a great DVD.",1330732800,,654,4.24
3710329,5,B001N2WISQ,"This video provides one of the best strength training exercises you can do at home and without equipment.  All three levels are challenging and are definitely worth the 22 minutes.  Tried the level three for the first time this past week and believe me, it is hard.  Will have to go back to level one and two for a bit longer to get strong enough to complete all the exercises in level three correctly.  Since the workout is short, there should be no reason to get one in each day.  I do mine every other day and then right afterwards I add at least 30 and most the time 45 minutes of straight cardio on the treadmill.  The video definitely gets your heart pumping and enhances your cardio workout.  Definitely a must buy!",1330732800,,722,4.383458646616542
3710330,5,B001N2WISQ,"Jillian Michaels never disappoints.  This workout can be done by any age group.  Easy on the joint and with proper diet, you can see the results.  This DVD can also be used as a maintaince workout.",1330473600,,197,4.416666666666667
3710331,2,B001N2WISQ,I have had this dvd for like a year and tried it twice. I got through it the first time but couldn't complete all of the sets without stopping for breaks.

3710332,5,B001N2WISQ,"I own 30 day shred, Banish Fat/Boost Metabolism, Yoga Meltdown and this.  I like this one the best.  I love/hate Jillian throughout this DVD because she is pushing me to do things I wouldn't ever do on my own...it hurts so good.  The very short rests are just enough to keep me going.  When short on time I will do 30 Day Shred.  This DVD is so cheap and SO WORTH BUYING!!  My forearms were sweating!!!  Wear a sweat band or you will drip sweat from your head for sure like I did...or workout in front of a fan.
I love that she said 'do not erase what you did here today with eating poorly'.  SO TRUE!!!  I feel every trainer should say that with every workout DVD - no they should SCREAM IT.  I have seen a personal trainer in the past and I have learned the hard way that 80% of being fit is WHAT YOU PUT IN YOUR MOUTH.  Please remember that!
I am excited to see results from this DVD!

At first she thought it was too easy.  But after trying it a few times and increasing the reps, she said that it has helped and she was sore in some of the areas like her butt.  She found Jillian doesn't do enough reps for her.",1329868800,,389,3.825

Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the Biggest Loser, but in this workout her tone just really bugged me! I recommend getting the DVD but muting her and just having the background music when working out. Other than that, it's a great workout to switch up a P90X/TurboFire routine:)",1329782400,2,363,4.6875

I'm 52 and reasonably fit but I found myself sweating and breathing hard after about 10 minutes in. The moves aren't difficult and Ms. Michaels does a good job describing what you are doing and why. Some of the moves that require jumping are too much for me so I just modify them to suit me. I love that it combines cardio with weights and mat work. I really feel like I've done a complete work out when I'm done. I try to do this video at least 3 times a week and incorporate it with 2 others from Prevention that I use. If you are totally out of shape this would probably be too much for you but if you're even semi-fit (and active)you should be able to master it after a few sessions.",1329091200,4,803,4.056603773584905

There are 5 circuits to complete, each two times and they seriously target all the trouble zones.  Jillian shows a bit of a softer side in this one and demonstrates alternative moves that you can do if you are a beginner (without the implied guilt!).

I cannot jump and the only modification I needed was in the warm up. It is a full body workout and good for any level. If it feels too easy - you can always add some more weight.

I started out with the kettlebells series and have been using 5 - 7 pound weights with other videos.  I tried to use my 5 pounders with this and could not keep up.  Luckily I also have 1 pound wrist weights which I finished with.  In other words this is a good workout even without weights.  As other reviewers mentioned ""the surrender"", I cannot imagine using 5 pound weights with that move.  She recommends 2-3 pound weights for a reason.  I have to go buy some 2 or 3 pounders now!  Anyway if a person did this video every day, there is no way they wouldn't lose weight.  It is a tough video but I enjoyed it all the same.  No matter what the video is, I like to switch it up to keep things interesting but I will definitely do this one at least once a week.  She hits all the problem areas especially for women.

3710352,5,B001N2WISQ,"I bought the Banish Fat/Boost Metabolism, Trouble Zones and this DVD to avoid a repetitive workout regimen.  I do a different workout each day and I believe the results are there.  I feel more toned and therefore, stronger and also my stamina is improving.  She alternates cardio (jumping, burpees, kickboxing, etc.) strength training (with weights for your butt, thighs and arms), and ab work.  My core strength is improving as well.  I generally didn't like plank moves before (because they're hard for me), but they're very effective and worth the effort.  These videos are all about circuits and therefore, nothing is long and drawn out and the workout goes by quickly.  You feel alive!
I think the 3 workouts she offers in the 30 day shred are great because they're 20 minutes long each and kick your butt (the 2nd and 3rd especially).  Anything becomes easier the more you do it, so to avoid a repetitive workout regimen, I alternate this video with the other 2 dvds (Banish and Trouble Zones).  Those have 40 minute workouts, so depending on how much time you have or your ambition level for the day, you can choose what works for you.  I sometimes do workout 2 and 3 from the 30 day shred if I want a longer workout, but each of them will get your blood pumping and you will break a sweat.
I think the key is, with any workout regimen, to mix things up.  I would get bored doing the same dvd everyday and so would my body- it's true that your body develops memory and you will stop seeing results if you settle into the same routine everyday.  The 30 day shred is good to this effect though because you can alternate between the 3 workouts.  So, it's a good way to go if you're only going to pick one dvd.",1325721600,2,1713,4.451923076923077

I have done Martial Arts for 7 1/2 years and was in the Military as well for 6 years and I have to say I have not felt pain like this since Boot Camp or conditioning for Tournaments. I would say I was in pretty good shape when doing these videos but man I felt like I had never worked out in my life after these videos thats for sure. I have done P 90 X as well as Insanity and yes while those are good work outs they become tedious, repeative and long. I am like most people I don't like just pure cardio, I'm not someone who enjoys senary while running, walking and or jogging I'm just thinking to myself am I almost done. Yes this video has Cardio there was times I was out of breath but not the cardio as in running you are just constantly moving around plus you are following what she is doing so it's keeping your mind busy. I also like that she has two levels of work out because some work out videos can be very discouraging seeing these people do these exercises with no problems and you can't keep up. I highly recommend this work out dvd I love everything she has incorporated into it as well as the pace she takes through the whole video...steady",1325635200,3,1445,4.073684210526316

My goal is to upgrade to 5lb weights but that seems like a long shot from now LOL. But let me tell you this video will be deemed as the BEST video Jillian Michaels EVER made.

I had already conquered her '30 Day Shred' DVD (yes, all three levels) and I wanted a bigger challenge; a longer workout, too.  This DVD delivered it.  I was so flippin sore the first two days (and mind you, I've been working out for over a year - that includes weight training 3x's a week as well).  For me to be that sore was amazing to me because I can't really remember the last time I was THAT sore.  Do NOT shy away from this video, even if you are a beginner.  Take is slow and just do less reps.  Do the beginner's versions of the exercises if you must, but don't give up on this one.  Jillian will deliver what she promises - just stick with it.  I owe my 75 pound weight loss to Jillian Michaels.  I do this DVD 4x a week and weight train 3x a week.  She burned a lot of fat off this body.  I don't have much left, but I know that I will reach my weight loss and fitness goals with the help of Jillian's DVD's.

Keep making them, Jillian - and keep them challenging!!",1325548800,6,1116,4.055045871559633
3710357,5,B001N2WISQ,"This is a great workout! Even though it's technically a ""toning"" workout, it gets your heart rate up enough that you feel like you've done cardio at the same time. Jillian accomplishes this by combining upper-body strength moves with lower-body moves simultaneously, which raises your heart rate and burns fat.

What's great about this workout is you can do it any time you want and you can do it from the comfort of your home without having to drive to the gym. All you need is a mat and two hand weights (mine are 5-pound dumbbells although they use 3-pound in the DVD). In fact, this workout is so great and it covers all the key areas, I'm thinking of canceling my gym memberships.

I bought this Jillian Michaels DVD first, then I bought her other DVDs -- Ripped in 30, 30-Day Shred and Extreme Shed and Shred. So far, this is still my favorite workout although you need about an hour for it. Still, I drink the most water and use my sweat towel the most while doing this workout. You will truly feel like you've worked out and you'll feel that ""workout high"" (endorphin rush) after doing it.",1325289600,5,1097,4.48
3710358,4,B001N2WISQ,"I have been doing this dvd 6 days a week for 3 weeks. I had spent 6 weeks on 30 Day Shred and am thin so I haven't lost weight to speak of but have gained a lot of muscle and definition, particularly in my backside and no longer have ""wings"" under my arms (recent 35 pound weight loss). Jillian is very chatty in this dvd which can be tiresome but I count on hearing what she says as I am too busy exercising to keep my eye on the dvd.

This dvd is hard on the knees, I wish Jillian offered a little more instruction on how to push off the heel (had to figure that out by watching her) and form in general, everyone knows not to put the knee over the toe. There is also a knee warm up that Jillian offers on 30 Day Shred that helped A LOT, I do that before NMTZ starts and my knees don't hurt like they did when I first started.

I prefer the friends she has on 30 Day Shred...Kristen on this dvd is annoying (isn't there always one that irritates?).

I have to give credit where credit is due though and say that my body looks pretty good for a 48 year old woman (abs...biceps...firm legs) and it is ALL due to Jillian Michaels and her 30 Day Shred dvd and this one. I have others and look forward to trying them out.",1324425600,5,1218,3.963265306122449
3710359,5,B001N2WISQ,"The first several weeks of doing this workout, I was EXHAUSTED afterward, each time!  It really took a lot out of me.  But NMTZ, along with other Jillian Michaels dvds, allowed my body to become accustomed to it.  It's still a challenge, and it's still effective after several months.  It's never easy, but it became more doable with time.

There isn't as much up and down, up and down, up and down (standing vs on your back) as in 30 Day Shred.  There's mat work, but it's generally clumped together in the same circuits.  NMTZ combines upper and lower body at the same time for maximum effectiveness (calorie and fat burn).  Excellent for the upper arms, quads, thighs and glutes.

I usually do NMTZ when I don't feel like doing high impact cardio.  There are only a couple of the exercises here that I avoid, for different reasons. Surrenders really bother my knees, and pushups strain my upper body too much, leading to pain.  Otherwise...challenge yourself and stick with it, you will see results.",1324339200,5,1002,4.7011494252873565
3710360,5,B001N2WISQ,"It's the first time that I bought a workout DVD and it exceeded all expectations. This workout is absolutely tough and there is no way that you won't sweat like crazy. But afterwards you feel absolutely great. At my first workout session I was sore for a whole week, but I loved it. I totally recommend this workout to everyone who doesn't believe in workout DVDs and who would like to get convinced. ;)",1324166400,,403,4.45945945945946
3710361,5,B001N2WISQ,Love Jillian! She will give you the results that you desire if you stick with the plan and are consistent. I've had this dvd for over a year. Will return to using it soon!,1323475200,,171,4.0588235294117645
3710362,5,B001N2WISQ,"I have had this DVD for almost a year now and as embarrassing as it may be to admit, I realized this past week that I own all of Jillian Michaels' DVDs except for her newest one that came out this past year. I have been a huge Jillian fan for the past few years and gave her a shot after reading countless customer reviews and seeing the tremendous following/support for ""30 Day Shred"". As an avid runner, I was looking to add in a toning workout after coming in from long run and a long workout for the days where I just want to cross train. Thankfully, Jillian delivers both! ""No More Trouble Zones"" and ""Banish Fat Boost Metabolism"" are those longer workouts I alternate between for my cross training days. While ""No More..."" is focused on toning and weight training, ""Banish Fat.."" is its compliment with more of a cardio focus. However, combined both of them will make you look slim and toned. I think my biggest fear with incorporating weight training DVDs has been getting bulky and muscular, instead of the ideal-- thin and defined frame I am going for.

I happened to take a hiatus from exercising the past few months and decided to re-start my commitment to weight loss by throwing in ""No More Trouble Zones"" into the DVD player. Immediately, I could feel myself feeling like I was already working off some of the pounds and even after I finished the workout--for the next 48hrs or so, I was unable to move, walk, or easily get around due to how sore my muscles were. But, with a little Advil, hydration, and R&R the soreness went away and what appeared--already--was a toner, firmer butt, thighs, abs, and arms. I thought I may have convinced myself I was seeing things until my boyfriend even commented that I looked more tone already.

With all this said, I definitely reccommend adding this DVD to your exercise regimen. You really will see results rapidly. Speaking as someone who owns almost every JM DVD, and has had experience with each, all of them are universally amazing at making results appear and motivating you throughout. As much as she may bark at you or start giving you inspirational advice while you are panting, feeling your thigh muscles shake and wondering how much longer until cool down--it really is all worth it in the end.

If you are looking for a shorter workout, (instead of a 7 circuit, 45 minute workout) for those days you don't want to workout as much or want to do  some toning after a long run or some other activity, I recommend doing a level of ""Ripped in 30"", ""30 Day Shred"", ""Yoga Meltdown"", or ""6 pack Abs""",1323388800,3,2558,4.542299349240781
3710363,5,B001N2WISQ,"My best friend and long time work out buddy got the 30 day Shred to help get us thru the winter blues of working out in Iowa during the winter.  That jump started us to get No More Trouble Zones and 3 other DVD's to use this winter.  No More Trouble Zones is super challenging, but doable!  She encourages you thru it and kicks your butt at the same time.  I feel real change in my body since starting to use it- more toned arms, lifted butt & tighter legs and my core is getting stronger by the day.  I love Jillian; however, do appreciate the option to run the video without her commentary so after doing it for a while you can just listen to music.  (I know you can put the TV on mute normally, but I think this option is great!).  Also you can choose to do the whole video of skip around to the trouble zone section you want to focus on.  If you are looking to tone up and lose fat, try this.",1323388800,,896,3.99438202247191
3710364,5,B001N2WISQ,"I wasn't sure I'd been a Jillian fan, but this workout sold me.

I live on the 4th floor of my apartment building, so I try to find exercises that won't send me bouncing around the place and disturbing my downstairs neighbor. This and my kettlebell DVD are pretty much the best for this, as there's is little to no jumping - just a lot of toning, lunging, and squatting.  (People who have big knee issues should be forewarned).

This is a 40+ min workout that is pretty killer. You'll want 3 pound weights for this.

All DVDs can kick your rear at first, mostly because you might be coming from a low-exercise background, or they're working areas you hadn't really hit before. This one keeps kicking your rear because even when you're endurance is up, it's really just a great all-over and unforgiving workout.

The only downside you might have is that Jillian doesn't keep count very often - instead she'll break off and either offer encouragement to keep it up or go over proper technique.  This wasn't an issue for me, but I know some people really want that countdown.",1323388800,,1072,4.557291666666667
3710365,4,B001N2WISQ,"WOW!!! This workout is INTENSE to say the least! I own several of Jillian's DVDS, and in my opinion, this is one of the hardest. It truly is amazing though, I finished the entire workout feeling like I did an extremely great job of hitting my trouble zones. The DVD contains a warm up, 6 circuits targeting different areas, and a cool down. You also have an option to pick which circuits you specifically want to do if you do not have time or want to run through the whole DVD. My only complaint is she doesn't really give a whole lot of ""beginner"" modifications. There are certain things I could not do full out like all of them and would have really appreciated a modification. She does give a few, but not as many as in 30 Day Shred or Ripped in 30. Overall, this is a really great buy and I am excited to see the results. I plan on doing this DVD 2-3 times a week, switching between her other DVDS....love Jillian Michaels!!",1322784000,,928,4.278409090909091
3710366,5,B001N2WISQ,This workout kicked my butt! I barely made it through the last circuit but I pushed through. Jillian Michaels is no joke and when she says she'll work you hard she means it. This workout is not for beginners. I've done her other workouts and this one by far will have you panting. I plan on adding this dvd into my workout routine and hope to see some good results in the next couple of weeks.,1322697600,,393,4.184210526315789
3710367,5,B001N2WISQ,Jillian Michaels pushes you long and hard. I would advise being somewhat in shape before trying this or your muscles will be screaming at you in pain. This dvd tones and helps you decrease you bad zones. I did it for a month while my husband was gone and when he came back he noticed I lost weight. You can't expect immediate results. You have to keep using it to get the best results. Also I would recommend a slight change in diet too. Not a huge one just reach for carrots instead of chips. Good Luck!,1322611200,,504,4.206185567010309
3710368,5,B001N2WISQ,Great workout-  love it.  Only problem is that the DVD will not let me back up.  Definitely worth the price for the workout.  She uses new moves I've never used before.,1322438400,,168,4.32258064516129
3710369,5,B001N2WISQ,"When I don't have a lot of time but I know I need to do a little toning, I reach for The 30 Day Shred (roughly 20-minute workouts, buy that one too!), but when I have a little more time, I'd *much* rather do this video. Jillian is a great trainer-- she knows EXACTLY when to push you through. It took me a while to do the complete video; the second to last circuit has a series of plank movements that I can finally do after months of giving up; I would fill in the time with extra weighted sit-ups and such... but that's what it's about, working up to it. I like that she does a lot of work on the arms and abs in this (arms, like a lot of women, seem to be my trouble zone-iest trouble zone!), and it definitely pays off. I'm a cook and I'm on my feet all the time so my legs are pretty strong, but they definitely look more toned.

If you're someone who doesn't work out much, this will most likely be rough in the beginning, but like anything in life, you have to be positive and have faith in your strength. Put in the work, and you'll be shocked at how quickly you see results. If you already work out, this will be a nice go-to video for when you think you need some weight training and want to work up a nice sweat. You will need a mat (wear shoes people!), and there's a move she does call ""Surrenders"" which are BRUTAL(-ly effective!), and I put a blanket down so my knees don't get sore. All in all, great video, great workout. Jillian never fails me.

Im trying to do anything & everything to get back to pre pregnancy weight & avoid a tummy tuck.

Im not a Jillian fan. I do think her exercises work but they are really intense.
Due to my bad knees, even in proper form I cannot do a lot of lunges, etc...Jillian's videos are full of them.
Ive only done this video once after my fit friend told me it was more 'relaxed'. That is it not. I could not complete the video & stopped several times.
I was not able to do a diaper change after this video without taking a break from bending over.
It certainly works though.
I also hate repetition & get bored easily so the fact that the circuits are repeated twice bothers/bores me.
You cant deny the effectiveness though.",1321574400,,785,4.24

I was hesitant to get this DVD because it is a 40 minute workout, which is a big jump from the others that I have done of hers. However, after reading some other reviews that people had written, it sounded like it would be a great fit for me. Well...it is! I love this workout! Her circuit training is awesome! There is also the option (for those of you that don't want to do the full 40 minutes) for you to select individual circuits. I haven't done that. I always do the full 40 minutes and I feel amazing when I am done. After 4 pregnancies, my trouble zone is my ""mommy tummy"" and even after all of the other DVD's that I have completed, I am still not completely satisfied with my tummy.

I haven't been able to carve out significant chunks of time to work out, so it's really helpful to be able to do just 15-20 minutes at a time.  This DVD makes that very simple.  Each circuit focuses on a different area of the body, so you can change your workouts each day to focus on something different.

She's tough, but gives good cues and lots of options for beginners and for the more advanced.",1319760000,,541,4.264705882352941

This isn't any cardio so if someone is looking for that, then this is the wrong video!

I generally prefer running and other such exercises outside, but since the weather is starting to get not so pretty and the idea of going back to a treadmill is not something that makes me want to continue being active, I decided to give Jillian a try.  I read an article in Self with her and did some of the exercises she listed in there and felt pretty challenged.  My goodness did this kick my butt even more!  And getting through it with her encouraging you to think about why you chose to do it in the first place makes you not want to give up on yourself.  I won't lie--I did have to modify and even sit out a few exercises the first couple times I did it, but I have tried each time to do the exercises and feel so good about myself when I am able to finally get them right!

I was in shape before this dvd, and I do it about 3 times a week, but now my arms are even more defined because of this dvd. I use 5lb weights and burn about 300 calories when completing the entire routine.

I like that there are individual circuits but wish I could pick 5 or six and customize a workout. Need to keep going back to menu to pick next circuit.
Target had this DVD for $14.99 + tax. I ""google goggled"" it and presto, Amazon popped up with a nearly 1/2 price savings! Ordered in the store from my phone. Got it the next day. If only my sagging butt could be cured that fast! Lol.",1317513600,,674,4.2734375
3710384,3,B001N2WISQ,"I expected I was going to love this workout since A) I enjoyed 30 Day Shred and Jillian and B) across 500+ reviews it has practically a 5-star rating. As I got started with the workout, I kept waiting for the ""this is great. feel the burn. what a workout. oh yeah."" feeling, but it just never came. I found the workout to be really (painfully) boring and the music even more so. I founding myself constantly watching the clock trying to will myself through the end. Physically, it was challenging enough, but I definitely have more intense videos. 25-30 minutes of Shred feels way more intense and much more like a calorie scorcher than this was. Personally, I would have rather spent my almost hour at a Body Pump class. Way more intense and enjoyable. Perhaps I'll see if a homemade music playlist will up the enjoyment factor.

Don't mean to be such a downer. I really wanted to love it, but I just didn't. I'm giving it three stars because I'm sure if you did it 5 days a week like recommended, you'd see some body changes. That is if you can motivate yourself to do the workout 5 days a week. This is definitely not a workout that it will make it easy jump out of bed instead of hitting the snooze button at 5 AM.

I'm hoping I won't be equally disappointed with Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, another Jillian DVD, which I'm also trying this week.

Random aside, the first two pictures shown on the amazon.com product page must be for another video. At no point in NMTZ do you do kickbox style kicking. At least not on my copy of the product. Must be from a different video.",1317427200,4,1577,4.375426621160409

3710394,5,B001N2WISQ,"WOW! What a workout! I was going through Amazon's reviews and saw this DVD was ranked pretty high and thought I'd give it a try. I'm not a Jillian Michaels fan either but I sure have to give her props on this one!
A little advice for 1st time users, please note DO NOT use more weights than recommended. Stupid me used 10 lb weights and could barely move for a few days after. There's a reason she uses 3 lb weights. I should've known better but I tend to go overboard. But I highly recommend this to anyone!",1314057600,,508,4.141414141414141

3710396,5,B001N2WISQ,"This is my new FAVORITE work out video. I just bought this last week and I've used it every morning :)
I haven't worked out in a year and my goal is to lose 15lbs.
I was getting bored with going to the gym. I really like this type of circuit training because she has a bunch of different moves for the same body part. Also, you're only spending 2 minutes on each move. This video is actually a lot of fun and time goes by fast. You'll be dripping with sweat and feeling good after this workout!
Also, not a lot of jumping around so it's good for the knees. The 'cardio' is in the 5 minute warm up section.
This tape reminds me of a hard-core version of The Firm tapes. I love how she incorporates weights for maximum calorie burn :)
I'm already seeing definition in my tummy and my hamstrings are getting very firm! I never noticed that muscle in the back of my leg...cool!
Check out the 'no more trouble zone' video clips on youtube. That's what convinced me to buy it.

The workout is 40 minutes with a 5 minute warm up and cool down.
JM DVDs I have:
-No more trouble zones (My favorite)
-30 minute shred (2nd fav, still use it occasionally)
-Ripped in 30 (Has overly complicated moves, I like Shred much better)
-Banish Fat boost metabolism (Fun yet challenging 'cardio' for those don't like cardio much lol)

Update: March 2012
As of 10/13/11 I lost those 15lbs! I've lost a few more pounds since even though I stopped using the video last year.
Still thinking about posting before/after pictures on here.
Very happy with this purchase, well worth the $10!!",1313798400,9,1561,4.379310344827586

This dvd allows you to pick the circuit you want to do or do the full circuit (OUCH!!). Since I am OOS (out of shape), I started with the warm up circuit one day, then the next day I did the next circuit and so on. Yes it hurts, but here I am on the 3rd week and I am doing 2 circuits a day. I feel and see my body toning up. I just gradually do what I can do everyday. Some of the circuits hurt so I either modify it to make it easier for me or I slow it down a bit until I can actually do it.

3710406,5,B001N2WISQ,"I've lost 10 lbs (off 145) since graduating from 30DS to NMTZ 5 months ago.

I use NMTZ 1-2 times a week as part of a programme including 1-2 days' other cardio and (now) 1 day of heavier strength training. (FYI - you *need* strength to retain muscle while you're losing fat by either cutting cals or cardio. I do one day of heavier lifting to keep muscle strength; this excellent metabolic circuit is a great way to kick-start fat-burning and generate muscle *mass* [which is what more/lighter reps do].)

My only problem is finding another 45 minute conditioning programme. I know the 30-minute ones are popular, but I need 45 mins of caloric burn a day to create a deficit, because I suck at not eating. It would be great if Jillian did a serious, multi-week progressive programme, that we could maybe buy either one at a time or in a box set. If anyone's listening, my preference would be for low impact/no plyo, since I'm old and broken.",1311811200,,942,4.535294117647059
3710407,5,B001N2WISQ,"I am NOT a dvd workout person. For the past couple years, I have strictly just been a runner - I try to run 3-4 times a week for 4 miles at a time. I needed something to supplement my running when the weather isn't cooperative. I started looking at Jillian's dvds and saw what awesome ratings they all received and I decided to start trying them. I bought 6-week 6-pack, No Trouble Zones, & the 30-day Shred. I've done all of them so far and LOVE each one.

When I first did No Trouble Zones, I couldn't walk for 3 days. The circuits didn't necessarily hurt while I was doing them (i.e. all of the lunges), but WOW, it really worked out my butt muscles! The second time I did it, I took it a little easier and only did half of each of the lunges exercises and I was still pretty sore but was able to walk! My overall goal is not weight loss but to tone and I think that all of her dvds will definitely help.

I'm looking to buy her other dvds (Yoga, Burn Fat Boost Metabolism, & Ripped in 30) and my goal is to mix it up and do 1 each day in the morning before work & still run in the evening!",1311724800,2,1093,3.963636363636364

They seem to have the most balanced work-outs for building strength, flexibility, and endurance with cardio.  I like this WAAAAY better than 30 Day Shred.  This video does not use the 3-2-1 method, which I find to be too quick for proper toning.  This video has a great flow to it and lasts nearly an hour.  Afterwards I don't feel completely wore out (like I do with Bob) and I don't feel like I need more core work (like I do with Jackie).

I have read some reviews stating too hard on the knees but as with any workout, it makes it clear to know your limits, so obviously if you have problems in a certain area every workout is not for you.

3710411,5,B001N2WISQ,"I am a 50-year-old man who started doing Jillian Michaels's 30-day shred about four months ago. At the time I downloaded the first video, I did not even know who Jillian was, and selected the series on the strength of the excellent reviews from satisfied viewers. After diligently working through the three-episode series (ten days or so per level), I began to discover that I was developing a body I never thought possible for me. For years I had had love handles and man boobs that I had just learned to live with. Even though for years I had done 30 minutes of cardio several times a week, which I am convinced kept my weight somewhat under control and kept me reasonably fit, I just figured that a toned and firm body was out of my reach. Well, Jillian Michaels's system has changed that for me. After three months of the 30-day shred, I moved up to this one (which is nearly twice as long as each 30-minute 30-day shred episode), and I diligently work through it almost daily. I am no longer embarrassed by my chest and mid-section, and in fact I am now comfortable going out in form-fitting t-shirts and even muscle-type tank shirts. I am actually developing firm abdominal muscles, have practically lost the love handles entirely, and have more energy and self-confidence about my body than I ever did in the past (including when I was in my twenties). My chest looks terrific now. My partner is amazed that I am actually becoming a little vain about my firm torso and legs. I don't really understand WHAT exactly makes this system work so well, but I can say that the results are amazing!",1310083200,17,1596,4.564459930313589

I'm sure it'll be harder then. 2nd night: 15 minutes into the workout I was pouring sweat. Going straight through and having 3 pound weights instead of 1 lb soup cans makes a difference. Even after the first workout I saw definition in my triceps and glutes and after the 2nd time of doing this, even more definition.

I tried to do the P90X and honestly for me it was too hard/time consuming and I just started to give up on myself.  I borrowed this video from the library to try it out before spending money on a video I may not like.  Well this DVD is definitely worth buying especially for such a great price!  Some people think Jillian is bossy on TVs BL and maybe she is and has to be, but she is just right in this video.  I feel that I now have hope to stay healthy and get fit.

I don't feel like it's enough on it's own to get the most out of all the trouble zone targeting. I mean, if you're really trying to drop some pounds that is.
Its still a really great DVD and doesn't get boring at all. it takes about an hour to do, warm up, stretching and all. some of the same moves are done as the ones in 30 day shred, but you also get to learn some new ones. Worth the buy.",1308009600,,571,3.847457627118644
3710420,5,B001N2WISQ,"I'm overweight by about 50 pounds and had never done a workout video in my life before trying Jillian Michaels' 30-Day Shred (AWESOME).  When you live in Minnesota, the outdoor sports and exercise options you enjoyed year-round are availble only a few months a year, so I needed to try something to help me get in shape.  After trying the 30-Day Shred and loving it, I tried No More Trouble Zones and love it, too.  They are completely different, though.  30-Day Shred has more cardio, so I do that 4 days/week and do No More Trouble Zones 2 days/week.  I love that this workout DVD is broken up into short circuits so that you can choose to do all of them or only 1 or a few if, for example, you have young kids who will only give you 20 minutes to workout, if you're lucky.  Even on my first day, I felt incredibly challenged, strengthened, and excited.  I could literally feel strenghtening of every inch of the muscles on which I was focusing.  I ""burned"" for the next day, but it was actually motivating (and not painful, just sore).  I think Jillian is motivational and appreciate her talking you thorough the exercises, but you can always mute if if you just want to do the exercises.",1307836800,4,1191,4.451612903225806

After my first day I was so sore I could barely walk up the stairs in my house but I stuck with it and I'm so happy I did. After the first week I saw a difference in my arms and legs. After two weeks I saw a difference in my overall body. I like to do this video in the morning because I feel so motivated to eat healthy the rest of the day because I feel as though I don't want to undo all of the hard work I put in.
It's really difficult to do some of the work out moves which is why there are modified versions. When I first started out I was doing all of the modified versions. After a week I began to be able to do the normal movements and after three weeks I could do everything just the way Jillian does. It's just amazing.",1307404800,,864,3.859550561797753

I'd spent years doing cardio on treadmills, ellipticals and spin bikes, thinking workout DVDs couldn't possibly give me the cardio challenge that the gym did. I can't remember why, but last September, I purchased this DVD. I popped it in the DVD player, thinking I was in great shape and that this was going to be a breeze. What a humbling experience!! Although I finished the workout, I probably stood gasping through half of it. The lunges were impossible. I could barely walk for days after. That was about nine months ago, and I've since added about six more DVDs to my collection. I can't tell you how excited I am to have discovered a way to really push myself to a new level of fitness. I don't even see the point of keeping my gym membership. I can actually see my arms and abs toning up, and it just makes me want to keep going. Although I've added more Jillian workouts to my collection (along with a Bob), I just keep coming back to this one. While my technique and endurance has improved dramatically, I still can't do the whole thing perfectly. Also, as my technique improves, the workout actually becomes more difficult because I'm hitting the target muscles more precisely. I increased my weights, and it was almost like starting over again. This is just a great workout that keeps on challenging. It's not too long and not too short. It's very difficult but doable. I just love it.

I tried the Insanity program for a couple of weeks and found it way, way too intense for me - to the point of where I dreaded working out because it made me feel like I was going to throw up. I don't naturally love working out, so it can be a challenge to find something that is a good workout, but not so hard that I will give up. I feel this fits the bill perfectly. This program works out virtually every single muscle (my calves are the only ones that don't get sore), and has a good flow between upper and lower body, many times using both. It's also surprising how much the workout is a cardio workout. Even after the first circuit (shoulders), I was sweating and breathing heavily. I tried to do the workout with 5 pound weights, but soon determined that starting with 3 pounders is better given the amount of reps in a circuit. I also enjoy listening to Jillian. She is encouraging without being annoying, and takes a no-nonsense approach to fitness. Overall, I can't more highly recommend the program.

Don't get me wrong, they are all fabulous and I love them, I was just ready for a change. I decided I would go with No More Trouble Zones to get a more involved strength workout. I really had no idea what I was in for. This workout is TOUGH and will leave you feeling fatigued, yet exhilarated. I was sore for a full 5 days after doing this workout, and keep in mind I've been working out consistently for several months. This is quite a long workout, and lasts about an hour including warmup and cooldown. I really like how the circuits are designed and how when you feel like you can't go on any longer, Jillian changes up the move and gives your tired muscles a break - without letting you stop completely. Her use of active recovery is brilliant. Yes, the music kind of sucks, and yes, her assistants are too cheesy and don't look like they're working hard at all. Use your own music and ignore those girls in the back and you'll be set. I have already seen fantastic results and feel so much stronger. PLUS, if you have knee problems, THIS might be a good workout for you. Ripped in 30/30 Day Shred were both starting to wear on my knees a bit, and since I have given those a rest and switched to NMTZ, my knees feel great. For the past two weeks I have been alternating between NMTZ and Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, and I feel greater than ever. You can make them as short or as long as you want to, but I would urge you to push yourself and go as far as you can. Start with 1 circuit and work your way up if you need to.

she hits womens ""trouble zones"" which is normally butt, legs, arms, shoulders and abs...
the compound moves really get your heart pumping and burning fat!!
she does say that you can not spot train but build those muscles and blast the fat off the muscles..
i have done this workout 4 times this week and can ""feel"" a tighter core and see better shapely legs
i am used to lifting heavy weights but i can only manage 3#s for this workout...i tried 5#'s at first and could not do it..my husband walked in on me one day doing this workout and now he is scared to do it with me...i am determined to get him on it too
this workout is longer than ripped or shredded but the time sees to fly by...when you are almost ready to quit, jillian pushes you through with some motivation!!
makes me mad how much money i spent on personal trainers when i could have spent around $10 for this and do it in comfort of my own home..
this is by far the one dvd that you need if you are ready to tone up and have some shapely muscles and not arm flapping when you wave at some one..",1305936000,4,1248,4.161157024793388
3710434,5,B001N2WISQ,"There are already a lot of great reviews breaking down the exercises and such of this video, so I really just want to share my experience and how to get the most out of your Jillian Michaels workouts.
In my opinion, it is absolutely essential to do 30 day shred first before you start No More Trouble Zones. Doing 30 day shred will give you the core strength you need to get through this entire video, especially the planks and push ups.
If you are looking for a longer workout or are looking to burn more calories than 30 day shred alone provides, I worked my way up to doing 3 mile runs before doing the 30 day shred video, for about an hour total of exercise per day. I also recommend spending 2 weeks on level 1, 2 weeks on level 2, and 2 weeks on level 3. Yes this makes it more than a 30 day shred but by the end you will be really strong.
Now that I have done this (and have gone from being able to run 1 mile to being able to run 12), I am doing No More Trouble Zones five days a week. (I'm in my second week of doing this.) When I finish this workout, I am absolutely drenched in sweat.
Follow my advice and you will be shredded. Burning the fat takes time, so I still don't look ripped by any means but I've gone from a size 8 to a small 6 and I am stronger than ever. Also, if you want to prevent soreness, try drinking a small amount of protein powder before and a full scoop after your workout.
Good luck and stick with it! It's worth it!",1305676800,5,1451,3.9896907216494846
3710435,5,B001N2WISQ,I use the DVD multiple times a week and boy she still can kick my rear to Timbuktu and back. Love it. Best DVD out there for toning your body. Want to look lean and feel strong? Get this DVD ASAP!,1305504000,,196,3.8048780487804876
3710436,3,B001N2WISQ,"This is a decent video overall.  I can see how it would be difficult for a beginner or someone with a lot of weight to lose.  Most of the moves involve hand weights, but I think the weights could be omitted to make the exercises low impact.  She does suggest some modifications, however they are infrequent; I prefer to see modified versions of an entire workout when possible.  It makes a routine more accessible to more people, and offers those who find the moves too difficult something to work towards, instead of feeling incapable of completing the routine.  That said, Jillian keeps a good rhythm and the tape is not boring, although it is rather short and has less content than similar titles.

My favorite part is in the ""BONUS"" section where Jillian's first recommendation for overall good health was to buy an electric toothbrush, which I found rather odd.  She then gives some more random healthy lifestyle advice, then begins to extol the virtues of some Oral-B toothbrush and how she hasn't had any root canals since she started using it.  I don't know how she keeps a straight face.",1305504000,8,1096,4.701570680628272

3710438,5,B001N2WISQ,"I alternate days between this video and Jillian's other vid ""Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism"".  I think between this video with its strength-building exercises and the other video's cardio blast, you will definitely see a change in what your body (especially the abs!), mind, stamina, and strength.

I would say that while this video doesn't make you sweat as much as her others (like those that have more jump training involved, etc), this one will make you feel the burn.  The circuit training keeps you motivated and interested throughout the workout.  Jillian is really good at showing you how exercises can be modified as well - so if you are just starting out and struggling, she has certain ""cheats"" for you, or if you are have advanced and become a pro, she can make you suffer too.  ;)",1305072000,,791,4.744525547445256

I haven't seen as much in terms of results as compared to the Shred dvd's but it's still a great workout.,1305072000,,379,4.066666666666666

The reason I love it is because you get a full body work out in just 40 minutes. I must say, is not easy so, if you are just starting out take your time worry about the form and not the speed and do as much as you can.

The best part I saw was I had more defined arms and I felt I was getting my tummy fat down.  Now, having said that, this workout DVD will make you work hard, and honestly I had to stop a few times and catch my breath, but as Jillian says, ""I make big promises"" but you have to put the work in.

3710460,5,B001N2WISQ,"I rented this DVD from my local library before purchasing it.  I just finished it.  If you are an early beginner (like me) do not expect to finish it non-stop the whole way through on your first try.  I had to take a break during a few circuits - especially the ""surrenders,"" and I was too tired to do the last one.  At first this made me feel a little bit bad about myself (I have been doing Jari Love's workout without much trouble) but then I realized - that's what makes this a great workout!  The fact that I couldn't finish it the first time gives me motivation and determination to improve and do better the next time... or maybe within the next week... :)
I have decided to purchase this, and plan to alternate days between this 50 minutes video and my 30 minute Jari Love video.
I love that Jillian doesn't seem ""fake"" in her video (as some other fitness instructors do).  She has on normal clothes, the set is well lit without clutter, she has her hair in a pony tail, and isn't wearing gobs of makeup.
She also does great at explaining form and motivating you to keep moving through tough circuits.  And she doesn't lie about how many reps are left - I hate when the instructors in videos say you have 4 more, but then decide to have you do 8.
The ONLY complaint I have about this routine is all the mat work.  I know mat work is great, but I HATE it - it's really hard on my knees, hands, and wrists.  Perhaps it's just that I'm not strong enough yet to support myself properly.  Definitely be sure to have a thick enough mat for this video.",1300752000,,1553,4.216216216216216

3710466,5,B001N2WISQ,"I'm a fan of the Biggest Loser so I bought the cardio max dvd and wasn't that impressed.  I love Bob on the show but the workout was just too much jumping and not solely focused on weights.  So I decided to give Jillian a try.  I quickly realized that she was the trainer for me.  It's something about her that kept me focused and motivated through the entire workout.  She's not boring like some trainers.  This workout will kick your butt!

I consider myself on an intermediate level and I couldn't keep up with all the moves the way she was doing it.  I had to modify several of the moves to beginner level and put the weights down on some other ones.  I have bad knees from playing sports when I was younger.  So the reverse lunges were too much on my knees so I couldn't do those.  Oh and the surrender move!  It was just too much for me.  The key is to keep moving when you feel like you can't do the exercise she's doing.  But I'm not disappointed with not being able to do some moves because that gives me something to work towards.  Overall I highly recommend this DVD to everyone that needs to firm and tone those trouble zones.

I'm not overweight by any means but I have no muscle and I kept feeling like I was just all pudge. I've only lost 4 lbs so far (after a week and a half) but damn, it looks GOOD.

At first I didn't think I was going to get through it, but Jillian makes it go rather quickly, and I like the idea of the circuits. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I felt the cool down wasn't enough. My muscles needed to be stretched a lot more after the workout, so I just did it on my own, but I wish there was a little more stretching in it.

I have more energy and stamina than with any other workout. My abs look amazing too!
Also, after not running outside for a few months, I used this video only three days a week. When it started getting sunny again for me to run outdoors, I was able to run 5 miles without a problem.

I was able to get through the whole video using 3 pound weights, but it was almost too easy during some of the circuits. I already do strength training so it's probably because the weights I am using are too light, so I think if I switched to 5 lb weights for some of the sets it will be a lot more challenging for me. However, I really like how this video works out every muscle of your body, but I think for people who already workout, you will definitely need to use heavier weights to feel the burnnn. :)",1299801600,,655,4.165354330708661

If your a beginner I suggest started slow though so you can get use to it. when I started it I need to pound weights instead of 3 pound weights. Now I am doing the full dvd with 3lbs,6 times a week.

3710474,3,B001N2WISQ,"The workouts themselves are well described, easy to understand and not too complicated to do. Jillian is clear, motivating and brings personality. It is pleasant to watch, well produced, good background music, her 2 background people are good too. One of them does modifications so you can make the exercises easier if need be. All you need are light weights (Jillian uses 3lbs) and a mat if you would like. It doesn't require too much space (the apartment living room with the coffee table moved should be fine) but you will be moving forward and back as well as side to side. I can feel my muscles working during the exercise but I'm not sore the day after - which means it wasn't hard enough. To make it a tougher, I think I will use 3lbs like Jillian when doing more ""movement sets"" and move up to 4.5lbs when doing more ""static sets."" I'm also going to try doing an additional circuit. This is a GREAT workout but if you are looking for an advanced workout to kick your butt, this isn't it. I was already lifting weights when I started (so I already had muscle built) and I run 3 miles per week. I'm not in amazing shape but I was hoping this could take me to the next level.

1. I really like Jillian Michaels DVDs and 2. I am in good shape and work out 2 to 4 times a week and 3. I have a variety of workout DVDs and enjoy doing them as my primary means of exercise.

This video was a good challenge and I enjoyed it up until about 35-40 minutes into it. It was at this point that I got this overwhelming feeling of nausea and had to stop and lay on the floor until it passed. This happened every time I did this video and ONLY this video. I tried everything, drank lots of water and ate something before working out and trying to stay hydrated during but nothing helped. I did some research and found that with constant raising and lowering of your heart rate (as happens in this video) it can induce nausea and isn't good for you.

You can do the whole workout or select the circuits you want to do at the menu. You'll need some hand weights for this workout and a mat if you want. (You are down on your back for some of the ab circuits)",1298505600,,395,4.076923076923077
3710479,5,B001N2WISQ,"I LOVE THIS WORKOUT DVD!!! Jillian's form of tough love isn't for everyone and I don't like the way she talks down to ""her girls"" (if she didn't want girls better than her on her video, then she should have picked less capable women). But Jillian's coaching style aside - which actually works for me, the workout itself is KICK BUTT!!! I rotate through 6 different workout DVDs so that every day I'm doing something different (and thus stay motivated to keep at it).  This one is by far my favorite because despite the fact that this one utilizes hand weights, it's slightly less hard than her Burn Fat Boost Metabolism DVD, which is 100% cardio and wipes me out.  I started working out after a 3-year hiatus about 8 weeks ago, and last week was the first time I was able to complete this workout in its entirety.  It's AWESOME because it hits every body part, builds strength yet contains cardio, the rotating/circuit format keeps you moving (and entertained). I've noticed that if you really do focus on making that ""mind body connection"" she talks about, it helps improve the quality of the exercise AND makes the time go by faster. I've definitely lost weight and gained some lovely lean muscle since using this DVD, but I can't contribute that just to THIS particular DVD since I use 5 other ones for the same purpose. I just think this one is the best and enjoy it the most. I'll continue to use this DVD for the next 2-3 months until it's time to cycle new workout DVDs into my routine (anything to avoid the gym), but I'll look forward to the day when I can cycle it back in!",1298505600,,1583,4.451724137931034
3710480,5,B001N2WISQ,I love this workout.  It can be tough but that is what makes it great.  You certainly see results with this.  You use 3 lb weights with almost everything and that helps burn more calories.  I highly recommend this video.,1298505600,,220,4.425

For the past two weeks I haven't even been sore.  I saw this on comcast onDemand and after this work out I was exhausted at times I had to stop because it worked me so hard.  It is hard but not impossible, I would recommend using the three pound weights even if you can do 5 or 8 lbs you will be doing multiple reps so it will start hurting really bad.  And today I can feel the burn from the work out.  She does a job to motivate, show you where you're working out and reminds you why you're doing this.  I think the most important thing is her message at the end. Don't go and gain everything you just lost from this workout with your next meal, if you want results you have to also change how you eat.

This DVD is tough, I'm not going to lie. I did JM's 30 Day Shred, for the full 30 days then bought this DVD along with Banish Fat Boost Metabolism. I love this DVD. I use 3lb weights and have to really push my way through, but it's definitely worth the money. I use the DVD about 3 times a week and have noticed differences in my posture and even noticed how much easier it is to squat down and move around. I work at a daycare and it's much easier picking up and playing with my students.

I do, however, turn the DVD down and play my own music. It's much more motivating, as her music gets a little dull.",1298419200,3,705,4.0647482014388485

3710484,5,B001N2WISQ,"I used this DVD to get into shape a little over a year ago before a trip to Hawaii.  My goal was to finally feel comfortable wearing a bikini for the first time in my adult life (my standards for an acceptable bikini body are pretty high).  When I started I was at least 15 lbs over my ideal weight, and had lots of not cute loose fat.  After using this DVD combined with BFBM for ONLY 4 weeks, I saw a HUGE difference.  I went from flabby to toned and definitely met my goal of looking hot at the beach.  Like others have mentioned, I didn't lose a ton of weight, only maybe 8 lbs, but I gained so much muscle and lost fat that I looked like I had dropped the full 15 I originally thought I needed to get off.  I am now using these two DVDs again to help me get off the weight from my first baby, and boy are they coming through for me again. I'm still again at least 15 lbs above my ideal weight but I can shockingly get back into my size 8 skirts - some of which were a little too tight when I was a bit thinner before the baby.  These workouts simply have the power to suck in everything where it's supposed to be, and it's extremely motivating because even before you hit your goal weight your body looks and feels so much stronger and healthier.  In terms of diet, the first time I lost the weight with these a year and a half ago I just cut back on my food intake but nothing crazy.  I probably averaged about 1600 cals/day (5'6 1/2"" woman).  Now that I'm nursing I'm also just following a healthy diet (new Weight Watchers Points Plus - love it) but not cutting back too much, taking in an average of around 1800 cals/day.

Jillian's DVDs are definitely the key to helping to lose a few pesky pounds but more importantly her moves actually sculpt your body into amazing shape.  If you followed her diet plan as well you would see ridiculous results but her diets are pretty strict so I generally don't have the discipline for it.  Although I did do her one week diet in her book ""30 Day Shred"" before my wedding and lost about 7 lbs in 5 days (most was admittedly water weight but I was still the smallest I've ever been in my life!).  Jillian is my body guru.  Can't say enough good things about her workouts.  On days I don't have the time or energy for a 50 minute workout I either do a 30 Day Shred session or pop in ""Train for your body type"" from Women's Health and do that 22 minute cardio - check that one out too!",1297900800,18,2430,4.094936708860759
3710485,5,B001N2WISQ,"Jillian Michaels creates a challenging and effective workout. This workout is supposed to use light weights, so be prepared. She uses 3 lb dumbells, but it would still be challenging for a beginner with no weights. You could gradually work up through 1 lb, 2 lb, etc. The workout is so hard that I usually do 3/4 of it, then the next time do the last half of the video. But I can definitely see and feel results right away. It is intense, but I highly recommend you try it, even if you have to modify some of the exercises. I also have her ""Burn Fat, Boost Metabolism"" which I personally like better. I alternate between the two videos so I don't get bored and plan on getting more of her videos.",1297900800,,696,4.28030303030303
3710486,4,B001N2WISQ,"The photos on the product page showing ""kicks"" are not from this DVD.  There are no kicks, with the exception of the ""donkey kick"" on your hands and knees in the last circuit.  Overall it's a good workout and think it works best to go through the entire workout rather than pick and choose circuits.  Jillian makes a point to say it's designed to be a cardio workout so you are burning fat, not just doing strength training.  She also explains how to do the moves in an easier way and how to make it harder.  The recommendations on the DVD say to do it 5 days a week and while you will see results really quickly if you stick to it, I found it to be too repetitious and too long to do it every day.  I now alternate with her 30 min kettlebell workout (Shred it with weights), which also includes cardio.

I definitley recommend this DVD because I definitely feel the muscles worked in those annoying areas ( butt, belly, hips, inner thighs, back of the arms, etc.) and you get a good cardio workout right in your living room.  All you need is light hand weights - 3lb is what she uses because she uses it for the entire duration in various ways.",1297728000,2,1145,4.244239631336406

Then last year I found Jillian Michaels and her 30 Day Shred made all the difference in the world!  I can see muscles toning and shaping that I didn't even know I had!

Anyway, after using her ""30 Day Shred"" and ""Banish Fat Boost Metabolism"" DVDs for a few months I thought I'd add another JM DVD to my weekly rotation!  I picked up No More Trouble Zones and thought I was just going to die the first time I tried it! It was so challenging!  However, after sticking to it and completing the entire work out a few times, it quickly became one of my favorites!  If you need a boost to get to the next level of fitness, this is it!  Extremely challenging, but extremely worth it!  I started using Jillian's DVDs in early 2010 and since then I have lost 36 pounds and reshaped my body!  I'll be using No More Trouble Zones as often as possible to help me get the last 15 stubborn pounds off!  Thanks to Jillian and her DVDs I am in better shape at 30 than I ever was in college!

As I get older, I find it harder to keep my weight in check so getting my heart rate up is essential for my aging metabolism. I really really like this workout. Jillian has put together great sets and pushes you in a very nice way. The sets are composed of working multiple muscle groups and tiring them out. Just when I feel like I can't do any more she moves on to the next. The abdominal workout is hard for me and I still can't do all the reps but I feel really strong after having done this video every other day for 2 weeks. I started with 2 lb weights and am working up to 3 lb, alternating with some sets. As for the comments about her assistants, they are a little annoying but I try to stay focused on Jillian. As with all video tapes, listening to them repeatedly gets old fast...it's definitely not the same as going to a class...but I can no longer take morning classes due to a career and this is the best I have found so far.

My husband sometimes does the DVD with me (which I think is the best way of support) with heavier weights and he sweats harder than me and he says he feels like he's done a really good workout (and he's fit, as in passes his military fitness tests easy).

I like the fact that there is some cardio and some weights with this video -- more like a regular class that you would take at a gym. You can also use different size weights as you get more fit.

Jillian Michaels' circuit training is different. This workout video kicks my butt, is fun, and the moves are simple enough even for me, yet challenging enough to keep me interested. I do this video every time I have the chance. My only complaint is that, while the entire workout is supposed to be 40 minutes, it's actually about 55 minutes with warm up and cool down, and I don't always have that much time to devote to exercising (in which case, I do the 30 Day Shred, which is good, as well, but being only about 25 minutes, it isn't quite as much of a challenge).",1295740800,,953,4.420454545454546

I am sore but it is the good kind because I am working muscles that haven't been worked in a long time .

I like the circuit format because it allows me to get in a workout even if I am short on time. The circuits keep you moving and works multiples areas all at once. This video isn't difficult, isn't fancy -- it is something that I can easily stick to. I highly recommend this video.",1292630400,4,1065,4.1201923076923075
3710519,5,B001N2WISQ,"I tell you what, after 3 days in a row of this video, I'm seeing results! Didn't think it was possible to start seeing a difference so quick, but it's true. It's a hard work out that leaves you sore... but feeling so good after. And I am NOT a fan of sweating... thanks goodness this video delivers without excessive sweat! I'm looking forward to the next week of this video. Very pleased!",1291507200,,389,4.342465753424658
3710520,5,B001N2WISQ,"I am not going to sit here and pretend that I love and enjoy doing this workout.  There have even been times where I've looked at my cat while hanging out in plank position, arms shaking, abs and shoulders on fire, near tears, and told him ""Just tell me to quit and I will buddy.  I don't want to do this, it sucks!  You just say the word and I will quit right now!""  BTW, he never says to stop, so I don't.  Don't even get me started on the surrenders.  But what I do love and enjoy is the sense of accomplishment when I'm done and the results I see from it.

Make no mistake, this workout is no joke.  It is difficult and it is not over in 30 minutes.  There is only one level, it's put up or shut up.  There are modifications to help you along and by all means you must do it at your own pace and build into their speed and strength.  But it has really helped take my 30-40 minute weekday workouts to another level.  It's funny, I love this DVD when I'm not DOING this DVD, lol.

I really don't have any warm and fuzzy things to say about this one, like I do on the others, but if you want something that really takes your 30-day Shred work to another level and solidifies what you are working towards, then this is the one.

FYI, I do the following workouts each week:
 - Tuesday: Shred w/ Weights, fun and energizing way to start my week of working out off.
 - Wednesday: Yoga Meltdown: Good push and mood booster on hump day (2 more days until the weekend!)
 - Thursday: 30-Day Shred, level 2 or 3... now being replaced with the 6 Week Six-Pack: Let's pick up the pace and finish this week strong.
 - Saturday: No More Trouble Zones: Finishing off the week of strength training with the most difficult of the bunch.  It's a challenge, but one that I am up for and is necessary.
 - Sunday: Cycling outdoors

To each their own, but this is what works for me.  It is something I have stuck with and I really have seen some amazing results (the boyfriend is quite impressed and happy).  I have really become a Jillian devotee and I can't thank her enough for reaching something inside of me that no one else has touched before, because I am motivated more than ever.

Get them all and work hard.  You'll hit your slumps here and there and there are going to be days where you just really don't want to deal with her and her workouts (cursing at her helps), but man do you feel great when it's over.  She's the best and you will be very proud of yourself if you stick with it and don't phone it in.  Really push yourself each time you do the workouts, when you start to get good at it, up the weights, move faster.  Don't stagnate.  LOVE YA JILL!

It has a great combination of leg, arms and abs exercises that rotate so that you can continue working out even after one set of muscles is burned out. That said, the burn goes away and now I can complete the workout with 8 lb weights without problem. The 3 lb weights are much too light to see results quickly and are only for the truly beginner. The only drawback I see is that now that I have reached the next level of fitness, the leg workout is fairly easy. I can still get challenged in my arms by increasing the weights though.

3710531,5,B001N2WISQ,"I am a 43 yr old woman who went from couch potato to following a diet plan and walking about 3 months ago. While the diet plan helped start the weight loss, I felt like I wasn't losing weight fast enough. I was hesitant to try exercise DVDs, because the last time I worked out at home was way before DVDs were invented (ha!).  I picked up Jillian's ""30-Day Shred"" and loved it. Level 1 is perfect for beginners, especially at 20 minutes (I haven't even tried Level 2 & 3 yet). But I felt like I needed a full body workout and read rave reviews about this DVD, so I thought I'd try it. I'm glad I did!

Jillian does NOT disappoint! For a beginner, yes..it's tough and has been labeled as 'intermediate/advanced', but I love the challenge.  Within a matter of 2 weeks, I noticed my arms gaining substantial definition ('there's my bicep!'). The rest of my body has easily followed and I was shocked by the results. There isn't high aerobics or jumping all over the place. This DVD focuses on weights and toning the upper & lower body at one time with awesome abdominal work, which I absolutely love (I use 3 lb weights throughout). While many feel 40 minutes is too long .. well, when I'm done, I feel satisfied I've gotten a kick-booty full-body workout.

I find Jillian extremely easy to follow and she warns you before moving on to the next exercise. She pushes just enough to make you want to stop, then switches it up with something new. She also provides modifications, which you'll need as a beginner (along with frequent breaks to catch your breath!). I've been using this DVD about 3 times a week for 4 weeks now and I'm just now able to do the 'surrender' (which is NOT for bad knees like mine, but it rocks). Also, I work out on carpet without sneakers and that's another bonus for me.

A few negatives include some already mentioned in the reviews. Like I said, I have really bad knees and this DVD is probably not the best for me, but I still push myself through it with the many lunges & squats. Some find her voice and demeanor annoying. I don't find that at all. I'm venturing out soon to a kickboxing DVD (not Jillians), so we'll see how others compare to her.",1287619200,11,2175,4.373762376237623

3710537,5,B001N2WISQ,This workout is GREAT for all trouble areas..especially arms.  It's not a fun 50 minutes but it's worth it!,1285027200,,107,4.631578947368421
3710538,4,B001N2WISQ,"The first two DVDs that Jillian Michaels released - No More Trouble Zones and Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism - are meant to be companion pieces, although both generally aim to do the same thing: seriously shed some calories and build lean muscle through high-intensity circuit training. In NMTZ, the workout is about 50 minutes including a five minute warm-up and five minute cooldown. The 40-minute workout consists of seven circuits, each of which consists of five moves. You go through the five moves, and then repeat them, mostly to compensate for switching out arms and legs of certain moves. The circuits target the major trouble zones on your body - legs, arms, butt, hips, and abs - generally pairing two muscle groups into one circuit (ex: chest & abs, upper body & core, etc.). It's definitely a WORKOUT that will rock your body, and make it look rocking with repeated use, but it's also probably the toughest DVD Jillian Michaels has released.

The reason why I gave this DVD four stars isn't because of the workout itself (which is awesome), but in comparing it to the products Jillian released post-NMTZ, I feel like there is room for improvement. Namely, the fact you're paying for one giant workout that requires a pretty hefty time commitment makes it less valuable to me than her time-crunched 30 minute workouts that can be found on her other DVDs. In theory you can just do sections of NMTZ to customize the length and target areas, but it doesn't feel *right* to do so. The DVD definitely feels like it should be completed in one fell swoop, so I don't buy into the idea that it's actually *more* flexible than her other DVDs. I also don't think she shows enough variation for beginners and advanced versions of each move. This is problematic as I've had to adapt some moves when starting out with this DVD based on variations I know she or other trainers offer on other DVDs, and it also takes away from the ability to progress as you get stronger, other than increasing your weights (which may not be ideal as you may bulk up too much muscle).

That being said, Jillian Michaels' dvds are easily the best workouts I've done to date. NMTZ is definitely an investment when it comes to time and energy spent, but it will certainly provide results if you combine it with a healthy diet and practice it consistently. Admittedly I probably only do this DVD a couple of times a month when mixed in with all my other DVDs, because the sheer dread of doing pretty high-intensity moves for close to an hour makes me a little afraid to tackle this too often. It's good to have in your workout DVD library as a challenge though.",1284940800,2,2636,4.630341880341881
3710539,4,B001N2WISQ,"This is a great workout and doesn't require a lot of equipment. I agree with most of the other reviewers that this has some great workouts, and Jillian isn't annoying like some trainers.

In case this matters to you, here are a couple things that stood out to me:

poor resolution when viewed on a large TV - the picture gets grainy

hard on joints - some of the exercises are hard on the joints and are ""un-doable"" for those with injuries.  I have a shoulder injury so I can't do the side planks and a few other exercises.  The ""surrenders"" are hard on the knees, even with a pillow on the floor. It would be nice to be able to create your own workout and exclude the few exercises that hurt too much, but this DVD doesn't have that option.",1284768000,,741,4.226950354609929

3710546,5,B001N2WISQ,"Jillian Michaels is NO JOKE. I've been slowly (but steadily) losing weight since around last Christmas and only recently passed the 20-pound mark.  Up until now I've been doing it with prayer, diet, yoga, and long walks, but after returning recently from a trip to Chicago (and sampling Chi-town's famous deep-dish pizza!) I felt compelled to step up my game with some muscle work!!

This video DOES NOT disappoint! You will FEEL the results immediately and, as long as you stick with your fitness routine, you will SEE results within a couple weeks. The video works like a circuit training class; you use small hand weights (purchased separately, of course:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Valeo-Neoprene-Hand-Weight/dp/B002YC2W4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Valeo Neoprene Hand Weight</a>). Three to five-pound weights are reasonable to start with but she discourages going much higher than that because the name of the game for us ladies is ""long and lean"" rather than short and bulky!

There are about 7 circuits; each one is VERY challenging and is done TWICE. The video starts with a warm up, then you target each muscle group with a series of standing and floor circuits (upper body, core/abs, hammies and glutes, quads and inner thighs, etc.) until finally you end with stretches (breathing a sigh of relief that you SURVIVED!). The cover says that the workout is 40 minutes, but in actuality it's like an hour from start to finish.

Jillian has a great personality and motivates you throughout the workout to keep going. She also suggests modifications for those who need them. Her two assistants are in very good shape, enthusiastic, and give off absolutely NONE of that conceited bimbo-vibe you get with some other workout videos. You will definitely get your money's worth here...so purchase and enjoy!

P.S. I so appreciate her style and expertise that I'm also purchasing one of Jillian's newest workouts, Yoga Meltdown (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jillian-Michaels-Yoga-Meltdown/dp/B0031XYLWG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jillian Michaels: Yoga Meltdown</a>).

The video runs about 40-45 minutes if you do all of the circuits, so I usually split the DVD into 2 days since I don't have that kind of time to work out each day. Your muscles will be sore the next day, and you will definitely see results!  I try to pair this DVD with Jillian's ""Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism"" DVD for a 1-2 punch of cardio and weight training.  Each DVD is tough, and together, they combine for a great overall workout.  Prepare to work hard and sweat, but if you put in the work, you will be happy with the results!",1280793600,,1017,4.293193717277487

3710560,5,B001N2WISQ,"I love this workout. I've been doing it for a very long time (the better part of the last two years) and I am STILL challenged! Almost every move on this dvd is a combination move, working more than one body at a time which builds muscle, gives you a cardiovascular workout and burns a TON of calories. It has totally boosted my metabolism and keeps it boosted as long as I am doing it regularly. True, she does not keep her reps on each side even! As an aerobics instructor myself this has bothered me although I've NEVER noticed my legs looking uneven from a mere 3-4 rep difference between legs! This dvd helped me get in fab shape for my wedding last year and I even modified it this past year while pregnant. Now that I'm postpartum I am doing the full video again and feeling my abs coming back quickly because of all of the wonderful planks and core work which works the transverse abdominis muscle! Note to all women wanting to get back in shape postpartum: do not do too many crunches at first. Focus on strengthening your transverse abdominis first! (the 'girdle' muscle that holds everything in around your middle when it is strong and in shape!) Once it is tight again then start more heavily into your crunches to build that six pack. They won't help unless you strengthen the TA first! Enjoy your hard body!",1279843200,4,1321,4.462809917355372
3710561,5,B001N2WISQ,"Can I start with saying that I am a fourteen year old girl who's actually quite healthy. I'm a dancer, so my body has always been pretty under control until I stopped dancing this past fall. I didn't really need to lose weight, I just had lost most of the definition in my body, so I began searching for methods to gain back my muscle definition. Let me say, nothing I have tried is better than this. I bought it with my mom, and tried it the day I received it, and let me just assure you that you WILL feel the burn.

It's a workout where you know that the next morning you're going to be super duper sore, but you also know that you're body will eventually thank you for it. It recommends that you perform the workout five days a week. It has very athletic-aerobic incorporated moves that are not unfamiliar to a dancer. (Ballet requires similar moves on the abs circuits.) It's done in circuit style to allow you to burn calories in exercises you normally would not be able to burn a sufficient amount of calories with. I do suggest this workout for people who AREN'T beginners, mainly because it's pretty hard-core. However, she does give you suggestions on what to do should you be a beginner.

Jillian Michaels has a drill-sergeant mentality that some might find unnerving, but it did keep me motivated! If it's your first time working out, do not be ashamed if you cannot complete the circuits or if you have to take a break. I did. You get the same results, if not more, because you are building yourself up. There is room to grow in this exercise program which is ideal! Anyway, I totally love it! I already am starting to gain parts of my old physique back, which I LOVE! <3",1279756800,3,1684,4.376996805111821
3710562,4,B001N2WISQ,"I had previously been using Jillian's ""30 Day Shred"" DVD and wanted to change my routine.  A friend told me about ""No More Trouble Zones"" and I decided to give it a try.  NMTZ is definitely harder than 30 Day Shred!  I like the variety of moves and that this workout calls for more repetitions with lighter weights.  It's also nice that you can choose to play the entire workout or select different segments from the menu.  Each segment is about 5-7 minutes long and focuses on certain areas such as abs/chest or core.  The biggest drawback for me is that I've been using this DVD 2-3 times a week for about a month, and I haven't seen a noticeable difference in my ""trouble zones"".  I am already in pretty good shape - I also run 3-4 times a week and am careful about what I eat - but I was hoping this workout would help me firm up a little bit more.  I am going to keep at it, though!  I would also caution that if you prefer a lower-impact, sweat-free workout, this DVD is not for you.

I don't have time during the week to do all 7 circuits, so I pick three (always doing the triceps circuit) and do those.  And I certainly feel it the next day.

3710570,5,B001N2WISQ,"I first bought Jillians 30 day shred. I felt like I was going to die on the first workout. I got through it and moved on to the Banish Fat and Boost Metabolism and almost died, but I got through it. Now I can get through it with ease (I just don't feel like I am going to die now). I had been using this workout for about 2 weeks, and my muscles began to memorize the video. So I knew I needed to throw something else into the mix. I of course went to Jillian's videos. I ended up getting no more trouble zones. Here is what I like about the two videos:

No More Trouble Zones

- Less Cardio
- More Toning
- Utilizes hand weights

Banish Fat and Boost Metabolism

- Intense Cardio
- Some toning
- No hand weights

These are very contrasting videos in very good ways. My new routine is alternating between the two everyday.
Monday- No more trouble zones
Tuesday- Banish Fat Boost Metabolism
Wednesday- No more trouble zone.... etc

So these two videos provide an excellent variety of cardio and toning. It also prevents my muscles from memorizing the routine. I also plan to throw in the 30 day shred every once in a while, and I plan on purchasing the yoga meltdown and throwing that in as well. It also depends on how intense the yoga meltdown is. If it isn't intense enough, which I doubt being that it is a Jillian Michaels video, I may just use it as a supplement.

Overall I highly recommend all the Jillian videos Ive used.

P.S. I have a bikini body now! I feel good in a bathing suit. No optical illusions with the cover up anymore! (Ladies, you know what Im talking about)",1278115200,,1581,4.246666666666667
3710571,5,B001N2WISQ,"I review video games for a living. It's a great gig that lets me work from home, but I tell you this so you understand that I am essentially on my butt for massive chunks of time, and it doesn't lead to a girlish figure. Combine that with an aversion to the extreme hot and humid outdoor weather here in Florida, and you have a recipe for flab. As a young woman, twenty-five years old and six feet tall, I should be in my prime. Instead, I am decidedly... not. I'm not obese, but I'm nowhere near the amazon figure someone of my age and height should/could have.

I was only vaguely aware of Jillian Michaels as ""that bossy chick on that show"". I'd never watched the Biggest Loser before, but I'd heard so many things about how harsh she supposedly was I already had an opinion of her. Recently they started airing Biggest Loser reruns in the morning while I have my coffee, and I was actually surprised at how much I liked Jillian; she's intense, sure, but she definitely seems to know what she's talking about and care about the results people get. Finally I decided to pick up No More Trouble Zones from Netflix, and holy cow, am I glad I ever did. After just a week, I decided I HAD to have my own copy, and picked it up from Amazon with 30 Day Shred and Boost Metabolism.

This DVD, along with 30 Day Shred and Boost Metabolism, is hard. But after every workout I feel AMAZING. Yes, I'm exhausted, sweaty, and my muscles are aching and trembling, but I feel energized and sharper mentally. I exercise five days a week, alternating workout videos, and take the weekends ""off"", during which I find I now have more energy to do everything from working in the garden to running around theme parks. I'm actually sleeping better too.

I'm not saying this DVD is going to change your life, because obviously no one thing works for everyone, but for me, this is apparently what I was looking for. It's intense, it's high energy, and it's incredibly motivating. I don't find I have to force myself to work out each day; I actually enjoy it, even if I do want to collapse when it's over.

In one year I lost sixty pounds on my own doing basic ""dieting"" (IE, eating healthier), but I felt I had stalled out. This DVD series has given me the boost I need, and I highly recommend anyone who feels stuck in their weight loss at the very least check it out.

NOTE: Don't be foolish; if you're severely out of shape or have preexisting medical conditions (or back injuries!) you probably shouldn't do everything in these videos as vigorously as Jillian and her tribe of ridiculously in-shape women do. Jillian frequently points out that ""we start where we start"", and there's no shame in having to modify an exercise so you can do it. If you are using these DVDs and the exercises are PAINFUL (and I mean they hurt while you do them, rather than just typical muscle fatigue), then STOP. You are doing them wrong, and you are going to hurt yourself. The DVD cannot read your mind and tell you what you should not be doing; you have to take responsibility for your own wellbeing. Just take things slow, watch the circuit a few times if you have to so you learn, and you'll be kicking butt eventually. After all, anything worth doing is worth doing right. Right?",1277424000,60,3248,4.424749163879599
3710572,5,B001N2WISQ,"I'm a huge fan of Jillian's, and after trying some of her on-demand workouts, I purchased this DVD along with the 30 day Shred, as well as Banish Fat. Comcast on-demand has a quick version of No More Trouble Zones, about 25 minutes long. The DVD, however, is about an hour long. It is an intense workout that focuses on strength training. There are 7 circuits, each emphasizing different muscle groups. For example, on the 2nd circuit, she works your chest and abs. There is a five minute warm-up, and a five minute cool down. All you need for the exercise is a pair of 3 pound hand weights. Some people use different weights, smaller or larger, but 3 is a good number. It's also what they use on the DVD.

This first time I did the DVD of No More Trouble Zones, I honestly thought I would have to return it... I consider myself intermediate when it comes to fitness, and I barely got through it the first time. But the more I did it, the better I got, and now I actually enjoy it! This took my fitness to the next level. I've done countless workouts, and this is not only my favorite workout by Jillian, but this is definitely my favorite workout DVD of all time. I'm noticing HUGE improvements in my strength and muscle tone. People are actually asking me what sort of workout I've been doing!

I workout five days a week, and I use No More Trouble Zones 3 days a week, on non-consecutive days. On the remaining days I do cardio and yoga. This DVD is tough, but it pays off. Be patient, don't give up...you'll see changes only after a few times of doing this DVD. Best workout ever!",1277078400,9,1584,4.32996632996633
3710573,5,B001N2WISQ,"Like many people, I was first introduced to the Jillian Michaels DVD's with 30 Day Shred.  I really enjoyed the Shred.  As I worked through the levels, I noticed a big change in my endurance and muscle tone, even though at that point I was already a regular exerciser.  30 Day Shred is half the length of No More Trouble Zones (and its cardio sister Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism).  Once I got to the point where I was looking for something a bit longer, I ordered NMTZ and BFBM.  No More Trouble Zones is definitely my favorite of the three.  It's a whole body, muscle-building workout, and you rarely put your weights down.  I vary my weights throughout - 3 to 8 pounds depending on the move.  (She recommends light weights, because there are so many repetitions.)  Each section focuses on one body part (i.e. the biceps, triceps, abs, etc.), while often utilizing the legs as well in the form of lunges and squats for a higher calorie burn.  (My triceps were so fatigued after NMTZ that the next day on a run, even my water bottle felt heavy!)  I love that Jillian hits every muscle group, even some that I might miss on my own weightlifting days.

For the past seven years I have tried different types of exercise including spinning,hot yoga,running,crossfit,and even hiring personal trainers. The previous types of exercise worked well for me, but they came at a high cost. This dvd is not only affordable, but if you have the determination to actually push yourself and get into better shape-this will help you see results and fast!

After completing this workout along with my usual cardio workout of the day, my arms were shaking. Then when I woke up the next day, my butt,abs,and thighs were screaming with a good kind of pain! Her ab workouts in this circuit training are amazing and she uses other exercises that target the inner thigh(which if you are a woman you know how annoying this trouble zone is to target). I found myself breaking a really good sweat about ten minutes into the dvd, and by the end I was completely exhausted.

I recommend this dvd to anyone who is on a tight budget and can't afford to join a gym or hire a personal trainer. I think trainers are amazing, but there are times when you just can't afford it. You have to listen to Jillian and follow through with this workout and you really will see results! My only advice would be that if you are already at an intermediate to an advanced level of fitness you probably want to use weights that are at least 5 lbs. They use 3lbs. and I'm not sure if it's enough for someone who is already pretty fit. I'm a small-boned female and 5 lbs. was just the right amount. In a few weeks I will probably increase the weights I am using to 6lbs.",1275782400,8,1625,4.431438127090301
3710581,5,B001N2WISQ,"Of all the workout videos I have amassed over the years, this is without a doubt the best.  It is tough for the beginner yet it challenges the seasoned athlete.  I have been working out probably ever since I was born, and I can tell you that this workout never really gets easier.  It remains a challenge and I am usually always a bit sore the next day which is a good thing!  I run, I bike, and I swim and I am in excellent physical shape yet doing this workout kicks my butt every time.  That's why I always sigh a little before I pop it in -- b/c I know that it's so tough!  I own the other two Jillian Michael's workouts as well and they are also equally as challenging as this one -- they never get any easier to do -- the workouts are tough each time.  Another important aspect of these workouts is that I have never been injured doing one and that is a very strong testament to what a great trainer Jillian is.  Believe me, I have done some pretty awful videos with so-called top trainers and got some bad injuries -- you don't want to go there.  Trust Jillian; she knows her stuff and she is very motivating.  She makes you want to do your best.  When you are trying to get through a tough workout to get in better shape or to lose a few pounds or whatever your goals are, you need a good coach who encourages and pushes you to do more.  I would also strongly suggest buying any of her fitness/diet books -- I have the Master Your Metabolism book and it is wonderful.  The 2 week healthy eating plan is extremely effective (it's really hard to do though but it works!) at burning off the calories and getting your body toned.  Quite simply put, Jillian rocks and these videos and her books will get you in the best shape of your life -- no joke.",1275523200,4,1753,4.14792899408284

Well once I popped in Jillian's DVD I ALMOST DIED, and that was just the warm up (so ok...I'm very much out of shape). The workout targets multiple body parts with one exercise, so you get the most for a limited amount of time. She works in circuits, repeating the same set of moves twice and she goes from working arms and legs to arms and abs, etc. It's a great total body workout and it's really, REALLY hard. I can't get past half of the DVD and sometimes I have to skip doing a second set of the move because I'm about to DIE. Seriously. No lie. I'm working up to it though, and even though I've only done it a few times I already feel a big difference in my legs and even in my abs (which are the hardest part for me to tone). I'll tell you one thing, you'll feel this right after you're done, and then, you'll feel it 6x more the day after, and the day after that, and the day after that one... Yup. Great stuff. I recommend, if you're like me and you've been fooled into thinking you're not in that bad of a shape, you'll want to do other workouts as well if it's too hard, just so you can build up maybe.

3 years ago I had a little boy.  I used to be in shape and loved working out. Now I dread it. I am over weight by 60 lbs. There is nothing harder than motivating yourself to exercise when you are out of shape. So, I needed a little help. I turned to Jillian. You may be thinking that I am one of her die-hard fans, watch every season of Biggest Loser, but I'm not. I simply said to myself that if I want to keep up with my child I need to lose weight. So I bought Jiilian's ""No More Trouble Zones"" DVD.

This is my first day trying it out. I completed 20 minutes and my muscles are so out of shape I had to stop prior to getting through to the end. Yes, it is a kick you in the butt kind of DVD. Since I have a background in exercise training, I thought I would get a lot further. Man, I am really out of shape.

This DVD works every muscle in your legs, abs, glutes, and arms. 5 minute circuits to work different muscles and it rotates. Once you think that you are done, there is more. She was informative, direct (which I like), and tried to keep you motivated. Since it is my first day I can't comment on the section that is only music. I can say that if you are flying through this DVD (40 minute workout) you are in good shape or you aren't doing the moves to their full potential or just doing the moves plain wrong.

The only set back from an instructor point of view, she doesn't tell or show you how to modify if you aren't exactly in shape or up to snuff with muscle tone. There were a few moves that I needed to modify so I wouldn't hurt myself.
Otherwise, great video to get anyone in shape.",1274745600,2,1660,3.9879518072289155

3710587,5,B001N2WISQ,I have never watched Biggest Loser or even knew much about Jillian Michaels. I just searched for the best workout DVD and this was on top and now I know why! This works every single problem area and works them hard! It does everything it promises. It's motivating and I lost 2 lbs in the first week! This is great to me because they say the last 10 lbs are the hardest to lose and that's what I'm trying to lose. I recommend this to all considering it! Great buy!,1274486400,,463,4.155555555555556

I also feel stronger and I've noticed that my body is changing, I'm definitely happy with this product and I don't need a gym membership or a personal trainer when I have this one at home!",1274400000,,519,3.9523809523809526

Last year I decided it was time to lost the extra pounds that didn't come off after my 4th pregnancy, so after browsing amazon for some ideas I stumbled upon Jillian's 30 Day Shred and No More Trouble Zones. These videos work. If you are using proper form, working out 5-6 days week, and not overindulging on carbs/dessert you WILL see results. Here are my stats:

April 2009: 124 pounds, 5 feet 4 inches tall,  size 6

Workout/diet regimen: started with 30 Day Shred, moved on to No More Trouble Zones (since it had the longer ab workouts I wanted) for about 1 month almost daily. No diet, just cut back on snacks/dessert.

May 2009: 111 pounds, size 0 or 2 - total weight loss 13 pounds, about 10% of my body weight.

Well that's it. 1 day after the workout my ass was hearting like hell. At the time I didn't really realized it. I like how she involves in 1 exercise all the muscle groups, thus not wasting time. I can just recommend to all who is doing mostly cardio but bodywork too. All of her dvd's are very challenging.

To me this is the best. Maybe I'm just getting used to it but to me she toned down the ""tough girl"" attitude a bit here and she looks so much more toned that you can't help but be inspired. You know it will work because she sticks to tried-and-true exercises but it is not boring because she adds little variations and keeps things going at a pace that's just right for me (I would rate myself as an intermediate to advanced exerciser). Also, compared to 30-day shred, this is pure weights.  Although I know the benefits of interval training, sometimes when I'm doing weights, I like to focus on form and execution without pausing to do cardio in between. In this one, you work up a sweat but without the jumping jacks etc. in between, so that's another advantage. I tend to like DVDs that use the music to spur you on, and this is not one of them. When I first got this DVD I quibbled that she did not really stay on beat but after a few times you really just get so into the workout that you don't think about the music one way or the other - Highly recommended!",1273968000,,1225,4.168776371308017
3710593,5,B001N2WISQ,"This chic is great! I have never seen the show that made her famous, but I use this video (and the 30-day-shred) because her workouts are direct and to the point and leave me sore the next day. I am not the most co-ordinated exerciser, so I really like that there are no girly dance like moves here. The cardio moves are basic but intense and the strength training exercises are explained in detail. I have had to work my way up to some of them, but that work keeps me coming back.  The 30 day Shred offers a greater cardio workout, but it is must shorter and once I worked my way up I was left wanting more. This one is offering more, but it is a slower pace. Sometimes it seems like the intensity of this routine peaks too soon with less heart rate increasing exercises in the later circuits, but I still feel invigorated when I am done.

Blast Fat is terrific for cardio, but I found myself adding weights to the program.  No More Trouble Zones is very focused on hard-to-get-firm areas as well as major muscle groups.  It works the abs more than I would like (abs aren't my trouble zone), but I plan to tailor it more to my needs as I get comfortable with the moves.  At first I was concerned it wasn't aerobic enough, but the constant motion keeps my heart rate up.  I alternate NMTZ with BFBM for my regular workouts and use 30DS if I am short on time.  My only complaint with NMTZ is that many of the moves are pretty hard on the knees.  I have to do the lunging moves very carefully (without bringing the knee over the foot)or my knees start to ache.

I really like both.  This one does incorporate pretty much all the shred moves but then adds on, and there is not as much cardio.  I can't do all the exercises right now at the best form, but I'm working towards it.  I used to be a relatively in shape person and then stopped working out about 6mos ago so now I'm starting all over.  I'm finding I'm doing a lot of the same things that used to take me over an hour on my own in under 50minutes with this video-- that's the great part!  She really keeps you moving.  And, I like her no-nonsense approach with just the right amount of talk.  If I keep doing this and try watching my weight, I'll be in great shape before bathing suit season-- and I'm starting late!

You do not know pain and suffering before you have been through one of her routines.  How the other two gals behind her can keep their plastic smiles on their faces is beyond me.  These work outs are weight based and they BURN unlike anything.  You will be shaking by the time you get through it.  And you WILL get results.  This is about challenging yourself and moving in ways you never thought possible.  The Surrender and the lunges with lateral shoulder raises are brutal, but you will see results almost immediately.  Perhaps the best of the routines are the ones at the end, the old school mat work.

It's no walk in the park because I am always soaked from head to toe in sweat even after having done this workout for about three months.

Great part about this video is that you could choose the circuits you would like to do that day. You can do the whole DVD which is 50min, or you can do however many circuits you want, or any specific circuit that TARGETS what you want.

I generally dislike strength-training and would rather run or get on the elliptical for 45-60 mins 4-5x/week -- but that was in the past, before I realized I needed to start strength-training.  I started off with Jackie Warner two summers ago, which got me motivated into incorporating circuit-training into my workouts, but I found myself not committing more than a few months at a time before taking a break and having to start it up all over again (a pain). Then I got the No More Trouble Zones DVD, and my interest hasn't waned since.  I still get pooped out during the workouts of this DVD (2x/week), and there are parts I cannot stand doing but I'll do it because I have to (the triceps/butt segment -- the Surrenders-circuit kicks!).  I love Jillian Michael's style, and her body (and that of the casts') is inspiration! I won't repeat the breakdown of this DVD, as it's been done throughout the reviews.  I've noticed I'm stronger and more toned, which not only keeps me working out to this DVD, I bought Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, and I recently bought her newest Power-Yoga DVD.  I've been doing No More Trouble Zones since Dec 2009; I'm a runner and my legs tone the fastest -- the rest of my body is slow-burning so I need to invest time circuit/strength-training before I see significant results.  Jillian Michaels is motivating and makes me want to persevere -- it helps that I saw her in action on the Biggest Loser.  My arms are beginning to show definition, but the most stubborn part of my body -- my abs -- is taking FOREVER! I probably need to make some dietary changes if I want accelerated tummy-toning. I have an intermediate-level of fitness, and I find her workouts challenging; I thought 40 mins was not enough, but even after 15-20 mins I'm already looking forward to it being over. It's worth mentioning that I recently bought 30-day shred to use with the Tracy Anderson MAT DVD (TA's MAT is toning, and is supposed to be done with some form of cardio -- probably her dance workout, but who's got 2 hours?

I got this workout based on the reviews, and I have not been disappointed.  This workout is tough and it hurts!  Jillian's ""surrender"" move makes me want to give up, and her ab work is killer.  I also like the length of this workout and really feel like I did something when it is done.

I did this work out once and almost did not make it all the way through.
Yet, the point is not to give up beacuse it hurts, so a sip of water and there I kept on going.
I did finish and it felt great. Good feeling of accomplishment.  I loved it.
It motivates me to work out for longer than 10 minutes, which is my limit when I do it myself. I get bored.
I could not go back to this DVD for 5 days after first work out.  I was in pain all over.  But I like such pain, it meant to me all was working as planned.  I cannot imagine a work out after which you are not sore all over.
Today, I am back to it and intend to build up to be able to do it once a day.  That will put me back in shape.
I did not work out for 4 years.  For some people in my situation to start with this video may be too much, but I am OK with it as I like to push myself.  I am mentally capable if not physically.
I highly recommend this work out to anyone who is serious about getting in shape.  It is true, no pain, no gain.

3710615,5,B001N2WISQ,"The first Jillian Michaels workout I did was her 30 Day Shred. I liked it so much, I went on to purchase  ""Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism"" as well as this DVD.  I love all three DVDs and rotate between them each day.

This is a sculpting workout as opposed to a straight cardio workout, like in Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism or the cardio circuits in 30 Day Shred.  But, I wear a heart rate monitor, and I find I burn just as many calories doing this workout even though there is no cardio involved.  That means I'm getting a GREAT workout.

What I LOVE about this DVD:  it is a whole body sculpting DVD.  You're working legs and arms simultaneously (similar to 30 Day Shred, in fact, a few of the moves are the same or similar), and there are two great ab circuits.  The plank moves are killer.  But when I'm done, I feel I've worked every muscle in my body.  I also like that the time spent doing each exercise is shorter because you do each exercise twice, so I find I can get through them more easily without wanting to stop. For example, in 30 Day Shred I will start to lose my steam and motivation because I'll feel like we've been doing squats or lunges FOREVER, and Jillian will say, ""halfway there, don't quit on me now!"" and I'm like, aaagh how many are left?! But with this DVD, because the circuits are set up differently, you'll do a set of four to five exercises twice. So, you'll do each exercise for a little bit of time, twice instead of doing a whole bunch at once. Make sense? This helps me psychologically because just when I'm starting to lose my steam on a certain move, Jillian switches to another move.

I also like the menu option of picking one circuit.  Sometimes I'll want to jog, and come in and do the ab circuit.  Or the triceps circuit, etc.  It's a great supplemental tool if someone doesn't want to do the entire workout, or if they want to focus on cardio and just do a little bit of sculpting.

Jillian is very motivational, she's a great instructor, and shows you how to do the exercises properly.  I feel confident in my form when doing each exercise (some exercise videos go too fast and I'm not sure I've got the proper form down and worry about injury).  I highly recommend this DVD.",1268611200,26,2221,4.323671497584541
3710616,4,B001N2WISQ,"If you've done the 30 day shred, you'll recognize some of the moves in this DVD, though not so many that it makes this DVD not worth buying.  As with her other videos, I could see this being tough on someone with bad knees.  I have bad wrists, and there's a lot of stuff in this video that requires you to be in plank pose--she doesn't really give a useful modification, but I found I was able to modify those moves myself to make them doable.

This is basically a longer version of the strength and ab portions of the 30 day shred.  That being said, this workout is still a good way to get your heart pumping.  If you're like me and the cardio circuits are your least favorite part of the 30 day shred, this is a great option.  I still feel like I got a good cardio workout after doing this DVD, and it has the added bonus of targeting even more areas with strength training.  You will definitely feel the burn the next day, though I wasn't as sore as I was after the first time I did the 30 day shred.  I recommend adding some additional stretching on your own both before and after the video, that seems to help a lot with the next day soreness--with this DVD especially, the stretching in the warm up and cool down doesn't really target all the muscles that the DVD works.  This is a great addition to my workout DVD collection--as much as I love to hate Jillian Michaels, her DVDs are some of the most effective I've tried.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking for a good, interesting workout that is effective and not too time-consuming (the workout runs about 40 minutes).",1268611200,20,1595,4.286666666666667

I consider myself to be in pretty decent shape and I had to take a break about 25 minutes in because my muscles started shaking.  So don't feel bad if if takes you a few times of doing the video to make it all the way through.  She combines legs and arms a lot which really elevates the heart rate so you get some cardio effect from the workout as well.  I especially love how she devotes time to the inner and outer thighs since those are definitely my trouble zones.  I plan on combining this workout with her ""Burn fat, boost metabolism"" DVD so I can be ripped for the summer.  Also, it seems like Jillian knows when i'm about to give up during the workout and she does a good job of motivating me and reminding me while I'm doing this.  My only thing about the DVD is the backup girls.  I did the 30 day shred and I loved the personality that those girls showed and the fact that they were sweating and struggling right along with me.  The girls on this DVD just smile and don't really seem to struggle which is fine I guess, I'm just used to the other ones.

It's very long and hard, but it really works muscles you never knew you had, and I've noticed a difference.

I will keep this and use it along with the 30 day shred DVD that I purchased as well.,1267660800,,344,3.9285714285714284
3710623,5,B001N2WISQ,"I love this workout.  I like that she stays with basic, but effective, exercises.  I do have a bad knee, so I modify parts of this. Jillian has once again made an excellent video.",1267574400,,179,4.235294117647059
3710624,5,B001N2WISQ,"If you want to sculpt any flab in your body, this is the dvd to get.

I've bought Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred and Banish Fat and Boost Metabolism along with No More Trouble Zones. This is the most difficult exercise DVD (if you do the complete workout). I was aching for two days. She works on the arms, the abs, the glutes, and thighs- targeting all the trouble zones at my first attempt - day one.

This workout is not very easy. If you are not use to difficult workouts, I would begin with the 30 Day Shred to build up endurance and strength for the more challening No More Trouble Zones.

 It says to do the workout five days a week to get the maximum results. I'm planning to do this.

3710625,5,B001N2WISQ,"I am no stranger to working out, I run 25 miles a week. I have done P90X twice. I haven't done any weights in probably 5 months, focusing more on running. Decided I needed ""a little cross training"" to even things out. Holy Cow! I finished it fine and it was challenging and liked it, but today I can hardly walk! My running legs are not used to 5000 squats. I wanted to cry every time I had to go to the bathroom today because that meant sitting down and getting back up! OW! I know this will be great in another week or two. GREAT and efficient workout, every move is compound and it is fast moving. Get it....better than Jari love for sure and shorter but somehow harder.",1267401600,10,673,4.184615384615385
3710626,4,B001N2WISQ,"This review is for people that have the 30 Day Shred and considering whether or not to add this to their workout: YES!!! I bought 30 Day Shred back in October and got through Level 1, 2, and 3 within 2 weeks (I am 30 and have been actively working out the last 10 years but in no means would call myself completely fit or an athlete, just normal and healthy). The 30 Day Shred still kicked my ass and helped me tone up in ways that the gym has never toned me up before. The best part of 30 Day Shred was that it was 20 minutes, and I would alternate Levels 1, 2, and 3 every day for variety. However, after 3 months of working out to 30 Day Shred, I've gotten super bored of it and need a change. I borrowed my friend's No More Trouble Zones and hyped up to work out again! Some of the moves in this DVD are similar to 30 Day Shred, but I would say about 25-35% of it, depending if you modify some moves. This workout is also much longer (45 min. or so) but the time flew by because each circuit was about 5 min. and I looked forward to trying new moves. Also, some things that I found difficult in this DVD, I just reverted to the easier/beginner positions I learned from the 30 Day Shred. So for those people that are more beginners to Jillian Michaels, I recommend you get the 30 Day Shred first so you can learn the beginner/modified moves and make adjustments as necessary as you progress. For me, it's not about losing weight but getting toned and I definitely have more definition in my arms, abs, and legs. My friend's have complimented me as well and being on the shorter side, I've NEVER been complimented on having toned legs before so I am quite happy. :) I have not mastered any of JM's workouts, but I do get bored of the same routine. I'm glad to add this to the mix in addition to 30 Day Shred and I'll prob get the other ones too! AND I just saw that you can buy the combo set on Amazon!! Definitely go for that one!!! No more gym membership! All you need are 3 and 5 lbs weights!! Also, I never watch the Biggest Loser and I find JM extremely likeable as a trainer. I didn't rate this 5 stars since some moves are similar to 30 Day Shred, and I also think 30 Day Shred in general is better (I feel like I sweat more in 20 min in 30 Day Shred than I do in this one).",1267315200,49,2283,4.030837004405286
3710627,4,B001N2WISQ,"Jillian does not mess around. This workout hurts, but its the kind of pain where you know its paying off. I wouldn't recommend this if you have knee problems, there are several sets of squats and lunges. You can pick which body parts you want to work on or do the whole disc. Great workout, I plan on getting more by Jillian.",1267142400,,325,4.258064516129032
3710628,5,B001N2WISQ,"Just to give a prerequisite to my review, I am in my mid-20's and in pretty good shape. I am a half-marathon runner, yogi, cyclist gal and this DVD REALLY challenged me! It's perfect! All of the dumbell workouts I like to do on my own a few times a week are included in this DVD, only their more creatively combined to really target ""trouble zones"", add supersets, and get the heart pumping. I had to take 3 breaks while doing this last night because my quads felt like they were going to burst!

This DVD is 7 circuits, 6 minutes each, with a 5 minute warm-up, and 5 minute cool-down. I would recommend adding extra warm-up and stretching time at the end, 5 minutes just isn't enough, especially for the cool-down. Stretching will really help to reduce injury risk, and holding each stretch for at least 30 seconds will give you the best results for that (as they say in yoga, you need to give your muscles time to let go). Also, I would recommend having multiple dumbell weights laid out during this DVD. The first time through I used the same weights, and I was not able to work some areas as hard as I wanted/needed to. We all have stronger and weaker points, learn what yours are and add in that extra poundage to get amazing results!

The ""trouble zones"" targeted are BUTT (mine is so dang sore today!), obliques, abs (upper and lower), upper and lower back, quads, triceps, biceps, and hamstrings (although hamstrings aren't targeted as much as the quads). The circuits are all classic moves, however, she combines arms and legs in almost all of the sets, which is fabulous, it's like buy one get one free! There are a LOT of squats, lunges, and ab workouts on this DVD so mentally prep yourself for that!

Highly recommended, this DVD will be added to my ""regulars"" list of workout DVD's during the week!",1267142400,3,1812,4.501519756838905

3710632,5,B001N2WISQ,"Just as stated in the title, the workouts do hit the trouble zones and you will definitely feel the burn. Jillian is great about challenging you mentally and physically. I have had this DVD for a few weeks and I can already see changes in my body. (I use the DVD 2-3 times per week.) When I first performed the workout, I wasn't sure if I could last all the way through. But now that I have done it a few times, it's not AS difficult.

3710633,5,B001N2WISQ,"I have to say I am incredibly impressed with this dvd. I've been using the FIRM dvds for years and have always been pleased with them. But I'd heard so many good things about this dvd I had to try it! After the first time using ""No More Trouble Zones"" I felt incredible. This is one of the only workout dvds that really attacked my triceps and abs effectively! I hadn't felt a burn like that in my arms since a personal training session I had a couple years ago, so I have to say that one of the video's strongest aspects is its ab and arm workouts.

The circuit training is really effective in keeping your heart rate up and your attention span focused. Jillian isn't one of those annoying over preppy trainers, and even pokes fun at herself from time to time, kind of bringing herself down from the perfect fitness pedestal that some trainers seem to be on. She gives great words of encouragement without over doing it and I really appreciate her taking the time to go over proper form which is something the Firm doesn't always do.

The only downside of this video for me, was that I felt it didn't work my legs enough. The lunges and squats weren't too challenging when you compare it to the FIRM's relentless lunge/squat barrage. However, the mat work for legs was really effective.

On the whole this is an amazing addition to anyone's workout DVD collection, and I know I will personally be adding it to my weekly rotation since it really is a killer workout!

3710634,4,B001N2WISQ,"I knew that this DVD would be a real ""killer workout"" after watching Jillian on the Biggest Loser. I needed a drill sargeant, and believe me when I say that she is a one. What I don't like about most other exercise videos is the music and a perky gal with a high pitched / shrill voice. I don't like rock & roll, and I don't want to listen to it when I work out. I prefer the music to be in the background, soft and generic, so that I don't tire of it. This one has a snare drum beat instead of a tune, which is fine. I don't belong to a gym, since I like to work out at 8:30 PM, after my my work day is over. I have a home business. I have a treadmill at home, although there are two in the gym in my community. Look in your local newspaper; people are selling them all the time for not much money when they move. I have accumulated a small selection of hand weights over the years, that I can adjust and add weight to as needed. That way they don't take up much space. I bought a portable fold-up foam floor mat that I purchased at a local sporting goods store for about $20, which is really all that I need to have a home gym. The reason I'm telling you this is that (a) I'm a stress coach; (b) with this small amount of equipment, and with not much of an investment, I've managed to work out steadily and regularly, keeping my chronic back and knee problems and pain from reoccurring. It's been almost two years now that I've been pain free. For those exercises on this DVD that require squats and deep knee bends, I improvise (do less), I don't do them or do I something else.

3710636,5,B001N2WISQ,I just bought this DVD and really like it.  Jillian explains every move thoroughly.  There is enough time in between circuits to set up for the next exercise. She has a very extensive warm up and a cool down stretch.  Works out every muscle group.  There were 2 or 3 moves I could not do yet but plan to work up to them! I highly recommend this workout.,1266796800,,353,4.147058823529412
3710637,5,B001N2WISQ,"I agree with the other positive reviews.  This is my favorite workout.  It works my whole body, just to the point of muscle fatigue.  The moves are unique, but really effective.  It's a long workout with a quick motivating pace.  I like Jillian's attitude; no nonsense, but still motivational.  I also really like how she will tell you ""your triceps should be BURNING right now"" so I know that I'm doing the exercise correctly and that even Jillian and her ""ladies"" are feeling it too.

Jillian pushes you, doesn't give you a lot of time to rest, and mixes it up so you don't get bored.

My cable company recently took the workout down from the On Demand channel, and I came here right away to order it for myself.

I am in much better shape than I was before I started working out with Jillian.  This video, in particular, will righteously kick your butt and leave you feeling like you've really accomplished something.  I dare ANYBODY to do the circuit that includes Surrender, and not feel proud of themselves afterward.  It is the single most difficult exercise I've ever done, and my knees aren't getting any younger so I do it with a pillow on the floor to cushion them.

So Monday is Trouble Zones. Wednesday is Shred. Friday is Trouble Zones etc. On my off days I do Chi Qong to stretch and relax. I've lost 60 pounds in 7 months and am in the best shape of my life.

3710651,5,B001N2WISQ,"Phew! This workout is just what I needed. After 3 years of dragging myself to the gym sporadically, I decided to start working out at home instead. I picked up this DVD after reading online reviews and WOW! I'm feeling good! I have been working out more consistently than ever, and I'm definitely seeing results. Jillian incorporates ""old-school"" mat work (stuff I remember seeing my mom doing at Gloria Stevens in the 70s) and weights into a dynamic routine that will have you pouring sweat and cursing (always a good sign).

I appreciate a good challenge (see my review of ""10 Minute Solution: Fat Blasting Dance Mix"") and this workout is perfect for that. After having this DVD for a couple of months, there are still things I have to really push myself to do, such as the plank exercises, and every time I put the DVD on I say ""I'm going to do this even better today than I did the last time"".

I love Jillian, she is good at explaining form and she's a great motivator. However, one caution is that she doesn't seem to count reps. It doesn't bother me, but you may find that annoying if you like to stick to an exact count. And if you are the type who needs to rest a bit between circuits, be advised that this workout is basically nonstop and not for the faint of heart. The goal is to burn as many calories as possible, so once you get on the Jillian train the next stop is not for about 40 minutes. That is one of the many reasons I like this workout--I know that it is effective and I'm burning calories and fat.

Using both workout videos and allowing myself only 1200 calories a day, I lost 10 pounds in 30 days.  I feel great!  I finally see some ab muscles!  Trust me, they look prettier than muffin tops.  I know a lot more people have lost more weight using her workouts, but 10 pounds is good enough for me.  I am 5 feet tall, was 117 pounds.  Now at 107 lbs, I feel good about myself.  She really, really knows how to push without making you feel bad about yourself.  I also started using a heart rate monitor during the workouts to track how much calories I burn.  This workout does not have a lot of cardio in it, and I find that I burn more calories using the 30-day shred and her Cardiomax video.

3710662,5,B001N2WISQ,"If you are looking for a challenging workout that will make efficient use of your time, look no further.

I was first introduced to Jillian's workouts when I used her 30 day shred DVD  before my wedding. I loved the efficiency of getting a great workout in a fairly consolidated amount of time. It consistently became the first and only DVD that I reached for on the shelf among a sea of my other at home DVD's because I was seeing great results without spending more than 30 minutes a day at it. After the wedding I took a few months off, and once I got back into a more regular workout, I was looking for some added variety to my 2-3 favorites. I purchased NO MORE TROUBLE ZONES, but was slightly skeptical due to the length of the video. In all actuality, it is 55 min from start to finish. This is not terrible, but it is about 25 min longer than I normally commit to for a daily workout. For me the length of the 30 day shred circuits was ideal.

After completing the video end to end a few times, I was thrilled with the new exercises that she introduced. I figured there would be a lot of overlap from 30 day shred, but I was wrong! There are many new moves to keep things interesting. However, I found I was not opting to do it as often as I should due to the length, an hour always gives me the excuse that I don't have the time. I changed things up and starting alternating the circuits a few days a week. By doing that, I have found the perfect balance of difficulty and length. I start with the warm up (5 min), then do circuits 1-4 (~25 min), then do the cool down (~5 min). The next day I do the warm up, circuits 4-7 and the cool down. Circuit 4 happens to be my favorite so repeating it is no problem. So, in all, I have found the ~30 min workout I was looking for, plus the variety of not doing the same thing day after day, and lots of new great moves.

Thank you Jillian, I LOVE your workouts!",1264291200,8,1912,4.0906666666666665

The variety is great and there are only a few moves that I thought were a bit too easy - but overall this is a great investment for the price of $8.99. The only thing I would prefer is that Jillian would give better instruction before starting the moves, at the beginning of starting this DVD I had to watch them before joining in because I didn't know what the move was.

I have her 30 Day Shred and the Boost Your Metabolism Cardio and this is a nice way to change things up depending on what I feel like doing.",1264204800,,679,3.920289855072464

It came in the mail on Tuesday so i decided to give it a go (starting with 2kg Weights)--> It was a hard workout! and i exercise 4-5 times a week.

It is now Thursday (2 days later) and I am still sore from it! (my legs and butt have never been so sore) So i know it works!!

I would recomend for beginners to do this dvd the first time without hand weights. Your legs and butt will still get a great workout.

-This workout makes you sweat. Start out with light weights 3 lbs is enough to be a challenge. I did this with 5 pound weights because that's all I had i couldn't make it past 20 minutes I was dying.

I ordered her 30 day shred video over a year ago and enjoyed that, but unfortunatly didn't stick with it. I decided to order the trouble zone video when i saw it to give it a try. I LOVED it! I have been doing this video 3-4 times per week in the mornings and not bored with it at all. I can can definitly see results and it continues to challenge me.

3710670,5,B001N2WISQ,"I have been doing this work out on Demand and I have to say, it will kick your butt! I really considered myself ""in shape"" from how often I work out on the elliptical or treadmill, but this involves weights and strength training and definitely put me in my place! I was pretty sore after the first and second day but I encourage you to push through it! By day 3 you'll be able to walk again ;) ha ha!

One thing I would like to add is that I have seen posts about how difficult this can be. Yes. It is. But don't give up! Go at your own pace...take your time and just keep moving if you can't keep up with the reps until the next set or exercise. I admit, I couldn't keep up the first couple of times and I have NO upper body strength at whatsoever, so anything involving planks or push ups was a joke for me! After about a weeks worth of using this routine, I find that I am keeping up with no problem (although you still feel it and you will sweat!) and I am actually getting my butt up for those side planks and push ups! It's such a great feeling to see the progress, not only on your physical body, but your strength!

Today I am on day 11 of using this video daily and eating healthy and controlled portions....I have lost 3 lbs in one week (I will weigh myself again Sunday to find out how I did during week two!) I also have a handful of girlfriends who have started as well and are having pretty similar results! Get it, stick with it, and Good Luck!",1263427200,2,1459,4.044982698961937

Jillian is tough, but encouraging, and has lots of good ideas for abs, thighs, buns, arms, and back that I will continue to use at the gym as well as in my home. For $10, this dvd is a great deal.

It's almost an hour long with the warm up and cool down. It's broken down into multiple circuits that target different areas. It's fast pace, and it totally kept my attention. (My biggest issue is getting bored very quickly).

I was sweating tremendously and I could feel the burn ALL OVER. The pace incorporates cardio and the weights obviously provide resistance. If you want it to be more challenging, you just use heavier hand weights.

Wonderful DVD. I look forward to other DVDs that Jillian has to offer!",1262995200,,529,4.728260869565218

The first time, I was incredibly sore, but the 2nd time i had way more stamina than i realized. Great for beginners. She doesn't push you to do the advanced moves, and I like that the dvd lets you choose what circuit moves you want to do without having to watch it all over again--but i do anyways. After the first time, you will definitely feel the results. The key is to really push yourself. Don't cheat yourself by giving up halfway through or not taking the reps completely through. It's also great to alternate between my days at the gym & is getting me addicted to fitness.",1262908800,,695,4.312977099236641

3710675,5,B001N2WISQ,"This was my first DVD with Jillian Michaels.  I bought it because I was getting tired of not being challenged enough by the other workouts that I own (about 20). Boy I was surprised by the intensity of this DVD!  Throughout the workout, I had to stop the DVD after EVERY set of repetitions, though I have NEVER done that with any of my other workouts. I went through two bottles of .5L of water during an hour of this workout. This was a tough workout for a person considering herself quite fit!!  Some of the sets were quite hard to go through without stopping to catch a breath.  At the beginning, I started with 5lb dumbbells(the only ones I owned and used with my other DVDs); however, I could not go far with them in Jillian's workout and I ended up purchasing 3lb bells (as Jillian actually advises in this workout).  Even with 3lb bells, I felt very challenged and had to cheat on some of the workouts to go through the entire DVD.  I highly recommend this workout; however, I believe it is more suitable for an intermediate/advanced exerciser.",1262908800,,1051,4.476439790575916

Even if you don't have time to commit to the whole 40 min routine you can just do 1 or 2 circuits and still get a sweat session in. I love the circuit set-up and the non-stop twisting/turning/lifting/lunging keeps the heart rate up = calories burned! I've done the whole workout multiple times and I'm still seeing results. I used to workout 5 or 6 days a week with my guy friend and got in pretty decent shape, doing a different body area each day and was ALWAYS sore after those sessions. Now that we live in separate cities, this dvd is definitely an adequate replacement workout. This was definitely worth spending the 10 bucks...

I've always had flappy wings for triceps, but not anymore! This DVD has some really great sets, targeting all the trouble zones like the underarms... are really works them to build lean muscle in that area. It's longer than the 30 Day Shred... about 50 mins but with a little less cardio so you can get through the workout pretty well.

If she could stop talking long enough to count her reps and give a little intro on what's going to happen next this would really improve this DVD.  The point is to get a good work out but if you can't stand listening to her yabber on and on over the truly, truly awful ""music"" the DVD will stay out of your player.  I have to work out to this on mute it's so annoying.  Still--the workout is great although some moves are pretty hard on your back.",1262649600,,692,4.609756097560975

And very little time in between all her moves so it actually doing a difference in your body.

If you're looking for a good strength & toning workout that will still get your heartbeat up and make you sweat, look no further than ""No More Trouble Zones"". It's a great dvd to use in conjunction with Jillian's ""Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism"" workout as both have a similar structure: seven circuits of moves you repeat, plus an adequate warm-up and cool-down. In this program you will work your arms, shoulders, back, abs, buns and legs through weight training, crunches, mat-work and other compound movements.

It's definitely a challenging workout, even for someone in reasonably good shape. When you first start out with it, you may find some moves too difficult to do for the full alloted time, or without modification. But don't lose heart: with dedication and time, you will find your stamina and strength increase dramatically - I know I did! The variety of exercises here also keeps it from getting boring and repetitive after repeat viewings.

I like to do this workout at least once a week, while doing other more cardio/aerobic routines on other days and also some pilates for a rounded, varied exercise program. It's worth the pain because you will see and feel results from it.",1262563200,,1241,4.904761904761905

Both of these workouts show that you don't need a gym membership or even home workout equipment to get in shape. So - no excuses, people!

This is a workout that intermediates and advanced exercisers can do and still feel challenged.  The workout runs a little over 50 minutes.  The workout is broken into circuits that work large muscle groups in with small muscle groups to boost the fat burning.  There are a lot of squats mixed in with upper body work.  Each circuit targets a certain muscle group.  If you focus on the moves, you can get pretty toned.  The ab work on this is better than most total body videos and really does target all of the abs and core muscles.
This video is one that has remained in pretty constant use.  After this video, the sweat is pouring off my face and my body feels wrung out.  This video really hits all muscle groups.",1261699200,,868,4.506410256410256

I think her exercises are intense and will produce results, but many of them are very difficult and hard on the back.  I've been working out moderately for many years and can't do some of the moves they do in this video. Once in a while she will give a modification for an exercise, but usually over halfway through the set.  She also doesn't consistently offer alternatives for the moves she does.

I also think it's VERY boring.

I've definitely been sore after doing the workout, which is a plus.  However, I find the workout SO BORING!  Jillian doesn't have a whole lot of personality and can seem really arrogant at times.  I guess that's what she is known for and what makes her so popular, but none the less...I just don't care for her.
I think some better music would really make a big difference as well.

I guess this workout will definitely produce results if you stick with it, it's just not very exciting and it's so difficult for me to find the motivation to actually turn it on.  To each his/her own, I guess.",1260316800,30,1152,4.36150234741784

Such as a move called the ""surrender"" in this one  --I enjoy the fact that with each new Jillian's DVD -- I learn a new exercise I have never seen before.

Second day was much much better. I am on the 6th workout with interval training in between and I am not losing weight yet gaining muscle. Eat healthy, watch carb loads, and your body will definitely change with this high aerobic workout.

3710700,4,B001N2WISQ,"I am an intermediate level excerciser and workout atleast 4-5 times a week for atleast one hour either in the Gymn or follow Cathe Fredrich series on Fit Tv. I wanted more variety to my work outs and judging by the reviews Jillian's DVDs seemed like the perfect addition. She definitely doesn't dissapoint. Today is my third consequetive day of using her DVD.

Her workouts are simple but tough to follow. I ended up sweating like crazy in the very first two circuits, which is quite rare for me even when running at 6mph on the treadmill. She kept all the major muscle groups in constant tension in the super sets, resulting in excellent use of time. This DVD is very good for those who don't want to use a lot equipment and are short on time. The only equipment you need is a pair of light hand weights.

I gave it a 4 star rating because I'm used to working out for atleast one full hour, and  felt this DVD could have included a couple of extra optional circuits for those wanting to continue. Unlike some of the other advanced DVDs which let you blend and mix circuits to fit your schedule, this only had one basic workout to choose from or choose individual 6-minute circuit segments.

Neverthless, a great value for money. I don't really think its possible to lose 5 lbs/week as the back of the DVD cover claims.. as per my experience with 1000- 1500 calories diet per day and at this level/duration of exercise, I can burn upto 400 calories ONLY. I'm considering repeating the workout twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening to take advantage of the raised heartrate and elevated metabolism throughout the day to maximize fat burn.

On the whole, I like the DVD a lot. But still went back each time for another 40 min session of my other favourite trainer.",1258416000,,1781,4.467692307692308

As I have done it more I have grown to like it.  It is not the most challenging workout I have, but there are definitely times during when I am feeling the pain!  Jillian is very positive and encouraging throughout.  I would recommend this to anyone.",1258070400,,543,4.104761904761904

I only choose specific circuits to do, one morning abs and core, next morning arms and legs, etc.  There's no way I could do the entire DVD in one sitting.  It would be nice if you could customize a specific workout at the beginning rather than having to go back to the menu after each circuit and pick the next one you'd like to do (The Biggest Loser Weight Loss Yoga has this customization feature and it's great).  But she does make you sweat and you definitely feel it after your done so I can't complain.  She can be annoying at times (she rambles on and comes across as a little insincere) but you can elect to mute her instruction and just have the music if you like.  While not a great workout DVD it is pretty good.",1256601600,3,750,4.20979020979021
3710706,5,B001N2WISQ,"After trying weight machines, yoga, pilates, Denise Austin, ""Crunch"" workout videos to tone my abs and lower body without the results I wanted, I tried No More Trouble Zones, and was amazed at how fast and effective it was in just 2 weeks.
However, the routine is *challenging*! Despite being a jogger, and naturally muscular, I felt like an out of shape couch potato the first few times of NMTZ. At first, it's hard!
Pros:
NMTZ offers modifications for some of the more difficult moves (without the brutal criticism we sometimes see on The Biggest Loser. :)
The approach to toning abs is thorough! ALL of the abdominals get trained. Your core WILL get strong.
Light (3 lb) weights are used in high repetition for toned arms, not hulk arms.
There is minimal impact, no jumping around or difficult footwork to make you feel ridiculous. :) Just a simple 5 minute warm up in the beginning.
Sets alternate muscle groups so just when you think your legs or butt can't take any more, she moves on to a circuit of arms, or vice versa. Just enough rest to make it manageable, yet challenging enough to produce results.

Cons:
One of the girls doing the moves behind her has horrible form in several instances, but that certainly doesn't hinder one from getting an excellent workout, so I'm still giving it 5 stars.

Tips: Watch the video before doing the exercises. You move rather quickly from set to set (a good thing to keep your heart rate up) but that doesn't leave a great deal of time for instruction. I watched it once before actually doing it, and that was sufficient, as the moves are fairly simple.",1256601600,8,1601,4.614035087719298

Although I did see improvement with both of these regimens (especially in my core), I was not satisfied with the workout I was getting on my arms or butt.  These areas were still kinda ""soft"".  I don't need to lose any weight, I just need to firm up.  So....I decided to purchase Jillian Michaels' No More Trouble Zones, seeing as it absolutely works your butt and arms...not to mention everything else!  I was blown away by this workout.  Not only was I trembly and shaking by circuit 2, but I could just feel myself getting a substantial workout in areas that had never been worked before.  The circuits are comprehensive and work every part of your body.  The workout is tough, but you will be able to get through it even if you're a beginner - just modify the positions and/or pause the DVD from time to time to catch your breath.  I have only done the workout twice so far and I already feel stronger.  Like many other reviewers, I consider myself to be in pretty good shape, and I'm slender, and I still was dying at parts in the workout.  Jillian is amazing!!!!  She is real, and she wants you to succeed.  My goal is to do this workout 3 days a week in combination with a couple days of yoga or cardio.  I am quite certain that in 6 weeks I will see a major difference.  Hands down, go buy this...you will not be disappointed!!!!",1256256000,4,1498,4.416058394160584

The exercises are mostly different from the Shred so you won't get bored and it has a little bit of a lower key feel to it. I thought maybe I wouldn't feel much soreness as I am in better shape because of ""Shredding"" all summer but that wasn't true!

I loved every minute of this intense workout and was beyond sore the next day, which doesn't happen very often. As someone who typically works out 6 days a week running, lifting weights and cycling, I consider myself to be in good shape. This workout really worked me though, which was refreshing. I just recently finished my second round of P90X (also a great, intense workout) and was looking for something to mix up my workouts. No More Trouble Zones fit the bill perfectly. I actually purchased all 3 of Jillian Michaels' DVDS (NMTZ, 30 day shred and Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism) and haven't found one I don't like yet!

Jillian is a great trainer, but I was disappointed in the lack of cues. If you are familiar with a lot of the terminology and moves, it isn't that much of a problem, but the first time through is more of a learning experience. The workout is very quick paced with few breaks and you really feel like you're using time wisely. I love that Jillian combines moves to work several body parts at once, which is probably why I'm so sore today! I was also surprised that using just two 3 lb. hand weights could be so very effective. I began the workout with 5 lb. weights and quickly realized they were too heavy. Jillian even mentions that because you are doing so many reps, it's not necessary to have heavy weights. Boy was she right!

I love that Jillian has created some innovative moves by combining moves I've seen/done before by incorporating weights and successfully mixing things up.

Overall, I would highly recommend this workout to someone who is looking to tone muscle and get into peak overall shape. Beginners can easily transition into this program by modifying the moves, which is shown in the DVD. I would say this is for someone who is already in fairly good shape.",1252368000,,1876,4.528023598820059

I switch and do my own workout and do this twice per week so I can't say if the results are related to this or not.  She works the abs and thighs and arms and keeps it moving which is nice.

The workout is broken up into 7 segments and goes very quickly.  All you need are light dumbells and a mat.  I was so surprised at the results that 3-5 pound dumbells produced.  I had always been a person who thought that lifting the heaviest weight possible, would produce the best results.  Not so.  My arms, stomach and legs have never been as defined (in a feminine way) after doing this workout consistently.

3710745,5,B001N2WISQ,"I'm 41, 140 and on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being in Olympic condition and 1 being a couch potatoe) I consider myself at 4 and would be happy to be a 7 or 8- due to health issues I have only been working out intermittantly. I have worked out with the old (Susan Harris era) firm tapes for years and finally wanted new moves and shorter workouts with all the effectiveness of the old firm. I did my homework and decided to give Jillians 3 dvds a try. In this case, DO believe the hype LOL! I have been doing this workout for only a week and a half and it truly lives up to the firm and I am seeing great results in my tone as well as weight loss. The biggest difference btwn the workouts is although I sweat with the Firm, with NMTZ, I POUR. I've never had to stop because I cant see with the sweat running into my eyes. NMTZ does what the firm does in less time and with more cardio I feel. I am a believer in weights (firm influence) and skeptical that I would feel the burn with only 3 pds- I ended up going back down to 2 pds! However, I do feel that eventually, if I become advanced, I would love to be able to do 5lbs hand weights and 1 or 2 lb ankle weights- if you are advanced, it's a good workout, just increase the weights & add ankle weights. Of her 3 dvds, this one is easiest on the knees, not that much jumping- although the surrenders (OMG- you are in the army now baby!) I have to be careful to land as softly as possble on my knees. And if you have to go to your knees in plank pose (I do) there is knee pressure. Even so, this one is less of a killer for the kneess; BFBM and 30shred jumping is almost in every move seems like- I do this one to give my knees a rest. Someone mentioned that all the moves are not even, if you are not advanced- don't worry about it- seriously- I secretly pray she IS missing a move a two to give my sweaty butt a rest! I love Jillian's style, down to earth (to each his own, but it's my pet peeve to do workouts where I feel like I'm being instructed by Barbie & friends!), humourous, excellent cueing and seems to know when I'm flagging and gives that extra push right when I need it. I still have my VCR just for my beloved Firm but they will have to now make some room on my shelf for Jillian's workouts- they are a keeper for life.",1250294400,25,2283,3.9330453563714904
3710746,5,B001N2WISQ,"I purchased this DVD along with the 30 day Shred and Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism. I must say that I was blown away with the intensity of the workout. Jullian's advice and encouragement throughout was also very helpful.

I am a mom of a 5 month old and had a c-section. Also, I had stayed away from exercises (other than a little walking) ever since I became pregnant. Hence, I was apprehensive about doing this. The first day I did this workout, I was so tired that I almost wanted to puke. However, at the same time, I immensely enjoyed the workouts. All the exercises are to the point and you can feel your muscles getting toned. I have been alternating between the three DVDs for around a month now.  It is already showing results.

To put things in perspective, even before I started the DVDs, I was back to my pre-pregnancy weight. Though I have a tendency to put on weight really quick and lose it really slow, through proper and balanced diet, I have managed to be on the slim side. So, my problem was not of excess weight but having the fat in the wrong places. My problem areas were my tummy, which with the pregnancy had gotten flabby and kind of loose; and my butt which was again not toned. With the exercises, I have started getting into shape. My pregnancy belly has completely disappeared and my tummy muscles and butt have gotten toned. In fact, I AM IN BETTER SHAPE THAN I WAS PRE-PREGNANCY.

I strongly urge ppl out there to do yourself the biggest favor you ever can and buy this DVD (along with the other 2 DVDs that I have mentioned above; Besides it just cost me around $30, which is less than one meal for 2 and this is the best investment that I have ever ever made). Keep in mind that this DVD works not just for women but also men. The days I exercise as per the DVD, I can actually feel happier and more in peace and far more energetic, than if I dont.

As I mentioned earlier, I have a 5 month old and I am a working mom. So, that is enough to occupy me the entire day and tire me out so that I am ever so ready to sleep around 9-9.30 pm) Just so that I can exercise, I get up at around 4 am (as that is the only time I get to exercise in one stretch without having to stop to attend to my child). This is how much I love this DVD and would not want to miss it.

Try it and you won't regret it ever.

Best of luck",1250208000,61,2342,4.100436681222708
3710747,5,B001N2WISQ,"I purchased this DVD with some hesitation because I already owned the 30 day shred (I really like that DVD); so when I read another reviewer's remarks on how this video is very similar to it, I almost did not make the purchase.  There are some things that are similar, but in reality it is fairly different.  It is longer to work out to, but it went fairly quickly.  Summarizing the DVD for you- it has a lot more ab workouts (if this is a problem spot for you), and leg work outs.",1250121600,6,481,4.150537634408602
3710748,5,B001N2WISQ,"I will keep this short, but suffice to say this is possibly the best workout DVD I have ever owned. It kicks butt and delivers real results in a very short time. As with any workout, you have to focus and apply yourself, but I have done it 3-5 times a week for the past three weeks and have seen amazing results already. In my past I have worked as a personal trainer in a gym and am a certified yoga instructor and I will tell you this is a killer workout. It will help improve your performance in general and other areas of your active life if you already are athletically inclined. Jillian very no nonsense and there is no silly music or annoying aerobic routines. Men will find her tough training satisfying, too. I recommend it highly to anyone looking to kick their workout to the next level or to tone up key areas fast! I have already purchased additional copies of this DVD for my friends.

3710750,4,B001N2WISQ,"This dvd is really great for people who want to tone up. Unlike the 30 day shred, NMTZ have substantially lesser cardio (just a little bit in the warm up section), which is what I really like about this dvd. The dvd is broken down into sections and u can choose which muscle groups you want to work on. What I like is that she mentions that you cannot spot reduce, but can work on every muscle to shape up. You can also play the entire set which is 40 minutes long. This is meant for intermediate to advanced exercisers. [...]I really liked it.",1249689600,5,544,4.240384615384615

3710752,4,B001N2WISQ,"Jillian is a great teacher and though her routines are easy to follow, she makes it very challenging.  It doesn't take long to feel the burn. You will need weights and good athletic shoes.  But as a whole, I think this is for advanced exercisers (no matter how many times Jillian says ""if you are a beginner... only go this far..""(not the exact quote).  I am advanced, but was so out of breath after doing this the first time.  It is a great 40 - 45 mins workout composed of 7 6-min. killer circuits. My body showed improvement after just a week (5 days)+ a healthy diet. But if you are a beginner & really want this, be realistic at first & pace yourself.  Push yourself but it is not necessary to do the entire workout - at first - to get results. Do enough to challenge you then start adding more. Just make sure you warm up & cool down. I recommend room temperature water or energy drink nearby for very quick, short sips (you get a few 5 second breaks).  This proves you don't need long workouts to get results.  It is a user friendly, but intense, results oriented workout.  Jillian's no softie, she is the tough loving girlfriend.",1249603200,9,1137,4.355450236966824

I will tell you, ONE hour after I did the work out I could feel (good) pain all through my body letting me know that this workout did work. I loved the feeling of being sore because no other workout left me feeling like I used all my muscles. The only bad part is the DVD is so long, but its worth it! I plan on trying a couple more of Jillian Michaels DVDs just to switch things up a bit. I encourage you to Try It.",1249603200,,521,3.8333333333333335

I am so sore today from doing the video & granted I had to pause it 3 or 4 times to catch my breath but her circuit workouts really help the time go by MUCH faster and it's like she knows that right before you're about to give up it's time to stop!

I was so tired but felt bad that I ate 2 tacos earier so I  decided to do the whole workout since it was only 40minutes.... let me start off by saying im a big fan of jillian micheals... like I said i was tired/sleepy but went ahead and did the whole  workout anyway. It was a really good workout, I stop a couple of times to drink water, during the workout I felt like I had to vomate I guess this is a good thing, I was sweating but not as much as I do when I did the biggest loser cardio dvd... all doe I really love and perfer cardio, this was also pretty good but I wouldn't rate  it a # 5, I also ordered 30day shred which I know would probably be way better then NO MORE TROUBLE ZONES... Because I love cardio.... im not in perfect weight but im working harder everyday to get back to my regular size. The key is EAT HEALTHY SMALL PORTONS AND WORK OUT AT LEAST 4 TIMES A WEEK. If you have access to a gym get on the treadmill for at least 10 minutes, run for 1min, walk for 1min... keep going for a total of 10mins that way your burning fat and not to much musle, lift weights. And best of all abs and spinining classes... who ever is reading this be advised I was 190 Two weeks ago and today I weight 182 just by doing this simple workout @ the gym plus my biggest loser dvd... GOOD LUCK
Lastly what trip me out about this dvd, at the end jillian  is talking about brushing your teeth with oral b... PLEASE TELL MW WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH NO MORE TROUBLE ZONE????? I BET THE COMPANY PAID HER A LOT OF MONEY TO SAY THAT LOL",1248912000,,1568,3.9059561128526648
3710759,4,B001N2WISQ,I should start by saying that I've been doing The Shred for almost a month now and had heard that NMTZ was a good next step.  I was able to hang about halfway through this DVD before my limbs just would not move anymore.  I like the fact that you can customize this workout and choose which circuits you are going to do.  I agree with another review that you do a ton of ab work but it is important to have a strong core so it's not necessarily a bad thing.  I was a little thrown off when she only did one side during the first set of reps of a circuit and then worked the other side during the second set.  Jillian herself admits that this workout is killer as she only does about half of the exercises herself.  But like The Shred I appreciate the fact that is talking you through it and reminding you to make sure you have proper form to avoid injury.  This workout is not for the faint of heart as you do have to push yourself through but I was definitely sore the next day in places that I didn't remember that I had muscles.  For me this has been a great addition to my workout rotation and I certainly feel like I will have No More trouble Zones after doing this for a few weeks.,1248825600,4,1187,4.042735042735043
3710760,5,B001N2WISQ,"I like Jillian because she is no-nonsense - no woo hoos or chirpiness here. This is a seriously tough workout. I am sweating a lot the whole way through. I have been alternating between this workout and the Banish Fat Boost Metabolism cardio workout for a few weeks now. I still haven't made it all the way through either but I am improving, and I definitely have lost some pounds and noticed improved tone.

I have not had a chance to try the Metabolism DVD yet, but did try the No More Trouble Zones last night. It was exactly what I was hoping for!!! It pushes me and my muscles harder than I have before and it is what I was looking for in a great toning workout! Be Warned this is NOT for beginners. I would suggest if you are a beginner, to start this without the weights and maybe only do a couple exercises per circuit. I can't wait to try the Metabolism DVD tonight!

You definitely have to be an advanced exerciser in very good shape to do this work-out properly. She does have a few ""beginner"" modifications, some of which were still far too difficult. I'm not a complainer, I like a hard work-out... but not an impossible one! This is one I'll definitely have to work up to.

I didn't have very high expectations going into it since typically DVD workouts don't really 'do it for me,' but I was (no pun intended) SORELY MISTAKEN!!!
After 2 circuits I was sweating like crazy, heart was pounding and I felt like I was going to vomit!! Part of it might have been because it was hot in my house (the ac was turned off), but I am sure it was mostly because this DVD is HARD!!! I didn't make it past 3 circuits.
This morning, I decided to give it another Go. Did all of the exercises except for the last 2 circuits (ran out of time and had to get to work)...my legs are soooo sore!!!  I DEFINITELY believe that this workout WILL lead to amazing results if you do it on a regular basis...I even rented 30-Day Shred and can't wait to try it!!!

This is an awesome video.  I bought it thinking that it will be another disappointing video.  No Way.  Jillian is motivating and positive throughout the whole thing, she breaks each move down making it easy to follow and the video moves at a fast pace so you don't spend the entire workout wondering when the end will come.

I can see myself shaping up with this video.  I will keep you posted as to what happens, but two weeks in and the love handles are diminishing.  Yay!",1247529600,,635,4.277310924369748

So I bought this video for strength training to complement my jogs. I did it for the first time yesterday and several times I thought I was going to pass out or vomit. It is a great, intense workout not for the faint of heart, but judging by my soreness in all the right spots today, it will work! Just be prepared to work up to actually being able to complete as many reps as the girls in the video. Jillian is cool because she ""keeps it real"" with you and as soon as you think you can't do anymore, the exercise changes or you get to lay down to do abs/arms, so you wobbly legs get a break!

If you're looking for just one DVD to give you strength and cardio I'd look into 30 Day Shred instead but what I prefer about this DVD (and it's companion, Banish Fat Boost Metabolism) is that they're longer (45 minutes each) and give you more of a challenge as they don't have as many beginner modifications as 30 Day Shred does so you don't have the option of 'phoning it in' as Jillian would say.

I like her style and that she will acknowledge which exercises are painful but effective. When she says 'your shoulders should be on fire right now' she's telling it like it is!

I like both of Jillian's new videos, but I don't get bored with No More Trouble Zones like I do with BFBM.  However, I've also had these videos for about a month and a half so that could be why. This workout works your arms soooo much and your triceps will be on fire during the last arm circuit. I always want to quit but I know that my jiggly arms will disappear if I just keep at it!  If I can give any tips though it would be to double up your mat at the end when your lying on your side doing kind of a side plank/side lift (I don't remember what Jillian calls it haha) because by the end of my workout my arms are so tired and its hard for me to concentrate on lifting up my hips and crunching into the exercise all the while having good form when my arms are shaking!  So I put my mat under my arm and that keeps my shoulder and forearm from hurting and I am able to concentrate on crunching into my obliques/love handles! Also, I started out with the 30 day shred for about 2 months and that helped me to get through the entire video the first time I did it.  I think it really helps to start out with the shred if you're a beginner because then you have a higher endurance to pain when doing this video!  This video is intense and will provide results if you just keep at it!  It makes me feel like I am going to pass out and sometimes even throw up when I'm doing the ab circuits because Jillian's working you so hard but it's all worth it in the end! Good luck everyone!",1245715200,4,1669,4.009036144578313
3710786,5,B001N2WISQ,"Other reviewers have already outlined the benefits of this dvd, and I heartily agree.

The only thing that I'd like to point out, and this may have been addressed by other reviewers, is that if you do the entire workout, it is about *55 minutes in length,* not 40 minutes.",1245715200,,272,4.44
3710787,5,B001N2WISQ,"I definitely recommend doing the 30 Day Shred first if you are a beginner.  I read all of the reviews and thought this would be beyond tough, but having done the Shred first really helped, and I actually kept up better than I thought.  Jillian is by far the best instructor I have seen.  She is not annoying, she gives great instructions, and always keeps you motivated.  She also offers variation techniques for those who need to step it down to a less severe workout.  I am already seeing a difference after only one week.  Give it a try and you will be hooked!",1245715200,2,563,4.365384615384615

3710789,5,B001N2WISQ,I really like this video. I can tell the exercises are working. I had a baby a few months ago so this video is not easy for me. It challenges me without being too hard and discouraging me. Jillian's instruction style is nice. She seems friendly without being sunshiny and annoyingly perky. She offers encouragement without sounding phony. She acknowledges some of the moves are tough and if one is too difficult she shows a modification. In short it is a good workout with an instructor that doesn't inspire me to throw things at the TV!,1244764800,,537,4.604166666666667

I started the workout using five pound weights and really couldn't take it, so I switched to 3 pound weights. Even Jillian uses three pound weights throughout the video. The first circut is all arms and pretty difficult; however, the ab circuts mixed in provide a bit of a break for your burning arms and legs. I would definately recommend buying this DVD.

It;s a longer work out.  It seems to take almost an hour, whereas the 30 Day Shred is less than 30 minutes.
Jillian is an amazing trainer.  The explanations are easy to understand and the music is understated.  Its easy to pick up the instructions and there is no awkward choreography to remember. I sweat a ridiculous amount of sweat, which I consider a good thing.  All you need is a mat and a set of 3 pound weights.

3710808,5,B001N2WISQ,"Let me start off by saying that I NEVER EVER ""liked"" exercise. Actually, I loathed it. I hated the monotony of the gym, and got sick of spending $300 a month on my local outdoor womens' bootcamp. I bought the 30day shred which was GREAT but I started to get sick of it and wanted to really get more weights in, so I bought this DVD. HOLY. ****. I LOVE this DVD. I actually LOOK FORWARD to the burn, because I know its working. I can see and feel results after a week.

This DVD kicks it up a few notches and hits WAY more spots than the shred. I use 5lb weights because I used 5lb for shred and wanted to keep it going. Id say a true beginner should start with the suggested 3. There is enough cardio in this workout that you will sweat, but I think it would be a good idea to alternate it with a total cardio workout just to give your body something different. You definitely shouldnt do this every day.
Like the other reviewers said Jillian is extremely motivational. Unlike other perky annoying instructors, Jillian is no nonsense and as soon as you feel like you want to quit, she reminds you WHY you are working out and what your goals are, so you can keep going. She knows this isn't fun and doesnt try to pretend that it is, and reminds us all that WE are accountable for our results! Thank you Jillian!",1243382400,18,1310,4.198412698412699
3710809,5,B001N2WISQ,"I base my reviews on a few items...
Is the cueing so good that I don't have to be a dance instructor to move or have a degree in phys ed?
Does the trainer inspire me?
Does it keep my interest?
Do I feel like it's working and...very importantly...

how many calories does my heart rate monitor tell me I burned and how long was my heart rate in the target zone for weight loss?

This one, according to all above factors, is a winner in my extensive workout dvd library!

Even better, whereas Jillian seemed slightly ""fake tough"" or laughing nervously in other dvds, she no longer does here. She is inspiring, a great coach, and gives great instruction.

just like having a pro trainer in your own living room that you'd be paying hundreds of dollars an hour for...but don't have to!

And, also important, this not only burns instant calories with cardio, but builds muscle with strength training meaning you continue burning calories even while at rest via new muscle and that great metabolism-boosting strength training.

Regardless of your fitness level, she'll inspire you to a great workout.

I recommend this one highly!",1243296000,6,1124,4.704081632653061

I started with one of her DVDs because friends had mentioned how good it was and I can't stop buying them!  They are addictive & fun...but hard work too!  It totally pays off.

3710830,5,B001N2WISQ,"I am almost 60 and in moderately good shape (or so I thought) with daily walks and golf a 2-4 times/week. My muscle tone has really slipped and my mid-section has gotten horrendous this last year.  I tried Wii Fit and like it, but it is more fun than effective.  So I have done this every other day for the last week. It reminds me of the old Jane Fonda tapes that I did years ago.

 My form is still not the best, but I have never sweat like this and I swear my abs are already tighter. I have no skin left on my elbows, but after only four times I no longer need to pause the dvd and I can do all of the reps-or most of them, including the survivor and the side plank moves.  I am sore, but not excessively so, which enables me to keep doing it instead of waiting until I can move again, because that usually means I never get back to it.  My energy the rest of the day I do it is great.

 My goal is to fit back into my clothes soon and be reasonably toned on my 60th in 6 months. Don't know how long it will take me to work up to 5x/week.  I supplement with a yoga dvd on the off days.  I still walk for an hour or so every day.  I am not going to push too hard too fast this time, as that is a recipe for failure. I am motivated to keep at it and do as much as this old saggy body can handle.  Thanks Jillian.  I love Biggest Loser.",1241136000,15,1337,3.7661870503597124
3710831,5,B001N2WISQ,"I have all of Jillian's videos and they all kick butt, but this one I believe is the greatest. At about 45 minutes, this video concentrates on those areas that women and even some men have trouble toning. I use all of Jillian's videos -- 20 minute DVD each day and ""No More Trouble Zones"" on the 4th day. I have started noticing muscles, I just didn't know I had, my triceps, quads, hamstrings, butt, abdomen and more. Don't get me wrong, it also takes eating healthy, multi-vitamins and at least your eight glasses of water along with exercise to lose weight. However, if you are in the process of losing weight right now or want to start and also want to start toning your body, this is absolutely the perfect exercise DVD. It is a hard DVD and took me a few times to get through the entire DVD, but if you are consistent and try your hardest, you will see results. Thanks Jillian, you truly made me a believer!!

At first I only did half of the dvd because it kicked my butt so badly.  The next day I finished the dvd.  The latter half is a bit easier than the first.  I did that for the first week and also did 10-15 mins on the elliptical first.  Now I am doing the whole dvd start to finish and it feels awesome! She may not do exactly the same number of reps on each leg or arm but I don't think it's that big of a deal if you are using her dvds as a  supplement to your workouts versus using the dvd exclusively.  I kind of like the fact that she doesn't count out each rep but instead talks to you throughout the workout about the importance of us to remind ourselves why we are working out and what our goal is.  I really enjoy this dvd the most.  My next favorite is 30-day shred because it's a short 20-min, intense workout, then the cardio-blast dvd...that one is a killer! It keeps your heart rate pumped the whole time.",1240617600,,1316,4.12156862745098

Whether one is accustomed to working out everyday or not, Jillian's work out is intense and involves every part of your body at a non-stop but smooth pace.",1240617600,,276,4.729166666666667
3710839,4,B001N2WISQ,"This workout is so good for toning you up and you will definately feel the benefits of doing it, for the next day or two at least.  You will work almost every muscle you could possibly think of here, and yet at the same time, you're having fun (in a working out type of way), and getting terrific instruction and encouragement from Jillian.  She pulls no punches here and if you stick with what she says and what they do, you'll get almost no rest from start till end and this helps you get maximum results.
She sometimes gets the background exercisers to come to the forefront and shows us proper form while showing us what they're doing so you know how to perform each move with the best form possible.
If there is one thing only that I don't like about this workout (and for serious exercisers it might also be a problem), I cannot stand how there is background music, yet no exercise is performed in time to the music and so it can be a little distracting.  You're going at the speed of the beat, and they are in a whole different time to you ... I think once you have the workout down, then probably best to turn the sound right down if you find it annoyng like I do.
Other than that one quirk, I highly recommend this dvd.  It's fantastic and if done even 3 times a week, you will get amazing results for sure.  Jillian is very encouraging and helpfull and while she's tough, she makes you work to reap the benefits.  I really love this.",1240358400,10,1443,4.267399267399267

Jillian is crazy!!!!  This dvd is motivation for me.  I've decided to do it once a week and do my other jillian workouts along with Mel B's new one the rest of the week.  I will say this, with Jillian's workout, you actually see and feel the difference.  I was so sore the next day but it was a good sore.

3710848,5,B001N2WISQ,"First of all I want to say I am NOT an active person.  I don't exercise, I eat anything I want, & I smoke.  I recently gained a minor amount of weight after starting a new medication, and being that I'm relatively thin to begin with, I knew I had to get rid of the extra weight and just get myself into better shape.  I've tried the gym, and that's just not for me.  I've tried other videos that didn't leave me feeling like I did any work afterwards.

I searched around Amazon, came across this video, read the reviews, and decided I would give it a try.  I finally got to work with this video after 3 weeks of procrastinating, and man, did it kick my butt!  I wanted to give up just after the warm-ups, but I knew I had to stick with it.  I will admit, this isn't a exercise video for amatuers like myself, but I want to stick with this, and I had muscles hurting the next day (and a few days after that!) that I didn't even know existed!  I've been now working out to 'No More Trouble Zones' for 2 weeks every other day or two, and its causing such a change in my life.  I'm motivated to work out everyday, eat better and QUIT SMOKING!

I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who's in decent shape who really wants to tone up.  I'm very please with the range of circuits (and that I don't have to do all of them every time) and the results I'm seeing so far.  I look forward to seeing my final results!",1239494400,15,1406,4.087591240875913

It is very well cued.  The warm and cool down are about 5 minutes each,  leaving the rest of the hour as a kick-butt, non-stop toning and sculpting session.  My arms and legs were killing me!  For the most part, you will work your arms and legs as combo moves in order to raise your heart rate and calorie burn.
Also, I like that the ab work is incorporated into the workout and not just thrown in at the end.  Speaking of abs, ""Whew"" is all I have to say.
You will be glad with the old school no frills workout!  It will change your body.",1239321600,2,693,4.126865671641791

Once again, Jillian does it again, challenging your body to CHANGE-- PAIN builds character of the mind and of the body.
No Pain NO gain, yes cliche, but gosh darn it.... YOU'll feel soo empowered and glad you did it, you'll wanna do it again all over again.
Conquer this DVD! Work this DVD into the ground til you can get no more out of it and you're using the heaviest weights you can (though you might need to start w/none at all, and may not be able to finish the DVD) YOU CAN grow in strenth even if you can't do one push up, try try try even if you fall of that horse til you can saddle up all on your own and ride that pony!
You will succeed! Remember what Jillian says on the Biggest Loser, ""You can tell me that you choose to quit, but DO NOT TELL ME that you cannot do it..""
So, let us tell ourselves, ""We choose to conquer this dvd and we will not quit, and YES--Jillian, we CAN do it""
So now, buy this DVD and conquer with me.",1239235200,3,1101,4.009090909090909
3710852,5,B001N2WISQ,"I knew Jillian would offer a great workout when I ordered this DVD since I'm a fan of hers from The Biggest Loser show and I wasn't disappointed.
She is at her amazing best with a flow of modivating talk that instructs and keeps you focused on the target muscle groups. She seems to intuitively know just when you need to hear something to keep you going.
The workout is 40 solid minutes (plus 5mins. each for warm up & cooldown) of high energy upper and lower body exercises alternating just when your muscles beg for it. Jillian's approach to battling the Trouble Zones is through circuit training with cardio. Each circuit lasts roughly 5 minutes and offers about 5 exercises using weights, which are repeated before moving on to the next circuit. The pace is kept up to keep your heart pounding. I liked this for two reasons: I had time to master the movement and the second time around I really feel the burn!
My opinion of this workout is that it's not for a beginner. By beginner I mean someone that only gets off the couch to saunter to the fridge for another snack. She offers another DVD ""30 Day Shred"" that might be better for the devoted couch potatoe looking to make a change and wondering where to start. This workout is definately challenging and should be worked up to.
I am in my 50's, in good shape and recently canceled my gym membership to save money. This DVD coupled with Jillian's cardio blast, ""Banish Fat Boost Metabolism"" is filling that daily fitness requirment for me now. I also own the before mentioned ""30 Day Shred"" which I use if I'm in a time crunch, that DVD offers three 20 minute workouts each one harder than the last. I've done all three and it's true but she shows you the ""cheats"" to make some of the more difficult moves easier until you work up to them.
I think the ""No More Trouble Zones"" DVD is a perfect, stand alone exercise DVD if you have other sources of exercise like walking, biking, swimming or a gym. However if you want a variety of motivating, challenging, mind/body changing regimen I suggest getting all three of Jillian Michaels DVDs.",1239235200,2,2093,4.510526315789473

I normally just run but running alone does not fix problem areas, so I thought I would try this since she promised to rid me of my trouble zones.  To my amazement this was a great DVD and an integral part of my workout routine.  I have not seen results in my thighs yet but the workouts are so good, I know I wiell soon.  Even if you have done it a million times you will never get bored becasue she shows you how to make the workout more difficult if you need it.  It is tough but effective.

Also, I have been improving areas I didn't expect such as my arms and abs which I see results already.

The only reason why one would not see results is if they did not do the DVD consistently.  Overall, well worth the money.",1239062400,,814,4.0375

If you do the whole DVD, it's a very long workout with nonstop action.  I usually split it up and do the first 4 circuts one day and then do the 3 core circuts another day.  One warning- I wouldn't recommend if you are new to working out.",1238803200,2,407,4.259740259740259

i only have a few more pounds to lose and after i get to that goal will continue using this video to maintain my weight. since i didn't have a big number to lose when i started it i can't attest to the lose 5 pounds a week claim, but i don't doubt that you could if you did this consistently enough and were eating well.

i use both this and the banish fat, boost metabolism dvd and love them both, although this one does make me sweat more so i feel like i get a better workout from this one. it's very tough though.... i've been using both dvds for a month, and still can't go all the way through the workout without resting at least a rep or two somewhere along the way.",1238544000,,1141,4.04424778761062

3710868,3,B001N2WISQ,"I like this workout, especially because it is almost an hour (it's about 50 minutes not including the final stretch), and some of the moves are tough -- however, what drives me nuts is that Jillian does NOT count her reps. If you count them you'll notice that on one leg she does 12, then the next she will do 15. Then she will do 17 for another move. There is no consistency.

I also don't think this workout is that killer... I'm not sure what weights everyone else is using, but I use 5lbs for this. On the DVD they only use 3lbs. Maybe I need to increase to 8lbs, but she emphasizes ""light weights, high reps."" 3lbs does nothing for me. I have been using the Firm workouts for ages though, so I am used to lifting more weight.
 Also, I feel like this is mainly a core workout - it feels like you spend about half the time in plank pose. It would have been nice if there were more lower body work.

For those of you who live in apts and are concerned about jumping moves, the only real jumping is in the warm up for jumping jacks. So I think it's fine to do this workout if you live in an apt with neighbors.",1237248000,332,1111,4.063926940639269

This DVD is completely challenging, and it works the heck out of my arms, thighs, and abs. Somehow, though there are no real ""cardio"" segments, Jillian makes me pant and sweat from Circuit 1 on by ""keeping it moving"" and making most of the moves ""combination"" moves (working more than one muscle at a time). By the time the DVD is over, I feel...very, very done! But in a good way. I've seen great results with my arms and legs, and it will also kick your endurance up a notch.

While I do feel I got a better workout than in the banish fat video, I still feel like it was missing something. I missed the cardio that goes on in the 30 Day Shred, and I don't like how you do abs all at once in this video.

If I feel up to it I can pick another circuit that day.  Plus I love how in each circuit she has a couple minutes of 3 different exercises and then repeats them.  That way by the time you feel you can't go on, she changes to a different exercise.  The circuit goes by in no time.  Plus she always pleasent to listen too and great music.

By circuit 4 I'm usually dying so its really rewarding to get through the whole thing.  I own all of Jillian's DVDs and not one of them kills like this one does.  The tricep circuit, and the viscious plank circuit kick your butt. My butt is sore as we speak.  Also, Jillian claims to be using 3lb weights for this one, but I use 6lbs to feel the burn.

I can't afford my local gym ($70/month...you've got to be kidding, right?) so I justified buying her two new workouts (less than half the price of a month at the gym) and WOW, I am so impressed.  They're totally different, so it's hard to recommend one over the other, but this workout is definitely harder.  I don't think I've worked out this hard since I was in high school volleyball.  I think someone said in a review ""she tones it down so you can go the full 45 minutes""...bologna sandwiches...you work HARD the WHOLE TIME.  You will be dripping with sweat and feel so good about yourself.  I really recommend committing to this kind of work out.  I don't know about anyone else, but when I can get through 40 minutes of an intense workout like this, I feel like I can do about anything.  I've been doing this workout since right when it first came out and feel it's helped me get past a plateau that I'd hit after doing the shred for a few months.  If you want a work out that doesn't mess around and delivers solid results...this is the ticket.  Thanks Jillian!",1235865600,4,1223,4.301310043668122

I've been doing The Shred after this workout because I feel I need more,
I like Banish Fat, Boot Metabolism much more, this is a little boring after you do it about a month",1235779200,2,526,3.8256880733944953
3710883,5,B001N2WISQ,"So I'm just getting into workout tapes. I run once week (because I have to) but I mostly work with weights, the ball and kettle-bells. But I'd rather do a routine than run anywhere so I've been looking into these fitness dvd's.

I settled on Jillian after getting the Biggest Loser Workout about 3 weeks ago. I did enjoy Bob (he's hilarious) but Jillian's workout did get me pretty winded...and it was only 10 minutes long!
LOL.
So I said, ""I wonder if she has any cds of her own'.

Based on the reviews and my initial impression of her I bought this workout and the (Banish Fat Boost metabolism) dvd

I really do like this dvd.

--Her exercises are challenging.
--She utilizes circuit training. Each segment is only 6 minutes long.
--She works multiple muscle-groups at once. Which I like.
--I like her 'let's get down to business' attitude. Great motivator.
--She has some KILLER arm/leg exercises (circuit 4, in particular). There's this one move where you hold 2 dumbbells in both hands over your head and you drop to your knees and come back to a standing position (one leg at a time, of course!).
I. WAS. BURNING! I had to drop one weight to stay in the game.

During the ab/leg circuit (can't remember which) my boyfriend had to come into the room because I was making so much noise. He just stood in the door and laughed at me nonstop. I was on the floor squirming around from plank position to my back...struggling, whimpering and 'panting' like a little animal!
He said, ""Baby...is it THAT serious?""
LOL
Y'know how it is--when your body is tired and you're fighting through an exercise to squeeze out one more...?
I was DETERMINED to get through that circuit! LMBAO!

I'm not exactly sore. But I personally don't think that this would be too challenging for a beginner. Listen to your body. Slow the pace if you must. Just keep moving if you can. Do as much of the circuit as you can until you're able to complete the tape.

Also, thanks to be military, I have bad knees and stress fx's in both legs. Jillian incorporates jumping jacks/jump into her cardio exercises/warmups. It keeps your heart rate up but it can be hard on the joints (if you have problems in that area). I can't always hop on one leg.
My solution?
Just modify the exercise. I still perform the jumping jacks movement but my feet don't leave the ground.",1235692800,40,2332,4.538095238095238
3710884,5,B001N2WISQ,"I love this workout DVD!  The majority of the reviews already mention the content we all seem to enjoy so I won't go in to that.  However, I'd like to add one thing I haven't yet seen mentioned.  There is a part in the workout where Jillian says that she likes to think of our arms as the one part of our body most people will see naked (and that's why she works them so much in this DVD).  It is so true! After doing this DVD a few times each week since it's been released (along with my other workouts) I notice a true difference in my arms...they are stronger and look super toned!  I'd have no issues with people seeing my arms naked!",1235692800,,638,4.072

This workout is fantastic she hits every muscle group, and I can just feel my muscles burning. I can't wait for tank top season.

This workout has weight-based circuits, and all of them are fantastic.  She really mixes up the intensity and what muscle groups are being worked.  During the first ab circuit, I thought my abs were going to implode, and had to take some breaks during it.  However, she doesn't keep on working the same muscles over and over--she gives your abs a break, and then moves on to other muscle groups.  Jillian really challenges you in every circuit (there are 7, as other reviews have detailed), and does each move so you are *just* about ready to die, and then switches to another move.

Although I got through the entire workout, it was still a challenge for me, and I consider myself to be an intermediate/advanced exerciser.  I love the option, however, of being able to choose to do only some of the circuits, especially when I am short on time (I work out in the morning before I go to work).

All in all, you get a big bang for your buck with this workout, and it should be a part of anyone's workout rotation if you're serious about getting results.  Thanks, Jillian, for making another highly effective workout!",1235174400,7,2525,6.244956772334294
3710889,5,B001N2WISQ,"I've been using this DVD for just over a week, and I love it. I've been doing the 30 Day Shred for about 2 months prior, and wanted to kick things up a notch or two. This DVD does it.
As other reviews have pointed out, Jillian organizes the workout around circuits. There's a 5 minute warm-up and a 5-minute cool-down, and the entire workout from opening to closing credits (all circuits) is right at 55 minutes.
I love this DVD. I can even grudgingly get behind the ""surrenders""; these are evil. My kneecaps hate me today. I think I may add in some knee circles in the warm-up to help get my knees ready for this special form of torture.
If you cannot do lunges, you may want to get a different DVD. Jillian is definitely a fan of lunges in this workout - effective, but can be hard on the knees. I use 2# weights...they use 3#, but my 3's are on loan to a friend. Oh, well.
I'm able to get in a pair of pants I wasn't able to button just after Christmas. I'm building muscle, and I feel STRONG. Thank you, Jillian, for raising the bar with this workout!
UPDATE: I found a pair of 3# weights, and will probably move to 5# in the next month or so. I'm still very impressed with this workout, and it has become part of my morning routine. My husband walked in one day when I was doing push-ups, and just stood there and watched in awe...he had no idea I could do push ups! I love it.
I should probably also add that I do not do the Surrenders on most days. Instead, I box like you do in 30 Day Shred in Level Three (squat with weights). The lunges are enough on my knees for now, and I figure the cardio/weight combo of boxing makes up for skipping Surrenders.",1234742400,10,1659,4.139318885448916

Of course, being an avid ""30-Day Shred"" user since it came out last year, I'm still getting used to the 50 minute long work-out as opposed to the 25 minutes taken with the ""30-Day Shred"".

3710892,5,B001N2WISQ,"This amazing DVD by Jillian Michaels is a 50 minute workout, including warm-up and cooldown, that includes innovative toning moves to target trouble spots. While not for the true beginner, I think this workout would be good for all levels, because she shows modifications for beginners and advanced exercisers (although sometimes not until halfway through the set). Also, you move at a slightly faster pace throughout, so you get a cardio benefit from this workout as well, although its' main focus is toning your body into great shape. The circuit nature of the workout means that you continue to burn more calories even after the workout is over.

The workout is composed of seven 6-minute circuits that leave no muscle unworked.  You can choose to do the entire 40 minute circuit or just select the body parts you want to focus on so you can focus on your ""problem areas"".  Each of the circuits consists of 5 different exercises that you do for 30 seconds each, then repeat the entire sequence for a total of 2 sets of each move.  Jillian has a lot of unique, effective compound moves (compound means that you work the upper and lower body at the same time).  She uses 3 lb. weights and a mat for the workout but you could adjust the amount of weight to suit your needs and use a blanket if you don't have a mat. I've included a breakdown of all the moves below:

Warmup: Basic marching in place, jumping rope (no rope needed), arm circles, skaters (simulate speed skating) and jumping jacks. Then you repeat the entire sequence for a complete five minutes.

Circuit #1- Shoulder & Legs
- Squat with Shoulder Press
- Backwards Lunge with Side Shoulder Raise (repeat on other leg)
- Chair Squat with Front Shoulder Raise
- Front Shoulder PressOuts

Circuit #2- Chest & Abs
- Chest Press with a Crunch
- Chest Fly with Double Leg Raise
- Bicycle Crunches
- Squirms (lying down with knees bent. lift head and shoulder blades off  ground and alternate bending to the side and tapping your heels).
- PushUp

Circuit #3- Biceps & Butt
- Deadlift with Hammer Curl
- Static Squat with Concentration Curl
- Front Lunge with Wide Grip Curl (repeat on other leg)
- Side Lunge with Biceps Curl

Circuit #4- Thighs & Triceps
- Chair Pose with Triceps Kickback
- Sumo Squat with Overhead Triceps Press
- Surrender (step back and down to kneeling position then stand up again)
- Forward Lunge with Triceps Pushback (repeat on other leg)

Circuit #5- Core
- Double Crunches
- Twisting Plank
- Plank with ToeTaps (repeat with other leg)
- Windshield Wipers (lying down lift both legs and move from side-to-side)

Circuit #6- Upper Body & Core
- Plank with Back Rows
- Superman
- Scissor Kicks
- Pelvic Thrusts (repeat on other leg)

Circuit #7- Lower Body & Core
- Side Plank
- Side Lying Leg Raise
- Inner Thigh Raise
- Donkey Kicks
- Fire Hydrant with Kick

Then relax with a nice cooldown.

Overall, out of the over 200 workout DVDs I own this is one of the best and I highly recommend it for great results.  Jillian is motivating without being too peppy and cues well. If you stick with this workout you'll be ready for short summer shorts and bikinis in no time at all.  Enjoy! :)",1234310400,"1,834",3171,4.552816901408451

There is NO WAY that you cannot shape up quickly and completely if you follow this workout!  Jillian ROCKS!  Her combinations keep you moving and working and sweating, but she has a way of making you able to keep up, through both her motivating talk, as well as the way she combines the moves.  She has made me a big fan of circuits - you can endure much more!  Her explanations of exactly what muscles you're targeting REALLY make you motivated to push extra hard, as well as focus on them to really bring on the intensity!

I started off with the ""30 Day Shred""--one of my favorite Jillian videos. After a month, I switched over to the ""6 Week Six-Pack"" which I've also used before. That video has never been my absolute favorite, and now I remember why--it just doesn't seem to give my abs the workout they need, not to mention the structure of the workout makes it seem really long and also a bit manic. So after a week of that video, I gave this one a try. It was my first time trying the ""No More Trouble Zones,"" and it's quickly becoming one of my favorite Jillian workouts. My abs were sore after the first workout. They were never sore after the ""6 Week Six-Pack."" After Day 2, my abs and my inner thighs are sore, which is great! This workout is dynamic; I never get bored, my body is always moving, and yet, it has an easier flow than ""6 Week Six-Pack."" I never feel rushed in this workout, even though we're moving through the circuits quickly. Can't say enough about this workout.

Each circuit combines upper and lower body for max calorie burn. The 1st and 4th circuit are def the toughest for me. Go figure they both work shoulders.
