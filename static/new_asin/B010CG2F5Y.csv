8721997,5,B010CG2F5Y,I've seen this movie so many times. It's a B movie but Sam is awesome in it!,1473724800,,76,3.5294117647058822
8721998,5,B010CG2F5Y,"I'm a big fan of IE Cinema and Shock-o-Rama released movies.  Anything from Snow Sharks to Psycho Sisters you'll see on my shelf.

Rags has the feel of a low budget independent feature with a little something extra.  The story might be talky at times, but what helps the story is the plot-driven situation and the surprising element of mystery.  It's not until the end that you fully understand whether this is a drug-fueled nightmare or something truly evil.  (don't worry, it's evil).  You're also provided with a compelling version of male ""birth"".  Love it.

Fun stuff for people who like independent features.  Looks slicker than most as well.  Highly enjoyed it.  Wild Eye Releasing's putting out some great low budge titles.",1447632000,,731,4.909836065573771
