It was the only Yngwie dvd I needed to complete my collection and is now my favorite of Yngwie's ""rock"" genre performances. I also HIGHLY recommend The Concerto for electric guitar in E flat taped with the new japan philharmonic which is also a superb performance. Yngwie is no doubt having a good night on the Budakan performance. The dvd is loaded too, lots of songs, semi decent audio, guitar solos, drum solo, and a nice keyboard solo. Also on the dvd are video interviews with the ""Yng"" and footage of him making his way thru the venue from the vehicle that dropped him off before the show with his ex-wife Amberdawn.  The band line up (one of my favorites and one of the best and most powerful, in my opinion) was Yngwie on the guitar (of course) Michael Vescera-lead vocals,Matts Olausson-all keyboards,and Mike Terrana-drums. Im not sure who is playing bass on this tour. In my opinion, the price is a little steep on this dvd but worth it to a die-hard fan.",1133568000,2,1036,4.56989247311828

8330084,3,B001OB9L5Y,"There seem to be a number of versions of this around. Some other reviewers have lamented the lack of a menu on this DVD to select songs or the interview footage from. However mine has one..... perhaps there are earlier and later versions out there?

Whatever the truth of that matter this is a pretty live document of all that is good and bad about Yngwie Malmsteen. At 1:47 you are getting your moneys worth and that includes a few snippets of interviews with the man himself. It is a little weird to have the concerte interrupted by interview footage so normally I just skip through it to concentrate on the music. The stage show here is fairly stripped back and workmanlike. But then this isn't KISS is it... Beyond that the sound quality seems OK and the fact you have Michael Vescera singing on this is hugely helpful. His performance seems so effortless it is a shame he hasn't found a vehicle that was more financially rewarding.

Anyway, Yngwie is the centrepiece here and the camera follows him relentlessly. Which is fair enough I suppose but it does make it a little different from so many of your other concert DVD's that it can get a little weird. His playing is of course superb and while many of his songs (especially the latter years) may not exactly be barnstormers the set list here is pretty good. Alas not as much from the rather brilliant Trilogy or Marching Out albums but one must move on I suppose!

Beyond all the above the packaging on my copy is pretty minimal, a rather 'pirated copy' level of presentation though mine did come with a bonus video clip to the song Forever One. No inner booklet etc at all.

For the Yngwie fan if you can pick it up cheaply this is a good buy as it captures him with a good singer backing up a reasonable album (Seventh Sign) with a gig containing some of his finer early/mid 90's moments. Others may find the myopic attention on the guitarist and the lack of early classic songs and the budget nature of the release off-putting.",1402012800,,1989,4.486187845303867
8330085,3,B001OB9L5Y,its obviously burned from vhs to dvd picture s---- audio is just as bad. learned a lesson on this one!!!!!,1355702400,,106,4.35
8330086,5,B001OB9L5Y,"I picked up this dvd over the holidays on sale for about $12 not expecting much as far as quality, especially since this show was filmed in 1994 (probably on VHS). At the same time, I've seen Yngwie live in Cleveland about 7 or 8 yrs ago during the Attack! Tour and he was phenomenal! I've seen tons of concerts including Vai, Satriani, Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Pantera on and on and I've never seen anyone play his heart out and give his all on stage the way Yngwie did...he played for almost 3 hrs and even signed things for fans after the show in the wee hours of the morning. I'll never forget the show.

Basically, I already knew it'd be a great show and probably sound very good. But when I actually watched the show, I was floored! This DVD's quality is awesome. I couldn't be more pleased. I watched mine through my PS3 and HD tv. You can tell that the dvd wasn't made this year but it was extremely good considering its age. There are lots of close-ups of Yngwie playing and lots of different angles. It was well-done. I really have no complaints...even though Yngwie uses a bit of the fog machine for shows, it wasn't a problem. No complaints. But had this dvd been made today with our current standards of angles sound and video quality etc, this dvd would get a 7 or 8 out of 10 still.

As for audio, it sounds perfect...must be from the master sound board. Also, Its loud even on 14....sometimes I need to put regular DVDs on 20-25 to get them loud enough, especially concert dvds, so the sound is very good as well.

Also, Yngwie plays tons of songs on the DVD, not all are listed.

Overall, this video is the next best thing to seeing him live! I can't wait till next tour. Yngwie is the very best living guitar player today...or is at least equal to the very best living players today.

If this DVD was lost, stolen or damaged I'd definitely buy another.",1326067200,2,1874,4.358166189111748
8330087,5,B001OB9L5Y,This dvd starts out with a bang and does not stop. Very entertaing from start to end. Yngwie is without a doubt the best guitarist ever. Good song selections newer and classic. I love this dvd and I love Yngwie.,1296000000,,211,4.3
8330088,5,B001OB9L5Y,"I am not a journalist, I am a musician and a fan of all things hard rock and heavy metal. This DVD has great sound and footage. Sure, no menu page. But that does not hurt the actual concert which is what I pay for.
So, over all an A-.

(Yes, the same review as 'Live Animal')",1265155200,,275,3.824561403508772
8330089,5,B001OB9L5Y,"OK, he shreds like no other. First, the bad. There's no menu when this DVD boots. You can shuffle through the songs easy enough, but you can't highlight ANYTHING from any menu. You have to skip through like a CD.

Now, the good. This is Yngwie at full throttle in 1994. The entire DVD is mostly him and the singer, which is great on both counts. This video is a guitarist's dream. It has lots and lots of up close Yngwie - you can clearly see and enjoy his technique. Forget the left hand - he frets like the rest of us mortals. I believe his technique hinges on his right hand. I've NEVER seen such economy of motion in my life (I'm 55). This is must-have Yngwie in all his glory. He gets a little full of himself, especially toward the end, but he certainly deserves it.

Also, the sound of this DVD is perfect - no problems whatsoever. Especially considering that it's probably run off from VHS type technology.

Bonus - there's some things not on the playlist. Like Yngwie playing AND singing Hendrix' Red House - what a gas!",1244505600,6,1029,4.348958333333333
8330090,4,B001OB9L5Y,"Mike Vescera is freaking awesome to watch but towards the end of the show his voice gets annoying and he has NO CHARISMA - looks like he got sick of the tour already.

Yngwie showcases himself so much that he accidently reveals that he only has 5 or so stage tricks.

Great DVD, but c'mon Mike, wake up! And really, bright white tennis shoes with shorts and a leather jacket? LOL",1242518400,3,379,4.323943661971831
8330091,3,B001OB9L5Y,The show is great but this DVD lacks menu and a proper intro. The good news for me is some unnecesary stuff in between the songs have been removed. Example is Yngwie introducing his wife Amber. I got this DVD yesterday from amazon.,1240358400,4,231,4.395348837209302
