3434286,3,B0019D4E0E,"Some of this film is dubbed and some of it has sub titles and it switches back and forth the whole movie. If it weren't for that issue, I would give it a higher rating. It has many of the top kung fu stars of that era together in one film.",1409529600,,239,3.7058823529411766
3434287,4,B0019D4E0E,"David Chiang , i been a fan since the ealry 70's at the drive in movies. This is one of the more better stories for a hong kong style martial arts films, just a campy and silly , but still has the old school Shaw Bros flow to it.",1404691200,,229,3.693877551020408
3434288,1,B0019D4E0E,"This movie is not realistic in it's depiction of armed combat and I wasn't really expecting it to be. It's basically a kung-fu flick where the Chinese soldiers take on the attacking Japanese hordes with fists, feet and edged weapons. Occasionally they will shoot someone or throw a grenade that wipes out large numbers of the attackers. The death scenes are wildly exaggerated as well with soldiers doing backward flips or wildly jumping into the air as they are mowed down by machine guns. I don't have a problem with any of that as it was pretty much what I expected considering the actors and producers involved. I really enjoy these Shaw Brothers productions and have dozens of their movies in my collection. The problem with this movie is the quality of the disc presentation itself. While the picture and color is fine the dubbing is a hit and miss affair that often switches to subtitles, and then back to dubbing. the real problem though is the disc freezing and artifacting, especially towards the ending. In fact, the movie locked up totally about five minutes before the end. Not worth watching again with those problems. Perhaps if this was presented by a studio like Dragon Dynasty I would pick up another copy but the quality here is too risky to recommend for purchase.",1328227200,2,1284,4.762331838565022
3434289,5,B0019D4E0E,"I've seen this movie in 1977 when i was 13 years old and seeing how this movie depicts the heroic efforts of the 7 brave Chinese Soldiers makes me shed tears, and pity those brave soldiers who lost their lives for the sake of our freedom.  Am proud to be a CHINESE.",1327536000,,265,4.096153846153846

3434301,2,B0019D4E0E,"Lots of battle scenes but flaky as heck.  Also, the weapons (machine guns and tanks) portrayed in this film are clearly American tanks circa 1955
and the machine guns are American 50 cal's.  That kind of inconsistency ruins the movie for me.  Not worth watching.",1486598400,2,262,4.777777777777778
3434302,5,B0019D4E0E,I thoroughly enjoyed.,1486166400,,21,6.333333333333333
3434303,1,B0019D4E0E,"Why SB director Chang decided to do a WWII war epic--when he never had the cash to do a credible job--is a puzzle. Most of the battle scenes look silly, and it's difficult to believe that a platoon of Japanese soldiers would all fight one or two Chinese soldiers with bayonets and swords when they could easily just shoot them. Tanks shown in flick are Vietnam war vintage, not 1940 sort. Classic kungfu villains play enemy troops in this one.

Bottom line: if you're going to make a movie about modern war, don't use kungfu movie methods",1485993600,,538,4.546391752577319

3434309,2,B0019D4E0E,"I would give it a 2.5, on the low end, Was this a true story?  Or like any Hollywood based on a true story movie where the incident happened,  but the script was written by a committee who had no military experience.",1485475200,,216,4.119047619047619
8273609,5,B0019D4E0E,"This is a true historical World War 2 story happened in mainland China by the Great Wall. A little background,
after the party known today as KMT(kuo min tang) (currently in Taiwan), fought 11 times to over thrown the Qing Dynasty to try to established as far as I know the only other democracy country in Asia besides US. As they tried to run the China as a democracy country, Japan invaded and claiming to rule China in 3 months but miserably failed and ended up a more than 8 years of war trapped in the mainland.

This film was created in 1976, a film that was more than 40 years old, a lot of reviewer here FAILED to take this into consideration. This film shown back than China was fighting Japan with very limited resource. The director turned this war movie into a kung fu movie, in my opinion it was a pretty interesting idea. Didn't a typical modern movie Star War looked like this except no skywalker? If watching this film from this perspective, it would definitely be more enjoyable of this true historical war event.",1500681600,,1030,4.4787234042553195
8273610,3,B0019D4E0E,"Dubbed in English, this movie is like the Alamo of the United States.  It's not a movie kung-fu movie really.  It's about seven Chinese soldiers who found themselves at a Chinese fort.  The Japanese invaded China during WWII, and is about to reach the fort.  With only seven Chinese soldiers they were able to hold the fort against hundreds of Japanese troops, tanks, and airplanes for as long as they could until the Chinese Nationalist Army can get there.  If any one knows the history of China, the flag displayed in this movie is not the communist China, it's the Taiwanese democratic army.  This was a period when China was divided between the communist and the democrats, a revolutionary war that was disrupted by the Japanese.  Anyway, this is a long two hour movie with some fight scenes ranging from guns and tanks, to a few hand-to-hand combat, not exactly a kung-fu movie.  Choreography was okay, but could be better.  Throughout the movie, each soldier either thinks back in time or talks about the past as to why they either hate the Japanese or ended up in the Chinese army.  For its time, this was an epic movie as they had hundreds of soldiers in a few scenes.  Impressive amount of tanks and extras used in this movie, but the story was mundane at times.",1497744000,,1271,4.604444444444445
8273611,1,B0019D4E0E,"Do you love overacting and kung fu (two inseparable things)?  if you do and you like WWII history or dislike the Imperial Japanese, then you would give this 5 stars.  This is kung fu meets WWII complete with flashbacks, illogical military tactics, and sword fighting (something which happened so frequently during the second World war).",1494633600,,336,5.090909090909091
8273612,4,B0019D4E0E,"Quite good, Americans have almost totally forgotten the hardships endured by the Chinese in WW2. China tied down over a million Japanese troops during the war and payed a heavy price.",1491523200,,183,4.935483870967742
8273613,5,B0019D4E0E,"While director Chang Cheh is better known for his classic kung fu flicks, he ventures out to make a film about the stand 7 soldiers make against the Japanese army. He grabbed the finest actors for this one with Ti Lung, David Chiang, Chen Kuan Tai, Fu Sheng, Chi Kuan Chun, Lee Yi Min & Pai Ying as the soldiers. The Japanese army featured Wang Lung Wei, Leung Kar Yan & Gordon Liu. While there were plenty of bullets flying, there was a great deal of kung fu & bayonet fighting as well. And I loved the way Cheh gave background for each of the soldiers. Sure, some of the weaponry & tanks conflict with the movie's historical settings but I enjoyed this despite of that. All the fighting was great especially Chi Kuan Chun, Fu Sheng & Chen Kuan Tai's huge sword. A must see for SB fans! English dubbed btw...",1491264000,2,809,4.328947368421052
