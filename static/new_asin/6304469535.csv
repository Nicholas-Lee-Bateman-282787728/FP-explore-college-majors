886701,5,6304469535,"I believe Domingo's Lohengrin is a complete interpretation only on video. Even people who had issues with his Decca recording would be hard pressed to point out a more impressive Lohengrin as a stage presence. Domingo is a  youthful, virile, handsome Lohengrin, and his latin colors add a specific  passionate-dignified flavor to the role. This is dramatically appropriate  considering Lohengrin's background. I am not at all a blind fan of Domingo,  but repeat viewing of this production, which I first purchased over a year  ago, fills me with nothing less than awe for what he accomplished here. It  seems he had more time for rehearsals than on some productions, as every  movement of his and every gesture is dramatically well calculated. He is  actually convincing as the quintessential white night in shining armor who  commutes on a white swan to save wronged maidens, the very embodiment of  Christian virtue.
Struder is an enigma to me. It seems there is a split  between her conception of roles in the Italian repertoire, which I find  characterless, and what she does in the German repertoire, which is very  impressive. I would like to surmise that being a highly disciplined artist,  she tries to emulate the Italian ideal of a soprano in her Italian roles  (mainly Verdi). Some people feel the Italians like their sopranos a little  bland. Here she gives a glorious interpretation of Elsa, vulnerable and  sweet voiced, the pinnacle of victimized feminine innocence,  but (unlike  De Los Angeles for example) very powerful in a Wagnerian way.
The rest of  the cast is star studded and the singers not only stand up to their  reputation, but are also very satisfying in an almost physical way, right  down to the smaller roles.
As usual from the Vienna State Opera, this is  a traditional production in the best sense of the word. It brings out the  embryonic Parsifal in Lohengrin, In the sense that Parsifal is a religious  stage ceremony.
There is no Vienna State Opera production on DVD yet, and  this should be a good candidate to be the first. Another Lohengrin that  should be made commercially available is the recent co-production of Gran  Teatre del Liceu/Hamburgische Staatsoper directed by Peter Konwitschny.",959212800,49,2234,4.981029810298103

886778,4,6304469535,"This is the first production I've seen of Lohengrin. The singing is excellent and the costumes are fine. The staging is a bit stuffy. One can tell this is an older production. However, if you've never seen Lohengrin, this isn't a bad one to see first. I was surprised at the delicacy of the prelude to Act 1. The music was ethereal.",1390348800,,332,4.370967741935484
886779,4,6304469535,"This is a live performance video, filmed for older television screens in 4:3 ratio in 1990. I am reviewing the 2012 release on Arthaus, not the original 1990 release. As in any live performance, there are imperfections of balance and miking, though the sound is generally excellent. Subtitles, which were lacking on the earlier release, are available in German, English, Spanish, French and Italian.

From a musical standpoint this is a very fine performance. Claudio Abbado leads the Vienna State Opera Orchestra (AKA Vienna Philharmonic) in a rich  and exciting reading of Wagner's most lyrical score. Lohengrin was the first of Wagner's operas to be performed in Italy (1870) and was enormously popular from the start. It has a long tradition of performance with Italian singers and conductors, and Abbado obviously feels it in his bones. The orchestra and chorus, among the world's finest, certainly know it well, too, and the brass, so much used in this score's long and elaborate fanfares, are a marvel.

Placido Domingo began singing Lohengrin early in his career (Hamburg, 1968) but left it alone for a long while before returning to Wagner. His ease and fluency with the music is obvious. He has the clarion fortes when need, and can summon the floating lyricism necessary, at times, though he doesn't sustain the floating pianissimi as long as some of his colleagues. He looks a trifle mature for the ideal Lohengrin, but this is hardly a problem. He sounds glorious.

Cheryl Studer, as Elsa, has never been accused of excessive involvement in her roles, but she sings here extraordinarily well. While she lack the vocal plush of Jessye Norman (Domingo's partner in the Decca/Solti recording) or the girlish enthusiasm of Anja Silja or Gundula Janowitz in other notable performances, she has the pipes and phrases beautifully. Her full-figures, placid bearing, however, harkens back to an earlier era of operatic presentation.

Robert Lloyd is outstanding as King Henry the Fowler, the one historic figure in this opera. He is an excellent actor as well, and his phrasing of the king's opening addres and later prayer are exemplary. Georg Tichy fills out the Herald's long pronouncements with appropriately stentorian sounds, but never relaxes into the more intimate moments with the men's chorus in the second act.

Hartmut Welker and Dunja Vejzovic are impressive as the villainous couple, Friedrich von Telramund and Ortrud, with the baritone particularly fine. He actually sings Telramund's notoriousl;y taxing lines, and looks like a modern-day action movie villain. Others have sung Ortrud with more volcanic intensity (Varnay, Ludwig) or more insinuating slyness (Rysanek) but she makes a satisfying combination of both aspects o the role. Vejzovic is firmer of line and fuller in tone than her recordings of Flying Dutchman and Parsifal with Karajan, but her silent-movie era posturing sometimes verges on caricature, but that is not out of keeping with this production.

This production.... Conservative is hardly the word for it. It is almost steadfastly reactionary, as if a production from the 1930s was revived. The costumes are opulent and suggestive of the period. The scenery is attractively unobtrusive at best, with as much open space as possible. The swan is dealt with as a static projection fading into a glittering construction, equally static. None of this should detract from enjoying the performance, but it leaves little to look at during long stretches. There is little in the way of drama. This is old fashioned 'stand and sing' opera, even in the Bridal Chamber Scene, which is done in near total darkness with as little romantic or dramatic tension as possible. I rarely found it necessary to watch the screen...listening was enough.

For fans of Domingo and those thoroughly opposed to any dramatic innovation in opera, this is a fine choice. If you want an equally fine musical performance in better, modern sound, with an interesting updated staging I cannot recommend more highly the Kent Nagano/Bavarian State Opera video with Jonas Kaufmann and Anja Harteros.",1380067200,2,4105,5.180995475113122
886780,5,6304469535,"I am a total fan of Placido Domingo, whom I consider the best, most protean actor/singer of the last 100 years.  Is there anything he cannot sing?  As for Cheryl Studer, I began to collect everything I could find with her after I saw her in performance of a Verdi opera with Domingo himself, and I must confess I like her best in Wagner. A solid, traditional producton that allows the viewer/ listener to concentrate on the musical performance.  ""Lohengrin"", together with ""Parsifal"" are my favorite Wagner operas.  How lucky to have both with my favorite tenor!",1379721600,,562,4.762886597938144
886781,4,6304469535,"It's good to have this 1990 Vienna production back in the catalog. Along with the 1986 Met video, it gives us a choice of two relatively traditional productions rising from the morass of Eurotrash stagings.
The two recordings are rather complementary in strength and weakness. As Elsa and Lohengrin I prefer the Met's Eva Marton and Peter Hofmann to Vienna's Cheryl Studer and Placido Domingo. Studer has the large lyric voice for which the role was designed, and she sings very beautifully. But Marton can effectively scale down her dramatic voice for the intimate passages, and she is the more compelling actress. Domingo sings and acts effectively and seems to understand both the music and the character better than in his earlier audio recording with Solti. But for me the basic sound is simply too Italianate for German opera. Hofmann has the proper sound, and he sings intelligently and expressively.
The two Ortruds are about even. Vienna's Dunja Vejzovic sings powerfully, but her acting is rather stiff. The Met's Leonie Rysanek somewhat chews the scenery, but she creates a vivid character. I only wish she had filmed the role a few years earlier, when her voice was in better shape.
As Telramund, Vienna's Hartmut Welker is a hands-down winner. This high-lying role suits his voice well, and he acts splendidly. The Met's Leif Roar is an excellent actor, but the music is too high for him; he constantly struggles with the tessitura and often resorts to shouting.
Both Kings are excellent, but Macurdy has the rounder, more imposing sound. Vienna's Georg Tichy is a solid, powerful Herald, much to be preferred to the Met's wobbly Anthony Raffell.
The Prelude effectively contrasts the approaches of the two conductors. James Levine takes a very slow tempo and rather wallows in the music's emotionality; Claudio Abbado adopts a more flowing tempo and a more straightforward, well-shaped approach. But both conductors find the elusive singing line in the music and pace the opera very well.
Both stagings are on the abstract side, relying more on suggestion than fussy detail, but both approaches work. The Met's costumes are more specifically medieval, Vienna's more abstract. I wish the Vienna designer were less fond of gray; the music seems more suited to rich, glowing colors. I wasn't convinced by either realization of the Swan, though I guess Vienna's larger-than-life abstract bird is better than the Met's nonexistent one. I think Lohengirn fans will be happy with either of these fine DVDs.",1372723200,,2513,5.072463768115942
886782,5,6304469535,"Placido Domingo is just FANTASTIC!!! All the years I've been watching him he NEVER let me down.

This has a ""front row seat"" feel to it, and doesn't try to be a movie like some opera dvd's. It is cast very well, and all the performers are in top shape. It is presented as the legend and fairy tale it is, with appropriate costumes and sets.  Lohengrin's appearance and departure aren't met with any great special effects, but you get the idea well enough.  The dove at the end is missing, or maybe not caught by the camera.

886787,4,6304469535,"Overall this is a fine production in musical terms, especially Domingo's impressive singing.  Inexplicably, however, the brass and timpani are muted in some climatic crescendi, including the overture, though this seems to be more a fault of engineering balance than Abbado's conducting.  Visually, the production can be summed up as bland and brown. It lacks even shining armor or colorful standards to break the sepia-toned monotony.  The swan, which does appear, is so clunky and monstrous that it makes one appreciate the genius of the single wing gliding across the stage in Robert Wilson's otherwise ludicrous minimalist production at the Met.  In fact, the swan looks as though it had been yanked from Santa's goose-shaped sleigh in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.",1185667200,2,774,5.319672131147541

886839,4,6304469535,"You really can't go wrong with Placido Domingo; he is a Wagnerian master.  However, I was disappointed with the production; it was a bit abstract at points, and most of all the set was primitive.

I have always preferred traditional staging such as what you get at the NY Met.",1116460800,2,276,4.5
886840,3,6304469535,"This live video of Richard Wagner's ""Lohengrin,"" taped in 1990 (although amazon.com lists it as 1994) doesn't do much in the arena of operatic production to promote the cause of what many consider to be Wagner's most Italianate opera. It features many international stars such as Placido Domingo in the title role, Cheryl Studer as Elsa, and Robert Lloyd as King Heinrich, collaborating with Claudio Abbado conducting the Chorus and Orchestra of the Vienna State Opera.

 From a purely musical standpoint, the cast deserves merit. Domingo bravely ventured into the heldentenor repertoire during his mid-to-late career, and shows security and power, along with a fine upper register. His female co-star, Cheryl Studer, sings well as Elsa, not showing too much bravura nor letting herself be drowned out by the powerful orchestra at times. The sinister couple of Hartmut Welker (Frederick) and Dunja Vejzovic (Ortrud) sing their roles well---Welker's baritone is at times off key, but he directs the beginning of the second act and its plethora of upper range notes with ease and confidence. Robert Lloyd as Heinrich and Georg Tichy as the Herald are exceptional in their parts, easily overpowering the gargantuan orchestra called for by Herr Wagner.

 This recording does have its low points, though. Rudolf and Reinhard Heinrich were the set designers and Wolfgang Weber stage director of this very, very drab and dark production. Granted, this is one of Wagner's ""slowest"" works, but I've seen many productions of Lohengrin that can move well and keep the attention of the audience (who, speaking of which, are very polite and quiet over the course of the evening). The opening scene of Act I, which is supposed to be in the forest and very lively, is nothing more than a few steps and a dark, grey backdrop to simulate tension from the impending war. Throughout the rest of the opera, there are very few drastic changes, and one would think that with the excess of funds and space provided with the Vienna State Opera, they could have done a better job. Note that this isn't simply minimalism trying to focus on the music as some productions have done very well (i.e., Verdi's Don Carlos done by Paris Opera with Alagna/Hampson/van Dam), but simply poor staging. Although it is generally traditional staging, one thing that surprised me was the occasional contrast in costume---several times there were more modern dress worn by the singers, which made no sense. The acting is even worse. Ortrud, who should be menacing, shrewd, and generally unpleasant, keeps her eyes glued to the prompter eighty percent of the time, while the other stars (save Lloyd and Domingo) don't do much better.

 Aside from the physicality of the production itself, the music is exemplary---the orchestra play like gods under Signore Abbado, and the cast shines, even if it is only as singers. They deserve credit.

It seesms to me his distinctly non-German voice sets him apart from the rest of the cast and adds to the White Knight ness of his character.

886845,4,6304469535,"There are many strong points to this performance of Lohengrin which was beautifully performed by the Vienna State Opera Orchestra and brilliantly conducted by Claudio Abbado. I was previously unfamiliar with Hartmut Welker who was vocally and dramatically outstanding as Telramund. I will seek out his recordings in the future. Cheryl Studer was in fine voice as Elsa and proved herself as a more than capable Wagnerian lyric soprano. Dunja Vejzovic (a favorite of Karajan) was impressively sinister as Ortrud, but her singing, to my ears, was not on par with her acting. Staging was stark and relatively sparse. It was not very exciting visually.
Then there is Placido Domingo. Although Domingo is not considered by many to be a Heldentenor, he sang Wagner's most Italiante role breathtakingly beautifully. His performance leads me to suspect that the standard categorization of opera singers into narrow boxes of suitable roles is artificial nonsense. Or perhaps it is simply that Domingo can sing any role with unsurpassed elegance. The title role is seldom the highlight of performances of Lohengrin. Domingo's performance is a most noteworthy exception.
Although the totality of the performance is certainly less than ideal, this DVD is highly recommended to admirers of Lohengrin, and especially to admirers of Placido Domingo.
Another reviewer wrote that subtitles are not available options on this DVD. That is not true, but I can understand why that reviewer could not access them. The subtitles cannot be accessed through the main menu. It is necessary to press the ""subtitles"",""titles"" or ""captions"" button on the remote control to cue up the subtitles.

886846,4,6304469535,"This DVD of Lohengrin from Vienna in 1990 gives us a fine rendition of the opera, highlighted by several outstanding performances -- mainly that of the conductor and the tenor. Abbado's Vienna State Opera orchestra plays beautifully for him, showing off the string and brass sound that Solti's Ring made famous so many years ago.  The tradition is still going strong. Though Abbado does not summon the seamless, silky sound of the Berlin Philharmonic under Von Karajan in his EMI recording, and occasionally a chorus voice sticks out, what you are hearing is a live performance and such flaws and lack of balance are to be expected.  Mr. Domingo, on the other hand, gives a fully committed and vocally sumptuous performance in a role we are not used to hearing him sing.  What a treat to hear almost no vocal strain, and no ""Bayreuth Bark""  -- a common pitfall, especially as the opera approaches the end of the evening.  Cheryl Studer sings musically, if rather cooly -- which results in the beautiful ending of her duet with Vejzovic (as Ortrud) going for practically nothing.  Emotionally the two women don't seem to ""go for broke"" as Marton and Rysanek would do.  Vejzovic's best moments are at the end of the opera during her final ravings where many and Ortrud has come to grief.  She is interesting to watch and her eyes in particular are riveting. Robert Lloyd is authoritative if somewhat woolly as King Henry. However, Hartmut Welker sings rather than snarls Telramund, earning him one of the largest ovations of the night.  The sets by Rudolph and Reinhard Heinrich are traditional (for that we should be thankful) but not atmospheric or magical. The procession to the cathedral in Act II  moves in stops and starts and Ortrud's interruption comes almost expectedly and not as a great suprise. Still, I highly recommend this video for your DVD collection.  The MET LOHENGRIN, due for release within the next few months, has more to recommend it with regards  to it's female leads: the previously mentioned Marton and Rysanek.  However, Domingo is far superior to Peter Hofmann and his performance is a musthave for the great beauty of singing he brings to this role.  The opera is spread over two discs: Acts I and II on the first and Act III on the third.  Sound and video quality are superb, with 5.1 Surround or 2-channel stereo as your audio options.
