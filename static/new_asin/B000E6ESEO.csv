2500506,5,B000E6ESEO,"At first glance Planet of the Apes appears to be a silly sci-fi movie populated with men wearing monkey suits, but it is actually a film with such serious themes as animal testing, science versus religion, nuclear war, and man's self destruction nature and to a lesser extent some good old fashions 1960s don't trust anyone over 30 years old paranoia.

Charles Heston portraying Colonel Taylor is fine overacting form and generally dominates the screen while chewing the scenery. The human characters roles are mostly under acted while the ape roles are meaty and more memorable. Roddy McDonnell, playing the chimpanzee Cornelius, did such a memorable job, and I guess enjoyed wearing a monkey suit, that he is the only actor to appear in all four Ape sequels.

The movie is able to compensate for its low budget by shooting a part of the movie in the American southwest. At times the viewer is reminded of the classic John Ford westerns with many long angle shots and the pursuit scenes. It also serves to give the film an almost other worldly appearance. The scenes shot in the ape city are somewhat cheesy and could have used a bit more effort. But what makes the movie are the ape costumes. The costumes were so brilliant that make up designer, John Chambers won an Honorary Academy Award for outstanding make up achievement in a movie.

One of the marvels of the movies is that even though it is a low budget movie it is still incredibly entertaining and thought provoking. A lesson that today's C.G.I. movie makers need to remember is that a movie is not judged not by the quality of it special effects but the content of its story. The producers of the 2001 Planet of the Apes seemed to have lost that notion. The remake was an overblown, dull headed bore; it is everything that the original was not.

This movie is a special meeting of  great source material, Pierre Boulle'sovel, a  Rod Sterling screenplay, a great action star, Charles Heston, imaginative special effects and a director who had more creativity than money. It is no wonder that Planet of the Apes -spawned a movie franchise, a television series, an action figure line, and countless spin offs (books, graphic novel, comic books and even a video game)",1172275200,7,2226,4.724226804123711
2500507,5,B000E6ESEO,This sci-fi movie has something unique- no special effects but it is a classic. A testiment to this are the numerous follow-up movies and the recent remake. If you have not seen it you must even if youare not a sci-fi fun. The story is unique and actually very anti-war and potrays a  (remote) posible future of mankind.  The casting and directing are excellent. See it.,1171584000,4,370,4.590909090909091
2500508,4,B000E6ESEO,"I vividly remember having seen this when it came out.  Heston was phenomenal as an action hero, and a wonderful actor to boot.  While the sequels lost me, this I always thought was a great film.

So I got a copy for my kids.  We viewed it together and greatly enjoyed it.  They were full of questions and observations - always a good sign -  but also enjoyed the action.  My son (7) talked about it for the following week.

As I have not seen it in about 35 years, I was surprized at how much I liked it.  Usually, on viewing a sci-fi oldie I enjoyed at 6 or 12, I am disappointed at how flimsy it seems in terms of plot and realism.  Happily, this is hard sci-fi in that it is at least not impossible, and there are interesting characters:  Taylor the cynic, Dr Zeias the guardian of orthodoxy, and the scientist/intellectual chimps as well as Cornelius, the rebellious young one.  The story hangs together well and has a startlingly fresh conclusion that is not happy.

Warmly recommended for all ages.",1169078400,6,1004,4.391304347826087
2500509,5,B000E6ESEO,Short and sweet? This movie is fantastic. Much better than the remake starring Mark Walburg (liked him better in Four Brothers). This one is a classic and spawned a franchise. The others in the series weren't as good but are watchable. Nuff said...,1168819200,3,248,4.790697674418604
2500510,4,B000E6ESEO,"In a magnificent performance, Heston plays what he considers an ""existential"" character... He is a cynic who hates mankind enough to make him leave the Earth in search of ""something better than man.""

Heston tries to make sense of this ""upside-down"" world, and in the process, Pierre Boulle raises such issues as balance of power, racism, the role of government, and evolution... The apes are seen with cameras and guns, but strangely, the sight of a paper airplane shocks them...

Schaffner's ability to focus on the human element in the face of awesome spectacle is one of his greatest assets... He uses dizzying camera effects, very enthusiastic zooming and hand-held cameras at ground level during chases...

""Planet of the Apes"" is a magnificent visual experience, from the emerald lake at the beginning to the threatening sea-shore at the end... The desolate landscapes of the Utah and Arizona National Parks, represented into primeval ruins, make an appropriately setting for the first appearance of the talking apes, rounding up humans like animals... The apes themselves remain an astonishing achievement of make-up and performance... John Chambers receives an Academy Award for his art...

The motion picture features one of Heston's strongest, most emotional performances... Heston escapes, fights and yells... He is violently treated, caged, dragged, and hosed with powerful jets of water... He runs barefoot through hills, mountains, plains and an ape city... He is raided by gorillas on foot and on horseback, humiliated by thoughtful chimpanzees and mad ape scientists, pelted by inhabitants of the Planet of the Apes...

The terrific supporting cast is wholly convincing: Maurice Evans in the role of Zaius, the scientist who does not want his race to suffer the fate of the humans; the two friendly chimpanzees named Zira and Cornelius (Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowall) are superb...

""Planet of the Apes"" also gives us something else:

-Heston and his crewmen have landed on an unknown planet... They hear sounds of galloping horses and guns being fired... But what they see is incredible... Apes on horseback!

- ""Bright Eyes"" does surprise the apes who believe humans aren't capable... With those enraged words (""Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty apes!""), he shakes the entire foundation of ape society and causes the Semians to retreat in shock...

- The crucial scene where Taylor has been given a hearing: As he tries to explain to his captors that he's come from another planet in a spaceship, the scene cuts to the monkey tribunal - sitting in the classic ""hear-no-evil, speak-no-evil, see-no-evil - pose...

- When a shaved Taylor kisses Zira in front of Cornelius who is suffering without complaining... An indecisive Zira expresses: ""Allright. But you're so damned ugly!""

- The ultimate scene: Having finally escaped from his captors with his mate Nova (Linda Harrison), Heston rides along the beach on horseback to the Forbidden Zone, once a paradise... Suddenly he spots something unusual in the distance... He remembers what Zaius told him, ""You may not like what you find!"" What he can see was not a rock but salt-stained metal... As he draws closer, the camera slowly draws back and up to reveal what must come as a terrible shock...

Backed by a magnificent and unusual Jerry Goldsmith musical score, ""Planet of the Apes"" is a stylish and thoughtful science fiction film, which starts and finishes splendidly... It is a superb exercise in fantasy, a fine suspense adventure, an exciting and provocative entertainment...",1168387200,7,3565,5.15944540727903
2500511,5,B000E6ESEO,"The characters never say more than is necessary.  This movie has great scenery, great action, and it gives us something to think about.  What more do you want?",1168300800,4,159,4.642857142857143
2500512,5,B000E6ESEO,"It's funny how time can warp memory, permitting the plot of a brilliant film to mold the thoughts of a 12 year old boy in 1969, slack-jawed as he witnesses apes transform to saddled up gunslingers, who speak English as it was spoken in the 1870's, who confront a truth seeking, shoot-from-the-hip astronaut who finds that the local smartees are merely following the path of their leaders into a delusional Salem, where men are the witches and apes are the authors of their own enlightenment. It had become a film locked into the eyes of this 12 year old, and the 49-year-old buys a DVD to view the film once again, gleaning a new perspective the 12 year old could never have.

Charlton Heston's Taylor is stranded on a planet in the very late 40th Century where the ape is king of the jungle and smokes Cohibas. His adventure turns ugly as he and his crew discover a planet of apes hording humans into nets so they don't eat their guavas, performing medical experiments as we might with mice, or in the context of a time not too far past, as Nazis did with Jews. He finds comfort in the company of a heretical pair of apes with doctorates played by Kim Hunter and Roddy McDowell and they aid Taylor in finding the ultimate truth about his past, and theirs.

The recent viewing enhances the old memory and rejiggers the brain cells into recognizing parallels of truth that escape sci-fi loving pre-teens looking for an escapist adventure. We all dodged a bullet back in 1962 during the Cuban missile crisis and came an ape's breath away from plating the planet, and the film's fables line up for attention reaching a climax when the planet does a ""To Tell the Truth"" with Taylor who pounds the sandy beach, cursing man, not ape.

Get your stinking paws on this DVD.",1168214400,5,1764,4.540880503144654
2500513,5,B000E6ESEO,"This is one of Charlton Heston's last great performances. The film, though filled with action, also has an intelligence to it, and a slow, methodical style that is characteristic of the good science fiction movies of the era that ended with Star Trek II. Space explorers crash-land on an unknown planet, struggle to find food and water, and then encounter a band of mute humans, and then the dominant species on the planet: apes. It was a mirror to race relations in the 1960s, and also a reflection of the clash between scientific and religious thought on the origin of our species, and finally also a speculative tale of man's own fate, should mankind not master the worst parts of its nature.",1161302400,5,695,4.704918032786885
2500514,5,B000E6ESEO,"This is a great movie for most all ages.  I saw this many years ago and was really amazed by the whole idea.

As for the DVD itself....it is a very basic one.  Even though it says it has commentary, it is really not much of anything.  The text commentary is not much at all either.  Nothing like todays DVD's and commentaries you might find on a Star Wars DVD.

2500589,5,B000E6ESEO,"This is a review for the Original 1968 movie starring Charlton Heston. I loved it and still do even today among all the remakes and reboots going on.
It seems Hollyweird is running out of ideas and trying to go back and keep remaking older movies to fit their agenda and end up making a mess out of it all. Take the recent remake of ""The Beguiled"". Stupid. :Let's not even get into the first remake of Planet of the Apes. Total waste of time on that one. The ending was ludicrous beyond belief.
Fortunately, lovers of original idea movies, like this one from '68, have the option to get the HD version. I have to tell you that it looks fantastic in HD!
If you have the proper equipment to play this on, it should give you the best picture it can. I have UHD 4K equipment, so it looks great.
The ending of this one is spot on!

Great classic with a stunning ending. When I unwrapped the package with the BluRay disc, I was sceptical that it would be of really good quality as the film was made so many years ago.

This nostalgic sci-fi hit hasn't lost its luster over the years, as it still manages to entertain. The premise of the film is a warning of what can happen to our civilization if we let politics and power get in the way of the human spirit. Certain scenes and settings (breathtaking scenery of mountains and the ocean) of this film remind me of Lawrence of Arabia (1962) while others (such as the apes holding court) remind me of Star Trek VI The Undiscovered Country (1991). Charlton Heston (while not my favorite actor) does a good job in his role, while Kim Hunter is adorable in her role. Overall, this is a classic sci-fi film that stands the test of time.

2500701,5,B000E6ESEO,"The 1968 version of the science-fiction classic ""Planet Of The Apes"" is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, sci-fi movie of all times. It certainly is my all time favorite sci-fi film. Based on the novel by Pierre Boulle it is a story of a world turned upside down. It starts out with four astronauts who are returning to Earth who along the way crash lands on a desolate planet. Three of the astronauts survive the crash. One of those astronauts is played by legendary actor Charlton Heston in one of his memorable roles. It ranks up there with his work in films like ""Ben-Hur"" and ""The 10 Commandments"". In this case he and the other two survivors are trying to figure out where they are but even more importantly how they will survive on a planet that starts out looking like it is a desolate world. But they will eventually discover that this world is indeed inhabited but not the way they would expect.

In this world the human live like animals while it is apes who are the rulers. The humans spend their days foraging for food while always on the look out for apes on horseback who view humans as a scourge that need to be eliminated. And Taylor (Heston) and his two companions are now caught up in this world. I don't want to say too much more about what takes place in the movie. For those who have seen it already are well aware what happens. For those however who may not have seen ""Planet Of The Apes"" yet then I don't want to say much more to ruin the experience of seeing this picture, especially when it comes to the ending which just may very well be the greatest surprise ending of all time in cinema history.

Released in 1968 this movie came out at a time with a lot of issues going on both in the U.S. and the world. Political assassinations, the Vietnam war, Civil rights and the cold war with the constant threat of world annihilation with the build up of nuclear weapons among nations. The storyline in ""Planet"" took on some of these issues in subtle ways and how humans were responsible for the world being in the shape it was. There is talk during the movie how the humans were at one time in control of the planet. Their desire for power and supremacy however would destroy the planet that would in turn allow the apes to evolve and take over as the rulers of the world. A strong statement on human condition is made in this film with a message behind it. That is what makes ""Planet"" such an excellent movie. It entertains while challenging the viewer to think about the situation going on with that planet and the possibilities of it occurring here on Earth.

The message that the screenwriter was trying to make here may sound as if the movie is too heavy or serious a subject matter to hold the interest of the viewer. That however is not the case. The story moves along I think at a good pace and does have its moments of humor and even a little bit romantic interest to keep the movie from getting to mired down in the plot. Credit that to the first screenwriter who was hired to write the script, Rod Serling. Yes that Serling of ""Twilight Zone"" fame. His original draft would be used in much of the story though the producers did bring in another writer, Michael Wilson, to make some changes to the story because they thought Serling's version was too long and I guess a little too technical to possibly hold the viewers attention. One thing I did recently learned was that the one area of Serling's screenplay that was not altered or changed by the producers or Michael Wilson was that famous ending to ""Apes"". I guess they figured the ending Rod came up with couldn't be topped. And they were right. Ask any movie critic to list their top ten biggest movie endings of all time and I guarantee you ""Planet Of The Apes"" will be somewhere in the top five of the majority of those critics.

What is left to say about this movie. It is outstanding and thought provoking while still being entertaining and captivating of the viewer. This is one of those movies that should be required to be in anyone's video collection. If you haven't seen this movie before then you got to watch it. At least once. But I am sure this is a film once you see it will want to se again and again.",1437955200,,4212,4.375478927203065

In Planet of the Apes, three astronauts crash-land to discover a civilization turned upside-down  a nightmare world dominated by intelligent simians. Humanity is hunted and caged. Can Colonel George Taylor (Charlton Heston) escape?

The music, by composer Jerry Goldsmith, really taps into something primal and like every great film score, compliments the film throughout. Goldsmith wisely knew when to hold back and when to let the music help tell the story. The score plays alongside the film, rather than going over the top of it like a hammer. Directed by one of my favorite film directors Franklin J. Schaffner, whose other credits include the acclaimed Patton (1970), Papillon (1973), and The Boys from Brazil (1978). All scored by Goldsmith. 1968 was a banner year for both science fiction and horror. Films like Planet of the Apes, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Rosemary's Baby, and Night of the Living Dead reinvigorated the genres and paved the way for what was to come in the 1970s.

The Blu-ray is jam-packed with tons of bonus features, some of which is recycled from past DVD releases. The best is the feature-length documentary Behind the Planet of the Apes, hosted by Roddy McDowall. A+",1426636800,2,1329,5.031818181818182

Remakes seldom are better(exceptions: Ben Hur and Heaven Can Wait) and THIS Planet of the Apes(the original with Charlton Heston) is the real thing.
Plot: a starship is sent from our solar system in search of another inhabitable planet around another star(as they got lost, where is not firmly known.)  The ship has systems failures over the long period of travel and crew were lost.  The survivors of the crashed ship strike out in search of a way to survive.  Then they find out that the planet is already populated, with people as animals and animals(apes) as 'people'.  Eventually only Taylor(Charlton Heston) remains alive of the astronauts and he leads an expedition into some 'badlands' in search of the history of their (apes') planet.

2500865,1,B000E6ESEO,"This film is male content (SOFT-CORE PORN). The MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) miscategorized making an G-rated error in overlooking and allowing the blooper scene in their rating system of this film where Charlton Heston's character ""Taylor"" was standing before the Tribunal of Orangutans (ape court authorities) for determining indictment, when the guerrilla security guard completely stripped him of his rags / clothing!

I've seen this first 1968 released film version uncensored, indiscreetly aired on HBO Kids Channel because, it even still has an inappropriate G (General Audience) rating! It should've been classified as Rated-R for Restricted, specifically indicating a decomposed woman's corpse, slaughtered humans that have undergone taxidermy to be museum exhibits, (sexual content / conversation about a woman astronaut's all male astronaut harem) and explicit male nudity.

The first film was fair in writing and special effects but, wasn't suited for children or straight, male adult sci-fi fans. It would have great potential, if it were only censored by editing to be wholesome entertainment!

The director Tim Burton of the 2001 remake ""The Planet of the Apes"" apparently thought nudity was also, inappropriate. I didn't like that version as well as the original but, still think the original absolutely needs to be censored over the male nudity for children and straight, male adult sci-fi fans to enjoy.

Those alleged straight males that give me a thumbs down for this review must like Hollywood film studios psychologically raping them! You people would foolishly take that, for a fair script with outdated ape facial make-up, wardrobe costumes, props, special effects / flash)!!!

2500902,3,B000E6ESEO,"Here's my summary of why I give 3 stars and not 5. Yes, it has spoilers.

The camerawork is so boring, barely moving at all during action. We know this is not insurmountable because during other, mundane moments like walking down the path, the camera does slide along following them and cutting back and forth between speaking characters. So this mostly-frozen camera during fight scenes can only be attributed to laziness or lack of vision.

BTW compare this to ""Back to the Future"" about 20 years later. All 3 of them have fairly lazy camera work too, but you hafta really pay attention to see that, because the ***music*** really helped make that movie. You remember the music in Back to the Future, right? Which leads me to my next point...

The music---no, the soundtrack---sounds like one of those bad scores they add to silent films. It's just bad and boring, not memorable at all. Also, about half of this movie has no background music whatsoever... Music can make or break the film.

Charlie Heston, playing Taylor, did not do great acting. It's very stiff, and this is either his fault or the director's or writer's or whoever it was who told him to be a cowboy. We never once see his eyes actually thinking. He's supposed to be a scientist and astronaut, but instead of trying to think his way out of peril or reason with the 2 ape scientists, he's just reacting brainlessly to almost everything. There might be some times he should react, I mean I'll grant he's witnessing brutal enslavement of humans by apes, but really he's supposed to be a more capable and balanced leader.

When you're trapped in a cage with no way out and about to be lobotomized, do you lose your cool and lash out? or do you try to think of what to say so they'll spare you? which btw he's supposed to be the unique specimen cuz of his brains... maybe not as much brains as they think.

Even after he's rescued, still he displays a lot of hostility to them, which is pretty dumb once they've just rescued you and brought you to relative safety. As an astronaut and scientist you're supposed to keep your cool under pressure and keep your eye on the goal of safety/rescue. BTW, very early on in the movie, Taylor is introduced as a hard-ass/dumb-ass by being a moron to his crewmates...his crewmates, his fellow astronaut buddies in the same predicament as him, and one of whom has just died on the ship...and they barely make it off the sinking ship...so he's being a jerk to them? This sci-fi movie is supposed to be cerebral, I mean just look at the ending, so I can't help not ""think about it"" when it comes to this incongruency.

Other than that, the movie does good with the story and maybe it's even pioneering. The ape-suits alone were pioneering, and I have a feeling that in 1968, seeing that ""interracial"" kiss caused a bit of a stir, so I think it was pioneering in the bold sense as well. I don't have any problems with the ape acting or their British voices, which I think suits them well and I didn't even notice it at first. I don't have any problems with the science fiction plot or the issues of religion vs science or possible paths or evolution. None of those issues are explored very deeply, but I don't have a problem with that either. The simplex approach can work very well. After all, the real challenge of sci-fi is to wrap the setting/plot around the character's struggle, which is supposed to be the heart of the story---involving yourself in the main guy's plight---otherwise it's more technobabble than soul. So I actually applaud the simplex approach.

But this movie really missed its chance to be a true masterpiece. And neither is it visionary. Trust me when I say it doesn't require a visionary to take a book and make it into a movie. It only takes motivation from your wallet. Hence the laziness in camerawork and soundtrack. Well, okay it was made in 1968. So you can either blame the year 1968 or the creators. I'm leaning towards the latter. I can begrudingly forgive the poor camerawork and music, but you really need a decent and fitting character in the lead role in order to make a great film.

I haven't read the book. At the very least, this movie inspires me, in one way and another, to read it.",1408492800,,4228,4.5307994757536045

2500947,5,B000E6ESEO,"In 1968, I was 13. My parents took us out to a drive in and Planet Of The Apes was showing. When the apes appeared on the screen, I hid behind the seat! Since then, I've seen the movie loads of times and now it's usually played in my household every couple weeks! I've gotten my kids scared of it like I was LOL!!!

Planet Of The Apes is about astronaut Taylor and his 2 comrades, who travel from the year 1973 into the 3900s. By this point, apes have taken over the world and have the ability to speak, and perform daily activities while humans take the role of animals and can't speak. Apes hunt humans for sport, do scientific research on them, and keep them locked up in cages. During a hunt, Taylor is shot in the neck, temporarily disabling him to talk. When an ape named Zira takes a liking to him and gives him the nickname Bright Eyes, he attempts to escape. Once recaptured he says one of the famous movie lines of all time... ""TAKE YOUR STINKIN' PAWS OFF ME YOU D$#@ DIRTY APE!!"". Zira is amazed that a human can speak and he's put on trial by the other apes.

The screenplay was written by Rod Serling, of Twilight Zone and Night Gallery fame. It's also based on a novel by French author Pierre Boulle. However, this 1968 movie adaption is probably the best known work under the POTA name. It's certainly the best!

Since this movie, 4 sequels, 2 short-lived TV shows, 1 remake and a ""reboot"" have followed. If by some unfortunate chance you've never seen this movie, what are you waiting for?! I'd also advise you to watch the 4 sequels, as they help develop a better understanding of this movie and the overall story.",1392249600,,1631,4.358552631578948
2500948,5,B000E6ESEO,This is a classic movie. I enjoy it every time I watch it. Charlton Heston is the best an remakes can't compare to this one.,1389139200,,124,4.0
2500949,4,B000E6ESEO,"What can I say about Planet of The Apes?  It is a Sci-Fi classic, up there with other classics such as Star Wars, 2001 A Space Odyssey, Alien, etc.  It is hard to review a classic movie.  The film is very well made, the acting is great, and the idea of the movie was revolutionary at the time.  However, watching this film for the first time after seeing many movies and TV series use the same premise, it kind of ruined the experience a bit.  I feel slightly underwhelmed, because I know basically what will happen.

The movie Stars Charlton Heston as a man named Taylor.  Taylor and his crew crash land on Earth after 18 months in their time in space on an important mission.  However, on Earth more than 2000 years have passed.  It seems like there is no life to be found.  However, they soon come across very primitive humans and are attacked by highly intelligent apes with guns.  Taylor is captured and soon realizes that apes now rule the Earth and that humans are now on the bottom of the food chain.

The effects are for the time and still hold up fairly well.  The look of the world is masterfully done.  The premise is interesting and the reveal at the end is a good twist.  Plus, it did give birth to some memorable lines like: Take your filthy hands off me you damn dirty ape!  Charlton Heston brings his A-game to this.  I think he has one of the best voices I have heard.  When he speaks you will listen.  I also like his character in this as well.  He went on the mission to space to get away from humanity.  He does not care for them and says they are animals at heart and very violent, which is very similar to the apes view on humans which creates an interesting parallel.  You find out that that viewpoint is not completely unfounded at the end.

However, I did not enjoy this film as much as I thought I would and I think I know why.  I think if I saw this back when it first came out I would have liked it much more.  I did not see this film when I grew up and have only watched it recently.  Up till now I have seen many movies and TV series mimic or satirize the premise of this film where humans are now viewed as animals by a higher life form be it aliens or an evolved form of an existing animal.  I have seen it so much that I find it stale now.  All the memorable lines in this film I have heard used in so many other films now.  The ending did not surprise me because I have been spoiled by people who have seen the film or other movies satirizing it.  The problem is that I have been spoiled to it so I do not find it as fun as I might have if had seen it when it came out or when I was little.

Overall, Planet of The Apes is a very well-made science fiction movie with good effects, great acting, decent characters, and a good twist at the end.  Since it has been talked up so much I did not get sucked in as much, but that does not mean that you wont.  I definitely say this should be scene once at least.",1387756800,,2939,4.064459930313589

2501023,5,B000E6ESEO,"It's hard to see this movie as if I did not know the ending. Why, we ask ourselves, did the audience guess the truth so far ahead of Taylor? I think he was clinging to an unrealistic hypothesis (never stated, except that he was convinced he was far from home) in much the same way the Defender of the Faith was doing. He knew better, but he did not want to look at all the implications.

Just in case there's anyone left who has not seen this movie before, I shall provide a brief synopsis. Taylor (Charlton Heston) was the commander of a space ship traveling near the speed of light. The rest of the crew was in suspended animation, and after he records the introduction, he goes into stasis as well. They are woken abruptly when the ship crash-lands into a large lake. The only female in the crew was killed by a malfunction of the life support long enough before the landing that her body is a dessicated mummy when the others -- three males -- wake up to get themselves out of the ship just before it sinks. They manage to save some essential equipment and a few days' worth of food and water.

OK, I'll stop with the details. At first they think the planet on which they have landed is dead entirely, then find plant life, and finally something like scarecrows (decoys?) up on a ridge just before they (1) discover the wild humans who do not speak, and (2) are captured by the civilized apes who do. Speak, I mean. English, oddly enough. In fact, one of the funniest things about the movie is the constant use of aphorisms which have been converted from human references to ape references. At a funeral, the priest refers to the deceased saying that he ""never met an ape he didn't like.""

Anyway, gentle Zira (Kim Hunter) is an animal psychologist, and she takes an interest in this odd human who acts like he understands speech, although he cannot speak because of a bullet wound to his throat. Eventually, he proves he can write, and finally when his throat is sufficiently healed, that he can speak.

Meanwhile Zira and her fiance Cornelius (Roddy McDowell) are in a great deal of trouble for heresy, as the religion of the apes declares that apes were made in God's image, and that God told them to subdue the humans and not let them breed too much. In one funny scene, a court with three judges is reacting to Zira's arguments by one having his hands over his ears, one over his eyes, and the third one over his mouth. My daddy had a little paperweight with three monkeys making the same gesture: hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil.

Cornelius is an archaeologist, and he has a (much discredited) theory that apes evolved from humans. And he had been conducting a dig in a cave in the Forbidden Lands that seemed to support his theory. When he and Zira are accused of heresy, they take Taylor (and his female, Nova) with them to the dig site, attempting to prove that they are right and therefore it cannot be heresy, since it's true.

Now here's where Taylor must have known what was happening. In the cave are unmistakably human artifacts -- I mean Earth humans. In fact, the most convincing find of all is a recognizable ""mama doll"" that somehow, after having been buried for a couple thousand years, unaccountably retains its voice box. Why, Taylor shout rhetorically, would apes create a human doll that talks?

I had forgotten how much I enjoyed this film back when it was new, and could enjoy almost as much now even though I knew the final scene. I'm giving it five stars mostly because I've ordered the entire series from Netflix, and I remember that some of the later ones (there were five or six films total) were not as good. This was quite a break-through in its time on a variety of levels, and I recommend it to young people who were not even born when it was made as a significant piece of film history -- as well as a cracking good adventure story.",1337126400,2,3881,4.434782608695652

You nearly see way to much of Charlton Heston from the front while he is running through some bushes. The language is also an issue. This movie should not be rated G. This is misleading to people who may let young children watch it because of the rating. The movie gets three stars from me, but the misleading rating drops it to two stars.

In the first one Dr. Zaius comes off as being way worse than he does in the other ones except for one scene in the second film where i truly couldn't stand him.

2501080,4,B000E6ESEO,"I watched this movie again last night for the first time in about 25 years and was reminded of how important it is to have a good storyline. I'll forgive a film a lot of faults as long as it whisks me up and carries me away in its imagination and refuses to take easy short cuts. The start of Planet of the Apes is in fact one of the weakest moments -- Charlton Heston, as the commander of a space capsule sent far off into the future, muses about how wretched and violent humanity is. Oh no, you think, we're in for a heavy-handed critique of the Vietnam War and the turmoil in U.S. society (this was made in 1968).

But no. The producers have a more subtle approach and quickly tone down the most blatant parallels with (what were then) current events. Heston and his two colleagues land in a desolate part of an unknown planet and eventually find themselves in a cornfield, where a gang of mute humans stealing the food is quickly rounded up by gunwielding gorillas on horseback. The rest of the story is too well-known for me to summarise here, yet what struck me was how clever the dialogue and how well-crafted the dilemma for the governing ape council. Heston's existence proves their fundamental beliefs are wrong, so what do they do with him? The apes hate humans and (rightly) fear they will bring nothing but ruin.

A friendly pair of chimpanzee scientists helps Heston escape and after a climactic run-in with the chief ape, he rides off into the surf, and then ... then comes an ending so powerful that it still made my spine tingle. Overall, this film has survived the last 40 years or so in excellent shape.

The added bonus of this DVD set is an intriguing two-hour documentary about the origin of the films -- how tough it was to find the funding for the first one and the tremendous challenges posed by the make-up, not to mention the tight budget. Once the first movie proved so successful the studio demanded a sequel, but flops elsewhere meant the budget was cut, as it was to be with each of the four subsequent films. The documentary goes through each of the quartet and explains what made them successful and which parts didn't work. The producers and directors talk honestly about the challenges and what they were trying to say about an increasingly troubled society without being so blatant as to turn away audiences.

Overall, these two DVDs are very good value. Recommended.",1312761600,,2403,4.555555555555555

2501082,4,B000E6ESEO,"I tried reading the original French novel many years ago for ""Planet of the Apes"", but had a lot of other stuff going on, and I simply couldn't get through it.  But, like most other people of my generation, I did see the movie, and what a movie it is.

What we have here is simply basic film making.  What few SFX there are are fairly basic.  The film isn't about wowing the audience with huge special effects shots nor giant action sequences.  The story is about mankind adapting to a world turned on its head.  Where the beasts of burden have become the masters.  Where the lower classes have become the social elite, and the upper strata of society are now in the role of the down trodden masses.  In this vein it's actually a bit of a social commentary for the time, and not a very flattering one.

Heston and company do a superb job of bringing these characters to life, and showing us the defiant will of man fighting what might be regarded as an age old rivalry.  To add to the acting are of course the prosthesis makeup of the actors playing the apes (notably Roddy McDowell).  The makeup itself gives us the physical form of the intelligent ape, but it's the acting, the gestures that help seal the sale to the audience.

One important thing to note is the style change from this kind of science fiction to today's big budgeted B-movies that offer more flash than bang.  ""Planet of the Apes"" deals with the proposition of how the high and mighty experts and learned types would like to be the subjects of their own tests.  How would they like to wear the shackles, perform the tricks, eat when they're told to, sit, heel, beg, roll over and what not.  A far cry from the giant CGI emphasis on films today, which are really aimed at pre-teens and high schoolers.  Not that ""Planet of the Apes"" didn't have a different marketing scheme in mind, but the style I think tells of a more mature film making style than today's quick slang and encapsulated dialog with huge amounts of visuals.

Also not another style choice; horses and guns.  Certainly a bit of an homage to the western that was just beginning to fade at the time of this film's release.  We see a sci-fi film, but it's adorned with some familiar trappings so that we don't completely lose touch with the fantasy being presented.

A good film from an author who was concerned about different social classes taking over his country.  In light of today's events, he may have had a legitimate concern, but his lens was focused on the wrong group.

In any event, check it out and enjoy the tale.",1301616000,,2559,4.446351931330472
2501083,4,B000E6ESEO,"There weren't many memorable science fiction films in the 1960s, but the few that met with success found it unusually enduring. ""Planet of the Apes"" didn't achieve the canonical status of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", released the same year. But it spawned a 5-film franchise, inspired a reconceived version in 2001, and it still makes an impression. Rod Serling, of ""Twilight Zone"" fame, and Michael Wilson wrote the screenplay based on Pierre Boulle's 1963 French novel at producer Arthur P. Jacobs' behest. Beyond its surprise ending, cult appeal, and socio-political undertones, the film's makeup and score are notable. This was the second of seven films on which the late composer Jerry Goldsmith worked with director Franklin Schaffner. And John Chambers ground-breaking prosthetic makeup won an Honorary Oscar for Outstanding Makeup Achievement.

George Taylor (Charlton Heston) is the leader of a 6-month deep space mission that left Earth in 1972. The four-person crew expects to return to Earth some 700 years after they left, owing to the speed at which their craft was traveling. They place themselves into a state of stasis for the journey home not knowing what they will find when they awake. The ship unexpectedly lands in water. The crew has to bail out, and they find themselves in a landscape devoid of vegetation. The ship's clock said 3978, implying that 2000 years have passed, and they suspect they've missed Earth by 300,000 light years. But a primitive human-like species inhabits this planet, along with a society of ape-like creatures who possess something akin to 19th-century technology. But the Apes are not friendly towards humans, and Taylor is taken captive.

Viewed more than 40 years after it was made, ""Planet of the Apes"" didn't seem nearly as campy or dated as I expected. Even the ape makeup is not too bad. I wonder if Taylor's disposition might partly account for it. His misanthropy and arrogance age better than earnestness or patience would have. The film's stance against animal experimentation, its criticism of the assumption that a species is unintelligent and unworthy if it can't speak, its Darwinism, its ruminations on the human capacity for self-destruction, particularly through nuclear war, address hot-button issues of the 1960s. It's not subtle. More subtle, though, is the reflection on the role of religion and of community leaders in shaping our views of the past: History as a socio-political tool. The horrific consequences of lying with good intentions. It's a neglected and provocative topic, even now.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006): There are two ""audio commentaries"" that seem to be interviews recorded at different times, pieced together, and played over the film. The first is a commentary by composer Jerry Goldsmith. The second is by actors Roddy McDowall, Natalie Trundy, Kim Hunter, and makeup artist John Chambers. These ""commentaries"" are sparse and would have been better simply as interviews or run over short excerpts of the film, so the viewer could locate them easily. There is also a ""Text Commentary"" by Eric Greene, author of ""Planet of the Apes as American Myth"". This runs in the lower frame, like subtitles. This also would have been better if we could just read the essay, instead of reading a few words at a time. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH and Spanish. Dubbing available in Spanish and French.",1285459200,7,3403,5.1059245960502695
2501084,5,B000E6ESEO,"The movie is as much alive today as it was in 1968 when I first saw it as a high school junior.  The director made one feel a part of the upside down movie and the ape costumes and make-up were so realistic and innovative, that each were a piece of art.  The actors Heston, McDowell and Evans gave brilliant portrayals of their characters and gave a message to my generation: ""This could really happen if we do not change.""",1284249600,,423,4.275
2501085,5,B000E6ESEO,"That's the first of a long series of films. At first you think you are in some kind of Star Trek series with a little bit less gadgetry, or maybe a new Space Odyssey. Then you think you have been thrown into a remake of George Pal's Time Machine, adapted from H.G. Wells. But you realize very fast it is quite another story. Instead of implementing Darwinism within a Marxist vision of industrial society, here the very Darwinian evolution that man produced man as superior to apes, we have exactly the world upside down and apes are superior to man.

It is an inverted story of human fundamentalist Christianity or any fundamentalist religious belief in the hands and heads of an ape rather medieval society. Some humans arrive in a very long distance NASA flight and they are at first confronted to a wild human species and then hunted down by an ape superior species. That's the beginning. Of course the parallel with H.G. Wells stops here and we shift to another story.

The aim is to reveal the absurdity of a fundamentalist belief that one species was created by God to dominate the world and another to be the Devil's spies and pawns. It is not racism since the apes and the humans are not members of the same species. It is what we humans practice everyday on earth, the absolute domination of all that nature contains. What is surprising is that these apes hunt humans, capture them, kill them but do not eat them. In H.G. Wells the Morlocks hunted the Elois in order to eat them as meat, proteins.

The next surprising thing is that this dependence, inferiority has erased the capacity to speak in the humans whereas their superiority has granted the apes the power to speak and write. That is surprising since humans do have the physical ability but they lost the know-how. The film is surprising in its ending because it is the triumph of force over reason. The last surviving Earth man and his human female wild acolyte escape enslavement by using force, and the chief scientist and chief religious authority escape truth by using force.

The end is all the more surprising when the Statue of Liberty jumps up out of nowhere on this extremely distant planet. Fascinating anachronism. I think they call that, in the intellectual critical milieu, a ""mise en abime"". Of course we know it is the door to the sequel, but even so it is slightly moving to see her in there. Quite out of her normal environment. Maybe some myth is attached to this lady, so strong that on September 11 they attacked the Twin Towers instead of the Statue of Liberty. Surprising indeed what force a mythical being can take in human minds.

I am a composer, and still remember how as a young man this score was a revelation to me. Jerry Goldsmith proved that you could write a score to a film that was entirely ""correct"", from beginning to end, and still have a ""sound"" that identified you. He became at that point, and remains to this day, my favorite film composer. While the largely atonal music to this film may sound today a little dated and ""effecty"" (it was 1968, after all) it was spot on right for the character of this movie.

The number of films he composed music for is itself breathtaking (look him up on Wikipedia), and he is probably known to most these days for his Star Trek scores, which frankly to my view were not his best -- he went in the direction of the neo-Romantics like John Williams, who redefined what science fiction scores had to sound like -- Strauss, Wagner, etc. (You can also usually identify a John Williams score, mostly because it sounds like all the big Romantic composers without actually being any of them.)

But the vast majority of the films he scored were not science fiction or fantasy: A Patch of Blue (1965), The Boys from Brazil (1978), Basic Instinct (1992), and many others.",1270080000,2,1445,4.486692015209125

A groundbreaking film (it won an Oscar for best makeup before there was even such a category), I can only imagine the audience's reaction in theaters at the film's final reveal!

Just one question: How in the name of all that is good was this film rated G? I know the ratings system has changed over the years, but even the classic line, ""Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!"" should have bumped it up to PG, no?

Charlton Heston was at his best in the ""last man"" role, and is perfect here. (creepy laugh and all) And was there a more beautiful woman in 1968 than Linda Harrison (Nova)? She had been a beauty pageant winner and runner-up in the 1965 Miss USA. She must not have spoken well or else surely she would have found more work in Hollywood.

2501116,4,B000E6ESEO,"It was directed by Franklin Schaffner, who went on to success with the Oscar-winning biopic Patton. It is the tale of a misanthropic astronaut, and his three comrades, sent on the first interstellar flight, somewhere towards Alpha Centauri. The tale follows Heston's character, Colonel George Taylor, and his two surviving male underlings, Dodge and Landon, after they crash land on a seemingly deserted Earth-like world. The female member of the crew, Stewart, has died due to an air leak in her hibernation capsule.
  While they think they are in a different solar system, and have traveled over two thousand years into the future, it not too slowly becomes apparent that they are back on Earth. The willful suspension of disbelief is needed, of course, because the chances that astronauts could not tell that they were under our sun, moon, and constellations- even a few millennia hence, is unlikely. Then there is the terrestrial flora, then the encounter with mute humans (how unlikely is that?), and then being captured by English speaking gorillas on a hunt. I mean- they speak English, and American astronauts cannot piece things together? Yet, if one can give in to that initial act, all the rest of the film- and subsequent series, unfolds with quite a bit of logic, although at times seeming at odds.
  Dodge ends up killed and stuffed in an ape museum while Landon is lobotomized so he cannot speak. Taylor cannot speak, initially, because he has been shot in the throat by a gorilla. He is mended by two chimpanzee scientists, Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowell), an archaeologist, who believe he is `bright.' She calls him Bright Eyes. They are under the tutelage of Dr. Zaius, an orangutan bureaucrat who knows the secret that his world is earth, and that taking humans once ruled it.
  Eventually, Taylor regains his voice, after being put on by trial with Zira and Cornelius, who are charged with heresy, and one of the film's many signature moments comes when Taylor is netted and captured after escaping, and rails to the apes who catch him, `Get your stinkin' paws off me you damn dirty ape!' Yet, by the time that line is uttered the viewer has so bought into the film's suspension of disbelief, that when we see the shock on the faces of the apes, upon hearing a human speak, it mirrors the viewers' shock. Later, at the trial comes the great sequence where the three orangutan inquisitors will hear no more, and cover their eyes, mouths, and ears, in the classic see no evil, speak no evil, and hear no evil pose.
  What some forget, in all the manifest political analogies the film and series put forth- such as the three ape races corresponding with the three main Classical stocks of Man: Negroid/Gorilla, Caucasoid/Chimpanzee, and Mongoloid/Orangutan, is that Planet Of The Apes was also a devastating critique of organized religion and its deliberate deceits. Zira and Cornelius, with Zira's nephew, free Taylor, and he and Nova (Linda Harrison)- the female human given to him as a mate, escape with them to The Forbidden Zone- the desert where Taylor first landed. Zaius and the gorillas follow, on horseback, and Cornelius shows proof that humans preceded apes on the planet, including a human doll that could speak. Taylor asks if an ape would make a doll that speaks. They also find dentures and an artificial heart valve. The gorillas attack and Taylor takes Zaius hostage, gets food, water, a rifle and ammo, and he and Nova are allowed to escape along the shoreline, after scorning the man with a citation from Ape scripture: `Beware the beast man, for he is the Devil's pawn. Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust or greed. Yea, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land. Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours. Shun him; drive him back into his jungle lair, for he is the harbinger of death.' Zaius then blows up the cave and the secret of human history predating ape culture.
  One might think that Taylor should have pieced things together by now, but the film ends with him finally linking things up, when he comes across the deteriorated upper half of the Statue Of Liberty, and curses his ancestors. Whether the statue has been blown up or simply buried in sand is unclear. What is clear is that it is not only a great twist ending to the film, thought up by the film's original screenwriter, Rod Serling of The Twilight Zone fame, but an iconic political image- and the most devastating of the 1960s to come from film. Here is Heston, the embodiment of intelligent macho American goodness- far more so than the more one dimensional icon of John Wayne, on his knees and wailing, pounding the sand impotently, as all that was America is in ruins. Given that this was released not long after the Tet Offensive showed that America was losing in Vietnam, its impact was enormous.
  The film was one of the two great science fiction films released that year, which made sci fi a more respectable subject for serious drama. The other, of course, was Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, whose iconic imagery was on a par with this film's. Serling's original script, which more closely followed the novel's futuristic themes, was redone by Michael Wilson, who for budgetary reasons had to primitivize the ape society. The film won three Oscars- for best score, by Jerry Goldsmith, Best Costume Design, and Outstanding Achievement in Makeup- an honorary award specifically for the film's historic impact. It is the truly otherworldly and spooky score by Goldsmith that- along with Serling's original screenplay, make the film such a classic.",1222300800,,5673,4.819116135662898

2501188,4,B000E6ESEO,"In the wake of Charlton Heston's death, I decided to have a marathon viewing of his films. I rewatched many of my favorites and sought out some of those I had never seen.

""Planet of the Apes"" is an iconic film and one of my longtime favorites. Heston stars as Taylor, an astronaut who crashes on a planet ruled by talking apes. Here humans are mute and primitive, treated like animals. Taylor is an anomaly that perplexes and frightens the apes (imagine us discovering an intelligent ape who could speak). The scientists want to study him, the superstitious leaders want to destroy him.

Although it may seem like a mindless sci-fi movie on the surface, ""Apes"" deals with heavy themes like prejudice, social class, and the nuclear threat. With one exception (see next paragraph), it is well written, beautifully shot, and artfully directed. The film is full of great scenes: the astronauts' journey across the hauntingly bleak landscape, the chilling ""hunting party"" attack, and of course the famous twist ending. The score by Jerry Goldsmith is discordant and clangy, but it creates the perfect mood of otherworldly menace. Heston turns in one of his best performances (""Get your stinking hands off me . . ."").

However, for such an intelligent film, there is one ludicrous plot hole: though he believes he is on a planet far from earth, Taylor never once questions why the apes speak perfect English! It is inconceivable that he wouldn't wonder how this ""alien"" society speaks his language or uses remarkably familiar weapons like rifles.

If you can overlook this error, ""Apes"" is really an enjoyable film, certainly much better than the misguided 2003 remake. It is a classic of science fiction and a must-see for any Heston fan.",1213142400,,1734,4.907849829351536

After seeing it again now I feel that we are one step from living in the Planet of the Apes. Look at the political/ educational/social structure...race...if you don't see it...you're blind.

2501191,2,B000E6ESEO,"""Camp"": something so bad it is good. A 60's word and good description of ""Apes"".

""Apes"" was filmed in 1968, eight years after an episode called ""I Shot an Arrow in the Air"" appeared on ""Twilight Zone"". This episode was about the first manned spacecraft in space, which is lost on the radar and crashes in a desert. Three crew members survive and think they've landed on an asteroid or something. They fight over the limited water supply and one goes off to find more water.  He goes to the top of a mountain and what do you think he sees? Telephone poles! They are still on Earth, Nevada, no less! Sound familiar?

H.G. Welles wrote a novella called ""The Time Machine"". Remember the Eloi and the Morlocks who were their masters? See any similarities to the apes and humans in ""Apes""?

Serling sometimes wrote some brilliant scripts for ""Zone"", but some were heavy-handed in their moralizing. ""Apes"" does this in relentless Stanley Kramer style.

Too much doesn't make sense. The astronauts don't wonder why gravitation and the atmosphere on this new planet are identical to that on Earth? Why the apes speak English identical to that spoken when they left Earth? Why some have American accents and some English accents? How, with their clumsy hands, they can do intricate surgery? Why, if they are intelligent enough to do this, have they not considered flight? Why everybody is physically the same as on Earth?

Charlton Heston gives his usual wooden performance (""he runs the gamut of emotions from A to B""). Others give performances from good to excellent.

The script runs from pretty awful (""Don't trust anyone over 30""--isn't Heston's character over 30?) to inspired, the majority being middling. If you like your movies, even science fiction, to make sense, this movie is annoying.  If it doesn't matter to you, you'll love it.",1207440000,4,1835,4.840255591054313
2501192,4,B000E6ESEO,"We were headed for the moon. Astronauts were in. Charlton Heston plays an astronaut who returns to Earth after a nuclear war. Apes rule.  Humans are reduced to animal status.  This was about the time Desmond Morris' book, ""The Naked Ape,"" came out. Evolution had gained ground. We were seeing ourselves as members of an animal kingdom rather than as a special creation. I saw social comment. The Civil Rights movement was afoot and the race riots which went with it. We have an inverted hierarchy. Linda Harrison as Nova did not have to speak.",1203724800,,543,4.705263157894737

2501197,1,B000E6ESEO,"This movie could have been so much better, as could the remake.

If you have actually read the Pierre Boulle novel, and seen Rod Serlings

original draft and Artur P Jacobs pre-production artwork, you can really appreciate what a disaster the final outcome was.

In the behind the PLanet of the Apes dvd, there is the original screentest showing Edward G Robinson as Zaius, the Orangutan makeup was so much better, than waht eventually turned up.

This film really needs to be made the way it was intended, with the astronauts landing on a parralel world, where the apes are technologically advanced.

Actually the ending of Burtons remake stuck pretty true to Boulles ending of the planet of the apes.",1180310400,3,702,4.816666666666666

8106625,5,B000E6ESEO,"This fifty-year-old 1968 film is the very first film that was made of Pierre Boulle's 1963 book, the man who also wrote The Bridge over the River Kwai. It is a very intelligent film. It causes us to think about our own civilization, our culture, our religion, treatment of animals and other humans; in fact, about everything that is part of our lives. The film was so good that it sparked the making of others with a similar treatment: in 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1998, 2001, 2011, 2014, and 2017. It also sparked TV in 1974 and 1975-76. The film also has a good analysis of the psychology on humans, their history, and much more. It is a classic in the best sense of that term. If you haven't seen it, I recommend that you do so. If you saw it in the past, it would probably help you to see it again.",1516320000,,800,4.235294117647059
