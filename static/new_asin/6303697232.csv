My 6-yr old daughter had watched it on Netflix repeatedly, but then they suddenly removed it from their playlist. She has been anxious for months to watch it again,...and we finally own it now! I watched it with her and I surprisingly enjoyed it from beginning to end! It's a funny, laugh-out-loud kind of movie for the entire family to share together. There is some emotion to it too!

712190,1,6303697232,"Just received it yesterday and couldn't play it, has too many scratches to even watch the movie.  I will never buy a used DVD movie ever again!!!",1401494400,,145,4.37037037037037
712191,5,6303697232,"This film was a laugh and a sidetickler throughout with the great natural actress Thora Birch, the child who wants a pet but whose new father has an allergy to pet fur, while Harvey Keitel as a gypsy-thief with a capuchin monkey is perfect as greedy and conniving but easily thwarted and defeated jewelry/wallet crook.

The filming of this looks almost magical - how did they get the monkey to do all these things, especially the amazing chase scene throughout the boardwalk of Venice Beach, surrounded by joggers, skaters, bike riders and spectators, skateboarders and chaos?  The ability of the monkey to steal watches and wallets from unsuspecting tourists was a pleasure to watch.  Gives one ideas!

Meanwhile, Thora Birch plays a smart and able girl whose mother is about to re-marry.  New hubby-to-be is patient to a point, but when he sneezes his head off with every cat or dog around, there's no way that Thora's going to have a pet.  She's desperate, because she wants to have it for herself of course, but also to show her friends at school, the show-and-tell deal.

This monkey is loose, ran away from the gypsy, and she finds it, slips it into her backpack, and adopts it!

Oh boy!  The Troubles begin and they're hilarious!

Don't want to give away the whole plot full of monkey trouble.  Suffice to say that it's a pleasure for any adult or child to watch, it's got very realistic acting in both adults and children, Thora's parents are tough and strict enough to punish her, and the school doesn't let the kids get away with nonsense either.  The dresscode at the public school looks pretty loose, but then, it's Southern California and I'm warped from Catholic school days of the 1960's.  Also noteworthy to my adult eyes is the girl's freedom:  she can come and go remarkably freely and do very mature things without too much interference, such as going out on her own to ride a bike down Venice Beach.

Venice Beach has always attracted its share of loonies and weirdos and certainly a few childmolesters!  Would a parent really allow that kind of freedom to a girl of 9 or 10????

But this is the kind of freedom that kids everywhere dream of, so live a little and fly free with Thora on her bicycle in and out of the surf-n-sun world, fantasy to be that young again WITHOUT the usual restrictions that normal parents impose.

Her real Dad, divorced and busy and always flying around for his work (they're always successful businessmen, these divorced and move-out Dads, eh?), so he hasn't the time for Thora and cancels his weekend visit with her with a work excuse.

She takes complete advantage of this and creates a perfect deception, which I had to admire; alarming to this oblivious busy-busy Dad.  Good to know that your kids are resourceful, but perhaps this one is a bit much for Dad to handle!!!

Twenty years after its shooting, it's still fresh and looks wonderful.  How slowly our society is changing, one could think.  It's a big leap from 1950's to 1970's in mentality and fashion change, but it seems we're now stagnating since the 1970's.

I think it's Don Fisher and GAP which has frozen us here, but maybe it's a couple of other factors, too.  Casual dressing for all, alleluia!  Even Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco, in 1990's trying to upgrade the low dresscode of City Hall, got a private phone call from Don Fisher (RIP) who told him to rescind the dress change order, since he had spent a lifetime trying to get people into jeans.

Just a comment - sociological observations of streets scenes of America come easily when sititng on a couch in California!",1394496000,,3601,4.656645569620253

712193,3,6303697232,it Rate P.G movie plus it is 87 mins long Are you ready for the cutest criminal pet of all time? He's Dodger and although he tiny he manages to get into trouble than a whole barrel full of monkey I do not real want to say to much,1367971200,,229,3.693877551020408

712195,5,6303697232,I bought this years ago for my children and they loved it. I recently bought it for my daughter because she wanted it again. Years later and she still loves it. Would recommend to others.,1345161600,,187,4.371428571428571
712196,5,6303697232,"I bought this for my grandchildren but found I enjoyed it, too.  It is a cute, interesting story. It is fast-moving and keeps children's and adult's interest. The actors and actresses, as well as the monkey, give top-notch performances.",1340755200,,236,5.051282051282051

712318,5,6303697232,"No, seriously I've seen tons of Family movies, some are heartwarming, some are deep, some shallow but funny, and after watching how many of my favorites Family movies have been re-made I kinda thought ideas are running out and mainly I've seen it all. Every once in a while, however, I stumble upon an old flick that for whatever reason I had skipped in the past and leaves me really impressed.
I picked this title because I loved little Thora Birch in ""Patriot Games and ""Paradise"" and I thought let's give it a try, I read also that Harvey Keitel was in it, so I thought maybe there is a good movie that I've missed. Didn't expect much, after all I've seen it all in Family movies, dolphins, gorillas, orcas, mice, parrots, cats, dogs, llamas, so what a monkey could bring in addition to that.
Well, when you think you've seen it all, something will stun you, that is this movie, Thora Birch at her best no doubt about it, the monkey is so funny, and script absolutely hilarious, specially about the confusion over framing the adorable protagonist as a common thief, well I'm not gonna give anything else up, but give it a try I bet you will enjoy it.",1322956800,,1153,4.469194312796208
712319,5,6303697232,"I loved this movie as a kid. Kinda cheesy like all children's films, but worth watching. Anyone who's ever loved a pet will be a fan of this film.",1287187200,,146,4.068965517241379
712320,3,6303697232,"This is a great babysitting movie for the children. It's just not geared towards the adult mind. Mimi Rogers does an okay job, but nothing stellar. Harvey Keitel does a slightly better job as a con man with a monkey and an organ grinder. Again, the kids will watch it over and over again for the cute monkey, so this film has it's value in that regard. It's free of foul language or any off color innuendo, so Monkey Trouble is safe.",1264809600,,433,4.2926829268292686
712321,2,6303697232,"Though advertised as a ""splendid family film,"" the cuteness was spoiled by non-stop bad attitudes throughout the film. There were some funny scenes, but our kids (who are usually very easy to please) were not that impressed. Save your money for Because of Winn-Dixie or MVP (Most Valuable Primate).",1248998400,2,298,5.1020408163265305
712322,4,6303697232,I got this video for my 4 yr. old grand daughter.  We have watched it many times when she comes to visit.  It is very entertaining movie about a little girl and a monkey!,1231977600,,170,3.9705882352941178
712323,4,6303697232,Another of my favorite movies that stars Thora Birch when younger. A lonely girl finds a monkey in the park and it goes from there to her trying to hide it and escape the gypsy that previously owned the monkey. It is a great movie!,1225584000,,231,4.155555555555556
712324,4,6303697232,"Brought this movie for the kids and they love it and watch it over and over again. If you have't got it then buy it for your kids, they'll love it.",1218326400,,147,3.774193548387097
712325,5,6303697232,A fun story for kids - what movie with a money isn;t?? (I gave it as a gift with the book.),1191283200,,91,3.380952380952381
712326,1,6303697232,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. On one hand, it's an enjoyable kids movie that's somewhat entertaining. On the other hand, it sends a very negative message to our youth. It's all fun and games until halfway through the movie where Dodger gains mutant powers from eating a toxic banana after sneaking into a government bio engineering plant and decides to use his powers for evil rather than good. Eva gets sick and Dodger decides to rob a bank to pay the medical bills. Jean Claude Van Dam is a special forces agent working to stop the monkey in time (I think he's a pretty good actor). There is a plot twist that's somewhat good but I won't spoil it here. I recommend picking up ""Slam Dunk Ernest"" instead.",1178496000,3,715,4.507692307692308
