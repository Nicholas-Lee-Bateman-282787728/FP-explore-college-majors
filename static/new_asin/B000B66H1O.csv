I saw him jump at the Cow Palace in San Francisco, in the early 70's
He was a World record holder, Very underrated !!! But the DVD was very good!
Does Anyone know how to get Memorabilia on ""Super Joe"" ?  would appreciate it !!",1429833600,,293,4.140350877192983
8216540,5,B000B66H1O,"I'm a musician, and bought this DVD to do research for a song I wrote (haven't published the album yet...) about a childhood motorcycle jumping hero of mine, Super Joe Einhorn. He used to do jumps at a race track about a mile from my parent's house, so we saw him all the time (including his fateful ""last"" jump).

Evel Knievel, who was the most famously-hyped jumper during the same time frame in the early 70's, was really best-known for the times he crashed, like the crash at Caesar's Palace in 1967. This was his longest attempted jump, at 141 feet. Of course, there was also his famous Wembly Stadium and Chicago Shark Tank crashes, too. He was also in the Guinness Book of World Records for most broken bones.

Meanwhile, Super Joe Einhorn successfully jumped 15 full-size buses (170 feet), and was also in the Guinness Book of World Records not for broken bones, but for longest ramp-to-ramp jump. Who was the better jumper?? (Also give credit to Bobby Gill, who was great around that time too, but unfortunately I never saw him jump.) In fact, Super Joe challenged Evel to a $25,000 jump-off, and Evel declined.

And yet today, if you go looking for information on these two, you'll find tons of stuff on Evel Knievel, (who is considered a motorcycle jumping legend), while Super Joe Einhorn, who was in fact the best jumper, is almost forgotten. Super Joe Einhorn was the best, and deserves to be remembered as such. This DVD remembers him. Great footage that brings back memories of a true childhood hero of mine!",1380672000,,1524,4.657992565055762
