8347974,5,B000EGCD64,"Many of the Lassie episodes are available on YouTube, but these two are not. ""The Disappearance ""  explains how Lassie and Ranger Corey Stuart met, setting the stage for a later transition of ownership from Timmy. ""Look Homeward"" was on a Viewmaster I remember from my childhood.  I really enjoyed reminders from the past, and was struck even more by how well-trained Lassie was for this show. Reminder: this DVD was released overseas and so you need a region free DVR to be able to watch it.",1485648000,,492,4.64367816091954
