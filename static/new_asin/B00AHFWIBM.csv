8551592,4,B00AHFWIBM,"This series revealed what it takes to be a real photojournalist. It's hold your breath and grip your chair watching. Three really talented photographers put their lives on the line to get their photos in areas of the world where I would not dare go, let alone do photography.
Extraordinarily captivating!
I took one star off because it was not offered in blu ray, as I originally watched this series in HD on HBO.",1405123200,,413,4.594594594594595
8551593,5,B00AHFWIBM,"Featuring three photojournalists, this documentary follows them on specific assignments: the drug war in Mexico, the uprising that leads to the capture and execution of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, the search for the Arrow Boys in South Sudan, and the government attempt to clean up crime in Rio de Janeiro before the World Cup and Olympics Games. For me, the most powerful was the segment on South Sudan. French photojournalist Veronique de Viguerie searches for the Arrow Boys in their relentless battle to reclaim their villages from the brutal LRA, led by Joseph Kony. I'd read about the conflict, but this segment put it in an entirely new light. De Viguerie and the filmmakers effectively convey that the people of South Sudan are neither helpless victims nor one more version of the brutal militia they fight. They, like many others throughout history, are fighting for their homes, their children, and their futures. If the media had more journalists/photojournalists like Veronique de Viguerie, and told more stories the way this one is told--thoughtfully, complexly, wholly, instead of with the intent to incite anger and conflict like so much media seems to these days--we would be living in a very different world. Another powerful segment worth the price of the whole documentary is the clip of Michael Christopher Brown speaking with an elderly couple in Libya who, in a few brief minutes, bring the devastating cost of war and conflict right down to the most heartbreaking, most essential human element.
I would have preferred if the fourth segment (Rio) would have followed a different photojournalist rather than revisiting Eros Hoagland, who we saw in the first segment on Mexico, but that's a minor criticism. This is a unique, enlightening, well-crafted look at the men and women behind the lenses of history.",1394582400,2,1826,5.110367892976589
