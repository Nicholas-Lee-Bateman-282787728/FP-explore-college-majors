479563,4,6302561760,"I have been enjoying this workout video for years.  The Hot Dance is one of the few aerobic sessions you can actually follow.  Some may call it boring, I say thanks for a video that doesn't have me tripping over  myself!  The exercise band workout is great for toning. Many of the sets  can be done with hand weights if you don't have bands.",954288000,8,341,4.265625
479564,5,6302561760,it is so nice to see cher work out along with you . some for the stars just want to make money  off you . i ablive cher truly enjoys her work out and wants to help .  if cher comes out with a new video i would buy it to.,921196800,5,220,3.2941176470588234
479688,5,6302561760,"I first bought this workout Video in 1995. I bought it because I wanted a fun/dance aerobic video and I choose this from the many others because I am a fan of Cher. Cher does the workout ""with"" you, she doesn't lead the class, her dance choreographer does. The moves are fun, not always easy but you eventually get the hang of it. I did the video everyday for 1 year and lost 80 pounds. I felt and looked great! I read some other comments and there was some drama about her workout costume, I was not offended at all, It's CHER, she always dresses like that. Besides I just looked at her butt and waist the whole time thinking I want mine to look like that. She looked great and I found it motivating to keep working out. Now that I need to lose some weight again (I stopped working out when I had my kids)  It just seemed logical to do Cher's Body Confidence dance aerobic video again. You burn like 580 calories. There is another workout on the video (a strength training with bands routine) but I cant comment on it, I never did it. I always stuck to the ""Hot Dance"". I am living proof that yes I would recommend it and I would buy it again. Enjoy!",1334966400,4,1151,4.184684684684685
479689,1,6302561760,"Cher is best known for her emmy award winning roal in ""Mask"" in which she plays a loving but care free and slutty biker skank who cares for what i can only assume is humpty dumptys mutilated cousin Lenny. Lenny is the forsaken son of the lead biker-apha-douche that had been serendipitously dumped into the caring cheese grater fingers of Cher's character Skeletor. In this movie about trailer dwelers down on their luck, Skeletor and Lenny break through the social boundries that bind a them while simultaniously finding out what what a terrible actress walking beef jerky makes. The entire time I watched I found myself wondering ""how is it possible that a dried meat product could possibly be this confident"". That is until I found this VHS tape at the bottom of the bargin bin of my local flee market.

In this 4 hour botox injection trail, Cher flaunts her various plastic parts in full view of the awe-struck public. I was so blown away by this gay-man's hetro-mother-fantasy that I had been lulled into some kind of subconscious coma as during I must have suffered from the lost-time phinominom that many alien upductees often experiance. when I came too Im not to proud to admit that I had worked off  90 pounds of beer weight, had caves of steel and my butt hurt. Its possible that I had been working out for days but In truth its hard to say from the amount of sand I found in my ass. Now I know what nebraska looks like and its all thanks to Cher and her hypnotising thong.

This video should come with a warning label that should read: ""Dear consumer, by buying, stealing or otherwise accidentally whitnessing this satirical backwash, you are putting youself and others in harms way. Even sniffing the sulefain coating that may or may not be wrapping this douce may cause dizziness, miscarage or projectile vomiting (even if not on a rolercoaster) and watching with both eyes open at the same time could cause you to wake up in a different state in someone elses body.""

Aside from the side effects the up side is that you may now be proud to add to your resume that you have proven Darwin's Law of survival. That is, whatever doesn't kill you, makes you crap sand and wake up in the midwestern cornfield.

In conclusion; please please pretty please make it stop! My ears are still bleeding from her last hit-single and if you buy this video you are supporting domestic terrorism.

479690,4,6302561760,I lost 20 pounds easily at home with this video. It was fun to watch and do. My VHS ripped of so much use but I am getting it back and turn it to CD because after many years gym with Cher has been the most effective exercise I have done in my life.,1307145600,4,248,3.611111111111111

479693,5,6302561760,This VHS arrived within days of ordering it.  It replaced an old video that I have used for years. This new video is working great.

479694,5,6302561760,"I've been doing the dance workout for almost 15 years and lost tons of weight.  It's still my favorite video, it's the only one I have that is fun enough to keep me going.  Cher isn't leading the video, she only exercises to it and makes her comments.  The music is fun as well.  There is a bit of Cher talking at the beginning, I just fast forward that and do the dance part.  I just wish I could find another workout I like as well.",1220745600,,434,4.0
479695,3,6302561760,"I jumped to buy this tape because I was blown away by Cher's New Attitude which has an over the top toning segment.  But with this video, the aerobics is ridiculously long, 45 minutes.  20 minutes is plenty for any aerobic routine; even Jane Fonda's Workout Challenge has a 20 minute aerobic segment.  I found it to be boring because it's too long, but I could over look that if this video contained an ab workout, which it doesn't.  The workout is 90 minutes long like her first video.  Who ever heard of a 90 minute workout that doesn't include the abs?  Gee, after 90 minutes, you still have to put in more time to work your abs!  Ridiculous!  However, the toning part with the rubber bands is over the top!  I love it!  This is why I give the tape 3 stars. Cher still managed to come through.  It would have gotten 5 if the aerobics were shorter and it had a ab workout.  What I'll do is skip the aerobics altogether and just do the toning part.  The rubber band thing is awesome!  I recommend that you try it, you'll love it!  But pair it up with another workout for your abs and aerobics.  The toning part is only 45 minutes.",1215475200,,1131,4.23943661971831
479696,5,6302561760,"It's important to remember while doing this workout that it was made in the early nineties, by a woman who, although admirable, is almost entirely plastic and is wearing a fishnet bodysuit and thong.

If you're willing to accept all of this and laugh along with or at the video, WHILE getting a good workout, then it's definitely the movie for you. The most important thing to have when approaching CherFitness is a sense of humor. Maybe it wasn't meant to be hilarious, but it is. So laugh.

As for the workout itself, I consistently find myself sweating and breathing harder, maintaining my heart rate within the ""target range"" (there is a heart rate check performed in the middle of the workout), AND having a good time. I really enjoy the ""Hot Dance"", as I like dancing in general, and the instructor (Dorian Sanchez) guides you through it slowly enough so that you understand it, but quickly enough so that you don't get bored. The dance moves are designed to work basically all the major muscle groups in your body, and they do!

I'll admit that I've never done the resistance band workout which comes after the Hot Dance, because I don't own the bands and it doesn't look as interesting. The Hot Dance is definitely worth the price of the entire movie, however (which, incidentally, is CHEAP).

One caution: despite the fact that this movie is INSANELY fun, don't do it TOO many times in one week, or you'll get bored with it.",1172880000,2,1433,4.6299212598425195
479697,1,6302561760,"I bought this video at a used clothing store for $1.99, and I know now that I paid way too much for it.  This video is a JOKE!  Cher looks like a total tramp, and I felt sick to my stomache whenever the camera showed her backside.  And, when they were doing the cool down, she kept pushing her crouch in and out, so that you could see her waxed bikini like (yuck!).  She has absoultely no modesty in her.  How can anyone give her any type of respect.  Also, she was not wearing a workout utfit, she was wearing a trampy outfit.  This so called ""hot dance"" is nothing more then bunch of girls gallopping like a horse and I'm not kidding you.  They take breaks seems like every 20 seconds, and the instructor says ""pony"", then they all hop around like a pony throught the entire video!  There's a huge portion of the video where the girls not only gallop around like a horse, they also say ""I'm pony, your pony, we all love out pony!"".  What the hell is this? I can't even describe the rest of the exercises.  Well, maybe I can describe it this way.  They go from side to side, then they move their arm forward and backword while they move one side of their leg up and down sidewards.  It looks so stupid!  They kept doing this movie over and over.  Also, throw in the pony moves and that's what they called the hot dance.  Skip this so called work out video.",1134259200,4,1357,4.181467181467181
479745,1,6302561760,"I saw this video at a garage sale for 10 cents, so I thought I try it out.  I could not help but laugh throughout the whole video.  Now, I am the person who has ton of workout videos, and I have been working out in the gym for over several years.  I have also trained with a great personal trainer, so I'm not a newcomer to working out.  When I saw this video with Cher, I was flabergasted that she would put out this kind of nonsese!  First, she wore ton of makeup and her hair is huge like a prostute's hair.  She also wore some stylish booths, which I thought she should have worn some comfortable athletic shoes.  She also wore very revealing skimpy outfit, and wasn't a thong string go up her butt?  She should have put out this kind of video under Play Boy's title.  Cher also made some snotty coments, and that tells me that she think she is miss high and mighty!  I want to listen to someone who smiles and encourages, and not someone who acts like she is some kind of queen and make sarcastic comments.  If you are a dire hard fan of Cher, then you might like this video.  But, if you want a serious workout video, then look for videos that have won some sort of awards.",1134259200,4,1179,4.12280701754386
479746,5,6302561760,This is my all-time favorite.  I got it when it came out and it will always be old faithful.  I like to mix my exercise sessions up but I still do this one weekly.  I even recorded the audio and brought it with me when I traveled for work.  I always feel totally worked out doing the Hot Dance.  It is a fun and very cool routine.,1110931200,8,330,3.8656716417910446
479747,5,6302561760,My Mother In Law gave me this video when she went from a size 16 to an 8! That was 13 years ago and I'm STILL using it! When I first started using it I was AMAZED! I didn't know working out could be so much FUN! The Hot Dance routine is easy to catch on to and VERY fun! The music is GREAT and Cher looks DYNAMITE! My tape came with a set of resistance bands for the second part of the video. After all these years they finally broke. So I had to replace them. But after all this time it's STILL one of my favorites. :),1097020800,8,519,3.770642201834862
479748,4,6302561760,"I was so looking forward to another Cher video after watching ""A New Attitude"". I was somewhat disappointed in this tape, mainly because Keli Roberts wasn't instructing.  It's very dancy and fun and uses a fundamental building technique which can seem repetitious.  It is very well choreographed and, while the steps seem intimidating at first, it flows well.  Cher is funny and campy and doesn't take herself too seriously.  Overall, a very good video for those with an intermediate skill level.",1093564800,11,496,5.08641975308642
479749,4,6302561760,"I just started the workout, but I LOVE it. I ususally Jazzercise and do strength training, but this video still makes me sweat. I liked Cher's  um..... workout wear. It definately gives you something to strive for and look at while you are working out!!! I would reccomend this video to anyone who wants to feel like a dancer, and burn some fat. The strength training is hard, but well worth the results.",1080086400,8,404,4.534246575342466
479750,5,6302561760,"I love this video!  The Hot Dance really gets the heart pumping and the body sweating!  Dorian Sanchez is a wonderful and fun instructor.  I still have fun with this workout, and I've been doing it off and on for ten years!  I am not very coordinated when it comes to dancing, but I find the moves easy to follow and fun to do.  It is tough to do in a small space, but I would strongly recommend this aerobic workout if you want fun and effective.
The second section in done with resistance bands and is also very good.  Personally I'm not crazy about the bands, but I'm sure you could do most of it just as well with hand weights.  I don't do this workout as often as the first, but it is good also.
CHER ROCKS! :)",1019433600,21,715,4.064285714285714
479751,4,6302561760,"This workout is divided into two sections: the first is a 38 minute fat-burning aerobic dance workout and the second is a gruelling all-over body workout using resistance bands.
The ""Hot Dance"" workout is led by top choreographer, Doriana Sanchez. Sanchez has choreographed Cher's stage shows and videos; was one of the dancers in the Patrick Swayze film, Dirty Dancing; choreographed the live Dirty Dancing shows; Copacabana and many other popular shows. Anyone who has Cher's first workout tape will remember Sanchez as the one on the floor without the step :-) This workout is fun and you go straight into the warm-up and then on to building up the dance routine little by little. Some of the steps are a little bit tricky and yes, it is a little repetitive but thats all to the good and the moves are demanding enough that even if you mentally wished it was longer and more varied, your body is perfectly happy with the workout as it is :-)  Overall the first workout is fun to do and it doesn't get old. The music isn't as good as Cher's last fitness tape but it's still good enough to workout with especially when you bear in mind that this tape was made ten years ago! Like a lot of dance workouts, you're not going to use this to put on your own show, but it's great for burning fat and I find that I see results straight away. Cher's workout tapes are the ones I use when I need to lose weight. I'd recommend using this with Cindy Crawford's Next Challenge [fabulous for toning, strengthening and stamina] They're fun and maybe I'm in the minority but I actually loved Cher's workout gear :o)
Workout two is a 45 minute killer. Although this workout is designed to be used with resistance bands, you can do it just as well using weights. This workout is very intense and it's very encouraging to see Cher expressing the same pain you are feeling as you are put throught the moves. The results are very good but can I say.... OW! It really is difficult. Even the super-fit will struggle with this workout at first, because of its intensity and because it works those muscles that don't often get used.",1016323200,29,2109,4.520942408376963
479752,1,6302561760,"I checked this out of our library before buying it - what IS this video, a joke?  She spends 10 minutes talking first - HUGE hair (...) - then shows up to the ""class"" in some outfit that looks like she's ready for her Playboy pictorial (Please, Cher, most of us are here to exercise, we really don't need to see your newly waxed bikini line!) and the so-called ""exercise"" is tapping your feet to the rhythm of watered-down (elevator-ized) rock music.  NOT for anyone who actually wanted to sweat or get their hair mussed....I'm wondering who the target audience was for this video...",1007510400,2,583,4.596153846153846
479753,4,6302561760,"I love this video!  In the past, I've used this video when I needed to tone up.  It's ALWAYS worked.  The ultimate test was after my daughter's birth 4 years ago.  I found this tape exhilirating and easy to use.  I  could set the pace to my individual need.  The music is dated, but who  cares?  It's the moves and the results that matter!  Not to mention, I  LOST ALL THE BABY FAT IN LESS THAN 2 MONTHS!  I've recently put on weight  and decided I need to go back to the basic.  I've looked all over for this  video.
