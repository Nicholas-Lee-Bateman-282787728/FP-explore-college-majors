8143762,4,B000I2IUFM,"There's only one reason to own ""Bloodied But Unbowed"": It's filled with great music. However, the production values of the music videos is pretty low, consisting mainly of pointing the camera at the performers on stage while they belt out that great music. Unfortunately, while those performers make great music, most of them are about as interesting to see perform as watching a pot-bellied, grease stained car mechanic drag a wheelbarrow full of rusting car parts around a stage. It makes me wonder why go through the trouble of making a mediocre DVD, when a great CD would have been better. Oh sure, there are some performers on this DVD with real stage presence; Old 97s, The Meat Purveyors, and the Detroit Cobras. But most are dull, dull....as in dullsville, baby.
And it's unfortunate that BS Records either doesn't have the resources, or the inclination to make a real music video using some of these bands because the raw, musical talent is certainly there to make truly legendary music videos. This DVD leaves me wondering what a band such as Trailer Bride, or Devil in a Woodpile (to name just a few) could do with the resources that made such classic music videos as ""Once in a Lifetime"" (Talking Heads, 1980), ""Thriller"" (Michael Jackson, 1984), or ""Take on me"" (a-Ha, 1985) possible back in the Golden Age of the Music Videos. Alas, we'll probably never know.

Still, ""Bloodied But Unbowed"" is worth buying....just barely. After all, it's all about the music...and this DVD has some great music.",1417478400,,1509,4.871595330739299
8143763,4,B000I2IUFM,Great to have a visual compilation to go with all of their audio compilations(bloodshot records)Love a lot of these bands but I didn't know what they looked like. Great for any fan of alternative country too,1410393600,,207,4.777777777777778
8143764,5,B000I2IUFM,The Ryan Adams feature/documentary alone is worth the price of this disc. Throw in all the other stuff and this is a no-brainer. Bloodshot Records is a great label. And this DVD gives you a great overview of their roster over the years. Recommended...and then some.,1198108800,,265,4.782608695652174
8143765,5,B000I2IUFM,"This official Bloodshot DVD has both songs and stories sections with a lot of interesting , funny and excellent parts to check out . The stories section has very good mini-docu's including one on Chicago's Sundowners trio. It's hard to believe these guys played gigs 3-5 nights a week for 35 years... and then hung out together on their days off to golf , fish etc. !

The other features are cool including the Chicago Chik-a Go Go cable dance show , touring with Ryan Adams , a Meat Purveyors show experience and the Yard Dog Barbecue which looks like a lot of fun. The videos of both Graham Parker and Jon Rauhouse with his tasty band and featured singers, is in a club type setting while the Wayne Hancock , Riptones , Bobby Bare, Detroit Cobras , Deadstring Brothers and others are pro shot song videos. The Paul Burch and  Sadies videos, 2 apiece , are minimal video productions with maximum musical content. Kelly Hogan sounds great as always and  too bad there isn't more of her  singing on the DVD. She is easily qualified to replace all these poptart divas we are bombarded with .Jon Langford who does the stylized artwork on the Bloodshot comp. covers is an excellent master of Ceremonies featured in a few spots.

I fast forwarded through Scroat Belly, Trailer Bride ( cool saw solo ! ) and the Mekons as it just seemed like a blur of thrashiness that sounded pretty much the same . Maybe others would enjoy it more than we did.

Everything else was of pretty high musical content and very enjoyable . Hopefully there will be a volume 2 in the future from the great folks at Bloodshot",1168128000,2,1595,4.501730103806229
