I love them!  All my kids at about 18 mos to 2yrs attached themselves to a character and my 4th child, now 2 yrs old loves Barney.  This 2 CD was perfect!  I'm on a budget and at $20 for the set (ten for each CD at a local *mart) was inexpensive and and cheaper than buying a single DVD or video plus I get variety.  She loves them both and my older boy loves them both because in Pre-K he was learning his nursery rhymes and now that school is out, he loves the Let's Play School.

The Rhyme Time Rhythm has all the classic Nursery Ryhmes:

Did You Ever See a Lassie?

Hey Diddle Diddle

London Bridge

Peter Piper

Humpty Dumpty

To Market

This is the House that Jack Built

Mary, Mary Quite Contrary

Little Miss Muffeet

Jack Be Nimble

Peter, Peter Pumpkin Eater

There Was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Show

Simple Simon

A Tisket, A Tasket

And a couple of Medleys of other Nursery Rhymes

 Let's Play School DVD has:

One Two Buckle My Shoe

Itsy Bitsy Spider

Where is Thumbiin

and other Barney Songs.

Both are cool DVD's.  I give them 5 stars because they are classis with their rhymes and they are longer than most at 1 hour long for each DVD.

I must give a thumbs down, though, not specifically to this DVD set, but ALL DVD's, they are not kid friendly.  I have to wait an entire minute (for a 18-24 mos old-that is an eternity) for Barney to start with their preview/federal law BS.  I can NOT click to go directly to the disc menu to play the movie.  Nor will the movie start until after the preview/federal law BS, but then I have to stay and push the play button after all that.  I need instant start of the movie for children-they are impatient.  I will say, that on some videos over the years, I have seen a decrease in the previews.  They seem to be at the end of some of the movies now.

I push for self-sufficiency as early as I can and my older kids were playing VHS tapes and switching them all by themselves by 2 yrs old.  (Push the tape in and it plays)  All I had to do was show them the eject button and they could push another tape in.  It was that simple.  I hope they get the DVD's that way soon.",1091059200,26,2316,4.051111111111111

1800901,5,B000075BI1,THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT BARNEY THAT MAKES KIDS GO NUTS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT THESE DVDS ARE A GREAT COLLECTION AND YOUR KIDS WILL LOVE IT! BOTH THESE DVDS HAVE A LOT OF LEARNING AND ENTERTAINMENT.,1059696000,2,204,4.256410256410256
1800902,5,B000075BI1,"I watched these two DVD at least once a day every week.  My son just can't get enough of Barney and the Play school DVD is very education.  He is learning his shape, and new colors by mixing different colors.  They worth every penny!",1054512000,,233,4.25
1800903,5,B000075BI1,My son loves these DVDs and wants to watch it over and over! The rhymes and songs in both the DVDs are educational with catchy tunes.,1045267200,5,133,4.153846153846154
7974035,4,B000075BI1,"The DVD set is good. Just like the other parents, I feel the ""Lets play school"" DVD turned out to be more interesting for my daughter. She loves the way Baby Bop handles her school. But my frustration is with the quality of Barney DVD's. I own about 5 DVD's now, and I find most of them, get stuck every 1 min or so. I only hope HIT entertaintment, tries to rectify this quality problem on their end.",1140393600,2,400,4.141025641025641
7974036,5,B000075BI1,"When we first bought this, my daughter did not show much interest but later, she loves both the DVDs. After she joined preschool and learnt a few rhymes, she can relate those things with the ones in barney videos.",1131062400,2,213,4.487179487179487

7974038,3,B000075BI1,"I think all childrens DVD's should not have copy protection.  You must be able to copy the original and use the copy for every day use.  My 2 year old goes through Barney DVD's like diapers.  The average life span of Barney is 6 weeks at my house.  And when it stops playing he goes crazy, like a heroin addict in withdrawl.  Some thing has to be done so that Barney lives on.",1126828800,2,376,4.095890410958904
7974039,3,B000075BI1,"My daughter loves Barney, but neither of these held her attention as long as others have, and she flat out didn't want to watch the Rhyme Time. I think it might be because the kids weren't the ones she's used to, or maybe the songs weren't that familiar. She did watch the school DVD longer, and I personally liked it best of the two because it gives a good prep for what it will be like when she goes to school.",1124409600,4,412,4.098765432098766

7974041,1,B000075BI1,"Large dinosaur draped in purple. A mess of things, simply catastrophic. Purple first and foremost is the color of passion and royalty, this dinosaur displays neither of the forementioned. If your intention is to lower your child's intellect into the imaginary negative realm of blabbering idiocy this is a must buy. If you wish for your child to aspire to be more than a gas station attendant I recommend the more stimulating drivel displayed in the baby einstein masterpieces.",1114041600,3,477,5.050632911392405
7974042,5,B000075BI1,"So you want to do a report or finish that project but the kids want to play like energizer bunnies....then slip in this DVD and you have about two hours with the two DVD's. Works for my 17 month old and 6 year old! They love it and the older one can swap the DVD's so you don't have to be disturbed! they have nice menus and come with sing along, interactive games, read along..you can easily push another 2 hours with the other stuff but who cares? They just watch them over and over... Are't kids great?  This DVD collection should be bronzed!",1106697600,4,545,4.240384615384615
7974043,4,B000075BI1,"This is a great set of DVDs. My 18 month old LOVES them both.

I would have rated this set 5 stars but for the fact that the Rhyme Time Rhythm DVD is defective. The sound goes off and the DVD skips/jumps.

I cant even return it because I live in Hong Kong (had it delivered to a US address while my husband was visiting back home) it isn't worth the cost of mailing it back to Amazon.",1099094400,,384,3.91025641025641
