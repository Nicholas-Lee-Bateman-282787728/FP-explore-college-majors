8172486,1,B000MUUT5O,This item was FALSELY Advertised as having Christopher Lee in it. These are just a few of the old shows from the Ronald Howard TV Series made in the 50s. I was very upset with the seller who said that I was out of line for being upset for paying for something that was MISREPRESENTED as something that it's Not. Seller refunded my money BUT appearently refuses to put up a Correct Description even after being told Multiple times about the error from me and at least one other buyer. Use your own judgement/descrimination as to buying anything from this seller.,1283126400,,561,4.564356435643564
8172487,2,B000MUUT5O,"This DVD contains four classic TV shows of Sherlock Holmes from the 1950s.
None of which star Christopher Lee as advertised. It is a poor quality transfer from an apparently deteriorated master. I have bought worse, but not recently. Don't waste your money.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Golden-Years-of-Classic-Television-The-Adventures-of-Sherlock-Holmes-Vol-1/dp/B000MUUT5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Golden Years of Classic Television: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Vol. 1</a>",1189036800,4,529,8.298245614035087
