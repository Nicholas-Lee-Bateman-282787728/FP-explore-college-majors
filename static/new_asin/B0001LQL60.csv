8014113,5,B0001LQL60,"This DVD is exceptional.  It relies heavily on interviews with surviving German leaders.  It discusses five key decisions/elements of German strategy in WWII that ultimately hastened the end of the war. These include: the failure of the Germans at Dunkirk, Battle of Britain, the Me262, D-day and Barbarossa. In doing so, this video does not detract from the efforts of allied forces. If you are a WWII buff you will enjoy this video.",1093305600,,434,4.931506849315069
