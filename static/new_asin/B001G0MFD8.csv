The show is probably the best teen show at the moment, and honestly, it's BETTER than Gossip Girl's season 2.

Can't wait for season 2!",1244937600,2,310,4.517857142857143

3590389,5,B001G0MFD8,In the 2008-2009 season this was my second favorite show on Telivison Behind Ugly Betty. This season Gossip Girl went downhill. I can't wait for the second season. and i can't wait for the new Melrose Place,1243987200,2,206,4.594594594594595
3590390,1,B001G0MFD8,"The new 90210 is such a horrible and trite show. I grew up watching the original 90210 so I was expecting this spinoff to be fun, serious, and groundbreaking but I was sadly wrong. The acting is absolutely revolting, the only one who can act is the young girl who plays Audrina. All the girls have unhealthy bodies and the guys aren't much to look at. The writing is just plain lazy and uninspired. Jennie Garth and Shannen Doherty cannot even save this show from being a total disaster. This show is such a disgrace, stick to the orginial.",1243555200,6,540,4.4646464646464645
3590391,4,B001G0MFD8,"I was (and still am) a fan of the original ""Beverly Hills, 90210."" When I heard about the new spin-off series and learned that it would feature cameos by some of the original cast members, I knew I needed to tune in. However, I didn't expect to like it as much as I do. Although my favorite part of the show is catching up with old characters like Kelly Taylor, Donna Martin, and even the fabulous Brenda Walsh (!), the new cast of teens is very strong, and the show could easily stand on its own without the hype of the popular guest stars.

Similar to the original show, ""90210"" follows the adventures of Dixon and Annie, two siblings who move from Kansas to Beverly Hills and struggle to adjust. The series has a strong cast, and I like all the characters with a few exceptions (Naomi = SUPER ANNOYING!). Sure, sometimes the show is hokey, but it's a teenage soap opera...what else do you expect? Also, the product placement in this program is ridiculous...a fun thing to do is to count how many times you see Dr. Pepper in any given episode. Still, the show deals with many of the same issues the original series tackled, including teen pregnancy, drug addiction, mental illness, and more. I watched ""90210"" all season and am looking forward to Season 2. My only hope is that Shannen Doherty signs on for more cameos next year and that Dylan, Steve, and Brandon find their way back to my favorite zip code!",1243123200,2,1410,4.4863813229571985
3590392,3,B001G0MFD8,"As a fan of Beverly Hills, 90210 I find the new show interesting. Some faces from the original are in the new show, namely Kelly, Brenda, Jackie (Kelly's mother who is in just a few episodes), and Erin aka Silver (Kelly and David's half-sister). The show focuses on the Wilson family- mom, dad, daughter Annie (Darcy from Degrassi The Next Generation), and son Dixon (The Wire, The Secret Life of Bees). Storylines involve drugs, rehab, a teenage pregnancy, relationships, as well as a ton of other topics that today's teens can relate to. While the show is good, it isn't nearly as good as the FOX hit of the 1990s. Beverly Hills, 90210 will always be more superior in my opinion.",1236988800,5,681,4.636363636363637

3590438,5,B001G0MFD8,"As a fan of the original series, the reboot was an exciting new adventure to dive into. With the help of Jennie Garth, Shannon Doherty, Tori Spelling and Ann Gillespie they helped the first season spin off for the new family The Wilson's who recently relocated to Beverly Hills from Kansas due to Harry's mother's failing health. The writing in the first season is excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed the new series. As a fan, you may also enjoy.

It's more of an updated version of the series yet still enjoyable and filled with lots of drama and surprises around the corner.

3590503,5,B001G0MFD8,"Okay, maybe it's not a full-on 5 star show, but I'm giving it 5 stars to help it in the ""ratings"" here.  Because the bottom line is this show was big time fun to watch.  Yes, I found it mindless, unrealistic, vapid, but above all very, very entertaining.  I think what really made the show for me are the 4 main actresses--Shenae Grimes, AnnaLynne McCord, Jessica Lowndes and Jessica Stroup.  I was completely unaware of these actresses before this show and found all four really engaging.  They all do excellent jobs playing these mostly rich kid characters whose lives are filled with mostly trivial rich kid/high school kid drama.  And that's what this show is... trivial.  But that's what a lot of TV shows are.  This one just happens to be one of those ""mindless"" shows that was a whole lot of fun to watch.  I just bought seasons 2 and 3 and totally look forward to watching them.",1337385600,,886,4.522012578616352
3590504,3,B001G0MFD8,"It is fairly entertaining and the actors are pretty... but....
All the boys and girls look like they are from the same modeling agency and most of them look much older than 16.  Yes, the kids get into trouble and face difficult situations, but everything seems somehow exaggerated and clichd.
The greatest thing about the initial show was that the teens could relate to the characters and their problems. I do not see how someone can relate to the new crowd.  Maybe I am just getting old, though.
I think that the show's cast would better fit some TV show about models or actor in their mid twenties (not Kansas-born and LA teenagers).
Overall, the show is watchable provided that one does expect it to be the same cultural phenomenon as the initial Beverly Hills 90210.",1329350400,2,770,4.654411764705882

I am actually happy to see some of the old cast in the new movie and right now that is the only reason that I am watching it. I wish they continued with the original 90210. Its so interesting to see where their lives would go, if Kelly and Dylan would actually get married, and what happens with Donna and David, Steve and Janet, Brenda and Brendon. I know that Kelly and Dylan had a baby boy and Dylan left.",1297987200,,666,4.170542635658915

They appear ungrateful and make a big deal about the little things. How can the average young man and woman truly accept these people? The characters of 90210 don't suffer the realities of most Americans. Are they trying to mock the rest of society with their luxurious, CA lives. The apathy and vanity in our society has to end somewhere. You mistakenly slept with him or her, fine, confess and MOVE ON. Isn't that what life is about?",1295222400,,588,5.072164948453608

3590512,5,B001G0MFD8,"I actually was late watching '90210' because I thought, ""Hey, this seems like a stupid show."" Having loved other tween shows such as 'Gossip Girl', 'Veronica Mars', and 'Glee', I figured I should give it a shot.

Let me say that I am GLAD that I discovered this series. Although it is highly campy, it matches the vitality of 'Gossip Girl' while still maintaining its own originality and flavor. The acting is so-so. I began watching this series because of one of my favorite actors Tristan Wilds (""The Wire"", ""Secret Life of Bees"") stars in it, and he is actually one of the highlights of the show. He plays Dixon Wilson, an adopted African-American teen raised by a wealthy white family. His sister Annie Wilson, played by Shanae Grimes (""Degrassi""), is a lovable, yet indecisive teen trying to find solace in a new zip code alongside him.

The major plot of the series, to me, is acceptance: accepting what you have, accepting what you don't have, accepting what you want, and accepting what is to come. The location is brilliant because it spotlights on the lives of these kids and how great they have it when it comes to their financial stability. Here is a breakdown of the characters.

Annie Wilson - smart, lovable, fun.

Dixon Wilson - athletic, eager, romantic.

Naomi Clark - ruthless, indecisive, semi-romantic

Adrianna Tate-Duncan - starlet, abusive, overconfident

Ethan Ward - horny, caring, responsible

Navid Sharazi - active, geeky, heartfelt

Erin Silver - romantic, bipolar, gallant

More characters are on the show, including Rob Estes, Lori Loughlin, Jessica Walter, and Ryan Eggold, who play the adults on the series. They are a part of the main cast. There are guest and recurring roles of the original '90210' cast as well.

The show tackles major issues in today's society, including teen pregnancy, sexuality, drug and alcohol abuse, infidelity, rape, theft, and also murder.

Do not mistake this as one of those series that are idiotic and are genuinely lucky to still pull airtime, this is NOT ONE OF THOSE SERIES. The storylines are great, the characters are highly realistic (although rare), and the setting is prime. I hope this show stays on the air for at least another three seasons. It is highly entertaining.

The stars of this show, in my humble opinion, would be Tristan Wilds, Jessica Stroup, AnnaLynne McCord, and Jessic Lowndes. They have chemistry at what they do, and they leave us wanting more of them.

The extras are okay, nothing fancy. A few audio commentaries, behind-the-scenes footage on each disc. Best bet for this series is $25-$30, any more is ridiculous. Season Two will be released in August. This season includes all 24 episodes, both riveting and eclectic.

Do not miss out on one of television's hottest new series!

3590530,4,B001G0MFD8,"90210 is an excellent show a lot better than the old one, in 90210 I can definetly relate to David Silver on the show, he was a geek and an outsider of the group.  This show is like watching The O.C. meets 7th heaven.

First off there are some cast changes ... Dustin Milligan (Ethan) is no more.  Tabitha (Jessica Walter) is gone, and the Wilsons even live in a new house (I guess they sold the other one).

3590536,3,B001G0MFD8,"Comparing 90210 to Gossip Girl (as people will inevitably do) is a bit like comparing The Bond films to the Jason Bourne trilogy.

This will sound odd, but allow me to explain.

Both are big-budget shows which have very high production values in terms of editing, sound, cinematography, amazing wardrobes, etc

But, just like James ended up looking like a dork compared to Jason, we see a similar effect here.

90210 is like Bond - it has glitz, glamour, action, impossibly good-looking people, but with wafer thin characterisation, and suffers from a weak script.

Gossip Girl, the Bourne of the two (although it also has its fair share of glamour and hot people), has far better acting, feeding off a much more intricate, slick script.

Just like Bond flicks, the 90210 cast lacks lustre. Don't expect to find very strong performers like the deliciously Machiavellian Ed Westwick. With one very notable exception - Jessica Stroup (Silver). This actress is destined for big things.

Crucially, although Shenae Grimes (Annie) is talented, she lacks the gravitas to hold down such a key role in the show.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""90210 - THE FIRST SEASON"" is presented in 16:9 and features audio in English 5.1 and stereo.

I have to say that picture quality for the DVD is pretty good.  Many drama television shows tend to suffer from terrible low light situations but overall, ""90210' is a drama series that looks quite slick.  A lot of cool stock shots of California and for the most part, the series looks quite vibrant during the day time scenes and looks very good. I also have to say that the series looks great on DVD compared to having watched this series on television and for some reason, our CW somehow makes this show look quite muddy, dark and so, seeing it on DVD was like night and day.  The DVD looks very good.  But for a series like this, I hope that CBS considers releasing ""90210 - THE FIRST SEASON"" on Blu-ray via High Definition.

As for the audio, audio is in English 5.1 and for the most part, the series is dialogue driven.  So, it's purely front and center channel driven.  There are scenes with car crashes but sound effects are not the big part of this series but it's about the music that comes out alive.  One thing that has made ""90210' (and even the classic ""Beverly Hills 90210') so awesome is the use of modern, contemporary music and this series is heavy with music.  But dialogue is clear, music comes quite clear and for some reason, the menu screen for the DVD's sport the theme song with even louder music.

As for subtitles, the series comes with English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Like many people who adored ""Beverly Hills 90210', I couldn't wait for ""90210' and suffice to say, I enjoyed the series.  Part of the excitement and an allure for older viewers of BH90210 was seeing the original cast from the old series together with the new cast but also seeing how getting a new interpretation of the teenager of West Beverly High.

This time around, there is a good balance of showing the teens (like most teen shows that we see on the CW) and adults that are just not only guardians or people to go to advice but also parents that have an edge and portrayals of adults like in reality.  No sugarcoating and not following the same type of mold that was used from the 1950-1990's of parents or adults on television.  We literally get to see a merging of both worlds in a dramatic series for ""90210'.

But what I found quite intriguing is how many twist and turns had taken place throughout the first season. Episodes took on real life problems that people have in high school (as did the original series) but where the original series was lighthearted during the high school years, ""90210' is not exactly happy.  Each of these characters are trying to find happiness but somehow no matter how much money they have or what kind of cars they drive, they either have dysfunctional families or get involved with people that are probably not good for them.

But what was shocking for me was watching the final few episodes and seeing this buildup and how it all culminates into a shocking season finale that I never saw coming.  If you though Brenda and Brandon Walsh had challenges on ""Beverly Hills 90210', Annie and Dixon Wilson's first year at West Beverly Hills High School is even more chaotic and also quite intriguing.

But for me, it's interesting how this ""90210' differs in the fact that the people featured, do not all hang out with each other.  They are quite different and people who actually despise each other.

Jessica Lowndes as Adrianna Tate-Duncan is one actress who is definitely put through emotional ups and downs from being a drug addict, to a person that feels alone, to a person who is eventually pregnant, right now the writers of the show utilize her character in interesting ways.  But this girl goes through so much crap, hopefully they don't make this character suffer even more for the second season but then again, I think her character has been pigeon-holed as the blacksheep of the cast and will be taken through tremendous ups and downs.

A character that I actually was impressed with was Jessica Stroup as Erin Silver.  From being a supportive character in the beginning, to getting involved in an interracial relationship and slowly we see her character receive significant storylines, she's become the breakthrough star of this series thus far.  She was absolutely phenomenal on the episode ""Off the Rails"".

As for our two main characters, Shenae Grimes as the chirpy Annie Wilson and the girl trying to fit in at West Beverly Hills High School.  Similar to Brenda Walsh in BH90210, she walks the beat of her own drum and constantly goes through many emotional situations with her boyfriend that she gets lost at times.  A teenager who seems out of place in high school but yet manages to be part of that ""cool"" group.  Needless to say, she's put through constant hell unlike Adrianna but it is quite evident with how the final season ended, her character is going to have to endure some major pain and I can see her going through a dark period.

As for Tristan Wilds, his character of Dixon Wilson is so far how he started out.  Dixon is quiet but good natured guy throughout the series.  He's been put through a variety of situations but so far aside from his relationship with Silver, his life has been a guy trying to fit into his family and surroundings as an African American male.  Of course, I can easily see his character as one that the writers will want to tool around with for season 2 and see how far this quiet athlete can be pushed.  We see in the finale that there is motivation for him to change but granted, I don't want to see Dixon reverting into a gangster nor a drug user.  He's too smart to go down that path and let's hope the writers at least retain some sort of that good boy image in season 2 but nor do I want to see a BH90210 David Silver 2.0.

AnnaLynne McCord as Naomi and Dustin Milligan as Ethan Ward are both my ""question marks"" of the show.  For Naomi,  as a troubled teenager who adores the attention that she gets from her fellow students, the popular diva is also going through some major mental situations but she's now becoming like a Marissa Cooper (ala ""The O.C."") that she's also spiraling downhill and she may think that because her popularity and her family has given her some sort of presence at her high school, I can easily see all of that being taken away.  But for now, she's the daddy's girl who has that hint of being more of a""bad girl"" and I'm sure she'll be meeting her breaking point quite soon.

As for Ethan, granted he's no Dylan McKay (of BH90210) but it seems that his character has gone through popular jock, popular boyfriend to Mr. Sensitivity that I really don't know where they will take his character.  Granted, he's done something that I wasn't expecting in the final episode of Season 1 but it'll be interesting to see what his character becomes in season 2.

And as for the adults of the show, it will be interesting to see how far the writers go with them.  ""90210' does a fine job of making the adult characters sexier and non-mannequin-ish.  But if a show like ""The O.C."" was successful in showcasing both adults and teenagers, ""90210' has done a good job.  Although, I often feel that Lori Loughlin's Debbie Wilson is being made to a mother like the Walsh's mother of BH90210.  Putting Harry and Debbie in sexual situations is not enough, hopefully there is more character development with the Wilson parents.

As a fan of the original series, I especially wonder how many more original cast members from ""Beverly Hills 90210' will appear on the show.  For season 1, it was great to see the tie-in with the original show with Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth) and Brenda Walsh (Shannon Doherty) as supportive characters but of course seeing Donna Martin (Tori Spelling) make an appearance was cool but hopefully we see more!  Let's see Brandon Walsh (Jason Priestely), Steve Sanders (Ian Zeiring), Dylan McKay (Luke Perry), David Silver (Brian Austin Green) or others make an appearance!  And yes, I want to see Andrea Zuckerman (Gabrielle Carteris) as well, since we got a glimpse of their child who now attends West Beverly High School.

As for the Season 1 DVD release, this is a pretty solid release with a good amount of special features.  Although, I wish there was more commentary included in this release, especially by the other cast members (Shenae, Tristan, AnnaLynne and Jessica where were you?) and perhaps even a gag reel or a glimpse of what to expect from season 2.  But overall, this is a solid DVD release and again, hopefully there is consideration of bringing this series to Blu-ray in the near future.

I really enjoyed ""90210 - THE FIRST SEASON"".  Retaining the dramatic flavor of the original but also retaining that soul of BH90210 that made it cool and giving it a more modern spin.  ""90210' is definitely cool and slick show and there are so many possibilities with the characters that I look forward to seeing how the series develops over time.

Fans of the original, fans of the current series or those who are curious but have never caught this ""90210', definitely check out ""90210 - THE FIRST SEASON"".  You'll definitely be hooked!",1250726400,17,21037,4.685620557681793
3590539,5,B001G0MFD8,"If your a fan of Gossip Girl or One Tree Hill, you'll love this! Sure it's not as great as Beverly Hills 90210, but it is still a really fun show. Ignore the negative reviews!",1250121600,2,175,4.0285714285714285
3590570,3,B001G0MFD8,"The Wilson family has moved from Kansas to Beverly Hills.  Father Harry (Rob Estes) has taken the job of principal at West Beverly High.  His wife Debbie (Lori Loughlin) is a photographer.  And his kids are now students at his high school.  Annie (Shenae Grimes) is thrilled about the transition since she wants to be an actress.  Dixon (Tristan Wilds) is a little less excited, mainly because he doesn't want to deal with explaining the obvious adoption all over again.

The kids quickly make new friends.  There's fellow actress Adrianna (Jessica Lowndes), popular girl Naomi (AnnaLynne McCord), jock Ethan (Dustin Milligan), quiet Navid (Michael Steger), and semi-Goth Silver (Jessica Stroup).  Together these friends will face questions of sex, drugs, pregnancy, and interpersonal trials.  Will they still be speaking tomorrow?

This season was very uneven.  Some of that was due to actors and writers finding the characters and feel of the show.  I was actually hooked quite quickly, partially thanks to the appearances of original series cast members Jennie Garth and Shannen Doherty.  In fact, Kelley's storyline is the main reason I tune in week after week.  See, as the story progressed, it became obvious the story was the most important thing.  Stuff that could have unfolded over several episodes was crammed into one.  Character still takes a back seat to story.  Part way through the season, it really lost its way.  But it did recover for the final few episodes, leading up to the best two hours of the series so far in the final episodes of the 24 episode season.

Be aware this show is very modern in its topics.  It is attempting to push the envelope even more than the original show did.  The show is designed for older teens and adults.

I must admit I will be tuning in when season two debuts, if only to find out how they resolve the cliffhanger.  I hope it does improve the storytelling and characters, however, or I may tire of it quickly.",1249948800,,1963,4.828828828828829
3590571,4,B001G0MFD8,"I AM getting it but i do have a few comments

a) someone had said something that not all of the original music would be present. If this proves to be so,I had assumed that when they license a tune for the show DVD rights would go with it.

b) Why isn't this title on Blu Ray? I get the CW in HD and some of the best photography happens during this show -shots of parts of LA for example.",1249862400,7,387,3.825

As far as i watched, the show was everything i like in shows. If you're a tough critic with shows i doubt you will like this series, but for teenagers like me, this show is amazing.

3590575,1,B001G0MFD8,"I may only be 16, but ive seen every episode of the original Beverly Hills 90210, which was without a doubt better than this, BY FAR. 90210 on the cw, was a dreadful disappointment. i love teen dramas and tv for that matter. i mean the two best tv shows in history in my opinon were/are The O.C. (But not on TV anymore) and One Tree Hill (Coming To It's 7th Season). those shows have good writing and are down to earth. 90210 was out-of-this-world and i don't think any teenager could relate to their lives in anyyway, unless you know a pregnant teenage girl, bi-polar teenage girl, and an orphaned guy all in the same social circle.. i mean, the show is so 'Fabulous' i don't even think kids with the fabulous life could relate. i was excited for this new show, because ive seen Beverly Hills 90210 and i play lacrosse (which it feautures BRIEFLY), but i was disappointed.. not only do they screw up their own storylines, but their pilot episode was so simular to Beverly Hills 90210 it was almost like the replicated it, but added terrible writing. the lighting is also terribly tooooooooooo bright. i can't even start to explain how terrible this show is. if you want to see real Dramas don't watch this. buy THE O.C. or watch ONE TREE HILL (7th season premiere Sept 14), or even watch GOSSIP GIRL(Which is a little better at least!!!!) JUST DON'T WATCH THIS STUPID SHOW!

oh, but i have to say, watch 'Reaper', same station, same night, it is a good show. so even though this show sucks, still watch Reaper, cuz it RULES!",1247702400,2,1525,4.465949820788531
3590576,1,B001G0MFD8,"The original 90210 was so awesome for myself and many other pre-teens/teenagers.

It would have been fabulous to 'step back' and see what the core gang from the high school years was now doing with themselves. And I was thrilled Shannen Doherty was returning as 'Brenda'. Having prayed about that, I was convinced a dream was at last coming true.

Until I saw the pilot for this series. Instead of the Walshes, we get some 'hip' retelling about another family named the Wilsons being the 'new family' in town. Annie and Dixon have to adjust to being the new kids at school.

It wasn't what I had grown up with, so why was it using the same series name? I felt violated, like a part of my memories were taken from me. I don't care about these people and their lives! I want to know what happened to the Walshes.

If the script writers were seriously trying to bring in 'African American teenagers, they should have easily remembered about the Ashes ('Ashes to Ashes') and then made either Robinson Ashe III or Sherice Ashe from season I of the original series these kid's parents. These characters were already tested, liked, and established in the storyline. No need to continue inventing 'new' characters.

And West Beverly High looks like a really cheap Saved By the Bell re-design. Sure schools undergo rennovation over time, but I find it hard to believe that this school would lack the money to continue looking good. You've really reached desperation when your school set looks tackier than Saved by the Bell! Where are my Wildcats?

Yes, Nat's still around. But instead of being the smart alecky owner of a resturant, he looks sad and forgotten. My heart practically broke on the scenes when he appeared and it's not because I am now an adult trying to make it in the world myself. I wanted to nominate Nat as the patron saint of good 90210 on TV. Then he'd wave a wand...etc and everything would be easily restored to how it should be. If only it could happen.

Considering the original series was so sucessful that the only things which it did not spawn were a cartoon and breakfast cereal, the comparative 'success' of this project is self-indicative of it's innate sub-quality. It's just a matter of time before the CW wakes up and pulls the plug on it's own failures.

At least Luke Perry and several other cast members had the courtesy to stay away from this steaming pile. They don't want their likeness associated with an inferior brand product.",1247270400,7,2460,4.652073732718894

But the Prom and after-Prom finale was an example of bad TV that can entertaining.

3590579,4,B001G0MFD8,"This show was destined to disappoint, it really was.  It had the pressure of a struggling network (the CW) doubling-down and gambling with it, and the challenge of appealing to 90210's original fan base and a new generation of viewers.  Under the direction of brilliant, but misguided Sachs and Judah, the show was okay, but struggled to find its footing early on, and was quite uneven.

It wasn't long before other people were brought in including Rebecca Rand Kirshner  who now essentially helms the show and future seasons.  It went from being almost a joke (a remake, with guest stars, really???  how original)  to being what I think is the best teen show on TV.  Unlike Gossip Girl, which had an awfully written and executed second season, this show didn't have to one-up itself.  Instead, it created very three-dimensional and accessible characters and gave them plot lines both insanely cheer-worthy, and seriously and properly melodramatic.

Shenae Grimes who plays ""Annie"" (who I still love) may have been the ""it"" girl when the show started, but by mid-season, Jessica Stroup (""Silver"") and Jessica Lowndes (""Adrianna"") took center-stage with plot lines that made (SPOILER AHEAD) teen preganancy and mental illness both entertaining and highly engaging, but amazingly it did so without ever becoming didactic (like say, ""the Secret Life of the American Teenager."")

This is a show that finally managed to be a guilty pleasure, a genuine drama, AND an all around perfect candidate for its demographic to watch...too bad by then many people had given up on it.  It reminds me in some ways of the critically acclaimed, popular ""Fringe"" from J.J. Abrams, it wasn't the leader out of the gate, but by mid-to-late season it was quite the show.

Do yourself a favor and give this show a chance, rent or buy it.  I can tell you in my own personal opinion, it is a show that all-in-all ranks with ""the O.C"" and maybe even ""My so-called Life"" in the spectrum of ""good"" (non-crappy) teen-centric shows.",1245542400,2,2001,4.916666666666667
