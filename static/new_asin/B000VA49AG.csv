2934227,1,B000VA49AG,"Paranoid much anyone? lol I'm a real witch & this kind of stuff just makes most of the witches & pagans I know laugh. Its only good for a laugh cause so much is construed wrong. It goes to the old saying only talk about what you know for a fact. lol The witches I know, including myself give our children the ""right"" to choose their Religion/spiritual path, not something christians do. I was christian but didn't like being forced to believe in things that came from people & not God. Plus the very vengeful God you have turns most kids off. To many christians tell there kids threats of you're gonna burn in hell if you don't do this or if you do that. Thats the reason alot are now turning away from christianity NOT witches influencing them. Influncing is left to the christians to do. No REAL witch or pagan will do that. lol The whole thing is rediculous & amusing. If you want the truth of something then ask a REAL witch or pagan so you know the truth.

Jeremiah Films is a noted creator and distributor of what only can be described as books and videos of religious bigotry.  This work, like others they have produced, is a mish-mash of ignorance-based mistakes, carefully-constructed half-truths, and outright lies, lies which the producers continue to spread even when the truth is brought to their direct attention.

2934232,1,B000VA49AG,"Unlike many of my predecessors here, I wouldn't necessarily rate this with a ""0"" star if it were available, as the production quality of this alleged ""documentary"" (sic) is of noteworthy caliber; however, this would be likening it to the production quality of the 9-11 ""documentary"" about to be aired, and this is as far as I would take it. Like the 9-11 ""documentary"", it is fictitious, sladerous and libelous - not only to those who actually follow the faith and practice of Wicca (or the religion of Witchcraft), but also to Rowling's artistry in the Harry Potter series. The difference between this and the 9-11 ""documentary"", though, is that the affiliates who produced the 9-11 ""documentary"" have admitted that a lot of the ""facts"" were made up for the purpose of entertainment and do not coincide with any actual factual evidence.

This piece of...fiction (I'm being nice and maintaining a family-oriented review here, though my personal thoughts would be rated PG-13, if not an outright R or stronger) serves no purpose other than to strengthen the feelings of paranoia regarding non-Christian religious philosophies - specifically those centered around the earth-based religions, such as Wicca, Asatru, Druidism, Native American Shamanic disciplines and so on - as those who are ""worshiping the devil"" (when none of these philosophies even believe in the existence thereof, nor follow anything that would be construed as ""evil"" but instead espouse the beliefs of causing no harm to others, nor even the land itself outward of the next 7 generations, and seek to understand the self and the soul in relation to the creator of all that is, was, and ever shall be).

The Middle-Eastern-derived philosophy of Christianity is one that focuses upon the teachings of Ioshua ben Joseph, or Yeshua, or Jesus, or whatever other names have been attributed to the Christ, or the anointed one of Nazareth, whom the religious philosophy of Christianity, based upon the teachings of Ioshua (Jesus) yet tempered primarily by the tenets of Paul of Tarsus, have been laid down into history proclaims to follow.

It has gone through many revisions, including that which the protestor against the sovereignty of the Roman Catholic holy see, Martin Luther, railed against and whose formation of the Protestant sect thereof (which follows almost exclusively the version of the Bible set into existence by James VI of Scotland, who was crowned King James I of England) has come into power within these past two decades, yet even these factions do not follow the precepts laid down by Luther, but espouse a more militant approach toward their own sovereignty as evidenced by the likes of James Dobson, Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell and Bob Larson, just to name but a few.

People such as William ""Bill"" Schnoebelen who have claimed to be everything from a high-ranking mason, a Mormon bishop and a ""baby-sacrificing Satanist"", to a Catholic Cardinal and a Wiccan High Priest (every last bit of which has been disproven through both biased *and* unbiased research into these allegations) continue to level claims of terror and evil-doings against those who practice non-Christian belief systems, specifically targeting those who identify themselves as ""Pagan"".

The aforementioned cults of personality buy into his (and other similar) claims whole-heartedly, without any form of inquiry into the legitimacy thereof, especially as it panders to their own position as the whole ""they're evil"", ""they're anti-Christian"", ""they're devil worshipers"", or ""they prey upon your children"" aspect of such claims draws unto them the blind followers - the simpletons or gullible patsies who do not have the foresight or common sense to do any form of research into such claims for themselves - or the otherwise convinced and/or brainwashed masses that they have already claimed through their messages of hatred and intolerance toward that which is different than their own beliefs.

Thus, we are left with tyrannical dictatorial bigotry toward a sect of people who are ""outside"" of the professed ""norm"" of what is taught to be the ""chosen of God"".

This is what this video espouses. Sheer, unadulterated bigotry and prejudism.

It focuses upon alleged ""Biblical"" priciple in discerning what is, and is not, ""Christian"" based upon one person's interpretation of otherwise obscure passages of only one version of the Bible, the King James version, without any formal research into whether or not such beliefs may be understood and/or admonished against within other versions of this holy doctrine, and what's more...against a work of entertainment fiction.

It then attempts to link such works of fiction to the factual accounts of those who follow non-Christian religious philosophies and again backs up such assertions with obscure King James Version segments, even flat-out taking certain passages out of context so as to ""prove"" alleged truth.

Yet even Paul of Tarsus proclaimed the faith and righteousness of a Pagan over those who followed the Middle-Eastern-derived faiths in his speech on the steps of the Aeropagus...where is this comparison in this so-called ""documentary""?

No, this work of sheer fiction is nothing more than an indoctrinational propaganda piece produced for the sole purpose of teaching paranoia, fear of different philosophies, and outright bigotry. In my personal view, it should be categorized into the same topic as indoctrination pieces for the Ku Klux Klan, the Neo-Nazis and the Skinheads as these three organizations are violently opposed to any who are not Caucasian, male (primarily), heterosexual, Protestant Christians (or, rather, the ""independent"" offshoots thereof) which is, indeed, the core of what this ""documentary"" is espousing.",1157760000,,5747,5.269945355191257
2934233,1,B000VA49AG,"All this video talks about is how Harry Potter is evil and how it will change your kids into wizards or witchs! This video accuses Wiccans, Pagans, Neo-Pagans, Occultists, Witchs, Magicians of all worshiping the devil! When they don't realy know anything about that Metaphysics! Many religions that include magic in their beliefs are much older religions then Christianity, Islam and Judaism! Religions that where made before the belief in any Devil! This video tells christian parents to not let their kids read harry potter or watch any of the harry potter movies because they say it will lead them to the devil and they will go to hell! Forsing your children to be afraid or not to believe in somthing is just as Awful as a movie or book that kids read that will lead to what some call spiritual enlightanment! But isn't that the same thing the bible does? Or christian chanels and tv shows? or movies like the passion (with blood, death, torture, and over-exageration)? But in the end its the kids who deside! even if their parents don't let them believe in that at a young age, when they grow up they will choose what they want to believe or do with their lifes! Parents can not control their kids forever! So don't watch this movie, it will only fill your head with fauls information and accusations!",1151625600,,1306,4.658008658008658

It crazies like this who will push people away from organized religion. Of course, I'm sure they think anyone who didn't like their video needs 'saved.'

If you are at all worried about these books may I suggest two very interesting tomes by Christian author Connie Neal - ""What's A Christian to do With Harry Potter?"" & ""The Gospel According to Harry Potter."" Both fascinating reads! You can read them while you're waiting for the next HP book to come out! :-)

This is an incredibly inaccurate, fear mongering video that not only lies about what Wicca is but does a disservice to the Harry Potter series as well. It is garbage like this that the Christian community swallows without question that does far more harm to Christianity than any enemy of the religion could ever do.  The one thing I find interesting is that while Matrisciana is criticizing Harry Potter for ""propaganda"", this his her propaganda and she is profiting from this almost as much as Rowling is. The ironic thing is that she is making a living,however dishonest, by leeching onto Rowlings creation. Her fellow Christians should be ashamed of stuff like this.",1124755200,,739,4.728682170542636

Secondly, Isn't Jesus teaching us to respect each other. Hasn't Lilly Potter died to save her son , just like Jesus died on the cross to save us. These books are not evil, they teach is the values of love, friendship and hope.

2934243,1,B000VA49AG,"I don't usually write reviews, but I recently saw this video while visiting family.  As someone who considers herself a Christian AND a Harry Potter fan I was absolutely appalled.  There is much that has already been said, but what I noticed is that it appears that those discussing HP didn't closely read the books.  They often mispronounced names ""Voldemore"" ""Diaganon Alley"" instead of Voldemort and Diagon Alley.  I know that this is nitpicky, but if you are going to make a video bashing something because of its beliefs, you better make darn sure your facts are absolutely on target.

Oh yeah, and to Christians out there who love this video, what about CS Lewis's use of the concept of witchcraft and magic in the Chronicles of Narnia.  I didn't see any videos related to that.  The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe has violence, and bloodshed, and the famous White Witch.  Aslan, the lion who represents Jesus, talks about the ""deeper magic from the dawn of time"" as a reson that he is able to rise from the dead.  That sounds pretty demonic to me.

2934244,1,B000VA49AG,"Why is that anytime ""some"" Christans see the words, magic or anything of that subject they say DEVIL!  Whatever.  Lets not force our beliefs on anyone or put other people down for what they believe.  HP is an awesome series that does not teach children to become witches or to harm people or do bad things.  HP books a about trust, friendship, personal growth, and learning to do the right thing.  It is fiction.  It is fantasy.  Just because it uses magic and wizards and such as that as themes or settings does not mean that it is bad.  Are all stories, movies, plays, poems, etc that talk about witches and magic bad?  Are all fariy tales and fantasy stories evil or demonic?  If you feel that way...wake up! Don't be so weak minded and please don't push those beliefs on to your children.  If you are unsure of what your children are reading, read the book yourself.  Try to put aside closemindedness and your own idelized notions and see the real messages in the books.  Do not just take other peoples words that something is bad or good, try it yourself and then deside.  So many christans are closeminded or perhaps afraid that anything that their preached says is bad surely must be.  What crap!  I was raised christan but I'm not one myself nor do I judge anyone or their postive beliefs.  However, there is a line to be drawn.  Do you guys really think that the author or HP books is evil?  Do you know anything about her and why she wrote these books?  You should be proud of your child for reading.  HP books have gotten many kids loving to read that otherwise would not be and that is a great thing.  If you do not want your children reading those books, fine but do not think that your beliefs are truth for everyone.  If your kid reads HP and talks about wanting to be a wizard are they just playing along with the fanatsy of the stories?  Is this evil?  Is it like little boys who play cops and robbers?  Does that mean that if your son plays cowboys and indians that he really wants to be a cowboy?  Is this type of play evil? Look at it like that.  If you child is serious about wanting to learn witchcraft and that is something that you do not beleive in, explain your beliefs and say that HP is make believe and that you can not watch a movie or read a book and choose your spritual path. Ok...that reminds me.  Nothing in HP is about spirituality so there is no God vs. Devil in there like i have hear some people try to say.  Yes there are good people trying to come out on top of bad people but is that evil or does that teach our chidren the importance of being strong and doing good.  There are no hidden messeages.  Anyone can read what they want into something but that doesn't make it truth.  Lets not look down on or judge other people and lets try to all be secure in our own beleifs and not try to act better or untight and Godly.

2934245,1,B000VA49AG,"Harry Potter is fiction.  Fiction means, not true, made up, meaning, not real.  Magic is NOT real.  If you believe that magic is real, then it means your faith in it is stronger than it is in Christianity.  If you are so worried that these books are going to lure you to evil, then you are a very poor and weak christian.  I have read all the books, yet I still MAKE time for my bible reading.  I have watched all the movies and am anticipating the release of the third instllment, yet, I still MAKE time for church.  I am comfortable in indulging my imagination in these books because I BELIEVE in God and am a strong Christian.  Do you believe in the Force?  Of course not.  That is what makes Star Wars entertaining.  It is NOT real.
People talk about children being influenced by Harry Potter.  The HP books are, in my opinion, adult reading.  Children under the age of 13 should not be reading these books regardless.  Even still, so your child reads a Harry Potter book, and wants to be a witch.  That means you, as a Christian, have not fulfilled your spiritual obligation to teach your child about God.  You have also not taught your children to understand where fantasy leaves off and where reality begins.  Teach your children that God is real, and magic is not.  Then, they can expand their imagination by reading books(meaning fantasy), and through you, learning the word of God (meaning reality).  It is up to YOU.  Not this video which condemns things that are not even real.  If you need a video to help you do this, then you do not put much faith in your church.  This video is not a house of God.  Your church is.  Start there.",1081382400,,1644,4.385382059800665

The Harry Potter books are fantasy; they describe a non-existent imaginary world of unicorns, candles floating in the air, flying broomsticks, curses, automobiles that fly through the air, cloaks of invisibility, pictures that move and talk, etc. None of this is related to Wicca.

The author came out of the New Age movement and other forms of mysticism so she knows what she is talking about. She is very knowledgable and an expert about the occult and the deception of Harry Potter. I highy recommend her newest resource: Wide Is The Gate,1313712000,,341,4.516129032258065
8217731,1,B000VA49AG,"Q: What does popular juvenile fantasy series ""Harry Potter"" have to do with Witchcraft?

A: Absolutely nothing.

While the writers/directors *are* correct that ""Young readers today, more than any other time in history, have an abundance of occult resources easily available to them"" these rescources have mostly to do with harmless Neo-Pagan Wicca books like ""Teen Witch"" ""To Ride A Silver Broomstick"" or ""To Stir A Magic Cauldron."" The ""Harry Potter"" series has about as much to do with *actual* occult practices as the old ""Dungeons & Dragons"" game: that is to say, NONE. Fantasy giants, magic wands, unicorns, dragons, and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are wonderful fantasies for children, and great stuff for Hollywood Movies, but that is all they are. ""Real"" Witches are nothing like the characters in these books and the abundant majority of occult rescources put forward by publishers such as Llewellyn are less dangerous than a book of matches. The writers/producers of this video are woefully ignorant of what a real Witch does, or the difference between a Witch and a Wiccan, or a Wiccan and a Ceremonial Magician, or of the Left Hand Path vs. the Right Hand Path. Many Solomonic and Goetic Magicians are actually Christians and Jews. Not ""Pagan"" at all, and certainly not ""evil."" The idiotically simplistic thought processess that link ""Occult"" with ""Evil"" with ""Satan"" are exactly the same sort of moronic Fundamentalism that caused the Witch Hysteria of the 17th Century, and the ""Satanic Panic"" of the l980's and 90's.",1265932800,,1546,5.106719367588933
8217732,5,B000VA49AG,"This DVD is for anyone who is concerned that the Harry Potter books and movies might be dangerous for their kids. It's narrated by a former witch, so the information presented has more merit than it otherwise would. The video points out that Wicca, the religion of witchcraft, is a recognized religion that receives tax-exempt status in the U.S., and that Wiccan religious practices are present in the Harry Potter books. Some actual Wiccan practices that appear in the books include spell-casting, the drinking of blood, possession, and the manipulation of circumstances and objects with the mind. There is footage of actual Wiccan rituals, and several actual witches are interviewed. The DVD also points out other movies and TV shows that contain occultic material. ""Harry Potter: Witchcraft Repackaged"" was extremely helpful to me as I wrote ""Jaime"", the second book in my fantasy book series, as it deals with witchcraft and the occult.",1265500800,,940,5.150326797385621
8217733,5,B000VA49AG,"This DVD exposes the Harry Potter series occult nature and dark side. The Judeo-Christian God of the Bible, in Deuteronomy 18: 9 -14 says, ""There shall not be one found among you who practices witchcraft, or interprets omens, or a sorcerer, or one who conjures spells or a medium, or a spiritist, or one who calls up the dead."" For all who do these things are an abomination to the LORD....."" This DVD is presenting biblical truth from a Christian worldview. The DVD was produced for Christians in order for them to be enlightened about the true nature of the Harry Potter series so they are not taken captive by the devil (2 Timothy 2:26).",1249776000,,640,4.573913043478261
8217734,1,B000VA49AG,"How dare people think for themselves?
How dare books these days encourage people to pursue their own spirituality without being indoctrinated?
How dare people become responsible for their own morality and actions without blaming some exterior supernatural force?

One of the problems I have with the Christian right these days is they pretty much tell people to stop thinking, to surrender their doubts and just do what they're told. And that is pretty much what this documentary is asking people to do. And given that, it would have already been a bad film (I refuse to label this fictional work a documentary) if it didn't have as many holes in it that I could poke a besom through.

As usual, fundamentalists have made a point of view based on flawed logic and total inaccuracy. Man of the things in this film are simply untrue, even to the extent of when they are talking about the swasktika, which any Nazi historian will tell you was based on an Busdhist symbol and NOT lightning.

But the worst, by far, has to be that idiot of a woman who calls herself an expert on world religions, Caryl Matrisciana. Has she even READ the books? Does she even know ANYHTING about them or about witchcraft for that matter? She claims to have been part of the new age movement but she is little more than what we call a ""whitelighter"", people who dabble just out of their own ego in order to get what they want.
Don't waste your time on this, rather than a zero I wanted to rate this in negative numbers.",1223683200,,1495,4.529629629629629
