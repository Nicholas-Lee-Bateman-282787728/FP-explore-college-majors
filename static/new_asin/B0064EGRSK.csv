8492509,5,B0064EGRSK,"This is like spending time at a retreat. Between the rich visuals and vibrant music, you are transported to a very serene and meditative place. There is a nice, unhurried pace to the visuals and the music that is truly relaxing. There is a nice juxtaposition of deep greens in the water and the ward reds and oranges of the fall foliage. As a bonus feature, you can turn off the music soundtrack and just listen to nature sounds on the alternate soundtrack or just play your own music over it. All of these are very pleasing.",1321833600,10,525,4.422680412371134
