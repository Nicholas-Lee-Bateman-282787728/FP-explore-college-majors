8308672,3,B001HCQVUI,It is a well made movie worth watching I would not buy the DVD but its worth the price to watch.,1388275200,,96,3.619047619047619
8308673,3,B001HCQVUI,"Originally titled ""Mortuary 2.""

The film starts out rather amusing in a campy sort of way. We are introduced to young Casey and his sister Tina (Heather Hartmann). Tina and her gf Sky (Michelle Bellaver) have two stoner boyfriends. They opt to break into a Mortuary occupied by Henry Parks (Leon Acord), a man who the police was warned about by another weirdo. Meanwhile the town is upset by the number of disappearances.

As far as a slasher film, it doesn't make it. It works better as a campy film, which appears to be the intent, by the humor wanes and so does the film. Worth watching as part of a 30 Horror Film Collection.  Made in 2005, you would swear in was closer to 1985.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, no sex. Nudity (Jennifer Arter, Barbara Cali- full frontal)",1387238400,,769,4.550724637681159
8308674,1,B001HCQVUI,"Sorry, way too slow/boring to keep me interested. Acting is mediocre at best and I could really do without the ""acid trip-like"" flashes that do more to confuse that help the story.",1374624000,2,180,4.65625
8308675,2,B001HCQVUI,"Just another low budget slasher film, there is some decent actors that help carry the film but each and every moment is totally predictable. Naked girl in shower (Nice full frontal) of course she's going to die. Short cut through woods, no good can ever come from that. The flash backs are a bit annoying and the sound is badly regulated, background noise overwhelms the dialog most of the time.
If you're just looking for a B-Rated slasher film, this one's for you and there is enough T&A to keep the guys interested.",1360540800,,518,4.580645161290323
8308676,3,B001HCQVUI,"ok- NOT A GREAT MOVIE- MOVIE QUALITY REMINDED ME OF A 60'S HOME MOVIE.

But this movie has everything, drugs & rock & roll, a place called Bubas Diner, a black cat, flashbacks & female nudity- oh yeah and a demented murderer.

Nothing outrageously new or different- but was entertaining and pretty darn good acting for what was obviously a low budget film.",1342051200,2,356,4.634920634920635
8308677,1,B001HCQVUI,Wow this is an extremely low budget movie with bad acting.  Just another slasher movie with typical plots.  I mean how many times has this type of movie been made with young teenagers drinking and doing drugs with a maniac killer after them.  Don't waste your time.,1300406400,4,265,4.595744680851064
8308678,4,B001HCQVUI,This teen chiller is what Indie films are all about.  Who needs Hollywood to scare the &^%$ out of you?  The acting and editing is superb.  A great late-night popcorn flick...with your arms around your lover.  I truly enjoyed this...and I'm a horror/thriller fantatic.  It takes a lot to get 4 stars out of me. I tip my glass of Chardonnay to actress Heather Hartmann...a true man's woman.,1264032000,3,389,4.661764705882353
