6191688,4,B00HNTOT4E,It is the tv specials that I remember.  The extras consist of home movies shown without sound that would have been enjoyable if the Four King Cousins (who are still performing) provided narration.,1416528000,,196,4.9393939393939394
6191689,5,B00HNTOT4E,My entire family watches this.  It's fun to show them when people actually had talent and didn't scream and have inappropriate lyrics and dance moves. I remember watching The King Family growing up.  GOOD CLEAN FAMILY FUN!,1411084800,2,222,4.972972972972973

6191695,5,B00HNTOT4E,"This is a wonderful bit of memory making for me and
my daughters love watching it as much as I do.
It is a Collection, Volume 1 of a selection of the
KING FAMILY TV show that was on in the late 60's
and early 70's.  It is good, clean, talented entertainment
for all of the family.  A nice video to enjoy for different
holidays and times.",1400457600,3,337,4.014925373134329
6191696,5,B00HNTOT4E,"The King Family like the Lawerence Welk Show were considered family fare back in the day. Long before the creation of what was called ""The Family Hour"", these shows are great examples of television that no longer exists. They showcased the great music of great composers of the time. This generation is missing this. That is why so many of them feel lost and angry. Parents must work to provide all the technology their children need to compete in today's world. I enjoyed all members of this family, but my favorite was always Tina Cole of the Four King Cousins. Tina went on to star in My Three Sons, during its final seasons. Tina, appeared at the Paley Center for Media in LA. Wish I could have been there. I think after viewing this DVD set, you will agree, wish we had more entertainment like this available on cable TV instead of making stars out of people with little talent and nothing to say we need to see and hear.",1398556800,4,926,4.452941176470588
6191697,5,B00HNTOT4E,"I was not even born when these specials were first out but after checking out these shows on You Tube,and buying the Christmas Special I can see why the King Family holds a special place in so many peoples hearts.there is no political wavering on any ones part just pure entertainment from start to finish. I think a special feeling occurs in people who watch these specials because it brings back so many memories for people who watch them of when they were young on holidays and all there relatives would come over and everyone would have a great time. Those days seem to be all but gone.family unity is far a thing of the past,parents who once taught there children right from wrong now are just mothers and fathers who don't care what there kinds do. Its sad that America has come so far but fallen even more behind in the last 40 years..can anyone remember when your family all go together on the Holidays well it might not happen in real life today but you can relive those great times through these dvd's .The king family did a great job on the Christmas Special and i hope they take the same care in producing these specials on dvd.
I also hope the king family will continue to put out more sets and do one or two alone on just the Christmas Specials.i think by the great response to this release you can see people are wanting this kind of Family Values again. Take those cellphones off the kids and get theme talking to each other again the normal way,instead of sitting in front of the TV get out and do things together....The King Family  was a Real Special thing that happened,buy these and see for yourself.",1395446400,9,1621,4.439597315436242
