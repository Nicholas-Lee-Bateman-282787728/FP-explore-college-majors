8476547,4,B005K8RJ6K,"being a huge fan of Chiba I was thrilled to find this set for cheap. After all it's ten movies for less than ten dollars. Also part of the reason for this review is to provide some info as to what is actually on this set. It's true that you can get most of these movies elsewhere in better quality, but for an introductory package this can't be beat. Unfortunately all of these movies are dubbed, at this time to my knowledge only 4 of these movies have  been released in their original language on legitimate region one DVD's.

 But the real draw for me was the widescreen copies of the Streetfighter trilogy. It's important to note that these are labeled as ""4:3 Letterboxed"" and the suggest that you use zoom feature on your DVD player for full 16X9 presentation. So make your decision with this in mind.

 As for the movies themselves, you will be in for a good time if you are either a fan of Chiba, know what you are getting yourselves into or you just like Karate movies.

The Street Fighter trilogy is a fun blast to watch with favorite being ""Last Revenge""

Sister Street Fighter has the awesomeness of Sue (Utsuko) Shihomi in the lead, Chiba takes a supporting role in this vehicle for his protege.

The Bodyguard (Viva Chiba! The Bodyguard) is one of my favorite Chiba films, but the US version here tacks on an unnecessary prologue  featuring two American martial artists discussing how tough Chiba is. But aside from that it's a fun ride all the way through.

Legend of the Eight Samurai: This is really more of Hiroyuki Sanada (Rush Hour 3, The Wolverine) feature with Chiba again in a supporting role. Chiba doesn't even show up for the first 20 minutes or so. But this is a fun fantasy film that has many ludicrous moments within.

Samurai Reincarnation is a full fledged Chiba vehicle with him facing the hordes of hell, I enjoyed what little I saw of it but my copy was flawed and wouldn't let me get past the 30 minute mark.

Shogun's Ninja has Chiba in a supporting role as a bad guy after the good guy Hiroyuki Sanada.

Dragon Princess stars Etsuko Shihomi in revenge mode seeking those responsible her father's (Chiba) eventual death. Etsuko as always is good in role and a delight to watch

Karate Warriors is the final movie in the set and is a good one despite it's now familiar tale of one man (Chiba) pitting two gangs against each other to clean up the town (Shades of Yojimbo or for some A Fistful of Dollars).

As mentioned before a few of these movies have been  released with their original audio track intact.

8476548,1,B005K8RJ6K,"These DVD's were ordered last month but never arrived. I had to inquire with Amazon.com and they re-ordered the DVD's on their ""Behalf"" even though I paid for the DVD's and did not recieve anything for the delay and/or just not fulfilling a order.

Once re-ordered last week, they arrived today, only to have a piece shaking around in the packaging. Upon opening the packaging, the return slip was there, with the the return ""without"" opening. So I opened it and low/behold one of the pieces that hold the disc in place was broken and essentially made multipul scratchs in a circular motion on one of the disc's

I refuse to test it on of my machines only to break that.

Terrible service this time Amazon.com, never had a problem before but this is just terrible service!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have another DVD coming, hope its not in the same condition!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1364256000,,862,4.76510067114094
