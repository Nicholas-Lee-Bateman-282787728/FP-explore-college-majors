8479120,5,B00318D7CQ,"I loved this video. It really gave me a sense of what Morocco is from an tourist's point of view. I like the detail in the still shots. I was not looking for a marketing video, just another person's viewpoint on what they liked - that's what this video told me.",1355702400,,261,4.137254901960785
8479121,1,B00318D7CQ,"My fiancee and I will be traveling to Morocco for our honeymoon in October, so we were excited to check out what was advertised as a ""documentary"" about various cities in the country. Much to our dismay, what we purchased was a 45 minute slideshow of someone's trip to Morocco that looks like a poorly made PowerPoint presentation. There is no narration, just some text that is very small and difficult to read. Needless to say, we did not watch the entire thing and felt that even though we only lost $1.99, it was a waste of money. The description needs to be updated to state that it is simply a slideshow, otherwise potential viewers like me will likely be disappointed.",1336780800,,674,4.578512396694215
8479122,4,B00318D7CQ,"Maybe the previous reviewer did not have the detailed description of this DVD available - it is a multimedia(photo and video) show which covers areas that are not described in typical tourist brochures.  So if you are looking for scenes of Morocco off the beaten path, this does a good job of it.",1336435200,,296,4.584905660377358
8479123,1,B00318D7CQ,"This isn't really a video, just a mediocre photo slide set to music, lingering on each picture way too long, with no narration.",1329523200,,127,4.565217391304348
