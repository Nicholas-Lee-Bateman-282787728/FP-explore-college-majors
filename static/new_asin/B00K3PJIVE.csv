8655723,5,B00K3PJIVE,"There's really nothing I can say about Cat's Eye other than if you like old school animes, you'll probably like Cat's Eye. You'll probably also like it if you like City Hunter. The editorial reviews basically states all you need to know about this series. It's not a serious anime and the first season is more about Cat's Eye stealing paintings and artworks created by their father. The second season is a little less serious, than the first, and focuses more on Hitomi and Toshio's relationship. So, if you don't mind an old school anime that doesn't take itself too seriously then you'll probably like this. My suggestion is to watch a couple of episodes online to see if you'll like it. Oh, rightstuf has a nice artbox that comes with the first season, while supplies last. Picture quality is very good considering how old this series is. Extras included are clean opening and closing along with trailers so just the bare minimum.",1403481600,11,933,4.730061349693251
