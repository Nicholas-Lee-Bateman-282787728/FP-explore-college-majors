4488014,3,B004WOAGGI,"Short attention span summary:

1. `80s cupcake Lea Thompson makes tiny cupcakes in a small town

2. `80s rebel Judd Nelson plays her police officer husband.

3. Conned into entering the mayoral race, the cookie crumbles when the incumbent mayor bites off more than he can chew.

4. It doesn't take a college degree to see that there's something rotten in the state of the town.

5.  Predictable movie follows.

Sure, it's sweet and all, but the bad guys are clich&eacute;d, and unfortunately so is much of the storyline. Those old enough to have seen The Breakfast Club will get a chuckle out of Judd Nelson jamming to a familiar tune, but other than memorable music and a few cameos, there isn't much more here.

Recommended rental for purposes of nostalgia.

4488038,4,B004WOAGGI,"I have been enjoying this show with my daughter because others said this is family friends, but I WARN you...there is a part where the husband walks out while his wife is working on her papers, and has just thanked him for the sign he made, but then he says ""You're welcome. You wanna have sex?"" SERIOUSLY!!  THAT made me soooo mad! There are words like, ""slow your ass down"" (and damn and hell...though I don't have so much a problem with that.) You should know this. This is a cute show so far, we are still watching it, but don't be thrown for a loop if you hear some things as I've mentioned, or see a bit of cleavage on one of her teenage daughters! I keep strict christian values. Some of you may feel like I do",1484611200,3,717,4.158273381294964

4488045,2,B004WOAGGI,"debt and the previous mayor(now dead) and town council members (2 local business owners who are cartoonish is their bad-guyness) have been fleecing the town for their own profit. Our hero has little education-- which the bad guys point out in such a rude and condescending way, that you over look the fact that not having high school diploma is actually a bit of disability. But it is no matter -because here all problems are easily solved. Just sell off all the infrastructure- (who needs police cars or garbage trucks)- and pay off the towns loans. Viola!! All finanicial problems are solved- the town is saved. At the end of the movie- suddenly for no reason whatsoever- there is money to start buying newer and better infrastructure. Did you know that if you stop ticketing out of towners for speeding through town they will be so grateful that they will stop and spend money ? Real life note: I drive through similar DE towns like this all the time. Everyone knows that you need to slow down when passing through DE towns because tickets are a big source of income for these towns. So I slow down- I never get a ticket. Added bonus: I have never struck a townsperson with my car. Also, I have never stopped in the towns to spend money. Okay so I admit it, part of the reason that I am rating this so low is because I disagree so strongly with the message. This is a pro-tea party movie for sure. Mayor Cupcake is Sarah Palin without the mean. This movie kind of outlines the naive - everything is really so simple to fix- please stop confusing me with real life facts thinking. Putting politics aside, the movie is fine for me- in a fluffy lifetime movie sort of way. It keeps my attention, but it is a little tepid. It is the time of movie I like to watch while I'm folding laundry or cleaning the kitchen.",1481414400,,1812,4.42814371257485

4488061,4,B004WOAGGI,"A sweet, simple story about an everyday Mom who accidentally becomes mayor of a small town that is bogged down by corruption in city government.  She slowly learns of preveious corruptions and fires those involved while making practical changes to repair the damage and pay off the town's deb, but not without some trouble along the way.  It's a fun movie because it's the type of government reform that most people wish they could do, given the chance.  It is a film highlighting the simple things in life- the value of family, ""sticking together"", friendship, good overcoming evil and a community coming together.  A sweet story that leaves you smiling.",1473811200,2,655,4.927272727272728

4488230,4,B004WOAGGI,"You have to admit it's a catchy movie title. So, blame one of Mary Maroni's three teen daughters: Lana, she's the daughter infatuated with politics, the one who secretly places her mom's name on the ballot for the mayoral candidacy. So, this and that happens, and now guess what? Mary Maroni (Lea Thompson) - high school dropout, busy housewife, and the local diner's cupcake chef - ends up nabbing the post on a technicality and on the strength of 32 votes. Can Bridgeville, Delaware's accidental mayor find a way to revitalize a dying town what's mired in crippling debt?

There's an old school, feel-good Capra-esque vibe to this movie that grabbed me. Here's an ordinary person who's plucked out of her mundane life and is put in an unexpected situation and who, because she's got gumption and a sort of homespun wisdom, somehow manages to overcome all obstacles. I don't know that we even needed the extra oomph of the old political guard conspiring against her. It was interesting enough watching Mary Maroni try to dig Bridgeville out of its deep, deep hole. Her methodology is unorthodox and unpopular. She conducts her mayoral duties in the bakery she works in, which is cozy and cute. Except there's actually a really poignant story behind her refusal to darken the threshold of city hall.

But here's what's really got the townspeople in an uproar: To lower the town's debt, Mary Maroni effects sweeping changes. She sells three police cruisers. She turns out street light and cancels trash pickup. She reduces city employees' pay by 25%. You'd think the scenes of her conducting those town hall meetings would be better attended, what with the citizens riled up to an almighty gripe. But this is a tiny cable film, and the lack of show has probably more to do with modest budgeting than anything else. But, yeah, it could've done with more extras to pad the seething audience.

Meanwhile, it's no surprise that, as Mary gets more steeped into her mayoral stuff, it begins to distract her from her home life and from her baking quality cupcakes. I'm surprised Judd Nelson's count doesn't go all the way down to 0bama. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

MAYOR CUPCAKE is a bit of a vanity project for writer/director Alex Pires whose mother, Mary C. Pires, inspired the character of Mary Maroni and also for Lea Thompson whose two real-life teenaged daughters, Madelyn and Zoey Deutch, play two of her screen daughters, rocker Anita and civic-minded Lana, respectively. Mary's third daughter, tomboy Tanya, who aspires to be the first female NFL player, is played by Lexy Rutt. All three girls are good.

Enjoy this for the pleasant, whimsical parable it is rather than for the incisive political allegory that it isn't. If you like small town values, this movie's your huckleberry. In a swerve, the guys are on the sidelines and the ladyfolk do the heavy lifting. Still, credit Dorian Harewood and Frankie Faison for how solid they are and how wise they seem as Mary's advisors. The last I saw Judd Nelson in a movie, it was in KRISTIN'S CHRISTMAS PAST, and while that was a good film, Judd basically just grunted his way thru it. Here, he's given more to do, and I like the quirk he exhibits. He plays Mary's understanding husband, the town sheriff, and he sports a mustache and whenever he's about to lose it, he starts naming U.S. Presidents (in chronological order) to calm himself down. But this being Judd Nelson, it doesn't always work. And I'm thinking, for fans of Judd's most iconic film, THE BREAKFAST CLUB, it's an inspired moment when his rocker kid, during her rock band gig, sings ""Don't You (Forget About Me)."" That took me back to when John Hughes ruled the roost. And, also, Simple Minds could probably use the residuals. Anyway, I wouldn't mind if Mayor Cupcake is up for reelection, and, by that, I, of course, mean a sequel.",1423180800,,3855,4.773613193403298

4488244,5,B004WOAGGI,"""Mayor Cupcake"" is a genuinely refreshing movie.  In an era of copycat films, this film stands apart.  I give this film an extra star for originality, and a unique view.

Happily, this film does not have violence copied from the films of Quentin Tarantino.  Nor does it contain vampires from the Twilight films.  Nor does it have nude bedroom scenes.

What this film does have is a subtly understated response to political corruption in small town America.  Bridgeville is an actual town in the state of Delaware, and it really does have an Apple Scrapple Festival and a World Championship Punkin Chunkin.  But Bridgeville, in this story, also has an enormous deficit caused by excessively greedy and corrupt town officials.

An unusual set of circumstances puts Mary Maroni (Lea Thompson) into the position of Mayor Cupcake.  Mary is a ""cupcake maker,"" but the title Mayor Cupcake gives a misleading impression of a soft approach to the town's problems.  What transpires is anything but soft. And with the help of and creative input from dozens of previously ignored and downtrodden citizens, the possibility of solving the town's fiscal problem transforms from a dream into a working plan.

The acting is marvelous by Lea Thompson, Judd Nelson, Maddie Deutch, Zoey Deutch, and the rest of the cast.  Excellent casting in this film makes even the smallest roles memorable.

""Mayor Cupcake"" is a film that the entire family can--and should--see together.  Lots of little touches add up to a very entertaining, heartwarming and uplifting film.",1313884800,15,1542,5.063492063492063
