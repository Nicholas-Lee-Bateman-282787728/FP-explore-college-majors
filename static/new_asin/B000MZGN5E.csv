8173784,5,B000MZGN5E,"I was pleasantly surprised after viewing these DVDs. I purchased them for historical information, not entertainment. They gave me a better understanding of what happened when Bertie rose to the throne. The video clips are very informative. The acting portion is believable -- not excellent -- but certainly believable. I really enjoy watching all of these DVDs because I find the royals interesting.",1296950400,,399,5.349206349206349

8173786,5,B000MZGN5E,This is probably my favortie series in all my Royal DVD collection. Its has such a wealth of information about the British Royal family dating back generations. it also comes with a very sweet film depicting the life and romance of Birtie and Elizabeth. The acting is a bit cheezy but oh well its still a sweet story. I highly recommend this item if your a Royal watcher like me! :-),1275004800,7,383,4.408450704225352
8173787,5,B000MZGN5E,"In this set the fortunate viewer receives two fine recent video productions on the British Royal Family.  The Windsors is a four part series originally shown in the US in 1994.  It examines the history of the House of Windsor from King George V through Elizabeth II.  Its an excellent documentary which uses many original photos and newsreel film and includes interviews with historians, courtiers, and a few royal relations like Lady May Abel Smith, Lady Pamela Hicks, and the Countess Mountbatten of Burma.  The last episode was extensively revised for The Queen's Golden Jubilee in 2002, and includes material on the deaths of The Princess of Wales and The Queen Mother, the marriage problems of The Queen's children, and the growing up of Prince William of Wales.

Bertie and Elizabeth is a dramatization of the life of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth (The Queen Mother after her husband's death).  It tends to be a little too romantic in places, but it does give a pretty good idea of the Royal Family's daily life in the 1930s and 1940s and of some the issues King George VI faced dealing with the aftermath of his brother's abdication, then World War II and the post-war period.",1250208000,10,1188,4.770731707317073
