8170132,5,B000MMMT8M,"I remembered this movie from my childhood 30 years ago. This movie saved my life, in that watching it, made me realize that what I had been living for the last 3 years was in fact abuse. It was then after watching this movie I started fighting back against my abuser.",1451606400,,267,4.254901960784314

8170134,5,B000MMMT8M,Pam Dawber is excellent in this movie. It's about protecting your children and she tried very hard to be a good Mom. Loved the movie.,1398902400,,133,4.36
8170135,5,B000MMMT8M,"I ordered this movie as I work with abused children. While many people do not want to believe that this type of abuse exists, it does. The movie was well acted and I am glad to add it to my collection.",1368230400,,201,3.926829268292683
8170136,5,B000MMMT8M,"This was an excellent movie and has some good lessons in it. You had to follow it closly but the writer did a good job. As for the company I would do business with them again, they did a good job in shipping it on time.",1334534400,,219,3.782608695652174
8170137,3,B000MMMT8M,I saw part of it on TV and wanted to watch the whole thing. Parts of it are interesting but some is really not believable and just inaccurate. If you like Lifetime movies I'm sure you'll enjoy this.,1294012800,,198,4.2368421052631575
8170138,4,B000MMMT8M,"If you're watching or buying this movie to find out info about the McMartin trial I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Indictment-The-McMartin-Trial/dp/B00007G1VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Indictment - The McMartin Trial</a>

This film is about a Woman named Kendra Dollison. She's shocked to hear that a child who attends her son's preschool is making allegations about the teachers molesting the children. The Police Department sends out letters to all of the parents of the students stating that the employees were under investigation. Eventually,her son comes clean to a therapist about everything. What happens to the teachers is not actually stated in the movie. The movie ends with the children getting on a school bus as the credits roll.

The film was entertaining though the acting wasn't all that believable. I guess they took all of the allegations from the McMartin trial and made a movie of it. When watching it just remember that most of the things that happen in the movie were proven false in the McMartin trial.",1205280000,12,1080,5.660493827160494
8170139,5,B000MMMT8M,"This is best Lifetime movie ever made.  Satanism?  Check.  Child abuse? Roger that.  Animal sacrifice?  You bet.  Overprotective, but semi-abusive parents?  You know it.

I have been waiting for this movie to hit DVD for 6 years.  This is perhaps the single greatest piece of television camp that has ever been produced.  If you want an afternoon on pure television schlock, you MUST get this movie TODAY.

P.S. Hi christine!  Don't worry, your copy is in the mail.",1177113600,34,465,4.82051282051282
8170140,5,B000MMMT8M,"This is one of the most important movies of our time, and it was very difficult for me to get my hands on - in spite of the affordable price today. I had to wait a long time for it to come out on DVD.

For those who have ever heard of the McMartin pre-school case and/or the movie ""Indictment"" based on same, this movie is also based on McMartin but not as if it were a hoax - which it was not. The preschool has another name, but the general facts of the case are all present. This movie was put out in 1989 and pretty much disappeared after that. I caught it once on the Lifetime channel and went looking all over the Internet for it, including the Lifetime channel itself. No dice.

I'm thrilled to have it today. If this topic interests you at all, this is a movie to have in your collection.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Indictment-The-McMartin-Trial/dp/B00007G1VS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Indictment - The McMartin Trial</a>",1176249600,17,972,4.920731707317073
