7992345,5,B00009PBX1,"This film blew me away! I was expecting some Hollyweird Glitter story; but what I got was ""in your face"" reality. Danny Huston is fast becoming one of my favorite actors. He's one of those who can convey an endless number of emotions in one single shot. He's a much underrated actor, as this film will show. He's not afraid to put himself out there. I've seen many films in which he seems to have only small roles, but even those make an impact, and the films are that much better for his presence. He IS Oscar-calibre, if given the chance-hear me, Hollyweird!
  Ivan Beckman is a people-pleaser with many, many ""close"" friends-until he needs one. Stellar performance, stellar actor, excellent cast and story. I believe this film should be re-released and hyped to the max. Gritty, dark and cerebral-a MUST SEE.",1349308800,,811,4.704225352112676
7992346,5,B00009PBX1,"This is one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen and Amazon was the only place I could find to purchase it. I saw it at the theatre in Los Angeles shortly after a very near death experience.  For me, this movie really captures the true sadness of death.  It also really portrays what it is like as an ICU nurse taking care of people dying, which is what I do for a living (and also helping them stay alive). I showed this movie to some friends who thought, ""that movie was really f***ed up!"".  There is no sugar coating of reality in this film.  It shows life as life can be, tragic. That's what makes this movie such a beautiful and meaningful piece of art.
See the late sculptor Robert Graham in this film.",1238544000,6,714,4.227941176470588
7992347,5,B00009PBX1,"Bernard Rose's masterwork, Ivansxtc., was unjustly overlooked on its modest theatrical release and it appears to be suffering the same fate on DVD.  After hearing a few good things and purchasing a screener from the film's website (the only place to buy it at the time), I was stunned by the brutality and depth of the film.  As someone who shies away from movies about ""the industry"" (since most are too inside, too glib, and far too full of themselves to offer anything of merit), I wasn't expecting such an explosive film.  To be fair, Danny Huston's performance would catapult even a lesser film to the stratosphere, but Mr. Rose's script and direction perfectly match the performance.  Although I was a fan of Mr. Rose's earlier work (Paper House, Candyman), nothing could have prepared for me the intelligent, wit and darkness that he brought to this film.  For anyone who believes that 'quality will out', Ivanxtc. proves that axiom to be false....for in a just world, this film would have been recognized for the masterpiece it most certainly is.",1205971200,12,1054,4.865921787709497
7992348,5,B00009PBX1,"Ran out to this in a little theatre in L.A. after 'The Weekly' did a great write-up on it. It's a shame it's lingered in post-theatrical to DVD purgatory but it's of no surprise. Based on the Tolstoy novel, 'The Death of Ivan Ilyitch', this re-telling is set to the back-drop of Hollywood. Or, more specifically, the power talent agency CAA.
This gritty, sharp tale is shot on DV which only adds to it's documentary allure. I can't imagine the powers-that-be were thrilled with their depiction as now this can only be found in the U.K.
An early-career Danny Huston is fantastic.
I guess one shouldn't surprised when you bite the hands of power where they place you.
Someone rescue this, please, cause it just reminds me that Capitalism is it's own form of censorship. (Note; there are on-line hacks to 'open-up' the regions on your dvd player for discs like this.)",1196899200,5,864,4.690789473684211
7992349,5,B00009PBX1,"It's a shame this sharp little film has been overlooked and practically forgotten. Saw it in a small theatre in Los Angeles and was pleasantly surprised. At the time there was a long article in LA Weekly singing it's praises and shortly thereafter it languished in the purgatory between small venue and dvd release.

It's no wonder, seeing as that the title character (portrayed wonderfully by early career Danny Huston) was depicted as a CAA Agent (a power talent agency) with absolutely no values. Or rather, as he gathers some sense of moral self he is quickly degenerating and hedged out of position. The low-budget here actually feeds this slow dread and realisation by Ivan of a lost life.

It has been specualted CAA, naturally, did not like the depiction of one of it's top agents as a coke snorting, whore-hound. (SPOILER hereafter)And even less so that the agency basically could care less that he had passed away. In fact, there was barely a heartbeat following his demise before the wolves were packing over the talent roster he left behind.

Based on Tolstoy's novel, 'The Death of Ivan Ilyitch' this is a gritty, smart adaptation that should have been better heralded. But when you bite hands that powerful it's not a wonder where they place you.

I am sure Tolstoy himself would be smirking at the poetic irony.",1196294400,12,1326,4.802631578947368
