7859235,3,6304030088,"I could tell you that ""Blacksnake!"" is set on the Caribbean Isle of San Cristobal, where Lady Susan (Anouska Hempel, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"") runs her plantation and her slaves as she sees fit, with the aid of her brutal overseers and big bull whip.  Or I could just point out that this 1973 film was directed by Russ Meyer and leave you to draw the obvious conclusions from that particular fact.  But if you have ever seen a Russ Meyer film, such as ""Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kil1!"" or ""Beneath the Valley of the Ultravixens,"" this fact might surprise you, because the women in this film are not as overly endowed, as is the norm in a Meyer exploitation film.  That makes ""Blacksnake!"" a most atypical film from the legendary director.
The plot has to do with the disappearance of Lady Susan's latest husband (David Prowse, yes Darth Vader himself from the first ""Star Wars"" trilogy).  When his brother Walker  (David Warbeck, ""Trog"") shows up to investigate he discovers the slaves are horribly abused and that everybody is really obsessed with sex (I told you this was a Russ Meyer film).  So what we have is an exploitation film about a period of exploitation, if that makes any sense.  The result is a curious combination of camp and sleaze, topped off by a slave revolt and a stirring speech on the evils of slavery, colonization, yadda yadda yadda.  If ""Blacksnake!"" (gee, I wonder what the title is suppose to mean) is the first and only Russ Meyer film you see, then you are never going to understand what the fuss is all about, which would also be true if you screened ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" (scripted by Roger Ebert).  You might also never be able to watch another slave plantation movie for the rest of your life.",1037664000,3,1743,4.596774193548387

If like myself, however, you are only interested in scenes of a beautiful woman wielding a bullwhip you won't be disappointed!",1024358400,5,212,4.916666666666667
