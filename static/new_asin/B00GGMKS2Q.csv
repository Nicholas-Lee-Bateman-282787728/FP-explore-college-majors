8622833,5,B00GGMKS2Q,"While I agree Paul Henreid's greatest pirate movie is "" The Spanish Main"" a pirate movie that deserves to be in the top 20 pirate movies of all time with ease.  I cannot say this movie is unremarkable...quite to the contrary there are a lot of remarkable scene's in this Pirate movie.  Not only are there some unique scene's there is some great sword fighting choreography & some very interesting weapons.  This Pirate movie also has something else going for it many others lack & that is the international feel of Pirates on the high sea's!!!  To often people forget Pirates have sailed the seas since merchants were using them for trade.  While Hollywood focused mostly on the period of Spain's might on the ocean, there is no denying Pirates thrived long before and well after the time of the Spanish main.  This is a great movie to add to your pirate movie collection that showcases more of a world view on Pirates.  I myself collect pirate movies & I consider this a must have for my collection & fortunately it is available to own at a reasonable price.  I must wait patiently to add a region 1 D.V.D. version of Roman Polanski's "" Pirates"" starring Walter Matthau to my collection.  Personally if your into collecting Pirate movies I would not wait to purchase this one ...to often I see movies become near unattainable sky rocketing in price or the greedy industry just doesn't see enough monetary return on putting older films out on D.V.D. !  Is this the best Pirate movie in my collection...no...doe's it help my Pirate Movie collection become the best...YES!!!",1495670400,,1572,4.704379562043796

8622835,3,B00GGMKS2Q,"Pirates of Tripoli, 1945 film

In the 17th century the cities of Tunisia were captured by the followers of Malik. The Princess of one city planned an escape to Tripoli (three cities). Men play games in a tavern. Who will win? The Princess meets the Pirate Captain. Will he help her? Malik sends his fleet to attack the Captains ships at Tripoli. The guns from the walled fortress fire on the invaders. [Model ships are used.] Is Princess Karjan responsible? Leya says so. The Princess has a plan to recover the treasure that is hidden underwater in a cavern beneath the palace. She rides back with two good men. [The long shots say stunt doubles are used.] They enter the palace and bypass a guard. Will there be a problem? Yes. The Captain wins again! The chest is recovered, the jewels taken. But more guards arrive. Yet they escape through a window.

There is more action, as in other costume dramas. When they return the plan is to buy new ships. But a spy betrays the secret (and gets an unexpected reward). Malik sends pairs of ships to patrol the sea between Italy to capture the Princess and bring her back for execution. The Captain warns the Princess of their fate. In the morning the battle begins. [The model ships look realistic.] When the battle ends Princess Karjan is captured and taken back to jail. Can the Captain send 200 men to Mizerata to rescue the Princess before she is executed for Treason? He will use that Italian ship. They succeed, Malik flees with the Princess. But they are caught in the cellar. After sword fights the supporters of the Princess win and get their reward.

This is an example of a Hollywood swashbuckler that entertained Americans before television supplanted movies in the 1950s. Was it a sequel to a more popular movie?",1421107200,2,1769,4.645367412140575

8622837,4,B00GGMKS2Q,"Paul Henreid doesn't get a lot of love as a swashbuckling lead, but he always gives these roles energy and wit, and if he's no Errol Flynn, then who is?  ""Pirates of Tripoli"" is not ""The Spanish Main"" -- Henreid's best pirate film -- but it does have the always-enjoyable Patricia Medina and, despite odd touches like Lon Chaney as Sinbad!, it's a solid 3.5-star swashbuckler.  It offers a basic swashbuckler plot: evil usurper must be vanquished by dashing lead who will thus rescue the princess.  ""Pirates of Tripoli"" seems almost to want to be a fantasy picture  -- the aforementioned Sinbad, as well as Aladdin and Ali Baba, make brief, unmemorable appearances -- but it remains solidly a swashbuckler, devoid of sorcery and the like.  It's briskly paced and enjoyable, but probably best-suited for collectors of the genre, rather than the casual viewer.  Again, 3.5-stars.",1401667200,7,877,4.972602739726027
