7894676,5,6305755701,"Gene's gotta new enemy! But this time its seven. The seven of the Chinese Guild controlled by Hazanko. The first one is LeiLong, an outlaw which little is known about him. Ofcourse, he first sends his student first. After Gene kills him, LeiLong comes out and manages to take out all of Gene's friends. Gene however, takes him out in a gun fight. Gene burries him, but LeiLong faked his death, gets out of his grave and heads out on his own. Next up, a good old pirate treasure hunting episode. A man asks Gene to go hunting with him in search of Dragonite worth 15,000,000 WONGS! They manange to get it, but the pirate ends up sacraficing his life and some of the treasure to kill a deamon holding down the ship. The crew gets back and can only sell some of the treasure for money, but with the cost of reapirs, it leaves them with zero. The animation in the second episode was really poor, it does feature some nice music that you might remember hearing in Final Fantasy. And with the intro to the real enemy of the Chinese Guild, this makes for a great tape. So continue watching and buy this tape. It only gets better from here.",981331200,,1132,4.34433962264151
