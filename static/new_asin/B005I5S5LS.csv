8474270,5,B005I5S5LS,"I lived how Angie broke down the moves so that even those who didn't think they had a waist or could move like that,were able  to  the steps with some confidence. Form is important  here so I would strongly recommend that these moves be done in a studio with full-length mirrors or with something close to that at home.
  Plus Angie made it fun and sexy. Made you feel your womanly attributes!!",1442188800,,394,4.416666666666667

8474272,5,B005I5S5LS,Wonderful. Its more simple than other Dvds put out by worlddancenewyork. But the instructor is beautiful and very friendly. Also this dvd is very fun and easy to follow along. It can get your heart rate up a little bit if you do the whole thing. **NOTE its not sold as a workout dvd she does have one that is**  i hope she comes out with another one.,1424822400,,350,4.147058823529412
8474273,4,B005I5S5LS,"I am not that coordinated when it comes to sexy dance moves.  My only dance experience I have is cheerleading, which didn't require much moves in a flowing adult manner, even when we did dance.  I do not think I am great in the club, and always felt awkward doing more then a little hip movement, so this was more so I could get some rhythm.  The instructor is great, she slowly teaches you each thing and then go over it enough, then sum them up and move to the next.  It's the best way to learn (it's how we learned in cheerleading too, very smart instructing!), and at the end they put these together for an actual routine which is built up from sections.  I thought it was great, and I actually feel more coordinated already (after watching it once!), since I understand everything in bite size.  I know I'll only get better the more I do it, which is great...rhythm bought in a cd, well yes please!  As far as going out and being a go go dancer though, I think you would need some more cd's to get variety and what I've seen at concerts is they use some of these moves (these are very basic good to learn though), but combined with one's with more energy.  This paired with GoGo Dance - Katie Krause is what I bought and a good combo, this is better then the other cd as far as instruction, but paired I think you can understand the other better and actually have a decent routine maybe with practice.  Which is great!  I'll keep out for more cds too, it's fun to feel not so awkward and actually sexy for once! :D",1360454400,5,1519,4.224913494809688
8474274,3,B005I5S5LS,"Darnit.  I had seen Angie and her sisters in classic 1960s Go Go in videos on youtube.  They were great!  HOWEVER...  this is a different side of Angie, and I'm bummed.  I'm somewhat of a prude, so classic 60s Go Go is just my speed...  This is NOT classic Go Go.  It has been ""updated"" for use in modern dance clubs.  While it is slightly more conservative than other Go Go instructional DVDs out there, there is a substantial amount of raunchy grinding.

That said, her teaching method is alright.  great for a beginner.  lots and lots of repetition and very nice explanations of the steps.",1325203200,11,592,4.490566037735849
8474275,5,B005I5S5LS,"Learning to ""Go-Go"" Dance from this program is a totally delightful and easy experience in dance. Simply said, it is a blast!  This luscious sexy, body sculpting movement with tantalizing undulations will certainly be noticed!  It is easy to learn the full choreography, first because Angie is a superb instructor, the music is enticing and the go-go dance movement exhilarating. By the end of the one hour program, much of the dance vocabulary will be in use.
The instruction is categorized in four sections:  1. The Go-Go Dance Moves; 2. Sexy standing moves; 3. Sexy Upbeat Moves; 4. Sexy Hip Grind.

The following steps are included in the above sections and are coordinated with free style arm patterns. They are very simply broken down by the instructor with ease in transition in the drill section:
The Rolling Step- alternating feet in a ball ball exchange, add arm rolls, etc
Pendulum Swing- hips swing side to side on weight changes
Jailhouse Rock-mocking the famous Elvis movement, transferring the weight of the legs on the ball of the foot.
The Outlaw- hands to the hips and hipslide movement creating a box effect
The Slinky-sexy high stepping pass
The Pony- a popular 60's move that is fast paced hop and touch movement of the legs and feet
Variations include bending at the waist, plie~ and changing speed
*A fun mini drill follows with the above movement, Angie guiding the combinations and transitions in detail.
The next section brings in the following complex moves that will double the fun!
The Buffalo Bill- pelvis undulations on plie~ with arm overhead in a lassoing type movement
The Shimmy- shoulder shimmy coordinated with rolling step and looks fabulous with cross step
The Jerk-another timeless move of the 60's in two tempo and style variations
The Princess Farhana- rapid vertical hip slides in a diagonal orientation
Roll and Shoot- rapid shift of the feet to create horizontal hip slides; arms accentuating the movement
The Spotlight- snakey step touch patterns with hands in a stop position
*Another drill follows incorporating section two movement.
The final section includes:
""The Grind""- Pelvic circles on weight shifts, and  on a pivot circling around for a fabulous ""grind around the world!""
The Axis- a large hip circle which can be embellished with horizontal hip slides and free arms patterns
The Pop- a very popular dance move which involves chest and hip  undulations in small rapid range of motion while traveling forward and back or on plie`
Full body shimmy, arms and knee shimmy or vibrations
Choreography: Angie forms a dance routine with dance combinations from different sections and calls out counts and transistors. The full dance choreography is broken down in three sections with several repetitions, followed by her demonstration of the routine. The music track for the dance routine is "" Off Our Backs"" by MEN; more music selections by Men, also Bunky the Mechanic.
I had a terrific blast with this program and am now in quest of white go-go boots.",1317513600,17,3003,4.996
