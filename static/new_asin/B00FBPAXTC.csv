5974101,3,B00FBPAXTC,"The first hour A.C.O.D. made me laugh several times. Adam Scott does some great work as a man going through a personal crisis.
I myself am an Adult Child of Divorce and can fully relate to the chaos that involves pretty much any major family function. As the situation starts to spiral out of control, Scott's character tries to keep it together, but life has other plans. The sharp, observed humor in the first hour is replaced with sitcom-level dialogue and situations in the final act. A.C.O.D. does a nice job with a tricky balancing act for a while, but just can't sustain that momentum. That said, if you like this excellent cast, you will probably find something to enjoy here.",1390348800,,684,4.661157024793388
5974102,3,B00FBPAXTC,"This is a good story with some real truth for reflection. The all-star cast (with the exception of the younger brother Trey played by Clark Duke-- very talented, but he didn't ring true for me in this role) is superb. I've seen Adam in many roles and he is always very effective and consistent, same is true for Jane Lynch, Richard Jenkins and Catherine O'Hara--hilariously funny. Though handled in an obviously comedic manner (some might classify this as a bit of a romp--but on the dark side), the core of the story is quite serious. There were one-liners that summed-up this seriousness like, ""this generation of A.C.O.D. individuals is perhaps the most un-parented of any.""  Some might conclude that given the fact that many, if not most ""parents"" do not know what they're doing, the fact that they haven't inflicted themselves on their offspring, may be a very good thing. In this film (as in real life), nothing could be further from the truth. Parents have (consciously and unconsciously) passed-on their dysfunction (passed down to them) almost genetically. Children end-up, in many cases, replicating the same mistakes of their parents. Why is that? Part lack of awareness, part DNA, part cultural, et al; it is, as they say, complicated. But for sure, children of divorced parents have challenges. Are these challenges any greater or lesser than children who grow-up with both parents loving and validating each other and them also, maybe. Regardless of our familial upbringing, challenges in relationships is part of the human condition. The hope is that with films such as this, awareness will be raised. If we know and are aware of (e.g.) our father's penchant for alcohol, and what motivated him to rely on it for comfort and solace, we (as his child) might consciously be able to avoid that same pitfall. The most telling moment of the film comes at the end in the epilogue--the filmmaker(s) query ordinary folks regarding the status of their parents' marriages and true to statistical averages, over 50% are/were the products of divorced households. The impact on their lives ranged from folks who'd replicated their parents divorce--some twice over, and others who swore they would NEVER consider marriage. I am of the opinion that all families are dysfunctional, regardless of the marital status of their parents. I also believe that any person(s) contemplating parenthood, needs training. Everyone needs therapy! The more you know about your dysfunction, the more you'll be able to manage it--it doesn't go away, but like a chronic disease, it is manageable, I think.",1390176000,3,2586,5.056206088992974
5974103,5,B00FBPAXTC,"When I saw the preview I thought what a great cast,  it looked really funny,  it was even better than I thought,  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Would highly b recommend",1390089600,,164,4.366666666666666
5974104,3,B00FBPAXTC,"A.C.O.D. (aka Adult Children of Divorce) is a decent little comedy that tries to become something more substantial but doesn't quite succeed. It's clear that the film wants to make a statement about the effects divorce has had on the modern generation. As the film itself tells us (via voiceover narration from Jane Lynch), we now live in a world where divorce is the norm for just about every other kid out there. ""Without a clear example of a successful or stable relationship to examine from an early age, how are these kids supposed to develop successful relationships of their own when they're older?"" the film ponders. Despite the fact that these questions are voiced, they're never really tackled or answered by the bulk of the movie in any substantial way. The general lack of conclusiveness on the subject is best summarized by the end credits montage, which features a host of average folks saying that they are (or are not) children of divorce, that they have (or haven't) had success with relationships and that they do (or don't) like the idea of marriage. In summary: relationships exist, and they may or may not turn out well.

While A.C.O.D. may not work particularly well as some sort of profound statement, it is a pleasant, mildly amusing self-contained tale about one man's problems. Adam Scott has more or less mastered the art of playing put-upon straight men at this point; throwing up his hands in exasperation while the world around him spins out of control. He's not the guy you turn to for killer one-liners, but he's a splendid choice when you need a bewildered double-take. He brings both the stellar comic timing and the understated pathos the role needs, effectively handling both the solid comic portions and the slightly less engaging dramatic passages of the film with equal aplomb.

The laughs mostly come from the supporting cast, with Jenkins and O'Hara standing out in particular as an aging couple trapped in an eternal love/hate relationship. Jenkins is often cast as a sadsack or a no-nonsense businessman, but he's a gleefully gifted comic actor who knows his way around a cutting barb. O'Hara plays off him beautifully, and whenever the two start pushing and pulling they tend to start walking away with the movie. Clark Duke does a fun variation on the sort of enthusiastic, socially awkward figure he often plays, while Jessica Alba and Mary Elizabeth Winstead ably flesh out characters who seem a little one-dimensional on paper. Amy Poehler is also rock-solid as Jenkins' embittered trophy wife, though I wish we had seen a bit more of her. The plot mostly follows a series of predictable beats (the midsection, which focuses heavily on Carter's personal crisis, seems particularly by-the-numbers), but the game cast and a decent supply of chuckle-inducing jokes helps smooth things over. At a fleet 87 minutes, the flick doesn't overstay its welcome or let the constant improvisation tamper with maintaining a consistent pace.

A.C.O.D. (Blu-ray) has received a solid 1080p/1.85:1 transfer. The film doesn't look dramatically different from any other modestly-budgeted studio comedy, but colors are bright and vibrant, detail is strong and depth is satisfactory. The DTS HD 5.1 Master Audio track is perfectly solid as well, delivering the dialogue-driven track with clarity. Nick Urata's unobtrusive musical score supports the material without ever becoming distracting. Supplements include a handful of topically-appropriate public service announcements, some Amy Poehler outtakes, a cast & crew discussion of the film and a digital copy.

5974105,4,B00FBPAXTC,"If you're a fan of Adam Scott's work on Parks and Recreation, you'll enjoy this movie. It covers serious topics in a lighthearted way, and is more memorable than most romantic comedies.

5974106,3,B00FBPAXTC,"""Them together is bad for everyone, especially me."" Carter (Scott) has settled into his life as an Adult Child Of Divorce. He has a girlfriend he likes and a restaurant he owns. When his brother Trey (Duke) informs him of his engagement things begin to fall apart for Carter. First he has to try and get his parents to talk to each other so the wedding won't be ruined. Then he must keep them from getting back together for his sake. Going in with that cast I was expecting a hilarious comedy that I would be laughing at the whole time. While this was a good movie and I did like it it wasn't nearly as funny as I was expecting. There are some funny parts in this but it wasn't the laugh riot I was expecting. This is more about the selfishness of one person and how he messes with everyone's life to make him more comfortable. There is some very funny moments in this but hard to make that plot hilarious. Again though this is a good movie and worth seeing but do not expect the laugh-out-loud comedy I did. Overall, good and worth seeing but not super funny. I give it a B.",1389398400,,1075,4.223300970873787
5974107,4,B00FBPAXTC,"A successful restaurant owner. Carter, doesn't realize to what degree his parents' divorce has had on him and his love life until a famous author, played by Jane Lynch (Glee's Coach Sue), who provides most of the humour in the film, gently helps him to open his eyes.  Adult Children of Divorce usually either fear marriage or repeat/echo the same patterns used by their parents.

Carter was briefly happy at the age of nine at the family cottage and named his restaurant after the lane it was on to hold on to some memories and hope of ever having a future happy family life.  When Carter develops more clarity on how he was parentified by his unaware parents, he begins to transition from his old life (symbolized by the burning down of the cottage) to a new one, as explained by the author in her latest book, as a member of an entire generation who was forced to re-parent themselves.

A light and thoughtful family/romantic comedy.",1389312000,,936,4.620481927710843
5974108,4,B00FBPAXTC,"""A.C.O.D."" (2013 release; 90 min.) brings the story of Carter (played by Adam Scott) and his dysfunctional family. As the movie opens, we see 8 mm footage of Carter's 9th birthday party at the family's lakeside summer house, where his mom and dad are screaming at each other at the top of their lungs. (We later learn that was the last time Carter went to the lake house.) In a cleaver montage, we see the family tree of Carter's mom and dad's subsequent marriages (in plural, indeed), including his dad's current wife (played by Amy Poehler). We then come back to the present day, some 20 years later. Carter's younger brother Duke plans to get married, and Duke would love for his parents, who haven't spoken for 20 years, to be there. Carter tries to figure out a way. Meanwhile, Carter is dealing with his own love life, including hid longtime girlfriend Lauren (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who is getting tired of waiting for Carter to pose pop the big question. To deal with all the pressure, Carter looks up Dr. Judith (played by Jane Lynch), who is not really a doctor but does talk with patients about divorce issues. She wrote a book 20 years ago (called ""Children of Divorce"") about Carter and other kids like him. Dr. Judith now hatches the idea of writing a sequel called ""Adult Children of Divorce""). It is in that context that Carter gets to know fellow A.C.O.D. Michelle (played by Jessica Alba). To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is billed as a comedy, and indeed the trailer I had seen of this movie seemed to indicate this was going to be a laugh-out-loud movie about divorce and its long-term effects. As it turns out, there are some funny scenes in the movie, but there are many more bittersweet, if not outright sad, moments in the movie, because guess what: divorce isn't funny in the first place! At one point Carter tricks his parents into having dinner with him by inviting one without telling the other. As you can imagine, things are not going well, and at a certain point Carter says in disgust and despair ""You have turned a 9 year marriage into a 100 year war!"". This is the directing debut of TV writer/producer Stu Zicherman, who co-wrote the script with Ben Karlin. The cast is generally speaking top-notch, none more so than Adam Scott (who is in virtually every frame of the movie) and also Mary Elizabeth Winstead, whom we saw also excel in last year's ""Smashed"". But perhaps the biggest surprise for me was Jane Lynch, in a role that is miles away from her over-the-top character in Glee. Amy Poehler does the most with her limited screen time. And if you are hoping to see a lot of Jessica Alba: beware! She plays a very small role in the second half of the movie, that's it. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the excellent choice of indie songs that are sprinkled throughout the movie, including ""Lost coastlines"" by Okkervil River, ""Ashamed"" by Deer Tick, ""Heart It Races"" by Dr. Dog, etc.

This movie showed up last month at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati with very little pre-release fanfare or advertising. I figure this will not play very long so I went to see it right away. I was surprised how well attended the matinee screening was where I saw this at, so maybe the interest and demand for this movie is stronger than I had imagined. If you are looking for a funny movie to simply have a good time for 90 min., this movie will not do that for you. If instead you are interested in a different perspective on divorce and its consequences, whether intended or not, this might be just the movie for you. ""A.C.O.D."" is worth checking out, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1384387200,5,3759,4.55096011816839

8614069,1,B00FBPAXTC,"Even Amy Poehler, Adam Scott and Jane Lynch could NOT save this dreadful, dreary, negative, painfully tedious movie.

If you are really into talky comedy / dramas about strained, stressed, fractured, painful, toxic, and strange relationships, this movie might be for you.  But my roommate and I really just could hardly stand it.  He is an Adult Child Of Divorce (by the way).  I am not, but that doesn't matter.  We both reacted to the movie exactly the same.

It is about 90 minutes long but feels like it's ALMOST THREE HOURS!!!

Amy Poehler who we normally LOVE, was STIFF in absolutely every scene (the little bit she was in it).  Just cold and stiff and dull as could be.

Most of the actors were nothing but a muddled mess.  Jane Lynch was great, but also couldn't save this awful movie.

There was ONE really funny line in this mostly unfunny movie and you have to have watched Parks and Rec to get it...

Adam Scott:  I was thinking that in another life we could have been close.
Amy Poehler:  No.

SPOILER ALERT:
When Adam Scott's brother announced that he was getting married, any good brother would have said, NO you're NOT getting married, you are TOO young, and WAY too stupid... This brother was incredibly stupid (he is a fictional character, so I can say that) and not the kind of stupid that you laugh at.  It's the kind of stupid that's so stupid you just groan and wish you were watching another movie...  But no, Adam Scott not only says he will help, but he will get mom and dad there.  And this unleashes a series of some of the most unplausible and unrealistic events I have ever seen in a movie.

When Adam Scott's dad's second wife gets pissed at everybody and closes Adam's restaurant, the RICH dad does NOTHING to save the restaurant AT ALL!!!  They didn't even TALK about it!!  Oh my god, that's just so ridiculous and idiotic I can't even stand myself for having watched that movie.

At the end of this amazingly long (for 90 minutes), dull mess, we have THREE potential Bride Grooms walking into a church together.  And then the movie just ENDS!!!  WHICH ONES(s) are getting MARRIED???  What a HORRIBLE way to end a movie!!!  If I had paid to see it I would have actually asked for my money back!!!",1520812800,,2229,4.482587064676617
