8321899,3,B001MUZ3K4,"Fully Awake is a strange title for a film that feels like a elegy. The dreary soundtrack is a huge part of the problem. Black Mountain College was the birthplace of ""happenings"" in 20th Century art. The interviews seem to focus on the history but shed little light on how important the experience was for the students in their lives. Many went on to produce great work after attending the school, but very little of that is featured.  That said, the interviews and photographs are worthwhile. It would be nice to see a documentary that focuses on the triumphs of the college instead of the failures.",1469750400,,599,4.650943396226415
8321900,2,B001MUZ3K4,"I purchased the DVD expecting to be engaged and informed of the Black Mountain poetry group. What I found was that the documentary in a short 60-minute session ran flat, dropped lots of names. Admittedly the documentary encompassed a wide-range of the arts at the college. Everything from pottery to dance. Poetry is mentioned, though without much substance.

Some insight into its liberal, effusive commitment to learning. However, if the buyer seeks insight into the writing process they will be disappointed.

The observers in the film lightly touched on incidents that were not particularly revealing. Historically the college was a maverick at the time of its conception. A diversion from the normal rigors of college life. Providing students with the power to avail themselves of the freedom offered at Black Mountain.

Because the effect is a scattered, broad look at Black Mountain the real substance of creativity seems only lightly pronounced. A limited, too briefly noted glance at this important poetry movement. Hardly rendering it as important as its contributions. Rather a short-changing occurs here.",1390608000,3,1116,5.365714285714286
