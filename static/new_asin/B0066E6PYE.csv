4962092,4,B0066E6PYE,I'm sorry I can't give you more information about this item - it is a good film - that's why I bought it.,1362787200,,105,3.608695652173913
4962093,5,B0066E6PYE,"It's been hard for me to find any kind of review of the ""Lex Barker Tarzan Collection,"" distributed by Warner Home Video as a DVD-R box set. I've never bought any of the WB DVD-R titles before, so I was a little skeptical at what to expect. I took a chance and ordered this set and could not have been more pleased.

The picture quality is crisp and sharp on all five of these fun, action-packed Tarzan adventures.  And the sound is excellent, too.  Also, it is much less expensive to buy all five Lex Barker Tarzan films in this box set than to buy them individually.

I grew up watching many of the old Tarzan movies on TV in the Sixties.  My favorite Tarzans, for what it's worth, were Johnny Weissmuller, Lex Barker, and Gordon Scott (in that order). And my favorite Janes were Maureen O'Sullivan, Brenda Joyce, and Eve Brent (in that order).

The ""Lex Barker Tarzan Collection"" has all five of Barker's RKO Tarzan movies: Tarzan's Magic Fountain (1949); Tarzan and the Slave Girl (1950); Tarzan's Peril (1951); Tarzan's Savage Fury (1952); Tarzan and the She-Devil (1953). Reviews of each of these titles are easily found on Amazon.

I will note that these DVD-R movies are divided into chapters, but there is no menu page that shows chapters by number or chapter title. The menu page does explain that the films are divided into ten minute chapters and the viewer can move through the movie by hitting the ""advance"" or ""previous"" buttons on the remote control. This at least saves the viewer from having to fast forward through a movie with no chapters at all.

Also, these DVD-R discs were designed to play in DVD players only and will not play in computers and some other playback devices. If you have questions about disc playability, I advise consulting the WB website or calling WB Customer Service before ordering.

Aside from those points, this set is pretty close to flawless. If you love Tarzan movies and want some fun entertainment suitable for the whole family, then look no further.",1329177600,28,2001,4.678062678062678

4962135,4,B0066E6PYE,Lex Barker was Tarzan when I grew up. I enjoyed reliving the adventures packed with action and an actor who made Tarzan come alive.,1461801600,,131,4.5

4962141,5,B0066E6PYE,"Lex Barker is a good Tarzan.  I just with there were not so many different ""Janes.""  I am just through the third one of the set, and Dorothy Dandridge (one of her first, if not the first) and George Macready (a villain of the first order) were good in this specific one.  Also appearing in two of the films was one of my favorite character actors, Henry Brandon, and an actor who played many film noir villains - Anthony (here credited as Tony) Caruso.  Not much of Jane (Virginia Huston) appears though.  Did not think much of the Jane in the second one - Vanessa Brown.  The films' reproduction were good with some slight scratches in the print at the beginning.  Since it was MOD, it was more that most users would pay, but I am a Tarzan completist, so it was worth it to me.  Lex went on to play in German westerns and mysteries including a couple of Dr. Mabuse sequels.  His more famous role was in Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita with Anita Ekberg.  Looking forward to seeing the last two in the set which I have seen before, including the beefy Raymond Burr as a villain a couple of years before Perry Mason, and the Greystoke legacy mentioned in the fourth one.  I think fans would like this set.",1423612800,,1205,4.358744394618834
4962142,3,B0066E6PYE,"This collection is worth 3 stars at best.  Indeed I rate it that high primarily for the quality of the picture/sound/packaging and for the nostalgia value.  There are other, nicely detailed, reviews on Amazon if you want a good idea of the specific contents.  I just disagree with the high ratings given.

The stories are lame, the acting is wooden, the dialog is trite, continuity is minimal and the stock wildlife shots are haphazard mlanges (Really, groups of jaguars ?  Macaws, cockatiels, and great horned owls on the same continent ?  Stampede shots alternating between Indian and African elephants ?)

I remember seeing these in second-run features at the local theatre and on the ""Sunday matinee"" on the early TV of the '50s.  As a child, I obviously didn't take much to be entertained.  There is not much here to help the viewer suspend reality and buy into the stories.  I give this set ""points"" for nostalgia, with the movies prompting memories of my childhood.  But the entertainment just does not hold up like other ""B"" movies of the time.  I've gotten as much from these as I can get, kudos for that small bit.

Again, ""points"" for the quality of the packaging, which includes old movie posters on the covers.  ""Points"" for the transfers ... pictures are crisp and clear, with few obvious blemishes.  The sound is excellent.

There are occasional bright spots in the acting, but those are usually brief, involving some quality character actors (like Raymond Burr) ... and they are the bad guys.

Another reviewer suggested a $19.99 price would be appropriate, and I tend to agree.  I would feel less guilty about a 3-star rating at that price.",1409097600,4,1657,4.795053003533569

4962163,3,B0066E6PYE,I bought this box set fondly remembering this period of tarzan sadly there time has long passed these are ok films but just that they are tame and not really that interesting nothing much happens there is a few minor action scenes but action films have grown since these where made they are ok but I couldn't care less if I missed any one of these films they do not excite me these films have not been shown on british tv since maybe the 80s 0r 90s and I have to say if I had seen these films recently I would not have bought them they are ok to watch but forgettable I don't feel they are films one would watch to much and not really worth adding to ones collection however the prints are probably the best one will find but being made in black and white with all new moden digital tvs the picture does have a bright shiny haze to it I would not invest in this unless you are a avid tarzan fan much better to see them on tv if your tv plays them that is,1395619200,,954,4.0
4962164,5,B0066E6PYE,If you are a fan of Tarzan you need to get this collection.  Lex was a worthy successor to Johnny.,1395187200,,98,3.9
4962165,5,B0066E6PYE,"I dated him when I was 23 and he was 53.  He had been living in Spain and was separated from his wife, Miss Spain.  She was about my age.  He was sooooo handsome...a giant of a man at six foot four inches tall.  Incredible body, which one might not expect at his age back in 1973.  I lived in Bel Air on the property of the inventor at Mattel toys, Jack Ryan.  He walked in the door, and it was dark in the room.  I can still see him walk in and up to me.....I was the bartender.  He had such a deep voice and a great sense of humor.  By the end of the evening, he invited me to Palm Springs for the weekend.  I was straight out of Texas and quite naive.  I asked him if that he meant he expected me to sleep with him, and he said that was up to me.  I went with him and his friend, Bill, who had been head of Warner Brothers. We spent time by the pool, he played tennis, had great dinners out, and he and Bill played cribbage.  We had a wonderful time.  I only had two more dates with him.  He invited me to go to New York with him, and I could not because of another obligation.  He died on the street of a massive heart attack and I never saw him again.  He had smoked from the time he was young, as I did, and all of us did back then.  He would keep a plastic cigarette in his mouth most of the time, trying to quit smoking.  It must have been too little too late.  We were all lucky that he was an actor, and such a fine person.",1394150400,6,1433,3.777027027027027
4962166,4,B0066E6PYE,"Having read all the Tarzan books as a kid I never understood the Johnny Weissmuller character. Too dumb, too uneducated. Now these (5) all have their own issues, same actors in different roles from consecutive movies and I think I saw the same river scenes with the elephants in (3) different movies. That being said they are all pretty well done. I enjoyed them all. Of course I was also one of the few who actually liked John Carter of Mars.",1383091200,2,443,4.481481481481482
4962167,3,B0066E6PYE,"When I was a kid, Lex Barker was the one and only Tarzan.  I can still remember waiting in line to see his movies.  Once I saw him make an appearance in a different kind of movie dressed in a suit and someone in the audience said, ""Hey, there's Tarzan!""  Although Mr. Barker was not buffed like Gordon Scott, he was tall with broad shoulders and exceptionally handsome so he fits the role well.  There are five different Janes in this set all pretty with nice legs.  It looks like authentic wild animal footage and Tarzan's Peril has some genuine African style singing and dancing with drums.  Tarzan and the She-devil featurs a young Raymond Burr (Perry Mason) as a bad guy.  The video quality is exceptionally good considering how old the original films are.  That's about all the positives I can give this overpriced set.

The action and storylines are at best mediocre; however, this was common in the in the 40s and 50s when movies always seemed to be leaving you wanting more.  There are too many tribes of white people but then again understandable considering how hard it may have been to be auithentic in those days.  Some of the pictures on Amazon make it look like you're getting a box set, but in reality you will get allfive discs in a slim case.  I recommend watching them in order for the first time from oldest to newest and getting individual sleeves for each disc if you plan to watch them repeatedly.  I would have been very happy with a price of $19.99.

4962169,5,B0066E6PYE,"This fine collection of Hollywood's version of Edgar Rice Burrough's sophisticated natural man, picks up where Johnny Weissmuller left off.  They exude tons of jungle drama, Cheetah antics and apeman heroics, all with a new Jane in every episode.

I grew up reading ERB's books, and my favorite movie Tarzan is, of course, Johnny Weissmuller, the unbeatable Olympic swimmer. Lex Barker had tough shoes to fill and does quite well.  He's handsome, tall and built, but not muscle bound and his persona is more laid back, almost collegiate-like.  He did a bunch of action films.  Died in his 50's from an heart attack.

They transfer the films wonderfully.  Shot in B&W, they run around 75 minutes on average, 80 if you're lucky.  They pack in a lot of action and background jungle footage in that short time. The treehouse is still there with Cheetah.  A few nice panoramic artistic backdrops. All produced by Sol Lesser.

Quick summary: Tarzan's Magic Fountain- the final Brenda Joyce showing as Jane.  I like her, very expressive and American.  Bad guys want to find the fountain of youth led by Jane(Tarzan wants to teach her a lesson).  Lex is breaking in the role.  His first word, you know, ""Umgawa!""

Tarzan and the Slave Girl- Aztec-like secret society captures women including Jane to populate their sickness afflicted world.  Multilingual, intelligent, attractive Vanessa Brown becomes Jane- she carries a bow, swings from the trees, rides an elephant, does judo on a rival, takes charge- still gets caught and taken away in chains.  Neat jungle trek for Tarzan, he looks good with a bow and arrow.  Of note, Mr. Burroughs visited the set and died shortly after it was released.

Tarzan's Peril- Virginia Huston, quite a change from the other Janes but does fine.  Her acting career was short lived when she married.  Tarzan fighting it out with gunrunners, and, probably, the most detestable of his movie villains, Radijeck, played deftly by George Macready.

Tarzan's Savage Fury- now it's diamonds with Dorothy Hart as Jane- the elegant model turned star actor wanna-be who came to hate Hollywood and the stinky roles they offered her.  Thankfully for her, she dumped glitter town and went on to do service for the UN and child relief.

Tarzan and the She-Devil- just like the final Weissmuller entry this is a strange one.  Tarzan thinks Jane(Joyce McKenzie) is dead; he gives up the spirit, gets captured by ivory hunters(just like old times), chained up and tortured, but recovers to save the day with his buddies the elephants, Timba, Tantor, etc. after he learns Jane lives.  Raymond Burr, around his Godzilla days, plays a baddie.  Ms. McKenzie would later show up for an episode of Burr's Perry Mason.

Good stuff for those who appreciate the genre.
