8417617,4,B0047159QS,"This covers ONE way to throw a knife.  Jack Dagger knows what he's talking about and if you are not going to spend a lot of time practicing, then no instructional video is going to help you.  I really dislike that Mr. Dagger said something to the effect of ""If I can teach {hollyweird talk-show host} to throw in just a few minutes, then I can teach you"".  - You are not going to learn to throw in just a few minutes! Practice is the key to learning and this goes a long way to cover a few essential fundamentals.
 My favorite part of the video is the shameless self-promotion at the end. Mr. Dagger is trying to sell you one of his t-shirts and he tries desperately to point to the logo on the t-shirt without looking like he is pointing to the model's ample breasts.  -Should have added a star just for that.",1405209600,,810,4.2

8417619,5,B0047159QS,"Jack Dagger's DVD on knife throwing is a must have for everyone from beginner to expert. He does it in an entertaining way that keeps the viewers interest. I have seen him interviewed and during it he throws a wood handled knife into a target then throws the next into the wood handle of the first. He is the real deal and a character.
 I am active in sport throwing and got many good tips from this DVD. His section on Frequently Incurred Problems go into more depth than any other DVD or video I have watched. He delivers as promised in my opinion on a viewer will be sticking the target on a regular basis in a very short period of time. Great for throwers looking for quality instruction at any level.
 Jack knows his stuff and has the knack of passing it on in a fun way. Definitely getting his next DVD.
Thanks Jack",1393891200,4,821,4.256410256410256
8417620,5,B0047159QS,"If you are just starting out or wanting to refine your technique and get rid of bad habits while throwing, this is the dvd for you!

Within an hour of watching the DVD I was consistently sticking a half a dozen knives within a 6 inch radius.

It is worth every penny.",1371945600,3,267,4.115384615384615
