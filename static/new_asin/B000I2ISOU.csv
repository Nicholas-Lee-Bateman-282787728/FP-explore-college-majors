8143171,3,B000I2ISOU,"There were a times between a few hokey special fx scenes that I caught myself wondering ""Why am I watching this ?"". Because 'Beyond Dream's Door' has so much more to offer in suspense, creepiness, and atmosphere. The entire film made me feel as though if had a larger budget, it could have ranked up there with 'A Nightmare on Elm St' as another heavyweight horror film of the late 80s. It is truly that stylish. Many of the visuals were inspired works of art in their own right which left me guessing where reality stopped along the way. Sure, there is some flat acting which only enhances the film in a bizarre David Lynch-like manner, but that became part of the appeal. I'd recommend this gem to any horror fan not looking for the typical 'Friday The 13th' bloodbath.",1342742400,3,771,4.514285714285714
8143172,1,B000I2ISOU,"The lead actor is a young Shakespearean stage actor who will forever be embarrassed by this, his first film. The story doesn't make too much sense, the acting is amateur for the most part (the lead guy IS the best actor, but he's not that good), and the special effects are really poor.

A good movie to skip.",1334793600,,309,4.327586206896552
8143173,4,B000I2ISOU,"Made in Ohio for very little money, BEYOND DREAM'S DOOR is a sometimes goofy, somewhat shabby, eerily entertaining low budget film from the 80s. Logic is tossed out in favor of nightmarish imagery and apocalyptic atmosphere. Don't expect multi-million dollar fx or high-calibre acting. This is a small project w/ a big, dark heart! There are just as many brilliant moments as there are cheeezy ones, making for a semi-haunting experience. If you enjoy demons, ghouls, and / or the supernatural, then BDD is worth your time...",1316044800,3,525,5.045977011494253
8143174,5,B000I2ISOU,"This will be brief. I heard about this movie from the pages of the original GOREZONE magazine from Starlog Press in about 1988 or so. I've been looking for it ever since. Now that I have it, I realize this is a movie only ""die hard"" indie/horror/gore fans will dig. If you're a collector of the obscure,
buy this at an affordable price. If you don't appreciate low-level production and hideous acting with questionable special F/X, you may want to pass on this one. If you _do_ appreaciate this type of stuff, it goes nicely alongside Cameron's Closet and similar fare.",1226361600,2,569,4.643564356435643
8143175,3,B000I2ISOU,"Yes,this film has it's limitations but it also has its strengths - considering that 99.9% of direct-to-video ""movies"" are total dreck,this stands as an interesting and fairly entertaining genre film (the fact it was shot on film counts for something!)

The pacing is a little slow,and yes it can be a bit confusing,but I feel that it was at least partially deliberate and not due to incompetence!

As it stands,I wouldn't suggest rushing out and aquiring at all costs,but it does remain an entertaining example of mid-to-late 80's direct to video film making that leaves me feeling (somewhat) nostalgic for pre-CGI cheap-o horror movies",1160438400,6,636,5.105769230769231
8143176,3,B000I2ISOU,"yes, this movie is rather poor in editing and other aspects (acting especially).  There are some interesting psychological aspects though, that I did find to be fascinating.  Considering a lot of the low budget horror that is being released today, this movie at least has some depth and originality.  I rated it off the lack of experience but good ideas angle for the students who did this project.",1115078400,3,398,4.823529411764706
8143177,2,B000I2ISOU,"A respectable independent effort that just doesn't quite work.  The dream concepts are interesting, confusing, as well as jarring at first.  However the film is nowhere near coherent or well-constructed enough to maintain what could've been an interesting hook.  Sell out and watch an Amenabar or Shamalon film instead-otherwise investing 90 minutes in this will just result in boredom and restless irritation.",1063843200,,410,5.580645161290323
