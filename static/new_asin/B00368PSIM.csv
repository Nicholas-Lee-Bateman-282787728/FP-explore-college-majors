4075179,5,B00368PSIM,"This is truly a wonderful reimagining of the Tony Stark story.  My three year old and I watch this alot along with the original 1966 Iron Man.  The stories and animation are superb and I am delighted that Disney saw enough potential to allow this show to stick around (RIP. ""Wolverine & The X-Men"" and ""The Spectacular Spider-Man"") for a second season.  The special features are not much but still this show is worth the buy especially now that IRON MAN 2 is out and the hype is high.  So sit back relax and prepare yourself to be blown away true believers!  Excelsior!!!",1276128000,,571,4.504854368932039
4075180,1,B00368PSIM,"Just like the last commenter...my family and I love the show! We were introduced to it by Netflix streaming (first 6 episodes) and could not get enough! (All of the first 6 episodes were presented in WIDESCREEN.) I also found that NickToons streams a few newer episodes online (all in WIDESCREEN) and we decided we like the show enough to buy the complete first season.

Well, we ordered this DVD of the complete first season and...it is in FULLSCREEN!!!
The back of the box says:
""STANDARD VERSION PRESENTED IN A FORMAT PRESERVING THE ASPECT RATIO OF ITS ORIGINAL TELEVISION EXHIBITION""

What does that mean to you? Well ""standard version"" may well mean FULLSCREEN but the rest of the statement seems intentionally misleading. This was clearly created originally in WIDESCREEN and cropped for this DVD. Was it presented in FULLSCREEN in April 2009 when originally aired? Hard to say but I guess it is possible. Regardless, this is intended to mislead. Since the discs themselves actually say FULLSCREEN, why was the studio not willing to put that on the outer box? Instead, they came up with this ridiculous statement to intentionally mislead.

This just infuriates me. If you buy episodes from iTunes or Amazon, they are in WIDESCREEN. Amazon lists this as WIDESCREEN. Why would Vivendi Studios create the DVD in FULLSCREEN?

Here is my thought:
It is also available on BluRay and my bet is it is presented in WIDESCREEN there. Can anyone confirm? Seems like Vivendi Studios wants to create ""premium"" value for their BluRay product by not allowing WIDESCREEN on their lower tier DVD product.

Note to other studios: Do not follow suit unless you want to hasten the death of the DVD. People will just move to streaming and legal & illegal downloads before they are forced into BluRay.

Note to Amazon:
Update this listing. This product is not WIDESCREEN!!!",1275696000,24,1857,4.916932907348243
4075181,5,B00368PSIM,"The animation in this series is excellent. It's also engaging enough for a 10 year old to appreciate it as well as entertaining enough to keep a four year old glued to their seat. Having the entire season together in a well priced bundle is FAR preferable to having a few episodes per disc sold at inflated prices. I was pleased enough with the price and the quality of the episodes I viewed with my daughter on TV that I pre-ordered this season 1 release. I am very happy that I did. I think the series could benefit from more characterisation of the female characters, but it does make a good start.",1275436800,7,601,4.375
4075182,3,B00368PSIM,"Product Review: 1 Star - Don't be fooled by the description. This is NOT Widescreen. The original series was created and broadcast on Nicktoons in a Widescreen format. Some idiot chopped this down and changed the format to Standard Version. It never ceases to amaze me, with all the unemployed people, there are so many incompetents mastering DVDs. You can't even buy a Standard TV anymore, everything is Widescreen. Yet there are so many defective DVDs produced, with incorrect formating and subtitles that run below the letterbox.

Animation Review: 5 Stars - Think of this as an alternate universe version of the Iron Man story. Instead of an adult, Tony Stark is a teenager. While Iron Man purists may not like that, it is very entertaining. The animation is high quality, with lots of great action. The stories are well written. Many are individual segments that follow the development of the characters. There are a lot of  villains, which are well done. Many villains reappear throughout the series. There is also a main arc that covers the story of the Mandarin.",1274745600,7,1070,4.906077348066298
4075183,1,B00368PSIM,"Honest. I have no idea why the people in charge or producing the DVD product don't present the show in the way they were made. Transformers Animated? Created in 16:9 widescreen, the DVD? 4:3. Iron Man: Armored Adventures created in 16:9 and the DVD? 4:3. The product description even says WIDESCREEN and I was pissed to actually put it in my player to see it in 4:3.

My one star is a reflection of this product only. As far as the show itself goes, I would give it 5 stars but this 4:3 version of the show totally removes from the awesome visual experience I got addicted to watching it on Netflix Instant Stream.",1274313600,24,614,4.385964912280702
4075184,1,B00368PSIM,"This just goes to show that if you make an effort at something, no matter how LAME the effort -some people will like it.

We just had a great blockbuster smash hit movie. Let's follow it up with a cartoon in an atempt
to capture the younger viewer (our movie was PG13 after all). Now make it fast quick and in a hurry!

I will preface my statements by saying I have only seen the pilot episode form the ""Iron Man -2 disc set"".

This is NOT Iron Man.  Tony Stark isn't Peter Parker, nor should his story be ripped from some rejected power-ranger script.  We start the series with a classic rogue like ""The Mandrian"", and the rest seems imprompto -employing the most basic CG animation, shallow story lines and very few characters.

No Thanks, I'll pass.  And I recommend you should too.",1274313600,7,785,4.409722222222222
4075185,1,B00368PSIM,"I refuse to watch this because in comics or films the timeline is when Tony Stark is a man not a boy. So this really is a bastardization of the original story. Tony Stark as a teen doesnt interest me. In the true stories he is just a rich kid that can appreciate resposibility and that he learns that as an adult; NOT a teen. I will buy the older series as it is true to the storyline. I was interested in this series when I heard about it, but didn't realize later after reviewing that this is the only Iron Man story that conflicts with all others and claims that he had Iron Man armor as a boy. What a load of manure. Especially since it is the only of its kind. The movies are terrific and mention that the FIRST Iron Man armor is created when he is injured as an adult.",1273881600,5,774,4.032467532467533
4075186,5,B00368PSIM,"My daughters and I got really into this series. There is great animation and I was amazed how many visual effects were included in each episode making for some truly high-quality battle scenes. Some episodes suffered from cliche plot lines, but those involving the story-arc search for the Mandarin Rings were fabulous and set in very exotic locations.",1273795200,3,352,5.086206896551724
4075187,5,B00368PSIM,"When the show first premiered, I was a bit reluctant on trying it out, but after tuning in for only a few episodes, I was hooked on not only the well-crafted storyline, but also the interesting cast of characters that would help carry the show throughout its first season. Howard Stark is killed in the first episode, and his son Tony must carry on his father's goal of collecting and researching the five magical Makluan rings. During this journey, he must also come to terms with his father's death, and the legacy he left behind when Tony is set to inherit the company when he turns eighteen. Along for the ride are Tony's friends, who all contribute something to either the storyline itself or to the development of our hero; who grows over the course of the series. The villains who are introduced feel like actual fleshed out characters, from the unstable and misguided Living Laser to the enigmatic and tragic Madame Masque, rather than obstacles that the hero must fight for the sake of filling time. As the show progresses, Tony begins to realize hidden secrets about his father he didn't know about and things begin to tie back to the late Howard Stark and how everything starts coming together in the end.

The cel-shaded animation is a unique look for the show, and helps it stand out from not only the other CG properties currently airing on television, but also the traditional animated shows as well. The cinematography is creative and dynamic; not only making the fight scenes fun to watch, but everyday tasks look and animated beautifully. While certainly no match for the theatrical works of Pixar and Disney, this show certainly feels like an aesthetic standard that all CG properties on television should strive to achieve.

Overall, I found this show to be a lot more than I thought it would be; especially in a genre I lost interest in long ago. I recommend this show to any sci-fi fans, superhero fans, or maybe even a mecha anime fan if you got time to kill.  Really, anyone simply looking for an animated show with a good, developed story and a memorable cast characters should check it out.",1272412800,14,2116,4.69811320754717
4075188,5,B00368PSIM,"- Pepper Potts, grousing: ""I've got homework and finals and chores and my dad and... Team Iron Man. Research! Reconnaisance! Support! We're stuck doing all the work and Tony gets to do all the fun stuff!""
- Rhodey: ""He almost got killed last week!""
- Pepper: ""See?!""

What?! All 26 episodes of Season One in one DVD collection? After deploying several six-episode DVD releases for IRON MAN: ARMORED ADVENTURES, the corporate powers-that-be get with the program, and, oh, me so likee! Iron Man sits on top of the world right now, having repulsor-rayed the wallcrawler and the Dark Knight off the head of the table. Robert Downey, Jr. gets mucho credit. Jon Favreau gets leftover credit. Matt Fraction and Salvador Larroca, on the comic book side of things, are handling their business. And this cartoon is not at all shabby. But have you gotten over the animated show's reinterpretation of Tony Stark as a teenager yet? I got over it in ten seconds.

On one hand, we miss out on Stark's legendary carousing. This Tony brings the acne much more than he brings the sexy. On the other hand, some things sort of remain the same. Teen Tony still grapples with that heart ailment, although this time he incurs it when the jet plane he and his dad were on got exploded. Tony ends up with a heart implant that regularly requires charging.

Gone also is Tony's mammoth guilt over being a weapons merchant. It's Obadiah Stane who's weaponizing each of the Starks' inventions. And, with Tony being a teen and this being a kid's show, there's no chance the show will ever introduce Tony's other albatross, his crippling alcoholism. So what we're left with is this sixteen-year-old engineering prodigy who had designed his armor not out of sheer desperate necessity but because he was trying to outdo his inventor father. When his father dies, Tony decides to don the armor and fight crime, easy as pie. You can see how this origin doesn't resonate quite as deeply as Stan Lee's take. Young Tony Stark comes off as Peter Parker-lite (the SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN incarnation, that is). Which, okay, isn't a bad thing.

Also getting the teen treatment are Tony's friends Rhodey and energetic chatterbox Pepper Potts, as well as Happy Hogan, now rendered a dimwitted jock. Thankfully, Stane remains a baldy-domed adult, still very calculating and sinister. With the passing of his father, Tony inherits the family business and would like to get more involved in it, except that CEO Stane isn't about to let him get a whiff of running the vast Stark International empire. Enmity, established.

Gene Khan is introduced early on, and he's not exactly your typical teen. He manages to befriend Tony Stark. To backtrack a bit, Tony's dad had been obsessed with the fabled Chinese Makluan rings, which supposedly contain great mystical power. Gene Khan means to collect these rings and believes the diary of Tony's father to be a means to this goal. So, yeah, he buddies up to Tony. The pursuit of the Makluan rings becomes a running plot element in Season One.

Like Peter in SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN, Tony juggles high school and crimefighting, and we've seen all this before, including the bit about Tony's missing or cutting classes, or as Pepper remarks to Rhodey: ""I know I just met Tony, but he's been in the bathroom... a really long time."" There's an interesting twist, too, in that Tony before had only had private tutors, so public schooling is something that's very new and sometimes cryptic to him.

The big draw for me was in checking out the young shellhead going up against his hi-tech rogue's gallery. Iron Man's cast of bad guy heavy hitters pops up (Stane, Mandarin, Crimson Dynamo), and these cats have recurring roles. CGI-wise, IRON MAN: ARMORED ADVENTURES reminds me of past shows like MAX STEEL, ROUGHNECKS - THE STARSHIP TROOPERS CHRONICLES, and MTV's SPIDER-MAN: THE NEW ANIMATED SERIES. It's cool animation, but there are a few times when the graphics go wonky, as if the onscreen product were actually some unfinished, preliminary-staged work. Sometimes, it feels like there's no depth or weight to what we're seeing. But the CGI shines whenever Iron Man is doing his thing, and the action is always explosive and kinetic. The designs on Iron Man and his supervillains really look great (Whiplash, Blizzard, the Crimson Dynamo, and my favorite looks: Killer Shrike and Unicorn). So, again, if you can get past Tony as a teen - and I remember that it didn't go over well years ago in the comic book, either - and if you can forgive the at times (but not too often) shady animation, then this may be your huckleberry. The storytelling is sharp. The dialogue is believable and will often crack you up. There's fantastic continuity to the thing, a feel that the overarching story is being advanced. Another cool thing is that, like WOLVERINE & THE X-MEN, there are 26 episodes in this Season One, most of them pretty damn great. Marvel heroes tend to be neighborly and so Iron Man runs into a number of familiar characters: Black Panther, Nick Fury & S.H.I.E.L.D., and the Hulk. I'm pretty curious about one intriguing development, which is Tony's friendship with Whitney Stane, daughter of Obadiah Stane. And, oh yeah, sometime very late in Season One: War Machine. So cue Black Sabbath... Or not.

IRON MAN: ARMORED ADVENTURES: The Complete First Season comes in four discs. Bonus features are whatever: 4 ""Suit Profiles"" which detail various properties of the Iron Man armor; Rooney's music video of the show's theme song; ""A Day in the Life"" - a brief TV spot of Iron Man promoting THE SUPERHERO SQUAD SHOW; Storyboard Galleries (""Seeing Red"" & ""Pepper, Interruted"" - these are kinda hard to make out unless you have a gynormous TV screen); Original Sketches of characters, of various Iron Man armors, and of this and that vehicle (the Helicarrier, the A.I.M. tank, etc.); and trailers for IRON MAN: ARMORED ADVENTURES, WOLVERINE AND THE X-MEN, THE SUPERHERO SQUAD SHOW, and MarvelKidsdotcom.

And because I'm thinking this review is still not long enough, here are the episode breakdowns. Some PLOT SPOILERS now:

- Episodes 1 & 2 - ""Iron Forged in Fire, Parts 1 & 2"" - The origin story which goes into the murder of Tony's father, Obadiah Stane's usurping of Stark International, and the genesis of Iron Man. Also, Tony meets Pepper Potts and then tries to get a word in.

- Episode 3 - ""Secrets and Lies"" - When the Maggia abducts Gene Khan, the step-son of a Chinese importer, Tony and Pepper also get taken.

- Episode 4 - ""Cold War"" - Iron Man partners up with Blizzard to take down common foe Obadiah Stane. But it doesn't take Tony too long to realize that Blizzard is seriously wackadoo.

- Episode 5 - ""Whiplash"" - Investigating the assault on her hospitalized FBI dad, Pepper bites off more than she can chew and runs into the deadly Whiplash.

- Episode 6 - ""Iron Man Vs. the Crimson Dynamo"" - Two years ago, the Russian cosmonaut codenamed the Crimson Dynamo was abandoned while out on a space mission. Today, he's back on Earth, and he's miffed, brother, miffed!

- Episode 7 - ""Meltdown"" - Tony quits school and decides to expend his energies being Iron Man, 24/7. He runs into the Living Laser.

- Episode 8 - ""Field Trip"" - Tony skulks into Stark International in an untested prototype armor that then malfunctions, forcing Tony to abandon it. He then must sneak back into the facility to retrieve the faulty suit before Stane finds it. But how to do that? Answer: school field trip? I dig the heist element in which Pepper's plan totally falls apart, forcing the kids to desperately improvise. First appearance of Whitney Stane, by the way.

- Episode 9 - ""Ancient History 101"" - In the quest for the ancient Makhuan Rings, Team Iron Man (and Gene) must pass the test of wisdom. But the stone Dreadknight statues which guard one of the Makhuan Rings come to life and they do not grade on a curve.

- Episode 10 - ""Ready, A.I.M., Fire"" - At a school science fair Tony is bamboozled into working for A.I.M. and into developing a mind-to-machine interface technology. What he does is create a new supervillain.

- Episode 11 - ""Masquerade"" - Iron Man is framed for crimes being committed by the illusion-casting Madame Masque, but her true motives aren't what Tony expects.

- Episode 12 - ""Seeing Red"" - The Crimson Dynamo returns as Stane and Project Pegasus team up to capture Iron Man, whose power levels are down to 3%. It's Rhodey and Pepper (in her own ridiculous ""costume"") to the rescue. Tony also creates the virus Technovore which then gains sentience.

- Episode 13 - ""Hide and Seek"" - When Tony and Gene Khan unearth the third Makluan Ring in a temple in Greenland, Tony undergoes the cryptic Test of Courage, going up against both the Mandarin and the third Ring's unstoppable guardian, Ultimo. Meanwhile, Rhodey is super-ticked off that he and Pepper were left out of the loop again.

- Episode 14 - ""Man and Iron Man"" - Mister Fix, still up to nefarious tricks. His superpowered henchman, an upgraded Whiplash, introduces a virus in Tony's armor which begins to eff it up from the inside out. The corrupted and suddenly self-aware Iron Man programming soon regards Rhodey and Pepper as threats.

- Episode 15 - ""Panther's Prey"" - In pursuit of an international criminal Iron Man runs afoul of the elegant but prickly Black Panther who desires neither team-up nor even some moments to share anecdotes. The monarch of Wakanda has set his eyes on Iron Man's prey and young Shellhead had better step back. Now that's just rude.

- Episode 16 - ""Fun with Lasers"" - The Living Laser holds the world hostage with a destructive space weapon and all dude wants is a rematch with Iron Man. Also, General Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. throws in his two cents (To quote Rhodey: ""Nick Fury's a jerk!""). Check out Tony's cool black & gold space armor. And I like that Tony wins the day by resorting to Your Momma insults.

- Episode 17 - ""Chasing Ghosts"" - The Ghost, all vanishy and untouchable, goes hunting for Tony Stark and instantly becomes one of Iron Man's toughest foes. I smiled a lot at the way this problem was resolved.

- Episode 18 - ""Pepper, Interrupted"" - The turf war episode. With the Mandarin so focused on obtaining the Makluan Rings, Maggia is threatening to expand into the Tong's territory. Pepper and Gene are assigned to work on a report and this, wouldn't you just know it, soon places Pepper in danger. Can Gene rescue her without revealing his secret identity? What's up with the hi-tech Black Knight? Plus, detention for everyone.

- Episode 19 - ""Technovore"" - Tony is tapped to fix the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier's failing engines, and Pepper is all kinds of ecstatic to be onboard the helicarrier. Meanwhile, Tony's computer virus creation, called the Technovore - that was supposed to self-destruct a while ago after it took care of Project Pegasus - resurfaces and it exists to consume technology. It's up to Rhodey (borrowing the Iron Man gauntlet) to save the day.

- Episode 20 - ""World on Fire"" - Tony, Rhodey, and Pepper locate the fourth Makluan Ring inside a not that dormant volcano, but the Firebrand guardian initiates the Test of Temperance by possessing Rhodey and forcing him to battle Iron Man. Elsewhere, Gene seethes at being left out.

- Episode 21 - ""Designed Only For Chaos"" - A dying Living Laser is abducted from the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier by A.I.M. and used as a power source for the Mental Organism Designed Only for Conquest (M.O.D.O.C.). Iron Man finds himself defenseless against MODOC's mental assault.

- Episode 22- ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"" - Happy Hogan finds the Iron Man armor and dons the thing (even though he believes Iron Man to be a robot), and then stumbles onto a sinister Maggia plot that threatens the city. To save the day, Tony pretends to be the armor's robot voice and tries to talk Happy into effectively using the armor, all the while trying to keep Happy in the dark about his secret identity.

- Episode 23 - ""Uncontrollable"" - The Controller! Rick Jones! The Hulk! Iron Man! Oh it's on and poppin'! Two classic comments from the Hulk: ""Stupid metal man fight Hulk! Hulk smash metal man!"" and ""Pepper talk a lot.""

- Episode 24 - ""Best Served Cold"" - Wearing the experimental face of Madame Masque results in Whitney falling gravely ill. Tony, asked to help by Obadiah Stane, armors up for a flight to the Arctic for a possible cure. But Blizzard awaits, and he's still pretty unstable (read: cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs). Check out Iron Man's arctic armor.

- Episode 25 - ""Tales of Suspense: Part One"" - Gene's stepfather, Zheng, having regained control of the Tong, abducts Gene, Tony, and Pepper and forces Tony to disclose the location of the fifth Ring (which happens to be the lost Peruvian city of Machu Piccu). There, Tony and Gene are sent to retrieve the ring and must face the fifth guardian of the Rings, the malevolent ancient Chinese dragon Fin Fang Foom. To save his friends, Rhodey does what we've been waiting for all season: he suits up in the War Machine armor.

- Episode 26 - ""Tales of Suspense: Part Two"" - This is it! An all-out melee with Iron Man and War Machine versus Zheng and the Mandarin!",1272153600,7,13212,4.742483660130719

It features Rhodey and Pepper Potts as Stark's sidekicks who assist him in class and with saving the day. The story shifts mainly from Stark having to deal with Obadiah Stane and Gene Khan who's trying to fulfill his destiny of being the Mandarin. At times, the show can be intriguing especially when you see Stark fight a popular Iron Man villain such as Whiplash or team up with fellow Avenger, the Hulk. Then sometimes it can drag just a bit such as the episodes where Stark helps Kahn in his ring-finding journeys.

4075209,5,B00368PSIM,"Though short lived this series was a nice reboot to the Ironman story.  Basically Tony Stark is now a teenager using his Ironman technology to gain back control of Stark Industries.  I won't say much more so as not to spoil any plot lines but suffice it to say a few arch enemies are also now the children of some evil person.

Nice touch as it probably relates to the kids better.  Definitely makes for an interesting Ironman based story line.

Animation is a bit ""computer generated"" looking, switching from excessively detailed shots to some that are more akin to a modern video game.  This seems to be a common theme with many cartoons/anime lately, not bad but annoying to some.

The second season definitely ends as if more episodes were to follow but apparently the series was canceled before any were made.",1376352000,,814,4.65034965034965
4075210,5,B00368PSIM,"I think the people involved did a terrific job in adapting Iron Man for this series!  Yeah, one could quibble about some minor things, but I've really enjoyed these younger versions of classic characters. I dig the idealism of their all - for - one, one - for - all Three Musketeering, the sometimes hero/sometimes villainy of Whitney and Gene.  I especially love the graphic design/animation of the new versions  of classic villains as well as the direction of the episodes - lotsa' well choreographed action with great use of everybody's powers.  I'm probably bound to be disappointed by season 2, but that's ok.  It's a great feeling when your expectations are exceeded.

4075212,5,B00368PSIM,"I love this show. I love seeing Iron Man as a teenager. And it's a great story. It's not boring or cheesy, and it doesn't survive on shallow humor like a lot of cartoons nowadays. It has a nice blend of story, humor, and action. The CGI takes a little getting used to if you're used to traditional cartoons. But it's worth it, and I don't know why you wouldn't enjoy this show.",1354752000,,377,4.178082191780822

4075214,5,B00368PSIM,"I don't normally post reviews but for this I am making an exception. If you have an Iron Man lover at home this is truly a must have.  We absolutely had to buy this once the kids became addicted to the awesomeness that is Iron Man season 1 ... ;D  It has a catchy theme song, great story line, and the animation is quite good. My kids truly LOVE this show and ask for it daily so I highly recommend it to everyone.  Seriously... If your kids are superhero fanatics this has to be on the shelf.

I bought mine used, the sleeve which is just a cover and not important anyway was torn slightly and quite shelf worn & crumpled ... But the actual DVD case was pristine and the DVDs were in perfect condition. For a grand total of 12 bucks I am not complaining one bit! In fact I am thrilled at such a great deal.",1333238400,,807,4.056603773584905
4075215,5,B00368PSIM,"These are great DVD's! My son loves them and to be honest, as an avid Iron Man fan, I love them.  Great music, great stories and I love the play all option.",1328745600,,156,3.875
4075216,4,B00368PSIM,"I don't know why they only made the 1st 6 episodes on blu-ray, when the whole season runs 26 episodes...

Stupid if you ask me.

Anyway, IRONMAN: A A is an Awesome Show. It combines the Old Comics and the New Movies, with a fresh-perspective of Tony Stark in his Teenage Years.

Why they didn't call it ""Iron Teen"", I DONT KNOW... He's not a 'MAN' yet...

They Show is awesome. It's made for kids, using a 3D-CGI/Cartoon Animation combo, kinda like FUTURAMA does.

I'm 26 and I love the designs of the suit, the new weapons, the story and conflicts, etc....

GREAT SHOW. BUY IT.

Unless you have VERY LOUD out-of-control kids, who like to turn up the Volume on their TVs (this show has a loud opening/closing theme song) But, it
only lasts for like, a minute each, so, it's up to you if you wanna put up with it. Just don't be surprised if the song gets stuck in your head.",1328313600,,873,4.286585365853658

4075218,5,B00368PSIM,"My sons (2 and 4) love Ironman, but all the other series and movies are either too violent or creepy for toddlers. This is a perfect middle ground. This Ironman is in high school and although the same bad guys are present, they are not quite as evil looking as in the other movies/series.",1318636800,7,288,4.351851851851852
4075219,4,B00368PSIM,"If ever there was a series I planned to go into with anticipated disappointment, it would be Iron Man: Armored Adventures.  After all, the idea of taking a mature, long-standing comic franchise and retooling it so that the hero(s) and villains are in high school rarely stands the test of time.  On the other hand, Marvel's animated history with the Iron Man franchise has been less than stellar.  The 1990s animated series (which finally earned a licensed DVD release by the way) was certainly a mixed bag and the Marvel Lion's Gate (MLG) animated feature Invincible Iron Man was quite abysmal.

Then I learned that the guys responsible for this one were actually many of the same individuals who had succeeded in ""younging up"" Xavier's mutants in X-Men: Evolution and more recently, did the pretty solid Wolverine and the X-Men series.  I rolled the dice and ordered the first two releases of the show on DVD (which totaled the first 13 episodes of Season 1).

When his industrialist father Howard Stark disappears in a plane crash after refusing to weaponize the Earth Mover at Obadiah Stane's behest, 16-year-old genius Tony develops the high-tech suit of armor we all know and love.

The series follows the adventures of teenage child prodigy Tony Stark and his alter ego Iron Man. As Iron Man, he uses his technological inventions to stop villains at all hours of the day/ night, even it makes it extremely difficult to attend classes and keep up his grades. His friends, James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes and Patricia ""Pepper"" Potts know of his secret life and help him  (either directly or by covering for him) on his perilous adventures.

Driving the show is the suspicion that Stane had been involved in his father's death, Tony divides what free time he has conducting an investigation of his own while battling such staple villains as Mandarin, Mr. Fix, Whiplash, A.I.M., Madame Masque, Living Laser, the Maggia, Firebrand, Controller, Crimson Dynamo, Blizzard, Killer Shrike, Unicorn, M.O.D.O.K. and the like.

As is the trend these days, the piece is 3D cell-shaded CGI entirely, with a distinctive look that, contrary to the cover art of the DVDs, is actually quite moody and muted, almost washed out, in its presentation.  Considering that Marvel's animated works are often overly bright and kid-friendly by nature, Iron Man: Armored Adventure's grittier pallet is certainly a welcome change and goes a long way in counteracting the upbeat high-school angle introduced here.

Pacing is pretty spot on, with episodes that each act as stand-alone affairs with just enough of a serial element in the background to establish a nice ongoing arc.  Dynamically, the formula proves quite similar to past shows Batman Beyond, Static Shock, and perhaps most closely, the aforementioned X-Men: Evolution.  Whether you find yourself for or against the concept of taking an established comic property and scaling it to work in the high school setting, at least go in knowing that the production team behind Animated Adventures seems to have mastered the art (and actually tuned the material quite flawlessly in the process).

It should be noted that there are a few staples to the mythos only touched upon here (and in some cases omitted altogether).  Among these is the relationship between Tony's artificial heart and the suit of armor.  Also traditionally, Tony's parents were accidentally killed in a car crash, whereas in this series, Tony's father, Howard Stark, disappears in the first episode in a plane crash suggesting Howard's death.  Tony also injures his heart in this crash, as opposed to being injured by an explosion in war. Tony invents the Iron Man armor at home. In previous incarnations, Tony invented a beta version of the suit to escape after being captured due to the trap explosion leaving him defenseless.  All minor changes to be sure.

Which brings up a slight complaint about the domestic DVD releases thus far.  Early adopters were forced to buy two individual releases episodes 1-6 then 7-13.  Now the entire 26-episode release of the first season has arrived leaving those of us who purchased the first two releases little choice but to buy all 26 just to have access to the final 13.  But in all, a minor compliant- Had it been confirmed that this, the 26-spiode box set would be coming I certainly would have held off for it and if you are someone who has been on the fence about getting involved in the show, this is the best way to do so!

The second season is still airing at the time of this review's writing and here's hoping Vivendi Entertainment sees fit to release a complete 26-episode second season after its broadcast run as well.

These days the news is that Marvel Anime: Iron Man will be the next big thing to hit the USA (coming later this year).  As everyone seems to be preparing for that show's arrival, there's a good chance Iron Man: Armored Adventures will get lost to the proverbial shuffle: A shame considering to date it is perhaps the most impressive animated incarnation of ol ""shell head"".",1314144000,,5040,4.9
4075220,4,B00368PSIM,Juvenile Ironman is pretty ok. Does a fair job walking the line between adult and kid entertainment. I looked forward to watching the next episode.,1312588800,,147,4.92
4075221,5,B00368PSIM,"I first saw this show when the first 6 episodes were on Netflix. I tried it out with my son and we were hooked by the end of the first episode, so we just had to get the whole season.

For kids:
This show is perfect for a young boy who likes action but you still want to shelter a bit. There is no ""butt-kicking"" (just tail-kicking). Nothing ""sucks"" (it stinks). Nobody dies, including bad guys. Plenty of explosions and action scenes each episode. And the themes in this show are all things you can talk with your kids about, like ""Why should Tony stay in school"" or ""Why are weapons bad?"".

For parents:
The dialog and voice acting is great. There are good jokes your kids can't get. My husband loves the animation. The story is easy enough for a kid to get, but very entertaining for adults as well. (And, being of the female persuasion, I can't wait until Season 2 so Tony and Pepper can maybe get together.)

I highly recommend this show for anyone looking for something safe and fun for their son or grandson to watch.",1304640000,4,1024,4.350785340314136
4075222,5,B00368PSIM,"My 2 year old is in love with this version of Iron Man, highly recommended. Once he watched this on Netflix no other version would do, so we had to by both Season 1 and 2.

He absolutely loved it and wouldn't give it up after 4 weeks of having to renew it so I knew I had to order his own copy. Anyway, I am so happy w/ it as this is the complete season - I was waiting forever at the library for the other episodes to become available - I guess it's quite popular for all the kids now a days. Also got Iron Man as an adult version too - as that was the version I purchased without knowing the difference. Anyway, I'm very happy to have made this 'mistake' as my son knows the difference and depending on his mood, he'll watch either version - of Tony Stark as a teenager or as an adult. On the side, I love the teenage version of Iron Man as it includes a great theme song that all 3 of my kids sing along to.",1281744000,,840,3.8333333333333335

As an adult, I'd probably give it 4 stars.  For my son I give 5 and for what it is (aimed at teenagers) they really hit the mark.
A hardcore comics fan (as I once was) may likely be turned off by the fact that the character (Tony, Pepper, Rhodey, Mandarin, etc.) are all tennagers and he show is aimed at young adults, but if you can get over that, the plot gets fairly involved, with various continuing storylines and well-thought-out  guest appearances by villians (& a few heroes) that you'll recognize from the ""Marvel Universe.""",1278806400,,644,4.495726495726496
