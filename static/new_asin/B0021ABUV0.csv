3831418,1,B0021ABUV0,"I watched season 1 of Gokusen online, and I really enjoyed it (Matsumoto Jun and Oguri Shun...plus a few other recognizable actors and actresses ;p).  I wanted a copy for myself so that I could watch it at my leisure, so I bought this product.  Two words: TERRIBLE SUBTITLES!  And I mean TERRIBLE.  No English-speaking individual, whether it is their first or second or third language, speaks such poor English.  I understand some Japanese, so I can figure out what's going on, but what's the point of suffering through it all?  I was not able to enjoy this product at all.  I bought an original copy on eBay, and the English subtitles on that product are great.  If you want a quality product, buy Gokusen on eBay.  Seriously.",1264896000,15,727,4.6171875
3831419,4,B0021ABUV0,"Love the story but the sub-titles.. well they are very poor. In the sub-titles there were a lot of typos and mistranslations but it got the general point across. I gave it 4 stars for the story, acting, and the enjoyment I got from watching it,yes even with the poor sub-titles. If you are looking for anime that is kind of the same I would suggest Great Teacher Onizuka which also had a live drama series and a movie.",1264464000,,418,4.30379746835443
3831420,5,B0021ABUV0,"This product includes all three parts:
Part 1: creative, lovely stories, nice ending
Part 2: more lovely characters and pleasant stories with a nice, new ending
Part 3: though the characters are interesting and I liked it a lot, all episodes ended in the same scenario which made it a bit just a bit dull 
My final recommendation: it was worth it to buy and watch it.",1255910400,,367,4.477611940298507
3831421,1,B0021ABUV0,"No, that is not a typo.  The story itself is fine.  Teacher is teaching the worse male students.  Has to cover the fact that she is a member of a gangster family.  That is the main plot of all three seasons and it is pretty funny.  I have the anime and have been reading the translations of the online manga.  But...
The subtitles of the first season suck.  Badly.  The farther you get into the season the worse they get.
Then you hit the second season and things got strange.  What was translated was pretty well done.  The subtitles, when they were there, were OK.  But sometimes there was no subtitles and the timing was bad.  Subtitles would be for the scene before or after the scene you were watching.  Or a whole scene would go on without one subtitle.  That does not sound so bad BUT the second season DVDs also started to skip, freeze, or could not be read at all by my DVD player or my Playstation 2.  I tried both to see if it may have been the DVD player itself.  True, the second season DVDs have take outs and extras, but even those had bad subtitles.
And the third season was all those problems combined.  I had problems getting around the menu and in fact I had to skip episodes.  I gave up on the final episode because I refused to waste any more time and energy on it.  I doubt it was any different from the last two final episodes anyway.
Find the episodes online - they always have better subtitles because fans are willing to work at it for other fans.  Make sure to give them support and, sometimes, some funding.  DO NOT BUY THESE DVDS.",1254614400,25,1559,4.252559726962457

8348828,5,B0021ABUV0,"I never read the the books or saw the toons for this show, but Ireally enjoyed this series. It also helps that I know some of the other actors through all three seasons of the show.",1374278400,,181,4.055555555555555
8348829,3,B0021ABUV0,Don't get me wrong i love this series but I had issues with the subs. Also the video quality is very choppy and some of the videos are not subbed correctly.,1366761600,,156,4.064516129032258
8348830,2,B0021ABUV0,"Of the four DVDs in the set, the subtitle option does not work at all and the other two there is no way to turn the subtitles off so I'm stuck looking at chinese ideographs or broken english.  I tried the english subtitles and the translations are not only poor but the names are all some sort of chinese translation - as if the translation is of chinese origin where they put the script in some sort of translator software rather than a native speaker writing/correcting the english.  The quality of the shows is second rate as things go in and out of focus quite often.  As a student of Japanese language I don't need the subtitles but for those viewers that have no commend of the Japanese language it may be very disappointing.  For $25 it's worth it for me as a language tool but for others that cannot understand Japanese it may be very disappointing.",1363996800,,857,4.439490445859873
8348831,5,B0021ABUV0,"You get all seasons for $30!! Subtitles are horrible, but if you don't need subtitles, you should get this one. One season is >$100 in Japan.",1332115200,,141,4.461538461538462
8348832,3,B0021ABUV0,"I don't know if this product comes the same distributor, but the English subs are really bad, and if so ALL the sellers should notify potential buyers. The video quality is good on most of the disks and delivery was quick. If you don't need the subs its a good deal for three seasons.",1294358400,7,284,4.277777777777778
8348833,5,B0021ABUV0,"I didn't really know any of the actors on this show, but now I am hooked!  I love each charactor on this show and cried several time.  Also, this is really a good deal.  3 seasons 12 episodes each for less than $30.  I am not sure if the English translation was accurate (b/c I don't need the subtitle), but the quality of the DVD is good compared to other China made J-drama DVDs such as SP.",1278288000,,392,4.0519480519480515
8348834,1,B0021ABUV0,"Whoever wrote the subtitles for this knew very little english. ""Terriable"" instead of ""terrible"", ""crowed"" instead of ""coward"", ""walk"" instead of ""go"", ""I am so ashameful"", and a constant use of ""fro"". If you are buying this for the english subtitles, it's not worth it.",1272844800,3,270,5.022222222222222
8348835,4,B0021ABUV0,This was very funny. The quality was ok and it was sent very quickly. No issues.,1265155200,,80,4.0625
