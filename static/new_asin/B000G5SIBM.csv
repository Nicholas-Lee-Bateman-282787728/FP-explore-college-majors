2600086,5,B000G5SIBM,"Once in a while a documentary sheds such inner light on the subject matter and the characters that it becomes an art film, a story, a novel, a memento.  Such is the case with BALLET RUSSES.  This tender, touching, humorous, and exactingly real look at the history of ballet in the hands of the expatriated Russians in Europe in the early part of the 20th century to the reformation of the troop after the death in 1929 by master Impresario Diaghilev  unfolds through the words and movements of those who experienced it.

To say too much about the content would be like telling each member of a conversation group the essence before the topic unfolds.  Suffice it to say that here are the dancers, choreographers, composers, artists creating the sets and costumes who produced the contemporary standard for ballet that still exist today.  To have the joy of watching Massine, Balanchine, Lichine, Markova, Krassovska, Danilova, Riabouchinska, Platt, Zoritch, Franklin and the designs of Picasso, Dali, Laurencin, etc is more than a visual treat: it is a step into a history of creativity the likes of which we may never see again.

The real joy of this rich film is the conversations and, yes, dance movements of the surviving members of this troop and those who admired it.  It is full of touching moments and memorable sequences that easily place this documentary in the top of the list of works in this genre,  Grady Harp, September 06",1158451200,10,1437,4.808943089430894

Then the artist speaks as they are today, it is quite amazing!!  They still have such style and grace.

2600099,5,B000G5SIBM,"These three Tchaikovsky ballets constitute the backbone of the classic 19th century ballet idiom. To the non-ballet world they are about the only names known. Two of them, Swan Lake and Nutcracker were failures when first presented and took years and reworked choreography to be accepted. Only the middle one Sleeping Beauty was a success from it's premiere. At the Bolshoi in 1877, Swan Lake's initial failure was due to lack-luster choreography of Wenzel Reisinger. (A child's version of Swan Lake had been written years before for Tchaikovsky's family's children).  A new choreography by Joseph Hansen in 1882 led to 41 performances. Tchaikovsky died in 1893 before seeing a successful revision presented at the Marinski in St Petersburg with choreography by Lev Ivanov (acts 2 & 4) and the great master, Maurice Petipa (acts 1 &3).
The current production at the Royal Opera House London was created by Anthony Dowell premiered in 1947. This present recording was made in March 2009.
For this production, Dowell incorporates sections usually omitted currently from the 1895 Ivanov - Petipa score. Thus the ballet is somewhat longer and the story is filled in with more detail. One change is the cross-bow for hunting the swans is not a gift of ma-ma and another you will note is the children that enter with Odette in act 2. Dowell has also updated the action from Medieval times of the E.T.A. Hoffmann's original tale to the 1880's of Tchaikovsky's era. It all seems to work quite well and the extravagant d&eacute;cor and costumes are quite beautiful. But all would be naught if the soloists and corps were not up to par. They are good; they are superb!
In my dozens of recordings of Swan Lake very few are as satisfactory as the magnificent performance by Marianela Nunez. She is phenomenal! Her arms are like liquid waves; she talks with her fingers and eyes. It is truly magical. I know her work from several other roles. Whether she is the cold, frosty Queen of the Wilis in Giselle or the betrayed Odette in Swan Lake she IS that part.
A special nod and thank you to the corps of the Royal Ballet; they really act as a unit.

The Sleeping Beauty is a fairytale by Charles Perault  and had the good fortune to have Petipa as choreographer (with Vsevozhsky ) and of course the music of Tchaikovsky. It opened at the Marinsky in January 1890 and was a firm success.
It is less dramatic and is filled with character dances and ensembles of great variety as is the Nutcracker.
The main character is Princess Aurora. In this lavish production from the Royal London premiered in February 1946 she is here  danced by one of the most beautiful looking and superb dancing ballerinas of the day, the Romanian star Alina Cojocaru. She is a pleasure to look at and enthralling to watch dance. The corps is also great as the Royal always is. Recorded in 2006.

The Nutcracker is another tale of E.T.A. Hoffmann. It was commissioned after the success of Sleeping Beauty and had the choreography of Lev Ivanov done from detailed plans of Maurice Petipa (who was ill) for the Marinsky. The music was by Tchaikovsky. It opened in December 1892  and was not well received by the first public. The critics said it was too simple and was ""child's play""; which is true. But it is filled with charm and beauty and lovely melodies. No one dies here, no one is betrayed, just a journey to the Kingdom of Sweet and a fun-filled battle with the Mouse King.  Of course today it has become a tradition for children (of all ages) at Christmastime so that dozens of big and smaller companies put it on annually. The Royals version is by Peter Wright and premiered in 20 December 1984.
This version is still fresh and vibrant and the corps really shines. Recorded here in December 2009.

The one thing that I notice here in reviewing these three ballets together as performed by the Royal London is the consistent virtuosity of this company and the soloists. One knows that this company will be up to par before one sees the performance. The is also true for me with the beloved Paris ballet. This is not always found in some other troops.

This album of three great dances makes a great gift!",1415836800,5,4171,4.679399727148704
2600100,5,B000G5SIBM,"I loved it! I wish they had the technology then for filming the dancers that they have now. Still  it was remarkable to see the dancers tell their own story, and what a story it was.",1410912000,,182,4.055555555555555
2600101,5,B000G5SIBM,"The documentary had a very limited run in my area, but appeared at Blockbuster a short time later. I rented it on a recommendation from a ballerina friend who, as a child, studied with one of the principles . I enjoyed it so much that I watched all the special features, which were so informative and fascinating that they took the documentary into a greater realm. I was so enchanted, I watched the whole thing over again the next day. A few years later, I rented it again and enjoyed it just as much.

In any case, the film follows the fate of the two Ballets Russes after the Diaghilev era [ post 1930 ] and features interviews with two of Balanchine's baby ballerinas, in addition to other marvelous dancers, Russian, English and American, who danced with both companies from the glorious opening of the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo, to the lean war, and post-war years.

The filmmakers do an amazing job chronicling everything from the business decisions, choreography, and talent that went into keeping Diaghilev's innovative ballets, sets, costumes, and dances alive. Those ballets were brought to the public in both small towns and large cities across North and South America, and Australia, setting off interest in a public which had never seen ballet, which in turn led to the opening of ballet schools across those three  continents. The interviews with the then living dancers, all in their 80's and 90's--who had huge and delightful personalities, and weren't afraid to gossip, are so insightful and brilliant.

The film offers a marvelous history of the era, the company, and innovative dance in the 20th century. Highly recommended--and if you enjoy it, think about purchasing the dvd-the special features are really worth seeing.",1403740800,4,1746,4.948805460750854

2600103,5,B000G5SIBM,"The film was shot ""just in time"", since it includes extraordinary footage of 90 year old former Ballet Russe dancers reuniting after many years and still showing the traits which made them great in their time. During the next two years, several of these dancers died, so this is a unique tribute to them, with their memories intact, and extensive historical material to show them when they were the legendary ""baby ballerinas"" of an equally legendary troupe. What makes a ballet dancer? What makes a great ballet dancer? Each one is different, but their passion for their art is expressed in every word, every gesture which remains undiminished even today. This is a film which my husband and I (he is a retired Russian ballet dancer), watch over and over again.

2600108,5,B000G5SIBM,"Got this for my professional ballet dancer and instructor wife.  I know everything about ballet from her.  Here's what she says about this surprise Christmas gift for 2013.  The performances were second to none.  Her favorite company is Paris Opera, but she actually had to say that the Royal Ballet's performance of Swan Lake was BETTER than the Paris Opera's blu ray release.  All of the 3 performances were filmed properly, meaning the dancers feet were NOT cut off in the shots.  This is vital to these video releases and many of them are ruined by poor editing and direction from the producers.  The Paris Opera blu ray releases and the Royal Ballet blu ray releases have been good about this.  This collection is truly amazing and had her actually weeping at moments from the superb performances by the dancers.  In her opinion, The Nutcracker in this set was the best performance of it she had ever seen in her life.  That says a lot, she's seen it a thousand times and danced in many herself.  All 3 in this collection are completely astounding and a must for your HD ballet collection..worth every cent.  The costumes and performances in this collection by the Royal Ballet are stunning on blu ray and a great starter for a girls ballet party at your house (dance students).  Also, if you have not yet seen the Royal Ballet's blu ray performance of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, you are in for an unforgettable experience...one of the greatest, unbeatable shows ever.

2600111,5,B000G5SIBM,"This is not only a history of dance after the Diaghilev era (roughly after 1930), but the history of the two companies that continued the tradition of the Ballet Russe in Europe and in America (North and South)and Australia. The two film makers(Goldline and Geller) were therefore right in adding an 'S' two the two words in the title. Most of the participants and stars of the two companies ( the ""Original Ballet Russe"" and the ""Ballet Russe de MonteCarlo"") are interviewed and large extracts of their work are documented and illustrated in the film. This is a beautiful and fascinating history of modern dance and how it evolved in the period before and after the Second World War. No lover of dance should be without it and ,for those who still need to learn, this is an indispensible film to watch. For me, the most precious and delightful elements are the interviews of Frederic Franklin a major star of both companies and a humorous and delightful raconteur who disappeared last summer (2013).

2600119,4,B000G5SIBM,"I am a high school student who is currently studying music history. As a writing assignment for the unit on Russian music, I was instructed to watch this movie and write a review of it. I learned several interesting things from it, but not what I had been expecting to learn.

The title ""Ballets Russes"" is a misnomer. The Ballets Russes was a Russian-managed ballet company based in Paris and formed by Sergei Diaghilev in 1905. The story told in this film begins with that company's dissolution following Diaghilev's death in 1929. ""Ballets Russes"" is mostly concerned with the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo, a successor founded in 1931 by Wassily de Basil and Ren Blum. From there, the film explores the company's turbulent thirty-year history from the perspectives of the now-aged dancers who experienced it. Also included is footage of the young dancers as they performed, giving context to the story being told.

""Ballets Russes"" does a good job of telling its viewers about this history. The story of how the company goes through choreographers, splits itself in half, introduces ballet to small-town America and makes two Hollywood movies is entertaining, and the interviews with the dancers gives it an emotional weight. However, the film doesn't just stick to this subject. Scattered throughout are clips of the dancers as they prepared for a reunion in 2000. These sequences serve to further humanize the dancers and occasionally provide amusing footage, but a few of them probably could have been cut for time.

Another slight flaw in ""Ballets Russes"" is how it focuses almost exclusively on the business angle of the company's history while neglecting to mention details such as the sets and costume designs. For example, the film briefly mentions that artists Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali designed some of the ballets in their distinctive styles. We are only given a brief glance at Dali's work, though, and nothing is shown of Picasso's. A large part of what made the Ballets Russes special was its vibrant sets and costumes, and it seems unwise to overlook that.

There is no musical knowledge to gain from ""Ballets Russes,"" but if you are interested in learning more about the history of ballet or want to see good dancing (which the period footage has plenty of), then I would highly recommend it.",1369526400,,2318,4.966494845360825

I decided to buy this after reading the obituary of Maria Tallchief in the New York Times.  There are current interviews of the artists(current when the documentary was made in 2005 or 2006)which consist of the artists telling their story of the ballet - the people they met, the people they knew and worked for, the dances they helped create, the people they admired and did not care for so much - just wonderful stories. This is interspersed with old movie clips of them dancing, a wonderful way to tell the story.  This is a must-see documentary.

2600122,5,B000G5SIBM,"""Ballet Russes"" (2005) is one of the most moving documentaries I have ever seen...it is a treasure. See it!

The kindness and humanity of the very old dancers interviewed is especially notable. Wonderful people are shown at their best during their very old age. That is inspiring.

USA born dancer Mark Platt was a Ballet Russe dancer star, and he is interviewed. He is age 89 in the documentary.

He danced at age 41 in 1954 in ""Seven Brides For Seven Brothers"" (MGM) movie dance musical starring Howard Keel and Jane Powell.

In that 1954 movie, Mark Platt played ""Brother Daniel Pontepee."" He is now 98 years (in 2012) and still living.

He provides wonderful and extended interview talk during the documentary titled ""Ballet Russe"" (2004) which shows movie clips of Platt dancing in less well known, but still well done MGM musical dance movies from the 1940's and 1950's, and also shows Platt acting at age 89 in a stage production located in the Marin County, California theater center (San Francisco, Calif. suburban area).

Platt was hired for the Ballet Russe company in the late 1930's by Leonoid Massine (who was a ballet star in ""The Red Shoes"" in 1948....he played the cobbler who creates the Red Shoes in which Moira Shearer dances, dances, dances until both she and Red Shoes ballet ends in tragedy. ""The Red Shoes"" 1948 movie is probably the most famous and best ballet movie in all movie history.).

Massine directed the Ballet Russe dance company from the early 1930's through the early 1940's.

Mark Platt was lead dancer in at least one major Massine choreographed ballet, presented around 1937.

His part of the documentary is especially interesting and important to USA movie dance musical history enthusiasts like me.

He was 41 when he danced and acted in ""Seven Brides For Seven Brothers"" (1954), and was by far the ""oldest brother"" in that movie, otherwise made up of men in their 20's and teens (the 5 male dancers who portrayed ""brothers"" who married the 7 brides).

See the ""Ballet Russe"" (2004) documentary about the Ballet Russe dance company founded during the WWI era and not disbanded until 1962. Mark Platt was a member of the Ballet Russe in the 1930's and possibly in the 1940's before his MGM movie dancer/ actor contract days.

The documentary shows a wonderful reunion of very old Ballet Russe dancers held in 2000, with many dancers interviewed and movie footage of their dancing during their ballet dancer days half a century and more earlier.

2600132,4,B000G5SIBM,"I saw this company first in 1947, and followed them for about ten years.  They were my introduction to ballet, and the dancers I remember were Alexandra Danilova, Natalie Krassovska, Frederic Franklin, and Nicolas Magellanes.  Others came -- Ruthanna Boris, Mia Slavenska, Nina Novak -- but my memory of ballet is full of these early performances and those early dancers.  It is inspiring to see them in this film, as full of love for their art as they were when performing.
  There is one area where I disagre slightly.  I remember Nina Novak in the chorus, and she had charisma.  You watched her.  When she was given more important roles, you continued to watch her.  What she did in her private life was irrelevant; she drew the eye.
  This is a must-see for every lover of ballet who is curious about how it started in America, and became the center of interest that it holds today.

Daniel Geller & Dayna Goldfine do an excellent job of putting an entire history of one of the world's greatest ballet company's to ever exist. We see interviews of the actual dancers talk about themselves as well as the history of Ballets Russes... along with actual footage of them dancing the ballets themselves.

The focus of this documentary also includes other topics as well like the founders of Ballet Russes, the choreographers, the set and costume designers and so on it. This dvd documentary is quite engaging and flows great from start to finish.

2600135,5,B000G5SIBM,"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this DVD or not.  The only reason I did was to find out some basic background information which I needed in writing a paper.  After it was over, I found myself amazed and wanting to find out even more about the Ballet Russe and wishing I could have seen them at their prime.

The basic components of this DVD are archival footage of the actual Ballets, pictures of individuals involved with them, and interview sessions with a handful, maybe two handfuls, of surviving dancers who are well into their 80s.

Granted, I needed to take a break halfway through because there is a lot to digest in this DVD, as soon as you press play, it is very engrossing.  It is amazing to see how passionate these people are about dance, what they had to go through, the ups and downs, the different dance companies.  You really find yourself affected by their stories.

It was even more personal to me because I have actually seen and touched many of these costumes.  Having worked at a museum there was an entire wall in one of the storage rooms devoted to the Ballet Russe.  And just seeing the names of the ballets brought back many memories.

You don't have to be a fan of the ballet to enjoy this DVD.  There is so much history and footage, any old movie buff or historian would enjoy it.",1204588800,,1313,4.362139917695473

2600137,5,B000G5SIBM,"This is not only an excellent history of the Ballets Russes after Diaghilev.  It is also a touching meditation on the vibrancy and enthusiasm of youth as it is reflected by the mature personality as it stands at the threshold of the beyond.  A number of the radiant artists who were interviewed by the highly gifted film makers, Geller and Goldfine, had passed on by the time this documentary was released.  What a gift of foresight to have captured these beautiful, lively and animated artists, juices fully flowing, as they recalled the liminal era in which modern art exploded on the scene.

You only have to scan the other reviews to see with what love this film was received.  Ballets Russes is a precious document of an unforgettable era in the history of art.  If you are touched by these artists and want a wonderful little surprise, look at the DVD Black Tights/Bolshoi 67.  Like a treat in a Cracker Jack box, this otherwise dull (to me) DVD has as an afterthought a 10 minute experimental dance film called Spring Night, choreographed by David Lichine of Colonel de Basil's Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo.

If you enjoyed the beautiful and unique dancing of the artists of the Ballets Russes, you will thrill to see this gem, Spring Night, danced and envisioned in the style of the Diaghilev tradition.  Why this short is almost non-existent is a mystery.  Once you see it, you'll achieve even greater insight into this now extinct tradition.

Another treasure from this artistic era is Max Reinhardt's Midsummer Night's Dream with Nini Theilade, a Ballets Russes star.

2600139,5,B000G5SIBM,"My review of Gaite Parisienne states the time and place when I was lucky enough to attend live performances of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. I say ""lucky enough"" because the company consisted of performers that have become legends in the classical dance world. I wish I could name them all but I'll never forget Alicia Alonso, Alicia Markova, Alexandra Danilova, Leonide Massine, Frederic Franklin and Igor Youskevich for starters. This DVD brings it all back in detail. Wonderful! I remember when Alicia Alonso went back to Cuba and was never to perform in the U.S.A. again. What a loss for the world of dance. But since that time we have continued to see much of her influence in the Cuban-born dancers who have joined, and are performing with, companies such as the American Ballet Theater. Madame Alonso's school in Cuba has given the world some great male dancers, in particular, who can be compared with the greatest Russian-born dancers on an equal basis. There was a time when good male dancers were in short supply and their purpose was mainly to lend support to the ballerinas. Let me not forget the dance prodigals produced by the school that Igor Youskevich established in New York - I think on Long Island. Most of today's great dancers have been trained using the foundation learned from the Ballet Russes' legendary dancers. They showed audiences what brilliant dancing and choreography could be and left everyone wanting more.

Buy this DVD if you truly would like to learn about greatness, egos, sacrifices for the love art. And the art of dance is precisely what they brought to the world of dance and the audiences who were lucky enough to have experienced their performances.",1185926400,2,1698,4.855172413793103

2600142,4,B000G5SIBM,"I don't generally take much interest in ballet, but I still found this DVD to be absorbing. A ""jete"" is a leap with one foot extended forward, and one foot extended back. And that's just the sort of spanning arc this movie makes. It starts with the formal founding of the Ballet Russe in Monte Carlo in the 1930's, goes through the period when two competing versions of the Ballet Russe existed (thus the plural of this documentary's title), and catches up with the current lives of a number of the Ballet's early dancers.

Some vintage footage of these early dancers is included, some of it even in color. But the fascination here is the dancers themselves, even more than the dance. We see them as young Russian migrs, just children, recruited by Diaghilev in the 30's. Then we see them being interviewed in 2000-2003 for this documentary and we are given a sense of the texture of a lifetime devoted to the art of dance.

The DVD is very generous with its captioning. Everyone is labeled in each dance sequence, and then re-captioned for every current interview, so you can easily keep track of who's who, before-and-after.

It's all a very good advertisement for the practice of ballet and might inspire you to take lessons yourself, because you will see how a majority of the early Ballet Russe dancers are still around in good health, and are still active in ballet, mostly as teachers. One of the dancers was actually still performing ""character"" roles on stage at the time of the interviews.

However, one gets a sense that starring ballet dancers of the 30's and 40's might have been subject to fewer grueling demands than modern dancers. Back then, dancers were perhaps expected to be human perfections of grace, but not superhuman specimens. So there is no discussion here of crippling injuries, of arthritis in the wake of years of command contortion, of struggles to keep reed-thin, of any of the health problems that are whispered about among modern dancers. That's the only major flaw I found in this documentary. These dancers might have been in a unique position to compare training and practice regimens then-and-now, and to give any necessary critiques of modern expectation. But you won't find any such discussion on this DVD.

However the DVD extras do include a lot of behind-the-scenes gossip and do let us get better acquainted with all the featured players. One of the most memorable is Nathalie Krassovska, who unblinkingly, with a dreamy dramatization of each sentence, focuses off beyond the floodlights - still playing to the balconies.",1182038400,7,2565,4.860411899313501
2600143,5,B000G5SIBM,"The Ballet Russe of Serge Diaghilev. Alexandre Benois, Leon Bakst, and many others is important to many lovers of the arts.  For me, as a classical musician, it was vital because of the start it gave Igor Stravinsky, and the famous pieces from Debussy, Ravel, Satie, Poulenc, Prokofiev, and so many others.  For designers, the sets and designs by Benois, Bakst, Picasso, Braque, Dali, and others are still studied and widely admired.  For dancers, this legendary dance company had some of the greatest dancers: Nijinsky, Fokine, Ida Rubenstien, Pavlova, Karsavina, and many others.  However, this film is NOT about this company.  While it refers to this company, it does so only briefly and quite superficially.  This movie is about those companies that were formed out of the original Ballets Russes when Diaghilev died at 57 in 1929.

In 1932, Renee Blum and Colonel Vassily de Basil picked up the sets and pieces of the Ballet Russe, which had stopped performing in 1929, and formed a new company they called the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo.  This movie is the story of the forming of this company, its choreographers, dancers, and its division into two competing companies.

When the new company was first formed, its dances were done by Balanchine, but after one year he was replaced by Leonid Massine who created a vast body of high quality works for the company.  Blum quit the partnership with de Basil in 1936.  In 1938. Massine wanted his own company and he and de Basil reached a compromise where Massine would keep the name Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and de Basil's company would be called ""The Original Ballet Russe"" and kept Massine's dances.  Massine's new backer was Serge Denham who kept the company going at various artistic levels until it stopped performing in 1962.

How all this is told in the movie is fascinating, especially with the vignettes told by of all the dancers.  They are all amazing characters.  While some of them began dancing in the troupe as 14 and 15 year olds, many are still staying involved with the stage in various ways.

What is also fascinating about this film is that so many of the original dancers are still alive in their eighties and nineties!  There was a reunion of those living and healthy enough to make the trip in 2000 (several have since died) and they were interviewed about their work with the various incarnations of the Ballet Russe, the choreographers, impresarios, tours, their own careers, and what they remember about the other dancers.

Some of them even had careers in Hollywood during the 1940s, both companies fleeing to America during World War II.  Sol Hurok was the impresario in North America during the war years and afterwards.  He and de Basil had a falling out (de Basil was quite a difficult man) and his company ended up touring South and Central America and Australia while the Massine company became an American troupe and began hiring American dancers, even if they fancied up their names to sound Russian.  ""The Original Ballet Russe"" of de Basil ended with his death in 1952.

A fascinating movie for those interested in this artistic form and its history.  There is a great deal of archival footage and pictures that are all the more amazing when put into context by the dancers still living when the film was made.

One of the realities that will come to you as you see the lives these great dancers lived off stage is that artists usually have to draw their satisfactions from their art.  They certainly didn't get rich from the stage and their lives afterwards weren't all that easy either.  At least that is how it looks to me when I see how they live, the kinds of cars they drive, and so forth.  I am sure some lived well, but certainly not all.",1180915200,6,3739,4.721109399075501

I wanted to be swept up by the enthusiasm of the filmmakers and their subjects.  This often happened during the charming interviews with the company members looking back on those heady days.

2600150,5,B000G5SIBM,"This is an absolutely delightful DVD. It combines narration, archival footage, and interviews with original(!) members of the companies to produce a very engaging history. To clarify, the DVD is about two companies: the ""Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo"" and the so-called ""Original Ballet Russe"" company, both of which split off from the _real_ original Ballet Russe - which as all of you know was the company of Najinsky etc. - after 1929.

Everything about this DVD is first-class. The archival footage is very clean. The narration clarified many points of history about which I was very confused, including how George Balanchine bounced around like a pinball from place to place during those early years. Best of all was the contemporary footage and oral history interviews of company members. I could hardly believe how many dancers from the two companies are still around in the 21st century! We're talking WWII-era here. If this were Japan, we would declare them National Treasures. Many of them in their 80s, they are still vital and active in teaching, and in at least one case, performing! And they are still such lovely people that my heart just went out to them.

2600151,4,B000G5SIBM,"Of course I and every dancer and afficionado am grateful to Geller and Goldfine for this documentary, a resource of unique film footage as well as just-in-time interviews with some of the most important dancers of the early 20th century.  But it is the very uniqueness and importance of the material that I wonder if Geller and Goldfine fully appreciate.

I heard Geller and Goldfine interviewed on the radio in 2005 and they spoke excitedly of great quantities of archival footage and interview material they had to leave out of the film for theatrical release, but which they looked forward to putting on the dvd.  Well, on the dvd there is a ""bonus"" section of snippets of interviews with Franklin and 4 others for a total of 10 extra minutes.  Those 10 minutes are interesting and valuable but far short of what Geller and Goldfine were talking about in the interview.  Perhaps problems arose with the plan to incorporate the extra material into the dvd.

A small problem, but telling: in the archival footage of the different ballets the music has been dubbed in, and it is almost always the wrong music for the ballet (sometimes it's not even the correct composer).  Why bother dubbing in music at all if it's the wrong music?  This suggests the film makers don't think it matters.  For people who know better the wrong music distracts from the experience of seeing such rare footage.

The film centers around a reunion of the elderly surviving members of the 3 Ballets Russes companies.  Personally I found the scenes of this big, cheerful, relaxed, often clownish reunion boring, and finally, as the scenes go on, a bit grating.  I realize that like most dancers I come to this film deeply aware of the immense professional and artistic stature of the people in it.  I don't begrudge these extraordinary artists their fun at all, but the scenes of the reunion are anything but extraordinary, and in their place I'd much rather have seen more of that historical footage Geller and Goldfine said they didn't have room for.

In the end I can only be grateful to Geller and Goldfine for this documentary, but I have a sneaking suspicion that they don't really quite realize the artistic stature of the people they filmed, nor do they quite understand the art those people gave their lives to.",1170547200,13,2296,4.750629722921914
2600152,5,B000G5SIBM,"People said it was good but I wasn't prepared for how good!  I wonder what the talented directors will work on next.  I fell in hook, line and sinker the minute the narrator, Marian Seldes, opened her mouth I fell in.  And I don't even know much about ballet, though everyone has heard something about Nijinsky and Diaghilev, which is where Dan Geller and Dayna Goldfine begin their story.  It's a leisurely movie and, at 110 minutes, sort of on the long side, but its expert editing makes it a ride worth considering.  I'd go anywhere to see Nathaniel Dorsky's work, and maybe I'm imaging things but either he was in charge of the introduction to Nina Novak, or else the directors found another editor with the meringue-light ""Dorsky touch.""

Ballet must be a wonderful energizer, how else is it that so many of the film's principal characters are over 80 and apparently spry as spring chickens?  I suppose that some of the principals died young, but there are no Tanaquil Le Clercq stories here, and half of the fun is seeing the people old then being flashed back to their youthful selves, so filled with manic energy, back and forth, back and forth, until one feels oscillated through time and space; by the end of the movie you feel you've known these people all your life, and the title card at the end that reveals that five of them died during the making of the picture is like a little stab in your heart.  Among them, of course, was Dame Alicia Markova, the only one among them who had actually lived long enough to have served under the Diaghilev regime.  The heart and soul of the picture is the happily acerbic Frederic Franklin, who puts everyone down with a charming simper.  Indonesian-born Nini Theilade, so gorgeous in Max Reinhardt's A MIDSUMMERS NIGHT DREAM (1935), still looks enchanting enough to make men mad.

The clips are amazing, the supertitles unobtrusive (and yet stylish if that's not an oxymoron), perfectly chosen to make whatever point Geller and Goldfayne feel like making.  I did feel they must have been simplifying one or two points in Ballet Russes chronology, but it's a tangled tale they do their best to smooth out.  Time has obscured the legacy of the Ballet Russes de Monte Carlo, and the movie's comical ending makes it seem as though Batgirl's leaps and jumps in the 60s TV version of Batman, and the porn films of Wakefield Poole (BOYS IN THE SAND) are the leading examples of that legacy, but anyone who has been lucky enough to see this outstanding documentary will tell a different tale.  It is a grand leap of the imagination, and makes you want to photograph everyone you know, especially the aged and the very young and beautiful.",1169769600,7,2683,4.656779661016949

2600156,4,B000G5SIBM,"""Ballets Russes"" is a wonderful documentary about one of the great dance companies of the 20th Century.  Though the Ballets Russes was originally created in Paris by impresario  Serge Diaghilev in 1909, it is with its later, post-Diaghilev incarnation, starting in the late 1920's, that the film is primarily concerned.  It was at that time that choreographer George Balanchine took a chance by hiring a group of unknown Russian migrs as dancers for the company.  Through touring that took them to virtually all corners of the globe, the group would quickly achieve renown as the premier ballet company in the world - though, technically, there were actually TWO Ballet Russes companies, both splintered off from the original, that spent a number of decades battling one another for supremacy.  That may be a bit of a rude awakening for those who believe ballet to be all namby-pamby sweetness-and-light, but there's a ruthless, cutthroat, business side to it all as well, and the film does a good job capturing it.

Let me say right up front that one does not need to know a single thing about ballet to be able to appreciate this film (I`m a prime example of that).  What holds the viewer's interest is not merely the beauty of the dances, but the warmhearted reminiscences of many of the premier ballerinas themselves as they reflect back poignantly on their illustrious careers.  With many of them now in their 80's and 90's, they may be long past their physical primes, but their inner grace, humor and sensitivity shine forth as brilliantly as ever.  It is a true joy listening to them recounting their experiences, while at the same time getting to watch them in old film clips performing at the height of their artistry.

Moreover, the film provides a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse into the short but glorious history of the Ballets Russes itself.  We come to see how it evolved to fit the times, how it raised public awareness for the art form, and how it almost single-handedly made ballet an integral part of American culture.  And as mentioned earlier, there's a great deal of drama to be found in the backstage wrangling among the various directors that ultimately ended up in the Ballets Russes breaking apart into rival companies, both of which enjoyed varying levels of success, and both of which, perhaps inevitably, closed their doors for good on the cusp of the modernistic 1960's.

Thanks to its one-on-one interviews with many of the dancers who made the companies great, the movie becomes a veritable treasure trove of priceless recollections and memories, and I`m glad that directors Daniel Geller and Dayna Goldfine were able to put a record of them on film before their stories disappeared forever (several of the dancers have died just since providing the interviews we see them giving here).  Had the filmmakers delayed tackling this project, this movie might not have been made at all.  What a loss to us all that would have been!",1168300800,4,2966,4.904
2600157,5,B000G5SIBM,This video is amazing.  The footage of the dancers from decades ago is a real treasure.  And it just gets better and better as the aging dancers give their philosophies on the art of dance.  Truly inspirational.,1168300800,3,211,4.648648648648648
2600158,5,B000G5SIBM,"From opening credits to closing comments, this documentary sensitively records the era of the Ballets Russes through interviews with still living artists of that generation, rare film clips, and an always fascinating script that reveals with candor the foibles as well as the artistry of the subjects.

The interviewees reveal their insights into this bygone era with charm and grace, as well as with a certain degree of innocence even at their advanced age.

The documentary is an artistic triumph in its own right with a well written script, superb editing, and voiceovers that are never obtrusive. It definitely merits nomination for an Academy Award in the documentary genre.",1168300800,,679,5.220183486238532
2600159,5,B000G5SIBM,"My mother, Shirley Haynes, was a member of Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo for about 10 yrs in the 1940's-1950's.  She was not well enough to go to the reunion in New Orleans.

Being named for Danilova, it was humorous to hear so many wonderful stories from the other beautiful ladies.

This film was shown in my area on the anniversary of her passing.  I was fortunate enough to connect our local film society with Robert Lindgren who was in the company with my mother.  He lectured and took questions at all of the showings.  Pure Magic!",1168041600,3,535,4.463917525773196
2600160,5,B000G5SIBM,Excellent - a must for ballet afficianados - finally the real Ballet Russes can exit Balanchine's shadow and the influential dancers of that time can get their due.,1167868800,4,164,4.892857142857143
2600161,5,B000G5SIBM,This is ballet history at its best.  Ballet dancers need to watch these types of videos to learn how dancers of the past moved and created their roles so as not to fall into the technique without passion syndrome.  Sometimes innocence and fun can be so much better than sophistication and hi-tech moves.  Bravo!,1167782400,,311,4.722222222222222
2600162,5,B000G5SIBM,This is a must for any dance historian.  What a treasure to have so many dancers from that era (many who have passed on since the filming) on video candidly interviewed.,1167782400,2,169,4.451612903225806
2600163,4,B000G5SIBM,"OK so l was excited to read the blurb on the back of the dvd cover - here was footage of the Ballet Russes - Diaghilev, Nijinsky, Fokine etc - wll yes there were about 3 still photos of them in the first 2 minutes of the film but then we went immediately to the Ballet Russes de Monte Carlo - and this is what the film should have been called - of course there is much more footage of the later ballet company and even a few still alive - and what we see is wonderful indeed - but it is not what was advertised and l was very disappointed that the real Ballet Russes seemed to be just a way to introduce the offshoot company - as wonderful and talented as they were.",1165449600,2,666,3.9407407407407407
2600164,5,B000G5SIBM,"This movie on Les Ballets Russes Russes de Monte Carlo takes viewers on a beautiful journey through the history of this wonderful company. My mother was one of the dancers who danced between 1938 and 1940. Her stage name was Marina Franca but she did not live long enough to take part in the reunion or the movie. Seeing the personal stories of the dancers who were interviewed made me recall all her memories of a time when great artists,choreographers and composers all brought their talents together for this travelling company. The Ballet Russe went across the U.S. to small towns and was a transitional stage between the dancing styles of Old Russia and what we now know as Modern Dance. The company did split up at one point into two companies with one touring the U.S. and the other going to Australia and South America. Even for those less interested in the ballet, this joyful movie will bring a feeling of what it was like to be on the stage and under the lights at a now historical moment in Dance.",1163289600,6,1009,4.549450549450549

But if you're expecting a full-length ballet, this is not it. I ordered it because it got such great reviews, but frankly I couldn't sit through it in one sitting.",1163116800,3,289,4.471698113207547

I have sent 3 Emails to Amazon to tell them I was unable to view it, and despite the fact they promise replies to Emails within 24 hours, I have heard nothing. So I am not happy at all.

2600170,5,B000G5SIBM,"First up, I am not into ballet, or at least not very much.  It's never been an artform that has grabbed me, with occasional exceptions.  However, this documentary is one of the most beautiful, charming, witty and moving films I have ever seen (and I'm old, so that says a lot).  The performers - some of them now in their 90's and still hale - are remarkable, and the ease with which the filmmaker moves through the history of these amazing two companies of artists is a joy to behold.  I saw this on a whim in the theater when it first came out; I laughed at some of the dancers' memories, cried at the sheer beauty of the historic footage, and came out feeling wonderful about life and the magic that is performance art at its very best.

At times funny, at times touching, always beautiful, this film is both a loving tribute to an extraordinary time and a consummate work of art.",1159574400,16,883,4.359756097560975
