8763677,5,B01GWBPKIC,"I actually heard Jackie Robinson's daughter, Sharon, speak at a book fair, promoting her children's book, ""The Hero Next Door,"" and she referenced this movie. I bought her book and this movie as a Christmas gift for my son. Both were very well done. The movie portrayed some of the things Sharon talked about. I highly recommend both products as a gift set.",1513382400,,357,4.682539682539683
