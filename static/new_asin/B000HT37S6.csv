8141073,5,B000HT37S6,"""And God Came to Ireland"" is much more than the introduction of Christianity to the Celtic people. This production brings you into the true beauty and strength of a people in a magical place known as Ireland. Diane Crehan created a first class script and her voice throughout the film is both beautiful and enchanting. Diane guides you on a journey that feeds your heart, mind and soul. The cinematography of Patrick Crehan captures the exquisite beauty of ""The Green Isle."" Filming breathtaking sunsets, rolling-meadows and sea-drenched cliffs are only part of the beauty within this film. The music by acclaimed American composer Tim Janis completes the experience of a people who embraced Christianity over sixteen hundred years ago. This video is a must for those who are traveling or plan to travel to Ireland. I also recommended it to those interested in other cultures, faith, music and the magnificent scenery of Ireland.",1284336000,,929,5.078431372549019
