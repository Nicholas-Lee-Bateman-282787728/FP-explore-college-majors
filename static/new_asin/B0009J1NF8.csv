DVD Review:

Billboard Magazine
February 1, 2003 issue
The Concert for World Children's Day DVD
RELEASE DATE: January 8, 2003

Hosted by David Foster, the Concert for World Children's Day aired primetime on ABC Nov. 14, 2002, but what network TV was able to fit in one hour pales compared with the full-length (nearly three hours) spectacle released on DVD (and VHS) as a fundraiser for the charity, which raises money for Ronald McDonald House Charities nationwide.

Nineteen songs are performed by a wonderful variety of talented vocalists, including Celine Dion, Enrique Iglesias, Josh Groban, Yolanda Adams, Nick Carter, Peter Cetera (who doesn't even appear in the TV version), and a handful of burgeoning unknowns that Foster chose to showcase such as Michael Buble. He also debuts his World Children's Day anthem, ""Aren't They All Our Children,"" the kind of misty, over-the-top ensemble piece that has become obligatory at these kinds of affairs.

Heaps of bonus material run alongside, including visits to Ronald McDonald Houses by Dion and Carter, a making-of-the-anthem feature, behind-the-scenes footage, and plenty of information about the cause and participants. For those who saw the telecast and want a memento, this DVD (or VHS) offers quite a bang for $20, and all for a good cause, too. -CT

The Producer chose this leading-edge approach to allow the DVD to retain the highest quality of picture and sound possible.
