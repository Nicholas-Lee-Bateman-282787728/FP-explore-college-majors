1923763,4,B0000DBJ2D,"Ok, first of all...this was a historical film. There was, for all intents and purposes,no ""script"". Typically when hollywood makes an historical film it has to add a story behind the actual events so that the audience has something more to follow than just the ""history lesson"". Kind of like they did with Titanic. Big boat hits iceberg, begins sinking and lots of people die. Of course that would get pretty boring without a fictitous love story behind it. However, with Suriyothai, this is not the case. The film was commisioned by the queen of Thailand so that the people of Thailand could have an accurate depiction of an historical event and I for one feel they did just that. All the backstabbing, treachery, heartbreak AND violence, usually fabricated to give an historical movie substance, actually happened in the kingdom once known as Siam. The director and his team did tons of research that accurately reflects the true events that occured at the time. Of course, it is not for everyone and I'm sure most people unaware of the legend of Suriyothai, or simply not interested in the Thai culture, will pass this movie by and grab The Terminator 3 so they can be ""entertained"". This movie was made for one real reason; to give Thai people an historical picture of an event most, if not all, were unaware of. This is a kind of ""North and South"" for Thailand and Thai people. However, if you simply watch the movie and take in the ""story"" that's involved I think you will be pleasantly surprised, and you will learn something in the process as well. About 98% of this film is true. Little things like how someone was ACTUALLY executed or how someone rode an elephant into battle may be off a little, but for the most part this is an actual depiction of Thai history. I rented this movie because I am Thai, and felt intrigued to see what a ""big-budget"" Thai movie would be like. I enjoyed this movie for many reasons. The imagery, soundtrack and visuals are great. The story it tells is fascinating, made even more fascinating because it's true. The acting at times seems stretched and the direction during dialogue scenes may seem a little off to most westerners used to Hollywood movies. You more than likely would not see this movie unless you are Thai, related to someone Thai or interested in anything Thai. And that's too bad because it has a lot to offer for a movie that's just an ""Historical Account"".",1070150400,40,2416,4.647196261682243

The Queen of Thailand personnally ordered this movie be made so the Thai people will know their background.  The diretor is a Thai prince; the movie female star is a Thai princess. Francis Ford Copula went to film school with the prince. Excellent film!",1327968000,,405,4.690140845070423
1923769,2,B0000DBJ2D,"While I think this is an excellent Thai film for all the reasons other reviewers have stated, I have to give two thumbs down to the Francis Ford Coppola edition.  For starters, it is so heavily edited that the film is sometimes difficult to follow.  Entire chapters have been cut out and I sometimes felt like the DVD was accidentally skipping chapters, but in fact it was that a full 42 minutes were cut from the original Thai theatrical release (which was already cut down from the 5 hour box-set edition).

My second big complaint, as someone who speaks Thai pretty well and can understand a great deal of what is being said, is that the subtitle translations are AWFUL.  Every third sentence is not translated at all, and much of the rest barely follows the actual dialog.  It is clear that whoever did the editing felt they needed to re-write the dialog for the English speaking audience, and I think they did a pretty lousy job.  When the dialog gets fast they just start cutting sentences left and right, presumably so that the viewer has more time to read.  Anything in the dialog that might be even remotely confusing is re-written and dumbed down.  They should have just faithfully translated what was being said.

If you can find it, I highly recommend you purchase the original Thai theatrical release instead of this edited edition.",1323129600,7,1345,4.68936170212766
1923770,5,B0000DBJ2D,"This has become one of my favorite movies.  It's in Engish subtitles, but that's never been a problem.  The story and the cinetography is great.  It's historically accurate in the customs and dipiction of life in Thailand 200 years ago. The story is full of intrigue, betrayal, love, loyalty, honor, self-sacrifice, and has plenty of drama and action.  This movie was made at the request of the queen because of her concern that the school systems were no longer adequately teaching about Thailand's great history.  She wanted this story told to bring that history alive and inspire interest and pride in the youth of Thailand for their country's heroes and culture.  It was one of the most antcipated movies of several years in Thailand and one of the most popular.  There was a sequel made (I'd love to see it) but it hasn't been marketed with English subtitles nor in the US market.  A real shame.  Definitely recommend this movie to all.",1304985600,,941,4.7592592592592595

I wathched this show be for on Thai version that is 3-1/2 hours on some VHS tape that not so clear. Wow what's a deferent.

1923772,3,B0000DBJ2D,"I am a little annoyed that the version released in the US appears to be so heavily edited for time.  Although I admit I haven't seen the Coppola produced release, I have been told that most of the editing was done to ""character development"" scenes.  Unfortunately, the US audience needs this development much more than the Thai audience would (i.e., US audiences have no institutional memory of the histories involved).  Too bad.

I loved the version released in Thailand; a beautifully filmed movie with a great combination of action, drama, and intrigue.  The elephant battle scenes were fantastic.

The subtitles were not perfect though.  I must say that such a beautiful film deserved better subtitles, which seemed to be an afterthought.  (Typos, and the English subtitles occasionally conveyed different meaning than the sound track.)",1170201600,4,840,5.2164179104477615

The VCD I bought was from [...] which ships direct from Bangkok. My product was intended for home viewing in Thailand, not for mainly export/international audience. I really enjoyed the film, Thai culture is complex and Royal culture much more so. The Prince of Thailand made this film,it is a film not so much a movie, so yes, it can be slow at times and painfully detailed but it should be. This is a film to learn some of Thai history and culture, not just to be entertained. I really loved it.",1134000000,3,629,4.163934426229508
1923774,5,B0000DBJ2D,"We loved this film. Foremost, it was beautifully filmed, with lavish costumes, sets & scenery. The music is beautiful; I'm disappointed that it's not available; I'm a fan of movie scores.

I thoroughly enjoyed the story line also. Not being familiar with the history of Siam/Thailand/Burma, I can't vouch for its historical accuracy. Whether correct or not, it's a fascinating story.

My only criticism is that we became slightly confused by the interwoven relationships of the characters. I'd have liked a guide or ""family tree"" to follow so I could keep up with the many hierarchies. It was sometimes hard to keep up with who was doing what to whom & why & if they were related familiarly or only politically.

Although much of this was unfamiliar material, I highly recommend it if you enjoy subtitled films. We were never bored.",1124928000,8,832,4.886524822695035
1923775,5,B0000DBJ2D,"They just don't make epic movies like they used to; they make 'em even better, at least in Thailand!  I grew up on all those 1950's Biblical and Graeco-Roman Hollywood extravaganzas:  Spartacus, Ben Hur, Ulysses, etc.  The Legend of Suriyothai far surpassed all of these in every way (okay; it didn't have one of those big Coplandesque movie scores, but it does have some authentic Thai music at times).  The the battle scenes, the costumes, the dancing girls, the proverbial ""cast of thousands;"" it's all here, plus enough heads getting chopped off to satisfy any 13 year-old male movie-goer.

Yes, the plot gets a bit complicated, but never to the extent that you can't follow it (and let's face it: most of the dreck that comes out of Hollywood is poorly plotted, anyway).  A previous reviewer said the acting was wooden.  Not so.  I suppose if you're used to the post-modern saracasm and f*** patois of so many American films, you might think the acting a bit wooden, but the acting here, by Thai actors I'm totally unfamiliar with, is superb (the actress who plays the ""bad girl"" role is particularly outstanding, but they're all quite good).

The subtitles were easy to follow and most likely moved the involved plot along more efficiently than if the dialog had been in my own language.  I'm glad Prince Yukol and Coppola didn't resort to overdubbing and ruin such an engrossing drama!  The cinematography is exquisite, a real visual feast of colors, costumes and pagaentry.

I regret that this film will probably not get the mass exposure it deserves here in America, because it's a ""foreign"" film with subtitles, without car chases, gratuitious phony sex scenes (they're here but refreshingly understated), and the tedious use of the ""f"" word.

What more can I say?  Great flick, first rate entertainment and the best thing I've seen in long time.  Don't pass it up!",1122163200,5,1875,4.83385579937304
1923776,4,B0000DBJ2D,"THE LEGEND OF SURIYOTHAI is as fine a study in Thai history as is available.  Obviously a Big Budget film (apparently financed by Thai Royalty) this is a no holds barred look at the legend of a woman (Suriyothai) in Siamese history circa 1540s who selflessly saved her country from annihilation both from civil unrest and from Burmese invasion.

For those of us for whom this film is the first exposure to the ancient history of Siam/Thailand the going can be a bit rough in following the multitude of characters, the various kings and queens and consorts of the provinces within Siam, and the rules of lineage in the royal families.  But once into the film these constrictions relax and the development of the story is fascinating to watch.

The costumes and scenery are as beautiful as any in comparative Asian films and the photography encourages the viewer to jump into the middle of the many gory battles and absorb the feeling of terror that is a running constant in this legend. Thankfully for a change the emphasis is not on highly choreographed fight sequences that crowd the screens today.  The acting is difficult to access: this lengthy two and a half hour version of the original four hour film treats some characters a bit abruptly, not allowing us to see how character evolvement worked in the original.  But the leads are beautiful and sensitive actors and given the scope of the film, each seems to handle the story well.

There is an odd superimposition of Western music (of the tacky Muzak, elevator sort) on this otherwise authentic appearing  film.  I suppose that is due in part to the fact that Francis Ford Coppola is the producer and felt that the music would enhance Western viewing.  This would be a mute point if it were not for the fact that one of the most sensitive moments in this movie is when a young man is asked to sing for the king: the song is true Siamese not only in language but in notes and style and it is hauntingly beautiful!

Due to the film's length and its indulgent use of battle bloody sequences this may not be a movie for everyone, but for those who find the history of the Orient sadly lacking in our teaching, then THE LEGEND OF SURIYOTHAI is a marvelous starting point.  Grady Harp, March 2005",1109808000,9,2248,4.5925
1923777,3,B0000DBJ2D,"There's no doubt that ""The Legend of Suriyothai"" was a major undertaking in Thailand's film history, and it was a super blockbuster there upon release for a good reason: it was a film about nationalism, about how one Thai queen made sacrifices (some of which might have been of questionable intent) to protect her husband.

While the film has nice cinematography, staging and music, it tries to cover too many things, at least for the Western audience, and ends up lacking focus, esp. in the first half, when the power struggle between the faction of which Suriyothai was a member and a royal consort who wanted to resurrect her clan's dominance of Siam.  As I watched how the latter tried to wrestle the throne from her husband, the king, I was confused: why would a movie about ""the legend of Suriyothai"" spend 1/3 of its time on someone else?

First, a little background in case you were also confused about who was who and what was what.

Ayuthaya was the 16th-century capital of Siam, which was made up of several kingdoms.  The ruler of Ayuthaya was the ""king of kings,"" and the other kings were supposed to swear allegiance to him and his heir.  This was somewhat like the Japanese shogunate system at the same time, whereby the warlords (shoguns, literally meaning generals) were supposed to be loyal to the emperor, who ruled out of Endo (modern Tokyo).  Just like in Japan, this kind of confederate system was fertile ground for disloyalty and treachery.

Suriyothai, the daughter of a minor lord living in one of the small kingdoms, was forced into marriage to Prince Tien, whose father became king of Ayuthaya.  Prince Tien was not heir to the throne because his mom was a concubine, not a ""high consort"", let alone queen.  Power struggles erupted over succession after Prince Tien's father died.  One of the most memorable scenes in the movie involves the fate of Tien's half-brother, a little boy who was king for only six months.

After Tien's cousin took over the throne, he went to fight the Burmese.  Historically, Burma and Thailand has had bitter rivalry for centuries, mostly over land and women.  When the king is going, his high consort schemed to overthrow him and restore her clan's claim to throne.  One thing led to another, eventually Suriyothai helped her husband Tien become the ruler of Siam.

The last 50 minutes of the 2-hour-20-minute film is about a Siamese-Burmese war.  Some well-staged battle scenes (with real people and real elephants) in this part make this a worthy film to watch for people interested in world history, esp. the history of southeast Asia.  Finally, you understand why they call the film ""the legend of Suriyothai"" and how she made the ""ultimate sacrifice"" the narrator had promised to show you at the beginning of the film.

As you can see, the film has a lot of storylines, as it covers a span of 20 years of Thai (Siamese) history.  Not only did I find the film lacking a focus for the first 2/3, but the acting quite stiff, as if the actors were just reading scripts.  My mind started wandering away as the film kind of dragged on and became difficult to understand with so many hard-to-remember names scrolling by so fast.  It was until the two-hour mark or so that the film regained its footing, at least in terms of having a followable, focused story.

After finishing the film and feeling rather confused and exhausted, I nonetheless had no regrets renting the DVD.  In fact, the character of Suriyothai kinda stuck in my head so I rewatched the first part, in order to understand what was really going on.  I still found the palace intrigues too much to follow, but at least I began to know who was who and what was what.",1106870400,4,3688,4.68062015503876
1923778,4,B0000DBJ2D,"This movie justifies to the world that Asian countries can make movies as good as or even better than Hollywood.  It's quite a rarity to have a movie made by a Prince, financed or endorsed by a Queen and the main character is acted by a royalty!  You would get to see all of that in the behind the scene segment that comes as extras in the DVD package.  Just like any other countries that were growing up, there were wild ambitions by various factions to reign the kingdom at any cost; the betrayal, the scheming, the plotting to hedge the bet or to better the chance; and to counter that, there were showing of honour, loyalty, bravery in times of need to do what the country is expected of you.  Suriyothai, in this instance, is portrayed as such.  She forsaked her true love for her distant cousin to marry a Prince just to keep the fragile peace among warring factions (which were related as well too).  With the death of the King, Suriyothai's brother-in-law decided to reign the nation even though he swore upon his father's death bed that he would support his nephew (who was only a mere toddler).  To do so, that involved a lot of killing naturally.  Suriyothai explained to her disgruntled husband that at times, the coup was necessary for the betterment of a nation (wise instead of conniving like Lady Macbeth).  As karma would have it, the brother-in-law would suffer a painful death as his own wife had an hidden agenda (to have her lover be coronated as a King & to have her long forgotten U Thong Dynasty be glorious once more).  Suriyothai's husband was projected as a peaceful ruler.  Rather than getting involved with all the bickering that was happening, he retreated to the temple instead (to his detriment as he would later found out as the Queen spread the rumour that Suriyothai's husband plotted for his own brother's downfall so he could be King himself).  Naturally, Suriyothai would summon for his distant cousin that she was in love with years ago to come to the rescue (Lord Piren).  Once all the introduction was gotten over and done with, the movie went up a notch to undo the plotters.  The Director explained that originally, CGI was meant to be done by the Industrial Light Magic but he found out that it was cheaper to be done in real time.  Thus, a fortunate accident that the fighting scenes were akin to Cecil de Mille's grand epic fighting.  Just to complicate the matter, Burma decided to get itself tangled in the civil war.  Here, we gotten to see the Spanish and the Portuguese that introduced modern weaponary and mercenaries to the warring factions and did I mention chicken pox as well?  To cut the story short, Suriyothai's death in the battlefield vented the anger of their fellow countrymen and women who would continue her fight for the freedom of her nation.  A very touching and well-deserving finale.  I haven't seen the extended version before but suffice to say that Francis Ford Coppola would have edited the unneeded scenes or as the Director said himself, Director indulging scenes to make the movie flows more smoothly or more rhythmically.  The deleted scenes were shown but not explained.  It's quite wonderful to note that the person who played Suriyothai's nemesis was akin to Madonna (pop singer) in Thailand, or shall I say, a sex symbol there.  In other words, she's perfectly casted as the conniving Queen who would use her sexuality to get her ways.  Suriyothai was mentioned quite a bit in the beginning and again in the end, but towards the middle, the movie focused more about the turbulent time that Thailand immersed itself in.  A sumptuous set, royal protocol which was followed quite strictly & possibly accurately as it's done by a Prince Director, fighting scenes with elephants which were never going to be outdone by, political backstabbing and intrigue that could match Elizabeth, a bit of love interest, this movie has got it all.  Overall, a very commendable effort especially when you think that this is an Asian but not Hollywood movie.  Highly recommended.",1100217600,7,4041,4.735714285714286
1923779,5,B0000DBJ2D,"The Legend of Suriyothai is a terrific epic. It tells the paralell stories two very different women. The first is Suriyothai, a princess who is in love with a fine man but is forced to marry Prince Tienne. The prince is a honey to look at it but really needs a good kick in the pants because he lacks the slightest bit of ambition or fighting spirit. Still, she makes the best of it. Her first love, Lord Piren also makes the best of it and carves out a succesfufl militray career.

The other woman is the King's consort. She's angelic to look at but is cruel and will do whatever it takes to have her own way. She falls in love with the ancient Thai equivalent of a knight and decides to make him king. She has three innocent men killed because they unwittingly stand in the way of her affair. She kills the king, several hapless servants and procedes to try to wipe out the entire royal family.

All along, Suriyothai sees what's up and battles to save her husband, children and country. There isn't room in the country for the two of them and one is going to have to die.

The movie is very violent in an operatic sort of way. Everybody in the movie loves, hates, fights, eats and forgives in a huge way. The good are very good and the bad are very bad. The actress playing the High Consort's henchwoman was particularly distrubing. Oh and it features a massive battle on elephants and the one of the most beautifully filmed death scenes I've ever seen. I don't buy a lot of DVDs becuase I have to absolutely love a movie before I'll shell out cash for it. I bought this one day after seeing it.",1095033600,11,1598,4.28476821192053
1923780,5,B0000DBJ2D,"The Legend of Suriyothai is the most expensive movie ever made in Thailand, the production funded by royalty itself. Visually, Suriyothai must be the most enthralling film I've ever seen. The dead-on and awesome costumes, the superb cinematography and sets (which were filmed at the real historical sites) are just tremendous, worthy of the Academy Awards. The scale is so huge, that the movie needs to be viewed at least twice.

 However, Suriyothai is flawed for many reasons. First, is that the original version was actually 4 HOURS LONG (!), and had to be scaled down to just 2 and 1/2, understandably to suite Western audiences. I've seen the original version in Thailand and must say though it did drag, it's MUCH better and has more depth that the version released in the West. However, this skeletal version has a consequence of having been scaled down, so in fact, HALF the movie is missing in other words. Pretty unfair, in my opinion.

 Secondly, I would have expected more well-choreographed fight scenes. To say the least, the collosal battles are pretty clumsy and ill-directed. So, don't expect much of a Braveheart-style combat. A movie of such extravaganza deserves more than just uninspired battle scenes.

 Basically, the initial flaw would come as a result of the movie having been scaled down. Characters appear and dissapear. Most of the main characters have paperthin development and we sometimes forget who is who at times. I had to watch the movie three times to understand the movie entirely. Nonetheless, if you have patience and an interest in seeing into history of a nation far away, this is the definate movie to check out. I would advise watching the movie first before you buy it, since Suriyothai is definately a ""like-it"" or ""hate-it"" camp. I personally love this movie, since I can see it's potential and having seen the original version. The story is epic in proportions and if understood correctly, I would even say it's one of the best. Better than Hollywood by far.",1091491200,7,2005,4.899705014749262

This is a fascinating look at another part of the globe which most of us have not experienced beyond eating Phad Thai at the local corner chifa.  The colors, the costumes, the bloodthirsty ambition, and the elephants!  What amazing images are these.  I was particulary enthralled with the scenes of elephant warfare and the one with the elegent river canoes thrusting into battle.  And the one-eyed warrior was over the top!  Even Hollywood should recognize that guy's talent.  How tough was he?
For me, the only reason to not buy this right away is the hope that the longer Thai theatrical version (+45 minutes) might be even better.  But I doubt its coming out any time soon, and often editing is done for a good reason (see Das Boot or Blade Runner).  If you liked Lawrence of Arabia, Gandhi, Braveheart, or Elizabeth, I think you will enjoy this film.  So my advice is to buy this fascinating film right now!",1076371200,26,1098,4.677083333333333
1923782,4,B0000DBJ2D,"This grand film of epic proportions is a landmark in the history of Asian filmmaking.  Directed by a Prince and presented by the Master Francis Ford Coppola, this movie is simply extravagant.  In many ways the grandeur presented here mirrors that found in RAN by Kirosawa.  This extraordinary tale is of a woman who becomes queen of Thailand due to a series of palace coups and machinations that lands her pious monk husband at the throne and sends her boyhood friend Prince Piren into battle against the invading Burmese army. Full of epic battle scenes, beautiful palaces and extraordinary scenes of Asian tranquility this film conjures up a culture and a time long gone.  From swashbuckling Portuguese mercenaries to stampeding armies mounted atop elephants no expense was spared. The deleted scenes lend to the grandeur.
Yet several issues remain that take away from this films greatness and call into question the many awards it has received.  First the film should have been twice as long.  It is an epic and the stories and the characters deserve far more developing.  This leads to the second problem, which is the documentary like feeling you get since the characters don't have time to be developed much of the film has to be walked through by a narrator and every scene has to be presaged by the ever present name of the place you are viewing.  Had the film gone on for four hours one would have become used to the different palaces and cities, but due to its choppy nature one feels like they are watching something less then cinematic.  But regardless of these subtle issues, this film is a winner.
