7901342,5,9089700668,"OK, so I was having a bad day - I had been meaning to watch  this DVD for a while, but hadn't until yesterday. I knew I could use some relaxation so I put it in the DVD player. I have many of Helsloot's  Ambient Collection DVDs and I love them all, but when I played this one in particular, all of the stress I was feeling just faded away. It's pretty much in two parts, the Still Seas and Tranquil Lakes and the other half is a Beach Relaxation which is mostly beautiful scenery with soft waves lapping up on the shores. I played the whole DVD and it's definitely a relaxer. But my favorite part is the first half, with it's peaceful lakes, seagulls, etc. I repeated that section at least 3 times - I like it that much. Also, the music isn't too loud to interfere with the enjoyment of the DVD - it's the kind of music that transports you away from everything. I'm keeping this one near and watch it whenever I'm stressed out or just want to get that peaceful feeling back. The photography is awesome - what else can I say? - I love this DVD.",1393718400,10,1043,4.1330049261083746
