6684136,5,B00NX17RRM,"The Yes, Your Tide is Dark and Cold, Sir is about an unexpected turn in the life of Cliff, a son of a guitar teacher Clay Claitonowsky, that took place in a small town on the ocean. There are moments in our lives when past, present, and future come together generously offering us one more chance to find ourselves. For Cliff, this moment is a visit to the little town where his family used to live. The Yes, Your Tide tells the story of Cliff and people in the town in a way that it intimately reflects to our own lives, a hidden treasure of the great drama film.

Cliff, a pretty depressed looking man in early forties, dealing with a misery at different levels, takes a trip to the town of his childhood in the memory of his mom. He is meeting his mom nurse in the retirement home and invites her for dinner. The elderly nurse, Merrill, is a beautiful work by Jean Brooks. They meet several times, Cliff shares the stories from his life in which there is his mom and he does not feel a conflict about. He is saying many times in the film I am here because my Mom. But the town is boiling because his Dad.

Clay Claitonowsky, a guitar teacher, whose character is a masterpiece by Robert Stuart, has disappeared with three teenager students several months ago. Clay left family when Cliff was a boy.  Cliff is deeply upset about his dads personality and did not keep a contact with him for many years.

Clays friend, Jack (Gregory Tigani), suggests that Cliff stays in Clays house. There are three simple photographs in Clays bedroom, which intrigue Cliff and he cannot stop thinking about them. Whenever he goes he meets people who tell him about his dad. They say over and over again We loved your Dad. It sounds strange and naive to Cliff. He is trying to say that he did not talk to Clay for eight years and now does not have any intension to be involved in anything related to his disappearance. From a multifaceted portrait of Clay we can see why. The guy is pretty wild, has strong opinion about things, diluted view of reality, the incident with the insulin shots is a clear message on it, but he is charismatic, attractive, fun, has great hart, and loves his students.  Cliff is getting deeper and deeper into Clays life without conscious wiliness to do so.

The outstanding cinematography of the film builds our emotional connection to the town. The old town feels warm, charming, and sometime mysterious. Almost invisible subtle changes on the screen help us sense Cliffs feelings. Every scene in the film is carefully planned and perfectly lightened. The scenes performed in the dunes are among most beautiful and powerful scenery scenes ever made. The credit for the superior camera work is going to the Director of Photography, Robert Stuart.

Staying at Clays house Cliff quickly learns about the true faces of the old town and guys making the rules there. He is living that days emotionally so intense that sometimes he does not know what is real. He can leave the town at any moment, to go back to the life he had before, but he does not do so. Thinking about Clay, meeting the students who are mystically starting to come back puts Cliff deeply into his own life. Step by step, he is solving the mystery of the pictures in the bedroom finding deep alive roots of his relationship with Clay. The pictures are for him, screaming about something he had but lost. He vividly sees how important it was. He is realizing that there is nothing else in his life to treasure and probably will never be. His doubts and miseries are gone. He runs, runs to himself and to the woman he loves. Clay is the film Director, Christopher Malinowski.

The Yes, Your Tide is Dark and Cold, Sir will captivate you from the beginning to the end and leave you think about different layers of the story long after the cinema lights are on.",1424044800,,3832,4.51948051948052
6684137,5,B00NX17RRM,"Once is a great while a film comes along that surprises methis is one of them.
Music, camera, and actors are almost perfect!

I don't know if others will get the same effect of this movie, but I have always loved a movie that puts my brain to the test.

I highly recommend Yes, Your Tide is Cold and Dark, Sir.  Watch it with intelligent, open-minded friends who like to talk about film experiences.

Im looking forward to more of Christopher Malinowskis writer-director creations!",1412294400,,481,4.690476190476191
6684138,5,B00NX17RRM,"Director/screenwriter Chris Malinowski tells a poignant, mysterious tale in his movie, ""Yes, Your Tide is Cold and Dark, Sir"". Set in the sleepy beach town of Lewes, Delaware, the film is visually and dramatically compelling. The story revolves around the disappearance of ""Clay"" Claitonowsky and three of his teenaged students. Clay's son, Cliff (played by Malinowski) returns to the town, revisiting his troubled relationship with his father. The actors do an excellent job portraying believable characters, many giving very touching performances. Themes of teenage angst, jealousy and unrequited love are beautifully woven into this rich and thoughtful movie.",1411689600,,662,5.76530612244898
6684139,5,B00NX17RRM,"Throughout the movie, the elaborate depictions of human connections and disconnect powerfully depicts the trauma of a unspoken tragic event. It pulls an entire community together and at the center, the main character, ""Cliff"" is struggling with his own emotions, intrinsically tied to the town he grew up in. The inter-personal relationships found in that mental space develop his character throughout the film. For the new locations in the film, a dramatic sensation of place is overlaid with the impression of isolation. The pace is slower at times to force an introspective viewing of the film. But it picks up cadence with a memorable soundtrack and great transitions from scene to scene. Technically speaking, the quality editing and color work are of note, and the treatment of time creates an interesting dimension to this film.

After watching the premiere of ""Yes, your tide is cold and dark, Sir"", the audience is left with an after moment of intense introspection. One's questions are never fully answered in this film, but there is a rich interweaving of the storyline reminiscent of cult classics, like Donnie Darko, where the viewer is left with an series of unsettling memories instead. Throughout this movie, there are simple moments of cinematic beauty depicting the Delaware towns of Lewes and Rehoboth that really lend this film a distinct personality, the audience leaves with a true sense of place. It's difficult to depict a city so well that one feels connected and as though they could jump in and interact with the characters; the director engages the audience to become vested in the drama of this small-town and the results of the tragedy that envelopes it.",1411689600,,1684,5.057553956834532

8680883,5,B00NX17RRM,"I have watched this movie more than once because it is hard to connect all the the dots in one viewing. I still don't have all the meanings and probably never will know what was in Chris's mind as he wrote this script.
But when I watch a movie I want to see something that causes me to go into deep thought about how the scenes and characters interact.
If you are looking for a movie that follows a rigid timeline and has a beginning, a middle, and an end, well...maybe his next movie will have that.
There is however, a line in the film that goes ""Have you read any Joyce Carol Oats?"", ""You Should"". I took this as a clue. Joyce wrote a short story titled, ""Where are you going, Where have you been?"" After reading the story, I can see that it had a strong influence on Chris's thinking. I recommend you read this....then see this movie. The Cinematography is excellent.",1424131200,,871,4.317073170731708

8680885,5,B00NX17RRM,"An intriguing and haunting film set in a sleepy, seaside town in Delaware. The protagonist is beckoned back to his childhood town after his father, a local guitar instructor, mysterously vanishes into the dunes with several of his students. Malinowski's character Cliff, attempts to provide answers to the parents of the missing children while reconnecting to the places and people of his past.

The plot is riddled with subtle nuances regarding the characters' pasts  though the themes of the film can very much be left to an individual's interpretation. Overall, I truly enjoyed the movie and transformed my perception of the true beauty of coastal Delaware.",1424044800,,660,5.216981132075472
