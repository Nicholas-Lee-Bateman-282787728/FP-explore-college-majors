2554455,5,B000F7CDXK,This is yet another in a series of this hilarious British Sitcom.  The whole family enjoyes this farce.  We have been missing this show on the regular BBC channel lineup and were delighted to be able to purchase it and watch it at our leisure.  Viva Cafe Rene!,1284076800,,260,4.375
2554456,4,B000F7CDXK,"I like watching this with a glass of wine late at nite in the dark. No one will watch it with me and that is ok. It is a spoof of ww 2 occupied france. The jokes are broad and the stereotypes are over the top but I don't care it is funny in the silliest way. Everybody in france seems to want to get down rene's pants. ( Which is so ludricrus and hilarious because rene is bald, chubby and kinda whiney. Even a certian german officer who acts so gay you wonder if it is a put on to get ahead constantly comes onto him. Some of the gags get old like the bad  dressing in drag, but most do not. Like Officer crabtree butchering the french language .",1279929600,,647,3.9389312977099236
2554457,5,B000F7CDXK,"I have purchased the complete series of Allo Allo.  This is the best comedy series that is out there.  I have watched Allo Allo four times and will watch again with guaranteed laughs.  The characters themselves are hilarious especially Herr Flick of the gestapo.  I strongly recommend this very funny spoof of a cafe owner living in France and his dealings with an outrageously funny German Colonel and his incompetent aides.  You can't go wrong.

2554459,5,B000F7CDXK,"Ahhh... the joys of revisiting Cafe Rene in full DVD quality!!!  The best sitcom ever just keeps getting better with every series' release.  I wish I could live in Cafe Rene!  I WISH I WAS RENE! (Wait, that's going too far -- Rene will surely end up getting shot by his wife, or killed ""in the act"" by one of his waitresses, or knifed by Madame LaMountain, or bombed by Denise LaRoque, or done in -- quickly & with style -- by Monsieur Alphonse the undertaker).  GREAT FUN and more than worth its weight in exploding Christmas puddings.",1167004800,,536,4.438775510204081
8118651,5,B000F7CDXK,I have heard of Allo Allo for many years and by chance saw the show on my local PBS station a month ago and found this show very funny. It depicts WW2 France where the German military occupies France during the early to mid 1940s. A very funny show indeed and I really enjoyed watching this show from BBC/Britain.,1454976000,,313,4.322033898305085

8118655,1,B000F7CDXK,"'Allo 'Allo is the best!  But there appears to be a bad batch of DVDs manufactured by BBC Video in 2013.  I had to return a Season 5 part 2 where the first disk was bad.  I've tried two orders of season 6 now.  Disk 1 was bad in one, disk 2 bad in the other.  To verify the problem, I tried the bad disk on two different laptop DVD players.  One just spit the disk out.  The other reported ""I/O errors"" in trying to read the disk.  Evidently a batch of bad DVDs has been produced.  BBC Video needs to recall them and put out a good batch.  I've had no problems with Seasons 1-5 part 1 at all.  Can't wait to get a good copy to move on to Season 5 part 2!",1389398400,,654,3.77037037037037
8118656,5,B000F7CDXK,"This another in this excellent series. Part Two, Series Five, Rene is trying not to be caught in the middle between the Germans and the two resistance groups.",1380067200,,158,4.678571428571429
8118657,5,B000F7CDXK,"This program is funny in a cute, almost nostalgic way.  There are gags that are repeated throughout the nine seasons (they must have done something right!) that make you feel included in an inside joke.  Definitely overacted (intentionally and in a good way)  My husband and I enjoy the whole series.",1363996800,,300,4.8431372549019605
8118658,5,B000F7CDXK,"It's a delightful comedy. I love British comedy anyway, and I think that 'Allo, 'Allo is the best. I recommend it.",1356307200,,114,4.476190476190476
8118659,5,B000F7CDXK,"""Allo Allo!"" Has been around since 1982 and has just recently become available in the USA on a decent media.

Basic story is of a caf&eacute; owner Ren&eacute;; this is in France during the WWII occupation. He must balance dealing with the local Germans, the Gestapo, the good Resistance, the commie Resistance, having affairs with his female help, dealing with his wife and mother-in-law.

In series five we get more action from the communist resistance; frankly I think the commie resistance has cuter girls and adds some fresh characters to the mix. And be sure to keep your eye on the homing duck.

One nice thing about this series is that they place the name next to the actor at the end of each episode. Most of the actors are well known out side of this series. I was shocked however to find that Gestapo Herr Otto Flick (Richard Gibson) Played British Capt. Newman in Ken Follett's ""The Key to Rebecca"" (1985) and completely changed his accent.

8118660,5,B000F7CDXK,"I am a fan of the British Comedies but this one is the best of the best.  The entire series is one hilarious episode after another, many of which are side-splittingly funny.  I recommend this to any serious fans of comedy.",1323734400,,222,4.390243902439025
