Inspector Montalbano and his cohorts will lead you through the solving of the mystery in each of the 90 minute plus adventure.  If you are a fan of the books you will enjoy this series.....and I must admit in my imagination I did not picture Sicily as such a stark island....see for yourself...",1354147200,,444,4.753246753246753
4237704,5,B0040319A8,"Luca zingaretti is perfect as inspector montalbano, the other caracters are wonderfully portrayed. it's great hearing the sicilian dialect spoken, and the series is filmed such that you feel as though you are right there. In particular, the Mediterranean seems so close you can smell and taste it. To top it off, the soundtrack music, for once, adds rather than detracts from the stories.",1353888000,,388,5.078125

4237706,5,B0040319A8,Detective Montalbano is a hoot!  This tough Italian inspector has his soft spots and manages to avoid marriage with his long time girlfriend as he solves complex murders in some of the less savory areas of his city.  His motley group of assistant detectives have their own personality quirks that add a richness to these episodes. Buy it at Amazon and enjoy with some of your favorite Italian take-out.,1349308800,,402,4.811594202898551
4237707,5,B0040319A8,"This is your basic murder mystery series, but with twists and humor.  There is beautiful scenery and offers a slice of Sicilian life.",1346803200,,133,4.782608695652174
4237708,5,B0040319A8,"Our Inspector Salvo Montalbano, who works in the fictional town of ""Vigta"", in the equally fictional district of ""Montelusa"" in Scilly. Where the Sun is bright and life treads at a different pace, amongst classic bleached white villages and towns that would look out of place in a tourist guide book. In this almost Mediterranean idle there is darkness, decay and at times murder.

He and the members of Vigata's small police force, namely Mim Augello, Montalbano's second-in-charge, Fazio, Gallo, Galluzzo and the incredibly stupid yet very likeable Catarella, who mans the station's phones, among other minor tasks. While his whole team have suffered from his out bursts, and sometime strange management style he cares for them and in turn they are all very loyal to him, none more so than his girlfriend of 8 plus years. Salvo is a foodie, with a passion, and he rarely permits anything to get between him and good meal, including other social commitments. He is also an avid swimmer; so much so, his apartment is set on the beach front. While his girlfriend, Livia, has to compete with his detective work, we find in the latter series that he will take Livia on a short romantic holiday, although he is using this pretext to further his investigations. He also brings the new love of his life, in the form of a big black shaggy. As it turns out, this dog is the key to his latest case.
Luca Zingaretti who plays the major role really brings the detective to life; his characterisation for me is spot on. His case work always varied, and never what you would expect to happen happens - there are red herrings and misdirection!
In Salvo's work nothing is black and white; mainly his cases are in the grey zone. As one reviewer put it his cases do not have happy endings, while his investigations sometimes leads to organized crime, his stories rarely get totally focused on the Mafia rather they are part of the landscape and environment of where he works in and around.

The last few years have seen a plethora of foreign defective series from around Europe each series of any real credit brings fresh cultural nuances, behaviour and identity of their own. After years of British and American detective series these shows, are like a new revelation. While some may hate subtitles I can assure you that to see and hear these shows as they were originally broadcast is always best and I find them all the more enjoyable.

If you like detective stories then this instalment is not to be missed",1333065600,8,2493,4.700228832951945
4237709,5,B0040319A8,"This continuation of the cases of Inspector Montalbano is, as are all the disks in the series, delightful and entertaining. The stories are extremely well done and essentially faithful to the books by Andrea Camilleri. They chronicle the cases of the irreverent and always clever inspector of the Vigata police on the island of Sicily. There is a very distinct Sicilian flavor to the series which makes them different than American or British crime stories. The close relationships between individuals and families, the sense of tradition and history, the love of good food and of life well lived permeate these stories in a way that is foreign to American detective fiction. One might call them police procedurals as long as you realize that in Sicily the best procedure is sometimes to ignore procedure. Together with the case at hand there is the ongoing story of the life and often rocky love affair of the inspector.

They are in Italian with English subtitles. For one, I like them better that way than if they had been dubbed in English.",1328572800,,1044,4.865168539325842
4237710,5,B0040319A8,"If you've never read Andrea Camilleri, you're in for a treat.  If you're a fan of the books, the only caveat is that the episodes or ""movies"" don't go in the order of the books, yet they revise the stories just a bit so that there is continuity.  Montalbano is less introspective than in the books, and less obsessed with the perfect meal, and Livia is (from my admittedly male perspective) a more understanding person in the videos.  But the casting is wonderul-- I couldn't now imagine Catarella any other way, or Fazio, the whole group.  These shows are wonderful detective stories, fantastic glimpses of Sicilian culture, and just all around excellent entertainment.  I could watch one of these a night for my entire life and never get bored.  Please, Mr. Camilleri, keep writing more of these!

one other warning:
These have no English sound track, if that's an issue for you.  I don't speak a word of Italian, though perhaps I've picked up a word or two, as these are in Italian with English subtitles. But after a few minutes I don't even notice I'm reading and not listening. But they are all region-1 NTSC, so you don't need a special player.",1320624000,20,1151,4.635467980295567
4237711,5,B0040319A8,"While the actress who played Livia has apparently left the series, it's still great entertainment and I highly recommend it. The Sicilian scenery is gorgeous and Luca Zingaretti and the rest of the cast are all wonderful.",1316476800,4,221,5.0
4237712,5,B0040319A8,"Just finished these three DVD mini-movies in the series and my only regret is that I went through them a little too quickly. They continue the Inspector Montalbano legacy and storylines with an eye for detail and accuracy with a few minor exceptions or deviations from the books. But maybe more than that they offer up a great cast with great characters, good solid storylines, and Vigata at its scenic and best (or maybe not always, given some of the plots and that the town doesn't really exist and rely on other scenic Shots of Sicily) but you know what? It all works.
  Give yourself a break from the blow 'em up Hollywood TV or movie plots and come find some better told stories with the Montalbano series.
  A bonus from the series is that I'm learning how to swear in Italian.",1290816000,33,783,4.492957746478873

4237726,5,B0040319A8,"Detective Montalbano is not the only star of this series.  Members of his police squad, like Fazio and Mimi and Catarella are featured as well and there is a lot of humor that is not present in the usual detective show.",1378598400,,219,4.341463414634147
4237727,5,B0040319A8,"DETECTIVE MONTALBANO is like pasta. No matter how much you eat, you always want more. Luckily, this TV show is not only delicious...it's good for you, offering nutrition not only for the mind and the wit, but for the eyes and the soul.

For those unfamiliar with this superb mystery-comedy-drama series produced over many years by Rai Television, DETECTIVE MONTALBANO follows the life of Salvo Montalbano (Luca Zingaretti) a wily, quirky, quarrelsome, food-addicted Sicilian cop who is police chief in the small but far from sleepy seaside Sicilian village of Vigata. Backing up Salvo, and quite frequently fighting with him (this is Sicily, after all) are his long-suffering, long-distance girlfriend Livia, sultry platonic friend Ingrid, hot-tempered and perpetually amorous second-in-command/best friend Mimi Augello, bumbling but loveable aide Catarella, gentlemanly sleuth Fazio, trigger-happy Galuzzo, indolent CSI tech Jacomuzzi, and of course the irritable pathologist Dr. Pasquale. Together they are half-family, half-colleague, and all entertaining. This DVD set includes three episodes: ""The Sense of Touch"", ""Montalbano's Croquettes"" and ""The Scent of the Night.""

""The Sense of Touch"" - On vacation with Livia at a beautiful little resort island, Montalbano stumbles into a series of bizarre murders involving blind men with inexplicably large bank accounts. Everything turns on a cane, a dog, and a charity with a nasty secret.

""Montalbano's Croquettes"" -- A wealthy businessman and his wife die in a car accident. A local burglary is traced to Albanian immigrants. An aging Mafia don hides a secret. Three seemingly unrelated incidents meet head-on in a story of revenge, ethnic prejudice and ancient debts.

""The Scent of the Night."" -- When a man embezzles a heap of money from the people of Montelusa and is later found murdered, everyone is ready to write off the event as a case of Mafia street justice...just as everyone is eager to write off the disappearance of a local doctor as a fishing accident. Everyone except Montalbano, who hates being fooled as much as he loves eating cannoli.

All of these episodes are strong, but the best thing about MONTALBANO is not the plotting -- which can at times be convoluted and sluggish by American standards -- but the superb writing (adapted for TV from the novels of Andrea Camilleri), the wonderful chemistry between the actors, and the exploration of Sicilian life and culture -- a life of food, family, argument, corruption, humor, violence, sensuality and intrigue. That, and Luca Zingaretti, who is just a joy to watch, and brings to the screen the same mix of genius, idiosyncratic irascibility and off-kilter sex appeal that Jeremy Brett did to the amazing Granada TV SHERLOCK HOLMES series of the 1980s/90s. Montalbano loves a mystery, but what he really hates is the idea that someone can play him, and as a general rule, it's not wise to try. Though it is fun to watch!

These episodes(in Italian with English subtitles) are presented in 16:9 anamorphic, and total up at 309 minutes, or about an hour and three quarters each. So sit back, open a bottle of wine, and get ready to feast your brain on some of the finest TV around...from Sicily, with love.

4237731,5,B0040319A8,"awesome story lines with great writing, great scenery. Love how Sicily is shown and the dialect used by the actors (sub titles in English). Love the entire series!!!",1358812800,,165,4.928571428571429
4237732,4,B0040319A8,"The charm of the series can be found in the the small nuances in all the episodes: the occasional bumbling characters and stereotypes that are part of the bureaucracy that make up the Carabinieri and ""sacred"" police rituals, the importance of good food at all times and in all places, the brusque street-wise humor of impatient detectives,lovers and bystanders.

The always dense and sometimes absurd story lines spin a viewer along. The series require close attention at all times to the narrative from the very first film shot:a fleeting face of someone getting out of a taxi late at night at a beach, the minor unexpected car accident in front of a building, the little boy looking for food in the early hours of the day--- all of these episodes are meshed into the main story and can easily be forgotten as characters are introduced or eliminated.

These films do not permit multitasking while watching. Don't take a day or two off while viewing a 100 minute or so episode, for it is in the accumulation of inconsequential clues that one can find tension in the drama.

A cautionary note to the casual audience:A coffee break or a nap( sometimes there is a lot of talk about social practices) during an episode may require a rewinding and reviewing. Minor events can easily be forgotten. But those gaps can be fun too---seeing an episode for a second time calls attention to some unusual acting and filming  practices, for some episodes were apparently filmed with scant rehearsals,some dialog appears ad hoc or added at the last moment to expand or pad a discussion and chat,etc.

How can one best enjoy the Montalbano series? Why, in a hot tub, of course,within reach of a good glass of prosecco and a plate of spaghetti arabiata.",1357171200,3,1736,4.754152823920266

Some nudity in the series because they are European - think BBC did the series (at least aired it)(some EP would be rated R by the MPAA). Wife wanted 1-3 for the holidays - bought 1-9 and we ran thru them on a binge run over the holidays. Guess great success. We have bought EP 10-12 now.,1484179200,,449,4.113636363636363
