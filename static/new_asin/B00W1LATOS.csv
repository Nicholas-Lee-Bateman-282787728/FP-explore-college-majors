7114189,4,B00W1LATOS,"In days of truth and honour...
'Commander 'Raiden' (Clive Owen) fallen from grace in defence of his master 'Batok's' (Morgan Freeman) honour
leads a quest to rid the Kingdom of it's corruption and regain the name and honour of his master who had met with
the injustice of the Emperor's first minister 'Gezza Mott' (Aksel Hennie) who had engineered the downfall and division
of the lands he and his family had protected for generations past.
'Gezza Mott' believes that the discredited Knight and his Command will one day return to seek justice......over a year
after 'Raiden' has seemingly reached a low-ebb, it seems the threat has past.
However undetected he and the members of his command had been planning to serve justice and regain what had
been taken........the odds are against them, but act they must.
This is a very enjoyable sword-clashing adventure that is worth a spin if one enjoys medieval-type action.
'Clive Owen' seems to excel in this type of role.",1435622400,,966,4.932515337423313
7114190,4,B00W1LATOS,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Its been a while since Ive seen a decent fantasy flick, so I figured I was due.  I love fantasy and sci-fi almost as much as I love horror, so I try to venture into those genres every once in a while.  When I read the plot synopsis for LAST KNIGHTS, I knew I had to give it a look; I like Clive Owen and Im a huge fan of Morgan Freemans acting, so this was a no-brainer.  Thankfully, the movie delivers as well.  Although the storyline might sound familiar, the film itself is taut and riveting, a welcome addition to the fantasy genre.

Fans of cinema will probably be able to discern this films origins.  If you are not well versed in the cinematic world, LAST KNIGHTS is a retelling of the 47 RONIN tale.  Granted, this version takes several liberties, however the basis of the story is the same.

LAST KNIGHTS is shot well and looks decent onscreen.  Surprisingly, several of the nighttime scenes appeared grainy on the Blu-ray I watched.  Im not sure if the lighting was too poor or if the camera that was used was just not up to par, but I think the picture quality could have been better.  This only happens a couple of times, and the scenes are brief, so this isn't a huge detractor.

The acting in LAST KNIGHTS is great, with Owen and Freeman offering their usual standard of excellence.  I am also impressed with the performance of Aksel Hennie, who plays the villain, Gezza Mott.  Hennies Norwegian accent gives his acting a unique flair, an attribute that people probably either love or hate; for me, it works, and it adds a new level of menace to his character.

As mentioned above, the story within LAST KNIGHTS is familiar, however I enjoy seeing it in a different setting.  The concept of honor is something almost lost to modern-day society, so films that hold it in such high regard are a nice change of pace from most of what Hollywood spits out these days.  The film does not bring any new viewpoints or twists on this story, but it still works nonetheless.

LAST KNIGHTS is a win for me, and I recommend it.  There are only a couple of fight scenes throughout the film, which is a small letdown, but the fighting is only a tiny component of the film.  Watch this for the relationships between masters and their retainers, as well as concept of loyalty and honor.  The film will be available next week, so make a note.",1435104000,41,2411,4.407239819004525
7114191,2,B00W1LATOS,"Kazuaki Kiriya is famous for directing live action movies Casshern and Goemon. If you ever saw those two movies, one would expect grandeur, epic visual fantasy, great soundtrack, ridiculous CGI, and great action scenes. Sadly, Last Knights lacked everything you've come to expect from Kazuaki Kiriya. In another interpretation of the famous story of 47 Ronin (the Keanu Reeves version was better), Clive Owen plays as Raiden, a soldier who wants revenge for his fallen master, Bartok (Freeman), and he and his men will face the villain and his horde to restore their clan's dishonor. I really don't mind cliche stories or new interpretations of a classic story, but what bothered me so greatly was the stoic and claustrophobic nature of this film. While Kiriya's previous movies had shown original worlds in a visual epic scale, this was oddly conservative and you feel as if the entire movie was done on a tight budget with limited set availability. The action sequences were boring, uninteresting soundtrack, and it felt like a terrible waste of great actors. I rather watch Casshern and Goemon several more times before going back to watch Last Knights just to remind myself why Kiriya is such a cool director and will always wonder exactly what happened to him to create such a film for Hollywood. I can only hope Kiriya rebounds and create the kind of movies I've come to love watching him create.",1432857600,11,1402,4.919831223628692
7114192,4,B00W1LATOS,"Better than I expected.  Last Knights (2015) is an action adventure movie set in some undisclosed times where an empire  is ruled by an emperor whose elected high official by the name Gezza Mott is extorting money and expensive gifts from lords of the land.  One of the lords whose name is Bartok (Morgan Freeman), refuses to pay tributes to Gezza Mott and even in self defense attacks him.  An attack on government official appointed by the emperor himself is an attack on the emperor, which is punishable by death. Bartok together with his entourage, which includes his commanding officer Raiden (Clive Owen) are summoned before the emperor and Gezza Mott...what fallows after will bring death, dishonor, destruction, and masterfully planed out revenge.

Last Knights is perhaps not Braveheart (1997) or Gladiator (2000), but it still delivers the goods. The movie has an Asiatic or multicultural feel to it.  Lots of the actors and extras in the film are of either Indian or Oriental origin.",1432080000,125,994,4.993939393939394

After a sadistic ruler takes over and dishonors Bartok the land is changed. Now, looking to avenge his master Raiden begins a quest of honor. I have never been a huge fan of medieval movies. They are OK, but nothing all that exciting for me. The fact that this one had Morgan Freeman and Clive Owen in it had me interested. I have to tell you that Morgan Freeman is in this for about 10 minutes so that was disappointing. As for the rest of the movie it really got better the more it went on. This is nothing amazing but for someone who isn't a big fan of this genre I thought this was OK. If you are a fan of these types of movies you will really enjoy this. Overall, better than expected and get better the farther into the movie it got. I give this a B-.",1431907200,43,893,4.167630057803469
7114194,4,B00W1LATOS,"A RICHLY FILMED AND MORE UNIVERSAL (multicultural) RETELLING OF A JAPANESE NATIONAL EPIC

WHAT IS A CHUSHINGURA?  SEE HISTORICAL NOTE BELOW AND THIS QUICK DEFINITION:  ""Chushingura"" is a Japanese term specifically for a fictionalized stage version of historical events surrounding the Ako Incident in 1703 (with impetus in 1701).  We often call it ""The 47 Ronin"".  It's kind of like a passion play.  The Chushingura is a national Epic of Japan and has countless tellings.  (Different people have different tastes and that's completely valid, but please accept some effort to give background even if the movie approach itself doesn't suit all fans)

A RE-IMAGINING OF A CLASSIC TALE -  It's true not everyone will enjoy the somewhat fantasy approach to this adaptation.  But the Japanese themselves have countless versions used to inspire loyalty and honor over the centuries.  Those Japanese versions range from the fairly accurate to the very far out.  Many Westerners are familiar with the tale of the 47 Ronin (masterless Samurai) through the classic 1962 film by Inagaki.  However, some may not be aware this is far more than just a Japanese legend and is based on real events.  This particular iteration of the Chushingura charts a different course with a multicultural approach.  The opening narration spells it out, speaking of an empire with people of all ""color, creed, and faith"".  Though it appears medieval, this movie is a fantasy in that it belongs in no defined time or place.  It incorporates elements of many times and countries.  Whether medieval castles, Indian crenulations on buildings, Asian fighting styles,  Ottoman architecture, Baroque palaces, or the interior furnishings similar to Ancient Rome - the design elements of this film are stylistically dazzling (if a bit busy at times).  The cinematography brings it all together in haunting ways like grey scenes of foggy, snow-draped countryside contrasting sounds of a female classical Arabic singer that channels the legendary Ofra Haza.  The multicultural cast strongly reinforces the theme.  The Chushingura is expected to be retold in many forms to preserve it in human memory.

THE PLOT (No spoilers):  Lord Bartock (Morgan Freeman) is nobleman from an ancient house.  Commander Raiden (Clive Owen) is chief commander of all his forces, but also treated as a son though he is not of noble birth.  Raiden's past is dark and violent, but he was taken in by Lord Raiden who saw great potential.  Raiden is now a man of great conviction to the unbreakable code of elite soldiers: ""possess a noble heart of courage, right conduct, and absolute devotion to one's master"".  This is a take on the Bushido Code.  One day a courier arrives with a summons for Lord Bartok to appear before the new minister, Gezza Mott, who is also favored to become the next First Council to the Emperor himself.  Gezza Mott is utterly corrupt.  Though the summons mentions discussing new protocols, implicit in this message is that Lord Bartok must bring a bribe to the powerful minister.  However, Bartok is the most honorable of men.  As he explains, wounds of honor are self inflicted.  Lord Bartok and his retainers travel to the capital and he meets with Mott.  However, the private meeting turns into confrontation, and from confrontation into altercation where Mott is lightly wounded.  Lord Bartok now must face trial for raising a sword to an official of the Emperor's rule.  Grave offence has been committed in both directions according to law and tradition of the code.  Commander Raiden is now faced with dire consequence and obligation.  He and the other retainers owe absolute allegiance to their lord's honor, but cannot raise a hand to Gezza Mott without consequence of death.  Raiden's youthful demons appear to haunt him again and threaten to destroy his world.  Meanwhile, the code and honor demand that accounts be settled or honor is lost.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  I am not saying this is a perfect film and to be honest the title threw me off at first.  However, I was amazed at the substance this movie possessed if understood correctly.  You don't necessarily have to know about the 47 Ronin to enjoy this movie.  But it does add depth for those that do.  Both the slight fantasy element and the retelling of 47 Ronin may put some viewers off.  That's understandable because everyone has different tastes.  There are some melodramatic moments.  All I can say is that for a movie I had never heard of in theaters, I was amazed at the effort and quality they put into it.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON THE CHUSHINGURA AND THE 47 RONIN: As I mentioned before, the Ako Incident is the true historical occurrence while Chushingura is a reference to the same tale fictionalized in plays, Kabuki, literature, and film.  It is one of, if not the most, famous of Japanese epics and has been used for centuries to inspire and teach a nation.  Though the names are changed for this adaptation, the characters in most traditional renditions are represented with their real names.  The short version of their names being Kira (Protocol Official) and Lord Asano.  The end of this movie is a little different and mysterious than the real event.  I had mixed emotions about that.",1431648000,156,5232,4.964285714285714

7114225,5,B00W1LATOS,"Unexpectedly, oddly good movie. A great story with really good writing and some fantastic ideas, all with a level of depth that repeatedly and consistently surprised me. The fact that it's plagued by an X-Factor of cheesiness or amateurish style is either heightening my appreciation of its positives, or gaslighting me into trying to figure out exactly what the undefinable negatives are. Within 5 minutes I was trying to understand why 2 heavyweights would have agreed to this movie. After about a half hour, it made complete sense. In a vacuum, this movie would be spectacular. Maybe they just needed better marketing, a better DP (although I can't find anything wrong with the cinematography beyond it being a little hollow), or a different director? Different music? I think the lines between outright fantasy and ""historical"" fantasy were too vaguely drawn. It doesn't stray far enough away from normalcy, so the diversions from a believable reality (like the anachronistic ethnic pluralism and nebulous melange of asiatic and European cinematic and literary norms) become almost more distracting than compelling. But again, I really liked basically everything about this movie and think that in someone else's hands (god knows whose) it could have done really well.",1485043200,,1272,5.270935960591133

Viewers who have seen 47 Ronin will immediately recognize this as an adaptation/retelling of that story, especially with the obviously Asian influence from the style of the dramatization to the mode of dress of the characters.  After his master deliberately insults the emperor's corrupt official, a knight is ordered to kill him. He does so, then plans his revenge. It's well-played, well-written, and doesn't dally around with extraneous material.  I was surprised by how fast the story moved, covering so much material in such a short time.

Film in Czech, the winter scenes are beautiful. The cast is a good one, with some familiar faces if not names. The script is well-written with plenty of action but strategic cuts in the film at various point, making it more dramatic by not actually showing what happened but leaving the rest to the viewer's imagination. The ending is obvious and a ""has-to-be"" but it's nevertheless one I didn't want so I was left with a feeling of disappointment for what was otherwise a good retelling of this familiar story.

7114251,4,B00W1LATOS,"The Last Knights was a truly international cast with very good acting.  Based on the Japanese classic 47 Ronin, Last Knights recounts the story of the Bartok clan.  Lord Bartok, wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman who just seems to add credence and an honorable flavor to just about anything he does, decides enough is enough when the Emperor's Minister, Geza Mott (Askel Hennie) asks for more and more ""tribute"".  Bartok sees that as extortion and presents the minister with a gold colored silk robe instead of money.

The rest of the movie is the rise and fall of Captain Raiden, who Bartok says is to carry the clan forward.  Raiden must do the unspeakable.  Yet to not do it is to disobey his master, which his code of honor forbids.  Mott is sure Raiden will kill him for the task Raiden was required to do, thus sends his own men to spy on Raiden in his following days.  Sinking into a depression Raiden eventually burns all bridges around him until is own internal ""enough is enough"" alarm goes off.

This movie has a lot of good action, great fight choreography and good acting.  The acting is such that by the time the movie is only perhaps 15 minutes into it the viewer already hates Mott.",1468627200,3,1200,4.53953488372093

7114275,5,B00W1LATOS,"This film should have been watched and enjoyed by more people. It is the story of an oppressive ruler, how he kills the leader of a subgroup, and how the commander of that group, Raiden, seeks and takes revenge. It is acted well and is filled with action. It is a take-off of the story of the last samurai, which has already been done in various genres, including westerns. Even though we know the plot, it is a good story and was good in every version. Arguably, this version is the best because it has subplots absent from other versions. We watch how the hero's enemy's wife is mistreated, how her father is helpless, how our hero is spied upon by his enemy's commander, the reactions of this commander, how his enemy acts, how our hero's wife acts, and much more.
Those who watch the film may find it hard to believe that Raiden's master would bring about his own murder because he did not want to pay a bribe and wanted a society without oppression. But, on the other hand, this is what honor is about. Raiden says ""Honor is something all men are born with. It cannot be taken from you.""
In short, there is lots of action and the film raises interesting questions about honor and about giving up ones life for honor.",1456185600,,1221,4.407079646017699

7114298,4,B00W1LATOS,"LAST KNIGHTS (2015)

I was surprised, very pleasantly, by this movie.  It is in fact a Ronin tale disguised as a middle ages piece, but the net result is a slower-paced action-adventure flick with some new wrinkles and surprises.  I found it overall to be quite a refreshing experience for this adventure junkie, and thus am moved to write this review.

The photography is very beautiful and the directing is first rate.  I get the feeling that they didn't just throw money at the movie, but exercised the budget with shrewd discretion. The casting is excellent and the performances are top notch.  Contrary to some other reviewers, I found Morgan Freeman's performance to be riveting.  I always enjoy him, but I can't think of a more enjoyable performance of his.  Clive Owen, the main character, does not disappoint either.  The supporting acting is excellent as well, and I found the evil minister in particular to be uniquely and enjoyably despicable despite the constraints of the somewhat cliched role and dialog required of the character.

I believe it's the first movie I've seen from a Korean studio (the actors are very predominately Caucasian), and perhaps that's where the original aspects to this movie come from.  This is not the typical, fast-paced, in your face, one thing after the next action film.  Rather, it's a story with climaxes that include action.

There are some minor genre-required cliches and perhaps an unbelievable character trait or two, but if you can get past those then you can find enjoyment and interest here, maybe even to the point of writing about it as I have.",1449273600,,1602,4.888888888888889

7114317,1,B00W1LATOS,I just watched this movie........what utter crap  !  How it got even one star here I'll never know.  The story/plot is clearly Japanese in origin and in a well made Japanese movie with Japanese  Samurai types playing the roles it could have been half reasonable.  But this Korean director should stick to making Korean movies.........cause this attempt was terrible beyond belief.  Ok so it a Japanese story/plot all about honour & the warrior creed ..............and the the emperor lives in a 12 or 13 century Moorish castle right out of El Cid.............and the interior of which is executed in Elizabethan/Tudor architecture..............the costumes/robes are more Chinese looking than anything............. and the Knight's sword.............Japanese ?.................nope Chinese or Korean.  And how does a black guy with an American accent get in to a Japanese historical drama set in the 15th century.......last time I looked there weren't any black Americans or any other guys of the colour  in Japan in circa 1500 AD  ? ? ?  And the other review is correct when will Clive Owen get away from play such stereo typical roles...............you could pluck him out of a Roman Legion movie and pop him into this one and he'd look and sound and act the same  !  Japanese warriors  ?..........Oh yeah the number two good guy is a New Zealand Maori.................God give us a break  !,1445126400,5,1393,5.160714285714286

7114370,5,B00W1LATOS,"I watched ""Last Knights"" twice over a three day period, with a day between viewings. I read the reviews and took them all with a grain of salt, and after sitting in zazen contemplation, realized this is a much better movie than I had anticipated. I give it 5 stars. In my view, the sum of its parts combined shows why I rate it so.
The writers have taken history, culture, national pride, and martial/spiritual philosophies of the warrior societies from medieval Asia, Asia Minor, and Europe (China, Korea, Japan, India, Persia, England, France, Germany, Spain, and Northern Africa) and crafted a story that examines a small portion of the mores and ethics of altruistic military brotherhoods which have existed throughout history, and what is a proper response to greedy, venal, and corrupt government officials when government itself does not protect its citizens.
The story is very loosely based upon the 47 Ronin, Japan's venerated story of corruption and retribution; it is also the story of corruption within the Chinese court during the Manchu era and reign; while the Knights of the 7th Rank can be just about any warrior or warrior society (of pure and noble heart) we know - Knights Templar, the Samurai, King Arthur, Salah al-din, Miyamoto Musashi, the Rajputs, and many, many more I've not listed. Any individual or society that subscribes to, and practices, chivalry and honor. But not the Jannissaries...stay away from them.
The movie examines these concepts and asks us to examine them also - not to watch unattached from a distance. But to examine our conscience and take a stand. To quote a passage from President Kennedy's inaugural address, ""The darkest places in Hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis.""
This movie asks us to examine our response to corruption, malfeasance, and misfeasance. What action will we take?
An unexpected bit of lagniappe within the movie, and the icing on the cake is the wonderful acting in the movie and the introduction to so many fine actors. They come from almost all the counties previously listed, in addition to The Czech Republic, Israel, Iran, and Norway. I give the movie high ratings just for the enjoyment of watching these actors (actresses included in the actor term.) perform I now have a list of people to look forward to.
This is an excellent movie - the sum of its parts exceed expectation.
Bravo, and very well done.",1439164800,5,2428,4.909975669099757
7114371,5,B00W1LATOS,"Most viewers probably haven't seen the 47 Ronin (no, the Keanu Reeves version is not correct), so the concept of Honor being more important than life will be alien to them unless they are Japanese.

7114381,5,B00W1LATOS,"This is a GREAT movie.  Rated R for fighting violence.  Loved the Asian-style action sequences and cinematography, great acting by a really, really good cast.  Redboxed it and was so annoyed by the negative critical and online reviews I just had to buy the DVD.  If your older kids can handle in-context battle violence, this is a fantastic family film.  A must for anyone who loves Asian historical films - a familiar feel with international faces.  Great themes of honor, courage and sacrifice.  Maybe Hollywood just can't handle action films with NO cursing or nudity?  Yeah, this film just must have too much class.",1438128000,4,619,4.884615384615385

Come to find out, aside from the two well known actors Clive Owen and Morgan Freeman, the rest of the crew were completely unknown to me.  The costume and production design were absolutely outstanding, few films have done better.  I loved the idea of having actors from every continent, also.  The only weakness I thought was the repetitive soundtrack. Otherwise, I highly recommend, especially for Clive Owens fans like myself.",1438128000,,606,4.574074074074074

One of my friends didn't care for it but he is a moron anyway, his opinion did not count. My other friend she liked it as much as I did. a complex and wonderful telling of a story that may be slow to some but to me it was deliberate and suspenseful. it is a tale of revenge and service. the performances were very good but Clive Owen and Morgan Freeman were outstanding.

7114394,3,B00W1LATOS,"Good enough to watch once. It is really a compilation of several Asian stories, particularly 47 Ronin. Yes, it is completely predictable, and I hate to use this word as it sounds so pretentious but is is REALLY DERIVATIVE of just about every movie of the same genre in the past 50 years.
I watched it once and I will not need to ever watch it again. I put it in my DVD library and will let some future generation watch it after my death and they can render their own judgement.
Three stars is a fair rating, but you might be better off renting it on Prime for a couple of bucks rather than buying it.

7114408,3,B00W1LATOS,"This film takes the tale of the 47 Ronin, alters the location and time it takes place and changes a few more details before the end of the film. The tale of a group of dedicated warriors whose master is killed and who wait for revenge has been used more than once and in some cases more effectively. But this version has its ups and downs, the end result of which is a movie thats enjoyable for one viewing but perhaps not repeat playings.

In a time unspecified (I would assume the future after war has altered the world since the members of the various members of the group and of the ruling class come from different races and ages), the Emperor rules with the assistance of Gezza Mott (Aksel Hennie), a tyrannical sort who has resorted to not only raising taxes on the people but a more or less blackmail of all feudal lords as well. This does not set well with Bartok (Morgan Freeman), a lord who refuses to pay. In so doing his life is forfeit and his execution at the hands of his lead warrior Raiden (Clive Owen) is called for.

Once his lord has been killed the lands of Bartok are divided among the remaining lords and his family scattered. His warriors are cast aside as leaderless men, tossed aside to find menial positions from which to make a living. Having been cast as warrior elite whose main purpose was to stand in honor for their lord and master, they now have nothing left to be loyal too. Raiden falls the furthest from the group, returning to the drunken life he once led before he became a knight, saved by Bartok oh so long ago.

Gezza Mott remains doubtful and has his own right hand man keep an eye on Raiden. Fearing that attempts will be made on his life with revenge as their intent, he tries to pressure Raiden into acting. But Raiden has fallen deeper than expected, going so far as to sell his sword for the price of a drink. The emperors high council member passes and he elevates Mott to this position. Before doing so he tells Mott to discontinue his spying on Raiden. Mott does so and from there things begin to change.

If you know the story of the 47 Ronin then you know what is coming. If not don't let me ruin it for you. Suffice to say that this telling of the famous story does a decent job once things begin moving forward. But it is in getting to that point that the movie is ruined to an extent. It takes nearly 2/3 of the film, moving at an incredibly slow pace, to get to the best parts. What you would think is an action film has less action than one would expect. A nice sequence at the films opening and then in the last 20-30 minutes or so help but not enough.

The acting is a bit higher than most films of this sort with Owens doing a great job in a role hes become used to over the years having already starred as King Arthur at one time. Freeman is solid in his performance but it is far too short when you consider his name is above the title here. The rest of the cast hold their own as well making them a formidable force not just as the knights but as performers as well.

The movie is better than one would expect in some ways, worse in others and in the end a movie that is worth watching at least once. Those who expect to watch it over and over again are either Owens fans, sword play fans or those whose expectations are not of the highest order. Still, it entertains and is worth a nights rental.",1436313600,3,3362,4.2208398133748055

Last Knights is an action adventure movie set where an empire is ruled by an emperor whose elected high official named Gezza Mott is extorting money and gifts from lords of the land. One of the lords whose name is Bartok (Morgan Freeman), refuses to pay tributes to Gezza Mott. Bartok together with his entourage, which includes his commanding officer Raiden (Clive Owen) are summoned before the emperor and Gezza Mott. This is where the movie starts to pick up and gets very interesting. What happens next is an awesome twist to the movie that I did not see coming at first.
