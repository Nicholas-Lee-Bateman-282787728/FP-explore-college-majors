5819445,3,B00DJQKJO4,"This bluray version definitely didn't blow me away like I hoped. Certain scenes looked a little better than the standard from what I recall but its still an old movie and only so much can be done without totally ruining the film. If you're a big fan of the movie, I still recommend this version over standard though since it is the best they can do for this. I was however disappointed in the condition of the case housing the disc. Big cut through the slipcover into the plastic case. Not sure what happened there.",1520812800,,515,4.431578947368421

5819448,1,B00DJQKJO4,"As another person mentioned I am certain these are used and not new. First one I got the 3D disc was cracked and the case had a cut in it like from a box knife. I returned that as damaged and ordered a 2nd one. Same cut in the same spot on the case. However the discs were fine. I did complain to Amazon about this and received a $10 credit.
Now as far as this 3D version, very disappointing and NOT worth the money. Very few scenes do you even notice it. It is also not widescreen, but the tv formated version. My dvd version I got a few years ago is 100 times better quality than this. I am going to try and return this also.",1516492800,,627,3.90625

5819481,5,B00DJQKJO4,"Let me preface this review with a confession.
I have ALWAYS disliked this movie....even as a child.
There were numerous reasons for this, which I won't go into here.
I had...under duress I might add, watched it a couple of times in the intervening years, without really changing my opinion.
I'm not and never have been a Judy Garland fan, ....and THAT song does not become any more captivating with repeated hearings. Well not to me it doesn't anyway. ( A bit like Moon River, but that's another story.)

Then along came this 3D version...yes, yes I KNOW it's not REAL 3D for all those aficionados of the two lens camera technique, ....but for the rest of us, you put on the glasses and the images appear to be in 3D.
I was persuaded to watch the thing again,and I have to say that this is definitely one of those occasions that the 3D actually adds a great deal to the movie.
I actually found myself thoroughly enjoying it.
Yes Judy Garland still looks old enough to drink in all States, and she still warbles THAT song, but the images seem to become so much more interesting due to the process itself.
Because the movie was never actually shot in 3D, but has had the process applied to a 2D image, it gives the film an appearance closely resembling one of those pop-up books we loved as kids. Now this would not be acceptable for a movie depicting reality. (Titanic 3D did look clunky at times!)
However because this is a fantasy, and the scenery already looks like an illustration, it really works a treat!
Things tend to recede back into your screen more than they come forward, I can't really remember anything breaking through the screen, but overall it really made the movie far more attractive to me.
The colours seem to have a new brightness, making ""beyond the rainbow"" truly the fantastical place one might imagine it to be.

I won't go much into the movie itself, as it's already very familiar to everybody and has been reviewed numerous times here already.
Suffice to say that for me the Wicked Witch is still the best character, getting all the good lines. (""And yer little dog too!"")
She also has the most spectacular entrances and exits, all clouded with billowing bright scarlet smoke.
Glinda looks great but is still that saccharine-mouthed goody-goody.
One cannot help but be impressed by Ray Bolger's turn as the Scarecrow. He continually manages to make his legs look exactly as if they have no bones whatsoever!
What is also impressive is the ""acting"" of Toto. How they managed to keep the dog interested and doing his part during the many takes movie making involves is a mystery, .....but he's good!

Strange as it was to even myself, I have to admit to thoroughly enjoying the experience this time.
Mine is the 75th anniversary 2 disc edition, with the lenticular printed outer cover, and contains both the Blu-ray 3D and the Blu-ray versions of the film, the digital HD Ultraviolet too along with what is claimed as over two hours of extras, ...even a ""sing-a-long"" feature! Whatever that may be!

Thoroughly recommended, specially if like me, you have not exactly been enthralled by your previous viewings of ""The Wizard of Oz"".
This version just may make you change your mind.",1475366400,2,3204,4.665486725663717

5819512,5,B00DJQKJO4,"Nearly two years ago, as Disney began converting their 2D animated classics
for theatrical and 3D Blu-ray release, I began thinking about the way these
upconversions were bringing new life to old favorites.  It was then that I
suddenly thought, ""If there was one film that would truly benefit from a 3D
conversion, it would be The Wizard Of Oz.""

I thought I had stumbled on to one of the most sensational ideas of all time.
I immediately contacted someone I knew at Warner Bros. and suggested that
they perhaps consider converting The Wizard Of Oz to 3D.  Well, turns out,
the studio had already had that idea in mind and I was told confidentially that
a conversion was already in the works.  Now one year later, audiences are about
see Oz like they have never have seen it before with Warner's 75th Anniversary
release to IMAX theaters and Blu-ray in glorious 3D.

I had actually anticipated that the online community would be rejoicing when
they finally learned the news about the conversion of OZ.  Turns out, there seemed
to be more anger than praise for what the studio had done.  Certainly, The
Wizard Of Oz is regarded as one of the most definitive classics of all time and
no-one had the right to tamper with (what Warner's George Feltenstin eloquently
calls) a ""national treasure.""  I think, for the studio, this was a labor of love.  From
the beginning, it was apparent that Warner Bros. and Prime Focus carefully mapped
out exactly how this conversion would be done in order to bring a new vision of Oz to the
screen, while remaining respectful to the original film and the intentions of its artists.

In case you haven't read about the conversion process itself, I'd like to point
you to this excellent article which I hope you will give a read before moving forward
with this review.

I need not talk about what The Wizard Of Oz is all about.  I am not even going
to talk about how good it looks and sounds -- because all of you should know
by now that this Blu-ray presentation is as exceptional as it can be. Those of you
reading this review are most interested in how it will look when you slip the disc into
your Blu-ray player and place 3D eyewear on your face. So let's get to the meat of
this review...

The Wizard Of Oz ranks as one of the most interesting and enjoyable 3D
experiences I have ever witnessed.

...and that's a rather funny statement for me to make when this conversion goes
against everything I most love about 3D.  There's no gimmickry here where objects
leap off the screen.  The level of depth tends to be more subtle than I prefer.  Yet,
just having completed watching this film, I felt as if I had seen an entirely new movie
that I had never realized before.

From the moment the MGM opening logo appears on the screen, you notice the
ribbons of film that drape along its sides.  The title credits are well pronounced --
almost leaping forward -- and the first time I can see that there are actually shadows
behind each of the words.  This is nothing Warner Bros. altered, mind you, but now
exaggerated, you see these titles in an entirely new fashion.

It is hard not to get a little giddy over the fact that you're watching something you
have been forever familiar with, but now seemingly new. During the film's first 18
minutes in sepia-toned Kansas, the depth of field reveals a slight amount of spacing
between characters and their surroundings.  Mostly, it looks like the same effect you
get from watching viewmaster stereoscope slides where objects are placed prominently
in the forefront with all other scenic backdrop in the rear.  I was pretty amazed at how
cool these scenes actually looked.

When Warner first brought The Wizard of Oz to Blu-ray four years ago, I remember
posting a statement online that watching the film in high definition made everything
look as if it was shot on a sound stage -- and  I remember someone playful responses
of ""duh!""  The point I was making was that most all of us first watched this film as children,
most likely via television broadcast. The perception you have when watching on medium
that limits picture detail (and this includes original VHS releases), is that there is not a lot
of attention paid to the background sets so everything looks somewhat more real.

If there is one problem with this new 3D creation, is that it forever throws the entire
believability factor out the door.  Now before you start laughing at the way I am trying to
describe this transformation, understand that the 3D brings out a slew of nuances that
you probably have never noticed before.

Certainly, everyone is curious about how dramatically enhanced the color sequences
look in 3D.  With its new new level of depth (now slightly increased), the film becomes
somewhat claustrophobic.  There is no doubt that you are looking at a tight sound stage,
and for the first time, I was noticing things I had never paid attention to before.  For instance,
you can't help but realize the plastic sheen in the plants and village rooftops of Munchkin
Land.  Yes, it can be distracting at first, but as the film moved forward I began to notice how
my eyes were constantly moving away from the action, paying attention to the smallest details
I never noticed before.  For instance, the little flowers on each of the Munchkin Mayor's shoes.
Or, during the scene where Dorothy first meets the Tin Man, I noticed the movement of tree
branches and hanging red apples swaying freely, as wind moved through them.  During the
welcoming parade inside Oz palace, I noticed for the first time that the horse changed its colors
three different times.  It's not as if there is anything new in the frame that wasn't there before,
but the 3D conversion makes object placement and its textures more pronounced than ever.

The ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" of watching Oz in 3D don't exist in blatant pop-outs.  There really
aren't any.  However, there are many interesting moments that look somewhat more
larger than life thanks to the conversion process.  Let me list a few from the notes that
I took during my viewing...

* When Glenda first materializes before Dorothy and makes reference to her dog,
watch the quick shot of Toto's nose.  It looks as if it's nearly peeking out of the screen.

* Some of the best (but very brief) 3D moments deal with The Wicked Witch pointing
her finger. She does it twice:  First towards Dorothy with ""I'll get you my pretty..."" and then
later, on a housetop threatening the Scarecrow with, ""...I'll stuff a mattress with you.""
Her long, scaly green finger takes on a very interesting dimensional effect, almost begging
to leap off the screen.  Unfortunately those shots exhibited a noticeable amount of ghosting.

By the way, let me mention here that there were slight ghosting issues here and there,
but all very brief.

* The field of poppies become more prominent than ever, taking a more foreground
presence.  Add a layer of falling snow, and it looks more magical than ever before.

* As the gatekeeper bars Dorothy and her friends from entering Emerald City, watch
the level of depth as his face pops out from the hole in the door.

* Very cool sequence as Dorothy and her friends walk down the long, narrow hallway
towards the Wizard's chambers.  Not only do you get the illusion of different size perspective,
but watch how prominent the Cowardly Lion's tail becomes as he pulls it in his hand.

* In the Wizard's chamber, smoke, fire and hologram seem to have their own
individual layers.

* Watch the Witch's hourglass tilt forward, nearly off the screen, as the sand counts
the passage of time.

The Wizard of Oz 75th Anniversary Edition 2-Disc Blu-ray release arrives housed
in cardboard lenticular packaging. It comes with two hours of extra material including
an All-New-Feature-Length Documentary, ""The Making of the Wonderful Wizard of Oz.""

Do yourself a favor and watch the 1970s reissue trailer that is included on the 3D
Blu-ray disc.  You can see bits and pieces of the movie, as I imagine it originally looked,
reissued to theaters at the time.  It's a startling realization of how much work Warner
has put into the restoration of this film upon entering the digital age.

Watching Oz in 3D brought an entirely new level of appreciation to the film I never
had before.  I couldn't help but marvel at the level of work that went into the Oz's set
design.  Sure, now enhanced in 3D it looks more unrealistic than ever, but at the same time,
these are the most magnificent stage pieces ever built.  The matte paintings alone are
gorgeous to behold. I don't think I ever took notice of any of these things until my viewing
this afternoon.  This conversion takes everything you haven't noticed before and pulls it
all forward....

...and that's a good thing.

For the haters that still feel that Warner Bros. had no right to alter this masterpiece,
all I can say is that it is quite apparent that the utmost love and respect was given
to the original source material.  For as long as the original version is forever available
to the public (and there is no reason to believe it ever wouldn't), there is always room
for this reimagined version.

Bravo to Warner Bros., Prime Focus and everyone involved with this release.",1453075200,9,9213,4.671419714817111

5819519,5,B00DJQKJO4,"""The Wizard of Oz"" is a classic with out without 3D. I haven't purchased it yet, but have every intention of doing so soon. It astonishes me though how some will think that even in 3D it will show in a 'widescreen' format. That format did not exist until 1953 with the feature ""The Robe"". A technology stunt to get people back into the theaters since TV was blossoming and movie ticket sales were failing. ""Cinemascope"", ""Cinerama"", ""Vista Vision"" were heavily used to tempt moviegoers back to see movies like they have never seen before. 3D has been around for a while but only here recently has it been perfected. This idea of going back and transferring movies to 3D was something I was not going to partake in UNTIL (Lol) I saw a sample of ""Jurassic Park"" and it blew me away. Then of course I saw a 3D sample of ""Titanic"" both of which we now own. Some movie transfers do not fair as well. One being in particular, ""Predator"". The 3D actually made it difficult to watch and was more of an annoyance than anything else. I am no expert nor do I try to pretend to be. I am sure many enjoyed ""Predator"" without any issues. Its all a matter of taste of course. When I do purchase this I will probably have to order it since our local video stores barely keep this particular title in stock, but of course they have all of todays titles. ""The Wizard of Oz"". A true cinematic masterpiece and has never had any competition nor could it ever be topped, no matter how many times they try.",1445385600,2,1483,4.338129496402877

5819521,5,B00DJQKJO4,"I'm old enough to have seen this in black and white on a vacuum tube television set.  Over the years, I've seen the quality improve as technology advanced.  Well, prepare your self for a quantum leap when you watch this version!
From the opening scenes, I was entranced by the quality of this edition.  It simply amazed me how much the conversion to 3D added to this film's presentation.  It is literally like seeing it from a whole new perspective.  For example, when Dorothy goes into the apple forest to pick an apple, you feel like you are going into the forest with her.  Even the matte paintings that form the distant background seem to have depth!
The color in Oz is sparkling.  Leaves and such have a shiny gloss.  The audio is simply amazing.  They took a monophonic sound track and gave it depth and great fidelity.  When the house lands on the Wicked Witch of the East,  your subwoofer will definitely give you a decent ""THUMP"".
The one thing that surprised me is that this version is in 4:3 aspect ration through the entire movie.  I expected the screen to widen when Dorothy transitioned to Oz, but it stayed that way.  Of course, this movie was made in the late 1930s, so they may have stuck with a single format for budgetary and technological reasons. Regardless, the 3D version will add new joy to a timeless classic.  Definitely one to have in  your collection of 3D movies.",1443744000,21,1392,4.534136546184739

5819526,4,B00DJQKJO4,"Of course the movie is wonderful.  Is there anyone alive who would argue that fact?  And, of course, this newly-enhanced edition of the film itself is gorgeous... probably better than the original release prints.  It's truly visually and audibly magnificent.  But, the bonus materials are a little frustrating.  When are we going to stop calling the 1990 ""making of'"" documentary an ""ALL NEW DOCUMENTARY?""  It's the centre-piece of the DVD sets (aside from the remastered movie itself), and it's great (thanks largely to Angela Lansbury's presence in it), but come on.. it's TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OLD!!!  Let's get an actual NEW documentary, or call it what it is (not ""new"" anyway).",1424563200,,679,5.118181818181818

5819528,5,B00DJQKJO4,"I purchased the 3D+Blu edition.

I liked the 3D translation.  It wasn't overdone as so many of these conversions are.  It was enough to add depth to the movie without the showmanship of things literally thrown in your face.

What was most impressive, though, was the *quality* of the editing and restoration.  Growing up on TV editions of WoZ, I remember grainy video, poor sound, and gaps in presentation.  Those are all addressed here.  Of course, it also means you can see how cheesy the flying monkeys really are, and how much the scariness of the Wicked Witch derives from makeup and prosthetics....  The upshifted voices in Munchkin land are also much sillier in high quality.

I can see all the metaphorical warts in the original film, but in impressive quality.  It was much more immersive than the 'originals' I remember.  I was also amazed by how many scenes and parts of scenes were slashed in my viewings over the years in the interest of commercials.  This restoration is an indictment of commercials.

Lastly, I have to mention the specials.  I only got through a couple hours worth before information overload.  Still, in that interval, there were many many many ""I didn't know that!"" moments.

Definitely recommended.",1423094400,20,1233,4.884057971014493
