8186696,2,B000OTLMRW,I just had a tough time watching it on the computer... I was expecting more fight scenes and less story...,1389484800,,106,4.35
8186697,3,B000OTLMRW,"The movie was decent with the usual kung fu fighting. I rather like this version as it was English speaking versus subtitles.  The only bad thing was the ending sucked. Like cutting off the last 5 minutes of an Indy jones movie, which leaves you wondering, did he get it or not, lol.",1373587200,,283,4.339622641509434
8186698,5,B000OTLMRW,"I love all of the old Hong Kong Kung Fu movies. Come on, they all extol the virtues of good versus evil, good diet and exercise, etc. They're just plain good fun entertainment.",1367107200,2,176,4.363636363636363
8186699,3,B000OTLMRW,"Eight thieves steal a map and hide the pieces. A constable investigating gets his partner killed in a showdown with some of thives and goes on mission to find the map pieces and return the treasure to its rightful owner. Not the greatest plot and even at 90 minutes the movies seems too long; but it does have plenty of badly dubbed kicks and fighting sequences that make it an OK campy movie, certainly worth the buck I paid for it.",1177286400,,433,4.3580246913580245
