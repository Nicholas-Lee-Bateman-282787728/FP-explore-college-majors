8344368,3,B0016GOKU8,"Mahesh Bhatt's 1994 film 'Naaraaz' is easily one of the most well made films of the decade gone by. An honest and powerful film. I saw this film years ago and I remember liking it a lot. Though the film flopped at the box office, I feel this film deserves a watch for the honesty its been made with. I am not 'Naaraaz'(angry) with this old flick, I am indeed happy!",1302652800,,365,4.154929577464789
