8191626,5,B000PHX2CG,"Don't miss this probably best summary of the future of energy use. This is a hugely experienced professional engineer in most of the areas he reports on, looking at the energy sufficiency and sustainability problem unemotionally, with no axe to grind, on the science and economics. I saw him present this at the prestigious UK IET in 2008 - the US IEEE plus mechanicals)

Al Gore's inconvenient partial assertions are not science - populist clap trap not properly supported by the scientific discipline of hypothesis and test, assertion unravelling in the face of the latest evidence as a result. Doug's is just the facts, Maam, while always trying to stay accessible and overtly honest using real world examples. It won't change. He isn't selling anything. He is telling you what reality is according to scientific method.

This is a massively serious study , the work of over a decade versus the opportunistic fact free assertions of populist politicians for profit of whatever kind. This work is joined up across every possible aspect and wholly supported by the established science, with accessible examples from well known public data.  This is what the lobbyists who profit massively from bogus solutions to whatever the media problem de jour is, while making it mostly worse in reality, supported with rhetoric backed bad law from their elected servants, don't want the people to know.

The truth about energy.

PS We now need a populist who can extract and communicate Doug's gems to the mass of people, so they can understand how the governments of Western Countries are passing laws supported by utterly untrue assertions on energy generation and its climate change justification to allow their cynical rich lobbyist fiends to steal from the people while making things worse. That's the absolute reality Doug doesn't say, but he provides you with the totally supported facts to figure out for yourself.

PS Here is a Doug Lite effort I give in the UK - (...)",1348790400,,2000,4.970059880239521
8191627,5,B000PHX2CG,"Nobody's Fuel is the simple yet comprehensive reply to those who - hearts in the right place but brains a step behind - believe that we can run this planet on wind, tides and sun. Perhaps in the future we will be able to utilise sufficient renewable energy resources to avoid oil wars and CO2 overload, or better yet utilise nuclear fusion, but not if we run out of power today.
Nobody's Fuel points out most effectively that we need nuclear fission now, to bridge the energy gap between today and a planet self-sufficient in non-polluting energy,
I recommend the Nobody's Fuel DVD for all those who take the energy needs of the planet seriously.
And I look forward to reading the Nobody's Fuel book.",1235520000,2,700,4.608
8191628,5,B000PHX2CG,"Climate change and peak oil both threaten our future. Doomsday scenarios abound. Politics prevails. Climate change ""deniers"" clash with those warning about a coming apocalypse. Plenty of op/ed pieces can be read and sound bites can be heard. But few take the time and make the effort to flesh these issues out with science and substance.

Nobody's Fuel changes that. This video presents the practical view that a good mechanical engineer brings to the twin issues of energy and climate. Douglas Lightfoot, now retired, has spent years studying these issues. Nobody's Fuel builds a foundation that strongly supports his conclusion -- that energy supply is more important than climate change.

This video is no An Inconvenient Truth, in any sense. For one thing, it's not going to win any Academy Awards. The video is very watchable, but shot as a ""talking heads"" production with simple slides. Nothing special there.

For another thing, this video sets its foundation for that conclusion in the bedrock of fact. That's the biggest difference between Nobody's Fuel and An Inconvenient Truth. Where the former builds on fact, the latter builds on opinion.

Al Gore sees the problem as differing opinions, creating a lack of political will. He thinks the technology we need is already here -- energy from the wind, the sun, the heat from the earth. Coupled with social change like switching light bulbs, driving hybrid cars, replacing old refrigerators, and building more sidewalks and bike paths.

Nobody's Fuel does not ridicule that approach. But it does point out its weaknesses. That approach cannot do enough. It's like using a shovel to move a hundred-foot high hill of dirt. The shovel can help, certainly. But you need much heavier equipment to get the job done.

Douglas Lightfoot thinks that only nuclear fission can solve the twin problems of energy and climate change. These problems are not simple. And there is no simple solution. That is the strength of Nobody's Fuel -- it does not treat the problems or the solution as simple.

And that is the weakness of many other approaches. They present energy and climate change as simple problems. So simple that anyone who disagrees with them is either stupid or evil, or both. But that's how partisan politics works. The real world does not work that way.

Of course, the thinking on this issue will differ. If you believe with Al Gore that the problem is one of political will, don't watch Nobody's Fuel. You won't find anything about politics here. If you find facts more valuable than opinion, though, you will find facts in Nobody's Fuel.

This is an important film. Thanks to Douglas Lightfoot for making it.",1228953600,,2669,4.953020134228188
8191629,5,B000PHX2CG,"It's hard to avoid superlatives when discussing this DVD! The amount of information Lightfoot has put together for this presentation is truly astounding. It is not because of photography, visual effects, or suspenseful drama, because it is merely a slide presentation interspersed with topical interviews with H. Gordon Lightfoot. It is great, purely because of the vast quantity of information presented with careful emphasis on its relative importance.

This is a must see for anyone who wishes to be considered informed on energy issues and even global climate change. You will want to view any unfamiliar sections several times with the 58 page script in hand (use your computer to print it from the DVD).

The presentation is broken into 7 sections:
1) Fossil fuel and its crucial importance to human life.
2) How much fossil fuel is left?
3) CO2 and the environment.
4) Common sense and its application to the quantity of energy produced.
5) Can renewable energy replace fossil fuel?
6) The long term potential of hydrogen.
7) Nuclear energy.

A good part of the presentation is made via slides on 60 topics within these categories with nearly 300 slide variations to emphasize the point being discussed. The slide/narration presentation is broken by an interviewer questioning H.D. Lightfoot about specific points. If Al Gore had presented 5% as much information and used the carefully reasoned approach Lightfoot does, his DVD would not have felt like such a waste of time.

In such a broad and comprehensive look at humans and their relation to energy there are bound to be a few points on which each scientist can quibble. I for example, found his summary of CO2 effects did not utilize the latest findings (and probably could not since it was produced in 2006). This quibble in no way detracts from the respect I have for the vast majority of his presentation.

After years of trying to listen tolerantly to people discussing potential small scale energy sources as if they were going to save the world, Lightfoot's insistence on scale is a breath of fresh air. After viewing his presentation no one should ever forget the importance of scale or quantity any time they are discussing energy.

Fluff and entertainment this is not, but every thinking person needs the information on this DVD to help avoid a return of the dark ages.

His recommendation that we vigorously pursue nuclear power generation is extremely well supported and in my opinion tops the list of mankind's political and technological tasks.",1198108800,6,2520,4.985714285714286
8191630,5,B000PHX2CG,"""Energy use creates wealth, freedom and a better life - one of prosperity.""  That's the central, compelling message in `Nobody's Fuel'.  This well-researched DVD is the best resource I've found for understanding energy and humanity's large and growing need for it.  Facts are presented without being preachy, and the delivery doesn't rely on Hollywood-style gimmicks to make its points.

The history of mankind's energy use is covered, beginning with the era of wood, which led to extensive deforestation, and ending in the present, with its massive and worrisome use of fossil fuels - particularly coal.

The twin concerns of global climate change and peak oil are faced directly and factually.  The possible role of alternative energies for alleviating these urgent matters is covered in considerable detail.  The discussion of wind power, with its unavoidable limitations, is particularly well documented.

`Nobody's Fuel' ends on a note of hope.  A practical means is proposed for providing the world's population with massive amounts of reliable, low-carbon energy - a source that is sustainable into the next millennium.

Anyone who is concerned with the well-being of present and future generations should view this superb DVD.",1191024000,5,1234,5.4136125654450264
