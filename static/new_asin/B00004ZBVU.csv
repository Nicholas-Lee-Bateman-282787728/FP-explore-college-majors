8307594,3,B00004ZBVU,This is a movie about the British public's imagination of what basic training for the British infantry would be like leading up to their involvement in WWII.  Several British film stars are in this healthy propaganda piece.,1516665600,,223,5.027027027027027

Theres lot of action and fighting against the German forces, and I love the line when the Germans ask the Infantry to surrender and their response is Go To Hell! This is a marvellous WWII epic. Whatever you do, don't miss this classic WWII film.",1477353600,,410,4.554054054054054

8307597,5,B00004ZBVU,"The Way Ahead is a British Second World War drama released in 1944. It stars David Niven and Stanley Holloway and follows a group of civilians who are conscripted into the British Army to fight in North Africa. Beautifully restored version by DigicomTV. Wonderful audio and visual quality.

In the days after the Dunkirk evacuation in Second World War, Lieutenant Jim Perry (David Niven), a veteran of the British Expeditionary Force, is posted to the (fictional) Duke of Glendon's Light Infantry, known as the 'dogs', to train replacements to fill its depleted ranks. A patient, mild-mannered officer, he does his  best to turn the bunch of grumbling ex-civilians into soldiers, earning himself their intense dislike. The conscripts also believe that their sergeant is treating them with special severity; in fact, he is pleased with the way they are developing and has his eye on some of them as potential NCOs. Eventually however, the men come to respect their officer.

After their training is completed, their battalion is shipped out to North Africa to face Rommel's Afrika Korps. However, their ship is torpedoed en route, and they are forced to abandon ship; their sergeant is trapped under a burning tank and is rescued by several of the men. They are returned to Gibraltar, so miss the fighting.

When they eventually get to North Africa, they are assigned to guard a small town. Perry appropriates a cafe as his headquarters, much to the disgust of the pacifist owner, Rispoli (Peter Ustinov). When the Germans attack, Perry and his men fiercely defend their positions, aided by Rispoli. At one point, the Germans invite them to surrender, with the response 'Go to Hell!'

The last scene shows them advancing in a counter-attack. Instead of the film ending with the words ""The End"", it concludes with the more uplifting ""The Beginning"", an attempt to galvanize support for the final push in the war effort.

A beautifully done film. Great for the entire family. Enjoy.......",1390780800,,1985,5.018237082066869
