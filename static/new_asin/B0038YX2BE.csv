4092388,3,B0038YX2BE,"I love the incredible abs exercises. I thought this DVD was the entire collection because it doesn't say otherwise and I tried to read reviews and I still couldn't find out. Now that I own it I see that it is Incredicle Abs 2, 3, and 4. My fav's are 2 and 6 so I guess atleast I got 2 but they really should specify what you are getting. I think it's effective when added to an exercise routine and do recommend, just wish I could get the entire series instead of just a few.",1320364800,19,475,4.010526315789473
4092389,3,B0038YX2BE,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.

Generally, I prefer more circuit style training since I feel the best thing for your abs is getting rid of the fat covering them with cardio and working your ab muscles are secondary.  Hard to tell which approach ab workouts will take.  This one seemed to try to take the circuit approach, more.

This instructor is a bit hit or miss for me.  A little too peppy/talkative/smiley sometimes but mostly ok.  This time, what annoyed me was that the sets were a bit off.  2twists-2knee set turned into 3twists-2knee in the middle of the set then went back to original set count.  3lunge-3knee-3burpee set turned into 3lunge-3burpee set then went back to 3 move set.  These aren't necessarily exact, just examples of what I mean by ""off.""  All fitness productions should have someone in their crew helping to check sets and counts are even on two sides and consistent.  If it is not, it needs to be re-shot.  It is one of the things that annoy me most and will make me not want to buy or keep a workout.  For this one, it only happens a few times in the ab4 workout so largely ok but still, sloppy.

This was an ok workout in the sense that I barely got one.  I sweated some but overall it was a little too easy for me.  That said, it would probably be good for beginners working their way up.",1304294400,8,1343,4.376518218623482
4092390,5,B0038YX2BE,"Soooo, I'm a fitness instructor and trainer who is always looking for new ideas for my classes and clients. Although I'm returning from maternity leave, I consider myself to be in intermediate shape.  Well, this workout blew me out the water! And in a good, safe and effective way!

Cindy is likeable but not too annoying. She cues and motivates without talking too much or 'down' to the viewer, like Jillian M.  (Who I can't stand for that very reason...)

I wanted a DVD that showed new ideas and methods to working all aspects of the abs and this DVD does not disappoint.  Although I am only doing the 1st of the 3 part series on this DVD, I have no complaints, at all! I feel my strength coming back and am confident Cindy can get me back to my pre-baby belly!

If you want an effective and entertaining workout where you are NOT watching the clock, then get this DVD.  If you want to be yelled at while doing the same damn exercises, then skip this workout! :)",1304121600,5,965,4.35754189944134
4092391,5,B0038YX2BE,"This is a great workout! I was originally working out with Cindy Whitmarsh on Exercise TV, but after I changed my cable plan, I no longer had on demand. But, she is my favorite trainer on the channel. So, I decided to buy her dvd and share her great training with friends and family that may not have Exercise TV. She gets results extremly quick! You can literally feel the burn of your abs the next day! After a week in a half of her workouts everday, you can see the change in your midsection. I would highly recommend any of Cindy's workouts to anyone looking to tone and trim those abs.",1298937600,2,590,4.276785714285714
4092392,5,B0038YX2BE,"I first saw Cindy Whitmarsh on Exercise TV.  There was this 20 minutes ab workout she did and it WORKED!  I literally could feel a difference in my abs days after doing it.  I found that same workout on Hulu and did it religiously.  I kept thinking how great it would be if I could get this same workout on a DVD so I searched and found this DVD.  This DVD doesn't have that first workout on it, which kind of bummed me out because I love it even more than the ones that are on this DVD, but the ones on this DVD are also amazing.  Cindy has ab workouts that even those with different injuries to work around can do.  She does a lot of standing ab exercises that I never would have thought of.  You really end up working your abs in many different ways which I fully believe conditions your body much more than doing standard crunches.  Who knew there were so many TYPES of crunches you could do?

For the price, if you're looking for something kind of like the ab workouts from P90X, then get this.  It's not perfect, but Cindy is very likeable as an instructor.  She's a ball of energy but not annoying...and she doesn't do the disturbing groans the P90X guy does, either, so that's definitely a big plus.  There are a few negatives, though - the production quality of this isn't that great as far as the packaging and overall DVD format.  If you found this via Exercise TV, you may also be disappointed as I was that the little clock ticking in the counter telling you how much longer you had to go isn't there.  Yes, I lived by that clock when doing these exercises by watching them on my laptop.

The package design is pretty lackluster, but that's okay.  I think what really sells this is all those people who caught the workout on Exercise TV and actually tried it.  They were very generous also to put the entire workout online for potential consumers to try.  This is the first workout DVD I have purchased in over 10 years because of being able to test drive the product.  I bought a lot of really bad exercise tapes and just gave up because most were awful.  I'd love to see another DVD with Incredible Abs 1, some diet advice (""Abs are made in the kitchen""), and the clock reminding me that I have to keep pushing for just five more minutes...",1285632000,29,2255,4.296208530805687
4092393,5,B0038YX2BE,"Cindy's workout is high intensity and focuses not only on toning and strengthening the abdominal muscles but an overall ""shredding"" of your body. Three 20 min workouts offer variety and are not too long to be able to fit easily into a busy schedule every day. Def a great purchase. I have been doing her workout for less than a month and already dropped a pant size. Love it!",1283472000,,375,4.449275362318841

4092433,5,B0038YX2BE,"I first downloaded Incredible Abs 1 for free from iTunes. It was killer, especially because I was trying to create a more intense workout program for myself. I liked the workout so much that I downloaded the rest of the Incredible Abs series from iTunes. They are all good workouts and quite different so you can mix it up and do one each day of the week. However, I personally think Incredible Abs 1, 2, and 6 are the hardest in terms of really feeling your ab muscles working! Incredible Abs 3 is more of an interval workout and she explains that in the beginning of the program. Don't get me wrong, it's a good workout just different. Incredible Abs 4 is a lot of standing moves (actually most of the workout is standing) and Incredible Abs 7 uses a stability ball which is great. Incredible Abs 5 is good too - she makes you do a good move called the swimming plank and haves you hold a plank for one minute 2 different times during the workout.
Unless I am really pressed for time, I usually do one of these workouts with a few other workouts from exercisetv - a cardio or strength workout. I have seen results with many workouts from exercisetv and I've been using their workouts for about a year. So sad to see the website is no longer running though!
There are DVDs you can purchase from exercisetv on amazon and iTunes has a decent selection of exercisetv workouts too. If you really like Cindy Whitmarsh as a trainer, check out her Ultimate Fat Burn workout and Bikini Ready workout - I downloaded them both from iTunes and they're good workouts!",1331856000,6,1556,4.444055944055944

My abs have become a lot stronger and more defined since I started incorporating these workouts into my routine. They're not your typical on-the-floor crunch style workout.
