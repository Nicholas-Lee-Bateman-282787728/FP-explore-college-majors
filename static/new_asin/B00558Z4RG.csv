4572418,3,B00558Z4RG,"The Coffin is about two people that decide to complete the coffin ritual; the ritual is when you sleep in a coffin to get rid of bad karma and cheat death. One does it to save his girlfriend from a coma, and the other does it to cure her cancer. They receive positive results followed by terrifying hauntings. It's overall a descent film.

The Coffin is original and innovative, story-wise. The acting was fine and so was the haunting music. The actual coffin ritual scenes were very claustrophobic and reminded me of Buried but with supernatural aspects. It's got a couple of good scares, but most have been done before. In fact, I thought most of the scares were predictable. I also disliked the blue filter/tint used on the film. The version i saw was about 1hr 20min, and it kept my attention throughout most of the movie. Overall, it has some good aspects and some bad ones; nothing extraordinary and nothing absolutely terrible.

By the way, the film is mostly in English. Also, the film has some blood, some sex (not graphic and no nudity) and some frightening scenes, in case you're wondering. Not a bad film at all, way above my initial expectations. If you have Netflix streaming, it is available as of 6/18/12, so you can save some money.",1339977600,,1249,4.621621621621622

8457635,2,B00558Z4RG,I would have rated it higher but the foreign language with no subtitles killed it for me. A lot was in English but I missed a good part of the storyline because of that. Story was excellent and I loved the parts of the movie I could understand. Great acting and camera work.,1449705600,,274,4.188679245283019
8457636,1,B00558Z4RG,"Not sure why this movie is even here.
While it looks like it's a good story, the lack of English dialog leaves one frustrated and confused. There is some English spoken but not nearly enough to understand the needed details of the plot.
I would not waste time watching this if I had known there was less than 50% spoken English and no subtitles.",1448668800,,345,4.40625

8457638,2,B00558Z4RG,"I shoulda known, based on prior Japanese horror movies I've tried to watch, that they seem to be on the rotten side.  But the description on 'The Coffin' sounded so good, I couldn't resist it.  The main storyline was good and different.  But watching it, it was muddled and confusing.  I tend to think that what makes a good movie in Japan loses a lot in the US, perhaps from a difference of cultures.  If there were a ratings star for ""stinks"", I would have rated this movie that.  I really fail to see how anyone can rate this as 5 stars.  I think that is misleading.",1447804800,,569,4.261682242990654
8457639,2,B00558Z4RG,"While the movie seems interesting, several critical scenes contain non-English dialogue and the version streaming on Amazon offers no subtitles. Enough of the movie is in English to get a rough understanding of the story, but only bilinguals will be able to fully appreciate it.",1446163200,,278,5.2
8457640,2,B00558Z4RG,"I am not a usual viewer of Asian horror, so I am not really one to critique the film itself. I can only give my personal view on the movie itself. The filming itself and music were both beautifully done containing many lovely scenes and music throughout. But although some English was spoken in the film, I thought at least the rest of the actors' lines could have least been translated and written across the bottom of the screen.. There was a great deal of the movie that included the Asian actors talking back and forth in a dialogue I couldn't understand. Maybe that could've helped me understand the movie itself a little better as well. It was a bit confusing and hard to follow for me.",1445990400,2,692,4.456692913385827
8457641,2,B00558Z4RG,"This is a film that is told more through visual style than through dialogue.

The visual part is filmed in different shades of blue, purple, and grey. At times, the haziness and murkiness of the film tend to blot out important pieces to the story because you just can't see it.

The plot takes it time. Although the movie itself is around a hour and twenty minutes, it seemed more like three hours. The two main characters never actually meet, but happen to partake in the same ceremony. Their stories unfold after that follow similar lines.

To be honest, although beautiful to look at, this film falls way to short under the heavy atmosphere. It could have been told better.",1380412800,,676,4.616666666666666
8457642,5,B00558Z4RG,"This movie has an amazing story. The first 60 mins of the movie it is creepy and has great "" jumping"" parts, but then reads the end it unravels into a beautiful, tragic love story ( that had me crying the last 12 min of the movie.) All in all I thought it was a fantastic movie, that has an incredible story, and very well directed... And I absolutely love it.",1341100800,,360,4.084507042253521
8457643,2,B00558Z4RG,"I'm a big fan of Thai cinema, but I have to say that The Coffin kept me confused and unsure - all the way through the ending - of what was actually happening.  I dozed off at one point and had a hard time figuring out what I had seen and what I had missed when I tried to backtrack.  The basic plot is straightforward enough - the attempts of two characters to shed bad karma in their lives has unforeseen and dire consequences for those they care about the most.  The way things play out is just confusing, though.  I'm still not sure if the two characters who partook of the ritual (a mass funeral for the living involving them voluntarily spending a night inside a coffin) were related in any way - I don't think they were, but I had a hard time keeping a number of the secondary characters straight.  One of the most important scenes at the end had me resorting to movie forums to try and figure out who one of the characters actually was.

This isn't a film that is going to appeal to very many horror fans.  There are ghosts and supernatural occurrences, but I didn't find anything even remotely scary here (although some other reviewers disagree with me on the fright factor).  The movie is also exceedingly stylish (not to mention blue, as most of the scenes are tinted for some reason), and that's not something most Western horror fans are used to at all.  There are a lot of great Thai horror films out there, but The Coffin is just an overly stylized mess.",1340841600,,1468,4.347985347985348
