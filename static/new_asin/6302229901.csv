The production team worked very hard on this movie knowing they had a very small window of opportunity to finish it before the censors got a hold of them.  Partly as an act of defiance, they pushed through and completed the film, only to have it locked up in the safe by the authorities.  Thus the movie was first released for public consumption 20 years later, after the Velvet Revolution of 1989.

This is a story of a group of workers at a steel mill in Kladno.  All but one of these workers have been ""assigned"" to work there for their transgressions against the people.  The young hero is a naive cook who refused to work on Sundays for religious reasons.  Another fellow was a former attorney who refused to recognize that defense is part of the prosecution in the new legal system of communist Czechoslovakia.  A small business owner was reassigned to worked there because he exploited the people by employing three individuals in his business.  And so on.

As much as communism tried to dehumanize the individual and turn them into a nameless mass, this movie does a beautiful job of focusing on the individual.  The mix of characters is rather varied, but they are all down to earth people, a lawyer and a cook alike in the sea of metal scrap, loading gondolas heading for the foundry.  And in the end it is these people who are able to enjoy the simple things in life that are left for them to enjoy. They are they who win and transcend the rather unpleasant predicament that befell them.  Whereas those complicit to the regime work and work and never seem to enjoy life or think about anything else than work.

The one who worked there voluntarily was the former milkman who wanted to help the good cause of building the socialistic republic.  So he heeded the call of the Communist Party leadership and volunteered.  But this was a time when hype far outstretched reason and it was all about breaking records.  It worked like this -- someone at the party headquarters would approve a new daily work quota and the workers had to comply.  So much for being rescued from exploitations of capitalists....  However, unlike the capitalists, the communists had no clue how to run companies so while the daily, weekly and monthly production numbers went through the roof, the quality of steel went the opposite direction.  And in fact, most of the production steel ingots were so shabby that they went right back to being melted again.  This is symbolic or the thinking of that time -- the workers' political supervisor reminded his ""corrupt appointees"" that their purpose for being at the steel factory is to be reformed: ""you're like this rusty metal, but we will remelt you and recast you and make noble steel out of you."" Simply precious.

The other thing that the political supervisor is obsessed with is cleanliness.  It does not matter to him that his ""workers"" are standing in the mud, exposed to rain and snow, but they have to wash their hands before eating lunch.  He even cares for the cleanliness of the Roma people, Gypsies relocated by the communists from Eastern end of the country to Bohemia.  He'd go periodically to their housing complex, which was rather shabby and teach them about hygiene, wash their children's faces, etc.  But this obsession with cleansing the society is more than superficial, but rather diabolical in its hypocrisy and corrupt nature.  The final scene of the movie exposes his intents as he's found by a police man.  However instead of arresting the political supervisor, the policeman joins in the corruption.  This is a disturbing scene but it is purposeful in its symbolism.  The regime was not the rule of the people but a rule of the few corrupt, who ruled the people.  And they ruled in the most corrupt, brutal and perverted way.  And the whole justice and defense system was in place to perpetuate injustice wrought by the few.",1312675200,4,3982,4.683453237410072
7822505,5,6302229901,"Since I worked as an Assistant Director on this film I have a special relationship to it. The political implications of the story of middle class Czech intellectual being forced to work in a steel mill while the uneducated Communist officials supervise ""bringing hygiene to adolescent gypsy girls"" may be a bit difficult to understand to US audiences, but Jiri (Closely Watched Trains) Menzel's overriding lyricism and humor are easy to comprehend and admire. This film, shot in 1971, was banned till 1990, when it won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Festival, right after the fall of the Iron Curtain. I am looking forward to someone in the US to finally release it on DVD.",1293580800,5,672,4.801724137931035

If you are from the ""capitalist"" part of the world, you might be able to understand some aspect of the life on the other side of the iron curtain.

It is a wanderful, bitter-sweet story of lifes...",1105401600,5,278,4.54
