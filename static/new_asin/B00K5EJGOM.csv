8655959,5,B00K5EJGOM,"The documentary ""Enemy, my friend"" by Mike Finlason is a great film that shows empathy and the horrors of those that were captive in South-East Asia under the Japanese and how their time in captivity affected the rest of their lives. It is one of the few stories that has a conclusion after the the war in the Pacific ended. Most histories end when prisoners of war were released after the 16th of August 1945. This should be required viewing for history classes in schools, as time goes by we tend to forget our past.",1438387200,,518,4.463157894736842

8655962,1,B00K5EJGOM,"I ordered this after watching the excellent Railway Man with Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman, but I would not play in DVD player or iMac. Production is limited and obviously without quality control.

Update, I ordered a replacement and it did not play either. Amazon should discontinue this item. Whoever is producing the DVDs should either get it right or stop.",1409356800,7,360,4.901639344262295
