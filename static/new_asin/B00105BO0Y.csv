I was riveted to every moment of each episode.  I eagerly await distribution in N. America - I hope it is coming soon!!!",1209513600,5,290,4.877551020408164

8237202,1,B00105BO0Y,I loved watching the series on television.  When I purchased the two-disc set to show my grandchildren it would not work or play on my desktop computer.  I suspect poor manufacturing quality.  I recommend any buyers avoid purchasing this disc set.,1468886400,,247,4.975609756097561
8237203,5,B00105BO0Y,Iain Stewart productions are wonderfully informative .. he is a master at bringing to life all of the planet's history and systems.,1463443200,,131,5.0
8237204,5,B00105BO0Y,"I have never felt this way about a documentary.  To say this is the best documentary I have ever seen is an understatement.  This series fills you with awe like the original Cosmos, but rather than making you and the planet feel insignificant as Cosmos did, it leaves you truly cherishing the planet we live on.  This is now on Netflix but likely won't be forever so I plan to buy this as soon as it becomes available on Amazon.

The narrator is erudite without being smug, an explorer without being a showboat.  I fall asleep at night, every night watching documentaries and I had never heard of most of what Dr. Stewart discusses.  He shows you how our earth and humans on it are a one in a googol shot.  He renews my faith in a creator (although this series was not in any way religious), and may have changed my views about antropogenic global warming.  This man should be as famous as David Attenborough or Neil DeGrasse Tyson.  Thank you Netflix for putting this up even if Amazon hasn't yet found a way to source it.",1432771200,,1023,4.398936170212766
8237205,5,B00105BO0Y,"Fantastic documentary with amazing visuals.  A great video for anyone who loves geology or just nature in general,  but I'd say it's mainly geologic information.  The narration is great also.",1426118400,3,191,5.3
8237206,5,B00105BO0Y,"I teach middle school science, and I have purchased well over $500 worth of instructional DVDs in the recent year.  The information in Earth - The Power of the Planet is amazing.  The computer animations show convection cycles, plate techtonics, ocean floor spreading, and much more in a way that no 10 books and no other 5 DVDs could.  I could use this DVD and it's 5 one-hour prgrams to teach college earth science, yet my 6th graders are can easily learn basic concepts with a deeper understanding than I could ever hope to give them without all the visual illustrations in this DVD.  I learned more personally from this one DVD than most people taking a Geology 101 class in the 70's probably learned.  I would even recommend this DVD to any teacher who is preparing to take the West-e test to become ""highly qualified"" in science.  Beyond all that... the cinematography is breath-taking.  The time-elapse sequences are truly essential for showing weather patterns, magma flow and convection currents, and MUCH MUCH more!

The DVD I purchased came from England and is region 2, so you might need to invest in a region-free DVD player for your school.  For home use, it can be played on your computer if you have no region-free DVD player.  Perhaps there is a Region 1 version out there that will play on N. American video equipment.",1361232000,,1336,4.695278969957082
8237207,5,B00105BO0Y,Excellent! Bought for a primary school teaching resource. Kids are loving it and totally enthralled! (10-11 year olds). Had no issue with the Zone 2 - just put into MacBook Pro and away we went.,1323302400,,194,4.571428571428571
8237208,5,B00105BO0Y,"Superb, I say!
Sure, it is BBC - so the good photography and the excellent production quality is to be expected.
But the host makes the difference.
Iain Stewart is to television geoscience what David Attenborough was to wildlife film making.
I wish Amazon offered this video on Blu-Ray in Zone A",1306713600,,295,4.6923076923076925
8237209,5,B00105BO0Y,"The producer of this DVD Dr. Iain Stewart takes us around the Earth with visual splendor to teach in a very interesting way how the Earth was formed, developed, went through evolutionary stages, the catasptrophes it survived, how life started, the evolutionary stages and shocks it went through, how ecosystems formed, how they interact to provide an inhabitable environment and how mankind is changing this environment to threaten the ecosystems and therefore life on Earth including human life. This may sound like green peace mouth cliche, but I recommend the viewer to approach the film without any prejudice. There is a lot of information about volcanoes, glaciers, the atmosphere, the early life forms, Earth's geological and biological history. These are  explained in a way that shows how everything is connected with causality. The explanations flow very clearly from topic to topic, asking thought provoking questions to the viewer at the right times and subsequent explorations of the possible answers by taking us back to Earth's early history and / or to different regions of Earth. We are shown evidence of various ancient catastrophes and events that profoundly changed  the climate on Earth which destroyed some species but also created the necessary conditions for new species to come into existence millions of years later.

To explain this in a little more detail, various life forms such as dinasours and others have become extinct at each catastrophe several times over the past millions of years. But each time as some life forms were being destroyed some other species survived and some new species came into existence  and evolution continued millions of years after the catastrophe as the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, land  and  ecosystems gradually recovered. The most important of these were the ice age of 700 million years ago,  the interruption for millions of years in deep ocean currents and the 15 kilometer wide meteorite crash of 65 million years ago that wiped out the dinasours. Some antique  human civilizations  also dissapeared such as the Mayas. Although the Mayan dissapearance was not caused by a natural disaster it is an example of why we should not take the continuity of our present civilization for granted. In fact, the possible future of  our planet  and humankind is also discussed. Jonathan Renout's closing remarks are very meaningful ; it is not the Earth's survivability that is at peril, it is the continuity of  the human beings that is questionable. The Earth will continue one way or another, it has survived many natural catastrophes before. In contrast with the naturally occured  profound changes in Earth's climate and ecosystems millions of years ago nowadays these unfavorable changes that have already begun again are  man made and their rates are accelerating ; eg. releasing too much carbon dioxide gas into the atmosphere and deforestation by humans that reduces the planet's capability to absorb the extra carbon dioxide causing global warming which throws many ecosystems off balance. The ecosystems that were designed to interact with one another to keep Earth inhabitable are quickly becoming dysfunctional.

Yet pretty soon excessive Carbon Dioxide generation may become the least of our worries ; a much worse danger may be  imminent. This is the probable release of an even more poisonous and more green house effect gas called methane currently trapped in ice covering Siberia. This methane is formed by chemical reactions of plants under the ground below the Siberian ice on land  covering a surface area bigger than the American continent. Many scientists believe that if  global warming caused by the excessive increase in the level of Carbon Dioxide continues to raise atmospheric temperatures, most  ice around the world including in the poles and in Siberia may melt. In that case, melting Siberian ice  would release methane bubbles so far trapped in it. This could increase the level of methane in our atmosphere tenfold accelerating the global warming rate to such a high rate that global warming caused previously by Carbon Dioxide alone would remain very slow in comparison.

A superior aspect of this DVD to some other science DVDs is that it is presented by an expert on the topic, not by a celebrity ; he does not appear visually throughout the DVD, we just hear his voice as we watch the volcanoes erupt etc..Whereas in many celebrity sometimes even professor presented science DVD's we watch the celebrity or the professor's face more often than pictures of the natural events that are the subject of the DVD. I don't mind seeing the presenter from time to time but some DVDs exaggerate it as if the presenter wants to promote himself more than he wants to present the topic. You won't find that in this DVD, the presenter does not appear visually at all so all visual time is devoted to pictures of nature.

The producer has done a terrific job, because when I compare this to a recent class lecture I attended about a similar topic in a prestigious American University, I witnessed that the class lecturer made such and important and interesting topic very boring for the students to listen to. Because in contrast to this DVD the university professor who was lecturing the class was talking very fast  for 45 minutes  in each class without ever stopping,  jumping from topic to topic with no central theme, using no beautiful visual slides, scribbling illegibly on the slides on an overhead projector, not keeping track of feedback from the audience ( students ). The students would have learned much more about this subject by watching this DVD and would have been entertained at the same time instead of attending that professor's lectures. This DVD is interesting for everyone but it is especially a rich source for high school and university students doing a project about  the Earth's geology, biology and ecosystems.",1238198400,8,5917,5.067971163748712
8237210,5,B00105BO0Y,"Visually pleasing, informative, scientifically accurate without being intimidating.  The narration makes great use of existing footage and takes you around the world to explore our planet.",1212969600,4,188,6.230769230769231
