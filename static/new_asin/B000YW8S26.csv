3036473,5,B000YW8S26,"After seeing Haute Cuisine, Catherine Frot has quickly become one of my favorite actresses.

Odette Toulemonde is a well written, (and what I enjoy best) plausible story line about a widow with two children, who travels to an out of town bookstore to meet her favorite author at a book signing. After failing to tell him how much his books means to her, she gets a second chance to meet him and decides to write her thoughts in a note. Too bad Hollywood can't come up with these types of original movies. If they remade it for American audiences, they would screw it up.",1391040000,3,570,4.480769230769231

3036475,3,B000YW8S26,"In French-Belgian film ""Odette Toulemonde,"" Catherine Frot is Odette an ordinary woman, a mother of two children, working at a department store. She loves more than anything reading books by bestselling novelist Balthazar Balsan (Albert Dupontel).

But Balthazar is not a happy man; his recent book is ridiculed and treated as a trash by a sneering critic on TV, who, Balthazar knows soon, is having an affair with his wife! Heartbroken Balthazar finds consolation in a most unexpected place, however: a letter from Odette, most devoted fan of the writer, which leads him to her and a new life.

""Odette Toulemonde"" is helmed by first-time director Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt, dramatist and novelist, best known for his ""Monsieur Ibrahim et les fleurs du Coran,"" which was made a critically acclaimed film starring Omar Sharif. Schmitt as a film director has successfully created several moments that are surreal and charming at the same time (when she is happy, Odette literally floats in the air), but the film's charms are whimsical and look sometimes misplaced such as musical sequence in the kitchen.

Film's soundtrack includes Josephine Baker songs, which are great, but while the reference to the great singer tells us something about the warm personality of Odette, I really don't know if it was necessary as the film has already got Catherine Frot's fine acting. Odette is believable and her down-to-earth personality exudes warmth, thanks to talented Frot, but the director needs to flesh out supporting characters including Odette's children who have no place in the story. Some episodes are really funny - Odette's first meeting with the writer is a gem - but their relations, whether as man and woman, or writer and fan, could have been developed more to make a more involving story. The film remains light-hearted while we think there may be more serious side hidden in the behaviors of Odette, which we are not allowed to see after all the waiting.

""Odette Toulemonde"" is a lighthearted romantic comedy, which deals with an interesting theme of bestselling writers and their fans. It is regrettable that the director missed the chance to fully explore the topic.",1219795200,9,2174,5.098314606741573

3036494,5,B000YW8S26,"Catherine Frot is a joy to watch.  Her comedic timing and physicality are superb.  I have yet to see her in a role I have not enjoyed.  That said, this movie is Cinderalla/PrettyWoman-esque, but on a different scale and parameter.  It is a feel-good movie, but original in some very key aspects.  The most important difference about this Cinderella tale is that it comes with a *very* important theme:  that social norms of ""happiness"" (especially those in capitalistic societies) don't work for everyone.  Capitalism wants us to think that the consumption of goods will be something that makes you happy, and that status will validate you as a person.  I had to learn that these two paradigms do not work for me.  When I see a Fortune 500 list of the richest people in the world, I shake my head.  The only reason there is a list like that is that you can measure monetary wealth.  No one can measure happiness, and that's the beauty of being human.",1425945600,3,950,4.595238095238095

Yes, you may say that it's unrealistic and that some things are left out without explanation. But that's not the point.

3036507,5,B000YW8S26,"Odette, a widow and shop girl, lives a pretty ordinary and unexciting life.  But an author's books have taught her to look for the joy in life in simple things.  As she imbibes the message in these books, her life blossoms.  One day, she has the opportunity to meet this author, Balthazar Balsan.  How their lives intersect is a whimsical and fairly unbelievable story.  However, it's rather charming, so you go along with it.  Odette teaches Balthazar some lessons in finding joy.  Catherine Frot is a delight as the widow.  Albert Dupontel plays a convincing jaded romantic hero who revives and begins to believe the lessons his novels teach.  If you like a bit of French fantasy and whimsy, you might enjoy this unusual and upbeat French film.  If you're trying to improve your French, it's a fun escape. 4.5 stars",1417737600,9,817,4.7304964539007095

3036516,4,B000YW8S26,"This light and frothy tale takes place mostly in Beligum - Charleroi and at the North Sea. Like most romcoms, it is totally unrealistic. But it breaks from that genre, but dipping in to frothy flights of fantasy once in a while. It is refreshing to see two middle aged actors fall in love. It was fun for my family, since my husband is from Namur. But you can't turn the subtitles off. This can be distracting if you speak French.

This is not a serious film, but it doesn't take itself seriously. It does touch on what brings us real happiness and one's attitude toward life. But is surfs along the foam without every breaking the froth.",1407542400,,638,4.406779661016949

3036521,4,B000YW8S26,"A very enjoyable romantic comedy that reminds us that amazing things can happen when we take a chance.  Odette Toulemonde, a retail clerk with desires of becoming a published author, musters up the courage to attend a book-signing by her favorite author. Paralyzed by fear, she can barely speak upon meeting her idol, but manages to give him a letter that expresses her profound admiration for his work.  This letter then becomes the catalyst for an unexpected encounter and an opportunity for Odette to dramatically alter the direction of her life.  What I enjoyed about this movie is that it reminded me of some of the great romantic comedies from the '30s, '40's and '50's--just pure-hearted fun.  If you enjoy French movies like Amelie, Romantics Anonymous and The Closet, (quirky comedies with extremely likable central characters) you may enjoy Odette Toulemonde as well.

3270991,5,B000YW8S26,"Catherine Frot is a joy to watch.  Her comedic timing and physicality are superb.  I have yet to see her in a role I have not enjoyed.  That said, this movie is Cinderalla/PrettyWoman-esque, but on a different scale and parameter.  It is a feel-good movie, but original in some very key aspects.  The most important difference about this Cinderella tale is that it comes with a *very* important theme:  that social norms of ""happiness"" (especially those in capitalistic societies) don't work for everyone.  Capitalism wants us to think that the consumption of goods will be something that makes you happy, and that status will validate you as a person.  I had to learn that these two paradigms do not work for me.  When I see a Fortune 500 list of the richest people in the world, I shake my head.  The only reason there is a list like that is that you can measure monetary wealth.  No one can measure happiness, and that's the beauty of being human.",1425945600,3,950,4.595238095238095

Odette Toulemonde is simple, romantic, at times predictable but full of joy and 'life is beautiful' feelings.
Yes, you may say that it's unrealistic and that some things are left out without explanation. But that's not the point.
I finished the movie with an uplifting feel, thinking of why do we need the dwell on the negative all the time?
So take it as it is, a beautiful movie to lift the spirit.",1420588800,,502,4.651685393258427

3271004,5,B000YW8S26,"Odette, a widow and shop girl, lives a pretty ordinary and unexciting life.  But an author's books have taught her to look for the joy in life in simple things.  As she imbibes the message in these books, her life blossoms.  One day, she has the opportunity to meet this author, Balthazar Balsan.  How their lives intersect is a whimsical and fairly unbelievable story.  However, it's rather charming, so you go along with it.  Odette teaches Balthazar some lessons in finding joy.  Catherine Frot is a delight as the widow.  Albert Dupontel plays a convincing jaded romantic hero who revives and begins to believe the lessons his novels teach.  If you like a bit of French fantasy and whimsy, you might enjoy this unusual and upbeat French film.  If you're trying to improve your French, it's a fun escape. 4.5 stars",1417737600,9,817,4.7304964539007095

3271013,4,B000YW8S26,"This light and frothy tale takes place mostly in Beligum - Charleroi and at the North Sea. Like most romcoms, it is totally unrealistic. But it breaks from that genre, but dipping in to frothy flights of fantasy once in a while. It is refreshing to see two middle aged actors fall in love. It was fun for my family, since my husband is from Namur. But you can't turn the subtitles off. This can be distracting if you speak French.

This is not a serious film, but it doesn't take itself seriously. It does touch on what brings us real happiness and one's attitude toward life. But is surfs along the foam without every breaking the froth.",1407542400,,638,4.406779661016949

3271018,4,B000YW8S26,"A very enjoyable romantic comedy that reminds us that amazing things can happen when we take a chance.  Odette Toulemonde, a retail clerk with desires of becoming a published author, musters up the courage to attend a book-signing by her favorite author. Paralyzed by fear, she can barely speak upon meeting her idol, but manages to give him a letter that expresses her profound admiration for his work.  This letter then becomes the catalyst for an unexpected encounter and an opportunity for Odette to dramatically alter the direction of her life.  What I enjoyed about this movie is that it reminded me of some of the great romantic comedies from the '30s, '40's and '50's--just pure-hearted fun.  If you enjoy French movies like Amelie, Romantics Anonymous and The Closet, (quirky comedies with extremely likable central characters) you may enjoy Odette Toulemonde as well.
