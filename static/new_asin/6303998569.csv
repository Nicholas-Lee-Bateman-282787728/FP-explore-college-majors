7858171,1,6303998569,"A) this is not the first episode, which is what I wanted
B) there is no Japanese soundtrack option on this disk ... how can you watch anime without seeing it in Japanese?
C) it's not labeled as the 2nd or 3rd installment of the mini series
D) there's no booklet to explain the story

I could go on, but will refrain.  I first saw this when it was first released way back in the late 80s, and where the theme was a familiar one (several robots coming together to form one), it's still a welcome variance on a well known anime theme.

The music, the story, the plot, everything in the original anime is very entertaining, but to release this disk with such lacking production values, and not to label it, is a shame on Manga Inc.  For a company that's known for releasing quality anime imports, this is a rare black mark on their record.  And, worse yet, the other episodes are only available on VHS.

What a bother.

7858173,3,6303998569,"This 3-episode series was first released on VHS in Japanese with subtitles by U.S. Renditions originally titled Dangaio, but a British dub of the last two episodes were combined into a single dubbed feature by Manga Entertainment with the first episode being presented as a special ""prologue"" under the full title of Hyper-Combat Unit Dangaioh, which unfortunately is the more widely available version on VHS and DVD. The OVA was directed by sci-fi anime 80s expert Toshiki Hirano, who also created Iczer-One and Megazone 23

 Four powerful ESPers(an 80s term for people with psychic powers)are brought together from different corners of the universe by the rogue scientist Dr. Tarsan, who wipes their memories to be part of a special team of mecha pilots that form the giant robot Dangaioh to stop the evil space pirate Captain Garimoth and his fleet. The teenage ESPers escape Tarsan and go to Earth, the home of team member Mia Alice. But Garimoth's agent, the cybernetic Gil-Berg, follows them, and forces them to form Dangaioh to stop his destruction of a major city. The Dangaioh team then decides to go back to Dr. Tarsan and begin their training to become a more effective team against Captain Garimoth's forces. A brief encounter with some assassins working for Garimoth reclaims some of team member Lamba of her former life as a princess. But then team commander Rol takes the Dangaioh team back to his homeworld to confront some old skeletons in his closet, including some traitorous rebels that have teamed up with Gil-Berg. Dangaioh and Gil-Berg have another fight to the death, which results in Dr. Tarsan sacrificing himself to save the ESPers by warping the remains of Dangaioh to the other side of the galaxy. Even though Gil-Berg still survives and rises in Captain Garimoth's ranks.

 The OVA ends on a deep cliffhanger leaving our heroes' fate up in the air. However, a sequal TV series titled Great Dangaioh that came out over a decade later picks up a few pieces of the original OVA, although at first the TV anime looks more like an Evangelion ripoff. Dangaioh also appeared in its own video game, as well as some of the Super Robot Wars titles. Aside from the stupendous robot fights and mecha designs, the inconsistency of the series and cutting out of the first OVA episode makes it slightly hard to fully enjoy this 80s escapade.",1425945600,,2356,4.867830423940149
7858174,1,6303998569,"I must admit that I sometimes enjoy watching old-school anime with a sort of a grotesque fascination; I am amused by the cheesy plots, the inane dialogue, and 80's-style animation quality. I actually owned this three-part OAV set on an import laserdisc(!). I always thought that the first episode was probably the highest in quality of the three as far as animation is concerned. When the Dangaioh does its transformation, it is quite smooth and fluid. But the second and third installments are pretty much low-end anime even for the 80's. I would've been much happier if this DVD release had only the first episode rather than the second and third; it would make more logical sense anyway! The fact that this putrid company released this DVD WITHOUT the first episode is not only insulting but aggravating.

Hopefully, it'll at least fetch me a buck or two on eBay.

7858175,1,6303998569,"what was the point of releasing this piece of... well you know what i mean.  why bother if you aren't going to show the first episode?!  then there wouldn't be any need for a prologue that was just way to long and boring to begin with.  i thought i would fall asleep before the damn thing even started.  i am seriously disappointed, since i watched it a very long time ago and have been waiting forever for them to finally re-release this title.  that they would do so little justice to it is just pitiful.
not to mention the fact that you can't even watch it in japanese with english subtitles.  although it was fun to watch it with the english dub... i don't think i can remember the last time i heard so much swearing.",1056758400,12,721,4.264705882352941
7858176,1,6303998569,"I'm the proud owner of quite a few (over 300) original anime titles, and of all the videos in my collection, this one has got to be the absolute worst (with Tattoon Master being a close second).  Yeah, it's a giant robot flick, which usually means if you've seen one, you've seen 'em all (excepting Evangelion, o'course).  Dangaioh seems like it tries really hard to be original, but fails miserably on every count.  Four mysterious mecha pilots with even more mysterious pasts uniting to fight the forces of evil?  Oh, and with neato psychic powers to boot?  Oh, boy!  And get this!  Their four mecha combine to form a more powerful GIANT mecha!  NO WAY!  You get the idea.  The saving grace for shows like this has got to be in the story itself or in the animation.  As far as the story goes, the writers don't even bother to explain where these ""forces of evil"" came from or what their actual reason for existence is other than the destruction of the Dangaioh team.  As a whole, there's not even a real plot, other than, ""This is the Dangaioh team, there's the bad guys, let's get it on!""  And the animation; yeah, it's pretty much standard fare, in some places completely average.  This is an old-school anime flick, so it's not gonna be spectacular anyway.  And how about that ending?  Oh, yeah, it leaves it wide open for a sequel, but guess what?  This is the only installment.  As if you'd want to see the rest of the ""story"" anyway.  Nothing about this video warrants even a rental, much less a purchase.  The only reason I gave it even a star is because of the talent that went into this tripe.  Mech legends Shoji Kawamori (Macross) and Masami Obari (Fatal Fury) designed all the mecha, and Toshihiro Hirano (Iczer-One) designed all the characters.  If you're a fan of these guys, maybe; otherwise, don't even bother.",976579200,4,1828,4.56
7858177,2,6303998569,"The story focuses around four ESPers: Miya, Lamba, Rol and Pai.  They do not recollect any of their past memories, but the stories around their pasts will become evident to them as the series progresses.  Under the careful guidance of Dr. Tarsan, they create a special force which controls Dangaioh, a gigantic robot with incredible powers.
 The original release in Japan had three distinct episodes, each running 45 minutes long.  However, the English distributor decided to splice two out of the three episodes together and make the first episode a prologue to the rest of the movie, a good change, since the original anime did not seem to follow any logic.  The character acting for the English version made for a colorful rendition for English speakers, although the plot created did not follow the original Japanese version accurately.  However, the changes made for a better understanding of the original work and really impressed me, although I felt that its conclusion left me hanging.  Another of its drawbacks was the musical score, which reminded me of an animated version of Power Rangers.
 Of its positive points, the character designs were created by Shoji Kawamori and Koichi Ohata, famous for their works on such animes as M.D. Geist and Super-Dimensional Fortress Macross.  END",893030400,3,1294,5.0947867298578196
