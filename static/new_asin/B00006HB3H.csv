7968714,4,B00006HB3H,"Amazon has no DVD listing for this, so I will put it here.  This is a JMB Double Feature DVD-R from VCI.  Like most of their others, picture qality is good but these are generally TV and re-issue prints.  Pony Post and Ragtime Cowboy Joe both have the Commonwealth Pictures title card and both have the end cast credits cut off.  ""Pony"" is complete with no real issues.  ""Ragtime"" has one bad dialogue splice.  The running time of 56 1/2 min. is in question because sources show it to be 58 or 68.  Based on typical times, the 58 is probably more accurate.",1355616000,,556,4.339805825242719
