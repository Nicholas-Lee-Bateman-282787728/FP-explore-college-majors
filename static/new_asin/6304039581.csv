764356,5,6304039581,"I don't understand the negative reviews. When this was released (early 80's) there were not many/any films made about the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Judging this film by today's standards is unfair. I disagree with the other reviewers. The acting is solid, the story is well-done and the scenery/set/costumes are very authentic. I like this version of the uprising simply because the story begins in 1940 when the ghetto was formed, the wall was built and the Nazi plans were not so clear. The viewer gets to see life in the ghetto through the eyes of the film's characters.  The evolution of the Jewish response to the persecution is well-represented through the characters. You have every possible human response; disbelief, accomodation, denial, and finally resistance.  Tom Conti plays the ""everyman"" and Lisa Eichorn the ""everywoman"".  Both differ in their initial reactions but are forced (or choose) to resist. I like Tom Conti.  He plays the ""average Joe"" very well.  This average Joe is capable of rising to the occasion under severe adversity. Lisa has what it takes to be the reluctant resistant that eventually fights like a guerilla soldier.

The action scenes were also very authentic. There were no wooden rifles and catsup blood. The Jewish fighters mostly had pistols and Molotov cocktails as they did in the actual uprising. Later they captured some better weapons.  A couple of converted T34's were squared-up to look like panzers and give the necessary flavor. The ghetto is perfect. By the end it is a bombed out inferno.

In the 80's this was well-made and is solid today.  I like the Uprising series as well.  Perhaps it is a more up-to-date production but it has its faults too. I would give it a 5 as well.  No film could possible do the event perfect justice however.",1255910400,19,1795,4.891089108910891

7859584,4,6304039581,"It is filmed like most color movies about the fate of Polish Jews.  It is realistic, and the Jewish fate still touches my heart. I pray for Israel and Jews worldwide. They gave us the Word of God and Jesus, so why do people hate them so much?",1424044800,3,242,4.041666666666667
7859585,5,6304039581,"It is impossible to love a book or movie about the Holocaust since saying that the Holocaust was horrendous would be an extreme simplification of history about the attempted elimination of the Jewish race from the face of the earth. Be sure to get the DVD about the Warsaw Ghetto Wall as there is another dvd named The Wall which has nothing to do with the Holocaust. An A-1 production!
