8604380,3,B00EDYU1YE,"There is a reason why this monster has only been seen twice in the entire Toho history of monster movies. First this movie came out four years after the original Godzilla movie came out in 1954 so Varan came out in 1958. They gave the monster a unique look and every time he showed up that was a great wind blowing against is human adversaries which was very original unfortunately that's what he originality stop there about the way he could also fly even though he did it one time in the movie. The monster has a roar that is very reminiscent of Godzilla and sounds just like Godzilla this should have gave the monster his own roar. In the beginning of the movie he is crawling on all fours but wars early middle of the movie in at the end he is walking on two feet, they should have kept him on all four feet but he has anything with sugar for another Godzilla classic here. Also they gave the monster movie the same soundtrack that they gave Godzilla Films years 4 years earlier. Like I said earlier Varan only appears twice in all the other monsters history in this movie and he has a small cameo in destroy all monsters which came out I believe in the seventies and he is only on the film for about 4 seconds. Not a very classic monster as compared to Godzilla Mothra and Roman. This film is considered to be a classic and it is but it's not the classic that Godzilla is I think it's more of a classic because this monster has this movie and only a cameo in another movie that appeared pretty much almost 17 years after this movie. Still a fun film to watch and enjoy because it is a lot of destruction in this movie as in all the other classic Japanese monster movies. This version of the DVD has the original Japanese audio and English subtitles. This is a good movie to watch on a Saturday afternoon when you have nothing else to do but sit back and watch a large monster destroyed Tokyo again and again.",1457222400,2,1913,4.2727272727272725
