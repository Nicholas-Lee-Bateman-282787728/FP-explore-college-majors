7937954,3,B00005BK5B,Okay film. Saw an error in opening of the film.  As a Mn resident i noticed the HHH Metrodome in the opening shot. The text reads 1978 Meatloaf concert in Mpls. The Dome didn't exist until 1982.,1508284800,,194,4.243243243243243

7937958,5,B00005BK5B,"In a word:  Inspirational.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this film.

A man who faced his demons and never forgot he was told ""he would never amount to anything.""  He proved ALL of them wrong!  Let this be a lesson to all of those who have listened to all of the naysayers and let their negative words penetrate their souls.  Congratulations - Meat Loaf!  You proved all of your critics wrong!  People need to shut their uninformed and idiotic mouths of what they cannot and never will comprehend.  Greatness is found in the most unsuspecting places.  Open your minds and open your hearts and you just might learn something - an underdog will always rise to the occasion.  Screw the experts.  After all, Einstein was told he would ""never amount to anything.""  God always has the final word!",1421625600,,777,4.666666666666667

I still have my VHS copy, but I want it on DVD.
Put this thing on DVD! Folks will buy it, if someone ever does.",1402876800,9,170,3.5
7937960,5,B00005BK5B,"W Earl Brown plays the role of the legendary singer ""Meat Loaf""... Lots of good music along with the ups and down Meat had to endure before climbing back on top of the charts..",1374883200,,176,4.205882352941177
7937961,5,B00005BK5B,"I saw this in vh1 and became an instant fan of this huge guy named MeatLoaf. this movie is a sad story from his childhood to adult life.
Had to buy it. His story show you can achive ypur dreams even when everyone else can't see it and makes fun of it.",1215302400,4,251,3.8461538461538463
7937962,5,B00005BK5B,"Although taking into account all of the ""inaccuracies"" in this movie, it is definitely worth a look for the average Meat Loaf fan. I was fortunate enough to catch this flick on VH1 Classic one night, and I thought the  performance of W. Earl Brown was stellar. He may have been lip-syncing, but still a powerful performance indeed.",1193529600,7,331,4.706896551724138
7937963,5,B00005BK5B,"Meat Loaf's stuggling young life with an alcaholic father who abused him, and a dieing mother with cancer.  His struggles with becoming famous when everyone was closing the door on him.  (I hope they are kicking themselves now).  Then his tragic downfall, loosing his voice, being taken by people he loved and trusted.  Then his strenght to fight back years later to become the man he is today. A very moving movie.  I watch it almost every day.  I can't get enough of it.  The actor W. Earl Brown does a very good job playing Meat.  You almost forget that it's not Meat.  This is a must have movie for any Meat lover.  I have an autistic granddaughter who loves this movie.  She is 4 years and will sit down a watch it over and over.  Meat's biography has saved my live may times with my granddaughter, when she have a bad day and is grumpy I put it on and she comes running to see it. I give it ***** + stars.",1022371200,20,911,4.202312138728324
