When singing ad-libbing opera to playing drunk and making pet shop animal sounds into the phone to singing with trying not to sneeze it's packed with hilarious comedy and wackiness that you'd want to see it again.

436783,5,6302227178,This is the best Danny Kaye movie. He plays the parts of two twins: a genius and a night-club singer who is engaged to his partner. The singer witnesses a mureder but before the trial he gets killed and becomes a ghost so he calls on his super-identical twin to fill in for him.  This is by far the most side-splitting Danny Kaye I have ever seen!,988329600,3,347,4.17910447761194

436786,2,6302227178,"Danny Kaye fans will enjoy this movie, as will viewers who are just interested in a mild diversion.
But among the Danny Kaye films available on video, ""Wonder Man"" is by far the worst. Over and over again,  without reprieve for the entire 95-minute running time, it flogs the same  extremely tired joke - talking to a ghost while other people nearby think  you're crazy and/or talking to them. (""Blithe Spirit"" did this  kind of scene much better, and didn't over-use the device.)
""Wonder  Man"" suffers from other shortcomings. Too many times, Danny Kaye  self-indulgently parades his low-brow vaudeville act, apparently thinking  that his facial contortions and funny accents should be enough to reduce an  audience to hysterical laughter. And he does this from virtually the first  scene to the last. The director should have imposed more discipline.
The  plot development was poor and incoherent. Granted, plot is never the  cornerstone of a light comedy, but one expects some competence in  story-telling. This was missing. ""Wonder Man"" rushes into its  beginning and rushes into its end, and in between the story languishes for  minutes at a time with no progress, then suddenly lurches forward to try to  make up for lost time. One gets the impression that there were major  differences of artistic opinion among the director, the screenwriter, and  the star, and that these differences were settled on each occasion with a  dartboard.
Danny Kaye was a wonderful comic actor, not because he could  contort his face, but because he could play an Everyman, faced with unusual  circumstances, who could rise to the occasion with a certain  self-deprecation and pathos that most viewers can empathize with. Viewers  who have not yet discovered Danny Kaye should check out ""The Court  Jester"" or ""The Inspector General"" which, unlike  ""Wonder Man"", show him off at his best.",952732800,13,1875,5.072131147540984

Kaye plays a dual role, a brash entertainer who gets bumped off by mobsters and then comes back as a ghost to get his dweebish twin to bring the bad guys to justice. Since this is a comedy\musical you can expect some vintage Kaye slapstick and some good dancing. Look for Vera-Ellen as one of Kaye's love interests.

So it was a wonderful film to watch.
I am planning to collect all Danny Kaye films if I can, why I didn't do it before I do not know, except I didn't have a laptop until last year, as a result it has become very tempting to do so! I have to say my favourit at the moment is 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty', a brilliant film, we couldn't stop laughing!

437444,4,6302227178,"Mostly, I enjoy Danny Kaye. I consider him to be a close second as the funniest redhead in showbiz. He comes across as this warm and gentle guy with massive comedic and musical gifts who, perhaps, at times, had a penchant for too much mugging (but maybe his writers were to blame). He exhibited a flair for contorting his face into these funny expressions and for introducing songs rife with glib, rapid-fire double speak and tongue twisters. He was also a natural at physical slapstick. With the success of his first starring role in the 1944 feature UP IN ARMS, the powers-that-be in Hollywood couldn't wait to throw Danny Kaye back onto the public consciousness. So, a year later, Kaye's second feature film WONDER MAN was released.

The outrageous plot: When carefree and popular nightclub performer Buster Dingle (Danny Kaye), whose stage name is ""Buzzy Bellew,"" is gunned down for having witnessed a murder, his ghost comes back and convinces his shy, bookish twin brother, Edwin Dingle (also Danny Kaye), to pose as himself until things are set right.

Except that Edwin, who may have a photographic mind and may be able to write simultaneously with both hands, is a life-long maladroit and needs all the help he can get in the unfamiliar world of savvy crooks and glitzy show business. And that help comes in the form of Buster's ghost as, often, events conspire to force Buster to take over Edwin's body to bail him out of a jam, with predictably zany results. Eventually, after some more farcical bits and several wacky musical numbers, the bad guy is nabbed and the girl is won over.

Even with sumptuous eye candy being provided by a game Virginia Mayo, who plays the lovely and wholesome librarian Ellen, and newbie Vera-Ellen, here making her film debut as club entertainer and Buzzy's fiancee Midge, the main draw is still Danny Kaye. His wife Sylvia Fine, throughout Danny's career, has excelled in writing specialty lyrics and songs which ideally suited his talents for mimicry and double speak. She contributes here with ""Bali Boogie"" and adapts the Russian song ""Otchi Tchorniya"" to Danny Kaye's particular brand of musical mayhem. I'm not sure if she has anything to do with Kaye's uproarious skewering of opera near the end, although I would suspect...yeah.

In the course of his acting career, Danny Kaye's resume boasted less than 20 feature films. WONDER MAN falls somewhere just below his very best cinematic works. For my money, his two best pictures are THE COURT JESTER and THE FIVE PENNIES. In fact, I consider THE INSPECTOR GENERAL and THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY to be better than WONDER MAN. Here, Kaye mugs just a bit too often for my taste. I don't much care for his telephoned barnyard noises, and his ""Palpably Inadequate Blues"" routine in Prospect Park gratingly channels Jerry Lewis at his histrionical worst. Sadly, a good portion of the gags in this film is too broad and dated.

Now, with all that, I can't quite bring myself to give a Danny Kaye film a rating below three stars. I'll always feel that his potential was never fully tapped, but in other films and even in several scenes in this one, we get a glimpse of how entertaining and talented this man is. To quote several of the extras in this film: ""What a guy."" WONDER MAN, with its flaws, is still pretty diverting stuff and solidly delivers on what the audience expects, which is Danny Kaye unleashed. It's a good enough flick and merits 3.5 out of 5 stars.",1332720000,3,3463,4.75540765391015
437445,4,6302227178,"I was very happy with my purchase. The movie was good quality, slightly grainy, but very enjoyable to watch! Received very quickly; however, there was no packaging slip inside.

437446,4,6302227178,"Yes, it's an oldy moldy but a great laugh for the movie buff.  Danny Kaye plays two parts at once and often in the same ""body"" bouncing from one to the other.  If you want to laugh with a movie, thoroughly enjoy a classic, this is your movie.  Don't let the fact that it's old stop you from watching it.  You just might be surprised . . .",1322265600,3,338,3.926470588235294
437447,5,6302227178,"After striking gold with the army comedy ""Up In Arms"", MGM quickly lined up another vehicle for the irrepressible Danny Kaye: ""Wonder Man"" (1945). This dizzy, typically-splashy MGM production cast Kaye in two roles: As a brash, fun-loving nightclub entertainer (Buzzy Bellew), and as his timid, bookish librarian twin brother. The gist of the story is this: Buzzy is scheduled to testify against a mobster, but gets bumped off before the big day. Enter the bookworm brother, whom Buzzy's spirit persuades to impersonate him in order to flush out the killer(s). Naturally, he gets entangled in his dead brother's affairs, particularly with his girlfriend (Vera-Allen) and the lovely Virginia Mayo (who would be Kaye's leading lady in three more films).
There are some wonderfully inspired comedy bits: The absent-minded ""potato salad"" routine; Kaye's frequent cries of ""BUSTER!"" in times of peril; his zany park encounter with his brother's spirit; and the climactic opera as Kaye ""encodes"" a message for help to police in song. Besides Mayo, there are some familiar faces in the cast, especially Natalie Shaffer, years before ""Gilligan's Island"" but recognizable with her trill-like Mrs. Howell voice. And of course, there are the over-the-top musical numbers which Kaye tackles with relish.
The chink in the armor is Kaye's screen characterization; it wouldn't be until a few films later in which the producers slowed down Kaye's pace and toned down his manic behavior.
Still, this film showed Kaye as a ""work in progress"", and off to a dazzling start!",1320969600,2,1553,5.216

Ever since I have wanted to review it, but chance never came my way, until I got the idea to buy it on Amazon. That done I saw it again, and, amazingly, it is reasonably fresh, despite its age. One of DK's classic masterworks (only equalled by The Secret Life of Walter Mitty), and I sincerely think, it has stood its test. Now the ultimate trial awaits: Showing it to my children and grandchildren - I hesitate a bit, but I hope the best :-)

437566,4,6302227178,"Along with THE KID FROM BROOKLYN, this is my favorite Danny Kaye film.  Kaye is actually experiencing a mild resurgence among younger people these days because of the inclusion of the great song he did with the Andrews Sisters, ""Civilization,"" in the soundtrack for the hugely successful game FALLOUT 3 (actually one of the best soundtracks of the past couple of years).  There is no question that Kaye was a major, unique talent.  Most of his films have not held up especially well.  They are very much products of the sensibility of the times and don't feel as timeless as the best of the Marx Brothers or Astaire and Rogers.  Over the course of a feature length film he can come across as somewhat over-the-top.  He sometimes is more silly than funny.  Nonetheless, at his best he can be hysterical.

This was the first of a string of films that Kaye made at Goldwyn, usually with Virginia Mayo as the female lead.  He had the previous year been in UP IN ARMS with Dinah Shore and Dana Andrews in a supporting role, but he pretty much stole the movie with one of his more memorable patter songs.  Not everything in this film works and the humor is often strained, but Kaye has so much charm and he throws himself into the film with so much energy that he overwhelms the weaknesses by sheer force of will.  My biggest complaint with the film is that there weren't more musical numbers.  ""Bali Boogie"" is so charming that you wish there had been two or three more like it.  Instead, the film is limited to four musical numbers, one of them a surprisingly flat version of ""Otchi Tchorniya"" by Kay.  ""So in Love,"" however, with Vera-Ellen dancing (though as always her voice was dubbed) is nearly as much fun as ""Bali Boogie.""  This was, by the way, Vera-Ellen's first movie.  She is one of my favorite performers from the forties and fifties, an utterly delightful dancer possessed of remarkable girl-next-door beauty.

All in all this is a tremendously entertaining film, the kind of popular entertainment that Hollywood seemed capable of churning out in seemingly unending quantities in the forties.  And it remains perhaps the presentation of Danny Kaye's unique abilities on film.  Oh, and if you pay attention, the sailor in the park near the beginning of the film is played by Huntz Hall, at this point in his career formerly of the Dead End Kids, some of whom would join together to form the better known Bowery Boys, in which Hall would achieve renown as Sach.",1258156800,6,2468,4.645161290322581

While this still has the Sylvia Fine touch (meaning that you will feel in some scenes like you've watched him doing that before, even if he hasn't) it's always fun.",1243641600,2,492,4.444444444444445

437574,3,6302227178,"This is not a review of the movie itself but of the quality of the print being offered.  The movie is well worth owning and this seems to be the only ""rare"" edition available.  However the print itself seems fair at best.  Though the color is bright enough the shading tends toward the dark side, and the focus is a bit fuzzy.  There are no extras - on my copy the film starts immediately with the menu at the end.  When it says ""digitally remastered"" I consider that it has been cleaned up to a sparkling print.  This has all the feel of a pirated copy to me, though I don't believe that is due to the sellers.  It may indeed be legit but I must say I am disaapointed in the quality.  I know some folks don't seem to mind the quality of materials on their DVDs as much as I might, but for those looking for a clean crisp print, this isn't it.  Though it will have to do until whoever owns the licensing for it puts up a decent tribute to Danny Kaye and these Samuel Goldman films - which are wonders in themselves.  Normally a five star movie - this edition gets three for lower quality.",1209168000,50,1088,4.1380952380952385

437716,5,6302227178,Danny Kaye plays two parts; 1) A dead twin brother who is a singer/dancer and 2) his identical book worm brother. The 2 men merge together and causes chaos and perfect comedy with great songs. His love interest is Virginia Mayo.,1181433600,6,228,4.585365853658536
437717,4,6302227178,"Mostly, I enjoy Danny Kaye. I consider him to be a close second as the funniest redhead in showbiz (do I even have to mention who the funniest one is?). He comes across as this warm and gentle guy with massive comedic and musical gifts who, perhaps, at times, had a penchant for too much mugging (but maybe his writers were to blame). He exhibited a flair for funny facial expressions and for introducing songs rife with glib, rapid-fire double speak and tongue twisters and was also a natural at physical comedy. With the success of his first starring role in the 1944 feature UP IN ARMS, the powers-that-be in Hollywood couldn't wait to throw Danny Kaye back into the public consciousness. So, a year later, Kaye's second feature film WONDER MAN was released.

Here's the outrageous plot: When carefree and popular nightclub performer Buster Dingle (Danny Kaye), whose stage name is Buzzy Bellew, is gunned down for having witnessed a murder, his ghost comes back and convinces his shy, bookish twin brother Edwin Dingle (also Danny Kaye) to pose as himself until things are set right.

But Edwin, who may have a photographic mind and may be able to write simultaneously with both hands, is a life long maladroit and needs all the help he can get in the unfamiliar world of savvy crooks and glitzy show business. And that help comes in the form of Buster's ghost as, often, events conspire to force Buster to take over Edwin's body to bail him out of a jam, with predictably zany results. Eventually, after some more farcical bits and several wacky musical numbers, the bad guy is nabbed and the girl is won over.

With sumptuous eye candy being provided by a game Virginia Mayo, who plays the lovely and wholesome librarian Ellen, and newbie Vera-Ellen, here making her film debut as club entertainer and Buzzy's fiancee Midge, the main draw here is still Danny Kaye. His wife Sylvia Fine, throughout Danny's career, has excelled in writing specialty lyrics and songs which ideally suited his talents for mimicry and double speak. She contributes here with ""Bali Boogie"" and adapts the Russian song ""Otchi Tchorniya"" to Danny Kaye's particular brand of musical mayhem. I'm not sure if she has anything to do with Kaye's uproarious skewering of opera near the end, although I would suspect...yeah.

In the course of his acting career, Danny Kaye's resume boasts less than 20 feature films. WONDER MAN falls somewhere just below his very best cinematic works. For my money, his two best pictures are THE COURT JESTER (1956) and THE FIVE PENNIES (1959). In fact, I consider THE INSPECTOR GENERAL (1949) and THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY (1947) to be better than WONDER MAN. Here, Kaye mugs just a bit too often for my taste. I don't much care for his telephoned barnyard noises, and his ""Palpably Inadequate Blues"" routine in Prospect Park gratingly channels Jerry Lewis at his histrionical worst. Sadly, a good portion of the gags in this film is too broad and dated.

Now, with all that, I can still never quite bring myself to give a Danny Kaye film a rating below three stars, and I've seen just about all of 'em. I'll always feel that his potential was never fully tapped, but in other films and even in several scenes in this one, we get a glimpse of how entertaining and talented this man is. To quote several of the extras in this film: ""What a guy."" WONDER MAN, with its flaws, is still pretty diverting stuff and solidly delivers on what the audience expects, which is Danny Kaye unleashed. It's a good enough flick and merits three and a half stars.",1171238400,51,3562,4.71107544141252
437718,4,6302227178,"I haven't had a chance to see a lot of Danny Kaye movies over the years.  By the time I came around his Hollywood days were pretty much behind him and were replaced by his UNICEF work.  The Danny Kaye movies I have seen over the years were often mediocre at best.  There were times I could tell he had talent but the scripts and the directors apparently had less.  In ""Wonder Man"" I sat back in appreciation of the wide range of talent he has.  His gift for accents and his facial animations were on display and the script and direction seemed to realize that Kaye was the key to the movie.  His portrayal of a Russian singer with hayfever was inspired (although I wondered if that would actually work as a nightclub act).  My favorite was the first number he did.  The mixture of dance, song, and humor made it a great, all around exhibition.  The supporting cast was mediocre; this was Kaye's show from beginning to end.  If you're curious as to what kind of talent Danny Kaye had, ""Wonder Man"" is the movie to watch.",1143849600,6,1019,4.343915343915344

437721,5,6302227178,"""Wonder Man"" may not have the most credible of storylines of Danny Kaye's work, but it has some of the finest moments of pure anarchic ad-libbing and timing you will ever get to see after the Marx brothers.
The story--of diametrically opposite twins, one a shy suburban academic and the other a wacky showman with mafia links--is curious and the plot is strained. But that does not restrict  the brilliant Danny Kaye. In a memorable scene after the twin in showbusiness is killed, his ghost takes over the body of the twin in central park. And Danny Kaye gets to do his celebrated Russian opera singer routine, which is itself worth the price of the DVD or VHS. The ending, with Danny Kaye doing Opera in pig-Italian, is to be seen to be believed.
This movie is right up there with ""Duck Soup"", ""A night at the Opera"" and other such classics of comedy",1020297600,28,851,4.525974025974026
