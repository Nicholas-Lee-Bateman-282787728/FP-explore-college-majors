7202001,5,B00XVRPVOE,"Wow! I really enjoyed this movie. I know it's been done many times before but who doesn't enjoy a good ghost story or a movie about killer dolls? I loved everything about this movie. I thought the story was unique and the pacing kept the film moving nicely along. I really enjoyed the music and sound effects for this movie. The music kept the creepiness factor pretty consistent throughout the film.

Dead Silence isn't your typical horror movie and I think it's worth checking out, if you're a fan of this type of movie. The movie doesnt contain a lot of gore but its genuinely creepy and filled with plenty of scares. Theres also a couple plot twists that I personally didn't see coming especially the ending!

As for the Unrated Blu-ray from Universal Pictures, I couldn't find anything wrong with the picture or sound at all. The image is crisp and clear. Everything about this film is dark, so don't expect to see a lot of bright colors. The dark colors, sets and locations only enhance the creepiness factor. The DTS-HD master audio and DTS digital 5.1 sound came through my home theatre system with no problems and it sounded great.

Beware the stare of Mary Shaw. If you scream, you're dead!  What happened to Mary Shaw and why has she haunted the small town of Ravens Fair all these years? On the same night a mysterious package arrives, former resident of Ravens Fair Jamie Ashen comes home to find his wife Lisa brutally murdered and he quickly becomes the only suspect in her murder. Could the package he received, have anything to do with his wifes death? Desperate to find out who murdered his wife, Jamie returns to Ravens Fair to bury her and unlock the mystery Mary Shaw. Will Jamie be the next victim?  Youll have to buy it to find out.

7202005,1,B00XVRPVOE,This has to be one of the least entertaining horror films I have ever seen. The idea was great but the execution was poor. Just another generic plot line with anticipated scares and a far too darkly lit ambiance for its own good. It's painful to see a great idea turn into just another silly b-movie.,1439769600,,300,4.375
7202006,5,B00XVRPVOE,Finally this very under appreciated and underrated horror film is getting a U.S. Blu-Ray release this summer. Such a great horror film from horror genius James Wan and one his leasted talked about films. Excited for August 11th.,1436227200,5,228,5.026315789473684

7202015,4,B00XVRPVOE,"Ive always felt this was a very underrated horror film. The atmosphere in this film is very good, especially in the old theater, just a creepy look to the whole set. Basic story is a woman named Mary Shaw was a ventriloquist who thought of her dolls as her family, something happens (don't wanna spoil it) & her ghost comes for revenge. There is also a slight twist at the end that I really didn't see coming. Actors were good, especially the actress who plays Mary Shaw, she has a very creepy aura about her & even her stare is a little unnerving. There isn't a lot of blood or gore here but it makes up for it in mood & setting. Extras include interviews, trailer & featurettes. If you are a horror fan & haven't seen this one yet id highly recommend giving it chance.",1457222400,6,770,4.280821917808219

8716836,5,B00XVRPVOE,"Creepy and Gothic horror movie about a cadre of ventriloquist figures able to be possessed by the spirit of a dead ventriloquist, Mary Shaw who is out to seek revenge on the descendants of those who lynch mobbed her many decades in the past. If you are expecting Chucky this is not it, there are no killer dolls which is great. It is a straight up Ghost story. Is it silly and cliche in places? Yes, it is. The movie as a whole is a forgotten classic that was always worthy of a sequel as it ended so abruptly and the antagonist is definitely creepy. Highly recommended. I as excited to find it on Blu-ray. I wish that they would have used the original title of the movie which was simply ""Silence"".",1525478400,,699,4.303030303030303
