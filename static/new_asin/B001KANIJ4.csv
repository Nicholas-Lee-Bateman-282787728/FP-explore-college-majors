That said, I've seen some of the footage before and I'm not sure why some of the material was included; I did enjoy the stuff that was new to me, probably because, as I said earlier, I suppose I'm easily entertained...lol. No matter, I did like this video although it's not my favorite..",1347062400,,369,4.606060606060606
