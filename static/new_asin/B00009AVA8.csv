1882240,5,B00009AVA8,"The movie is based on the infamous ""Stanford Prison Experiment"" conducted in 1971. A makeshift prison is set up in a research lab...
The story is easy,there's an experiment going on and they choose 20 men to make it happen,it's a mock prison,8 of those guys are guards and 12 are prisoners, They'll all get well paidd for lasting 20 days and they can go away from the experiment anytime they feel like it. The main character is a prisoner and he doesn't like rules very much so that's when the punishment begins.
Excellent camera work,great casting because they really deliver and great timing makes this movie a masterpiece you have to see.
A Masterpiece from Germany...unbelieveable... Adriano",1051574400,2,695,4.898305084745763
1882241,5,B00009AVA8,"I saw this movie initially through a free screening. I must say that I had not heard of it ahead of time, nor knew much going in (besides the fact that it would be in German and that it looked pretty cool on its website). I did not really know too much of what to expect, and I was not thrilled that I would have to read subtitles. I was blown away! This movie is such a rollercoaster. It is the epidemy of a psychological thriller. Also, it is just such an interesting and disturbing view on human behavior. I don't know if I would have even seen this movie if it hadn't been for the free screening, but I have already paid and seen it again with another friend. All that I can say is that it is a really good movie that will stay with you afterwards. (see this movie!!!)",1033257600,5,772,4.0855263157894735
1882242,5,B00009AVA8,"I have never seen any movie in my entire life that layered emotional strain and suspense as effectively and believably as this movie. One thing naturally lead to another in this suspense-thriller about how power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  The movie is penetrating, thought provoking, and unsettling. It's one you can't walk away from and just forget about.  Tremendously acted and directed, this German film rivals such American blockbusters as ""The Green Mile"" or ""The Shawshank Redemption.""  See it. Be entertained, if you can take it.",1032739200,5,561,5.3522727272727275
1882243,5,B00009AVA8,"I will always remember this movie for its unflinching gaze at what can happen when good research subjects go bad. Watching this, one quickly forgets that these are actors playing at the ""let's pretend we're in prison"" game, and the shattering realism of it all is enough to make you squirm, if not scream. Apparently, in Germany, where the movie was watched widely, some viewers ended up throwing up or fainting in horror.
This isn't, of course, your average B-movie horror we're talking about either. The horror is in what people can do to one another, if given enough stimulus and just enough power. Stanford University experiment on which the movie is supposedly based actually was terminated before it escalated as much as the situation in the movie does. So it's all too easy to imagine how the events would have unfolded if somebody wise didn't just say NO. Plenty of characters in Das Experiment probably would have wished it was so.
The movie is very lucid, realistic, and keeps you at the edge of the seat at all times. Bleibtrau who also played Lola's boyfriend in Run Lola Run is an astonishing actor, projecting an image of an average man in an abnormal situation, but also someone who is extraordinary enough to be able to deal with it and survive it. The story of experiment is interwoven with the patches of love affair that he initiates shortly beforehand with a woman who crashes into his car. The movie is contemplative and quiet when it needs to be - frantic when it gains momentum. Great techno music serves as an accompaniment (although I didn't recognize the bands they used).
Another great German flick... I hope they keep'em coming!",1030752000,14,1656,4.753472222222222
1882244,5,B00009AVA8,"Recently we have seen many brilliant German films -- such as ""Run Lola Run"" -- and now, another superb film comes from that country, with the same Moritz Bleibtreu (who was Manni, Lola's love).  But this time, the thrilling film ""Das Experiment"" is excellent for totally different reasons.
A taxi driver Tarek (Bleibtreu) sees an ad on a newspaper that looks very interesting, which read: ""Participants Needed.  2 Weeks in a Mock Prison.  Reward 4,000 German marks.""  He decides to apply, is accepted, and goes to a university where this experiment is to be done.
The ""experiment"" is conducted as follows: 20 participants are divided into to groups, 8 ""guards"" and 12 ""prisoners.""  The former group were given uniform, handcuffs and other equipments while the latter are required to live in a small cell, wearing only a long white jacket.  Though no violence is allowed on both sides, the ""guards"" set up 6 rules for the ""prisoners"" to obey.  In case of emergency, the professors provide monitoring cameras that relay the images to the controlling room where the supervisors are supposed to watch over every detail of the behaivors of the participants.  In this way, the first day starts.
But, as the days pass, the at first peaceful relations between the two groups start to get intensified.  Some slight scuffle  develops into a bigger and more serious fight and even the uprising of Tarek (now called No. 77), and those ""guards"" and ""prisoners,"" ordinary people up until then, seriously start to struggle for the power, using unnecessary method of torturing and humiliating prisoners.  The ""experiment,"" revealing the brutal human nature under ever-increasing pressure, goes more than the intellectual professors expected, and everything results in inevitable catastrophy.
The premise of this psychological thriller is so simple (and some may remember Samuel Fuller's ""Shock Corridor"") that you may be incredulous reading my summery, but I can tell you that this film is really harrowing and traumatic, and at the same time very gripping as a thriller.  If my review lead you to think that this film is all about violence, you are mistaken.  ""Das Experiment"" is, in my opinion, a first-rate psychological drama, or psychological thriller that will rivet your heart slowly but steadily, like any best Hitchcock films.  But you must be also warned.  Some scenes realize those humiliations of characters including Tarek in a so disturbing way -- for instance, his hair is all shaven by the secret attack by the guards -- that you stop even breathing with eyes nailed on the nightmare visions the first-time director (as feature) Oliver Hirschbiegel shows.
""Das Experiment"" is an example of superb storytelling and observations on humans (and surprisingly, it contains some romance in it).  Though some parts of the film seem to go too far (the university will not, I think, do this sloppy job), ""Das Experiment,"" absorbing thriller and thought-provoking study on humanity, should not be missed.
Finally some confusing things should be made clear.  The film is based on the book ""Black Box"" by Mario Giordano, of which story is based on the psychological experiment conducted by Stanford University.  Some audience might think that this film is directly based on this ""Stanford Prison Experiment.""  The experiment itself is really a historical truth, but the film, set in today's German, clearly doesn't draw what actually happened at this university.  But this fact doesn't reduce the value of the film at all.",1030320000,46,3510,5.113835376532399
1882257,2,B00009AVA8,"Anyone who's read the back of the box knows how this one is going to end--badly, likely with any number of people dead. So you think, well. Maybe it'll say something new or interesting about the Stanford prison experiment situation, the whole power-corrupts-absolutely bit. Maybe it'll be thoughtful.

And I do think the film *tries.* A little.

SPOILERS

But, particularly in the last third, it gives in to the temptation to titillate using violence, rather than comment on violence. What was a decently-shot and not half-badly acted film goes off into an action-movie-style finale that kicks off with attempted rape (what, you thought there were women in this movie to be actual characters and not sexual targets?) and continues on into a chase scene that includes martial arts and a snazzy black coat. (Did anyone else feel Matrix vibes throughout the film? The movie starting and ending with Linkin Park songs probably helped this association in my mind).

1882260,1,B00009AVA8,"Though I must admit that the acting is generally pretty good, especially from the lead actor, as well as compelling photography, my problem with this film is that, in my opinion, it absolutely depends on being able to convince the viewer that the small psychological ""turns"" that are taken onto the path of violence, and even killing, would be irresistible for the viewer too, and this simply did not happen for me. Any viewer who reads the description on the cover of the DVD would know what the outcome of the film was going to be, so there is no interest in this; what is of interest is to be able to identify with the decisions of the characters who turn to violence by small increments - the coming to power of the Nazi regime in Germany being a perfect example of this process - and I just couldn't buy it, so the film simply deteriorated into silly and laughable violence (such as the incarceration of the experimenters which did not happen in the original experiment, AND there was no killing!), and had nothing to say about the tragic inevitability of violence among humans, and the corrupting force of power, which is what I think it set out to do. Big idea, good idea, but just no subtlety or psychological nous from the the script writer and the director.",1324339200,,1267,4.537117903930131
1882261,4,B00009AVA8,"Viewed the 2010 USA version of this story first, and was impressed with the subject matter and acting. Being a fan of foreign films, I purchased this 2001 German version thinking the constraints of the conservative American film industry would be absent. Wrong. This German version is more tame and lacks the grittiness and isolationism of the USA version. In this German version, for example, the experimentors intract with the subjects, allowing a ""guard"" to rape one of the female lab assistants. In the USA version, expereimentors play a passive role and are reepresented by a red light, which, if it lights up, indicates a rule has bee broken, and the experiment will end. Participants constantly watch to see if their actions cause the light to glow. Of course, the rape occurs between a guard and an inmate. Isolationism is further enhanced in the USA version when the participants are bussed out to a mock prison in a remote building in the middle of a field. In the German version, they are simply in the wing of a building which also houses the experimentors.
Even though I enjoyed the USA version better, they are both great films. If you've seen one, I urge you to see the other.",1315008000,,1191,4.730769230769231
1882262,5,B00009AVA8,"You might have heard of the Stanford Prison Experiment, in which volunteers who were separated into prisoners and guards became completely absorbed by their roles under one week.  Or you might have heard of The Third Wave, a high school teacher's demonstration of how Germans could become so caught up in Nazi pride that they ignored the abuses of their own regime.  These stories are based on real experiments.  Das Experiment is not real, but that doesn't detract from its impact.

Philip Zimbardo's prison experiment devolved quickly; guards became sadistic and prisoners became passive.  Zimbardo only ended the experiment when his girlfriend (an outsider) objected on moral grounds. Caught up in his own power as pretend prison warden, Zimbardo had succumbed to a power structure he helped create.  Director Oliver Hirschbiegel asks: What if he didn't stop?

And so Das Experiment leaps from the precipice of academic psychology into the reeking filth of the human soul.  When Professor Klaus Thon (Edgar Selge) decides to continue the experiment over his colleague's wishes (Dr. Jutta Grimm, played by Andrea Sawatzki), the guards escalate their punishments.  Rules are broken, lines are crossed, and lives are threatened. There are far worse things than death in a prison, and Das Experiment explores every sordid nook and cranny.

Hirschbiegel uses several narrative devices to keep the story moving.  Prisoner #77, Tarek Fahd (Moritz Bleibtreu) wears a black-and-white spy cam in his faux glasses. There are security cameras everywhere.  Shaky reality-style cameras pursue action outside the purview of the surveillance footage. These camera tricks work effectively enough to let the audience into the experiment without seeming too intrusive. Intercut with the unrelenting prison scenes are shots of Dora (Maren Eggert), who is fond of walking around in her underwear in tight tank-tops. Hirschbiegel manipulates the audience as deftly as Thon manipulates the volunteers in his experiment, and he knows just which buttons to push: lust, greed, loneliness, rage, and most of all fear.

In light of so many gore-drenched modern movies, Das Experiment is surprisingly tame. With the swing of a nightstick, the lustful eye of a guard, or the sneer of one man in power over another who cowers naked before him, we know that Das Experiment is playing for keeps.  This is one role-playing game where nobody wins.",1306627200,,2415,5.27154046997389
1882263,4,B00009AVA8,"This was the directorial debut of Olivier Hirschbiegel who has gone on to do some excellent cinema, most notably 'Downfall' Downfall (1 Disc Edition) [DVD] [2004]. For a first time out this is an accomplished piece of cinema and once again shows that Germany can make excellent films without pandering to the US market which sadly is too often the case with British efforts. Starring Moiritz Bleibtrau (Run Lola Run and The Baader Meinhoff Complex) and Christian Berkel (Downfall and Flame and Citron) they also collaborated with Olivier again in 'European Mavericks, which alas I have yet to see.

The plot is simple but effective in that some Psychologists place an advert for volunteers to take part in an experiment in behavioural attitudes of the incarcerated and those that are entrusted to guard them. It is for a fixed fee and a fixed period and after a few mind tests they are allocated their designated roles. They are then told that violence is not allowed, but the guards figure that means only the physical sort and so start to push the boundaries.

This is a compelling fast paced film which keeps up the momentum almost all the way through. There is one bizarre moment where the 'love interest' enters the life of the main character and the music goes all jazz night club sax solo in a totally unnecessary way to denote rumpy pumpy will be in the offing in the not too distant future - pointless. Still clich&eacute; errors aside this is still ein corker of a film and has been remade in Hollywood with an excellent cast including Forest Whitaker, but I am reliably informed that this is oodles better and it is a lot cheaper in amazon market place. For lovers of European cinema I can highly recommend you will not be disappointed.",1302566400,2,1747,4.705882352941177
1882264,5,B00009AVA8,"In a society obsessed with reality television (myself included), `Das Experiment' sheds some increasingly disturbed light on the realities behind that `reality'.  Based (probably quite loosely) on an actual psychological experiment conducted in 1971, `Das Experiment' takes an extreme look at the demise of humanity.  He film follows a young reporter, Tarek Fahd, who goes undercover when a story presents itself to him.  He is asked to participate in a secret experiment that will place twelve men in prison cells to be guarded by eight guards while scientists study what follows.  The `criminals' will be stripped of their rights and the `guards' will have full control, but violence is strictly prohibited.  Enlisted as a `criminal', Fahd continually bucks the authority of the `guards', hoping to get an unauthorized rise out of the `guards', exposing the faulty kinks in the experiment.  What he didn't expect was the over-zealous scientist willing to allow minor indiscretions and a power-hungry `guard' willing to overstep reasonableness to make a point.

Insert madness here.

The film boils down to a ridiculously tense climax that literally had me seething with frustrations.  It all works though, despite its unapologetic preposterousness.  The demise of the key character's humanity overshadows the subtle reminders that these men are average individuals, just like you and me.  They are hiding from secrets, lying for prominence and eagerly seeking approval, whether in the form of general consensus or from their own self gratification.  The performances here all bolster the films rich subtext, adding believability and an undeniable relatable atmosphere to the film.

Power is a devastatingly remarkable tool.  It can be used to help and aid so many, but all too often power is used for selfish evilness.  `Das Experiment' underscores that emphatically.",1300320000,,1869,5.418685121107266
1882265,4,B00009AVA8,"This is a very good movie, what starts out as a ""joke"" turns into a real life situtation, things go way out of control. Actors do real good job in playing their parts. Loved watching it!",1259971200,,186,4.194444444444445
1882266,3,B00009AVA8,"LOL, okay maybe not the feel good movie of the year. ""This movie is a trip"" said the Blockbuster clerk when I was buying this, and yeah I agree. I don't know quite what to make of this movie. I have my undergraduate degree in psychology so I'm familiar with some historical psychological experiments gone wrong. In addition to the psychology experiment many of the reviews reference that took place in 1971 @ Stanford there have been other experiments conducted that show how shockingly horrible humans are capable of acting when given power over others. When you think about how something like this is not only completely possible but goes on every day in every country in one way, shape or form, then the movie becomes less enjoyable. Plus, I could have done without all the male nudity - where's the women's prison version?! ;)

At least the movie was not grotesque. I was concerned after I had purchased it that it might turn out to be some torturous gruesome flick, but it isn't. It's more along psychological lines of humiliation, torture and power.

One thing that I thought they missed on this movie was the background of at least the main ""prisoner"" and the main ""guard"" which have the power struggle during the movie. It was explained that these two people were selected for the experiment and put on opposite sides because they wanted the confrontation between them, but we don't have any background on their personality development so we can understand why they have fallen into these roles. And the side story we get about the main character's girlfriend is just silly and really adds nothing to the storyline.",1241913600,2,1623,4.772241992882562

Needless to say, the ""guards"" take advantage, soon becoming merciless overlords, and the ""convicts"" are reduced to objects of humiliation and degradation. This leads to a conclusion that shatters both mind and body of all involved, including the observing scientists! THE EXPERIMENT is a slice of psychological horror that delivers a drop-kick of profound insight into (in)human nature. Cold, claustrophobic, and effective. Highly recommended...

1882278,4,B00009AVA8,"A truly scary reflection of the way a small amount of power, in this case being made a Prison Guard, can change normal people into monsters - or so it would seem. However what I gathered from the film was that the experimenters knew that the two leading protaganists would end up at each others throats. Perhaps not literally but they were chosen with that in mind.

Obviously there has been quite a bit of spicing up of the original Stanford case and the addition/distraction of the gorgeous girlfriend seemed a little out of place as well. However the film is very well directed and equally well acted. After the initial setup the tension is gradually racked up until in the second half of the movie you realise that things are spiralling out of control.

So its a riveting watch, but not a film I will want to see again quickly as it is a sad reflection on our humanity (or lack of it).",1209772800,,889,4.414634146341464

It is a German Movie and subtitles can always be distracting, but it is in essence a phenomenal piece of work for all lovers of metaphysical understanding.
To exemplify here the whole story it would be rendering the suspense to oblivion: it's best to let the viewer make up his/her own vision without guidance; be it objective or subjective.
I truly enjoyed it and so did my wife: our recommendations have been gratified with many thanks.

The plot goes like this--20 men answered an ad asking for volunteers for a mock prison experiment with a payment at the end of 14 days of 4000 marks. The men were divided up into 12 prison guards and 8 prisoners. The first day, the division goes rather smoothly, with joking and laughter easing the tension. However, one of the prisoners, Tarek, is going to sell his experience to a newspaper and he tries to shake things up a bit with one of the guards. The use of violence isn't permitted, but humilation is, so the prisoners are stripped of their bed frames, their mattresses, their lights, and their smocks. I found it utterly chilling watching those grown men huddled in the dark stripped naked while the prison guards watched on the monitors, laughing about how they had regained their control. But as chilling as this was, things only get worse...

Much worse.

THE EXPERIMENT was completely shocking, horrifying and I suppose what made it even more compelling for myself was the question the film presented--does the potential for absolute corruption exist in all of us given the right circumstances? I can't shake that opening scene of the movie when all 20 of the men first meet and they're laughing and being friendly with each other and then in my mind I flash forward to the last ten minutes....

THE EXPERIMENT is riveting, you can't take your eyes off the screen, even when you wish you could. The images will stay with you for a long time. Check out THE EXPERIMENT only if you dare to... for this is serious horror my friends, made so by the secret beast that just might live in all of us.

1882283,4,B00009AVA8,"Das Experiment (Oliver Hirshbiegel, 2001)

Hirschbiegel, who stunned the world a few years back with Der Untergang, always had the chops to make tense, scary movies, and Das Experiment proves it. Also based on a true story, this is a film about a psychological experiment gone horribly wrong, as twenty volunteers are put into a prison situation, with eight ""guards"" and twelve ""prisoners,"" for two weeks. By the second day, the guards are acting like guards, and the prisoners are acting like prisoners, with the exception of Tarek Fahd (Munich's Moritz Bleibtreu), ostensibly a cab driver, but actually an undercover reporter (while the revelation of this in the film is wonderfully done, the DVD box spoils this little surprise, so I have no qualms about mentioning it here) who's covering the experiment for his paper. Things go horribly wrong in an astonishingly short amount of time, and while one of the doctors, Jutta Grimm (Andrea Sawatzki) begins to question the ethics of continuing the experiment, project leader Thon (Edgar Selge) is enthusiastic about the speed with which everything's going to pot. Needless to say, things get out of control, and everyone involved, including the viewer, quickly becomes aware that no matter what happens, there is no way this is going to end well.

Hirschbiegel is a fantastic director, and here as in Der Untergang he's got a solid stable of actors and a terrific script to back up his native talent. If you've seen Der Untergang (and even if you haven't), check this out. It's well worth your time. ****",1169683200,2,1554,4.973076923076923

1882317,4,B00009AVA8,"""Everyone should know he will be giving up his civil rights for two weeks."" This should have been a big red flag to the participants, though I suppose 4,000 dollars (or euros, marks or whatever currency they were promised) for two weeks could be easy money. By now everyone knows this film is based on some experiments at Stanford University in 1971. Thanks to such experiments, it is now also common knowledge people will behave in ways they normally would not in situations such as this, especially with the fear of reprisal removed. The methods are similar to the Ludovico treatment in ""A Clockwork Orange,"" in which an attempt is made to inure the participant by forcing him to watch sex and violence. He is then less apt to feel sympathy or remorse and a ""prisoner"" is compelled to conform by his inability to act or react. Most of the prisoners know the situation is contrived and therefore initially take it with a modicum of seriousness. Much the way a military trains its personnel in a contrived setting with its own set of rules, it is imperative in a controlled experiment such as this that participants buy into the set guidelines. Problems occur when individuals begin to test the limits. Control of the experiment is lost once Professor Thon zealously decides to break new ground, which requires relaxing the rule boundaries. (Given a choice, however, I'm certain he'd rather have his name in textbooks for something more positive than a debacle like this.) He expected a conflict between Berus and Fahd, though the extent to which he ignores and distorts rules contributes substantially to the loss of control. It is doubtless he had planned this. If nothing else, this film serves to underscore the importance of making certain that untrained people are not put into situations such as this, contrived or otherwise.

It is beyond the Stanford experiment, say the 1971 experiment were to be run for some more time it would be ""Das Experiment"". The basic question of ""Is violence  a major part of the undiscovered psycke of an ordinary human being?"" is unanswered, but the question is posed in a burning way. Sure it is R rated. The German Cinema is back in town with ""Lola rennt"",""Der Krieger und Die Kaiserin"",""Gegen Die Wand"",""Im Juli"",""Das Experiment"" and ""Good bye Lenin"".

An undercover reporter (Moritz Bleibtreu) goes for the shock value when he passes himself as a prisoner to a mock prison detention program where all of its participants are guinea pigs.  To the joy of Big Brother doctors, all hell breaks loose in no time.  Loosely based on a true-life case scenario depicted in the book Black Box by Mario Giordano (who also co-wrote the screenplay), THE EXPERIMENT will please those looking for big thrills.  Director Oliver Hirschbiegel delivers an outstanding movie in which psychological humiliation and physical violence take center stage.  All of the actors involved do a magnificent job, especially Justus von Dohnanyi as the shy introverted guard who soon becomes the leader of the pack.  His love-to-hate-him performance is as riveting and as disturbing as the film itself.

1882326,5,B00009AVA8,"In 1971 the psychologist Phil Zimbardo commenced a prison study that was about to change the rules for human behavioral science.  The study consisted of volunteers that were arranged as either prisoners or guards, as the study took place in the basement of Stanford's Psychology Department.  No formal training was given to the guards, as they were told to exercise their judgment in how to enforce the law.  Through five days of imprisonment the ""prisoners"" endured humiliation and degradation and they were forced to abort the study due to having generated a powerfully dangerous situation.  The Experiment is based of this study by Zimbardo; however, in this fictionalized version the audience gets to see how the study continues after five days.

Tarek Fahd (Moritz Bleibtreu) drives a taxi for a living and while waiting for a customer he stumbles across an ad for a research prison study.  Fascinated by the ad he applies for a part in the study, as the audience finds out that he also is a highly educated man who used to work as a journalist.  Through Tarek's old connections he gets a freelance job to provide inside information for a new paper while secretively filming the events in the simulated prison.  The study begins harmlessly, as the assigned guards are awkward in their role as prison guards while the prisoner's initially are entertained by the simulated situation.  Nonetheless, after a mere 24-hours the guards begin to exercise their powers and as the hours pass they become more comfortable in their role as guards and begin to enforce the law with callous authority.

During the time in the simulated prison Tarek, or prisoner #77, which is his new name, and the other inmates slowly begin to confuse the border between reality and make-believe.  In order for #77 to keep his sanity he often thinks and dreams of Dora (Maren Eggert), a young woman he met through a car accident just before being imprisoned in the illusion of a jail.  The thought of Dora seems to provide #77 a sense of connection with reality, and hope, much like his friend and inmate #82 (Oliver Stokowski) who dreams of a yellow Ferrari.  Yet, the hope and dream of being on the outside for something better quickly gets murkier, as the humiliation increases and the derogatory treatment of the inmates intensifies.  This continues while the scientists discuss the possibility of aborting the experiment, as it is deemed dangerous, but the experiment continues--something many will regret in the aftermath of the experiment.

Experiment will induce strong uncomfortable feelings in the audience.  Some will feel a level of disgust to the behavior and this could manifest itself in a feeling as if the intestines were tying themselves in a knot.  There are moments when the audience will want to turn their heads away, yet they cannot as what takes place in front of them is so distastefully hypnotizing as curiosity of what will happen next draws the audience to continue to watch.  This is cleverly created by Oliver Hirschbiegel who generates a similar curiosity that the scientists must be experiencing.  This notion also triggers a certain level of guilt within the audience for participating in the viewing of the film, as it makes the audience a silent participate in a manner similar to one of the prison guards.

The cast performs exceptionally, as the audience will begin to feel revulsion and maybe even hatred toward some of the guards.  However, can one blame the guards in the film, as the experiment encourages this absolute repulsive behavior when the guards begin to live their roles as guards?  Ultimately, the audience will feel disgust for what took place, yet the film leaves the audience in a contemplative mind-set of similar actions taking place where those who protect the law are not overseen.  For example, in prisons around the world, and the recent prison scandal in Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and elsewhere where similar incidents might not have been reported.  Another question that the film raises is whether convicts that experiences similar treatment will be rehabilitated to reenter the society after their release.

Director Oliver Hirschbiegel who recently made Downfall (2004) about Hitler's last day in the Berlin bunker brings this truly repulsive, yet important film to the audience.  The camera work, lighting, mise-en-scene, and script provide additional strength to the story, as the cast's performance ties it together in front of the camera with several strong performances.  Together these cinematic elements help create an experience that should be contemplated, as they provide an abhorrent event at a safe distance where the audience can learn the valuable lesson that the film provides.  Long after the screen has turned black and time has past since the viewing of Experiment, the audience will remember this film, which makes this film even more powerful.",1114300800,4,4903,5.042131350681537
1882356,5,B00009AVA8,"Few movies can truly disturb you at your core.  This movie is definitely one of them.  Based on an experiment conducted at Stanford University in the sixties (the outcome of which disturbed the researchers so greatly that they terminated the study prematurely), this movie goes beyond what actually occurred and explores the worst-case scenario-what could happen had the researchers lost complete control.

What is most disturbing about this movie is that it forces you to examine yourself.  The purpose of both the experiment and the movie is to get the audience to ask the question, ""Would I act like that if I was in the same situation?""  Both guards and prisoners were normal individuals prior to the onset of the experiment.  Psychological tests were given to evaluate whether they exhibited abnormal propensities for violence, authoritarianism, and mental stability.  All were given a clean slate.  Once you realize that most people would and do behave in similar fashion under the same stressors (except you of course), the movie takes on a new level of horror as it becomes all the more real.

Das Experiment is easily one of the best movies made on the subject of authoritarianism, but stands apart from most in that it gives the audience keen insight into some of the potential causes of prisoner abuse-a topic proven to be ever relevant (e.g. Abu Ghraib).  The power of expectation to shape our behavior cannot be underestimated.  It can transform a delinquent child into an honor role student (see the Pygmalion Effect) and turn a human being into a monster.",1105488000,3,1570,4.977011494252873

The first ninety minutes of the film are rather tepid and lacklustre with a uneven amount of character development, and the initial few days of incarceration are not exactly filled with mounting tension. After several false starts ,the conflict swiftly picks up between the antagonistic lead prisoner (an undercover reporter) and a power crazed & sadistic guard. Then, the film takes on quite a captivating and claustrophobic mood, and brutally violent in its conclusions.

The camera work is exceptional. The performances and thge script are superb. With special mention to both of the meaning roles. The concept of authority, and the fact of owning altough fifteen days , and how this circunstance slowly permeates the shadow places of the soul, showing how the human being can become in a true animal, just for that little amonut of power who seems to design a God`s messenger, or any religion.
In many aspects the film is a true collage of many relevant facts that the use of the violence and the resistence to it, can affect the psiquis , the behavior and the ethics of any human being in similar conditions, the horror (do you remember the last Brando`s speech in Apocalyse now?), the supreme efforts to surviving above all the troubles, the great support of the memory in circunstances beyond the edge conditions.
After watching the film you must remember Hobbes , and Orwell`s nightmares (Animal`s farm), because the message in this sense goes beyond the anechdotical story. Don`t think it just a simple horror film .
Gaston Bothoul, in his fundamental work ""The war phenomen"" (from the early seventies), tells us among other interesting items the long interval of peace in the world has been only two hundred years, so when you listen again about someone who dares call Aquiles like the cities`destructor, you should set this observation under a several analysis.
I don`t think you stay indifferent after watching it. It`s a devastating movie. And not for all tastes. But if you really face the hidden facets of the human being, his transformation under special circunstances, don`t miss it. And either think about the film like a peace`s aphology.
And above all what it shows the film at its end it`s the powerful message that nobody`s innocent, in the wider sense of the word.",1082419200,6,2428,4.96068796068796
1882363,3,B00009AVA8,"""Das Experiment"" is an often grueling excursion into the dark recesses of the human psyche. Modeled on a controversial project that took place at Stanford University in 1971 (EVERY review mentions this little factoid, don't they?), the movie attempts to take a serious look at the human need for power over other people. Since the film is German, comparisons to fascism and National Socialist Germany are impossible to ignore. Do we really need another film reminding us of the dangers of fascism? Apparently so, even though the constant harping on this theme quickly becomes tiresome to the nth degree. Personally, I would like to see more films dealing with the dangers of communism and rampant leftism, but I am probably in the minority with this opinion. Anyway, ""Das Experiment"" the movie works well enough despite the usual clichs associated with the old ""humans run wild"" motif. As I watched the film I could never shake the impression that I had seen this same film in another form somewhere else. That sensation came about because I have seen these same themes in numerous other film and television projects.
Meet Tarek Fahd. This young chap ostensibly works as a taxi driver, but he is actually a journalist attempting to come up with a gangbuster story that will put him on the map at the local paper. In an effort to make his career, Fahd signs on as a guinea pig for a famous psychologist's latest experiment. After a wearisome round of rigorous physical and mental tests, the journalist and several other people make the grade and learn what the experiment is about. According to the good doctor and his staff, Fahd and his fellow volunteers will stay in a mock prison for two weeks. Eight of the men will assume the role of guards, and the other twelve will serve as the prisoners. Strict discipline, rigid rules, and actual lockdowns will govern the lives of the prisoners in this experiment. The guards have the power to punish anyone who misbehaves (with moderation, of course) and must learn to distance themselves from their charges both physically and mentally. At first, keeping the two groups segregated is a bit of a problem, but as the days pass it becomes easier and easier to see the ""convicts"" as contemptible and thus deserving of their degraded position.
As the guards and prisoners begin to drift into their respective roles, big problems develop. One of the screws, a smelly, timid fellow named Berus, lets the power associated with his status as a guard go to his head. It's easy to see how such a process comes about, after all, since the guy is essentially a nobody in the outside world. In the prison, he's a big shot wearing a uniform, a badge, and possesses the ability to punish others. Berus's main rival among the prisoners is Fahd, who constantly berates the man and picks fights over a host of minor issues. Insults, defiance, and outright violence result from these confrontations, and the other guards and inmates are soon sucked into the fray. Even the staff monitoring the situation soon discovers the folly of this ill-conceived experiment as Berus and the guards go way beyond the parameters assigned to them at the beginning of the project. Deaths result as the experiment progresses, naturally, as does a big showdown between Berus and Fahd at the end where the film pounds the necessary messages into the heads of the viewers. A subplot involving Dora, a woman Fahd met immediately before enrolling in the experiment, inserts itself at crucial moments in the movie.
I am slightly critical of the film's message, but I did like it as a whole. I think it was the performances that won me over in the end. Although the dialogue is in German, the emotional turmoil all of the characters undergo comes through crystal clear. I even had some surprising sympathy for the Berus character. I was ambivalent about Fahd. He is the hero of the story, the caring journalist who exposes the abuses of the psychological study to the larger world, but he is also the one who bears a major responsibility for the ensuing chaos. In order to get the big story, Tarek must work hard at upsetting his fellow inmates and the guards so he can spice up his article. He constantly pushes everyone's buttons, so much so that his bunkmate eventually reveals a secret in an effort to get the reporter to knock it off. By the time Tarek Fahd ends up in the black box, I felt completely indifferent to his character while feeling an immense amount of empathy for the suffering of his fellow prisoners. His performance, however, achieves just the right balance of cellblock malcontent and horrified observer.
Watch ""Das Experiment"" if you like compelling psychological thrillers, but don't expect to see things you haven't seen elsewhere. The movie is shocking at times, and during the last thirty minutes it is downright riveting. The DVD edition of the film boasts a few trailers for other movies and a widescreen picture transfer. After viewing the film, I asked myself whether I would buy a copy of the movie. The answer was a resounding no; one time through was enough for me. I suggest renting first since the film's bleak atmosphere and graphic violence could turn off many viewers. ""Das Experiment"" isn't the sort of happy go lucky film you would want to watch repeatedly. If you do want to indulge in repeat viewings, you probably have a psychological problem of your own to deal with.",1077753600,5,5415,4.792513368983958
1882364,5,B00009AVA8,"Based on the 1971 Stanford Prison Experiment, this remarkable German film manages to deftly combine thriller, sci-fi, social commentary & character study into one. The premise is simple: a group of men volunteer to take part in an experiment where they are placed in an  prison & divided into groups of ""guards"" & ""prisoners"" for two weeks to study aggressive behaviour within the prison environment.
None of them have been in prison before. Occupations range from teacher to taxi driver & even a professional Elvis impersonator!
The only catch is that by taking part in the program & becoming prisoners, the men are automatically stripped of all their civil rights for that time period, & have their names replaced with numbers. Unfortunately the ""guards"" start taking their responsibilities too far & cross the line into violence & repression.
What the men AREN'T told is that only one of them will stand a chance of getting out alive with the money: everyone else must die, so soon both groups are fighting within their own ranks too. It's at this point that some of the men decide it's time to start fighting back, as it appears that if they remain passive they won't survive the fortnight behind bars.
Among the prisoners is an undercover reporter looking for a story, and if he survives this could land him a front page exclusive.... but his fellow prisoners aren't too keen on him cashing in on their misery when they find out so this places him at an even greater risk.
Absorbing & quite disturbing at times, THE EXPERIMENT rates as one of the best movies I've seen in 2003. The movie is subtitled, I'm not sure if it's also available in an English language version. Brilliantly Directed, filmed & written this is a movie that will stay with you long after the end credits have rolled. A must-see.

1882365,4,B00009AVA8,"Oliver Hirschbiegel's film 'Das Experiment' is loosely inspired by the famous (infamous?) Stanford Experiment of 30 years ago.  In that experiment, students at the university were housed for a few weeks in a make-shift prison, to see what happens to the mentality of the inmates and guards as they adjust to their new roles.  The experiment itself had many flaws, and is hardly representative of prison life in general (or boot camps, or other such environments), but did serve to highlight some of the problems that are possible, and argues for some of the safeguards that are necessary.
Hirschbiegel's film departs from that experiment in key ways, but perhaps the primary way is by having an undercover journalist Tarek/Prisoner 77 (played by Moritz Bleibtreu) purposely trying to instigate problems to enable his story to have more substance.  The primary protagonist to Tarek is the guard Berus (played by Justus von Dohnanyi), whose oppressive nature takes over.
The last half of this film is very violent, far more so than the Stanford Experiment ever became.  The cinematography is a bit lacking - perhaps the German art-house intention was to make this a mock-documentary, at least at first, to draw the audience in before letting the situation get out of control, and by then it is too late (for the audience and for the characters).  One does have to have a willing suspension of disbelief here, as the allowance for violence becomes almost a parody (after all, this is supposed to be a in Germany sensitive to post-Holocaust issues such as letting guards have free and absolute reign over the subjects) - but perhaps that was part of the intention of Hirschbiegel, to let it serve as a reminder about how easily humanity can slip back into such roles.
The film suffers from lack of character development, as the plot and substance of the film is event-driven rather than personality driven; the undercurrents are lacking, and occasional subplots are introduced that do not really help the film along.  Some judicious editing and perhaps a few character development scenes, at least of the major characters, would be helpful in getting the audience to understanding the underlying motivations.  Again, perhaps the intention of Hirschbiegel was to argue that this could happen to any group of men, regardless of background or personality, but that is a bit lost here.
Overall, I tentatively recommend this film, but give strong warning for both the psychological and physical violence portrayed as sometimes being beyond the necessary.",1069804800,5,2545,5.074162679425838
1882366,4,B00009AVA8,"This film is based on the Stanford Prison Experiment conducted in 1971 and the first part is somewhat faithful to how the experiment went. Of course this gives it the German Avant-garde treatment which makes it more interesting. The acting was good, especially Moritz Bleibtreu from Run Lola Run, and the others did a good job. Of course conducting this with Germans where study participants who play the ""role"" of guards quickly transform into fascists has an extra meaning. I thought Maren Eggert was good as Dora, Tarek's girlfriend. And contrary to some reviews the Dora element really added a lot to this film. I felt solidarity with the ""prisoners"" as they are humiliated and abused more and more as the film goes on. And what happens to the psychologists running the Experiment could be considered poetic justice. The ending was over-the-top, but it worked as a film. And just think of what actual prisoners have to endure every day.
I think the wider point is the human rights issue. Here in the US we have millions of people imprisoned, dehumanized, with no real rehabilitation, and we're all the worse off for it. One thing this (as well as the actual experiment) shows is we shouldn't let Psychologists control things either...because that industry is one of dehumanization in itself (drugs, coercion, institutions, etc.) What we need is a world run by human rights activists.",1066608000,4,1387,4.931623931623932

As for the criticisms of the subplot and seemingly meaningless flashbacks to the girl etc etc - i think this accurately depicts the kind of 'daydreaming' you would do when you're locked up 24/7. My only criticism is the silly American release cover of the dvd! Why is mr Fahd wearing a shirt saying 82 when his number is 77? And the wires on his head business happened before the experiment began - This cover insults the depth of the movie and gives it a shiny, bright hollywood-esque cover that bears little relation to the feel of the film at all.

1882368,2,B00009AVA8,"I'll never forget sitting in Psychology class watching this odd guy on a video. He looked kind of like that man who started the Church of satan, Anton Le Vay. His name was Phillip Zimbardo. I remember he had a series of videos, the title of them escapes me. But I do remember his most compelling video was about a famous experiment gone horribly wrong.
In late summer of 1971, Zimbardo and a team at Stanford University constructed, in a basement on the Stanford campus, a makeshift prison. He then paid a bunch of subjects to live in it. The men who took part were separated into two groups, prisoners and inmates. The experiment was to last two weeks, to bad it only lasted 6 days. Soon essentially normal men, given the role of prison guards were savagely beating the inmates. Power had gone to their heads. Just like Zimbardo's ill-fated experiment, director Oliver Hirschbiegel DAS EXPERIMENT doesn't fare much better.
Set in the present, EXPERIMENT follows Tarek Fahd (Moritz Bliebtreu, Run Lola Run), a cocksure cab driver/journalist as he infiltrates a prison experiment. It all seems like a game at first. That is until the guards start beating up on the inmates, and the scientists running the experiments begin to lose control. Let the carnage begin.
I wanted so much to love this movie. The premise is there and the characters are there. A great movie is striving to break free. But alas it all fails. Weaknesses begin to show up at the beginning and the film never quite recovers. I think I know what the biggest problem is. The film bites off far more than it needs to.
This movie should have been a character study. But instead, it puts itself at a distance that is way too far away from its subjects. It meanders where it should move on. It introduces ideas when it should be building characters, and it creates subplots where none are needed.
The biggest problem with the film is a subplot introduced mere minutes after the movie opens. It occurs when Fahd's cab gets into an accident with another car. The other car's driver is Dora (Maren Eggert), a beautiful women, who falls for Fahd instantly. Then she starts showing up all over the film, taking us away from the prison. She serves no purpose. In a stronger draft of the films screenplay they would have chopped her out with extreme prejudice. But we have to suffer through endless scenes of her standing by herself, and dreaming of Fahd, and for what? I'm not sure, but if anyone figures it out, let me know.
Past the inane girlfriend, what I really wanted was focus. I wanted more from the scientists, I wanted more from the inmates, and I wanted more from the guards. Instead we get silly black and white sequences, we get government conspiracies, and we get very little about the nature of man.
On top of that the film needed to be edited tighter. The opening credit sequence feels like an eternity, and yet nothing happens. The experiment screening process meanders to the point of silliness, and the final 20 minutes just drag. With the film as it is, 90 minutes would have sufficed but at just under two hours, it becomes unbearable.
It just makes me sad that I didn't like the movie. It makes me sad, because it's a compelling premise. Why do men get violent? Does prison culture turn otherwise non-violent men into monsters? How does peer-pressure effects us? All questions are worth answering. But we get no such answers.

1882369,5,B00009AVA8,"this movie was amazing.  it shows the true human nature of people when power is given to them or taken away.  it also shows what power or the lack of transforms each individual person into and if they are capable of controling it.  the movie was so real, you felt like you were watching an actual event, not a movie.  the characters are very well developed, and you either connect with them or hate them.  it keeps you guessing to the very end and you never know what will happen.  if you are interested in phsycology or even an edge-of-your-seat thriller, this movie is perfect.",1061164800,3,579,4.466666666666667

That Movie is so real in it's authentic form of paranoia, humiliation, torchure, you start to become out-of-control yourself. The good acting well compensates for the pace and plot of the movie. I felt like I was in the cell with him. That was a good movie. In the next sequel we'll probably see the same prisoners as the new prison guards, and the guards as the real prisoners. LOL Recommendation to anyone interested in seeing this movie. The German language subtitled in english just makes you more involved with the movie.",1059177600,,669,4.630252100840337
1882371,4,B00009AVA8,"Rented this at the suggestion of a friend of mine (who's European and had pretty similar views on the film), and I wasn't disappointed. I also wasn't blown away.  Would have given it 3.5 stars if the rating system had let me, so I rounded up.  The plot has already been summarized enough, so I'll skip that and get to what I think didn't work in the movie and what did.  Suffice it to say, similar territory has been explored in other movies, the two obvious ones coming to mind being ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""The Wave,"" a made for TV movie from the early 80's.  Both took an interesting look at people's tendencies to define (or even change) themselves in relation to the rules and expectations laid out (or removed) for them.
Character development in this movie seemed uneven.  We learn quite a bit about the main character (Bleibtreu), and some as well about his fellow prisoners.  Concerning the guards we learn very little, except their occupations and that some of them are fathers.  What might have been factors contributing to their behavior and the escalation that occurs?  This examination of how human character can go astray would have played out better if we understood something more about how the human character developed in a few more of the key roles.  It didn't seem realistic that the man who adapted to his ""guard role"" the most enthusiastically (and violently) was so meek and mild when his character is first introduced.  We might be able to buy off on the transformation had we a little more background on the guy (ex. he was abused as a kid, victim of a bully, dominant wife at home, etc).  And why would the head doctor, who so totally believes in this experiment, just take off for some business meeting.  He comes across like this experiment is the most important thing in his career/life, he has only 14 days to thoroughly study this case, and he decides to take off for business?  Puh-leeez. And what about Bleibtreu's girlfriend?  Say what?  Plot device is the only thing that comes to mind.  In a nutshell, the escalation of emotion and tension seemed artificial and to happen too quickly.  I've been through military training that puts people in similar roles (though not to this extreme), and I just had a hard time believing that everything could decay that rapidly with a bunch of average Joes (or ""Kerle"" as the Germans would say).
BUT, I still enjoyed the movie.  What could have been a REALLY good movie was just decent given the holes in the character development and a more ""hollywood-ish"" ending.  Pretty strong performances from a lot of people whose acting credits mostly consist of German television shows (Bleibtreu being the main exception).  I also expect this topic might resonate a little more in Germany, a nation that seems to sometimes struggle with the issues of personal role definition and citizen responsibility.  Can a good person who follows the rules still be good even when the rules are bad??
Addendum to my review:  since I wrote the above review, I've done some reseach on the '71 Stanford Prison Experiment (which the movie was based on), and I have to admit, the movie did give a more accurate interpretation of reality than I would have thought.  Minus the heavy violence and the deaths that occurred in the movie, a lot of the plot did closely follow what happened in the actual experiment.  Based on the newer info, I'd recommend the flick even more so.",1057968000,,3422,4.693467336683417
1882372,4,B00009AVA8,"An advertisement invites men to volunteer to take part in an experiment.  They say no one will get hurt and their cameras are on twenty-four hours a day.  out of a group of men, some will be prison guards, the others prisoners.  Those as the prison guards must not play guards, but be real guards.  They do and they get too caught up in the prison play.  The ""prisoners"" must fight back.  The experiment becomes real.  This film contains male nudity and some female nudity.",1057622400,,473,4.4941176470588236
1882373,5,B00009AVA8,"This movie is a deep look into the human condition: what is to be done when man has power over others? Is it possible to keep things in peace. A scientist and his staff bring together a group of men to stay behind bars during two weeks, while another group is meant to look after them. The prissoners must obey and the guards must keep things in order without physical violence. Money is seen at the end of the path. Things start quite peacefully, but as the prisoners don't take things too seriously and the guards do, violence finds a way out. Humilliation and degradation begins to be inflicted on the prisoners on the part of one of the guards, who seems to have kind of a B.O. problem. The movie increases gradually the violence and tension and ends in a terrifying chaos, which is unraveled as the guards take control of the experiment and turn the scientists into prisoners. This is a great german movie, which is worth having.",1054339200,6,934,4.5
1882374,5,B00009AVA8,"The film is based on an actual psychological based prison experiment that took place in Stanford laboratories back in 1971. The aim of the experiment, in my view, is to test the limits of a man's self-control and aggression. And, indeed, the resultscome out to be quite interesting, as the participants become the experimenters at some point of the movie.
Moritz Bleibtreu, plays 'Fahd', a taxi-driver, who is an underground journalist, with the mission of catching the excitement during the experiment. We also know Moritz from 'Run Lola Run', which is yet another good german movie. Moritz, seeing the ad on the newspaper, which tells that a big amount of money is to be given to participants in a pyschology experiment, decides that this is 'the' chance. 19 other people, rather ordinary citizens, but with different individual problems, decide to take a part, too. They all seem to take the experiment and the directions easy; however, as days go by, each goes through different problems, which is the exact case the experimenters have intended to create. We see the professor's increasing delight, as the interactions between the prisoners and guardians get more intense and aggressive. As we proceed to day three, money gets vanished from the minds of many. Instead, it is survival, that is at stake this time. In fact, it will be the professor's surprise to see what has happened, when he comes back from his business trip...
Oliver Hirschbiegel has directed the movie excellently, in a perfect sequence of events, that raises tension, excitement, and curiosity in the audience. The cast has been chosen with particular care, the roles are greatly performed by many of the actors and actresses. I think that 'Das Experiment' is one of the top-notch German movies ever made so far. Seeing this movie is not only highly recommended, but even essential.",1053129600,20,1857,5.0129449838187705

Das Experience is totally a strange & disturbing movie. This is the type of movie you might stumble across randomly and think, what I am watching? Or, if you are interesting in the psychology of power & control, you might go on a mission to find this.

Das Experiment is a good film, it just not a feel good movie. Its more of an experience that you subject yourself to, similar the way the
characters do in the story. The script is based on an a legendary experiment that took place in 1971. The original was stopped before it got out of hand, this film imagines what would have happened if it had not been stopped in time.

A group of men volunteer to participate in a mock prisoner/guard scenario. Some of the men are selected to be prisoners and others are selected to be guards. The guards are instructed to keep everything in order and to control the prisoners. The result is psychological warfare.
The guards begin to feel the mental pull of the situation and take their rolls too seriously.

Das Experiment is a brave movie and the actors are also courageous.
The original experiment was most likely ahead of its time and has surfaced in different cultural avenues over time.  It's a topic of conversation.
This film is strange sometimes it seems like it might be horror, science fiction, an actual documentary. Realistically, The concepts explored are real and rarely analyzed in this way.",1502496000,,1421,4.645418326693227

7990362,4,B00009AVA8,"Saw this movie tonight on cable and thought it was awesome. I read the book a fews years back, written by the psychologist who did the study. The movie did a great job of the tension that was built up. Exagerrated in the movie but interesting to watch in it's own right. I was waiting for the prisoners to take the roles of the guards like it did in the original experiment but that didn't happen. For some reason it made me feel uncomfortable to watch but I thought the acting was great and the story was tight. I feel like they could have done without the flashbacks of the girl and prisoner 77 but then they would have to omit the sex/nudity. A movie worth watching, however. Another great movie by the same director is DOWNFALL. The best acting of Hitler I've ever seen!",1432684800,,774,4.344827586206897
