8509357,1,B0073N1GT6,"Seriously! After seeing Autumn in my Heart, and especially, Winter Sonata - Spring Waltz was okay - I was looking forward to watching this drama. What a disappointment. The lead characters were weak. The female character was spineless and forever in tears and the male character was a wimp. The overall acting was poor.  But the biggest disappointment of all was the ending. What ending? The viewer is left with no resolution, really. This drama only ticked me off.",1405036800,,465,4.886075949367089
8509358,4,B0073N1GT6,The actors portrayed their role very well in delivering the characters they  played.  I didn't like that Hye-won was so excepting to whatever others forced her to do against her will.  All in all I may recommend this drama to others to watch. I didn't really like the ending but....,1394755200,,282,4.6
8509359,3,B0073N1GT6,"This is a great drama, beautiful scenery, great acting.  However, the English subtitles are not done well.  A lot of grammatical errors and even more typos, to the point that it makes the drama less enjoyable.",1349395200,,209,4.777777777777778
8509360,5,B0073N1GT6,"This is one of the Four Seasons Series by Director, Yun Suk-ho, all beautifully-filmed, heartfelt,  romantic stories. The box set containing all four is currently not available, so each season must be purchased individually; however, use caution when selecting a version (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysian, etc.) which may have inferior subtitles.  Trying to decipher mis-spelled words, letters transposed, spaces not between words but, rather, in the middle of words, and grammatical errors, can be distracting  and may lessen the enjoyment of the DVD.

Song Seung-heon and Son Ye-jin make a delightful couple but not immune to obstacles, as is the case in many Korean dramas.  My guess is that you will be routing for them and hoping for the happy outcome as you enjoy looking at the beautiful sights of a summer season.",1347148800,,817,5.112781954887218
