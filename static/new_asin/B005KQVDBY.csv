4718903,5,B005KQVDBY,"I've loved this series from episode 1 and it just keeps getting better. The characters are wonderful and give some interesting insight into the Italian/Sicilian psyche and the plot lines have enough twists and turns to keep it really intersting. I've generally not found the subtitles too fast, but every once in a while its nice to be able to replay a phrase or two. The translations are well done and even when they don't match exactly what was said, they certainly capture the essense of the dialogue. The actors are spot on perfect, the scenery and views of areas of Sicily you'll never see as a tourist are fascinating and have a spare beauty. While there are usually some comic elements sprinkled thoroughout the film, its all done with great love and respect for the 'regulars', as well as the many characters that are unique to each episode. I would love to dine at some of the restaurants Montalbano so dearly loves!  I've enjoyed the books, but the series really brings the stories alive.",1323475200,15,998,4.702857142857143
4718904,5,B005KQVDBY,"THE TREASURE HUNT

""A hyper-religious elderly couple barricade themselves in their home and begin shooting from their balcony for no apparent reason.  When a camera crew videotapes Montalbano and his men entering the home, they become overnight heroes.  The publicity, however, brings out the kooks and a disturbed maniac begins a macabre treasure hunt with Montalbano, sending him strange riddles linked to the kidnapping and murder of a young girl.  Montalbano and his team try to sort out the insanity before a new murder is committed.""

WARNING TO PARENTS:  Be prepared: if you have innocent children, they may ask you what the big life-size doll found in the crazy old man's house is for (my own child is fully grown up, so I did not have to explain).

THE AGE OF DOUBT

""Nothing is as it seems in Detective Montalbano's investigation of a corpse found at sea.  After a young girl arrives from Palermo claiming to meet her aunt, who is pulling into Vigata harbor in a yacht, he discovers a connection between the corpse, the yacht, and a motorboat called ""Ace of Hearts.""  He finds himself attracted to a young Coast Guard officer assigned to help in the case, but there is no time for soul searching when a second corpse shows up and there is a gruesome mystery to solve.""

The ""young girl"" who arrives from Palermo is actually a young woman, and she drives her own car.

I found both episodes very entertaining.  You also get good views of Sicily and Sicilian towns.",1321315200,10,1473,4.70703125

4718931,5,B005KQVDBY,Why waste your time watching stuff that is mediocre? Detective Montalbano is always entertaining and provides such a great insight into the Italian culture. Plus we have visited that part of Sicily and recognize the scenes!!!!,1390089600,,226,5.305555555555555
4718932,5,B005KQVDBY,Detective Montalbano is the greatest--I cannot say enough about how much I am enjoying the series.  I have watched 22 so far and quite unhappy when I think about the fact that there are only a few left.  I hope they are planning some more.,1382918400,,239,4.288888888888889

I have not watched the second disc because of this. Maybe after a cooling off period, I will watch the second DVD.
I have read the Donna Leon books about inspector Brunetti and like the DVDS as well as the books.",1378684800,,348,4.2727272727272725
4718935,3,B005KQVDBY,I am a huge fan of the earlier Montalbano series.  The last few episodes do not hold up as well.  Subtleties have given way to a coarse and more slapstick and slipshod product.,1376524800,,176,4.303030303030303
4718946,3,B005KQVDBY,"Having watched all 22 episodes in the series, I found these 2 slightly disappointing.  The acting is fine, but the plot lines in these 2 were more improbable than expected.",1374278400,,172,4.733333333333333

4718950,5,B005KQVDBY,"These are so enjoyable, like being in Italy.  Only as a resident, not a tourist.
Salvo is very thoughtful and decent as a policeman.  His private life is a recurring theme,
it is complicated but also full of affection and kindness.  The police colleagues are hilarious
and appealing.  We also liked the series The Young Montalbano.  Better film aesthetics
and a lovely young man as Salvo.",1360713600,,388,4.818181818181818
4718951,4,B005KQVDBY,"Recommend these episodes for all mystery fans. But start with earlier episodes, then get up to speed.

4718952,5,B005KQVDBY,"While collection Three (2 Disc) is yet to be released, please forgive my presumption of creating a review for a product yet to be released! That said I have, like those us who watch BBC 4 from the United Kingdom, and seen some of the episodes to be included in this latest offering I felt it was time for a review.

Our Inspector Salvo Montalbano, who works in the fictional town of ""Vigta"", in the equally fictional district of ""Montelusa"" in Sicily. Where the Sun is bright and life treads at a different pace, amongst classic bleached white villages and towns that would look out of place in a tourist guide book. In this almost Mediterranean idle there is darkness, decay and at times murder.

He and the members of Vigata's small police force, namely Mim Augello, Montalbano's second-in-charge, Fazio, Gallo, Galluzzo and the incredibly stupid yet very likeable Catarella, who mans the station's phones, among other minor tasks. While his whole team have suffered from his out bursts, and sometime strange management style he cares for them and in turn they are all very loyal to him, none more so than his `eternal' girlfriend of 8 plus years. Salvo is a foodie, with a passion, and he rarely permits anything to get between him and good meal, including other social commitments. He is also an avid swimmer; so much so, his apartment is set on the beach front, in his more melancholy moments he seems to find solace in swimming. While his girlfriend, Livia, has to compete with his detective work, however, in this latest instalment we seem to see less of her, mostly hearing her on the telephone, for Salvo suspects her of infidelity. This then leaves our Inspector with a strained relationship at best with Livia, and in this series he is more than distracted by the opposite sex.

Luca Zingaretti who plays the major role really brings the detective to life; his characterisation for me is spot on. His take on the character of Inspector Montalbano is very engaging you get a feel for the characters - honest, decency and his loyalty. In Salvo we see how he has his own way of doing things, this then can be at odds with his superiors, who regard him as something of loose cannon His case work always varied, and never what you would expect to happen happens - there are red herrings and misdirection!
In Salvo's work nothing is black and white; mainly his cases are in the grey zone. As one reviewer put it his cases do not have happy endings, while his investigations sometimes leads to organized crime, his stories rarely get totally focused on the Mafia rather they are part of the landscape and environment of where he works in and around.

Returning to Mimi Augello, who is the Deputy Commissioner of Police in Vigata, for a moment, a serial womaniser, he is married to one Beba, a young university student. Through the collusion of Montalbano they are married, their baby son will be imposed the same name Salvo Montalbano in honour of the patron. Mimi is good friend of our Inspector their interaction here, in these episodes, can at times be very funny and on occasion strained. Salvo cares deeply for his friend and will go to great lengths to save his friend from himself, male bonding Salvo style? Salvo is loyal and protective of his team in general, and without giving spoilers, this latest set of offerings will give more in-sight as his team are either challenged or threatened.

The last few years have seen a plethora of foreign detective series from around Europe each series of any real credit brings fresh cultural nuances, behaviour and identity of their own. After years of British and American detective series these shows, are like a new revelation. While some may hate subtitles I can assure you that to see and hear these shows as they were originally broadcast is always best and I find them all the more enjoyable. Very highly recommended!",1355443200,4,3877,4.712389380530974
4718953,1,B005KQVDBY,I live in Austrlaia and I was sent a DVD that is not for my region.  Therefore I cannot play it and would like to swap it for one that I can play.  I am annoyed that none in Amazon has returned my request. Thank you,1349395200,,215,3.652173913043478
4718954,5,B005KQVDBY,"Montalbano is my favorite ""Commissario"".  His series never disappoints, and you will love his office colleagues as they present their chief with personal problems which somehow get intertwined in the criminal investigation.  Little violence, no foul language, and a lot of interesting Sicilians who will amuse and add to the story.",1328918400,,331,5.470588235294118
4718955,5,B005KQVDBY,"I own all 22 episodes in the series and will keep buying anymore they can produce. Here's why: they are great storylines from Andrea Camilleri, great directing, great acting, and great settings; in short, the complete package for quality entertainment, which, by the way, seems rare these days. We've been inundated with too many other sereis in the genre that rely too much on car chases, shootouts, Ninja-like and impractical fight scenes rather than plot.
  If you're here on episodes 21 & 22 chances are good that you're already familiar with Montalbano so there's no need to convince you that these two are also worth watching. However, if you've chanced upon this DVD then I can only say, come on in the water's fine and envy the fact that you have the preceeding books and DVDs to enjoy.",1327622400,2,794,4.746376811594203

The first 12 I purchased from a ACORN, however, ACORN didn't have the remaining dvds so I decided to check out AMAZON and was very happy to find that AMAZON had all thirty dvds.  With the subtitles, I can easily watch the episodes and read at the same time.  It gets easier to watch once you get involved with the characters.  I only wish there was more episodes.",1505952000,,408,4.328947368421052
