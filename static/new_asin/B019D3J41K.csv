7570346,2,B019D3J41K,"I've been in the Zappa camp since '75 and am always happy to see/hear more interviews by the late-great Uncle Frank.
This compilation, however, is nothing special. You can view many more at least as - and much more - interesting interviews YouTube.
The title of this DVD is misleading because it's title is very similar to a film, soon to be released in theaters (limited run, no doubt), titled Eat That Question: Frank Zappa In His Own Words. THAT film promises to be very well produced and will include some live footage as well. Shame on me for not researching this DVD more thoroughly. It wasn't expensive, but not something I'll view again.
If you're a Zappa devotee who needs to have anything and everything available with FZ's name attached, by all means, ""have at it"" - as the British say. Otherwise, no big shakes here. Arf Arf",1460851200,16,836,4.617449664429531
7570347,5,B019D3J41K,LIstening to Zappa talk/converse/opine etc is almost as much fun as listening to his music. This DVD has hours ( ok 90 mins or so) of the great man in coversation and is highly recommended to any fan. Clips cover different eras across his career so it gives a good illustation too of how his thoughts evolved and how age at times changed his opinions - although these never appeared to soften or come anywhere close tyo 'liberal'.,1459036800,,430,4.5256410256410255
7570348,3,B019D3J41K,"I quite heartily enjoyed this DVD, of 106 minutes of material taken from broadcasts over the years, covering the mind, thought, and off-the-cuff discourse of the great Frank Zappa. His unflappability, calm good spirits (after all, he was getting paid for these gigs and maybe that was sufficient for this very practical-minded man), and ability to make the most of questions, however banal, provide a pleasant evening with the boob-tube used for video playback rather than for current televised drivel and (so far as mainstream tele-journalism is concerned) assorted socio-political and economic deceptions. The DVD edition viewed is I.V. Media IVF-068.

This is by no means a ""documentary"", per se; it is, instead, a loosely assembled compilation. It would have helped to present the video material chronologically, displaying, as a bare minimum, the year of each portion (which even this minimal information the DVD omits!) rather than in so hodgepodge a fashion, leaping, as it does, back-and-forth over the years of Zappa's career in which this footage came to exist. Concerning details of the documentation on view, there is none of that kind of thing on offer, not even so much, as already mentioned, the date of the material for viewing, as ""Frank Zappa in His Own Words"" drifts along from one interview to another. One has to pick out such clues as happenings to which the speakers refer, fashion trends obviously on display, and so forth as the video progresses, plus, of course, whatever alike American and international TV lore that one might be familiar with (e.g., who hosted which programmes when). At least the informed Zappa fan, obviously, would have some rough idea of at what age Zappa appears to be at any particular time. Since Zappa retained youthful looks longer than most men are lucky enough thus to age, so even that last-mentioned bit of guesswork is not always easily accomplished, apart from clues from the length, volume and grooming of hair and moustache that Zappa cultivated at various phases of his life.  The container flap merely describes the contents as being a ""DVD [that] collects together over 90 minutes of video interviews and talking engagements with or undertaken by Zappa his career.""

Therefore, those who enjoy Frank Zappa's music, or at least some of what there is among its amazing variety, just sit back and enjoy the informative chats about it.  The audio was decent enough to facilitate doing just that even in my seventies, when my hearing is deteriorating, I am able to make out almost everything that is spoken; more than that really is not required for a video that is all words about Zappa's music and none of it there to hear.",1458691200,2,2685,4.973273942093541
7570349,3,B019D3J41K,"Six or seven interviews from about 1970 through about 1990.  There is no information at all but the sources obviously come from European, American, and Australian broadcasts from talk shows.  Some of it is black and white and some is in color and the audio and video quality is good.  Not the most scintillating interviews FZ ever did and certainly not essential but like the other reviewer I have never seen these before.  Most Zappa fans want to check out everything they can get there hands on unless it's total crap and imo this is worth adding to the collection.",1458518400,,567,4.64
7570350,1,B019D3J41K,"Don't waste your money!! Could be a collection of some of his lamest interviews Frank ever did (because of the interviewers, not Frank). Frank even looks bored on some of them. With the huge amount of brilliant interviews and debates out there 90 minutes of ""how did you come up with name mothers of invention"" and questions about drugs and groupies I couldn't even make it to the end. I think almost all the interviews are foreign. Worse was a panel of ""college students"" (?) Interviewing Frank and obviously knew nothing about him. Sometimes, Frank would look at them and ask them ""what do you mean"" and they couldn't explain themselves. Many interviews I had never seen before. Don't waste your time on this, just go to youtube and pull up his crossfire debates, abc news debates, his testimony before congress, school beat debate there are hundreds out there. I pre-ordered this and should have waited for some reviews. Trust me on this!!!",1458259200,15,943,4.791411042944786

8744730,5,B019D3J41K,"I recently saw a pretty good documentary about Frank Zappa at a local theater. As good as that documentary was, this one is better. This one incorporates several interviews done over the years. These interviews were longer than  those in the theatrical film I saw. There were many great ideas and information brought out in this DVD. Zappa was bombarded with questions about various topics by interviewers as well a panel of English students.
He replied without fail to insure his point  of view was understood. Some of the highlights were Zappa on his drummers, the criteria for getting in his band, and a funny segment I titled ""Winos don't march"". This was Zappa's take on beer drinkers and a macho stance they adopt. Wine drinkers by comparison don't give a F*** about that protocol. Frank stresses the importance of humor and being not to serious about musical relevance.
I would recommend this to major fans of Frank Zappa, or young people trying to learn about who Frank Zappa was. These interviews define his outlook on life.",1475798400,2,1033,4.830508474576271
8744731,1,B019D3J41K,Stay away from this it's a scam. There's a documentary in the movie theatres called Eat That Question: Frank Zappa in His Own Words. That is legit and will be released on DVD.
