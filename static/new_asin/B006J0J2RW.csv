8499118,2,B006J0J2RW,"After receiving his son from a courier during a school lesson, Cheol-su spends the next eight years raising is son, Cho-won, alone, while also working evenings as an MC at a cabaret club. When the mother returns on the scene, she puts Cheol-su and Cho-wun's relationship at risk by trying to pry herself back in.
Story-wise, Don't Tell Papa isn't the best to appear on the rom-com scene, but it holds enough to keep it afloat. With a weak start and end you rely mainly upon the relationships and interactions in the middle of the film to keep you interested. The relationships do seem honest, but sometimes a little over-the-top and in my opinion, one-too-many kiddy-sex jokes. Maybe that's due to UK being overly-protective these days, but it still seemed a little unnecessary.
I did especially like the fact that, due to Cho-won spending so much time in the back-rooms of a cabaret club, he has acquired a potty mouth.
I wouldn't recommend this film as a must watch, but if it's a boring night it's a perfect no-brainer, background film. There's enough laughs in there to keep the heart pumping.",1357603200,,1097,4.7486910994764395
