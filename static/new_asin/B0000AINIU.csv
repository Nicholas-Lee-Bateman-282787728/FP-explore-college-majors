7997235,4,B0000AINIU,"For nice sets of obscure, low-budget movies--particularly horror and/or sex exploitation movies--you can't go wrong with Something Weird Video.  There's hardly a good movie in the bunch, but there are plenty of so-bad-they're-good flicks, as demonstrated in the five movie set, Box of Blood.

First up is The Bloody Pit of Horror; actually, like most of these films, this one has multiple titles, but I will refer to the one on the box.  This one stars Mickey Hargitay, who's main claim to fame at the time was being Jayne Mansfield's husband, and whose claim to fame today is being the father of Law & Order: SVU star Mariska Hargitay.  Mickey owns an isolated castle where he occasionally adopts the personality of the sadistic Crimson Execution, bringing woe to the visiting troupe of models who've come to the castle.

Next up is the very low-budget Carnival of Blood, a tale of a killer stalking the Coney Island Midway, and of course, murdering in creative and gory fashion.  A district attorney launches his own investigation and keeps dragging his girlfriend into dangerous situations.  Is he actually the killer, or could it be a disfigured Burt Young (later of Rocky fame)?  Don't expect much logic, but it is interesting to see the 1970 version of Coney Island.

Unfortunately, there isn't much to enjoy about The Curse of the Headless Horseman, the weakest movie in the set.  When a medical student inherits a Wild West park, he brings his hippie friends out to improve the place (a requirement to fulfill the terms of the will).  A headless horseman is also at the park, terrorizing the various friends.  What little plausibility this movie has goes out the window with the appearance of Ultra Violet (a Warhol associate) who play a baroness who walks around with a Superman lunchbox.  (If you want to see a good movie with her, watch Midnight Cowboy.)

Despite a cast of relatively accomplished actors, Blood Suckers offers little quality either.  Peter Cushing, Patrick Macnee and Edward Woodward are all in this story about an Oxford student who disappears in Greece and becomes the captive of a murderous, vampiric cult.  Besides a tedious story, there is also some bad editing or directing:  some dialogue scenes look like each character spoke all his lines at once and then conversations were spliced together later.

Blood Thirst is okay enough, a black-and-white film that takes place in Manila where a monstrous creature is killing beautiful women and draining them of there blood.  An American homicide detective is asked to assist in the investigation; he is one of those suave pseudo-James Bonds who constantly quips and thinks all women are ready to fall for him.  Despite the general look of a 1950s horror film, this one was actually made in 1971.

On a straight quality level, these movies are all one or two-star fare, but at least three of them (Bloody Pit of Horror, Carnival of Blood and Blood Thirst) have a certain so-bad-it's-good quality.  What really makes this set special are all the special features with lots of old movie trailers and posters that depict the Golden Age of the Exploitation Film as well as some short subjects that make the main features seem well-produced.  So you won't get any Oscar-worthy films here, but the Box of Blood is still a lot of fun to watch.",1227398400,,3315,4.8698752228163995
7997236,3,B0000AINIU,"A collection of 3 Something Weird DVD's with 5 freaky features!
Bloody Pit Of Horror-Mickey Hargitay stars as an owner of a freaky castle that some lovely, young models visit to accomplish a sleazy photo shoot. Oh, did I mention that Mickey's character, Travis Anderson, is also a pyscho/sado-masochist who  believes he is the re-incarnation of a 17th century torturemaster
named ""The Crimson Executioner"". This film is touted to be based
loosely on the writings of the great Marquis De Sade... There is an iron maiden, dungeons, a human roaster, and lots of other torture devices.
Carnival Of Blood-A Coney Island Carnival has a murderer on the loose who just LOVES to kill hilariously ANNOYING women.  Who COULD it BE??? A strange little sicky! One of the best  perfomances is given by a very young, Burt Young as a hunchbacked carnie. (You know, Paulie from the Rocky movies!)
Curse Of The Headless Horseman-Mark Callahan  inherits is dead uncle's Wild West tourist attraction.  Though he and his hippy friends have been warned. They ingore the ""curse"" only to meet with the sharp end of the famous and  ghostly marauder's knife! A cameo appearance by Andy Warhol's 5 seconds of fame persona, Ultra-Violet who carries around Superman lunchbox!!!
Blood Suckers- stars Peter Cushing and a young man named Patrick Mower who has recently been resued from a Satanic and Vampiric cult. But... you know, once you've tasted blood, you never go back!
Blood Thirst - a Filipino movie in regards to murders in Manilla, a monster with elephantitis
All of these movies are total STINKERS and that's what I like about them!  There are MANY, MANY extras on these discs- some film shorts, still galleries, trailers, and radio spot ads!  The extras are great!
Happy Watching!",1085356800,8,1761,4.965986394557823
7997237,4,B0000AINIU,"Something Weird Does it again! If you love those campy ""didn't even know they existed"" B horror films, this is worth the time and investment. I especially loved ""Carnival of Blood"" as the acting was so bad it was brilliant. You'll be glad that the victims die! (Check out the ugly big nosed woman who visits the fortune teller towards the end). Don't expect great quality here,just wonderful tasteless obscurity. Not for the mainstream horror fan. For the cult fan who appreciates something WEIRD!
OH, and great extras too!",1068336000,5,523,4.887640449438202
