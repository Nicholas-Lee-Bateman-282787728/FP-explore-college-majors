5451125,5,B00AMHFPLA,Amazing documentary that makes a good case for the theory that RMS Titanic when it sank was actually the Olympic - the two having been swapped as part of a gigantic insurance fraud. Compelling and intriguing and certainly makes one wonder. Professionally produced and edited this is not the work of some crackpot - if you are intrigued by the whole Titanic story I doubt you will be dissapointed with the arguments presented here.,1365638400,11,430,4.824324324324325
8553728,1,B00AMHFPLA,"This is a film, not a documentary, comprising solely of actors paid to present a conspiracy theory. One thing viewers should know about this film is that the last scene, which claims to show the letters of the name ""Olympic"" on the wreck, is in fact a faked CGI scene. This can be verified by examining footage brought back from the expeditions, for example by Cameron or Ballard, which clearly show the name Titanic on the bow.

The fact that this faked scene is used in this film indicates that the film is either very poorly researched, or needed to resort to lies in order to convince its viewers. Either way, it casts grave doubt on the whole content.",1492128000,,656,4.512605042016807

8553732,5,B00AMHFPLA,"This DVD is highly recommended, especially if you are a Titanic buff like myself. This documentary explores the conspiracy theory that the Olympic is sitting at the bottom of the ocean rather than the ship of Titanic. The story is very convincing and probable! A nice DVD for the collection !",1423353600,,292,4.745098039215686
8553733,5,B00AMHFPLA,This presentation gives a compelling case for a sinister aspect to the 1912 tragedy that is gripping and shocking . It is a professionally done production that makes one rethink the whole Titanic incident. Don't pay attention to the one star review here as that review says nothing about the actual quality and content of the  DVD. If you have any interest at all in the Titanic this is a must see DVD and is guaranteed to spark lively conversation when group viewed. I am glad I added this title to my collection and don't begrudge the meager amount it cost ; free YouTube version not withstanding.,1418428800,,599,4.598130841121495
8553734,4,B00AMHFPLA,Excellent documentary on the infamous topic of the sinking of the great titanic.  This documentary brings such depth and insight to the conspiracy of what actually happened.  It is a must see for all who have ever wondered what really happened.,1392681600,3,244,4.926829268292683
8553735,5,B00AMHFPLA,"I recently traveled to Belfast and went through the Titanic Experience and thought how ironic it was to create a tourist attraction to a tragic event that killed over 1500 people. I saw this video in the gift shop but did not purchase it for I felt it would not play on my system.  On returning home I obtained it from Amazon at about half the price being sold in Belfast.  After watching it twice, reviewing my past passive experiences with the story, I am now obtaining a different perspective of the disaster. This theory presented now seems more plausible than the original story put out by The White Star Line.

Over the last 40 years I have had a passive interest in the Titanic tragedy.  I have been to Halifax to stroll through the cemetery; Cove, Ireland to walk through the museum; Southampton, England to view the dock Titanic moored; viewed many of the documentaries; and even attended a top secret briefing by then CRD Ballard at Groton, Connecticut couple with many facts in this video was presented, but did not become conscience to me until this video and another Nazi Titanic History Channel production.

I am not that attentive until a critical mass occurs.  Why did the Nazis, Goebbels, commission a movie about the Titanic disaster? This obsession to produce this record-breaking budget film was done to reveal the British as a devilish sinister nation, purely motivated by corruption, greed and personal glory.  The multi-million dollar budget movie was never finished due to resources stretched to the limit with war with Russia. In the movie United States is also implicated due to J.P. Morgans connection.

Titanic: The shocking Truth is a fascinating presentation and this well done video is a must see to fully understand the full story. Maybe what Scott Wolter states in the History Channel creation, Unearthing America, What history was taught to us was not correct is plausible here!",1387497600,8,1912,4.87962962962963
8553736,4,B00AMHFPLA,"This makes complete sense when you realize that the Olympic was so badly damaged that she could never pass inspection again and therefore would have to be scrapped.  Otherwise, why did the ""Olympic"" manage to sail for another 25+ years if the swap had not been made?  Her hull would not have stood up to the strain with all the damage she had suffered.  Besides, the Brits, just like our own government, would not be above covering up something like this.  It's just sad that Smith miscalculated the distances so badly between his ship and the Californian.  Nobody could have foreseen the Sampson being where it was and throwing the whole plan out of order, costing over 1500 innocent lives.  I totally believe this is what actually happened.",1385942400,8,742,4.7578125
