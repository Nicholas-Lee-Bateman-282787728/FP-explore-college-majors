6305513,4,B00IYXNNJK,This was really interesting! It's mostly about them punks at the Cuckoo's Nest. And an interview and backstory of Pat Brown! All your OC punker favorites are here. You should totally get this if you're into punk rock and/or So Cal history.,1451347200,3,239,4.714285714285714

6305515,5,B00IYXNNJK,"I could not believe who booked this place, sitting in the industrial zone in Costa Mesa, We saw, XTC, John Foxx era Ultravox, Magazine, The Fab Poodles, The Only Ones, Penetration and a whole slew of other great post punk British bands. But the whole punk LA and OC bands were there too, Early Motels, the Blasters, The Dickies, this place was a dive but it rocked some of the best So Cal Punk as shown in this Documentry... Killer!!",1445126400,2,433,4.425
6305516,3,B00IYXNNJK,"This documentary was alright, but could've had better footage and covered more of a variety of OC punk. For those who were there, you'd be better off getting the ""Battle for the Cukoos Nest"" or the ""Slog"" movie those both capture more of the humor and intensity a lot more than this re-hash of stuff you probably know already.",1440720000,9,326,4.5423728813559325
6305517,5,B00IYXNNJK,Must watch for those who are music documentary fanatic like my husband and I.,1420502400,6,77,4.571428571428571
8646622,4,B00IYXNNJK,Really good box set of different bands in the punk generation,1527724800,,61,4.636363636363637
8646623,1,B00IYXNNJK,Lame. A couple ppl giving their take on the part they played in a huge movement. A bunch of bands got left out. I can't believe the arrogance of someone trying to take credit for the creation of slam dancing. Lmao. The Crowd was a crappy band and he just reaffirmed that for me. Also great to steal youth brigades song and the footage playing their song that was used in the movie another state of mind but never mentioned them once? Nothing new in this and time I'll never get back wasted. Don't bother with this.,1526774400,,514,4.309278350515464
8646624,1,B00IYXNNJK,"Typical crud that passes for music documentaries these days. Boring, almost no music, as unoriginal and uninspired as its title.",1514937600,,128,5.45
8646625,4,B00IYXNNJK,"Fairly entertaining documentary.  Nowhere near enough music, oh well.  This is on youtube as We Were Feared and is missing the footage with Jack Grisham.  The Jack interview bits reminded me of a messed up old home video.  They were clippy, poorly shot, with terrible audio.  And like the older review said, it's rehashed stuff from the Battle for Cuckoo's Nest old doc, which is also on youtube.  But hey, it's cheap and I'm not that fussy.",1496361600,2,441,4.662337662337662
8646626,3,B00IYXNNJK,"I really enjoyed Clockwork Orange County, but as usual with music docs, TOO MANY TALKING HEADS, not enough music, and the few concert clips are often repeated. I'm sure the doc was done on a shoestring (there may be rights issues), but the finished product is more sociology than musicology: the unsparing document of a club that defied its geographical situation, and its quirky hangers-on.",1492992000,6,391,5.030769230769231
