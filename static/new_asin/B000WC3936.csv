8254244,5,B000WC3936,As much as I like reading the manga the animation and the DVD condition was flawless.,1442966400,,85,4.375
8254245,2,B000WC3936,"I love the series - but it was used, not something I expect with Amazon. The collectible cards were missing.",1433548800,,108,4.45
8254246,5,B000WC3936,"Hell Girl was a really well done, really cool anime. It's dark, and tends to show the worst sides of human-kind, while wrestling with the question 'is vengeance worth damning your soul to hell'? The first half of the season is much more episodic, with self-contained stories that are wrapped up within each episode. As the series progresses, however, we begin to unravel the mystery of who Ai Enma really is. This final installment ties it all together in a satisfying manner. I'd definitely recommend this series to any anime fan who like horror/supernatural themed stories.",1394755200,,575,5.0

8254248,5,B000WC3936,"I have been waiting to complete my box set of season 1 forever! I have looked everywhere, no one could get their hands on it for me. I found it here, it was used, but no scratches or anything! It came quickly, much quicker then we thought. :) We have already watched it and put it in its new home! Thank you so much!",1364342400,,316,3.953125
8254249,5,B000WC3936,"This is how a series should be produced. From start to finish, Hell Girl has focused on telling a solid story. With compelling characters to push along a mesmerizing story, the finale delivers a great ending that wraps up the story. No loose ends or plot hooks are left dangling to compel audience members to watch the second season. Instead I'm left wanting to watch second season because I want to watch it, not because I am left feeling like I have to. This is easily going to end up on my top ten list this year.",1221696000,2,516,4.329896907216495
