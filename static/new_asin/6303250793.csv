606749,4,6303250793,I grew up watching the Bowery Boys' movies (on TV in the 60s) and the movie was fun and nostalgic,1363737600,,97,3.9
606750,3,6303250793,"First, I'm glad that someone (Alpha Video) is offering this movie. It's worth having. But, my copy was so choppy and boogery, it was hard to follow what was going on. Lots of the dialog was cut up so badly I had to guess what was being said. So, if you don't mind being frustrated and love the East Side Kids, go ahead and get this. Maybe someday TCM or someone else will dig in and remaster the entire 20 ESK movies. Do you hear me TCM?",1307750400,,437,4.0344827586206895

Muggs (Leo Gorcey) can't seem to keep out of trouble in this film.
The plot is thin, the acting atrocious, the production values almost non-existant.
Best for fans of the Eastside Kids.",1055635200,,273,4.48
606754,1,6303250793,"I completely agree with the other reviewer's opinion this edition stinks! It's ashame the East Side Kids series doesn't get better treatment. I understand these films are pretty much considered bottom of the barrel poverty row entertainment whose appeal to modern day audiences is extremely limited at best, but c'mon if your gonna take the time to release the stuff at all at least make sure it's watchable. The antics of Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall and the boys have a certain charm that deserves to be remembered in a better form than this! If you've never checked out or even heard of the East Side Kids before do yourself a favor and look them up, trashy teen exploitation from a time long ago, corny yet hip (I guess for it's day?!), the 30's and 40's equivalent of today's Road trip and American Pie type teen flix (minus the sex of course!). Let's hope these pics get released in better form some day!",1037664000,13,904,4.58641975308642
606755,1,6303250793,"I can not tell you much about the movie, the Gotham Distributors/ Alpha Video DVD is so bad that I had to stop it 10 minutes in and force the store to accept the return of an open DVD.
The AUDIO is DISTORDED, making it very hard to understand Leo Gorcey's humorous banter.
The VIDEO is WASHED OUT so that you can not see their faces.
The film print they used was also splicy, but that would have been tolerable if you could see & hear the movie. Wait until someone like Platinum, Front Row, Brentwood, or Goodtimes releases this public domain title.",1028160000,15,549,4.339805825242719

this review is for the ""timeless multimedia"" vhs version of this movie.  for those of you who do not know it,
there are scenes in this version THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MISSING from all the other versions on the
market today.  I would have made this review four stars except for the botched up ending that is broken up.
Still, if you are looking for the most COMPLETE VERSION of this movie until a more better copy of it comes
along, go for this vhs version.",1405641600,,481,4.333333333333333

This film is more of a soap opera than the others.",1399334400,,276,4.54
607006,4,6303250793,"This is a typical B picture, but I found it entertaining.  Despite Leo Gorce being the tough character he was always typed to play the moral of the story is good, which is more than I can say for modern pictures.  It would probably be too slow for today's viewers tastes.  The Bowery boys have a conceited boxer in Leo Gorce.  They trick him into going to a CCC work camp thinking he is going to somewhere to train for his boxing.  He gets some hard lessons in humility, but wins the respect of those in charge.  Stolen money is blamed on him, but of course a happy ending.",1386979200,,573,4.2110091743119265

7841777,4,6303250793,"Great view into the depression, the CCC, and depiction of blacks; of America just before being dragged into WWII. Would give it 5-stars as a documentary for Social Studies.  As a Bowery Boys / East Side Kids comedy, it lacks Huntz Hall and all the malapropisms normally expected of Leo Gorcey.  Three stars for missed expectations.  But the warmth between the tough friends and the good honest heart of Gorcey are still shining.  Split the difference: 4 stars.",1488326400,,460,4.858974358974359

The 1937 movie Dead End was sited in the lower East Side of New York City. Teenagers were used to show the environment; their parents were absent. Their antics amused the audiences and led to new movies with this urban group. When they moved to another movie studio the Dead End Kids became the East Side Kids. In time their audiences diminished. Read the individual reviews for more details.

Bowery Blitzkrieg, 1941 film
Muggs is in Reform School but leaves to become a boxer and wins. Will Muggs win or fix a fight? No, he wins. He has a problem but there is a happy ending. [This movie seems more serious than the others.]

Kid Dynamite, 1943 film
Two young men practice boxing. Will an amateur match be fixed? Danny wins his bout. There is a jitterbug contest. [Other comments date this movie.] Some of the Kids join the Army, the Marines, and the Navy. The background events tell of this era.

Million Dollar Kid, 1943 film
There is a robbery of a rich stranger, who is rescued by the Kids. The police question them, but they are released when Courtland identifies them as his rescuers. The Kids practice in a private gym. Other events date this wartime movie. There is a happy ending.

Pride of the Bowery, 1940 film
Muggs wants to train as a boxer. The Kids join the Civilian Conservation Corps, their families get $22 a month. [This provided work relief and placed young men in a structured environment like the military.] Muggs gets a chance to box. There is a theft of money. This drama has a lesson: there are times when a man should talk, its not squealing.

Smart Alecks, 1942 film
There is a bank robbery, Hank is caught. The Kids get into more trouble. A gangster seeks Danny and hurts him. A doctor refuses a fee for his surgery. Hank captures a gangster and is thanked. The Kids will get their baseball uniforms as a reward.

Spooks Run Wild, 1941 film
The boys will travel by bus for a two week vacation in the country. They are told about a maniac on the loose, he has killed three people! They hear howling in the night, so they go outside to explore the countryside. When they hear a shot they seek refuge in a lone house. [Some of these jokes are dated.] The men in town get their guns to search for the monster, and catch him. There is a happy ending.",1477612800,,2298,4.418439716312057
7841780,3,6303250793,"If you watch this movie in today's light, it might seem pretty cheesy. But in its day, the Bowery Boys were a slapstick version of Straight Outta Compton. Just enjoy a bunch of city slickers running around in woods chopping down trees.",1474934400,,235,4.619047619047619
