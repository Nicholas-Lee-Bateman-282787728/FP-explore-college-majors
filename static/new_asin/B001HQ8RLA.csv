8309331,4,B001HQ8RLA,"Andres is infectiously humorous and does not take himself too seriously, which makes his meanderings around his homeland more entertaining. This series is as much about northwest Spain's people, culture, and scenery, as about cooking, although when he returns to DC to cook up something, it is always mouth-watering. The only negative, subtracting a star, is that if you watch the entire series in a short period of time, Andres's enthusiasm becomes repetitive.",1374537600,,461,5.328767123287672

8309335,5,B001HQ8RLA,"The bread, tomato, olive oil, garlic, pimenton, and sherry vinegar soup is called ""salmorejo"" (sal-mo-ray-ho) and is a specialty of Cordoba in Andalucia.  Make it with really good tomato's from a local farmer's market and really good extra virgin olive oil. I use Pasolivo from my home in Paso Robles, Ca. I and my wife prefer it to gazpacho.  Garnish with chopped hard boiled egg, chopped jamon Serrano (procuitto de parma will do in a pinch) and chopped red bell pepper.  We make a light summer meal from it.",1252454400,2,510,4.707865168539326
8309336,5,B001HQ8RLA,"These two DVD's are about the second season of the PBS series MADE IN SPAIN, with Jos Andrs, the transplanted Spanish chef who owns restaurants in the US: the Jaleo, near Washington DC, and the Bazaar in Beverly Hills. His first season was very successful and the videos garnered excellent reviews in Amazon, including my modest contribution which rated the program as five star. The second season in just as good as the first, and deserves the same accolades.

The series starts with Andaluca, covering the growing and processing of olives, a visit with jamn serrano, dozens of tapas (the tiny fried red mullets made my mouth water), the making of a mixed bread soup (well, bread, and tomatoes and garlic and oil and sherry vinegar) called ""salmonejo"" at his kitchen in Washington. The season has 13 episodes, including one devoted to paella valenciana, to Extremadura, to the Baleares, to  the Basque Country and to many other regions; and ending with a visit to the Canary Islands, or to two of them: Tenerife and Lanzarote. In his visit to these islands off Africa he enthuses about a peculiar dish of the islands, ""papas arrugadas,"" small, wrinkled potatoes that he manages to reproduce in his own kitchen; the potatoes are always accompanied by some sort of ""mojo"" or dip. He prepares a red and a green mojo at home, making the process easy and the results surely good. While in Tenerife he is seen consuming one of the finest of all fish, the ""vieja,"" a parrot fish peculiar to the islands that has an indescribably succulent flavor. In all, he keeps up his enthusiasm and good humor, and the series continues to be a pleasure to watch. I do advise not trying to consume the two DVD's in one sitting: an overdose of Mr. Andrs's bubbling enthusiasm for everything and everyone can cause a migraine in those so disposed; but in moderation he is a real joy and a fine chef.",1237680000,5,1877,4.684848484848485
