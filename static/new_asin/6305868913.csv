1097647,5,6305868913,"Wow,I am in awe of this genious movie. I guess it's kinda controversial(they take a cop hostage and lock themselves in the school to prove their points) but that only adds to the brilliance of it. I thought  Usher was just a talentless teen idol but this movie changed my mind about  him. He really is amazing as an actor. It was also a nice suprise to see my  favorite actress Sara Gilbert appear in it. As always,she is superb. This  movie speaks a lot of truth. Its also full of hope. Hope that maybe someday  people will understand that age is just a number. Maybe they'll realize that  racism gets us nowhere. THAT'S what this movie is all about. As one of the  characters said,""All we want is respect!"".Thats what its all  about. Standing up for your beliefs. I highly reccomend this fabulous movie  to anyone. It changed my life.",960940800,8,836,4.483443708609271
1097648,4,6305868913,"Similar to the recent movie Negotiator, Light it Up follows a group of teens who take a police officer hostage with the demands to bring back a teacher that was unfairly fired and improve their education.  This movie  does have good points to it, and it makes you think because it is from the  point of view of the teens, and it also sends a message about how the media  makes most teens look like hoodlums, when all they really want is equal  rights.  The only thing this movie suffers from is cliches.  All the  characters in this movie are too un-original, and the writers purposely  made sure that all the characters were too diverse, just to increase the  drama between them.
Overall, it is a well made dramatic movie, but the  DVD suffers from lack of features.  it is still reccomended.",960940800,,793,4.507042253521127

While not an Oscar winner by any stretch, the movie boasts solid acting by all of the principles involved. Rosario Dawson, Melissa Gilbert, Forest Whitaker, and Judd Nelson I already knew had acting chops, but I was very pleasantly surprised by Usher's acting. Was this his big-screen debut? He was very believable and not wooden at all. The character of Ziggy reminded me so much of Pony Boy Curtis from The Outsiders.

It was a instant hit with me. It speaks the truth, and the die hard facts behind it all. It shows you to respect your fellow man, and not just jump to conclusions. It doesn't matter if your black or not, you will feel for this movie. I ain't black, and I did. Acting is great as well.

And I just wanted to note, whoever it was that gave it 1 star seems to be a minor that just likes writing bad reviews. Do notice that all the other reviews are good.",1138924800,,618,4.024390243902439

1098256,5,6305868913,"This is a must see for anyone who works with or has any dealings with young people.  It will help you remember not to judge a book by the cover.  To help our young people become all they were created to be, we need to start showing them that we believe in them and know they have what it takes to be successful adults. If you see a young person who seems to be hurting, reach out to him or her.  You'd be amazed at what a smile or a hug can do for someone who feels noone cares.",1129075200,,478,3.808080808080808
1098257,5,6305868913,"It was actually EXCELLENT. It has my man Usher in it incl. the whole cast Rosario Dawson, Vanessa Williams, Forest Whitaker, Sara Gilbert, Fredro Starr (he's bad), the whole list goes on and on.

I was laughin' to death when a lot of craziness goin' on inside the movies from the guns poppin, the police chasin', a lotta people gettin' out of the school 'cuz of emergency, lot of mad talkin and fussin' goin on and all that other s**t. Y'know what I mean. Anyway the list goes on and on.

This is similar to those that don't like gangsta rap nor hip-hop/rap, mainstream music, soundtracks, gangsta movies, or whatever it is, it doesn't matter. I believe it's telling us to watch out 'cuz a lotta people are watching us.

For fans that love Menace II Society, Lean on Me, Stand and Deliver, Dangerous Minds, Jason's Lyric, Above the Rim, Boyz in the Hood, The Temptations, the TV show CHEATERS or JERRY SPRINGER (which I watched to this day), New Jack City, Malcolm X, etc. must check it out 'cuz it shoulda won a Academy Award.

1098258,1,6305868913,"the acting was good and it started off kind of interesting, but it turned out to suck. this is the kind of movie where the cops have a bad habit of shooting innocent people and stupid kids who take a wounded cop hostage get a happy ending and are actually good kids and victums of racism or our capitalist system. also, the climax was way too melodramatic.",1087862400,5,356,4.3283582089552235

I usually read or see something and then forget about it, but this movie was something that hits the heart like nothing else. Even though I cried at the ending (and who wouldn't) and no I'm not telling you what happens, I was enthralled. The story is so realistic it's frightening. It's about life in the ghetto, both in the classroom and on the streets. This could really happen and I'm glad that someone had the guts to open the rest of America's eyes at what is going on.

1098261,5,6305868913,"Light it Up brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ""Ride or die"", as Lester, a student at Lincoln High in New York, takes the school, along with five of his classmates; some friends, some merely acquaintances.  Regardless of their relationships at the beginning of this whole ordeal, they all had one thing in common; they had been branded as gangbangers and deadbeats, before they even had the chance to be themselves.
The sparks begin to fly when Mr. Knowles (Judd Nelson), a highly-respected, well-liked teacher is fired, after becoming a hero.
Driven by the demons that plague his mind, and the memory of his father, Lester Dewitt (Usher Raymond) was only trying to protect his friend Ziggy (Robert Ri'chard), a young artist, from a security officer named Jackson (Forest Whitaker), when the officer loses his gun in the struggle.  The gun goes off, and leaves Jackson with a wound to the leg.
And so it begins. Lester grabs up the gun, and rounds up the five other students who witnessed the struggle, and who knew what really took place, taking Jackson hostage.
Hours will pass... the city will watch... the students will be heard, because this is their time.
Light it Up is sure to grab your gut and twist it with an unrelentness fist.  You will become the characters portrayed, and you will live those hours that killed the demons in their minds, as you sit back in the comfort of your own, cozy living room, and Light it Up.",1002499200,4,1435,4.664031620553359
1098262,4,6305868913,"This was 1 of those powerful movies that you'll see that will keep you thinking about it after you watch it. The beginning starts out with the 6 seperate characters goin through their course of the day. The only 3 characters I can remember are Lester,Ziggy and Ronnie. Ziggy has a small run in with a very cocky police officer (who is assigned to the school to ""make his presence known"" which I must say he does too good of a job at) and when Lester goes to assist Ziggy the cop tells Lester to ""assume the position"" Basicly the whole deal with the hostage situation happens when the real smart ""prissy"" female student is suspended for bad mouthing to the principal about the poor conditions of the school. Another confrontation with Lester,Ziggy and the cop results in the officers gun discharged and the officer wounded. This is now when the school is evacuated and police and swat officers arrive. The officers attempt to enter the school which as their headed up to the frount doors DMX provides an awesome musical background. Its now up to the hostage negotiater(Vanessa Wiliams) to try and end the situation peacefully. During the whole hostage situation the group of students become kind of famous with their point of view on the shooting and their demands sent out to reporters VIA the internet. At this point Lester reveals a dark somewhat powerful secret. His father was gunned down by white cops and I believe 2 weeks before the shooting/hostage situation Lesters family lost their wrongful death lawsuit. [....] What happens then???? Well watch the movie to see what happens. 1 last thing, im not the type to get chocked up watching movies but after watching the end of Light it Up I found myself with some teary eyes. This is a powerful movie that definitly is a reccomendation in my book",995500800,,1801,4.7025316455696204

1098349,5,6305868913,"Too many times in recent years we have tuned into the news only to hear of  another school shooting. In this movie, we see it from the point of view of  the students involved. This brilliant film from Craig Bolotin, the director  of Miami Vice, shows us how good people can suddenly find themselves  involved in bad situations. Because of a self-serving principal and a cop  with too much attitude, six high school students take the cop hostage and  ask for better school furniture, textbooks, etc., as their demands. As the  movie plays on, we see that each character is very deep and complex -- each  with her or his demons, each with redeeming qualities. The beginning of the  film, until the time that the cop is taken hostage, seems contrived and  there are several inconsistencies with the film, but overall, it is  definitely worth watching.",969235200,6,848,4.739726027397261

1098351,4,6305868913,"Inner city schools usually aren't the nicest places in the world. But the condition here is terrible. The windows are broken, only half the students  have books, and the teachers literary don't give a damn about the kids. The  conditions are so terrible that when the only decent teacher gets fired and  a student is attacked by a school cop it pushes six students over the edge.  They take an ingured cop hostage and demand things that should be standared  in schools, like books and windows. The problem is the people in the city  aren't to keen on giving them what they want.
In my opinion this movie  was great and it really opened up peoples eyes to poor conditions in  schools and other serious issues like child abuse drugs and teen pregnency.  I loved it myself. My only complaint is with the cussing. I realize that  people swear a lot but I was watchign this thing with my parents!",967334400,,891,4.5125

The ending  should have revealed more about how the school improved after the holdup  ended though. Believe it or not, this movie is pretty much a Jungian kind  of film, with a great trickster (the troublemaking white guy), threshold  guardian (the tough guy), the underdog (Ziggy), the animus (the smart  girl), the hero (Lester), the shadow (The police officer), the mentor (the  negotiator), and the shapeshifter (The Sarah Gilbert character).

As I was watching this drama featuring a terrific cast of misunderstood yet smart high school students, I was drawn to the immediate and underlying stories that as viewers, you won't observe and understand until the plot thickens and the essence of the significant message is beautifully and powerfully illuminated toward the end. Everything is set into harrowing motion with the unfolding of one accident with a gun. I really felt that the movie addresses the one particular idea that could reduce and eliminate many of our terrible problems in the world and it is taking the time to understand someone wants help or needs it. Unfortunately, as we can learn from watching this stellar movie, sometimes when we learn what needs to be done, it's usually too late.
