Ernst Lubitsch's comedy, THAT UNCERTAIN FEELING is the story of a psychiatric patient with a case of severe hiccups.

SYNOPSIS--
NY socialite Jill Baker (Oberon) consults a shrink (Mowbray) about her insomnia and recurring hiccups. After Dr. Vengard asks stressful questions about her husband Larry (Douglas), Jill's hiccups return. That night, Jill decides that the work-distracted Larry isn't at all attentive when he fails to notice she's spent all day at the beauty salon.

At her next therapy visit, Jill meets Alexander Sebastian, a somewhat misanthropic artist (Meredith) and they in time become romantically involved. Larry's attempt to make Jill jealous by claiming he has a girlfriend fails and Sebastian moves into the Baker home after Larry goes to a hotel.

We are left to ask: Do Jill and Sebastian find happiness together, or does she reconcile with Larry, and if the latter, how can it possibly come about?

I returned my copy to Amazon.

I see now that on a well-known auction website they're selling a much newer release of this movie under the ""American Pop Classics"" label.  Perhaps it's a better print -- they claim it's newly restored.  I haven't seen it.

The movie itself, a gentle satire of the foibles of the upper middle class in the 1930s, is wonderful, with subtle, sophisticated wit in every line, and every actor perfectly in tune with Lubitsch's vision.  I think it's some of Lubitsch's best work.",1426723200,4,820,4.638888888888889

536096,2,630303943X,"""That Uncertain Feeling,"" is an 84 minute, black and white Hollywood comedy: what the English used to call a drawing room comedy; with a definite pre-war flavor.  It was released in April 1941, and America was at war by December, 1941.  It's a rather frivolous film, in fact, considering World War II was already being fought elsewhere. However, it was directed by the great German Ernst Lubitsch, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninotchka/dp/B002R2E3NE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninotchka</a>) who specialized in the frivolous, and was made by his own production company. (Don't feel too bad about this flop though, Lubitsch had several great films yet in him, 1942's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-Be-or-Not-to-Be/dp/B0006Z2KYI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To Be or Not to Be</a>, 1943's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heaven-Can-Wait-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00092ZLEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heaven Can Wait (The Criterion Collection)</a>, and 1946's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cluny-Brown-1946-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-2-Import-Italy/dp/B0041KXFDO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cluny Brown (1946) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - Italy </a>], among others.)  Anyway, THAT UNCERTAIN FEELING is a loose remake of Lubitsch's own 1925 silent film KISS ME AGAIN, and was a flop at its release.  The film also has a definite European flavor, as it was based on the work of the French playwright Victorien Sardou.  It might also have been considered dated at its release, as Sardou was a 19th century figure, whose play ""Tosca"" was the libretto for the opera of the same name.  Donald Ogden Stewart, considered a witty man, wrote the screenplay.  Visual and sound quality are both poor in this release, and there are no subtitles, so many viewers will never know if the film is witty or not.

The picture opens with a lot of mittel euro flavor, lots of mention of Budapest and Hungarian goulash, heaven knows why.  Anyway, young Park Avenue housewife Jill Baker, played by the Indian-born beauty Merle Oberon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wuthering-Heights/dp/B00A2YAPY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wuthering Heights</a>) contracts a case of hiccups six years into her marriage. Her neglectful, otherwise occupied insurance agent husband Larry, played by the suave Melvyn Douglas, (NINOTCHKA) sends Jill to Freudian psychologist Dr. Vengard, played with dry humor by British actor Alan Mowbray.  Vengard concludes that the hiccups are caused by Jill's boredom with her marriage. As to that, well, Jill meets in the doctor's waiting room entertaining but highly Narcissistic concert pianist Alexander Sebastian, played by Burgess  Meredith, (trainer in the Rocky films,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grumpier-Old-Men/dp/B000MGEC5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grumpier Old Men</a>), who really gets to chew the scenery here.  Jill forms a relationship with Sebastian and files for divorce. Her husband Larry, who is still in love with her, initially agrees, but he has some tricks up his sleeve and the couple soon reunites.  Eve Arden, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grease/dp/B001CTGQBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grease</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Our-Miss-Brooks/dp/B00347AIP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Our Miss Brooks</a>) is substantially wasted in the small part of Sally.  Though she does manage to add some bite to the artificial proceedings as secretary to lawyer Kafka.

If you are a crazed Lubitsch fan, you might want to note one of his famous little Lubitsch touches, as he charts the progress of Jill and Alexander's affair by focusing in on some silver-framed portraits.  As to me, I don't know that the world depicted here ever existed, or that it exists now, but I loved Oberon's wardrobe: perhaps that's what the film was really all about.  Unless you're into vintage clothes...",1354060800,2,4517,7.095323741007194
536097,4,630303943X,"First a word about privately manufactured DVDs--

The prints are not great, but I found them quite watchable.  The ""bonus features"" appear not to exist.

Still, this is a reasonably priced way to view these two delightful films.  I was already familiar with ""Beat the Devil"" so I really got this for Lubitsch's ""That Uncertain Feeling"" and I was not disappointed - it's a delightful comedy with some interestingly suggestive moments (""When I come, they go"" - hmmm, it would seem she needs to come more often..) and some great discussions of modern art and music.  I wouldn't mind a better print of this film, but at present there only seem to be over-priced ""imports"" around.

""Beat the Devil"" is a somewhat silly, but quite enjoyable film that plays off Bogart's established screen persona to good effect.  Robert Morley and Peter Lorre are quite amusing and everyone has a good time.  A rather slight film all things considered, but well worth watching.

Why the DVD producers called this ""Comedy Noir"" I couldn't tell you (Lubitsch certainly isn't noirish at all and I'm not really convinced that ""Beat the Devil"" counts as noir either, but maybe) nor why they belong on the same DVD (other than both being in the public domain).

After Dr. Vengard asks stressful questions about her husband Larry (Douglas), Jill's hiccups return. That night, Jill decides that the work-distracted Larry isn't at all attentive when he fails to notice she's spent all day at the beauty salon.

 At her next therapy visit, Jill meets Alexander Sebastian, a somewhat misanthropic artist (Meredith) and they in time become romantically involved. Larry's attempt to make Jill jealous by claiming he has a girlfriend fails and Sebastian moves into the Baker home after Larry goes to a hotel.

We are left to ask: Do Jill and Sebastian find happiness together, or does she reconcile with Larry, and if the latter, how can it possibly come about?

Most of the reviews are a little old, but I'm still confused about their issues of quality.  For the money it's pretty good.  On ""That Uncertain Feeling,"" I'd give the image a B- and the sound a B-.  On Beat the Devil I'd give the image a B+ and the sound a B.  Overall you get two intriuging, rewatchable and entertaining movies for a budget price.",1086566400,7,599,4.5327102803738315
536175,4,630303943X,"A blithe screwball comedy from director Ernst Lubitsch about an ""ideal"" modern couple (known to their friends as ""the Happy Bakers"") whose marriage is on the rocks... Merle Oberon has a six-year itch; her husband (Melvyn Douglas) is a bit of a boob, an all right guy, but a bit obsessed with his work and at times inattentive.  When Merle bumps into a free-thinking, artsy malcontent (a young Burgess Meredith, in a choice, juicy role), she falls in his arms and throws her marriage away.  The story was originally filmed by Lubitsch in the silent era, but whether it's 1925 or 1941, the plot is still startlingly frank and modern: Douglas takes the affair and divorce in his stride, and even does a bit of fooling around on his own in a bid to get his wife back... The film features brisk, witty dialogue and a zippy start, and though it kind of loses a little steam midway through, it's still pretty fun.  Several great character actors are in the cast, including Eve Arden and Sig Rumann... Maybe not the greatest Lubitsch film ever, but it's still a gas.  Recommended!",1072396800,18,1072,4.626315789473685
536176,5,630303943X,"This is a very entertaining film.  A rich an married socialite, with a devoted, but buisness minded husband, works selling insurance.  The wife, Jill is neglected and wants some excitement and attention, as well as more romance. She turns to a self-centered man who plays the piano, and is said to be great in art.  He says ""Phooey,"" about practically everything.  Husband and wife reconcile and all is forgiven. It's a really must see movie and is one of the best in my opinion.
  Merle Oberon  Melyvn Douglas are brilliant in it.  They make a romantic, and comical couple at times.  It deserves many many stars.",1045526400,7,613,4.7075471698113205
536177,4,630303943X,"This love story is original by the level of humor it contains. A wife can get bored in her married life by the lack of unforeseen events, by the routine of her husband's money-earning lifestyle. She might get attracted by some marginal artist or personality that seems to shine and glow with an unforeseeable life. But this attraction is only superficial and it gets boring in its turn by the total unpredictability of the new man and the film implies woman wants some stability and regularity. So the love affair comes to an end because of this conflict of psychological interests in the woman. Well done and very funny in many ways, though rather anti-artistic and anti-modern art.

536180,4,630303943X,"This deadpan, low-key, even claustrophobic Lubitsch is one of the master's subtlest films, and his wisest parable on the precariousness of marriage, the ease with which it can descend into unthinking routine and boredom; the continual games, tricks, strategies, even violence needed to galvanise it into something approaching life.
Merle Oberon is the seemingly enviable wife of a charming-but-dull insurance executive, whose inner dissatisfaction emerges in hiccups and insomnia.  she is beguiled by a boorish, would-be idiosyncratic mediocre pianist, Burgess Meredith, with a penchant for dismissing everything as 'Phooey!'  He introduces her to the world of art, especially modern painting; and, rapt with novelty, and a man who seems to take an interest in her as a person, rather than a trophy, she falls for him.  To win her back, husband Melvyn Douglas must apply his salesman genius to his marriage.
'Feeling', like the films of his late years, is relatively muted Lubitsch - there are few of the visual conceits or accumulated comic hysterics we have come to expect from his 'touch'.  The one major comic set-piece, a dinner given for Hungarian clients led by a man called Kafka (!), leads into strange, fragmented territory, and a beautiful, suspended eroticism.
Lubitsch is eminently fair-minded (or cynical!): both partners are liable to take the other for granted, and must learn to forgoe selfish power games in favour of a more satisfying equality - Meredith is a negative, very funny spanner in this process.
for a film that makes middlebrow fun of the excesses of modern art, 'That Uncertain Feeling' is a model example of modernism, Lubitsch's precise geometry of style, his use of frames (photos, paintings etc.) within tight compositions leading to the cool irony that complements the underlying, rarely stated emotion.  Merle Oberon, as mysteriously expressive as one of Franju's doll-masks, is radiant.",1001376000,12,1924,5.315789473684211
