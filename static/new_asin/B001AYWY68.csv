3475767,4,B001AYWY68,"Having gone through many of the YOGA poses on Wii fit I figured that a ""beginners"" DVD would be a good follow up for further strenghtening.  This instructor Elena Brower is very skilled, calm, and clear, she just moves a little fast.  The AM portion of the DVD had the most poses I had tried before as the PM section seems to be more for stress release and meditation.  Going from pose to pose without pausing as on the Wii makes it feel like more of a workout.  My son likes trying this out with me in the morning sometimes, but he says it makes him a little sore.  The whole family has tried this DVD out and all of us will continue to use it for motivation and relaxtion.

3475768,4,B001AYWY68,"I own several yoga DVDs and greatly appreciate the benefits yoga brings - better sense of balance, improved flexibility, ability to handle stress and to relax more. Yoga is something that every human could draw from, if they could only find a half hour each day to dedicate to its practice.

Yoga AM PM gives you that ability. You get two quick routines - one for the morning, one for the evening, and neither one is a high challenge. Both are routines that the most basic of people could give a try and find success with. The instructor does a great job of offering options. If you can't touch your toes, reach for your thighs instead. If you can't fold flat, fold partially. She is always instructing you to take your time, to be patient, to go at your own pace. Yoga is not a competition. It is about stretching your own personal horizons.

The landscape is beautiful - flowers, ocean - but really, after the first watch or two you aren't looking at the TV at all. You are immersed in your own practice, listening to her voice, going through the moves in your own space. I greatly appreciate that they filmed it in a ""pretty place"" but in the overall scheme of things that isn't as important as the vocal quality. They did an awesome job in both areas so I think people with either type of orientation will be happy.

I do wish there was more here. Most DVDs I own have multiple tracks, with a wide variety of routines to work through. Here you only have two. AM. PM. That's it. I really think for a DVD they should have had more information. If nothing else, as this is for beginners, they should have had some sort of an ""intro track"" that explained what downward facing dog, child's pose, etc. really were all about. I have done yoga for a while so when the instructor says ""go up into downward facing dog"" I don't think about it, I simply do it. If someone really was a true beginner and grabbed this DVD to get started, they would have no idea what was being asked of them. I definitely do thing a track of ""intro to yoga"" and then another track of ""the basic moves and information about each one"" would be quite warranted here.

So that is my caveat. If you really are a beginner, sit and watch the DVD a few times without actually trying it, to see what she is doing and get an understanding for the poses. Once you understand what she is asking you to do, then give it a shot in time with her and start doing the practice. I do very much like the routines she does, and like the background and soundtrack. I just wish they used the ample space available on the DVD to provide more information to those seeking it.",1224028800,,2624,4.316430020283976
3475769,4,B001AYWY68,"I own many yoga DVD's and love to practice yoga at home during my kids nap times. I would say this video is pretty typical when it comes to your meditation, warm-ups & poses. However, unlike some DVD's it does not get ""too spiritual"" on you which I really liked.

The video is a little over an hour long, the Morning section being longer than the Evening section. Two days after doing them both I am still feeling the work-out. I would say the Morning was a great workout to break a sweat and the Evening was more stretching and cool-down. Neither include many balance poses. I did enjoy the scenery, voice of the instructor, light music in the background. Also found her constant reminding me to ""smile"" through the poses humorous.

If you want a nice relaxing (but good workout) video this is your DVD. If you want something easy, it's not, if you want something really strenuous, it's not for you either.",1224028800,,907,4.524390243902439
3475770,5,B001AYWY68,"Elena Brower has done another great job with this two-part AM & PM Yoga for Beginners.

As other reviewers have noted, it might require a little extra work for beginners but it is well worth the effort. If you don't understand a term, simply Google it. This is better than having the descriptive flow of a movement interrupted for a definition, not to mention that you would have to hear it every time you watched the DVD. If a movement is a little difficult for you, stick with it and it will be yours within a couple of weeks.

Beautiful music, rich settings, a calm and soothing voice-over by Brewer (who isn't too hard on the eyes, by the way) and you got the perfect start to the day, and the perfect ending to it just before bed time.

Get this one.",1224028800,,755,4.302816901408451
3475771,3,B001AYWY68,"This is a good yoga video, but it is important to realize that it is not an instructional video for absolute beginners. The poses may be easy enough for beginners to tackle, but this is not a video for teaching yoga to a novice.

The video consists of two sets of postures (poses, movements), one for morning and one for evening. Elena Brower obviously knows her stuff, and each pose is shown from a variety of angles. The narration is helpful and clear. There are some instructions for a few variations based on the learner's abilities.

While the video is well shot and the poses well done, I find it lacking in instructional value. There is too much unexplained jargon; ""soften your eyes,"" ""inhale brightly open,"" and so on. The yogic names, when used, are not explained, spelled out onscreen, or pronounced slowly. There is no booklet included to explain, define, or clarify any of the material. Someone already familiar with yoga, or other similar  practices, could learn the routines fairly easily from this video.

This all serves to make it more difficult for a rank beginner who might want to start learning yoga from this video. The routines are great, and would be a wonderful addition to one's yoga regime. Just don't make the mistake of thinking you will jumpstart your study of yoga from this video.

With that caveat to warn off absolute beginners, I find this to be a nice presentation of a couple of great yoga routines for those already familiar enough with yoga to add to their practice.",1223942400,142,1506,4.7110266159695815
3475772,5,B001AYWY68,"When it comes to yoga, I am definately a beginner and don't do it often because some yoga programs are too challenging for me.  This one is great and I'm glad I decided to give it a go.  I didn't get it the first time round but I'm finding it getting a little easier with each go and now I'll be enjoying the challenge of progressing to a higher level of it.
This has a gorgeous setting outdoors by the ocean and so that in itself is nice and relaxing.  The AM segment is done with standing movements to help energize you and the PM segment is more focused on relaxing and elongating your muscles and nice stretches.  I find down dog and sun salutation to be my two favourite moves here.  Ellen is a great instructor who has the perfect soft voice for yoga teaching and the way she describes the moves, helps you visualise them without necessarily having to look at your tv set.
While I'm new to yoga, I do find this great.  As I mentioned, yoga usually seemed intimidating yet this workout isn't that at all.  So if you haven't tried it before (or you have and didn't like it), I think this workout will suit you.  It's easy to do and relaxing.  I highly recommend it.",1221264000,52,1169,4.253393665158371

3475804,5,B001AYWY68,"Excellent yoga DVD.
I am returning to yoga after 5 years.
I used to take a yoga class daily prior to that.
I'm in love with yoga even more and I think what's better is I appreciate it more now that I'm a few years older.
I began having huge problems with anxiety, nervousness, being high strung all the time.
My stress was so bad it was starting to affect my health in certain areas.
And I'm young--only 27 and felt I was losing touch.
I decided to get back into yoga and have been doing so for only two weeks now every day for an hour or two hours. Usually I do an AM session for 30 minutes to an hour and also a PM session 30 minutes to an hour. I do a minimum of an hour of yoga everyday.
And I've already felt the benefits.
I feel more at peace with myself and when I come out of my meditation at the end I feel like I'm coming out of a dreamlike, trancelike state like I'm on high on yoga.
I think it's my chakras rebalancing.
Anyway this is a great addition to your routine. I usually do this one and I have a Rodney Yee am/pm that I do as well.
I plan on getting more yoga DVDS to incorporate into my practice.",1454803200,7,1117,3.9251101321585904

The AM segment is to wake your body up and prepare you for the day.

I'm not too flexible, but am young so I was looking for something beginners but not too basic, and I feel this is a great intro DVD. I was able to do the poses, the instructor gives you options for those with bad limbs or if their muscles aren't very strong, and she also calls out the names and has a calming voice.
The good thing is although it seems easy, the level of strength difficulty varies, providing repeat opportunities.",1449100800,,621,4.132231404958677

The pm practice I know I love and I do it at least once a week, if not more. The pm practice is a great way to unwind after a long day of work, it really helps stretch out some of the areas you might gather stress in and release it for the day.

It's not a power yoga to get your blood pumping but a nice easy and slow practice. I recommend this if you want to help ease into and out of your day.",1446422400,4,741,3.641509433962264

3475819,5,B001AYWY68,"I've been interested in this DVD for some time, as it's one of the few routines on video taught by an Anusara Yoga-trained instructor.  This DVD is led by Elena Brower, a senior Anusara instructor at the time that this video was filmed.  She is featured alone here, instructing via voiceover in a beautiful flowered garden overlooking the Pacific that is the standard setting for most of the Element DVDs I have tried.

As the title would suggest, ELEMENT AM & PM YOGA FOR BEGINNERS offers two routines, one for morning and one for evening.  Both are quite gentle, and both would be appropriate for MOST beginners, but I always believe that some prior experience and familiarity with yoga is helpful before using a DVD.  I have broken down each of the routines (which are chaptered off the main menu) in greater detail below.

AM ROUTINE (35.5 minutes)
*tadasana (mountain pose) with several cycles of breathing/circling arms
*step back into cat/cow pose
*downward dog to down dog/plank vinyasa
*cat/cow
*twisting lunge
*step forward/set intention
*2 slow sun salutations
*warrior 2, moving in/out
*side angle pose, bowing/expanding
*wide angle forward bend
*warrior 1, moving in/out
*warrior 3, balance only briefly
*modified side plank (odd entry to this)
*sphinx pose
*moving locust
*boat
*bridge
*lying twist
*return to seated (<1) - no shavasana!

PM PRACTICE (28 minutes)
*start seated/2 moving meditations
*down dog/1 vinyasa
*pigeon prep, moving into twist
*down dog to child to seated thuderbolt
*seated twist
*stick pose (aka staff)
*twist/countertwist
*stick pose #2
*seated forward bend
*stick pose #3
*bound angle
*sukasana (simple seated)
*janu sirsasana (head-to-knee)
*shavasana (3m) - end seated

I enjoyed these practices.  In the AM routine, I particularly liked how Brower added movement to the standing postures; this had a Viniyoga feel to me.  The PM practice was entirely on the floor and was relaxing (although not necessarily sleep-inducing).  I also liked Brower herself, as I found her to cue well and to have a calming, soothing voice.

I really like Elena's voice and clear instsructions, including when she mentions to smile softly, which sends joy throughout you.  I watched it with my sister-in-law, who immediately ordered one for herself.  It may be for beginners, but it's no walk in the park.  I find myself sweating through it.

Modifications are also given, which is very helpful for somebody just starting out. I have tried one other yoga DVD since purchasing this and I did not like it at all. There were no modifications given and I felt like moves weren't explained well so I was more focused on trying to watch and see what I was doing as opposed to focusing on my breathing. I just ordered 2 more DVD's from Element, which I hope are just as good. I like some variety when I am working out, and since there are only 2 routines on this DVD I did want something else to supplement it.

All the people that wrote in their reviews that this DVD isn't for beginniners, really? I don't know how it gets more ""for beginners"" than this. When I tried the AM yoga, I was a little more pleased. We actually did some poses. Yes, they are a little harder than the PM, but that's the point, people! You take your time with it and you work your way up to complete the full pose! She takes it so slowly that you can easily follow along. I have other yoga DVDs that go much much faster where you don't have any time to catch up. Trust me, this is for beginners. No one should expect to be able to do all the poses the first try, there would be no point in following the DVD again. It's about learning the poses and taking your time.

3475869,4,B001AYWY68,"I really like this video quite a bit. A little info about me, I am 29 I had 3 children via c-section my most recent one being a year ago. After that my recovery was much longer than the first two due to complications and the others were when I was 21 and 23 so my body didn't bounce back as well. So I became pretty sedentary after that, I am thin so I have no weight to lose, but just in the ""in shape"" aspect my body isn't bouncing back. My strength is the lowest it had ever been, my stamina and flexibility is very low. So I wanted to get back into working out and decided that yoga would be a good start.

I got this about 6 months ago, I haven't been following it consistently, unfortunately, only maybe 3 weeks total but broken up into off days and on days. I really like the night sequence, it is very relaxing. I don't care for the morning routine, but that may be because the downward dog is my least favorite pose, and she uses that pose about 15 times. My hamstrings are pretty inflexible so I struggle a bit with that pose. The warrior sequence in the morning is a bit boring. It works, but since she does the 3 variations nearly back to back, by the end of the second one I feel as though I would rather skip it and move to the next pose. I actually kind of dread doing the warrior sequence, not because it's hard but because I get bored of the repetitiveness.

So for that reason I docked a star, but overall it's a good beginner dvd.",1379203200,,1449,4.080701754385965
3475870,2,B001AYWY68,"I've done yoga on and off for years, and used to consider myself at the intermediate level. I recently had surgery and wasn't able to do any kind of exercise for close to 3 months, so I broke out my beginner yoga DVDs this past week, to slowly build back up. I can honestly say that this is not for beginners. They are good sequences and the AM is a good workout, but not for beginners. My arms were literally shaking after all the time in down dog, plank, and inclined plane position. I laughed when she suggested moving my hands into prayer position in Warrior 3; I'd have fallen on my face. I agree with the other reviewer about the instructions on breathing -- as a singer, I know how to breathe, and it is not possible to inhale while ""rounding the back."" Another criticism is that she does not always name the poses as you are doing them; she describes the moves, but doesn't necessarily name the pose. So, I ended up stopping and looking up just to discover that she was in down dog. The DVD does not include the individual poses, so the only way to see how to do them is to either break your pose or to watch the DVD without practicing.",1377993600,4,1144,4.252293577981652

Then I started a new job and my life got a little too hectic for yoga, so my practice fell away. (Yes, I see the irony there.) But this dvd is a great refresher. Being familiar with the moves helps, but now that my arthritis has advanced quite a bit, some of the moves are more challenging than they used to be. The morning program is great for the burst of energy I need to get me going; the evening program is not my favorite, but it does help my busy mind start to calm down and let go of the day. The routines are simple, and I can see that I might get bored with the repetition after a few weeks, but it's a good dvd to get back into the yoga habit. By the time I get bored with the routines, I might be ready for some Shiva Rea or Rodney Yee again.",1365897600,,845,3.834285714285714

Unlike most of the yoga today that is more of a fitness sport, this DVD brings it back to the core and reminds me more of a Qi Gong experience. You really feel revived and healthy after a session. Great for relaxation and getting off to a good start in the morning.

Softly spoken and excellent guidance, you don't feel like you have to watch as you do the poses and this lets you ease into the moment.",1365724800,,462,4.310344827586207

For an older beginner like I am, the pace is about right and the positions complement each other. For some positions, Elena Brower suggests adjustments matched to the fitness level of beginners. She provides clear instructions for the positions with excellent integration of breathing. The sound of her voice and the background music is soothing and pleasant.

I hope Elena will make a follow-up DVD that would offer an intermediate program because eventually I will move on but I'd like to stay with the same excellent instruction.

Even though the PM section is a little too ""new age-y"" for me at the end, I have learned to ignore that part of it and continue with the moves I find most relaxing & enjoyable.

It is very basic and designed for those with little/no yoga experience, but the instructor does an excellent job of describing advanced modifications to the basic poses to allow people to progress past the beginner stages at their own pace.

DVD includes a 35 minute ""AM"" session designed to do first thing in the morning, and a 30 minute ""PM"" session designed to do just before bed.",1358380800,3,601,4.3097345132743365

This DVD doesn't do it for me.  I did the PM segment, and there was a whole lot of breathing and a little stretching.  It was SO slow, that instead of feeling relaxed, I started feeling uptight that it wouldn't move on.

For true yogis, this may be a great DVD.  If you're like me, and you want a little more exercise and a little less meditation, I'd look elsewhere.",1358208000,6,514,4.28125

To be fair, I have only done the PM segment, but I disliked it so much, I will not bother trying the AM routine. The problem for me was the breathing. I found it unnatural and very awkward. The instructor says to inhale while rounding our backs (thus, scrunching up our lungs and organs), and exhale while expanding our chests. This just seems to be the opposite of every other yoga DVD I have ever done. I know I can get a much better inhale while opening my chest and expanding my lungs than I can when I'm all hunched over. This just really ruined it for me - and frankly the breathing was a bit painful. Some of the other poses were also uncomfortable/painful to me - especially in the lower back area. The whole idea of the PM segment was to relax my body and mind, and it really failed in doing that. Other things I did not like: the instructor used Sanskrit terms for the positions, without offering their English translations. While there is nothing wrong with learning the proper terms, many people (including me) do not know many of them. I had to constantly look at the screen to see what she was doing (which was difficult in some of the poses). I also felt that there was a bit too much ""just lying there"" during the routine. I can recline/meditate/reflect on my own time. I felt that these parts of the routine were ""filler."" Long story short, I just really did not like this DVD or the instructor. It seems that I am in the minority here - so I will pass my copy along to a friend and hope that somebody can get more benefit from it that I will.",1344643200,5,1640,4.2935483870967746

The AM routine is somewhat challenging in spots, but not so much that I can't do it, and that's good because I feel like I'm getting a bit of a workout.  For the more challenging poses, she offers the easier version, then specified ""for a more challenging version...."" so it's totally up to you how to do it.  The base is perfect - slow enough for you to watch and keep up with her, and feels serene, without making me feel impatient waiting for the next thing.

The PM routine is more relaxed and gentle, perfect for an afternoon or evening unwind.  I usually do them both together, but on days when I am sore or not feeling well, I can just do the PM routine and feel like I got a little yoga into my day.

She emphasizes breath a lot, which I really like.  After doing these routines, I feel relaxed and serene.  One of the reasons I started doing yoga was to help my high blood pressure, and breathing is key for that.  Yoga has definitely improved my BP readings and makes me feel good about myself at the same time.

I am a beginner; my only prior experience with yoga was a feeble attempt to follow a pregnancy yoga dvd, which I found to be poorly done and cheesy. I was so afraid this video might be more of the same, but to my relief it is the opposite.

The dvd is very professionally done, the routine has a nice flow and is easy to follow. The first few times I had to watch more than do, but after a few practices I am now anticipating the next pose and following well.

There is some sort of spacy new-agey verbage, but I didn't find it offensive (stop and express gratitude to those who encourage your yoga practice...). The music is also light and non-distracting, just enough.

It is also possible to break the routines into smaller chunks if you only have a short amount of time. The first 10 minutes of the AM workout are self-contained enough to be used on busier days when you want to do *something*.",1285200000,,741,4.606060606060606

3475912,5,B001AYWY68,"Now that I'm staggering into my mid-forties I've decided to focus on lower-impact workouts.  Although I still need to maintain a cardio routine to fend off my gut, I also want a decent strength and flexibility workout that won't send me to the ER.  ""AM & PM Yoga for Beginners"" fits nicely into the latter category.

This DVD comes with two thirty-minute workouts that can be done separately or all together (a half-hour is my yoga limit).  Both are led by the competent Elena Brower via voice-over, and are set on, as the package states, ""a beautifully serene location overlooking the Pacific Ocean.""  The accompanying music is good and soothing, although the lower range during the PM workout was a bit overwhelming to the speakers on my Samsung 32"" LCD TV.

AM Workout: This routine is the more challenging of the two and is meant to gear you up for the day.  It contains the usual downward dogs, planks, twisted lunges, warriors, and so forth.  Although the workout can be done without a cardio-type warm-up, I like to do so because it loosens me up and makes the poses more accessible.  I'd classify the AM Workout more towards the intermediate side due to the tougher poses (particularly Warrior 3 and Side Balance).  Indeed, if you're new to yoga I recommend beginning with the PM Workout.

PM Workout: This is a nice end-of-day routine, meant to relax you before bedtime.  The most strenuous parts of the routine are a couple of planks and downward dogs, but there are plenty of stretching poses like pigeon and seated twists to ease you into restfulness.  Even though it's less strenuous than the AM workout, I still found it profitable to warm up beforehand with some cardio.  I found the instructor's suggestion to sit on a pillow to raise my seat to knee level during the seated portion helpful (it was the first time I'd tried that particular prop).

Ms. Brower's instruction is clear and easy to follow.  She's quite graceful, and her movements through the poses provide a good example (she suggests easier modifications as necessary).  Her focus on proper breathing and a serene mental attitude throughout both routines is unobtrusive.  I found it comforting that she pointed out how each side of the body can respond differently to a pose (I previously found that fact a bit disconcerting).

""AM & PM Yoga for Beginners"" is a fine addition to anyone's yoga workout DVD collection (NOTE: for every four Element DVDs sold, the company will plant a tree...sweet!).  I liked both routines, especially since they didn't exceed my maximum yoga workout length tolerance.  In addition, I recommend Sara Ivanhoe's excellent and accessible 20-Minute Yoga Makeover series if you also enjoy shorter yoga workouts or are considering adding yoga to your exercise routine for the first time.

3475914,2,B001AYWY68,AM and PM were basically the same.  I was looking for a beginners yoga and did not think this was for beginners.  There are many many moves I cannot do.,1277337600,3,152,4.033333333333333
3475915,3,B001AYWY68,"I like the steady pace of the DVD.  Too many other Yoga workouts are choppy when changing from one position to the next.  This DVD is contains two CONTINUOUS segments for both the AM and PM routines.  Plus one segment that combines both routines.  That being said, the times listed on this DVD are seriously misleading.  I'm okay with the AM routine running over the 30 minutes; the PM routine doesn't come close.

AM Yoga starts immediately and truly ends at the 34 minute mark, with 2 minutes afterwards for breathing.  The AM segment is the star of the DVD.

PM Yoga has a true routine time of 17.5 minutes.  The first 3+ minutes consist of sitting cross legged and breathing.  At the 22:25 mark, you lie on your back until the 26 minute mark, where you sit cross legged once again and breath.  PM ends at 26:49.

I was looking for a SOLID 30 minute yoga workout.  I found the lack of movement of the PM routine to be highly annoying and actually created stress since I wanted to move and stretch after a day of sitting in the office.  I wasn't looking for anything too strenuous.  Just a basic DVD that involved more movement.  I understand the concept of relaxation, but those two ""breathe & meditate"" segments should come BEFORE and AFTER your 30 minutes...not during.",1275609600,9,1274,4.521929824561403

3475917,5,B001AYWY68,"I've read in other reviews that people were complaining that she didn't give enough instructional information or that the moves hurt injuries that they had.  If you have any injuries or are not in general good health, you should consult your doctor and/or  look for a disc that is specifically geared towards people with back pain, knee injuries, arthritis, etc...

No, Elena doesn't give a lot of instruction.  She does explain how to execute the move, but she doesn't give a yoga history/theory lesson throughout the workout.  I, for one, am grateful.  I hate listening to a bunch of talking while doing yoga.  It keeps me from centering.  If that's what you're looking for, then go get an instructional video.

This is definitely in the realm of the possible for beginners, but do expect a challenge.  If it was totally easy, then it wouldn't be worth doing!  I'm not new to yoga, but am coming back after a long break and this was exactly what I was looking for!

The AM set is 34 minutes long.  It gets you warmed up, focused and energized for your day.  My only regret is that I don't normally have time to do it before work and have to save it for the weekends.

The PM set is 26 minutes long.  It is exactly what I need at the end of the day.  By the time I get to the final resting pose, I feel as though I could lay there in a trance on my yoga mat for the whole rest of the night.  It is perfect on the days when I do a hard elliptical training after work and need something soothing to stretch out my muscles and calm my mind.

Elena is a magnificent instructor.  Her voice is soothing and her execution is perfect.  She gives just enough direction without being overly chatty.  I will get more of her work!

3475918,3,B001AYWY68,"Let me say first that I'm not a beginner to yoga, but my partner is. We bought this dvd because we both are
fairly inflexible (I still struggle with poses after many classes of yoga postures), and we wanted good stretches and the beginning poses. I also have Tendonitis in both wrists.

While this dvd is set in a beautiful place, the teacher (at least in the A.M. portion of the dvd) quickly leads the viewer/participant through several faster-paced Sun Salutation moves. She does a nice job of explaining the first few moves, including Downward-Facing Dog, but she does not offer modified suggestions -- such as Dolphin Pose or putting towels under your hands -- for those of us with bad wrists. Downward-Facing Dog is also not the best exercise for those of us who struggle with flexibility. Plus, Plank, and Downward-Facing Dog are horrible for the wrists. I did the first few minutes, and ended up taking a few Ibuprofen because the pain in my wrists was so bad. I also had to look up alternatives (listed above) to these traditional postures.

My partner, who has never done yoga (shocking!), felt that she went too quickly. My partner has hip issues, and Downward-Facing Dog hurt her hips.

There are many postures you can do in a beginner's yoga class, and I'm not sure why Elena Brower chose The Sun Salutations poses. To me, they are tedious and also cause pain.

In short, this is a decent dvd for those with no injuries to hips or wrists, and for those who have done yoga before and want a normal-paced class on Sun Salutations. It is not for people who want a gentle, modified yoga for injuries or inflexibility.",1273276800,14,1625,4.631944444444445

Some of the moves are the same/similar as in her other beginner yoga video by Element, but different enough for both to be worth the money to buy. Both the AM and PM routines are about 30 minutes.

I truly believe my stress level has decreased as a result of this DVD. An added bonus is the toning I have witnessed in my arms, thanks to the planks and downward dogs.

Also, the accompanying verbal description is complete and detailed enough that it can be followed with only episodic need to look at the screen to see exactly what is going on.

3475930,4,B001AYWY68,"Let me just preface my review by saying that I have never given a 5 star review to a workout video and I own some that I like very much.  So four is a good review for me and to me a 5 star rating would mean the video was perfect (which none are).  Also I have done yoga on and off for many years so I don't exactly qualify as the absolute beginner this video is targeted for.

Into my review: I really like this video. I do the am yoga almost every morning and fnd rejuvinating and a nice way to wake.  I occasionally do the pm one, especially if I'm having trouble sleeping.  And I've thrown both together for a longer routine on the weekend.  All three have pleased me.

The instruction is very well done and easy to follow, I only had to look at the screen once in the whole workout the first time I was doing it to check that I was correct.  And she gives both the Hindu and english names for the poses which is good for beginners trying to learn.  She speaks just enough to be informative without being chatty, and her voice and the music are very soothing.  I think a beginner would have no trouble figuring out the poses.  Also, there's a lot of work attuning to your breath and explicitly changing the pose with inhale and exhale which I liked as a way to awaken your muscles.  And the poses flow very easily from one to the next with no awkward changes.

Things that bothered me.  The sun salutations in the am routine are extremely short.  It's just standing forward bend, plank, child's pose, downdog.  And then seperately she went through warrior I, II, and III.  I wish those had been incorporated into the sun salutation.  And that some more poses (side angle, triangle) had been included.  However, this is a beginner's DVD so I can see how the way she does it would be helpful.

Overall: I think this would be an exquisite DVD for someone just coming to yoga (that said I don't think anything can replace classes and this should perhaps be just a supplement).  This was great for me as I was looking just for a relaxing, easy yoga routine to start my day.

I always feel energized after the AM program and feel like my muscles have gotten a challenge. The PM program is relaxing and really helps me distance myself from the stress of life and work.

3475936,5,B001AYWY68,This an excellent video for beginners.  For me it has provided a good intro to yoga and a good general stretching and exercise program.  The teacher is outstanding - provides clear instruction and alternatives as you get into the program.,1239926400,,238,4.925
3475937,2,B001AYWY68,"I have Elena Brower's other DVD for beginners - and I liked it.  This one seems a little jargon-y and wierd - telling us to breathe into our LEFT lung, and to feel the space between the hemispheres of our brains.
Perhaps you should use it with the sound off - the poses are fine.",1239321600,13,279,4.072727272727272
3475938,5,B001AYWY68,"I really enjoy Elena Brower's two Element DVDs, and wish she produced more.  The setting in this yoga DVD is beautiful, her voice is soothing and the vinyasa yoga practice is well calibrated in both AM & PM sets.  I have a pretty extensive yoga DVD collection and like to include this as a regular. I find that doing yoga exercises at home takes up less time and is less costly than going to my nearby yoga studio, but I stil get a great work out!

Well done Elena, and I look forward to your next offering.",1238716800,,507,4.206185567010309
3475939,2,B001AYWY68,"The AM portion of this DVD was great, but the PM version was pretty blah. I understand that yoga is about breathing, but JUST breathing? I thought stretching was involved, too. I've used it once. I wouldn't recommend it.",1237334400,3,220,4.666666666666667
3475940,4,B001AYWY68,"I purchased this DVD with a little trepidation, as I've never been very good at Yoga. As soon as I put the DVD in I began to feel a little better, as the instructor, Elena Brower, introduced the program and explained the purpose of the different segments.

The AM section does exactly what it claims, incorporating movement between various poses to add a small bit of aerobic exercise in. By the end of the AM section I felt charged and fully awake.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone looking to add Yoga into their fitness routine.",1235347200,2,535,4.505154639175258

+ Elena does a nice of job of talking you through the poses.  I would try another yoga video from her in the future.
+ This is a good beginner level.
+ Calming music and ambiance

-AM yoga's difficulty level seemed higher than PM.  Although I know that PM Yoga is more of a wind down, I would have liked for them to be more on the same level of difficulty.",1234483200,,393,4.0
3475943,5,B001AYWY68,"I was a Varsity Tennis player years ago, which demanded regular workouts. Given a rigorous 4 day work schedule easily compromised my discipline over time. I had never done Yoga before but a close college friend said it helped her during Medical School and she reaped many physical benefits from Yoga. This DVD provided a great into for stretching and getting acquainted with this physical activity. It's perfect for beginners, and did not overextended. Although I was a little hesitant to do Yoga, since I was never particularly flexible, this was a great tool for an intro. I'd like to continue a Yoga program based on my initial experience-it was great to learn the basics of being ""still"", something that comes hard in my busy every day schedule!",1231804800,,749,4.859375
3475944,5,B001AYWY68,"LCW on September 27, 2008 wrote a great detailed review explaining the moves in the 25-30 min each two sessions.
Elena Brower did a great job here of creating flow & keeping the pace calming, slow enough for you to be able to feel how the poses benefit your body, yet fast enough that today's rushed feeling population won't feel bored. She has a great voice that is never irritating or forced slow voiceover like some other yoga dvds. She teaches YOUR left/right so you can mirror her image & follow easily. I've tried over 150 yoga dvds & there are not that many I feel have body awareness like Elena. She has done a great job of telling you what body parts to be aware of in terms of changes & she's very accurate. She will ask you which lung feels more open & to breathe and put focus on them so they are both more open & I never realized my left lung felt soo tight & in the several seconds it really helped open up my breathing capacity. Everything she said was perfect, not too much info, not too little. Even though I was in a rush & normally I'll FFW through child's pose or simple resting sitting poses, I didn't want to miss anything she might teach/say.
This is for beginners, the AM will be more likely to make you sweat, though it's for beginners. If it's not hard enough, you can always go deeper into the pose, hold harder poses longer (replay portion/pause dvd as well), do downward dog with only 1 leg 3 legged down dog), etc. Yoga dvds are very versatile depending on endurance level & beginner dvds tend to have more rest periods, so you can hold or re-do a hard pose while they are resting. If you want it easier, you can get out & rest sooner then the instructor. The PM is more about easy stretches that won't make you sweat & to relax you to help you sleep.
I find any workouts that don't incorporate body awareness is a waste as well as boring. To be taught to be more aware is empowering as well as feeling of more benefit other then calorie burn or muscle building & positive feeling during & after. This feeling will carry over to mood as well & effect your interaction with the world around you in a better way.
The only yoga dvd instructors I love that are very calming w/o being boring or annoying w/TRUE body awareness are:
Rodney Yee, Rainbow Mars, Seane Corn, Gurutej Kaur, Kristin Mcgee, Wai Lana, Kristen Strohecker, Max Strom, Teigh McDonough, Ateeka, Jacquie Noelle Greaux, Shiva Rea (only for those with endurance) & now add Elena Brower.
Non-yoga/non-belly or latin dance fitness body awareness instructors:
Duncan Wong, Kari Anderson, Liz Gillies, Stephanie Herman, Rael Isacowitz

If you want to take charge of your health, not just lose calories/build muscle (though yoga does that great as well), more body awareness w/o feeling it a mindless workout, give this a chance.",1230422400,8,2815,4.498046875
3475945,4,B001AYWY68,"Great beginers Yoga. I suffer with terrible back pain, and I find that this dvd helps me relax and loosen my muscles. The poses aren't difficult, but you do need  to do this on at least a semi-regular basis.",1230076800,,207,4.3076923076923075
3475946,4,B001AYWY68,"I got this because I like to stay somewhat flexible for playing golf.  I've tried Yoga a couple of times before and found that it seems to put a lot of pressure on the joints while not really stretching the muscles all that much.  I was fairly pleased with this program, as it doesn't seem to put much pressure on the joints.  The poses are easy, feel good, and I think you get a nice stretch.  I was surprised to find just how relaxing Yoga can be:  some of the poses are held for moderate periods of time, while the instructor has you breathing in and out.  It's really quite soothing.

I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the routines get a bit long.  For something you're supposed to do every morning and evening, I think 30 minutes gets a bit time consuming, 20 would have been better.

Overall though, I like this program and feel that it's a good choice for beginners.  I didn't find any of the poses particularly hard at all - the hardest part is trying to do the poses correctly when you're facing away from the TV screen.  You have to do it a few times to learn them all correctly.",1227139200,,1094,4.211538461538462
3475947,5,B001AYWY68,"This DVD has good routines, and is definitely geared towards beginners or those who prefer a more slow-moving yoga practice.  I personally prefer to continue moving rather than holding poses while listening to the instructor talk.  But it was very relaxing, and overall provided nice routines.",1227139200,,293,5.3478260869565215
3475948,5,B001AYWY68,"I have had multiple sclerosis for years and while I get around just fine I have limited tolerance for exercise.  Yoga, with its emphasis on gentle stretch, posture, balance and breathing is perfect for anyone with a limited capacity for exercise.  The only downside was having to travel to participate in a class, since I no longer drive and had to rely on my wonderful husband for transportation.  I was glad to find this excellent DVD and have been using it faithfully several times a week.  The exercises are clearly demonstrated, well-paced and enjoyable.",1227052800,,559,4.914893617021277

3475950,5,B001AYWY68,"This video comes in two parts:  morning and evening routines.  Either one will draw serenity into your practice and into your life.

As a beginner, I find plenty of challenge in these two practices, especially in the breathing practices.  I found reversing my usual way of breathing (expanding the back rather than the front while inhaling) difficult.  This particular exercise causes me to focus tightly on my breath, and by the time I'm finished I'm both invigorated and soooooo relaxed!

As a beginner, I cannot say whether advanced yoga students will benefit as much as I have from these videos, but I can say that anyone will experience relaxation from the practice, from the setting (gorgeous), and from the music. After just over a month of practice, I can see significant changes in my body and in my outlook on life.

I highly recommend this DVD.",1226793600,,855,4.815068493150685

3475952,5,B001AYWY68,"The two 30-minute Yoga practices on this DVD are basic but complete, allowing for a reasonable practice in a short time.  The AM is the more rigorous of the two.  The PM practice is largely a gentle series of stretches.

The first 2-4 minutes of the DVD are surprisingly basic, but it then moves into a smoother pacing.

Video editing and quality are high, filmed in a pretty outdoor setting with an attractive practitioner.  The narrator speaks softly and clearly and is not distracting.  The soundtrack is pleasantly yoga-esque.

Like most such DVDs, repetition limits the reusability of the routine.  I see something like this as useful to refresh your practice when you aren't participating in studio sessions, or to encourage yoga during hectic periods of life.  I could see taking this DVD with me on travel, a time when I most miss (and most need) my yoga practice.

I don't think this is a good standalone practice for yoga beginners since it doesn't explore the nuances or background of the practice.  But it's an excellent choice to augment your beginning practice or to keep you yoga-healthy on your trips.",1225152000,4,1117,4.826315789473684
3475953,5,B001AYWY68,"I love the AM and PM sets on this DVD.  It's the type of exercise program that will get you motivated with the AM set of exercises and will help you to relax with the PM set of exercises.  Each set is 30 minutes in length, and you can combine the two for a full gear up and cool down yoga set.

This is good for beginners and a good refresher for those who have already started on the path of yoga. The stretches and poses are gentle and fluid, no matter how exercises deficient (or agile) you are.

The AM set's goal is to invigorate, strengthen, and revitalize with gentle repetitions, yoga breathing, and simple poses with modifications included.

Poses inlude Mountain Pose, Downward Dog, Child's Pose, Plank Pose, and Twisted Lunge in the Vinyasa tradition.  The flow of these poses helps to energize the body with oxygen, not to mention the scenery is amazing while going through the poses.

The PM set's goal is to relax, unwind, and dissolve stress using the same Vinyasa flow with Warrior Poses and Sun Salutation Practice, as well.

This DVD is wonderful for the total sensory experience...okay, other than the taste factor, but it's great to open up the muscles and let the day's stressors just fall away.",1224720000,,1216,4.597222222222222

As a fitness instructor myself, I truly appreciate Elena Brower's calming voice, clean instruction, and impeccable demonstration of basic yoga moves...along with modifications for people who can't perform the exact poses themselves.  In today's stressful world, doing the AM routine every morning is a great way to energize and invigorate yourself and the PM routine at night, with its two moving meditations designed to harmonize body and breathing, is a wonderful way to release tension and stress -- even better than warm milk and cookies!",1224374400,,641,5.153846153846154
3475957,4,B001AYWY68,"I haven't done yoga in a few years, not that I was ever advanced, so it was nice to get back into it.  This was a good introduction, it had alot of basic poses, a nice background and a knowledgeable instructor. I do wish there were shorter versions of the work outs available on the DVD.  I'm not a morning person, so I don't think I'll be getting up early on work days to do 30-40 minutes of yoga, maybe I'll fit it in on weekends.  Also, the instruction is done in a voice over, I prefer when the instructors actually talk to you while doing it, but that's just me.  Overall, I think it's a solid place to start or re-start if you're thinking about it.",1224115200,,654,4.125984251968504
3475958,4,B001AYWY68,"This is the 2nd Element beginner-oriented yoga DVD I've reviewed and I found it similar to the first one.  Same beautiful ocean view backdrop with nice relaxing music and Elena doing the instruction.  This one is divided into ""AM"" and ""PM"" segments, which are for morning and evening routines.  The lesson flows rather quickly, so if you are just learning you may need to do some pauses and rewinds to help yourself follow along with the poses properly.  This DVD isn't that long, and again I think they could put more lessons on the disk to give users more value.  Generally I found this a pleasant instructional DVD with a good teacher and a nice selection of background scenery and music to support yoga practice.",1224115200,,716,4.696
3475959,4,B001AYWY68,"I have always been interested in learning the art of YOGA because of its stress relieving properties. While the video is quite good, the person is in perfect body fitness and conditioning and while the exercises she shares seem easy, when I tried to do them it was difficult for me.

The routine is filmed at a beautiful location, overlooking the sea, and surrounded by a beautiful garden. Since I was playing this in my living room, the contrast of my surroundings was startling, and I guess that after we become proficient and are able to do this outside by the pool, the perspective may improve.

We have done a few sets this week, and have begun to look forward to the repetition because it gets easier as the days go by. Would highly recommend this as a beginning step, but look forward to an ability to do by myself, outside, where the setting will definitely improve our ability to remove stress from our daily lives.",1224115200,,924,4.5602409638554215

Each pose has a few alternatives, so it's easy to tailor the instruction for you. I thought the PM stretching routine was especially good.",1224115200,,350,4.223880597014926
3475961,3,B001AYWY68,"This, my first yoga video experience, has been a very satisfying one. The video is a little over 60 minutes long and is geared primarily for beginners like myself. There are two parts to it: a morning routine and an evening routine.
I liked the morning routines as I am much more of a morning than an evening yoga-`person'. The morning routine teaches very basic poses of stretching, bending and exercising the muscles gently and in my opinion is a great experience.
With the nightly routines, I felt a bit more stretched as the poses there exercise different body muscles.

I like the sounds in this video, but could recommend more Theta-waved geared music for the nightly exercises.",1224115200,5,684,4.796610169491525
3475962,4,B001AYWY68,"I am a moderately experienced yoga practitioner, but I still found a lot to like in this DVD.
Beautiful setting, a talented, beautiful instructor and soothing music make for a very centering experience.  Is it written somewhere that most yoga videos need to be shot in Hawaii?  Hahahaha.

Yes, the routines are fairly basic, but they a challenging enough for advanced practitioners as well. The first few sessions you will probably need to watch more than exercise as many movements require taking your eyes off the screen.  But only for brief periods and the learning curve is low.

The morning session last just over half an hour, and while you won't get out of breath, I do perspire and feel very relaxed and alert afterwards.  The many downward facing dog poses really stretch the legs and back and get the blood flowing.  I found the pace a bit slow, others find it fast, so that aspect is really subjective.  All the while Elena talks you through it and she explains things very well.

The PM session is even more mellow and perfect for before bed.  The predominance of seated poses keep you from raising the heart rate too much.  Lost in the moves, the 28 minute session is over before you know it. Afterwards I am loose and relaxed and ready to hit the pillow.

I recommend a yoga mat for the AM routine, but you don't really need it for the PM version.  Wear comfortable clothing, but not too loose as some poses will have your shirt bunching up around your face.  I would definitely recommend this DVD to beginners, as well as Elena's excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Element-Yoga-for-Beginners/dp/B000WC38B4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Element: Yoga for Beginners</a>.
