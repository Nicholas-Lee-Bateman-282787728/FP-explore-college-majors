2189609,4,B0006J288W,"I have a two year old girl and this dvd is just long enough for her to stay interested, but not too long to bore her.  Being 8 cartoons - it's not the biggest set out there, and I'll probably buy the big set as soon as I finish this comment, but It's good for a little one if you're not wanting to spend $30 on a big set.  Now that I know there's a bigger set out there, and I'm a Duck fan, I'll get it.  This is a good dvd to put on before dinner to keep her occupied - and, by the time dinner's ready, she's settled down and ready to eat.",1120348800,10,540,3.6782608695652175
2189610,4,B0006J288W,"It's too bad it didn't come out for the holidays because it would have made a great grab-bag gift. For $10, you only get 8 cartoons, but for someone like myself who is a Donald Duck fan, it's nice to watch this whenever I need a good laugh.  Today's cartoons are much too violent.  It's nice to see something clean.",1106092800,14,315,4.233333333333333
2189611,4,B0006J288W,"This DVD includes 8 Donald Duck shorts. However, all but two of these: Inferior Decorators and Bee at the Beach are already included on the Chronological Donald Volume 1 Disney Treasures Set.  I guess that Disney is just trying to get something out that's a little less costly but you can get the Treasures Sets for around $25 to $30 and get so much more.  The Donald set comes with 36 shorts AND bonus features, so you are getting much more bang for your buck.

This collection is a rather broad range of tunes from 1937 up to 1950.  Donald's Vacation and Don Donald are probably the two best shorts on the disc.  None are really classics but they are all pretty good.  I'd still say spend the extra bucks and get the Chronological Donald volume 1 if you are REALLY a Donald fan.

Inferior Decorator 1948 - Spike the Bee doesn't understand why he can't get pollen out of Donald's new flowered wallpaper.

Don Donald 1937 - Don Donald rides over to Donna's place on a donkey that drives him nuts. He entertains Donna (later known as Daisy); until she hops on to the donkey for a little ride and gets thrown off it's back into a fountain.

Golden Eggs 1941 - With the price of eggs are going up, Donald decides to sell his hen's eggs and get rich but  ends up having a hard time harvesting eggs from the henhouse, so he goes in disguise as a rooster to get them.

Bee at the Beach 1950 - Donald and Spike the Bee in another conflict, this time a fight over limited space at the beach.

Donalds Dog Laundry - 1940 - Donald Duck builds an automated dog washer he dubs the ""Modern Dog Washer"". A handy Pluto naps nearby, so Donald decides to use him as his test subject

Donald's Vacation 1940 - Donald decides to go kayaking in the great outdoors. But when he gets there, he finds the animals of the forest are less than co-operative.

Old Macdonald Duck 1941 - Donald enjoys a day on his farm in his version of the classic children's song

Chef Donald 1941 - Donald decides to try cooking along with a radio show. He tries to make waffles, but accidentally spills some rubber cement into the batter.",1105401600,68,2097,4.354755784061696

Definitely thought there'd be other cartoons that I remembered, but fun just the same. Glad I found a deal on a used copy for $6. Some of these are going for $100 on Amazon!

2189633,5,B0006J288W,These Classic Cartoon Favorites by Walt Disney are cartoons from back during the years between about 1935 and 1950. There so loved and bought up so fast when you can find one for sale that it makes them very collectable and therefor quite valuable. A brand new copy of this title can sell for anywhere from $40.00 to $60.00 dollars. CAN YOU HANDLE PAYING THAT KIND OF MONEY FOR A CARTOON DVD?,1400284800,,392,4.458333333333333

2189638,5,B0006J288W,This is a great dvd with the classic Donald Duck shows. Only wish there were more episodes on the dvd. With only 8 episodes the dvd is a little expensive but if money doesn't bother you then it's worth the price.,1358640000,,212,4.195121951219512
2189639,4,B0006J288W,"If you love old Disney cartoons, then DVDs in this series are excellent choices. The animation is great--much better than today's sterile look. Since the cartoons are so old (probably from the late 1930s and into the 1940s, the disks produce a grainy picture. But it's not too grainy to detract from the experience, especially if you're watching the cartoons with a little grandchild. I did buy the Classic Cartoon Favorites, Vol. 1 - Starring Mickey, and it was defective. I had to return, but I received a refund.",1354838400,,515,4.797752808988764

I read all these reviews complaining that these cartoons are available on the ""Treasures"", but the truth is these are good DVDs that serve a different function. I own all the ""Treasures"" DVDs because I am a animation fan and I believe all ""hard core"" fans know they need to get the ""Treasures"", but I also own all of the ""Classic Cartoon Favorites"" DVDs. I and my older children (12 and up) watch the ""Treasures"" DVDs and the whole family especially my small children (2 and up) enjoy the ""Classic Cartoon Favorites"". They are both good!!! So if you want disney cartoon classics, but are not ""hare core"" go ahead and buy this video these cartoons are great!",1238198400,4,683,4.60655737704918
