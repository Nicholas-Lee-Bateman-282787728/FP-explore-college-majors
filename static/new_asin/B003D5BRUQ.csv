8394677,3,B003D5BRUQ,"Valley of the Wolves (Turkish: Kurtlar Vadisi) is a Turkish prime time TV series that ran from 2003 to 2005. A particularly interesting (notorious?) episode was titled Kurtlar Vadisi: Irak, which purported to be the true story of a Turkish special forces unit humiliated by American troops in the early 2000s. The hero's subsequent efforts to avenge his brother and redeem Turkish honor featured some really nasty American villains (but it is entirely unrelated to the original series). This specific offering allegedly is a 13 disc compilation of a Turkish secret agent's adventures in bringing down the Turkish mafia. Be that as it may, the item I bought under this same title is a single disc featuring the major character's unsuccessful struggle against double-dealing Turks subservient to some kind of global conspiracy: Gladio. Much of the plot is not very realistic (to an American's eyes), but it is certainly dramatic (and messy). What you might receive is a mystery (and supposedly not playable on US machines). My disc worked fine, the female lead was quite attractive, and I am at a complete loss why the Turkish authorities (both in real life and in the movie) would permit the detailed recitation of a long list of Turkish public and private failings. Note: An equivalent expose of social and political failings is the Italian crime series: The Octopus. The hero(s) in both series come to disappointing ends.
Second note: I would appreciate any information that expands or corrects the above information.",1314576000,,1518,5.100401606425703
