I would also like to say how I very much appreciate the fact that in the DVD Mike thanks his audience for purchasing the DVD and for taking time to view the DVD.  I don't think I have ever seen anyone say something so nice to his customers.  Thank you Mike.

This is a good basic DVD on starting to learn Equine Massage on Muscles.  I know that there was one particular reviewer that really said negative things about the DVD and indicated that the horses didn't get releases like the Masterson Method does.  Obviously the reviewer doesn't seem to understand that they are two very different modalities.  Masterson Method is more energy based and Mike Scott's method is as the DVD said the Basic Principles of Equine Massage Muscle and Tendon therapy.  The only thing that I think that Mike could have been improved on in the DVD is better colors and markers on the horses body other than that it's a very nice DVD to own.  I have both Mikes DVD and Masterson's DVD and they are a must have for anyone that wants to help their horse feel better.",1386374400,,1071,4.3686868686868685

8061776,5,B0009J25RS,This DVD is clear and easy to understand. The editing flows smoothly and really helps you when trying to learn the massage techniques. I also bought the book of the same title and it really does bring the whole experience to life.,1182902400,2,230,4.5
8061777,5,B0009J25RS,"High level overview and touches on many of the basic techniques for horse massage.

This is great for people that want to learn for massaging their own horse or those looking to get into the field and want to see what it is like.",1182643200,2,229,4.204545454545454
