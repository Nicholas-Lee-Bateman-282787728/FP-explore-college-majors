I am reviewing the content based on how beneficial this would be for a beginner, not for what I really think about it.  I made the mistake of not taking the product description to heart.  I don't consider myself to be an artist, but my skills are way above this DVD; I will not pass judgment on it because of my error.

With that said, for someone new to drawing, the technique for teaching a new student is well thought out.  He starts with simple shapes, lines and curves, and progresses onto more complex drawings, still using simple shapes, allowing for a great sense of accomplishment after just a few lessons.

The materials used are paper and felt tip pen.  Imagination is a plus.

During the lesson, fast forward action is used to progress through repetitive parts of the drawing; this is not overused but is helpful.  At the end of each lesson, there is a review of the process, all done in fast forward.

Now, on a technical side, I will air my thoughts.  The accompanying music is enough to make me hit the mute button.  I'm a fan of guitar, but only when it's well done.  The other thing is that the video was obviously shot in someones house.  You can hear the sounds of pots and pans clanking together, water running and people talking.  The artist is obviously not working from a script because he tends to ramble, repeating himself over and over again.  After hearing him comment that he could abandon the picture and move on many, many times, I hit the mute button and watched the rest of the lesson in silence.

Bottom line -

Educational content - 5 stars
Technical content - 1 star",1296518400,3,1668,4.466887417218543
8344203,5,B001ULDJY2,"I definitely recommend this DVD for insightful instruction on opening up your drawing creativity.  I don't have any formal drawing training and it helped me wrap my mind around creating a piece of art with pen and paper.  It's a very meditative video, as far as the speed and ease with which the instructor speaks.  Not to mention the nice guitar accompaniment :)  It's easy to follow along and make your own drawings as he makes his.  I imagine this would be really great for kids maybe in middle school, pretty much anyone who needs some inspiration to draw.",1236729600,7,560,4.616161616161616
