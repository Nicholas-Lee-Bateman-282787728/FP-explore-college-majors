8186223,5,B000OQ7PSU,"You could say that this DVD is the definintion of intense. Black and white, in the true Animal style, it showcases the giant Wrath on a normal arm day. The DVD lasts about 31 minutes, he runs through Standing BB Curls, Alternating DB Curls, Machine Preacher Curls, BB Wrist Curls, Rope Pushdowns, Close Grip Bench, Skull Crushers, and Straight Bar Pushdowns.

Wrath never looks at the camera, and never speaks a word. He is in the gym for business. The mofo is huuuge and is moving around a LOT of weight (the music kicks in for his heavy sets, instrumental, prolly classify it at as metal music), for example he does close grip bench with 405, skull crushers with 2 plates on each side, 155 lb BB curls with perfect form, and I think he's doing DB curls with 80's. It's quite motivating... a great training DVD",1316822400,,811,4.517006802721088
8186224,1,B000OQ7PSU,wow... this has got to be the least useful video for learning bodybuilding techniques I've ever come across.  The production is poor... the techniques shown (not even talked about as there was no narration) are things that EVERY serious weight lifter / bodybuilder should already be doing in the gym... my girlfriend says it's just a fetish video for people that like muscles and I have to agree with her.  I'm sad that I spent the $10... I thought I would be getting something informative and educational!,1248307200,,506,4.804597701149425
