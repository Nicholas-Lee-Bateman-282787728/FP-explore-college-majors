It is true that once you start watching, it's hard to stop.

Because it is so good it seems churlish to offer criticism. But, two things stood out. There always seems to be a minute where there is just music and someone crying, I tended to fast forward through this bit. The other thing is that the English subtitles are woeful, they are written in pigeon English and occassionaly disappear too quickly. However, this doesn't spoil the programme, you can get a lot just from the visuals, though I did find myself trying (and failing) to learn Korean.",1290038400,,785,4.807407407407408

8270651,5,B0018Q7JXQ,"After watching Jewel In The Palace (Dae Jang Geum) my Korean drama adventure had begun. Yi San was my second stop on this adventure and
I was not disapointed. This story is about a King in the 1800's who fought for the people of his nation through thick and thin and never gave up, even after many assasination attempts. This series has it all, suspense,romance,comedy,action,,mystery and so forth. This series was actually suppose to only go 50 episodes, but because of the overwelming demand and love for the series it continued for 77 episodes.
Each episode is 1 hour long, meaning this is a 77 HOUR movie. I spent some days staying up late just so i could see the outcome of events only wanting to watch more and more. It's that addicting.",1266278400,8,743,4.593984962406015
8270652,5,B0018Q7JXQ,"This is a really don't miss Korean Epic Legend, beautifully filmed drama. Customes are superb with beautiful design and color. Quality of the DVD pictures are outstanding similar to HD quality.
Story and portrayal of actors are very realistic.
I have watched a few Korean TV Series such as JUMONG, JEWEL IN THE PALACE, LEGEND of Four Gods, this film is up there if not better.
Sit back, relax and dedicate at least 3hrs because you just can't watch just 1 episode, you will long for more, guaranteed! My wife and I were sad after we saw the last episode of Vol. I, we should get the rest of the Volume this week I hope. Happy viewing, fans...",1213920000,11,642,4.4491525423728815
