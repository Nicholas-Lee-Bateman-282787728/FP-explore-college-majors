I enjoyed the video extra of his interview for the part, too.  The other actors did a super job and I found myself liking all the characters right away.  This series had good writing and emotionally involved me in the story.  Well done!",1389398400,,376,4.225352112676056
3140069,5,B00153NOOU,"Well, I'm SO pleased David Tennant achieved great fame as Dr Who, as undoubtedly it was THIS which caused the long overdue release of this wonderful 6 episode series to DVD. I was gripped by this when it was broadcast, due to the marriage of a wonderful script by Donna Franceschild, and a chock-full batch of brave and gritty performances. Franceschild had previously written for some of the small scale political theatre groups. She manages social content and a serious message whilst using all the tools of entertainment skilfully.

The young David Tennant is brilliant in a large, on the edge of going over the top but never doing so, performance of a young man with Bipolar disorder. The performances which really hung in my memory over the years though were Ken Stott's bruised, messy, alcoholic - in many ways less sane, outside the asylum, than some of the inside the asylum characters, particularly the wonderful Angus McFaddyen's schizophrenic Fergus (this is the second performance which stayed with me) - beautifully restrained, full of depth, breaks your heart - and then there is the wonderful Katy Murphy as lacerated, self-harming Francine. Ruth McCabe is beautifully low key as a woman with OCD and there's even a delicious performance by Elisabeth Spriggs, looking eerily like a fatter, older Meryl Streep as Stott's Lithuanian grandmother.

At the time, the series won a BAFTA for best series, and Franceschild an award for her wonderful script, so the release to DVD was well overdue!

Cracking drama, inventive, great soundtrack - it's set in a hospital radio studio, after all, sparkling humour, and break your heart painful emotions. Like life, there are winners and losers in the story lines, and there's little which would satisfy Hollywood in their endings, but they are RIGHT.

As others have mentioned, viewers THIS side of the pond will need a Region 2 (Europe) DVD Player to watch this, though some tech savvy people have said this is watchable on newer PCs and lappies, and can even then be played on that but viewed, via HDML cable through your TV. By all accounts the region 2 players are DIRT cheap (I think, over MY side of the pond Region 1 players are not so dirt cheap!)",1388275200,3,2208,4.86436170212766
3140070,5,B00153NOOU,"Takin' Over the Asylum is a heart-wrenching series set against the very real issue of mental health care.  It takes this universally ignored population of people and opens our eyes to them through some very broken, but completely sympathetic characters.  David Tennant, who is cast as a manic-depressive teen named Campbell Bain, befriends an outsider named Eddie, a ne'er do well window salesman who always wanted to be a disc jockey.  Eddie happens upon the asylum by accident when his volunteer radio station at a hospital is closed down for budget reasons and the asylum is presented as his only option.  He takes to the task reluctantly, but through Campbell's enthusiasm and some help from a couple of other patients, the station begins to take on a life of its own and inspires several of the asylum's residents to new heights.  There are some very comedic moments throughout the series; however, the overall message is not lost through humor.  It is devastatingly real in its portrayal of the mental health system in general, and the actors do it such amazing justice.  If you haven't already got a universal DVD player, this series is one very good reason to spend the money.",1374883200,,1184,4.8606965174129355
3140071,5,B00153NOOU,"This is one of the few David Tennant works I have been unable to acquire without ordering from overseas, so I was bummed to have to. But it's also one of the ones I've most wanted to see, so I placed my order and was further disappointed to find that it was estimated to take a month to arrive, due to it being shipped from Australia and I live in the US. I bought it anyways (July 10th), as my birthday present to myself, and it was slated to arrive in early to mid August, right before my birthday. Well, you can imagine how shocked and excited I was to discover it in my mailbox only a week later! The DVD player I had bought to play it on I have to go buy a longer AV cord for, but I finally got it to work on my computer after adjusting some settings. Watched the whole show in one sitting, and it was fabulous. A beautiful portrayal of the subject matter with just the right touch of humor.",1374019200,,896,4.03932584269663

One thing to be aware of if you buy this, it is Region 2, so it will not play on standard U.S. DVD players.  I kept seeing that problem with different DVDs I wanted.  It finally occurred to me to check and I discovered that I could buy an All Region DVD player from Amazon, starting at less than $27!

3140074,5,B00153NOOU,"Extraordinary film,it's funny and tragic at the same time. Some parts are so funny I laughed myself sillly. Yet the film is also a tragic and engrossing look at the shameful state of mental health issues not only in Great Britian but the United States as well. The acting was superb and brillant,expecially that of the extraordinary David Tennant. Who was only 22 at the time and just out of drama school. David plays Campbell a patient in the mental hospital who learns to be a DJ from Eddie,who has come in to set up a radio station for the patients benefit. David has gone on to give the viewing public 20 years of extraordinary performances since then. Ken Stott was fabaliouse in this as Eddie a 38 year old somewhat down and out loser,who has always dreamed of being a professional DJ. But must live his daily life in a full time job that he hates,drinks too much, not married, and lives with his grandmother, and does DJ work at hopitals part time. When the big break comes it is for Campbell not Eddie. A added plus to this film is the 60's and 70's music. This is a region 2 disk, so you will need a multi region DVD player or play it on your computer. The only draw back is the film does not go the full width of the computer screen or tv screen, but you get use to it.",1366416000,,1279,4.245901639344262

8257284,5,B00153NOOU,"I am completely serious when I say that this relatively obscure little miniseries is one of my all-time favorite tv shows. From the superb cast to the thoughtful selection of sixties and seventies era music, every beat of this show is perfect. The performances by (a very young) David Tennant, Ken Stott, and Katy Murphy are sublime under David Blair's brilliant direction. I couldn't take my eyes off them.

The entire cast is just extraordinary.  David Tennant, in his first starring role, is astonishing as Campbell Bain, a young man struggling to deal not only with bipolar disorder but with the pressure by a concerned father to grow up and become a responsible adult.  The story primarily tells of the journey of struggling radio DJ (and disgruntled double glazing salesman) Eddie McKenna (Ken Stott) who befriends Campbell, a teen-aged patient at St. Jude's  mental hospital after Eddie agrees to start up a defunct radio station at St. Jude's.  Eddie inspires Campbell to learn the art of spinning records. It turns out Campbell is a natural and the two team up to try and get their own show on a ""real"" radio station. Campbell's enthusiasm is infectious and soon several other patients are involved.

Along the way, Eddie meets and falls in love with Francine, played by the wonderful Katy Murphy, who has deep-seated issues from her childhood which cause her to be ""sectioned"" by the courts repeatedly for harming herself. They are joined by Rosalie (Ruth McCabe), a woman with obsessive compulsive disorder, who, along with her husband, is struggling with marital problems and losses of their own, and Fergus (Angus Macfadyen) a brilliant young man with schizophrenia who struggles to be taken seriously by those who can't see past his illness. The hospital radio program touches the lives of many of the patients who come together to keep the station going when the realities of resource allocation threaten to end it.

The attention given even to minor characters is remarkable. Elizabeth Spriggs is delightful as Eddie's grandmother. Mary MacLeod is wonderful as the misunderstood Nana who is hospitalized after she is found living rough on the streets. Angela Bruce and Kenneth Bryans are terrific as the primary hospital caregivers. And I haven't even mentioned Eddie's co-workers at the double glazing firm!

The story is told truthfully, with humor, compassion, and anguish. Donna Franceschild has revealed that the characters and their stories were based in part on her own experiences with mental health challenges and the mental health industry. This, and immense talent, helps to explain the depth and nuance she gives, not only to the lead characters, but many of the ""second-line loonies"". Her script has since been adapted for the stage, as well.

I was delighted after purchasing the DVD to discover there are two insightful and entertaining commentary tracks which were recorded fifteen years later, featuring the now famous David Tennant, along with Katy Murphy and Donna Franceschild, and audition footage (to David Tennant's apparent consternation).

I purchased an all-region DVD player in order to watch this and many other quality projects which are only available on region 2 disks. Absolutely worth the investment.",1409961600,5,3249,5.148007590132828
