7918429,5,B00003ETJR,"This Warren Buffett presentation is must viewing especially for college age students, although everyone can benefit from it. Warren delivers sage advice on how to become financially successful, and he does it in a witty and entertaining way. His views on debt alone are worth the price of the video. Warren Buffett offers an approach to financial success rather than a check list. He personally has walked the walk, and here he talks the talk. He is selling nothing, but he gives the viewer everything. I wish this video had been available when I was beginning on life's path.",1083456000,2,576,4.828282828282828
7918430,4,B00003ETJR,"For those of you who haven't heard him speak, most of you will be surprised by his easy going and down to earth nature and his humors! He is an happy individual and has a humorous and entertaining way whenever he chooses to tell us his anecdotes on a business deal or his business decisions.
In terms of what you'll get out of it: You'll learn about the type of individuals who he feels are top CEOs materials; you'll learn about what he values most in life; you'll be amazed at how ""uncomplicated"" Mr Buffet is.
Mind you, if you are looking at deep investment insights or his secret method, you won't find any. That, you'll have to find it in his letters to his shareholders on his company's website.",1077062400,3,701,4.4
7918431,5,B00003ETJR,"Excellent video taped at UNC. Buffett is actually speaking to a bunch of business school students and gives his insights in stock trading (actually stock buying, he rarely sells stocks). He views buying stocks as being an owner of the company and he reasons if a company is excellent then why should you sell it. You hear Buffett's typical and very wise advice in investing ( which seems to be merger of Graham's and Fisher's philosophy, with his on twist): look for excellent companies (Graham) with excellent managers(Fisher) and buy at a fair, or better yet, cheap price (Buffett).",1076371200,,584,4.909090909090909
7918432,4,B00003ETJR,"The title of this review pretty much says it all. Warren Buffett presents his thoughts on investing well, delivering each point with a quip or two sure to make you laugh. But, the tape is over as soon as it begins--and you have not really learned anything new. (Not if you have read one of the many books on or letters by Mr. Buffett at least.)",1049155200,10,344,4.2272727272727275
