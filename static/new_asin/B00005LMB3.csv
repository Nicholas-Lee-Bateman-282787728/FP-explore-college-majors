7943999,4,B00005LMB3,"One thousand ears ago a great sorcerer named Enno Ozuno battled the forces of evil using a bracelet to control a tenacious fighting demon named Zenki. Fearful of Zenki's power , he sealed the demon in a statue in the back of shrine just before he passed away.
 A thousand years later evil Master Karuma and her three demonic servants are trying it again. She sends out 108 'Seeds of Posesion', which take advantage of people's desires and twist them into something nasty (or nastier). When Enno Chiaki is attacked at her shrine by a couple of henchmen, she frees Zenki, unknowing of his power. All seems lost at first, but Chiaki figures out to retyrn Zenki to his true form, a tall, musuclar bishie with an attitude. But then you discover that Zenki would love nothing more to kill Chiaki and be free. Nope. Not gonna happen, not while Chiaki has the guardian bracelet anyway. So, Chiaki, go find the seeds of evil! The story progresses and gets more advanced, more demons are added, and a big rival too. The picture is very nice, but the dubbing cuts out anything inappropriate or religious. Watch it subititled when you get this.
  The OP themes are done by Kageyama Hironobou, the singer who did most of the music for DBZ, as it's all very nice. I love the seond OP, ' Demon Lord Zenki, Welcome the Dead'! DO buy this. I can't wait to buy the second saga!!",1029024000,3,1360,4.497975708502024
7944000,5,B00005LMB3,I have purchased 5 copies of Zenki Saga 1.  Every copy has a flaw on disc number 2.  The english dialogue goes out at certain points during disc play.  This happens at the same instant on each disc I have tried.  I have returned 4 copies to Amazon.com.  I purchased another copy from another store.  This copy is also flawed.  I must say that I hated the voices for the English Dialogue anyway.  Zenki is very annoying and sounds nothing like his Japanese counterpart.  Stick with Japanese with subtitles for this one.  It totally ruins the series for me in English.  I don't know if anyone else has experienced this problem with disk number 2?  I have attempted to email Anime Works about this problem three times.  I have recieved no response.  Buyer beware!,1018224000,3,760,4.574626865671642
7944001,4,B00005LMB3,"Since others cover the story contents and such well enough, you don't need me to go on about it. ;p However, there is one thing I didn't see mentioned anywhere. Now, I saw the subtitled eps on VHS and it was love at first site. It's simply a fun series. When it came out on DVD, I was one of the first to grab one and was surprised to find the series had also been dubbed. ooo... Though I've learned from experience that to watch an English dub of an Anime is most usually dangerous to your sanity, I gamely gave it a go to test out the DVD since I'd already seen the subtitled version. Well, the dub isn't too bad, but I do have one major gripe and felt warning others was in order: The dub voice used for the child Zenki is horrible and really ruined it for me. I constantly found myself gritting my teeth. I suppose it's endurable, but I recommend people new to the series watch the subtitled first or risk being turned off by that ill-fitting and grating voice.",1013558400,5,965,4.193548387096774
7944002,5,B00005LMB3,"The Zenki series is a wonderful take on the shonen manga.  Here we have all the staples of a good anime action show; magic spells, a young pretty girl, two bad budist monks and a wise cracking demon trying to kill his mistress. . .
Okay, so its not your average action show, but Zenki with his smart as attitude and the wise cracking of the intire cast, plus the well timed use of panty jokes makes it all worth while.  After all who wouldn't like a series where the heroien is force to seal the fridge from her gardiuan demon to keep him from eating them out of house and home?  Then watch that same demon don a *female* students uniform to steal her lunch at school!
Zenki is a bag of laughs and action, a great buy for any anime fan.  ^-^",1005350400,2,741,4.125
7944003,4,B00005LMB3,"Since '96, after it's first 13 episodes were released then dropped by Software Sculptors ( like Utena ), fans of this series, Kishin Douji Zenki, have been dying to sink their fangs into the the many more episodes of this juicily colorful tale of a demon lord named Zenki fighting evil under the control of a teenage Shinto priestess named Chiaki ENNO ( her name is NOT Chiaki Ozuno as it says on the summary. Japanese put the last name first and someone somewhere got Enno Ozuno mixed up with Enno Chiaki. I hope its not translated like that. The also are mistaking when they say that she found a stone monument. It's there the whole time in plain site and obviously everyone knows the story behind it.)The story is unique and the artwork is colorful. The demon lord Zenki is controlled by Chiaki's magic bracelet that turns him into a wimpy little child form and then back into his kick-butt true self when evil shows up. It's one of the most popular anime shows in Central and South America ( if that counts for something. ) The story in the beginning does get a bit repitious though, but if you hang in there, it gets better, especially after episode 13 ( and 13 episodes are on this disc ! a bargain ! ) So go out there and check it out everyone ! It's a definite winner ! Haven't got the dvd yet myself, but I can't wait ! I hope the dubbing doesn't ruin it, but the Japanese actors ( Kappei Yamaguchi, Chisa Yokoyama, Megumi Ogata, and Juurouta Kosugi ) are the perfect combination !",996624000,13,1490,4.382671480144404
7944004,5,B00005LMB3,"This anime was relesed a few years back over here, and so I've forgotten most of the details. But the main part about this DVD(I think) Is about a girl who accidentally releases a demon called Zenki...except that he's not the visage of terror you'd expect. He looks just like an ordinary boy. Anyway, the girl can revert him to his demon form(seen on the cover)pretty much the same way Cardcaptor Sakura does to her cards. I give this 5 stars for my own fond memories of it, though Zenki keeps getting mashed in his face by his master(the girl).",996537600,,545,4.46
7944005,5,B00005LMB3,"Part action, part comedy, all fun!
""Long ago"" a great demon lord was bound by magic/sorcery to a monk in order to fight the forces of darkness. After the monk died, generations passed and the demon slept.  However, 55 generations after Enno Ozuno passed away, the evil generals  under the god, Karma, attack the world with their ""demon  seeds.""
Chiaki Ozuno is the lucky (??) teenage girl to inherit the  possession of the demon lord. She uses her semi-effective (well, almost  useless) powers to awaken the great lord - only he isn't so  ""great."" What's a girl to do when she has monsters breathing down  her pretty neck and a two-foot tall arrogant demon shrimp ignoring her  orders? If Chiaki can't figure out how to awaken Zenki's true powers, then  the world is doomed before she can even finish high school!
Chiaki and  Zenki stay at each other's throats in this hillarious yet action-packed  series. Zenki makes fun of Chiaki's imcompetence as a sorceress while she  plays punt-the-runt around the temple. A definite ""must-see"" for  anime fans, or for anyone who enjoys a good animated comedy!",928108800,,1100,4.849462365591398
