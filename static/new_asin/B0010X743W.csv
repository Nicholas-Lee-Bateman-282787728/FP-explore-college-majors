8238988,4,B0010X743W,"This film, Sharpshooter, seems to overachieve in a noticed way. While officially listed as a ""Not Rated"" film, rest assured that it plays out exactly like a current day PG-13 movie (mid level violence, small handful of basic cuss words, no actual nudity, etc). While not ""perfect"", this film is definitely entertaining in a way that quite a few larger budget flicks fail to grasp. The story, while predictable, is very well detailed and properly played out. The actors involved are all very seasoned, with James Remar taking the lead with the primary character role (and also offering an effective narration throughout the story as it unfolds). Mario Van Peebles does a nice job with his given role, and Bruce Boxleitner is very reliable and textbook perfect in portraying an overly proactive law enforcement officer. 80's era Sci-Fi princess Catherine Mary Stewart just never really seems to age. And, she once again looks spectacular in this film, especially with those snug jeans, all while delivering an effective performance. While somewhat fantastical, the story is explained in enough detail to hold your attention and seems reasonably believable for the given setting. The pacing for the film is very nice and even keeled, and plays out at approximately an hour and a half.

Regarding the actual production quality, Sharpshooter does very well with the aspect of actual filming techniques, camera angles, lighting in all types of scenarios, and the visible picture quality on screen. Obviously filmed with high quality, high definition cameras, the picture is vibrantly colorful, highly contrasting, and razor sharp. On a scale of 1 through 10, the on screen picture quality is a solid ""9"". This aspect of strong picture quality was very welcomed, and somewhat unexpected (as I've watched other RHI releases that have picture quality more along the rating of a 5 or 6, similar to an Echo Bridge movie). So, once again, the picture quality is abnormally strong for a lower budget, B-Grade action movie.

Regarding the soundtrack for the movie, there are some noticed flaws. While the actual dialogue is well amplified and crystal clear in sound quality, some brilliant sound mix tech thought that it would be a great idea to add some overly ""thumpy"" instrumental background music at some of the most inappropriate time intervals (and it seems to last throughout far too much of the film). I happen to use a really good sound system, and this ""thumpy"" background music effect creates an unnecessary, slightly distorted resonance which I simply wouldn't have in 99 out of 100 random movies. While this situation is more of an annoyance than an actual problem, it could have been easily avoided. This issue with the soundtrack is the singular most glaring and hindering trait, which causes you to remember that you are in fact watching a lower budget B-Grade film. Perhaps, it should be considered a positive aspect, that the soundtrack is this films weakest link!!!

Sharpshooter is a lower budget, B-Grade film with solid acting, seasoned known stars, and an entertaining well paced action story. Most persons who would watch it, would likely come away with a very satisfied and positive impression. This movie can be purchased at a ridiculously low price, either being ""New"" or in good ""Used"" condition.

If you're looking for an entertaining, cheap, B-Grade action flick, . . . give ""Sharpshooter"" a look.

8238994,2,B0010X743W,"2 of 5 stars for the action-adventure movie Sharpshooter. Sigh, I had high expectations for this movie based on the trailer and the opening scenes. In the opening, a former CIA hitman is doing a hostage rescue from two high speed cars rolling thru a desert somewhere in the middle-east. Starting with only a high-power rifle, he starts the ambush. A very impressive setup and execution. From there it all went wrong. The hitman character is toally flat and 2-dimensional. Trying to achieve a rigid army-like character, the actor achieves a total boring, don't care, uninteresting character. Our hitman is talked into taking one more job before he retires. As he starts to plan the hit we get the feeling all is not right. Yep, after he hits the target, ""they"" will hit him. Frankly, the action ain't so good; the characters are bland and don't care. For a movie with potential, this turned out badly. Don't waste your time.",1256083200,,923,4.775
