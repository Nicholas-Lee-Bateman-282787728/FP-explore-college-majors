2853809,5,B000QXQ1KY,"Even if this is before you're time, you will enjoy this.  Bought this after I saw clips of Jack Paar on CNN's THE SIXTIES.  Even if this is before your time, these are people that you know to be important.  A very important documentation from the sixties.  An entertaining part of true history.",1408665600,,294,4.490566037735849
2853810,4,B000QXQ1KY,A good Paar show overview with good biography. Paar was good. So is this DVD. I recommend it to all TV comedy fans.,1400457600,2,115,4.043478260869565
2853811,5,B000QXQ1KY,"Ive owned this set for several years now and still enjoy watching it now and then. I didn't grow up with Paar, but came to appreciate him years later thanks to his appearances on Johnny Carson & Late Night With David Letterman. What a true talent Jack Paar was! I have no complaints with the set generally  the video quality could have been a bit better, perhaps, but considering this material is in some cases 50+ years old I think were lucky to have it at all! Whatever shape the source material is in, it certainly provides a pretty clear window onto a time that is now, sadly, long gone. Id thoroughly enjoy seeing more!",1392681600,3,624,4.426086956521739
2853812,5,B000QXQ1KY,It is a reminder of a time gone by when I watched the Jack Paar Show faithfully.  I enjoyed his humor and the many different guests he used to interview.  I miss him!!!,1389139200,,168,4.0606060606060606
2853813,5,B000QXQ1KY,"Jack Paar was(and still remains!) the undisputed ""czar"" of the late night talk show! His wit, timing, and mastery of this tv format still cause one to marvel. Jack's stunning ability to conduct entertaining and meaningful ""conversation"" with people of all backgrounds and stations of life is yet an unmatched wonder. The golden glow of this man's talent is still a great light beneath which all who have attempted to""follow in his exalted footsteps"" pale into...insignificance...",1367798400,3,479,5.315789473684211
2853814,5,B000QXQ1KY,"Jack Paar was a wonderful talk show host, and the guests in the interviews are intelligent and...so wonderfully polite.

After watching all the political rancor, it was so nice to pop in the interview disc and see democrats and republicans talking nicely about their opponents.

God, I miss civility.",1356566400,,300,5.1020408163265305
2853815,5,B000QXQ1KY,"Packaging for SHOUT FACTORY's 3-DVD set entitled THE JACK PAAR COLLECTION is deluxe. Each disc sits securely in a large, clear plastic tray. The first two flip like a book for easy access to all. The accompanying 16-page pamphlet is in easy-to-read print. It includes the ten-page Tom Shales essay ""Paar Excellence,"" six b&w photos and a detailed program list.

Transfer quality is generally fine. There are some excerpts that aren't as sharp visually, but only by degree. Audio of vintage b&w footage is typically lo-fi early '60s broadcast quality. The new commentary and intro portions are in color and have clean sound.

If you remember Jack's 90 minute TONIGHT show or his subsequent weekly one-hour JACK PAAR PROGRAM, this will be a pleasant trip back. Younger fans of classic era TV (also political history buffs) will find much of interest here as well.
Highly recommended!

8198215,5,B000QXQ1KY,Jack Paar was before my time but my Mother LOVED his show.  I've heard her talk about it for decades.  I got this set for Mother for Christmas. Everybody else left her house after the festivities and I stayed and watched this with her.  I had so much fun!  Now I see what she was talking about.  I'm glad I watched it and will definitely watch it again.  Very interesting documentary and great clips and segments of his show.  I was impressed and entertained.,1425081600,,459,4.392857142857143
