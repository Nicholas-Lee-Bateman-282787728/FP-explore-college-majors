8306880,5,B001GSTTSE,I really like this video.  Ive purchased a bunch with mixed results but this is one of the better ones....,1290643200,2,106,4.3
8306881,2,B001GSTTSE,"Although I read Kristi's (negative) review before buying this product, I decided to go ahead and buy it based on the other reviews, it really did seem good value.

However, I have to agree totally with Kristi and I really understand why she asked for a refund. Not sure what material Geraldine viewed or what link she has with the company, but I cannot agree that the material was ""awesome"" and that they did an ""excellent job in their production"".

The material, all of it, is of very poor quality, both in presentation and content. It looks like very old material rehashed.

The ""Basic Massage"" DVD is a recording of a therapist giving a massage. Unfortunately, in my view at least, if someone new to massage does not know which muscle is being massaged, in which direction, with which technique and to what purpose, it is very hard for them to periodically pause the presentation and meaningfully copy the activity shown in the DVD. There is much better material available on the web for free

The ""Professional Massage"" DVD is NOT advanced and would make a reasonable ""Basic Massage"" DVD if it was re-edited (e.g. move the anatomy to the start and use better graphics), the Shiatsu sections removed and the sessions re-recorded in higher quality.
The workbook is very poor compared to other books available; there are no detailed diagrams of the muscles to be massaged! Etc., etc..

In summary, this is a load of old material well passed its sell-by date which should be re-done rather than resold. You do get quite a lot for your money, but you would do much better to save up and buy a higher quality product.

[PS Available Material: A review of (better) massage material (DVDs, books etc) available can be found at the Terra Rossa web site

It scores the Basic Massage Therapy video 0/5 and says ""This DVD is a waste of time. Available on the web and Amazon with great hype and labels such as ""#1 best seller"" & ""A must see"" by Dr. Heith Root, ""Golden Web Award"". ""Recommended by Indiana College of Oriental Medicine"", This college is a Martial Arts College run by a church. Showing June a ""certified therapist"" giving Swedish massage from a distance.""

It scores the Massage Therapy for Professionals video 0/5 and says ""A complete waste of money & time. Another deceiving series. It is blurry, cheaply made and filmed on a home video. The first part shows some massage techniques by a ""professional"", and the second part the narrator gave a lecture on the anatomy of muscles on a whiteboard with hand drawn pictures.""

Perhaps I should have read this before buying the set??

PPS Suspicions:  Not only are this company's products apparently highly rated by obscure/bizarre/non-existent organisations and ""experts"", I note that many of the rave reviewers appear to (i) have bought many/all of this company's products  (and largely only their products), (ii) rated them all 5/5 and (iii) used extreme, over-the-top superlatives  to describe these very mediocre products.
One of the products was awarded 5/5 by a reviewer who admitted that she had not yet bought it. Some of the products seem to have been reviewed several times by the same person, with different stories as to how/why they bought them and how wonderful they were. All very Puzzling.

Amazon, is your star rating system being manipulated and the public conned?

Update. You will also note how many people vote against any negative review of this company's products. Normally you vote against a review if it has nothing to do with the product (e.g. the postage service) or if it simply says that something is rubbish without explaining why.  This is an honest, detailed review - look at the number of negative votes.",1282435200,7,3689,4.804107424960505
8306882,5,B001GSTTSE,"i don't have a lot of time to waste so i bought this and a couple other massage related products.  I really liked this and learned a lot.

i recommend this to novice beginers like me",1272844800,9,182,4.027777777777778
8306883,2,B001GSTTSE,"I was quite disappointed in this massage dvd package and workbook. There were anatomical errors on the DVDs. I was
surprised that one of the videos shows the therapist being barefoot while performing massage. Very unprofessional.
Video showed a sign that said left leg twice eventhough therapist was on the right leg.
The workbook had several mispellings. I would not use sounds of the Colorado Rockies in my massage practice/ too much water sound.
I returned all materials for a refund.",1265328000,4,487,5.0246913580246915
8306884,5,B001GSTTSE,I've used instructional videos by this company before and have found them to do an excellent job in their production.  I would highly recommend this one as well as it was well presented and helped me greatly.  Thanks guys/gals!!!,1226275200,11,229,4.846153846153846
