2418391,2,B000BITVMY,"First off- What the hell are these guys smoking to give this 5 stars?

Yours truly, a huge wrestling fan, and a longtime TNA fan tells you NOT to buy this show, it will give you the wrong message about TNA.

AMW and 3lk vs. Team Canada- An ok match but it was filled with ridiculously stupid spots. Still, not bad. ** (out of 5)

Chris Sabin vs, Chase Stevens- ok X match not that good though This is what the X division is about to me, not trainwreck spot fests but actual wrestling. a ''shocking'' debut at the end (No, it's not the shockmaster. Sorry)  **

Phi Delta Slam vs. DOD- Oh dear, yours truly Dusty Rhoads who works now for wwe booked this match... Go figure. It sucked, Two Bam Bam Bigalow wanna be's vs. two 7 feet tall talentless Harris Bro's. Thankfully when Dusty was fired these two left and so you won't have to watch them every saturday at 11pm on spike tv.  DUD

Dustin Rhoads(Gold Dust) vs. Raven dog collar match- This is when Raven was out of shape and Dustin.. well he sucks as always. Very attrocious match.  *

Kevin Nash vs. The Outlaw(Billy Gunn)NODQ- I beg you, skip this match! This makes the previous dog collar match look like Piper vs. Valentine! The hideously crappy ending booked by Dusty made this sink even worse. DUD

ULtimate X match-  Finally, a good match on the show. I absolutly LOVED this match, hopefully it is released on a seperate dvd, because good as this is it isn't enough to buy the show.  ***1/2

JJ vs, DDP- What year is this? I don't think Dusty remembers... And it isn't a coincidence that a month after he becomes booker for wwe Goldust and Vader appear. Meh match. Not that good, barely worth a watch.  * 1/2

I beg you BEG YOU! Do NOT buy this show. Against all odds, Victory road, Turning Point, Final Resolution, and Lockdown are all years better than this!

But be sure to catch TNA this thursday night from 9-11 on spike tv for their first Primetime special! I gaurentee that it will blow this crappy show out of the water!",1130803200,,1987,4.358695652173913

8087137,3,B000BITVMY,"I had never watched TNA until it came to Spike tv near the end of 2005 and even then I didn't really enjoy it until Christian Cage jumped ship from WWE. While watching him, I began to really get hooked on TNA and to this day, I enjoy it a lot more than WWE. With that said this DVD royally sucked except for one match. I am glad that I purchased this PPV DVD because it made me grateful at how much TNA has improved since 2005. The one exception (and the only reason I am not giving this one star) is the Ultimate X match between Ron Killings, Christopher Daniels, Elix Skipper, and A.J. Styles(c). This match is on my top twenty list of greatest matches I have ever seen and I have been watching wrestling since the late 1980s.

If you want to enjoy one great match and relish in the fact that TNA is a great brand of wrestling, then purchase this DVD.",1168560000,,853,4.13855421686747

8087139,2,B000BITVMY,"I'm not gonna give you a TNA vs. WWE debate because it's pointless.  As a fan of TNA, even I gotta say that this was the WORST PPV DVD available right now because alot of the matches didn't live up to the hype, alot of the matches were cut short, the ones that should have been cut short were long & boring, the storylines made you say ""What was the point of that?"" when the night was over, and 2 outta the 3 best matches are available on other & better TNA DVD's at the same price as this one.  Again, this PPV was TNA's worst PPV DVD.

AMW & 3LK vs. Team Canada - This was actually a good opener & nice 8 man tag.

Chris Cabin vs. Chase Stevens of The Naturals - Match was cut short before you could even get into it.

Bullrope Match: Raven vs. Dustin Rhodes - Another long & boring match between these two.

Team Trinity (Phi Delta Slam) vs. Team Traci (Disciples Of Destruction) - This was off the storyline that Trinity & Traci were fighting to be Dusty Rhodes' assistant & the winning tag team representative would get the job.  Didn't make any sense since both of them ended up with Dusty afterwards anyways.  Match was a dud.

Monty Brown vs. Trytan - This storyline seemed like a cheap rip off of the Hogan/Warrior WCW fued, and just like the storyline.  The match sucked too.  The ending had Trytan disappear and then appear on the entrance ramp just to walk away.  This didn't make any sense by the end of the night.

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Jeff Hardy vs. Abyss - The PPV finally picks up here as this was a typical TNA hardcore match and was tons better than their match at Against All Odds.
Note: This is also available on the ""Enigma: The Best Of Jeff Hardy"" DVD.

First Blood Match: Kevin Nash vs. Kip James - As a side note, the announcers had to re-record the play by play since WWE enforced their trademark on the name ""Outlaw"".  This match was just basically a dud as well since both guys were just slow and the ending was a complete jip.

Ultimate X match: AJ Styles vs. Christopher Daniels vs. Ron Killings vs. Elix Skipper - This was elimation style match as it started as a tag into a triple threat into the Ultimate X match.  Again, one of the best matches of the night but not the best Ultimate X match there has been.
Note: This is also available on the ""Best Of The X Division Vol. 1"" DVD.

NWA Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. DDP - Basically, if you like their WCW matches then you'll like this...if you didn't then you won't like this.  Alots of run-ins and the ending came when Monty Brown turned on DDP & joined up with Jarrett.
After everything that happened with Trytan earlier in the night, Brown is going to join up with Jarrett?

Again this PPV is TNA's worst one out on DVD right now and two of the best matches (Hardy/Abyss, Ultimate X) are on the other TNA DVD's so this isn't worth your money.  If you want to see the best TNA DVD's, try looking for that TNA Anthology box set with Victory Road, Turning Point, and Lockdown.",1134691200,2,2963,4.264758497316637
8087140,2,B000BITVMY,"Destination X 2005 was a decent PPV but early 2005 wasn't such a great year for TNA.

AMW and 3Live KRu VS Team Canada: I cant really remember this, nor do I care. Team Canada always made me mad because all they did was cheat to win. Sure its a wrestling gimmick but it got annoying fast.

Chris Sabin VS Chase Stevens: This is were TNA goes wrong. They put matches that can be left on national tv. The funniest part of the match was when Shocker debuted. Tenay yells out ""Its the guy from the McDonalds commerical!"" Is that going help sell tickets? Is it a TNA's new sponsor? Very dumb match.

Phi Delta Slam VS DOD: I forgot The Harris were in TNA. Then again, they did have a lot of leftover WCW stars. I could careless about this match.

Monty Brown VS Trytan: Where is the PPV headed? Its like a WWE Heat right now. This match really sucked bad.

Jeff Hardy VS Abyss: They had a great feud and probably the only thing Hardy did worthwhile in TNA. Other then that, the match was good.

Kevin Nash VS Kip James: I cant believe people didn't walk out on TNA at this point. Sure Abyss VS Hardy was good but this whole PPV sucks. The ending was stupid.

Ultimate X: AJ Styles VS Christopher Daniels VS Ron Killings VS Elix Skipper: This is the only reason EVER to watch TNA. These matches are always worth watching, at least once. It was a good match but not the best. Again, a stupid ending. It did build Daniel's heel character though.

Jeff Jarrett VS DDP: The worst part of TNA was there main events, even to this day. TNA really needs to work on there main events. This match had lots of run ins and Jarrett came out on top again. Nothing really speical.

A side note that someone should look for when watching a TNA show. As a match goes on, a camera looks to the crowd that look dead. Then they pan to the action in the ring and the fans start cheering again. I don't know why it happens but it always does. Do they pump in fake cheering at these events?

Overall, the PPV sucked. Abyss VS Hardy was good but you could get that on other TNA dvds.",1132272000,,2053,4.187817258883249
